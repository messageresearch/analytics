[0:00] Blood
[0:03] caused a life
[0:06] that paid my way.
[0:11] Death it's pride.
[0:13] [Music]
[0:18] Down from the cross.
[0:22] [Music]
[0:23] My sins were gone.
[0:27] My sins were gone.
[0:31] There is a grave
[0:35] that tried to hide.
[0:39] This precious blood
[0:43] that gave me life.
[0:47] But in three days
[0:51] he breathed
[0:53] again
[0:55] and rose to stand.
[0:59] in my defense.
[1:03] And so I've come
[1:07] to tell you he's alive.
[1:11] To tell you that he dries
[1:15] every tear that falls.
[1:20] And so I come
[1:24] that he saves
[1:27] to shout and to proclaim
[1:31] that he's coming back for you.
[1:36] There is a blood
[1:40] and it sides the blind.
[1:44] It heals the sick,
[1:48] the lonely fight.
[1:52] It has the power
[1:56] to free the bow.
[2:00] How chains they fall
[2:04] upon the ground.
[2:08] So pour it out
[2:12] to cleanse my soul
[2:17] and let it liquid
[2:21] glory flow
[2:25] because it lives
[2:29] to make me whole.
[2:33] I owe my life.
[2:37] My yo, my all.
[2:41] That's why I've come
[2:44] to tell you he's alive.
[2:48] To tell you that he dries
[2:53] every tear that falls.
[2:57] And so I come
[3:00] to tell you that he saves
[3:04] to shout and to proclaim
[3:08] that he's coming back for you.
[3:11] [Music]
[3:15] What can wash away
[3:20] my sin?
[3:22] It's nothing but the blood.
[3:26] Oh, nothing but the blood.
[3:30] And what can make me whole again?
[3:38] Nothing but the blood.
[3:42] Sing. Nothing but the blood. Tell me
[3:46] what can wash away my sin.

[3:58] Nothing but the blood.
[4:01] And what can make me whole again?
[4:09] Nothing but the blood.
[4:13] Nothing but the blood.
[4:20] There is a blood
[4:23] and it cost a life
[4:27] that paid my way
[4:31] death its price.
[4:35] And when it flowed
[4:39] down from that cross,
[4:43] my sins were gone.
[4:47] my sins for God.
[4:51] There is a grave
[4:54] that tried to hide
[4:59] this precious blood
[5:03] that gave me.
[5:05] But in three days
[5:09] he breathes again
[5:13] and rose to stand
[5:17] in my defense.
[5:21] That's why I've come
[5:24] to tell you here the lie.
[5:28] To tell you that he dries
[5:33] every tear that falls.
[5:37] And so I've come
[5:40] to tell you that he saves,
[5:44] to shout and to proclaim
[5:48] that he's coming back for you.
[5:52] [Music]

[6:05] The lonely fight.
[6:09] It has the power
[6:13] to free the bound.
[6:18] chains they fall
[6:21] upon the ground.
[6:25] So pour it out
[6:29] to cleanse my soul.
[6:33] Just let it liquid
[6:37] gloryy flow
[6:41] because it lives
[6:45] to make me whole.

[21:47] I feel Jesus.
[21:53] [Music]
[21:56] I feel Jesus.
[22:04] I feel Jesus
[22:12] in this place.
[22:18] [Music]
[22:20] And my soul
[22:24] does
[22:26] [Music]
[22:28] burn
[22:30] within
[22:32] me.
[22:36] Oh, I feel Jesus
[22:42] in
[22:44] [Music]
[22:46] this place.
[22:51] Surely
[22:54] the presence
[22:57] of the Lord
[23:00] is in this place.
[23:04] I can feel
[23:06] his mighty power
[23:10] and his grace.
[23:14] [Music]
[23:24] Glory.
[23:38] [Music]
[23:58] [Music]
[24:13] I see glory
[24:15] [Music]
[24:22] the presence
[24:25] of the Lord. Amen.
[24:36] Surely the presence of the Lord is in
[24:38] this place.
[24:40] I believe he's here because I know that
[24:42] you're feeling
[24:45] in the songs.
[24:47] He's in the scriptures. I'm sure that
[24:49] he's been with you throughout the day.
[24:51] He's been speaking to you.
[24:54] And that's what we need here this
[24:56] evening. We have a lot of voices in this
[24:58] world. There's a lot of things that go
[25:02] on in the news and a lot of celebrities
[25:06] that speak, a lot of political figures
[25:08] that speak, and we have a lot of family
[25:11] members that speak. And sometimes if
[25:13] we're not careful, just our minds become
[25:16] muddled up with the daily tasks and the
[25:19] different voices that we hear. But when
[25:20] we hear Jesus speak, we know that
[25:22] there's an anchor. We know that beyond
[25:25] the shadow of a doubt that this must be
[25:27] real because we just have to decipher a
[25:30] lot of things in life whether it's true
[25:32] whether it's false
[25:34] whether what was exactly said or what
[25:36] wasn't but God made very sure that
[25:38] whatever he said was written down right
[25:40] here in the Bible something that we can
[25:43] look back to something that we can look
[25:45] and we can say you know what this is
[25:47] just what it says is black and white
[25:50] and if this word has anything for us.
[25:54] We know that his promises are true.
[25:56] Amen.
[25:58] Amen. It's just wonderful to be here in
[26:00] the house of the Lord here this evening.
[26:02] And amen to be here with the people and
[26:05] just to see everybody's faces and I know
[26:08] here on it being Wednesday and kind of
[26:12] be a little tiring and I'm a little
[26:14] tired too, but come here to do our lot.
[26:18] come here to just be here in the
[26:21] presence of the Lord and to share this
[26:22] time with you and I guess I'm going to
[26:25] go ahead and be just using this mic
[26:27] here.
[26:28] you know, um when Kobe gets up to sing
[26:31] and she's in not too very long after
[26:33] you're coming up, I uh I didn't have
[26:35] time to put my little mic on, you know,
[26:37] and so well it'd be all right, I guess.
[26:41] Just just Yeah, if you want to, you
[26:44] know, already brother Caitlin's already
[26:46] in the back already doing this to me,
[26:48] you know, and so but um
[26:51] that's just wonderful to be here in in
[26:54] God's house. Sure. Have
[26:57] gotten a lot of rain, you know, and
[27:01] been a lot of time of
[27:04] [Music]
[27:07] going to put me all together here. I've
[27:09] already messed up. I hadn't even started
[27:10] yet.
[27:13] [Music]
[27:37] Amen.
[27:40] There we are right there.
[27:43] Amen. You love him here this evening. If
[27:46] we could, we'd like to go ahead and move
[27:48] into our scriptures here. We like to
[27:50] start in uh Matthew the 16th chapter and
[27:56] just going to have a real simple thought
[27:58] here this evening.
[28:01] And um today's a special day. Of course,
[28:03] we all know that
[28:06] Bosco and Patrick's going to be being
[28:08] baptized today. And
[28:11] &gt;&gt; and uh just a wonderful thing to see.
[28:13] Yeah, I was just uh telling brother
[28:17] Windle
[28:18] that you know the we can really miss out
[28:22] on some of the treasures in life and if
[28:25] we misplace what treasure really is and
[28:27] it's not a fine building or cars that we
[28:30] drive but it's the souls that God gives
[28:32] his kingdom. Amen. and and it's the the
[28:36] people that are in this building that
[28:38] have stood at their posts of duty and
[28:41] stood here to see these things happen so
[28:43] people can come in and not see people
[28:46] but see the God of the Bible that we
[28:49] want to live portrayed to live and and
[28:52] if we would just go ahead here in
[28:54] Matthew 16 and and uh starting here
[29:02] believe it's
[29:06] I'm still kind of getting used to this
[29:08] whole little uh computer thing here. And
[29:12] if I'm not careful, I'll put my words
[29:13] together and next thing you know, some
[29:15] of my words are over here and some of my
[29:18] words are over here. and kind of have to
[29:20] kind of put them together, you know, and
[29:23] and um but it says here in Matthew 16,
[29:26] starting at the first verse,
[29:29] it says here, "The Pharisees also with
[29:33] the Sadducees came and tempted, desired
[29:35] him that he would show them a sign from
[29:38] heaven. He answered and said unto them,
[29:41] when is it evening?" Ye say it will be
[29:44] fair weather, for the sky is red. And in
[29:48] the morning it will be foul weather
[29:49] today, for the sky is red and lowering.
[29:52] And oh ye hypocrites, you can discern
[29:54] the face of the sky, but you cannot
[29:57] discern the signs of the times. And a
[30:00] wicked and adulterous generation
[30:02] sinkketh after sign, and there shall no
[30:04] sign be given unto it, but the sign of
[30:06] the prophet Jonas. And he left them and
[30:09] departed. Amen. Let's just go to the
[30:12] Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we love
[30:13] you.
[30:15] Lord, we would just ask that you would
[30:17] just be in our service here this
[30:18] evening, Lord. And we just ask that you
[30:21] would just help me and give me the words
[30:23] to speak. But ask, Lord, that you would
[30:25] be with the congregation, Lord. Just
[30:28] whatever you would have to say, let it
[30:30] be said. Lord, what it's not that it
[30:32] wouldn't. But we just give these things
[30:35] over to you and just ask that you would
[30:36] be pleased in Jesus name. Amen. You
[30:39] could be seated here this evening.
[30:42] And if I had a title,
[30:44] it would be recognizing his presence.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; And looking at this uh passage of
[30:51] scripture that we had just read, I had
[30:53] been going back and listening to uh the
[30:57] message um
[30:59] uh the presence of God unrecognized. And
[31:02] if you haven't if you haven't listened
[31:04] to that sermon, it's a it's a pretty
[31:06] good sermon to listen to. It's just at
[31:09] that right point, you know, where you
[31:10] can write right amount of time frame
[31:12] where you can kind of squeeze it in here
[31:14] or you can squeeze it in there. You
[31:15] still kind of put it all together. But
[31:18] I've been thinking about this passage of
[31:19] scripture, uh, you know, or thinking
[31:22] about this passage of scripture which
[31:24] was me or mentioned in that message and
[31:27] just kind of mulling it over my mind and
[31:29] thinking about the recognizing his
[31:32] presence, you know, because it's pretty
[31:35] important for us. There's a lot of
[31:37] things to recognize in the earth and
[31:39] there's a lot of things that we need to
[31:40] pay attention to. We need to keep track
[31:42] of, you know, we have we have to wake up
[31:45] in the morning on time, right guys? We
[31:48] go in the morning on time, be at work,
[31:51] and you know, we got these kinds of
[31:52] things that we got to do in in the
[31:54] morning. So, we got to remember to be up
[31:55] in the morning and you know, we got to
[31:58] remember to, you know, what time to come
[31:59] home and what time dinner is and you
[32:02] know, we there's a lot of things that we
[32:03] got to remember. you know, you remember
[32:05] if you got a flat tire, you know, you
[32:07] better get it fixed or you're going to
[32:08] be walking somewhere, you know, or
[32:10] there's a lot of things that we got to
[32:12] remember, you know, that we got to
[32:13] recognize during our daily life. But if
[32:16] we're not careful, we leave God
[32:17] unrecognized. We leave God in in our
[32:20] lives unrecognized. And the only thing
[32:22] that I could think of, you know, but
[32:24] what would it be? What what would be the
[32:26] things that keep us from recognizing God
[32:27] in our lives? And you know, sometimes
[32:30] the word can be preached, you know,
[32:31] pretty simple, pretty clear. And we're
[32:34] we're very fortunate, especially in the
[32:35] hour that we live in, to have a word
[32:37] that's pretty straightforward. And God
[32:40] was graceful to us to give us a prophet
[32:42] in this day that we live in that to be
[32:44] able to come and not to uh put the word
[32:47] back into mystery form, but to be able
[32:49] to bring light over it that we could see
[32:51] exactly what God was thinking. But if
[32:54] even in doing that, if we're not
[32:55] careful, the word of God becomes common
[32:58] to us and it becomes common in our lives
[33:00] and these the the words of life, the
[33:03] seed of life can fall upon deaf ear. And
[33:05] it could be just something that just as
[33:07] a phrase says that, you know, just water
[33:09] off a duck's back and it's just
[33:10] something that we've we become uh common
[33:13] to because we live in an area where a
[33:15] message church is. We live in an air we
[33:17] have a uh a pastor that's seasoned in
[33:20] the message. We got elders that are in
[33:22] our congregation, you know, that are
[33:24] seasoned in the message that, you know,
[33:26] we have good song leader, good
[33:27] musicians, you know, we got ministers,
[33:30] we've got, you know, elder sisters, you
[33:32] know, our congregation is pretty
[33:33] equipped, but yet at the same time, if
[33:35] we're not careful, we can instead of
[33:37] leaning on those types of things, we can
[33:39] uh lean onto our own understanding. And
[33:42] uh a lot of these people that we have
[33:43] that I had mentioned are not just
[33:46] individuals of themselves but they're
[33:48] pillars and they're they're people to
[33:50] lean to that have uh lean themselves
[33:52] leaned on the word of God and and have
[33:54] built their foundations on the word of
[33:56] God and been able to uh uh stand on
[33:59] their uh stand on their own two feet if
[34:01] that's the way that you want to put it
[34:02] but yet but but yet have the word of God
[34:05] as their foundation. And you know, and I
[34:08] begin to think of also that sometimes
[34:10] that if we're not careful that, you
[34:12] know, some things that could keep us
[34:13] from recognizing uh God's presence in
[34:15] our midst is afflictions. And you know,
[34:19] uh things that go on in our bodies and
[34:21] things that we fight in our mind and
[34:22] things that we fight uh you know uh
[34:25] especially that's what an affliction is,
[34:27] something that's been put on us. And we
[34:29] can become sidetracked by the situation
[34:31] at hand rather than recognizing the
[34:34] truth of God's word that we have for
[34:36] today. And and it could be preached over
[34:38] the pulpit, you know, whether that uh
[34:40] you know that we don't have to live with
[34:42] a affliction, but yet we have power
[34:44] through God's word to be able to heal
[34:46] our bodies. But sometimes those things,
[34:49] those seeds could be planted in our
[34:50] heart and we can let affliction be able
[34:52] to come and to be able to uh kind of
[34:55] pull that seed out and we and we decide
[34:57] to live with it without recognizing
[34:59] God's presence in our midst. And and
[35:01] then sometimes we can let off a fence.
[35:02] We can let things between brothers or
[35:04] sisters or husbands or wives or we can
[35:06] let things between, you know, good
[35:08] friends that have been that have been,
[35:10] you know, uh friends for a long time.
[35:12] And we can let we can instead of letting
[35:14] God come in and mend something amend a
[35:17] situation that's been said or if one
[35:19] brother or another brother or sister
[35:21] feels aught within one one another
[35:23] instead of going and correcting it and
[35:25] using the word of God uh using the word
[35:27] of God to be able to take that and mend
[35:30] a situation rather than cause us a scar
[35:32] or divide into it. we can rather we can
[35:35] lean on those types of things, our
[35:37] feelings and and we can leave the
[35:39] presence of God unrecognized and and you
[35:41] know and I begin to think about also
[35:43] that um a lot of times it doesn't matter
[35:45] if it's men or women but we can leave
[35:48] but we can let the cares of life we can
[35:50] let our responsibilities and we can let
[35:52] the things that we do daytoday that are
[35:54] important and shouldn't be swept under
[35:56] the rug or just kind of pushed off a
[35:58] side or put in the shade somewhere but
[36:00] yet we can let the cares of life begin
[36:02] to weigh us down and these things and
[36:04] our responsibilities become number one
[36:06] rather than recognizing the presence of
[36:09] God in our lives. And also we could just
[36:12] flat out not care and we could just uh
[36:14] we could just look and we could lust
[36:16] after the things of the world or we
[36:17] could covet after the different things
[36:19] you know like the my brother drives a
[36:21] nice truck or my you know my sister she
[36:23] has a nice set of dishes you know or or
[36:26] it could be you children you know it
[36:27] could be it could be things or my
[36:29] friends have this and I don't have that
[36:31] and you know and we we can forget our
[36:34] purpose and we can forget exactly what
[36:36] God's trying to do through us to show
[36:39] the world. And a lot of times a lot of a
[36:41] lot of things that I have talked about
[36:43] we don't have a physical element or
[36:45] physical element physical body of Jesus
[36:48] Christ that's walking amongst us but yet
[36:50] he's alive again in the body word and
[36:53] yet the word that's being preached over
[36:55] the pulpit or that we listen through
[36:57] through the message can take it it takes
[36:59] shape inside of our lives and is
[37:02] displayed through in the in and through
[37:04] the word. It's something that we can
[37:05] look at to be able to see whether you're
[37:08] fighting an affliction in your body, the
[37:09] word's there. The word is there to bring
[37:12] healing to your body. And that's the
[37:13] presence of God. And you and whether
[37:16] whether you're facing an offense with a
[37:18] brother and and you're trying to find
[37:20] that place to be able to to be able to
[37:22] mend or bridge that gap, you can go to
[37:24] the word and you can see God mend the
[37:27] gap that's there. And and I begin to
[37:28] think about how that how that you know
[37:31] that there's a lot of there's a lot of
[37:32] things that we could recognize. You
[37:34] know, the world has a way of recognizing
[37:36] people and and a lot of us have gone
[37:38] have know some of these things. But yet
[37:40] sometimes, you know, uh in in a form of
[37:43] recognition usually, you know, usually
[37:46] recognition comes uh uh to acknowledge
[37:49] as one uh to be heard at that time or to
[37:52] acknowledge with an uh with an
[37:54] appreciation or to take notice. And
[37:57] sometimes you know uh there's phrases or
[38:00] there's you know gestures that uh people
[38:02] do uh to recognize some great
[38:04] achievement that uh someone has did and
[38:06] and you know usually that comes in the
[38:08] form of you know nowadays they have the
[38:10] fist bump or they have the high five you
[38:12] know or they have you know or they have
[38:14] some kind of you know hey you did a good
[38:15] job or you did something like that and
[38:17] and you're recognizing somebody's
[38:19] achievement. you're recognizing some
[38:21] what somebody has done and how that how
[38:24] that man they did they sure did a great
[38:25] job you know and the world has a way of
[38:27] of recognizing people you know and so
[38:30] they offer up a what they call a Nobel
[38:32] Peace Prize and you know um you know
[38:34] they have the Nobel Peace Prize and
[38:36] certain things that people do uh to to
[38:39] achieve this prize. you know, I was just
[38:41] kind of thinking of this and so I was
[38:42] kind of, you know, going through the old
[38:44] Google, you know, and and trying to find
[38:46] some people that, you know, had won the
[38:47] Nobel Peace Prize and uh one of the men
[38:50] that had come up was Niho uh Hand
[38:54] Handoy, you know, I don't know who that
[38:56] guy is and I'm probably never going to
[38:57] meet him, but you know, he won the Nobel
[38:59] Peace Prize and apparently everybody
[39:01] thinks that we should know him, you
[39:02] know, but but it says here that he wins
[39:05] the Nobel Peace Prize and that was for
[39:07] his efforts to achieve a world free of
[39:10] nuclear weapons. And so he had, you
[39:12] know, drawn up a whole bunch of articles
[39:14] and helped organize a lot of things from
[39:16] different countries and different places
[39:18] to be able to try to achieve a world
[39:20] free of nuclear weapons. And and you
[39:23] know, another thing that they have is
[39:25] they have a trophy for the NBA finals.
[39:27] You know, and a lot of us know, you
[39:28] know, that we you know, the the Oklahoma
[39:30] City Thunder, you know, they're they're
[39:32] the champs. You know, they're the ones
[39:33] that are that are reigning at the moment
[39:35] as as the ones. And you know, so they
[39:37] get the big trophy and the shirts and
[39:39] they get to to go and meet the
[39:41] president, you know, and they get to
[39:42] they parade them all down the streets as
[39:44] the winners, you know, that these are
[39:46] that these are the number one, you know,
[39:47] and this is the way that the world is
[39:49] honoring their champions, you know, and
[39:51] and another one, you know, is a another
[39:54] way that the um, you know, the world or
[39:56] you could probably put this as the
[39:57] military is that they put the Medal of
[40:00] Honor on somebody for somebody that has
[40:02] achieved something really uh, heartfelt
[40:04] and somebody that has done something
[40:06] above and beyond what what their call of
[40:09] duty was, you know, and I began to think
[40:10] uh I was I looked up and there was a man
[40:12] named uh Leroy Petri, you know, he was
[40:15] uh on his seventh deployment there in
[40:17] Iraq or in Afghanistan, he was on a
[40:20] mission to capture a Taliban target and
[40:22] despite being wounded in both legs and
[40:24] he had g uh he was still giving orders
[40:27] uh to to keep fighting and and then a
[40:29] grenade came in the midst of him and his
[40:31] friends and he had picked up the grenade
[40:33] and to throw it away from to throw it
[40:36] away from his uh comrades that were
[40:38] fighting there on the field. And in
[40:39] doing so, he he threw it, but the
[40:41] grenade didn't get too far away and it
[40:43] blew up and it disabled him from being
[40:45] able to fight and you know and fight
[40:47] further in the battle. But yet, he was
[40:49] awarded the Medal of Honor because the
[40:51] world was recognizing this man. He was
[40:54] recognizing what he what he had done for
[40:56] his country. And and you know, I was uh
[40:59] you know, and I began to think about
[41:01] this. You know, you have this whole list
[41:02] of people that have been recognized and
[41:04] and you people that have been awarded
[41:06] these medals and been put, you know, and
[41:08] their name are being etched in history
[41:10] forever, but yet there's a lot of people
[41:12] that have done substantial things, but
[41:14] yet not have been recognized. And, you
[41:16] know, you can use you can use the uh the
[41:19] coined phrase of unsung heroes if that's
[41:22] how you want to put it. And and uh you
[41:24] know, so I begin to kind of look around.
[41:26] I begin to kind of again go back to
[41:27] Google and just be like, "Okay, let's
[41:29] check these people out." and and I begin
[41:31] to look and and there's a man named uh
[41:33] Stan Petro. Uh he was a uh actually he
[41:36] was a Soviet defense officer that was uh
[41:39] he prevented a nuclear war uh in 1983
[41:42] between the United States and Russia by
[41:44] correctly identifying a false alarm in
[41:47] their system, thus calling off a nuclear
[41:50] strike from Russia to the United States.
[41:52] And and so thinking about this, you
[41:54] know, we could have been at war in 1983,
[41:57] you know, between the United States and
[41:58] Russia because of a glitch, you know,
[42:00] that happened inside of a system. And
[42:02] you know, there was another person
[42:03] called Irene Sindler. She was a Polish
[42:06] social worker. Uh she had organized the
[42:08] escape of 2500 Jewish children from the
[42:11] Warsaw ghetto uh from extermination, you
[42:13] know. And then I began to went down. I'd
[42:16] seen three uh this one right here. And a
[42:18] lot of people know about this and we we
[42:20] had all heard about the Chernobyl
[42:21] disaster, but there was a group of men
[42:23] and they were called the suicide squad.
[42:25] And these men were were the ones that
[42:27] were selected. Uh somebody had to do it,
[42:29] you know, somebody had to go back inside
[42:31] of the reactor and had to uh disconnect
[42:33] the the reactor in order for it from it
[42:36] to keep a chain reaction, which they
[42:38] said could have possibly destroyed 50%
[42:41] of Europe today uh if if these men
[42:43] hadn't went back in there. But yet uh
[42:46] but yet a lot of the world don't know
[42:47] who these people are and a lot of people
[42:49] a lot of the world uh you know just is
[42:51] focused on what's glamorous and and you
[42:54] know uh the world and that's what it
[42:55] kind that's what they look at you know
[42:56] they whether you know they look at
[42:58] what's glamorous you know what's pretty
[43:00] you know what's real uh what action you
[43:02] know uh something that they can really
[43:04] publicize out in the publicize out out
[43:07] in the world you know in order to in
[43:09] order to hit headlines but you know I
[43:11] begin to think about how that you know
[43:13] if if we're not careful We begin to not
[43:16] we begin to ourselves as believers, we
[43:18] begin to not recognize the one thing
[43:20] that we're meant to recognize and that's
[43:22] Jesus Christ. And and if we're not
[43:25] careful, we begin to recognize all the
[43:27] things that the devil does in our lives.
[43:28] And we begin to recognize how that he's
[43:31] put us in this situation. He's put us in
[43:33] that situation. And how that, you know,
[43:35] that uh well, you know what, my cars
[43:36] broke down. You know what? uh you know,
[43:38] I'm sick or you know, uh you know, I I I
[43:41] just I'm just depressed or you know, I
[43:43] just you know, I just don't see I just
[43:45] don't feel like I can make it any
[43:47] further. But yet God, but if we can just
[43:49] stop and recognize the move of God
[43:51] amongst us, you know, that God hasn't
[43:53] left us alone, but he's left us the
[43:55] unadulterated word to be able to dig
[43:58] into and be able to pull yourself out of
[44:01] a slump of depression and be able to
[44:02] pull you uh be able you could be able to
[44:05] pray over something and then God give
[44:06] you the God give you the ability to
[44:09] overcome over overcome something in your
[44:11] life and you know, but it's not uncommon
[44:14] for Jesus to become unrecognized. You
[44:16] know, it's it's not an uncommon thing.
[44:18] You know, you would think that somebody
[44:20] would that has such an effect upon the
[44:24] the world today. I mean, somebody that
[44:26] has such an effect. I mean, to where his
[44:29] words are preached in in in every almost
[44:31] every country
[44:34] all across the world that you would
[44:36] think that somebody could be lifted up,
[44:37] but yet this person uh faces the most
[44:40] controversy contro controversy
[44:45] &gt;&gt; controversy that faces the greatest
[44:47] controversy, you know, in the world
[44:49] today because of the things that he
[44:51] said. And the thing was is the reason
[44:53] why was because when Jesus come, he
[44:55] didn't come to be just with the norm.
[44:58] Jesus didn't come and just be able to
[45:00] try to keep all the world systems
[45:01] together and just be able to be like,
[45:03] "Hey, you guys are doing fine. You know,
[45:05] just keep throwing money in the coffers.
[45:07] You know, just, you know, you women can
[45:09] do exactly what you want to do. You
[45:10] know, hey, you men, you guys are doing
[45:12] fine. You know, you just keep things
[45:14] going as long as, you know, we're
[45:16] getting lamb slayed and money's going
[45:18] inside of the treasury. you know, things
[45:20] are just going to be okay. But that was
[45:22] never the purpose of doing that. But
[45:24] yet, his kingdom was to be able to set
[45:26] up to be set up in the hearts of
[45:28] believers and his word to be established
[45:31] inside of you to where you could do the
[45:34] greater works. And I and I began to
[45:35] think about this about if you look back
[45:37] and if you look back there in Jesus's
[45:39] day, you know, you look there right
[45:41] there at the scripture there in John
[45:43] 14:7-11. You know even Jesus followers
[45:48] didn't recognize who exactly Jesus was
[45:50] at the current time. There in the
[45:52] seventh verse it says if you have known
[45:54] me you know he's talking to Philip here
[45:56] he says if you have known me ye should
[45:58] have known my father also and from
[46:00] henceforth ye him and have ye seen him.
[46:03] Philip said unto him Lord show us the
[46:05] father and it would suffice us. Jesus
[46:08] said unto him, "Have I not been so long
[46:10] with you? And yet thou hast not known
[46:12] me, Philillip, that he that seeth me
[46:15] hast seen the Father? And how sayest
[46:17] thou then, show us the Father? Believest
[46:19] thou not that I am the Father, and the
[46:21] Father in me, the words that I speak
[46:23] unto you, I speak not of myself, but the
[46:26] Father that dwelleth in him. He doeth
[46:28] the works. Believeth me that I am the
[46:31] Father, and the Father in me, or else
[46:33] believe me for the very works that I
[46:36] sake." Now, you would think that
[46:37] somebody that had been there and seen
[46:38] the miracles and listened to him speak
[46:41] would all would start to kind of put the
[46:43] connection together. Yeah. But yet, even
[46:45] his own followers, you can go down again
[46:48] there, Luke 8:22, there in uh 8-22,
[46:52] starting at the 22nd verse, it says,
[46:54] "Now it comes to pass in a certain day
[46:56] that he went out to the ship with his
[46:59] disciples, and he said unto him, let us
[47:01] go over unto the other side of the lake,
[47:03] and they launched forth. But as they
[47:05] sailed, he fell asleep, speaking of
[47:07] Jesus. And there came down a storm or of
[47:11] winds on the lake, and they were filled
[47:13] and they were filled with water and were
[47:15] in jeopardy. And they came to him and
[47:18] awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we
[47:20] perish." Then he arose and rebuked the
[47:23] winds and the raging of the waters, and
[47:25] they ceased. And he and they were and
[47:28] they was a calm. And he said unto them,
[47:31] "Where is your faith?" And the and they
[47:34] being afraid wondered, saying one to
[47:36] another, what manner of man is this? For
[47:39] he commandeth even the winds and the
[47:42] water to obey him. Now think about this
[47:44] again. You got his disciples sitting on
[47:46] the boat there with Jesus and they have
[47:49] to question to themselves amongst the
[47:51] what manner of of man is this that is
[47:53] there? You know, so Jesus even amongst
[47:55] his own friends begin to come
[47:56] unrecognized. Well, how be it that me
[47:59] and you could sit here in a message
[48:01] church, in a congregation that preaches
[48:03] the gospel and miss the very Jesus that
[48:06] we say that we come to see. Amen.
[48:08] Because we begin to come and we begin we
[48:10] begin to get car we begin to get carried
[48:12] away by the cares of life. We begin to
[48:15] get carried away by our afflictions. we
[48:17] begin to get carried away by by by um
[48:20] you know by things of this world,
[48:22] seeking after riches or or making sure
[48:24] job situations are done just right or or
[48:27] maybe offenses between brothers and
[48:29] sisters and but yet we would focus on
[48:31] them things rather than recognizing
[48:33] Jesus amongst us even in this building
[48:36] here this evening. Now I begin to look
[48:38] back and I begin to come and and you
[48:40] know they're religious people. You know,
[48:41] you would think that since Jesus, you
[48:43] know, is the most high God, you would
[48:45] think that since Jesus, you know, this
[48:47] one that has been spoken of for hundreds
[48:49] and thousands of years of the one to
[48:51] come, that when he would come that he
[48:53] would be he would be welcomed with open
[48:55] hearts by every person. Again, the
[48:57] religious lead religious leaders and we
[49:00] read this scripture, but I'm just going
[49:01] to go ahead and read it again. Matthew
[49:03] 16:1 and4 the Pharisees also with the
[49:06] Sadducees came tempting to desire him
[49:08] that that they would show him a sign
[49:11] from above. Now Jesus has done all these
[49:13] signs.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus has done all these things
[49:16] and all these things but yet but yet
[49:18] they're commanding him a sign. And he
[49:20] answered unto them when it or he
[49:23] answered unto them when is it evening? I
[49:25] say unto you that it be fair weather for
[49:28] the sky is red and in the morning it
[49:29] will be foul weather today for the sky
[49:31] is red and lowing or oh you hypocrites
[49:34] you can discern the face of the sky. to
[49:36] think about this. You can discern you
[49:38] can you can you can tell all these other
[49:40] things that are going around you but you
[49:42] cannot discern the signs of the times
[49:46] and and see now now we could now just
[49:48] for a moment and I don't mean to ruffle
[49:50] up your feathers because I believe every
[49:51] one of us are angels here this morning
[49:53] at least I hope you are you know you
[49:55] know you know I hope you're a believer
[49:56] here this evening but I don't I you know
[49:58] I don't want to I don't want to make you
[49:59] mad but at the same time but do we fit
[50:01] into that boat here this evening you
[50:03] know do do we do we fit into that place
[50:05] where the Sadducees es and the Pharisees
[50:07] are where we're sitting here inside of a
[50:09] service and and and or or we're out
[50:11] there in the world and we're sitting
[50:12] there and we're like, "Jesus, if you
[50:13] would just show me a sign, I'll believe
[50:15] you. I'll totally dedicate my life. I'll
[50:18] totally surrender my life or or or or or
[50:20] or I'll put myself in the position to
[50:22] where I'll come to church, you know,
[50:24] consistently like like your word says
[50:26] for for it to to for it to do. God, if
[50:28] you would show me this or if you would
[50:30] do this or you or you know, I I'm gonna
[50:32] fleece you here or I'm gonna flee you
[50:34] fleece you there. But isn't the sign uh
[50:36] of God's word being perfect and open to
[50:39] us in this day as much of a sign as any
[50:41] other sign that there could be? Amen.
[50:43] That we don't have to sit and we don't
[50:44] have to dig through all the all the muck
[50:47] and all the meer of of Benny Hinn and
[50:49] Oral Roberts and and and and the that
[50:52] one guy that's down there in Texas, Mr.
[50:54] Smiley, what's his name? I can't never
[50:56] join. that we don't have to sit here and
[50:58] bounce from preacher to preacher to
[51:00] preacher to preacher to be able to sit
[51:02] there and say, "Oh, this person must be
[51:04] right and that must p that person must
[51:06] be right." But yet, we have a word
[51:07] that's vindicated for our day. that we
[51:10] have a word that we can come back and we
[51:12] can stand both feet on and it says it
[51:14] doesn't matter if I'm sick today I'm
[51:16] healed because the Bible says so it
[51:18] doesn't matter that it doesn't matter in
[51:20] my life in my family situation if it
[51:22] seems like my my children have gone so
[51:24] far out there in the world but yet the
[51:26] Bible says that I've claimed them and
[51:29] that I'm and that and that I'm holding
[51:30] fast to what I'm holding fast to what
[51:32] the scripture says they will come in one
[51:34] day doesn't matter if you what your body
[51:37] says the word says amen that you are
[51:40] healed. And so that's where that's where
[51:42] we begin. So we don't want to fall in
[51:44] the religious category. You know, we can
[51:46] go out and we can look at Pilate there
[51:48] in John 19:5 going through the 12th
[51:51] verse. He says, "When Jesus came forth
[51:53] wearing a crown of thorns and the purple
[51:55] robe and uh and a purple robe, and
[51:57] Pilate said unto him, behold the man."
[52:01] &gt;&gt; He when the chief's priests therefore
[52:03] and officers saw him, they cried out,
[52:05] saying, "Crucify him. Crucify him."
[52:08] Pilate saith unto them, "Take ye him and
[52:11] crucify him, for I find no fault in
[52:13] him."
[52:14] &gt;&gt; The Jews answered him, "We have a law,
[52:16] and by our law he ought to die, because
[52:18] he maketh himself the son of God."
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; He make He don't have to make himself
[52:25] nothing. He was
[52:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to make himself nothing.
[52:28] But yet, even the the Jews couldn't
[52:30] recognize who he was because he didn't
[52:33] come in the way that they wanted him to
[52:35] come. They didn't. They thought the
[52:37] Jesus that they were that the Jesus that
[52:39] or the yeah the the king that was coming
[52:41] at that time was the Jesus that was to
[52:43] be coming in the second coming. But yet
[52:45] they missed his first coming and the the
[52:47] fact that he was coming to set up a set
[52:49] up a kingdom in the hearts of the
[52:51] believers and to call out a gentile or
[52:54] call out or bring a message unto the
[52:56] Gentiles. And yet but yet they wanted
[52:58] him to come and deliver them from Roman
[53:00] oppression. But yet they missed the very
[53:02] fact that the Jesus that they were
[53:04] looking for came right bel right in
[53:07] front of their eyes and they missed it.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we can have that
[53:14] perception in church.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can have that that kind of
[53:19] an idea of church where we come to
[53:20] church and we expect that you know what
[53:22] you know what that that church should be
[53:24] this way. Yeah,
[53:26] &gt;&gt; I'll make some of you mad because I'm
[53:28] trustee
[53:30] &gt;&gt; that it should be this temperature.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; You know that that the light should be
[53:37] like this or the preacher should preach
[53:38] like that and the musician should play
[53:41] music like this or or you or you know
[53:43] what or the spirit of God can't come.
[53:46] You would be surprised the places that
[53:47] Jesus showed up. Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; You would be surprised at the places
[53:51] that Jesus showed up that the world
[53:53] would have looked at and said, "You
[53:54] really think that the Messiah would have
[53:55] been there?" But yet the places that he
[53:58] showed up, the places that he showed up
[54:00] that the world that that the world
[54:02] thought was kind was the very place that
[54:05] he could go and find acceptance.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; I began to think about this and about
[54:10] how that Jesus come to the woman at the
[54:12] well
[54:13] &gt;&gt; there in John 4 in the 10th verse. Jesus
[54:15] answered and said unto her, okay, now
[54:17] think about this. Now, we know the
[54:19] story. We know the story. And and some
[54:21] of this, you know, we're just going to
[54:22] kind of we're just going to kind of
[54:24] repeat and we're just going to kind of
[54:26] rehash. And, you know, we all know the
[54:28] story about the woman at the well, but
[54:29] but you know, she wasn't she wasn't the
[54:33] most purest of kind.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; You know, the woman the woman the woman
[54:38] at the well wasn't the most purest of
[54:39] kind. And and and we know that according
[54:42] to certain customs that, you know, that
[54:43] that the the the the virgin women would
[54:46] be able to come to the well and they
[54:47] would all come around and, you know,
[54:49] they would gather water at the well and
[54:51] they take it back to their houses and
[54:52] use it for, you know, laundry, drinking,
[54:55] whatever it is that those whatever that
[54:56] they would use the water for. But yet at
[54:58] this certain time was allotted those
[55:01] that were ill-famed.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Okay? And so this ill-famed woman comes
[55:07] up. But prior to this, Jesus tells his
[55:11] disciples, "I have a need to go by
[55:14] Samaria."
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Now, correct me if I'm getting this
[55:17] mixed up.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Okay? But but prior to this, before the
[55:21] lady goes to the well, and it's her time
[55:24] to come, Jesus is in another city
[55:26] somewhere saying that I have a need to
[55:28] go by Samaria.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And he shows up at this well at this
[55:32] time with a prostitute woman.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Okay. So, he's there by himself
[55:41] with the prostitute woman. Okay. You got
[55:43] Sadducees and Pharisees telling him, "We
[55:46] need signs for you to prove who you are.
[55:48] We need this. We need you to do that."
[55:50] You know, kind of like how, you know,
[55:51] sometimes if you're not careful, you can
[55:53] be like, "Well, preacher, I need you to
[55:54] do this in order for me to believe you."
[55:57] You know, or or you know what, uh, you
[55:59] know, we can't be doing that because
[56:01] that's not the normal time that we have
[56:03] church. or or you know what I'm just
[56:05] going to listen to church on the
[56:07] internet you know instead of being in
[56:08] the presence of God where I'm supposed
[56:10] to be you know I need to be doing you
[56:12] know instead of being you know at the
[56:14] faithful at the house of God you
[56:16] substitute substitute church with the TV
[56:19] you know where or or you know and you
[56:22] got this perception about how that how
[56:24] that Jesus should come and where he
[56:26] should be and what he should do but yet
[56:28] Jesus is in the where he needs to be at
[56:30] any place at any time and here he is
[56:32] with the harlot woman at a Well,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; yeah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. And yet all these Sadducees and
[56:37] Pharisees are out here or sitting out
[56:39] there in the world accusing him of being
[56:41] a a beelove. But the scripture says, now
[56:43] we go back here in the 10th verse. It
[56:45] says, Jesus answers and said unto her,
[56:47] if thou knowest the gift of God, and who
[56:49] it is is that that saith it to thee,
[56:52] give me a drink, thou wouldest have
[56:54] asked of him. And he would have given
[56:57] thee living water. The woman said unto
[56:59] him, Sir, thou has nothing to draw with.
[57:01] Okay. So, now she's figuring this out.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; What is he talking about?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; You come you come here with nothing and
[57:09] you're talking about you're talking
[57:11] about I'm going to give you a drink. You
[57:13] ain't got nothing to draw with.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. And the woman said, "Sir, the
[57:17] house has nothing to draw with. And the
[57:18] well is deep. From whence then hast thou
[57:21] the living water? Art thou greater than
[57:23] our father Jacob which hath gave us this
[57:26] well and drank thereof himself and and
[57:28] his children and his cattle?" Jesus
[57:31] answered and said unto her, "Whosoever
[57:33] drinkketh of this water shall thirst
[57:35] again
[57:37] to
[57:37] &gt;&gt; shall thirst again." He says, "But
[57:39] whosoever drinkketh of the water that I
[57:41] shall give him shall never thirst again.
[57:43] But the water that I shall give him
[57:45] shall give him shall be in him a well of
[57:48] water springing up into everlasting
[57:50] water." Now folks, we're not talking
[57:52] about dishani.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. We're not talking about Ozark
[57:56] water. We're not talking about the good
[57:57] oldfashioned Dollar General, you know,
[57:59] multi24 pack that you can buy for $7
[58:02] down here at the store here, okay? We're
[58:04] not talking about that kind of water
[58:05] that you're going to drink and all of a
[58:07] sudden you're just going to bubble up.
[58:08] He's like, I'm going to give you
[58:10] something.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give this I'm going to give
[58:13] this harlot woman something. Amen. That
[58:16] when she drinks of this water, she is
[58:18] never going to thirst again. Okay? So
[58:21] she says here but whosoever drink of
[58:23] this water that I shall give. Uh we'll
[58:25] go down next verse. And the woman
[58:26] statement said unto her sir give me this
[58:29] water.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; You know
[58:32] &gt;&gt; yes
[58:32] &gt;&gt; but society today don't want this water.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Society today don't want this water. And
[58:40] I I'm even going to go further than that
[58:42] because we know that society is where
[58:44] they're going to be. We already know
[58:46] that we have a prophet has already said
[58:47] that we live in a layan age. You know,
[58:50] we live in we live we live in a lay
[58:51] oysanian time where we're, you know,
[58:53] we're rich or, you know, we're increased
[58:55] with goods. You know, we we don't have
[58:57] need of nothing. We got our little
[58:59] circles that we can be in. We got our
[59:01] nice house that we can be in. We got our
[59:03] places, you know, we we we can watch,
[59:05] you know, we can we can watch anything
[59:07] from our phone. We can do all this, you
[59:09] know, you know, I don't have to be
[59:11] there. I could just click on this and I
[59:13] could watch this and I could do that,
[59:15] you know. But you but yet but yet
[59:17] society society has come to the point
[59:19] where they're full
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; but they're full of that they're full of
[59:23] just they're full of just nonsense of
[59:26] the world. I'm going steal a phrase from
[59:27] brother William there. Amen. It's just
[59:29] full of nonsense of this world. They're
[59:31] full of entertainment. Amen. They're
[59:33] full of the ideas of what they think
[59:34] church should be. They're full of ideas
[59:36] of They're full of uh ideas of of how
[59:39] the the world should be and how
[59:41] everybody else should be except what God
[59:43] has called them to be. All right.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; It says, "The woman said unto her, sir,
[59:47] give me this water
[59:50] that I thirst not."
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Neither come hither to draw. Jesus said
[59:56] unto her, "Go call thy husband and come
[59:59] hither." And the woman answered and said
[1:00:00] unto her, "I have no husband." Jesus
[1:00:02] said unto her, "Thou hast well said, I
[1:00:05] have no husband, for thou hast had five
[1:00:07] husbands, and he whom thou now hast is
[1:00:09] not thy husband, and thou hast said
[1:00:12] truly."
[1:00:13] The woman said unto him, "Sir, I
[1:00:16] perceive."
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Now look at this woman's perception.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; I perceive
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our
[1:00:27] father worshiped in this mountain. Now
[1:00:29] think about this. Now think about this.
[1:00:33] Even though that she was a harlot woman,
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; even though that she was in sin, even
[1:00:37] though she had been buried and and the
[1:00:39] world tried to bury her underneath all
[1:00:41] these kinds of things, but yet the word
[1:00:43] was coming up through all that muck
[1:00:46] where the word was coming up through all
[1:00:48] that trash cuz listen to she says uh uh
[1:00:53] for our fathers worshiped into this
[1:00:54] mount and said unto him that in
[1:00:56] Jerusalem in this place where men ought
[1:00:58] to worship, Jesus said unto her,"Woman
[1:01:02] believeth me. The hour has come when ye
[1:01:05] shall neither in this mountain nor ye
[1:01:07] yet at Jerusalem worship the father. Ye
[1:01:09] worship ye know not what we know that we
[1:01:13] worship for salvation is of the Jews.
[1:01:16] But the hour is come and now is when the
[1:01:19] true worshipper shall worship the father
[1:01:21] in spirit and in truth. For the father
[1:01:24] seeketh such to worship him. God is the
[1:01:26] spirit and they that worship him must
[1:01:29] worship him in spirit and in truth. Now
[1:01:31] listen. The woman said unto him, I know
[1:01:33] the Messiah cometh, which is called
[1:01:36] Christ, when he has come, he will tell
[1:01:38] us these things. Jesus said unto her
[1:01:41] that I speak or that I that speak unto
[1:01:45] thee am he. Now listen, as she began to
[1:01:48] identify, Amen. who he was by the word,
[1:01:53] by what he was, by what he was giving
[1:01:55] her. Now think about that. The Sadducees
[1:01:57] couldn't figure that out. Now listen to
[1:01:59] me, church. You can sit here and be a
[1:02:00] message believer all that you want to.
[1:02:02] You can wear your pin. Amen. You can you
[1:02:04] can put your things on the chat. You can
[1:02:06] do whatever do whatever you think to
[1:02:08] make you feel like a me message
[1:02:10] believer. But if you don't recognize the
[1:02:12] presence of God within your mis, amen, I
[1:02:15] put a question mark upon your faith.
[1:02:18] Amen. And if you can come into a service
[1:02:20] and you can sit and and and the word of
[1:02:22] God not move you, the preaching of the
[1:02:24] word, amen, can come by like it's done
[1:02:26] the past several the the past several
[1:02:28] services and even beyond that. Amen. And
[1:02:30] you could sit there and you can
[1:02:32] question, Amen. And you can and you can
[1:02:34] let the God's presence pass right by
[1:02:36] you, right by your pew, right when the
[1:02:38] songs are sung. And you can sit there
[1:02:40] and say, "Well, I got this job to do, or
[1:02:42] I need to be I need to be out doing
[1:02:44] this, or oh, you know, I got this thing
[1:02:46] uh conjuring up in the back." And you
[1:02:48] become so distracted by the word word.
[1:02:50] Amen. You're missing the presence of God
[1:02:53] in your day at this time
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; because we know that the presence of God
[1:02:58] is being put in a word body. And that
[1:03:00] body is here on the earth today.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's sitting right here in these
[1:03:05] pews. It's sitting right here behind the
[1:03:07] pulpit. Every time your pastor gets up
[1:03:09] to preach, every time your song leader
[1:03:11] gets up and leads worship, every time
[1:03:13] that every time your youth leader calls
[1:03:15] for calls for a a youth night and be
[1:03:18] able to come and surround yourself
[1:03:20] around the world, what's wrong with the
[1:03:22] word, Amen, of God? It's because what
[1:03:24] happens is it doesn't attract you no
[1:03:26] more.
[1:03:28] Come on.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; I like how brother Brandham, he goes and
[1:03:31] he talks about how about how that he was
[1:03:33] visiting a a woman, how that he was
[1:03:35] visiting a woman there uh and she was in
[1:03:37] a store somewhere and and she and there
[1:03:39] was and she had this baby and all of a
[1:03:41] sudden he was he was in the store and
[1:03:43] all of a sudden the baby began to cry
[1:03:44] out and or no the the the wife the woman
[1:03:47] began to cry out and she she began to
[1:03:50] cry and he runs up to her and he's like
[1:03:51] what's wrong with him? What's wrong? And
[1:03:53] she said, "You know what? The doctor
[1:03:54] said that he was okay. the the the
[1:03:57] doctor said that there that that that my
[1:03:59] baby my baby was going to be okay. He's
[1:04:01] like, "But I I take I've taken every toy
[1:04:03] inside of this store and I'm shaking it
[1:04:05] in front of him and I and I and I'm
[1:04:07] shaking these toy and there's nothing
[1:04:09] there." Amen. to to for the baby to to
[1:04:11] be able to respond to the toy, you know,
[1:04:14] and and you know what, brother Brandon
[1:04:15] goes back and he says, and that's
[1:04:17] exactly what has happened to the church
[1:04:18] today that they have waved every single
[1:04:22] blessing, every single fraction of the
[1:04:25] word in front of the in front of the
[1:04:26] church and she can't recognize it. Amen.
[1:04:29] And we don't fall too and we don't fall
[1:04:31] too short away from that even in our own
[1:04:33] services, even in our own congregation
[1:04:36] that when the word is preached over the
[1:04:38] pullpit and we can just walk by, amen,
[1:04:40] and walk out and we can still have ill
[1:04:42] feelings against your brother, still
[1:04:44] have ill feelings against your sister,
[1:04:46] still be able to walk out in defeat.
[1:04:48] That is your fault because the word has
[1:04:50] come to set the captive free. The word
[1:04:52] has come to be able to destroy the bonds
[1:04:55] of the enemy. You have to take the sword
[1:04:57] of the word and you got to do it for
[1:04:59] your life.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; But we got to get down to business and
[1:05:05] stop recognizing the things of the
[1:05:06] world.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; There's two classes of people in this
[1:05:10] world. And there's those that don't
[1:05:11] recognize God and then there's those
[1:05:13] that do recognize God. You know, the
[1:05:16] woman of the whale was of that class of
[1:05:17] that can recognize God.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And I begin to go back and I begin to
[1:05:22] look at another person that was there,
[1:05:24] Gyrus. Now, Gyrus was a spiritual
[1:05:26] leader, you know. He was a he he was a
[1:05:29] priest, the scripture says. And behold,
[1:05:31] there came one of the rulers of the
[1:05:32] synagogue, Gyrus by name. And when he
[1:05:34] saw him, he fell at his feet.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And besought him greatly, saying, "My
[1:05:40] little daughter lith at the point of
[1:05:41] death. I pray thee, come and lay thy
[1:05:43] hands on her, and she shall be healed,
[1:05:45] and she shall live." Now, he had spent
[1:05:48] all this time with him and all his
[1:05:49] buddies. Amen. trying to disprove
[1:05:52] trying to disprove that that was the ge
[1:05:54] that that Jesus was the son of God.
[1:05:56] Trying to put him into a situation to
[1:05:58] where he would be able I mean they would
[1:06:00] be able to corner him and try to put him
[1:06:01] to death. But when the rubber met the
[1:06:03] road
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; all right
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; when the rubber met the road Gyrus knew
[1:06:07] that there was only one place that he
[1:06:09] could go for healing. Gyrus knew that
[1:06:11] there was only one place that he could
[1:06:12] go because he had seen the works that
[1:06:14] Jesus had done.
[1:06:16] How many times do we see the works that
[1:06:19] Jesus has done? Not I'm not talking
[1:06:21] about brother Brandham's time. I'm
[1:06:22] talking about right here in Pony,
[1:06:24] Oklahoma. I'm talking about right here
[1:06:26] through our lives through through other
[1:06:28] people's lives. Amen. Things that have
[1:06:30] been done, the prayer requests that we
[1:06:32] put right here behind this pullpit. And
[1:06:34] it go out across this across our small
[1:06:37] community that's right here. And the
[1:06:38] sick are healed. People are brought
[1:06:40] back. marriages are restored right here
[1:06:43] because the word is being manifest to a
[1:06:46] group of people right here in Pawne,
[1:06:48] Oklahoma. And if we're not careful, we
[1:06:49] miss the presence of God when it comes
[1:06:51] right here amongst our midst.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; It's just as real as when the prophet uh
[1:06:56] when the prophet William Brandon was was
[1:06:59] coming when he came down and he swept
[1:07:01] this nation, amen, with the word of God
[1:07:03] and signs and miracles. I'm not no
[1:07:05] prophet, but God said that I will be
[1:07:07] able to do greater works. Amen. And more
[1:07:09] works that that could that could be done
[1:07:11] through the preaching of this word and
[1:07:13] the word that's being put out right here
[1:07:15] today.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; The woman of issue of blood recognized
[1:07:20] who he was and a desperation began to
[1:07:23] come place began to take place because
[1:07:25] she began to see what was going on.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the situation
[1:07:30] you're going through in life. I'm not
[1:07:32] talking about the issues in your body.
[1:07:34] I'm not talking about the offense that
[1:07:36] you might have between brother and
[1:07:38] sister. I'm not talking about I'm not
[1:07:40] talking about uh uh the the things that
[1:07:42] issues that you got going on tomorrow at
[1:07:44] work. I'm not talking about all those
[1:07:46] things that are going on. We're talking
[1:07:47] about the one thing, Jesus. Okay? We're
[1:07:50] talking about the one thing, the one
[1:07:52] need maker that we have in our our need
[1:07:55] meter that we have in our life. The one
[1:07:56] that puts a roof over your head. The one
[1:07:58] that puts bread on your table. The one
[1:08:00] that puts rubbers on your or the one
[1:08:02] that put rubbers on on your rims to be
[1:08:04] so you can drive back and forth to work.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; This lady with the issue of blood, she
[1:08:09] had s sought physicians for 12 years.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; 12 years. Men couldn't get it done. 12
[1:08:17] years. She spent all of her money. She
[1:08:18] spent all of her life savings. She she
[1:08:21] had done all these different things and
[1:08:22] and but she had come to a point in her
[1:08:24] life where she was so desperate. Right
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; now, back in those days when you had
[1:08:29] issues of blood, you were considered
[1:08:31] unclean and you had to be able to you
[1:08:33] had to stay away from the people. You
[1:08:35] had to stay away from the congregation.
[1:08:37] You had to stay away. She was labeled as
[1:08:39] an outcast kind of like a leper was.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; She was like, "Oh, that person, you
[1:08:43] know, stay away from the they're
[1:08:44] unclean." Now, Israel did these things
[1:08:46] because there was it was kind of the
[1:08:47] hygiene kind of a thing, you know, that
[1:08:49] you're kind of kind trying trying to
[1:08:50] keep the spread of disease and trying to
[1:08:52] keep those things away, you know, but
[1:08:54] but yet she had to forget what everybody
[1:08:57] else around her thought.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; We've got to forget what our friends
[1:09:04] think.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; We got to forget what our wife is, what
[1:09:08] our wife thinks. We got to forget our
[1:09:10] social standing in the community. We got
[1:09:13] to forget all these other thing, all
[1:09:15] these things that all these things that
[1:09:16] might try to hinder us or keep us.
[1:09:19] Another place that we can look at is the
[1:09:21] pride of life. Try to keep us away from
[1:09:23] his presence because you know in his
[1:09:25] presence it causes you to do things that
[1:09:27] aren't necessarily for formal in church.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; When has God ever been formal?
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't formal when he come down and
[1:09:37] he saved you from the pit of sin that
[1:09:38] you were living in. God wasn't formal
[1:09:41] when he had come down and he reached
[1:09:42] down and saved your family. God wasn't
[1:09:44] formal when he came down in there and
[1:09:46] kept you from a car wreck.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; But you decided, you know what? I'm
[1:09:51] tired of being formal.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of just uh just doing what man
[1:09:57] says that I need to do. I got to get to
[1:10:00] that healer.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; I got to get to that one. Amen. And she
[1:10:05] said within herself that if I could only
[1:10:07] touch the hymn of his garment.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And here this evening, if we could say
[1:10:12] within ourselves, you know what, God, if
[1:10:13] I can just grasp the word that you have
[1:10:16] for my life,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; we don't have a literal Jesus walking
[1:10:20] around and amongst us. But we do in the
[1:10:23] form of his word. It's right here. It
[1:10:25] sits It sits on your coffee table. It
[1:10:27] sits on your table. It rolls around in
[1:10:29] your truck. And it mean it it sits on
[1:10:32] your It sits on your desk. I mean, the
[1:10:34] message is on your phone. It sits right
[1:10:36] there. The very one that you're looking
[1:10:37] for stands there every day of your life.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; But do we recognize the presence of God
[1:10:43] in our midst? Are we too worried about
[1:10:46] all our social the things that are going
[1:10:48] on in this in this world? God, when he
[1:10:50] came, he came and he destroyed the very
[1:10:53] form of religion for the Jews. if you
[1:10:55] destroy. He went in there. He went in
[1:10:57] there with whips and he and he'd went in
[1:10:59] there and he threw over the money
[1:11:00] changers and he throw let God come in
[1:11:02] here this evening and throw over all
[1:11:04] formality and throw throw out all types
[1:11:07] of all types of as all types of uh of
[1:11:10] things that would keep us away from his
[1:11:12] presence. God hasn't come to hasn't come
[1:11:15] for hasn't saved a church just so it can
[1:11:17] become formal and dead and he can come
[1:11:19] back and raise it again. Well, when he
[1:11:21] saved a church and he gave him the
[1:11:23] unadulterated word was for a group of
[1:11:25] people to be able to take it and let
[1:11:27] that seed be able to manifest itself so
[1:11:29] he could be walking meth Messiah again.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Is when you recognize
[1:11:35] your day and its message is a sign,
[1:11:38] amen, that you are a son of God.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; When you heard Jesus came in, she
[1:11:48] pressed in behind him. Now remember, she
[1:11:52] wasn't allowed to be there. She was
[1:11:54] worried about what what was what was
[1:11:57] what was going to happen if she did it.
[1:11:59] But you know what? She didn't care.
[1:12:04] She didn't care.
[1:12:06] She didn't care what the priests
[1:12:08] thought. She didn't care what the
[1:12:11] preachers thought. She didn't care what
[1:12:13] the disciples were going to think of
[1:12:14] her. She didn't care about all these
[1:12:16] things because you know what? She had
[1:12:18] dealt with an issue for 12 years.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Satan lets you deal
[1:12:24] with things for year after year after
[1:12:27] year after year. And you know what? He's
[1:12:30] going to, you know, God's going to let
[1:12:32] him, Amen, get you to the point where
[1:12:34] you have to come to Jesus. That all of a
[1:12:37] sudden that you're going to come to a
[1:12:38] point in your life where you realize
[1:12:40] that, you know, I got to have Jesus or
[1:12:42] nothing. I got to have Jesus more than
[1:12:44] money. I got to have Jesus more than
[1:12:46] cars. I got to have Jesus more than
[1:12:47] clothes. I got to have Jesus more than I
[1:12:49] mean the next deer rifle. I got to have
[1:12:51] Jesus more than anything because without
[1:12:53] him I'm dead.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And this lady had come to the point in
[1:12:57] her life that she realized without Jesus
[1:12:59] I'm going to die. But if I could just
[1:13:01] touch the hem of his garment, you know,
[1:13:03] and by with that little bit of faith,
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; remember we talked about seeds, mustard
[1:13:08] seed.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; With that little bit of faith. For she
[1:13:12] said, "If I may but touch, if I may
[1:13:15] touch but his clothes, I shall be made
[1:13:18] whole."
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, just a little bit,
[1:13:22] littlest touch
[1:13:25] from Jesus makes everything o makes
[1:13:28] everything okay. Some of you men know
[1:13:30] what I'm talking about. Some of you
[1:13:31] women know what I'm talking about. You
[1:13:33] have a hard day.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; You have a hard day at work. You have a
[1:13:36] hard day at home. You know, I you know,
[1:13:38] I sometimes I come home and you know, my
[1:13:41] wife, she's just gives me that look. I'm
[1:13:43] like, long day, you know, and the kids
[1:13:47] are all screaming. They're all running
[1:13:48] around, chasing each other, pulling each
[1:13:50] other's hair, jumping off this, and the
[1:13:52] two older ones are yelling at this one
[1:13:54] and smacking on this one, and this is
[1:13:56] all going on and they're, you know, I
[1:13:57] haven't got to the point where I just
[1:13:58] walk in and wash dishes and stuff like
[1:14:00] that. I'm still working on those kinds
[1:14:02] of things, you know, myself. I haven't
[1:14:04] got to that point yet, but but some you
[1:14:05] know, some of you know what I'm talking
[1:14:07] about. And all of a sudden, we get to
[1:14:08] that point where we're like, "Church,
[1:14:11] really?"
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; The one place that you can find God's
[1:14:16] presence.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; The one place that you know you can go,
[1:14:21] you can go somewhere and somebody loves
[1:14:23] you unconditionally.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; So, a one place that you can come into
[1:14:28] and you can say, "God," because you know
[1:14:29] God ain't going to tell your secrets.
[1:14:32] You know that God's going to sit there
[1:14:33] and stand up for you. That he's going to
[1:14:35] forgive you every time that you fall.
[1:14:37] That he that he that that you can come
[1:14:39] you could bring your children to when
[1:14:41] you don't know what's wrong. But yet God
[1:14:42] can go in and he can be the mortar in
[1:14:44] between your walls and he can he could
[1:14:46] stack things back together where he
[1:14:48] where it's at where you where we can go
[1:14:50] to one place. Let me tell you, you can
[1:14:51] go to one place and receive one touch
[1:14:53] from him.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all things will be made whole.
[1:14:56] I got to get moving.
[1:15:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; He says, "And his disciples said unto
[1:15:09] him, thou seeest the multitude through
[1:15:10] things, and sayest, thou, who touched
[1:15:13] me?" And he looked around about to see
[1:15:15] her that had done this thing. But the
[1:15:17] woman, fearing and trembling, knowing
[1:15:19] what she had done in her, came and fell
[1:15:21] down before him, and told him all the
[1:15:23] truth. And he said unto her, "Daughter,"
[1:15:27] he didn't say, "you're touched." Yeah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Oh, because you barrel
[1:15:33] through all these things." He says, "Thy
[1:15:35] faith
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; hath made thee whole. Go in peace."
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Faith in what? Faith in who?
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Faith that, oh, if I if I can just get
[1:15:47] through and only touch. But yeah, in a
[1:15:49] sense. But then faith that she knew that
[1:15:51] that was the son of God.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That that was the King of Kings. That
[1:15:55] that was the very one that that would be
[1:15:57] able to come. Amen. was going to come
[1:15:59] and save and save Israel.
[1:16:02] Another one that I like to bring up in
[1:16:04] reference is Luke 7:36. Now, this one's
[1:16:06] my favorite.
[1:16:11] And it says, "And one of the Pharisees
[1:16:13] desired that he would eat with him.
[1:16:17] And he went to the Pharisees out, and he
[1:16:19] sat down to meet. And behold, a woman in
[1:16:22] the city which was a sinner
[1:16:28] When she knew that Jesus sat at the meet
[1:16:30] in the Pharisees house,
[1:16:33] brought him an alabaster box of
[1:16:35] ointment.
[1:16:38] Now think about this.
[1:16:41] Jesus is sitting
[1:16:44] with a who's of who's of ministers.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; He's sitting with He's sitting with the
[1:16:52] top men
[1:16:54] and they brought Jesus for sport.
[1:16:57] They did.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; They brought him so they could come and
[1:17:01] they could specifically set Jesus off to
[1:17:04] the side somewhere and poke fun at him
[1:17:11] and not give Jesus recognition for who
[1:17:15] he was.
[1:17:19] even in so much that they left Jesus
[1:17:24] dirty,
[1:17:28] filthy.
[1:17:30] Now, we all sit here, every one of us
[1:17:32] would sit right here in this building
[1:17:33] here this evening and would be like, we
[1:17:35] would never do such a thing. Would you?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Would you?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Would you wash Jesus's feet? Would you
[1:17:47] recognize him as your savior
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; if he was to come into your misks and
[1:17:52] come into your midst?
[1:17:56] Would we would we recognize would we
[1:17:58] recognize God as as supreme or would we
[1:18:02] just do we just have Jesus as a figment
[1:18:05] of imagination, as a sport, as just
[1:18:09] something to do?
[1:18:12] something that we can all rally around
[1:18:14] and say and be like, "Oh, this is just
[1:18:16] what we do here, you know, this is just
[1:18:18] what we do on Wednesdays. This is just
[1:18:20] what we do on Sundays, you know, or or
[1:18:22] or or do we put him or have we brought
[1:18:25] him for worship?"
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Have we have we come to worship God's
[1:18:31] presence?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; The religious leaders of the time didn't
[1:18:37] recognize who he was, but there was a
[1:18:39] harlot woman
[1:18:42] There was an ill-famed woman, someone
[1:18:44] that wasn't worthy to come and be in his
[1:18:47] presence that brought an alabaster box
[1:18:50] of ointment. You know, I like how
[1:18:51] brother Random says that she probably
[1:18:53] had used the money used the money. She
[1:18:56] had used the money from her all of her
[1:18:59] ill-fame work that she had done to buy
[1:19:01] this special ointment to consolidate
[1:19:04] everything that she had done throughout
[1:19:06] her life for this one moment in her life
[1:19:11] because she realized that she had come
[1:19:13] to a point in her life that that she had
[1:19:16] no way out. that she had realized that
[1:19:19] she had come to a point in her life
[1:19:20] where she had that that she couldn't be
[1:19:23] forgiven from the Pharisees. Because you
[1:19:26] go down and you look in the scriptures.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:33] It says, "And she stood at his feet
[1:19:36] behind him weeping
[1:19:39] and began to wash his feet with tears
[1:19:43] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:19:45] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[1:19:47] them with ointment. Now when the
[1:19:49] Pharisees which had bidden him saw him,
[1:19:52] he spake within himself." Now the
[1:19:54] Pharisees
[1:19:56] which had bidden him
[1:19:59] saw it. He spake within himself saying,
[1:20:02] "This man, if he were a prophet, would
[1:20:04] have known who for who and what manner
[1:20:08] of woman this is, and touched him, for
[1:20:11] she is a sinner."
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered, said unto him,
[1:20:17] Simon,
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; remember she's he's saying this within
[1:20:20] himself.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he says,"Simon,
[1:20:24] I have somewhat to say unto thee." And
[1:20:27] he said, "Master, say on." There was a
[1:20:30] certain creditor which had two debt
[1:20:31] debtors, and one owed him 500 p, and the
[1:20:34] other 50, and when they had nothing to
[1:20:36] pay, frankly, he forgave them both. Tell
[1:20:38] me which which of them will love him
[1:20:40] most. Simon answered said, "I suppose
[1:20:43] that he to whom he forgave most." And he
[1:20:45] said unto him, "Thou has righteously
[1:20:48] judged." Yeah.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:20:51] Simon, "Seeest thou this woman?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; This woman.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God."
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; I hope tonight that God's like, "Seeest
[1:21:01] thou new life outreach.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Seeest thou this woman? I have entered
[1:21:13] into thy house."
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:16] Christ
[1:21:18] all amongst Pony, Oklahoma right now in
[1:21:20] every church.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Being woripped
[1:21:26] through through entertainment
[1:21:30] through through through
[1:21:33] all kinds of boards and and all kinds of
[1:21:36] just nonsense that goes on in church in
[1:21:39] the church world that we lived in that
[1:21:41] we live in. being sat in his own house
[1:21:43] being invited amongst the people that
[1:21:45] say that he love it. Sitting in a church
[1:21:48] this evening with dirty feet.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Let's not that be said about New Life
[1:21:55] Outreach here this evening.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Seeest thou this woman, this
[1:22:01] bride, this church,
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I have entered into thy house that thou
[1:22:06] hast gave me no water for my feet.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But she has washed my feet with
[1:22:12] tears, and she has wiped them with her
[1:22:15] head. That has gave me no kiss. But this
[1:22:19] woman, since the time that I came, it
[1:22:21] hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head
[1:22:24] wilt with oil, thou does not anoint.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; But this woman hath anointed my feet
[1:22:30] with ointment. Wherefore I say unto
[1:22:32] thee, her sins which are many are
[1:22:33] forgiven. For she loved much, but to
[1:22:37] whom little is forgiven, the same loveth
[1:22:40] little. And he say unto her, thy sins
[1:22:42] are forgiven. And they sat at meat with
[1:22:44] him, began to say within themselves, who
[1:22:47] is he to forgive sins also?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Do we not serve the same Jesus of the
[1:22:57] Old Testament, of the New?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Do we not serve him? Is he not just as
[1:23:02] real as as he as he was
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; 60s something years ago in the 60s as he
[1:23:07] is here today?
[1:23:11] And he said unto the woman, "Thy faith
[1:23:12] has saved thee. Go in peace. Thy faith
[1:23:16] has saved thee. Thy faith in recognizing
[1:23:19] who he was for that day." Amen.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And I say I say to you to every one of
[1:23:25] you that can recognize that the Christ
[1:23:27] that is walking in your day right now in
[1:23:31] 2025 is nothing else but the embodied
[1:23:36] word being being manifest right here
[1:23:38] amongst every one of us here. Amen. The
[1:23:41] word that's being displayed every elder
[1:23:43] that gives advice every time a sermon
[1:23:45] that's preached over the that's preached
[1:23:47] over the pullpit every time. Amen. you
[1:23:50] your deacons, your youth leaders, Amen.
[1:23:52] Amen. Your brothers or your sisters,
[1:23:54] Amen. identify themselves with the word.
[1:23:57] It's Jesus speaking to you again.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; But do we recognize it? Or are we just
[1:24:05] so caught up in what's going on out here
[1:24:07] in the world today? Are we missing what
[1:24:10] God is doing just right now within these
[1:24:12] past couple of weeks? The wave of God
[1:24:14] beginning to move right through our
[1:24:16] services and the wave of God beginning
[1:24:18] to come. And if we're not careful, we
[1:24:20] miss the presence of God. Do not be too
[1:24:23] prideful. Do not Amen. Just surrender
[1:24:26] all the things that are going on in your
[1:24:28] life today and recognize the presence of
[1:24:31] God in your midst.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Like here a quote where it says
[1:24:38] in the me message recognizing your day
[1:24:40] in its message. Now we've talked about
[1:24:44] Jesus's day. But what about brother
[1:24:47] Brandham's day?
[1:24:49] Think about it. I like the parallels.
[1:24:54] Jesus himself comes. I'm going close it.
[1:24:57] Close it down here. Jesus himself's
[1:25:00] come.
[1:25:02] They couldn't pin him on his words.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; They couldn't pin him on the works that
[1:25:07] he was doing. So yet they called him
[1:25:10] Beelbub.
[1:25:12] The reason that he does all these things
[1:25:13] is because he's the father of devils.
[1:25:17] But yet they couldn't recogn But yet
[1:25:19] they couldn't recognize the word that
[1:25:22] was in their day fulfilling what he was
[1:25:24] doing. He's like, "If you can't believe
[1:25:25] me for the word's sake, believe me for
[1:25:27] my work's sake."
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And they did the same thing
[1:25:32] when the prophet came here in our day
[1:25:35] and the word was being manifested and
[1:25:37] the word was being explained and the
[1:25:39] word was being open. That's a fortune
[1:25:41] teller.
[1:25:43] Oh, he's oh, he's just reading minds or
[1:25:46] or he's mental telepathy or he's doing
[1:25:49] this or he's doing that. But what it was
[1:25:52] was it was the word again being shown to
[1:25:54] people.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And it was up to a people to be able to
[1:25:58] grasp what God was doing in their time
[1:26:02] by the word,
[1:26:05] the word that was being preached and be
[1:26:07] able to connect the two the two dots.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now we're not part of the group
[1:26:13] that was oh that oh this is a fortune
[1:26:15] teller or oh this is a soothsayer or oh
[1:26:18] this is this or oh this is that but now
[1:26:19] we've gone on down the road and now
[1:26:21] we're sitting here and we're part of the
[1:26:23] group we're part of the group that's
[1:26:25] believing God's word. Amen. We're part
[1:26:27] of that group that sits back and say
[1:26:29] where can I go for thou has the words of
[1:26:32] eternal life. Amen. Where can I go?
[1:26:35] Amen. I can't I can't fall to the
[1:26:37] Baptist. I can't fall to the Methodist.
[1:26:39] I can't fall to the Pentecostal. I can't
[1:26:41] fall back uh to to daddy's belief. I
[1:26:43] can't fall back to mama's belief. Amen.
[1:26:46] What is it that is keeping you? It's the
[1:26:48] word. And it's the word, Amen. that's
[1:26:50] being anchored in your heart that is
[1:26:52] taking place and it's moving you to a
[1:26:54] rapture.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; It's a people that have recognized where
[1:26:58] they're at in scriptures.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; They've recognized that, hey, I'm in a
[1:27:02] Leodysa. I'm in a leadyan age, but I'm
[1:27:05] not of Leoa, but yet I'm a I'm part of
[1:27:08] God's bride. And I'm being called out.
[1:27:10] And I noticed these women that he had
[1:27:12] called out. The woman at the well, the
[1:27:14] lady with the alabaster box, the woman
[1:27:16] with the issue of blood. But yet it was
[1:27:17] all these women that had issues. Amen.
[1:27:20] And this bride, Amen. these womens that
[1:27:24] had issues. Amen. And they it was by
[1:27:26] their faith. It was their faith that God
[1:27:29] says, "Your faith has made you whole. By
[1:27:31] your faith, you had done this." Faith in
[1:27:34] what? and faith in who he was for his or
[1:27:36] for faith in what he was fulfilling for
[1:27:39] that time. And it's this woman, it's the
[1:27:41] bride Jesus Christ with the faith, amen,
[1:27:44] that she believes that his eternal word
[1:27:46] has been fulfilled in our hour to
[1:27:49] manifest the body of Jesus Christ right
[1:27:52] here. Amen. Here in Pawne, Oklahoma,
[1:27:55] your brother just ain't just a normal
[1:27:57] brother. Amen. That's Mr. Jesus Christ.
[1:27:59] Your sister just ain't a sister, but
[1:28:01] that's Mrs. Jesus Christ. Amen. walking
[1:28:04] here on earth. Why is it? It's because
[1:28:06] she is part of the word and the word is
[1:28:08] part of her.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; You could sit here and you could look at
[1:28:12] everybody's mistakes.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; But you know, there's a lot of people
[1:28:17] that were looking at Jesus's mistakes.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; What they thought was mistakes.
[1:28:26] and they're sitting here and they're
[1:28:27] like,
[1:28:30] "We've been we've been we've been
[1:28:32] selling sheep
[1:28:35] at the temple for years."
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:39] We've been,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; you know, we've been we've been doing
[1:28:42] we, you know, we've been exchanging
[1:28:44] money and we've been buying incense and
[1:28:46] we've been doing all these things for
[1:28:48] years and all of a sudden Jesus walks
[1:28:49] out with his plate of whips and he just
[1:28:50] starts whipping everybody out of the
[1:28:52] temple and they're like, "Who is this
[1:28:54] guy that's come to, you know, to do all
[1:28:55] these certain things?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Who is this Jesus?
[1:29:04] Who is this Jesus here this evening that
[1:29:07] has come to set the captive free?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Me. Yeah. You. You. Every one of us in
[1:29:17] this underneath this covering of this
[1:29:19] building here this evening. Every one of
[1:29:21] us that are in the covering of God's
[1:29:22] word. You set the captive free. How do
[1:29:25] you set the captive free? By the life of
[1:29:27] the word that's being lived inside of
[1:29:29] you. What's it doing? and it's drawing
[1:29:31] out the seeds that are out there that
[1:29:33] are in the world. It's because their
[1:29:35] desire is for something solid. Their
[1:29:38] desire is for something real. Amen. They
[1:29:41] see church after church. They see
[1:29:42] religion. They see they see good deeds.
[1:29:45] I mean I mean anybody can have good
[1:29:47] deeds. It doesn't matter if you give to
[1:29:48] the poor. It doesn't matter if you give
[1:29:50] somebody a code. It doesn't matter if
[1:29:52] you do you could just be poor. Amen. You
[1:29:54] can live the life of God. Amen. But
[1:29:56] somebody can feel the fervor. Amen. that
[1:29:59] you know where you stand and you stand
[1:30:02] on this word. It draws the world.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It draws the world.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; I say there is a Jesus walking on earth.
[1:30:19] I'm looking at it.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Looking at it right here.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Recognize his presence as the musicians
[1:30:26] come.
[1:30:33] And the church used to used to stood on
[1:30:36] the rock of Jesus Christ. No matter what
[1:30:39] anybody said, they stayed right with the
[1:30:42] word, the message of the hourward,
[1:30:44] Luther, Wesley, and down through there.
[1:30:48] And now they've turned back to
[1:30:49] traditions.
[1:30:51] Why has it done it? The past 25 years,
[1:30:54] Israel has recognized that it's in its
[1:30:56] homeland for something. It was
[1:30:59] prophesied. They'd have to be gathered
[1:31:01] again. Hosea said, "So, we read it a
[1:31:04] while ago. God, help us understand it."
[1:31:06] All right. At the same time,
[1:31:10] this is the beautiful part of this.
[1:31:14] It says, "At the same time, the bride
[1:31:16] has recognized the evening light.
[1:31:22] That's beautiful.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; We've recognized it.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, we have.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to put a little damper on
[1:31:32] whatever whatever you're thinking or
[1:31:33] whatever you got going on, but the bride
[1:31:36] has recognized it.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; You've recognized that you know what?
[1:31:42] There's something a little different
[1:31:43] about William Mary and Brandon's message
[1:31:46] than Joel Olstein. Yeah,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; there's something different about it
[1:31:53] that I could take what's on tape and I
[1:31:56] could read it right here in the
[1:31:57] scripture
[1:32:00] and I could put these two ingredients
[1:32:02] together and things happen.
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; She all of a sudden she's beginning to
[1:32:09] recognize what's taking place. And I
[1:32:12] believe you have recognized it. I'm not
[1:32:15] saying anybody here hasn't.
[1:32:17] Just digging at you a little bit.
[1:32:21] Just take it.
[1:32:23] Digging at you a little bit.
[1:32:26] But we have recognized it.
[1:32:29] We have recognize this message. But what
[1:32:32] are have we done with it?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Have we left his presence unrecognized?
[1:32:39] Because we got all this stuff going on.
[1:32:42] We got all these things going on. Put
[1:32:45] your sicknesses down. Put your put your
[1:32:47] put your things that you're going
[1:32:49] through through at home down. I mean,
[1:32:51] put your financial situations gone down.
[1:32:53] Put put all these other things down.
[1:32:57] Jesus is sitting amongst us with dirty
[1:32:59] feet.
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:03] The one that you claim died on the cross
[1:33:05] for your sins. The one that you claim
[1:33:08] that rose rose again and came and rose
[1:33:12] from the grave and is going to gone to
[1:33:13] build you a kingdom.
[1:33:17] sits right here amongst us.
[1:33:23] It says this
[1:33:26] and the bride has recognized the evening
[1:33:28] light.
[1:33:30] Just begin to recognize
[1:33:33] the hungry Pentecostals have began to
[1:33:35] recognize that them organizations hasn't
[1:33:38] got it. They haven't got the things that
[1:33:40] they were looking for. They're so
[1:33:42] twisted up. See,
[1:33:45] it's the time of recognition.
[1:33:49] You've got to recognize it. The world
[1:33:53] has recognized.
[1:33:54] The nations have recognized.
[1:33:57] Science has recognized.
[1:34:00] The devil has recognized. See all the
[1:34:03] recognizing that's been going on around.
[1:34:07] But have we recognized it?
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Are we just another church?
[1:34:15] Is Brother Windle just another pastor?
[1:34:18] Are these just regular musicians?
[1:34:21] Is this just a regular word that that
[1:34:23] could just be preached by anybody
[1:34:25] anytime, anywhere? And if it isn't if it
[1:34:27] isn't preached the way that I think it
[1:34:29] should be preached or or if it isn't
[1:34:31] preached with with some flowers and some
[1:34:33] light shows that are going on, I'm not
[1:34:34] attracted to it. What are you attracted
[1:34:37] to?
[1:34:39] What are we recognizing?
[1:34:41] We can't look through. We can't look at
[1:34:43] God through our own filter. We can't
[1:34:46] look at God from from a a theological
[1:34:48] standpoint. He didn't come to theology.
[1:34:50] He was born in a stable.
[1:34:54] Man didn't even have a house to go to.
[1:35:04] The devil has recognized it. It's the
[1:35:08] time that he can wreck women.
[1:35:11] he could wreck the church. And we're
[1:35:13] talking about the devil.
[1:35:15] We're talking about that he's recognized
[1:35:17] that this is his time. That this is the
[1:35:20] time that he's he's he's let everything
[1:35:22] loose.
[1:35:24] He's aiming everything that he can at at
[1:35:27] the church. He's aiming everything that
[1:35:28] he can. He realized that he has this
[1:35:30] moment in time
[1:35:34] that he's wrecked the church, that he's
[1:35:36] wrecked the people. He's recognized it.
[1:35:40] And God has recognized that there is a
[1:35:43] people on earth
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:48] that he predestinated to life.
[1:35:52] A group of people that sits right in
[1:35:55] front of me that God has for ordained
[1:35:57] before this world. Amen. To come against
[1:36:00] the enemy.
[1:36:03] a group of people that God has for
[1:36:05] ordained before this earth that when
[1:36:08] this world
[1:36:10] leaves your king,
[1:36:12] leaves your savior with dirty feet and
[1:36:16] they scoff at the way that he he asks
[1:36:18] you women to live your lives and they
[1:36:21] scoff at the way that he asked you men
[1:36:23] to live your life and they scoff at when
[1:36:26] at you when you say that by his stripes
[1:36:28] I am healed. They laugh at it. They
[1:36:31] laugh at They laugh at you when you say,
[1:36:33] "You know what? It doesn't matter how
[1:36:35] far they are lost about it in drugs.
[1:36:37] I've claimed them in the name of Jesus."
[1:36:39] And there's no word. There's no bond.
[1:36:41] There's no hammer. There's no sword.
[1:36:43] There's no nothing. A man can sever the
[1:36:46] word of God that I've sinned after my
[1:36:48] family. They laugh at it. But God says,
[1:36:50] "I've got a group of people."
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:37:14] be broke 90% of your life.
[1:37:18] Yeah. You might not drive a nice car.
[1:37:21] You might not have the nicest things.
[1:37:22] You might not have this. But you've got
[1:37:24] peace.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; But you have peace in your soul
[1:37:34] that you know when that day comes
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; that you followed his word.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; You recognized the voice that came in
[1:37:44] your day. It tore your families.

[1:38:27] The world has recognized the nations
[1:38:29] have recognized science the devil
[1:38:32] they've all recognized and God has
[1:38:34] recognized that there's a people on
[1:38:36] earth that he's predestinated to life.
[1:38:38] He recognized that that this is the time
[1:38:41] to send his message.
[1:38:45] Listen to that. He recognized this is
[1:38:48] the time to send his message. He did it.
[1:38:52] The people have recognized it. The bride
[1:38:56] time has realized the evening light.
[1:39:01] He recognized that. You know what? It's
[1:39:04] time now to send my message because
[1:39:07] there's a people
[1:39:10] that'll worship me.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; There's a people that realize that I'm
[1:39:17] in their midst.
[1:39:20] There's a people that realize that my
[1:39:22] words just aren't coming out of a man
[1:39:24] behind of a pulpit. They realize that
[1:39:27] this shell that's just right here, Amen.
[1:39:30] this body that he lives in, but it's the
[1:39:32] words that he's speaking.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; It's the gift that I've given him to be
[1:39:37] able to to be able to speak the word.
[1:39:42] He has I bet if he had enough faith to
[1:39:45] send this message, if he had enough
[1:39:47] faith to send this message in the time
[1:39:48] that you live in right here, right now,
[1:39:51] Amen. then you would have recognized
[1:39:52] Jesus when he was on earth because there
[1:39:55] was something within you. Amen. That

[1:40:01] walking amongst you at that time,
[1:40:02] recognize his word coming that has come
[1:40:05] right here where you live. You live at
[1:40:07] an epoch of time. Amen. That God himself
[1:40:11] will look back and say, "Amen. I
[1:40:13] predestinated this bride to see." Amen.
[1:40:16] Miguel was there. Tina was there. Amen.
[1:40:19] Brianna was there. Amen. All these
[1:40:21] different ones, they were there. And you
[1:40:23] can rewrite. You'll be able to write
[1:40:25] this story in heaven one day.

[1:40:32] there.

[1:40:36] the eyes that have not seen
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:40] than the eyes that have. Someone's about
[1:40:42] to put me back together there.
[1:40:46] But blessed are your eyes. You didn't
[1:40:47] get to see the miracles that were done
[1:40:49] in William Brandon's day. But you took
[1:40:52] the same word that he believed that had
[1:40:54] the same power to make it happen.
[1:40:58] Amen.

[1:41:14] devil will hand you to miss church.
[1:41:16] Don't take you at any at any opportunity
[1:41:18] that the devil will give you to miss any
[1:41:20] time that you can gather around his word
[1:41:23] because that's where God will be. That's
[1:41:25] where God makes himself manifest. I
[1:41:28] don't know about I don't know about this
[1:41:30] this this age of people that were coming
[1:41:32] through, but there were people saved at
[1:41:33] our Bible studies. There were people
[1:41:35] that were filled with the baptism of the
[1:41:37] Holy Ghost at our Bible studies. Amen.
[1:41:39] There were there were people in our
[1:41:40] churches, Amen, that were laid out in
[1:41:43] front of this. It still happens. And I'm
[1:41:44] a witness of it. And I will declare it
[1:41:47] to the day I the day I die because the
[1:41:49] word is living. And it's just as real
[1:41:51] was when I was a kid. And it's real
[1:41:53] right here, here this evening to save
[1:41:55] your children.

[1:42:03] and make deacons and make singers and

[1:56:54] attraction
[1:56:57] for me.
[1:56:59] Oh Jesus,
[1:57:03] for the dear
[1:57:06] lamb of God

[1:57:52] I will cling

[1:58:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:18] I want to
[1:58:22] give everything
[1:58:24] that I am to him
[1:58:27] and all of the honor and love that he
[1:58:30] deserves.
[1:58:34] And I think that the message tonight was
[1:58:36] very fitting.
[1:58:39] Believe the Lord was here tonight to
[1:58:41] speak to us.
[1:58:45] This is a very special night.
[1:58:48] You can be seated for a few minutes.
[1:58:51] You can turn those that AC up a bit if
[1:58:57] if it's a little cold.
[1:59:02] I had uh talked with brother
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:09] Bosow for a little while. I guess up
[1:59:12] close to I don't know a couple hours
[1:59:14] yesterday we
[1:59:16] had fellowship and
[1:59:20] and I got to say it done my heart really
[1:59:24] really good as brother Bosow was
[1:59:29] sharing with me
[1:59:32] his heart and
[1:59:34] what God has been doing for him
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:41] and his surrender to the Lord. And
[1:59:45] as he was talking about surrender and
[1:59:49] total surrender and
[1:59:56] wanting to be baptized and live for the
[1:59:58] Lord.
[2:00:01] And I I'm just
[2:00:05] beyond happy, brother Bosco,
[2:00:08] to see that decision
[2:00:11] and to see what the Lord has just been
[2:00:14] doing. It's just been a miracle because
[2:00:16] God's just been
[2:00:21] doing an incredible work.
[2:00:24] Brother Patrick's going to get baptized
[2:00:26] tonight.
[2:00:28] and the work that God's been doing in
[2:00:32] Patrick's life.
[2:00:36] And I I I'm just I'm so thankful. And as
[2:00:42] we
[2:00:46] look here and
[2:00:48] through the sorrow,
[2:00:50] the pain of losing a daughter,
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] taken way too early.
[2:01:02] And today is the anniversary. Today is
[2:01:05] it's been one year today since Alba was
[2:01:08] killed.
[2:01:14] And I know the man. I remember the man
[2:01:16] that Bosow once was.
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:20] And
[2:01:22] but the Bosow that I talked to yesterday
[2:01:24] says I
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:32] In order for me to move with Jesus,
[2:01:37] I've got to forgive.
[2:01:42] I want to forgive
[2:01:45] that man and those people involved.
[2:01:52] and he said, "Do you think it's
[2:01:54] appropriate for me to get baptized
[2:01:55] tomorrow
[2:01:57] or to get baptized?" And I said, "Well,
[2:02:00] why don't we do it tomorrow?" And
[2:02:03] he said, "I would love that."
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:08] I say, "God richly, richly bless him."
[2:02:11] So, we're fixing to have a a wonderful
[2:02:14] baptism here tonight.
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:19] And I want to read up a couple of
[2:02:21] scriptures here.
[2:02:26] Acts 2
[2:02:28] and 37.
[2:02:30] This is the commission.
[2:02:33] Jesus had just or Peter had just
[2:02:36] preached the sermon
[2:02:38] on the day of Pentecost.
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:43] telling them that this is scripture
[2:02:44] being fulfilled.
[2:02:46] [Music]
[2:02:48] And it says, "Now when they heard this,
[2:02:51] they the people that were hearing, they
[2:02:53] were pricricked in their hearts and said
[2:02:55] unto Peter and to the rest of the
[2:02:57] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[2:03:00] we do?"
[2:03:02] Then Peter said unto them,"Repent,
[2:03:06] be baptized, every one of you, in the
[2:03:09] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:03:12] of sins,
[2:03:13] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:03:15] Holy Ghost.
[2:03:17] For the Holy Ghost or for the promises
[2:03:19] unto you and to your children and to all
[2:03:22] that are a far off, even as many as the
[2:03:26] Lord our God
[2:03:28] shall call." And with many other words
[2:03:31] did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save
[2:03:33] yourself from this on tour generation."
[2:03:36] Then they were they that gladly received
[2:03:39] his word were baptized.
[2:03:42] And the same day there were added unto
[2:03:44] them about 3,000 souls.
[2:03:48] So the commission is to be baptized in
[2:03:51] the name of Jesus.
[2:03:54] Now Jesus there in Romans the 6th
[2:03:59] chapter
[2:04:02] and the third verse
[2:04:04] or let's just start at the first verse.
[2:04:06] What shall we say then? Shall we
[2:04:08] continue in sin that grace may abound?
[2:04:13] God forbid.
[2:04:15] How shall we that are dead to sin live
[2:04:18] any longer therein?
[2:04:21] Know you not that so many of us as were
[2:04:24] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[2:04:27] into his death?
[2:04:29] Therefore we are buried with him by
[2:04:32] baptism into death.
[2:04:34] That like as Christ was raised from the
[2:04:37] dead by the glory of the Father, even so
[2:04:41] we should walk in the newness of life.
[2:04:46] For if we have been planted together in
[2:04:48] the likeness of his death, we shall also
[2:04:51] in the likeness of his resurrection.
[2:04:54] Knowing this, that our old man, the old
[2:04:58] sinner,
[2:05:00] the man of sin, our old man who's
[2:05:02] crucified with him, Christ,
[2:05:05] that the body of sin might be destroyed,
[2:05:08] and henceforth we should not serve sin.
[2:05:12] He that is dead is free from sin. Now,
[2:05:15] if we be dead with Christ, we believe we
[2:05:17] shall also live with him, knowing that
[2:05:20] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[2:05:23] no more. Death hath no more dominion
[2:05:25] over him. For in that he died, he died
[2:05:29] unto sin once,
[2:05:32] but in that he lives, he lives unto God.
[2:05:39] Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[2:05:41] dead indeed to sin, but alive
[2:05:45] unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2:05:48] Let not sin therefore reign in your
[2:05:50] mortal bodies that you should obey it in
[2:05:53] the lust thereof, neither yield your
[2:05:55] your uh members as instruments of
[2:05:58] unrighteousness unto sin.
[2:06:01] But now you yield yourselves unto God as
[2:06:04] those that are alive from the dead, that
[2:06:07] your members are instruments of
[2:06:09] righteousness unto God.
[2:06:13] So Jesus died,
[2:06:16] Jesus was buried,
[2:06:19] and then Jesus rose from the dead.
[2:06:23] He died for our sins.
[2:06:26] He went to the grave for our sins. And
[2:06:29] while he was in his spirit went down to
[2:06:32] hell, carried all of our sins, carried
[2:06:35] all of our sins to hell.
[2:06:40] But then God was so pleased with the
[2:06:42] sacrifice of Jesus
[2:06:45] that he raised him from the dead and
[2:06:48] brought him back up to life. God was so
[2:06:52] satisfied with that sacrifice.
[2:06:58] When we go in this watery grave here
[2:07:00] tonight,
[2:07:03] when we go in that watery grave, we are
[2:07:06] saying, "I am dying. I've died to sin.
[2:07:08] I've repented.
[2:07:10] I'm going down in this watery grave. I'm
[2:07:12] going to leave my sins
[2:07:15] in that water.
[2:07:17] I'm going to leave everything behind.
[2:07:20] And I'm going to rise up as a new
[2:07:22] creature. I'm going to rise to serve the
[2:07:25] Lord.
[2:07:27] I've died to my sins and just as Jesus
[2:07:30] died for my sins, I am now. Now, there's
[2:07:33] nothing that this water can do to save
[2:07:35] you. There's nothing that this water can
[2:07:37] do to to make you uh
[2:07:41] uh
[2:07:45] there's there's there's no saving power
[2:07:46] in this water, but it's just an
[2:07:50] accepting of the blood of Jesus and
[2:07:52] recognizing that it was Jesus Christ who
[2:07:54] died, that was buried, and that raised.
[2:07:57] And we too are going into a watery grave
[2:08:00] and rising up, leaving our sins behind.
[2:08:03] Amen.
[2:08:05] So, as we get ready now for this for
[2:08:08] this baptismal and I you know I was so

[2:09:18] baptistry there.
[2:09:24] There is a blood
[2:09:28] that cost
[2:09:30] [Music]
[2:09:32] that paid my way.
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:36] Though death is price
[2:09:41] when it flowed
[2:09:45] down from the cross,
[2:09:49] my sins were gone.
[2:09:53] My sins forgot.
[2:09:58] There is a grave
[2:10:02] I try to hide.
[2:10:06] This precious blood

[2:12:03] to make me whole.

[2:13:48] Nothing but the blood.
[2:13:52] Oh, nothing but the blood.
[2:13:57] So I come
[2:14:00] to tell you he's alive
[2:14:05] to tell you that he tries
[2:14:10] every tear and b.
[2:14:15] Oh, I come
[2:14:18] to tell you that he saves,
[2:14:23] to shout, and to proclaim
[2:14:27] that he's coming back for you.
[2:14:32] [Music]
[2:14:34] Father, I see that you are drawn
[2:14:39] a lot in the sand.

[2:15:52] this move this back just a little bit so
[2:15:53] I don't I don't want to splash no water
[2:15:55] on it.
[2:15:57] Uh
[2:16:00] we uh this is this is something we've
[2:16:03] been praying for for a long time,
[2:16:05] Brother Michael. And I thought this I
[2:16:08] thought this was fitting for brother
[2:16:09] Michael to to to minister here tonight,
[2:16:12] too.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; And u and it's just it's been a prayer
[2:16:16] that that all of us have have been
[2:16:19] praying and and we're we're just we're
[2:16:23] just we're so thankful. I have talked
[2:16:26] with uh brother Kayla, brother, brother
[2:16:30] Patrick
[2:16:32] about salvation and the and the
[2:16:34] realities of of serving the Lord and
[2:16:37] himself to the Lord.
[2:16:39] And I have I there has been a deep
[2:16:42] sincerity in in Patrick
[2:16:46] and what God is doing in Patrick's life
[2:16:48] is maybe maybe a lot of you don't know
[2:16:53] exactly how good God has been to brother
[2:16:55] Patrick.
[2:16:57] But I'm telling you, God is doing an
[2:16:59] incredible
[2:17:01] uh work of grace.
[2:17:04] And I know the Lord is going to continue
[2:17:07] And as as you as you just walk with God
[2:17:10] in humility,
[2:17:12] serve the Lord, I know that God will be
[2:17:15] there with you. Now, the the water is
[2:17:20] really warm. And so, this is like a
[2:17:23] jacuzzi water. Amen.
[2:17:27] But it's but it is better than cold. And
[2:17:30] uh my hand's already shriveling up here.
[2:17:33] But uh so Patrick, why don't you come
[2:17:37] right over here and then
[2:17:42] just put your toes up just about right
[2:17:45] there like that. And I you hang on to my
[2:17:50] hands and then
[2:17:54] I have to take a deep breath.
[2:18:06] bring back
[2:18:12] Patrick
[2:18:14] upon the confession of your sins,
[2:18:18] obedience of your faith.
[2:18:20] As I have talked to you and we have
[2:18:24] discussed at length throughout these
[2:18:29] of of what God requires of us.
[2:18:33] And I' I've seen a real willingness in
[2:18:35] your heart to want to please the Lord.
[2:18:40] I believe with all of my heart that if
[2:18:43] you continue to walk with God, God will
[2:18:45] continue to perform miracles.
[2:18:49] God will fill you with the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:52] He'll make a you'll make us a a great
[2:18:56] warrior of of the faith.
[2:19:00] So, Patrick, I now baptize you in the
[2:19:03] name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:19:13] [Applause]
[2:19:16] Happy day.
[2:19:20] Oh, happy day.
[2:19:23] Hallelujah.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; When Jesus walks
[2:19:29] when Jesus walks.
[2:19:33] When Jesus walks
[2:19:38] all my sins away. Oh happy day.
[2:19:45] Oh happy day. Oh happy day.
[2:19:52] Oh happy day
[2:19:54] [Music]
[2:19:56] when Jesus walks.
[2:20:00] Oh when Jesus walks.
[2:20:05] Oh when Jesus walks
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:10] all my sins away. Oh happy day.
[2:20:15] [Music]
[2:20:16] Oh, happy day.
[2:20:22] I I can't tell you.
[2:20:26] I
[2:20:30] can't tell you what this here means to
[2:20:31] me.
[2:20:35] What God is doing in Brother Bosow's
[2:20:37] life,
[2:20:39] I believe this is just the beginning
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; of what God is doing.
[2:20:46] And I I say, "Brother Bos,
[2:20:51] when God does something, he does it
[2:20:53] right."
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; When he forgives our sins and he puts
[2:20:58] them under the sea of forgetfulness, it
[2:21:00] is totally gone.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; And God's grace is with us.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; We are pure and righteous because it's
[2:21:10] his blood, not our ability, but it's his
[2:21:12] ability.
[2:21:14] And I believe we have the right to
[2:21:16] believe as we baptize our brother.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; I would love to see the Lord just when
[2:21:21] he comes up, the Lord just fill him with
[2:21:23] the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; I would love to see that.
[2:21:28] [Applause]
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for that. Now, Brother
[2:21:34] Bosow, I want to have you to turn around
[2:21:37] and if you you bring your uh there close
[2:21:40] like that. That's right.
[2:21:44] I I've I've known him we we've known
[2:21:46] each other a long time. I guess 30 30
[2:21:50] years. 30 plus
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; two years.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; 32 years.
[2:21:57] And we never thought we'd be in the same
[2:21:59] room together, let alone in the same
[2:22:01] baptistry together.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Never thought we'd ever hug each.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; I told him on Father's Day as we hug
[2:22:11] each other's necks really tightly, I
[2:22:13] said, "Who would have ever thought?"
[2:22:15] Amen. But God has been so good.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; I I've been so happy to welcome Brother
[2:22:22] Bosow in into the into our our church
[2:22:25] family.
[2:22:27] You can take that just like that. Then
[2:22:30] I'll have you take a deep breath here.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Well, Bos, as you have been
[2:22:37] as you reflected your heart to me
[2:22:39] yesterday about your desires, surrender
[2:22:45] that you have really made a commitment
[2:22:47] to the Lord.
[2:22:49] I don't think there's a more appropriate
[2:22:51] thing to do than to be baptized in his
[2:22:54] name as he died for your sins and he
[2:22:57] rose for your sins and he took all of
[2:23:00] your sins and laid them down at the
[2:23:02] hell. You are now accepting what God has
[2:23:06] already done. This doesn't make you a
[2:23:08] member of any church. This here is
[2:23:12] identifying the work that Christ has
[2:23:15] done for you. And we are all witnesses
[2:23:18] of that these last few months. What God
[2:23:20] is
[2:23:22] upon the confession of your sins, the
[2:23:25] obedience of your faith,
[2:23:28] Bos, I now baptize you in the name of
[2:23:31] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:23:37] [Applause]
[2:23:44] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:23:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:23:50] Hallelujah.
[2:23:51] Glory to God.
[2:23:54] Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. It's
[2:23:58] wonderful.
[2:24:03] [Music]
[2:24:09] All my sins away. Oh happy day.
[2:24:14] [Applause]
[2:24:15] Oh happy. He taught me how
[2:24:21] [Music]
[2:24:23] to walk.
[2:24:27] Fight and pray.
[2:24:30] Oh, fight and pray
[2:24:33] [Music]
[2:24:34] and live. Rejoice
[2:24:38] [Music]
[2:24:44] every day.
[2:24:48] every day.
[2:24:52] Happy day.
[2:24:54] [Music]
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, my sins away. Oh,
[2:25:16] happy day.
[2:25:18] [Music]
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Now, is there anyone else that would
[2:25:22] want to be baptized? We've got nice warm
[2:25:26] water.
[2:25:28] Man,
[2:25:34] I believe God's been looking forward to
[2:25:36] this day.
[2:25:42] He rejoices when a sinner comes home.
[2:25:48] Oh, it I'm just so thankful for God's
[2:25:51] grace.
[2:25:54] Isn't God just wonderful?
[2:25:56] I love him so much.
[2:25:59] As brother Michael was preaching, I
[2:26:01] identified
[2:26:04] and I told Brother Bosow, I said, "You
[2:26:06] identified with him. You you knew he was
[2:26:09] here."
[2:26:10] He told me Sunday, he said, "I don't
[2:26:12] know what's been happening." He says,
[2:26:13] "But something's changing me.
[2:26:17] Something's happening in me.
[2:26:20] [Music]
[2:26:21] It's God.
[2:26:23] It's God working."
[2:26:26] Hallelujah.
[2:26:28] I told him, I said, "A seed was planted
[2:26:30] into the ground and flowers are coming
[2:26:32] up. God has taken what Satan meant for
[2:26:36] evil and is bringing a whole new crop
[2:26:39] up. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:26:45] [Music]
[2:26:46] So I'll cherish
[2:26:50] the old.
[2:26:51] [Music]
[2:26:57] Oh,
[2:26:58] till my
[2:27:03] last
[2:27:06] we lay down.
[2:27:10] Hallelujah.
[2:27:11] [Music]
[2:27:11] [Applause]
[2:27:12] [Music]
[2:27:14] to the old
[2:27:17] [Music]
[2:27:25] change
[2:27:29] for
[2:27:30] the crown.
[2:27:33] So I'll cherish
