[36:39] seated for a few moments I just want to
[36:41] greet you if it's okay and I enjoyed
[36:45] that song brother Wendell I I threw that
[36:47] on
[36:51] him I I I thought about that song My
[36:54] Aunt Tracy sitting back here I I don't
[36:56] mean to tell this publicly you might get
[36:57] jealous but she gave me a song book it's
[37:00] a Henson song book and it it was signed
[37:02] by Kenny Henson and several of the other
[37:05] Henson and uh and I opened that book and
[37:08] I saw that song in there and I thought
[37:09] of brother wendle if anybody can sing it
[37:12] brother Wendell can you know that's a
[37:14] Kenny might have died but the voice
[37:15] didn't
[37:17] leave and so I I I love to hear your
[37:20] pastor sing and over at our meetings he
[37:23] preaches you know once or twice or
[37:25] whatever however often he preaches there
[37:27] but he sings sings every night you know
[37:28] two or three times a night so we we wear
[37:30] him out on singing he probably he
[37:32] probably sings for more hours than he
[37:34] does preaches over there but but we we
[37:36] love brother Wendell are do you love
[37:38] your pastor love your
[37:43] pastor he's meant a lot to me personally
[37:47] he told you this morning I come out of a
[37:49] a tape background where we didn't
[37:50] believe in Ministry we would go here I'd
[37:52] go hear ministers I went and he heard
[37:53] brother Wendell that's how I got to know
[37:55] him but we didn't really believe
[37:58] in ministers that we didn't believe the
[37:59] importance of the fivefold and uh
[38:03] brother Wendell you know he he treated
[38:05] me like I was his buddy even though I
[38:07] didn't like
[38:09] preachers and I I'll say this your
[38:12] pastor has a heart of gold for people he
[38:14] loves people and I I don't know that
[38:17] I've ever felt that from anybody like I
[38:18] have from Brother Wendell and part of
[38:20] the reason I would say I'm standing here
[38:21] tonight I know it's all God's grace but
[38:24] but he puts men in your life that that
[38:26] really influence you
[38:28] and that's what brother wendles meant
[38:29] and I I'll say this I don't see my wife
[38:31] in here she's probably in the nursery
[38:33] but uh you know we've we've had a lot of
[38:36] experiences here at this church in this
[38:38] building that don't make the building
[38:39] special but but it's a special place for
[38:41] us my wife was here at your meetings in
[38:44] September and uh brother Jonathan had
[38:47] preached that night and he preached uh
[38:49] on once more I believe is the name of
[38:51] the title sermon sermon that night and
[38:54] and at the end of the service that
[38:55] wasn't prayer line night but my wife
[38:57] walked up up she had been diagnosed with
[38:58] Alpha gal I don't know if you know what
[39:00] that is but it's a it's a tick bite and
[39:03] and she and she'd got it in her blood
[39:04] and she just broke out all over just red
[39:07] spots all over her body and when she
[39:09] would eat certain things uh and they
[39:11] told her that they diagnosed her with
[39:12] that and said you can't eat pork you
[39:13] can't eat beef anything that's got a
[39:16] hoof you can't eat it and so you know I
[39:20] we didn't we just kind of accepted it we
[39:22] didn't know what to do and so we come to
[39:24] the meetings that was about the
[39:26] beginning of August we come to the
[39:27] meetings and and that night when she
[39:29] come up uh she said I she said I just I
[39:34] I want my healing and she stood right
[39:37] there and she she left the building that
[39:39] night and went a pulled pork probably
[39:41] some of yours she went and ate that
[39:44] pulled pork that night she said I'm
[39:45] claiming my healing she said I don't I'm
[39:47] I don't care what the doctor said she
[39:49] ate the pulled pork no
[39:55] reaction she's ate
[39:58] she from then on she hasn't had any
[40:00] restrictions and has had no
[40:03] outbreaks not one not One
[40:07] symptom we serve a great big God he
[40:10] still does
[40:11] Miracles I tell you you say well how do
[40:13] you know because I I've seen it work in
[40:15] my family right here in this church I
[40:18] tell you you serve a big God don't ever

[40:30] py
[40:31] Oklahoma you may look like a small group
[40:34] here but you're mighty in the power of
[40:37] God and and and so tonight I want to
[40:39] just say I appreciate brother Wendell in
[40:40] this opportunity I told him I didn't
[40:42] want to preach but I'd just as well hear
[40:45] him as anybody I know and so I I
[40:48] appreciate brother Wendell and but I but
[40:50] I do I I do take this very seriously I
[40:53] don't want to stand here and and take up
[40:55] all your time but I just wanted to say
[40:56] those things I felt like I I want to
[40:59] encourage you that's all I know to do
[41:01] and I love every one of you you've been
[41:03] you've been a blessing to me and and
[41:05] your meetings have just been have just
[41:07] been wonderful the meetings have been
[41:09] wonderful we had children we had uh uh
[41:11] two for sure that left your camp
[41:13] meetings that have been filled with the
[41:15] Holy Ghost and uh and they have changed
[41:19] it wasn't just the camp meeting
[41:20] experience but we've watched their lives
[41:22] at home and these are young people who
[41:24] they'd sit as far back as they could
[41:26] that they didn't want to participate in
[41:27] church they didn't even they didn't act
[41:29] like they wanted to be there but from
[41:31] from that time to now they're on the
[41:33] front row they're participating in
[41:36] church when you're preaching to them
[41:38] they're right there with you I tell you
[41:41] God's still God and God don't never
[41:43] change I believe it do you amen I I
[41:46] don't want to take up all your time
[41:47] tonight I appreciate my family for
[41:49] putting up with me and having me over
[41:51] and let's stand if we could for just a
[41:52] few moments and and that'll be all the
[41:54] singing I'm not going to sing tonight we
[41:56] already heard the best singer and I'm
[41:57] not going behind that so I uh I tell you
[42:02] what with Talent like that I'd never
[42:05] preach again I'd just
[42:07] sing but uh but I I I thank the Lord for
[42:11] every one of you if you if you have your
[42:12] Bibles just before we before I have you
[42:14] seated again can we do Revelations chap
[42:17] 22 and verse 17 just one verse there
[42:19] Revelations 22 and 17 very familiar
[42:23] verse
[42:24] there and if I could title this sermon
[42:26] to tonight I would I call it the spoken
[42:28] word authority and hope it's a blessing
[42:32] to you uh chapter 22: 17 Revelations it
[42:36] says and the spirit and the bride say
[42:38] come and let him that heareth say come
[42:42] and let him that is The Thirst come and
[42:44] whosoever will let him take of the Water
[42:47] of Life freely and then if you could
[42:49] turn over to Mark 11 and verse 21 Mark
[42:53] 11 and
[42:54] 21 when you have it just say Amen I like
[42:57] to see your Bibles out even with the
[42:58] screens up that's that's
[43:00] nice Mark 11 and verse
[43:05] 21 and Peter calling to remembrance
[43:07] saith unto him Master behold the Fig
[43:09] Tree which thou cursed is withered away
[43:11] and Jesus answered answering saith unto
[43:14] them have faith in God for verily I say
[43:17] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[43:20] this mountain be thou removed and be
[43:22] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[43:25] doubt on his heart but Shall Believe
[43:27] that those things which he saith shall
[43:28] come to pass he shall have whatever he
[43:32] saith and may the Lord add His blessings
[43:34] to the word you could be
[43:35] seated I was just thinking on this
[43:38] thought a couple weeks ago back home and
[43:40] and it kind of come back to me today I I
[43:42] thought I I I thought you know we we
[43:44] we're not such a powerful people and I
[43:46] heard brother Wendell say we're a
[43:47] powerful church this morning we are so
[43:49] powerful but the power does not come
[43:51] from us ourselves it is it is not a
[43:53] fleshly power I think Samson experienced
[43:55] that Samson realized that the power had
[43:57] to come from somewhere else it wasn't it
[43:59] wasn't just in his own strength he
[44:01] thought well we can get rid of the locks
[44:03] and I can still defeat these Philistines
[44:04] no no what he had was a supernatural
[44:07] power and he could only have that power
[44:09] under the authority of the word and once
[44:12] he got outside of the word the power was
[44:14] gone and the authority is gone I'd like
[44:16] to say tonight you are a powerful people
[44:18] you are you are a people of authority
[44:20] but you lose that Authority when you're
[44:22] outside of the word of God so brother
[44:25] Brandon would say like this brother
[44:26] Brandon said as mortal being knowing
[44:28] that I have no power within myself well
[44:31] come on that's a prophet speaking now he
[44:32] said I have no power within myself I
[44:35] don't have power to stop you I don't
[44:36] have power to make any of these women
[44:38] excuse me women clean up and any of
[44:40] these men that's listening to this tape
[44:41] or wherever I have no way of making them
[44:43] clean up I'm powerless but I do have the
[44:46] authority of God's word as a servant to
[44:49] preach it and I'm Duty bound to that
[44:52] Authority and the preachers ought to say
[44:53] Amen it doesn't matter what what your
[44:56] opinion is or what you think but what
[44:58] the word of God says we are Duty bound
[45:00] to preach that word it doesn't matter
[45:02] you say Well it made somebody mad well
[45:04] we don't want to make anybody mad we
[45:05] don't want to run anybody off you know
[45:07] you want to you want to use wisdom when
[45:08] you can but but I'll say this if it's in
[45:10] the word of God we need to be a people
[45:12] that understands that the minister is
[45:14] standing there and he is Duty bound
[45:16] under the authority of God to say thus
[45:18] sayith the Lord you say well well the
[45:20] brother brandom had thus say no no you
[45:22] have thus sayth the Lord if you're
[45:24] saying what the word says see we we
[45:26] don't go off of thus sayith the lord
[45:28] well I I feel like this or or this could
[45:30] be right no that's not thus sayith the
[45:31] Lord thus sayith the Lord is what he's
[45:33] already said in his word I can stand
[45:36] here and I can read this word to you I
[45:38] can I I can let you hear the word of God
[45:40] for our day and a minister can stand
[45:42] here under the anointing of God and you
[45:43] can say that's thus sayith the Lord
[45:45] because because he's saying what a
[45:47] prophet said it's a Vindicated word from
[45:50] a Vindicated prophet and so therefore
[45:52] that is thus sayith the Lord that is the
[45:55] voice of God to you you say well well
[45:57] God can't use that man well God could
[45:59] use a donkey God can use whoever he
[46:00] wants to if it's the word of God it
[46:03] doesn't matter the source it comes from
[46:05] the word of God is thus sayith the Lord
[46:08] and that is the voice of God to
[46:10] you it is not just on tape it is not
[46:14] just well come on somebody it's not just
[46:16] on tape but it is in the mouth of the
[46:18] bride and we will say what he said and
[46:20] we will do what he said to do and that
[46:23] is the voice of God today I'm not taking
[46:26] any anything away from a prophet I
[46:28] believe in a prophet I listen to a
[46:30] prophet I think we need to be listening
[46:32] to a prophet but that's not just where
[46:34] the voice of God is today it is in the
[46:36] bride because it says the spirit and the
[46:39] bride would say come listen that means
[46:41] you have a voice you have a voice I have
[46:45] a voice he didn't leave it all with one
[46:46] man because well I'll get there in a
[46:48] little bit I'm way ahead of myself but
[46:50] listen he has he has got a people in the
[46:52] land today who have a Voice come on
[46:55] somebody you have a voice voice the
[46:57] voice of God is in you you have ate the
[47:00] bookl you are an overcomer you are the
[47:04] bride well come on somebody if you are
[47:07] the bride then you have full authority
[47:10] of the spoken
[47:11] word you don't have to worry about what
[47:14] so and so says or what this group would
[47:16] say no it doesn't matter about their
[47:18] opinion it matters what the word of God
[47:21] has already said because if we or any
[47:24] another anybody else or an angel from
[47:26] Heaven would stand here and say
[47:28] something outside of the word let him be
[47:30] accursed but if we can say what a
[47:32] prophet said and do what a prophet said
[47:35] and just believe what he said and act on
[47:37] that word put it in action tonight and
[47:39] say I have the authority to cast out
[47:42] Devils I have the authority to walk on
[47:44] devils in my life let me tell you
[47:46] something that devil is trying to give
[47:47] you a complex that devil is trying to
[47:50] tell you you're not good enough cast
[47:51] that devil down you have the authority
[47:54] to cast out Devils you have the
[47:56] authority to walk on the heads of
[47:57] serpent what is it it's the devil that's
[47:59] trying to put those thoughts that you're
[48:01] not good enough and it's and your
[48:03] children can't be saved or it's too late
[48:05] well I've heard all those doctrines in
[48:06] my life but I'll tell you I heard a
[48:08] prophet say thy and thy house shall be
[48:11] saved and I've heard Ministers of the
[48:13] Gospel get under the anointing and
[48:15] preach what a prophet said and say in
[48:17] due season they're going to come back
[48:18] home well come on somebody this is an
[48:21] hour of restoration this is an hour when
[48:24] all things are coming back home I say if
[48:26] you're children are gone they're going
[48:27] to come back well where are they it
[48:30] don't matter how long it takes it don't
[48:32] matter how they come back but whatever
[48:34] means God would use they're coming back
[48:37] home I tell you you say well well we've
[48:39] got people in the church that have
[48:40] gotten cold well just lift them up in
[48:42] prayer and keep the word of God in the
[48:44] ppit and I'm telling you you'll see a
[48:46] church on fire again you'll see a church
[48:48] with Revival back in the I'll tell you
[48:51] what what we need is Revival but it's
[48:53] not something new let's revive what we
[48:55] already have that's what a prophet would
[48:57] call Revival a prophet would say take
[49:00] what you've got and revive that we don't
[49:02] need new gifts in the church well come
[49:04] on somebody we don't need a new preacher
[49:06] you don't need a new pastor what you
[49:08] need is to lift up your pastor pray for
[49:11] your pastor get behind the man and well
[49:14] come on somebody you've got a man of God
[49:17] that stands here and preaches the
[49:19] Vindicated word of God I say get behind
[49:21] him with all you've got and stand there
[49:24] at your post of Duty well come on now
[49:26] now you can you can sit there and get
[49:28] quiet on me but I'm going to preach to
[49:30] you for a minute this man of God was put
[49:32] here for a purpose and if you're sitting
[49:34] here you were put there for a purpose
[49:37] well come on now fulfill your purpose by
[49:40] being at your post you want to be under
[49:43] Authority be under the word of God and
[49:46] then you've got full Authority but when
[49:48] you get out of your position You've Lost
[49:51] Your
[49:52] Authority Moses had full authority to
[49:55] speak to the Rock he chose to Smite it
[49:58] and it kept him out of the promised land
[50:00] now brother Brandon would say Moses had
[50:02] had he said Moses was told to speak
[50:04] don't Smite it he said that meant speak
[50:07] see he said stay under your Authority
[50:09] you've got to obey what he says do but
[50:12] no man can do nothing in himself he's
[50:14] got to hear it first from God now where
[50:16] do you hear the word of God you can hear
[50:18] it from the tapes you can hear it you
[50:20] can read it in the word in the Bible
[50:22] it's a written word and there's a spoken
[50:23] word and there's another way to hear it
[50:26] that's coming to church and hearing your
[50:27] pastor here in the five-fold ministry
[50:29] bring the word forth and if they're
[50:31] saying what the written word said and
[50:33] they're preaching what the spoken word
[50:35] said then you can say Amen to it well
[50:38] come on somebody I think we get so quiet
[50:41] sometimes because we're scared of the
[50:43] man standing in the Pulpit don't worry
[50:44] about who's standing there if God has
[50:46] placed them there they have been placed
[50:48] there to bring the word of God to you
[50:51] because that is the program of God
[50:54] today the program of God God is not sit
[50:57] at home and press
[50:59] play you say well did you come out of a
[51:01] tape church I'll tell you I did come out
[51:02] of one I'll tell you I've seen the false
[51:05] doctrine of a tape only movement you
[51:08] just go ahead and forgive me for a
[51:10] minute but I'm going to tell you this
[51:12] I've heard you say what do you listen to
[51:14] tapes I listen to more now than I did
[51:15] when I went to a tape
[51:17] church I do I have a I I have a deeper
[51:21] desire for him now it was a form of
[51:23] godliness but I denied the power and the
[51:26] author of it and then when I realized
[51:28] this was a powerful word that could
[51:30] still have men of God stand and preach
[51:33] it with authority I then I realized this
[51:36] is a powerful message it's not a dead
[51:40] message where we have to go sit for two
[51:42] or three hours and just all sit there at
[51:44] a certain
[51:45] time in a certain place and say well you
[51:49] know this this is good you know hey we
[51:51] were blessed today we heard the prophet
[51:53] that was the token well come on somebody
[51:56] it's another Catholic dogma it's another
[51:59] Creed that has been raised up in the
[52:00] message just like a seven Thunders
[52:02] opinion there's a true seven Thunders
[52:05] but it's what a prophet taught about it
[52:07] there's a true third pole but it's what
[52:09] a prophet taught about it well come on
[52:11] now there's a true T Vision but it is
[52:13] not what you're going to hear out here
[52:15] today about him coming back and
[52:17] preaching well we don't need more preach
[52:19] from a prophet he already came with the
[52:21] full restoration of the message of the
[52:24] hour what we need is to say what he said
[52:28] leave your opinions out of it and go
[52:30] forward with your authority of the
[52:32] spoken
[52:33] word that's where my authority comes
[52:35] from I can only say what he said I can
[52:38] only preach what he said I can't take my
[52:40] opinion or take one quote and say well I
[52:42] like this quote better than that quote
[52:44] if I've got two quotes that I feel
[52:46] contradict each other then I better
[52:47] leave them alone until the Revelation
[52:49] comes to me it's not a prophet's fault
[52:51] that I can't understand it maybe it just
[52:52] hasn't come to me yet but I'll say it
[52:54] like this don't throw out those quotes
[52:57] don't throw out the one you don't like
[52:59] because that might be the balance you
[53:00] need don't well I'm just preaching to
[53:02] you I'm off my notes at this point but I
[53:04] want to tell you something Church you
[53:05] get a little bit depressed and you let
[53:07] anxiety get in your life and you let
[53:09] where you let little isms and things
[53:11] come in your life and you start
[53:12] believing things and you know that you
[53:14] know really aren't right and you start
[53:16] doing things and acting ways that you
[53:18] know just aren't
[53:20] right well come on
[53:22] now listen we all get cold yeah but
[53:26] don't stay
[53:28] cold don't stay cold you you you're
[53:30] going to have a bad day but don't let
[53:32] the devil keep you in the valley let
[53:34] that Valley be the place of restoration
[53:37] let the valley be the place where you're
[53:39] back on your knees and say Lord I need
[53:41] you again I need more of you that's the
[53:44] way it's got to be I need your presence
[53:46] back in my life I lost my joy but just
[53:49] as David was saved restore unto me the
[53:51] joy of my salvation take me back to the
[53:54] house of God take me back to where I've
[53:56] left my love take me back to the message
[53:58] of the hour to where I've left god well
[54:00] come on somebody I I tell you what we
[54:02] can sit there and we cannot say amen and
[54:05] we can look like well we can look like a
[54:07] bum on a pickle but let me tell you this
[54:09] what we need is to get the fire of the
[54:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost back in our
[54:13] homes back in our churches where we can
[54:15] say Amen to the word of God where you
[54:18] can pull on the gift of God You' got
[54:20] well I hate to embarrassing tonight but
[54:22] you've got one of the most gifted
[54:24] Pastors in the whole message right here
[54:25] in py Oklahoma
[54:26] you've got a man under the authority of
[54:28] the word of God right here in py
[54:29] Oklahoma he has taken the spoken word
[54:32] and he's preaching it he's preaching it
[54:33] all over the world but you have been
[54:35] you've been blessed to have him as your
[54:37] pastor but let me just go ahead and tell
[54:38] you something he can't do this on his
[54:40] own he needs people come expecting a
[54:43] move of God in this
[54:45] service he needs you to show up when
[54:47] them doors are open and pull on the gift
[54:49] of God it's hard to preach to a church
[54:51] that sits there and say well we've heard
[54:53] that before if you've heard it a
[54:55] thousand times if it's it's true say
[54:57] Amen to
[55:00] it back your pastor you don't have to
[55:03] back me so much cuz I can I can leave
[55:05] tomorrow but your pastor has to come
[55:07] here it's a labor of love that he stands
[55:10] here week in and week out and studies
[55:13] and preaches and and and I tell you what
[55:15] you're blessed you're a blessed people
[55:18] you're blessed to have a pastor that
[55:20] believes this message is his
[55:23] absolute he didn't come along and say
[55:25] well this message is good but this is my
[55:28] opinion of it no
[55:29] sir he don't want that in his Pulpit
[55:32] what he wants in this Pulpit is the
[55:33] message of the hour preached what he
[55:36] wants in this Pulpit is is Words of Life
[55:38] to go out the congregation and he wants
[55:40] to see you responding to it not just by
[55:43] saying amen but by your life you live on
[55:46] Monday
[55:46] morning he wants well I'll tell you what
[55:49] if you want to reward your pastor start
[55:51] witnessing to the people in this town if
[55:53] you want to reward your pastor I tell
[55:55] you what get your home in order Jo when
[55:57] you walk in those doors you start you
[55:59] can just feel the presence of God and
[56:01] you start well when the singer gets up
[56:03] here you just can't sit down no more
[56:05] well come on somebody you might as well
[56:07] have church cuz I'm not going to quit
[56:09] for a few minutes
[56:11] anyway what we need to do is get back to
[56:14] where the word gives us Authority the
[56:17] word has given you authority to say
[56:20] amen he sure has I tell you what he said
[56:23] it's like it's like telling the dog it's
[56:25] it's it's like telling that devil he
[56:27] said he said I go told told that dog
[56:29] sick him and he said that dog would go
[56:31] over there and and and and get that
[56:32] skunk I believe it was was the dog
[56:34] getting a skunk or aoon anyway I think
[56:35] it was a skunk he was telling that dog
[56:37] to sick him and he said the devil's the
[56:39] biggest skunk we got I tell you what I
[56:41] say if your pastor's preaching I say
[56:44] tell him amen sick him get after that
[56:48] devil get after that devil don't let
[56:50] that devil come in here chop his head
[56:52] off well how can I do it you've been
[56:54] given the authority to do
[56:57] it you can defeat that devil
[57:00] Yourself by The Authority that God has
[57:03] already given you in his word let's get
[57:05] on down here Jesus had been given all
[57:08] power but he couldn't do anything in
[57:09] himself until the father told him first
[57:11] can you say amen he said he had I tell
[57:14] you he had the power to come off of that
[57:15] cross but under the authority of the
[57:17] word he had to stay there because he had
[57:19] to lay that body down and in 3 days
[57:22] raise it up again that was what the word
[57:24] said to do he was Duty bound
[57:26] to the authority of the word it was God
[57:30] revealing himself manifesting himself
[57:33] the word manifesting itself in a body
[57:37] well come on somebody I tell you and so
[57:39] Jesus would go on to say in Matthew 28
[57:42] Matthew 28:20 he was teaching them to
[57:44] observe all things whatsoever I
[57:46] commanded you and lo I Am With You
[57:48] Always even un the end of the
[57:51] world so he didn't stay there he didn't
[57:54] stay on the cross it wasn't enough for
[57:57] him to fulfill that portion of scripture
[57:59] but now he's got to fulfill another
[58:01] portion of scripture I'm going to be
[58:04] with you even in you until the end of
[58:06] the world so he laid down his life and
[58:09] raised it up again in three days under
[58:10] the authority of the word and then he's
[58:13] got a well come on now I hope you stay
[58:15] with me for a few more minutes he said
[58:17] he said but then he had another portion
[58:19] to fulfill and under the authority of
[58:21] the word he would leave again he would
[58:23] ascended to heaven but he would send his
[58:25] power back
[58:26] and so that on the day of Pentecost they
[58:28] could receive a portion of his Spirit
[58:31] now now now brother Brandon would say it
[58:33] like this and brother Wendell mentioned
[58:34] this this morning I already had this in
[58:36] my notes but I'm going to say it anyway
[58:38] right all that was in God was poured out
[58:39] into Christ all that was in Christ was
[58:42] emptied out into the
[58:43] believer yes sir well come on somebody
[58:47] that ought to tell you who you are and
[58:49] the prophet of God would say if you
[58:50] could recognize who you are we would get
[58:52] out of here I think it's important that
[58:55] we know who we are it's important to
[58:58] know that we are not defeated and the
[59:00] fivefold doesn't have to sit down and
[59:02] shut up we are a powerful body we have
[59:05] the fivefold we have the well I tell you
[59:08] come on now we have teachers and
[59:09] preachers and pastors and evangelists
[59:11] what are they for therefore for the
[59:12] perfecting of the Saints and for the
[59:14] edification listen we are under the
[59:16] authority of that word if Jesus had to
[59:20] fulfill the word how much more do you
[59:22] have to fulfill that word well he
[59:25] fulfilled his part no you've got a part
[59:27] to fulfill you've got a part and he said
[59:30] all that was in Christ he emptied out
[59:32] into the believer the church he said God
[59:34] is with you though I am with you always
[59:36] even to the end of the world that's the
[59:38] Declaration of God's word that's what
[59:40] the Bible says and that's what I believe
[59:43] that's what a prophet says if he
[59:45] believed that I think I can too yeah I
[59:47] think I can say Amen to that I believe
[59:49] he said I believe it that's what
[59:51] Believers believe and I'm a Believer
[59:53] Amen brother Brandon would use
[59:56] illustration of the ocean he said if we
[59:58] have a spoonful of the ocean and we have
[1:00:01] then we have a portion of his spirit and
[1:00:03] it acts like
[1:00:05] him can you say Amen am if we only have
[1:00:08] a portion yeah now all the ingredients
[1:00:11] that are in the ocean are in the
[1:00:12] Spoonful yeah right yeah and so even if
[1:00:15] you only have a measure of Christ yeah
[1:00:17] you have a portion of Christ you are not
[1:00:20] the entire body but you are a part of
[1:00:21] the body and so you have all the power
[1:00:25] of Christ Christ in
[1:00:27] you under the word of God you have been
[1:00:30] given Authority you are not powerless
[1:00:34] you are not a people of defeat you are a
[1:00:37] people with full word
[1:00:40] Authority when the word spoke it you can
[1:00:43] act on it believe it come on somebody
[1:00:46] you don't have to well come on you don't
[1:00:48] have to sit there and say well what
[1:00:49] about me no just apply it to your life
[1:00:53] apply it to who you are apply the word
[1:00:55] to your situation and you have authority
[1:00:58] to overcome that situation well can you
[1:01:01] say amen amen Lazarus heard the voice of
[1:01:04] the Son of God and a man that had been
[1:01:06] dead four days stood up that was the
[1:01:07] voice of Jesus speaking to Lazarus now I
[1:01:10] would like to ask you what voice do you
[1:01:12] have in
[1:01:12] you all right oh come on all right if he
[1:01:16] had the voice of the
[1:01:19] Resurrection glory to God what voice is
[1:01:22] in
[1:01:24] you you say well who are are we we are
[1:01:27] sons of God we are heirs to every Divine
[1:01:30] promise we are a part of him you make up
[1:01:35] the the the body that is on earth now he
[1:01:38] has no hands but your hands he has no
[1:01:40] feet but your feet he has no voice but
[1:01:43] your voice that's it we don't put it all
[1:01:47] back on a prophet we have been given
[1:01:50] authority to speak the spoken word in
[1:01:53] our day so we say what a prophet said
[1:01:56] and with full Authority we can overcome
[1:01:58] Devils with full Authority we can cast
[1:02:01] out Devils with full Authority we could
[1:02:02] raise the
[1:02:04] dead where where do we get that
[1:02:06] Authority he did it and we will be doing
[1:02:09] the same thing he
[1:02:11] did I don't care if it's been dead 4
[1:02:14] days or 10 years well come on now if God
[1:02:17] told you to go speak and raise a dead
[1:02:20] man then you can take your Authority and
[1:02:22] go down there and raise the dead man now
[1:02:25] we don't go down there on a Feeling we
[1:02:27] don't go down there on an emotion but we
[1:02:29] go down there on the word of God we go
[1:02:31] down there with full author that's where
[1:02:33] our Authority comes from it doesn't come
[1:02:35] from your pastor it doesn't come from
[1:02:37] the Evangelist it doesn't come from my
[1:02:39] pastor but it comes from the word of God
[1:02:43] and if he's saying what a prophet said
[1:02:45] and if I'm saying what a prophet said if
[1:02:47] my pastor's saying what a prophet said
[1:02:49] we are speaking as Oracles of God and we
[1:02:52] have full authority to say what he said
[1:02:58] brother Brandon would say this and I
[1:02:59] love this quote I've always loved that
[1:03:01] Jesus had all the fine qualities of God
[1:03:03] in him he said Do you believe it church
[1:03:05] can say Amen to that he had powers upon
[1:03:08] Powers but when he met Satan he never
[1:03:11] used his
[1:03:12] power okay he give an example for the
[1:03:16] weakest of Christians come on buddy
[1:03:19] that's any one of
[1:03:22] you I love it he said he give an example
[1:03:26] for the weakest of Christians when he
[1:03:28] met Satan he said it is
[1:03:30] written man shall not live by bread
[1:03:32] alone but by every word that predes out
[1:03:34] of the mouth of God the weakest
[1:03:35] Christian can stand can take that stand
[1:03:39] hold it he said he said sure it's God in
[1:03:42] his word every time when he would meet
[1:03:45] the enemy he said it is written if Jesus
[1:03:48] could meet the enemy on it is written
[1:03:51] how much more can we said Jesus said it
[1:03:55] is written
[1:03:56] Malachi 4 a Vindicated Prophet would
[1:03:58] come he said he said I can stand here
[1:04:01] and preach the gospel he said I could
[1:04:03] pray for the sick well come on somebody
[1:04:06] I tell you you have more power and more
[1:04:08] Authority than you think you got you are
[1:04:11] not a powerless people but you have been
[1:04:13] given full Authority Under the spoken
[1:04:17] word of
[1:04:18] God because whatever he would speak you
[1:04:21] can
[1:04:23] speak brother go on he said he said ' I
[1:04:26] believe he had power to do it yeah but
[1:04:28] he met Satan on the same grounds with
[1:04:29] the same word that you could meet him
[1:04:31] with everyone it's written yeah everyone
[1:04:36] every word every word I I tell you I
[1:04:39] think we're living below our privileges
[1:04:41] brother Brandon would say there's
[1:04:42] resources that we haven't even tapped
[1:04:44] into yet there are I I tell you we we
[1:04:47] have never really reached our full
[1:04:49] potential if we're still down here
[1:04:50] fighting with one another well come on
[1:04:52] somebody we're still down here letting
[1:04:55] our complex divide Fellowship we're
[1:04:57] still down here letting the devil get in
[1:04:59] between us and cause us to have odd
[1:05:00] against our brother well come on
[1:05:02] somebody if we're still down here living
[1:05:04] like the chickens in the Barnard I think
[1:05:06] it's time we listen to Mama eagle and
[1:05:08] say I'm ready to get out of here I'm
[1:05:10] ready to fly higher than living down
[1:05:13] here where I'm living don't live below
[1:05:15] your privileges you don't have to live
[1:05:17] below your privileges you've been called
[1:05:20] to come up
[1:05:21] higher now some of you may still be
[1:05:24] living down here here trying to follow a
[1:05:27] chicken or something but I believe if
[1:05:29] you're in this age you have heard the
[1:05:31] voice of the eagle and you have heard
[1:05:33] the scream of a prophet saying come out
[1:05:36] of her my people be not partakers of her
[1:05:38] plagues come up higher live like you
[1:05:41] know how to live live with the authority
[1:05:43] of the word live under the anointing of
[1:05:45] the hour I think it's time that as
[1:05:48] preachers get ourselves out of the way
[1:05:50] and preach and let the anointing of the
[1:05:52] fire of God speak through usen I I don't
[1:05:55] think we need to stand up here and start
[1:05:57] preaching our thoughts and and start
[1:05:58] preaching what we want to preach no I
[1:06:00] don't want to come out here and say well
[1:06:01] I know about so and so I want to meddle
[1:06:04] no I'll leave the pastor and the pastor
[1:06:06] what I want to preach and tell you is
[1:06:08] the word said you are more than able oh
[1:06:11] come on down you are more than able you
[1:06:14] don't have to be sick you don't have to
[1:06:16] be fussing with one another you are more
[1:06:18] than able to defeat that devil that's
[1:06:21] trying to divide you you are more than
[1:06:23] able to defeat a devil that's trying to
[1:06:25] come into this church and cause
[1:06:27] complexes on the people well come on
[1:06:29] somebody you say well what about the
[1:06:31] pastor you know you can give him a
[1:06:32] complex by sitting there looking at him
[1:06:34] like that
[1:06:36] true true that's right yeah you think he
[1:06:40] enjoys preaching to people that don't
[1:06:41] like him up there what well praise the
[1:06:44] Lord I felt to say it and I did I'm
[1:06:46] sorry but if her hurt take
[1:06:49] it listen all right when we come in here
[1:06:53] somebody told me one time check your
[1:06:54] attitude at the door and I've tried to
[1:06:56] do that more often
[1:06:57] nowadays you know it's good you know
[1:07:01] work gets busy work gets hard if you
[1:07:02] deal with customers I know some of you
[1:07:04] you deal with customers and and that
[1:07:06] that gets you in a you know kind of a
[1:07:08] sour mood and and you're like well I
[1:07:10] don't even feel like going to church
[1:07:12] well go anyway yeah but I think it would
[1:07:14] do you real good yeah if on the way to
[1:07:16] church you'd say Lord if I did something
[1:07:18] or said something wrong forgive me I
[1:07:20] don't want to hinder the person sitting
[1:07:21] next to me from getting a blessing in
[1:07:23] church tonight I don't want to be the
[1:07:25] reason that God doesn't show up on my
[1:07:27] Pew tonight well come on somebody I
[1:07:29] don't want to be the reason I don't want
[1:07:31] to be the stumbling block for my pastor
[1:07:32] to preach with the authority of God
[1:07:34] tonight I don't want to be the reason
[1:07:36] he's looking out there and I'm sitting
[1:07:37] there and I'm and I'm mad at the Devil
[1:07:39] but he thinks I'm mad at him and and so
[1:07:41] now we've got complexes well I'm just
[1:07:43] preaching right now but I want to tell
[1:07:44] you something if we can make those
[1:07:46] things right be quick to repent be quick
[1:07:49] to forgive let's love one another and
[1:07:52] let the love of God which is a we've
[1:07:54] been given Authority to love one another
[1:07:57] did you know that you have authority to
[1:07:58] love one another you have no authority
[1:08:01] of a
[1:08:03] complex the Bible not one time says your
[1:08:06] complexes are blessed no okay cursed but
[1:08:09] blessed are the peacemakers there you go
[1:08:13] there you go that's true brother you're
[1:08:14] not I'm not going to be blessed walking

[1:08:22] every one of us deal with a with a human
[1:08:24] condition
[1:08:25] every one of you do and you're going to
[1:08:27] deal with it until you're out of here
[1:08:29] but if we could just feed on the word of
[1:08:31] God and start loving one another come on
[1:08:35] and start really saying you know what
[1:08:37] maybe that brother didn't mean to say
[1:08:39] that maybe that sister didn't mean to
[1:08:41] say that see we have authority in the
[1:08:43] word to
[1:08:45] forgive we have authority to love that's
[1:08:49] good we have authority to be a
[1:08:51] peacemaker we have authority to live
[1:08:53] right we have authority to act right
[1:08:55] right we have authority to say Amen we
[1:08:57] have authority to raise the dead we have
[1:08:59] authority to cast out Devils you're a
[1:09:01] people of
[1:09:02] authority but what what are we doing
[1:09:04] we're using things that have no
[1:09:06] Authority we're going around and saying
[1:09:07] well I think your thoughts have no
[1:09:10] Authority yeah if they don't come from
[1:09:12] the word come on yeah that's it I got
[1:09:15] off my notes and I'm sorry brother R
[1:09:17] said I like the attitude of the
[1:09:19] Centurion he said we've just read it
[1:09:22] guess I better get this off I've got a
[1:09:23] few minutes left on
[1:09:26] he said we've just read it he was a man
[1:09:28] that felt unworthy as long as you're
[1:09:30] feeling Unworthy of the blessing you're
[1:09:31] asking you're pretty apt to get it all
[1:09:35] right well somebody ought to Said Amen
[1:09:36] to
[1:09:37] that if you're feeling unworthy sitting
[1:09:39] here tonight yeah look out you're about
[1:09:41] to be
[1:09:43] blessed if you're feeling Unworthy of
[1:09:45] the blessing you're asking you're pretty
[1:09:47] apt to get it but when you get to a
[1:09:49] place where you think God owes it to you
[1:09:51] that's when you're mistaken we're in
[1:09:53] debt to God God's not in debt to us
[1:09:56] we're indebted to God and this Roman he
[1:09:59] said Lord I'm not worthy that you'd come
[1:10:01] under my roof and and neither thought I
[1:10:03] worthy to come face to you in other
[1:10:04] words I sent your church to meet you and
[1:10:06] you and to ask you this question but I
[1:10:08] have faith I know that you're a man
[1:10:09] under Authority for I'm a man the
[1:10:11] Centurion talking I'm a man under
[1:10:12] Authority he said you don't have to come
[1:10:14] down to my house to put your hands on my
[1:10:16] servant you don't have to come here and
[1:10:18] say my prayer notice but he said be sure
[1:10:20] to get this Prophet said be sure to get
[1:10:22] this he said if I say to this man you go
[1:10:24] do it he'll do it and if I say to this
[1:10:26] man come here he'll come I'm under
[1:10:28] Authority and he said them who are under
[1:10:30] me has to obey me the Centurion talking
[1:10:32] and he knew that he was the son of God
[1:10:34] that's Jesus and he said that every
[1:10:36] sickness the Centurion knew he was a Son
[1:10:37] of God and that every sickness and every
[1:10:39] demon was under him and all he had to do
[1:10:41] is just speak the word not pray but just
[1:10:43] speak the word well come on somebody why
[1:10:46] cry speak you've already been given
[1:10:49] Authority
[1:10:50] speak and he said not just pray just
[1:10:53] speak the word that's all and he said it
[1:10:55] would have done he said he said because
[1:10:57] every demon would have to obey him he
[1:10:59] said you believe that tonight every
[1:11:01] demon will obey God it has to everything
[1:11:05] obeys God it'll obey you if you have
[1:11:09] faith every demon will obey you come on
[1:11:14] if you have
[1:11:16] faith you are a people of power and
[1:11:19] authority but we've got to use it and
[1:11:22] it's got to be according to the word
[1:11:26] outside of the word that's where we lose
[1:11:27] our Authority that's where we let the
[1:11:29] Devils come on us and cause us to be
[1:11:31] sick and say well maybe I'm just meant
[1:11:33] to be sick no you're not meant to be
[1:11:35] sick but raise up with your Authority
[1:11:38] from the word of
[1:11:41] God he said Joshua stopped the son is
[1:11:44] that true somebody said all things are
[1:11:47] possible with God nothing is impossible
[1:11:48] brother puts that in quotes he said but
[1:11:51] he said but nothing nothing he said uh
[1:11:53] he said but all things are possible to
[1:11:54] you also
[1:11:55] yeah you all things are possible to
[1:12:00] you
[1:12:02] also he said nothing impossible to them
[1:12:05] that believe all things are possible he
[1:12:08] said he brought it right down and made
[1:12:09] it you if you just know who God was well
[1:12:13] I'm afraid that the church doesn't know
[1:12:16] their Authority okay all right he goes
[1:12:20] on like this he said I have no power to
[1:12:22] heal I have no Authority when I re when
[1:12:24] I receive it from God to pronounce
[1:12:25] something God has done I have no power
[1:12:27] to heal I have authority let me reread
[1:12:29] that I have authority when I receive it
[1:12:32] from God now our Authority today still
[1:12:35] comes from God but what access do we
[1:12:38] have to God it's his word and his spirit
[1:12:42] and if his spirit's in you and you're
[1:12:44] feeding on his word then you I tell you
[1:12:47] what you are more powerful than you
[1:12:48] think you are a powerful people under
[1:12:52] authority of the word amen brother R
[1:12:55] talks about Samson I mentioned him a
[1:12:56] while ago told you I was ahead of myself
[1:12:59] he said Samson as long as he he said
[1:13:01] excuse me he said and like Samson as
[1:13:04] long as he could feel those locks
[1:13:05] hanging around it was all right when I
[1:13:08] see him moving Among Us like this I know
[1:13:10] he is here don't you amen that's what a
[1:13:14] prophet said is it important to have the
[1:13:16] spirit in our services it is it is it
[1:13:18] important to make him welcome in our
[1:13:20] services I say it is because when you
[1:13:23] see him moving around in a service when
[1:13:26] you see him heal people that come right
[1:13:28] up well come on somebody when I've seen
[1:13:30] him heal somebody it's important that I
[1:13:33] get here to where Jesus promised to meet
[1:13:37] me if he promised he's here and I have a
[1:13:41] need yeah and every one of you do yeah
[1:13:44] then is it important to come where he
[1:13:46] is it's important brother and we have
[1:13:50] authority to meet him here where two or
[1:13:52] three are gathered where two or three
[1:13:55] together in his name I
[1:13:57] am he's in the midst if he's here then
[1:14:01] we have authority to walk up and accept
[1:14:02] our healing
[1:14:04] amen we have authority this is the word
[1:14:08] of God to you that you have the
[1:14:11] authority you are a people of authority
[1:14:14] so when Samson felt the locks he said as
[1:14:17] long as he could feel the locks he knew
[1:14:18] it was going to be all right and I no
[1:14:20] doubt you've been defeated just like
[1:14:22] Samson got defeated no doubt you found
[1:14:24] yourself and you felt like the devil's
[1:14:25] had a hold of you and I tell you what I
[1:14:27] think we ought to cry out once more Lord
[1:14:30] once more restore your power back to me
[1:14:32] I may have went out and I may have
[1:14:34] sinned and I may have failed God I may
[1:14:36] have done things I'm not proud of but I
[1:14:38] say come back in the presence of God
[1:14:41] where all things are possible to them
[1:14:43] that Believe come back to where You've
[1:14:45] Lost Your Love come back to where you
[1:14:47] failed God come back to the house of God
[1:14:50] and say Lord be it unto me according to
[1:14:53] Thy word where the authority is that all
[1:14:55] things are possible to me my house is in
[1:14:57] a bad condition my family they're in a
[1:15:00] bad condition I say Lord restore unto me
[1:15:03] the joy restore my family to me you can
[1:15:06] speak as the Oracles of God you can
[1:15:09] speak with authority that everything
[1:15:11] that Satan has stolen from you is still
[1:15:14] yours you haven't lost nothing but the
[1:15:17] devil has tried to Bluff you and tell
[1:15:19] you well your children can't come back
[1:15:21] because they've went too far your well
[1:15:23] come on somebody your church can't on
[1:15:25] fire because they've just there's
[1:15:27] there's just too much between them right
[1:15:28] now there's no Unity I tell you what one
[1:15:31] service with the power of God in the
[1:15:33] church can bring Unity back between
[1:15:36] people one service in the presence of
[1:15:40] God come down it can cause people to
[1:15:42] love each other again it can cause
[1:15:44] Devils to be cast out a lot of times
[1:15:47] we're looking for the sick to be healed
[1:15:48] and the dead to be raised and we love it
[1:15:50] but sometimes it's just our spirit that
[1:15:53] needs to be changed some times it's our
[1:15:55] attitude that needs the
[1:15:58] healing true how do you know because
[1:16:01] I've been there and I I I every once in
[1:16:04] a while I still get there I get to the
[1:16:06] house of God and I I realize that
[1:16:08] everybody else is worshiping and I'm
[1:16:09] sitting there like what happened to me
[1:16:11] it's like you got a weight on your
[1:16:12] shoulders but do you realize he come to
[1:16:14] set you free you don't have to have that
[1:16:17] weight he has already taking your
[1:16:19] burdens so take them back to the Lord
[1:16:22] and leave them there I tell you what I
[1:16:25] think it's I I think it's time we quit
[1:16:26] doubting the word of God and use this
[1:16:29] word with full Authority use this word
[1:16:32] with the power that it was meant to be
[1:16:34] used in he said we don't need so much
[1:16:35] teaching all over the world but we need
[1:16:37] ministers preaching under the
[1:16:39] inspiration and the power of God I think
[1:16:41] it's time that we fulfill that
[1:16:43] commission and not just go around and
[1:16:45] try to say well let's get bigger
[1:16:46] churches and let's get more people no
[1:16:49] let's revive what we got and let you be
[1:16:51] the let you be the written Epistles to
[1:16:53] the world let's let you get on fire and
[1:16:56] watch the watch the community come back
[1:16:58] on fire well I tell you what you want
[1:17:00] your family saved you get so committed
[1:17:02] to God that you can't stay away from the
[1:17:04] church you get so committed to God that
[1:17:06] you love your pastor and you love your
[1:17:08] wife or your husband whatever the
[1:17:10] situation is you get so committed to
[1:17:13] this message and your family will see
[1:17:15] your commitment and your love and
[1:17:17] they'll want what you got I think it's
[1:17:20] time we quit trying to force them back
[1:17:22] and say I love you and I want to love
[1:17:24] you back to the kingdom of God a little
[1:17:26] bit of love will go a whole long way a
[1:17:28] little bit of love in a church will go a
[1:17:30] long ways a little bit of Grace toward
[1:17:32] somebody that's Fallen we'll go a long
[1:17:34] ways well I'm just preaching to you but
[1:17:36] you know what just a little bit of the
[1:17:38] word expressed in your life is the best
[1:17:41] testimony you can
[1:17:44] have believe it's not enough to say you
[1:17:47] believe a message I've been there it's
[1:17:50] not enough to listen to the message it's
[1:17:53] not enough to say well I I you know what
[1:17:55] I've listened to three tapes this week
[1:17:57] or I've listened to five tapes this week
[1:17:59] and I'm on a schedule of listening to
[1:18:01] tapes I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I it's all
[1:18:03] about them yeah true come on it's all
[1:18:06] about me yeah I I played a tape at a
[1:18:09] certain time I've got a literal tape as
[1:18:11] my token in my house beat
[1:18:14] that it's nonsense
[1:18:16] church we have the word of God that
[1:18:20] tells us what the token is we have a
[1:18:23] tape called the token all you have to do
[1:18:25] is go listen to it we don't have to take
[1:18:28] a man's opinion for what the token is
[1:18:30] you want to know what the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:31] we've got tapes on that you want to well
[1:18:34] come on somebody and your pastor will
[1:18:36] stand here and he'll say what a prophet
[1:18:38] said well come on now I I don't believe
[1:18:41] your pastor is a man full of mistakes I
[1:18:43] believe he's a man of God that preaches
[1:18:45] under the authority of God and the word
[1:18:47] of God well I why are you saying that
[1:18:50] because I think we're we're doubting the
[1:18:51] ministry so much thinking that they're
[1:18:53] just preaching their opinions all the
[1:18:54] time it tells me that you're not
[1:18:56] familiar with what a prophet said or you
[1:18:59] wouldn't sit on a man like
[1:19:02] that that's
[1:19:04] true come on now or you've let your
[1:19:08] opinion come in the way of the moving of
[1:19:10] God in your life because you think the
[1:19:12] church ought yeah you think the church
[1:19:15] ought to be run a certain way you think
[1:19:16] the pastor ought to be preaching a
[1:19:18] certain
[1:19:20] series I'm in so much trouble
[1:19:24] at least I can leave tomorrow praise the
[1:19:27] Lord listen to
[1:19:29] me I know it's funny but listen we we do
[1:19:32] we stop ourselves from a blessing all
[1:19:34] the time by putting Idols ahead of the
[1:19:39] word amen you can be an idol
[1:19:42] yourself you can make your life more
[1:19:44] important than the house of
[1:19:47] God you can make going to church
[1:19:52] secondary
[1:19:53] okay I'm not the pastor so I can say
[1:19:56] this I know the pastors they like to get
[1:19:58] up here and they they'll preach the word
[1:19:59] to you but they really don't want to run
[1:20:00] anybody off you don't have to leave on
[1:20:03] the account of me because I'm
[1:20:04] leaving but
[1:20:06] listen we we don't have to why why why
[1:20:10] should God ever have second
[1:20:12] place that's right when all of your
[1:20:15] Authority and my authority comes from
[1:20:19] him when you deliberately disobey the
[1:20:23] word of God you have lost your
[1:20:26] Authority you've lost your power we go
[1:20:28] back to Samson for a second and say this
[1:20:31] Samson had been called for such a time
[1:20:34] as he was in to slay
[1:20:36] Philistines and he could even he he
[1:20:38] didn't have to have a special weapon he
[1:20:40] just obeyed the word of God so he used
[1:20:43] what was in his hand that's all we've
[1:20:45] got take what's in your hand brother
[1:20:48] Brandon would preach a message on that
[1:20:50] all you've got if all you've got's Faith
[1:20:52] use it if all you've got's the word word
[1:20:54] of God if all I've got a sword use it
[1:20:56] all Samson would get was a was an old
[1:20:59] dried up Jawbone of a mule he had full
[1:21:01] Authority with that
[1:21:03] Jawbone that don't make no sense to
[1:21:05] science but it makes a whole lot of
[1:21:07] sense when you're under the authority of
[1:21:08] the word of God and but when he would
[1:21:11] flirt with the world I hope you hear me
[1:21:13] tonight I'm not trying to preach it
[1:21:14] anybody I I don't know you all that well
[1:21:17] but I'll say this when you start
[1:21:19] flirting with the world and you start
[1:21:22] saying well it's okay if I do this and
[1:21:25] it's okay if I do that and and just a
[1:21:27] little bit well come on now Samson
[1:21:30] hadn't even lost his power but when he
[1:21:32] when he gave away that secret which was
[1:21:35] what he was told by the word of God to
[1:21:37] keep he he he disobeyed the word of God
[1:21:40] and he was weak as any other man you are
[1:21:43] as weak as a drunk on the street without
[1:21:46] the power of God you are as weak as the
[1:21:48] lowest low down person in py Oklahoma
[1:21:51] without the authority of God in your
[1:21:53] life so do we want to go outside the
[1:21:55] word and try to be powerful on our own
[1:21:57] no sir we need God's Authority in our
[1:22:01] life and the only way to get there is
[1:22:04] under the spoken word of God for your
[1:22:07] day it has been revealed for this day it
[1:22:10] well it is not a man's idea it is not a
[1:22:12] man's opinion but it is the word of God
[1:22:15] for this day you have to come under
[1:22:18] subjection not to my opinion not to my
[1:22:21] idea not to brother Wendell's opinions
[1:22:23] but under the word that we are under you
[1:22:26] have to be under that word also it is an
[1:22:29] authority that you have been given now I
[1:22:32] want to read this out of the church age
[1:22:33] book and you may have already got there
[1:22:34] on your studies but brother Ram said
[1:22:36] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:22:38] son Jesus never did anything until it
[1:22:41] was first showed to him by by his father
[1:22:42] he quotes John 5:19 and and this harmony
[1:22:45] is now to exist between the groom and
[1:22:47] his bride I'll say that again the same
[1:22:50] Harmony between God and the son is now
[1:22:52] to exist between the groom and his bride
[1:22:57] how many's the bride in here
[1:22:59] tonight better put your hand up you
[1:23:01] better believe that you ain't getting
[1:23:03] out of here without being the bride I
[1:23:05] I'm not here for the tribulation I'm
[1:23:06] here for a
[1:23:08] Rapture i i i i the harmony that he had
[1:23:13] not my
[1:23:14] will thy will be
[1:23:16] done he didn't do his own will in the
[1:23:19] garden he didn't do his own will on the
[1:23:22] cross but he did the father's will he
[1:23:25] was under authority to the word he had
[1:23:28] to manifest the word the bride must
[1:23:31] manifest the word in this
[1:23:34] hour and to do that you've got to be in
[1:23:37] harmony with the
[1:23:38] groom and he said he shows her his word
[1:23:41] of life and she receives it
[1:23:45] re how do I know I'm bride I've received
[1:23:47] the word and I'm doing my very best yes
[1:23:50] I fail yes I'm in a body of Flesh yes
[1:23:52] I've done things I'm not proud of yes
[1:23:54] it's been a long road to get to where I
[1:23:56] am today but thank God he didn't leave
[1:23:58] me where I was thank God I'm not the man
[1:24:01] I was thank God that he took me out of a
[1:24:04] doubt and confusion State thinking I
[1:24:06] knew the truth out of a dead cold formal
[1:24:09] condition and is brought me into the
[1:24:11] Revelation that I am his and I have
[1:24:14] power it well come on somebody I have
[1:24:17] power I'm no longer just another tape
[1:24:20] boy I'm no longer just another uh just
[1:24:23] another tapeless but I want to be a doer
[1:24:26] of the word of God I have come under
[1:24:28] subjection to the word and I'm going to
[1:24:31] stand here and if a devil would come and
[1:24:33] say you know what that's a lie I'm going
[1:24:35] to stand there and say you know what
[1:24:37] it's not my will but his will be done
[1:24:40] not my will not my will not my word but
[1:24:44] his word be done in my life his word be
[1:24:47] done in your life it well come on now
[1:24:49] his word be done in my family his word
[1:24:52] I'm under subjection I'm under authority
[1:24:55] of a promise that if I will stay in the
[1:24:58] word of God I don't have to worry about
[1:25:00] my family I don't have to worry about my
[1:25:02] household because they're going to be
[1:25:04] there I tell you what it's just like
[1:25:05] leaving Egypt not one hoof will be left
[1:25:08] behind I'm taking everything that
[1:25:10] belongs to me every promise you know
[1:25:13] what Joy is a promise your family is a
[1:25:15] promise God has given you a promise and
[1:25:18] an authority of the word for this hour
[1:25:22] stay under your Authority Hall stay
[1:25:24] under your Authority brother man would
[1:25:26] say like this you thought I was done I'm
[1:25:29] getting
[1:25:31] there he said he said therefore nothing
[1:25:36] can harm her not even
[1:25:42] death can I say that again nothing can
[1:25:45] harm her not even
[1:25:48] death death can't take you out it can
[1:25:52] change your Dwelling Place but it can't
[1:25:55] take you out you say well we buried so
[1:25:57] and so we buried this one we buried that
[1:25:59] one no you they're not dead a Christian
[1:26:02] can't die they are just alive as you are
[1:26:06] well come on somebody a Christian can't
[1:26:09] die you can't
[1:26:11] die well I'm old you can't
[1:26:15] die you can't die because you have
[1:26:20] already conquered through him death hell
[1:26:24] and in the
[1:26:26] grave she receives it she never doubts
[1:26:30] it nothing can harm her I'd like to say
[1:26:33] it again not even death death ain't no
[1:26:36] big deal to a Believer it might hurt you
[1:26:40] but but when you know that just on the
[1:26:41] other side just a dimension
[1:26:44] away just a dimension away your loved
[1:26:48] one that you've lost is standing there
[1:26:50] waiting for you to come
[1:26:52] home why why why would we want to live
[1:26:54] outside of this word when that's a
[1:26:56] promise that we can have why would I
[1:26:59] want to live outside of the word when I
[1:27:01] can believe that if my children should
[1:27:03] well I'll say it if my children should
[1:27:05] go before me then I have a promise of
[1:27:07] seeing them again if I go before them
[1:27:10] they have a promise of seeing me again
[1:27:12] if the Lord carries and there's men of
[1:27:14] God who would leave this scene by way of
[1:27:16] the Grave we're going to see them again
[1:27:18] we don't have to worry about it because
[1:27:21] it's a promise and we're under authority
[1:27:23] of a res resurrection and a
[1:27:25] Rapture that's an authority to you
[1:27:29] that's authority Jesus was under under
[1:27:31] authority to the word you are under
[1:27:34] Authority as long as you stay with the
[1:27:38] word brother Bram said for if the seed
[1:27:41] be planted the water will raise it up
[1:27:44] again here is the secret to this the
[1:27:47] word is in the bride as it was in Mary
[1:27:51] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:27:53] knows what wants done with the word she
[1:27:56] performs the command of the word in his
[1:27:58] name for she has thus sayeth the Lord
[1:28:02] amen not thus sayith Joel puit not thus
[1:28:05] sayith Brother wle Martin we can use any
[1:28:08] Ministry you want to there not thus
[1:28:10] sayith brother William not thus sayth
[1:28:12] listen to me if you're speaking the word
[1:28:14] of God it's thus sayith the Lord but
[1:28:15] it's not my words it's his words it's
[1:28:18] what has already been spoken I have no
[1:28:20] authority to speak on my own but I have
[1:28:23] authority to say what has already been
[1:28:26] said when the prophet said say what is
[1:28:29] said on tapes on the tapes he didn't say
[1:28:32] play what's on the tapes he said say it
[1:28:35] I am under authority to say what he said
[1:28:38] right I I'm not under Authority from
[1:28:40] headquarters I'm under authority of the
[1:28:42] word of the
[1:28:45] hour brother Bram said now we see in the
[1:28:47] Bible that Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:28:49] when he came to the Earth he came to rid
[1:28:51] rid sin and sickness and divorce it put
[1:28:53] it away for from his people and claimed
[1:28:55] that he would return again but in his
[1:28:58] absence he gave his church the same
[1:29:00] Authority that he
[1:29:03] had well where is he in
[1:29:06] you where is he in you where is the
[1:29:10] authority today in you well come on
[1:29:13] somebody that ought to make somebody
[1:29:14] shout you well i' I've heard it said
[1:29:16] that ought to make a presbyterian shout
[1:29:18] but I don't think it will but the bride
[1:29:20] ought to the bride ought to have joy
[1:29:22] knowing who she is the bride should have
[1:29:25] joy knowing that this message has come
[1:29:27] to to bring you back this that you have
[1:29:30] been presented to
[1:29:32] Christ
[1:29:35] already somebody said that's not true
[1:29:37] yes it is you've already been presented
[1:29:40] now I'm not talking about the literal
[1:29:41] Corporal body We Believe there'll be one
[1:29:43] of those brother Bram said Believers
[1:29:45] believe that but I'm talking about
[1:29:46] you've been presented to Christ the word
[1:29:49] in this hour there's been a word come
[1:29:52] that would well if you'll accept it it
[1:29:54] you have the same power that he had if
[1:29:57] you'll just accept it you have the same
[1:30:00] attributes of Christ in you you can do
[1:30:04] what he did you can say what he said you
[1:30:06] can cast out Devils just like he did you
[1:30:10] are a people of
[1:30:12] authority Amen brother R
[1:30:15] says Revelations 10:7 the days of the
[1:30:17] voice of the seventh messenger he's
[1:30:18] quoting the scripture that the mystery
[1:30:20] of God should be finished as Heath
[1:30:21] declared to his servants of prophets we
[1:30:23] all know that he said there it is he is
[1:30:25] sending a Vindicated prophet he is
[1:30:26] sending a prophet after almost 2,000
[1:30:28] years he is sending someone who is so
[1:30:30] far from
[1:30:31] organization and education and the world
[1:30:34] of
[1:30:35] religion that's why wise people may not
[1:30:38] be able to pick this up but you
[1:30:40] can you are wise you are the wise men
[1:30:43] you've seen his star you've come but he
[1:30:46] said he said the world of religion as
[1:30:48] John the Baptist and Elijah of old he
[1:30:49] will hear only from God and will and
[1:30:51] will have thus sayith the Lord and speak
[1:30:53] for God he's talking about the seventh
[1:30:54] angel messenger and he will speak for
[1:30:56] God and he will be God's mouthpiece And
[1:30:58] he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will
[1:31:00] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:31:02] the fathers he will bring back the elect
[1:31:05] of the last day and they will hear a
[1:31:07] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[1:31:10] as it was with Paul I've always been
[1:31:12] read that part of it but they didn't
[1:31:13] read me the rest of it can I go ahead
[1:31:15] and tell you what he said he said he
[1:31:17] will restore the truth as they had it
[1:31:19] and those elect with him in that day
[1:31:22] will be the ones who truly manif EST the
[1:31:24] Lord and be his body and be his
[1:31:30] voice they all like to tell you oh yeah
[1:31:33] here's the voice of the Prophet you need
[1:31:34] to listen to it I do and he said that I
[1:31:38] had the voice in me to
[1:31:40] speak he said he said that the ones who
[1:31:45] truly manifest the Lord and be his body
[1:31:48] and be his voice and perform his works
[1:31:52] it those elect will knew that in the
[1:31:55] last days he said do you see it a
[1:31:57] momentary consideration of church
[1:31:59] history he said will prove how accurate
[1:32:01] this is you may have already read this
[1:32:02] in the church age book I'm not sure if
[1:32:04] you got this far but he said he said he
[1:32:06] will prove how accurate it is in the
[1:32:08] Dark Ages the word was almost entirely
[1:32:10] lost to the people but God sent Luther
[1:32:12] with the word and the lutherans spoke
[1:32:14] for God at that time but they organized
[1:32:17] and again the pure word was lost for the
[1:32:19] organization tends toward dogma and
[1:32:21] Creeds and not simple word yeah I'm
[1:32:24] thankful for simple word I'm not smart
[1:32:26] enough to understand some of these big
[1:32:28] words but I can understand a Kentucky
[1:32:30] hillbilly excuse what I I don't mean to
[1:32:33] I'm not being derogatory there what I'm
[1:32:34] saying is I thank God to use somebody
[1:32:36] that didn't come and speak over my head
[1:32:38] but he could speak just like a southern
[1:32:40] boy could speak and he could say things
[1:32:42] in a way that I could understand it he
[1:32:44] could well we don't want to make a
[1:32:46] mystery out of a mystery he come to make
[1:32:48] it so plain and so simple that he said
[1:32:51] you you can do the same
[1:32:54] works and if I understand him correctly
[1:32:57] he's talking about
[1:33:00] me God sent Wesley he was the voice with
[1:33:03] the word in his day the people who took
[1:33:06] his Revelation from God became the
[1:33:08] living Epistles read and known of all
[1:33:10] men for their generation when the
[1:33:12] Methodist failed God raised up others
[1:33:15] and so has gone on through the years
[1:33:17] until in this last day in this last day
[1:33:20] somebody say in this last day last there
[1:33:22] is again another other people in the
[1:33:25] land well somebody ought to say that's
[1:33:28] me there's again another people in the
[1:33:31] land under their messenger who will be
[1:33:34] the final voice to the final Age and and
[1:33:38] listen he goes on the church is no
[1:33:41] longer the mouthpiece because the church
[1:33:44] he said it's they their own mouthpiece
[1:33:46] they and God has turned on her and he
[1:33:48] will confound her through the prophet
[1:33:49] and the bride and the voice of God will
[1:33:52] be in her
[1:33:55] Glory so are we going to put God back in
[1:33:58] 1947 or 1965 or 63 I know that was God's
[1:34:04] voice to the people I believe that was
[1:34:06] God's voice to the people he said I am
[1:34:08] God's voice to you but he didn't say I
[1:34:11] am God's voice and you need to know
[1:34:13] nobody else is is given this Authority
[1:34:15] and power no he came to reveal a living
[1:34:19] God to you so that you would not be like
[1:34:22] the dark agent and be left a powerless
[1:34:25] church with no God in your services and
[1:34:27] no God in the people but he said no he
[1:34:30] said Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:34:33] today and forever and if the apostles
[1:34:36] were told go speak go preach the word
[1:34:38] under the power and the demonstration of
[1:34:41] the Holy Ghost then a prophet would come
[1:34:43] and show you God is still God and God
[1:34:46] still does what he said now you young
[1:34:49] men take this message on to the coming
[1:34:52] of the Lord
[1:34:55] they're saying the same
[1:34:56] thing Jesus's last commission was
[1:34:59] telling you go into all the world and
[1:35:01] preach the gospel yeah and brother
[1:35:03] Brandon would say there's going to be
[1:35:04] young men take this message and preach
[1:35:07] it until they comeing to the
[1:35:09] Lord I accept the challenge yes in an
[1:35:13] age where the message in an age where
[1:35:15] the message is laughed at in an age
[1:35:17] where the message maybe there's not as
[1:35:19] many as there once was trying to follow
[1:35:20] this message but we don't need numbers
[1:35:23] we need need we need God so that we can
[1:35:25] be a people of authority I I it don't
[1:35:28] take but one man to have authority you
[1:35:30] do you do realize God deals with an
[1:35:32] individual he he may not take the whole
[1:35:34] church but he may be dealing with one of
[1:35:35] you tonight and say you need to accept
[1:35:38] your Authority in the word because
[1:35:40] you've been letting the devil steal your
[1:35:42] joy long enough you've been letting the
[1:35:44] devil get between you and that brother
[1:35:45] in the church long
[1:35:49] enough you've been thinking about
[1:35:51] yourself and putting yourself ahead of
[1:35:53] the church Church long enough I say
[1:35:56] thank you well Jesus never did anything
[1:35:58] for himself that's right he was always
[1:36:01] to going about the father's business
[1:36:03] doing what God told him to do with love
[1:36:07] and and he was going and doing the will
[1:36:08] of the father listen church I know in an
[1:36:11] age where the world has put a a pressure
[1:36:13] on us we're in a squeeze that that would
[1:36:16] make us to where it's almost hard to go
[1:36:18] to church because if you take a job that
[1:36:20] that you work on weekends you can make
[1:36:21] more money come on but is the money
[1:36:24] worth it in the
[1:36:27] end I I think we could go and ask the
[1:36:29] Rich Young Ruler was it worth it when he
[1:36:32] had the opportunity he was a man of good
[1:36:34] character but he couldn't follow Jesus I
[1:36:37] I think we've got good men and good
[1:36:39] women sitting here tonight but don't let
[1:36:41] the devil ever get you out of the word
[1:36:44] of God and try to get you cold on God
[1:36:47] because that will do nothing but steal
[1:36:49] your power and steal your joy and steal
[1:36:51] your children and well it'll steal the
[1:36:54] Holy Ghost right out of your life well
[1:36:56] you I know you can't be lost I know when
[1:36:58] you're saved you're saved but let me go
[1:37:00] aad and tell you this you can lose the
[1:37:01] joy of your salvation and you can
[1:37:03] absolutely get so cold and in a
[1:37:05] backsliding state to where you can't
[1:37:07] even work for God no more and you know
[1:37:09] God can't leave you like that if you're
[1:37:11] one of his you're going to have to go
[1:37:12] through a trial after a trial well come
[1:37:15] on somebody your life may get really
[1:37:17] hard for a while but let me go and tell
[1:37:19] you why not just walk in the in the
[1:37:21] blessings of God why not just tell that
[1:37:23] devil well you know what you're a bluff
[1:37:25] and you have no hold on me you have no
[1:37:28] power over me he's powerless he's
[1:37:30] already been stripped of his rights you
[1:37:33] have been given the rights of God I
[1:37:35] think we need to get ourselves out of
[1:37:37] our cold dead condition and realize that
[1:37:40] God is still God God is more than able
[1:37:44] to raise out I tell you what I believe
[1:37:46] there's a generation this is a
[1:37:48] generation that will not taste death I
[1:37:50] believe this is a generation that is
[1:37:52] going all the way way into the promises
[1:37:54] of God what do you mean by that I
[1:37:56] believe there's a promise of a Rapture
[1:37:58] and I'm looking forward to a promise of
[1:38:00] the Rapture I'm not looking well I tell
[1:38:03] you what I'm not going to be here when
[1:38:04] them bombs are falling and blowing this
[1:38:06] world to pieces you can stay here if you
[1:38:08] want to but I say call me gone because
[1:38:11] I'm going to believe it it may be in a
[1:38:13] moment of twinkling of an eye but I'll
[1:38:15] be gone oh I know you've heard it said
[1:38:17] before but some morning when we hear I
[1:38:19] tell you what we start seeing our loved
[1:38:21] ones together and they start walking
[1:38:23] around and you wh what's going on here
[1:38:25] oh look back to the scripture think
[1:38:27] about it this is just a promise being
[1:38:30] fulfilled and you are a promise being
[1:38:34] fulfilled here tonight why because he
[1:38:36] would have a people on the Earth under
[1:38:38] their messenger and you will be doing
[1:38:40] what a prophet said do you're sitting in
[1:38:42] the house of God when you could be
[1:38:44] sitting home and you could watch a
[1:38:45] basketball game or you could watch your
[1:38:47] TV and you well come on somebody you can
[1:38:50] sit at home and say well I can press
[1:38:52] play at home but you're under a
[1:38:53] authority of a prophet that said be at
[1:38:56] church every time the doors are open he
[1:38:58] said a Christian will
[1:39:00] be well you say my Ox is on the ditch
[1:39:03] well maybe he gave you Grace for that
[1:39:04] but quit putting it there quit putting
[1:39:06] your Ox in the ditch and say well H you
[1:39:08] know what we put we put a well we
[1:39:10] decided to take this job once just one
[1:39:12] Sunday a month it won't hurt nobody well

[1:39:16] you you have chosen money over the will
[1:39:18] of God how can you be blessed in that
[1:39:21] condition how can you be blessed I'm not
[1:39:23] saying you're not going to heaven I'm
[1:39:25] not preaching Anybody Out of Heaven but
[1:39:26] what I'm trying to tell you do you want
[1:39:28] the blessings do you want faith for your
[1:39:30] family do you want faith for a church to
[1:39:32] be on fire for God then you need to get
[1:39:34] in the will of God and be under the
[1:39:36] authority of the message of the hour I
[1:39:37] know I'm a little bit over my time right
[1:39:39] now but let's just close with this
[1:39:41] brother brandom says he said they were
[1:39:42] waiting in the upper room they they
[1:39:45] wasn't presuming they were not venturing
[1:39:47] without Authority they were waiting and
[1:39:50] they were waiting until the scripture
[1:39:51] was made manifest he said GL oh brother
[1:39:54] I wish it wasn't this late oh me too
[1:39:56] brother random how they'd like to stay
[1:39:58] there a little while he said they waited

[1:40:04] they were Pentecost wait under the
[1:40:06] scriptural Authority take your Authority
[1:40:10] you can have what they had under the
[1:40:13] authority of the word of God brother bam
[1:40:16] said once more God will reveal the truth
[1:40:18] as he did to Paul in the days of the
[1:40:20] seventh messenger in the days of the L
[1:40:22] of and age its Messenger will reveal the
[1:40:24] mysteries of God as he revealed to Paul
[1:40:27] he will speak out and those who receive
[1:40:29] that prophet in his own name will
[1:40:31] receive the benef will be will be the
[1:40:33] beneficient effect of that prophet's
[1:40:37] Ministry it's all on brother brandom you
[1:40:40] are the beneficiary of a man that came
[1:40:42] and gave his life for the
[1:40:44] gospel brother BR he he he quotes the
[1:40:47] scripture of 22:17 the spirit and the
[1:40:49] bride say come the corn of wheat the
[1:40:51] bride wheat that fell into the ground
[1:40:52] and I has come back to the original
[1:40:54] grain again word grain again excuse me

[1:40:59] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:41:02] in this last stage what he says from God

[1:41:09] say what he says the bride will say so
[1:41:13] how do you know we're bride we don't

[1:41:22] get him into that seventh Thunders uh

[1:41:26] gifts to preach in that movement there
[1:41:28] was men that could preach a house down

[1:41:31] could have went in there with the gift
[1:41:32] that he's got and and been one of the
[1:41:35] biggest among them but but but he didn't
[1:41:37] choose Fame and money over the word of

[1:45:59] didn't have nothing to do with be born
[1:46:01] in the Martin family but God before the
[1:46:03] foundation of the world knew that
[1:46:05] brother wendle needed somebody to help
[1:46:07] in the music department so he knew in a
[1:46:09] little town called py Oklahoma maybe

[1:46:12] musicians at hand but he would raise up
[1:46:14] some of the best in the

[1:53:38] again I was standing I'm not bragging on
[1:53:41] myself you can put put yourself here I
[1:53:43] was in a prayer line at the meetings
[1:53:45] this year and I felt like I was no good
[1:53:48] I felt like I didn't deserve to be in a
[1:53:50] Pulpit no more I thought well well I
[1:53:52] ain't got I ain't got the anointing to
[1:53:54] preach maybe you've heard me tonight and
[1:53:56] you still think that's the case but God
[1:53:57] said
[1:53:59] otherwise there was a man of God got a
[1:54:01] hold of me that night he didn't know I
[1:54:03] didn't say a word to him he's your
[1:54:04] pastor if you must know I'm not lifting
[1:54:07] up the man but I'm telling you God spoke
[1:54:09] through him he didn't discern my heart
[1:54:11] but what he did was just
[1:54:14] prayed he told me you I'm proud of you
[1:54:18] sometimes you just got to tell somebody
[1:54:19] that they've been down they've been beat
[1:54:23] they're in
[1:54:24] trouble I'm proud of you I I knew where
[1:54:28] you I know what you were he knows what I
[1:54:30] was I tell you about seven or eight
[1:54:32] years ago I'd never see myself standing
[1:54:36] here I shouldn't have even had a friend
[1:54:39] in this message that would ever allow me
[1:54:41] to stand in their
[1:54:43] Pulpit but under the spoken word
[1:54:45] Authority he said young man take this
[1:54:47] gospel and preach it until the coming of
[1:54:49] the Lord I'm going to just go tell you
[1:54:51] something else I've never told your
[1:54:52] pastor and I've never told anybody else
[1:54:54] in this church my wife knows it we were
[1:54:57] here almost almost 3 years ago at your
[1:55:01] meetings you said Pon e is kind of a
[1:55:03] special place where you kind of is I was
[1:55:05] at a hotel and Cushing I believe it is
[1:55:08] and meetings the hotels were full and we
[1:55:10] kind of last minute we we usually stay
[1:55:12] with my cousin but that year we we
[1:55:14] stayed there and and a friend of ours
[1:55:16] paid my paid for my room that year he
[1:55:17] wanted to make sure we come Sunday
[1:55:20] morning we went down and ate break
[1:55:23] breakfast and a and after breakfast I
[1:55:25] went back up to grab my Bible and I had
[1:55:28] I had felt the call of God to preach but
[1:55:29] I wouldn't do it because I I really felt
[1:55:31] like we didn't need preachers no more I
[1:55:32] still felt that way I thought we got
[1:55:34] enough I was I was on I was on board
[1:55:36] with preachers but I just didn't think
[1:55:37] we needed anymore I thought we had
[1:55:39] plenty I opened my
[1:55:41] Bible and I I just read just a few
[1:55:44] scriptures I sat there on the bed and
[1:55:45] read it and it was the
[1:55:48] commission go you into all the world and
[1:55:49] preach the
[1:55:50] gospel and it touched me like it's never
[1:55:53] touched me
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:55:54] before I put it I put it to rest I I
[1:55:57] Clos the Bible and I I started to walk
[1:55:59] out the room didn't mean anything to me
[1:56:01] other than I read it and I thought about
[1:56:03] it a little more I went to walk out the
[1:56:05] room out of the room and this ain't
[1:56:07] Supernatural this ain't vindicating me I
[1:56:08] I just want to say this for the glory of
[1:56:10] God he said just open your Bible again I
[1:56:13] just felt compelled not a literal voice
[1:56:15] just something open your Bible again I
[1:56:17] opened it and it was the same
[1:56:19] chapter wasn't book marked it was just
[1:56:21] the same chapter
[1:56:23] and when I looked down I read the exact
[1:56:25] same verse
[1:56:26] again I didn't think anything about it a
[1:56:29] month after your
[1:56:30] meetings my brother comes up to me on a
[1:56:33] Sunday afternoon an hour before service
[1:56:35] started he said I wanton I don't want to
[1:56:37] I want to ask you this again probably
[1:56:38] but if you got a sermon tonight's
[1:56:42] tonight the day before that I was
[1:56:45] supposed to work and I didn't work I
[1:56:48] never got called in they said we'll call
[1:56:49] you in the morning and tell you where to
[1:56:50] go they never called me I I sat down and
[1:56:53] studied and prepared a sermon as if I
[1:56:55] was going to preach the next day and had
[1:56:57] no idea that I would
[1:57:00] be I'm not saying that to glorify myself
[1:57:03] I'm saying God can take somebody who
[1:57:05] don't want to be
[1:57:06] here and I'm under the authority to say
[1:57:10] what he
[1:57:10] said maybe he wanted to get a witness
[1:57:13] out of a group that didn't believe in
[1:57:14] Preachers no more that God can raise up
[1:57:18] out of
[1:57:19] that and so I can stand here and say God
[1:57:22] has men of God Anointed with this
[1:57:24] message to preach the word of God
[1:57:27] today and I've I've been I've been
[1:57:30] privileged to stand in this meeting with
[1:57:32] men of God I've been privileged to stand
[1:57:35] here today behind a Pulpit of a man of
[1:57:38] God I'm a blessed
[1:57:41] man but I'm under the authority of the

[2:04:32] age amen this is the Capstone
[2:04:36] age this is the authority age this is
[2:04:39] the adoption age this is the age where
[2:04:43] we're no longer
[2:04:44] children amen but we come under the
[2:04:47] authority of the very word of God think
[2:04:51] about it folks what's left preeminence
[2:04:55] in you and the next is going back to the
[2:04:59] eaten condition where you are Sons and
[2:05:02] Daughters of God ruling the entire world
[2:05:06] the Earth that God's put you over in the
[2:05:08] beginning this is who we are this is not

[2:05:14] sermons this is real man this is real
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:23] there's a song I don't know I've heard
[2:05:25] others sing it uh uh we come under the
[2:05:30] authority you anyone anyone know that
[2:05:32] song
[2:05:34] uh uh it's a fast song Under the
[2:05:39] authority of God's
[2:05:43] word amen all right we'll sing that
[2:05:46] song
[2:05:48] Amen huh I get so it's a Gaither song
[2:05:53] Amen is it an old one or new one new one
[2:05:56] old one oh I'm not that old old
[2:06:00] new
[2:06:02] amen I'm glad sing it I'm glad for you
[2:06:06] know
[2:06:07] it
[2:06:10] oh amen well I'm I'm but I I'm thankful
[2:06:14] I'm thankful for this that God's given
[2:06:16] us aren't you well I thought that was a
[2:06:18] beautiful message tonight
[2:06:24] you
[2:06:25] know and and uh and he he gave some
[2:06:29] roses towards me and but I understand
[2:06:31] what he's talking about listen God's the
[2:06:33] the dress wear of the bride of Christ is
[2:06:38] that five-fold Ministry and so you're
[2:06:41] not ever lifting up a mind but but
[2:06:44] having respect for God's gifts that he
[2:06:47] places in the church is so important
[2:06:49] because if you lose that respect you're
[2:06:51] losing your Authority that's right yeah
[2:06:54] that's that's the way God's that's the
[2:06:56] way God's given it amen and so those
[2:06:58] scriptures there we don't use them a lot
[2:07:01] that obey them that have the rule over
[2:07:03] you well there's a reason that God
[2:07:05] places those things in the scripture is
[2:07:07] that Authority he's wanting to get that
[2:07:10] Authority into the believer amen and and
[2:07:14] so we're thankful for for those things
[2:07:18] and I tell you what I I believe there's

[2:07:36] light came over that that crippled woman
[2:07:38] out there and uh and after he told her
[2:07:41] to get up that she's healed or that that
[2:07:45] that uh uh today was her day and when

[2:16:01] yes you're so
[2:16:04] easy
[2:16:15] to women of the world were so quick
[2:16:19] to just put their husband
[2:16:22] down so quick to just dismiss their
[2:16:25] Authority and belittle their husband's
[2:16:30] Authority you see it you see it in
[2:16:32] church too
[2:16:35] but it's that it's that feminist
[2:16:39] spirit
[2:16:40] that you're nothing
[2:16:43] [Music]
[2:16:45] I but the husband is still the leader of
[2:16:48] the home
[2:16:49] [Music]
[2:16:53] and when you see a
[2:16:54] woman acting that way to her husband
[2:16:58] she's just wrong she's Anointed with an
[2:17:00] evil
[2:17:03] spirit but when we look as the Bride of
[2:17:07] Jesus
[2:17:10] Christ I don't want to be
[2:17:14] Anointed with an evil
[2:17:17] spirit I want to recognize him

[2:18:06] time and give my reasoning and give my
[2:18:08] this that and the other
[2:18:10] and I I I want it just to be his I just
[2:18:14] want a pure heart before you and put you
[2:18:17] in your
[2:18:19] place I want to love you
[2:18:22] more I want to serve you
[2:18:25] more I want to give up myself to you
[2:18:29] more I want to hear your words
[2:18:31] and not come back with contention back I
[2:18:36] just I just want to say you have a
[2:18:38] reason for why you're saying what you're
[2:18:40] saying and you have a reason you're
[2:18:42] doing what you're doing and I I I I want
[2:18:46] to follow
[2:18:48] you I want your will in my life
[2:18:52] I want to come under your
[2:18:55] Authority and I say
[2:18:58] tonight I think that should be all of
[2:19:04] us sometimes that we're living in a in
[2:19:06] in
[2:19:07] in in the Le oan Church age where
[2:19:12] it's women's
[2:19:15] rights and it's an incredible thing
[2:19:17] because we are this is the women's
[2:19:19] rights it's it's brother brandom says
[2:19:22] the natural just simply reflects the
[2:19:24] spiritual points to
[2:19:28] it in the women's Liberation movement
[2:19:31] and and we
[2:19:33] see we see the the way that that's all
[2:19:35] went but we've also seen the way it's
[2:19:37] went in the church
[2:19:38] World till today it's just a
[2:19:41] mockery it's women out there jumping
[2:19:44] around dancing around claiming this that
[2:19:46] and the other and they have no Authority
[2:19:49] no power no nothing they're claiming
[2:19:51] that they and when I say women I'm
[2:19:53] talking about churches
[2:19:54] [Music]
[2:19:57] they flaunting their stuff and they
[2:20:00] broke the chain of
[2:20:03] command the
[2:20:05] word their
[2:20:07] husband has been put off to the
[2:20:11] side but the bride still has
[2:20:14] [Music]
[2:20:15] Authority because she still recognizes
[2:20:18] who he is he's the RO
[2:20:21] R he's the
[2:20:23] [Music]
[2:20:24] captain our husband is the is the god
[2:20:29] the king of all heavens and
[2:20:32] earth and when I come under that
