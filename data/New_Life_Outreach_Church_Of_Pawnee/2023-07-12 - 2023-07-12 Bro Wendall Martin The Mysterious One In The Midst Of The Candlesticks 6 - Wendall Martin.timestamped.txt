[29:08] son of man clothed with a garment down
[29:11] to the foot and was gerd about the paps
[29:14] with the golden girdle his his head and
[29:18] his hair is wide as wool white as snow
[29:21] eyes were like flames of fire his feet
[29:24] like fine brass
[29:26] his voice is the sound of many Waters
[29:29] and he had in his right hand Seven Stars
[29:33] and out of his mouth what a sharp
[29:35] two-edged sword and his countenance was

[30:15] healing for him
[30:17] Lord we're just asking that you would
[30:19] help us as we Minister your word this
[30:21] evening be with us in all that we do and
[30:24] say in Jesus name we pray can the Church
[30:27] Say Amen
[30:29] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[30:32] amen so these these Wednesday nights
[30:35] we've been um uh we've been going
[30:38] through this
[30:39] um through these studies on the study on
[30:42] the mysterious one in the walking in the
[30:45] midst of the candlesticks
[30:46] and um we have
[30:51] um
[30:53] uh we this last week we dealt with a man
[30:57] out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged
[31:00] sword and um and of course now on these
[31:03] Wednesday nights again we're not um uh
[31:05] this is this is sort of um uh you know
[31:09] you're free to ask questions lift your
[31:11] hands or anything like that where it's
[31:12] gonna we're trying to do this as a Bible
[31:14] study type setting and so if you have
[31:17] any questions
[31:19] um or you know some people say well I
[31:21] get my questions when I get back home
[31:22] well write them down and then we can ask
[31:25] them we can ask ask the questions when
[31:28] we come back in because
[31:30] there are no stupid
[31:32] questions amen and so if you have
[31:37] anything we we want you to make sure you
[31:41] you say so
[31:43] um we have we have talked about this um
[31:46] I I didn't quite I wanted to just deal a
[31:50] little bit more on uh out of his mouth
[31:53] now
[31:54] we had uh I believe it was the the
[31:58] fourth personage of Christ was amen his
[32:02] voice uh was the voice of the sound of
[32:05] many Waters and of course we went
[32:07] through his voice as
[32:11] multitudes people Nations tongues amen
[32:15] this this is his voice the man uh would
[32:19] would have would have the sound of the
[32:21] multitudes speaking
[32:23] and um and then this last week we as we
[32:27] dealt with out of his mouth also a
[32:29] two-edged sword and of course the sword
[32:32] is is a weapon man you think of Warfare
[32:36] when you think of the sword
[32:39] um amen and um uh and how will the
[32:43] Antichrist be destroyed the Antichrist
[32:45] was going to be destroyed by his mouth
[32:49] now the scripture says there in second
[32:51] Thessalonians to an eight it says then
[32:54] shall that Wicked be revealed whom the
[32:57] Lord shall consume
[32:59] with the spirit of his mouth
[33:02] and so we understand that these words
[33:05] that you're we're not the word uh the
[33:09] Bible is not just words men but it is a
[33:15] Living Word so everything that we see
[33:17] here this person of Christ is the living
[33:21] logos it's the Living Word it's the
[33:24] anointing so what we are seeing amen and
[33:28] brother Branham would say even in one
[33:29] place he said that one that's walking in
[33:32] the midst of the candlesticks is is a
[33:34] type of the Bride so it's what it is
[33:37] it's the anointing it's the Holy Spirit
[33:41] working through seven churches the seven
[33:45] Church ages it's it's one two it's two
[33:47] thousand years it's one church but it's
[33:50] in it's in seven different stages and
[33:54] and so God broke it down uh uh so that
[33:58] you and I could see it so it's one
[34:00] church it's over it it spans over 2000
[34:03] years but he is he is bringing it down
[34:06] to the sevens amen so that he can show
[34:09] his his uh what he's doing in each
[34:13] period of time we understand that seven
[34:15] in the Bible seven is a is the number of
[34:19] completion can you say Amen so so if we
[34:23] as as we review Once Again the man that
[34:26] this mysterious one who is he he's the
[34:29] living word amen that's the logos that
[34:33] created all things amen it's that it's
[34:36] that logos that said let there be and
[34:39] brother random says it could have been
[34:41] a thousand years before the sun actually
[34:45] came about amen he said when he said uh
[34:49] when he was bringing the seeds up out of
[34:51] the ground he said that logos hovered
[34:54] over the seeds and was bringing him to
[34:57] pass it was the logos that created uh uh
[35:01] Adam in the death of the earth so amen
[35:05] so the scripture says he is before all
[35:07] things amen he's the creator of all
[35:10] things and by him all things exist he is
[35:15] Alpha and Omega he'll be before he'll be
[35:19] after can you say man
[35:21] and so Jesus was the logos made flesh so
[35:26] the spirit of the word The Man created a
[35:30] body and that Holy Spirit moved on the
[35:34] inside of that being he become the very
[35:38] body of God now amen so the the mystery
[35:41] is the mystery is is not Jesus Jesus is
[35:45] not the mystery anymore we know who
[35:47] Jesus is
[35:48] Jesus is the son of God Amen and when
[35:53] and he and the father are one when you
[35:55] go to when you go to heaven you're not
[35:57] going to see two Gods you're going to
[35:59] see how many gods
[36:01] one God Amen God lives in the body of
[36:06] Jesus Christ they're synonymous they'll
[36:09] never more be separate amen they are
[36:12] while he was on the earth he says now I
[36:15] do nothing except my father first show
[36:17] me my father in me does the works can
[36:19] you say Amen now but this mysterious one
[36:22] that is walking in the candlesticks it's
[36:25] God living
[36:27] in human beings in the redeemed that's
[36:30] what God is trying to show throughout
[36:33] the church ages it's God living himself
[36:36] through the first church second Church
[36:39] Third Church fourth Church fifth sixth
[36:44] seventh Church
[36:45] it's God living in you now that's what
[36:49] that's what he's doing God's living his
[36:52] life through you
[36:55] now he done it through Christ to redeem
[36:58] you hallelujah amen but now through the
[37:02] Holy Spirit he's living in you amen so
[37:07] brother uh brother Branham would say the
[37:10] word is God the spirit is God they are
[37:14] all one one cannot work apart from the
[37:17] other if one truly has the spirit of God
[37:21] he will have the word of God so so now
[37:24] what he's saying when you receive the
[37:25] Holy Ghost the word for your day is
[37:29] lived in you
[37:31] oh Hallelujah Jesus wasn't a bit worried
[37:34] he was the son of God Amen he said
[37:37] search the scriptures they declare who I
[37:39] am I'm here fulfilling them brother
[37:41] Branham says I I'm not they said are you
[37:43] worried when you come to the platform
[37:44] are you worried you're going to miss it
[37:46] no he knew he was Malachi 4.
[37:49] the word was living through him he could
[37:53] say beyond the shadow of a doubt I'm the
[37:56] Elijah
[37:58] Hallelujah why did Elijah come to turn
[38:01] the hearts of the elect back to so you
[38:06] and I can stand and say I am that heart
[38:11] I am very late
[38:14] I am that word
[38:18] amen and the Holy Spirit is here to make
[38:22] that word to live
[38:25] so the Holy Ghost is what it's the
[38:28] spirit of the letter
[38:31] so what the letter is
[38:33] the the the logos is the spirit it's the
[38:38] living part that makes the letter to
[38:40] live
[38:41] well glory to God what what what is it
[38:44] when we look at healing when we're
[38:46] asking for healing or we're electing
[38:47] we're looking for these things we're
[38:49] simply expecting the Holy Spirit to get
[38:53] in this this letter here and make it to
[38:56] live
[38:57] can you say amen amen so amen so uh
[39:01] Jesus would say they're at the uh in
[39:04] John 6 and 63 I believe it is he says uh
[39:08] uh you can you can put it up there the
[39:10] words that I speak uh unto you are
[39:14] spirit and they are alive so here he is
[39:17] again here's the words their spirit
[39:21] and their life don't set in a church
[39:25] and learning doctrines and have no life
[39:30] God's desire is for his word to become
[39:35] life
[39:36] to you and to me can you say Amen
[39:40] so so as we go on I want us to just stop
[39:43] for a few a few min
[39:45] and I want us to look at this map
[39:47] calls amen it's the this this this
[39:51] mysterious one this mysterious one when
[39:55] he opened his word to speak amen it was
[39:58] as it was it was as the multitudes it
[40:02] was amen the words uh were were like the
[40:06] voice of many Waters amen so in order
[40:10] and and we know that was multitude so
[40:11] that's the Holy Spirit living and
[40:14] resting in you so you you when you are
[40:18] you you we were all born in sin we were
[40:20] all shaping and iniquity
[40:23] um we have a lot of our mama and our
[40:24] Daddy's uh genetics in us we're born
[40:28] we're born Sinners is that right
[40:31] and yet God wants to redeem that's what
[40:33] their savior done that's why Christ came
[40:35] God Came In the Flesh God Came In the
[40:39] Flesh reconciling the world is that what
[40:41] he said God in Christ reconciling the
[40:45] world to himself so he came to pay the
[40:48] price to bring you back to himself
[40:51] so that he could redeem you live in you
[40:55] you are no more yourself there's back
[40:58] there let's just turn there real quickly
[41:01] um they're in First Corinthians
[41:03] 6 and 18.
[41:06] praise the Lord
[41:08] Hallelujah
[41:10] First Corinthians 6 and 18 and we'll
[41:13] wait till you youngans get there
[41:16] and when you get there you can say Amen
[41:19] praise the Lord
[41:21] okay so it says free fornication for
[41:24] every sin that a man doeth is without
[41:27] the body but he that committeth
[41:29] fornication sinneth against his own body
[41:32] what no you not that your body is the
[41:37] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[41:40] which ye have of God ye are not your own
[41:43] ye are bought with a price therefore
[41:46] glorify God in your body and in your
[41:49] spirit with your Gods can you say Amen
[41:52] so now here here God is
[41:56] so we when we are when we are filled
[41:59] with the Holy Ghost amen we we he's he's
[42:02] he's igniting something within us I I
[42:06] wanted to
[42:07] um brother Branham make some statements
[42:09] here and he and he takes there in John
[42:12] and if you want to turn uh John 20 and
[42:15] 21 and then you'll you'll understand
[42:17] where we're going for a few moments uh
[42:21] John 20
[42:24] and and 21
[42:25] [Music]
[42:31] praise the Lord
[42:32] he says then Jesus said unto them peace
[42:36] be unto you as my father hath sent me
[42:38] even so I send you
[42:42] now
[42:43] um now brother Brandon would say now
[42:45] watch the father that sent him went in
[42:47] him and he says and and he says as he
[42:51] sends his disciples he goes in them it's
[42:53] the same one he says when he had said
[42:56] this
[42:57] this is the 22nd verse and when he had
[42:59] said this he breathed on them and saith
[43:03] unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost
[43:07] whoever's whosoever sins you remit they
[43:10] are remitted unto them and whosoever
[43:12] sins you retain they are retained so now
[43:15] here we're going back to the Breath of
[43:18] God I'm wanting to really deal with the
[43:20] spirit of his mouth
[43:23] amen he breathed upon them and said
[43:27] receive ye the Holy Ghost amen now this
[43:32] is I think I think this is important
[43:33] because the church is going to have to
[43:37] speak
[43:38] now catch this the church the voice of
[43:42] many Waters you are going to be the The
[43:45] Seven Ages God is going to be speaking
[43:47] through the church
[43:49] so God is breathing his breath
[43:54] upon the elect when you receive the Holy
[43:57] Ghost brother Branham says it is God
[43:59] breathing his breath like he did unto uh
[44:03] into your nostrils as he did unto Adam
[44:06] brother Breton would say the church is
[44:09] the mystical Body of Christ born of the
[44:13] Breath of God he said do you get it the
[44:18] Church of God is born of the Breath of
[44:22] God that God breathed breath into the
[44:27] nostril spiritually of Adam and he
[44:29] become a living Soul did you know the
[44:31] Pentecostals are the two the true
[44:33] Pentecostal church is born of the Breath
[44:37] of God
[44:39] amen so so I now now this is this is
[44:43] beautiful because here we are this
[44:46] mysterious one hey man he's got the wig
[44:49] uh he's he's he's got the eyes of fire
[44:52] he's going through all of these he's
[44:54] we're going we've gone down through his
[44:55] personages and but when he is speaking
[44:59] it is as the sound of many Waters and
[45:03] this is so this so confounds the people
[45:05] did you know that the that they could
[45:08] not accept Christ
[45:11] being the son of God
[45:14] they could not accept that the father
[45:18] God of all glory would speak through a
[45:23] mortal man
[45:24] and did you know that that's still a
[45:26] hard thing today
[45:28] God's speaking through a mortal lip it's
[45:32] hard to get people to believe a prophet
[45:34] it's hard to get them to believe Malachi
[45:36] 4.
[45:37] because it's that they want the Holy
[45:39] Spirit to come and speak to them amen
[45:43] but God has a way a plan in doing it can
[45:47] you say Amen so so the whole fuss that
[45:50] religion had with Christ was that he
[45:53] himself making himself good but you see
[45:56] it was God in Christ making him one with
[46:01] himself therefore he was God
[46:04] reconciling the world to himself
[46:08] Jesus was the image of the invisible God
[46:16] amen
[46:18] what is the image of the invisible God
[46:20] today
[46:22] they're still they're God's wanting
[46:23] God's got to have an Earthly image
[46:26] his bride is the image
[46:30] of the invisible God
[46:33] now
[46:35] I I if you don't see that in yourself
[46:38] you're not seeing your position Christ
[46:41] placed you in a position with him
[46:45] a position of authority a position where
[46:49] his word is with you
[46:51] now now brother Branham would say he
[46:54] would say um he says now they was
[46:58] looking at that little body that was
[46:59] born of Mary see that wasn't God that
[47:02] was the son of God but God was in the
[47:05] body and it was God
[47:07] amen he said if I do not the works of my
[47:10] father then then condemn me but uh but
[47:14] which one of you can condemn me of sin
[47:16] unbelief in the word which word has God
[47:19] spoke that hasn't been fulfilling me sin
[47:22] is unbelief which one of you can accuse
[47:24] me of sin sin is unbelief show me if I
[47:29] do not the works of my father then don't
[47:33] believe me
[47:34] but if I do the works though you can't
[47:38] believe me believe the works that I do
[47:40] for they testify otherwise the fathers
[47:43] in me testifying of himself
[47:46] he says now because God was in Christ
[47:48] reconciling the world then he ask the
[47:51] question do you get it
[47:54] so you're saying yes we get it I'm going
[47:55] to get that God was in Christ
[47:58] and you've been saying yes yes you keep
[48:00] saying it God's in Christ brother when
[48:01] do we get it
[48:03] but then he stops do you get it well now
[48:07] the same life that's in that vine is
[48:12] also in that branch
[48:15] [Applause]
[48:16] he said you can't join into it it's the
[48:21] life of the Vine
[48:25] so he keeps going over and over here he
[48:28] keeps trying to drive it home
[48:30] you're just as mysterious
[48:32] as Jesus was mysterious
[48:35] and you've got to see yourself in the
[48:39] light of the great love Goss
[48:43] in you
[48:47] it's hard for you to see that because
[48:48] you're still you still got a sticky
[48:51] nature
[48:52] you still got all of this but God's
[48:55] wanting you to see that you are his
[48:57] hands his feet his eyes
[49:01] amen
[49:03] is that right
[49:04] so so he would go on the Apostle Paul
[49:08] would say Christ in you the hope of
[49:11] glory
[49:12] amen all right so so brother Branham
[49:16] would say now how did God make the Earth
[49:19] he spoke it amen you see it he's fake
[49:24] and the world come into existence
[49:26] and this world this morning is the
[49:29] spoken word of God
[49:30] and he believed his own word can I hear
[49:32] an amen
[49:33] he says here it is watch it
[49:37] and if God and you're an offspring of
[49:40] him God is in you he'll believe his own
[49:43] word though it can't be seen felt taste
[49:46] anything he'll believe it see what I
[49:49] mean for God in you will believe
[49:54] his own word
[49:57] amen so now each age become God's voice
[50:02] so I and I want us to look here because
[50:04] each age become the voice he would send
[50:06] his words through an Earthly mortal
[50:10] messenger
[50:13] amen and then that Earthly mortal man
[50:18] would give it to the people
[50:21] and the people would have to receive
[50:24] that word from that messenger
[50:28] or they would miss what God was doing
[50:32] they had to receive it from the
[50:36] messenger to the age
[50:39] Hallelujah
[50:41] now now you say now now brother Wendell
[50:43] are are you sure about now we don't went
[50:45] through that he's got the Seven Stars in
[50:47] his hands
[50:48] those Seven Stars amen are the seven
[50:52] Messengers to the seven churches the
[50:55] seven spirits of God declaring himself
[50:58] in in a body can you say Amen now if you
[51:03] if the Holy Spirit has breathed his
[51:07] breath upon you
[51:09] hallelujah it's the same breath that
[51:14] wrote this so if he's breathed that
[51:17] breath upon you that it's enlightened
[51:20] you to see the word of your day
[51:25] [Music]
[51:28] how is it that we cannot be deceived
[51:31] someone says oh you're following blindly
[51:34] no the spirit that wrote the book
[51:39] has breathed upon me
[51:43] and open my eyes to see the word for
[51:47] this day
[51:49] do you see why you have to have the Holy
[51:51] Ghost in order to see the word
[51:54] it's that breath that spoken in the
[51:57] beginning
[51:58] are you following me
[52:00] amen now
[52:03] brother Brandon would say
[52:04] isn't it easy
[52:06] with that Spirit that's in God that's in
[52:10] you you be you uh you believe God can do
[52:16] anything and will keep his word cause
[52:19] you're born again the life that was in
[52:22] Christ is in you
[52:25] amen so he says isn't it easy that that
[52:28] spirit that was in Christ is now in you
[52:32] and you can believe his word for
[52:33] anything
[52:34] he says now if you just belong to the
[52:36] church
[52:37] and never born again you'll reason it
[52:39] then you'll never know God until his
[52:42] Spirit through his blood comes into your
[52:44] heart and then you become a new creature
[52:46] so so our learning our Revelation here
[52:50] as we're as we're going into these seven
[52:52] churches Church ages and by the way did
[52:55] you bring those uh Church age books uh
[52:58] by the way we've got we have got some
[53:01] church age books here
[53:03] um that that we would like to um anyone
[53:07] that's god well I think we've got 14
[53:08] Church age books and I'd like to get
[53:11] some since we're getting into these
[53:12] Church ages I'd like for you to start
[53:14] reading those who don't have it so
[53:16] um we'll we'll deal with that a little
[53:18] bit later on so the multitude of these
[53:20] Witnesses for each age amen so we went
[53:23] through that it you there there was
[53:25] there was the seven Messengers to The
[53:27] Seven Ages there was the voice of the
[53:29] fivefold ministry who declared the
[53:32] gospel as delivered by the church age
[53:34] Messengers and then there was the
[53:36] millions of witnesses who lived
[53:39] as an open book amen
[53:42] and Sue uh so as we look at this amen
[53:47] these these voices are are uh or the the
[53:53] are living through you and through me so
[53:56] I want us to now as we as we dealt with
[53:58] those now let's go to the sword for just
[54:01] a moment and I and I want us to hit this
[54:03] sword that we talked about this last
[54:05] week Imagine because now those Living
[54:08] Voices the words that have been brought
[54:11] forth the spirit of that word amen and
[54:14] again you're reflecting the living
[54:16] Christ you know every day you go to the
[54:19] job you're reflecting Christ
[54:22] at home and and there's this there's a
[54:25] there's a spat between you and your wife
[54:27] and you and you you choose to do things
[54:30] the right way that's that's the Christ
[54:33] flowing through you that's that's love
[54:35] Mercy flowing through you can you say
[54:37] amen amen the spirit of the Lord doing
[54:40] those things in us now
[54:43] I I want us to look here
[54:46] um let's look here where brother Branham
[54:49] mentions in in Revelations four and five
[54:53] now we understand that the fourth
[54:55] chapter is
[54:57] um is is Judgment the the third the
[55:00] first three chapters was the church ages
[55:03] Church ages are now over door was opened
[55:05] up in heaven now brother Branham is
[55:07] telling us that the fourth chapter of
[55:10] Revelations is dealing with judgment and
[55:13] so I'm just going to read the fifth
[55:14] verse I want us to read that and he says
[55:15] and out of the throne proceeded
[55:17] lightnings
[55:18] and thunderings and
[55:21] a voice
[55:25] voice says plural
[55:28] now
[55:30] this is Judgment this is Judgment but
[55:34] the voice says can you say Amen who is
[55:37] it and and there were seven lamps of
[55:40] burning a fire burning Before the Throne
[55:42] which are the seven spirits of God and
[55:44] so we understand amen that this is that
[55:46] this this is going to The Seven Ages
[55:48] seven spirits speaking through now
[55:52] I I they're they're in um uh Exodus 19.
[55:58] and we'll turn there just real quickly
[56:01] we'll um for you young ones we'll wait
[56:03] on you Acts or Exodus 19 brother Branham
[56:06] tells us to go back and look in the Old
[56:09] Testament when God dealt with the Jews
[56:12] coming out of Israel or out of Egypt and
[56:16] um and he and he said that this this
[56:18] happening here in Exodus 19 chapter
[56:21] he says God had brought Israel out of
[56:24] out of bondage and um uh he had
[56:28] performed wonderful things but Israel
[56:30] wanted a law that they could live by
[56:33] they wanted to keep a few Commandments
[56:35] be good do a few good things and nice
[56:39] things but God wanted life
[56:42] and so when they but they demanded a law
[56:46] and so God was going to show them
[56:49] and I want you to look here in Exodus 19
[56:52] and 16. he says and it come to pass on
[56:55] the third day in the morning that there
[56:58] were Thunders and lightning and a thick
[57:02] Cloud upon the mountain
[57:04] and the voice singular of the trumpet
[57:09] exceeding loud
[57:10] so that all the people that was in the
[57:12] camp trembled
[57:14] and Moses brought forth the people out
[57:16] of the camp to meet with God and they
[57:18] stood on the nether part of the mountain
[57:21] and Mount Sinai was all together on on a
[57:25] smoke because the Lord descended upon it
[57:27] in a fire and the smoke thereof ascended
[57:30] as a smoke of a furnace and the whole
[57:33] Mount quaked greatly
[57:35] and when the voice singular of the
[57:39] trumpet sounded long and waxed longer
[57:42] Moses spake and God answered him with a
[57:46] voice and once again it is singular all
[57:49] right let's go to the 20th chapter in
[57:51] the 18th verse
[57:53] so here's the Judgment now when God's
[57:56] speaking in the Old Testament
[57:58] amen he is speaking seeing it's and it's
[58:00] thundering out of the sky out of the
[58:02] cloud and and and the the people are are
[58:06] are very nervous here in the 20th
[58:09] chapter of Exodus the 18th verse and all
[58:11] the people saw the thunderings and the
[58:14] Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet
[58:16] and the mountain smoking and when the
[58:19] people saw it they removed and stood
[58:23] afar off
[58:24] and they said unto Moses speak thou with
[58:27] us and we will hear but let not God
[58:30] speak with with us lest we die
[58:34] now and and Moses said unto the people
[58:36] fear not for it is God that has come to
[58:38] prove you that his fear may be among you
[58:41] or uh before your faces that ye sin not
[58:44] and the people stood afar off and Moses
[58:46] Drew near into the thick Cloud where God
[58:49] was now so here you've got here you've
[58:52] got after the church ages after the
[58:54] church ages it's the same story there's
[58:58] the Lightnings there's the thunderings
[59:00] and then there's the voices
[59:05] in the Judgment of the Old Testament it
[59:08] was lightning thunderings voice
[59:13] of God
[59:14] told Moses or the people told Moses
[59:18] we can't hear from God anymore
[59:22] we don't want we we don't we're going to
[59:24] die if we see this every time he comes
[59:26] to visit us give us a prophet
[59:29] so then God in a couple more chapters
[59:31] says all right I'll give him a prophet I
[59:34] will only speak through a mortal man
[59:37] so here now I want us to to to
[59:42] understand that that brother now brother
[59:44] Branham is saying he says it's not one
[59:48] voice but its voice says plural what was
[59:52] it God speaking to the church reflecting
[59:55] himself through the seven spirits when
[59:58] the true anointed of God speaks it's the
[1:00:01] voice of God and to reject it is to
[1:00:05] remove the Candlestick see voices the
[1:00:08] son of the voice of the seven Church
[1:00:10] ages over here in the corner the voice
[1:00:13] is speaking with thunder and lightning
[1:00:15] nowadays they'll they'll say well we
[1:00:18] don't believe in saying Hell in the
[1:00:21] Pulpit oh mercy see we need men of God
[1:00:25] men who won't hold back now everybody
[1:00:28] can't be a preacher
[1:00:30] but you've got a voice somebody say I've
[1:00:33] got a voice
[1:00:35] you can't preach the people a sermon now
[1:00:37] if you're a preacher you're called to
[1:00:39] preach in the Pulpit if you're not
[1:00:41] you're still a preacher but live the
[1:00:43] people a sermon let your sermon be lived
[1:00:48] it's the voice of God that'll bring
[1:00:51] reproach to them who reject it
[1:00:54] they'll say no one can put a finger on
[1:00:56] his or her life they're sweet they're
[1:01:00] living if there's if there ever was a
[1:01:02] man of God it's that man or that woman
[1:01:06] live your sermons don't try to preach
[1:01:09] them if you're not called to preach
[1:01:10] you'll get it all mixed up anyhow
[1:01:12] and you'll get people tangled up he says
[1:01:15] you'll ruin them and yourself too and
[1:01:17] you just just live your sermon he says
[1:01:20] the preachers called to preach and to
[1:01:23] live his too and if you can't live it
[1:01:25] then stop preaching it but you're
[1:01:27] supposed to be it to live your sermons
[1:01:28] he says all right so here was the voices
[1:01:31] and all how we need in Jeffersonville
[1:01:35] thousands of lived voices
[1:01:38] Thunder of God thundering out in
[1:01:42] sweetness and Holiness and Purity
[1:01:44] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:01:47] Earth today without a blemish yes sir
[1:01:49] real Christians that's Thunder against
[1:01:52] the enemy he says the devil don't care
[1:01:55] how loud you can holler the devil don't
[1:01:58] care how much you can jump how much you
[1:02:01] can do this or that but what hurts the
[1:02:04] devil is to see that Sanctified life
[1:02:08] holy life concentrated to God say
[1:02:11] anything to him call him anything just
[1:02:13] as sweet as can be and move right on oh
[1:02:14] my that throws him away that's the
[1:02:17] Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:02:20] can you say Amen so now what is in God's
[1:02:24] mouth
[1:02:25] his word
[1:02:27] and yet his word is spoke
[1:02:30] not through the perfect Son of God but
[1:02:32] now his word is being proclaimed through
[1:02:35] multitudes
[1:02:38] Hallelujah that doesn't mean that
[1:02:40] multitudes are doing the preaching it's
[1:02:42] the it's that God has sent the seven
[1:02:44] Messengers God has given us fivefold
[1:02:47] Ministry and then the church takes that
[1:02:50] word and believes it now there is a
[1:02:54] there there is a a great a great
[1:02:57] you know move today trying to take the
[1:03:02] voice of the minister away
[1:03:04] and and I I must say that it that should
[1:03:07] not be and it's and it's in the message
[1:03:09] where where there they just uh doing
[1:03:12] everything they can they say that every
[1:03:14] Pulpit should be surrendered to brother
[1:03:16] Branham and that we should be playing
[1:03:18] tapes that's not the way that that it
[1:03:23] was said in the scripture and it's not
[1:03:25] the way the brother random taught it
[1:03:27] Amen brother Branham said take this they
[1:03:31] asked for the random 65. should we quit
[1:03:33] preaching uh and he says no no he says
[1:03:37] when it in the big scheme of things I'm
[1:03:39] just a little Pebble on the beach we've
[1:03:42] all got a work that we've got to do and
[1:03:45] then he says you're going to be held
[1:03:47] responsible
[1:03:48] we are all going to be held responsible
[1:03:51] for this message that we're given
[1:03:55] can you say Amen
[1:03:57] now here's here's here's the deal I'm
[1:04:00] not going to keep you too much longer
[1:04:01] here tonight
[1:04:03] but my deal is this
[1:04:05] just as Jesus said I do nothing
[1:04:09] except the father show me
[1:04:12] did not brother Branham says the bride
[1:04:15] will have the have thus saith the Lord
[1:04:18] for she will keep still
[1:04:23] did not brother Branham teach us that
[1:04:25] there is a Razor's Edge difference
[1:04:27] between right and wrong
[1:04:30] are y'all hearing me
[1:04:32] the voice is in you
[1:04:37] the prophet's not here
[1:04:40] you're the one that is letting that word
[1:04:43] have preeminence in you
[1:04:47] how are you going to judge the world
[1:04:50] by the message you have accepted in your
[1:04:53] day
[1:04:54] Hallelujah I want it and I want to say
[1:04:57] friends there's going to be people even
[1:05:00] in our Even in our church here that that
[1:05:02] that you know we're going through the
[1:05:04] trials we're going this you know we we
[1:05:06] we the doctors reports and things like
[1:05:08] that but in our little group that we're
[1:05:10] sitting right here we're not worshiping
[1:05:12] a man we simply know that the scripture
[1:05:16] says that he would send us a messenger
[1:05:18] to this age
[1:05:20] and if we will heed the voice I'm not
[1:05:23] called to be a prophet so I can't be a
[1:05:26] prophet but what I can do as a pastor I
[1:05:30] can take the convictions with everything
[1:05:32] that I can see that God allows me to see
[1:05:35] of this message and I and and my my job
[1:05:38] is to point you to wipe that prophet's
[1:05:42] at
[1:05:44] because I'm not to take the price of the
[1:05:46] prophet
[1:05:48] and you're not to take the place of the
[1:05:50] preacher
[1:05:51] we all have a job and that's to live
[1:05:55] this word and that our voices
[1:05:59] declare it plainly
[1:06:04] pure lives clean lives
[1:06:07] undefiled lives
[1:06:09] are y'all hearing me
[1:06:11] so when when when we sit at judgment
[1:06:15] it's not that we're all going to sit
[1:06:17] around and take turns judging people
[1:06:20] it's the life that we lived in the age
[1:06:23] that we lived God lived his life
[1:06:28] through mortal beings
[1:06:30] and most people are treating you like
[1:06:33] they would treat Christ
[1:06:36] treat Jesus back two thousand years ago
[1:06:39] they don't see it
[1:06:41] but you do
[1:06:43] that's the reason I want to come back to
[1:06:45] this and visit this for a minute because
[1:06:47] in these Church ages it's important that
[1:06:49] you see who you are
[1:06:52] Hallelujah now listen
[1:06:56] if if we're if we're living loose
[1:06:58] if if you're if if you're if you're
[1:07:01] mouthing you know your husband and he's
[1:07:03] your leader and I don't care if you go
[1:07:05] back and apologize all the time or not
[1:07:07] after a day or two if you are allowing
[1:07:10] this to happen and you're not allowing
[1:07:12] your husband to lead you're not living
[1:07:14] this message
[1:07:16] if you're not if if you're if you're
[1:07:20] um you know
[1:07:22] allowing sin in your life and and then
[1:07:25] we we God's not called us to write the
[1:07:28] altar
[1:07:29] God's call us into Joseph Perfection
[1:07:31] remember remember the form foundations
[1:07:34] that this Great Masterpiece is built
[1:07:36] upon right
[1:07:38] what's the first Foundation
[1:07:41] election
[1:07:43] y'all y'all remember it
[1:07:45] Abraham Isaac Jacob and then Joseph so
[1:07:50] the first one was election brother
[1:07:52] Branham what did he say Isaac was
[1:07:55] love
[1:07:56] what did he say the that Jacob was
[1:08:00] Grace
[1:08:01] what did he say that Joseph was
[1:08:04] perfection
[1:08:05] he says here they go and brother Bradham
[1:08:08] says now the problem is when God's ready
[1:08:10] to build his masterpiece
[1:08:12] he says then we go from Joseph
[1:08:14] Perfection and come back down to Jacob
[1:08:16] Grace and he said then we'll just get
[1:08:18] everything all mixed back up again
[1:08:19] see but God's looking for someone God's
[1:08:23] looking for someone that he can build a
[1:08:25] masterpiece out of and I believe he's
[1:08:26] building that right here we must take
[1:08:29] this message serious in our lives and
[1:08:33] overcome
[1:08:36] how many Overcomers are in the building
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:40] now we've got to
[1:08:41] so so brother brother Brandon would say
[1:08:44] what is in the mouth of the Lord
[1:08:47] it's the word that's in his mouth
[1:08:50] he says Matthew 4 and 4 it says uh but
[1:08:55] he answered
[1:08:56] and said it is written man shall not
[1:08:59] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:09:02] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:09:06] the word is supposed to be in our mouths
[1:09:09] too now we know the church is his body
[1:09:12] it is here to taking his place what will
[1:09:15] be in the mouth of the church
[1:09:17] the word
[1:09:19] so everything we believe now you say
[1:09:22] brother word word word word word word
[1:09:24] word word that's all we hear word word
[1:09:26] what are you talking about word
[1:09:28] you young people
[1:09:31] need to be looking in the Bible for the
[1:09:33] word concerning you
[1:09:35] how you're to treat mamas how you're to
[1:09:37] treat Dad how you're to treat and how
[1:09:39] you're to live flea fornication that is
[1:09:43] word for you
[1:09:45] you are you are submitting yourself to
[1:09:49] your parents who are you who is your
[1:09:52] Authority
[1:09:53] you understand that so you're sick you
[1:09:55] are submitting yourself to that word now
[1:09:59] I'm I'm not in that category
[1:10:02] I like to think I'm young but I'm
[1:10:05] feeling pretty old these days amen so
[1:10:07] but I've got a word concerning me
[1:10:11] and I am Duty bound to take what the
[1:10:15] prophet said about me and what the word
[1:10:18] said about me
[1:10:20] and there's a lot in there concerning
[1:10:22] the man
[1:10:25] can you say Amen
[1:10:26] now and you women the same way there's a
[1:10:29] lot of scripture concerning you women
[1:10:32] and you've got to stay in your place
[1:10:35] your position every one of us the
[1:10:39] preacher we've got to find our place in
[1:10:42] the word
[1:10:44] and when we do this and we're taking
[1:10:45] this seriously we're heeding to the
[1:10:48] message of Malachi 4.
[1:10:50] actually
[1:10:52] we're preaching a gospel that this world
[1:10:55] needs to hear
[1:10:59] we're preaching something that is to
[1:11:01] hear can you say Amen
[1:11:03] the the Apostle Peter says if any man
[1:11:06] speak Let It Be of the Oracles of God
[1:11:08] we believe what the word says is that
[1:11:11] right
[1:11:12] so so brother brother Branham I ask he
[1:11:15] says
[1:11:16] what is wrong with these people of the
[1:11:19] last day
[1:11:20] he says they have gotten away from the
[1:11:23] word they are no longer fervent about it
[1:11:28] they are lukewarm about it
[1:11:33] Hallelujah so he's asking he's asking he
[1:11:37] says and and this is all part of that
[1:11:39] quote where he's talking about God is
[1:11:41] going to spew them out of his out of his
[1:11:43] mouth and he's and he said the reason
[1:11:44] why he's spewing the church it's not the
[1:11:46] individual he's got he's got an elect
[1:11:49] but he says the elect who has the spirit
[1:11:52] of his mouth will have that will live
[1:11:57] that word like the the the uh a like God
[1:12:01] said it at the beginning those who have
[1:12:04] the of God
[1:12:08] will live
[1:12:10] the word
[1:12:11] now he says the problem with the age is
[1:12:15] there's a lot of learning and
[1:12:17] no one's fervent there's no life
[1:12:20] so I think we need to pray Lord
[1:12:22] let that be in me is that right
[1:12:26] now what was Malachi 4 to do turn our
[1:12:29] hearts
[1:12:30] turn our love turn our our passions
[1:12:37] turn the passions back
[1:12:42] to the apostolic fathers that's his
[1:12:44] that's that's the whole goal are you
[1:12:46] hearing me so so this this word amen
[1:12:50] that that that came out of the the mouth
[1:12:53] of God
[1:12:55] the reason that I can speak the words of
[1:12:57] God is because the Breath of God has
[1:13:00] energized me
[1:13:02] energize me I'm not lukewarm about it
[1:13:04] I'm not cold about it I have got it in
[1:13:08] my mouth or in my heart so brother Brown
[1:13:11] says there it is he is sending a
[1:13:12] Vindicated Prophet he's sending him
[1:13:14] Prophet after almost 2 000 years
[1:13:17] he is sending someone that who is so far
[1:13:19] from organization and education and the
[1:13:21] world of religion that uh John the
[1:13:24] Baptist
[1:13:26] that that is John the Baptist and Elijah
[1:13:28] of old he will hear only from God he
[1:13:31] will have thus saith the Lord and speak
[1:13:33] for God he will be God's mouthpiece to
[1:13:37] this age now he And he as it is declared
[1:13:40] in Malachi 4 and 6 will turn the hearts
[1:13:44] of the children back to the fathers he
[1:13:48] will bring that elect back of the last
[1:13:51] day and they will hear a Vindicated
[1:13:53] Prophet give the exact truth as it was
[1:13:55] with Paul he will restore the truth as
[1:13:58] they had it and those elect with him in
[1:14:01] that day will be the ones who truly
[1:14:04] manifest the Lord and be his body and be
[1:14:10] his voice and perform his works
[1:14:13] Hallelujah do you see it
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:20] praise the Lord Breathe on Me Lord
[1:14:22] Breathe on Me not a learning but Breathe
[1:14:26] on Me Oh when these men and I I tell you
[1:14:28] what it is not just a one-time deal we
[1:14:30] need the Holy Spirit to breathe his
[1:14:33] breath upon us and renew us and can you
[1:14:37] see man amen now now he's done it the
[1:14:40] same way he says now a momentary
[1:14:44] uh consideration of the church history
[1:14:47] will prove how accurate that thought is
[1:14:49] in the Dark Ages the word was almost
[1:14:52] lost entirely lost to the people but
[1:14:54] Luther but God sent Luther with that
[1:14:56] word lutherans spoke for God at that
[1:15:00] time they organized and the pure word
[1:15:02] was lost for organization tends towards
[1:15:04] dogma and Creeds and not simple word
[1:15:07] they could no longer speak for God then
[1:15:09] God sent Wesley and he was the voice
[1:15:11] with the word and the people who took
[1:15:13] his Revelation from God became that
[1:15:15] living epistle read a known of all men
[1:15:17] for their generation when the method has
[1:15:19] failed God raised up others until it's
[1:15:21] gone through the years until in this
[1:15:23] last day
[1:15:25] there is again another people in the
[1:15:29] land who under their Messenger will be
[1:15:33] the final voice
[1:15:35] to the final age
[1:15:38] that tells me brother if the Holy Spirit
[1:15:41] has breathed if the logos
[1:15:44] has breathed upon me
[1:15:47] I don't have to look out out outside of
[1:15:50] this message to find Healing
[1:15:52] to find the answers for for for for for
[1:15:55] my uh for for our marriage for our
[1:15:58] church for our children for anything
[1:16:00] else the Breath of God is with this
[1:16:04] elect listen I wanted I I you know I
[1:16:08] wanted to I I wanted to come back and
[1:16:11] talk about that mouth one more time
[1:16:12] because I I to me it's it's so beautiful
[1:16:16] God
[1:16:17] oh it's not it's not quoting quoting's
[1:16:20] fine but there's a lot of people that
[1:16:21] can quote and can't live it
[1:16:23] so we want the Holy Spirit
[1:16:26] to quote by life
[1:16:29] quote by life
[1:16:32] right
[1:16:34] I don't want to say God's A Healer and
[1:16:35] then we never see him as a Healer
[1:16:38] I want him to quote healing through me
[1:16:42] through my life
[1:16:43] I want I want him to to speak
[1:16:46] Deliverance through me through my life
[1:16:49] amen that's that's that's what God's
[1:16:52] looking for
[1:16:54] is that right
[1:16:55] oh church this ain't this ain't just a
[1:16:58] religious setting it's not we we you
[1:17:01] know we're we're not we're not Muslims
[1:17:03] Muslims have good good good ethics and
[1:17:06] things
[1:17:08] and all kinds of denominations have good
[1:17:10] ethics but there is a people
[1:17:14] who under their messenger has become the
[1:17:18] final voice
[1:17:20] now catch that
[1:17:22] every one of the Seven Ages have had a
[1:17:25] voice and there's people that had the
[1:17:28] Breath of God they live what the
[1:17:32] messengers were saying and the prophet
[1:17:34] is saying God in this last day has got
[1:17:37] him a final group
[1:17:39] amen and I could go through a lot of
[1:17:42] quotes here where he was saying and the
[1:17:45] power of Pentecost will be in her
[1:17:49] praise the Lord amen he says the church
[1:17:52] is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is
[1:17:54] its own mouthpiece God is turning on her
[1:17:56] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:17:58] and the bride for the voice of God will
[1:18:02] be in her yes it is for it says in the
[1:18:06] last chapter of Revelations verse 17 the
[1:18:08] spirit and the bride say come once more
[1:18:12] the world will hear directly from God as
[1:18:16] that Pentecost
[1:18:18] that of course the word bride will be
[1:18:20] repudiated as it was at the first can
[1:18:24] you say Amen
[1:18:25] do you understand what I'm saying Oh The
[1:18:28] Living Voices amen all right anybody
