Yes, &gt;&gt; Father, for reaching down your &gt;&gt; mighty hand [music] and touching our lives, Lord, bringing us out of the darkness of this world and set our feet upon the solid rock. &gt;&gt; Yes. having a revelation of you and a revelation of who we are. We We don't have an issue, Lord, of [music] of of our lack or our inabilities or our complexes, Lord. For we have seen you and you have revealed yourself [music] to us. We thank you for it, Lord. We just ask Lord that your Holy [music] Spirit would would just continue to sweep across our congregation this morning. And Lord, that you would minister to every need, every heart, Lord, as we lift your name for that is what we are here to do is to lift [music] up the wonderful name of Jesus.

And Lord, we just ask that you would be with those that not feeling well. Lord, Sister Angie's [music] not feeling well this morning. and just ask Lord that you would touch her.

Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. Wonderful presence that we feel here [music] this morning. God is so good to to his people. and um he never fails and I'm so thankful for [music] that. Here today, you can be seated. We've got a a special treat this morning. We're going to uh dedicate Oliver and uh if they want to come up then do we have somebody that would uh that can take [music] uh that that would want to film it and take picture. Uh you're welcome to do that. I don't know who But um um we we sure do love Brother Josh and Sister Loretta and their family. And [music] um you know um I think I I believe uh dedications is [music] is special. We've seen it throughout the scripture. And um Jesus would take the babies and [music] and um the children they would they would trying to push the kids away. And so this is an important time, [music] you know, keep the kids away. And Jesus said, "Suffer the little children to come to me &gt;&gt; and he took them in his arms and he blessed them." &gt;&gt; And [music] um we appreciate they are children are are blessing from the Lord. They're in [music] 1st Samuel 1 and 27. This is Hannah giving her child back to the Lord. It says, "For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my petition, [music] which I asked of him. Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord as long as he lives, that [music] he may be lent to the Lord, and he worshiped the Lord there." And so [music] we're we're so thankful uh for Lucas Oliver [music] Martin. And um I'm going to wake him up here. Oh yeah. Amen. Isn't he a fine looking [music] fella? Look, look at this good looking fella right there. Hallelujah. [applause] And um we're we're just, you know, I I'm so thankful for [music] what this message has produced because this message has we if if we didn't have this anointing in this in [music] this last day, there is no telling where the family would be. But I'm so glad that there will be another another [music] generation if the Lord should terry because there's men and women who's really taking their their [music] position seriously and raising these children before the Lord. I I wonder [music] if we could just all pray, bow our heads and pray. Father, we want to [music] thank you for Lucas Oliver. Lord, we thank you for [music] this precious gift of life that you have given to Josh and Loretta. And Lord, we're [music] offering him back to you and knowing, Lord, that you have just lent them, lent him to us, [music] Lord, to raise and to hold and to love. And I pray Lord that this child would be raised in the atmosphere of divine love. And Lord may love direct his life. Lord from the cradle all the way to the time that you come. [music] I pray Lord that your anointing would be upon him and that you would bless him physically [music] and keep your hands upon him Lord. Lord, keep him from the the evils of the world and keep his spirit and his body and his soul, Lord, until the coming of the Lord Jesus. I pray, Father, that the angels of God would minister [music] to him and lead him to his divine call and [music] that you would keep him all the days of his life. Lord, I pray a special blessing upon Brother Josh and Sister Loretta that you would give them wisdom, Lord, as they [music] as they follow you and as they lead their family. And I I pray, Lord, in the times, Lord, of questions, in the times where there's [music] the fork in the road, and Lord, maybe there will be decisions that has to be made for Oliver. [music] But Lord, I I pray, Father, that you'll always hear their prayer. When mama gets a little bit weary and and she needs some help from you, Lord, and she's asking, I [music] I pray, Lord, that you would send the angels all around her and that you would lift her up, that you would bless her, that you would bless, Lord, the family, and may this unit be uh so bound together, Lord, by your divine love that nothing would ever be able to come in, no woof &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; bearer demon. But father, may the blessings of God be upon them. Father, we thank you for it. We [music] thank you. We give Oliver to you now. We love you for your blessings and [music] we thank you for it. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. That's a good looking fine looking fella right there. He's a gruner. [applause] And [music] uh we're Jeremiah the their families [music] just are growing and and uh we got some more babies that's fixing to be born here before long. and uh Sister Laur uh or [music] Sister Tina and Sister Stacia and uh so we're we're sure looking forward [music] to to those as well. Amen. Well, praise the name of [music] the Lord. Well, if you have your uh scriptures, you can you can stand to your feet and and um in honor to the word. [snorts] And uh well this morning uh brother brother brother brother Daniel Black was supposed to be preaching to you and uh uh the rain sort of hindered things here and so and we just want to say right off the bat sister Leah we are so sorry about those caramel apples. Now the thing is sister Leah she she talked to me personally in person on Thursday. She said, "Now, Brother Wendell, are we [snorts] going to be have it? I really, this is going to be a lot of work." And and um so it uh are we going to Is there a chance that we're not going to have it? And I said, "Sis, we are going to have that." And u uh hallelujah. Well, she made those caramel apples and and and we're not having it this weekend, but I did read the text that there are some caramel apples after church. Amen. [laughter] So, so for those ladies who have been working, uh you know, maybe you had some soups ready. Amen. Freeze them and I don't know. Amen. But uh we're just we we are looking forward two weeks from today uh we will be we're going to try that fall fellowship again and um we will see how that goes. Let's look here in 2 Corinthians 4 and6 and um we're thankful to the Lord for his word. It says, "For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." But we have this treasure in earth and vessels. And that's where my title is going to be this morning. Treasure in earth and vessels. That the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. We are troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed, always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal bodies. This is an incredible thing. the life of Jesus would be made manifest in our mortal bodies. I'd also like to look here in in First John 2 and 18 and um then we'll let you have your seats. [clears throat] Uh 1 John 2:18. Little children, it is the last time as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrist, whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us. For had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. But they went out that they might be manifested that they were not of us. But you have an uncction from the Holy One, and you know all things. Aren't you glad for the uncction of the Holy One. I have not written unto you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank you today for your for your word of promise. We thank you, Lord, for this great anointing that is upon the earth today. And I pray, Lord, that your words of life would just that that they would become life to every one of us as we sit in your presence this morning. Help us, Lord. Help me to speak what you would have me to say Lord. Help me Lord remove every hindrance out of the way. And I also ask Lord that you would remove every hindrance from our hearing. And we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be seated here today. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So we we are looking here treasures in earthn vessels and um uh we we think as we look at this treasure we we know that we're in the last church age and that as as the last church age um there we're in the finality. This is the rapturing age. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the going to talk on the term of the anointing of uh anointing today for a few moments because brother Brandham says there is a rapture anointing here on on the earth. There is Amen. The mighty angel has come with that open book. That is the title deed. Amen. that mighty angel is the anointing upon the word to open that word to us. &gt;&gt; And when we think about the anointing, I think, amen, we in um our western culture, we use it very loosely today. uh uh uh we we we use the Pentecostals use the word uh uh anointed, you know, and sometimes we can say uh boy, that was an anointed preacher or that was an anointed song and and we talk about the anointing in in a in a loose way. But when you think about the anointed, you know, the the just because the preacher is a good ortor and maybe he has a great ability to study, that doesn't mean he's anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He may be able to place history and stories together and Amen. in such a way as to inspire. He may have great talent. Amen. And and lack and lack anointing. Zero anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are singers who can who can belt out the lyrics and can can move a crowd. They can really sing. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that they are anointed. &gt;&gt; You see, we we we can we can uh uh see a lot of we we use that term in Pentecost. It's just constantly used. Amen. But you see anointed there there is a real anointing. So when we talk about the anointing, Amen. It it it is uh it it's a Hebrew term and and first of all the term was not used by only by Jews only. It was used by by pagans. Um uh most most all of of the pagans uh used the word the term anoint and they would they the word anoint means to rub or smear or paint oil uh on an object. Amen. And um it was to uh set that object aside and and they would consecrate it and um uh for a for a divine purpose and then they would worship that that uh object that idol or that that whatever. And so amen, another word was to pour out. Amen. to uh to to as a consecration to the priest where they would pour oil upon upon the priest. And um and again, it was to set that object aside or set that priest aside. And they would they would put it on like they were Amen. They would put it on uh uh oil upon the altars. They would put oil even in the on the tabernacle. And so with as we talk about the anointing here this morning, I want us to to get away maybe from the Pentecostal term of anointing because today we we have we have sort of made the anointing as if it is uh a good feeling. Amen. A good feeling in the church service or uh you or you know you you pray and you're anointed. But but the the the term anointing, I want us to go just a a little deeper. And as we as we look there in the in the Old Testament, Amen. Uh the earliest biblical use of of the term was when Jacob uh Jacob had anointed a stone. He he had laid his weary head on on a stone and amen had fallen asleep and and after which God gave him a dream and and the dream amen angels ascending and descending and God confirming the covenant with him and and and when he woke up he said this is holy ground. This is this is sacred ground. So he took the stone and he set it up as a pillar. Amen. and and he anointed or he smeared some oil upon that and he consecrated it and he later come back and he and and and and he called the place Bethl, the house of God. Amen. and and uh and and so the the Bible says there in Genesis 28:18, "And Jacob rose up early in the morning and he took the stone that he had put for his pillows and he set it up for a pillar and he poured the oil up on top of it. He was consecrating it or setting it aside." Amen. As a place that and God would honor that. God honored what he had done as he placed the oil upon it. Little later on, we we find that God instructed Moses, Amen, to take uh to take an oil and to prepare it. And there were certain spices and certain things that they were to to put upon it. AND THEY WOULD CONSECRATE THIS oil to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It would be a sweet smelling incense unto the Lord. In Exodus 25 and6 it says oil for the light and spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense. And so here here the anointing. Amen. It was now not upon a rock that was found but now God is instructing him to to take this specially prepared oil and and to set aside amen. the altar to set aside the the the tabernacle. Amen. For a place of worship. AND THEN GOD WOULD COME DOWN upon those sacred grounds and he would anoint. Amen. He would anoint that. He would he would uh his presence would come down upon that that was anointed. AMEN. SO GOD WAS placing a significant purpose upon this anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. He would use this term again. He was using a term that they were all very familiar with even in the Amen. uh in the pagan worship. But but he was using this term to express a much more divine meaning AND PURPOSE BECAUSE THEN GOD TOLD HIM, HE SAYS, "NOW I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS OIL." He was going a little bit further. I want you to take this oil and I I want you to consecrate. Amen. Anoint the priest. I want you to take these these men, these certain men that I have chosen out of your out of your tribes, and I these MEN I HAVE SET aside and I WANT YOU TO POUR THE OIL UPON THEM FOR THEIR priestly roles. AMEN. AND AND THAT ANOINTING, AMEN. THAT THEY WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR MY GLORY TO COME UPON THEM AND I WILL USE them for my divine purpose. Amen. Exodus 30 and30. AND THOU SHALT ANOINT Aaron and his sons and consecrate them that they may be they may minister unto me in the priest's office. Amen. And so uh uh they they they they would use it. IT WAS GOD TAKING THIS this word anointing and he was it was IT WAS BRINGING GOD DOWN OUT OF THE THE THE the heavenly realm into the earthly realm. THEY WERE SET ASIDE FOR GOD'S GLORY, God's spirit to come here upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you know we we we understand that uh that even Samuel and and I just want to go through this for a few moments here. Amen. When when God wanted to anoint uh David to be king, HE TOOK THE PROPHET SAMUEL. AMEN. AND INSTRUCTED HIM TO TAKE THE HORN of oil. Amen. And he was to anoint David to be the king. Amen. David uh was eternally a man after God's OWN HEART. AMEN. GOD had thought of DAVID FOR AMEN. GOD HAD A PURPOSE FOR DAVID. NOW, DAVID WAS in the sheep in in in in the you know, taking care of the sheep there in the pasture. Amen. David might not have known that that he was going to be a king. Maybe he didn't feel like he was a kingly type of guy, but yet he was forever in the MIND OF GOD. GOD HAD DETERMINED THAT David was going to be a king, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that the lineage through his lineage, THE MESSIAH WOULD COME AS THE REDEEMER. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, DAVID WAS ETERNALLY a man after God's own heart. Amen. Brother Brandham says it was inevitably uh a wrote in in heaven by the blood of Jesus. Amen. There was nothing THAT COULD CHANGE THAT UH THAT ANOINTING AS SO AS AS AS HE COME. AMEN. Here here come here here comes Samuel with the the horn of oil and and he comes to THE HOUSE OF JESSE BECAUSE GOD HAD CHOSEN Samuel to be his representative. Amen. You take that as the prophet. You take that oil and you go down because you're going to anoint a son OF JESSE. NOW THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THERE were the son after son come through. And Samuel, Amen, EVEN AS A PROPHET OF GOD, HE HE LOOKED AT these at these men. They were strong in stature. They were good to look upon. They were Amen. And and and and he would stand there and say, "This must be the man that you have that you have called to be anointed." But God would say, "No, that's not the man." &gt;&gt; Amen. uh uh uh uh MAN AFTER MAN, BOY AFTER BOY WENT through and until there there was no more. And Samuel left and said, "Do you have anyone else?" Amen. There's got to HAVE ANOTHER SON. AND HE SAYS, "YES, I'VE GOT A SON." HE'S OUT TAKING care of the sheep. He's just a He's just a lad. Amen. He's not really good for much of of of strong things cuz he's just Amen. He He's not He's not a real strong fella. and and and and and THE THE THE PROPHET SAMUEL SAYS, "FETCH HIM FROM THE FIELD." He says, "For I will not set down until he comes." &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Now, this was this was the THE PROPHET FIXING TO POUR THE ANOINTING UPON THE future king. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE PROPHET. GOD HAD INSTRUCTED HIM TO COME. AMEN. and to and to UH VALIDATE THE CALL THAT WAS ALREADY UPON HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; And and so uh we we find out that this that that that he come and and uh Amen. And immediately there he knew. And the Bible says there in 1st Samuel 16:13, "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren, and the spirit of the LORD COME UPON DAVID FROM THAT day forward." &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can see when that anointing come, AMEN. THAT THAT ANOINTING NOW NOW IT WASN'T THE OIL NECESSARILY BUT IT WAS GOD SENDING THE REPRESENTATIVE to anoint the word that was for that day &gt;&gt; now he could have he could have poured he could have poured that oil amen on every one of those boys and it wouldn't have done any good &gt;&gt; he could have poured THE OIL SO IT WASN'T IT WASN'T REALLY THE OIL BUT IT WAS THE EARTHLY AMEN AGREEMENT WITH WHAT GOD HAD. WELL, I WANT TO TELL YOU HERE TODAY, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT the anointing that has come in every one of those church ages. GOD WOULD SEND A MESSENGER TO ANOINT THAT CHURCH AGE WITH THE WORD. AND THE ELECT and the elect only were the ones that were going to hear that word. I I WANT YOU TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF, BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK THE BIBLE SAYS, AMEN, THAT THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH. &gt;&gt; But that does not mean that all flesh is going to accept it. Amen. THAT ARE Y'ALL UNDERSTANDING. BUT IT'S THE WORD THAT THE ANOINTING OF THE PROPHET THAT HAS COME TO THE ELECT THAT IS WHAT energizes and brings you into that reality. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now brother uh uh brother Brandham would say David was called by election. He was elected. Called anointed placed elected by God. Called from the sheep heard him to be the king. Anointed positionally placed. Look, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Abraham, election, Isaac, justification, Jacob, grace, Joseph, perfection. Nothing against Joseph. All right, there you are. See, are you a David? Are you CALLED ELECTED FIRST BY GOD? HOW MANY CHRISTIANS here can raise your hand? If you're not a Christian, you're you're uh by your your desire. Or he says, you're not a Christian by your desire. YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN BY GOD'S DESIRE. GOD DESIRED YOU TO BE A CHRISTIAN. AND YOU'RE NOT A CHRISTIAN BECAUSE YOU HAVE ABILITY. IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS ANOINTING UPON YOU TO be a Christian. Amen. That's exactly right. HE SAYS, "NO man can come to me except my father draw him first. YOU WAS ELECTED BY GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD TO BE A CHRISTIAN." THAT'S SCRIPTURE. Jesus said, "No man can come except my father calls him." First thing you was elected and called. When God elected you, then he called you and you heeded to his call. Then he poured the anointing oil on you, the Holy Ghost. AMEN. WHAT DOES THAT OIL REPRESENT IN THE BIBLE? THIS THE HOLY SPIRIT. WHEN he poured OIL UPON HIM, HE BAPTIZED him with the spirit. Amen. In the symbol form. NOW HE WOULD GO ON DOWN. HE SAYS THERE HE WAS. AMEN. ELECTED, CALLED, ANOINTED, and positionally already king. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD COME TO HIM AND THAT ANOINTING OIL WAS PLACED UPON HIM, HE WAS ALREADY, AMEN, a king. Now, it was going to be many years before he would become a before he'd become the king, but the anointing oil was upon him. And then brother Brandham would say, "Amen, the the scripture, those who he has called, he has justified and who is justified, he's also glorified." AMEN. IN THE PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD, your names indelibly wrote with the blood of Jesus Christ. You're glorified in his presence, POSITIONALLY PLACED here on earth for a purpose to do the will of God. DO YOU SEE YOUR POSITION, CHRISTIAN? THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS ASKING. CHRISTIAN, DO YOU SEE YOUR POSITION? WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SO, SAMUEL WAS THE representative of God. Amen. HE HE HAD GONE BY COMMISSION. AMEN. HE HE WAS CALLED OF GOD. HE SAID, "I WANT YOU TO GO TO A CERTAIN TRIBE and a and a certain people, TO A CERTAIN HOUSEHOLD." AND HE WAS GUIDED BY GOD'S GREAT AMEN. UH UH UH BY THE GREAT GOD WHO COMMISSIONED HIM. AMEN. TO A CERTAIN BOY WITH A CERTAIN SEED WITHIN HIM BECAUSE THAT BOY WAS CHOSEN TO BE KING. &gt;&gt; WELL, bless the name of the Lord. Amen. HE HAD A DIVINE PURPOSE. THAT PROPHET HAD A DIVINE PURPOSE TO LOOK OUT [screaming] THAT KING. TO LOOK OUT Oh my. He didn't look like a king. He was a LITTLE BOY WITH A WITH A SLINGSHOT. HE didn't look like He didn't FEEL LIKE A KING. AMEN. HE WAS HE WAS OUT IN THE PASTURE WHILE WHILE WHILE WHILE THE THE OTHER MEN WERE WERE WERE THEIR FATHER'S TREASURE. YOU UNDERSTANDING WHAT I'M SAYING? BUT THE PROPHET HAD A DIVINE COMMISSION. AND I SAY TODAY, THE PROPHETS GOT A DIVINE COMMISSION TODAY. AMEN. TO LOOK OUT THOSE ELECT OF GOD [screaming] THAT IS ORDAINED FOR RAPTURE. [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. That's right. HALLELUJAH. SO SAMUEL WAS GOD'S REPRESENTATIVE. SAMUEL POURED THE OIL ON DAVID. AMEN. HE POURED THE OIL ON DAVID AND GOD POURED THE oil and then God poured the oil. God poured the anointing. IT WAS HIM in a natural form, but it was GLORY TO GOD. DAVID [screaming] DIDN'T SAMUEL DID NOT MAKE SAM UH DAVID A KING. [screaming] SAMUEL COULD NOT MAKE DAVID A KING. SAMUEL FOLLOWED THE COMMISSION. AMEN. TO POUR THE OIL UPON THE ELECTED SEED OF [screaming] GOD. WELL, PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. I WANT TO SAY THIS MESSAGE. AMEN. THE PROPHET DOES NOT MAKE YOU ELECT. THE PROPHET DOES NOT MAKE YOU A BRIDE MEMBER. AMEN. YOU DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF A BRIDE MEMBER. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, AMEN. GOD SENT HIS WORD IN THIS DAY TO POUR THE OIL UPON THE ELECT OF GOD BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS written in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, David didn't feel it and Amen. But but I just want to tell you it never could leave him. The prophet says, "The anointing come upon David and it never left him." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Someone say, "The anointing anointing &gt;&gt; comes upon the bride." &gt;&gt; And it never leaves you. &gt;&gt; It never leaves you. &gt;&gt; You see, we think THE ANOINTING IS SOME KIND OF A FEELING, something that's going to MAKE YOU SHOUT, SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU IT. THE ANOINTING IS WHAT IS DRAWING THE GIFT OF GOD OUT OF [screaming] YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. Brother Brandon would say, "Scott sometimes takes his people out like that and shaves a few of their own wheels off and shows them that they that they can't do just what they want to do." You know what I mean? Amen. They're not in liberty to do what they want to do because they could come INTO FULL POWER AND BE A LOVE SLAVE OR BE FOREIGN. THEY COULD COME INTO full power and be a love slave TO CHRIST. THEY HAVE TO BE SHAVED OFF AND THEN PRESENTED. SOMETIMES IT TAKES HIM, it takes them to the desert to do that and to shave THEM OFF AND AND then bring THEM OUT, THE ANOINTED ONE TO FULFILL THE PURPOSE THAT HE'S ORDAINED THEM TO BE. AMEN. AND HE SAYS, YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? AND BRETHREN, WE'RE AT THE END. SO HE'S SO HE'S HE'S LETTING US KNOW. HE BRINGS THEM OUT. THEN HE STOPS. WHO'S THIS THEM THAT THEY'RE BRINGING OUT? THE ANOINTED ONES BRINGS THEM OUT. THE ANOINTED ONE TO FULFILL THE [screaming] PURPOSE that he's ordained them to be. &gt;&gt; Now, after the anointing COME UPON DAVID, AMEN. THE ANOINTING COME UPON DAVID. HOW MANY HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT TO BE THE TRUTH? &gt;&gt; But now here, he's going TO GO THROUGH THE TESTINGS AND THE TRIALS AND HE'S GOING TO LIVE IN CAVES AND HE'S GOING TO BE HUNTED LIKE AMEN. LIKE AN ANIMAL. BUT YOU SEE, THAT DID NOT CHANGE [screaming] THE FACT GOD HAD ALREADY PLACED HIS ANOINTING UPON HIM. &gt;&gt; And that anointing was going TO KEEP HIM. THAT ANOINTING WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM FROM THE CAVE AND BRING HIM INTO THE PALACE. THE ANOINTING WAS GOING TO PLACE [screaming] HIM WHERE HE BELONGED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, that anointing today is to place you. It's to position you. Amen. To position YOU. HE WAS ALL AT THAT MOMENT, he was already positionally a king, though it would be another 20 years before he sat on the throne. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's that special Amen. That that's that something special that had separated you. That anointing separates you to himself. Amen. the I I as I was looking as I was thinking I came out of Pentecost and and and we we term the anointing. Amen. We put the anointing with the feelings and the emotions. We we we we put Amen. When we felt a good service, amen, when we were on a high, we we connected that with the anointing. Amen. or when we when we spent time in prayer AND IT WAS A GOOD prayer meeting and the and we could JUST FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD, WE WOULD CALL THAT THE ANOINTING. AND I WILL SAY, AMEN, THE BLESSINGS OF GOD ARE WONDERFUL, BUT THE ANOINTING OF GOD, AMEN, IS NOT AN EMOTION. THE ANOINTING. NOT THAT YOUR EMOTIONS DO NOT GET AROUSED WHEN THE ANOINTING uh uh when when the uh when the anointing IS HERE, BUT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, we're looking at the anointing or the the the THE PLACING OF GOD'S HAND UPON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, now the in the Hebrews, I as I was looking, Amen. in in this anointing and and there in the in the in the lexicon, it it talks about among the Hebrews, it it was believed not only that it affected a transference to the anointed one of something of holiness and virtue of deity and whose name and by whose representative the the right or the act was performed, but also that IT IMPARTED A SPECIAL ENDOWMENT of the spirit spirit of God. Amen. So, so it was it was not just an oil or a smearing or a pouring. Amen. IT WAS ACTUALLY GOD COMING. AMEN. And sanctioning it. IT WAS IT WAS GOD SENDING THE MESSENGER. IT WAS GOD ORDAINING THE MESSENGER TO ANOINT. AND THEN GOD HIMSELF WOULD COME UPON [screaming] THAT PERSON TO ANOINT THEM. &gt;&gt; YEAH. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE GOD'S GREAT BLESSINGS, HIS HIS AUTHORITY, HIS HIS presence with them. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's that's the what? Amen. We could see that all through the scripture uh with this anointing. Now, Amen. that we also find that that that with this anointing also, Amen. uh uh become synonymous with the king. They would anoint the king. They they would take the oil. Any king that would come in Israel, they would anoint that king. And and it and just as the priest and and so it would become synonymous. David was that anointed king. Well, praise the Lord. Jesus, the son of David, was the anointed king. They were expecting him to be the king of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were they were asking him when when are YOU GOING TO SET UP YOUR KINGDOM? BUT HE SAYS MY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THE JEWS. [screaming] MY KINGDOM IS OF AN ELECT. AMEN. IT'S THE SPIRITUAL ROYAL SEED of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's not coming back to rule over the Jews. He's coming. He's come He's the king of saints. &gt;&gt; He's the king of the elect. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN JESUS COME AND HE SAYS THE ANOINTING OF THE LORD GOD, THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD GOD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HAS ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. WHAT WHAT WAS HE SAYING? THERE IS A TRANSFERENCE. THERE IS AN ANOINTING UPON [screaming] THIS ONE to to liberate. AMEN. HIS WORDS. AS HE PREACHED THE WORD, THE ANOINTING WOULD COME UPON THAT ELECT and bring the desired results that God had. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captive, and the recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN WHEN JESUS SO, WHAT WAS HE? JESUS WAS GOD'S REPRESENTATIVE. AMEN. The the the the Old Testament says, "This is my servant that I have sent TO THE HOUSE OF JESSE." MY SERVANT THAT I HAVE SENT TO THE HOUSE OF JACOB. AMEN. SO WHAT WHAT IS HE HE WAS SAYING? HE WAS anointed to BRING THE DELIVERANCE. HOW WAS HE TO BRING THE DELIVERANCE? AMEN. HE WOULD POUR [screaming] HE WOULD HE WOULD PREACH the gospel. HE WOULD PRE WELL, PRAISE the Lord. So there was Zakius standing up in the middle of sitting up in the tree, the elect of God. And he was a bad man. He was a crook. Amen. Worked for the government. And uh uh and there he there he was. He and and and Jesus looked up at him and he says, "Zakius, come down out of that tree." Amen. For I'm going home to eat with you today. &gt;&gt; I'm going home to eat with you today. And we and we pick it up there in Luke uh 19:7. AND WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY ALL MURMURED, saying that he was going to be guest with a man that is a sinner. AND ZAKIUS STOOD AND SAID UNTO THE LORD, "BEHOLD, LORD, the half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have taken anything uh uh from from any man by false accusation, I'll restore uh four-fold." And Jesus said, "This day salvation UH IS SALVATION COME TO THIS HOUSE, for as MUCH AS HE ALSO IS A SON OF ABRAHAM. FOR THE SON OF MAN IS COME TO SEEK AND SAVE THEM WHICH WERE LOST. JESUS SAYS, I COME, AMEN, NOT TO DO MY WILL, BUT I AM LOOKING FOR GOD'S ELECT. [screaming] ALL THAT THE FATHER HATH GIVEN ME WILL COME. WHAT IS HE DOING? HE WAS there pouring God's anointing oil &gt;&gt; upon Well, you praise the Lord. You're saying now what what what do you mean God's anointing oil? Amen. The Bible says that that his doctrine shall fall like rain. Amen. The anointings the as the dew. Amen. It shall come. God's word will would there would come a time where God's word would reach the elect. And as he is STANDING THERE PREACHING THE GOSPEL. IT IS GOD'S ANOINTING TO GOD'S ELECT. AMEN. It would IT WOULD IT WOULD CAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE THAT PREDESTINATED SEED TO COME INTO ACTION. THERE HE WAS. HE COULD NO LONGER BE WHAT HE WAS. AMEN. NOW [screaming] HE'S GOT A DIFFERENT HEART ABOUT HIM. WHAT THE ANOINTING HAD COME UPON him and brought out that life &gt;&gt; of the seed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh my. Amen. Salvation has come to this house for so much as he also is a son of David. For the son or Abraham's the son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost. G Jesus just you know we read those scriptures here a couple weeks ago. Amen. Jesus just passed by the Peter. Amen. Follow thou me. And here he was dropped his nets his left his father left everything right there and took off on what was it? It was the anointing coming his way. Amen. Energizing the elect of the day. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Hallelujah. Amen. You see, brother Random, why are people so TOSSED ABOUT? HE SAID, SOME PEOPLE GETS THE WRONG IMPRESSION OF WHAT THE ANOINTING IS. Did you ever think of that? That when uh when was the greatest anointing ever gave to anyone? And what did they do when they had the anointing? The greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ. We have the spirit by measure. He had it without measure. And one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read, "The spirit of God is upon me, for he hath anointed me to preach the acceptable year, to bind up the broken hearts, to heal the sick, AND GIVE SIGHT TO THE BLIND." NOW, we would think IF SUCH AN ANOINTING WAS UPON HIM, IT HAD BEEN PROPHESIED 800 years before, AMEN, THAT IT WOULD COME. AND and uh here HE WAS WITH THAT TYPE OF ANOINTING, THE FULL BLESSINGS AND THE ANOINTING OF THE LORD UPON HIM. We we would want to run all over the building and scream and holler, BUT THE BIBLE SAID he laid DOWN THE SCROLL AND SAT DOWN AND PRECIOUS words proceeded from his mouth. &gt;&gt; That's what he done under the anointing. The anointing IS NOT AN EMOTION. THE ANOINTING IS THE SUPREME POWER in control. Knowing exactly what and how. See, that's what is here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Did you catch that? Now, he's talking about Jesus, but now he's also bringing in now the anointing of this last day is is here AS WELL. IT'S THE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING OUT. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. Deuteronomy 32:1. Give, give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak. Here, O earth, THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH. MY DOCTRINE SHALL DROP AS RAIN. MY SPEECH SHALL DISTILL AS THE DEW, AS THE SMALL RAIN UPON THE TENDER HERB, AS THE SHOWERS upon the grass. This is the anointing. IT'S THE ANOINTING COMING DOWN TO MAKE THAT SEED TO LIVE. AMEN. HE SAYS, "MY WORDS, I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME. MY WORDS ARE HERE TO ANOINT YOU." AMEN. MY WORDS ARE HERE TO BRING LIFE TO THE PLANET. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, if you're just sitting here and listening to words, Amen. Or maybe there's Amen. [laughter] Hallelujah. Maybe there's some uh uh someone here today that you there ain't no seed there. AMEN. THE ANOINTING CAN FALL AND IT MEANS NOTHING TO YOU. BUT WHEN THIS ANOINTING FALLS, IT is to energize the elect. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, [snorts] praise the Lord. Now there there in as he talks about this anointing that is coming. Now he also gives the prophecy there in in Isaiah 28 and9. It says to whom shall he teach knowledge? To whom shall he make un to understand doctrine? Them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast. For precept must be upon precept. Precept upon precept. Line upon line. Line upon line. Here a little and there a little. For with stammering lips and another tongue will I speak to this people to to whom he said, "This is the rest. This is that anointing wherewith you have caused you shall cause the weary to rest. This is the refreshing." Yet they would not hear. But the word of God was unto them. Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little. that they might go fall backwards and be broken and snared and taken. So, so, so he WAS SAYING NOW THERE THE words came there the anointing fell. Amen. But the majority IT DID NOTHING TO. BUT THE ELECT SAID, "WHERE COULD WE GO? &gt;&gt; FOR THOU HAST THE WORDS of eternal life." It meant more than money. It meant more than jobs. It meant more than boyfriend and girlfriend. It meant more, amen, than the Sanhedrin. IT MEANT MORE THAN ANYTHING. AND IT MEANS MORE THAN ANYTHING TODAY. THIS ANOINTING THAT IS HERE ON THE EARTH. IT'S THE SON OF MAN ANOINTING. IT'S THAT GREAT MIGHTY ANGEL THAT HAS BEEN PROPHESIED TO COME TO MAKE THAT word live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anointed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you may be sitting here and say, "Man, I don't feel anointed." You don't have to feel anointed. The anointing is here. &gt;&gt; What is it producing in you? Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The anointing has been here for seven ages. The Holy Spirit has been here in in measure throughout the seven ages. &gt;&gt; But there has got to be a rapturing anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why God came in our in our day. Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Now, you cannot make a holy church. There is no such thing as a holy church or a holy organization." The Holy Spirit can be preached in it, but in there you find good and bad, renegades, indifferent, everything else. So, an organization will not hold. You can't say, "We got it." None of the rest of them has it. No sir. The Holy Spirit is poured out on individuals. It's the individuals. GOES ON DOWN. IT SAYS ALL DOWN THROUGH THE AGES THEY re receive the Holy Spirit, but not in the measure that they have it now because it's the restoration of the first. &gt;&gt; If we take the candlesticks, alpha and omega, they how they lit the first candle, it went higher and higher and then it got dimmer and dimmer. Then it come back again, the first and the last and so forth. But in this church age, the message is being poured into the church, &gt;&gt; the church body itself. See the tabernacle. Amen. We we'll say this tabernacle will say uh that's where she comes to church. This tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost tabernacle. There's no such thing. Individuals that come into this church is the Holy Ghost tabernacles. They are the tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost, but not the church in the body, a group. Therefore, it runs out. And this man WAS POURING [screaming] THE WATER, THE MESSENGER to the church, pouring the message into the church. &gt;&gt; Now, what he's doing, he's interpreting, Amen. He's interpreting a a a sister's dream that that had come and and and and he and he says there was a tall mountain and and and she she was going up the mountain and there was this rock box and uh and and and and this this messenger was coming and pouring the purest and the cleanest of water. He said now amen he he says uh he says that water was the Holy Ghost. That water was the Holy Ghost, but he said it kept pouring out because they were putting it in a denomination. So, Amen. So, then he went and got a a bucket of honey and he and he put it in there. And she said, "Well, all the honey's going to go out, too." But the honey stood, AMEN. UH, FILLED UP ALL OF THE HOLES. AND HE SAYS, "THAT'S BROTHERLY KINDNESS." He said this age is THE AGE THAT'S GOT TO PRODUCE BROTHERLY KINDNESS IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO KEEP THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THE MESSENGER IS THE SEVENTH CHURCH AGE MESSENGER POURING [screaming] THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; POURING NOT [screaming] THE NOT WHAT IS THAT WATER? IT'S IT'S A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST. WHAT IS WHAT IS OIL? IT'S A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND WHAT IS HE DOING? HE IS POURING THE HOLY GHOST. HE'S POURING THE message into the church. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandis is interpreting it a paragraph before he says, "Now, that water was the Holy Ghost." And then he stopped and then I I just got and then I came in here and read the next phase to you because it's a long it's a long uh uh quote there. It says, "And this man was pouring the water, the message into the church." He was using, Amen. synonymously water, HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE MESSAGE ALL AS ONE. &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW YOU YOU MIGHT SAY, "AMEN." NOW, I I I now, brother Wendell, I'm I'm um I I I need a little bit more uh understanding of this. Amen. Now, he says uh uh uh he he says uh he says there in God keeps his word. He says you don't come to church to hear a message or to see a messenger. Amen. You you come to hear the message. The message is the Holy Spirit taking the word of God and giving it to you. The message is the Holy Spirit. It's the messenger on commission of God to pour that message into the elect. The anointing is on the earth. But not everyone is going to hear it. Not everyone is GOING TO BENEFIT. NOT EVERYONE SITTING IN HERE will benefit if you don't OPEN YOUR HEART UP and say, "God, here I am." &gt;&gt; WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. AND BROTHERLY KINDNESS.

Surely they shall not see the land &gt;&gt; which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it. Now, now here he's saying the glory of the Lord is upon the earth. &gt;&gt; And they've all seen my glory, but they'll not enter into the land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I'm glad it didn't stop there, Sister Keys.

He says it won't work for the bride age. But he says [music] but you take this word and it'll wash you from those old prostitutes. It'll clean your garments. It'll make you &gt;&gt; It'll make you what you want to be. There's power in that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Feed on it. &gt;&gt; See, [music] the problem is is this. We wonder why we don't have power and authority. And the authority is in the anointing. &gt;&gt; The anointing is on is upon the word. &gt;&gt; So, when we're putting these other stuff in our minds, [music] we're constantly on games. We're constantly on our phone. We're [music] and we're we're we're we're filling our we are we're embracing the prostitutes. [music] We're embracing that stuff. A a game is not is is is not is [music] not bad. [music] There are there are things, but Satan has connected. He's found a way to connect himself to our spirits. &gt;&gt; And the message of the hour, if you listen to the message of the hour, it'll [music] convict you of that stuff majorly. &gt;&gt; It'll convict you. It It's It's there. I mean, to me, it's [music] just as plain as plain can be. But we've got to separate ourselves from that. And then in order for the word to wash us, we've got to be [music] listening to the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let that word listen to us. And so you new ones, if you don't have the message on your phone and you're not listening [music] to a message, you're not hearing the seventh angel's words, and I'd encourage I don't know if you've got it on your phone or Patrick or [music] and and brother Bosow, but u any of you new ones, you [music] need you need need to be listening to that message. Let it wash you. But it [music] is that right? &gt;&gt; And those of us that do listen to it, it can't become common. &gt;&gt; You know, [music] I I was telling the Lord the other day, I I I when it when it's when it first started coming, Brother Michael, I when when that that message came to me, I couldn't I couldn't listen. I couldn't [music] hardly listen without crying. Every time I listened, it was just Oh, he was I was being washed over and over. I Oh, I was being convicted. Oh my.
