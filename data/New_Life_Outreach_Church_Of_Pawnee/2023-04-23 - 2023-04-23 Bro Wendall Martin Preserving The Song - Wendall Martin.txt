appreciate you letting me keep you so long and um so I'm not going to do it again tonight I'm not going to hold you that long tonight amen instead of two and a half hours to just be an hour and a half and no amen amen [Laughter] amen so uh Luke 21 and 25. how many glad did you belong to uh to the kingdom of God I'm so glad I belong to the kingdom of God and um amen let's let's let's read here it says and there shall be signs in the Sun in the moon in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity and the Sea and the waves roaring and men's Hearts failing them for fear for the looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up somebody say look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh let's look here in Revelations the 21st chapter the first verse amen glory to God and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death uh neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son can I hear an amen father we look to you today Iman with our hearts with with great joy in the midst of all of the perversions of the Earth as we've seen the signs in the Sun and the Moon we've seen the distress of Nations Lord the waves are roaring the tornadoes have been ripping through the land men's hearts are failing them for fear but Lord You've also said when you see these things lift up your head and you didn't just say look up but you said it again lift those heads up for Redemption draws nigh I ask that you would be with us tonight now as we Endeavor to to minister for a few moments in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight as we think along these lines amen we see the turmoil in the world and we realize we need something to Anchor the heart lots of emotions swirling constantly it seems these days it just seems like there's so much UPS Downs ins outs there's been so much there's so many things that can get your mind amen uh torn up so many things that can get your heart hurting amen and and I think sometimes as the as as the prophet Paul was talking to the young Pastor Timothy and uh who was under the the the pressure of the office as pastoring there in the church and you know I he was under a lot of pressure a whole lot of people that was accepting him due to his Youth and and um discouragement had really set in to Timothy uh into his heart and and the Apostle Paul he I I love the wise uh old Apostle as he as he looks there in second Timothy 1 and 6 and he says wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God in other words I want you to go back I want you to you to look back amen and stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind everybody say he's not giving us a spirit of fear amen with fear comes anxiety with fear comes turmoil with fear comes uncertainty about the future but God's not given us anxiety he has given us amen the spirit of power of love and of a sound mind amen I think it would do us really good right now to just look around us amen and say God has been faithful to me all of your life all of your life God has been faithful to you it don't matter where you've been it don't matter in any of the heartaches you've endured it don't matter amen things that look so impossible it doesn't matter those things that you thought were going to take you out that you thought you would never rise up again and here you are sitting in this church here tonight because God's been true God's been faithful and God's going to continue to bring you through amen hallelujah amen you might be looking at a mountain that looks so high that you have never cried before but I just want to tell you God was faithful yesterday and God's going to be faithful tonight you might be looking in situations that just seem like amen by the wind of my my my my my my my faith is just barely hanging on Amen you've never hung on the god in the first place it's been God hanging on to you you've never been the one that has amen that that has that that is that you're not you're not strong enough you're not good enough you're not powerful enough it takes God to hold on to you can you say amen amen I say tonight why let the spirit of fear to come in monsters why allow amen the spirit of fear amen sister Karen to shake our faith why why should we allow amen anything to come and and to to to to move our faith from that confidence that we have in the Lord Jesus Christ I say he is still the finisher and or he is the author and he's still The Finisher can I hear an amen somebody say he's the author of my faith and he will be the finisher of my faith he that is begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete that work God does not start any project that he is not able to finish well praise the Lord Amen brother Branham says we're creatures of time amen he's a god of Eternity we try to press ourselves we try to make something different oh this has to be done remember he knows all about it it's going to happen anyhow let him just do it just commit yourself to him look up and shine with the joy of the Lord to know that you have been privileged and your eyes have come open to see this day trust in him for the future you've seen him vindicate his word in the past amen he that Vindicated his words in the days past made all these other things happen just exactly to the hour that we're living in everything's exactly amen you look there to the seventh Angels message both shown in the heaven and on Earth and made it known uh three ways so that there will be no slipper remember he promised he had come again and then he says hallelujah that word will Vindicated God's promised word with two thousand years of waiting he will arrive on time someone said Hallelujah amen don't worry don't worry he will be here he hasn't Vindicated his word in every age the church had just showed the same thing the revealing of Our Lord by the seventh message and so forth God reveal it manifested and proved it and in among us today he showed himself here with us and proved and Vindicated his word and so will he amen be can you say amen I say of God's got our future amen we should be some happy-go-lucky folks if God's got your future amen we don't know what tomorrow holds but we know he holds tomorrow if God has been faithful in the past then God's going to finish it up if God's kept the six ages before us then this seventh age is going to end in a Rapture like he promised he would do amen he's got the future and he's got a plan I said he holds your future and he has a plan amen so therefore I rest amen I arrest I rest in the promises of God Amen what was brother Brandon trying to do he was trying to assure amen the Overcomers and laodicea in the midst of certainty God has got this in the midst of your child God has got this in the midst when everything's going crazy God has got this brother random preach amen uh uh Shalom they're in 64. he says there will be a millennium the old will be young forever sickness will fade away and death will be no more they shall build houses and and they will inhabit them they'll plant Vineyards and eat the fruit thereof they'll not plant in another inhabited amen or a son take it his son will be living with him he'll not plant and another eat and die off and someone else takes it but he will live there amen the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like the bullet the child shall lead them around there will be innocence there will be nothing that can hurt we'll be changed from what we are now to the Glorious image of the Son of God which is Immortal years can never touch him age can never do anything to him he's the immortal Son of God and so we amen so will we we're at the end time we're at the junction all these things have fairly been Vindicated and identified and so will it be identified again until then my heart will keep on singing unto then with joy I'll carry on oh come on church amen now's not today to be getting down in the Molly clubs now's not the day to be second guessing your salvation now's not the day to be amen looking to the right or to the left but it's today's the day to stand up and say this could be the day when we go home this could be the day that the Rapture takes place this could be the hour I will go on can you say man amen until then amen now now he brother read him and said now the future he holds it how do I know when he's coming when is he coming I don't know but he'll be here that's right when will he do this and thus when will the curse go off of the earth when will these blessings uh uh when will these blessed reflections of God's love and trees standing here and Shining out in the Flowers and Things when will they be immortal or grow amen I don't know but they will amen when when will all the reflections of man's Hearts desires to live and the hospitals and doctors and operations and crying to live in hospitals and grief when when it will when will it all cease to a glorious reign of Jesus Christ a thousand years of Shalom when will it I don't know but he said it would be there I don't know how he's going to do it but his spoken word will be Vindicated when the son of righteousness shall shall rise with healing in his wings and the healing part there will not be a physical healing amen as you think amen as saying somebody's got a sickness it'll be taken away from them amen you see that's what he's doing now in time but the whole creature will be changed this Mortal will take on immortality this old age will jump into youth amen well how will it be I don't know but it will be there now that first church was under extreme pressure amen and and the Winds of adversity a man could not stop it it didn't matter what they tried to do they were beaten they were killed and they were thrown in jail but nothing could take away the faith in that church it was a church that was started by God hallelujah and nothing could put it out nothing could stop the song until then My Heart Will Go On sinking oh such a revelation it was such a revelation amen that it turned the world upside down it was like a house on fire on a windy day what can you say Amen now through the opening of the seals we see how the insects have tried to destroy that tree and denominational day at Devils ate away at the tree and the Book of Revelations reveals this amen the three women that there would be amen the great and then she would have daughters and they would be the harlots but there would also be a bride amen it would be it would be a bribe that God had known that was coming all along amen there's there's always and if you want to look in the New Testament Church not just recrevelations but in the New Testament Church amen it speaks of three you have got the Jews if you which is Judaism then you've got amen of the foolish virgin and then you've got the wise virgin that was prepared that had the oil in her lap that was ready for the bridegroom when he come now listen I don't want to sit in a church and not have oil in my lamp I don't want to just be a virgin I don't want to be sitting here and miss the Rapture when he comes now come on Church the Bible says that she was a foolish virgin she was a virgin but she was foolish man in other words she had separated herself from the world Amen but she had no oil in her lap she wasn't prepared she was she was taken up with other things friends there's one thing that we've got to make sure we're taken up with and that is making sure our garments are spotless pure and clean and that the holy spirit is in our vessels as we wait for the coming of the lord we know he's coming we know his coming is at hand which it's not for another age this is the day to prepare for the coming of the Lord amen we're in the day I said we're in the day God would not have set a messenger in this day if he was not planning to come for you man the scripture says I'll send you the uh the promise was I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the gospel the word Jesus Christ can you say amen amen not just any faith is going to be it's got to be the original faith of the original Church the same Faith the original church had is the faith that you've got here tonight come on church to believe the word exactly like he said it man now Spirits are here overwhelmingly to opposing the truth he mapped the whole purpose of of of of doing anything is to Iman you you look there at the Holocaust deniers now those Holocaust deniers they have been going uh for years now saying the Holocaust Holocaust never happened they're saying it never happened there was never Jews that were tortured there was never things now we know for a fact according to history it did happen right look it up on the internet and see how many really believes it happened somebody saying lies somebody continually putting a crowd on the Holocaust has got millions believing that it didn't happen and I just want to tell you amen there's a cloud over the world today and this Cloud that is over the world today is to get you from really looking at the realities that Jesus is coming soon this Cloud that is out there today in the politics and this and that and the other is to get our focus on something else and not get our focus upon the promise of God brother we have one business that business is to follow Jesus Christ to love Jesus Christ to serve Jesus Christ to give him everything we've got that's what we're called for well praise the Lord there's a song Amen that is in the heart of the believer come on I'm going home I'm going home you can tell you I amen Donald Trump you can have America I'm going home amen whoever else you want to put in there amen you can have it I'm going home this world is not my home I'm just a passing through amen there's a song We Sing peace of God cover me cover me cover me through the storm cover me cover me when I'm hurting cover me when I'm not strong I want your peace in me I'm keeping my eyes on the goal now this is the completion of redemption this is the rapturing age that will produce a rapturing faith and the scripture says there were Romans 10 and 17 we all know it so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God can you say Amen every age has had to have Messengers God says I will do nothing amen from way back there in Moses time when when the Israel when the fire was upon the mountain amen and the Earth tremble as of the voices and the Thundering and the people said hey man Moses speak to us speak not to us lest we die God came down and says from henceforth I will not speak for you lift the ear like this but I'll raise up prophets to you and those prophets will come amen and declare the word at the time that it was to be I'm paraphrasing it but that's what he was saying and from then on Amen God's always raised up prophets those prophets were there to bring the Vindication of his word amen there in Amos 3 and 8 says three and seven I will do nothing except I first reveal it to the prophets so when God brings in every one of those ages when you've seen a messenger come on the scene they were under an inspiration of the word to preach that word to the people to give them a faith to overcome that age hallelujah amen that's what the anointings were all about amen that's what the lion anointing was the king of the the king of the jungle that was in the Apostle Paul's Ministry standing there hallelujah amen but you see there was uh but he says but after my departure Grievious wolves shall enter in is that right and then there come you know the anointing of the sacrificial animal going through the Dark Ages amen and then there was the Reformation the the the the the the the man age where men stood up and brought the Bible to us hallelujah but I want to tell you we're not living under those other anointings what are we living under amen can anyone tell me any of you kids tell me what anointing we're living under if it's not the line and it's not the sacrificial ox and it's not the uh the man anointing what anointing are we under the eagle anointing hallelujah amen the lion had to go down and he says after after I die for Grievous wolves are coming in It Happened amen here come the ox it went down to death here come the man it went down to death but we're living under a Rapture anointing he did not say an eagle he said a flying eagle a flying eagle this is the day of rapture well won't you punch your neighbor and say you ought to be more happy than you are [Laughter] we're living in a good day amen well praise the Lord oh God Amen we have a message that secures us we have a message that is calling us we have a message oh preacher of the Gospel oh sons of God oh daddies and mamas your message counts your sermons count you stand between the living and the dead you stand as one that is declaring to your people your community your churches that it's almost time to go home Hallelujah can you say man now right there before the light I'm I'm not going to hold you along tonight amen hallelujah amen but but but right right there before the the the breaking of the day right before the breaking of the day amen is when it gets the darkest it's when amen how many knows that right before it you know what it's doing all of darkness is congregating together and they're trying to hold back the Sun hallelujah amen but they're doing it in vain because the Sun is going to rise it's already been spoken the sun will rise again I want to tell you Satan is doing everything in this world Amen he's doing everything in his cans to try to hold your faith to hold this Rapture back to hold you from your amen overcoming power but I want to tell you it can congregate all at one all of the darkness of all the ages have come into this last day but I stand here and declare that we shall

floor and they prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed said the Lord we don't know what this is about the Lord anything that's in our lives that are not right anything that is and I need they to get
