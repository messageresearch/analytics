really wonderful amen we just love the Lord here tonight amen why don't we just go on to the uh to the scriptures here this evening uh we're going to look here in Ephesians the first chapter also would like to read in the Book of Romans the 11th chapter um we sure enjoyed uh the services we've went back and listened to the services on Sunday and sure enjoyed brother William and and uh brother Harry's messages and and we appreciate uh them ministering the word of the Lord here how many's glad for the for for the ministers here at new life amen and uh we we definitely uh um appreciated that we had wonderful Service uh there in in uh at brother Wayne's church and at and so um appreciate all of the prayers and things that's went for Dad and and his family and my aunt and them the we uh went had the funeral and and um everything went fine but we we want to continue to pray for for my aunt and her whole family I know it's rough when you're when you're missing amen um uh your husband that you've been with for so long and and so we want to continue to pray for my Cheryl let's look here in Ephesians 1 and and one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus to the faithful in Christ Jesus amen want you won you to say in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the god and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us uh before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now I'd also like to look here in the Book of Romans the 11th chapter and we're just going to read one verse and that's here at Verse 18 and it says boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou boast or thou bearest not the root but the root thee let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you tonight for your love to us and your grace Upon Our Lives we thank you Lord for Lord having us in your heart upon your book the book of remembrance Lord before the world ever began thank you for Calvary thank you for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're asking Lord that you would just be with us here tonight now Lord and you would Minister to us I'm asking Lord that you would Lord just Lift us all up into your presence Lord both speaker and hearer that we may see what you are speaking to the church tonight and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you amen we are wanting to speak tonight um on our position in Christ and and um we uh the The Roots is what bears the tree and and I want to speak a little on the root system amen we been talking a lot about Ministry we've been talking about a love that that is that comes from way down deep inside and that every one of us have a Ministry and there is a reason that this love comes and oozes out of us is because amen we are in we were pred destinated in Our Roots we are in Christ Jesus you can't help but oo Redemption because there's where you are amen your life is hid uh with Christ in God and so amen there so today we we're thankful for the roots we're not we're not here because of our good abilities or or or our understanding we're not here because amen we we um have grasped the message we are here by predestination we are here because God thought of you before the foundation of the world Now The Roots is what bears the tree now many today are rooted in opinion they're rooted in Creeds and dogmas amen and and so that that is what they are and of course it'll never produce the Life of Christ because the Life of Christ is not in the seed amen it's the wrong life you can't you can't have the wheat life and and and be a weed and you can't be amen produce the weed life and be a wheat you you have got to be one or the other and so amen we we understand that the tear can say that I'm the wheat amen but the life is is weed life and so it can't pred it it can't produce anything for a little while they'll look the same amen but but it was always a wheat and a wheat was always a weed and so uh when when we look here at this scripture in that first verse we we ought to be thankful for this because Ephesians 1:1 again to the faithful in Christ Jesus you're faithful because you're in Christ Jesus can you say amen now brother Brenham talks about h a being in in Christ amen and he and he says when you're when you're baptized into Christ amen uh into Christ by the Holy Ghost there's where you find rest from all your labors because now his life is expressing itself through you and he would say in Oneness he would say Amen Jesus going to the grave of Lazarus I'm the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he be dead yet he shall live and what and who whatsoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth in me not on me but in me being in me believing if you abide in me and my words in you in him believing I hope the Holy Spirit gets that right down to you amen he says believing in him you cannot believe in him until you come in him or he comes in you and then you're believing in him then you have eternal life Believing on him until you receive eternal life and then eternal life is God's life in you and then you're believing in him so so when the seed is energized by the power of the holy spirit amen it gives the the germination of that seed gives the seed permission to live its life amen the rain doesn't give amen doesn't give the wheat seed its life because the rain gives amen it it it gives permission to the to whatever seed to produce after its own kind amen God gives the seed God creates the seed God ordained the seed the rain and the sun simply ignites what is already there and it gives permission for it amen to produce itself and so when the the Holy Spirit comes Upon Us amen the Holy Spirit simply germinates that seed that is within your heart by predestination amen by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body amen you're submerged into this you are amen you're not sprinkled you're not you're not poured you're not stamped you're you it's not a tattoo amen but but it becomes amen the the life within you you become synonymous with the root you become amen you and the root is exactly the same thing can you say amen amen that's why Jesus says no man can pluck you out of my hand amen you and the life are one and nothing shall separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus well aren't you glad for that amen shall tribulation separate us no amen so famine separate us no shall tribulation separate us no shall sickness separate us no shall sin separate us no there is that love you are in himen now I want you to understand that because as we begin to talk about our position amen our position is the Abiding Place it's not work related at all amen now we we've been talking about Ministry but you see Ministry can only come when we find who we are and we are satisfied amen with what God is doing now now many pray and every day and they say that's abiding in and I say no amen somebody you say what it's reading my Bible every day amen that must be abiding no amen well I I do good deeds that must be abiding no that's not how you abide you are baptized into Christ you and God become one well that should make you want to shout now the acts Amen in the natural these are tokens of our love Ministry is our token amen it's an expression back for what God has done for us amen I I I want to tell you today you cannot have confidence in the Deeds Done amen because remember the Jews had a law amen and they that they lined themselves up by a and they had the dos and the don'ts down to the tea according to the scripture but you see you amen are not in a religious activity you are an expression of the Eternal God Amen now how many's understanding that M that's what God wants you to understand you are represented in Christ the seed alone you're not represented in your ability you're not represented in your in your ministry amen you you can you can you can cast out Devils you can you can perform Miracles you can work work work work work work work and that does not make you the seed of Jesus Christ that's right you're the seed of Jesus Jesus Christ because of the roots you were in Him Praise the Lord now the Greeks wanted an audience with Jesus and Jesus was fixing to to go he was fixing to be crucified and and there in John 12:23 uh when when the disciples come in and and and told him they wanted to see him and this was his response Jesus answered saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified verely verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if it die it brings forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life now Jesus is is is expressing something I'm fixing a leave and if you were to go on down there he begins to talk about how that he's leaving amen but he is letting them know I I am fixing to be put into the ground yeah I've got to die I'm the root and there's only one way that the Life of Christ can be exhibited manifested throughout the Earth and that is through with by death and there will come a plant life up of its of its kind can you say amen amen I want you to see that plan amen because you are in the sea you are in him you are predestinated in The Roots can you say amen he represents every kernel of wheat that should ever come along when you plant that one seed into the ground I don't think I have amen hallelujah you plant that seed into the ground in that seed amen is is is every kernel of wheat that will ever ever be produced is in that seed right there and when you planted when God planted Jesus Christ into the ground up come the church 50 days later Here Comes amen the Pentecostals speaking in tongues the power of God the glory of God there was there were 3,000 so added to the church and it was all because there was a seed that was planted Hallelujah can you say Amen now Jesus was that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so the life of the wheat plant will come into maturity because it was predestinated in The Roots if you're not in the wheat plant you can't come to to maturity come on but if you're in the wheat plant there's nothing left but maturity because God is bringing he's going to bring that plant well praise the Lord you man now in the natural when the when the seed when that seed uh uh burst open and the life is is germinated amen and and you can literally watch it you can get on YouTube and and and they've got cameras there that'll that that'll show you how that seed and how it dies and begins to rot and then amen as that life begins to uh uh as that all of a sudden that that seed just pops open and stuff begins to ooze out of it amen it's it's it's the most incredible thing amen and it begins to ooze out of it and that little bitty seed begins to Spring out little bitty little bitty Roots little tentacles out of it and before you know it it begins to come up and and you can push you can push the little PL play deal because amen it it this happens over a period of months but they've got it to where uh uh they're taking pictures just you know every little bit and so you can push it where it makes a little movie and and you can just see it when you hit it amen all of a sudden it busts open little things begin to come out and then after a while you begin to see the fullness of what the seed was supposed to produce at the beginning right and everything that the wheed has everything it'll ever be everything that you go and all and that's beautiful it all happened on because of the seat amen amen now now y y'all catching me here hallelujah because I want you to see this God oh God's Got Something Beautiful now remember here here God was doing something there there by the time you got to acts 5 and 34 you know they were they they were uh crucifying the church and and persecuting the church should I say and and and G stands up there in Acts 5:34 and then he says you know a Pharisee named G a doctor of the law had reputation among all the people commanded uh uh to put the apostles forth this little space and said unto them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what you intend to do is touching these men for before these days Rose thas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves and who was slain and all and and as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to not after this rode Judas of of GA Galilee in the days of of the taxing and Drew away people after himself he also perished and and if even as many as obeyed him were dispersed now I say unto you refrain from these men let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to not but if it be of God on you can not overthrow it lest happily ye be you be found to fight against God can you say Amen so that man was a smart man he's he was saying this these people aren't just acting like the normal people these people have been energized by something greater than themselves praise the Lord I you know I I I I want to say here tonight amen we're not just a bunch of religious folks here in in Le odys I believe that the power of the the holy spirit is is right here living his life and did you know that the Rapture is not going to be something amen that is that that that is a a natural event it's the supernatural it is the manifestation or it is the harvesting of the wheat plant and taking it into Glory I I say today we ought to be thankful for it amen now as we as we go on a little bit positioned in Christ every amen everything about that seed represents the plant now I also want us to look before I go too much further here tonight amen this being a Wednesday night and just uh uh uh teaching a little bit but they me Jesus Christ was the established head of that church now okay now this is this is incredible because he didn't just start a movement here on the Earth but now he is our representation in the heavens right amen you look there at at Matthew 21 and and and uh 42 and Jesus said unto them did you ever read the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head or the chief the Supreme the master of the corner and this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our sight if you look there in Ephesians 1 and 20 it says and which he had wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places now that word set it means established made him to set to have a uh to have fixed one's abold at his own right hand so when Christ was raised up you are represented in him tonight so when he is sitting at the right hand of the father when he has been positionally placed so have you you've been placed in Christ amen Now where's the fear and the scare amen the devil tries to tell you well amen God could use you but he can't use you now where what what is where where is everything where the devil's trying to tell you well you send away your day of Grace you had the Holy Ghost but you lost it I'm here to say today that if Christ has been established as the representative of this church he is representing you through your good through your bad through your UPS through your Downs through your ins and your outs he is representing you because his blood was shed for you Hallelujah now this is very important for you teenagers because you teenagers sometimes man your minds just you know you're growing up and the devil begins to battle against your mind and and and and you don't feel worthy sometimes and you don't feel like you're good enough to pray and you don't feel like you're measuring up to to to to Dad's or mom's uh you know uh a standards or desires or or maybe maybe a friend has forsaken you or maybe and and and you go through and it and it bothers you I just want to let you know there is an established one in the heavens that represent you no matter how bad you feel no matter how how bad you fallen how bad things are well can you say amen and the SC now watch this he says amen at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and everything that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and has put all things somebody say all things all under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to what church to the church somebody say gave him to be the head over all things all things so when when you're when you wake up in a bad mood or you wake up you know you've messed up or you have I say today amen that we've got a representative we were part of him the only reason we're here is because of Christ Our [Music] beginning Christ is the beginning he's the author of the creation of God he is the author and the finisher of our faith he will never leave you nor forsake you he is positioned in the heavens he's positioned there not for himself Christ has not been positioned in the heavens for himself the whole reason Christ came was to redeem you he wanted to redeem he wanted a new race he wanted a people amen that would fulfill the purpose that Adam and Eve fulfilled and Christ came to birth you Amen to bring you into existence and now he is seated in the Heavenly place say and he's representing you before God well that should make you want to shout that should make you want him can you say amen amen and and he says and has put all things under his feet gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all Hallelujah where's Christ in the Heavenly places now now catch this now the Apostle Paul then goes and says and now we have been positionally placed in those same Heavenly places we are here in this body and this body has so much torment this mind has so much torment there's so many things about this body that just that that that and yet Christ or the Bible says the Apostle Paul says you are positioned in those heavenly places how are you POS position your position there because Christ your representative is seated there now brother Brandon when he begin to preach on adoption he says now this is really deep this is really deep because we see things in the natural we view things by the way we feel we view things by our emotions we view things by amen our good good or are bad but Christ is representing you whether you feel good or whether you feel bad that's right and I just want to tell you if you ever get into the get in your mind that you're ever going to earn anything from God you might as well go fly a cat go jump in the lake go do something because you can't do nothing to earn God's approval you can't earn anything you can't earn anything from God are y'all understanding me so many Ministry is simply because I know who I am yes thank you Lord that's the only way you can be effective is to know God's love in you and when you've experienced God's love and you've got that expression Hallelujah it didn't matter whether those guys whether Jesus was Healing The Sick or whether he had a bad headache it didn't matter whether amen he had a whole crowd or whether everyone had forsaken him and it turn turn around to his 12 and says are you going to leave me also he was loved by God and that was all that mattered right the human being Jesus Christ is in heaven representing you before God Amen thank you Lord he's the only one that was ever perfect he's the only one that could represent you Mary represent you Kobe is the only one that can do it he is the originator the author of God's new race oh Hallelujah you say boy this is pretty simple really W it's pretty deep for some of you Hallelujah there's nothing you can do about it when we can come to the real it that my Beginnings did not start at an altar somewhere but my Beginnings started in the little seed form 2,000 years ago in the body of Jesus Christ now I'm just now coming up 2,000 years later but I was already in the seed before the foundation of the world it Christ was already the lamb slain before the foundation of the world 2,000 years ago here he came up the life of God has energized me today and I'm an expression of that now you understanding well how long is my salvation as long as he's there as long as he's there I've got a representative as long as he's represent me I'm going to be okay oh brother wend I I just don't want to I I I I I heard the prophet say that I can send my day of Grace away well it depends it depends it it it depends on whether you're a weed or you're a wheat come on a wheat can never did I just say never somebody say never send their day of Grace away yes right you're in Christ now if you're a weed well you're going to Buck against God and everything you ain't going to submit to his word you ain't going to have the desire to do so you ain't going you're just a weat come on and God's grace will someday quit dealing with you that's right the anointing of the Holy Spirit that's upon you making you feel good and all that well someday you because it's in your nature to reject his word that's right but a wheat it's a wheat it don't matter what part of the plant it don't matter whether the plant is a little blade sticking up or whether the plant's in the stock phase or whether the plant's in the weak phase it is a wheat amen praise the Lord Hallelujah you love him Hallelujah here's the little seed Hallelujah and then the rain and the Sun comes and then all of a sudden amen The Roots begin to go out everywhere and amen before you know it here comes a little leaf and then another little leaf is it going to be a wheat or is it already a wheat now I thought wheat I thought wheat looked you know like this and and and and all over like this and and and and little leaves on it and and all that I I I thought that's a wheat that's the final stages of the [Music] wheat but your wheat because because the seed is wheat yes you're wheat now in your mind you're still a faulty human being but God's got a seed on the inside of your ground amen this is you right here you're you're the dirt Hallelujah this is you you are dirt hallelujah amen and when Jesus said amen thy will will be done in somebody say in Earth as it is already in the heavens you've already got a representative up there representing the seed in your can you say Amen now now the devil will tell you young and H well Mom don't love you Dad don't love you no one else loves you but let's just get this thing straight God loves you amen and you'll always be loved by God Amen and your mama loves you too and your daddy loves you too it's just the devil trying to tell you but when he tries but if he's got you convinced that dad's just out to kill you mama just doesn't like you and she would love to sell you on the black market just remember you've got something in here that's causing desire to love him to serve him to give him glory GL that can on that that ain't going to happen on the serpent seed that's not going to happen to give yourself to God and to surrender yourself to God that can only happen through a predestinated seed well glory to God Amen you see Ministry can only come and express itself when we can understand what is taking place within us yeah can you say amen amen Christ is Seated on the right hand of the Majesty on high amen what did the scripture say there in Hebrews 1:13 it says to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol hallelujah what here here another one there in Hebrews 10 and 12 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol okay all right so so so Christ paid the price he comes to the heavens he sits down folds his legs and he he is expecting every one of those enemies that are against you to be defeated and what wh why is he up there sitting because he is interceding for your sins while the devil is beating on you and telling you that you're worthless and telling you that you'll never make it and he's telling you amen that you you can't have a Ministry Jesus is setting there interceding for you until you come into that maturity well I just feel like shouting right now and I'm not even evangelizing right now hallelujah amen you see it's because of our position not our feelings we're positioned in Christ Hallelujah now watch from hence forth expect until his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering someone say hallelujah hallelujah someone say hallelujah hallelujah for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified you're in him amen now the position of the believer in this last day matters it matters a lot and and and you know in fact it it's it's it's when the it's the positioning comes as we talked about here a week or two ago is when the son comes of age he comes to that point am man where the father has tutored him and tutored him and schooled him and now amen he's he's thinking like Dad and he's he's acting like Dad and amen and just let me tell you kids you'll never outgrow your father you can't outgrow your father father I don't care how old he gets I don't care if he's feeble I don't care how poor he is you will never outgrow your father and the quicker the the the the good way of understanding maturity is being able to look at that Father Figure in your life and start seeing things the way he sees things understanding things what can you say amen amen so the only criticalness from us kids toward our parents should be the criticalness is of of am I getting it right my my father brought me in my mother is bar but they they have they have produced this here again again you're the branch they're the root can you say Amen on so the quicker you could understand why Mama and Daddy's dealing with you why they're bringing things why your life was you know you can you can look there and pick on your mama and say well you done way you screamed at me you you know you you you you uh made me feel bad you whatever well you might have been a difficult child and and and and maybe maybe Mama's trying to tutor you but the quicker as you grow up and you start understanding things on the adult level are you kids understanding me the quicker you understand those things then you can start thinking ha now I yeah now I get it now I get it oh boy and it sometimes it don't happen until you get your own kids then you think a cuz you're want to kill your kids and your dad didn't kill you hallelujah amen and and and but what it is is is you're beginning to grow up instead of the selfish little old thing blaming everybody else for your stupidity you're understanding huh and their daddy is still sitting there with all his mama with all their gray hairs looking at you you know and you're only you're only amen 16 years old but they've already got a h a head full of hair gray hair because of you you see it is a it is God or it is you're you're coming into that maturity God is bringing every one of us into that maturity and you know what God is patient because you are part of him well there ain't none of your M and daddies would try to sell you amen I don't think unless they just got really needed some money I guess but no they wouldn't do that because you're of them you're part of them you came from them are y'all understanding me praise the Lord now here we are in the fullness this remember this is the dispensation of the fullness of times this is the time where us Believers have got to come into maturity now I've used you youngans uh uh for example but but you see now God's calling the entire church into maturity God's bringing us all up into maturity so when you hear us talking about bright age or adoption or uh or or anything of that nature it is it is declaring the time that we're in a prophet came in this in this last time Amen to initiate us to point us to what our divine Divine Purpose is in this last day and to tell us you're you're going it's time to go back to Eden you're ready to go back into that place of authority and and you're going to rule and Reign on this Earth that's the place where we're at can you say Amen now we're in brother brandham would put it this way now he says the Pentecostal Church that was that was God's that's what God had in mind the Pentecostal church at the beginning but then Satan come in the insects and he and brother Bram would would say amen he he talks about what about the true this is in the resume of the ages in the church age book he says what about the true seed he says it will happen just as we have said the people are being made ready for the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning and this is thus sayeth the Lord amen it is thus sayth the Lord for it for that is what Joel 2:23 says it says be glad ye children of Zion rejoice in the Lord ye your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former Reign and the latter reign in the first month and the floors will be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmerworm the my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you my people shall never be ashamed now brother Brandon would say now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the wesleyian age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word he says this is the resurrection this is not the resurrection of the church this is the restoration God will take the church right back to the Pentecost of the beginning notice in verse 25 it tells why we need the restoration because the Locust and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm have eaten all but the roots and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages this is the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination of false Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor little root and stock is going to be restored God isn't he is not going to plant a new church church but is going to bring his original back to the original seed now I want us to look real quickly here before I be before we um uh before I end here tonight now Hallelujah all right so the church at Pentecost Christ amen y'all love y y'all know that I'm a really good artist Christ was the seed died went three days he was resurrected up amen came a plant that was beautiful all the powers of God all in it now it looked like it looked like it came up quickly but it did not amen it it it came up it was the Old Testament prophets prophecies all coming into Christ and then it was fulfilled in this church right here the power of the holy spirit amen man it was human beings living the life of God on human beings dead were raised sick were healed the Gentiles had the gospel preached to them God was living in human beings amen but now the scripture says or the as we just as we just read these insects begin to eat up the tree and before you know it it was it was eaten here and the pmer worm and the cankerworm and it was eating that little wheat tree wheat and plant all the way up and the prophet told us that the only thing that was left was what the root and a little nub sticking out of the ground in the Dark Ages the Catholic Church totally took it all away but then God said I'm going to restore amen Hallelujah so out of the Dark Ages here come little leaf begin to come up what was that justification Martin Luther stood up and said the just shall live by faith yes praise the Lord now brother brandham would say in this quote he he would say Amen uh he says U let me find it here real quickly well glory to God you love him let's see uh amen he says now along we've been talking about the seed of the wheat being buried and then sending up two shoots the tassel and the true ear and and this might make some wonder if if we said that the Luthers didn't have the Holy Ghost because they taught basically sanctification it might make some wonder about the Methodist no sir we're not saying that we're not talking about the individuals of the people but the age Luther had the the spirit of God but his age was not the full age of restoration by another outpouring like at the beginning it was the same with Wesley Booth Knox Whitfield Brainard John Edwards Mueller Etc surely they were full of the Holy Ghost yes they certainly was Hallelujah my my Deal's going crazy all right he said yes they certainly was he says uh but the age in which each lived was not the age of restoration neither was any other age but this last age it will be a age completely black out in apostasy this is the age of apostasy but this is the age of restoration it's the age of the finished cycle with this it's all over all right so how can the leaf have the Holy Ghost how could Luther have the Holy Ghost I need some class participation hallelujah amen hallelujah this didn't look anything like it was didn't look anything like this up here hallelujah beautiful wheat plant amen Roots all right here's your wheat this is the Holy Ghost this is the book of Acts this is the power this is what God is wanting the church to be how could that how could they have the Holy Ghost come on talk to me the life is in the root the life is what brings the leaf it had every bit of life in that as the wheat little Pebbles up here but it wasn't the original it's not in its maturity here come amen so here here was the Lutheran they were coming up little little sprigs and and then and then here come here come the stock and little leaves on it and this was sanctification now down here hallelujah this here is justification quit laughing Justified appear Sanctified Hallelujah it's coming on up all right then you come on up here and and you begin to get you begin to get the little and I'll explain that to you in a minute but let's just call this Holy Ghost baptism all right hey like that Hallelujah okay so out of all these in that age where brother on that stock on that stock that's where brother brandham was talking about uh Wesley Booth Knox Whitfield brainer John Edwards all of those guys they were all part of the stock that was growing up growing growing growing growing growing growing all under the work of sanctification under that work of sanctification Hallelujah now when you come up to up up here to when it's beginning to mature that's when that's when things look let me see if I can make this look a little bit more realistic here maybe I don't know amen it looks like the wheat little bitty little bitty deals there right now and a lot of people thought that was the Holy Ghost or that was that was the original church because it began to look different Justified now Luther Luther Luther uh smoked a pipe while he was while he was writing his books on justification Allelujah and let me just tell you something all of you folks who love that uh who's who what's that guy that everyone loves the quote all the time that Spurgeon he smoked a cigar it's in his writings he smoked a cigar after every sermon he preached he says there's nothing like getting up and relaxing with that b that's right he was down here in this Justified state but then here come sanctification the plant is growing further this is y'all's walk you can't stay in the baby stage on when we was talking about the other night Amen on the dress the way we dress see we got to get we got to get past this part and come on up because we want to come into the mind of Christ what God had at the beginning so that's when we start getting Sanctified that's when we start thinking okay time for the clear the clear fingernail polish to come off that's when it's time for the makeup oh but brother wend let just get it's time for the makeup to come off we are growing in sanctification this is where he starts separating himself or us to himself and starts cleaning us up we're beginning to understand in other words you pooped your diapers down here and it was okay come on but mama's gonna say listen Haven ain't changing your diapers no more it's time for you to be Sanctified it's can you say Amen you're coming on up coming on up now sure the leaves of justification keep right on coming they keep right on coming so justification climbs right on up with sanctification it's all part of the plant but when you get up here the Holy Ghost baptism now this is where brother brandham this is where brother brandham sort of schooled us a little bit to tell us to tell us exactly why it gets confusing in this age because it looks so real everyone speaks in tongues everyone's prophesying they wear makeup and they right but the holy spirit is wanting us to understand this looked like wheat but it wasn't wheat now now watch this Hallelujah I brought this quote just in case it would do good or just in case it got to it and I did Hallelujah all right now he says now he says he says now he's he's going back he said he ain't going to plant a new plant he said he's going to restore the one where the nub is and he's going to come back amen he says now at this very moment we are in a complete fulfillment of Revel or Matthew 24:24 in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect who is it that shall attempt to deceive the very elect why the spirit of the Antichrist the false anointed ones of this day these false ones have already come in jesus' name claiming that they've been anointed of God for the last day they're false messiah's anointed ones they claim they are prophets but are they one with the word never they added to it and taken from it and W denize the spirit of God man and and uh manifesting the gifts is upon them but like balam they have their programs the appeal for money exercise gifts and but deny the word or bypass it for the fear of controversy he he says yet preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ now and he and he goes on down he says now they all out shout shine in effort and Zeal he says and and he says but now let me explain they preach the second uh the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though the though in power and signs and true Revelations he eclipses them all oh yes this is the false spirit in the last days it's so close to the real it can it it can can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word and whenever it's caught by being anti- now he says he says it it falls back on the one argument arent that we've already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God he says now before we close I want to bring this thought along with talking about the seed of wheat being buried it sends up the chotes the tassel and then the true ear this might make some wonder if we've said the lutherans didn't have the Holy Ghost they had the Holy Ghost he goes on down he he says he says um uh he says we're not talking about the individuals he says Luther had the spirit of God but his age was not the age of full restoration but the outpouring of of of the uh like in the beginning he says but in the age which uh each lived was not the the age of restoration neither was any age but this last age now this age goes complete apostasy and it's also the age of restoration now uh I I must not have brought I read all of that but I didn't bring what I what I was planning on doing all right just ke I you uh put put that first put that first picture I gave you just real quickly I'm not going to hold you too long now now this is when the wheat comes into its fullness now what you're seeing up here in this is what I was trying to do when you when you see those little those little things there okay and it looks almost like it except I need these little deals here sticking out like those yeah now so that's the wheat it looks really close so is the farmer going to take that wheat just like it is and carry it to the barn no no that's not the wheat that's the wheat plant but inside those little inside those little deals where you see this little deal like that this is the husk and that's got to open up up it opens up just like it opens up and here and here's where it hides the sea put it put put the next One S skis so there's the shuck or the shaff chaff and then there's the grain that's inside the the shuck uh what's the other one look like I forgot Hallelujah okay so once once it has been harvested you have got The Shack on one side which will be burned you've got the wheat on the other side which will be taken now I want you to catch this because this is really cool Justified this was here see you can have you can have your seed but God's not God didn't plant it just to get leaves now if you notice I for I didn't bring the picture of what it looked like as it's coming these are all green really green and as the stock goes up it's green everything is green green it's all green why is it green CA the life but as it begins to come up higher all this begins to die go back to the second one or the the third one first one sister keys and before you know what the greenness is all gone I can tell Elana's want answer this question why is the greenness gone died because it died that's right it's all gone it's all dead it's useless none of that's going to the barn none of it's going to the barn it served its purpose the leaf was a carrier of the seed the stock was a carrier show me where the seed is it's in the life the roots are saying I've got to get to the seed come on so the roots shoots out some leaves don't look nothing like like what's in the ground here comes a stick don't look nothing like in the ground come on but it's desire one seed someone say uno in the ground and then s Keys yeah yeah one one seed in the ground and then out of that one stem hundreds of seeds except they're covered by the shu did you know that when brother brandom came who is the one that sent him all over the world what group sent brother brandom all over the world the Pentecostal is that just am I the only one rejoicing in this or you saying I don't know what you're talking about you see brother BR the leaf could not send brother brandom all over the world neither could the stuck it's the Shu that holds the life and that brought the prophet Ministry to bring you and I the word of God because it was the sunlight of God it was the it was the seed time of God it's time for Rapture and God says I gotta ripen it Hallelujah you were hidden inside that Pentecostal move it doesn't do away the seed does not do away with justification sanctification or speaking in tongues all of that life is still a part of the plant but now it's back in the seed the same seed SE that went into the ground is what God is going to Rapture and take to heaven we don't know what we we know not what ke uh uh uh uh 1 John 3 and one let's let's look at that real quickly 1 John 31 behold what manner of love the father ha bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knows him knew him not beloved now somebody say now why why is it now because we are part of him beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he appears we shall be like him the seed that went into the ground that Holy seed of God in a body is going to be living in your bodies on Resurrection morning hallelujah amen now position if you're not in the root you'll never enjoy that now Sister ke let's go back to the second picture just real quickly amen okay so brother brandom would teach us and he would show us in tight he'd say okay let me show you another story because now G now now he's using this he's using this to show to show you how the week comes all right but now now brother Brandon wants to show us one other thing okay he's he's wanting to make sure we get it he says there were three women he says notable women in the Bible all right he says and he and he brought in Sarah she was to produce Isaac the natural seed then there was Hagar she produced a servant child then there was Mary who produced Jesus the word brother random tells us he says these are the three stages justification sanctification Jesus or Mar Mary these are these are the stages these are the denominational systems Luther Wesley Pentecostal he says but what Christ is coming after none of these organizations he says the church will produce the word amen let me give you a quote he says now he says there's three women carriers of the natural seed until the matured into Christ Ishmael could be could not be because he was really as we think today out of wedlock because he was the bond Bond woman's son then come a little more like like him uh like Jesus come out of Isaac and uh but it it wasn't but it wasn't uh because it was born of the sex between Sarah and Abraham uh but then Along come Mary by the Virgin birth produced Jesus Christ that's right word made flesh and let me just stop right real real quick I done those wrong that's Hagar on the bottom that is Sarah y'all probably already caught that Hagar on the bottom Sarah in the middle and then we're going on up got me all right he says now look there's three women typed here churches women always types the churches means three denominational Ages which were carriers and must also die dry up just like the shuck and so forth does to give room for the seed SE seed can uh cannot get rip until the shuck stocked leaves are all dry that's right saps every bit of the life out of them and now it all gathers into the seed amen so where are we at can I tell you something amen that now now here was here was Luther's here's a Methodist and then here's Pentecostals all right Hallelujah show me Luther is there any life in the Luther Church come on I mean they're ordaining come on they're they're they're they're fighting for they're they're they're fighting for you to be lesbians and homosexuals Wesley amen we learned that here in our own Community the Methodist Church pastor of the Methodist Church was was uh was was fired right here in py America because he was teaching boys that homosexuality is wrong ended up having a the the the the secretary the secretary of the church was a lesbian they called the main office they had him fired so Methodist is out life is gone Luther is out life is gone so let's go to our Pentecostal move you got all the jumping shouting hollering have you can't you can't you can't look at a Pentecostal service without watching a bunch of be bobbing like this I mean they got everyone on the stage you got about 15 girls up there on the stage and they're all dancing like this all over the place and there ain't a lick of God in it and they got this Voodoo music trying to make and and the whole church the whole church is just like this come on come on folks it'll produce sincerity when the life is gone all you become is a form and you've got to fit the form and you take away those pretty girls and drop the music I don't know if there'd be too much dancing going on but they've got the light shows they've got the music come on some of those those guys have even got smoke coming up out of you know I heard a preacher the other day I I was listening to him someone sent me a little little something this guy said about the brother random or something and and and so I was looking he goes he goes boy when I come out he says I I was I was sort of thinking that the Shak of Glory was here but that was a smoke that was a preacher saiding yeah I was a visiting preacher saiding but I guess that was a smoke coming off the on platform he goes that's okay I guess but I'd sure like to have the Shan glory and everyone's all laughing really good yes yes yes but there is the bride that's what God's coming after amen now just because the Pentecostals do do all of this that doesn't mean that we can't worship that doesn't mean we can't speak in tonu that doesn't mean that we can't run the aisles doesn't mean that emotion's part of our religion I believe in emotion and I'd rather have a I'd rather have someone in this church full of emotion than that at a St stupid ball game come on but when the dance is over we are the word it's coming to that maturity this is what God's going to take to the new Eden that's the Adam and Eve that's the restoration and that's why God had a prophet to come and tell us get out of your own emotions get out of your own your own stinking thinking get get out of those denominational format and come back to thus saith the Lord can you say amen amen the last one sister Keys as the musicians come their shuck and their seed I I'm thankful for the Pentecostal move I am I was raised in the Pentecostal move I'm thankful I I seen a lot in the Pentecostal move but I'm here to tell you for the for in the in in these in these last amen 40 years I I've seen the decline in the last 40 years amen since I was about 13 years old until uh uh you know here I am at 50 going on 54 on my next birthday I'm telling you the life is gone folks but don't let us become another form don't let us become another denomination I the every ounce of the life that was in that seed is now appear [Music] here the ministry of life everything that seed of redemption was is in you amen bless the Lord you love him God bless you tonight didn't mean to hold you so long here this evening wanted to get to this get to that very uh get to that quote I am thankful just as in the natural we're growing up so will every one of us grow into the stature the fullness of that eternal word and it's all because you were in God's thoughts at the very beginning you love him Hallelujah glory to God Amen what are you playing there brother Kobe I need thee I need thee [Music] every [Music] hour I'm so glad I'm so glad the life is come on [Music] up it's me now my [Music] S I come [Music] to thee that's the cry the seed I need the I need [Music] thee every hour I need the oh bless my My Savior [Music] I I don't feel like I've done the Justice on the very last here folks religious forms all these denominations they're now coming to church with no sincerity there's no life there's no convictions there's nothing there what I'm saying the way that we judge that seed Shu pulling away as the Shu pulls away from the from the seed then the life it begins to mature that seed the more mature it becomes it takes all of the moisture out of it and the dross out of it I think there should be a real deep desire to do the will of the Lord just like Jesus had he was the fullness he was the seed now we could go all through the old test Testament the same thing the wheat plant we could see the prophets coming up see the shoots we can see them all coming up all the way up until it came to Jesus Christ and it was the it was the most holy people who loved the most holy God it was the most holy preachers that crucified the most holy king in the most holy city they had to pull away in order for the sun to be expressed and lifted up now [Music] listen I want a deeper sincerity as Elena sung that song earlier I I want to stay there with [Music] him and if the shock is still surrounding Us in this Pentecostal denominational thinking I'm I'm asking you today won't you ask God to take the shuck away from you you've got you've got the seed that's the reason you have [Music] desire but ask God shine your light on me so that that Pentecostal thinking or the worldliness of this crazy Church age this apostate age let it pull away from me Let It Be So separated that I love God more than I love men and women or friends or jobs or more than I love sin I know I'm part of you cuz I've got it here you're representing me I know you love me I know I love you Lord just pull anything and everything away from me that's not right because the seed brother brandom says he's the promise was that that this seed would be the like the original that's your promise so you can't use the excuse well you know we're way over here in Le Osa and the and the we'll never be like the book of Acts the prophet didn't say that the word didn't say that the word says that's our promise I will [Music] restore I believe the power of the Holy Ghost just like they had in the book of Acts is our promise that's right sincerity even remember brother Bram says it goes into total apostasy that's the shuck but it's one of full restoration that's the seed the church system will go to hell but the seed will grow more like him that's right [Music] I love him tonight not because he's been good to me I love him because I'm part of him I love him tonight not because I feel good I love him because I'm part of him oh bless me now my [Music] saor I can [Music] do or let the seed cry out to him crying [Applause] [Music] save make me more sincere to hear my humble cry yes why on others Thou Art calling Hallelujah [Music] all I need more of you and less of me May image is what I long to be my up overflowing so that others can more of [Music] you and less of me I need more of you less of me made it to your image is what I long to be my cup overflowing so that others may see yeah you and now as they just play softly I want you to examine your heart tonight the sunlight has come you see the prophet's message would mean nothing to you if
