turn it to Brother John I'd like to open up the floor to to any testimonies anyone has I know brother Tim mentioned you had a testimony tonight so we'd love to hear from you amen God bless you either one there we go probably don't need a mic uh used to being in the back but listen to brother uh Wendell this morning talking about you young people here in homeschooling um you don't realize the privilege I was about four years old five years old about 40 years ago um my mom and dad started homeschooling and I just remember sitting there it was blizzarding out I mean we just got done milking sitting there eating supper and deputy sheriff walks up knocks on the door and the local public school took my mom and dad all the way to Supreme Court of Michigan for homeschooling they took him to court for child labor and the Lord used that my dad was I mean in high school there went to public school and he said he was walking down the hallway in seventh grade and he heard a voice said when you grow up and have children homeschool your children and he turned around there was nobody in the hall so you may not realize the value of what you're getting but the Lord paved a way that you could have a good education and be protected um back home you know they've got a a a kitty litter box in the hallway in our local school there in in Lima light Ela but the Lord cares about you and he'll he'll make a way for you but that be I just was thinking about that this morning when you said that I mean didn't realize you know the the the reach from the Lord but um just here recently been struggling been working a lot and struggling been carrying a lot of load and it bleeds over into the family and my wife is was praying and last weekend I went down to Kentucky huntt and just trying to get away from work and trying to regain my my sanity and uh brother Tim puit was up and I was planning on being gone Sunday I mean I'd left Friday night he was planning on being gone come back Sunday night it's kind of what we're out here doing just kind of me and L are just enjoying ourselves but down there Amanda had went up for prayer and she said that she was just sitting in her seat you know just praying and had a bunch of thoughts going through her head and different things and she went up and I don't even remember what she went went up for prayer for her but she had went up for prayer and they prayed for that and then brother Jonathan came over and just started speaking straight to her and telling her you know ministering the exact thoughts of what she had thought in her seat so you may think that it doesn't matter you know what you're going through you know Lord don't think about you but the Lord hears every one of our thoughts so Sunday you know I come back I got home Saturday night I tagged out in Kentucky Saturday come back Saturday night and I'm sitting there and brother Tim's Minister and and and just a weight you know had been on my shoulders and it was like brother Tim was ministering straight to me and he kept looking at me and I'm in the sound booth is where I normally sat my back's against the wall I'm in the back of the church you know and uh so I I he kept looking at me just just looking straight at me and I said Lord you know I'm at my post of Duty you know I'll I'll come I'll come up after church so everybody had walked out and I walked back and I went to the office back there and the Lord met us back there in the office and just await I can't even begin to describe I guess the closest thing I could say is in Kentucky I'd carried 128b pack for a mile and 3/4 packing out my deer and the the what my legs felt like when I took that pack off that's what it feels like when the Lord will take a weight off your shoulders and he's mindful no matter what it is he's mindful I mean he's he's healed me he's he's put fuel in my tank you know praying going down the road penniless no money don't know where I'm going to get fuel for for putting in the truck and I'm on E and I drove past a gas station and I smelt gas fumes and I'm like great now what what's gone wrong now and I look down I watched my fuel gauge go from E to full and I was in a I was in a a Chevy with a 454 and they don't get good fuel economy I got 800 miles on that tank of fuel the Lord is mindful of every detail in our lives so just as an encouragement just keep pressing just go forward whatever the Lord puts you in just put your shoulder to the wheel so Lord bless you we love you all amen so glad he's mindful amen anyone else tonight just a few before we turn it over anyone else have a testimony all right so what we'll do is we'll ask for the John to come up that'll give everyone plenty of time to get prepared amen God bless brother John amen bless God bless you Saints it's aise the Lord wonderful rainy nice Misty cold evening to be in the house of God Amen you know that's something we ought to be thankful about that we have a nice building to come in out of the weather to worship God you know a long time ago I I had the privilege of going to India and uh the very building that we went with the minister that we went with at the orphanage there where we were ministering didn't have a roof on it they had a tarp uh over the you know where they were preaching and it went about halfway over the congregation and thank goodness the monsoon seasons was about three weeks away because if it wasn't we'd have been soaked yeah and I'll I'll never forget that amen of of being there and thinking my goodness the nice buildings that we have the nice things that we have and here they are sitting on a dirt floor and now imagine when it's raining they're sitting on a dirt floor and they would walk to be there yeah sit there all day long oh man yeah we ought to be thankful that that's for sure but I was thinking about this being thankful and it coming up on Thanksgiving and and I have so much brother Wendell Saints to be thankful for I mean I could start all the way back from when I was a child to my parents I could start with my grandparents I could move all the way through through my mishaps in life and the things I chose to do that weren't right and and God delivering me and I mean we could take it yeah through the I there's not a step in my life brothers and sisters that I'm not thankful for God taking that step for me I could have been dead on the side of the street from the drugs but here I am right I could have wrecked my truck One Night in a drunk whatever you want to call it but he didn't let it happen that way I could have stepped over the boundary and said something against this message that I was raised in that would have booted me out for good but he didn't allow me to every step of my life has been him carrying me plain and simple all right but what I'm the most thankful for brothers and sisters is this message you say well you know really it's it's a message it's the scriptures it's the Bible and it is and I was raised in a message church I was raised in a message home I was taught the message I was beat the message if you would I was you know you're going to live it or you're not going to I mean you know what I mean it it now there's all types I mean you have some preachers that preach Grace and you have some that preach the law and it takes both law and Grace there you know what I mean but coming up through but once I finally realized what the message was telling me brothers and sisters and and if you don't mind i' I've got a a quote here from brother brandom and if you don't mind I'm going to I'm going to read it to you it's actually a prayer of his and it is in uh 1958 the W Watchman water of the night but this prayer and I keep it in my tablet I keep it on my phone I keep it in a little written thing in my desk I I have this prayer it says in this hour of Gloom over the Earth and destruction on every hand Lord God we are we just cannot express how we feel and the thankfulness and gratefulness in our heart that Jesus Christ came down from glory and was made like a man like we dwelt among us and then when he died for our sins come through the way of paradise and taken the waiting Souls broke through every spiritual power that the devil had bound the Earth with and made a streak so that the sunlight of God's Eternal Grace God's Eternal Grace I'm not just forgiven that day I'm forgiven the next time okay oh pray praise the Lord CU I make a lot of mistakes brothers and sisters I I do the sunlight of God's Eternal Grace could shine upon those who are willing to receive it God grant today that men everywhere where will hurry hurry get into the kingdom for the message has always been urgent hurry hurry come out the angel said in Sodom I can do nothing till you come hither Lord grant that though the message to be full of grace and power and love yet it's urgency Grant Lord that men may quickly come and receive Christ and be filled with the Holy Ghost for Jesus has said they that are of God hear the words of God may they come and repent of their sins be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of their sins and be filled with the Holy Ghost to fix their soul in the condition that the first church was okay so shall it be when you come we're thankful for the message and pray that you'll bless it Lord to the good of our hearts and we as we wait on thee in Jesus name we pray amen and it's that right there and pray that you bless it and then he said as we wait on thee so when I first got this I was all excited and I put it back that means a lot you know Eternal Grace yeah but over the years as I studied the message and I studied the scriptures and I took what brother brandom said and then I went to the scriptures and I took the scriptures back to what brother brandom said and I'm not very smart so I'm thankful for an Old Kentucky hillbilly I promise you but as I'm studying this I realized that the scriptures don't lie come on and the message doesn't lie so it all boils down to this for me of what I'm thankful for the message message yes but what the message told me was is I didn't just one day trip over a scripture in the message and become a Son of God all right I didn't just wake up one day and God decide oh him yeah no come on what I realized that before the foundation of the world God wrote my name in his book and he said John Mary and Torrance and his family are going to get a new name I'm going to call them Mrs Jesus Christ and the Bible even says you know don't Rejoice that the Devils fall under your feet don't but Rejoice that your name's in the Lamb's Book of Life and brothers and sisters that's what I'm thankful for that's what my heart cries out to God when I'm on my knees thank you Lord for thinking of me before the foundation of the world because I couldn't do this on my own without Jesus Christ I would be nothing amen and I'm thankful for that amen God bless you all that's my thankful for this Thanksgiving [Applause] season did you enjoy that amen can we sing this song I think Uriah says he has a special tonight so I'm G to ask him to come but can we sing this song Thank

tried to get this done and I tried to get it done and tried but I said I finally I broke down I said Lord I can't do it and I'm going to give it to you and I gave it to the Lord and now it's getting

verse one um Psalms 92 and verse one it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy name oh most high you know I was uh when brother Wendell uh talked to us about um being ready to come up and speak for just a few moments on being thankful um I I went upstairs into my Sunday school room with my youngest and was just kind of letting him run around the floor while I sat there trying to uh figure out what I could say and I had uh something pop my hand pop in my head that I remembered reading um and so I started looking online and to add a few things and um there was an article that was actually released uh the first of this month um so November 1st 2023 by the American Psychological Association um the article was entitled stress in America 2023 a nation grappling with psychological impacts of collective trauma um and one portion of this uh article um said that the survey revealed that those ages 35 to 44 reported that the most significant increase in chronic health conditions since the pandemic 58% in 2023 compared with 48% in 2019 adults aged 35 to 44 also experienced the highest increase in mental health diagnosis 45% reported a mental illness in 2023 compared with 31% in 2019 though adults age 18 to 34 still reported the highest rate of mental illness at 50% adults ages 35 to 44 were more likely to report that money and the economy were the factors that caused them significant stress today compared with 2019 and what had made me look into that and I found the the other article which was released in 2022 um also in November so basically I was released November 17th 2022 so exactly one year ago uh basically two days um in the mental health first aid USA uh they said research has shown that consciously practicing gratitude can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in fact Studies have found that a single act of thoughtful gratitude produces an immediate 10% increase in happiness and a 35% reduction in depressive symptoms these effects disappear within 3 to 6 months which reminds us to practice gratitude over and over now the Bible mentions the word gratitude 157 times um it mentions thanks or Thanksgiving 72 times and so here uh you know even as this year as the nation is going hey we have more people struggling with stress and more people struggling with mental illness and more people struggling with these uh with the the battlefield that that brother brandom talked about the battlefield was in the mind and so we knew this is where the enemy was going to be attacking us as they're talking about this more than ever one year ago they're saying wait if you just are thankful if you're just grateful it helps the whole situation well then if we go back to scripture if God talks about it 157 times for gratitude and he talks about it 72 times for thanks or Thanksgiving I think he was giving us a clue I think he was telling you here how's here's one of the ways that you battle is just be thankful be grateful be content where you're at this doesn't mean that you ignore the stresses that you're going on it doesn't mean that you ignore hey Lord I'm going through a hard time right now like our brother was talking about hey you don't IGN going and pretend that I have gas in my tank I acknowledge there's a problem hey Lord I have no gas in and I have no money to buy the gas there are problems here and I can't fix the problems all right right but then you're able to commit it to the Lord and the thankfulness of knowing that we have a God to hand it to we have a God that can take our stresses a God that can take our problems right when we are able to be have that thankfulness when we're able to have that faith in our creator you can drive by a gas station and your tank fills up without you ever stopping because it's still the same Jehovah he's still the same Jehovah Gyra he's still the Creator and he's still going to watch over his children in Matthew chapter 6 starting at verse 25 it says therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than rment behold the fowls of the air for they seow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father Feth them are ye not much better than them I've been uh going over with my Sunday school class we've been talking about uh in the The Book of John what are known as the seven I am statements that Jesus makes um and as we were going over that lesson today there was a a quote that I read if I can find it right here it was in the in the sermon the lamb and the dove brother brandom's preaching he says and the lamb has a great meaning I was over in Palestine or over in the orient rather and if you ever been went to the Orient and seing what the the Bible would become a new book to you if you ever studied it it's an oriental book written in Oriental Parables Parables and Customs they used in those days and they don't change they're just the same today one day and I a man and I were riding around in a little British Jeep and I heard the whistles blowing and everything stopped all the cars stopped and I said what's the matter and look to my surprise coming across the street was a Shepherd leading a bunch of sheep and I said well why and he said everything stops for the sheep and the shepherd over here then driving on farther I noticed a place where there was a Shepherd coming down through the street and over there they don't have the convenience that we have today to find ice boxes and so forth they put their vegetables and so forth right out on the street their goodies and here comes down the middle of the street a Shepherd walking right through those places leading his sheep not by a rope they were just following him by sight and I stopped and I was amazed and that Shepherd walked and he could step a few steps out to one side and then back into the path and the Sheep next to him would step out come back and the Sheep behind him would follow and they followed the shepherd my sheep know my voice and I was amazed and I said to the good man with me I said why do they not turn aside and eat some of those peirs they looked beautiful and the things that would entice the Sheep said they would in no wise touch anything until the shepherd first beded them to do so oh my there you are if God's sheep would just be that careful about things we wouldn't have so many different Scruples in our churches and things that's right you know the as we were going over that and talking about Jesus saying that I am the the Good Shepherd um we talked about Psalms 23 and you know when you think about a Shepherd from our Western standpoint or if you're in Europe and you want to see how they're raising sheep you go and they have a large fenced pasture normally extremely green growing all the Sheep are within the fence and a Shepherd just has to stand there and watch them but when you go into the East and you go into the Middle East there aren't huge Green Pastures everywhere there's not a place where they just park them in a fence and that's where they leave them they have to lead them from mouthful to mouthful from place to eat to place to eat and the Sheep is fully trusting the shepherd going going okay he's going to lead me to where the next place is because if I graze in this section and I eat what's here it's then gone it's not huge Lush and green it's there's a mouthful here I walk a few more steps here's another mouthful I walk a little further there's another mouthful but it's relatively Barren and so the Sheep is trusting that the shepherd is going to lead him to the next place to the next provision to the next food to the next water he's going to lead him to shelter at the end of the night he's it's not from our Western mindset where hey we're in this Lush field everything is beautiful and green I know the Shepherds over on the side watching me but I can run around in the field and everything's fine in the Eastern mindset it goes I have to watch the shepherd I have to follow the shepherd or I don't get food or I don't get water or I'm not safe okay these are my choices I either look at the shepherd and follow him or I don't have provision I either look at the shepherd and follow follow him or I don't have safety and so when we look at these things you know being grateful for God providing we're also going hey I have to keep my eyes on him for that provision to come I have to keep following the steps that he's leading I have to keep going along when we have a world that is built around fighting and clawing to get that next dollar to be able to provide to be able to meet the needs we're the ones that are supposed to be resting and that doesn't yes we all go to work we go and we provide for our families the best we can but at the same time we are in our minds we should be going all right Lord I know this is coming from you I know you're the one providing the work I know you're the one providing the job whatever may happen I going back in my history I had a great job in Florida I was working in a paint store I was making great money working for a brother in the church church I made poor decisions at bad mistakes and ended up leaving that job and then I was trying to figure out how I was going to provide for my family because I messed up very clearly at that point be like I was the one who made poor decisions I wasn't going oh God's leading me to do this now God still used that for me but it was me making the poor decisions and so I end up working in fast food again and I didn't start out back at Chick-fil-A going yes I'm making so much money my family's well taken care of everything's provided for were great it was more of a look at the paycheck and go how in the world are we going to pay bills how in the world are we going to be able to put food on the table pay rent do these different things and working through those different steps and then God decides to move me to Alabama and I get to do it all over again start another new job and go again how am I going to make ends meet I was starting to build something over there and now I'm starting all over what's happening how is this going to work and we had the shepherd Watching Over Us each step of the way each part yes I'm struggling going I don't know how this is going to work I don't know how we're going to pay every bill I don't know how we're going to ride for every step and then eventually the Lord leads me here to Oklahoma and I take a pay cut to move to Oklahoma and once again I'm going all right Lord what are we doing anyone from the outside in the normal world looking at me would go you've made a wrong decision every single time cuz you've taken pay cuts every single time you're not supposed to move unless you're making more money that's the way it works you shouldn't be unless you're increasing unless you're getting better and yet each time we go we end up back in that place going okay Lord what are you supposed to do and I remember particularly in that first year that we moved here there were multiple times that I would be praying to the Lord going all right Lord you know we moved here to be at church and to be in Fellowship which means you got to figure out a way for me to have gas in my car to get to pawn e so that I can make it to these different fellowships cuz we have a lot of them I didn't realize how much Fellowship there was when I first moved here then I got here and I realized wait I'm driving there four or five times a week I'm going through a lot of gas but at the same time that's why we moved here so Lord if I'm supposed to be here you've got to provide cuz I can't because all the time I would have for second job is me going to Pon e to Fellowship so I can't do that either so Lord I'm trusting in you you have to be the shepherd you have to be the one to give the provision you have to be the one to take care of it and it's not easy and it's especially not easy if you start to let yourself evaluate your life through the lens the world uses I said in a sermon not long ago when we found out my wife is pregnant again my mind fell back into that lens and I started going well we don't have a house yet I am about to have another kid and we don't have any savings in the bank and we don't have this don't have this I'm just a failure this isn't working at all but then I had to remember it's not me making it work it's not about me yes God still requires that I get up and go to work and provide for my family the best that I can but then it comes down to me trusting the shepherd to okay Lord this is what I've got these are the bad decisions I've made in my life that cause these situations debts that have to be paid or whatever these are the situation decisions that I've made good because I was following you and I've ended up here and if this is where you want me then Lord You're providing all right and I'm trusting you to help me get through it and I'm trusting you to help me make the better decisions and when the world is so stressed out be still stressed by covid still stressed by the ramifications of what went through there yeah look I moved here and we were here a year and Co hit maybe I wasn't here that long it wasn't like we had built up a extreme amount of stability and the whole world falls apart everything's going wrong and yet somehow I'm placed in a business that's if anything even busier because of covid of all the restaurants in the world I could have worked at I'm at Chick-fil-A and Chick-fil-A somehow ends up being busier through Co when we have the dining room closed and we should be slower and we should be having to lay off employees and we should be having to do all these things and yet somehow my bills are being paid and somehow I'm taken care of and somehow things are going okay and the world would be looking at me going you're still working in a fast food place this isn't a great place to be this isn't a great way to provide for the family but yet it provides and I have been blessed my whole life that my wife has never had to work we made that commitment when we first got married that hey we want my wife wanted to be a stay-at-home mom she wanted to take care of the home she wanted to raise the kids and the same thing you commit it to the Lord and go okay Lord if this is what you want this is what you put on her heart I'm not going to fight against it but if that's what's on her heart then Lord that means you've got to help me provide when in a world where it's standard for two income families in a world where it's standard that to make ends meet you have to have two people working and yet somehow me working at a fast food restaurant the Lord meets our needs we have food on the table we have gas in the car now once again from the World standpoint there going to be lots of things that say we don't have much we only have one car we don't have multiple cars we are renting a house we are doing this we are doing that you can run down a laundry list of all the ways I am not Successful by the world standards we can run down a laundry list of how most everyone in this room is not Successful by the world standards but yet at the same time when we can go hey you know what I've got healthy kids I've got kids that get compliments from people when we go out because of hey they're well behaved wow they're so smart wow they're so uh articulate they're able to communicate well they're able to do these different things and I look at them and go yeah they're homeschooled my wife is teaching them no she doesn't have a college degree no she doesn't have any type of major higher education she just has the time and the care to give them like God designed and somehow God continues to provide for me with one job to make it the shepherd is making sure that we get that mouthful every step every few steps we get what we need he's providing the food he's providing the water and so when the world is stressing when the world is so upset and yet their own research says if you you can be grateful if you can be thankful if you can if you can put this into some of your mental practices it will help the stress and God in his word is telling you be grateful be thankful you don't need to worry about what science is telling you because I already told you I already gave you these instructions science is just confirming that guess what God was right what do we know Psalms 118 and verse one oh give thanks unto the the Lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever Psalms 136 verse1 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks to the Lord of lords for his mercy endureth forever Psalms 105 verse1 oh give thanks unto the Lord Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people why do we have a testimony service brother one was talking about hey this is the most we've had testimony services in a little while why because the scripture says make known his deeds among the people let them know what God's doing let them know God filled up a gas tank praise the Lord praise the Lord he can provide we've heard testimonies from different one about how God paid a bill they don't know where the money money came from they don't know how it it's paid but God paid the bill God did this God did that we don't do it to try to show well I'm so spiritual I was able to make this happen no we're going God it's all him he's the one who does it he's the one who somehow is able to help me pay bills and provide for my family and do all these different different things that according to the world standard shouldn't work it shouldn't work to have a one income home unless you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars it shouldn't work to be working at a fast food restaurant and providing for a family of six soon to be seven it shouldn't work to do these things it shouldn't work for all these brothers to be able to go out as electrical contractors in the same area and find enough work to be able to provide for their families but yet they do and they're not fighting each other to get the work right they're each doing their own thing and God's providing that shouldn't work they're in Pony America this isn't a big town this isn't a big area with you know lots and lots of people that are all looking for electrical work but yet somehow God provides gives them the work they need make sure that their families are taken care of make sure their bills are paid the world says it shouldn't work and we point over and go it's our Shepherd he's the one who provides he's the one who takes care and that's who we can be thankful for that's who we're thankful to that's what we're thankful for is that he's the one providing every step of the way 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 16 Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you and everything giv thanks in everything be thankful and everything be grateful because we have a great Shepherd that is watching out for our needs and providing every step of the way maybe I can't see

Deuteronomy 6 and two have you been enjoying yourself tonight amen I always enjoy testimony services and and singing Amen brother brandom says you want the Lord to appear come in your midst talk about him and I think the Lord gives us testimonies that we can brag on him a little bit and create an atmosphere where he can come and dwell Among Us amen but Exodus 6 and2 and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou west by the way when thou liest down when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be frontlets between thine eyes and then Thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy Gates and as shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swore unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to give thee uh the great and good goodly cities which thou build us not Houses full of good things which thou fillest not Wells digg which thou digest not Vineyards and olive trees which thou plant not and when thou have eaten and be full then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee out of the land of Egypt and from the house of bondage amen you you may be seated and you know I want to I want to start by we reading a little a little quote whenever I was in Poland I was able to go to the to the concentration camp owitz and they have a bunch of different phrases of the people that are left you know and this is one of them that just stood out to me he says those who do not remember remember the past or condemned to repeat it and I thought ma that is very very true because there's a lot of people saying gosh what's didn't happen the Holocaust didn't happen I think it was Dad that says if it didn't happen where' all those millions of people go you know but there was another quote that stood out to me one of them says there's people that are denying this didn't happen and she says I'm willing to crawl on my hands and knees to prove that this happened and I thought my it's something that somebody was passionate about that had happened and I remember it taking place and you know I I started thinking about some testimonies that has happened to us this year uh there was a you know as as an evangelist you don't you don't make much money you know people think we do but you don't make much money and there was a time we was out about a month or so and we just we didn't we wasn't going to able to pay the bills thank God for credit cards you know wasn't able to pay the bills when with offerings wer taking care of the the the expenses out on the road and there was two brothers that just that they called and said yo You Came Upon my heart and I want to give you an offering it ain't much I want you give you give you an offering another brother a couple weeks later said brother Josh you came up my heart and I want to give you an offering and as we got home we didn't have the money for the bills but those offerings were just enough to pay the bills and I start thinking about this scripture beware lest thou forget it's the little things that God brings us through the times that he heals us of a headache or heals us of a tummy ache you know I can think of times I was in school having headaches and ID say Lord please touch my head God would heal my head it's the little things that God lets us know that he's never going to leave us he's never going to forsake us but beware lest you forget there was another time we was out at the park and uh Ethan was running running on the on on the basketball court and it had just rained he had slipped and fell in the mud pudle landed right on his head his head started to swell he was crying balling me and Loretta got together together and as we started to pray he stopped crying and he took off running playing again and I grabbed him and looked at his head the swelling was gone the redness was gone it was God letting us know that no matter where we're at what we go through don't forget the little things and let me just encourage you tonight beware lest you forget the little things you know brother brandham tells the story of the magic flower he says there was a man that uh found a flower and the flower spoke to him you know I think it's a I'm guessing it's a story that's made up but the flower spoke to him and says I'll give you a wish but you got to keep me with you wherever you go and the man says well magic flower I want the mountains to open up and inside of those mountains I want there to be Treasures I want there to be be jewels and crowns and a bunch of treasures and the the magic flower spoke to him and said it will happen as you say but don't forget me I got to be with you wherever you go and he looked and the mountain opened up and inside of the mountain there was Treasures there was gold there was silver the there was there was diamonds and crowns and everything the man ran in there and he was picking up picking up the treasures picking up the gold picking up the silver and he he as he was leaving the entrance of the cave he heard a voice that says don't forget the most important thing and he says my okay okay so he let he let go of this and he picked something else up and as he was leaving The Voice says again don't forget the most important thing and he thought my what what am I forgetting what what am I got what do I got to leave behind he let go of something else and he and he picked this up and as he was leaving again the voice spoke again and says don't forget the most important thing and he says oh flower be quiet I don't need you no more I've got my treasure and as he left out of the cave he turned around and the cave closed and the flower was inside of it he had forgot the most important thing he had what he had in his hand but what all the supplies everything that was going to last for eternity everything that was going to last for the future was now all behind because he forgot the most important thing and I think my God has given us Health he's given us families he's given us he's GI he's provided all of our needs but if we forget the most important thing we can stand today with our health but what about tomorrow we can stand today with gas in our cars but what about tomorrow we can stand today with their bills being paid but what about tomorrow don't forget the one that has brought you out of bondage don't forget the one that has given you health given you a family that has given you children that that that had sanity we you know a fear of mine is is one of our children being born and not being mental not not being right and I think God is giving me two children that have their right mind they can talk there they can sing and I think my don't forget the little things not every child is born with the right mind don't forget that God has brought you this far don't forget about the magic flower so to speak don't forget you see it's memories that that that push you in a direction you see as a child you can't talk you can't walk you can't crawl but a child learns certain things and as he begins to crawl memories is reminding him how to crawl as I walk it's my memory teaching showing me how to walk it's my memory telling me how to talk if you ever lost your memory you would forget those things but it's memory that is pushing you in a direction and I started to think about brother brandham brother brandham says whenever his cross-eyed baby was about to die and his wife had died you know he says there was never a crosseyed baby that come before him in the prayer lines that God never did heal because he remembered his crossy baby it was memory that would bring on a compassion and bring on a love that he could express a healing power to that through through those people and I think about Jonah it was Jonah's testimony that brought salvation to the land that he went through you know brother brandham says that all of Nineveh was worshiping the Sea Gods and whenever the welcome rote his tongue upon the seash shores and Jonah walked out upon the shores saying repent preaching repent repent or perish it was his testimony that brought us salvation to that people cuz how he wouldn't have got there on the Gods if he wouldn't have backslid you it was his testimony that brought salvation to that land and don't forget if God's delivered you from drugs beware lest you forget if God's delivered you from alcohol beware letest God forless you forget if God has filled you with the Holy Ghost beware Les you forget how God has brought you out I think of the woman at the well it was the woman at the well the Bible says the men of the city believe on Jesus because of the woman's testimony he has told me all the things that I have ever done and if you think about it what did Jesus tell the woman at the well she just told her past the only thing that he told the woman at the well that she had five husbands and the one that he was she was with now wasn't even hers so you would think she would have been ashamed to express that you think she would have been embarrassed to tell the men of the city that she has f husbands and and the and this one knows about it but since she realized that there was something Supernatural that took place at the well she was willing to let the city know that there is a man that can save there is a man that can deliver don't be ashamed of what God has done for you if God has brought you through trials don't be ashamed to let the let the people know about what God has done for you you know I think of this scripture in Psalms 37 and 25 five I have been young and now I am old yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor is seed begging bread he is merciful and lendeth in his seed is blessed his seed is blessed that's a promise that we can remember and grab a hold of for the Brandon would say God is true to his promise no matter what he has to do he'll bankrupt the heavens before he will let his word go defeated he'll never he never made a promise he can't keep I'm the Lord that heals all thy diseases if thou lay hands on the sick they shall recover if thou can't believe all things are possible so I think we need to stop remembering the things that we that our trials our circumstances and remember what God has done for us you see memory will push us in a direction God didn't save us to lose us God didn't deliver us for us to go back into bondage but we can see the children of Israel that come out of Egypt and then they got through some hard times and the Bible says let us get a captain and go back to Egypt they forgot about how God brought plagues upon the land how God turned water into blood they forgot about it and was willing to go back to where they come from and that quote I wrote at the I read at the beginning those who don't do not remember the past or condemned to repeat it it's a cycle that we got to break it's a cycle of life and death we are going to break we remember that God come and paid the price for our sins to break the cycle of death and one day we're going to step out of this Natural Body and step into eternity don't forget what God has done for us this evening don't forget to look up and see where your help comes from Brother brandom talks about the hog that is eating the apples and he never looks up to see where the apples come from and I think my if there's anything that we need to remember it is what God has done for us and the Bible would say this here and Deuteronomy 7:16 and thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee Thine Eyes shall not have no pity upon them neither shalt thou serve their gods for they shall be a snare unto thee and if Thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than I how can I dispose of them and thou shalt not be afraid of them but shalt well remember remember what the Lord God done unto Egypt or done unto pharaoh and unto all of Egypt he's saying when you come against something that you do not know how to get through just remember if you come to a circumstance that you don't know if you're going to make it through just remember if you come to a spot and your children are sick just remember how God healed them before if you come to a spot where you don't know if you're going to pay the bills just remember the god paid them before if you're at a spot where you don't got gas remember that God put gas in the tank before if we're on the road and we don't got money for the bills we can remember that God supplied before and God is going to supply every step of the way don't get discouraged in wello doing don't get tired in wello for the same God that brought you this far is going to take you all the way to the Rapture there's nothing that the devil can do to keep you worth bound there's nothing the devil can do to keep you out of this Rapture just remember that God has given us something in this generation that is going to carry us all the way through amen God bless [Applause] you Hallelujah Mercy don't stop amen did you enjoy that amen [Applause] let's not forget I we live in such a chaotic time me and dad was talking in the office while ago it seemed like Thanksgiving snuck up on us this year it's been so fast I think in my 32 years of living I believe this is probably been the fastest year I've ever lived in so far just so fast so fast we get up we go to bed tired it seems like so much going on and we can forget the small things that God has done for us and so that message is very timely for me because it's easy to forget amen can we sing this song here as brother Michael gets ready to come all a because of who you are I give you glory and because of who you are I give you praise because of who who you are I will lift my voice and say Lord I worship you because of who you are Lord I worship you because can we stand and sing that verse again because of who you are and because of who he is I'll give you Glory yes Lord because of who you are [Music] because I'll give you [Music] praise and

[Applause] provider Jehovah [Music] n Lord you re in Victory Jehovah shalom you're my prince of peace and I worship you because of who you are Lord I worship you sing that again Jehovah Gyra now as brother Michael comes Jehovah Gyra Jehovah gy he's my [Applause] provider Jehovah n Lord you reign in Victory Jehovah Shalom you're my prince of peace and I worship you because of who you are Lord I worship you because of who you [Music] are amen you love him here this evening if you could i' you know I really didn't know if we'd be coming for the second service for some reason I don't know why I just had it in my head we weren't having a second service but I was like man I'm going to be so full from that Thanksgiving dinner and I and I still am so uh um appreciate the girls putting that the ladies putting that together and and uh just feeding us and taking care of us and and um you know I did have a a few scriptures here and I'd like to start here in Philippians uh 4 six and just a real easy passage of scripture here but it's just something that kind of come to my mind and but it reads like this here in the F first verse it says therefore my brethren dear beloved and longed for my joy and Crown so stand stand fast in my Lord my dearly beloved I beseech I don't know that name and I beseech and I don't know that name and that they be of the same mind in the Lord and I entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women which labor with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers who names are in the Book of Life rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which path all understanding shall keep your heart and mind through Jesus Christ and I did have one more scripture it's in Luke in the 17th chapter um again another another passage of scripture we're all familiar with but in Luke 17 and 11 get here in just a minute it says here and it came to pass as he went through Jerusalem and he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee and he had entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were leopards which stood AAR off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy Mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God and he fell down on his face and his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan and Jesus answering said were there not 10 cleansed but there are only but where are the nine and they are not found that who return to give glory to God save this stranger amen and you know I was thinking about this little passage of scripture and of course our main text here this evening would be Thanksgiving and and I have a lot to be thankful for as much as you know as you guys and and you know I have a few things that kind of was brought to my mind this past year and I was um one of the things was during our youth meeting I was um there just kind of helping out wherever needed you know chairs and food and you know getting the kids all into bed and you know turning the lights on and you know making our rounds and different things and and uh you know sometimes doing those kinds of things you you get wrapped up in your responsibilities rather than the service and and um but one thing in this meeting that really Stu out to me you know and I was um just going through some things in my mind and I'm sure that many of us do that you know that the Lord is you know is you know he he he's he's had his day with you Etc you know and and and I was sitting in the service and our brother it was brother Andrew that was preaching and and he was up there and he's just preaching away you know and he's all soaked and he's wet you know and he's just preaching away and and uh he began to end the service and he come up and he had offered prayer and you know some youth had come up and they had been prayed for it and I noticed that he was standing up there you know and I just kind of walked up there and just kind of gave him a little bump and was like hey man are you you know you done or you know um he's like no there's one more and I began to think you know and I was like you know that's that's the heart of a minister you know that's that's wonderful you know and that's great but you know you he still got three other meetings to go and and uh we don't want our you know our preacher all blown out you know so I kind of start giving him the I put my arm around him you know just kind of start walking him you know down the deal and he's like no there's one more and he he turns and he looks at a girl and he begins to pray for her and he begins so I you know I just kind of help him out and you know just kind of sing you know in prayer and just kind of keeping the atmosphere going and he gets done and he begins to look up and and he's like no he's like that one's not it so I was like you know if we don't get him out here he's going to be praying for everybody you know in this whole church and we got food going you know the cook you know it's time to eat and that's my one bill it's going off you know and it's about time to eat you know we got to get the minister out of here you know and and uh he's like no there's one more and so you know he's standing I'm standing next to him so I kind of you know and he just he kind of gets the hint he starts walking he's like no he's he's like no there's one more I was like yep yep that's that's wonderful you know and I kind of give him another little shove and then he goes no and then and then I I go back and I kind of go back to give him a real good shove and kind of go like this and he plants his foot and I'm like Wham I like okay all right well if this is the leading of the Lord I definitely don't want to be pushing against it and he goes she's right there and it was Elana and um kind of taught me a little something you know and it was like the Lord spoke to me he said the promise was UN to thee and to thy seed and I began to think about that and that that moment I I became very little it was kind of how brother Brandon talks about coming into the presence of God and and about how that you know that whenever you come into the presence of God that it's not something that you're bous it's not something that you're it's not something that but but you become almost as a dead man you know and and almost and at that moment right there I felt I felt God coming down and and begin to speak to my heart and just let me know that you know not only not not done with you I'm not done with your family and I'm not done with your wife and I'm not done with the church and I'm not done with with these other things and you know and and at that moment I just felt I felt I was very thankful that the Lord would speak to me specifically in them situations and that's what God does when he's when he's when he's talking to you and and and you begin to take these little experiences as just as well you know this is you know this is just you know just something happen chance you know it's just so happens and we live into such a society that oh we're just so lucky and oh we just are just lucky there's millions of people that are around this world but yet we come in contact with this message you know and you think about it how that when Jesus was on the earth I think a 16th of the of the population actually knew that he was even there but yet the disciples were the one oneon-one with him and yet we get to spend oneon-one with the message day by day or listening or or hearing God's voice and you know that was just one thing and I have a few things that's written down here and and the other day you know everybody knows I was having some issues with my truck I think this is like the third transmission I've been through and and uh and and then I had on my third one you know I had this little thing where it would the the shifter would pop off it would pop off and and I would have to literally get underneath the truck and I would have to put the little thing on the transmission you know so it would shift back and forth and and I got to doing it back got to doing it and and just it just became second nature I knew that after the third time I you know that I'm going to have to go underneath the truck and I'm going to have to do this and and I wasn't thinking and I had the truck turned on I think Joe was there yeah Joe was there and and Jonah you know Jonah was there and they were in the job and they were going and and I left the truck on which keeps power to the transmission and I got went under underneath the truck and and in order to get the in order to get the shifter cable on there you have to engage the shifter and push it all the way to the front well when I was underneath it when I was underneath it I grabbed the shifter and I put it in reverse and the truck began to roll and it and it R and it and and I was like is this moving I was like this truck moving and and it was and I was underneath it and and I grabbed the I grabbed the thing and I pulled myself out from underneath it and then not only that but it was rolling towards a telephone pole and so I had to I had to get in the truck and stop it all at one time and I was just thinking that quick that quick not paying attention that quick just could have got rolled over you know that quick and you know and I began to think about those things about how that the stories where there's they talked about you know uh uh men you know being being on the train tracks and how that you know God was dealing with them in their lives and how they you know they had their head on the train tracks and and you know God just miraculously pulled them off the tracks in time and I begin to thank you God you were dealing with that individual thank you for dealing me with like this taking care of me and and you know I be and another thing that kind of stood out to me is is that you know we were um we went to I can't remember where we were going but we were out of town and I think it was Lauren Jonathan's we were going to Lauren Jonathan's and we had stayed in a motel and and I was there and you know of course the big highlight for the kids is a swimming pool man man I don't care what they're doing they're being haved they're eating all their food and everything cuz they're going to the swimming pool you know and and and and all the kids got together and they they'd went out there that I had the three younger ones and I'm they're in the pool and and and they're just playing along the you know where the steps are and then you know just having a good time and all these things and and then all of a sudden you know I begin to look and I look over and I think Noah's touching the top of the steps but I'm not sure that he's touching the top of the steps and I began to look cuz he'd been quiet for a little while and I just realized that man he was just in the deep in he just struggling to getting all he could see was just the tips of his eyes you know just over the thing and and I was just thinking that quick that quick that quick and I began to think that that it was the Lord that it was the Lord that caught my attention you know and I'm not going to sit here and say oh because I've got you know super senses or I've got this or I'm a great dad or I'm a horrible dad you know I'm a horrible husband I'm a horrible a lot of things but the only thing that makes me who I am is God you know whatever that might be you know I'm not quite sure you know but but it was the Lord and you know and I began to think of um about one time you know that and this is minute but you know I was in I was asleep and you know Noah was there in the bed and and um and all of a sudden it was just like the Lord woke me up in the middle of the night and as I look over he's sliding head first off the bed as I just happened to wake up and the Lord's like the Lord spoke to me he's like you think that's a coincidence idence no no no and there's a lot of things in our lives that we could look at we could say is that just a coincidence no you know there's a lot of people there's a lot of people's children that drowned there's a lot of people that just get ran over in their vehicles working on it there's a you know there's a there's a lot of people who don't even know that God's dealing with their children but God specifically pointed to me out and said no look you know I was trying to get the man out the to I was trying to get the man out the service you know I was trying to get him on and get him out of there but God was like no I got something to say to you through him you know and and that's and I'm thankful for these things and you know I began to think about the story you know we was talking about you know the leper or we was talking about Thanksgiving and I begin to think about how that these leopards you know there was 10 of them and they all had a need every one of them had a need and the need meter the need meter was there therefore they came and they ran to him and said to have mercy upon us and every one of us who know knows who the need meter is and if you're not if you're in church long enough you'll find who it is you know it's not your Pastor you know it's not your it's not your your brother or your sister but we come here for needs that can't be met you know by by by a person's physical ability but it we're all in places in our lives that it's going to take a supernatural touch from the Lord to be able to do something and I began to think about how this leper how he had come but he out of all 10 then Jesus said Jesus says weren't there not 10 you know or wer there you know where's it where's the other nine you know how come you because he had something within him to give God glory because he realized where that come from and here this evening we have a lot of things like our brother was pointing out that in India they have tarps over the they have tarps over over the church but yet here we sit in an air conditioned bu building given to us by God and and about how that we have we have cars and some of us have so many cars we don't even want to tag them you know about how many you know some of us you know we've got you know we've got we've got we've got food we've got so much we've got so much food we want the commodity cheese you know I mean because that's the good stuff you know we know we know all we got so much food you know we've got shoes we've got we've got shirts we've got pants we got belts that don't fit we've got just all we've just got all these kinds of things and but yet but yet it's all it's all for us to get not be able to say oh I've provided this thing you know I make x amount at the end of at the end of the week I'm going to go take my family out to dinner but yet one thing that kind of stands out to me was when Israel was crossing the Jordan River that when they crossed the Jordan River God didn't tell them to do anything but he says I want you to lay these Stones up he says I want you to lay these Stones up because there's going to become a generation come behind you and they're going to ask where these Stones came from and you're going to say that on this day the Lord provided for us an ability and that's what we're doing in this Thanksgiving time this is what all of us are doing with our testimonies and all of us are doing about giving up because there's many you know you we talk about God filling up the gas can and God coming and putting tank in you know putting fuel in the tank but you know what I was told that story by Brother Duran years ago about how that how that God he was he was serving the lord and he was doing the working as you know God just asked you to work you know you know God will provide your needs God will provide whatever you have need of whether it's a check coming in the mail or whether it's whatever it might be he'll be the one that provides and you know what the Lord long time ago told showed him that the that the that the needle would go from E and it came all the way from all the way to all the way to fool you know and to me that's a stone that's something that I can look into and say Lord I'm broke Lord I I ain't got it all together and I ran out of gas and I've done this but you did this for brother Duren and you're not a respector of persons that if I've met you on the same grounds that you'll be able to meet me and you can feel my tank up and these stones that we're laying here this evening are something that every one of these young people can sit here and say if they've done it for brother Donald or if they done it for our brother Timothy or if they' done it for Joshua amen then God will do it for me and that's what I'm thankful for that we have a provider Jehovah Gyra he was made Jehovah Gyra before you even came to Earth because he knew that you would have a need and here this evening I'm thankful that God can meet the needs of his people and I'm thankful that the Lord is here and he's touching lives and he's touching Hearts still today because the scripture says that he's the same yesterday yesterday today and forever and that's what I Rely Upon and that that's God's blessings in our lives and and not only that now we can talk about a lot of a lot of fleshly things that were you know we could talk about a lot of things to where you know we have this and we thank God for that you know and if we're not careful we thank God for our wants we thank God for oh you know Lord I really thank you for you know providing the me the ability to put this accessory on my truck you know or Lord I really want to thank you you know for me to be being for providing me to be able to have you know uh uh you know a Nerf gun you know or being able to provide to have this or but but what about the real needs you know what about you know don't be the scripture says you know don't be don't be uh don't don't be amazed that the that the that the devils are cast out in your name but be glad that your name's written on the book of life because he's bringing it down to the essentials and that's where it's at is like like Joshua was saying he says that you know your child could have been born a certain way but yet God prevented it you know you know or or or you might not some people's kids don't even serve the Lord but yet we're filled with a church where people of of children that serve the Lord and love the Lord and we can bring them to a place where they can see the reality of God and and and and we can see him in his fullness and and so you know the real thing that I feel like that you I'm thankful for besides some of these things is is that God was has his word and he's able to to open it up till we can see and that is something important because not many people see the essence of the message right not a lot of people see what the message is really about it's not just a story about a possum right you know it's not just a story about you know God coming and pushing away a storm you know he a you know it's not just a story about you know him being able to you know Peg a you know Peg Bullseye head on or being able to Peg the end of a 22 but yet it was a call falling out of a people and the important thing is is that the people were able to respond and the only way that you're able to respond is if God put that seed within you and if God put that seed within you and gave you the ability to respond there's where our thankfulness is is that Lord out of millions of people amen out of millions of Native Americans that that are here you know and I'm sure there's there's a lot of other ones in Methodist churches we've got we've got our our brothers that are here out of millions of out of millions of electricians or or wherever you want to put yourself in the category that you want to that you're that you're in you could sit there and say God spoke to me through this message there's there's something that's screaming out that's calling me Lord I'm thankful for that I'm thankful because you could still be sitting under a bridge but yet you're a king just is what it is I mean you could you could be sitting there with no food on the table and you could be eating the crumbs and and cutting out or eating the last bit of canned food but yet God's but yet God's already got picked out what om you you belong him amen because it's the meek that inherits the Earth and and you know and these are just some things that just were brought to my mind and and um as our brother gets ready to come uh I would just like to close or stop by saying that you know God's been good to us this year amen he's provided many of our needs and many of our needs physically and yet spiritually and so I just like to leave you with that thought amen did you enjoy that amen well have you enjoyed yourself thus far tonight amen let's stand to our feet here tonight ask brother Caleb if Martin if he man coming and and um singing a special for us tonight but can we go back can we go to see oh my life you have been fa faithful oh my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am aable I will seeing of the goodness of God one more time all my life and all my life you have been faithful yes you have Lord oh my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God God bless you brother Caleb you may be seated hey man I got a couple testimonies in my family um I've recently just become self-employed and so uh I uh haven't had a whole lot of work but just a little bit of work here and there but I haven't got behind on any bills or nothing like that and I've heard a lot of horror stories of people first starting off so I just want to thank him for being my provider and then I got some testimonies concerning my children I remember when kylin was young he had a a seizure I don't know if everybody remembers that we had to take him to the hospital and we we prayed over him he had never had a Caesar since so and um Madison this one time we was all in Virginia and uh after Sean's camp meetings we was over at that uh condo that he rents and uh Madison was playing around in the shallow water the only halfway older person there was Ruthie and Madison fell in the deep water and was starting to go Downstream and M can't swim you know and Ruthie reached down there and grabbed her and pulled her out and then this other time concerning Micah we was uh he was probably one just learning to walk and I was working on the house outside and I had a 12ft ladder leaning against the house and the wind blew that ladder over and uh it fell on top of Micah but it landed right in the top rung like just landed right around him and you know how heavy them 12ft ladders are and so I just think thank the Lord for his providing and protecting Powers Jesus Lover of My Soul Jesus I I'll never let you go you've taken me from the my clay and set my feet upon a rock now I know I love you I need you though my world may fall I'll never let you go my savior my closest [Music] friend I will worship you until the very end Jesus Lover of My Soul Jesus I I'll never let you go you've taken me from the myy clay and set my

now listen if if if if no one's volunteering then you just have to start picking amen and but we enjoyed every every bit of it tonight and uh I I appreciate all of you Brothers appreciate all of you sisters and um you know we brag on the sisters because they're cooking every every Sunday and they deserve more bragging than what we give them and uh they outdone themselves [Applause] today but I appreciate the leadership of you men the leadership of you men keeping your your families in church and uh pointing them in the right direction teaching them how to be servants and uh how how to serve and to um uh be ministers even at a young age and amen you don't just all of a sudden become uh uh you know something it's it's it's something that has to be developed and so I appreciate all of you Brothers with with all of my heart I thank God for the solid men in our church amen hallelujah now the brothers clap for you sisters I was sort of expecting you sisters to start clapping a little bit sooner than that so I appreciate all the brothers in our church well that was still pretty lame [Applause] amen amen we sure sure love all of you praise the Lord [Laughter] amen might be loud moue but not loud no never mind amen we appreciate all of you and and I um all the ministry that was tonight you ministers that was just phenomenal I'm leaving this place just very very encouraged and um enjoyed all of the songs uh Caleb enjoyed that song amen appreciate brother Caleb you girls sister Tracy I've always told everyone I said oh if you ever hear sister Tracy sing that woman can sing amen and uh praise the Lord so we're just we're just have a lot to be thankful for now um it's we we usually dismiss on Wednesday night but what we do is we just we move the Wednesday night service up to Tuesday night and this will give this gives everyone the opp the sisters opportunity to to be cooking for their families or whatever the events are and so uh so we're going we're going to move the Wednesday night service up to Tuesday and um uh we usually have a lot of uh Martins crawling around uh pawy uh around Thanksgiving but we uh Sean John Jonathan and Elina none of them are coming this year and so we just mama's going to be crying all week long and uh but um uh so it's we hate that um because usually we get them we get them to preach for us amen and so um we we had the last few call and just you know of course when you're dealing with pastors and and uh things can always change and and so we just hate it that brother Jonathan and and brother sha and they won't be here to or any of the family um from out of state so you know we're uh that that's sort of that's that's we're used to having Pony with about 50 Martins crawling around and but uh amen but we're we're but we're glad to be here and glad GL glad that that that God's given us health and and we're looking forward to what God has so um now just you know this is probably the wrong time to be ask taking a a vote so we're probably not going to do it tonight but for the for the new year service we usually we've been having a New Year service here for for some time but we have been invited over to a meeting in um at at brother Tony um huh Roberts Tony Roberts is is having a new New Year's uh Revival and so this is not this is not going to be New Year's Services um but this is going to be Saturday and Sunday I am wondering who would be um and and and we're and we're still trying to um we we always look forward to that New Year's uh uh men cooking breakfast thing and um so here's here's what I'm there's my propos position for us to think about if we went up there for a for a Saturday night and a Sunday morning New Year's New Year's Eve is on Sunday New Year's Day is on Monday so we could we if we went up there for a service on Saturday night and and there's a lot they've got all kinds of um um air air be and Bs up there that maybe two or three families can can go in together and rent rent some of those and it would maybe you know I'm just I'm thinking out loud here we got two weeks uh before this happens um we could go for the Sunday Saturday night Sunday morning we would be supporting them and then come back uh we could we could be back get us a good night's rest and still have our our our Monday morning uh breakfast if everyone wanted to do something like that um it's it's it's an opportunity for Fellowship that we've not that we've not always had it's the place that brother um black goes to church that's where the blacks go also um brother Wheeler's youngest boy um son goes goes there Britney and Matt and we all know Britney and Matt and um Britney um you you know we've we've known her since a real little and and we love we really love both of them and um and then brother Jeremy Shriner is going to be the preacher so he's going to be preaching so it would be just a it would sort of be like a little a little reunion and it would also be a blessing to a sister Church and um so I want us to think about it we don't have to I I I I would like to um uh I need to let brother know here real soon uh what we're going to be doing I I just wonder is there would there is would would there be um a favor toward doing something like that does does that sound like it'd be something that that you all would would would like to do it's it's in um it's in vanban uh which is about did you look that up earlier someone in the office was looking that up earlier to two and a half to three hours okay so it' be about the same distance that Noel would be I have a feeling that if we if we um sort of organized it I bet we could probably get some some other friends over there you know to um to make it a wonderful time um if if it's not something that the majority can do or would want to do then um we wouldn't make it a church effort you know but if but I you know I would I would really like for us to do it as a church effort if we could and um uh I just I just know it would be a blessing uh for them brother black is really looking for Fellowship the church is looking for fellowship and so um this would be a wonderful opportunity to get sort of get us out of our comfort zone too we've been doing it here for so long and um others have had it and never never invited us and and so we just got our feelings hurt and said all right we'll start having our own and uh and so uh well we didn't really get our feelings hurt but there we we we tried to invite ourselves to one one time we I called Pastor up I here I hear you've got you've got one going i' I'd like to bring the church over and he said well sir it's this is a private deal and I said okay all right praise the Lord so uh wasn't saying praise the Lord but uh so it would be something to to think about it's not like you would have to go to work the next day and um um and and it would be well it's a lot of fun it's it's it's a lot of fun to get out and and um especially if a couple families went on an Airbnb and I'll just tell everybody you don't have to pay those prices I never hardly ever pay the I don't pay the what they're offering or what what's on there I amen always on the comments below give them a price and they'll usually accept it amen so that's the tip for me praise the Lord all right amen well what how are we going to get this back spiritual as we dismiss amen amen sure enjoyed enjoyed all of you preachers I I I love our preachers here love every one of them and and um your gifts are all unique you don't try to be anybody that you're not you love the Lord you love the people and and we're thankful for you amen what what are we going to [Music] sing of the goodness of Jesus and all he has done for me then my soul Cries Out hallelujah praise God for sa in me or when I think of the goodness of Jesus God bless you and all he has done for me we love you press the battle we got a Rapture to make thank God for saving me oh when I think of the goodness remember our sick ones amen remember Sister Denise keep sister Angie in our prayer Our Sick babies that are out amen just keep everyone that I'm even not mentioning you know who you are we're just praying for every one of them save in me oh when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all he has done for me then my soul Cries Out hallelujah praise God for saving me when I think of the goodness of Jesus is that all there is to that that sounds like a purse for me then my soul Cries Out hallelujah praise God for saving me oh when I think of the goodness of
