[43:02] kingdoms of this world has long uh uh to
[43:05] to build a Utopia here look wanted to uh
[43:08] you know create a perfect race there was
[43:10] the Muslim faith that is trying to
[43:12] convert the whole world Amen we've got
[43:15] the Jehovah's Witness that says we have
[43:17] got to keep educating people until one
[43:20] day we will push sin off of the Earth
[43:23] but you see education a man cannot help
[43:27] you religion cannot help you there is
[43:30] nothing that that man can do to help a
[43:34] man in anything that he does Amen they
[43:38] they have told us that education if we
[43:40] could just educate the poor and we can
[43:43] educate the illiterate if we can uh
[43:45] educate the urban uh cities if we can do
[43:48] these things the smarter he gets then
[43:51] amen then we can get them out of his
[43:54] Fallen condition but you see there's no
[43:57] remedy that can catch us because we keep
[44:00] falling and falling and falling amen can

[44:08] has proven that they have been raised in
[44:10] wealthy families they have been raised
[44:12] went to the best of the colleges they
[44:15] have done all of these things but yet in
[44:17] our in our in our Congress and our
[44:19] Senate and in our white house and our
[44:22] high places and our highly educated
[44:25] places we are finding that there's more
[44:27] depravity within those uh you know those
[44:31] sacred uh Halls of Education than there
[44:35] has ever been it's because we are in a
[44:38] fallen condition man has been falling it
[44:42] seems like the further the the more he's
[44:44] educated the further that he gets away
[44:47] from his remedy amen education is not
[44:51] our Salvation amen education is not what
[44:55] where God is ornamed it it seems like
[44:57] you know neurotic mankind even with all
[45:00] of this education you know the doctors
[45:02] are saying yes we know what's wrong with
[45:04] you amen bad here take a pill and this
[45:07] will make you feel better amen now the
[45:09] doctors are needing doctoring and amen
[45:12] now the psychiatrists are needing
[45:13] psychiatrists it just seems like there
[45:16] is nothing that can that can help us in
[45:20] this condition something is missing amen
[45:24] something is missing the sons of God
[45:28] have fallen from their condition
[45:32] their position can you say Amen
[45:35] now the Earth is missing their Master
[45:37] it's not a certain man the Pope's not a
[45:40] man doesn't have it amen it's not a
[45:43] certain it's God's Sons they are the
[45:46] ones that that have fallen from their
[45:49] position brother Branham said this he
[45:51] said something is lost and it's groaning
[45:52] it's trying to get back to its original
[45:54] condition he said would you imagine
[45:56] someone falling from the earth down into
[45:58] a deep pit somewhere and and was
[46:00] struggling and climbing and pulling he
[46:03] says they must by some means get out of
[46:05] this pit they're not in their original
[46:07] state and frantically they're screaming
[46:09] and they're clawing the walls and making
[46:11] noise or doing some way they're groaning
[46:14] because they want to get back to their
[46:18] original condition amen you can see that
[46:20] you know amen when my boys were younger
[46:22] they used to love it when you know we'd
[46:24] go to we'd go to Simple Simons to watch
[46:26] a ball game or uh or the McDonald's or
[46:29] somewhere amen and and there would there
[46:31] would have that hair thing you know you
[46:33] put this special stuff on your head and
[46:35] and and the boys would say Hey Dad
[46:37] that's what you need right there amen
[46:39] it'll make you grow hair again and amen
[46:42] and there's always amen man is looking
[46:45] for something to take away the wrinkles
[46:47] to to put the hair back on your head
[46:50] amen they're looking for a fountain of
[46:53] youth why because this body is Decay we
[46:58] want to be back where we fell from
[47:02] amen we're longing for that oh can you
[47:04] say amen amen Romans 8 and 8 19 says
[47:08] amen for the for the earnest expectation
[47:11] of the creature waiteth for the
[47:14] manifestation of the sons of God how
[47:16] many is glad for this message amen waits
[47:20] for the manifestation of God God is
[47:23] preparing you to go back to your
[47:27] position as sons of God Amen says for
[47:30] the creature was made subject to vanity
[47:32] not willingly but by reason of him who
[47:35] has subjected the same in Hope because
[47:37] the creature itself also shall be
[47:40] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[47:42] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[47:45] children of God for we know that the
[47:48] whole creation growneth and travaileth
[47:51] in pain until now and not only they but
[47:54] ourselves also which have the first
[47:56] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[47:59] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[48:02] adoption to with the Redemption of our
[48:05] body amen so we can see the Apostle Paul
[48:08] is saying that we are all longing for
[48:12] that position
[48:14] we're longing to go back where we fell
[48:16] from can you say Amen now humanity is
[48:21] under that penalty from God Amen God
[48:26] called man to rule from his soul that's
[48:30] that God part of him it's from that Soul
[48:32] yet they've been mankind is is spiraling
[48:36] out of Amen out of control they're
[48:39] sinking deeper and deeper amen it seems
[48:43] that there's no end or there's no bottom
[48:46] it's just humanity is under the sentence
[48:50] of death at the end of the day there's
[48:53] not a senator that is exempt there's not
[48:55] a preacher or a pope amen there's not a
[48:58] scientist there's not a president that
[49:00] is exempt we are all under the
[49:02] condemnation the day you eat is the day
[49:06] you die can you say man you see God
[49:09] created you with a specific Design
[49:13] Perfection to rule to Reign to have love
[49:18] to have peace to have joy to have well
[49:22] praise the Lord amen but you see Satan
[49:25] comes in and he deforms amen he deforms
[49:30] what God has done now Satan is not a
[49:33] Creator so Satan comes in takes the good
[49:36] that God has created and he begins a man
[49:40] to pervert it ain't my brother Brandon
[49:42] would use it like this he says God gave
[49:44] the power to transform I'm going to call
[49:47] this fellow here amen not the power to
[49:49] create again he had the power to
[49:51] deformed not transformed but to deform
[49:55] now anything to form is taken from its
[49:58] original con estate there is something
[50:00] that's going wrong with it some years
[50:02] ago on patrol going through there in the
[50:04] corn fields I I would think there was a
[50:06] limb I had it blown off of a tree and
[50:08] had fell over a cornice a stalk of corn
[50:12] and the stock was trying its best to get
[50:14] back up straight like it was supposed to
[50:17] be amen but it was deformed because
[50:19] something had happened the stick was
[50:22] laying over it and then the wild creeper
[50:25] in the field
[50:26] which many of you men here and maybe
[50:28] some of you women if you're if you're
[50:30] from Kentucky the women uses the whole
[50:33] just the same as the man amen to get out
[50:35] on the field with a hole and and we call
[50:37] the old gooseneck Amen to chop out the
[50:40] creepers for if you didn't get those
[50:42] Creepers out where the corn was in the
[50:45] roll like this then the creeper would
[50:47] reach over and grab a hold of that corn
[50:50] and wrap itself around gradually so easy
[50:53] so slightly that you would hardly tell
[50:56] with that that it was rapping and
[50:58] finally it gets stronger and stronger
[51:01] and pulls the corn till it's so deformed
[51:04] pulls it against itself and wraps itself
[51:06] around its own Vine deforming it from
[51:10] what it was to something else yet it's
[51:13] still corn but it's deformed corn we are
[51:18] still in the image of God but some of us
[51:21] are so deformed as sons of God that we
[51:23] walk contrary to his word and to his way
[51:26] 8 that he had for us and provided for us
[51:29] to walk setting something the world
[51:31] twists us out of the way and pulls Us
[51:34] close to it away from the straight the
[51:36] narrow strip that God planted Us in to
[51:39] be Sons and Daughters of God Amen sin
[51:42] has done this evil thing to the sons and
[51:45] daughters it's the deformer I know this
[51:48] seems rather strange to speak of it in
[51:50] this way but to deform that's what he
[51:53] was he deformed or perverted pervert
[51:56] means to be changed over from something
[51:58] different and deformed is the same thing
[52:01] is to be brought over and deformed and
[52:04] made into another way yet it was still
[52:07] the same seed but it's deformed are
[52:09] y'all hearing me still sons of God
[52:14] steal the seed of God but yet Satan
[52:19] deforming it amen I want to tell you
[52:21] there are still sons of God that are out
[52:23] here in this world today Hallelujah
[52:25] brother Joe you always were a seed of
[52:27] God you always were a child of God
[52:30] that's what Redemption means is to buy
[52:32] you back redeem your back bring you back
[52:35] to your place amen God's got some names
[52:38] that were in that Lamb's Book of Life
[52:40] God's seen you before the world was ever
[52:42] created sin came in and deformed you but
[52:45] God's got a Divine Purpose for you he's
[52:47] got a Divine call upon you and it
[52:50] doesn't matter what Satan does I believe
[52:52] there is a power Among Us that is
[52:56] greater than any power that the devil
[52:59] could ever hold over you
[53:01] man everything about Humanity seems to
[53:05] be spiraling down Amen in a downward
[53:08] motion the longer we live on this Earth
[53:11] the worse it gets can I hear an amen
[53:16] each new generation I believe it was the
[53:17] Apostle Paul in Romans 7 and 24 says oh
[53:21] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[53:25] me from the body of this death amen who
[53:30] shall deliver me I remember a story
[53:33] of brother that brother Branham tells of
[53:35] Billy Paul Iman and how that that Billy
[53:39] Paul had had got into a habit and Iman
[53:43] he he says about two or three years ago
[53:45] Billy Paul had got to running around
[53:48] there and that's the reason I had to
[53:50] send him to uh what Waxahachie to the
[53:52] schools or public school with a bunch of
[53:54] boys and things and all smoking
[53:56] cigarettes and things and Billy came
[53:57] home one day and and said how you get
[54:00] along Daddy and I seen a vision pop over
[54:02] him and I I said come here for a minute
[54:04] now I want to talk to you and he said
[54:07] what is it Daddy and I said what are you
[54:09] doing smoking cigarettes and he says I'm
[54:12] not
[54:13] and I said don't lie to me Billy and he
[54:16] commenced to crying and he said Daddy I
[54:17] won't do it no more Daddy and I went on
[54:20] out and he went on out and he kept on
[54:23] doing it he wasn't hiding it he can't
[54:26] hide it no no no no so I seen a vision
[54:28] and the Lord showed me that really had
[54:31] disobeyed me and and had jumped through
[54:33] a window and was going laughing and head
[54:36] over heels like that down on through
[54:39] eternity turning over and over and when
[54:41] I came out of the vision I was screaming
[54:43] to the top of my voice oh God don't take
[54:45] my boy only boy I have don't take him
[54:48] Lord I was screaming to the top of my my
[54:50] voice and I told Billy and so Billy that
[54:54] day amen uh he went fishing been hanging
[54:57] on down at the river a lot and there was
[55:00] a man
[55:01] from India there to see me and some
[55:03] other ministers and and we went down
[55:05] into New Albany there with my wife and
[55:08] and and she had to go down there and do
[55:10] something another and and so we went
[55:12] down was I was sitting and talking with
[55:14] the ministers and all at once something
[55:16] said to me get out of here right quick
[55:19] and I thought it was my imagination and
[55:21] I said well now brothers were fixing to
[55:22] go to India as soon as we possibly can
[55:25] and something said get out of here and
[55:28] get to yourself and I I and I I got out
[55:31] of the car and I said excuse me Brethren
[55:33] just a minute I want to go around the
[55:35] corner I'm going to run around the
[55:36] corner and I looked and nobody was
[55:38] looking I said father what is it and he
[55:40] said go to Billy at once and I ran back
[55:42] real quick and Mita was coming up the
[55:44] street my wife and I said hurry hurry
[55:46] hurry name it something's wrong with
[55:49] Billy and we run jumped in the car and
[55:51] took out the Jefferson Bill about five
[55:53] or six miles and when I went into the
[55:55] yard my mother-in-law was standing in
[55:56] the yard screaming to the top of her
[55:58] voice Billy's dying we got him in the
[56:00] hospital and I said what happened she
[56:03] said well he came up me he came down
[56:05] here and had a sore throat and and he
[56:07] was afraid he was going to catch him
[56:09] with that sore throat and tell him he

[56:13] went down there and your good friend the
[56:14] best best doctor in the nation amen one
[56:16] of the basses Dr Samuel dare and and he
[56:19] gave him a shot of penicillin and swell

[56:24] just about three minutes and he ran up
[56:26] there and they wrapped him in blankets
[56:27] and rushed him to the hospital and I ran
[56:30] out there real quick and here come the
[56:32] doctor down there and took off his hat
[56:33] and says Billy I've killed your boy I
[56:36] said oh doc surely not I run into the
[56:39] room and they they had oxygen over him
[56:41] and everything and pumping and giving
[56:42] him adrenaline
[56:44] over his heart and his his heart just
[56:46] going down and down and I said could I
[56:50] could I be with him a moment and so he
[56:52] just walked out of the room and I knelt
[56:54] down put my hands up on on him and I
[56:56] said dear God please hasn't my heart
[56:59] been broken enough in my days Jesus

[57:23] falling like that turning over and over
[57:26] like it was a couple of nights before
[57:28] that when I had seen the vision and then
[57:31] I seen two big arms come out and catch
[57:34] him like this and start burying him
[57:37] right back up going right back up like
[57:41] that and I raised up and Billy turned
[57:44] around just just as black as he could be
[57:46] in his lips swelled way out his eyes had
[57:48] turned real red turned back and he said

[57:53] Daddy and I said I'm standing right here

[58:21] much more can God take humanity take my
[58:26] Fallen Heart Take Your Fallen heart amen

[58:32] today there is a position amen and it's
[58:36] not depression it's not discouragement
[58:39] it's not sin it's not hell it's not
[58:43] unforgiveness but there is a position
[58:46] for the believer the position is what
[58:50] God placed you in at the beginning as
[58:53] Sons and Daughters of God can you say
[58:57] Amen
[58:58] man
[59:00] Hallelujah brother Branham tells the
[59:02] story of when he uh when he was a little
[59:05] boy Iman and as a boy aren't hunting
[59:09] with his friend and his friend has shot
[59:11] his legs a mountain the backside of his
[59:14] legs just totally blew blew them off and
[59:16] they mine he had no muscle in the back
[59:19] portion of his legs even he even threw
[59:22] out of his his adulthood amen and so
[59:24] there he was he was he and he had lost
[59:27] so much blood and and they tried to give
[59:30] him this and that and he just kept
[59:32] sinking prayer there and further amen
[59:34] and then and as he was as big he began
[59:37] to lose Consciousness and amen he says I
[59:41] was so weak and I'd lost all that blood
[59:43] and I I thought I was sinking into an
[59:45] endless eternity many of you have heard
[59:47] me tell it before sinking into an
[59:49] endless eternity first I was going down
[59:52] like the clouds and through the darkness
[59:54] and sinking down and down and down and
[59:57] first thing you know I was in the
[59:58] regions of the lost and there I scream
[1:00:00] dreamed and I looked and I am there just
[1:00:03] everything there was no Foundation to it
[1:00:05] I I could never stop falling for
[1:00:08] eternity it looked like I was going to
[1:00:10] fall there was no stopping nowhere he
[1:00:13] says oh what a difference from the
[1:00:15] vision I had here not long ago of being
[1:00:18] in glory with the people what to
[1:00:20] contrast amen but in this I was falling
[1:00:24] and finally I screamed for my daddy of

[1:02:10] atheist that is having to preach to us

[1:03:16] mournful sound I ever heard it was the
[1:03:18] office feeling even a literal burning
[1:03:21] fire would be more pleasure to the side
[1:03:23] of what that was
[1:03:25] these Visions have never been wrong it
[1:03:28] was just one of the most horrible
[1:03:29] feelings I've ever had amen I heard a
[1:03:33] noise and it sounded like a haunted
[1:03:34] Affair and women and they had that green
[1:03:37] stuff and you just just could see it in
[1:03:40] their face and the green stuff under
[1:03:42] their eyes and their eyes looked like

[1:03:46] know the pain run back on their eyes and
[1:03:49] they were going

[1:13:08] and brother Branham would say
[1:13:11] man
[1:13:12] and God
[1:13:14] hiding himself in Simplicity then
[1:13:16] revealing him in the same
[1:13:18] he says when man before he sinned
[1:13:21] he said when man sinned he separated
[1:13:24] himself from God and crossed a great
[1:13:27] Chasm and put himself in death on this
[1:13:29] side
[1:13:30] he left there was no way back
[1:13:33] exactly there was no way for him to get
[1:13:35] back
[1:13:37] oh my
[1:13:38] now
[1:13:39] he says there he said amen he says but
[1:13:44] then when he did God accepted a
[1:13:47] substitute amen I took it back and when
[1:13:51] he did he he it was a lamb or a goat or
[1:13:54] a sheep or something for blood amen
[1:13:57] which Adam spoke of her Abel spoke of on
[1:14:00] the other side of the chasm
[1:14:02] see on that side he's the son of God
[1:14:05] he's an offspring from God he's an
[1:14:08] inheritance of the earth he can control
[1:14:10] nature he can speak into existence he's
[1:14:13] a Creator himself he's an offspring of
[1:14:16] God
[1:14:16] but when he crossed he separated his
[1:14:20] sonship and now he's a sinner by Nature
[1:14:23] he's under the hands and Dominion of
[1:14:25] Satan
[1:14:26] God took a sacrifice a chemical of the
[1:14:30] blood
[1:14:31] but the blood of bulls and goats did not
[1:14:33] divorce sin it only covered sin if I've
[1:14:36] got a red spot on my hand and covered it
[1:14:39] with white the red spot's still there
[1:14:41] it's still there see but God sit down
[1:14:45] from heaven a bleach for sin
[1:14:48] it was the blood of his own son
[1:14:52] and that's when our sin our confessed
[1:14:55] sin drops into God's Bleach then try to
[1:14:58] find it again the coloring of sin goes
[1:15:01] back through the mediators down through
[1:15:02] time until it hits the accuser Satan and
[1:15:06] lays on him until the day of judgment
[1:15:08] what happens to the Sun
[1:15:10] he becomes a perfect fellowship with the
[1:15:13] father again
[1:15:15] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:15:17] with no remembrance of sin against him
[1:15:19] no more there's no more stain of bleach
[1:15:22] or sin can be seen anywhere he's free
[1:15:26] Hallelujah can I hear a Hallelujah
[1:15:29] just as that Clorox or that ink can
[1:15:32] never be Inked no more because it's
[1:15:34] broke up and sent back again when can
[1:15:37] fast sin is confessed and dipped into
[1:15:41] the blood a man or a woman that's been
[1:15:43] dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ it
[1:15:46] kills all symptoms every molecule of sin
[1:15:48] goes back to the devil and lays on him
[1:15:51] till the day of judgment where his
[1:15:53] eternal destination will be thrown into
[1:15:56] the Lake of Fire and the chasm is
[1:15:58] bridged and never to come into
[1:16:00] remembrance no more a man stands
[1:16:02] Justified as a son of God
[1:16:08] oh
[1:16:10] the power of the blood when we needed
[1:16:13] that when we needed it God sent us
[1:16:15] one that could that could bridge the gap
[1:16:21] on that side you're a son
[1:16:23] on this side you're a sinner
[1:16:26] and there was no way to get back over
[1:16:29] there was no way to get back
[1:16:31] but Jesus Christ came
[1:16:33] God created himself a body
[1:16:36] and he took he took the the
[1:16:40] that invisible God
[1:16:46] he made a bridge
[1:16:48] so that you can get back to where you
[1:16:52] fell from
[1:16:56] so that you can get back to your
[1:16:58] position again well praise the Lord
[1:17:02] amen so that you can get back hallelujah
[1:17:06] how many wants to be back
[1:17:08] hallelujah amen he says now Moses under
[1:17:12] the blood of bulls and goats with this
[1:17:15] confession in the word of God
[1:17:17] God can take that simple man and put his
[1:17:20] words in his mouth
[1:17:22] and he proved he was Jehovah's servant
[1:17:24] for he could walk out there and Jehovah
[1:17:27] spoke to him by a vision and he walked
[1:17:30] out there and stretched his hands toward
[1:17:31] the east
[1:17:32] now God had spoke to him it's God's
[1:17:34] thought God uses man God spoke to him
[1:17:36] it's right
[1:17:37] he said go stretch your rod
[1:17:41] in your hand towards the east and say
[1:17:43] flies
[1:17:44] Moses under the blood of that goat
[1:17:48] sheep walked out there took that stick
[1:17:52] reached toward the East and said thus
[1:17:54] saith the Lord let there be flies
[1:17:58] He Walked on back it had already since

[1:18:32] the presence of God and his own words

[1:18:56] was it it was God the Creator hiding
[1:18:59] himself in a simple man I want to ask
[1:19:01] you something if the blood of bulls and
[1:19:04] goat can be be used for a bleach which
[1:19:08] can only cover could could put a man in
[1:19:11] a position to speak the creative word of
[1:19:14] God and to bring flies into existence
[1:19:17] why do you stumble at The Bleach of

[1:19:31] is still God

[1:33:24] there it's not in the mind of God Satan
[1:33:27] might bring it up he might bring it up
[1:33:29] in your memory but when you stand there
[1:33:31] you are Justified before God the blood
[1:33:34] has done what nothing else could do
[1:33:39] think about it sling demon t
[1:33:42] sling the enmity means the hostility is

[1:34:09] and to them that were nigh for through
[1:34:12] him we both have access by one Spirit
[1:34:16] unto the father now therefore you are no
[1:34:19] more strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:34:22] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:34:25] household of God anything you ask in
[1:34:31] mind are you all hearing me if you speak
[1:34:34] to that mountain and doubt not in your
[1:34:38] heart you can have what you say it's not
[1:34:42] saying after the Rapture you're going to
[1:34:44] have it you don't need it on the other
[1:34:45] side of the rapture
[1:34:47] you need it right now
[1:34:50] and the blood has put you back in that
[1:34:54] position to believe God
[1:35:02] the blood has put you back in that
[1:35:05] position
[1:35:07] to where you can believe God for the
[1:35:09] supernatural
[1:35:11] Hallelujah
[1:35:12] well praise the Lord
[1:35:14] the powers of Satan
[1:35:16] over you came by sin
[1:35:19] sickness came by sin
[1:35:22] depression came by sin
[1:35:24] oppression came by sin
[1:35:28] death comes by sin
[1:35:33] cancer comes by sin
[1:35:37] any sickness came by sin
[1:35:40] because of sin When sin came into the
[1:35:43] world all of these other things came
[1:35:47] when you deal with a sin problem
[1:35:50] then you deal with a fruit
[1:35:53] when you cut the root
[1:35:57] you got the fruit
[1:36:00] so that means I can
[1:36:02] I can before God in this Fallen by
[1:36:07] and come with the blood of Jesus
[1:36:10] and says I know that Fallen man
[1:36:14] is condemned to die
[1:36:17] doctor says I've got cancer and there's
[1:36:19] no way to live
[1:36:22] and a man can stand up with that faith
[1:36:25] and says but there's no sin found in me
[1:36:28] anymore
[1:36:29] it's been dealt with by the blood of
[1:36:32] Jesus Christ
[1:36:33] now I'm coming up to the throne of grace
[1:36:36] I'm coming up not begging I'm coming up
[1:36:39] very confident the blood has taken away
[1:36:44] my sin and I'm asking God that you heal
[1:36:48] me of my cancer or the devil's cancer
[1:36:51] and God can well you'll hear me
[1:36:56] you can believe God in your life you can
[1:36:59] believe God for your family you can
[1:37:01] believe God for your children you can
[1:37:03] believe God in every situation
[1:37:06] well praise the Lord
[1:37:08] brother Brandon would be he says let me
[1:37:10] explain it to you like this all sin and
[1:37:12] sickness was settled when God dealt with
[1:37:15] it at Calvary some 1900 years ago when
[1:37:17] his son saved died to save us from sin
[1:37:20] and sickness he was wounded for our
[1:37:22] transgressions where the stripes we were
[1:37:24] healed that's what the scripture says I
[1:37:26] don't mean that he made one atonement
[1:37:28] for your sickness and one for your sins
[1:37:29] he made one atonement and that was for
[1:37:32] sin and when you deal with sin you've
[1:37:34] got to deal with every attribute of sin
[1:37:36] the human race as we're taught in the
[1:37:38] scripture didn't have any sickness
[1:37:40] before sin came then When sin came in
[1:37:42] sickness was issued in as an attribute
[1:37:45] of sin which has to bring death sin is
[1:37:48] death sickness follows sin worry follow
[1:37:51] sin did you ever notice how horrible of
[1:37:55] a thing where he is there's not value in
[1:37:58] it at all can you say man but you can
[1:38:01] come through the blood well praise the
[1:38:04] Lord
[1:38:05] I just need to know I just need to do
[1:38:07] this now I need another scripture I I
[1:38:09] just I I just say okay I'll give you
[1:38:11] another scripture
[1:38:12] Colossians 1 and 20 and having made
[1:38:14] peace
[1:38:16] blood of his cross
[1:38:19] by him to reconcile
[1:38:23] all things unto himself by him I say
[1:38:26] whether they be things in Earth or
[1:38:28] things in heaven
[1:38:30] and you that were sometimes alienated in
[1:38:33] the enemies by your mind by Wicked works
[1:38:36] yet now hath he reconciled
[1:38:38] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:38:42] are you ready for this
[1:38:44] to present you holy

[1:42:45] to the world that anointed bridegroom
[1:42:49] which foreordained you has washed you by
[1:42:52] the blood or by the washing of the water

[1:45:26] a minute I'm gonna finish reading that
[1:45:28] but y'all remember
[1:45:30] amen
[1:45:34] that
[1:45:35] that uh

[1:45:43] and uh
[1:45:44] he was he was getting that those
[1:45:47] discernments I mean they were eight and
[1:45:48] he was brother Brandon was reading them
[1:45:49] off
[1:45:52] and so was and he was a cigarette smoker
[1:45:55] and uh he came he came up into that line
[1:46:00] and uh
[1:46:03] but he repented as he was coming up said
[1:46:04] Lord forget me
[1:46:06] I want to lay those things down
[1:46:09] and when he walked into the presence of
[1:46:10] the prophet
[1:46:13] the prophet could not even he could not
[1:46:15] say now now brother Branham had already
[1:46:18] been telling those he says now he's now
[1:46:20] if you'll put down those cigarettes
[1:46:22] and he would he would simply he said the
[1:46:24] Lord will heal you with this
[1:46:25] another place he said well he said
[1:46:27] there's one thing that's holding you up
[1:46:28] from your Victory and that's those
[1:46:30] cigarettes

[1:46:32] cigarettes
[1:46:33] and and and he'll he'll he'll perform
[1:46:36] his word or whatever
[1:46:37] so this man comes up and he's thinking

[1:46:44] cigarettes in fact he seen him as a as a
[1:46:47] clean Son of God

[1:46:56] someone had asked him afterwards he said
[1:47:00] he said hey I repented of it before I
[1:47:02] got to the prophet
[1:47:04] and the Lord took away though that that
[1:47:06] desire for cigarettes
[1:47:09] you hear that we're talking about
[1:47:11] minutes before he stood in front of the
[1:47:12] prophet and God couldn't even reveal it
[1:47:14] to his prophet
[1:47:17] the sin
[1:47:19] was repented of
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:29] another another woman sister Bruce in in
[1:47:32] that in her testimony she said oh

[1:52:31] and he'll use it he'll build a complex
[1:52:34] around you until you don't even feel

[1:53:36] that church well that that preacher says
[1:53:38] it's okay well that one's the reason and
[1:53:39] this one and this one you've got to
[1:53:41] bring that sin out before God
[1:53:44] put it under his blood
[1:53:46] because his hand is here his grace has
[1:53:49] been extended to this age greater than
[1:53:51] any other age I want to say any other
[1:53:54] race there has been no other Prophet
[1:53:57] messenger like has been in this last age
[1:54:00] God Vindicated over and over and over
[1:54:03] and over and the and the beauty of it is
[1:54:06] it's all on tape
[1:54:10] to where you can see that God was here
[1:54:13] in a supernatural way
[1:54:16] you know God was with him
[1:54:19] and when that Prophet could stand up
[1:54:20] like there was Sister Bruce
[1:54:23] when that prophet's looking through
[1:54:25] those eyes
[1:54:26] and since Mr Bruce
[1:54:28] I'm looking over your life
[1:54:30] there's not this is the same Prophet
[1:54:32] this is the same prophet
[1:54:34] this is the same prophet
[1:54:36] that when the girl came in and
[1:54:38] she was almost insane
[1:54:41] she literally home was almost insane
[1:54:44] she was a
[1:54:46] uh
[1:54:47] Sunday school teacher or something of
[1:54:49] that nature
[1:54:53] she's been in it in and out of
[1:54:55] institution she was gone
[1:54:58] finally her Methodist Pastor said go
[1:55:00] down and talk to brother Branham
[1:55:02] he might be able to help you
[1:55:04] she gets an interview with him in his
[1:55:06] and she's just nervous she's just she's
[1:55:08] out of her mind she's up and down and in
[1:55:11] and out and brother Brandon's just
[1:55:12] sitting there talking he starts talking
[1:55:13] about us about a deer hunting and starts
[1:55:16] talking about this and that and trying
[1:55:17] to just calm her spirit down and
[1:55:20] finally a vision breaks out over her
[1:55:27] he asked her about that man
[1:55:31] tells her exactly where who she was with
[1:55:34] where he worked
[1:55:36] where things took place at she said
[1:55:39] don't say that don't say that it's don't
[1:55:41] don't say that
[1:55:43] she said that's all been forgiven he
[1:55:45] said no it hasn't been forgiven no no
[1:55:48] I couldn't see it if it was forgiven
[1:55:51] she said I made that right with God he
[1:55:53] says you didn't make that right with
[1:55:55] your wife
[1:55:57] or your husband
[1:56:00] he said you didn't sin against God you
[1:56:02] sinned against your vow to your husband
[1:56:04] she said I can't tell him I can't tell
[1:56:06] him
[1:56:06] he'll kill me he'll he'll divorce me a
[1:56:09] wreck her home she says he says well

[1:56:14] anyways you're going to lose your mind
[1:56:16] and at the end you'll go to hell
[1:56:20] she said I can't tell him
[1:56:22] he says
[1:56:23] that's up to you and finally
[1:56:25] he gets up walks out of the room
[1:56:31] and then as he was beginning to look and
[1:56:33] all of a sudden there came another
[1:56:34] vision

[2:05:07] one time

[2:05:10] the Bible says that he went across the
[2:05:13] seas
[2:05:15] I don't believe her by the way amen okay
[2:05:18] she came he came across the seas
[2:05:22] for one man
[2:05:26] and the Bible says he was a maniac
[2:05:31] there was a man that was living in the
[2:05:32] tombs
[2:05:34] the Devils had got so on him that he
[2:05:36] drove him from his family
[2:05:38] drove him from his his wife his children
[2:05:42] he was now living in the Tomb the
[2:05:44] graveyard
[2:05:47] the Bible says that they had tried to
[2:05:48] put chains on him
[2:05:50] and he would break the chains out
[2:05:52] with such demonic strength he was a
[2:05:54] Madman
[2:05:56] evil man
[2:06:01] you could have started but just wanted
[2:06:02] to lie to Mama and then before you know
[2:06:04] it it just he'd started going then and
[2:06:06] then it turned into a something else and
[2:06:07] then one sin turned to another and now
[2:06:09] here he is
[2:06:11] the Bible says
[2:06:13] Jesus
[2:06:15] had to go across that sea
[2:06:19] now the devil knew the ship was hidden
[2:06:21] in that direction that he that that he
[2:06:24] was living in that man
[2:06:26] and the devil tried his best to sink
[2:06:28] Jesus and the disciples he had a storm
[2:06:31] that came up sent a storm and There Were
[2:06:35] Ten Thousand Devils trying to sink Jesus
[2:06:38] in that ship trying to sink those boys
[2:06:41] those disciples in that ship
[2:06:44] Jesus said I told you I was going to
[2:06:46] meet you on the other side
[2:06:48] I told you we had a purpose for going to
[2:06:50] the other side
[2:06:51] I gave my word I'm going to the other
[2:06:54] side because there's a man
[2:06:56] in Gardena
[2:06:58] amen and there when he got to go to
[2:07:01] gadara
[2:07:03] Mary come to the wild man
[2:07:06] and just his presence
[2:07:08] those demons begin to scream out
[2:07:11] why have you come to torment us before
[2:07:13] our time
[2:07:15] just as presence caused them
[2:07:19] to start speaking to him
[2:07:22] why have you come to torment us before
[2:07:24] our time
[2:07:27] Jesus said what's your name
[2:07:31] Legion for we are many
[2:07:34] [Music]
[2:07:37] Jesus had already left his healing
[2:07:40] campaign
[2:07:42] he had left thousands of people over
[2:07:44] here
[2:07:45] told the disciples get in the ship
[2:07:47] I'm going to meet you get in the ship
[2:07:50] get away from the crowd and I'll meet
[2:07:51] you and as is going over Satan knows
[2:07:53] what's going on Satan's trying to
[2:07:55] destroy Satan's trying to keep him from
[2:07:57] the purpose Jesus gets on the other side
[2:07:59] after he battles all those devils and
[2:08:02] now here's this do you think Jesus is
[2:08:03] just going to
[2:08:05] have a nice little polite church service
[2:08:10] Jesus came purposefully for this man
[2:08:13] that was bound by thousands of devils
[2:08:18] you know what Jesus done
[2:08:22] Jesus says come out of him
[2:08:26] and those Devils I said wait a minute
[2:08:30] if you're going to cast us out
[2:08:34] won't you let us go into those pigs see
[2:08:36] demons have got to have bodies
[2:08:40] they gotta have bodies
[2:08:43] let us go in those pigs and the Bible
[2:08:45] says that there were two thousand pigs
[2:08:48] and they got into the pigs
[2:08:51] and ran 2 000 pigs right off into the
[2:08:55] river
[2:08:57] and drowned them all
[2:08:59] that devil is mad
[2:09:01] that devil got into those pigs those
[2:09:04] swine took them and made and drowned
[2:09:06] them
[2:09:09] but the man of the gadarenes
[2:09:15] the man that had so many devils
[2:09:18] the man where the devil would soon take
[2:09:21] him and attack him and it would throw
[2:09:22] him in the fire and he would and he
[2:09:24] would rip his clothes and it would be
[2:09:26] like a person with epilepsy
[2:09:29] a man that couldn't live with his family
[2:09:31] or no one he was a Madman he was insane
[2:09:33] he was crazy
[2:09:34] [Music]
[2:09:36] there was no hope for him
[2:09:38] [Music]
[2:09:40] Jesus came
[2:09:42] Jesus didn't wrestle with the Devils
[2:09:44] Jesus just said
[2:09:47] come out of him
[2:09:52] you know what happened

[2:10:17] he's in his right mind
[2:10:19] and he asked Jesus
[2:10:21] can I go with you
[2:10:23] Jesus says well
[2:10:26] you need to stay behind them
[2:10:29] because he had a mission there to do
[2:10:32] and the Bible says the fame of this man
[2:10:35] being healed and delivered set free he
[2:10:39] was just as nice of a man as one of your
[2:10:41] daddies
[2:10:43] just as nice as could be
[2:10:49] Jesus Took a mind that the devil thought
[2:10:51] he was going to destroy
