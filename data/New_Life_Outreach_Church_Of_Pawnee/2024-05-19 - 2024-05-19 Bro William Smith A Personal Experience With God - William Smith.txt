window gave me a text and said he's praying for the service and each and every one of you he uh is preaching this morning and so we're just thankful for having a pastor that's that can go sometimes and get away most of the time when he gets goes out and does try to have some rest he has to preach but uh that's uh a calling that he has in his life and and so and I believe brother Wendell is a wonderful wonderful guy wonderful Pastor that we have amen if we can open our Bibles this morning it's it's good to see our visitors this morning God bless you and uh we have a lot out today and uh I think brother John if I'm not mistaken I could be Absol abolutely wrong might not be this weekend but this weekend I think he's preaching for brother Bryce and I believe that's the reason why he's not here this morning I think and so let's pray for him this morning and his family and uh but here in acts like to read about eight verses here and um then we're going to go to Romans 10 and read a verse there but here in Acts 3 and 1 it says then Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called the beautiful to ask arms of them that enter into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go in into the temple ask of arms and Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John and said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something from them and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and he immediately his feet and ankles and Bones received strength and he leaped up and stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God let's go to Romans 10 Romans 10 and 17 it says so the so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God if I can Minister a little thought this morning brother brandom has already preached this sermon before and I just brother wendle was ministering the other day and he talked about experience he just kind of went over just a minute of it and then he just kept on preaching his thought but a personal experience with God a personal experience with god let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just love you father God Lord I'm shaking in my shoes this morning Lord Lord these are your people Lord Lord we have our guest here here this morning Lord and Lord we just ask you lord to bless them Father God bless each and every heart that's in this room father God lord those that couldn't make it to church this morning for being sick or they're out of town Lord we just ask you father God to be with them Lord we just ask you Lord to take complete control of the service this morning move me aside Lord and you speak through this vessel as you've done many many times to the vessels that's up in this Pulpit father God lord just be with us Lord be with brother Wendell father God as he ministers this morning be with Brother John this morning as he ministers this morning there in Clare Moore father God lord be with brother Josh as he's out ministering the gospel father God lord we just ask you Lord Jesus to come once again speak to our hearts Lord let us have that great experience with you Lord Jesus every day have a new experience of the word of God in our lives Lord weay pray in Jesus name we pray amen you may be seated experience with God a personal experience a lot of times that people say that they they believe in God they given their heart to God I believe in that I believe that they've been been saved but we can't live off of just that experience there's a foundation that you and I have to to to uh get up and that is Christ Jesus and then we're on that Foundation we have to build our life upon it and it takes the Holy Spirit to help you and I to have these experiences with God but we have to be willing to use our ears instead of our mouths okay because when we use our ears then we're following something that's being spoke of a lot of times we let our minds wander and then we speak and then we move our minds are corrupted we were born shape of iniquity speaking Lies We have to have a new mind a new spirit so that we can even have fellowship with God right without those two we will never get close to God that old man will not ever get close to God because he's always thinking that he knows more than God when we do things that we know that's against the word of God you are placing yourself over God speak when he says not to do something and you say and I say that we have an experience with God when we are being rebellious absolutely to the word of God there is an experience that you might have had one day but you have to have a new experience with God every single day if this great man Paul had to Die daily how much more than today that we need to die that we got a whole lot more junk in our lives today than Paul did he only had knives and swords and chop blockes you serve God get your head cut off you're in glory before the last drop of blood drips off of your body but today it's a mind battle that we have and this mind has to be cleaned it has to be Washed by the Water of the word it has to be so clean and squeaky clean so that Mighty God can come and speak to you softly to lead you and guide you to the promised land you need experiences with God every single day of Our Lives there's people out there do not read the Bible but they're looking at you because you confess of being a Christian you say that you sisters live of Godly character because the Bible says you should have long hair it's the glory for a woman to have long hair they can see long hair on a lot of women in Hollywood but their character is of this world okay but you have a responsibility brother William has a responsibility to be an open book to the people and the only open book that we need to give the people is this word right here and if we're not living this word then we're Hypocrites okay and so it's important to have that a personal relationship with God this great experience with God it's very important we can see here in the scriptures where John and Peter they had an experience but before they got this experience Peter cut a soldier's ear off he would he would fight for God boy let me I'll fight for you no he wanted you just to believe we don't need to fight the only person you need to fight is to go into the mirror and look at that man or that woman and fight that person by the word of God let Thy word flow into our minds and down into our heart to change you and I thinking that is the most important thing of a Believer has to do is to get your mind clean so the presence of God can come in there and have a personal relationship with you and me when we can overcome our own mind there's not a devil in hell there's not a demon in Hell that'll ever tempt you he can sit there and Bluff you and tell you this but you'll have the power to say get behind me Satan you can walk by somebody that's asking for arms asking for prayer you can stand there and say in the name of Jesus get up and walk and every devil has to flee and God's obligated to his word he says you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover if your mind is set on the word of God and the word of God has giving you an experience and you know that experience come from God and you know who you are in Christ Jesus you can speak to that mountain and that mountain has to go a true story about a a lady that had to go around the mountain to go to her doctor's appointment one day she spoke to God and said God I want a road right through the mountain so I can go right straight through it I believe you're going to do it month later comes up and here comes big tractors big dump trucks after five years there was a road that was made through the through the through that Canyon through that mountain God answered her prayer by one rock at a time one truck clo at a time it might take a while but it's you being steadfast in the word and you wait upon the Lord and God said he will renew your strength as Eagles but this personal relationship this personal experience with God will change your thinking it will change the absolute life in your life to good aren't we tired of struggling aren't we tired of being sick aren't you tired of just having mind battles aren't you tired of being old but if you have the joy of God in your life you won't worry about how old you are you're just getting closer to your destination you'd have joy unspeakable and full of Glory you'll be able to stand in the presence of God and say I've walked that walk I've talked that walk and God led me through it you elderly people have something for as younger people it is called a testimony the experiences that you got from God will help our young people out don't be afraid to talk to them love them and watch the salvation of God come through your lips down into somebody's ear and change their heart I've seen love take bitterness out of people complexes there's one young lady that years ago I ministered at a church that had devil just beating on her and beating on her she couldn't even look up but after a little while she already recognizing that the spirit of God was going to deliver her and she accepted it and the fear you can see come off of her face and gladness and today she's married and she's praising God and she has a husband and she loves him and she's happy why because a preacher cared the preacher's wife cared and a preacher's daughter cared and went up there and laid hands on her and prayed for her and she say she got Victory we got children up here sometimes at the altar crying out to God and you Mas and daddies just sit there in your seat Well I'm waiting on God to tell me to go up there that's your child why God when he sees you hurting he's there for you you should be laying hands on him and tell them I'm right here with you in your p in your trials I'm going to go with you you must get this thing cleaned up cuz your way of thinking is wrong you should be blessed to see your children come to the altar I remember the time when I came to the altar when I was a young man and my brother Dale come and crying saying oh God this day he's going to have trials that he he's going to need need you to help him with Lord because why they need a personal EXP experience with God the same God that you have an experience with cuz Peter and John knew who they were yeah that's why that lame guy wasn't no lame no more he was shouting and shouting the victory from birth how much more he'll do for you if you just believe Hallelujah but it comes by faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God here's this great Man Called Moses in the Bible he was taught at a little age that he was going to be the deliverer of Israel Israel was in 400 years of bondage and in this bondage these people believe that there was a a deliver that's coming after that first 100 years I guarantee you they had a lot of Egypt theology in their life they had a lot of dogmas in their life their thinking was a lot different than it was when when their grandpappy brought them their daddies across there in those tribes that came they saw the mighty hands of God and they saw things they saw what God did for them there in E day of Egypt when Joseph was standing there that he was right under the throne of pharaoh was able to speak in Pharaoh when that when he was not on the throne he had thus said Pharaoh in his life gave them the best part of the land he gave them everything they needed to be right there beside Joseph but because of the Harden of God putting down on the Egyptians started making test Masters starting to beat on them and get them to a place where they were scared of the Egyptians getting their minds off of God getting their minds into theology getting them their their minds on what they had to go do and build bricks they put a bondage into their minds and the only thing they knew in their mind was to get up in the morning and go put their feet in the mud and stomp mud all day long the values of that race was falling apart because now their their belief system was shot because of pharaoh because when they was trying to pray to God Pharaoh would kill them because they should have been worshiping him but here was a man that was raised up by his Hebrew Mama telling him you are the man that God has sent to this country to take Israel out but see he had too much of pharaoh knowledge in his mind he had had the Theology of of being a the man of the hour one day so he says well I'm going to use my power to deliver my people I'll be Pharaoh one day and I will deliver them but see he jumped the jumped it because now he's starting to see these task Masters beat his family and he kept seeing it and before long the the the thrive in their mom in his heart wanted to kill that Egyptian the one that he had power over to say stop go find something else to beat on that tree over there but instant he killed that Egyptian and when that Egyptian blood fell of the ground now fear come on his arm when fear comes upon a Believer or or a man or a woman it will take you from the presence of God immediately because now you're going into to reasoning now you're going into a place where now you're in the darkness of it and now you're listening to something else instead of God and that is what happens to a Believer when the Satan comes in and tries to make you think that you're so sick you can't go to church I would rather come to church and fall asleep in church but be here and say Pastor I'm taking these drugs it makes me sleepy I don't know what's going to happen but if you see me asleep just walk up there and pray for me cuz I need it that's why I'm here this is a house of a h it could be a hotel it could be a House of Prayer it could pay all kinds of things but this is a house of a hospital house for the sick we could be sick physically we can be sick in the mind we could be sick in the heart but we come to church to have an experience with who God I understand you have fevers and you have these things but when we start listening to Satan and you start thinking of your symptoms he's already got you child of God I'm not saying that you're not a child of God I'm not saying that you don't have the Holy Ghost I'm saying now your mind is blocked off and you don't have the opportunity to have it flowing with God now it's has thoughts in your mind saying yeah they're going to be t talking about you cuz you miss church because you have a headache and we know brother wle comes to church with a massive headache yeah and it's nobody in the church that's saying it it's Satan putting it in you and now you believe somebody in the church is against you and now you're getting to a place now complexes start happening and now you don't want to be around nobody and now you search yourself away in a corner somewhere and say it's just me and God now no it's not you and God it's you and the devil in that corner because God standing at the pulpit waiting for you to come in and deliver you from those things we got to get to a place that this is not controlling you but your heart is being controlled by Jesus right but so so here he was he was standing there he runs off in the wilderness and Moses for 40 years learned everything to be a pharaoh now he's in 40 years in the desert and in that desert now he's a sheep hurder in the desert he lives on rocks his shoes wear out he doesn't have good perfume anymore and take showers he has to just go out in in a tub somewh and wash off and then he falls in love with this woman that argues with him constantly he's a man of the house but he's not because when he says something she does the opposite because she's got too much man theology in her so he had has to deal with that he has to deal with a B but after about 40 years now he's just can't even talk Egyptian he can't even do it he doesn't even have a burden for his people anymore he forgot his calling he forgot everything except only thing he knows now is to say yes ma'am to his wife and put the clothes that he tells him to put on and he goes out there and he leads sheep all right but one day he's looking up and he sees this bush burning and he's wondering why is this bush still burning and not burning up something on the inside is saying this is this is weird I got to see this thing but you can't go up on that mountain but it enticed him so much that he had to go see what this thing was all about there's a burning bush here in the church it's here every day it just wants to speak to you we're just got to be here so there he is he walks up to this mountain day and he sees this Burning Bush and when he gets up to it it's the weirdest burn that he's ever seen in his life and all of a sudden it speaks to him says take off thy shoes you're on Holy Ground immediately he takes his shoes off cuz he's scared and he looks at him and says I have a work for you to do Moses a work for me to do who are you he I got to work for you Moses you see that Shepherd stick in your hand you're going to go down to Egypt and you're going to be a deliverer you're going to be a oneman Invasion a oneman army with that Crooked Stick and you're going to go down there in front of pharaoh and you're going to look at him in the eye and you're not going to be afraid of him you're going to tell him to let my people go and if he doesn't do it after so many times I'm going to throw plagues upon him one after the other and I'm going to harden his heart and I'm going to soften his heart but one day I'm going to soften his heart up so much that he's going to hurt for his his Disobedience oh I can't do that I can't even speak their language I stutter I stutter I can't do this Peter I mean Moses puts your hand under your cloak he sticks it in there pull it back out and it's leprosy and he goes Moses put it back in and he sticks it back in he says Moses bring it back out and it was just like it was before the leopard what was God doing to him he was building character in his faith so that he could believe in that burning bush so that he would be what he was he had to be reminded who he was he let all the complexes all the experien that he had when he was a little boy go right out the window he could say oh I had that experience with my mama she told me I was a deliverer what happened I ran like crazy out of Egypt cuz I killed an Egyptian he was a coward but he was a deliver her so he he shows him some signs and he said now you're going to go and your brother Aaron's going to meet you halfway and you guys are going to go and you're going to be a god of those people and Aaron's going to be your prophet and you're going to go down there there and you're going to speak and Aaron's going to do what you tell him to do and you are going to March out with 2,000 of my people out of Egypt but he had to be a personal experience with God God Almighty before he could stand there with that stick and say I'm Moses and I'm going to down there and tell FK Egyptians how to eat and how to do this and when he was going down there he went down there he had the charge and he went down there and he was the only one that can walk up to pharaoh and say Pharaoh let my people go and if you've done I'm going to give you a whole bunch of frogs now it's changed from pharaoh to God now God is going to put the task Mas upon Him devil is your Taskmaster today and if you're letting your mind take over your heart then he's going to beat you and he's going to beat you and he's going to beat you but if you can stand there on the Promises of God and recognize who you are this morning and the only way you're going to acknowledge who you are is get in the Bible and see what God has done for you why did he redeem you because he wanted you to be a son and daughter of God he wanted the power of himself living in you to do the Greater Works God needs man to speak his word through we need a God to live through us yeah so you want these task Masters to leave you alone go find that that backside of the desert experience and find God and that experience needs to grow every day stronger and stronger and stronger while you're doing more of God than you're doing anything else and you watch God fight your battles we need a check up on our lives well I'm doing just fine Brother William what about you you're struggling you don't have no work yeah you're right I don't have no work so I'm taking all my time my spare time and I'm listening to tapes I'm praying I'm seeking God for you I'm seeking God for my salvation I'm seeking everything a possibility because he's in in control and because he's in control of my life I don't worry check's been flowing in getting a little bit of work from a brother another one just offered to have me help him for a few days what is it the body taking care of the toe and it's an ugly toe but praise God I'm a part of the toe but see I had an experience with him long time ago and I built on that Foundation of Christ Jesus and I'm building a house because one of these days this this soul is going to go out of this house into a glorified body house it's not going to be sinful no more it's not going to ache and pains anymore it's going to be just like him that's same Jesus that rose from the dead that same body that he was standing there walking down the the road to Damascus and talking to the two two Hebrew men talking about himself telling them about it and then when he goes inside they they they asked him please come in come in come and eat supper with us he goes in and when he breaks the bread he opens her eyes and he there he is he's Rising again what would that do to us if he walk into this room this morning physically nothing because he doesn't come in that for me no more he will come back but we're going to meet him in the air now he comes in the spirit realm called the Holy Ghost and if we can just die out to our own selves let this mind be washed by the word of God and hear what the word of God says and do the holy spirit will fall upon you and it will change your life life it will be your earnest of your adoption and when you get that full adoption in God your body's changed in a moment in a twinkle of an eye but this experience has to be something from God as a relationship back and forth we can sit there and read this Bible and know exactly what it says but you haven't have to have an experience erence with that in your life something has to happen in your life so that you can have faith to believe but if you're just going to sit there and look at me like a mule at a gate it's not going to help you until you clean this out because when you clean this out it doesn't matter who's standing here you're going to say that's nothing but the truth because I've been reading in the Bible I've been reading the message I've been listening to the tapes I've been listening to my pastor and everything you're saying lines up exactly what the scriptures father help me to get closer to you oh God and things will change in your life you won't be bitter to pour towards of anybody a lot of times we get complexes against ourselves and we don't even know it so we keep apologizing to everybody we think has has offended and you haven't offended nobody it's Satan just has you bound now notice when they came out of Egypt God gave them gold silver everything all is their cattles they had their bread they had everything they had and much more but when they came across the Red Sea something changed when they got across on the other side the bread gave out God always provides way that night when they went to bed I can see the prophet go out and pray the next morning when they woke up they looked all around over the ground and they were Mana laying all over the ground like frost it tasted like honey and wafer they went out and began to pick it up and eat it oh it was wonderful Mana very beautiful type of our Mana today the whole Wilderness Journey was we can type our life just like them we needed to deliver we needed somebody to show up and tell us how to get back to the original Pentecost not a church Pentecost but the original Pentecost this right here we needed to know who was going to deliver us we need to know that experience in that God that died on Calvary to save yours and my soul that same God's Not only saving your soul he's coming and wants to live in inside of you so if you give him the premium of your life he will clean you up from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head you won't stink you won't have no doubt you'll have complete faith in your life if you let God control your life your money finances if you let God control your finances he'll make every Bill stretch out I mean every bit of your money stretch out and pay bills well he doesn't do it for me well maybe you need to look in the mirror and see where you're at well I had I had the Holy Ghost 40 years ago yeah brother BR says every experience will die if you don't add more to it don't matter how many times you tell me of the scriptures doesn't tell me how much you read your Bible I want to want to see a life and you guys have the opportunity to look back back to me and say brother William I want to see your life you're going to sit up there and preach let me see your life let me see you dedicated to your God that you're preaching on this morning come over to my house go down the road with me let's see what I got in my house I got a big couch and two big old chairs and three dogs and a beautiful wife that's what I got my entertainment is watching them dogs fight with each other over a bone unless my son-in-law comes over and then he entertains me the things he laughs about I laugh because of him but you know what I need him there's a lot of times that I've been down in the dumps and he shows up says you got to listen to this and it's the stupidest thing but I'm watching him and I laugh my guts out and before he leaves I feel better I'm not thinking about my nonsense I'm not thinking about work I'm not thinking about anything but then brother Michael will show up you go oh no what he want and we'll sit there at the lunchtime in my my house and sit there and eat he'll eat his sandwich and his wife fix him and I'll eat whatever I fix or Sharon fix fixes with fixes and I'm sitting there we're talking about the Lord what is it communion around what we believe I'm getting strength from him that guy that was laying there for arms he needed strength he needed somebody to come that would change his life that man was a burden to those people they they had to pick him up and carry him and put him right there and every man and woman that come through there to go pray had to see that guy begging and they couldn't do nothing for him so I throw a little bit of change in there but that change didn't make him strength in his legs all the food that he ate didn't strengthen his legs but what strengthened his legs was a man two men that had God living inside of them that they knew who they was said get up and walk in the name of Jesus from Nazareth and reached down there with his right hand and picked him up and strength immediately came into that Man's legs and today we have seen God in this church take cancer out of sister Angie we we prayed for my wife that had a big tumor that was bigger than a football and said Lord if you got to take that out let it not be cancerous went through surgery I was a maniac through the whole thing and Sister Amy was my buddy she knew it she was praying for me brother W was there he was praying for me they knew I was I couldn't sit still I was back and forth back and forth grabbing I drank so much that day but I was worried about my little girl my little wife that I love dearly I couldn't do anything except pray and and worry about her but God came down took that thing out of there and today she didn't have cancer it was just something that was on one of her body parts that just need to be taken away and God healed her and today she doesn't have no problem Amen brother Mama that had cancer her blood type was going down because of the count we kept praying and kept praying she kept listening to the word she kept listening to the word and months went by weeks went by days went by and God come on the scene and the doctors were completely blown away sister Betty has problems with her legs they would swell up and water would burst out of her legs she kept trusting in God trusting in God God made these doctors go in the ways that help her out and today an 80 something yard woman Christian lady setting in the church service today what is it a personal experience with God cuz without Faith it's impossible to please him you want God to move on your half speak I'm already been healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed we see we know we we always use her but sister Stephanie a complete drug addict from 13 years old until 5 years six years years ago was going to have to have a kidney or not a kidney but a liver transplant she was going to die without it but this young lady woke up one day and says I need God and she had an experience with him and God made that same one that she has in her brand new so I can identify from this lame man seeing it there Hall there there what about a mind battle brother Joe drugged up listening to all kinds of trash demons was beaten up on him tormenting him couldn't go to sleep at night but one day he woke up and says I'm going back to church and I don't care if they don't love me I don't care if they do this or that but I'm going to go hear the word of God and he come and brother William worked him and I was telling him about God and I just kept telling him about God I kept praying for him I kept praying for him the church started praying for because now you're starting to see a man come in every service and every service and you see him not having a vehicle but all of a sudden he shows up and then before long he had the money and he got him a vehicle and he started coming and God just blessed him and blessed him and blessed him and blessed him and today he's a set man totally delivered from those demons no desire whatsoever to go back into the world and smoke dough and do drugs and today a testimony to his children the one that's in jail wants to move here as soon as she gets out in about nine months because she sees him talking to her talking about God not talking about his problems talking about this but he's had an experience with God why are we struggling Church why are we struggling in our own minds what are you putting in to your minds this morning we see here David David was a young little Rudy boy taking care of his daddy's sheep one day his dad said son I want you to go to the the line of the fighting line and take this bread and this cheese and and go check on your brothers and see how they're doing tell them that I love them tell them that we're praying for them we're telling them we're with you on this and he goes and why this little fella about 16 years old he had an experience with god with those sheep one day a lion come and took a sheep and he took his his little slingshot that he had on the side of his thing and he reached to there and grabbed a smooth Rock and he flipped that thing and he killed a lion another day a bear come and stole another one and he killed the bear he knew that God Almighty was on his side you throw you go out there right now with a slingshot and go hit a bear right now between the eyeballs and watch him eat you up we have a testimony a man shoot a Grizzly 400 yards away and that thing came all the way up to about 20 feet of him before he dropped and that's a bullet it has to be God watching over his children when you're in the totally complete word of God and you are totally there God's obligated to take care of you he's obligated to take care of you but when we let this mind tell us we're too sick we're too this and we're too this and nobody loves me and this and that and all my children is going crazy and all this no sir it's time to create your own world and say Satan you're a liar and my children are just fine my husband is just fine because I'm applying the blood to their life and God is obligated to move upon that situation but we got to get this cleaned out so here was David going to go see his brothers going to see my big brothers I was always happy to go see my big brothers unless they picked on me and I always wondered way how I was going to beat him up one day when I got bigger well the size shows how but he gets there and all of a sudden he hears this boasting bully called Goliath cursing defiling the armies of God that has been promised by a prophet that every battle is yours if you believe every situation trial that you go through if you will trust him he's obligated to take care of you through that trial and he's standing there watching all these people he's looking at the king over there sitting in his boots shaking and his brothers are sitting there saying hey hey sh hush man that guy's huge he's a big old man he's seven foot tall eight foot tall hands about foot long his Spears his knife is probably about six foot long fingers are about this long he's a big man keep your mouth shut we don't want him to know where we're at but see there was something on the inside that he had an experience with God he was with God he played the instruments he sung songs he he worshiped God he seen the evidence of the God that he served there when he needed him and he looked around and says I'll go fight this Philistine this uncircumcised devil he wasn't afraid because he knew who he was in that little teeny body that he was in oh you need to hush your face all right he ain't going to shut let's take him to the king king you need put some sense into my little brother's head he thinks he can go out like that and go out there and kill that Philistine that King admired that young man's Faith but after a while that boy started looking in his eyes and says let me go out there I'll kill him finally he said okay fine you know what nobody else is going to do it I'm the biggest guy here but I ain't going to go do it cuz I'm a I'm a because he lost his first love he let his Theology of being a king do a sacrifice that he shouldn't have been doing sometimes we do sacrifices for God that we shouldn't be doing and and using it is the name of the Lord well Pastor said this but you know he's that's his opinion you know our our pastor has the authority under the Holy Ghost to run this church the way he wants to run it I just found a quote the other day so we better watch what we say about our our pastor I had to repent and so here we are he goes well then you're going to have to have this the sword you're going to have to have this and he's putting this stuff on and it's now it's a burden to him cuz he's never proved this stuff this theology is not for him he threw that theology off and says listen I don't know about that stuff but I do know this that I killed a bear one day with a power of God on me and I killed a lion with this slingshot you just give me 15 minutes I'm going to go down to this Brook and I'm going to put five stones in it and I'm going to put it in this little pouch I got here with a little bit of honey and I'm going to go out there I'm going to kill that Philistine for God that little boy went to the brook got him some Stones put them in his pocket and he went out there and says I'm going to take your head off just imagine you standing up and say brother William I'm going to knock you down I going to look at you like well try it but when you try I'm going to grab a hold T and I'm going to set on you but if that little guy believed who he was God would be obligated to take care of his battle he didn't say the whole armies of of Israel he said Israel have faith you do what I tell you and you'll win your battles and that little man went out there and I call him a little man and that Philistine come and here he goes he say all right Lord sling slot's a sling slot but you are the god of my my forefathers and I believe in you right squared down the middle of his eyes he runs over there didn't sit there and go well no he runs over there grabs the enemy sword and cuts his head off with it yeah all the stuff he does to you need to turn around and grab that sword and cut the devil's head off this see this morning it's your Victory get an experience with God this morning and God will fight your battles for you You' got cancer he'll take it away from you because he's looking for Faith this morning he's looking for faith in the hearts of his people hallelujah why because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's an unchanging God he's not going to say what this church over here says and this church over here says and this church over here says he's going to say I said the word says and that's where he's going to judge us he's not going to judge us by the Baptist Church he's not going to judge us by the Presbyterian he's not going to judge us by Catholics and he's not going to judge us off the White House either he's going to judge us by this word right here that proth out of the mouth of God eternal life and so now he's there and when he cuts that devil's head off the faith rose up into those men and now they have a new king his name was David because now they saw somebody that had the power of God living inside of him and they followed and they killed those Philistines now he wasn't the king at that moment but he was already promised by God that he was going to be the king but he had to go through trials he had to be proven just like you and I have to be proven to be Sons and Daughters of God and sometimes you got to prove to me and I've got to prove to you that we're Sons and Daughters of God oh praise be to God that was little David First Corinthians 2 and 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but the demonstration of the spirit of the power your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God that's where your experience lies in the power of God hallelujah we see here I like to read this can I have a few more minutes oh I haven't preached very long at all hallelujah usually about this time it's already been an hour now here it says he goes just remember me brother I got a whole lot of script in the bag David had Honey in the Rock and when David would be out there with his sheep and they were sick he would go and find Limestone and he would get a little bit of that honey for himself and he' get a little bit of that honey and he put it on that Lim Stone and he'd get it up there to that little sheep and that little sheep would start licking it and what it's doing he's trying to to get that that sweet honey off but what's happening is some of that limestone's going down into that that little belly of his and it heals them I believe this morning as our prophet of God says I'm going to put the honey Upon Jesus this morning the solid rock yeah and you guys just start licking on that word of God and if you got something in your body that needs to be touched you keep on licking and God will touch you that's what the prophet of God say he said I got that little strip bag and I've got a little bit of honey for you start licking this start reading this it'll change your life yeah it ain't big flowery words it's not theology that's going to save you it's the simple things that's going to save you that's the word it's not difficult he says if you believe in my name every devil will flee he says if you repent I'll be there you ask him for forgiveness he said he'll forgive you he says if you need a need you come to me you heavy laden and I will give you rest sometimes we have to go through the things we got to go through but about a month or two maybe a year down the road all of a sudden that faith will arise up in you it's just like that little black man one day he was he was blind he couldn't see but he came up to the prayer line and that preacher prayed for him and he says you're healed in the name of the Lord Jesus he went home he told everybody was healed people says you're still blind he goes I'm Healed in the name of the Lord Jesus one day he goes go get a haircut and that old Barber was starting to make fun of him he goes I thought you said that you're healed I'm Healed in the name of Jesus and about that time his eyes opened he jumps up and he takes off running down the street he says I can see I can see I can see what is it confession speaking the word back to Satan and everyone else confession bringing it to the people showing that you believe you had a personal experience with God those that come to the Altar and leave their burdens and get up and pick their burdens back up and leave they didn't have an experience with God that's why men and women having so much TR time and stuff in these mess message today is because they see people get up and walk out get up and walk out because the preaching and the pulpit is telling they don't have to have signs and wonders no more they just need to believe well if you believe then the works that you do is going to prove that you believe you're going to be healed because you believe he's still a Healer today there's churches out there that don't believe that Jesus can heal you today well I'm standing here telling them there are l fire he's healed me in many different ways and you guys have a testimony also but it's had honey just start eating this book as Revelation says eat the book what it's going to do it's going to change your thinking it'll change your belief it'll give you power it'll give you the faith to believe CU why that person personal experience with God you guys are struggling to get the Holy Ghost quit struggling quit struggling it's not up here beating and beating and beating and beating get into the word and find yourself in let me ask you one question young people who on this front row sides the one that's asleep bless her little heart do you believe in Jesus Christ as your personal savior that same belief will give you the Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that saved you can fill you you just have to believe right that's all that feeling that you get you know that's that God just place it right here say I believe it and walk away I believe it don't let the devil take your blessing from you sister Angie God has proven over and over that he loves you don't let that devil beat on you no more brother Mitch I know you don't understand why you're going through the things you are but he's making a diamond out of you praise him for it I know some of you been battling sicknesses and battling heart problems battling these things and and and it's just wearing you down but as a little young man I want to tell you today press on sister press on my brother press on Young People Press on this race is just about out over anybody that has read the Bible can see this world is lining straight up with the what the Revelation says you don't even have to have a prophet to just read the Bible and just see the corruption that's going on but the Prophet come to bring us to a place to understand what Satan is doing at this hour he's trying to choke you to death and when you realize who you are then you can put your hand out like this and say back off devil because this fist turns into mighty God's hands and he'll knock you out why because you had this relationship this personal experience with God through the word of God it changes you in a moment and a twink of an eye I used to sit there wonder why I do go through this and why I go through that but one day I got behind a backside of the desert experience and I've never been a different change I was a changed man from that point on when I go down in the dumps the first thing I do is I push play and if I don't have a message I push some good gospel singers and I let them sing this sign on songs and I sit there and I enter in into worship and all of a sudden all the things that I go through is passed off and now I'm thinking of God I'm thinking about his promises I'm starting now I've got my mind cleared up and now he can come down and speak to me and say just speak my son speak my daughter and what you speak I'll give it to you I want these mind battles to stop lord walk away from it's done how will my children be make it Lord walk away and believe and watch him come in what is it a relationship with God Almighty himself knowing who God is is the greatest mystery of this world do you know that because they're looking at three Gods up there father Son and the Holy Ghost those three the Bible says are one you see brother William you know I'm a son I wouldn't be here and I'm a daddy that's not my name to Brianna she can call me daddy my daddy can call me son but one of these days I'll be a grandpa and my grandbaby will call me Grandpa well he call me something else but my name is William so that Holy Ghost that son and that father is God he had come down in a body to save his mankind he's the one that let sin come in the world so that he could be the Healer he's the one that let these things happen so that he can love you through your trials he's the master he's the one that chose you guys every one of you before the foundations of the world to be a Sons and Daughters of God some of us are sitting here and says man I wish my dad would brag about me like God brags about me see they're not God but God brags I got a quote where he brother Braham says that he likes testimonies so he'll let you go through a trial so that he can have a testimony through you so if you re recognize that then glorifying God through your trials because now you're going to be a testimony for God through your trial through your pain we got people in this world today and I'm almost getting ready to close I'm not going to finish didn't go the way I thought it was good there's people out there that has cancer right now that don't believe in God whatsoever and they have a peace in their heart where are they getting that peace from that peace comes from God but Satan has tapped into this world he can't create but he perverts and those people that's out there without Jesus Christ and they're getting ready to die and they don't give their heart to God they're going to die and go to hail but how can they have that peace and walking into their destruction is because the devil has pulled the wool over their eyes the world says today everyone's going to heaven because Jesus loves everybody that's a lie that man is a liar that woman is a liar my Bible says before es uh before Jacob and and uh Esau was born he loved Jacob he hated Esau saw because he knew he was going to sell his Birthright are we going to sell our Birthright to this world are we going to claim our Birthright and go to heaven okay are we going to be so stubborn and walk away from today and not get your inheritance that God has given you eternal life forever more or walk away today and accept life as it is and think you're just just fine and go out these doors and die one day and miss the Rapture uh-uh I've been in the world I dranked I smoked dope I partied I was 13 years old in bars playing pool with the big boys I did it all I'll never change what I got today for that trash that world out there will tear you up God has provided for 34 years for this boy the first 20 was tormented about this world but today I have this experience in my my heart that's burning yes burning for the kingdom of heaven and I want to know him more today than I did yesterday I want a greater experience this afternoon than I did this morning I want to know who I am more now than I did yesterday church this morning Mark 11 and 20 says and in the morning as they pass by they saw the Fig Tree die dry up from the roots Peter calling to remembrance said to him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is withered away and Jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say in this mountain be removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he ha said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe and he receive them and he shall have them praise be to God one of the greatest books in the Bible my opinion is Hebrews Hebrews 11 and 6 says but without faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him go look what diligent means to give you a little bit of an that's your guys's homework this morning go find out what it means it'll wake you up by faith Abel by faith Enoch but without faith it's impossible but by faith no by Abraham these men had faith in God but it's just a book then let it come alive just believe watch out watch God show you he's real I know he's real I had a cousin at the hospital back in New Mexico there was dying coma he was out his mama wanted me to come up and pray for him I got up there and nervous as a wreck and the only thing I said I said Lord if this young man can hear me right now I said Lord let him hear my voice I said Lord if he ain't coming out of this and he can hear my voice then young man give your heart to God now but Lord if you let this boy rais up from the dead or raised up from this bed today let him be a testimony to you this was at 9:00 on a Friday afternoon 2:00 morning Saturday morning he wakes up out of bed two days later they were sitting there with a bunch of friends and they were hooting and hatting he goes oh hey uh-uh he goes I don't want to hear that trash anymore they looked at and said what he goes I'm going to serve God I Heard a Voice when I was out and he goes when I find that voice I'm going to see that man that prayed for me this was the first of November when I prayed for him one month well it's halfway in the month Christmas day I go to his grandpa's house to tell him Merry Christmas and get a little bit of his cheese that he makes I'm sitting in the living room they drive up they come through the front door and the boy stands in there and hears my voice and says mama mama that's the man that prayed for me there was a wall between us for one month that young man on Day of Christmas has been testifying to his people his friends that are wacko skateboarders tattooed to the max drug addicts the whole nine yards told them stop talking to me if you're not going to talk about good things one of his friends says you going to be a preacher he goes I'll do whatever God wants me to be but I'm going to tell you this I'm going to testify to him until the day I die every one of his friends are going to be judged for what he just did for one month Christmas evening Eve car accident killed him dead God let that young man come back to life to be a testimony for him so don't tell me that God doesn't raise people up cuz I'm a witness to it so if God can do that to a sinner what can he do to you that believe in God this morning you got needs this morning you believe and God will give them to you he's obligated if you're willing to give he'll give you eternal life right here this morning you need something from God this morning he'll give it to you don't just sit in your seat saying okay well praise the Lord you stand up and you believe you worship God this morning you while that man is sitting there playing that piano and he's singing Zion songs this morning and those things instruments are going you worship him and give him the glory and God is obligated to take care of you that's thus saith the Lord by what the prophet of God said and what that Bible says because today there's salvation amen today there's healing today if you have a doubt why don't you come up and let me pray with you let me just talk with you for a moment watch God come on the scene and bless you this morning but don't just sit there and thinking I'm just fine cuz not one of you that left your house this morning's fine because today you got to have a new experience yesterday experience is
