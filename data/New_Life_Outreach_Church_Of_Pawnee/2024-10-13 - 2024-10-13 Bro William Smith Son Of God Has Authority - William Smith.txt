Overcomer I'm an overcomer by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony Overcomer I'm an overcomer by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony he saved me he rescued me he delivered me he set me free ever since I've Been Changed oh I've never been the same it's why I can lift my head and say thank you for your grace Overcomer how many Overcomers do we have tonight by the blood of the Lamb by the blood of the lamb and by the the word of my testimony Overcomer I'm in Overcomer by the blood of the Lamb by the word of my testimony Overcomer more than a conqueror I'm a win the joy of the Lord is my strength I have dominion I walk in authority I've been washed in the blood kept by his love I'm filled with the spirit by his stripes I'm Healed I'm free oh Jesus gave me the victory Overcomer I'm an overcomer by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my [Music] testimony of the [Music] L Hallelujah you love him praise the Lord we are more than Overcomers you know I remember when I was a boy and and uh my dad would help me and we would be flipping cows over and or kevs and I'd get one that was pretty good size six-month old kef and man I'd do everything I could to lift him up I'd get his legs all spread but two legs would stay on the ground and I'd be still pulling up and and Dad he'd just walk up there and and uh kick that front leg and I'd flip it over and man I felt like I was to Cowboy him up but you know when I found out that his little kick was the one that that helped me get it I was so thankful cuz he never took the glory from me he always said this is my cowboy and uh Jesus does the same thing to you and I he knew that we couldn't make this he knew that when we were born in this sinful World there was no hope for us so our daddy come and he died for you and I so that he can send himself back in the spirit down into that soul that he predestinated to give you life to give you encouragement to give you that power to be Overcomers I thank him for that amen if we can open our Bibles this evening like to read two places in Acts one and acts two sorry sister CA I forgot to uh I'm the faithful one always send them to you and I forgot but acts two I got one scripture there I mean acts one one scripture and then acts two and we're going to start here with acts one first we're going to read this one scripture the eth verse but he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and he shall be Witnesses and to me both in Jerusalem and to J uh Judah and Samaria and to the other parts of the earth I thank God for that because I'm in that other part of the earth here in the second chapter we like to start at the 37th verse Acts 2:37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this unw generation then they that gladly received the word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls and they continued steadfast in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in the breaking of bread and praying and fear came up fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles let's pray Heavenly Father we just love you Lord I always get nervous Lord when I get up here and Lord we just ask you father God to help me I pray Lord that you bless your children father God we got many that are not feeling well we ask you Lord to be with them and Lord we just ask you Lord to to be in this service Lord we thank you for the songs Lord we're so thankful that you have given us an opportunity to be Overcomers in this day and Lord we just ask you to help me with this little thought and Lord I pray you bless each and every heart those that are listening in Lord I pray that you bless them we thank you for all you do for us in Jesus name amen you may be seated I would like to minister just a little thought here sons of God has Authority but to have authority you have to be an overcomer and so your soul is the only thing that God's coming back for he's not coming back for your mind he's not coming back for your flesh because we were born in the shape of iniquity of speaking lies in a in a a marriage from a man and woman being born in this world we've got the worldly flesh our mind is perverted because of the things of this world has put out there so that you and I can grow as a little boy to a per to a man if you haven't had God in a young age you're going to get more trash of this world laying inside of your mind and what's so sad is even after you're born again and you got the spirit of God if you're not careful you'll still get the things of this world in your mind that's the hardest place to get things out of our mind is the things of the world and not only getting the things of the world out of your mind but doubt doubt is one of the greatest things that that hinders you and I is doubt because a lots of times we don't doubt somebody else but we doubt ourselves and we look in the mirror and we say we're no good for this we're not this and this and that it doesn't matter what you think it's what the word says what he thinks about you and that's why you got to stay in the word of God to make sure that he's the one that's kicking that foot out for you so you can flip that cow over every every burden that you've got we've got to let God have his control into it but there is a control that you and I have to have so that God can control the situations because this flesh is sticky Paul says I Die daily it's not because he sinned every day it's because he's getting his mind mind cleaned he's getting his flesh out of the way so that he can have fellowship with the word so that he can be able to be a witness as Paul was a I mean Peter was a witness after he got pervert after he got saved but when he was not saved he wanted to cut people's ears off he wanted to protect Jesus he wanted to do this and do that he even lied and he cursed but see today it's so wicked for our little ones here the other day I was waiting for Sharon and and so I'm sitting there in this this this this building and and this man and this woman was sitting there with her little boy and this little boy was doing something and his daddy says son get over here and the little boy cursed him and he thought it was funny they were laughing about it the worldly things in this world is going to go into that boy mind that he's got a in his mind he will be able to say Daddy no and he's just going to laugh at him that boy's going to grow up one of these days and tell everybody no he's going to be a rotten no good kid he's going to be full of the devil and it wasn't even his fault that's why it's important for us parents to make sure our children is raised in The Godly atmosphere because you're the ones going to be judged for what your children are doing and so I look at it here God's coming back for the Soul Your Soul has to have all control of your mind and body all right and the way that we even ever get to a place is there's something on the inside deep my brother always said this to me when I was a young boy he said when I didn't want to do something he brother William he goes you're going to have to reach way down deep inside and get after it and that's the truth if we're going to call ourselves Christians then we've got to reach way down deep inside and let this soul that has been redeemed if you really believe that you re redeemed I wonder sometimes are we we hear the preacher talk about Redemption we hear the preacher talk about salvation we hear all these great things and we get so caught up all the time saying Amen brother amen oh it gets the preacher going it gets everybody else going but is it going through one ear and out the other going through this ear and out this way you've got to have that whatever comes across this Pulpit if it's the word you've got to let that word drop down into that soul that God prepared so that Soul can have authority it cannot have authority if it's just in the mind or in this flesh right brother B says you can have the Holy Ghost every day and still go to hell what is he talking about the Holy Ghost can tackle you and touch your body and make you feel good he wants to put you a good pattern once in a while on the back but you got to have him living inside of you he has to have the complete control in your life if he doesn't have the complete control in your life you are going to suffer as Christians you're up and down you're up and down you're up and down is because it's a head knowledge it ain't a soul Revelation it has to come into the soul that Soul had to be prepared for you to receive word we had to come down to an altar it might have been in a car it might have been at a job site it might have been in church but you have to repent repenting is giving up your Authority and letting God come in to wash you clean because when you get up in justification it doesn't mean that you're peer clean now he starts working on the inside he's got the Mind thinking now you got a thought saying hey I'm a sinner I need to be saved he saved you he's got you in his hands but now he's got to wash you by the word and if you're not picking up your Bible and if you're not reading the message of the hour how is he going to help you to get clean how is he going to help you to have faith he gave you enough Faith to get off your seat to come and repent because you had to reach down deep in died sometime this this is a Warfare not between you and the Satan if you can recognize who you are today the Bible says the prophet of God says the devil has to listen to you because real Authority comes from who God and if he's living inside of you then every devil has to listen to you we're fighting the devil way too much we need to stop right here and look in the mirror and say this man needs a good whooping by myself and that is getting down on my knees and crying out to God and asking him the right way to get this body get this mind clean and Washed by the Water of the word hallelujah so I can sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the definition of authority because listen we have a fight this Soul has to fight every inch he gets because this is thing sticky and because this thing is sticky then the Devil comes by and throws stuff on it to make it more stickier so you're not only fighting yourself you are fighting against Satan but if you don't have something that can back you up you're lost you're not going to make it and so here is definition here of authority is a power or right to do something given by a higher Authority in the New Testament that giving Authority is linked to the precious Holy Ghost the Bible says that people have been given Authority in Christ to Aventure in God's kingdom heal the sick defeat Satan and the power of Darkness Romans 13 And1 it says let every soul be subject into the higher pow for there is no power but of god the powers that be our he says excuse me the powers that be our our scar I need new glasses don't I okay the powers that be our our our we're having Sunday school lesson here just morning this afternoon ordained of God whosoever therefore resist the power resist the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation I don't want that to be me who wants that to be you I want to be so close to God that he has fellowship with me at any time if he whispers to me I'll say yes Lord Here I Am Lord yes what you need Lord yes I don't want it to just be me saying Lord I need this I need that but no I need the Lord once in a while to come down and say hey son I got your back but he can't and we're so bogged up with the things of this world man let me tell you something this thing right here I was preached on this morning if you heard me I said preach on brother I need it yes I'm guilty too he even said he was guilty we need to make a pack as brothers and sisters to back ourselves up and start invting people over and having Fellowship one another instead of having this into dinner table and playing this we should be fellowshipping with your family we got to sharpen our own swords we don't have to we can sharpen together we can talk talk about the things of God and Bible says that two or three gathered in my name I'll be in the midst it's not just church it's at home it's at the park it's in the truck it's wherever you could be start talking about God and he'll come down and he will cleanse you and wash your minds and give you the power to be Overcomers all right but this Authority it's important we hear it all the time we shout hallelujah we got Authority and we walk out and we're defeated because Satan knows if you are a true Son of God he knows because then when he knows he's not looking at you he's looking it something that's in you and that's the glory of God through the holy ghost that great power that fire that is built in now it's in you it's not some Pillar of Fire that's leading you out there but it's in you leading you through what he wants to accomplish in your life Hallelujah and so now he he's talking here and he goes right in your heart remember Christ savior remember he dies for you and if you'll just die to yourself that'll empty your body empty your soul empty your heart and everything of this world and all of its Pleasures then Christ you'll raise with him if you haven't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there's the pool it's not full but we can fill it up when you raise up he goes when you raise up out of the water you are raised to walk with Christ in a new life a new life if you and I really recognize what he did on Calvary for you and I it's not going to be a head knowledge it's going to be a revelation from God to the soul and this Soul when it gets Revelation it has power it will be Overcomer of this in the mind and when you have battles in the mind you should be able to say Satan get behind me and he has to flee my Bible says so but we let circumstances we let things of this world overwhelm us until we forget who we are brother R says we forget who we are he'll bless us and we bless and he'll bless us we see Miracles we see Miracles but then all of a sudden when it comes to your time you forget who you are if we're in the word if we're in the book we won't forget who we are because this is us he's already did his part now it's our part to receive the book by eating the book and becoming M Jesus Christ as a body of Believers individuales were Sons and Daughters of God when we got twoo much pride to be able to call a brother up and say brother I am hurting I need your prayer sisters don't have that kind of thing as men we are so bold and man we're we're better than anybody we walk around I don't need nobody it's just me and God I'll take care of this I'm all right no you're not you're a miserable wreck but if we can get to a place and deny this flesh and say no more you're not going to have even um power over me no more because I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to listen to tapes and I'm going to eat the book and I'm going to digest it and it's going down into my soul and it's going to wash me and it's going to cleanse me and it's going to give me the authority to come back at your face and tell you get out of my head get out of my heart get out of my back get out of my feet because there's something in a real believer if you don't know one get in the book you'll find men that had to go in the same church as as you did the first one and had to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they lived God so much because they didn't leave it here they brought it here and that predestined ated Soul started working and when they put their hands on somebody they were sick and a dog before he let the hands up they were healed silver and gold I don't have but what I do have I give unto you stand up and walk that's Authority that's power from God coming to you speaking for him little ambassadors you're the one that God is using to help the church not only yourself but to help the people in the church God places us places so that we can be a body of Believers in power brother says we should come to church and we recognize who we are we shouldn't have one feeble person to leave the church amen Hallelujah he says now no matter how little if you're a little wash woman if you're just a brother that don't have his ABCs don't make no difference who you are you're in Christ triumphant over all things your Authority is over every demon every power that the devil has you're in Christ triumphant we get into that presence Church you won't want to get out of it it's not just for the preacher in the back room and he's praying and seeking God and the Lord Holy Ghost comes down on a man and he comes out here and he's fired up and he's preaching and he's telling you the truth but what is it when you're a man or a preacher or a sister and you're watching dishes and you're now there're in the yard and you're working and you're mowing yard and you talking about God and God starts coming down and you start you start having a good Jubilee on the mower or you're washing dishes or you're at work and somebody's looking at you going what in the world's his problem if you get out of yourself out of the way and let God take over you'll save Souls but if you're in it you're not saving One Soul but if he's operating that gift and he's taking care of you and you're listening to what the word of God says you have authority sons of God hallelujah why because it's yours I like this message in 1953 greater than Soloman is here and he's preaching and he's preaching and he's preaching and he's he gets down to almost to the end before he does his prayer and and he's just going off and he's talking about the blood and he's talking about the Redemption he's talking about the kinsman redeemer and then all of a sudden he starts singing and he sings about two or three songs and then he comes in and goes oh don't it make you feel all scoured out just feel the SED of the presence of God when you are the sons of God now we're lifting up in the heaven ly places in Christ Jesus with all authority Heaven and Earth gives to us did you ever think of that somebody says have you got power no I got Authority he says what is it he's fallen in love with him why because brother brandham had a revelation who God was he realized that he was a sinner he needed saving and he gave his whole heart to Christ did he make his mistakes absolutely he made mistakes but in God's eyes he saw a Son of God if we're under the blood and the blood has covered your sins and covered you not only through your sins but down into your soul that Redemption blood's ripping down in your soul only thing he sees is that blood he sees Christ he sees Sons and Daughters of God and if he sees Sons and Daughters of God then why don't we use our exercise faith and tell the devil it's no more devil we're through it's time to stand up and stand on our two feet and say Satan it's over we've got enough scripture we've got enough quotes to show where we're at today all the critics all the ones are saying brother bandam is not this and that and that it proves that he was right it proves that he was the anointed one in Malachi 4 you know he's true because it lines up with the scriptures all right and brother Timothy puit puts that thing on there on his uh brother Wendell's Minister's chat of that car it's amazing now guy walks like he said he walks right into the thing he sits down in the passenger seat it goes around and around and takes him to another building he stops he gets out walks right up there years before a little tiny Kentucky man was already prophesied that if that don't get our our insides moving you're dead we need to go find find Jesus if that ain't going to motivate us enough to get on our knees and say oh God I need another experience in you I need something from you now Lord I need to make sure every little dot is dotted with your blood I need every sentence everything I got washed in the blood of the Lamb cover me father God cover me don't let me go oh God make sure that I've got your Authority because devils are going to come in and he's going to say oh that's a bunch of nonsense he just had a an a guess thousands and thousands of Visions you're telling me that's a guess hogwash and we got people in this message today that dream and they do things and they're off on one and people just still worshiping it now them guys need to come up to the front of the church and get that devil laid off of them prayed off of them that's what the Bible says well the prophet of God said but they're all puffed up I don't want to be puffed up I want to be in humility of the Holy Spirit leading me and guiding me and taking care of me making me washing me in the presence so that I could be the real brother William not in this flesh this flesh has to go back into the elements of this ground it's got to die out this mind has to completely die and fade away and when God comes and he's ready to give you a new body he's going to speak the body and them elements are going to come up in a spoken word revelation body that that soul that he is preparing will step into that body and he'll be just like his daddy Hallelujah we won't think about Sin anymore we won't even have the nature of what sin is all about we'll know where we come from but we're running a race today Church we're almost at the Finish Line brother Steve keep running buddy keep your head up buddy we're almost there keep running but we still need to listen to the coach coaches always Tak Ser their Runners and they don't run them on the same course that they're going to race they take them to a course that is worse than that course and when they can overwhelm that course by the way they eat and the way they take their vitamins and they drink their water at the end of that day or into that month into of that year as they run and they run up those mountains and when they come to this race they already know who they are because their coach taught them exactly how to win he told them how exactly how to keep your stride he told him how exactly when you get to this part you take off running and you run until you get to the top and then you slow down a little bit until you get to the next one because these guys are these other men are going to run at they're going to run real fast to the to the mountain and then they're going to try to run fast up that mountain and you'll be able to walk right by them because they're going to be gassed out but children of God they've got all power in heaven backing them up it's just like that little police officer standing there in the street that little fell is about a with his cap on he's about 100 PB has a badge stuck to him bunch of cars starts rolling down the road 100 miles an hour he can't stop them but when he stands out there with that badge on and he puts his hands up they start sking and tires are melting why because he's got that whole city backing him up and when you got your heart cleaned out with the word of God and God stamps his approval on it you can stand there at any devil any place any disease and stand there and put your hands up and the prophet of God says there that devil will screamen GL to God brothers and sisters brother Brown says he said he'll scream and every time you heard him preaching and he'd be telling somebody you you have cancer and this and this it's gone you hear a scream what is it he says that devil over there is that one screaming over here and calling him over here to help him but this one here smart enough to know that what's backing her up is the heaven above standing there in her position putting her hands up and saying no more and they have to flee but we've got to get to a place that this is not running my life it's not running my flesh it's not running my desires it's not running my lips it's not running my ears or what comes in and wugs out but this is running my life this is telling me what the word of God says about me and this is where I'm going to line up with my my life all right because why because that's eternity if it's in me Jesus says I'm going to go back to my father I can turn around and say the same thing this day if I am washed in the blood and I've repented of all my sins and he's filled me with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I have the right to say that I'm going back to my father whenever that day is I'm going to be there and every day until then I'm going to serve him and I'm going to wash in the word of word in the word wash in that water and I'm going to get closer to him and closer to him because I'm no good to you and I'm not no good to Pine I mean uh Pine Top unless I dedicate my life and get my life under the word not because I want to be somebody I want to be dead so God could reign in my life Hallelujah I won't be able to help him at all if I'm go there because I think I'm somebody but if I go over there humble and I say God you lead me and you lead me to the sermons you lead me to what you want them to hear and you get me out of the way and you teach them it will grow and the power of God will run but you got to look at all yourselves look in this church and look at each other and say do you love each other really do we love each other and we love each other they put your shoulder to the will we do there's only one man that's in this church that has the right to go to your house and say Hey you better step up only one man and that's the one that you pay your ties to he's the one that is a Shepherd that will go and break your leg and put him on your should his shoulders and carry you he's the only one that can do that the rest of us we got to get that two4 out of our eye first and we still don't have the right to do it God knocked me in the in the wall here the other day it's been about three we three months a three months ago I was listening to brother Brandon and he was talking he's talking about love and all of a sudden I got done I'm listening to thinking about what he was talking about and all of a sudden this this thought came to my mind and says why are you so worried about people in Pon being 30 minutes late when you can't even handle your own self just like somebody was speaking to me I'm looking around I'm think who in the world's in this room with me I opened up the door stepped out of the the the place I was uh staying in a camper and walked all the way around it to see if brother brother one of the brothers were giving me a hard time or something nobody was there I walked in I said oh God help me to get that beam out of my eye and Pastor just preached on it this morning this side right here is my worst enemy besides myself I like funny things just like you guys do I said oh God I need you Lord I cried out to him brothers and sisters I wased and I wased and I wased in the word I said Lord let my eyes only see you we don't know what's going on but it's not our business our business is to pray for our brother our sister pray and say oh God whatever they're going through let me be a b let that burden fall upon me let me pray and seek for whatever they're going through Lord give me the power Lord to cast those Devils out for with her if they're getting in a fight Lord let me put my shoulder to their shoulder Lord that'll help the pastor out more than anything why because now the body is working together the toe needs to be fixed what do you do you go grab it and you pull on it a little bit and make it pop oh man it makes it feel better don't it that's how we do it praise be to God we see it here he he goes he goes on and he says the works that I do shall ye do also Christ the same yesterday today and forever I believe him now we're sitting in Heavenly places in the presence of Christ lifted up above the cares of the world into a realm of Faith the only way we're going to get to that point is right here this is the realm he's talking about we got to get into Heavenly places in Christ so that he can pull you up into that faith to be more than conquerors where that real genuine power of God living down inside of your soul when you need it the most in the time of your desperation you can stand there with authority and say stop Satan and he has to stop brother William it's easier than what you're saying it's it's harder than what you're saying no it isn't what's hard is we're too lazy to get down on our knees we're too lazy but it's so easy to push play and watch videos it's easier to play a game with these than getting down on our knees and crying out to God brother brandham never stopped talking about prayer uh meetings all the way up to his death and if he was here today he would still be preaching on it because it's power every man that we know in history was a prayer Warrior that's the reason why they had so much overcoming power in their day the reason why they had so much good results is because they were in prayer brother Bram said it was on this on the screen this morning prayer is the most powerful weapon we have because prayer brings love and love conquers the world Hallelujah but in that realm of faith I was I was looking up some scriptures and it gave me the scripture and I kept reading and I said oh man I got to put this down and I go into my Bible and it tells me something different I'm thinking where's the scripture got so I go in there and I said okay how many bibles has this scripture and it showed me two of them that I really liked but I would like you to put up our scripture of Hebrews uh 12 And1 but I'm going to read the other two first and then we'll read the uh the one that is on our King James version but I thought this was really good in the new uh International uh uh V uh Vision it says Hebrews uh 12 And1 for everyone born of God overcomes the world this is the victory that has overcome the world even our faith in the in the new uh living the New Living Translation it says Hebrews 12 and one for every child of God defeats the evil world and we achieve this Victory through our faith I thought that was pretty good and then it goes on here and it says the way we read it in our Scriptures it says wherefore seeing we also are comp compassed about out with so great of clouds of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us all three of them are powerful but brothers and sisters we've got to learn not just to read it we've got to dissect these these these scriptures we've got to get in there and find the meaning of some of these Scriptures it will help you to understand what the prophet of God is trying to tell us we can't just read and say oh I believe it we've got to do our study and we've got to get in prayer and ask God to give us a revelation of every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God it's because it's going to be power for you it's going to help you come to be an overcomer is going to give you the authority to be able to cast out every devil it's going to give you the authority in this world that people can see that you are really truly a Christian they might make fun of you sisters but they know that you're real they've watched you you've got the greatest gift with long hair and and these dresses because that's the thing on the outside that people fight more than anything in the denominations the preachers say it's okay to wear anything you want to he's a perverted man it's not he is a man that is full of the devil that tells people that but a real man that tells you that it's Abomination for a woman to wear a man's apparel and a man wearing shorts wearing these things is ungodly something's wrong but we got to get to a place that we dissect the word of what it really means and not what you want it to mean we hear people say things and we're not listening to the person and we'll hear something totally different where that person said it because we're not giving that person our total ears to that person if I walk up to my wife say I love you y y what did you just say that means she wasn't even paying attention she's too worried about the dishes but we got to get to a place that we are considered the other person more than ourselves they matter to us brother William what does that got to do with Victory what does that got to do with overc rers it's a Christian Life a Christian life has to have these things royalty everybody in a royalty family has to walk and act like the king you have to eat just like the king you walk like the king you dress like the king you do everything as the king and Jesus just asked us to be humble like Christ and to be humble is to die out to ourselves and let God take over so that he can use that Authority through your life and you won't be boggled you'll see signs and wonders following you you young people can have signs and wonders following you brother wle has talked about when he was 12 years old laying hands on people and they were covered blind lies were open in Pentecost but see there was something down inside of his soul that was called predestinated seed of God and God was exercising that faith that he had in him and before long it came to a word and that word changed his life adoption series changed the man's life and today he's in the fullness of adoption waiting for his body change why because he fell in love with the maker and now there's Authority that comes out and it's not him no more it's Christ working through you as long as you're working on yourself he's going to use you in power use you for every devil that comes by and sometimes he'll use you to knock out Devils for your families he says here but why don't you just remember that you're raised with him and you're setting with him the counsel of God Christ you're setting with Christ with Christ now all authority is right with you so why don't you by faith just touch His Garment what is His Garment it's the word it's the word grab a hold to this word and eat the book and watch your life will change your attitude will change you'll love brother William in a greater way because he's pretty hard to love Mark 11 and in the morning as they passed by they saw a fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance said unto them Master behold the tree which thou cursed is withered away and Jesus answered and said to them have faith in God that's all it is have faith in God it's not some great big thing it's have faith in God if you have faith in God it's going to be easy to read our Bibles for every for every I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be removed and be thou cast into thy see and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire When you pray believe that he receive them and he shall have them brothers and sisters I know every one of you love God some of you guys are a whole lot smarter than I am but one thing that God has given me he gave me eternal life and eight 19 years old in high school should have been only 17 years old when I graduated but I didn't I went two more years so I went 14 years and school I had a third grade education and I know I said this many times I had to learn things hands on that was my experience my first thing I ever had to do was feed chickens and cows and horses and fix fence and cut wood and I learned those things by going going out there and Dad teaching me how to do those things then I was learned how to be a carpenter and I learned how to to be a landscaper I learned how to mow yards I learned how to to do all kinds of things to drill and drill for water and wailed and did a whole bunch of these things but I never mastered not one of them and God has taught me as long as I love him he'll guide me and he'll lead me to all truth when I got down into the murdery d d uh dumps and I went back out in the world he still holded me up and one day when I was fixing to blow my brains out God come down and spoke to my heart and says if you serve me I'll fix your broken heart from that day forward God had has taken good care of me I've made a lot of mistakes I've said a lot of things that hurt people I've said a lot of things in this church that I heard people said things across this Pulpit that it wasn't right and I shouldn't have said and you guys have forgiven me because you're Christlike but brothers and sisters one thing I want to say tonight is don't let the the devil beat on you anymore don't leave this doors until you know that you know you're filled with the Holy Ghost because we don't know what we have tomorrow but we know who's holding you right now and if there is something dying in H pulling your heart and telling you brother Williams telling you something he's pulling you this morning or this afternoon you better find an altar don't don't resist brother brandham did make it very clear and brother BR uh brother wend made it very clear the other day when he preached and he talking about the believer and he says talks about the sons there is going to be Sons that are Sons but they're not ever going to have the ring on their finger they're not going to have the royalty make sure you have it get that token in your life you'll have less Trials of defeat you'll have trials but you'll have more victories because there's people in this room 11 years ago you're still having the same same problem same problem brother Wendell has preached and preached and preached and preached all kinds of ways for us to be Overcomers don't let tonight Escape your Victory let thy Soul win tonight let victory in your life by dying out totally I don't care how old you are how young you are I've seen too many people from coast to coast that I know that are dead and didn't get right with God and they said they believe this message as your brother knowing you and you know me don't walk out them doors if you have a problem with this and why don't you ask the brothers to pray with you and let's get some strength with one another why are we so afraid of this right here but them little little girls ain't afraid of it these young boys ain't afraid to come up here but us that's been in the message for 50 years 20 years 30 years oh we're too good to be down there watch out if you have that pool this evening God's telling you the truth and you know that you're not living like you're posos to I wouldn't leave tonight unless you get it because it could be life and death Christ Jesus is in the building tonight to perform Miracles but he does it through his church his people they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they shall cast out evil spirits isn't that right the commission gives to the church that's what's the matter with the church today it don't know its position if you know your positionally who was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person here in the next five minutes that's right the things of it is you're looking off into the Millennium for something to happen when it's already here now now we are Sons and Daughters of God not we will be we are right now when this night right now this minute we're sitting together in Heavenly places with Christ now oh if you only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer anything you have desire of need of only thing you have to do is ask and receive I've got lots more but I feel like it's time to stop I just want to read this one one one scriptures Hebrews 9 and 11 through 15 but Christ being come as a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect t Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats or calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having ordain Eternal Redemption for us for it's the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of the heer sprinkled unclean sacrifices to the purification of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ of through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge our conscience with the dead Works to serve a living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of the death for the Redemption of the transgressors that here under the first testament they were all called Mighty receive the promise of Eternal inheritance as the musicians come Creator around himself a blood cell that brought forth son of Jesus Christ when he was born here on Earth he lived was made fun of called Jezebel spit on shame dis disgrace disgraceful went to Calvary and there in that pocket of that heart a cruel Roman soldier opened it up and broke the blood cell no more house up that is was brought not a blood cell is a house anymore but it was a Sprinkle of blood sprayed all around the blood cell begin to break that through that spray every believer that comes through the water of the washing of the water of the word to receive justification by faith to take that same Faith he's got in God and go right into the blood cell not cause up no more but pulls through the spray loosens the sins comes into the fellowship back where the Holy Ghost itself that was wrapped in that blood cell he by become a part of it then he can believe a Divine he uh healing for the very mind that was in Christ is in The Believer do you see it for by one sacrifice Hebrews 13 uh Hebrews 10 Hallelujah a perfect sacrifice to give you and I eternal life to give you while you're living here today the authority over every enemy that you have hallu as long as you completely die and surrender to him you have this Authority it's yours church it's your gift eternal life you old saying I can put a dollar up there and say it's yours but if it sits right

uh a little house that we wanted it kind of took us a little longer to to try to bid on it and now somebody has bid on that little house but seems like God always keeps on bringing out new houses and I believe that there's a house there for us but what I need us to pray about is when we go this time God gives me a job cuz as soon as I I get a job I can get a house and so I really would like you guys to be really when you're praying for your food praying for everyone in the church just lift me in Sharing up and say Lord Brother William believes that there's a there's a man out there that needs him to work with him that'll give me time to be with the church and and because that's what I'm going out there for is to be a pastor I'm not going out there to kill myself in work if I do that I can just stay here and work you know but God has placed me there but I do need a work but I need a job to take care of me and Sharon and so I really need to ask you guys to be in prayer for us will

and and um I know it's an exciting time for for the church there as they've been without a pastor for so long and and it's also an exciting time a new chapter for brother William and sister Sharon and um and so we uh have been keeping them in prayer and and we'll continue to keep uh them in prayer and and I would just pray that the Lord will give them many souls for their labors and and that um God would richly bless all of the families there in in pintop and um I thought before we dismissed here tonight first of all it's good to see my sister and Al uh and my mother with us tonight amen God bless y'all and um I know y'all bound to be tired and um but I'm so glad to see y'all boy I've been missing mom and dad and um just so glad to have them I wanted to just before we dismiss this it shouldn't take me very long but we talked about uh these boys that had asked me yesterday about these seven visions and um that brother brandham had and so I would mentioned a little bit this morning but I'm just going to read it to you okay is that all right with y'all and um while while their thoughts are on this and and and maybe there's some other of you young people that have not you've probably been raised listening but this is um this is this is something that brother brandham had um or he read this Sunday morning June uh 1933 he said the Lord spoke to me and said that the coming of the Lord was drawing nigh but that before he came seven major Evis uh uh events would transpire I wrote them all down and that morning gave forth the revelation of the Lord the first Vision was that M musolini would invade Ethiopia and that Nation would fall at his steps and that Vision surely did cause some repercussions some were very angry when I said it and it and would not believe it but it happened that way he was he walked in there with his modern arms and took over and the natives didn't have a chance but the vision also said that musolini would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him and that came to pass exactly as it was said the next Vision foretold was an Australian by the name of Adolf Hitler a Austrian um right uh name of Adolf Hitler which which uh would rise up as a dictator over Germany and he would draw the world into war it showed the Sig Sig freed line now this was 11 years before it happened now and how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it and then it showed that Hitler would come to a mysterious end those two have happened the third Vision was in the rim of world politics for it showed me that there would be three isms fascism na uh Nazism and uh com uh communism but that the first two would be swallowed up into the third The Voice admonished watch Russia watch Russia keep your eyes on the King of the North the fourth Vision showed the Great advant es in science that would come after the second world war also science will progress especially in the mechanical world automobiles will continue to get like an egg shape and finally they will build one that won't need a steering wheel it will be controlled by some other power it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble car that was running down beautiful highways under a remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves now I I want to stop right here in 1932 sister Keys won't you won't you show the cars of 1932 just real quickly so so here's what the cars they were cool looking cars uh 1932 th those those cars that's what they had and so you can you can see that that they sure didn't look egg shaped um and um but brother brandham said before the coming of the Lord they would the cars would get progressively egg shaped now this is this is a prophet seeing this okay just show you can go you can go through some of these pretty fast on on all those egg shaped cars I just I just uh some of the modern cars today and um uh that are that that we have so now um go go back to the uh that Google car um let's see there was another car that one right before yeah now that's a self-driving car and um that that looks really like an egg uh you know rounded and um so you know uh but uh but but Elon Musk Elon Musk and you can go and show the other this this one here this car here does not have a steering wheel in it whatsoever and um you can goad and show that that yeah there's that right there that's that's inside that's looking that's that's looking at it there is no steering wheel in this car now now brother branam God's Prophet told us these things that would transpire before the coming of the Lord now that's that's an incredible thing how that how that God uh keeps his word as I was saying this morning he keeps his word not for us to to to to to feel pretty proud that we belong to the right group he keeps his word so that you will know to believe him the Rapture is upon us and there should be fervency in our heart to serve him to love him to get sin out of our Lives to to because listen we are fixing to possess the Earth friends we are fixing to possess this Earth God's fixing to wash it or he's he's he's fixing to burn it with fire and and we're going to inherit this earth now the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women God showed me that women begin to be out of their place with the granting of the vote then they would cut off their hair or then they cut off their hair which signified that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most case more than equal rights she adopted man's clothing and went into the state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked excepted except for a little fig leaf type apron uh with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion of a moral plot of the whole earth the whole world so now again go back to 1932 I didn't get the picture for that um the way the women dressed in 1932 and um you know the uh the women still wore dresses women still had long hair they had they were beginning to Fall From Grace at that time but brother bradam seen the he seen the he he he seen the state that this world was going to be until till we are in a total absolute filth and Abyss it's it's incredible and so I would say but that vision is fulfilled now that's five visions that have that have taken place then in the sixth Vision there arose in America a most beautiful but a cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe that it was the right of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by women another place is remember that's thus saith the Lord there will be a Roman rule before the end time she'll be either she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before for the end he says thus saith the Lord write it down find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't then I'm a false prophet I saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in high in real highly royall like purple and a little little parenthesis here she was a great ruler in the United States perhaps the Catholic Church a woman woman some woman I don't know if it'll be the Catholic church I don't know I can't say the only thing I seen I seen the woman that was all and of course you know uh you can put that up there you you know there there's there is sister or sister there's Cala Harris uh re you know dressed in in in Royal Purple Royal Purple now you know he says it's either going to be a president she'll either be the uh be be he said the woman will rule before the end time she'll be either president vice president or the Catholic Church as a woman he says he he wasn't for sure he just saw a woman and so he didn't know how it was going to happen but but here and I and I want to say she might be a giggle a little giggle box everyone wants to make fun of her but behind that woman she's she's got an agenda and uh uh that that woman is she she's she's got a heart that is totally opposite of that of a Christian and um uh you know we don't know what God's got but I guarantee you I can I can definitely see if she were in power she would be willing to prove to the world that she's a leader so we don't know so but I would say I would say we've got a vice president and she was sworn into office in in in Royal Purple six Vision fulfilled he says the last and seventh Vision wherein I I heard a most terrible explosion and as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris and craters and smoke all over the land of America so we can see see here that there's only one Vision left now when when is that Vision going to transpire well you know uh brother brother Brenham uh you know did say that that Russia's got a bomb that Russia will uh of course we know the scripture says that Ro Russia is going to drop a bomb on the vaan and uh we'll destroy the Vatican once we're gone but you [Music] know uh Russia right now is is really flexing her muscle matter of fact Russia Russia says that if the World War I breaks out the US will be in it and and Russia is saying some pretty they're flexing their muscles they're getting whooped right now uh over there in Ukraine they're you know they're they're uh I mean they're losing a lot of losing a lot of lives and the US is sending over weapons and and uh and Ukraine is has been lobbing them deeper in into Russia and Russia's not happy and uh and so we we can see that things are are really gearing up thing things are really gearing up and so the coming of the Lord is so darn close and what uh my my buddy had told me last night he said I'm glad that God allowed us to come to paon he to to to know these things and and I think that's I think that's a very sensible thing for a a young man to to say and and to and to desire because God wants all of us to to make the Rapture he loves the whole world the whole world knows these Visions the whole world knows all of all of any kind of Mo most preachers have heard of brother brandom and they've they've they've studied these things but I am glad that God has given me a heart to love the Lord and to take this message and I'm glad to see others that have a heart to love him and and and we're we're looking to that California is is on it's you know um uh you know it Angel of the Lord told Brother brandham uh that that California is is is going to is going to go under that Los Angeles is going to break and go beneath the ocean and and and uh um you know he says he says in a few he says it won't stop California Los Angeles will sink it's going down she'll slide in the ocean he says in the last meeting I I had in California while speaking didn't know nothing happened till I got on the street and I told California capernium capernium the city that's called by the name of the Angels that's Los Angeles you've exalted yourself in into heaven but you'll be brought down into hell for if the mighty works that had been done in in Sodom that's been done in you it it would be standing to this day now the last few days there's been a roaring and a popping here coming the paper of science it's all honeycombed it's got to go under they just know it now you just watch the water will come Plum back into the Salton Sea Los angelist is doomed for judgment I tell you before it happens that you you might know when it does happen I never spoke that myself I never had him tell me any uh tell me one thing but what happened you can bear record of that that's right see he says now when I don't know and so uh we but we can we can see that these things are these are these are wonderful things you say wonderful it's wonderful that God would send warning God gives warning God gives and when we see the title waves and we see these things taking place as brother William was was was ministering tonight we want to make sure that we've got every tea crossed every eye dotted we want to make sure that we're walking hand inand with God God's not called any of us to the Great Tribulation he's not called us to that he's called us to a Rapture amen and as we see as I was saying this morning when we see the the the words of God coming to pass God gave the vision way back in 1932 what is that seven years we lack seven years from it being a hundred years am I right uh since that was spoke huh and uh so we're but we're we're uh we want we want don't don't let those things that have happened I I think I think science making a big deal and and people making a big deal about the robo taxi and and things of that nature I I think it's every time we we we see that it's God saying hey hey I'm keeping my word hey it's getting closer hey I'm fixing to come and get you I gave you a promise to look at now he's given us his word but then he sends a prophet and gives us a few things that we can look at for this generation amen and and says hey when you see this and you see this and you check it off and you check it off
