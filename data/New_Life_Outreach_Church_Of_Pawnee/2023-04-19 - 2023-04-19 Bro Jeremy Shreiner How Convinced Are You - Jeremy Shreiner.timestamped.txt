[8:48] know her
[8:50] amen you can get ready to play that if
[8:53] you want to
[8:54] this is a song that you probably know
[8:58] and it's kind of been of a theme for my
[9:01] wife and I the last month or so
[9:04] I don't think any church I go to
[9:07] no matter what church I go to no matter
[9:09] what family whatever home I walk into
[9:11] you're facing trials troubles
[9:15] battles struggles whatever it may be and
[9:18] a lot of times Satan has a tendency to
[9:20] to weaken us down it's a series that
[9:22] I've been on for a long time I told the
[9:24] church brother Jason Jackson's I said
[9:26] it's hard to get 10 sermons into into
[9:28] two I gotta fit them into one tonight
[9:31] don't worry about it I'm just kidding
[9:32] I'm not gonna go that route
[9:34] but there's no matter what it is Our
[9:37] Testimony is that we're going to see a
[9:39] victory and if you know this song I want
[9:41] you to sing it with us I don't want to
[9:43] just sing it in front of you I want you

[9:52] you know it just sing it along it's
[9:53] called see a victory if you have it but
[9:55] we'll just try a weapon may be formed
[9:59] but it won't prosper
[10:03] when the Darkness Falls it won't Prevail
[10:10] cause the God I serve knows only how to
[10:14] try

[13:35] Hallelujah well
[13:38] for the sake of time we'll go ahead and
[13:39] jump right in this tonight while you're
[13:41] standing we'll turn to Revelation
[13:43] chapter 12.
[13:45] amen we just love the Lord with all of
[13:47] our heart and Trust tonight that we can
[13:49] say something that'll be a help to you
[13:51] along the way
[13:53] there's just been a lot of burdens you
[13:57] know the ministry understands this just
[13:58] a lot of burdens throughout the message
[14:01] and a lot of things that have been going
[14:03] on and and you just you see what Satan's
[14:06] trying to do and we don't want to give
[14:08] the enemy any Glory by any means
[14:12] and but I think that we need to know
[14:14] what he's trying to do we shouldn't
[14:16] whistle through a graveyard and just
[14:17] think that we're going to come out okay
[14:18] we should be prepared for the enemy and
[14:22] so tonight we just want to take this
[14:24] thought just simply how convinced are
[14:26] you now I know you're I know your
[14:28] message people tonight and I understand
[14:30] that I'm speaking to message people
[14:32] tonight so let's just take this verse 3
[14:34] Revelation 12 3 it says and there
[14:37] appeared another Wonder in heaven and
[14:40] behold a great red dragon having seven
[14:42] heads and ten horns and seven crowns
[14:45] upon his head
[14:46] and as tale drew the third part of the
[14:49] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[14:52] earth and the dragons stood before the
[14:54] woman which was ready to be delivered
[14:57] for to devour her child as soon as it
[15:00] was born amen let's just pray together
[15:02] Heavenly Father
[15:04] Lord as we come before you this evening
[15:06] Lord we thank you for this assembly
[15:09] father here in Pawnee Lord and the
[15:11] ministry father and the helps and each
[15:13] person that is here Lord I believe I
[15:16] heard that many are out of town Lord
[15:18] maybe sick or going to certain
[15:20] circumstances of life that they've had
[15:22] to deal with Lord of pray for comfort
[15:24] during those times but Lord we're here
[15:26] tonight Lord and each and every one that
[15:28] has made it through these doors you know
[15:30] who they are
[15:31] you know the need in their life
[15:33] father I can't meet that need there's no
[15:36] man that can stand behind this sacred
[15:39] desk and meet any needs it takes you so
[15:42] father I Surrender my my mind my
[15:44] thoughts to you now and ask that you are
[15:46] just calm the nerves father and that you
[15:47] would begin to speak father directly to
[15:49] the heart we surrender ourselves to you
[15:52] now in Jesus precious name we ask you
[15:54] amen God bless you can be seated
[15:57] tonight there we go
[16:03] brother Branham said in the greatest
[16:05] battle ever fought he said this great
[16:07] first battle that was ever fought began
[16:09] in heaven when Michael and his angels
[16:12] fought against Lucifer and his and his
[16:14] angels it first started her the first
[16:16] battle was in heaven so sin did not
[16:18] originate on Earth it originated in
[16:20] heaven
[16:21] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[16:23] cast out of the Earth or Out of Heaven
[16:25] to the Earth and fell on human beings
[16:29] then the battle from Angels become human
[16:32] battles
[16:33] and Satan come to destroy God's creation
[16:38] what God had created to be for himself
[16:42] he had Satan come to destroy or Satan
[16:46] had come to destroy this that's what his
[16:48] purpose was was to destroy it then the
[16:51] battle began here on Earth and begin in
[16:54] us and has been raging ever since
[16:58] so what is it that we find as we try to
[17:01] bring all of these thoughts in in my
[17:03] heart and my mind to to a central
[17:06] location tonight what is it that we find
[17:09] from the beginning to now that brings
[17:12] the ministry what is what is it the
[17:14] greatest thing that we should be
[17:16] concerned about on the hour that we're
[17:17] living in now I know that you're here
[17:19] tonight and I know that you've come to
[17:21] church and you've and you've worshiped
[17:23] God but there's been a lot of worshipers
[17:24] there's been a lot of church members
[17:26] there's been a lot of message people
[17:28] that have showed up to church or
[17:29] ministered the gospel or or have
[17:32] performed duties or have been sheep of
[17:34] this message if you would but how many
[17:36] people are sticking with it and our
[17:39] thought as we deal with this has how
[17:41] convinced are you really in this message
[17:44] and but what is the passion or what is
[17:47] the The Burning Desire that we feel that
[17:50] is happening today enough that it was
[17:52] even preached with great Passion from
[17:54] pastors and evangelists it is the power
[17:57] of deception
[17:59] and what deception is this that we're
[18:01] dealing with and again bear with me I
[18:03] understand that I'm speaking to message
[18:05] people tonight and so I I know that we
[18:08] have to and I dealt with this at home
[18:10] and and even in other places and I know
[18:12] that we have to deal with worldlyism and
[18:14] how it creeps into the home and how it
[18:16] could be creeping into the church but I
[18:18] really want you to look at this tonight
[18:19] and I want you to understand that it's
[18:21] not worldlyism that's going to try to
[18:23] attract the bride
[18:24] it's not worldlyism so much that's going
[18:26] to try to attract the uh the church
[18:29] member if you would but the Bible tells
[18:32] us of such a great deception that would
[18:34] be so close that if it could it could
[18:36] deceive the very elect and worldlyism is
[18:39] not going to deceive the elect you're
[18:41] not going to be caught off guard by the
[18:43] things of the world but there's
[18:45] something that will try to creep into a
[18:46] church a good church of a church of good
[18:49] people and try to weaken the body
[18:51] so much that even Jesus himself in
[18:54] Matthew 24 4 said and Jesus said unto
[18:56] them take heed that no man deceive you
[18:59] for many shall come in my name so he's
[19:02] not saying many is going to come in this
[19:03] name or that name I mean he's going to
[19:05] come in the name of worldlyism or these
[19:07] things but he said he's going to come in
[19:08] my name and saying I am Christ and shall
[19:11] deceive many so the deception of the age
[19:14] was the deception that we have to be
[19:17] concerned about that we have to be
[19:19] concerned about now is that we have a
[19:21] group of people that think they're right
[19:24] and can't accept help
[19:27] brother Branham said in the laodicean
[19:29] church age he says it boasts but it
[19:31] cannot back it up it cries peace and
[19:35] there is no peace it cries that it has a
[19:37] great amplitude of all things but it
[19:40] keeps burning with desire like an
[19:42] unsatisfied fire
[19:44] so they're constantly by the window
[19:46] they're looking for something else
[19:47] they're looking for something because
[19:49] there's one place where brother Branham
[19:51] talked about him forgive me I don't have
[19:52] a word for word but I'll give it to you
[19:54] later if I can where he's talking about
[19:56] are people that now are not satisfied
[19:58] enough with the word of God
[20:00] they're not satisfied with what God can
[20:03] do in their midst and so they're
[20:04] constantly looking for other things
[20:06] they're looking for all of these things
[20:08] and he says there's no peace saith my
[20:10] God to the wicked he says they are
[20:14] miserable now I might not be talking to
[20:16] you tonight you might be completely on
[20:18] fire this evening and that's okay but
[20:20] just bear with me all right and and pray
[20:22] that we don't find ourselves in this
[20:23] condition but we also succumb to the
[20:26] position where we say God I want to make
[20:28] sure that I don't find myself getting to
[20:30] that position he says he says that there
[20:33] are they are miserable that means that
[20:35] they are objects to be pitied
[20:38] you know you know the message he said
[20:41] pity they scorn pity they are full of
[20:46] pride
[20:48] so what do we have to look at because we
[20:50] know that Satan is trying to be an
[20:53] impersonation of God that's why you
[20:56] can't look at someone and see that they
[20:57] have an emotion and say that they have
[20:59] the Holy Spirit the Bible says you know
[21:01] them by their fruits and I Know It
[21:02] talked about the the false prophets and
[21:04] things but we can take that and know
[21:06] them by their fruits that is that is
[21:08] more than just listen it's both sides
[21:10] it's more than just an emotion but it's
[21:12] also more than just a legalism spirit
[21:15] that you can say well I don't I don't
[21:17] have this and I don't do these things in
[21:18] my home and and and listen there's a
[21:21] group of people that stood before Jesus
[21:23] and they claimed all of their legalism
[21:25] and missed the life but then we have to
[21:28] be careful on the other side that we
[21:29] bring before our God our actions and all
[21:32] of the things that we do in church and
[21:34] all the things that we do and we're
[21:36] actually missing the word that is being
[21:38] opened let's come back to the middle of
[21:40] the road and say God we need the word
[21:42] and the life put together so that we can
[21:44] survive this journey
[21:46] so we know that Satan is trying to
[21:49] impersonate God so he's not going to
[21:51] attract you with worldly things now
[21:53] listen I understand that every now and
[21:55] then you're going to be hit with things
[21:56] that's not what I'm saying but would you
[21:57] allow me to go into this Avenue
[22:00] so we know that he is trying to
[22:02] impersonate what God is trying to do
[22:05] today now he couldn't do it before but
[22:07] now that there's an open book you cannot
[22:09] just look and say well because they
[22:11] believe in serpent seed or because they
[22:13] believe uh in a prophet that their
[22:15] Rapture material listen I can stand
[22:18] behind this pulpit and preach the word
[22:19] of God and call fire from heaven and I
[22:22] can prime a prayer line and there can be
[22:24] a mighty move of God and I can split
[22:26] hell wide open
[22:28] amen hallelujah I'm going to just keep
[22:30] preaching anyhow is that all right
[22:32] notice what we say we know Satan is an
[22:34] impersonation so second Corinthians 11
[22:37] 13 for such are false Apostles deceitful
[22:40] workers what does he say transforming
[22:43] themselves into the Apostles of Christ
[22:47] he says and don't Marvel about this
[22:49] for Satan himself is transformed into an
[22:53] angel of Light therefore listen
[22:56] carefully it is no great thing if his
[22:59] ministers
[23:01] also be transformed as the Ministers of
[23:04] righteousness
[23:06] notice brother he did not just say
[23:08] unrighteousness but he said Ministers of
[23:11] righteousness
[23:12] what does this saying we've got to be
[23:14] careful that we're not following just
[23:16] Ministries
[23:18] listen we've got to be careful that
[23:20] we're not just bowing to an image
[23:22] we wanted we weren't called to bow to an
[23:25] image but that image that God gave us
[23:27] that Prophet that God gave us called us
[23:29] to look to the great one
[23:31] oh my Hallelujah so so therefore it is
[23:35] no great thing that his ministers be
[23:36] transformed as Ministers of
[23:38] righteousness whose end shall be
[23:39] according to their works now I I I don't
[23:43] have this down here but we're just going
[23:44] to go this route anyways because God
[23:46] says so you think about what we find in
[23:48] in the ranks that we're living in in the
[23:50] ranks of religion itself you you think
[23:53] well I can discern
[23:55] what's going on really
[23:57] can you let's just think about it for a
[23:59] moment
[24:00] let's just go let's just go but right
[24:02] before the cross if you would let's go
[24:05] on a journey to the room
[24:07] where the disciples were together
[24:09] and they said in this room with Jesus
[24:12] and I and I like to paint this picture
[24:14] by the window of of this moment to where
[24:16] they were away from the crowds
[24:19] they didn't have to put on a front
[24:22] they were they were with the master
[24:25] they were at peace they were sitting
[24:27] around a table they were having
[24:28] communion with Jesus
[24:30] and in this part of communion
[24:33] Satan was still on the move
[24:36] oh man I'm Alive come on let's be real
[24:39] with this now there was nobody there
[24:42] come on there was no worldlyism there
[24:45] oh but we'll brother Jeremy we know
[24:47] about Judas you know on this side of the
[24:50] story
[24:51] you know now that Judas was a son of
[24:53] perdition but they didn't know then
[24:56] because the Bible tells us that Judas
[24:58] had a Ministry like all of them
[25:02] Judas had a Ministry that was brother
[25:04] Branham even said himself that he it was
[25:06] not inferior nor nor devilish
[25:10] he had a Ministry just like them
[25:13] oh yeah but we can discern listen to all
[25:16] of those men sat there and let's talk
[25:18] about the revealing of the word in a
[25:20] service
[25:22] so we find where Jesus talks to these uh
[25:26] to his his disciples
[25:29] come on we're having a church service
[25:31] right
[25:32] and he's talking to his disciples and
[25:34] and he's saying you know tonight uh
[25:37] someone is going to betray me
[25:39] well naturally if you were in a church
[25:41] service and brother Wendell gets up here
[25:43] and says tonight somebody's going to do
[25:44] something everyone's going to be like
[25:45] who
[25:47] if you're in your right mind
[25:50] well who's going to portray you there's
[25:52] no worldlyism here there's no outside
[25:54] person these are all of our brothers
[25:58] these are the ones that have cast out
[26:00] demons have had great conventions
[26:03] who is this going to be now Jesus gave
[26:06] an answer
[26:07] he said to one that I'm going to dip the
[26:09] SOP
[26:11] and give it to or basically give him the
[26:13] bread that's the one
[26:14] and notice so Jesus spoke the word this
[26:18] is how it's going to be and he fulfilled
[26:21] it
[26:22] he gave it to Judas
[26:24] and basically said go do what you must
[26:26] do
[26:27] and Judas took that stop and he got up
[26:31] and he left and if you read the Bible
[26:33] they said well Judas must be going to do
[26:36] something good
[26:39] look it up
[26:40] because he carries the bag
[26:45] wait a minute wait
[26:47] Jesus they asked they asked the question
[26:50] at least we're at church
[26:52] they asked the question who was it Jesus
[26:55] spoke it Vindicated it it came to pass
[26:58] and they said well it sure still can be
[27:01] him
[27:04] and you talk about discernment
[27:08] brothers and sisters what I'm talking
[27:10] about is we have to be careful because
[27:11] it was Vindicated to them not only
[27:14] brother Wendell did they not see it and
[27:16] they still said it can't be him then
[27:18] they begin to quell about who was going
[27:20] to be the best
[27:25] I'm going to move on now
[27:27] I'm just trying to be real with you it's
[27:29] deception that we got to worry about
[27:32] we've got to worry about it because it
[27:33] came up not from the outside it came
[27:36] from within
[27:38] then uh then Satan entered into a
[27:44] message believer
[27:47] again hey stop with your after the fact
[27:50] prophecies
[27:51] you know now we're who he is
[27:53] but you didn't know then
[27:56] all right
[27:57] so we find this deception
[28:00] that's in the land today why is it
[28:02] because Satan's trying to get to the
[28:04] message people he's trying to get to the
[28:07] Bride of Jesus Christ and he knows that
[28:09] he's not going to get you with the
[28:10] things of the world
[28:12] so we find the Bible everything that God
[28:14] had and God was for him Satan
[28:17] impersonated notice Revelation 5 5 and
[28:20] one of the elders said unto me weep not
[28:22] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[28:25] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[28:27] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[28:29] thereof that's the lion
[28:32] the tribe of Judah right
[28:34] notice the impersonation first Peter 5 8
[28:37] be sober be vigilant because your
[28:39] adversary the devil as
[28:42] a roaring lion
[28:43] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[28:49] as a roaring lion okay uh you you're a
[28:52] lion I'm going to be as a roaring lion
[28:55] Jesus said well now Jesus didn't I mean
[28:58] the word of God didn't just say well
[29:00] just forget about it no I said be sober
[29:02] be vigilant
[29:04] because he's there to try to bring
[29:07] listen and that impersonation could be
[29:08] so close to the truth that you'll fall
[29:10] for it if you're not sold out to God
[29:13] that's why I'm asking how convinced
[29:15] really are you in this message because
[29:17] those disciples said with Jesus even one
[29:20] of them said I will not now I know while
[29:21] they didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[29:23] Ghost there's many today that claim it
[29:25] but don't have the life
[29:28] you can't say that you have the Holy
[29:30] Ghost by just saying you believe God
[29:31] sent a prophet just like you can't say
[29:34] you have the Holy Ghost just because
[29:35] you've spoken another language
[29:37] there's a life that follows it
[29:40] oh my notice that so there's the
[29:42] impersonation notice Revelation 19 11.
[29:46] and I saw heaven opened up and behold a
[29:48] white horse and he that sat upon him was
[29:51] called faithful and true and
[29:53] righteousness he does judge and make war
[29:56] notice what that was we know who that is
[29:58] I'm just going to for the sake of time
[30:00] verse 13 and he was clothed with a
[30:03] vesture dipped in Blood and his name was
[30:05] called the word of God so here we see
[30:07] God himself
[30:09] coming on a white horse and then we see
[30:11] the impersonation Revelation 6 1 and I
[30:14] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[30:15] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[30:17] of Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[30:19] come and see and I saw him Behold a
[30:21] white horse
[30:24] impersonation you say well we know
[30:26] listen the prophet of God until it was
[30:28] revealed to him saw the same thing
[30:34] come on it's deception so close to the
[30:37] truth
[30:39] and so we see that it was so close that
[30:41] even the prophet had to have his eyes
[30:43] open to it
[30:45] I'm so glad for our prophet I'm so glad
[30:48] that we had a prophet that was humble
[30:50] enough to say I was wrong I needed it
[30:52] open to me
[30:55] take that how you will
[30:57] think about the true prophet of God Amos
[31:00] 3 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing
[31:02] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[31:04] servants the prophets is not not the
[31:07] word so God has a plan he's going to
[31:09] speak through His prophets Satan says
[31:12] all right I got something for you too so
[31:13] then we had to have a warning in Matthew
[31:15] 7 15 beware of false prophets which come
[31:19] to you in sheep's clothing not worldly
[31:22] clothing
[31:26] clothing that means they're religious
[31:28] people that means they go to church
[31:30] every time they can you got to beware of
[31:32] them though
[31:34] but inwardly they are rabbeting wolves
[31:37] you shall know them by their fruits do
[31:40] men gather Grapes of thorns and or figs
[31:42] of thistles so we see the true prophets
[31:45] and then the false prophets and then God
[31:48] gives us a true Ministry Ephesians 4 11
[31:50] right 11 and 12. I'm just gonna you know
[31:53] what that is I'm not gonna I'm just
[31:55] going to try to hurry up
[31:57] wait I'm trying I really am
[32:00] true Ministries okay I'm going to read
[32:02] it anyhow because some people don't like
[32:04] it and he gave some Apostles some
[32:06] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[32:08] and teachers it's still in the Bible
[32:12] for the perfecting of the Saints not me
[32:14] yes it is you if you are a saint if
[32:17] you're not a saint then of course it
[32:18] ain't you you don't have to worry about
[32:19] it for the work of the ministry for the
[32:22] edifying of the body of Christ and then
[32:24] Satan says I got one for you second
[32:26] Timothy 4 2 preach the word be instant
[32:29] in season out of season reprove rebuke
[32:32] exhort with all long-suffering and
[32:33] Doctrine for the time will come
[32:36] if this ain't the time
[32:40] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[32:42] but after their own lusts
[32:45] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[32:47] having itching ears and they shall turn
[32:50] away their ears from the truth and shall
[32:52] be turned unto Fable Satan says I got
[32:55] something for you too
[32:57] listen I just read it if Satan
[32:59] transformed himself into an angel of
[33:01] Light
[33:02] and he has Ministers of righteousness
[33:05] how much more should we be careful that
[33:07] we do not get caught up in a movement
[33:12] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[33:15] I'm not talking about a move of God
[33:16] because listen there ain't nothing like
[33:19] a move of God that's been going on
[33:22] and Satan recognizes that and he's
[33:25] trying to capitalize on that and he's
[33:27] catching people
[33:29] you see wherever God is and has a move
[33:32] Satan follows suit with his own
[33:35] we find this in Christ the mystery and
[33:37] he says and here is Lucifer at his job
[33:39] again today and remember the Antichrist
[33:42] is not communism
[33:44] he said the Antichrist is so close to
[33:46] the real thing
[33:50] till it deceived the very elect if it
[33:53] was possible
[33:54] Jesus said in Matthew 24 if they're the
[33:57] elected if it was possible Lucifer again
[33:59] Lucifer again is breaking God's unity in
[34:03] Man by his limiting the word of God to
[34:08] his reasonings
[34:10] when he thinks oh my
[34:14] what he thinks that's right and what he
[34:17] thinks he breaks the word of God
[34:22] and the same thing he did in the days of
[34:24] Jesus and Jesus said you by your
[34:27] Traditions has made the word of God of
[34:31] no effect
[34:34] so you know this right you see this so
[34:36] what does the bible warn us of in second
[34:38] Peter chapter 3 verse 17 it says ye
[34:40] therefore beloved scene you know these
[34:42] things before
[34:44] beware
[34:46] well I'm a message believer I got to
[34:48] worry about it
[34:49] guard that word beware is guard
[34:52] lest ye also
[34:55] being led away with the heir of the
[34:58] wicked fall from notice brother when you
[35:00] notice what it says your own
[35:02] steadfastness
[35:07] come on he's speaking to message people
[35:09] because you're steadfast you're you're
[35:11] solid in something but he says if you're
[35:14] not on guard
[35:15] come on if you're not staying where you
[35:18] should be if you come on you can get
[35:20] religious in yourself if you want to or
[35:22] you can lean it upon a single emotion or
[35:25] you can come back to the word of God and
[35:26] say Lord Give Me Your word open it to me
[35:29] give me all of myself give me out of my
[35:32] religion and give me guide me into that
[35:36] so he says call from that notice notice
[35:38] Colossians 2 8 says beware lest any man
[35:42] spoil you
[35:44] through philosophy and vain deceit after
[35:48] the tradition of men and after the
[35:49] rudiments of the world and not after
[35:51] Christ again that word beware Gorge
[35:53] yourself why because there's there's
[35:56] something that's trying to spoil you now
[35:58] that word spoil now it commonly means to
[36:01] corrupt or to cause Decay and perish as
[36:04] fruit is spoiled by keeping too long but
[36:07] if we look at that Greek here it's used
[36:09] to mean to spoil in the sense of plunder
[36:11] and rob you
[36:14] as in plunder during war taken in war
[36:18] that means the meaning is to take heed
[36:21] lest anyone plunder or Rob you of your
[36:25] faith and your hope
[36:28] because these false teachers would strip
[36:30] them of their Faith and Hope as an
[36:33] invading Army would rob a country
[36:38] that was
[36:40] all a country of all that was valuable
[36:46] you see the enemy wants to come in and
[36:48] he wants to rob you of your joy
[36:50] and he wants to rob you of your faith
[36:52] and he wants to rob you of everything
[36:54] that's valuable
[36:55] foreign
[36:58] what you have sitting next to you is a
[37:01] value
[37:02] but it's not the most valuable thing
[37:06] I know that's hard to take but my wife
[37:08] understands that the the person across
[37:10] the church is valuable but it's not the
[37:13] most valuable thing
[37:15] the car that you drive the job that you
[37:17] have the house that you have yes they
[37:19] have some value but it's not what's
[37:21] that's not what really Satan is after
[37:26] he's after your soul
[37:29] come on now just just bear with me so
[37:31] close
[37:32] so close so close that it could deceive
[37:35] you
[37:37] if you allow it to
[37:40] okay notice brother Branham and Satan's
[37:42] Eden says the God of this world today
[37:44] the worshiped person of this world today
[37:48] is Satan and the people are ignorant of
[37:51] worshiping Satan but it's Satan
[37:54] impersonating himself as the church
[37:59] as the church he says and they worship
[38:03] Satan thinking that they are worshiping
[38:05] God through the church but it's the way
[38:07] Satan has done it
[38:09] I yeah think about it
[38:12] he said oh you say
[38:14] wait a minute we preach the word and he
[38:18] capitalized word
[38:20] he said wait a minute we preached the
[38:22] word he says look back here at my text
[38:25] tonight Satan was the one that preached
[38:27] the word to Eve
[38:32] I think you know the Bible
[38:35] God hath said
[38:38] it's that misconstruating part of the
[38:41] scripture that applies to the day he'll
[38:43] let you know that what Jesus did was
[38:46] perfectly well
[38:49] he'll let you know all that Moses did
[38:51] was perfectly well
[38:54] but when you take the promises that God
[38:57] gave for this day then that was applied
[39:00] to another age well that's all that's
[39:03] just all he has to do see is to get the
[39:05] people to believe it that way
[39:07] you cannot take one word away from it or
[39:10] add one word to it
[39:12] which leads us to the major question
[39:14] tonight
[39:15] how convinced really are you
[39:19] because the first scripture we read we
[39:21] talked about something that occurred if
[39:23] Satan influenced a third
[39:27] of the angels from a place of complete
[39:30] perfection
[39:32] almost slow down for a minute if he
[39:34] influenced
[39:36] a third of perfection
[39:41] let's go even further if he influenced a
[39:44] perfect creation
[39:46] in the garden
[39:48] stop there for a minute before you get
[39:50] all spiritual on me oh she was just a
[39:52] she was at the byproduct come on perfect
[39:55] creation
[39:57] anything God does is perfect
[40:00] so
[40:01] get your
[40:05] if he influenced so let's talk about a
[40:08] glorious place
[40:09] a place of perfection and Eden
[40:12] if he influenced all of these things how
[40:15] convinced are you in his Eden
[40:19] that you can actually stand
[40:22] because that word convinced is
[40:23] completely certain about something now I
[40:25] know that there's legalism in the
[40:27] message I get that where people are
[40:29] completely convinced that their legalism
[40:31] will get him there and I know that
[40:32] there's that there's people that that
[40:34] hold to emotion and believe that emotion
[40:36] is exactly what's going to get him there
[40:38] that's not what it's all about
[40:40] and you have to know that I'm not
[40:42] speaking against one or the other I'm
[40:44] just trying to bring it to a balance
[40:45] because you come to my church we believe
[40:47] in it all we believe in the word of God
[40:49] we believe in the gifts of the holy
[40:51] spirit active in the church we believe
[40:52] in all of these things listen we I just
[40:55] came from a church service in Arkansas
[40:57] where we had Miracle after Miracle
[40:58] happen in a prayer line I believe in
[41:00] these things but what are we going to do
[41:02] after these things
[41:04] Satan sees it and we begin to draw only
[41:08] towards those things if we're not
[41:09] careful and we begin to hold to our the
[41:12] things that we don't do and say because
[41:14] I don't do these things I'm going to
[41:16] make a Rapture and then we come to the
[41:17] other side of the world because I ran
[41:19] around the church one time that's going
[41:20] to do it that's what Satan wants you to
[41:22] think but know you've got to come back
[41:24] to the word of God and be born again be
[41:27] filled with the spirit
[41:29] to where the house of God becomes the
[41:31] most important thing to where reading
[41:33] the word of God is more than just
[41:35] legalism but it's a love letter listen
[41:38] we got to come back to this being a love
[41:40] letter I want to fall in love with Jesus
[41:42] ask yourself the question right now do I
[41:45] love him more than anything else man I
[41:48] just felt that come in do I love him
[41:50] more than anything else do I love him
[41:52] more than my spouse do I love her more
[41:54] than my children do I love him more than
[41:56] my job do I love him more than my car oh
[41:59] God I want to love you more than
[42:00] anything else
[42:03] you got to ask yourself the question and
[42:05] you got to be honest
[42:07] there's got to be conviction
[42:09] conviction is not just in the mind
[42:11] because Christianity is not a convenient
[42:14] religion
[42:16] you've been lied to if you've been told
[42:18] that getting the baptism of the Holy
[42:19] Ghost would make everything hunky-dory
[42:22] I know you haven't been told that here
[42:26] you've been lied to that being born
[42:27] again would fix all of your problems
[42:30] you've been lied to if you've been told
[42:32] getting married will fix a problem
[42:36] you've been lied to if you've been told
[42:38] getting more money we'll fix a problem
[42:41] and you I'm gonna go back to the
[42:42] spiritual side you've been lied to by if
[42:44] if that's what you feel because when you
[42:47] truly get born again listen the target
[42:49] you thought you had
[42:51] been exploded
[42:53] Satan will do whatever he can to stop
[42:56] you he'll try to get the ministry by
[42:58] getting to the wife
[42:59] he'll try to get to this one by getting
[43:01] to the husband he'll try to get to the
[43:03] children by getting to the mom or the
[43:04] dad he'll try to get to the mom or dad
[43:06] by getting to the children he'll get to
[43:08] the church
[43:10] by coming up amongst the church
[43:14] well let's just stop for a minute and
[43:16] let's let's look at a believer
[43:19] Genesis 25 29 he was a believer
[43:22] we're talking about Esau
[43:24] see again let's let's throw away our
[43:29] future tense prophecies and all the
[43:31] things that we know now
[43:32] because here was a man that was born
[43:35] what the birthright is his
[43:39] let's just read it together Genesis 25
[43:41] 29 I'll give you a second to turn there
[43:43] more than likely to give myself a second
[43:44] to drink
[43:47] Hallelujah
[43:49] so notice what he says or what the Bible
[43:51] says here in Jacob sawed pottage
[43:54] if you don't know what that means it
[43:55] means he was cooking
[43:58] wow sinful he was cooking food
[44:01] haniso came from the field and he was
[44:03] faint
[44:05] that's probably more faint than what my
[44:07] daughter says when she's starving
[44:10] but listen
[44:12] brother Merle this guy was just hungry
[44:14] he was so hungry that he thought he was
[44:16] going to die
[44:17] and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray
[44:19] thee I mean you're my brother come on
[44:21] help a brother out
[44:23] feed me I pray thee with the same red
[44:25] pottage for I am faint therefore his
[44:28] name was called Edom
[44:30] and Jacob said while this escalated
[44:32] quickly
[44:34] tell me this day thy Birthright what a
[44:36] church service
[44:41] and Esau said behold I am at the point
[44:43] to die and what profit me shall this
[44:46] church even have for me
[44:49] I'm at the point about what point
[44:52] what point is even reading the Bible
[44:54] anymore
[44:55] what point is getting filled with the
[44:57] Holy Ghost anymore
[44:59] I've seen people speak in tongues and go
[45:01] curse the next day what's point and
[45:03] seeking the gifts anymore
[45:06] and Esau said behold I am at the point
[45:09] of die what prophet out of this birth
[45:10] Roger me and Jacob said swear to me this
[45:13] day and he swear unto him and he sold
[45:16] his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob
[45:19] gave he saw bread and pottage of lentils
[45:21] and did eat and drink and Rose up and
[45:23] went his way and Esau despised his
[45:27] Birthright
[45:30] now let's you know Esau still had cattle
[45:34] he still had land
[45:37] in fact
[45:39] he still caused fear to Jacob
[45:45] but he devalued
[45:48] the spiritual seed line
[45:52] in our day we could say he devalued the
[45:54] token
[45:56] it's not important
[45:59] help me Lord
[46:01] can I just say this he it what was it
[46:05] it was Hunger that caused Esau to
[46:09] devalue the birthright
[46:12] it was an adultery
[46:14] it wasn't murder
[46:16] are you with me it wasn't cursing
[46:19] somebody out
[46:21] it was simply hunger
[46:24] something that is natural brother
[46:25] Wendell that caused him to say what's
[46:29] the point
[46:31] I'm gonna let that sink in
[46:34] you see Satan is not so much just gonna
[46:37] come at you with a box
[46:40] or music or a magazine
[46:44] sometimes he's just going to use life
[46:48] to cause you to devalue the importance
[46:52] of
[46:54] God and his word
[46:56] he'll cause you to devalue uh your
[47:00] prayer time he'll cause you to devalue
[47:02] the Holy Ghost because man the Holy
[47:04] Ghost is nothing but emotion that's not
[47:05] what it is but listen if you get born
[47:07] again and you get filled with the
[47:08] baptism of the Holy Spirit you get so
[47:10] excited something's going to happen
[47:13] listen I've seen people get the baptism
[47:14] of the Holy Ghost and just literally
[47:16] just weep they didn't shout they didn't
[47:18] run the aisles but they just wept they
[47:21] never wept before
[47:22] and I've seen a life that follows it
[47:24] I've seen people get the baptism of the
[47:26] Holy Ghost and God's power just move and
[47:28] they just run around the church and
[47:30] their life lived proved it
[47:33] I want to bring this home to you tonight
[47:35] how convinced are you how convinced with
[47:37] Esau in his Birthright that's simply
[47:40] hunger caused him to say it's not worth
[47:43] it
[47:46] what did it it wasn't a I'm going to
[47:48] drive this home it wasn't a major sin
[47:51] that we would call it
[47:53] it was Hunger that's why we've got to be
[47:56] careful that we don't look at our
[47:58] circumstance we have allowed
[48:00] circumstances to devalue the importance
[48:02] of God
[48:04] we've allowed circumstances to devalue
[48:07] the importance of the house of God to
[48:09] devalue the importance of a prayer life
[48:11] to devalue the importance of coming and
[48:14] worshiping God with all of our heart I'm
[48:16] not saying that we we have things that
[48:18] we've got to do that's not what I'm
[48:20] saying I'm just saying God help us help
[48:22] us as message people not to devalue the
[48:25] importance of worship to devalue the
[48:28] importance of listening to the word of
[48:30] God and being hungry for the word of God
[48:32] listen I don't just want you to sit here
[48:34] tonight and look at me or for the
[48:37] windowless preaching or any brother
[48:38] that's preaching I want you to look at
[48:40] the word of God I would just say I'm
[48:42] hungry for the word of God to where the
[48:45] things of this world just natural things
[48:47] will pull you away
[48:50] you don't know where Satan might use one
[48:52] of your best friends
[48:55] to grab your attention
[48:57] and to cause you to devalue
[48:59] simple life things
[49:06] the enemy like I said doesn't always use
[49:09] worldly things
[49:11] but he'll use life to entice you to just
[49:15] give up
[49:17] nobody understands nobody understands
[49:19] what I'm going through nobody
[49:21] understands my heart nobody understands
[49:23] it's it's a natural desire it doesn't
[49:25] matter it might be a natural desire but
[49:28] if it pulls you away from the almighty
[49:30] God then rebuke it
[49:32] God has something for you
[49:37] something listen I don't want it to
[49:39] entice me I don't want I don't want to
[49:41] get caught up in in groups and and what
[49:45] you have to do it a certain way listen
[49:47] that's enticing to Ministries
[49:49] I don't want to be caught up in all that
[49:51] I used to hear my my grandpa used to
[49:53] savor the window years ago he said I
[49:54] will never join a camp
[49:56] well bummer I guess I can't go to a
[49:57] youth camp
[49:59] that's not what he meant
[50:01] he was just talking about it come to a
[50:02] point in time if you're not careful well
[50:04] Satan will try to entice you with
[50:06] certain Ministries that'll say you have
[50:08] to be a part of us or you're not part of
[50:10] anything and I'm not saying that that's
[50:11] in the message but if we're not careful
[50:13] it could be
[50:14] because Satan's trying to draw us from
[50:17] what the last soul
[50:19] if he can get us caught up and and
[50:21] fighting in bickering and so busy and so
[50:23] full of life that we can't get back on
[50:25] our knees and say God I just need a
[50:27] touch from you
[50:29] listen I know you're good people
[50:32] I know you love the Lord but sometimes
[50:34] it just doesn't hurt to say God I just
[50:36] need a little more
[50:38] well I'm just not an emotional person
[50:40] well just let me punch you in the face
[50:42] once we'll find out how emotional you
[50:44] are
[50:47] sometimes we just say God and pray let's
[50:50] just let me be me for a minute
[50:52] brother I know I gotta I gotta come to
[50:54] God and say Lord I just need some more
[50:56] I could preach a sermon it doesn't
[50:58] matter I just need more of you I need my
[51:00] time well I'm a great minister of the
[51:02] Gospel so a donkey helped one time
[51:07] I don't really see that donkey's
[51:10] I don't see if there's any glory for
[51:11] that donkey because God used him to get
[51:14] somebody's attention
[51:15] so what good am I
[51:17] could be no better than a donkey
[51:19] I said God I need a touch from you
[51:22] I need my life so filled and so
[51:24] intertwined in your presence where I'm
[51:27] not enticed by listen I'm not just I'm
[51:29] not talking about worldlyism right now I
[51:31] don't want to be enticed by religious
[51:33] Spirits I don't want to be enticed by
[51:35] coming to the house of God and thinking
[51:37] that because I've preached a sermon or
[51:39] thinking because I've I've sung a song
[51:42] or that I've played music or that I've
[51:43] come here every time that it's enough
[51:45] for me I want to be so convinced that
[51:47] when those Winds of doctrines try to
[51:49] come through and those religious Spirits
[51:51] try to come through it catches my
[51:53] attention and I say God I don't want
[51:55] that in my life
[51:57] I just want another touch from you
[52:01] something has to influence or motivate
[52:03] us
[52:04] there has to be something an internal
[52:06] conviction and it has to be more than a
[52:08] mental conception
[52:10] Hallelujah has to be more than a mental
[52:12] conception
[52:13] because I'm going to tell you you're not
[52:15] convinced by legalism
[52:17] and you're not convinced by emotionalism
[52:19] but it comes back to a back of the
[52:22] desert experience with God to where
[52:24] you're born again and you're done listen
[52:27] were the things of the world and all of
[52:29] life that's trying to drag you what was
[52:31] listen let's just stop for a minute and
[52:33] let's look at what was the pressure of
[52:34] this age because you really look at the
[52:37] pressure of every age and we talked
[52:39] about it they were sauna Sunder you know
[52:40] they were fed to the lions that was the
[52:42] pressures those age but what did Jesus
[52:44] what did he say the pressures of this
[52:46] age was he said it was going to be the
[52:48] age where the word of God would go forth
[52:50] but the cares of this life
[52:53] would squeeze it out of you you could be
[52:56] here tonight you can be at every service
[52:58] but if we're not careful we could allow
[53:00] the cares of life hunger
[53:05] come on Esau hunger
[53:08] simple things that's not a part of the
[53:10] world to squeeze the whole life out of
[53:13] us
[53:14] it's what we've got to watch in this day
[53:18] I need to go back sometimes you got to
[53:20] go back
[53:21] well I'm I'm a message believer I don't
[53:25] need to go back to an Old-Fashioned
[53:26] altar listen I gotta go back
[53:30] I've got to go back to an Old-Fashioned
[53:31] altar sometimes it happens in a service
[53:33] sometimes it happens before service
[53:35] sometimes I walk around the church
[53:37] before a service and I just cry out to
[53:39] God and I go and I lay before him listen
[53:41] you have to do the same thing you have
[53:43] to find your time with God where it's
[53:45] got to be more than just religion listen
[53:47] I know you're a good people but don't
[53:49] let it become just religion it's got to
[53:52] be some life where's the life back up
[53:54] where's the life in your eyes I can see
[53:56] in your eyes and I can see in some of
[53:58] you there's no life I say God give the
[54:01] life back
[54:03] [Applause]
[54:05] because yes trials are here you can't do
[54:07] nothing about it
[54:09] they're here to stay
[54:12] pain is here you can't do nothing about
[54:13] it it's going to be here until we go
[54:16] home
[54:18] hurt is here
[54:19] heard is here it's a big thing in
[54:22] churches
[54:24] hurt people hurt people
[54:28] it's what happens
[54:30] it's talking with someone here the other
[54:31] day and just trying to help him out
[54:33] encourage them a little bit and just
[54:35] talking about a family situation where
[54:37] they thought perhaps someone didn't love
[54:39] them it was a part of the family just
[54:40] because of the difficulty that they were
[54:42] going through at that time and
[54:44] and I was like wait a minute
[54:46] this person would die for you
[54:49] they would give their life for you do
[54:50] you believe that I absolutely believe
[54:52] that then why are you wondering if they
[54:54] love you it's just the way I'm being
[54:55] treated right now just the circumstance
[54:57] of the situation yeah but they would die
[54:59] for you they would give their life for
[55:00] you yes absolutely I said that's the way
[55:02] family is it's kind of a stupid thing
[55:04] forgive me but family will fight for one
[55:06] another love one another we'll we'll put
[55:09] up for one another but they're also the
[55:10] first ones that'll fight one another
[55:12] I know that's none of y'all
[55:16] but it is the truth come on you Brothers
[55:18] you you a brother and you're a brother
[55:21] is your other brother's not here
[55:24] but somewhere along the way y'all
[55:25] probably had a little spat
[55:28] no
[55:29] just a little bit brother Wendell
[55:31] it's a little bit more than a little bit
[55:35] did y'all did y'all hate one another
[55:39] you probably thought it and said it a
[55:41] couple times but you would do whatever
[55:43] you could for one another you would
[55:44] fight for one another
[55:46] but because we're family we're close and
[55:49] it's the first one that will explode on
[55:51] again I know some of y'all are perfect
[55:53] and you never have that problem you
[55:55] husbands and wives are just great but
[55:57] just come to Texas for a moment
[56:00] my church is going to hate me now
[56:03] it's the truth
[56:05] and Satan wants to get among the church
[56:07] a wonderful I didn't have this quote put
[56:10] down but I believe I read it back at
[56:13] brother Jason's where God will allow
[56:15] things to come into a church
[56:18] he will allow sickness
[56:21] you can look it up for yourself
[56:23] he will allow he will allow uh just
[56:26] something to arise he'll allow can I
[56:28] just put it this way spats to happen
[56:34] well I don't want to go to this church
[56:35] anymore it's going to be anywhere you go
[56:39] to see what you will do
[56:41] when troubles arise
[56:44] do you have one another's back
[56:52] just yeah
[56:54] sorry brother Wendell
[56:56] oh this is the next part right here I
[56:58] have yes the pressure is on I'm feeling
[56:59] it now
[57:02] the pressure is on the pressure is here
[57:06] Satan is rising up and he is listen I'm
[57:08] going to tell you he is here and he's
[57:10] trying he's working at the minds of the
[57:12] young people and he's working at the
[57:14] minds of the dads and he's working at
[57:16] the minds of the moms he's working at
[57:18] the minds of the grandparents he's
[57:20] working at every mind that he can and
[57:22] he's trying to attract you and weaken
[57:24] you notice what the Bible said he did
[57:27] weaken the Nations that's his goals to
[57:29] come into a church and to weaken a body
[57:36] when you have a weak immune system your
[57:38] body will catch brother Brandon even
[57:40] said it your body will catch a cold just
[57:41] like that or the weak immune system
[57:44] and what does life do boom boom boom hit
[57:49] after hit problem after problem Satan
[57:52] trying to weaken that immune system and
[57:55] he went begins to weaken that a
[57:57] spiritual immune system there's signs
[58:00] and I don't have them all wrote down but
[58:01] they're signs of of a weak immune system
[58:05] one of the signs of a weak immune system
[58:07] is that you're quick to catch colds
[58:12] okay
[58:13] natural spiritual
[58:17] weak immune system
[58:19] you're quick to catch things another
[58:21] sign of a weak immune system is that uh
[58:24] your wounds don't heal very well
[58:30] if you're spiritually weak your wounds
[58:32] they they kind of they don't heal like
[58:34] they should
[58:37] oh let this oh God help us to let this
[58:40] sink in spiritually it everything is
[58:43] just exploded and everything is exposed
[58:46] where our weak immune system and we lose
[58:49] strength listen what has been going on
[58:52] after this disease
[58:55] I ain't never seen so many people more
[58:57] sick
[58:58] than I ever have before it
[59:01] now however you want to spin it that's
[59:03] fine I'm not here to debate with you
[59:05] about that I just know it's a stupid
[59:07] devil
[59:08] but what it has done is it has weakened
[59:11] the bodies
[59:13] and and people and I'm a vitamin taker
[59:16] like I've never thought I'd be I became
[59:18] the old vitamin taker
[59:21] I didn't know it I didn't come out with
[59:23] a cane
[59:26] hey you've got a long way to never mind
[59:30] I Hallelujah anyhow
[59:33] listen
[59:35] I I was the I'm the vitamin taker why
[59:37] because I don't want none of that junk
[59:39] yeah ain't nobody got time for that
[59:41] and it's like no matter what you try
[59:43] it's there yeah and before you know it
[59:46] this one has it and everyone can
[59:48] sanitize you can come in in a sanitized
[59:51] shower
[59:53] and you'll get it
[59:57] it's the age
[59:58] and I want you to catch that if you see
[1:00:00] it naturally what do you think's happen
[1:00:02] spiritually that's why we've got to be
[1:00:04] prayed up that's why we don't have to
[1:00:06] pray anymore because we've at the
[1:00:07] opening of the word who told you that
[1:00:09] it's a lie
[1:00:11] prayer is not just praying to get out of
[1:00:13] something prayer is a conversation with
[1:00:15] the one that you love
[1:00:18] Hallelujah
[1:00:21] yes the pressure's on many are bowing
[1:00:24] and yes the God of this age is pressing
[1:00:27] but my God who is rich in Mercy
[1:00:29] Ephesians 2 4 but God who is rich in
[1:00:32] Mercy for his great lover with he loved
[1:00:34] us even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:00:36] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:00:39] Grace ye are saved notice and raised us
[1:00:42] up together and made us sit together in
[1:00:45] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you want
[1:00:47] to know how you're going to make it
[1:00:49] through Satan's Eden is by not being a
[1:00:51] part of it because he said he's going to
[1:00:53] raise you and sit you in Heavenly places
[1:00:56] that means listen I'm in this world but
[1:00:58] I'm not of it why because I have been
[1:01:00] raised into a different Realm
[1:01:02] I'm not going to be bothered by
[1:01:04] circumstances anymore circumstances
[1:01:07] can't rule me life can't rule me you say
[1:01:10] I'm starving God knows you
[1:01:13] he knows what you quit trying to fix it
[1:01:15] yourself
[1:01:17] give it to God
[1:01:21] I might be in this world but I'm not of
[1:01:24] it
[1:01:26] I'm going to come to a close now
[1:01:28] the three Hebrew children were so
[1:01:30] convinced
[1:01:31] that they face that fiery furnace not
[1:01:34] only did they face it they walked in
[1:01:36] listen they they did not know fully what
[1:01:39] was going to happen
[1:01:41] it doesn't matter what happens we know
[1:01:43] that we're gods
[1:01:45] Daniel was convinced enough to face the
[1:01:47] Lions Peter was convinced enough to hang
[1:01:49] upside down catch says Stephen was
[1:01:52] convinced enough to pray for his
[1:01:54] executioners as they stoned him
[1:02:00] what did Brother Branham say would enter
[1:02:03] perfect
[1:02:08] hey I appreciate the knowledge that you
[1:02:10] have
[1:02:12] I appreciate the the gifts and I
[1:02:14] appreciate all of the things and the
[1:02:16] missions and
[1:02:19] but if you don't have perfect love
[1:02:23] yes
[1:02:25] what good is everything else
[1:02:27] you see I don't want to be influenced
[1:02:30] by a religious spirit tonight
[1:02:32] I don't want to walk away tonight
[1:02:34] brother Wendell and say hi preached the
[1:02:35] sermon I did my part
[1:02:37] walk away and not worry about anything
[1:02:39] that's not what life's about
[1:02:41] see I learned my lesson as a young
[1:02:43] Minister I used to wonder why after I
[1:02:46] would preach
[1:02:47] get in that anointing
[1:02:49] why after I was done why it would be
[1:02:52] such a hard fall
[1:02:55] maybe none of you ministers ever never
[1:02:56] felt that there's always a drop
[1:02:59] that's just the way it goes we don't
[1:03:01] live in that realm right by the window
[1:03:02] we just don't
[1:03:04] but it shouldn't be God began to deal
[1:03:06] with me it shouldn't be such a hard fall
[1:03:09] from a sermon
[1:03:11] and I begin to realize that was my
[1:03:13] Telltale sign that something was not
[1:03:15] right in my life
[1:03:16] because God would use me because I was
[1:03:18] called into the ministry
[1:03:20] and I happen to be the one brother
[1:03:21] Wendell that God would use that night
[1:03:23] and there would be Miracles and God
[1:03:25] would move in a mighty way and he would
[1:03:26] use me and then after the service I
[1:03:28] would leave and I would hit my bed at
[1:03:30] night and I would have such a my wife
[1:03:32] remembers that I'd have such a hard fall
[1:03:36] and it would almost bring me into a
[1:03:37] depression
[1:03:39] and I thought at first well that that
[1:03:41] just must mean it that that's just what
[1:03:43] the anointing does that's not what it
[1:03:44] was brother Wendell it was because I
[1:03:46] wasn't where I should be
[1:03:49] and so I believe that all of us God
[1:03:52] wants to give if you have the baptism of
[1:03:54] the Holy Spirit there should be warning
[1:03:55] signs in our life
[1:03:57] something that should be a radar
[1:03:59] something you see or you could be those
[1:04:01] that were uh on Pearl Harbor who were so
[1:04:04] caught up with the cares of life that
[1:04:06] when the warning signs were there and
[1:04:07] they seen the blips on the radar that
[1:04:09] they just said it was something else and
[1:04:11] they did not pay attention and many lost
[1:04:13] their lives because they didn't take the
[1:04:15] early warning system
[1:04:17] you see the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:19] not just something that's there to use
[1:04:22] only when you need it but it's also a
[1:04:24] warning system to let you know when
[1:04:26] you're getting a little cold when you
[1:04:28] should when you're not where you should
[1:04:29] be it's not just because you made a good
[1:04:31] religious decision or you made a good
[1:04:33] decision that you thought was a good
[1:04:35] religious thing it's not all about those
[1:04:37] things but it's about God where should I
[1:04:39] be spiritually with you let me just tell
[1:04:41] you anything that God wants you to do
[1:04:43] should never take you away from his
[1:04:45] presence
[1:04:48] and if you listen to that and you're
[1:04:50] away from his presence and it was a
[1:04:52] different spirit that led you there
[1:04:55] and I've been in that condition before I
[1:04:57] know what it's like I speak from
[1:04:59] experience
[1:05:00] that there's got to be an early warning
[1:05:02] system something to let us know I'm cold
[1:05:04] listen I'm at church I made it to church
[1:05:06] I did what I needed to do I preached I
[1:05:08] sung I led songs I played music I played
[1:05:10] the drums and did whatever I needed to
[1:05:11] do but every time I would leave the fall
[1:05:14] would be so hard something was wrong
[1:05:16] somewhere
[1:05:20] but I'm so glad
[1:05:22] that God placed something inside of my
[1:05:25] heart
[1:05:25] that said you you're not going to go
[1:05:28] you see the by his word says he's not
[1:05:30] going to lose a one
[1:05:32] you know some of you know it if you knew
[1:05:34] my life you'd be why in the world is he
[1:05:36] even preaching
[1:05:37] such a horrible person I wouldn't listen
[1:05:39] we're not here to outdo one another's
[1:05:41] sins
[1:05:42] we all could sit here and be the same
[1:05:44] way but we all have done at least
[1:05:46] something that we don't deserve to be in
[1:05:48] the position that we're in now
[1:05:52] so what gives us the right to look at
[1:05:53] one another and say yours is worse or
[1:05:54] mine's worse we've all done something
[1:05:57] that is in need of the grace of God so
[1:06:00] guess what that means we're all in the
[1:06:02] same place right now we're all in Grace
[1:06:04] but God who is rich in Mercy
[1:06:09] can you bow your heads
[1:06:14] don't be influenced by the God of this
[1:06:16] world
[1:06:18] and again I'm not trying to be
[1:06:19] repetitious I'm not talking about you
[1:06:21] being influenced by worldly things
[1:06:23] I'm simply saying religion is not enough
[1:06:29] if it was enough
[1:06:30] then what was the point of the open book
[1:06:34] what was the point of 1963
[1:06:38] what's the point of the upper room
[1:06:40] experience
[1:06:42] when those men that stood before Jesus
[1:06:45] and he said you have your father the
[1:06:46] devil and they brought for him we're all
[1:06:48] aware of Abraham where of this where of
[1:06:49] that they brought him all kinds of
[1:06:51] legalism they brought him all kinds of
[1:06:53] of experience and brought him all kinds
[1:06:55] of letter
[1:06:56] but they didn't have the life
[1:06:59] listen we're message people we believe
[1:07:01] God sent a prophet We Believe
[1:07:04] that we believe in the gifts of the holy
[1:07:06] spirit we believe in the opening of the
[1:07:08] book we believe the word of God revealed
[1:07:12] but where we're sitting right now can we
[1:07:14] all just come to a place right where
[1:07:16] you're at humbly before God
[1:07:19] say Lord do I do I just need
[1:07:23] do I just need a touch from you tonight
[1:07:27] I don't want to be pulled aside by some
[1:07:29] life thing
[1:07:32] listen life's coming at you hard life's
[1:07:34] coming at you fast you've been through
[1:07:36] some struggles and some trials
[1:07:38] I get it
[1:07:40] I get it it's tough It's hard and you're
[1:07:42] you're some of you are just being beat
[1:07:44] and beat and your mind is broken and
[1:07:47] you've been and and you're and you're
[1:07:49] battered and you're scarred I get it I'm
[1:07:53] with you I see them I see your eyes I
[1:07:56] see your I see you that there tonight
[1:08:00] but I want you to know in this simple
[1:08:03] Wednesday night service
[1:08:05] presence of God is here and I'm not just
[1:08:08] trying to work you up to anything
[1:08:11] and I go back to this it seems like
[1:08:12] everywhere I preach for the window I I
[1:08:14] feel as if God says the same thing to me
[1:08:16] to say to you do you trust me
[1:08:22] do you trust me enough to let go of the
[1:08:26] past enough to let go of the future
[1:08:28] enough to let go of life and Trust God's
[1:08:32] plan enough to say Lord I don't care
[1:08:34] what happens I don't care what's going
[1:08:36] on all I want is you right now
[1:08:42] how long has it been since you've been
[1:08:43] behind the veil
[1:08:45] I didn't say you weren't a good person
[1:08:47] see Satan's beating up on your mind I
[1:08:50] didn't say that you listen I didn't say
[1:08:51] you're on your road to hell I just asked
[1:08:54] when was the last time you went behind
[1:08:55] the veil because listen when you get
[1:08:57] behind the veil a lot of things become
[1:08:59] more clear
[1:09:01] a lot of decisions become more clear and
[1:09:04] you get some answers
[1:09:07] I've given you some time to let the Holy
[1:09:08] Spirit now move through this building
[1:09:11] and now I'm gonna just ask a leap of
[1:09:14] faith
[1:09:16] listen I don't want you to come forward
[1:09:18] because I can't do anything for you
[1:09:19] unless you really want me to agree with
[1:09:21] faith with you
[1:09:24] but if you want to just come stand up
[1:09:26] here and you want to say Lord here am I
[1:09:28] just be honest please don't be afraid of
[1:09:29] anyone around you we might be the
[1:09:31] strongest Satan is going to it doesn't
[1:09:33] matter what we are it's Lord I just need
[1:09:36] a touch from you tonight I'm not talking
[1:09:38] about a touch of healing of the natural
[1:09:40] body but I need a spiritual
[1:09:44] why is fear here I rebuke fear in the
[1:09:47] name of Jesus
[1:09:48] fear you're a liar
[1:09:51] I just need a touch from you
[1:09:54] what is that it's a person that loves
[1:09:57] God so much it says God
[1:09:59] surely there's more for me
[1:10:02] surely there's more for me
[1:10:04] I I don't I don't want to be going
[1:10:06] through like this I I don't long for the
[1:10:08] world I'm not Desiring the world I'm not
[1:10:12] Desiring to leave the message I'm not
[1:10:14] Desiring those things not one bit but
[1:10:16] God I just want another touch
[1:10:20] hold me in your arms Lord

[1:10:40] family back bring it back lord
[1:10:43] I don't want to leave this place that
[1:10:45] way anymore
[1:10:46] I'm convinced that this is my life but
[1:10:49] I've gone a little cold maybe there's
[1:10:50] maybe there's some warning signs what
[1:10:52] here am I
