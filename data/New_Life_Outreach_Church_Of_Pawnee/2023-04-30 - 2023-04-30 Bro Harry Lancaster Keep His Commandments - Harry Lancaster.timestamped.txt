[47:14] your hands the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:16] Christ we pray amen
[47:20] all right let's go ahead and turn to
[47:22] First John chapter 5.
[47:39] foreign
[47:48] first John chapter 5 and starting at
[47:50] verse 2.
[47:55] but this we know that we love the
[47:57] children of God when we love God and
[47:59] keep his Commandments
[48:01] for this is the love of God that we keep
[48:04] his Commandments and his Commandments
[48:06] are not Grievous
[48:08] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[48:11] the world and this is the victory that
[48:13] overcometh the world even our faith
[48:17] you may all be seated
[48:29] we're going to go ahead and turn to
[48:30] Matthew chapter 21.
[48:41] and starting it verse 28
[48:49] but what thinking
[48:50] a certain man had two sons and he came
[48:53] to the first and said Son go work today
[48:56] in my Vineyard
[48:58] he answered and said I will not
[49:00] but afterward he repented and went
[49:03] and he came to the second and said
[49:05] likewise and he answered and said I go
[49:08] sir
[49:09] and he went not
[49:11] wither of them Twain did the will of his
[49:13] father
[49:14] they say unto him the first
[49:16] Jesus saith unto them verily I say unto
[49:19] you that the publicans and the harlots
[49:20] go into the kingdom of God before you
[49:23] for John came unto you in the way of
[49:25] righteousness and you believed him not
[49:27] but the publicans and the harlots
[49:29] believed him and ye when ye had seen it
[49:32] repented not afterward
[49:34] that you might believe him
[49:38] so this is
[49:42] a parable that I think we all
[49:44] know we've all heard it many times it
[49:47] was
[49:48] covered in in Sunday school when we were
[49:50] younger and
[49:53] when we first look at it it's not
[49:57] what you would necessarily call
[49:59] um
[50:00] a deep or hard to understand Parable
[50:04] um
[50:05] but it's been something that
[50:07] stayed in my mind and so I started
[50:09] looking at it from from other directions
[50:11] you know here we have the very uh easy
[50:15] look it's here Jesus is talking to the
[50:18] the religious leaders of the day and
[50:22] he's telling this parable of the two
[50:24] sons and he's holding up basically here
[50:27] you have
[50:30] those that said that they were going to
[50:33] do what they
[50:34] what they were asked
[50:36] the religious leaders that yes they say
[50:39] they're going to worship God they say
[50:40] they're going to do this and do that
[50:44] but yet they don't go forward
[50:47] and then you have those that they refuse
[50:49] to begin with
[50:51] but then through the preaching of John
[50:53] these Republicans and these Sinners
[50:55] begin to repent and begin to come back
[50:57] and begin to live like they were
[50:59] supposed to and so it was a
[51:02] Jesus was looking at the religious
[51:04] leaders
[51:06] and calling them out for the way that
[51:08] they were acting
[51:10] and
[51:13] it's interesting to look at it because
[51:15] as he's speaking to these religious
[51:18] leaders
[51:19] you know to to be a part of the
[51:21] priesthood they had to know their
[51:23] scriptures forward and backwards they
[51:26] knew every single thing there and so
[51:29] they knew what was said in in
[51:32] Deuteronomy about
[51:34] the stubborn and rebellious son in
[51:37] Deuteronomy chapter 21 and starting at
[51:39] Verse 18 it says if a man have a
[51:41] stubborn and rebellious son which will
[51:43] not obey the voice of his father or the
[51:45] voice of his mother and that when they
[51:47] have chastened him will not hearken unto
[51:49] them then shall his father and mother
[51:51] lay hold on him and bring him out unto
[51:53] the Elders of his City and unto the Gate
[51:55] of his place and they shall say unto the
[51:57] Elders of a city this is our son is
[52:00] stubborn and rebellious he will not obey
[52:02] our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard
[52:04] and all the men of his City shall Stone
[52:07] him with stones that he die so shalt
[52:09] thou put away evil from among you and
[52:11] all Israel shall hear and fear
[52:15] now I have a hard time imagining a
[52:18] parent actually doing this I have a hard
[52:20] time imagining that this was a common
[52:23] place happening even when they had
[52:26] children that were being rebellious it's
[52:28] difficult to imagine that they were
[52:30] going so far the parents are like all
[52:31] right we're taking you to be stoned it's
[52:33] over
[52:34] but yet as Jesus is talking to these
[52:37] religious leaders they know that this is
[52:39] the scripture here and so as he's giving
[52:41] this Parable and he's talking about
[52:45] first you have this oldest that starts
[52:48] off by saying no I'm not going to go
[52:52] and so
[52:54] you know when when you look at at Israel
[52:57] Israel was a patriarchal society
[53:01] um and the children were expected to
[53:03] follow in the footsteps of their father
[53:06] um
[53:08] you can go through the scriptures and
[53:09] find Eli's Sons followed him into the
[53:11] priesthood
[53:12] Samuel's Sons were appointed judges over
[53:15] Israel
[53:16] Peter and Andrew learned fishing from
[53:18] their father the same as James and John
[53:20] learned fishing from their father
[53:22] John the Baptist was expected to follow
[53:24] in the footsteps as his father as a
[53:26] priest before his calling Into the
[53:28] Wilderness
[53:29] um
[53:30] and so
[53:33] if you've just stepped back and look and
[53:36] think about the story for a moment think
[53:38] about it as it's going here this father
[53:40] comes and he's got his his sons that
[53:43] he's been training that he's been
[53:44] teaching and
[53:46] Jesus doesn't go into details about the
[53:48] family maybe it was more of a poor
[53:50] family and so the father was doing all
[53:52] the instructing on his own just the
[53:54] father and mother teaching the children
[53:55] maybe it was a family that they had more
[53:58] money and so he had you know his brother
[54:00] Branham talked about having them put
[54:01] under tutors that would teach for a
[54:03] while and train them and get them ready
[54:05] to to take on the the father's business
[54:08] and Father's responsibility and so
[54:10] finally we come to this point where the
[54:13] father is coming into a place to test
[54:16] them
[54:17] he's coming into the point
[54:19] to invite them into the family business
[54:22] to invite them to take part
[54:26] you know this Parable he talks about it
[54:27] being the vineyard so this family had a
[54:30] Vineyard this was how he supported the
[54:33] family this was how the father made the
[54:35] money that would buy the food that would
[54:37] clothe them that would take care of them
[54:40] the way the family worked that would
[54:41] take care of the elderly that was in his
[54:43] family maybe his parents couldn't work
[54:45] anymore and so the vineyard was how he
[54:47] provided for them maybe there were still
[54:49] other younger children that was how he
[54:51] provided for them everything was wrapped
[54:53] around this family business and so the
[54:57] father is now inviting his children to
[55:00] come in
[55:01] and begin to take their place
[55:04] helping to provide
[55:06] and so he goes to his oldest
[55:11] the firstborn
[55:13] the sun with the most pressure and the
[55:16] most responsibility upon him
[55:18] the firstborn was the one that the most
[55:20] was expected of him I mean the fact that
[55:23] they were both sons they both had
[55:24] expectations but that oldest was always
[55:27] the one that was looked on as
[55:29] this is the one that's going to take
[55:31] over everything
[55:32] this is the one that when the father
[55:33] dies he's going to take on the mantle of
[55:36] taking care of the entire family he's
[55:38] the one that's going to take on this
[55:40] responsibility
[55:41] of protection a provision and so he
[55:44] comes to his oldest
[55:46] and he says son go work in my Vineyard
[55:52] and his son looks at him and goes
[55:55] no
[55:57] I don't feel like it today
[55:59] I don't want to
[56:02] you can think about how this
[56:04] conversation went maybe it was a very
[56:05] simple statement
[56:08] maybe it can be dramatized more to where
[56:10] this son goes on a rant I hate the
[56:12] vineyard I hate that we're always out
[56:15] there I want to go fishing I want to go
[56:17] do this I want to go do that
[56:20] but the father comes and he asks his son
[56:23] to come do the work
[56:26] and his son says no
[56:31] and can you just imagine the father as
[56:33] he's looking at his eldest the one who
[56:35] he's expecting to take on everything
[56:39] and just that look of disappointment
[56:41] that comes on his face
[56:44] Jesus doesn't tell us that the father
[56:46] went into a lecture that he went in to
[56:48] let me tell you how you're wrong or let
[56:51] me berate you or let me yell at you
[56:55] but knowing
[56:58] how parents work
[57:03] even though he didn't say a word just
[57:05] that look of disappointment
[57:07] and just think of the Father's Heart
[57:11] as his son looks at him tells him no
[57:14] and just that disappointment
[57:17] in his heart going
[57:19] I thought he would be better
[57:21] thought
[57:23] he would step up more I thought that I
[57:25] could trust him at this point that's why
[57:27] I came to ask him to come work in the
[57:29] vineyard I thought he was ready
[57:34] and so he then goes on
[57:37] to the next one
[57:40] he goes on to his second son and he says
[57:42] the exact same thing son
[57:44] go work in the vineyard
[57:47] and the second son says I will go sir
[57:50] he's you know he's absolutely let me
[57:53] step up let me do it he's being polite
[57:56] he's calling him sir he's being
[57:57] respectful he's doing all the things
[57:59] he's supposed to and you can see the
[58:01] father walk away from that conversation
[58:03] like okay
[58:05] I've got one son that's that's where
[58:08] he's supposed to be that's starting to
[58:09] do the things that I want to
[58:13] but the story doesn't stop there it
[58:14] keeps going because this second son that
[58:16] was so quick to say I will go sir
[58:20] gets distracted
[58:22] or he gets busy
[58:24] or he gets lazy or he gets
[58:28] take your pick the
[58:30] Jesus didn't go into details on exactly
[58:32] why he doesn't go he just says but he
[58:35] didn't go
[58:38] and so we're taking this into more of a
[58:41] real story for a moment it's like
[58:43] if I went to my children
[58:46] and so I'm talking to Paul
[58:48] and he says I will go
[58:51] but then he gets distracted because he
[58:54] wants to build this really cool castle
[58:55] with his Legos and he's like I'll go
[58:57] once this is done
[58:59] but then his little brother comes in and
[59:02] breaks the castle and so he's got to
[59:04] rebuild it and he's going through this
[59:06] whole thing
[59:07] and he had the best of intentions to go
[59:11] but he got wrapped up
[59:12] in some other concerns he got wrapped up
[59:15] in some other cares he got wrapped up
[59:18] in other things that were going on
[59:21] and so it wasn't necessarily that he had
[59:23] bad intentions he didn't necessarily go
[59:25] into it with well I'm going to lie to my
[59:27] father and tell him that I that I'll go
[59:29] but I really not
[59:31] but things around him kept him from
[59:34] doing it
[59:37] but then the eldest son the son that
[59:40] had said point blank to his dad no
[59:44] that it looked him straight in the eye
[59:46] and gone no I'm not gonna go
[59:50] the scriptures say he repented
[59:54] and so we started thinking about it and
[59:56] maybe he was thinking about that look of
[59:58] disappointment that he'd seen flash over
[1:00:00] his father's face and
[1:00:02] maybe he was thinking about some of the
[1:00:04] things that he had studied in Bible
[1:00:06] school or some of the things that he'd
[1:00:08] heard in Sunday school or
[1:00:10] the last sermon the rabbi had preached
[1:00:12] or
[1:00:13] but it said he repented
[1:00:16] and he went
[1:00:18] into the vineyard was like all right
[1:00:19] I'll put in the day's work
[1:00:21] I'll do what I was asked to do even
[1:00:23] though I said no even though I said I
[1:00:26] wouldn't do it
[1:00:28] I'm going to step in and I'm going to do
[1:00:30] the work
[1:00:35] Charles Spurgeon wrote and said the
[1:00:36] second son said I go sir but he went not
[1:00:39] and these people do not go
[1:00:42] they talk of repenting but they do not
[1:00:44] repent
[1:00:45] they speak of believing but they never
[1:00:46] believe
[1:00:48] they think of submitting to God but they
[1:00:50] have not submitted themselves to him yet
[1:00:52] they say it is time they broke up the
[1:00:55] fallow ground and sought the Lord but
[1:00:57] they do not seek Him it all ends in a
[1:01:00] mere promise
[1:01:05] it's very easy for us
[1:01:07] as Christians to go and be like hey I've
[1:01:11] said that I will go work
[1:01:13] I'm I'm here at church I'm attending
[1:01:16] service I'm
[1:01:18] I've accepted Christ as my savior I'm
[1:01:20] here
[1:01:24] it's easy for us to say yes I've I've
[1:01:26] told God yes I've told him I will do the
[1:01:28] work I will go out on the vineyard I
[1:01:30] will do my part
[1:01:32] but then yet when Christ comes and
[1:01:33] begins to call you to do something
[1:01:35] specific
[1:01:36] begins to tell you to to do certain
[1:01:39] things
[1:01:41] how easily we become distracted how
[1:01:43] easily we've become focused on other
[1:01:45] things that are going around other
[1:01:47] things that are happening in our lives
[1:01:49] and sometimes there what could be
[1:01:52] classified as important things
[1:01:54] and sometimes it's the castle of Legos
[1:01:59] sometimes it's something like man I've
[1:02:01] got to go to work I've got to provide
[1:02:03] for my family I've got to make you know
[1:02:05] I've got to put in a little bit extra
[1:02:06] overtime to make sure that we pay this
[1:02:08] bill or cover this expense or do this or
[1:02:11] do that
[1:02:12] sometimes it can be what we could
[1:02:13] classify as important
[1:02:16] and sometimes it can be well you know
[1:02:18] it's the season the fish are biting so
[1:02:19] I've got to be out at the lake
[1:02:24] Deuteronomy chapter 11 and verse 1.
[1:02:28] it says therefore Thou shalt love the
[1:02:30] Lord thy God and keep his charge and his
[1:02:33] statutes and his judgments and his
[1:02:37] Commandments
[1:02:38] always
[1:02:40] in Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and verse 13.
[1:02:45] it says let us hear the conclusion of
[1:02:47] the whole matter
[1:02:49] fear God and keep his Commandments
[1:02:52] for this is the whole duty of man
[1:02:57] throughout the scriptures God gives us
[1:02:59] instruction for our lives
[1:03:02] he
[1:03:04] instructs his children about their
[1:03:06] inheritance he tells us about the
[1:03:09] quality of the land he tells us how to
[1:03:12] prosper
[1:03:13] and he tells us the borders that have
[1:03:15] been established for our protection
[1:03:18] the boundary of our land don't cross it
[1:03:20] because you have no claim to what's on
[1:03:22] the other side this is your land this is
[1:03:24] your promise this is the family business
[1:03:27] I want to invite you into
[1:03:29] I'm not inviting you to go work on that
[1:03:31] property
[1:03:32] it may look better maybe it looks
[1:03:35] greener it looks nicer but that's not
[1:03:37] where I'm asking you to work because
[1:03:38] it's not ours
[1:03:40] you don't get the blessings from over
[1:03:42] there you get the blessings from staying
[1:03:43] in these boundaries and staying Within
[1:03:46] These guidelines
[1:03:50] in Genesis chapter 22
[1:03:55] we have the story of
[1:03:57] Abraham going to
[1:03:59] sacrifice his son
[1:04:05] and we're not going to go ahead and read
[1:04:07] through the whole story but he goes and
[1:04:10] he just tells his wife
[1:04:12] we're going to sacrifice
[1:04:14] he's not going to tell her God told me
[1:04:17] to sacrifice the boy
[1:04:18] but they go
[1:04:21] he tells the men that have traveled with
[1:04:24] him
[1:04:24] the boy and I will go Yonder
[1:04:27] and the boy and I will return
[1:04:30] he goes up onto the mountain he
[1:04:33] his son is asking him questions
[1:04:36] as all of us parents know our children
[1:04:37] do all the time
[1:04:39] and sometimes there are questions that
[1:04:41] we really don't want to answer at the
[1:04:42] moment there are things we don't want to
[1:04:45] go into
[1:04:47] and so Isaac's asking where's the
[1:04:50] sacrifice
[1:04:52] and so Abraham
[1:04:55] tells him but doesn't tell him
[1:04:57] says God will provide the sacrifice
[1:05:00] he doesn't tell him you're the sacrifice
[1:05:03] he just says God will provide
[1:05:06] so they go up they construct the altar
[1:05:08] they go through everything
[1:05:10] he binds his son puts him onto the altar
[1:05:13] raises the knife
[1:05:16] and then the angel of the Lord appears
[1:05:18] and tells them all right now
[1:05:21] now I know
[1:05:23] and in verse 18 of Genesis 22
[1:05:28] the angel speaking to him says and in
[1:05:30] thy Siege shall all the nations of the
[1:05:32] earth be blessed
[1:05:33] because thou Hast obeyed my voice
[1:05:37] obedience brings about blessing
[1:05:41] keeping the Commandments of the Lord
[1:05:43] brings about blessing in our life
[1:05:48] when we're called
[1:05:50] we have the option to be like either of
[1:05:52] those Sons
[1:05:53] and we have the option to repent if we
[1:05:56] started off wrong like the oldest son if
[1:05:58] we went and we said no I'm not doing
[1:06:01] that
[1:06:03] we have the opportunity to repent we
[1:06:05] have the opportunity to go and do the
[1:06:06] work that we've been called to abide by
[1:06:09] The Commandments that we've been given
[1:06:13] in the sermon expectation
[1:06:16] brother Branham says is speaking and
[1:06:18] says God said separate yourself from
[1:06:20] your kindred
[1:06:22] that's what you have to do a lot of
[1:06:23] times separate yourself from a lot of
[1:06:26] unbelief and remember until Abraham
[1:06:28] fully obeyed God the blessing never come
[1:06:31] until he fully obeyed God he took his
[1:06:34] daddy along and he caused trouble and
[1:06:36] then lot finally caused trouble and a
[1:06:38] herdsman and then as soon as he got
[1:06:40] separated from everything like God had
[1:06:43] told him he fully obeyed when he come to
[1:06:46] full obedience then God brought the
[1:06:49] blessing
[1:06:51] in the token brother Branham says when
[1:06:53] you fully obey the word of God in full
[1:06:56] surrender to it you're entitled to the
[1:06:58] Token yes sir obedience not he that
[1:07:01] saith Lord Lord but he that doeth the
[1:07:04] will and when we pray we must have the
[1:07:06] token present with our prayer
[1:07:11] and in the sermon influence he says I am
[1:07:15] your brother but he said the works that
[1:07:17] I do shall you do also is that what he
[1:07:19] said all right if he is here his spirit
[1:07:22] is here that was what makes him then if
[1:07:24] we can surrender ourselves and get our
[1:07:26] own thoughts away
[1:07:28] just like this has no thoughts that
[1:07:30] another voice can speak through it
[1:07:31] that's the way if we can empty ourselves
[1:07:33] out there is the secret get rid of
[1:07:36] yourself
[1:07:38] get rid of your own thinking get rid of
[1:07:40] your own ways then let God move
[1:07:44] if he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:07:46] today and forever you believe it you
[1:07:48] believe him right now and see if it is
[1:07:54] and finally in the sermon the the
[1:07:56] conflict between God and Satan
[1:07:59] the word of God there's no way around
[1:08:01] fortified all the way around everywhere
[1:08:03] thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord
[1:08:06] you're walking you're talking your
[1:08:08] business you're associating and
[1:08:10] everything put the word of God first say
[1:08:13] I believe I'll go tonight and this
[1:08:16] little dance just won't hurt anybody
[1:08:17] could you take thus saith the Lord with
[1:08:19] you
[1:08:20] see
[1:08:21] I believe if I could pull this little
[1:08:23] deal oh it's just a bit Shady but could
[1:08:25] you say thus saith the Lord with it
[1:08:28] always take him first keep fortified for
[1:08:31] he is our Fortress it's strain but do
[1:08:33] you know you have to before you have to
[1:08:36] ignore in order to believe the devil's
[1:08:38] lie you have to ignore and deny God's
[1:08:40] truth first before you can believe the
[1:08:43] devil's lie you ever think of that you
[1:08:45] have to deny the truth first before you
[1:08:48] could believe a lie right you have to
[1:08:50] deny it
[1:08:52] and so this Parable is on the one hand
[1:08:56] super simple
[1:08:57] very easy to look at very good this is
[1:08:59] specifically who Jesus was talking about
[1:09:02] but I'm not one that goes in lows okay I
[1:09:04] think the only reason God put this in
[1:09:07] the scripture was to apply to something
[1:09:09] that happened thousands of years ago and
[1:09:11] it has basically no Up application or a
[1:09:13] life anymore
[1:09:14] it's not the way the Bible works
[1:09:17] and so this Parable was just bouncing
[1:09:20] around in my head and just
[1:09:22] couldn't seem to get away from thinking
[1:09:23] about it
[1:09:26] and we as Christians we have the
[1:09:29] opportunity where God calls us to live
[1:09:31] the certain way to abide by his
[1:09:35] Commandments to abide by his guidelines
[1:09:38] and we stand there
[1:09:41] and both of these are Sons
[1:09:44] both of these are his children
[1:09:46] it doesn't say that one was a servant
[1:09:49] they're both his sons
[1:09:53] and
[1:09:54] when God comes and he calls us to do
[1:09:57] something he reveals something out of
[1:09:59] his scriptures he reveals something
[1:10:01] maybe we haven't heard this one before
[1:10:02] we haven't seen that before we all know
[1:10:05] how you can take one verse and read it
[1:10:07] over and over and over and then based on
[1:10:09] what you're going through in life you'll
[1:10:11] pick up something a little different out
[1:10:13] of it
[1:10:14] because it applies a little differently
[1:10:16] to what you're going through versus what
[1:10:18] I used to go through
[1:10:19] you know as an 18 year old there were
[1:10:21] only so much many things I would get out
[1:10:23] of this
[1:10:24] then I became a husband
[1:10:27] then I became a father
[1:10:30] then I somehow became a minister then I
[1:10:34] somehow became a deacon and these
[1:10:36] different things where suddenly I'm in a
[1:10:37] different place in life and there are
[1:10:39] things in the scriptures that stand out
[1:10:41] to me now that as an 18 year old kid
[1:10:43] didn't stand out
[1:10:44] I still read the exact same Bible
[1:10:48] and it didn't change what was in there
[1:10:51] God hasn't suddenly input new chapters
[1:10:54] in the book
[1:10:55] there's nothing new in here it's the
[1:10:57] same as what was but the way I see it
[1:11:00] has changed
[1:11:02] because of where I'm at
[1:11:06] and so something new will pop out in the
[1:11:09] scriptures
[1:11:10] because of where we're at in life of
[1:11:12] what we're going through or because
[1:11:13] God's giving us a little more revelation
[1:11:18] and we then have that opportunity to
[1:11:20] stand there and go okay am I going to
[1:11:22] accept this
[1:11:24] am I going to take the word that I'm
[1:11:26] being given am I going to take the
[1:11:28] instruction that I'm being shown
[1:11:31] or am I going to say no
[1:11:35] and then even beyond that the first
[1:11:37] reaction it's easy as we're sitting here
[1:11:40] in church
[1:11:41] to be yelling amen and shouting preach
[1:11:45] it and yes that's exactly the truth and
[1:11:48] then walk out the doors and go
[1:11:50] can I really live that
[1:11:52] can I really do that
[1:11:54] or am I going to allow myself to be
[1:11:56] distracted by everything else that's
[1:11:57] going around
[1:11:59] it's easy to be in this environment and
[1:12:03] saying yes Lord I'll go yes I'm going to
[1:12:06] change that about my life yes I'm going
[1:12:09] to throw this to the side or I'm going
[1:12:10] to do that and then walk out those doors
[1:12:13] and go back into our house
[1:12:15] where there's no one else around us
[1:12:19] and become distracted
[1:12:22] or go you know maybe it really wasn't
[1:12:24] that important maybe it's not that big a
[1:12:26] deal
[1:12:28] and be like the second son that so
[1:12:31] quickly was like yes sir I will go
[1:12:36] but then didn't
[1:12:40] Jesus says he's telling this Parable was
[1:12:42] pointing out that the actions matter
[1:12:44] more
[1:12:47] he asked them he asked the the leaders
[1:12:50] of that day is like which one did the
[1:12:52] will of the father
[1:12:54] and they said the first the one who had
[1:12:57] the bad attitude to start
[1:13:00] the one who was sitting in church with
[1:13:02] their arms folded across their chest
[1:13:04] going I don't want to hear that I have
[1:13:06] zero desire to listen to that
[1:13:10] but then yet when they walked out
[1:13:13] I love that this word is used in the
[1:13:15] scripture says he repented
[1:13:19] meaning that he went and was like all
[1:13:21] right I'm going to turn around and go
[1:13:24] the opposite direction of the way I was
[1:13:25] going
[1:13:27] he had made the choice to walk against
[1:13:29] the father's teaching he had made the
[1:13:31] choice because father wants me to go
[1:13:33] that way I'm going to be like Jonah and
[1:13:34] I'm going this direction
[1:13:37] but then he hit the point the scripture
[1:13:39] says he repented
[1:13:41] and so he turned back around
[1:13:43] and it went the opposite direction of
[1:13:45] the way he was going he was like I will
[1:13:47] go and I will work in the vineyard I
[1:13:49] will do what my father asked me what my
[1:13:52] father commanded me
[1:13:53] because that's what I'm called for
[1:13:56] because
[1:13:57] I am the eldest son this is my role this
[1:14:00] is my position this is where God has
[1:14:03] placed me
[1:14:05] and this is what's expected of me
[1:14:10] it's easy
[1:14:12] in the church as we're sitting here and
[1:14:14] everyone else around us is amening and
[1:14:16] we're all happy and we're all smiling
[1:14:18] it's easy to say yes
[1:14:23] it's not easy for it to stay a yes as we
[1:14:27] walk out the doors
[1:14:29] because then we go back into the
[1:14:32] environment that had caused the problem
[1:14:33] to begin with
[1:14:35] we go back around those influences we go
[1:14:39] back whether it's at work whether it's
[1:14:42] things in our home whether it's
[1:14:44] friendships whether it's whatever
[1:14:48] but it's easy to say yes here
[1:14:51] but Jesus was pointing out that the one
[1:14:54] that was in the church
[1:14:57] that had the bad attitude that showed
[1:15:00] the disrespect and everything else
[1:15:02] was actually the one that did it right
[1:15:04] in the end
[1:15:07] so just because we're sitting here in
[1:15:09] church and we look around and we're like
[1:15:10] boy they're praising they've got their
[1:15:13] hands up all as well
[1:15:16] and then we look at other people in
[1:15:18] church go
[1:15:19] well
[1:15:20] they're not getting anything out of this
[1:15:21] boy look at that scowl on their face
[1:15:24] and we're caught ourselves judging them
[1:15:28] we could be watching one of these
[1:15:30] Parables happen
[1:15:32] where maybe they didn't receive it with
[1:15:34] the best attitude maybe they didn't take
[1:15:37] the instruction the way that they should
[1:15:38] have
[1:15:41] but they ended up repenting
[1:15:44] and turning around and going back the
[1:15:46] way they were supposed to
[1:15:52] Matthew Chapter 7
[1:15:55] and verse 21 we have a another Parable
[1:15:58] that
[1:15:59] Jesus talks about
[1:16:03] of those that are building the houses
[1:16:09] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[1:16:10] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:16:12] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[1:16:14] Father which is in heaven
[1:16:16] many will say to me in that day Lord
[1:16:18] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:16:21] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:16:24] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:16:26] and then will I profess unto them I
[1:16:30] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:16:33] work iniquity
[1:16:34] therefore whosoever heareth these
[1:16:37] sayings of mine and doeth them
[1:16:40] I will liken him unto a wise man which
[1:16:42] built his house upon a rock
[1:16:44] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:16:46] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:16:48] that house and it fell not for it was
[1:16:50] founded upon a rock
[1:16:52] and everyone that heareth these sayings
[1:16:54] of mine and doeth them not shall be
[1:16:55] likened unto a foolish man which built
[1:16:58] his house upon the sand
[1:17:00] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:17:02] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:17:04] that house and it fell
[1:17:06] and great was the fall of it
[1:17:10] he says very clearly
[1:17:13] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[1:17:17] whoever hears my Commandments
[1:17:20] whoever hears what I've said and does
[1:17:23] them
[1:17:25] not just responds well in the midst of
[1:17:28] the service not just puts on a good show
[1:17:31] but the one who actually hears the
[1:17:33] instruction and goes and does it he will
[1:17:36] be the wise man
[1:17:38] we're the one that hears it
[1:17:41] and doesn't do it
[1:17:43] maybe they were able to put on the great
[1:17:45] face maybe they were able to celebrate
[1:17:47] maybe they were able to dance maybe they
[1:17:49] were able to do all these things then on
[1:17:51] the outward looks so good but they don't
[1:17:54] actually do it
[1:17:56] they will be like the foolish man
[1:17:58] that built upon the sand that will
[1:18:00] crumble and will fall
[1:18:05] Second Chronicles chapter 7 and verse
[1:18:07] 14.
[1:18:09] I've heard this scripture quoted so many
[1:18:12] times by people out in the world even on
[1:18:14] saying if my people which are called by
[1:18:16] my name shall humble themselves and pray
[1:18:19] and seek my face and turn from their
[1:18:22] Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven
[1:18:24] and will forgive their sin and we'll
[1:18:26] hear their land
[1:18:29] thing is out in the world everybody's
[1:18:30] real quick to go here we'll seek his
[1:18:32] face
[1:18:34] maybe we'll even humble ourselves
[1:18:38] but the Turning from the wicked way is a
[1:18:40] little bit much
[1:18:42] but God gives us the formula says very
[1:18:44] clearly if you do these things
[1:18:49] then I will hear from heaven
[1:18:53] and I'm not real concerned about the
[1:18:55] entire land first I'm going selfishly
[1:18:57] what about me I need you to take care of
[1:19:00] me first
[1:19:02] then we'll see how the rest of it goes
[1:19:04] we'll see how everything else but I have
[1:19:06] to make sure I'm right first
[1:19:09] and so I have to humble myself I have to
[1:19:12] seek his face I have to follow his
[1:19:15] Commandments
[1:19:19] and then he will forgive their sin
[1:19:22] and heal their land
[1:19:26] Luke chapter 11 and verse 28
[1:19:32] but he said yay
[1:19:34] rather blessed are they that hear the
[1:19:36] word of God
[1:19:38] and keep it
[1:19:40] John chapter 14 and verse 15 it says
[1:19:44] if you love me
[1:19:46] keep my Commandments
[1:19:49] Romans chapter 12 starting at verse 1.
[1:19:54] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[1:19:56] mercies of God that you present your
[1:19:57] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:20:00] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:20:01] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:20:04] to this world but be transformed by the
[1:20:06] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:20:09] who is that good and acceptable and
[1:20:11] perfect will of God
[1:20:15] blessed are they that hear the word of
[1:20:16] God and keep it
[1:20:18] if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:20:22] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:20:24] holy and acceptable unto God
[1:20:29] well if it's holy and acceptable unto
[1:20:30] God then you have to be hearing the word
[1:20:33] and keeping it you have to be keeping
[1:20:36] the Commandments
[1:20:38] that's the only way it's going to be
[1:20:39] holy and acceptable
[1:20:45] Psalms 84.
[1:20:47] and verse 11.
[1:20:51] for the Lord God as a son and shield
[1:20:54] the Lord will give Grace and Glory no
[1:20:57] good thing will he withhold from them
[1:20:59] that walk uprightly
[1:21:01] O Lord of hosts blessed is the man that
[1:21:04] trusteth in thee
[1:21:08] no good thing will he uphold
[1:21:13] from those that walk uprightly
[1:21:16] blessed is the man that trusteth in thee
[1:21:22] throughout the scriptures God keeps
[1:21:24] telling us over and over and over keep
[1:21:28] my Commandments
[1:21:30] do
[1:21:31] what I'm telling you
[1:21:34] it's the father that continues to
[1:21:36] instruct his sons continues to tell them
[1:21:38] continues to
[1:21:41] help them develop so that he can then
[1:21:43] call them into the family business
[1:21:47] God's trying to teach us he's trying to
[1:21:50] school us he's trying to show us where
[1:21:53] we're supposed to live how we're
[1:21:54] supposed to live
[1:21:56] so that we can then be that trustworthy
[1:21:59] son that
[1:22:00] has the ring and his signature is as
[1:22:03] good as the fathers on every single
[1:22:05] check that he writes because he's proven
[1:22:07] himself to be trustworthy he's proven
[1:22:08] himself to be acceptable he's proven
[1:22:10] himself to be thinking and making
[1:22:13] decisions the same way the father would
[1:22:16] the father doesn't have to wonder is he
[1:22:18] going to go off on some Bender drinking
[1:22:21] and wasting all his money
[1:22:23] he knows the Sun is going to go out
[1:22:26] and maybe he's going to look at the
[1:22:28] business deal and go
[1:22:29] you know I think I should invest in this
[1:22:31] versus that great
[1:22:34] has a little bit different look at
[1:22:35] things that way
[1:22:37] but he's not going I'm going to waste
[1:22:39] all my money I'm going to live sinfly
[1:22:40] I'm going to do this he's still making
[1:22:42] the decisions based on how am I going to
[1:22:45] take care of the family
[1:22:47] how am I going to take care of the
[1:22:50] elderly in my family how am I going to
[1:22:51] take care of the young ones in my family
[1:22:53] how
[1:22:54] because he's now The Trusted son
[1:22:56] that his father can trust him to make
[1:22:58] those decisions because he's been doing
[1:23:01] what he was instructed
[1:23:04] he's been proving himself over and over
[1:23:10] Branham says in the sermon the comforter
[1:23:12] he says don't you never forget
[1:23:15] the Comfort the stream of all my comfort
[1:23:17] the stream of my comfort tonight is I
[1:23:20] know that God keeps his word
[1:23:22] I know that something happened to me I
[1:23:24] know that I've passed from Death unto
[1:23:26] life I know that I keep his Commandments
[1:23:28] if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:23:31] he said if you love me do what I tell
[1:23:33] you to do let every man's word be a lie
[1:23:36] let mine be true
[1:23:38] don't follow what man said follow what
[1:23:40] God Said and there you find the
[1:23:42] comforter and the Comfort brings you the
[1:23:45] satisfaction of knowing it's thus saith
[1:23:48] the Lord
[1:23:56] laughs
[1:23:59] foreign
[1:24:02] he says in the sermon respects he says
[1:24:04] over in Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter
[1:24:06] and the 13th verse it's written like
[1:24:08] this see let us hear the conclusion of
[1:24:11] the whole matter
[1:24:12] fear God and keep his Commandments for
[1:24:14] this is the full duty of man
[1:24:16] the conclusion of the whole matter is to
[1:24:18] fear God
[1:24:20] and when you cannot have respects until
[1:24:21] you have fear you've got to have fear of
[1:24:24] God Solomon said so also in the Proverbs
[1:24:26] that the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:24:28] wisdom
[1:24:29] now that don't mean that you're afraid
[1:24:30] of him but it means that you're giving
[1:24:32] him respect and reverence and when you
[1:24:35] respect God you fear God you fear that
[1:24:37] you might displease him in some way you
[1:24:40] fear lest you would do something wrong
[1:24:41] you wouldn't want to
[1:24:43] I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear
[1:24:47] my church I fear all of God's servants
[1:24:50] unless I should put a stumbling block
[1:24:51] somewhere in their way
[1:24:53] I fear the people I fear the people of
[1:24:55] the city unless I should do something
[1:24:57] wrong that would cause them to think
[1:24:58] that I wasn't a Christian
[1:25:00] see you've got before you can have
[1:25:03] respects you've got to have fear and God
[1:25:05] demands it he demands respects God does
[1:25:07] he demands it and fear brings it we know
[1:25:10] that fear brings respects
[1:25:13] Proverbs chapter 9 and verse 10 which is
[1:25:15] what brother Brandon was referencing
[1:25:17] says the fear of the Lord is the
[1:25:19] beginning of wisdom
[1:25:20] and the knowledge of the Holy is
[1:25:23] understanding
[1:25:33] in the Ephesians Church age book
[1:25:36] a few moments ago I mentioned that John
[1:25:39] understood what it was to love God
[1:25:41] that great Apostle of Love would
[1:25:43] certainly see it when the church began
[1:25:45] to lose the first love of God
[1:25:47] in first John 5 3 he says for this is
[1:25:50] the love of God that we keep his
[1:25:52] Commandments his word
[1:25:54] one little deviation from that word was
[1:25:56] a step away from Christ
[1:25:58] people say they love God they go to
[1:26:00] church they even shout and rejoice and
[1:26:02] sing and have a great emotional time but
[1:26:05] when it's all over watch and see if they
[1:26:07] are in that word walking in it living in
[1:26:10] it
[1:26:11] if they go through all the other and
[1:26:13] they don't walk in that word they can
[1:26:15] say they love God but their lives tell
[1:26:17] another story
[1:26:19] I wonder if John didn't see a lot of
[1:26:21] that before he died people saying they
[1:26:23] loved God but not obeying his word
[1:26:33] and in the sermon how can I overcome
[1:26:39] and there is a third dispensation now
[1:26:41] like Noah's time lot's time and now this
[1:26:43] time there is an ark now and that Ark is
[1:26:46] not a denomination neither it is is it
[1:26:48] good works that you do it's by one
[1:26:51] Spirit Romans 8 1 we are all baptized
[1:26:54] into one body in the domain of that
[1:26:56] Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter
[1:26:59] how good how bad whatever you're in that
[1:27:01] Kingdom by Holy Ghost baptism see that's
[1:27:04] the only way you overcome
[1:27:06] it's all that is under the shed blood is
[1:27:08] Overcomers because you cannot overcome
[1:27:10] yourself it's he that overcomes for you
[1:27:12] you're resting
[1:27:13] How will I know then brother Branham
[1:27:15] that I'm in there
[1:27:16] watch what kind of life you're living
[1:27:18] just look around see if it's just lived
[1:27:20] out of you automatically or do you have
[1:27:23] to strain and pull see then you're doing
[1:27:26] it but don't try to do it did you ever
[1:27:28] try yeah don't
[1:27:31] it's just like putting a little baby's
[1:27:33] arm in a sleeve hole you see he's just
[1:27:35] up down over and everything else see he
[1:27:37] can't do it put on your coat honey he
[1:27:40] can't do it little arm is up down around
[1:27:42] it takes you your Steady Hand
[1:27:44] oh how glad I am I can just yield my
[1:27:47] hand to Father saying Lord Jesus I can't
[1:27:49] get in there you help me put the coat on
[1:27:51] I quit trying just let him do it see if
[1:27:55] the little baby keeps trying oh I can do
[1:27:56] it I can do it he's just everywhere he
[1:27:59] can't do it neither can you neither can
[1:28:02] I but if we'll just hold still and let
[1:28:04] him do it just yield to him here Lord
[1:28:07] here I am just let me be nothing
[1:28:10] you put my hand in the right place
[1:28:12] that's the victory that's overcoming the
[1:28:15] thing you have to overcome is yourself
[1:28:17] your idea your thing and surrender
[1:28:20] yourself to him
[1:28:21] he overcome for you he knows the way we
[1:28:25] don't
[1:28:27] we have to get to the point where we're
[1:28:29] thinking the same thoughts
[1:28:32] as Christ where we're speaking the same
[1:28:34] words as Christ where
[1:28:36] we're living the life that Christ is
[1:28:39] calling us to
[1:28:51] for this is the love of God that we keep
[1:28:53] his Commandments and his Commandments
[1:28:55] are not Grievous
[1:28:59] he hasn't given us Commandments that
[1:29:02] are
[1:29:07] designed to hurt you he hasn't given you
[1:29:10] Commandments that are designed to cause
[1:29:13] you problems he hasn't given you
[1:29:15] Commandments that are
[1:29:21] unacceptable
[1:29:22] he hasn't given you Commandments that
[1:29:24] are
[1:29:25] that don't make sense
[1:29:28] he hasn't asked anything of you that is
[1:29:30] unreasonable
[1:29:32] he gives you these Commandments and just
[1:29:35] like his children when our parents would
[1:29:37] tell us to do things
[1:29:39] and at certain ages we would go why are
[1:29:41] they telling us this
[1:29:43] I'm 10 years old I know better than that
[1:29:46] why shouldn't I go jump off the roof of
[1:29:49] the house I'll be fine
[1:29:50] look I've got a sheet it's gonna be a
[1:29:52] great parachute
[1:29:54] why shouldn't I do this
[1:29:56] and the parents are going don't do it
[1:29:59] you're going to get hurt you're not
[1:30:01] allowed to do this
[1:30:03] then you get a little bit older
[1:30:06] you get into your teenage years and
[1:30:08] maybe you're like all right my parents
[1:30:10] had a little more wisdom about that I
[1:30:11] shouldn't jump off the roof
[1:30:13] but why can't I go hang out with this
[1:30:15] crowd of people why can't I go and do
[1:30:17] this why can't I do that
[1:30:19] my parents don't really understand what
[1:30:20] they're talking about then you get a
[1:30:22] little bit older start going wow
[1:30:24] my parents were smarter than I thought
[1:30:25] they were they knew a little bit more
[1:30:27] than I thought they were
[1:30:28] and we keep going through that where as
[1:30:31] we begin to get older and more mature we
[1:30:32] go
[1:30:33] wow
[1:30:34] my parents were actually pretty smart
[1:30:36] they knew what they were telling us
[1:30:38] about they weren't giving me instruction
[1:30:40] without a purpose they weren't telling
[1:30:43] me that I shouldn't do this simply
[1:30:45] because they didn't want me to have fun
[1:30:48] which is what we think is kids we go you
[1:30:49] just want me to have fun you don't want
[1:30:51] me to have a good time you don't want me
[1:30:52] to enjoy myself
[1:30:54] but the parents are telling you no I'm
[1:30:57] trying to save you from hurt
[1:30:59] whether it's hurt in the moment from
[1:31:02] jumping off the roof
[1:31:04] or it's hurt that will develop over time
[1:31:06] from hanging with the wrong crowd
[1:31:09] I'm giving you instruction I'm giving
[1:31:12] you guideline to protect you
[1:31:15] and then we when we see that happen over
[1:31:18] and over
[1:31:20] children to adults
[1:31:23] how can we then as human beings look at
[1:31:27] God and say no your instructions don't
[1:31:30] make sense I know better than you do
[1:31:34] we already see it acted out over and
[1:31:36] over children's parents
[1:31:42] which is only a gap of
[1:31:45] 20 years
[1:31:48] but yet we as human beings
[1:31:53] sometimes think that we can look at God
[1:31:54] and go no
[1:31:57] that doesn't make sense
[1:32:00] and there's a gap of
[1:32:02] timelessness eternity between the way we
[1:32:05] think
[1:32:06] and the way God thinks
[1:32:09] God isn't giving us instruction that are
[1:32:11] Grievous he isn't putting things out
[1:32:13] there to hurt us or to just prevent us
[1:32:17] from having a good time
[1:32:19] he's protecting us he's watching over us
[1:32:23] as the loving father
[1:32:25] and so when we love him we keep his
[1:32:28] Commandments when we love him
[1:32:31] we do what he asks us to do
[1:32:35] it's the same thing as I remember
[1:32:38] I worked for uh
[1:32:40] a really good guy at one of the the
[1:32:43] Chick-fil-As a while back and he had a
[1:32:46] policy
[1:32:48] that I can
[1:32:50] it's just wisdom anyway but after
[1:32:52] getting to know him and his wife I
[1:32:53] pretty much guarantee
[1:32:55] his wife told him this is what I'm
[1:32:56] comfortable with where he had a policy
[1:32:57] he would never be in a room
[1:33:00] alone with a woman
[1:33:04] even in the office at a restaurant which
[1:33:06] there's this big old window nothing
[1:33:08] could happen that wasn't seen there were
[1:33:09] cameras all this stuff
[1:33:11] that door was propped open
[1:33:13] the door was not closed there was no way
[1:33:15] where he was going to be in a closed
[1:33:17] environment
[1:33:19] with the woman whether it was married
[1:33:21] single didn't matter
[1:33:24] and this is one of the things that
[1:33:27] his wife had said this is what would
[1:33:29] make me uncomfortable
[1:33:31] great
[1:33:33] I'm going to abide by that because I
[1:33:35] love my wife I fear her I respect her
[1:33:39] I'm not going to go out of my way to
[1:33:41] hurt her
[1:33:44] and in most marriage relationships I
[1:33:46] think that there are those kind of
[1:33:48] guidelines that have been put in place
[1:33:49] where you know this is the kind of thing
[1:33:52] that would bother
[1:33:54] my husband or my wife
[1:33:57] and so I don't do that because I don't
[1:34:00] want to hurt
[1:34:01] my spouse
[1:34:04] I don't want to go past that barrier
[1:34:06] where they've said this is kind of the
[1:34:08] boundary line
[1:34:12] of what would make me comfortable or
[1:34:15] uncomfortable sometimes that has to do
[1:34:17] with protecting the marriage covenant
[1:34:19] self sometimes it just has to do with
[1:34:21] safety
[1:34:22] maybe the husband loves doing
[1:34:26] Daredevil type activities he likes to go
[1:34:29] hiking on these really impressive trails
[1:34:33] and rock climbing and all this kind of
[1:34:35] stuff
[1:34:36] and so his wife is like okay I can I can
[1:34:39] let you go out this far
[1:34:41] do what you do what you feel like you
[1:34:44] this is just what you enjoy
[1:34:46] but this is the point where it crosses
[1:34:48] over into I'm no longer comfortable with
[1:34:49] you doing it
[1:34:51] this is this is that red line
[1:34:54] you can do all this stuff be thrill
[1:34:57] seeking do all those things just don't
[1:34:58] go don't go past that red line
[1:35:02] and God gives us those instructions goes
[1:35:04] here's the red line
[1:35:07] if you love me
[1:35:10] keep my Commandments don't go past the
[1:35:12] red line
[1:35:14] don't go past the Border don't go out of
[1:35:17] our land out of our property
[1:35:21] you can do everything up to the line
[1:35:22] everything in this area it's yours
[1:35:26] just don't go past the line that's what
[1:35:29] the Commandment is for
[1:35:39] Luke Chapter 11
[1:35:46] nope sorry I already read through some
[1:35:47] of these
[1:35:58] praise the Lord
[1:36:19] you know as brother Brandon's telling
[1:36:20] the the story of the
[1:36:23] the baby putting trying to put its arm
[1:36:26] into the coat
[1:36:30] every parent knows this every parent's
[1:36:32] been through this
[1:36:33] as they're trying to get their little
[1:36:35] one dressed and he's wiggling and he's
[1:36:37] moving and he's doing all these
[1:36:39] different things or when they start to
[1:36:41] get the age where they want to be
[1:36:43] independent and they want to do it
[1:36:45] themselves but they're not quite ready
[1:36:50] and you might let them try to put on the
[1:36:53] coat by themselves for a little bit
[1:36:55] and you see them getting more and more
[1:36:57] frustrated with it as they're trying to
[1:36:59] do it on their own
[1:37:00] and then finally you step in
[1:37:03] as the parent go here let me help
[1:37:05] let me show you how to get it in
[1:37:08] and brother Ram as he's talking about
[1:37:10] the story and how we can overcome it's
[1:37:14] we're supposed to be
[1:37:16] able to rest
[1:37:20] we don't overcome because of our own
[1:37:22] abilities we don't overcome because of
[1:37:25] our own power we don't overcome because
[1:37:28] of Our Own Strength
[1:37:31] we overcome because we choose to
[1:37:34] surrender to him
[1:37:35] and so when we're struggling with
[1:37:37] different things when we're struggling
[1:37:40] with some of these Commandments
[1:37:43] with some of these instructions with
[1:37:45] some of these guidelines that we've been
[1:37:46] given
[1:37:48] we have to rest back into him and go all
[1:37:51] right Lord
[1:37:52] this is where
[1:37:54] you've drawn that red line
[1:37:57] I need to rest in you and stay away from
[1:37:59] it I need you to be the one that takes
[1:38:01] control and shows me how to put my arm
[1:38:03] in that sleeve how to not
[1:38:07] keep going across that red line how to
[1:38:09] not
[1:38:10] keep making this mistake over and over I
[1:38:12] need to surrender to you and let you
[1:38:15] take control
[1:38:17] it's like I mentioned multiple times the
[1:38:19] goal is for us to begin to speak the
[1:38:21] same words that he gave us
[1:38:24] to begin to think the same thoughts to
[1:38:26] begin to move into the place where our
[1:38:29] reactions
[1:38:30] are the same as Christ where people
[1:38:32] would look at
[1:38:34] you as a mature believer and go
[1:38:37] that's
[1:38:39] Christ
[1:38:41] I've had a few of those people in my
[1:38:43] life
[1:38:44] I know my wife's probably thinking the
[1:38:46] exact same name I am right now but we've
[1:38:48] had different ones through our through
[1:38:49] our lives where you look at this mature
[1:38:52] brother or mature sister in the church
[1:38:54] and you go if I had to pick somebody
[1:38:57] that is like Christ on Earth right now
[1:38:59] that's the person
[1:39:01] because they have gotten to that point
[1:39:04] where they are surrendered
[1:39:06] and they are simply
[1:39:08] loving those around them and they are
[1:39:11] living
[1:39:12] the way God calls them to
[1:39:15] and there's never a question about are
[1:39:17] they going to cross at the red line
[1:39:19] they don't have the slightest
[1:39:20] inclination
[1:39:21] to go anywhere near the red line
[1:39:28] that's what God's calling each one of us
[1:39:30] to be each one of us to get to is to be
[1:39:33] that person
[1:39:34] that on the job site people will look at
[1:39:36] you and go
[1:39:39] that's Christ here
[1:39:41] or at school or at
[1:39:45] home
[1:39:46] or at church
[1:39:48] that others feelings of
[1:39:51] that's the kind of believer I want to be
[1:39:54] that's somebody that is modeling Christ
[1:39:59] as the musicians come
[1:40:03] Psalms 111
[1:40:06] and verse 6 it says
[1:40:09] he hath showed his people the power of
[1:40:11] His works
[1:40:12] that he may give them the heritage of
[1:40:14] the heathen
[1:40:15] The Works of his hands are Verity and
[1:40:18] judgment all his Commandments are sure
[1:40:21] they stand fast forever and ever and are
[1:40:24] done in truth and uprightness
[1:40:27] he sent Redemption unto his people he
[1:40:29] hath commanded his Covenant forever
[1:40:32] holy and Reverend is his name
[1:40:36] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:40:38] wisdom a good understanding of all they
[1:40:41] that do his Commandments his praise
[1:40:44] endureth forever
[1:40:50] the psalmist writing says all his
[1:40:52] Commandments are sure
[1:40:54] if he told you to do it there's no
[1:40:56] question there's no doubt there's no
[1:40:58] chance that he told you the wrong thing
[1:41:00] if he gave you this instruction if he
[1:41:03] gave you this commandment
[1:41:05] then it's sure
[1:41:08] it's the rock that you can build on
[1:41:09] because there's no
[1:41:11] shakiness to it it's the strong
[1:41:13] Foundation because his Commandments are
[1:41:16] sure
[1:41:18] they stand fast
[1:41:20] forever and ever
[1:41:22] and not only are they sure and stand
[1:41:24] fast
[1:41:25] but they are done in truth and
[1:41:28] uprightness
[1:41:31] he didn't put this down
[1:41:35] with bad intentions
[1:41:37] it was truth and uprightness he gave you
[1:41:40] these Commandments because he's trying
[1:41:42] to protect you because he's trying to
[1:41:44] take care of you because he's trying to
[1:41:46] guide you
[1:41:48] it's not because he's trying to keep you
[1:41:50] away from something that he should allow
[1:41:53] you to have
[1:41:55] and then it's the fear of the Lord is
[1:41:57] the beginning of wisdom a good
[1:41:59] understanding have all they that do his
[1:42:01] Commandments
[1:42:03] if you're doing his Commandments
[1:42:07] and you're doing it with the honest
[1:42:09] loving heart
[1:42:12] you have the good understanding you go I
[1:42:15] know God gave me this instruction for a
[1:42:17] reason
[1:42:19] maybe I don't fully understand it yet
[1:42:21] maybe I don't understand why he told me
[1:42:25] but I still can know that it's because
[1:42:27] God loves me
[1:42:29] at this point I'm now I'm loving God and
[1:42:32] trusting he loves me and whether I
[1:42:34] understand that or not understand the
[1:42:37] instruction understand the Commandment I
[1:42:40] can know the spirit that it's given in
[1:42:44] there are times that we as
[1:42:48] children did that with our parents it's
[1:42:50] like I didn't necessarily understand
[1:42:52] every instruction that I was given I
[1:42:54] didn't necessarily understand every
[1:42:56] guideline that my parents had taught me
[1:43:00] and there were times
[1:43:02] when I didn't
[1:43:05] have the Holy Ghost yet
[1:43:07] and I was still relying on them to be
[1:43:09] the Holy Ghost because I was going I'm
[1:43:11] not doing this I'm not getting into
[1:43:13] trouble there because my parents told me
[1:43:15] not to do this
[1:43:18] even though down the inside I still
[1:43:20] wanted to
[1:43:22] but I had that guideline I had that
[1:43:24] guard rail that was there and I had
[1:43:26] enough trust in my parents at that age
[1:43:28] to go
[1:43:28] I'm not going to do it
[1:43:34] now if you someone asked me at that age
[1:43:35] I tell them I can't do that because my
[1:43:37] mom will kill me
[1:43:38] but it was also that I knew
[1:43:41] they cared for me if my mom and dad told
[1:43:44] me this
[1:43:45] thankfully I was old enough at that
[1:43:46] point to go
[1:43:48] okay I can accept
[1:43:50] they're telling me for a reason
[1:43:55] brother random said in the sermon things
[1:43:57] that are to be he said Christians I may
[1:44:00] never see you again
[1:44:01] see it's years since I've been here may
[1:44:04] never see you again
[1:44:05] line up with God's word
[1:44:08] look in the mirror like a little boy one
[1:44:10] time has been out in the country never
[1:44:11] seen a mirror he came to his Auntie's
[1:44:14] house he started walking up the steps
[1:44:16] he's seen a mirror and he's seen a
[1:44:17] little boy in the mirror he kept walking
[1:44:19] up looking and he would wave and the
[1:44:21] little boy would wave and he kept
[1:44:23] looking he never seen himself in a
[1:44:25] mirror so when he got close enough he
[1:44:26] turned around he said why mama that's me
[1:44:30] how do you look in God's mirror
[1:44:33] does it reflect a daughter or a son of
[1:44:36] God
[1:44:37] is there something which you hear
[1:44:39] that doesn't make you hate the man
[1:44:41] that's saying it
[1:44:42] or there's something pull say I know
[1:44:44] that man is right because that's in the
[1:44:47] scripture
[1:44:50] the Commandments are laid out there
[1:44:52] and we can be like the first son
[1:44:56] and we can be sitting in church with our
[1:44:58] arms crossed and a scowl on our face
[1:45:00] hating every word that the minister is
[1:45:03] saying because we don't want to accept
[1:45:05] it
[1:45:07] foreign
[1:45:09] but it didn't stop there
[1:45:13] because Jesus in the story makes it very
[1:45:16] clear he repented
[1:45:18] he may have had a poor attitude at the
[1:45:19] beginning he may have not wanted to hear
[1:45:21] the instruction he may not have wanted
[1:45:22] to hear what the father was telling him
[1:45:27] but he was willing to repent
[1:45:29] and he was willing to then go do what he
[1:45:32] had been told
[1:45:33] to go do what the father was telling him
[1:45:35] to do
[1:45:38] and I think this is something that
[1:45:40] repeats in our lives over and over and
[1:45:43] over this isn't something that is just
[1:45:46] for those that they haven't yet accepted
[1:45:48] Christ as their savior this isn't just
[1:45:50] for those that are new to church this
[1:45:53] isn't for those that are still growing
[1:45:55] up that are kids
[1:45:56] this is something every one of us faces
[1:45:59] over and over
[1:46:01] because God keeps unveiling his word a
[1:46:04] little more and revealing a little more
[1:46:06] to you and showing a little more to you
[1:46:08] based on what you're going through
[1:46:11] and you have the choice
[1:46:13] on how you accept it
[1:46:16] and then what you actually take action
[1:46:18] on
[1:46:22] we can
[1:46:24] be the person sitting there with a scowl
[1:46:26] we can be the person sitting there
[1:46:28] smiling and praising and joining in with
[1:46:31] everyone else
[1:46:34] but Jesus made it clear what matters is
[1:46:37] what happens after that after we walk
[1:46:39] out those doors after we go back into
[1:46:42] our life
[1:46:46] do we repent
[1:46:48] and we take action on the instruction
[1:46:50] we've been given
[1:46:52] do you repent and follow the command
[1:46:55] that God gave us
[1:46:58] or do we allow ourselves to be
[1:46:59] distracted
[1:47:01] or focused on other things
[1:47:04] and never follow through
[1:47:06] on the instruction we were given
[1:47:11] the parable manifests over and over and
[1:47:14] over through our lives
[1:47:16] and probably each one of us at some
[1:47:18] point has been the first son and at some
[1:47:20] point has been the second son
[1:47:22] we've been both
[1:47:25] you can't tell me that well I've only
[1:47:27] ever done this side of the parable
[1:47:29] because I'm not going to believe you
[1:47:32] but eventually
[1:47:36] if we're Christians
[1:47:38] we're going to end up in the slot of the
[1:47:40] first son
[1:47:41] because we're going to repent we're
[1:47:44] going to end up turning back to follow
[1:47:46] the commands we've been given because
[1:47:50] we are his sons we are his children
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:55] and if I'm really his child then I'm
[1:47:58] going to turn and do what I've been
[1:48:00] taught
[1:48:01] and do what God has instructed in me and
[1:48:04] do what the Commandments are
[1:48:11] thank you
[1:48:13] for this is the love of God
[1:48:16] that we keep his Commandments
[1:48:20] let's pray
[1:48:24] Lord Jesus
[1:48:28] Lord this wasn't a
[1:48:31] shouting sermon this wasn't full of
[1:48:34] excitement this wasn't
[1:48:37] necessarily
[1:48:40] entertaining enjoyable
[1:48:42] foreign
[1:48:45] Lord if it makes us look in the mirror
[1:48:48] of your word for a few moments
[1:48:51] if it makes us look at our lives and
[1:48:55] and think about the decisions we're
[1:48:57] making if it
[1:48:59] makes us look in that mirror to see am I
[1:49:02] am I standing as a Son of God or as a
[1:49:05] daughter of God or
[1:49:07] am I resenting the word that's coming
[1:49:09] forth from
[1:49:12] the ministers or the scriptures that I
[1:49:15] read them or the prophet as I listen
[1:49:21] Lord
[1:49:24] if we're walking the wrong direction if
[1:49:26] we're we're being that second son that's
[1:49:30] walking away from the Commandments Lord
[1:49:34] help us to repent
[1:49:36] help us to turn around and and walk back
[1:49:39] to where you've instructed us to
[1:49:43] because Lord your Commandments aren't
[1:49:45] Grievous
[1:49:47] they're there for our protection they're
[1:49:50] there for our growth they're there for
[1:49:52] our
[1:49:55] safety
[1:49:59] Lord I pray that you would help each one
[1:50:01] of us to examine ourselves and in the
[1:50:03] mirror of the word just a little bit
[1:50:05] more Lord
[1:50:09] help us just to surrender to you and
[1:50:11] surrender to the commandments so that we
[1:50:13] can express
[1:50:15] our love to you because when we love you
[1:50:18] we would keep your Commandments
[1:50:21] Lord be in
[1:50:24] our next little bit of time we have Lord
[1:50:27] accept our worship Lord Jesus
[1:50:32] and Lord may you just continue to
[1:50:34] minister to the hearts
[1:50:46] I want to do
