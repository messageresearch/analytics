[22:22] streaks running up and down his arm. So,
[22:23] let's remember him. They took him in and

[22:55] Father. God, you see your people, Lord,
[22:58] how they just diligently come, Lord, to

[24:06] Oh, I see a clown like a man's hand.
[24:12] Oh, and I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[24:20] And I know it's going to rain. Can we do
[24:24] verse one now? At a time when it was
[24:27] dry, not a cloud in the sky, the
[24:32] children of God get the reason why.
[24:38] So they went to God's man because they
[24:42] didn't understand.
[24:44] Go look, it's written in the sky.
[24:51] Now when I see a cloud like a man's
[24:55] head,
[24:57] oh I see a cloud like a man's head.
[25:03] Oh, and I see a cloud like a man's head.
[25:11] And I know it's going to rain.
[25:16] So they open up the door. The seventh
[25:20] time they looked once more, a tiny cloud
[25:24] was rising from the sea.
[25:28] Then they began to understand that a
[25:32] heavy rain was at hand. Oh, just like
[25:36] God said it would be. How about it
[25:39] tonight? Well, now I see a clown.
[25:45] Yes, I do. Oh, and I see a cloud I
[25:50] commanded.
[25:52] Oh, and I see
[26:00] &gt;&gt; and I know it's going to rain. I love
[26:04] this verse. So today we have no fear. We
[26:08] know a clouded up here. The promise
[26:12] scream, "My bride, go through that door.
[26:16] Oh, have faith and just believe. God's
[26:20] spirit you'll receive.
[26:24] Yes. Just about to pour.
[26:28] Oh, I see a clown.
[26:34] Thank you, Lord. And I see a cloud like
[26:39] a man's head.
[26:41] Oh, and I see a cloud like a man's hair.
[26:49] Oh, and I know it's going to rain.
[26:52] Singing out his brother Mike King comes
[26:54] and I see a clown.
[26:59] Yes, I do. Oh, I see a clown like a
[27:04] man's head.
[27:06] Oh, and I see a thou like a man's hand.
[27:14] And I know it's going to rain.
[27:20] Do you believe that tonight? Hallelujah.
[27:22] How many's come with their cups raised
[27:24] up to the sky?
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As brother David Gapman
[27:28] says, "Not bringing just a cup, but
[27:30] backing up my truck." Amen. I believe
[27:33] the Lord can pour out a spirit here
[27:35] tonight. Amen. God bless you now.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Even though my spirit is low
[27:51] and it seems I can hardly go, but still
[27:58] I see victory.
[28:04] And at times I'm walking by faith. Can't
[28:08] see what lies before me. But still
[28:14] I see victory.
[28:19] Oh, I just got to tell you, Satan,
[28:24] you can't cross the bloodline
[28:28] because I'm covered by the blood.
[28:35] You may snare and you may fight. You're
[28:39] going to lose this battle tonight.
[28:43] Remember,
[28:45] you can't cross the bloodline.
[28:51] Sometimes the battle gets hard. It seems
[28:56] we're fighting a lot. I remember
[29:00] I'm standing on the rock.
[29:05] So Satan, if I were you, I'd turn around
[29:11] and give up to I believe
[29:15] you're bound to lose.
[29:20] Oh, I just got to tell you, Satan, you
[29:25] can't cross the bloodline

[29:43] Remember,
[29:45] you can't cross the bloodline.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the battle gets hard. It seems
[30:02] we're fighting a lot. I remember
[30:06] I'm standing on the wrong
[30:12] Satan. If I were you, I'd turn around
[30:17] and give up to I believe
[30:21] you're bound to lose.
[30:26] I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't
[30:31] cross the bloodline
[30:35] because I'm covered by the blood.
[30:41] You may snare and you may fight. You're
[30:45] going to lose this battle tonight.
[30:48] Remember,
[30:51] you can't cross the bloodline.
[30:56] I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't
[31:01] cross the bloodline
[31:04] because I'm covered by the blood.
[31:10] You may snare and you may fight. You're
[31:14] going to lose this battle tonight.
[31:18] Remember,
[31:20] you can't cross the blood line.
[31:24] You must remember

[36:59] to be in the presence of the Lord
[37:08] and not know what time it is.
[37:16] Because time stood still.
[37:25] Bies were healed
[37:32] and families restored
[37:41] &gt;&gt; because we stayed here
[37:47] in the presence of the Lord.
[37:56] I want more.
[38:04] I want more.
[38:12] I want more.
[38:20] Jesus, I want more.
[38:28] I want more.
[38:36] I want more.
[38:44] I want more. More
[38:52] Jesus, I want more.
[39:00] I want more.
[39:08] I want more.
[39:16] I want more,
[39:23] Jesus. I want more.
[39:31] I want more.
[39:39] I want more.
[39:47] I want more.
[39:54] Oh Jesus, I want more.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; So I'll stay.
[40:10] Where else would I go?
[40:18] &gt;&gt; My heart is burning
[40:25] in your presence,
[40:29] Lord.
[40:35] So, I'll stay.
[40:42] Where else could I go?
[40:50] My heart is burning
[40:57] in your presence,
[41:01] Lord.
[41:17] Amen. Is your heart burning tonight?
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we can we can meet him
[41:23] here tonight. Amen. As the man of God
[41:26] comes, can we sing this? Draw me close
[41:30] to you.
[41:36] Never let me go.
[41:44] I lay it all down again.
[41:52] To hear you say that I'm your friend.
[41:56] You are my desire
[42:00] and you are my desire.
[42:04] Yes, Lord. No one else will do.
[42:08] No one else will do.
[42:16] No one else can take your place.
[42:23] to feel the warmth of your embrace.
[42:30] Help me find a way. Help me find a way.
[42:35] Bring me back to you.
[42:39] You're all I want.
[42:42] You're all I want. Is that your desire
[42:46] tonight? Yes, Lord.
[42:50] You're all I've ever
[42:54] needed.
[42:58] You're all
[43:00] I want.
[43:05] Help me know you. Sing it now as the man
[43:09] of God comes. You're all I want. Yes,
[43:11] Lord. You're all I want. Can you just
[43:17] lift a hand and and sing it to him
[43:18] tonight as a prayer? You're all
[43:23] I've ever
[43:25] needed.
[43:28] You're all I want.
[43:46] Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; I wish I knew that song. I'd sing it
[43:57] with you all. Amen. It's a beautiful
[43:59] song, but I don't know it. So, I'm just
[44:01] going to let them play it for a minute.
[44:13] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; It's an honor to be in the house of God
[44:25] again.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; It's an honor to be able to stand behind
[44:29] this sacred desk and be trusted with the
[44:32] word of God one more time.
[44:35] You know, that's one of
[44:38] the the greatest things to me is the
[44:40] trust given to someone to handle the
[44:41] word. You know, uh but by the grace of
[44:44] God, we'll say what he'll have us to
[44:47] say. Amen. But it truly is an honor and
[44:49] it's good to see you all again. Uh if
[44:52] you'll open your Bibles to Revelations
[44:54] chap 21, we'll start at verse one.
[44:59] You know, one of the
[45:02] greatest times of my day is getting
[45:05] home,
[45:07] walking into the house, and there's my
[45:09] wife. You know, she's cleaning, cooking,
[45:13] even griping.
[45:17] Sorry, dear.
[45:19] But it's still the highlight of my day.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[45:23] You know, cuz every morning that we get
[45:25] up and we go to work and we do what we
[45:29] have to do and fight what we have to
[45:31] fight, it's for her.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; It's for the kids. It's not for me. You
[45:37] know, I I could handle a box somewhere,
[45:39] a little bitty old cabin out in the
[45:41] mountains and nothing. It I don't do it
[45:43] for me. I do it for her.
[45:47] You know it. It's still a few months
[45:49] away, but we're coming up on our 26th
[45:51] anniversary.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. We don't look that old, do
[45:56] we?
[45:57] Amen. Well, she don't anyway. I do, but
[45:59] she don't. She gets younger every day. I
[46:01] get older. Amen. But uh but I I still
[46:05] want to know more.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I want to know what she's thinking. I
[46:09] want to know what she's feeling. I want
[46:11] to know everything about her day. And
[46:14] sometimes I'll just sit there and let
[46:16] her talk. And she talks and then finally
[46:18] she's like, "You're not saying nothing."
[46:19] I was like, "I know. I like to hear you
[46:22] talk." And it's the truth. I'm not
[46:24] lying. You know, and so maybe, just
[46:27] maybe, brother, if I finally ended up
[46:29] with a title for you, I'm going to call
[46:31] it wedding vows.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Uh it's one of the most sacred things I
[46:38] believe I've in this world. I mean, the
[46:41] most sacred thing is Jesus Christ, but
[46:43] in this world, I think the most sacred
[46:45] thing that I've ever said was my wedding
[46:47] vows.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[46:49] &gt;&gt; I meant them. Every word of them.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; I won't break them.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Try my best not to. You know what I
[46:56] mean? I think I think the wedding and
[46:59] vows are the most wonderful thing
[47:01] &gt;&gt; two humans
[47:03] &gt;&gt; can do. Vow to actually love each other
[47:07] for the rest of your life. It's amazing.
[47:10] But we get it honest because we get it
[47:12] from the Lord. Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Well, Revelations chapter 21. And I saw
[47:18] a new heaven and a new earth. For the
[47:21] first heaven and the first earth were
[47:22] passed away, and there was no more sea.
[47:25] And I, John, saw the holy city, New
[47:27] Jerusalem, coming down from God out of
[47:29] heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for
[47:32] her husband. And I heard a great voice
[47:34] out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the
[47:36] tabernacle of God is with men, and he
[47:39] will dwell with them, and they shall be
[47:41] his people, and God himself shall be
[47:43] with them, and be their God. And God
[47:45] shall wipe away all tears from their
[47:47] eyes, and there shall be no more death,
[47:49] neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
[47:51] shall there be any more pain, for the
[47:54] former things are passed away." And he
[47:56] that sat upon the throne said, the one
[47:59] that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I
[48:03] make all things new, and he said unto
[48:06] me, right, for these words are true and
[48:11] faithful.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, dear heavenly father, Lord, we're so
[48:16] thankful for your word tonight, Lord. It
[48:19] means so much to us when you take the
[48:21] time to speak to us, Lord. And we
[48:23] appreciate your time and your mercy in
[48:25] your presence, Father. Lord, I ask you
[48:28] to move me out of the way one more time,
[48:30] Lord, and come down and and say
[48:32] something to your people, Lord, for you
[48:35] know what they need. I don't. So, Lord,
[48:37] I ask you to take control in Jesus name
[48:39] we pray. Amen. Y'all can get comfortable
[48:43] if you want.
[48:45] Amen. So that it's kind of weird to to
[48:49] to read that and then have a title of
[48:52] wedding vows
[48:54] and Lord willing
[48:56] it'll all come together. Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; But all through this we we know that the
[49:03] Bible is a love letter.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; It's a love letter from the beginning of
[49:09] the Bible to the end of the Bible. It's
[49:11] a love letter to you and to me. It tells
[49:16] us all about our husband.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; It tell us tells us all about the one
[49:23] that loved us so much that he chose to
[49:26] redeem us back to him.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Not as servants, not not as uh someone
[49:33] lesser than not then. No, he redeemed us
[49:37] back to him.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Setting us on the throne with him.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[49:45] And then he wanted to make sure that we
[49:47] stayed with him so much that he made the
[49:50] vow to himself.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't he didn't leave it, you know,
[49:55] to to chance. He didn't leave it to
[49:58] anything. He looked ahead and he saw us
[50:00] and he loved us so much that he put it
[50:03] in his word.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Everything in his word
[50:08] &gt;&gt; and then turned around and said,
[50:09] "Heavens and earth will pass away, but
[50:10] my word
[50:12] &gt;&gt; will never pass away." Right.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; So his redemption and his love for us,
[50:17] he put it into one thing that will never
[50:21] pass away.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And then he said that word will be made
[50:25] flesh. And we know Christ was word made
[50:27] flesh. But brothers and sisters, you and
[50:29] I are word made flesh.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; So if we're word made flesh and he's
[50:34] word made flesh and the word will never
[50:36] pass away, brothers and sisters, neither
[50:38] will we.
[50:40] Now, these bodies may pass away, but
[50:43] that soul that he sealed inside of us
[50:45] through the Holy Spirit will never pass
[50:48] away. And he vowed that to himself.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will make a way."
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will come down. I will be
[50:57] your God. You will be my people."
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. He He didn't just
[51:06] redeem us back.
[51:10] to be slaves.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not a slave to this.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm not This is not my taskmaster.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; No.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; I've been freed from my task masters.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; The ones that made me crawl at home
[51:27] through my own puke from the drinking,
[51:30] &gt;&gt; that was task masters.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, this is freedom.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He redeemed me back to freedom. He
[51:38] redeemed me back to who I am. He
[51:41] redeemed me back to love.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; You ever heard that expression? You
[51:47] know, only a face that a mother can
[51:49] love. That was said about me a lot, but
[51:50] it is an expression, right?
[51:54] But he freed us from that and brought us
[51:56] back to something that even when the
[51:59] world looks at it, even though they
[52:01] gripe about it and yell and holler and
[52:04] scoff and all that, when they need
[52:06] something, where do they go?
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Because they love what God's given you
[52:13] as much as you love what's God given
[52:15] you. And they search for it and they
[52:17] look for it. The only problem is is they
[52:20] don't realize it's sitting right in
[52:22] front of them. The whole world is making
[52:24] space stations and space shuttles and
[52:26] everything because they're saying
[52:28] there's got to be beings in the heaven.
[52:29] There's got to be other people. There's
[52:31] got to be another race. There's got to
[52:33] be all these things. And what they don't
[52:35] realize is it's already here.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world. I'm a heavenly
[52:40] being. I've been redeemed back to who I
[52:43] am.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not earthly.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; I'm heavenly.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; So, what they're out in the stars
[52:51] looking for is right here.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the truth.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; They're searching for something out
[53:01] there in the heavens when the heavens
[53:04] has come down to us.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; But they missed it.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Just like they missed Christ then,
[53:11] they're missing it now. And it's our job
[53:14] to tell them.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it is.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read you a quote here that
[53:23] that I really really really like and I
[53:25] know it's a
[53:27] it's a uh very common quote out of the
[53:31] seven church ages, but I'm going to read
[53:32] it anyways
[53:35] because
[53:36] sometimes it's said one way when it's
[53:38] actually written another. So, so we're
[53:40] going to read it. says, "Now remember
[53:41] this. Christ in the true church is a
[53:44] continuation of the book of Acts. But
[53:47] the book of Revelation shows how that
[53:49] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[53:51] the church and defile it,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; making it lukewarm, formal, and
[53:56] powerless.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; It exposes Satan, revealing his works,
[54:00] attempted destruction of God's people,
[54:02] and the discrediting of God's word,
[54:05] right down to the time he is cast into
[54:07] the lake of fire. He fights that. He
[54:09] cannot stand it. He knows. This is
[54:12] Satan.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; And if he knows, we ought to know.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; He knows that if the people get the true
[54:19] revelation of the true church and what
[54:22] she is, what she stands for, and that
[54:26] she can do the greater works, she will
[54:29] be an invincible army.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. what she is.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[54:42] &gt;&gt; this is probably gonna get me in
[54:43] trouble. There's a lot of whats we can
[54:45] be. There's a lot of watts that can
[54:47] stand for. But I know one thing,
[54:51] brothers and sisters. God redeemed you,
[54:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Brought you to him.
[54:57] Set you in heavenly places with Christ
[54:59] Jesus.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; He has the throne prepared for us to sit
[55:03] on beside him. Right.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. And if he's the king
[55:08] &gt;&gt; and we're going to sit on the throne and
[55:09] rule with him, what does that make us?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Well, we're the feminine side of Christ,
[55:16] right?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; So, what you are
[55:20] &gt;&gt; is the queen of heaven.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Now, the heavenly beings that they're
[55:27] looking for is here.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; What we are is the queen of heaven.
[55:33] Brother Brandham said, "I no longer call
[55:35] you church. I call you bride."
[55:37] &gt;&gt; He didn't say fiance.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; He said bride.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; So if we're married to the king,
[55:44] right?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And this is the marriage right now.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; So if we're married to him, then what we
[55:51] are is the queen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; So everything that's under his feet is
[55:57] under your feet.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Everything. Yes.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; So, Satan is under your feet.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Even in Genesis when he told Adam, he
[56:06] said, "I give you dominion over
[56:07] everything." And then he put it in there
[56:09] because he knew Satan was coming. He
[56:10] said, "Even the creepy crawly things."
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Which is Satan and his demons if you
[56:15] want. That's my opinion. But
[56:17] &gt;&gt; the creepy crawly things, everything you
[56:20] have dominion over it all. And we've
[56:21] been restored back. Now, have we got to
[56:25] the fullness of that yet? No.
[56:30] what
[56:30] &gt;&gt; I mean it's coming. It can be any
[56:32] minute.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; It can be any time.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; But then he turned around in his love
[56:39] letter and said, "I'm going to give you
[56:42] an earnest to that."
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you your healing.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; I'm the God that heals all of your
[56:51] diseases.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[56:53] &gt;&gt; By my stripes, you are healed.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Okay? It's done. It's in the word. The
[56:59] word can't fail.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Everything else will pass away, but the
[57:03] word can't. So, your healing is a done
[57:06] deal.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; There's no question about it. It
[57:10] &gt;&gt; It may be 25 years before you see the
[57:12] promise, but your healing is done.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; But what you can't do is live like it's
[57:18] going to be 25 years.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Deal with them.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Okay. I I've heard it said and and it
[57:24] and it actually hurts me. Almost makes
[57:26] me want to cry when people say, "Well, I
[57:28] don't know. I'm just gonna maybe have to
[57:30] live with this like Paul. Maybe this is
[57:32] the thorn in my side to keep me humble."
[57:35] &gt;&gt; I'm like, "No, that's not what my God
[57:36] said."
[57:37] &gt;&gt; No,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; my God didn't say, "I'm going to heal
[57:39] you from everything, but
[57:41] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; that ain't what he said. He said, I'm
[57:43] God and I heal all of your diseases."
[57:46] So, it's already done because then he
[57:48] said, "By my stripes, ye are healed."
[57:52] Not you will be, you are healed. Yes,
[57:55] sir.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; And then
[57:59] &gt;&gt; he gave us his blood for our salvation,
[58:01] for the forgiveness of sins. It's all
[58:04] there. Nothing can stop us. Nothing can
[58:08] keep us away from it but us.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And now that that that one hurts, I
[58:17] know. But it's the truth. Yeah,
[58:21] &gt;&gt; because we go into this and sometimes it
[58:24] takes a while. Brother Brandham said
[58:26] sometimes it's miracles and sometimes
[58:28] it's healing and sometimes that healing
[58:30] takes a while.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; he said that.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; But
[58:35] whenever
[58:38] Noah
[58:40] was in the floods.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Right. and it rained for 40 days and 40
[58:46] nights and then I believe it was 110
[58:48] days later before the water actually
[58:50] receded. Right? So on the 111th day he
[58:53] opened it up and there was dry ground
[58:55] and they were able to come off the boat.
[58:57] Right? But what would have happened if
[58:59] he'd have got tired of it and stepped
[59:01] off of it at 98 days.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; What would have happened if he'd have
[59:05] just gave up, opened up all the doors,
[59:07] let the animals roam free and go? He
[59:10] would have missed the whole point of the
[59:12] boat. Yeah,
[59:13] &gt;&gt; they would have all died.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; But he didn't. He waited on God. He held
[59:18] to it. But every time he sent out a
[59:21] dove,
[59:22] &gt;&gt; it would come back. Nope, not yet. And
[59:23] he would wait a little bit. Then he'd be
[59:25] like, "Today's the day." And he would
[59:27] send out the dove. And the dove came
[59:29] back. But he lived like that was the day
[59:32] that the water was gone.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[59:43] When Elijah
[59:44] come back into the mountains and he was
[59:46] all upset and he wandered around and I
[59:48] believe even it was 40 days that he
[59:50] wandered around before he finally found
[59:51] himself back into a cave. And inside
[59:54] that cave was when he heard the still
[59:56] small voice of God.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; But he didn't give up. He kept going
[1:00:04] around. He kept listening. He heard the
[1:00:06] all of the wind and all that stuff. He
[1:00:08] didn't give up. He kept listening. He
[1:00:11] kept talking to God. He kept
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; You can't go and go and go and then put
[1:00:18] the brakes on and say, "Well, it's just
[1:00:21] not my time because no, you just reset
[1:00:24] it."
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; You just reset the whole thing. And
[1:00:28] you've got to now build your faith all
[1:00:30] the way back up again. All
[1:00:32] right.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Live every single day like that's the
[1:00:37] day the miracle happens. That's the day
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; God's going to move. That's the day the
[1:00:43] rapture is going to happen. That's the
[1:00:45] day the fulfillment's going to be. And
[1:00:47] the only way you can do that is stay in
[1:00:49] the presence of God 247, 365 days a
[1:00:53] year.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; All right? we don't have time to deviate
[1:00:56] and step out and move somewhere else
[1:00:59] because when you do that's when this can
[1:01:01] be attacked and then you're like oh well
[1:01:04] maybe and as soon as you do
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; clock resets
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; all right
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; every single day of our life should be
[1:01:14] lived like that's the day we're going
[1:01:16] home
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; the
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; yes I have to go to work bills have to
[1:01:22] be paid food has to be put on the table.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; I get that. But the whole time I'm at
[1:01:28] work, I'm like, "Come on. This is it.
[1:01:29] This is it. This is it. This is it. It's
[1:01:32] six o'clock somewhere." Brother Brandham
[1:01:33] said between 6:00 and 9. I know it's
[1:01:35] 5:00, but it's six o'clock somewhere.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, there's different time
[1:01:40] zones all over this world.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; He said between 6:00 and 9 in the
[1:01:43] morning. I mean, that could be 6:00 and
[1:01:45] 9 Hawaii time. That could be 6:00 to 9
[1:01:47] China time.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, it it could be 6:00 to 9
[1:01:53] in the morning. Now, it's probably 6:00
[1:01:55] to 9 US time. I don't know. I'm not
[1:01:59] going to live my life today like it's
[1:02:01] going to be six o'clock in the morning.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Every minute of my night tonight's going
[1:02:07] to be in prayer like I'm going to wake
[1:02:08] up at my wedding supper.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; You know, it it could happen at
[1:02:14] midnight. I don't know. I know what
[1:02:16] Brother Brandham said. and I will, but
[1:02:18] I'm going to live my life as though
[1:02:21] every minute is the last minute on this
[1:02:24] earth.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; So when I need my healing,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand upon the word.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand upon the promises as
[1:02:33] though that is a done deal. It doesn't
[1:02:36] matter. I've been blind since I was a
[1:02:38] year and a half old in one eye.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; But you can't tell me I don't have two
[1:02:44] eyes.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; All right. My God said, "I have two
[1:02:47] eyes."
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; So, even the guys at work, they come up
[1:02:50] to me and they're like, "Well, you know
[1:02:52] what?" And I look at them and I say,
[1:02:54] "No, I have two perfectly good eyes."
[1:02:56] And they're like, "Come on, man." No,
[1:02:58] I'm serious. My God said, "I had two
[1:03:00] perfectly good eyes." And let every
[1:03:02] man's word be a lie and mine be the
[1:03:04] truth.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; And not only just the truth, he said
[1:03:06] it's faithful.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; It's faithful.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; If it's faithful, that means he's not
[1:03:13] going to forget it. Yeah,
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; he he
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; glor.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says that Noah and
[1:03:22] them was out there on the water and they
[1:03:24] were doing all that and then the Bible
[1:03:25] says he remembered Noah.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Because he's faithful to his word.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; He remembered Noah. So he's like, "Oo,
[1:03:32] better time to get the water off, you
[1:03:34] know." But then he didn't do it like
[1:03:35] that.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; You know, the rain stopped, everything
[1:03:39] done. It was still, I believe, 110 days
[1:03:41] later, something like that. 150 days
[1:03:43] total. I could be wrong with those
[1:03:45] numbers. Forgive me if I am. But it
[1:03:47] still took a while.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Moses was in the wilderness for 40
[1:03:54] years.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; The whole, you know, and we know how
[1:03:58] that went and everybody died off and the
[1:04:00] new generation come in. But but the
[1:04:02] point of that is if everybody would have
[1:04:04] given up in year 39
[1:04:07] and just started building houses and
[1:04:09] everything right there like Gad did, you
[1:04:12] know, the tribe of Gad actually did
[1:04:13] that.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; They decided, you know what, just let us
[1:04:16] stay on this side. We're tired of this.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; They gave up.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, don't let that be me.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Because had they had just waited until
[1:04:27] the 41st year
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; If they had stood on it one more year,
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; they'd have made it into the promised
[1:04:35] land. They would have received their
[1:04:37] promise.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; If they wouldn't have given up,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; the Bible says over and over and over
[1:04:44] again, "Hold fast to that which is good.
[1:04:47] Hold fast to that which you have. Hold
[1:04:49] fast. Hold fast." You can't hold fast
[1:04:51] and give up at the same time. It doesn't
[1:04:53] work. You can't hold the line and back
[1:04:56] up at the same time. Okay.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And believe it or not, it's our job to
[1:05:02] hold the line.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; You see, in any kingdom where there's a
[1:05:09] king and a queen, you have the king who
[1:05:11] fights the battles,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; he goes to war. Look how many times
[1:05:15] David would went to war. And when he did
[1:05:17] stay back, he got himself in trouble.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Right. But they would go out and battle
[1:05:22] the enemy. They would fight the fights.
[1:05:24] They built things. They fought.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the queens were the
[1:05:29] humanitarians.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; The queens are the one that went out and
[1:05:33] fed the poor. The queens were the w ones
[1:05:35] that went out to see how things were
[1:05:37] going if they were good queens.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; The queen was the one that took care of
[1:05:41] the people. And we're the queen.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That's why we pray for people. That's
[1:05:48] why we go out into the highways and the
[1:05:50] byways and preach this gospel. We're the
[1:05:53] humanitarian part of this. All right.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; We're the queen.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. Everything in this
[1:06:05] scripture that God wrote for you was his
[1:06:08] wedding vows.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Do you get that?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz when we get over there to the
[1:06:14] wedding supper, we won't need the
[1:06:17] healing anymore.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; We won't need the salvation anymore.
[1:06:21] We'll be there in the new bodies without
[1:06:23] all of that stuff. But he knew we were
[1:06:26] marrying here.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; So he wrote this book.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; As vows
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; for our wedding.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; He vowed it to himself
[1:06:41] and said, "This I promise to you."
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. If you'll say I do
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; if you'll surrender your life to me.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; This I'll give to you.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It's his wedding vows, brothers and
[1:06:58] sisters.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; It's not just a love letter.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; It's your wedding vows.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; It is your promise of what he's going to
[1:07:07] do, what he has done, and what he will
[1:07:10] do.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right?
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; The same as a husband and a wife.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; When you make those vows, they're very
[1:07:18] serious.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it's better to what? Hang
[1:07:21] a millstone around your neck and go
[1:07:23] drown than it is to break one of them.
[1:07:25] Any vow that you make.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Wedding vows
[1:07:30] are what holds the two together.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; All right, brother.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; For life,
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; and we're eternal.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir. So these are wedding
[1:07:41] vows that keep us redeemed and with God
[1:07:46] for eternity. No wonder Paul could come
[1:07:49] back and say that I am persuaded that
[1:07:51] nothing
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; absolutely nothing can take me away from
[1:07:55] the love of God because he vowed it.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; He promised it. He gave it. Yeah.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And then just to make sure that he
[1:08:03] wasn't being unjust, he had himself
[1:08:06] tempted in the wilderness to make sure
[1:08:08] that he would know exactly what we were
[1:08:11] going through when we came to him
[1:08:13] crying.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; So, there's nothing new under the sun.
[1:08:18] The Bible says that
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; there's nothing new under the sun.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; So, if there's nothing new under the sun
[1:08:25] and God knows all things,
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; no matter what we're going through, he's
[1:08:29] felt it.
[1:08:31] He's been through it.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; He has won.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; So when he comes back to you and says,
[1:08:40] "My word says
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; my vows say you can stand on that
[1:08:45] instantly."
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Not
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; not, "Oh well, tomorrow." No, instantly
[1:08:50] you can stand on that vow and say this
[1:08:54] is done.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; You can say today this scripture is
[1:08:58] fulfilled. Today I am healed. Today I am
[1:09:03] saved. Today I am delivered. I am no
[1:09:06] longer a drunk. I no longer smoke. I no
[1:09:09] longer do this.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Even when you make the mistakes.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; His blood is sufficient.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He
[1:09:23] sealed his vows to us.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. with his own blood.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't just get out his wax and heat
[1:09:33] it up and pour it on it and put a royal
[1:09:35] seal on it.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's what earthly kingdoms do.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; That ain't what he did.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is going to be
[1:09:44] permanent."
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I'm eternal. I'm going to make my vows
[1:09:48] eternal.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; And he not only soaked us,
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; but even the scriptures are covered in
[1:09:54] blood.
[1:09:56] Yes, sir.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; He sealed it with his own blood
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and then sealed us with his blood
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; and then
[1:10:06] gave us a new heart. Gave us a new
[1:10:08] spirit
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; so that we could even accept it
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; because he loves you.
[1:10:19] Now, when I look back on my life and all
[1:10:22] the things I've done and and I won't go
[1:10:24] through it. I know I've I've told my
[1:10:26] testimony a few times.
[1:10:29] When you look back on that all honesty,
[1:10:34] you know,
[1:10:37] I don't deserve this. I'll just put it
[1:10:40] bluntly.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; None of us do. But I can tell you right
[1:10:42] now, I I don't deserve this. I was a
[1:10:45] liar, a thief, a cheat, a drunk, a drug
[1:10:47] addict.
[1:10:49] There there ain't much in that bad stuff
[1:10:51] that I didn't do. Not that I'm trying to
[1:10:53] lift it up. I'm just telling you there
[1:10:56] is nothing that God cannot forgive.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; There is nothing that God cannot wipe
[1:11:02] away.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; There is absolutely nothing,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; bless the Lord,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; that any of us have done
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; that he won't say,
[1:11:11] "I don't remember it.
[1:11:14] Yes, sir.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Which makes me feel good.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Because when Satan comes back to me
[1:11:26] laying there in the middle of the night
[1:11:28] and he says, "I don't even know what you
[1:11:30] try."
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you're going to make
[1:11:34] it.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Look at what you've done.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Look at what you've said.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Look at the way you treated your mother.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look at the way you treated your
[1:11:43] father.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Honor your mother and
[1:11:46] father.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; You didn't do that."
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And you wake up at 3:00 in the morning
[1:11:51] crying going, "Lord," and then you have
[1:11:54] to remember.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; He don't remember it.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Under the blood.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; It's under the blood.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And he gave me wedding
[1:12:08] vows telling me that it would never come
[1:12:11] out.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; I can take this
[1:12:20] and judge myself.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:12:25] by this word.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; That was explained to us by a prophet.
[1:12:29] So we know what we was reading.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and I can judge myself by this and
[1:12:35] not have to worry about a judgment later
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; now. If that isn't love,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He's like, I'm going to love you so
[1:12:47] much.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to completely take you out of
[1:12:52] the equation and set you over here.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; You just trust me. Yeah,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; that's the hard one, ain't it?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; You just trust me.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; When the bills are piling up and life's
[1:13:08] in chaos,
[1:13:11] doctors say this is wrong and that's
[1:13:13] wrong and all that.
[1:13:17] We have to trust him.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; He's our husband.
[1:13:24] He vowed to take care of us.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; He vowed we would want for nothing. He
[1:13:28] would give us everything that we needed.
[1:13:30] He said he would give us the desires of
[1:13:32] our heart because he knew him before the
[1:13:35] foundation of the world.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; So there ain't nothing that we need that
[1:13:38] he hasn't already provided for
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; as long as we don't give up too soon.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; We we can't Joshua. He had Joshua tell
[1:13:49] the people, "Sanctify yourself today
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; because tomorrow you're going to see the
[1:13:53] glory of God."
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; But sanctify yourself today. In other
[1:13:58] words,
[1:14:00] sanctifying yourself means getting rid
[1:14:01] of sin, right? Well, the only way to get
[1:14:03] rid of the sin is to get rid of the
[1:14:04] unbelief. So, if you want to sanctify
[1:14:06] yourself, then you have to get rid of
[1:14:09] the unbelief. You have to trust
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; in God.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; You have to trust that the blood is
[1:14:16] enough. You have to trust that it's all
[1:14:20] right here. And you have to trust him
[1:14:22] when he says it's faithful. Amen.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Just like
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; your wife trusts you and you trust your
[1:14:32] wife.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Because spiritually speaking, he is our
[1:14:38] husband.
[1:14:40] As a bride adornneth herself for her
[1:14:43] husband.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; But what do we adorn oursel in?
[1:14:50] The word.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:52] We have no righteousness of our own.
[1:14:56] Abraham's faith was counted to him as
[1:14:58] righteousness. So faith in what? What
[1:15:01] God said? Faith in this.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Can you trust him?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Can you trust somebody that willingly
[1:15:15] left his holy
[1:15:17] of holy of holiest holiest place in the
[1:15:20] heavens? Yeah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Come down to earth, put himself in a
[1:15:24] body,
[1:15:26] walked himself up to the cross,
[1:15:29] willingly spread out his hands,
[1:15:32] and died for you. Can you trust that
[1:15:35] man?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Can you trust that God?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. And and I'm I'm really saying this
[1:15:44] this trust
[1:15:46] because if you don't,
[1:15:49] you will stop
[1:15:51] on day 39.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And your healing was coming on day 40.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; You got to trust every single day that
[1:16:09] this is the day for the miracle. This is
[1:16:11] the day for the vow to be held up.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; This is the day. Not tomorrow. Not
[1:16:17] tonight. Not after we get home. Not
[1:16:19] because brother Wayne is coming, which
[1:16:20] is wonderful and we're all going to be
[1:16:21] blessed and miracles are going to
[1:16:23] happen. I guarantee it.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Because I expect it.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Because I'm living every single minute
[1:16:29] of my life in the presence of God,
[1:16:31] expecting miracles, expecting the
[1:16:34] supernatural, expecting it. Why? because
[1:16:37] he promised it and I trust him to be
[1:16:39] faithful for that he vowed to me.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't just promise it.
[1:16:49] He vowed it.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't just say, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I
[1:16:54] promise. I promise. I promise." He's
[1:16:56] like, "No." He's like, "I'm going to do
[1:16:58] this by my blood and by my word, and my
[1:17:01] word will never pass away. this is going
[1:17:04] to happen no matter what.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I mean, if you can't trust in that.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm God and I change not."
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; So, if he doesn't change
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And he done it then and he done it for
[1:17:22] back in the, you know, the original
[1:17:24] Pentecost days. He done it.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Healings and miracles, brothers and
[1:17:29] sisters, went through every single age.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Sure did. Sure.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You know, healings and all that followed
[1:17:36] every movement because that's that's the
[1:17:39] sign. And these signs will follow them
[1:17:41] that believe. Yeah. They didn't have the
[1:17:43] whole word, but they had enough.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; They had enough to have faith in what
[1:17:49] they knew. And the faith in what they
[1:17:50] knew created that.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; So, the healing and all that came came
[1:17:55] to pass when they didn't have the full
[1:17:58] revelation. They only had a portion.
[1:18:00] They had a small light. They looked
[1:18:02] through the glass and they couldn't
[1:18:03] quite see what was coming, but they had
[1:18:05] faith and trust enough that the miracles
[1:18:08] still happened.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; They they had enough faith in Jehovah
[1:18:14] that miracles happened under the blood
[1:18:16] of bulls and goats
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; and lambs,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; you know. Yeah, the prophets did. I
[1:18:24] mean, they even raised, you know,
[1:18:26] children from the dead.
[1:18:29] the miracles and stuff,
[1:18:32] they should be second nature to us
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; honestly.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that
[1:18:40] believe.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; So don't give up because it's been a
[1:18:44] minute.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Well, I don't know." Well,
[1:18:48] maybe. No,
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; you are healed. Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; saved.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; You are delivered.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; You are filled with the baptism of the
[1:19:07] Holy Ghost.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because he said it. Be baptized in
[1:19:11] the name of Jesus Christ and ye shall
[1:19:14] receive it. So if you don't have it, get
[1:19:17] down on your knees until he gives it to
[1:19:19] you because it's yours.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; You just haven't followed through.
[1:19:24] Right.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; You haven't followed through.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; It's there.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; He's already given it.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; He can't give it twice.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I'm persuaded that nothing can take me
[1:19:42] from the love of God. If he's given it
[1:19:44] to you, he's given it to you.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; If he's given you, you're healing,
[1:19:48] brother. You're healed regardless
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; of circumstance. Regardless of what you
[1:19:54] see, regardless of what the doctors tell
[1:19:56] you, regardless of what your body does,
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; regardless of any of that, you're
[1:20:01] healed.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; If he comes to you and gives you that
[1:20:05] revelation in your heart that you are
[1:20:07] delivered from alcohol and drugs, no
[1:20:10] matter the cravings, no matter the
[1:20:12] withdrawals and the shaking and the
[1:20:14] kicking and the fighting, you're
[1:20:16] delivered.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:20:22] No matter that voice that comes into
[1:20:24] your head saying, "Well, this ain't for
[1:20:26] you." Well, if he's telling you it's not
[1:20:28] for you, then that ought to make it
[1:20:30] pretty sure to you it's for you.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he wouldn't bother telling
[1:20:34] you it ain't.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; He's not going to Why would he bother
[1:20:38] telling his own child that something He
[1:20:41] knows they're not going to go for it
[1:20:42] anyway.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; He's not after them. He's after us. And
[1:20:46] that's why he tells us and that's why he
[1:20:49] makes it easy for the doubt to sink in.
[1:20:51] He He makes it easy because we're human.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; We're heavenly creatures stuck in a
[1:20:59] human body and our whole life is spent
[1:21:02] finding the easiest way to do stuff.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; It is. Where do you think our technology
[1:21:08] come from?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; We decided we didn't like walking and
[1:21:13] running, so we started riding horses. It
[1:21:15] was faster. It was easier. Well, then we
[1:21:17] decided even that wasn't good enough.
[1:21:19] So, we come up with cars and those won't
[1:21:21] weren't fast enough. So, we come up with
[1:21:22] even faster cars. And then we got trains
[1:21:25] and planes and spaceships because it's
[1:21:27] easy.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; It's easier.
[1:21:31] It's easier to get a C in school than do
[1:21:33] your best and get the A you know you can
[1:21:35] get.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Which gets me because we should do the
[1:21:40] best at everything we're do. We're
[1:21:41] children of God.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; All right. I I tell you what, and this
[1:21:48] is going to be kind of blunt, but I'm
[1:21:50] glad my God didn't get seized.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; When my God done something, he was the
[1:21:57] best at it.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; No questions asked.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; And if we're a part of him,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; we'll give everything we got, too.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And if a C is the best that you can do,
[1:22:09] well, praise the Lord. But if you can do
[1:22:11] better, do better.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord, help me.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; I have told my kids and especially
[1:22:21] Colton,
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter if you agree to do
[1:22:25] something for a dollar or a $100, you do
[1:22:29] it the best you can because you said you
[1:22:32] would do it. You agreed to do it.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't matter how much you're
[1:22:36] getting paid. And if the guy sitting
[1:22:38] next to you is making three times you
[1:22:39] are, you had better outwork that guy.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; That's the way I see it.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; That one was free. But
[1:22:56] Lord help me. They're wedding vows
[1:23:00] and he holds us to a standard.
[1:23:03] That's why he gives us little things in
[1:23:06] here.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Don't do this. Do this.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; It's not because he's a jailer. It's
[1:23:15] because he's given us the freedom to
[1:23:17] live this life.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And know when to stop,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; To know how to act.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:30] Because as queens,
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; we are ambassadors.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; I studied kings and queens kingdoms. The
[1:23:39] queen is always the one. The king went
[1:23:41] and fought. Nobody wanted the king to
[1:23:43] come. They wanted a diplomat. They
[1:23:45] wanted the queen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; We are the ambassador to the world.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; We are the one that says
[1:23:55] our God is true freedom. Okay.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; But how would we know how to explain
[1:24:01] that if he didn't tell us don't do this,
[1:24:05] don't do that, this is right, this is
[1:24:07] wrong.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; How could he redeem us from our sins if
[1:24:12] there wasn't nothing to tell us what our
[1:24:13] sins were?
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; It's
[1:24:17] come on.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; It's not dos and don'ts.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; When I when I was young, that's what I
[1:24:25] thought and I was like, I'm going to I
[1:24:27] can't live that. I'm going to live my
[1:24:28] life any old way I can. And boy did that
[1:24:33] come back to haunt me.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; You don't want to live this life your
[1:24:39] way.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; You really don't.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; But if you live it God's way,
[1:24:48] you can walk this earth and not worry
[1:24:50] about sickness.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You can walk this earth and not worry
[1:24:54] about losing.
[1:24:56] You can live on this earth because we
[1:24:58] have to until we get out of it without
[1:25:00] any care
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; in this world because he said this was
[1:25:07] right. Therefore, it's right.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; So, as long as I'm under the blood of
[1:25:11] Jesus Christ and I am doing my best to
[1:25:15] do the leading of the Lord, I am going
[1:25:17] to be okay. And if that ain't freedom,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; okay?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; All right. I don't know what is.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; To me, that's freedom.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; You know, we always say, teach your kids
[1:25:34] boundaries. That way, they can be free
[1:25:35] within the boundaries. They know what
[1:25:36] they're supposed to do. Well, isn't that
[1:25:38] what that's teaching us?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Boundaries.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; It's teaching us how to live our lives
[1:25:46] with honesty and integrity.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; How to live our lives as children of the
[1:25:53] king. Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; To be worthy to be called a queen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it,
[1:26:06] but he gave it to me.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; He married me. He gave me his vows.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And I can be free.
[1:26:19] I can be free to be quiet. I can be free
[1:26:22] to say nothing.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I can be free to love my wife and know
[1:26:26] what real love is.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; I can be free to know when I'm getting
[1:26:31] real love in return.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Not something fake, not something
[1:26:35] because you can tell when you stay in
[1:26:38] the presence of God and you stay in the
[1:26:40] scriptures and you stay in the message,
[1:26:42] believe it or not, the uncertain sound,
[1:26:45] you'll hear it.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; When somebody comes up to you and starts
[1:26:48] talking, you'll be like, "Something's
[1:26:50] wrong with that. Uhhuh.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Whether it's scripture or not, you'll
[1:26:53] know when a car salesman starts telling
[1:26:55] trying to sell you a bad car.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will come up and say,
[1:26:58] "Whoa."
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; You know, something don't sound right
[1:27:01] about what he's saying.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I mean, he will.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham said, "Stay
[1:27:06] neutral. Follow the leading of the Lord.
[1:27:09] Don't pray one way or the other.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And just be neutral and say, "Lord,
[1:27:12] whatever you want." And then as he
[1:27:14] starts leading you one way, go into
[1:27:16] that. But wait. Then if he still feel
[1:27:18] like he's leading it to you, then wait
[1:27:21] and then do it. I mean, that that's what
[1:27:24] he said. We and April looked it up the
[1:27:25] other night. I thought that was awesome
[1:27:27] because every other time he said, "Don't
[1:27:28] be neutral. Don't be neutral." You know,
[1:27:31] you get the word of God, don't be
[1:27:32] neutral. You have healing, don't be
[1:27:34] neutral. Don't set on the fence and go,
[1:27:35] "Well, maybe."
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; But in that one spot when you pray, be
[1:27:40] neutral. That's awesome.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Every word, by the way.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:51] We have to be married to him now.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; There's no getting around it. We must
[1:27:59] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; that's blunt, but it's the truth.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; there ain't time left in this world. And
[1:28:16] I know every age has said that.
[1:28:18] Preachers have said that for as long as
[1:28:19] I can remember.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; But you look at the world now.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Versus the when we were kids.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And you see the difference.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; He can't let it go any longer or he
[1:28:34] would have to raise up Sodom and
[1:28:35] Gomorrah
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and then apologize to them.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; But he's never wrong.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; So the time is short.
[1:28:46] really really short.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, it can be 50 years. That
[1:28:52] short,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; but I have a feeling it's more like
[1:28:57] tomorrow. Tonight,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; maybe before we get done with this
[1:29:02] service,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; okay? We must, we must, we must, we must
[1:29:09] have the Holy Spirit now
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; because that is the only thing
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; that is going to make this
[1:29:18] live to get us out of here.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit
[1:29:25] is what makes this a living word.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Without the Holy
[1:29:33] Spirit, we can quote it. We can read it.
[1:29:36] We can run with it. We can tell
[1:29:38] everybody. We can do all this stuff. And
[1:29:41] believe it or not,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; you may make it to heaven, but it won't
[1:29:47] be in the rapture.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And that's hard. But I'm not going to
[1:29:52] apologize for it because it's the truth.
[1:29:55] So if you remotely think that there's a
[1:29:58] chance
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; that you don't have that Holy Spirit,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; don't stop until you get it.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; That's true, brother.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And that brings us all the way back
[1:30:07] around to the start of this. I love to
[1:30:10] hear my wife talk.
[1:30:12] And I know she thinks I'm nuts. She
[1:30:14] thinks I'm crazy. She's like, "Yeah,
[1:30:15] you're not listening." No, I'm
[1:30:16] listening. I hear every word she says.
[1:30:20] So does God.
[1:30:22] He loves it when you ask him.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; He loves it when you talk to him. He
[1:30:28] loves it when you tell him your
[1:30:30] problems. He already knows him. He's
[1:30:32] already has the fix for him. But he
[1:30:34] absolutely loves it.
[1:30:38] Basically, when you complain to him,
[1:30:40] when you gripe to him about this and
[1:30:42] about that and Lord, I don't know what's
[1:30:44] going on. I need your help. This is
[1:30:46] happening. That's happening. He's like,
[1:30:48] "Don't worry. I've got it all in
[1:30:49] control." And you say, "Yeah, I know. I
[1:30:50] trust you. I just needed to get it off
[1:30:52] my chest. Right? He's your husband. He
[1:30:56] loves it. So if there's a chance, a
[1:30:58] remote chance, don't stop bugging him
[1:31:03] until he gives it to you.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Don't stop crying for it. Don't stop
[1:31:08] reaching for it. Don't stop asking for
[1:31:11] it
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; just because you're like, "Well, I've
[1:31:13] been asking for six months." Then ask
[1:31:15] another month. That may be the month you
[1:31:17] needed.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:20] Never ever stop asking and never stop
[1:31:24] believing that today is the day he vowed
[1:31:28] it right here, right now.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "You are my wife and I am your
[1:31:33] husband and I bow to you. You are
[1:31:36] healed. You are delivered. You are
[1:31:38] saved. You have the Holy Ghost."
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "I shall get it." So to me,
[1:31:43] that means I've got it because if I
[1:31:45] shall get it, then he already gave it to
[1:31:47] me before the foundation of the world.
[1:31:49] So, don't stop asking for it until you
[1:31:52] know that you know that you know and
[1:31:55] you're like, "Well, brother, how do I
[1:31:57] know?" Because you will never be the
[1:32:01] same.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Your desires have changed, your wants
[1:32:06] are changed, your thoughts are changed,
[1:32:08] your movements have changed, the way you
[1:32:10] walk a change. The way I walk, look at
[1:32:13] Jacob.
[1:32:18] Yes. Because you will no longer walk
[1:32:20] toward this. You'll walk toward him.
[1:32:24] You'll no longer walk toward the bar.
[1:32:28] You'll walk to church. You'll no longer
[1:32:31] And you'll want to
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; see there's the kicker.
[1:32:35] You'll want to, brother. There'll be
[1:32:38] something inside of you that burns so
[1:32:40] much that if you don't bust through the
[1:32:42] doors of them church, you're going to
[1:32:44] bust
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; that desire that's in you. But you we
[1:32:49] cannot leave it if the musicians come.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; We cannot leave it to Sunday and
[1:32:57] Wednesday.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; we can't just serve God two days a week.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; we can't just believe two days a week.
[1:33:06] And we can't just put it off until this
[1:33:08] and put it off until that. It's now
[1:33:11] today.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever that you need.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Whatever that you need, he has already
[1:33:18] given it to you.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; But are you going to stay in his
[1:33:23] presence long enough to get it? Are you
[1:33:26] going to stay in his presence long
[1:33:28] enough to see the fulfillment of his
[1:33:32] word?
[1:33:34] You say, "Well, brother, I've been
[1:33:36] believing a long time." Well, just keep
[1:33:37] believing.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; I've been at this a long time. Just keep
[1:33:42] believing
[1:33:44] because today is the day.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And you can say that every day and it
[1:33:50] still be the truth. Today's the day.
[1:33:54] because
[1:33:56] I had well my mom told me one time I was
[1:34:00] upset about something and I was like
[1:34:02] well mom it don't matter I've gone up
[1:34:04] for prayer for my eyes you know I've
[1:34:06] gone up for prayer I've gone up for pray
[1:34:07] it never happened so I don't really need
[1:34:09] two eyes I ain't going to worry about it
[1:34:11] she said son
[1:34:13] you went up for prayer for healing I was
[1:34:16] like yeah mom I did she said well how do
[1:34:19] you know he didn't heal you from some
[1:34:21] bug that was going to kill you.
[1:34:25] How do you know he didn't heal you for
[1:34:27] something in your body that you had no
[1:34:29] idea was in there?
[1:34:31] And I thought about that and then
[1:34:33] dismissed it,
[1:34:35] kids, right? But as I grow older, I got
[1:34:38] to realize it.
[1:34:41] When you ask God for something and he
[1:34:44] gives it to you, don't expect it your
[1:34:46] way.
[1:34:49] Expect it his way.
[1:34:51] It's yours.
[1:34:53] And today's the day
[1:34:56] and his mercies are new every day as the
[1:34:59] brother preached every single morning.
[1:35:03] So no matter how much Satan comes at us
[1:35:05] and no matter what he throws at us and
[1:35:07] no matter what we feel like, no matter
[1:35:10] what our bodies say, no matter what any
[1:35:12] of that happens.
[1:35:15] I've been blind in one eye supposedly by
[1:35:17] doctors
[1:35:19] since I was 15 months old.
[1:35:23] But even if I never see it,
[1:35:27] I will believe every day of my life
[1:35:30] that I have two perfectly good eyes
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; because he said it
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; and I believe what he said.
[1:35:42] But but it's not
[1:35:44] this that believes it.
[1:35:48] It's this. It's the Holy Spirit
[1:35:52] that he put down into my heart on the
[1:35:54] side of that mountain
[1:35:58] that changed the way I thought about it.
[1:36:03] I no longer
[1:36:06] fight with it. Let me put it that way.
[1:36:10] He said it. I believe it. And that's the
[1:36:13] end of it. I won't question God.
[1:36:18] I won't question the scriptures. I won't
[1:36:21] question my wedding vows that he gave to
[1:36:24] me,
[1:36:28] but I won't stop
[1:36:31] a day short.
[1:36:35] Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; This is where the Bible says, "Help my
[1:36:39] unbelief." It It's not that we because
[1:36:41] he said, "I believe, but Lord, help
[1:36:45] Help
[1:36:49] us keep believing when we're tired. Help
[1:36:52] us keep standing when it seems like we
[1:36:55] ought to just fall. To help us keep
[1:36:59] saying the word is true when it looks
[1:37:02] like it's not
[1:37:05] because it's true.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. No matter what you see, no
[1:37:10] matter what you feel,
[1:37:12] every single promise in this love letter
[1:37:17] is a vow to you. It's an earnest. It's
[1:37:20] an inheritance of something else that's
[1:37:23] coming.
[1:37:25] We have a body that is not going to get
[1:37:27] sick. It's not going to be frail.
[1:37:32] It
[1:37:34] It's not going to be deceived. It's not
[1:37:36] going to believe the wrong things. It's
[1:37:38] not going to
[1:37:43] But he promised us we could go through
[1:37:45] this life and the signs would follow us.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; He gave us the promise.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; So, let's trust him.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Let's believe him. And let's act like
[1:38:00] every single minute that that is when it
[1:38:02] happens.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what, we're going to
[1:38:06] have the joy of our salvation when it
[1:38:09] feels like we're lost. Have be happy
[1:38:12] when the world is falling apart. Act
[1:38:14] like we're young when we're not. Even
[1:38:17] though that hurts sometimes, but that's
[1:38:18] a lie because you know this body lies.
[1:38:21] But God don't.
[1:38:26] We're queens.
[1:38:32] And as a queen, we have everything
[1:38:35] that's his.
[1:38:41] Everything.
[1:38:43] It's our kingdom along with his.
[1:38:48] And you do not absolutely do not have to
[1:38:53] ever let Satan squat in your kingdom.
[1:38:57] That's right.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; You can kick him out
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; anytime you want to.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean he's going to go easy. He's
[1:39:06] a good adversary, but he must go.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Resist and the devil will flee.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; It didn't say when,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; but it said he would.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when he looked at
[1:39:22] that and he said, "Boo." It got a little
[1:39:23] smaller. He said boo again and it got a
[1:39:26] little smaller. First time he said boo,
[1:39:28] it didn't disappear. He had to keep
[1:39:30] pushing and keep resisting.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And never ever lose your faith
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; because on day 41,
[1:39:43] on day 41, the sun came out.
[1:39:48] When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness
[1:39:51] on day 41, the angels ministered to him.
[1:39:59] I'm not saying it's 41 days. I'm just
[1:40:01] saying don't quit at day 40 because day
[1:40:03] 41 just might be the day.
[1:40:08] I hope that this isn't too sporadic.
[1:40:15] But if we could ever truly get the
[1:40:17] revelation that we are the queen of
[1:40:20] heaven,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; that's not a lie. That's not make
[1:40:26] believe. That is not fantasy.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; We are the queen.
[1:40:40] Man, that ought to just shove our faith
[1:40:42] right up into the heavenly places.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; We're the queen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; We're the chosen one.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; We're the one that he said, "I do. I
[1:40:52] love you so much. I want to spend
[1:40:54] eternity with you."
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Not just a lifetime.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Anybody that wants to spend an eternity
[1:41:02] with me,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I'm all for that.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Don't give up.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hold fast. Stand on the word
[1:41:11] of God.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Stand on it.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Stand on it. Seems like every sermon I
[1:41:15] ministered, it comes back to it. But
[1:41:17] keep standing. Keep believing because
[1:41:21] it's here.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; We're going home.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham said, "Watch
[1:41:27] Israel. They're our clock.
[1:41:30] We're going home." Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; But stay in his presence.
[1:41:42] Every minute of every day,
[1:41:45] stay in his presence.
[1:41:48] And when you feel like you absolutely
[1:41:50] can't get no more, cry for more.
[1:41:56] You can never have too much of a good
[1:41:58] thing. And this brothers and sisters is
[1:42:02] the best thing.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Brother Windle.
[1:42:20] Jesus is mine.
[1:42:24] He's been my fourth man in the fire time
[1:42:30] after time.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, born of his spirit.
[1:42:39] Washed in his blood.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Washed in his blood.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And what he did for me on Cal is more
[1:42:49] than enough.
[1:42:52] Oh, I trust in God,
[1:42:56] my savior.
[1:42:58] The one, the one who will never
[1:43:03] fail.
[1:43:07] He will never fail.
[1:43:11] I trust in God,
[1:43:14] my savior. Jesus
[1:43:19] who will never
[1:43:22] fail
[1:43:26] never fail.
[1:43:30] Lord our compassion.
[1:43:34] Oh all is at rest.
[1:43:39] I know we off the rough tomorrow.
[1:43:44] daughter, my st.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my my.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my story.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; This is my story.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; This is my song.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Praising my ris king and savior all
[1:44:04] the day long. Oh, I trust in God,
[1:44:09] my savior,
[1:44:12] the one
[1:44:14] who will never
[1:44:17] fail.
[1:44:20] You will never fail.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; I'll trust in God.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; I trust you.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; I say I trust your
[1:44:31] Yeah.
[1:44:38] You'll never fail or fail.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. I sought the Lord.
[1:44:46] He heard. He answered. I sought the
[1:44:50] Lord. He heard me.
[1:44:53] I sought the Lord. Heard.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; That's why I trust him. That's why I
[1:45:02] trust him. I sought the Lord. He heard
[1:45:06] the answer.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; I sought the Lord. He heard.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. I sought the Lord.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[1:45:16] you.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; That's why I trust him. That's why I
[1:45:20] trust in God,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; myior,
[1:45:26] the one who will never
[1:45:30] fail.
[1:45:34] fail.
[1:45:38] I trust in God,
[1:45:41] my savior,
[1:45:43] the one
[1:45:45] who will never
[1:45:48] fail.
[1:45:52] He will never fail.
[1:45:59] Glory to God.
[1:46:01] Glory.
[1:46:05] Hallelujah.
[1:46:08] Oh, the revelation that I am his and he
[1:46:11] is mine.
[1:46:14] The revelation. What revelation it was
[1:46:17] for Job to stand there. My redeemer
[1:46:21] lives
[1:46:23] and I will stand on that day with him.
[1:46:29] What was it? He had a revelation of that
[1:46:31] blood sacrifice and he was going through
[1:46:33] his trial. But when Jehovah came down on
[1:46:36] that whirlwind and began to talk to him
[1:46:38] and said, "I want you to stand up like a
[1:46:40] man and I want you to answer me like a
[1:46:42] man." Amen. And he and and and and God
[1:46:45] just started talking to him and said,
[1:46:47] "Where were you before the foundation of
[1:46:49] the world when the sons of God, Amen,
[1:46:52] were around the throne and and shouting
[1:46:54] for joy? Where were you, Job?"
[1:46:57] Hallelujah.
[1:46:58] And by the time it was all said and
[1:47:00] done, then he could stand up and said,
[1:47:02] "I had heard of him with mine ears, but
[1:47:06] now mine eyes have seen him." It's a
[1:47:09] divine revelation.
[1:47:12] Glory to God. The revelation that I am
[1:47:15] becoming one with him. It's an invisible
[1:47:19] union of the earthly bride and the
[1:47:22] heavenly groom. It's his word and we are
[1:47:24] accepting it into our hearts.
[1:47:27] This is real folks. We are taking God's

[1:55:01] I I just want us to pray. You know, the
[1:55:04] devil's been after that Parker family uh
[1:55:06] for the last little while. The uh Sam
[1:55:09] just had a couple of trailers stolen,
[1:55:11] plum full of material,
[1:55:14] plum full, thousands of dollars.
[1:55:18] and uh they pulled up on the job getting

[1:55:47] brother Sam and and the family
[1:55:50] when Satan's fighting. Uh we we all need
[1:55:53] to be together as a church and and just
[1:55:55] really
[1:55:57] really ask the Lord to to be with them.
[1:56:01] And we're not just asking, but but we're
[1:56:03] also we have authority, and the devil
[1:56:06] knows that authority. And we enter into
[1:56:09] those heavenly places in prayer and we
[1:56:12] Amen. I I I believe the anointing of the
[1:56:14] Lord is upon this bride. I do. And uh
[1:56:18] that God's grace is is is going to be
[1:56:21] with Brother Sam. We love Brother Sam
[1:56:25] and uh uh the whole the whole Parker
[1:56:29] family. And so um in fact, why don't we

[1:56:42] So brother Rory is in the hospital. We
[1:56:44] all know brother Rory. I mean he's he's

[1:56:53] Lord, we have prayed
[1:56:55] often for brother Sam. And
[1:56:58] Lord, it I know Satan's just hit in
[1:57:00] every which direction just bombarding
[1:57:03] them, Lord. And
[1:57:06] but now Lord you see the old patriarch
[1:57:09] Lord I pray right now that the Holy
[1:57:12] Spirit

[1:57:47] place. Lord, turn that turn that
[1:57:51] situation,
[1:57:52] let him feel your presence, Lord. Satan,
[1:57:56] you're a liar. You can't have his life
[1:57:58] and you cannot have the Parker family.
[1:58:02] They have stood for you, Lord. They've
[1:58:05] they have blessed your bride. They've
[1:58:08] been such faithful men and women. And I
[1:58:12] ask God that you would help them right

[1:58:21] hours away. But God, I just pray that
[1:58:24] you would, Lord, that this same God that
[1:58:27] we feel in this service would just
[1:58:29] settle down right now, Lord, there in
[1:58:31] Witchah.
[1:58:33] And I pray, Father,
[1:58:36] oh God, we thank you for it. There's no
[1:58:40] plans that Satan has that can come to
[1:58:43] fruion.
[1:58:45] For Lord, you are the author of our life
[1:58:49] and you're the author of our tomorrow.
