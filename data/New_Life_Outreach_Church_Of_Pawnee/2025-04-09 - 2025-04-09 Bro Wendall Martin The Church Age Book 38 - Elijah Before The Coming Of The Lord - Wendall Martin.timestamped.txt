[4:15] did not have a doubt. I just knew that
[4:19] the Lord would bring me
[4:22] out. Oh, so I got down on my knees. I
[4:27] said, "Lord, help me please." And I got
[4:31] up singing and shouting,
[4:35] "Victory." Oh, victory is
[4:39] mine. Victory is
[4:42] mine. Victory today. Thank God it's
[4:46] mine.

[5:33] the Lord would bring me
[5:35] out. Oh. So I got down on my knees. I
[5:40] said, "Lord, won't you help me, please?"
[5:43] And I got up singing and shouting,
[5:48] "Victory." Oh, now victory is mine. Oh,
[5:53] victory is mine. Yes, it is. Oh, victory
[5:57] today. It is
[6:00] mine. For

[8:28] softly. Like to go to prayer tonight.
[8:30] I'm going ask brother Ken if you would
[8:32] mind leading us in prayer. We do have
[8:34] many requests here tonight. One from
[8:36] sister Tracy says, "Please remember my
[8:39] sister Brenda and Sister Karen. Both are
[8:42] having problems with one of their knees
[8:45] and the pain is bad." So let's bind
[8:47] together for Sister Tracy's family.
[8:50] Also, sister Angie Bindabout is not
[8:54] feeling well tonight. So, let's remember
[8:56] her and and for all the ones that are
[8:58] traveling to the wedding tonight and
[9:00] today, let's just remember them. Also,
[9:03] one from Sister Carol says, "My
[9:05] granddaughter
[9:07] Carlina or my daughter Carlina, right?
[9:10] I'm sorry. She's got CO." So, let's
[9:12] remember her. Then she says, "My
[9:14] granddaughters." And then my good friend
[9:16] Donna for the Lord to intervene. Also,
[9:20] let's continue to remember brother Harry
[9:22] as he's looking for a job and transition
[9:25] right now. I know the Lord's give him
[9:27] can give him the right job tonight.
[9:29] Amen. Also, I had a a uh report from
[9:33] brother John Scott. He said the surgery
[9:37] went great. Doctor said it went very
[9:39] smoothly. Now, we're praying for good
[9:42] healing power for her as well. She is at
[9:45] home resting. We had a
[9:48] She had surgery. You know when it was
[9:50] exactly? We've been praying for her for
[9:52] the last few
[9:53] weeks. Yeah. Right after our camp. So,
[9:57] let's remember all these needs. And if
[9:59] you have a need upon your heart, just
[10:01] make it known by the lift of your hand.
[10:03] God bless you
[10:06] now. Let's bow our heads.
[10:09] Lord Jesus, you're worthy of all praise.
[10:12] Father, you're the healer, Lord. And we
[10:16] have needs here tonight,
[10:17] Lord. I don't remember them all, but I
[10:20] know that Sister Tracy and Sister Carol
[10:22] and and they they have friends and loved
[10:27] ones, Lord, that need a touch from you,
[10:30] Lord. And and the one that needs
[10:32] traveling mercies, Lord, travel with
[10:34] them. Travel with each and every one of
[10:38] the believers out there, Lord. Keep them
[10:40] safe.
[10:42] And help Brother Harry, Lord.
[10:45] I know the feeling. I've been there many
[10:47] a time, Lord. He needs a job. He's got a
[10:51] big family and he needs he needs you to
[10:56] provide, Lord. And we know that you are
[10:57] the
[10:58] provider. You said you would and we
[11:00] believe it. We're trusting on you, Lord.
[11:04] We ask, Lord, that you'd speak through
[11:06] our minister tonight, Lord. Give him the
[11:09] right words. Let it be from you, Lord.
[11:14] Just be with him, Lord, and be with this
[11:17] service, Lord. Let your Holy Spirit just
[11:20] hoover over us, Lord. In the name of the
[11:23] Lord Jesus Christ, we commit this
[11:24] service to you.
[11:28] Amen. Amen. As we get ready for the man
[11:31] of God, can we sing this? I'm a
[11:34] pilgrim and a
[11:37] stranger or wandering through this world
[11:41] of sin.
[11:44] I board my
[11:45] [Music]
[11:58] way. Go marching
[12:02] in. When the saints go maring in.
[12:08] Oh Lord, I know I'll be in that
[12:13] number. Will the saints go marching in?
[12:18] Verse two now. Oh, I know I'll see my
[12:24] Savior.
[12:26] For if my life is free from
[12:31] sin, heaven's doors will open for me.
[12:38] Will the
[12:40] saints chin
[12:43] in? Oh, will the
[12:46] saint go marching
[12:49] in with the saint?
[12:56] [Music]
[13:18] [Music]
[13:29] [Music]
[13:45] Get it back on. Sorry. Amen. And uh but
[13:50] we're so we're so thankful for the grace
[13:52] of God upon our lives and and um Amen.
[13:57] It won't be too much longer and it will
[13:59] be time to go. Amen. And so u we're so
[14:03] so excited about that. And friends, this
[14:06] is not a myth. Uh this is this is very
[14:09] very real. And um we want to prepare for
[14:13] the coming of the Lord. Amen. because um
[14:17] uh there will be a time when there will
[14:19] be a roll call and and we'll answer amen
[14:23] to that roll call and I I want to make
[14:26] sure that my name is there. Amen. Amen.
[14:29] Well, let's let's look here in in um
[14:32] we're we're going to read in in Malachi
[14:36] the 4th
[14:37] chapter and
[14:39] um uh and
[14:41] then we will
[14:44] uh uh start at then we're going to be on
[14:47] page
[14:48] 324 in the new in the red books. It'll
[14:52] be um page
[14:55] 369. And um now the last time it's it's
[14:59] been um oh my goodness it's it's it's
[15:02] been a few weeks since since our since
[15:04] we started uh the Leoysan age. And so
[15:07] the last time we were on we we dealt a
[15:10] little bit with the messenger. And so um
[15:13] I want to deal again this evening u uh
[15:18] with the messenger. And um uh but let's
[15:21] let's look here at Malachi 4 and 1. This
[15:25] is a prophecy concerning today. For
[15:28] behold, the day cometh that shall burn
[15:31] as an oven, and all the proud, and yay,
[15:34] all that do wickedly shall be stubble,
[15:38] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[15:41] up, sayaeth the Lord, that it shall
[15:44] neither uh it shall leave them neither
[15:47] root nor branch. Now, that's that's
[15:49] coming of the fire that's that holy fire
[15:52] that's going to be cleansing the earth.
[15:54] But unto you that fear my name, shall
[15:59] shall the son of
[16:01] righteousness arise with healing in his
[16:04] wings, and ye shall go forth and grow up
[16:07] as calves in the stall. So, right before
[16:10] this happens, the sen of God is going to
[16:13] come, and he's fixing to tell us how
[16:16] this son of righteousness is going to
[16:18] come with healing in his wings. It's
[16:20] going to come through Elijah the
[16:22] prophet. So, while the world is
[16:25] preparing to burn, there's going to be a
[16:27] group of people that God is going to
[16:30] prepare to miss the destruction and to
[16:34] be ready for a
[16:36] rapture. And it says, "And you,"
[16:39] somebody say,
[16:41] "meou shall tread down the wicked, for
[16:45] they shall be ashes under the souls of
[16:47] your feet in the day that I shall do
[16:50] this, sayaeth the Lord." So, here's
[16:52] coming the burning. Amen. But God's
[16:55] going to come and prepare you. He's
[16:58] going to take you out into safety. And
[17:01] then we are coming back upon the earth
[17:04] after it has all been burnt and all the
[17:06] evil's been burnt off. And we are going
[17:10] to walk out on the ashes of the wicked.
[17:14] Amen. And remember uh uh remember ye the
[17:18] law of Moses my servant which I
[17:21] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[17:23] Israel with the statutes and judgments.
[17:26] Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[17:31] before the coming of the great and
[17:34] dreadful day of the Lord. Now what is
[17:36] this great and dreadful day of the Lord?
[17:38] It's the day of judgment. And he shall
[17:41] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[17:43] children, and the heart of the children
[17:46] to their fathers, lest I come and smite
[17:48] the earth with a curse. Now, brother,
[17:51] there there's there there's two things
[17:53] that's happening. Judgment is happening,
[17:56] and then there is safety that God is
[17:58] providing for us. And we're living in
[18:00] that day right now. Let's go to the Lord
[18:02] in prayer. Father, we want to thank you
[18:05] today for your goodness and your amazing
[18:08] love to us. We ask Lord that you would
[18:12] Lord that you would open the eyes of our
[18:14] understanding tonight Lord even more and
[18:17] that we would appreciate what you have
[18:19] given us and what you have done for us.
[18:22] I pray Lord that your anointing would be
[18:24] here in a real special way that you
[18:27] would help the uh all of our spiritual
[18:31] ears Lord those that are traveling today
[18:33] I ask that you would be with them. Ask
[18:36] Lord that you would you would just uh
[18:39] strengthen all of your saints Lord in
[18:42] our congregation. We love you Lord. Have
[18:44] preeminence tonight in Jesus name we
[18:47] pray. Can the church say amen? Amen. God
[18:50] bless you. You may be seated here this
[18:54] evening. Amen.
[18:58] So we
[19:00] um so we're on on page uh
[19:05] 324 and
[19:07] um and I'm not going to read uh just a a
[19:11] very lengthy passage, but let's let's
[19:14] start here down here at the u the second
[19:17] down at the last
[19:18] paragraph. It says, "So we see a seventh
[19:22] age messenger coming and he is a
[19:24] prophet."
[19:25] Not only do we see this messenger coming
[19:28] here in Revelations 10:7, but we find
[19:31] that the word speaks of Elijah coming
[19:33] before Jesus returns in Matthew
[19:37] 17:10. His disciples asked him, saying,
[19:40] "Why then say the scribes that Elias
[19:43] must first come?" And Jesus said, "Elias
[19:47] truly shall first come and restore all
[19:51] things." But before our Lord Jesus or
[19:54] before the coming of our Lord Elijah
[19:57] must come back for a work of restoration
[19:59] in the church. This is what uh Malachi
[20:03] 45 and six says. Behold, I will send you
[20:06] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[20:08] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[20:11] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[20:13] fathers to the children and the heart of
[20:15] the children to their fathers, lest I
[20:17] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[20:20] There is absolutely no doubt that Elijah
[20:22] must return before the coming of Jesus.
[20:25] He has a specific work to accomplish.
[20:28] That work is the part of Malachi 4:6
[20:31] that says he will turn the hearts of the
[20:34] children to their fathers. The reason we
[20:37] know this is his specific work uh that
[20:41] we know this is his specific work to do
[20:44] at that time is because he has already
[20:46] accomplished the part that says he shall
[20:49] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[20:51] children when the Elijah ministry was
[20:54] here in John the Baptist
[20:57] u Luke
[20:58] 1:17 and he shall go before him in the
[21:01] spirit and power of Elijah to turn the
[21:04] hearts of the fathers to the children
[21:06] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[21:09] just to make ready a people prepared for
[21:12] the Lord. In the ministry of John, the
[21:15] hearts of the father were fathers were
[21:17] turned to the
[21:19] children. We know that because Jesus
[21:21] said so. But it does not say that the
[21:24] hearts of the children were turned to
[21:26] the fathers. That is yet to take place.
[21:30] The hearts of the last day children will
[21:32] be turned back to the Pentecostal
[21:35] fathers. John got the fathers ready for
[21:37] Jesus to welcome the children into the
[21:40] fold. Now this prophet upon whom the
[21:43] spirit of Elijah falls will prepare the
[21:46] children to welcome back Jesus. Jesus
[21:50] called John the Baptist Elijah. Matthew
[21:53] 12 or 17:12. But I say unto you, Elijah
[21:57] is come already, and ye they knew him
[22:00] not, but I've done unto him whatsoever
[22:03] they listed. The reason that he called
[22:06] John Elijah was because the same spirit
[22:10] that was upon Elijah had come back upon
[22:13] John. Even as that same as that spirit
[22:17] had come back upon Elisha after the
[22:19] reign of King
[22:21] Ahab. Now once again that spirit will
[22:24] come back upon another man just before
[22:27] Jesus comes. He will be a prophet. He
[22:31] will be vindicated as such by God. Since
[22:34] Jesus himself in the flesh won't be here
[22:37] to vindicate him as he did John. It will
[22:41] be done by the Holy Spirit so that this
[22:44] prophet's ministry will be attended by
[22:47] great and wonderful manifestations. As a
[22:50] prophet, every revelation will be
[22:52] vindicated. For every revelation will
[22:54] come to pass. Wonderful acts of power
[22:58] will be performed at his commands in
[23:01] faith. Then will be brought forth the
[23:03] message that God had given him in the
[23:07] word to turn the people back to truth
[23:10] and the true power of God. Some will
[23:13] listen, but the majority will run true
[23:16] to form and rejecting. Since this
[23:19] prophet messenger of Revelations 10:7
[23:22] will be the same as Malachi 45 and 6, he
[23:26] will naturally uh be like Elijah and
[23:30] John. Both men
[23:33] uh both were men set apart from the
[23:36] religious accept uh the accepted
[23:38] religious schools of their
[23:40] day. Both were men of the wilderness.
[23:43] Both acted only when they have thus
[23:45] sayaith the Lord. straight from God by
[23:48] revelation. Both lashed out against
[23:51] religious orders and leaders of their
[23:53] day. But not only was that so, they
[23:56] lashed out against all who were corrupt
[23:59] and who corrupt others. Notice both
[24:03] prophesied much against immoral women
[24:05] and their ways. Elijah cried against
[24:08] Jezebel. John rebuked Herodius, Philip's
[24:12] wife. Though he will not be popular, he
[24:15] will be vindicated by God. As God
[24:18] authenticated John and the Holy Ghost
[24:21] authenticated Jesus, we can well expect
[24:24] this man will be first of all
[24:26] authenticated by the spirit working in
[24:29] his life in acts of power that are
[24:32] undisputable and found nowhere else.
[24:35] Jesus himself in returning will
[24:37] authenticate him even as he is as he
[24:41] authenticated John. John witnessed that
[24:44] Jesus was coming and so will this man.
[24:47] Like John witness that Jesus is coming
[24:51] and the very return of Christ will prove
[24:54] that this man indeed was the forerunner
[24:56] of his second coming. This is the final
[24:59] evidence that this indeed is the prophet
[25:02] of Malachi 4. for the end of the gentile
[25:06] period will be Jesus himself
[25:10] appearing. Then it will be too late for
[25:13] those who have rejected him.
[25:17] Now, I want us to um ju just stop here
[25:22] for for a little bit and and I want us
[25:25] to I I want to talk about the messenger
[25:28] uh a little bit further as um um and we
[25:33] and I want to just title this on this
[25:35] church age reading tonight, the um
[25:38] Elijah before the day of the Lord. And
[25:42] um because
[25:44] uh we we uh we must understand the
[25:50] reason that God would send us an Elijah.
[25:54] Now, as we just read there in Malachi 4,
[25:58] Amen. before the day cometh. So I I I
[26:00] want to I I want to talk about that day
[26:02] that is coming, the day of the Lord. and
[26:05] and the the two uh allimp important
[26:09] questions have been what is the day of
[26:11] the Lord and when is the day of the
[26:13] Lord? Well, the day of the Lord is a is
[26:17] a specific time in history. It's going
[26:19] to be amen a time as as Revelations 11
[26:24] and 15 says, "Amen. uh the kingdoms of
[26:27] this world are become the kingdoms of of
[26:30] our God and uh of our Lord and of his
[26:34] Christ and he shall reign uh uh forever
[26:38] and ever. This so this is going to be
[26:41] the time that Jesus comes and takes
[26:45] over. He will be the king. He's not
[26:47] going to be a president. He's not going
[26:49] to be elected. Amen. He will be the king
[26:52] of of the earth. Amen. And I I I want to
[26:56] say also when he become he will also
[26:59] become the judge. Amen. And so today
[27:04] Jesus is the
[27:06] intercessor. He is there to forgive our
[27:08] sins. He is there when we when we pray
[27:11] and ask forgiveness. He is he is
[27:14] faithful to forgive us of our sins. He
[27:16] is compassionate. He is giving us his
[27:19] word and telling us, listen, man, that
[27:22] you you're you're you're you've got too
[27:25] much of that of of the world and sin and
[27:28] the mud of this world on you. Take take
[27:31] my take my blood. Wash wash your
[27:33] garments. I I'm coming after a a people
[27:36] that is pure and honest. Amen. Purify
[27:40] your hearts. Purify your minds. Purify
[27:43] your deeds. But when the day of the Lord
[27:46] comes, he is no longer intercessor. You
[27:50] will never be able to come back and say,
[27:52] "I'm sorry. Well, Lord, I got it wrong.
[27:55] Let let me let me let me go back and
[27:57] redo this. You you've you you I I've
[28:00] I've played around and I played around
[28:02] and you've been merciful and you've been
[28:05] patient and you've been kind, but on
[28:08] that day, he's judge." And the scripture
[28:12] says as we as we read when we started
[28:14] the church ages, his eyes will be a
[28:17] fire, his feet like brass. There there
[28:21] will be no other recourse. There will be
[28:24] no one else to talk to. You can't say,
[28:26] "Well, is there uh can can we uh uh can
[28:30] we appeal this to a higher court?" He is
[28:33] the higher court. The judge will stand
[28:36] there and say, "Either you have have
[28:39] been sincere with me, sincere, and
[28:42] taking my my blood, taking my word to
[28:45] heart." Amen. Or or you've just been
[28:48] playing. You You've been playing around.
[28:51] And and and I want to say, friends, I I
[28:54] don't want to be playing around. I I
[28:56] don't want to I I don't want to get
[28:58] there on that day and say, "Man, I
[29:02] didn't know. I I didn't I I didn't I
[29:04] didn't realize, Amen. that that you were
[29:07] this serious. So God sends us an Elijah.
[29:12] He sends a prophet. And that
[29:16] prophet when you listen to those words,
[29:19] when you listen to any tape from Malachi
[29:23] 4, when you listen and that's the reason
[29:25] I say you ought to be pressing play on a
[29:28] daily basis because when you listen to
[29:32] the prophet that God sent in our day,
[29:35] you'll have an understanding that his
[29:37] heart is, guys, you've got to be ready.
[29:41] The coming of the Lord is coming. The
[29:44] day of the Lord is at hand. And I don't
[29:47] want any of you to show up and say,
[29:50] "Well, I I didn't know." Because on that
[29:53] day, he will be judge. There will be no
[29:58] way that you can stand there and say,
[30:00] "Hey, hey, can I can I can I I know
[30:02] you're merciful." Not that day. Will you
[30:05] be I I know you're patient. Not on that
[30:07] day. His patience will run out. his
[30:12] mercy will run out. And if you have been
[30:15] playing with God and when you come to
[30:18] the day of the Lord, you're under
[30:21] judgment there. There is no recourse.
[30:24] Can you say amen? And so it and it
[30:27] doesn't matter. It doesn't it doesn't
[30:29] matter what the preacher says. It
[30:30] doesn't matter what mama says, what
[30:32] daddy says. You might have been hiding
[30:34] underneath mama's shirt tail or or uh
[30:36] you know uh coattail or or daddy or
[30:39] whatever. It does not matter on that
[30:42] day. You must be ready.
[30:47] And God says, "Before this earth burns
[30:49] up and before I pronounce judgment, I'm
[30:53] going to send
[30:54] Elijah and he's going to take your
[30:57] hearts and he's going to turn you back
[31:00] to the Bible and my blood is going to be
[31:03] real and my power is going to be
[31:06] all ever present to help you.
[31:09] Because the day is coming when you've
[31:12] got to and there will be no more eyes of
[31:14] compassion. There'll be no more high
[31:16] priest. There will be no more
[31:18] intercessor. Amen. So I say today, Amen.
[31:22] Don't play around with God. Can I hear
[31:25] an amen?
[31:27] Don't play around with God. The
[31:30] scripture says on that day, Revelations
[31:33] 22 and 11, it says, "He that is unjust,
[31:37] let him be unjust steal. He that is
[31:40] filthy, let him be filthy steal. And he
[31:44] that is righteous, let him be righteous
[31:48] steal. And he that is holy, let him be
[31:52] holy steal." Amen. And so I'm And that
[31:55] is that's Revelations 22:11. If you want
[31:58] to mark that in your
[31:59] Bibles, that's a good scripture.
[32:02] Amen. Now, amen. So, now, so number
[32:07] number one, Amen. It's the time where
[32:10] the kingdoms of this world will become
[32:12] the kingdoms of our Lord. Number two,
[32:15] the intercessor of the ages will become
[32:17] the judge. Number three, on the day of
[32:20] the Lord, all the nations will be
[32:23] gathered before him. Amen. and rewards
[32:26] and punishment will be pronounced. And
[32:29] he will divide the Amen the elect and
[32:32] and and he will divide the the uh those
[32:36] that have been uh uh good and those who
[32:39] have been evil and Amen. And so that
[32:42] that day is coming. And I want to say
[32:45] the word of the Lord is current. God has
[32:47] never been a Jesus of yesterday. He's
[32:50] Amen. He's very real. and he's current
[32:53] in every age and and every age has been
[32:56] foretold what would take place as we
[32:59] have looked here in in in this uh church
[33:01] age book. Amen. And and at the end of of
[33:05] each age, he's pronounced a blessing and
[33:08] and he is uh uh pronounced and he said
[33:11] uh blessed is he who hath an ear to hear
[33:14] what the spirit sth unto the church. Can
[33:17] you say amen? Amen. But there was also a
[33:20] curse that was given to each who refused
[33:24] the leadership of the spirit given to
[33:26] each age. So God's dealing on a personal
[33:29] level in each one of these ages. He
[33:32] pronounces a curse to those who refuse.
[33:35] He pronounces a blessing to those who
[33:38] who accept. Amen. And I want and then he
[33:42] says, "He that hath an ear," he said it
[33:44] in every church age. He that have an ear
[33:45] to hear what the spirit saith to the
[33:48] church, let him hear. Can you say,
[33:50] "Aren't you glad for that?" And I just
[33:52] want to say, it's the elect who has the
[33:55] ear to hear, to hear the spirit, and to
[34:00] wash their garments. Because if you
[34:02] don't have an ear to hear, you'll always
[34:03] use excuses. You'll always point to say,
[34:06] "Well, but you but look what you're
[34:07] doing. Look what this one's doing. Look
[34:08] what that one's doing. Look what this
[34:09] one's doing." On that day, it's just you
[34:12] and God. On that day there there won't
[34:15] be no preacher. There won't be no mama.
[34:17] There won't be brother Brandham. There
[34:18] won't be an intercessor. There will not
[34:21] be a high priest on that day. It will be
[34:24] judgment.
[34:26] So let us make sure that we are ready.
[34:28] Can you say amen?
[34:31] Now as we as we talk just just real
[34:34] quickly
[34:36] uh uh and and and just go back just just
[34:39] just for a moment. Remember, there was
[34:42] the seven spirits of God before the
[34:44] throne. And each one of those spirits
[34:47] didn't mean there were seven gods. It
[34:49] meant that God had a specific purpose
[34:51] for each one of those ages. Amen. And he
[34:54] come with a specific message to each one
[34:57] of those ages. The message to this last
[35:00] age was prepare. I'm coming.
[35:06] Hallelujah. And you don't you don't get
[35:08] any better than that. prepare. I'm
[35:11] coming. I'm coming. So, amen. We we and
[35:16] and and and and I and I must say also
[35:19] that that the elect of each one of those
[35:21] ages were anointed to live the word of
[35:24] that age. And so, if the word to this
[35:28] age is prepare for I'm coming, there is
[35:31] an anointing for you to
[35:34] prepare and be ready for him to come.
[35:38] There is. So, so it's not it's not uh
[35:41] it's not something where you're that
[35:43] there is a a carrot uh uh in front of
[35:45] the cart and you never reach it. If the
[35:48] anointing of the age is declaring us to
[35:52] get ready, Amen. And how do we make our
[35:55] garments right? The scripture says he we
[35:58] he we uh he washes us with the washing
[36:01] of the water by the word. So the prophet
[36:06] comes in this day, opens the word up and
[36:09] says, "This is what you need to be
[36:11] looking at." Why? So that you can wash
[36:14] your heart, wash your mind, wash every
[36:17] Get ready for he is coming. And I want
[36:19] to say, we're not going to stand We're
[36:22] not going to stand uh uh defiled before
[36:24] God. We're not going to stand sinners
[36:27] before God because the elect is going to
[36:31] take things seriously. They're going to
[36:34] take this word seriously. Amen. They're
[36:37] not going to be playing around and up
[36:38] and down, in and out and all. No, no,
[36:40] no, no, no. They are walking very softly
[36:43] before God. And they're taking advantage
[36:45] of his mercy, his patience, his love,
[36:49] and his word. And they're washing
[36:51] attitudes. They're washing their mind.
[36:53] They're washing their sins. They're
[36:55] putting everything off because we know
[36:59] he is coming.
[37:02] Praise the Lord.
[37:05] Now, as we as we
[37:08] talk, I want us to really look because
[37:10] the scripture says that deception would
[37:14] be really strong in this age. Matthew 24
[37:17] and 24. Uh, and and I will turn there. I
[37:20] I uh since we're not looking at on the
[37:22] on the board tonight, let's let's just
[37:24] turn there. We'll we'll take a few
[37:25] minutes. um Matthew
[37:29] 24 and
[37:33] um let's see here the tw you you've read
[37:37] it many of times but I want you to see
[37:39] it. Matthew
[37:40] 24:24 it says there shall arise false
[37:45] Christs and false prophets and shall
[37:50] show great signs and wonders. Now, is
[37:53] that not is that not what we are what we
[37:56] see here in in in the Pentecostal world
[37:58] today among all these
[38:00] charismatics? They all work miracles,
[38:03] signs, wanders. They're all doing
[38:07] uh uh
[38:09] uh it it it'll make your heart
[38:13] think, what's the difference? What's the
[38:16] difference? It it'll make you think,
[38:17] well, I mean, everyone's praying,
[38:20] everyone's crying, everyone's
[38:22] prophesying, everyone's doing miracles.
[38:24] But watch, the Bible says it would be so
[38:27] close they would do signs and wonders
[38:29] and so much that if it were
[38:32] possible, they shall deceive the very
[38:37] elect. So it is going to be in such a
[38:40] manner that the very elect of God would
[38:46] would actually amen be
[38:50] deceived. If God did not plant his seed
[38:53] on the inside of you, it would be such a
[38:55] day that you would you would be
[38:58] deceived. But I'm so glad and again when
[39:01] God's going to fortify his people, he
[39:04] will always send a prophet. In that day
[39:06] he will send a prophet so that there
[39:09] would be no reason, no room to be
[39:11] deceived.
[39:13] Friends, do not be willfully deceived.
[39:16] Can you say amen? Now, Revelations
[39:20] 3:14, it it it talks about that, you
[39:22] know, that that that Leot in church age.
[39:26] He says, "I know thy works. Thou art
[39:28] neither cold nor hot." Amen. I would
[39:31] that you were cold or hot, but because
[39:34] you're
[39:35] lukewarm and and neither cold nor hot, I
[39:38] will spew thee out of my mouth. You say
[39:42] I'm rich and increase with goods, and
[39:45] have need of nothing. Knowest not that
[39:47] thou art wretched, and miserable, and
[39:49] poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel
[39:53] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[39:56] that you may be rich and white raignment
[39:59] that you might put your that you might
[40:02] be clothed that the shame of thy
[40:04] nakedness does not appear. So it shows
[40:08] that we were all
[40:10] naked. We were all in this thing. But
[40:14] the Holy Spirit come to the elect and
[40:16] saying, "Why don't you won't you buy
[40:18] some Isa for your eyes and buy some gold
[40:21] from me? And I've got I've got a white
[40:24] garment for you. The rapture's coming
[40:26] and I want you to be ready." Amen. And
[40:29] then he then he goes on down and and and
[40:32] it says, um, "As many as I love, I
[40:34] rebuke and chasen and be zealous,
[40:37] therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand
[40:40] at the door and knock. And if any man
[40:42] hear my voice and open the door, I will
[40:44] come to him. Him that overcomemeth, I
[40:47] will grant to sit with me in my throne,
[40:49] even as I also overcome, and I'm set
[40:52] down with my father in his throne. And
[40:53] he that hath an ear, let him hear what
[40:56] the spirit says to the churches. Now,
[40:59] that's that's that's the age of
[41:01] deception. Amen. So, it's it's that
[41:03] that's that's that that's pretty rough.
[41:05] But also in the last days, let's turn
[41:07] here. Uh let let's turn to Ephesians 5
[41:10] and
[41:12] 26. Oh man. And um I love it when you
[41:17] kiddos bring your your Bibles. If you're
[41:20] coming to church, you should have a
[41:21] Bible because we're talking about
[41:23] Jesus. And um uh Ephesians 5 and
[41:27] 26. It says that he might
[41:32] sanctify and cleanse it. Are you there?
[41:37] All right. I can wait a little bit uh
[41:38] further if y'all are still turning.
[41:41] Um okay. That he might
[41:44] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[41:47] of the water by the word. Why? So that
[41:52] he might present it to himself a
[41:56] glorious church, not having spot or
[41:59] wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
[42:01] should be holy and without blemish.
[42:07] now
[42:09] deceived. And then we've got this one
[42:11] that's going to be pure. How are we
[42:14] going to do it? It's going to take an
[42:18] Elijah to turn our hearts back to the
[42:22] only thing that can wash
[42:24] us, the word.
[42:28] Well, glory to God. And if there's ever
[42:31] any devil that says, "Well, I'm okay. I
[42:32] you know I don't do this anymore and I
[42:34] don't that you you you kick that devil
[42:36] out because it is a devil. We are to
[42:39] wash. Somebody say wash me Lord
[42:43] wash my mind wash my heart and wash my
[42:47] body.
[42:49] Wash me all I'm body, soul, and spirit.
[42:52] Wash me with your precious blood. And it
[42:57] was the bloody bleeding word that died
[43:01] for you at Calvary.
[43:04] Amen. Can you say amen?
[43:07] Now, so I I so I want to I I got to
[43:10] hurry along here. But now I want I I So
[43:13] we've got two things that there in in in
[43:16] uh in in in Malachi 4, the destruction
[43:20] judgment, and then there is a prophet
[43:23] that is going to come and prepare a
[43:26] people before the coming of that great
[43:30] dreadful day. Now, it's interesting
[43:32] because
[43:36] um the world is all is their attitude is
[43:40] that we're all going to heaven. The
[43:43] world's attitude is that that we are um
[43:49] you know that that we are um
[43:54] uh Elvis is going to raise from the dead
[43:57] and and uh and and and
[44:00] and uh you know all of these others are
[44:03] going to raise from the dead and we're
[44:04] all going to see him you know and and
[44:06] and then u all of the other movie stars
[44:09] and we we'll meet in Hollywood and we'll
[44:11] all meet together and and then we'll all
[44:13] go we we'll all go on a rapture
[44:15] together. But that's that's
[44:19] not see the day of the Lord is a day of
[44:23] what?
[44:25] Judgment. Everyone say the day of the
[44:28] Lord is a day of judgment.
[44:31] We are preparing to miss the judgment
[44:34] because we are taking his word and
[44:36] judging ourselves right now.
[44:39] Can you say amen? Okay.
[44:42] Let's let let me um um let let's see
[44:46] here. I I can tell right now I've got
[44:49] too much in here,
[44:52] man. Well, there's there in in second
[44:55] Peter 3
[44:58] and3.
[45:01] Um we can we can look at that. I think
[45:04] that's good scripture to bring in here
[45:07] tonight. Praise the Lord. Do you love
[45:11] him? Now, this is this is actually
[45:14] talking about our day and the attitudes
[45:18] because people say, "Well, you know, you
[45:21] know, I had this I had this old lady
[45:23] tell me one time I was telling her the
[45:24] coming of the Lord is soon and she was
[45:26] she I don't know, she was she was like
[45:28] 80. She says, "Son, they were saying
[45:32] that in World War I, and they were
[45:35] saying that at World War II, and they've
[45:37] been saying that they every every crisis
[45:40] the world comes into, they're saying
[45:42] that." And she says, "You know, when he
[45:44] comes, he comes." And I said, "Well,
[45:46] aren't aren't you aren't you preparing?"
[45:48] He says, she goes, "I I just really
[45:51] believe that we've got a little ways to
[45:53] go." And um well this was back in this
[45:57] was pro yeah this was back probably 15
[45:59] years ago and uh she's died since then
[46:03] and and I hope that she was ready. Amen.
[46:07] Ready to go. But let's let's let's look
[46:08] here at at 1 Peter 3 and 3. Knowing this
[46:11] first that there shall come in the last
[46:13] days scoffers walking in their own lust.
[46:16] Where is the and saying where is the
[46:17] promise of his coming? For since the
[46:19] fathers fell asleep, all things continue
[46:21] as they were from the beginning of the
[46:23] creation. For this they willingly are
[46:26] ignorant of that by the word of the
[46:28] Lord, the word of God, the heavens were
[46:30] of old, and the earth standing out of
[46:32] the water and in the water. Whereby the
[46:35] world that was then being overflowed
[46:37] with water perished. But the heavens and
[46:39] earth, which are now by the same
[46:42] word, are kept in store and reserved
[46:46] under
[46:47] fire against the day of judgment. Fire.
[46:53] Remember, the whole earth is going to
[46:54] burn with fire and the elect is going to
[46:58] walk out on the ashes. Now watch it says
[47:02] reserved unto the against the day of
[47:05] judgment fire against and predition of
[47:09] ungodly men. But beloved, be not
[47:11] ignorant of this one thing that one day
[47:14] is with the Lord as a thousand years and
[47:16] a thousand years is one day. The Lord is
[47:19] not slack concerning his promise as some
[47:22] count slackness. But watch why why why
[47:25] have we been waiting so long since since
[47:27] since the Malachi 4 has come. It tells
[47:30] us right here, but is longsuffering
[47:33] toward us, not willing that any should
[47:36] perish, but that all should come to
[47:39] repentance. But the day of the Lord,
[47:41] everyone say, the day of the Lord, will
[47:44] come as a thief in the night, in which
[47:46] the heavens shall pass away with great
[47:48] noise, and the elements shall melt with
[47:50] fervent heat, and the earth also, and
[47:53] the works that are therein shall be
[47:54] burned up. Sing then that all these
[47:56] things shall be dissolved. What manner
[47:58] of persons ought ye to be in all holy
[48:01] conversation and godliness? Can you say
[48:04] amen? Now, here's here's another
[48:06] scripture and and I'm not you I'm not
[48:09] going to wait for you to turn to this
[48:10] one, but Isaiah u 5 and 19. It talks
[48:14] about it talks about him said, "Hey,
[48:16] where is God?" But it says they say,
[48:19] "Let him make speed and hasten his work
[48:21] that we may see it. Let the counsel of
[48:23] the holy one of Israel draw nigh and
[48:25] come that we may know it. Woe unto them
[48:28] that call evil good and good evil. That
[48:32] put darkness for light and light for
[48:34] darkness. That put bitter for sweet and
[48:37] sweet for bitter. So the scripture is
[48:40] saying there's going to be a group
[48:42] that's going to say, "Come on, where's
[48:44] he at? Where's he at? Hey, do something.
[48:49] We're all doing this. God's not God's
[48:51] not striking me dead. God's not doing
[48:53] anything to
[48:54] me. My My attitude hasn't He ain't done
[48:57] nothing to
[48:59] me. Amen. Judgment is coming. Don't let
[49:05] that deceiving spirit even come close to
[49:09] the mind of God's elect. Can you say
[49:12] amen?
[49:13] So, so let's let's look here and see.
[49:18] Um, let let's let's look here in in Amos
[49:22] 5. And let's just look at this here for
[49:25] and I will let you turn there. Amos
[49:29] 5. Amen. Everyone doing all right here
[49:31] this
[49:33] evening? Praise the Lord. So, Amos is
[49:35] right after
[49:38] Joel. Amos 5. And we're going to start
[49:42] at the 16th
[49:46] verse. And uh let's see what is um
[49:51] another. So it's like hos Hosea, Joel,
[49:57] Amos. Y'all find
[49:59] that.
[50:01] Amen. All right. Amos can some of these
[50:05] Old Testament uh scriptures can be hard
[50:07] to find it. Hey, I've been I've been
[50:10] reading the Bible for a long time and
[50:11] it's hard for me to find some of these
[50:13] scriptures. Praise the Lord. Um, okay.
[50:17] Let's let's look here at at um five and
[50:21] you know uh let's let's let's let's look
[50:24] at the 18th verse. Woe unto you that
[50:28] desire the day of the Lord. To what end
[50:32] is it for you? Now, now this is so
[50:35] perfect. It's so perfect for today
[50:37] because everyone's saying, "I can't
[50:38] wait. Jesus is coming. Oh, we're about
[50:41] ready. He's coming. He's coming. The
[50:42] whole world. I mean, I don't care who
[50:44] you are. Everyone's ready to go." He
[50:46] says, "The day of the Lord is darkness
[50:47] and not light. As if a man did flee from
[50:50] a lion and a bear met him or went into
[50:53] the house and leaned his hand on the
[50:54] wall and a serpent bit him. Shall not
[50:57] the day of the Lord be darkness and not
[51:02] light? Even very dark and no brightness
[51:07] in it. Let's look at Zephaniah real uh
[51:10] uh real quickly. Amen. Uh Zephaniah, if
[51:14] you just go one over three more books
[51:16] back towards the New Testament and then
[51:18] um you will be there at at Zephaniah 1
[51:22] and 14.
[51:26] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It
[51:30] says, "The great day of the Lord is
[51:33] near. It is near and hasteth greatly."
[51:37] And I say, "It is very near. Even the
[51:41] voice of the day of the Lord, the mighty
[51:44] man shall cry there bitterly."
[51:47] That day is a day of
[51:51] wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a
[51:55] day of wastess and desolation, a day of
[51:59] darkness and glooiness, a day of clouds
[52:01] and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet
[52:04] and alarm against the fence cities
[52:06] against the high towers. I will bring
[52:09] distress upon men, and they shall walk
[52:11] like blind men, because they have sinned
[52:13] against the Lord, and their blood shall
[52:16] be poured out as dust, and their flesh
[52:18] as the dung. Neither uh neither their
[52:21] silver nor gold shall be able to deliver
[52:23] them in the day of the Lord's wrath. But
[52:28] the whole land shall be
[52:31] devaly, for he shall make even a speedy
[52:34] riddenance. Can you say amen? All right,
[52:37] let's look at one other place. Amen.
[52:40] Let's look here at Zechariah 14. And I
[52:43] think I think this here is is is a u is
[52:47] a good one. And this just two more books
[52:49] toward the New Testament. Zechariah the
[52:52] 14th chapter and the first
[52:57] verse. Praise the Lord. And we're going
[53:00] to be able to see this even taking place
[53:02] right now because uh with Israel, it's
[53:04] it's it's going to it's it's it'll show
[53:07] us how close we are. Behold, the day of
[53:11] the Lord cometh. Thy spoil shall be
[53:14] divided in the midst of thee, and I will
[53:18] gather all nations against Jerusalem to
[53:22] battle, and the city will be taken, and
[53:26] the houses rifled, and the women
[53:29] ravished, and half of the city shall go
[53:31] into captivity, and the residue of the
[53:33] people shall not be cut off from the
[53:36] city. So, you know what that's telling
[53:38] us?
[53:41] though it looks like Israel's fighting
[53:42] this big great bag big battle and she's
[53:45] winning. That tells us that Israel's got
[53:48] some very dark times
[53:52] coming. Got some very dark times
[53:56] coming. That hasn't came yet. This is
[53:59] going to happen in the day of the
[54:03] Lord. They're preparing right now.
[54:07] The world is is is turning against
[54:11] Israel. All of this anti-intiment
[54:13] against
[54:14] Israel. You hear
[54:16] me? Now watch watch how close this is.
[54:20] You let's let's let's just look here.
[54:22] Amen. Because there's also some good
[54:25] things here in the scripture. Let's go
[54:27] on to the third verse. Then shall the
[54:29] Lord go forth and fight against those
[54:32] nations as when he fought in the day of
[54:34] battle. and his feet shall stand in that
[54:37] day upon Mount of Olives, which is
[54:39] before Jerusalem on the east. And the
[54:41] Mount of Olives shall cleave in the
[54:43] midst thereof toward the east, and
[54:45] toward the west, and there shall be a
[54:47] very great valley, and half of the
[54:51] mountain shall remove toward the north,
[54:53] and half of it toward the south. And ye
[54:56] shall flee to the valley of the
[54:58] mountains, for the valley of the
[55:00] mountains shall read unto Azou. Yay, ye
[55:03] shall flee like as ye fled before the
[55:06] earthquake in the days of Uzziah, the
[55:08] king of Judah. And the Lord my God shall
[55:11] come and all the saints with thee. And
[55:16] it shall come to pass in that day that
[55:19] the light shall be shall not be clear
[55:22] nor dark. Amen. Lukewarm. But it shall
[55:26] be one day which shall be known with the
[55:28] Lord.
[55:30] Not day nor night, but it shall come to
[55:32] pass in the evening time it shall be
[55:36] light. Right about that time a prophet
[55:39] messenger is coming to get you out of
[55:41] here. Get you caught up. Amen. Then the
[55:43] world is going to go through a
[55:45] tribulation time like never before.
[55:48] Hallelujah. But then you and I are
[55:50] coming back with the Lord Jesus and
[55:52] we're going to fight against those
[55:54] devils. Now watch. Amen. And it shall
[55:56] come to pass, the living water shall go
[55:57] out of Jerusalem, half toward the former
[55:59] sea, half toward the hinder sea. Amen.
[56:02] In the summer, in the winter it shall
[56:04] be, and the Lord shall be king over all
[56:08] the earth. In that day there shall be
[56:10] one Lord and his name one.
[56:13] Can you say amen? So, so there is a
[56:18] plan. There is a there is there God's
[56:22] got you in his mind all along.
[56:26] And to make sure that you're going to
[56:28] make it, he's going to send Elijah your
[56:33] way. And you're going to have to say,
[56:36] "Lord, let my heart wash
[56:40] me. Wash me. Take sin from me. Purify
[56:46] me. Let my heart be pure and
[56:49] unadulterated before you." Oh, can you
[56:52] say amen? Now, why would God say Elijah?
[56:58] Have you ever wondered why God used
[56:59] Elijah? Now, Elijah, it's not that the
[57:02] prophet El not it's not that we're
[57:04] saying that William
[57:05] Brham was Elijah incarnated. Amen. It's
[57:10] the spirit of Elijah that has come upon
[57:14] the the anointing, the makeup that has
[57:16] come back in our day. Is that right?
[57:20] Now before the great and dreadful day
[57:23] the hearts of the children are going to
[57:26] be turned back to the faith of the
[57:29] fathers. Why? Why? Why the
[57:32] heart? Why the
[57:35] heart? The heart is the seat of emotion.
[57:39] It's the seat of
[57:41] affection. It's it's the seat of
[57:44] passions.
[57:47] It's it's
[57:49] where it's where you
[57:52] take you make your choice as when you're
[57:56] you don't love your wife with your mind.
[57:58] You love her with your heart. You don't
[58:02] love God with your mind. You love
[58:06] him with your heart.
[58:10] If we if we treated if we treated our
[58:12] wives the way that we treat the Lord
[58:14] sometimes that would be a pretty rough
[58:17] marriage. She would wonder she would
[58:19] wonder if you really loved him or loved
[58:22] her and and he would wonder if you
[58:23] really loved him,
[58:25] right? Because we we
[58:28] we So here's here's where and and I'm
[58:31] fixing to close. I got a I got two more
[58:33] scriptures I I believe it is that I'm
[58:34] wanting to share y'all. But but I but
[58:36] but here's here's the deal. You
[58:39] see, and and I'm hoping I can make that
[58:41] I'm trying to I I I wanted to just bring
[58:43] this out as we're talking about about
[58:46] this messenger to our
[58:48] age because the whole we we get up and
[58:51] preach and we're preaching promises to
[58:53] you all, right? The ministry comes in
[58:55] preaching to us and telling
[58:57] us you are
[58:59] perfect. You are you you are loved.
[59:03] There's nothing held against you. But
[59:06] you
[59:09] see Leodysa is saying the same thing.
[59:12] Leoa is saying I'm increased with goods.
[59:16] I have need of nothing. I am right.
[59:22] But yet the scripture says there's going
[59:23] to be a day of
[59:25] judgment for some and there's going to
[59:28] be a day of catching away for the
[59:30] others. Amen.
[59:34] Man, this is why the scripture didn't
[59:37] say it's where when the prophet said,
[59:39] Amen. You're not he he did he he didn't
[59:41] say to turn your minds back to the
[59:44] Bible. He said he's got to turn your
[59:47] hearts
[59:48] back to the scripture. You don't serve
[59:51] God with your mind. You serve God with
[59:55] your heart.
[59:58] Well, praise the Lord. Now, so the whole
[1:00:02] world talks about, you know, we're all
[1:00:04] going to rapture and Elvis and Louis
[1:00:06] Sil, as I was saying earlier, and we're
[1:00:08] going to meet up and John Wayne will all
[1:00:10] raise from the dead and, you know, to
[1:00:13] meet Rocky, Gar Brooks, and Nancy Pelosi
[1:00:16] in the air, you know, and and everyone
[1:00:18] is all going to be with the Lord and and
[1:00:21] and and but we're not using the Bible to
[1:00:26] pacify our consciences.
[1:00:30] We're using the Bible to wash our
[1:00:34] consciences.
[1:00:36] We're using the Bible to wash our
[1:00:40] hearts.
[1:00:42] The lukewarm leotans have no heart for
[1:00:46] God. It's all here.
[1:00:50] So with their mouth, they're saying, "I
[1:00:53] love you." With their mouth, they're
[1:00:55] saying, "I'm a Christian." with their
[1:00:57] mouth are saying I go to church. But
[1:00:59] Jesus said in this day that their hearts
[1:01:03] will be far from
[1:01:06] me. So the prophet has to come. You God
[1:01:11] would not let you be deceived. Lay he's
[1:01:14] done promised it in his Bible that you
[1:01:17] the elect will not be deceived. So he's
[1:01:21] sending you a prophet.
[1:01:26] to give you this
[1:01:29] message. Not for you to sit there and
[1:01:32] listen and take it all lightly and say,
[1:01:34] "Well, I I'm going to hell." No. For you
[1:01:37] to be sincere with your soul, sincere
[1:01:41] with your belief system, be sincere with
[1:01:44] this Bible.
[1:01:47] He sent us
[1:01:49] Elijah to get out of that lukewarmness.
[1:01:53] That's saying something
[1:01:56] here but no hearted.
[1:02:00] Y'all y'all hear me
[1:02:04] now? So while one is saying, "Oh, we're
[1:02:06] all saved. We're all saved." And yet the
[1:02:08] Bible says, "As it was in the days of
[1:02:10] Noah, where only eight souls were saved
[1:02:13] as it was, so shall it be in the coming
[1:02:18] where only eight souls."
[1:02:21] eight souls out of
[1:02:25] billions. So, it's not what who says
[1:02:29] what, it's the one who has heard the
[1:02:32] voice
[1:02:36] and they're applying that word to their
[1:02:38] heart and being serious.
[1:02:42] Now, if there's somebody that's still
[1:02:43] playing with
[1:02:45] God, there's coming a time very
[1:02:47] soon where Wendell Martin will not be
[1:02:50] found on this
[1:02:52] earth. Where the true believers here in
[1:02:55] Pawne will be gone.
[1:02:59] The rapture will take place. And if
[1:03:02] you're not right with
[1:03:04] God, there's nothing but judgment for
[1:03:08] you that you've got. Hey, you
[1:03:11] say man, you're putting it on thick,
[1:03:15] buddy. You're you're going to think
[1:03:17] thick if you have been playing around
[1:03:19] with
[1:03:20] God and you miss that
[1:03:26] rapture. And on that
[1:03:29] day, there's no
[1:03:32] recourse on that
[1:03:35] day. But
[1:03:37] friends, a messenger has come to us
[1:03:41] saying,
[1:03:43] "Prepare. The bridegroom
[1:03:46] comes. Be ready to make this
[1:03:50] rapture." Can you say, "Amen." So, let
[1:03:53] us have our garments
[1:03:56] washed. Well, praise the Lord. Now, let
[1:03:59] me just say this.
[1:04:02] Now,
[1:04:05] um, now the as as we got to why
[1:04:10] Elijah, praise the Lord. Why, why Elijah
[1:04:14] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:04:16] Lord. Well, let's look let's look at
[1:04:18] Elijah.
[1:04:21] Elijah came in a time of great
[1:04:23] apostasy and
[1:04:26] um
[1:04:28] Ahab and and Jezebel had had Jezebel had
[1:04:32] caused the whole nation to sin and
[1:04:34] turned against
[1:04:35] God and and then finally God got tired
[1:04:38] of it and God was bringing judgment. The
[1:04:41] scripture says they're in the third
[1:04:43] second or third church age. Remember
[1:04:45] when Jezebel began to seduce God's
[1:04:48] servants in the church ages? It was the
[1:04:50] Catholic Church that had risen up and
[1:04:53] that had started turning the hearts of
[1:04:56] the people away from the true word of
[1:04:58] God. So what we're seeing here today is
[1:05:00] the climax of the seeds that were
[1:05:02] planted until the churches today.
[1:05:04] There's many churches, the Catholic
[1:05:05] Church and denominations, all of those,
[1:05:07] it's just mom and daughters. And they
[1:05:09] they have all they they they have done
[1:05:12] away with the
[1:05:13] word. But God sent an
[1:05:16] Elijah. Amen. And and I and I want to
[1:05:19] say amen that as Israel has been had
[1:05:24] been subjected to man's philosophies
[1:05:27] that for all those years king after king
[1:05:29] idolatrous worship become the norm and
[1:05:33] and there in revelations 2 and 20
[1:05:36] talking about us notwithstanding I have
[1:05:38] a few things against thee because thou
[1:05:39] suffest that woman Jezebel which calleth
[1:05:41] herself a prophetus to teach and to
[1:05:44] seduce my servants to commit fornication
[1:05:46] to eat things sacrifice pass into
[1:05:48] idols. God was going to send a
[1:05:51] vindicated prophet. Amen. So when God
[1:05:54] deals with anything according to Amos,
[1:05:56] if you look there at Amos 3 and I and
[1:05:59] now we let's just turn there real
[1:06:00] quickly. We still have some time. Amen.
[1:06:03] Uh Amos Amos
[1:06:05] 3. This is a
[1:06:08] um a a wonderful scripture because you
[1:06:12] know we look there at at um
[1:06:18] uh look we see what God's God's uh what
[1:06:22] am I looking for the word God's God's
[1:06:25] only way to bring any kind of warning is
[1:06:30] through his prophet now let's look here
[1:06:33] at at Amos 3 and6 shall a trumpet be
[1:06:36] blown in a city and the people not be
[1:06:38] afraid? Shall there be evil in a city
[1:06:40] and the Lord hath not done it? Surely
[1:06:43] the Lord
[1:06:44] God will do nothing, but he revealth his
[1:06:49] secrets unto his servants, the
[1:06:53] prophets. You see
[1:06:55] that? Now, I want us to look at our
[1:06:59] final scripture here. Let's look here at
[1:07:01] at First Kings 18 and 21.
[1:07:06] First Kings is back in the beginning of
[1:07:08] the
[1:07:10] book. And I would like for you kids to
[1:07:14] to turn there if you've got your
[1:07:16] Bibles. Um 18 and
[1:07:22] 21 because this here is this this here
[1:07:25] we talked about the five comingings of
[1:07:27] Elijah. And so this here is is actually
[1:07:31] this is the first Elijah. This is the
[1:07:33] original Elijah.
[1:07:35] And this is what he done. And uh so when
[1:07:39] you're there, you can say
[1:07:41] amen. All right. It says, "Elijah came
[1:07:45] unto all the people and said, "How long
[1:07:49] halt ye
[1:07:51] between two
[1:07:54] opinions." So you got
[1:07:58] Christendom and then you've got you've
[1:08:02] got the real and you've got the false.
[1:08:04] You've got the bride. You've got right.
[1:08:07] And so now here it comes. Here it comes.
[1:08:10] So he's saying, "And if the go if the
[1:08:12] Lord be God, follow him. If Baal be God,
[1:08:15] then follow him." And the people
[1:08:16] answered him not a word. Then said
[1:08:18] Elijah unto the people, "I even I only
[1:08:22] remain a prophet of the Lord. But Baal's
[1:08:24] prophets are 450 men. Let them give us
[1:08:29] two bulocks. Let them choose one bulock
[1:08:32] for themselves and cut it in pieces. Lay
[1:08:35] it on the wood and put no fire under it.
[1:08:38] I will dress the other bulock and lay it
[1:08:40] on wood and put no fire
[1:08:43] under. Call ye on the name of your gods
[1:08:46] and I will call on the name of the Lord.
[1:08:49] And the God thatth by fire, let him be
[1:08:52] God. And all the people answered and
[1:08:54] said it was well spoken. Now it sounds
[1:08:56] like it sounds like these are just
[1:08:58] heathen people. No, no, no, no.
[1:09:00] Remember, Israel was God's chosen
[1:09:05] people. Israel was not heathen nation.
[1:09:08] They were God's chosen people, but they
[1:09:12] were putting other things over
[1:09:15] God. They weren't serving the true
[1:09:19] God, though they claimed they were Jews.
[1:09:23] Are you understanding? I want you to
[1:09:24] look now. Here's the elect that says
[1:09:27] there is one God. Here is the false that
[1:09:30] is saying, "Oh, but we love God, too.
[1:09:33] We're Christians, too." All right. Amen.
[1:09:37] Now, the spirit that came, the spirit or
[1:09:40] the anointing of Elijah, Amen. It come
[1:09:45] and and and and the the the power was
[1:09:48] with Elijah. Elijah had said, "It will
[1:09:50] not rain except by my word." There was
[1:09:52] the supernatural with Elijah just as
[1:09:55] there was a supernatural with with with
[1:09:58] our Elijah. But Elijah was a restoration
[1:10:02] prophet. He stood against all the forms
[1:10:05] of of religion and sin. And I want us to
[1:10:08] go down. Let's just just to make it
[1:10:11] quickly. Let's go to the 30th verse. And
[1:10:14] Elijah said unto all the people, "Come
[1:10:16] near unto
[1:10:18] me." And all the people came near. And
[1:10:21] he repaired the altar of the Lord that
[1:10:25] was broken down. Malachi 4, what was it?
[1:10:28] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:10:31] children back
[1:10:33] to the faith of the fathers, the
[1:10:36] apostles who wrote the
[1:10:39] book. Jezebel's teachings has thrown the
[1:10:42] book off to the side. But it took an
[1:10:45] Elijah in our day to pick up all of the
[1:10:49] broken pieces, bring it all back
[1:10:51] together to build the altar. Amen.
[1:10:56] And Elijah took 12 stones according to
[1:10:59] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[1:11:00] Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord
[1:11:02] came, saying, Israel uh uh shall be thy
[1:11:05] name. And with the stones he built an
[1:11:07] altar in the name of the Lord. And he
[1:11:09] made a trench around the altar as great
[1:11:11] as as would be two measures of seed.
[1:11:14] What was he doing? He was screaming out.
[1:11:17] Amen. 36th verse that that 36th verse he
[1:11:20] says, "And it came to pass in the time
[1:11:22] of the offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:11:24] that Elijah the prophet came near and
[1:11:27] said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
[1:11:29] Israel, let it be known this day that
[1:11:31] thou art God in Israel, that I am thy
[1:11:34] servant, and I have done all these
[1:11:37] things at thy word." It was all done by
[1:11:39] vision. That was a prophet. Hear me, oh
[1:11:42] Lord. Hear me that this people may know
[1:11:45] that thou art the God, the Lord God,
[1:11:47] that thou hast turned their heart back
[1:11:53] again. What was the first Elijah doing?
[1:11:56] Turning their heart back to the true
[1:12:00] God. What is our prophet doing? Turning
[1:12:04] our hearts back to the true word. In the
[1:12:07] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:12:08] with God. The word was God. Are you
[1:12:10] hearing me? Now, you say, "Well, this is
[1:12:13] elementary." But I I know I I know it
[1:12:15] might be elementary, but we've also got
[1:12:17] our young people. And and besides, I
[1:12:19] don't care if you've been serving the
[1:12:20] Lord for 50 years. It's good to hear
[1:12:26] it. You would all be going through a
[1:12:30] tribulation. And I just want to say
[1:12:32] guys, if God sent Malachi for a prophet
[1:12:37] to turn our hearts back to it, then what
[1:12:40] about anyone that does not heed to
[1:12:44] it? They can't be
[1:12:48] prepared. I'm going on record. There is
[1:12:51] no rapture for anybody that has not come
[1:12:55] in line with the prophet of this day.
[1:13:01] heaven. Yes, there will be some you'll
[1:13:04] have to go through that. You'll have to
[1:13:06] go through the great tribulation. You'll
[1:13:08] have to give your head. You'll have to
[1:13:10] go through those things there. But this
[1:13:12] message has come to prepare us. Don't
[1:13:16] sit in a message church and not be
[1:13:22] prepared because you don't even have you
[1:13:24] don't even have a guarantee. There may
[1:13:26] be nothing left but hell for you.
[1:13:29] if you reject what God's given us. So
[1:13:32] what am I saying? You saying, "Brother
[1:13:34] Window, what what are you trying to
[1:13:35] say?" I'm
[1:13:37] saying take the word of God very very
[1:13:41] seriously.
[1:13:46] I I thinking of uh Brother Nathaniel, if
[1:13:50] would you would you put First
[1:13:51] Thessalonians 5 up there? Amen. Uh uh
[1:13:55] first 1 Thessalonians
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:02] um 1 Thessalonians 5 and
[1:14:10] two. Yes. Yes. That one right there. For
[1:14:14] yourselves know perfectly. Yourselves
[1:14:16] know perfectly. And there there's going
[1:14:17] to be an elect that has heard.
[1:14:21] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:14:24] of the Lord that's there's the day he's
[1:14:27] saying it's going to be a day of sorrow
[1:14:29] a day of gloom a day of of of evil he
[1:14:33] says but yourself know perfectly that
[1:14:35] the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief
[1:14:37] in the
[1:14:37] night and when they shall say peace and
[1:14:40] safety then sudden destruction come upon
[1:14:42] them as travail upon a upon a woman with
[1:14:45] child and they shall not
[1:14:48] escape but Ye, someone shout hallelujah.
[1:14:52] Hallelujah. Brethren, are not in
[1:14:56] darkness, that that day should overtake
[1:15:00] you as a
[1:15:01] thief. Ye are the children of light, and
[1:15:05] the children of the day, and we are not
[1:15:08] of the night, nor of the
[1:15:11] darkness. What What is he
[1:15:14] saying? You say, "Well, then we didn't
[1:15:16] need." No, no, no. You've got You can't
[1:15:18] do away with one. You can't. You see,
[1:15:21] but the Apostle Paul was expecting the
[1:15:23] coming of the Lord to be right then. He
[1:15:26] was They were the apostolic fathers. He
[1:15:29] was the one that that where the fathers
[1:15:31] were turned to the children. They're the
[1:15:33] one that wrote the book for you and I's
[1:15:35] sake. But here we are seven church ages
[1:15:37] later and we and the world has been
[1:15:40] taught by this
[1:15:42] Jezebel to commit fornications against
[1:15:45] her God. So, it takes an Elijah to come
[1:15:47] back and point us back to that word so
[1:15:50] that that scripture can be fulfilled in
[1:15:52] my ears.
[1:15:56] You're not of darkness. So, God's given
[1:15:58] you light. Oh, glory to God. What is
[1:16:02] light? It's revelation. You are children
[1:16:05] of revelation that that day shall not
[1:16:08] overtake you. Then go to that next
[1:16:12] verse, verse nine. Let's see. Uh yeah,
[1:16:16] therefore let us not sleep as others do,
[1:16:18] but let us watch and be sober. They that
[1:16:21] sleep sleep in the night. They that are
[1:16:23] be drunken are drunken in the
[1:16:24] night. Let us who are of the day be
[1:16:27] sober, putting on the breastplate of
[1:16:30] faith and love and helmet, this the hope
[1:16:33] of
[1:16:34] salvation. For God hath not appointed
[1:16:39] the
[1:16:40] elect to wrath.
[1:16:48] And he shall turn the
[1:16:50] hearts of the
[1:16:53] children back to the
[1:16:59] fathers because God has not appointed
[1:17:03] any of us to wrath but unto a rapture.
[1:17:10] So the
[1:17:11] world is saying, "Oh yeah, it's going to
[1:17:14] be a wonderful day. A great great great
[1:17:15] day." And we're saying, "Yeah, it's
[1:17:16] going to be a great day. Yeah, yeah,
[1:17:17] yeah. Great great day." But one's by
[1:17:20] revelation. One is preparing. The other
[1:17:23] is just thinking that every every every
[1:17:25] guy's going
[1:17:27] right. Amen. Are we going to be ready?
[1:17:31] We're going to be ready because the
[1:17:32] elect of God is not going to be
[1:17:34] lukewarm.
[1:17:36] Amen. there in in in 1 Peter 3:12 as the
[1:17:39] musicians come 1 Peter 3 and2 second
[1:17:42] Peter 3 and2 amen it says looking for
[1:17:46] and
[1:17:47] hasting oh look at the look at the elect
[1:17:50] we're not we're not cowardly going into
[1:17:52] this we're not saying oh no oh no I I
[1:17:55] don't no we've heard from Elijah we
[1:17:58] we've got our watch this looking for and
[1:18:01] hasting unto the coming of the
[1:18:05] day of
[1:18:08] God wherein the heavens shall be on fire
[1:18:11] shall be deserved and the elements shall
[1:18:13] melt with fervent heat and nevertheless
[1:18:14] we according to his promise look for new
[1:18:17] heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[1:18:19] righteousness wherefore beloved seeing
[1:18:22] that ye look for such things be diligent
[1:18:25] that you may be found in him found of
[1:18:29] him in peace when he
[1:18:31] comes be diligent that you're found of
[1:18:34] him in peace without spot and blameless.
[1:18:39] Now what? What? Wait a minute. What?
[1:18:40] Where's where's that blameless and that
[1:18:41] spot? What? What? What? But the washing
[1:18:43] of the water by the
[1:18:46] word. There's no reason for any of us to
[1:18:50] ever be ashamed. And buddy, don't be
[1:18:52] ashamed of this message. I don't care if
[1:18:54] you're on the job site. Don't don't be
[1:18:55] ashamed of this message. Don't don't be
[1:19:00] ashamed because this is salvation.
[1:19:05] Brother
[1:19:06] Brandham did not die for us. He was a
[1:19:09] human being like the rest of
[1:19:12] us. But the problem was
[1:19:15] Jezebel had taught us all that we were
[1:19:18] okay with just being
[1:19:21] religious. Good
[1:19:22] feeling. Just believe the fundamentals.
[1:19:25] Whether you're a Baptist, believe the
[1:19:26] fundamentals. Whether you then if you're
[1:19:28] a Pentecostal, it's the good emotion and
[1:19:30] the speaking in tongues.
[1:19:34] you're
[1:19:35] Catholic, it's pray to one of the
[1:19:39] saints, if you got all but
[1:19:43] here, God sent a
[1:19:46] prophet and that prophet he vindicated
[1:19:49] with a great pillar of
[1:19:51] fire. Can you put Can you Can you put
[1:19:55] the pillar of fire up
[1:19:57] there? Sorry for running you around.
[1:19:59] Thanks for doing that, though. I like I
[1:20:00] like those
[1:20:02] scriptures. The great the one the pillar
[1:20:06] of fire over brother's
[1:20:08] head. Oh
[1:20:10] God. God says let Elijah says let the
[1:20:14] God that answers by fire. He said I'm
[1:20:17] not going to put no fire under the
[1:20:18] altar. I'm not going to put no fire on
[1:20:19] the And if you can't find that, Brother
[1:20:21] Nathaniel, I that that's just fine.
[1:20:23] Actually, brother Harry, if you would
[1:20:25] just could you get that that we we get
[1:20:28] this picture over here, Brother
[1:20:29] Nathaniel. The one the one that's
[1:20:31] outside
[1:20:32] there. Don't hurt your
[1:20:35] back. And
[1:20:39] uh but he was vindicated by the pillar
[1:20:41] of fire. In fact, Elijah was caught
[1:20:45] up in chariots of fire.
[1:20:50] But in this day, God didn't just say God
[1:20:53] didn't just say that any that he he
[1:20:57] wasn't going to leave it to a man to
[1:20:59] vindicate
[1:21:01] himself. But if God
[1:21:04] says that I'm going to send an
[1:21:08] Elijah, then God's got to come and
[1:21:11] vindicate that
[1:21:16] man. God appeared in the pillar of fire
[1:21:19] all the time, but this time the Lord
[1:21:22] allowed the camera to take
[1:21:26] it. They done all of this. They they
[1:21:29] they went through the negatives. They
[1:21:31] they done all of this scientific stuff
[1:21:34] of the day back then. and
[1:21:37] and
[1:21:41] the one of the men of the FBI, the
[1:21:45] forensics
[1:21:46] expert says, "Listen, there's no light
[1:21:49] that hit that
[1:21:51] negative." He said, "That was a
[1:21:53] supernatural being."
[1:21:56] He said, 'I too have been a skeptic of
[1:21:59] William Brandham when I've heard of the
[1:22:01] light and when I he says, but
[1:22:05] today this has been the only photograph
[1:22:09] that has ever been
[1:22:12] taken. Let me let me just put it this
[1:22:14] way. The Holy
[1:22:16] Spirit is wanting to make it real to you
[1:22:21] because you are going to have to have
[1:22:24] the correct
[1:22:26] interpretation. God don't want you just
[1:22:28] following in darkness. God didn't want
[1:22:31] those Israelites to follow that Elijah
[1:22:33] in darkness. So God vindicated that
[1:22:37] man so that every mom and daddy, every
[1:22:40] boy and girl would know that he was
[1:22:43] God's prophet.
[1:22:46] Aren't you glad we don't worship? Nah,
[1:22:49] we don't worship, brother Brandham.
[1:22:50] We're so thankful that God chose
[1:22:54] this humble
[1:22:57] servant to take us back to
[1:23:02] scripture. I'm
[1:23:05] thankful. I don't want to have one of
[1:23:07] these pictures in my house and and have
[1:23:10] a
[1:23:16] say, "I'm a message
[1:23:17] believer." And did not heed to the words
[1:23:19] it
[1:23:21] says. I want to be ready to go. Truly,
[1:23:25] truly, we are. We are about ready. Amen.
[1:23:29] It's time to go home.
[1:23:33] Amen.
[1:23:35] Amen. What are you playing there,
[1:23:37] Brother Kobe?
[1:23:40] The
[1:23:41] light. Such a
[1:23:45] beautiful
[1:23:48] life comes
[1:23:50] where the
[1:23:53] dude of
[1:23:56] mercy. Our bright.
[1:23:59] Won't you shine
[1:24:02] all around
[1:24:05] us by day and by
[1:24:10] night? You are
[1:24:13] Jesus, the
[1:24:16] light. Turn my heart. I don't want to be
[1:24:19] in church and have my heart somewhere
[1:24:22] else. Let me walk
[1:24:25] in the light.
[1:24:29] Such a
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:33] beautiful. Oh, it comes
[1:24:37] when the due
[1:24:41] drops of
[1:24:43] mercy are
[1:24:45] pride. Won't you shine
[1:24:49] all shine around me Lord by day?
[1:24:58] You are
[1:25:01] Jesus, the light
[1:25:04] of the
[1:25:07] world.
[1:25:09] Father, we thank
[1:25:12] you for the
[1:25:16] warning even in your first coming. Lord
[1:25:18] Jesus,
[1:25:21] you you said there would be the foolish
[1:25:25] and the wise
[1:25:29] virgins. You said that there would be a
[1:25:32] call come out at
[1:25:36] midnight that you would have a messenger
[1:25:38] that would say, "Behold, the bridegroom
[1:25:41] cometh."
[1:25:47] In the parable that you laid out, you
[1:25:50] said both wise and
[1:25:52] foolish, was going to be
[1:26:01] sleeping, but the
[1:26:03] wise would have
[1:26:07] oil. Lord, I pray that you let us
[1:26:11] all have oil in our lamps.
[1:26:16] Let us walk with you in the purity of
[1:26:19] heart. Let us walk with you Lord with
[1:26:23] divine
[1:26:27] love. Such a
[1:26:29] love, a great eternal love that comes
[1:26:33] only from
[1:26:36] you. We love you,
[1:26:39] Lord. We know that that love can only
[1:26:41] come by your Holy Spirit.
[1:26:45] And Lord, if there's someone here
[1:26:47] tonight that doesn't have the baptism of
[1:26:49] the Holy
[1:26:52] Ghost, Lord, the five foolish did not
[1:26:56] have it. And when the bridegroom
[1:26:59] came, they weren't ready.
[1:27:03] So Lord, I pray that you
[1:27:05] would fill
[1:27:09] every man and woman, boy and
[1:27:13] girl that doesn't have it, fill them
[1:27:15] with your Holy
[1:27:18] Spirit. It's something that you have
[1:27:20] promised to us all when you said,
[1:27:23] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[1:27:25] you, in the name of Jesus for the
[1:27:26] remission of your sins, and you shall
[1:27:28] receive the Holy Ghost." It's a promise.
[1:27:33] It's a
[1:27:35] gift. So Lord, we're going to humble
[1:27:37] ourselves and we're going to say, "I
[1:27:39] want that more than I I want anything
[1:27:43] else. I want your Holy
[1:27:48] Spirit. Oh
[1:27:50] God, oh line our hearts up with you,
[1:27:53] Lord.
[1:27:55] Let us want you more than we want
[1:27:57] phones. Want YouTube.
[1:28:01] And let us want you more than we want
[1:28:04] any of the pleasures of this
[1:28:06] world. We love you,
[1:28:09] Lord. Now, Father, we're asking that you
[1:28:12] would take us
[1:28:17] all. Let us examine our
[1:28:21] souls. We'll give you glory and honor.
[1:28:26] in the name of Jesus
[1:28:28] Christ. You see those who will be
[1:28:30] traveling Lord for the wedding. I ask,
[1:28:33] Father, that you would be with them.
[1:28:37] And keep keep everyone safe.
[1:28:40] And I ask, Lord, that you would just
[1:28:44] cause everything to
[1:28:46] go wonderful, Lord, for the for the
[1:28:48] kids. And that you would bless Brother
[1:28:52] Austin, Sister Rose,
[1:28:56] Lord. Lord, just thank you for all that
[1:28:59] you are.
[1:29:01] We thank you for these young
[1:29:05] people, the gifts of God that you've
[1:29:08] placed in their
[1:29:09] lives, that seed that comes from
[1:29:13] you. I just ask Lord that you would be
[1:29:16] with all of our young people, Lord.
[1:29:19] There's a lot of them, Lord, that's
[1:29:22] getting to that age where
[1:29:24] they're maybe interested in
[1:29:27] a a boyfriend or girlfriend. Just ask
[1:29:31] Lord that they would always seek you in
[1:29:35] all that they
[1:29:37] do. We love you,
[1:29:40] Father. We give ourselves to you
[1:29:43] tonight. Just ask, Lord, that these
[1:29:45] words were a blessing.
[1:29:47] We thank you in Jesus
[1:29:49] name. Amen. And amen. God bless you. I
[1:29:53] know I kept you a little bit longer
[1:29:55] tonight and uh but I wanted to read a
[1:29:59] read that and just sort of lay a lay
[1:30:02] that in there. How blessed we are. God
[1:30:05] bless you. I walk
[1:30:09] in the
[1:30:11] light. Such a beauty.
[1:30:16] Amen. You can dismiss yourselves
[1:30:18] tonight. Appreciate
[1:30:20] you. Comes where the dew
[1:30:24] drops of
[1:30:27] mercy are
[1:30:30] bright. Shine all around
[1:30:35] me by
[1:30:38] day. Lord, I love you. Lord, I love you.
[1:30:44] Jesus, I love you,
[1:30:47] Lord. I love you,
