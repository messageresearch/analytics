[57:54] all these things and
[57:56] you know we realized that we are our
[57:59] worst enemy
[58:00] ourselves
[58:02] and I've recognized this
[58:04] and you know it's too bad that you know
[58:06] sometimes we have to throw those fits
[58:08] and those tantrums and you know the Lord
[58:10] comes on the scene and he he shows you
[58:13] just exactly how you're acting and you
[58:16] know you say Lord forgive me Lord Lord
[58:19] forgive me for for those things and we

[58:37] and of course I'm speaking to myself
[58:40] this evening so that being said I'd like
[58:43] to turn to the book of Isaiah chapter
[58:46] 59.
[59:02] so probably the last year you'll see
[59:03] this bottle
[59:05] if you've been throwing any fits or or
[59:08] Tantrums you can come and wave goodbye
[59:11] to that tonight

[59:17] I just need him
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:20] I just need him I I we all love to be
[59:23] petted and baby but you know at the end
[59:25] of the day
[59:26] you know it's not a flowery bed of ease
[59:29] Christianity is is rugged
[59:31] so that being said uh just appreciate
[59:34] all the ministers here just God bless
[59:36] you it's always a blessing you know to
[59:39] have all the ministers together here and
[59:41] be able to I I don't know how much
[59:43] longer that
[59:44] we'll be able to have meetings like
[59:46] these and so I I personally just just
[59:49] cherish them so so I pray that you just
[59:52] cherish them too Isaiah chapter 59 when
[59:56] you're there you could just say Amen of
[59:58] course we always love class
[1:00:00] participation so if you if you pay

[1:00:15] when you're there you could just say
[1:00:16] Amen
[1:00:18] Isaiah 59 and 19.

[1:00:26] the name of the Lord from the West
[1:00:30] and His glory from the rising of the Sun
[1:00:34] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:00:36] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[1:00:39] up a standard against who
[1:00:44] against who against him

[1:01:10] and when you're there you can say Amen
[1:01:12] Malachi chapter 4 we're going to start
[1:01:15] in verse 5. the Bible says behold I will
[1:01:19] send you Elijah the prophet
[1:01:22] before the coming of the great and
[1:01:24] Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:01:27] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:01:30] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[1:01:32] the children to their fathers least I
[1:01:36] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[1:01:39] one more scripture this evening we'll
[1:01:42] turn to Revelations chapter 10.

[1:02:13] the voice of the seventh angel
[1:02:16] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:02:20] of God should be finished as he hath

[1:04:57] forest ranger
[1:04:59] and I was starting to take the classes
[1:05:01] at the community college there in New
[1:05:04] Mexico and we were required to take a
[1:05:07] certain class a writing class called
[1:05:10] creative writing and in creative writing
[1:05:13] they would teach you how that you were
[1:05:16] to be able to write maybe a short story
[1:05:19] or if you had plans to to write a book
[1:05:23] and you know you you would they would
[1:05:25] show you how how to start that process
[1:05:27] and of course you know in literature and
[1:05:30] and writing a short story you would have
[1:05:34] to begin by having a plot so you would
[1:05:38] have to
[1:05:40] think it over and say well what what do
[1:05:42] I want to talk about or Express or what
[1:05:46] will be the The Narrative of the story
[1:05:48] and as I was thinking of our story here
[1:05:51] this evening of course the the plot
[1:05:54] would be Okla Homa meetings and you know
[1:05:58] we would we would have the everything
[1:06:00] set up for us here at these meetings and
[1:06:03] you know I was asking brother Wendell
[1:06:05] today I said what what's the theme
[1:06:07] brother of of the meetings and he said
[1:06:10] well brother Manny the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:12] you know the refilling of a holy ghost
[1:06:14] or you know the the most important thing
[1:06:17] that we could do as young people and old
[1:06:20] is just die out to ourselves and ask
[1:06:22] that the Lord would come and fill us
[1:06:24] with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:26] and so what what what a plot that we
[1:06:29] have this evening and of course you
[1:06:32] would have to in this story that would
[1:06:34] be written you would have to have an
[1:06:37] introduction and in that introduction we
[1:06:40] could say it would be maybe a called the
[1:06:42] exposition or or introduction and you
[1:06:46] know with that I mean when you look at
[1:06:48] the the beginning of of writing a story
[1:06:51] you would have to actually it's possibly
[1:06:55] the the most important part of the whole
[1:06:58] process yeah and you you have to cats
[1:07:02] will say or or grip whoever is going to
[1:07:05] want to be reading your story you you
[1:07:08] they want to open up in the first few
[1:07:10] pages of your story it really has to
[1:07:13] grip them it has to it has to to to to
[1:07:16] grab them or or they'll just kind of put
[1:07:19] it to the side and you know there's
[1:07:21] another look for another book or
[1:07:23] something else and so we we find out
[1:07:26] that that God has has been the greatest
[1:07:29] book that's ever been written and we
[1:07:33] find out that when we open that Bible
[1:07:36] immediately it says in the beginning God
[1:07:38] created the Heaven and the Earth and to
[1:07:41] a Believer it just grips them it grabs
[1:07:45] or attention
[1:07:46] we opened it up and said oh my goodness
[1:07:48] God made all these things
[1:07:51] and when I read it I don't have a doubt
[1:07:53] I I don't understand well maybe or this
[1:07:56] I just there's something inside me that
[1:07:58] just says Amen to that God did these
[1:08:02] things
[1:08:03] and we we look at this introduction of
[1:08:06] our Bible and you know we I got to
[1:08:09] thinking on her right over here how that
[1:08:11] we were listening to the service and you
[1:08:14] know I was thinking about uh our brother
[1:08:16] Daryl and and the importance that he had
[1:08:19] of opening up the service
[1:08:22] and you know as as a minister we we've
[1:08:25] had meetings at our church and you know
[1:08:26] when you have several preachers you know
[1:08:28] you you don't want to to hurt anybody's
[1:08:31] feelings so much as to to put them in
[1:08:34] this spot or this day or or put them
[1:08:36] maybe on this day when you know there'd
[1:08:38] be more people
[1:08:40] and usually just to let the pressure off
[1:08:42] all always ask the pastor you don't let
[1:08:44] me start this thing you know whatever
[1:08:47] that it don't matter to me it don't
[1:08:48] matter if there's one person there or
[1:08:50] 150 or 300 it don't matter
[1:08:53] and you know I got to thinking just how
[1:08:57] important that the introduction is
[1:08:59] and so we we look at and what a special
[1:09:02] honor that was for me to to to come up
[1:09:05] after a great brother who's preached for
[1:09:07] all these years and he's been such an
[1:09:09] inspiration to me and to our family and
[1:09:13] to the church
[1:09:14] and you know the things that he's told
[1:09:16] us he's given us his heart by expressing
[1:09:19] you know things with between him and
[1:09:21] sister Cheryl and with their children
[1:09:24] that have taken place in their lives and
[1:09:26] we feel special for that
[1:09:29] so in an introduction when you're
[1:09:31] writing a story you you have to start
[1:09:33] there has to be a main character
[1:09:36] and once the main characters establish
[1:09:39] you you come and you make a setting and
[1:09:42] we find out that the settings here this
[1:09:45] evening and then you you bring out the
[1:09:48] themes of whatever that you're writing
[1:09:50] and then you absolutely have to have the
[1:09:54] conflict
[1:09:55] and all these things that we're speaking
[1:09:58] about this evening we see that brother
[1:10:00] Daryl did last night he did an amazing
[1:10:04] introduction into these meetings and all
[1:10:07] these things have come into play and we
[1:10:10] see that the main character that we're
[1:10:12] talking about tonight is Jesus Christ
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:17] we see that with that that the setting
[1:10:20] would be Pawnee Oklahoma
[1:10:23] and we see that the themes of the
[1:10:25] meeting would be salvation and and
[1:10:27] healing and Revival and the Holy Spirit
[1:10:30] and you know we we heard last night that
[1:10:34] when the brother was preaching he said
[1:10:36] if thou can't believe
[1:10:39] all things are possible
[1:10:43] and the setting is here this evening
[1:10:46] and the brothers have said it's all out
[1:10:48] there it's just going to take something
[1:10:50] to light it just a little spark this
[1:10:52] evening and anything can be possible
[1:10:56] and in the story they teach you that the
[1:10:59] plot and then you'd have the exposition
[1:11:01] which is the introduction and then you
[1:11:04] would come to the rising action and many
[1:11:06] things would take place in the rising
[1:11:08] action and then it would come to a part
[1:11:11] where there would be a climax though the
[1:11:13] Pinnacle of the meeting and then we find
[1:11:16] out that after the climax of The
[1:11:18] Pinnacle then there'd be a falling
[1:11:20] action and then a resolution
[1:11:24] tonight I believe in these meetings that
[1:11:26] were just going to be have surprising
[1:11:28] action
[1:11:29] away up to the climax
[1:11:33] and the climax for us is going to be a
[1:11:35] rapture
[1:11:37] and after we take that sir which is the
[1:11:41] climax then this world can have the
[1:11:44] solving action and then they can have
[1:11:47] the resolution but we'll be in the sky
[1:11:51] Hallelujah with our Jesus by and by
[1:11:54] [Applause]
[1:12:00] oh
[1:12:04] Hallelujah
[1:12:10] notice I too as the brother was
[1:12:12] preaching want to give my all for Jesus
[1:12:15] Christ
[1:12:18] our brother Daryl was saying you know
[1:12:20] he's getting old and he's saying I don't
[1:12:22] want to hear these things from him
[1:12:24] sister sure I don't want to hear that
[1:12:26] he's always been one of our heroes it's
[1:12:28] it was an upsetting time brother during
[1:12:31] when I would look over and see my dad
[1:12:33] getting old
[1:12:34] he'd always been the strength it's
[1:12:36] strong and you know he'd always have the
[1:12:38] right words and wisdom and I would look
[1:12:40] and and then one day you know I turn
[1:12:42] over and I said my goodness my dad's
[1:12:44] gotten old and I really didn't realize
[1:12:47] that until I looked in the mirror
[1:12:49] and when I looked in the mirror I said
[1:12:50] my goodness I'm getting old and then I
[1:12:53] look and say oh my goodness my dad's get
[1:12:54] he's older than I am
[1:12:57] and so when brother Daryl was saying you
[1:12:58] know these ministers and this stuff and
[1:13:01] and I wanted to jump across the airwaves
[1:13:04] and say yeah brother but you were
[1:13:06] inspiration to us
[1:13:08] you and and brother Jewel and these
[1:13:10] great men that would cross the country
[1:13:12] we would that was our inspiration and
[1:13:15] and I want to tell you because of that
[1:13:17] some people are preaching today
[1:13:21] all right
[1:13:22] but we we find that life is not always a
[1:13:26] flowery bed of ease
[1:13:29] and sometimes we come to where we see
[1:13:32] it's our Wit's End and we're at the end
[1:13:35] and mother Brandon says this he says
[1:13:37] when you get to the end of your road
[1:13:41] when you get to where you can't move
[1:13:46] he says then it's time
[1:13:48] then it's time
[1:13:50] you mean at the end of everything I did
[1:13:52] when I just want to just give it up and
[1:13:54] give in and end it all that's the time
[1:13:57] he said that's the time
[1:14:00] he said it's time notice what he said he
[1:14:03] said God will move in by Sovereign Grace
[1:14:07] if you've come and you're at your Wit's
[1:14:10] End and maybe you can't take any more I
[1:14:14] want to tell you Now's the Time today's
[1:14:17] the time
[1:14:19] God will move in by Sovereign Grace and
[1:14:22] take care of the situation
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:29] oh we got a big cup of water you're in
[1:14:31] trouble
[1:14:36] bless the Lord he said God will move in
[1:14:39] by Sovereign Grace the thing that you
[1:14:43] seek
[1:14:44] the thing that you seek God will move in
[1:14:48] by Sovereign Grace Hallelujah notice the
[1:14:53] thing that you seek and then he gives us
[1:14:55] an example notice the example that
[1:14:58] brother Branham takes after what he's
[1:15:00] telling us here he says you take a
[1:15:02] little kid
[1:15:04] a little baby
[1:15:07] he says they have little cramps and
[1:15:10] spasms and they'll scream and kick and
[1:15:14] holler and the first thing that you know
[1:15:17] they'll hold their breath
[1:15:20] so now we have a little baby the example
[1:15:22] and he's crying and he's kicking and
[1:15:24] he's screaming and he's hollering and he
[1:15:27] looks at his mama and goes
[1:15:31] and he holds his breath notice Brother
[1:15:34] Brad says then he says you'll see the
[1:15:36] mother grab it and Pat it and throw it
[1:15:41] up in the air and blow in the face
[1:15:46] notice he says let it alone
[1:15:50] he said there's never been in our
[1:15:52] medical history one ever died like that
[1:15:57] he said oh he said they won't die hey
[1:16:00] brothers when you got people in your
[1:16:03] church that are kicking and they're
[1:16:05] screaming and they're fussing and
[1:16:07] they're holding their breath let them
[1:16:09] alone they'll be all right they're not
[1:16:12] gonna die
[1:16:24] is that you holding your breath
[1:16:27] is that you kicking in a screaming and
[1:16:30] hollering brother Randall
[1:16:33] oh they took my privacy
[1:16:37] oh brother well I always get the worst
[1:16:40] job for these meetings
[1:16:45] notice he says there's never in our
[1:16:47] medical history everyone died like that
[1:16:50] they won't die he said he's just having
[1:16:52] a tantrum
[1:16:54] he's trying to get sympathy he's trying
[1:16:58] to get some humoring it's just a temper
[1:17:01] spell and after he gets his temper smell
[1:17:04] to a place he's hauled his breath where
[1:17:07] he can't go no fur no farther with it he
[1:17:10] said then nature steps in
[1:17:15] than nature
[1:17:17] steps in
[1:17:20] to let him hold their breath don't you
[1:17:23] worry Nature's going to snap in and he
[1:17:28] relaxes and starts breathing again
[1:17:33] you can somebody breathe in
[1:17:36] and breathe out
[1:17:38] and they start to breathe again oh he
[1:17:40] says you're picking up and screaming
[1:17:42] just makes hollering and blowing in his
[1:17:45] face makes him worse
[1:17:48] it makes him worse he said that's the
[1:17:51] way it is with us when we travel from
[1:17:54] church to church from Pillar To Post
[1:17:57] from healing service to healing service
[1:18:00] notice he says take love and start
[1:18:04] forward until you get to the end of the
[1:18:07] road
[1:18:08] how many know that God is love love
[1:18:12] ain't this human emotion but God is love
[1:18:16] so you take love which is God and you
[1:18:19] hold on to him and you keep marching
[1:18:22] till the end of the road
[1:18:24] and when you do then God is obligated to
[1:18:29] cut on the seed
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:34] Hallelujah
[1:18:36] he's obligated to notice you take love
[1:18:39] and start forward till you get to the
[1:18:41] end of the road when love has met its
[1:18:44] fill
[1:18:46] God's obligated to help
[1:18:49] when you've come to your end and man's
[1:18:52] met their end then Grace
[1:18:56] takes over
[1:18:58] it's God's nature
[1:19:01] to do so
[1:19:03] notice in the midst of of the either of
[1:19:06] the age that we're living in with all
[1:19:08] the unbelief the darkest time the world
[1:19:11] already falling apart
[1:19:13] God's love and Grace has reigned and
[1:19:16] brought up a pride in this age
[1:19:20] we've taken his word and we've walked
[1:19:23] with it all the way to the end despite
[1:19:25] what all the naysayers say and let me
[1:19:29] tell you God will stand for you as you
[1:19:31] stand for God
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:39] your sisters think that I'm just
[1:19:41] preaching to the man
[1:19:43] you you young sisters in that whole row
[1:19:45] you just think I'm preaching to these
[1:19:48] young men what about you
[1:19:49] what about the sisters and the message
[1:19:51] what they have to deal with what they've
[1:19:54] got to put up with
[1:19:56] hello somebody no doubt silently they're
[1:20:00] shot there and they're held on to God's
[1:20:02] word when it seemed like nobody cares
[1:20:05] but nobody cares
[1:20:08] I'll carry it for you
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:17] I want to tell you this evening God
[1:20:19] always proves his word
[1:20:24] we see the Bible tells us in Revelation
[1:20:27] chapter 22 and 17 the spirit
[1:20:31] and the bride
[1:20:34] what do they say
[1:20:36] they say come
[1:20:38] so in other words God Scripture says
[1:20:41] that they would and we're here to prove
[1:20:43] that we should
[1:20:47] Hallelujah we were reading in the Bible
[1:20:50] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:20:52] angel
[1:20:53] but we want to bring it all the way back
[1:20:55] to right now we start off with with a
[1:20:59] little bit of a history lesson tonight
[1:21:01] are you with me
[1:21:03] notice we find out in the days of Adam
[1:21:06] God told Adam in the day that thou Ed is
[1:21:10] that thou shalt surely die someone say
[1:21:13] surely
[1:21:14] God said you will die and when they
[1:21:17] partook they did die and we know that
[1:21:20] God proved his
[1:21:23] he proved his word notice president said
[1:21:26] Adam and Eve sinned against the true
[1:21:29] word
[1:21:29] they said that there wasn't some made-up
[1:21:32] Doctrine it was in a man's Doctrine but
[1:21:36] they sinned against the true word but
[1:21:39] all he said notice the generations that
[1:21:42] followed them began to do the same thing
[1:21:47] and when they did he pronounced death
[1:21:51] upon them God said I will destroy man
[1:21:58] he said all will destroy Beast
[1:22:02] I will destroy the creeping thing
[1:22:06] and the fowls of the air
[1:22:09] and we find out that in the days of Noah
[1:22:12] some would say Noah
[1:22:13] in the days of Noah our Prophet came and
[1:22:16] he told us there were all kinds of
[1:22:19] minister
[1:22:24] in the days of Noah there were all
[1:22:27] there were all kinds of ministers in the
[1:22:29] days of Noah
[1:22:31] he tells there are all kinds of
[1:22:33] ministers he said there are all kinds of
[1:22:35] associations
[1:22:37] all kinds of religions so when the Bible
[1:22:41] tells us as it was in the days of Noah
[1:22:44] so shall it be also in the days of the
[1:22:48] son of man we've got all kinds of
[1:22:51] ministers all kinds of associations all
[1:22:55] kinds of religions
[1:22:57] but notice brother Braham said and God
[1:22:59] sent his Prophet Noah
[1:23:02] notice to prove that he had sent his
[1:23:05] word
[1:23:07] and tell them that there was going to be
[1:23:10] a coming destruction someone say
[1:23:13] destruction
[1:23:15] notice he was saying that he could stand
[1:23:17] no longer he could not stand the way
[1:23:20] that the people were doing that he had
[1:23:24] to destroy man that he once created
[1:23:28] notice but God proved his word how did
[1:23:31] he do it by sending a flood
[1:23:34] so in other words we find out that God
[1:23:36] whatever that he says he follows through
[1:23:39] on his word
[1:23:42] in the days of Abraham
[1:23:45] God told Abraham I will make of thee a
[1:23:50] great nation
[1:23:52] and in Romans 4 speaking on Abraham's
[1:23:56] behalf the Bible says who against hope
[1:24:00] believed in Hope
[1:24:03] that he might become the father of many
[1:24:07] nations
[1:24:08] according to that which was spoken so
[1:24:11] shall thy seed be
[1:24:15] and be not weak in faith
[1:24:18] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:24:22] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:24:25] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:24:29] he staggered not somebody say staggered
[1:24:33] he's staggered not
[1:24:35] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:24:39] but was strong in faith
[1:24:42] giving glory to God
[1:24:47] and being fully persuaded that which he
[1:24:50] had promised he was able also
[1:24:54] to perform
[1:24:57] so Abraham was fully persuaded
[1:25:01] what that God had promised God was able
[1:25:04] to do
[1:25:06] notice brother Brown says that he proved
[1:25:08] it
[1:25:10] notice after all those years he turned
[1:25:13] Abraham and Cyril back to a young woman
[1:25:16] and had the baby
[1:25:20] Hallelujah
[1:25:21] God always proves his
[1:25:25] God always proves his
[1:25:28] God always proves his word
[1:25:32] always bruising
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:49] we don't serve no weakling God
[1:25:53] we don't serve no Mommy pambi
[1:25:57] come on through
[1:25:59] it I said who Christians are running
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:04] sister Christians are rolling
[1:26:14] sister in my sister Christians are
[1:26:17] running
[1:26:22] sister Cheryl
[1:26:24] sister Christians are rugged

[1:26:32] how many sisters we have in the building
[1:26:36] I'm looking at you now
[1:26:39] are you rugged
[1:26:50] good
[1:26:53] in the days of law
[1:26:56] was told the Lord will destroy this city
[1:27:01] and we find out that his own family
[1:27:04] members mocked him
[1:27:06] they were mocking law they were looking
[1:27:09] around and saying where is this fire
[1:27:11] gonna come from
[1:27:14] it's the same that it is today as it was
[1:27:17] in those days of law the people are
[1:27:19] looking around they wonder where is this
[1:27:21] fire gonna come from well let me tell
[1:27:24] you if God said it would happen he'll
[1:27:27] always prove his word
[1:27:31] better where it takes place
[1:27:34] Fire's gonna hit this world church I'm
[1:27:37] telling you boys and girls tonight you
[1:27:39] better get ready you better get in you
[1:27:42] better get your family in you better put
[1:27:45] the blood all over them Hallelujah

[1:29:20] would sojourn in Egypt for 400 years
[1:29:26] and God had told Abraham he said Abram
[1:29:29] no of Surety
[1:29:32] that thy seed shall be a stranger in the
[1:29:37] land that is not theirs and Shall Serve
[1:29:41] them and they shall afflict them

[1:30:37] know what to expect every service either
[1:30:41] but either way God comes on the scene
[1:30:49] notice for the Bible says out in the
[1:30:51] backside of the desert one day
[1:30:55] he said the Holy Ghost came down in the
[1:30:57] form of the pillar of fire and settled
[1:31:00] in a bush
[1:31:02] and said I have heard the grounds of my
[1:31:05] people and I remember

[1:34:32] he said what would a Crooked Stick be
[1:34:37] to ten thousand Spears
[1:34:45] you get the picture
[1:34:47] how how ridiculous a scene that would be
[1:34:50] Here Comes This Old Man his his wife
[1:34:53] she's probably just wondering where
[1:34:56] they're going to find to eat that they
[1:34:57] could all agree
[1:35:00] oh man
[1:35:03] and then they wonder why you don't talk
[1:35:05] in 12 hours
[1:35:16] somebody sprayed me down
[1:35:22] those he said it depends he said where
[1:35:25] his word is
[1:35:27] no he said Moses had his word and
[1:35:30] Pharaoh had his Spears
[1:35:35] nevertheless God delivers Israel
[1:35:40] and God proves his
[1:35:43] God proves his word
[1:35:45] notice and then after Israel they're
[1:35:48] taking him out on this Wilderness
[1:35:50] Journey brother said and he came to pass
[1:35:53] that they disbelieved this prophet
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:04] all right
[1:36:08] and it came to pass
[1:36:10] brother Sean
[1:36:12] that they disbelieved
[1:36:15] their prophet
[1:36:18] brother Leo
[1:36:22] oh if you want a chat you could hit the
[1:36:24] video later don't worry
[1:36:26] but I'm getting it out of a message God
[1:36:28] proving his word
[1:36:29] if you don't already
[1:36:32] know
[1:36:34] and he preached it twice just in case
[1:36:36] and we're
[1:36:37] kind of
[1:36:39] dealing with both
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:44] but notice the willingness Journey
[1:36:47] and it came to pass that they
[1:36:49] disbelieved this Prophet after seeing
[1:36:52] the word so confirmed
[1:36:56] somebody said confirmed
[1:36:58] they see that it happened over and over
[1:37:02] and over and over and over again and
[1:37:06] they come out to the Wilderness journey
[1:37:08] and all of a sudden they start to
[1:37:11] disbelieve this prophet
[1:37:14] and they started looking at each other
[1:37:17] as they were coming out of the
[1:37:19] Wilderness Journey they started looking
[1:37:21] at each other
[1:37:22] and this one would come and give this
[1:37:24] one a little medal and he would give him
[1:37:28] maybe a paper or or something that was
[1:37:31] written that said oh doctor of a
[1:37:34] Preacher
[1:37:38] and then this one had come over and give
[1:37:41] this one a little something and say oh
[1:37:43] doctor of theology
[1:37:47] and they started having each other these
[1:37:49] little things as they were coming out of
[1:37:52] the wilderness
[1:37:54] well no wonder they started to
[1:37:56] disbelieve their profit
[1:37:58] they started looking at each other
[1:38:02] started handing battles and pans and
[1:38:05] great things oh you're a great man and
[1:38:07] you're a great man oh you're a great man
[1:38:11] oh let me give you this title of
[1:38:14] Pharisee
[1:38:17] I think we'll write this title of
[1:38:20] sadducey on this paper and painted on
[1:38:23] you or maybe we'll handle oh you're a
[1:38:26] herodian
[1:38:27] or maybe come on church or you're this
[1:38:30] or you're that and they started looking
[1:38:32] at each other
[1:38:35] instead of looking at The Giver of Life
[1:38:39] and all of a sudden they started to
[1:38:41] disbelieve their profit after seeing the
[1:38:44] word
[1:38:45] confirmed and confirmed and confirmed
[1:38:52] I hope you see where we're going
[1:38:54] [Applause]
[1:39:04] notice
[1:39:06] and in the wilderness Journey it came to
[1:39:09] pass
[1:39:10] that they disbelieved this prophet
[1:39:14] after seeing the word being so confirmed
[1:39:18] notice brother Brandon takes that and
[1:39:20] immediately goes into this
[1:39:23] he says oh he said the bride got out of
[1:39:26] Step
[1:39:30] notice what he said he said oh look at
[1:39:33] what they had done they started to
[1:39:34] disbelieve and what had happened he said
[1:39:37] the bride had God out of Step
[1:39:41] and notice what happens when the bride
[1:39:43] gets out of Step the prophet had to come
[1:39:46] back and say get in line
[1:39:49] get back in line get back in line and
[1:39:54] when somebody you love maybe they
[1:39:56] started to disbelieve

[2:03:53] before the foundation of the world how
[2:03:56] by his foreknowledge
[2:03:59] he knew he knew who would be here he
[2:04:03] knew who would be here as his evidence
[2:04:07] brother that's why he trusts you
[2:04:16] if somebody is going to represent me I
[2:04:19] better trust them
[2:04:22] and despite yourself

[2:05:00] he predestinated it
[2:05:03] to this
[2:05:05] by his foreknowledge
[2:05:08] unbelief has not scared our God
[2:05:12] people leaving people fleeing people
[2:05:14] running people hiding does not
[2:05:17] come on Church

[2:05:56] you feel it did you see it did you
[2:05:58] understand it that's what's happening
[2:06:00] today do you feel it yes do you see it
[2:06:04] do you understand it
[2:06:07] Hallelujah notice he said by his far
[2:06:10] knowledge
[2:06:11] when he predestinated it in Malachi 4.
[2:06:16] it's got to happen
[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:26] if God at what point
[2:06:28] had his word and he he said oh if you
[2:06:32] eat from here you're gonna die
[2:06:34] and he proved his word
[2:06:36] come on church he proved his word to
[2:06:38] adamant to Eve
[2:06:39] and he proved it to Noah and he proved
[2:06:42] it to Abraham
[2:06:44] and he proved it to Paul and he proved
[2:06:46] it to Wesley and he proved it to Luther
[2:06:49] and he proved it to Pentecost and he's
[2:06:51] putting it in an eye how he said that
[2:06:55] you would have a church without spot or
[2:06:58] wrinkle and he's proving it when
[2:07:02] where's there there land
[2:07:06] Hallelujah
[2:07:08] Hallelujah right now
[2:07:11] he said all we have what why do you
[2:07:13] think
[2:07:14] [Applause]
[2:07:23] so it's written
[2:07:25] hello
[2:07:27] it's written in the scriptures and he
[2:07:30] said it's going to happen and it's nice
[2:07:32] just to look and say
[2:07:33] it's going to happen
[2:07:38] and you say well it's happening right
[2:07:40] now oh no but he says it's going to
[2:07:42] happen
[2:07:48] brother when he told Noah that there was
[2:07:50] going to be a flood
[2:07:52] what if Noah would have said yeah but
[2:07:53] you know he said that they would surely
[2:07:55] die
[2:08:00] but he needed it to happen in his day
[2:08:02] that's right
[2:08:07] this is where we get the argument
[2:08:10] between the message and the Bible
[2:08:18] [Music]
[2:08:24] right
[2:08:26] he said well I believe the Bible but uh
[2:08:28] the message scares me
[2:08:34] well no one could have said oh I believe
[2:08:36] in what happened with Adam but when
[2:08:38] you're telling me scares me
[2:08:41] he had to accept the word
[2:08:44] for his day
[2:08:49] I think it's about time we stopped
[2:08:51] looking to the day's past
[2:08:54] and find out what's happening in our day
[2:08:57] [Applause]
[2:08:58] and here we've come to our day with
[2:09:01] Malachi 4 5.
[2:09:03] and Malachi 45 guess what happens it
[2:09:06] comes out of the pages
[2:09:14] in Revelation 10 7 comes off the pages
[2:09:17] here
[2:09:22] what age was I predestinated for
[2:09:26] the last days oh I'm here
[2:09:30] the Bible said I'll be here
[2:09:33] the Bible said I'm here I'm out of the
[2:09:35] pain
[2:09:36] [Applause]
[2:09:41] sure is like man believers
[2:09:47] and then the Bible said in Revelations
[2:09:49] 22 that the spirit and the bride would
[2:09:54] say
[2:09:55] and we come after somebody come on
[2:09:57] [Applause]
[2:10:01] wake up and come out of the page get out
[2:10:05] of it not only in word only come off the
[2:10:09] page

[2:11:26] when he come over and predestinates
[2:11:29] anything to happen in his word
[2:11:31] he had to prove his word to be so
[2:11:36] when he predestinates anything to happen
[2:11:38] and says it will happen he knows that
[2:11:41] seed will be there just at that time
[2:11:45] he predestinated a bride someone say

[2:25:29] and it's not by our abilities or our
[2:25:32] strengths or our our willpower

[2:31:53] you're expressing to him tonight
[2:31:57] he's in love
[2:31:59] he loves you
[2:32:05] if you could think about your love for
[2:32:06] him and how you want to express that to
[2:32:09] him
[2:32:09] me
[2:32:11] and then you look back at everything

[2:32:21] It's A Love Affair friends
[2:32:23] he loves you

[2:32:31] point of view
[2:32:33] he loves you
[2:32:37] bless the Lord
[2:32:39] and I'm so glad that a prophet didn't
[2:32:42] need any goody goody spray
[2:32:46] I'm so glad the prophet just kept right
[2:32:48] on her preaching
[2:32:51] because the angel of the Lord already
[2:32:52] let him know that that voice on those
[2:32:55] tapes were going to be needed right here
[2:32:57] in 2023.
[2:32:59] Hallelujah
