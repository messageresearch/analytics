See, God has provided [screaming] that we can have what the whole world's been searching [screaming] for. See the answer is calary. [screaming] Now, who who would go to the market place to buy a brand new car? or dig [singing] a hole way down in the ground in search of a shining star.

[applause] [music] As we invite the men of God, can we sing this? Amazing grace shall always [music and singing] be my song of praise. &gt;&gt; For it [singing] was [music] grace that bought my [singing] liberty. I do not know [singing] just why he [singing] came [music] to love &gt;&gt; to love me so. Oh my. But he looked [singing] beyond &gt;&gt; all my faults tonight and so my need. I shall I shall forever live [music] my [singing] eyes to Calary to [singing] view [music] the cross where Jesus died for me.

[singing] The grace that call my boy [music] he ly on [singing and music] my fault and soul [music] &gt;&gt; my Amen. And [applause and music] that's definitely one of my [music] favorite songs. That God was so big that he could [music] look beyond my faults and he could see my need. that God could look down past my humanity, past my flesh, past everything contrary [music] that his scripture is, and he could look down and say, &gt;&gt; "They need redemption. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, &gt;&gt; they need my word. They need my love. God, &gt;&gt; I'm going to look past their faults and I'm going to see their need." How many are thankful for that here this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. And did you enjoy the word of the Lord here this morning? [applause] Amen. Definitely uh just good stuff to write down and keep in your memory bank. A lot of just nutrition for the journey there and just just a lot of good word scriptures and quotes and &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh just thankful for the Lord here for that and to attend a church that has that. And uh if we could, I won't keep you very very long here this evening. I got a a few scriptures uh that we've put down here. And if we could, I'd like to go ahead and start in the book of Number or uh yeah, Numbers 13th chapter, the 26th verse. And I believe the last time that uh we spoke uh we were talking about the new land. And it's kind of a subject that uh I just don't feel justice, you know, um by only going kind of halfway with it in order to get a point across because, you know, as I was telling brother Wind, you know, mama didn't really raise no quitter. Um you know, I might butcher it all the way. I might butcher it all the way. I might not be the the the best person for the subject, but at least I know something about the subject. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, but if we could, we'd like to go ahead and go into the scripture here, Numbers 13 and 26 through through the um 33rd verse. But if you're there, just say amen. And um and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the wilderness of Pyan to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land. And they told him and said, "We came unto the land whether thou sent us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the people be strong in the land or strong that dwell in the land, and cities are walled and very great. And moreover, we saw the children of Anoch there, and the Amalachites dwell in the land of the south, and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. And Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are able to overcome it." But the man that went But the men that went up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we." And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land the uh the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. And they we saw the giants, and the sons of Anoch, which come of the giants, and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers. And so we were in their sight. And as the Lord adds the blessing to the reading of his word, you could be seated here this evening or this this evening. And [snorts] and as as I said before, just to kind of maybe just give a quick recap of what we had talked about uh the last sermon dealing with this subject and we were dealing with Israel and their journey to the promised land. And at the beginning of our last service, we had talked about how that Israel was in Egypt and how that God had brought them out of Egypt and they had brought them up to the Red Sea and God again delivered them at the Red Sea and then from out of the Red Sea they were going to the promised land and God had done many of miracles for the children of Israel. He had brought them water. He had given them mana. He had given them he had given them flesh to eat that he had provided just different uh just different things he had provided for them along the journey. And now coming coming up to this Israel had had been provided for by the Lord for all of the different things. And they had murmured against Moses and the way that he had done things. And then where we had left off is where we had come up to the point that throughout that period of time in the wilderness that they had come to the point where God was leading them to the promised land there at Kadesh Barnea. And there at Kadesh he had brought the children of Israel there and they had come and they had of course where we had read where we had left off that there were spies that had went out into the land and they had come back and they'd come back with this report that we read here and the but out of the 10 spies there was two of them. Now notice that we had read there that it was Caleb. It was one there was Joshua and Caleb one of the two or two of the 10 spies that had went over there and they had come back and they had brought the evidence of it. Now something that I would like to kind of pin note there would be the evidence that they had brought from the new land. Now it now they said from their own mouth that yes it flows. Yes it's a land that flows with milk and honey. Yes it's a land. So everything that God had said was true. But yet they had come to the point where they in their disbelief is where they angered God. And now we can go there in numbers 14 and 21 through the 25th verse. It says, "But truly as I live, and all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, because all those men which have said seen," now think about this. This isn't just something that they heard of. This isn't just something that was written in stone somewhere, but these people seen this thing, seen these things with their own eyes. They said, "Because they all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now or tempted me now these 10 times, and I have not and have not hearkened to my voice. Surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto the fathers, neither shall any of them that provoke me see it. But my servant Caleb," now there's Caleb again being brought there into the mix. And he says, "But my servant Caleb, because he has another spirit within him." Now God God specifically begins to pinpoint Caleb out. And he's beginning to pin he says that because he's of another spirit now. Now now and also Caleb was one of the ones that came from the other from the other spies to give a good report a report of faith. But yet we know where the children of Israel were their report which report that they believe. But he says here surely they shall not see the land. which I swear unto the fathers, neither shall any of them that have promote provoked me see him, but my servant Caleb, because he has another or he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully. Uh, him will I bring unto the land wherewith he went, and his seed shall possess it. Now the 25th verse, now the Amalachites and the Canaanites dwell into the valley. tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea. Now we see that at this point that that that it that the whole entire journey and everything up to this point that everything was in vain at this point because they had come up to the border there and they rejected they rejected they didn't believe that God was able to provide uh a way of safe passage that they didn't believe that God was able to keep his word and what he had done in the things in the past he was they were they they they they counted God as a God of yesterday. They counted God maybe as a god of the past. They counted God as as something well he did it back then. Now I'm facing this new situation. No doubt at that period of time they never fought giants or they never they never fought uh of these strong these walled cities. But yet nevertheless no matter the circumstance God was expecting them to count him faithful. And it was because of their unbelief after the miracles that God had shown them. Now the miracles that they physically seen with their eyes that they physically experienced that they physically uh and nobody nobody up to that time had ever had ever smoke a rock and water had come. Nobody at that period of time had ever woke up in the morning and seen mana there on the on the on the ground. Nobody had seen flesh uh that was cooked come down from heaven. Nobody had seen these things. So surely you would have thought Israel would have been fully persuaded that God would been able to do anything. But yet all of the things that GOD HAD DONE, ALL of the miracles that he performed, Israel was still dwelling in unbelief. And we know that you can't have unbelief in mixed with faith with in your walk with God or you'll crumble. So So God begins to come down and and he sees the unbelief here and he's like, I can't do nothing with these people. they're just going TO HAVE TO GO UP into the wilderness. And he give them a mountain to go up on. And and he he told them to terried there in the wilderness. And it was like 30 to or it's like 38 to 40 years. It was 40 years that they begin to go around in this wilderness. And in this time, I mean, these people, these people again, they weren't in the promised land that God had problem or that God had promised them, but yet they were in the wilderness on the outside of the land that God had promised them. So there was no place that they could call home. There was no place that they could call theirs. There was no place that that that that they could go freely, that they could water their cattle, that their children could be raised, that they could that they could plant vineyards, that they could build homes. They couldn't do none of this cuz this land was inhabited by another. Now along this along this uh along the journey there the reason they couldn't the reason that they couldn't possess the land was because there in Deuteronomy 2 2 and9 the Lord had spoke to Moses and he says and ye have come past this mountain long enough. &gt;&gt; Now we're jumping a little bit ahead here. You know this is the reason because we if we theoretically we could sit back and say well why didn't if Israel was without number when they was and they didn't have they had armies they had this and they had that and and there was fighting that why didn't they possess any of the land that was there why didn't they just stay on this side of the promised land just outnumber everybody and just take over everything that was there but but God spoke Moses to said and said this he says ye have come past this mountain long enough turn you northward and command thou thy people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren of the children of Esau, which dwell in Sire, and they shall be afraid of you, and take ye of heed unto yourselves. Meddal not with them, for I will not give you of their land, no, not such as a foot breath, because I have given mount sir unto Esau for a possession. Ye shall buy of them uh uh for money or ye shall you shall buy meat of them for money that you may eat and you shall also buy water of them that you may drink. For the Lord hath blessed him in all the works of thy hand. He knoweth thy walking through the this great wilderness. These 40 years the the Lord thy God hath been with thee. Thou hast lacked nothing. And when we passed uh by from the brethren of the children of Esau, which dwelt in Sire through the way of the plain of Edom, from we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness. And the Lord said, "Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in the battle. For I have not given thee of the land of uh gi for a possession, because I have given uh unto the children of the lot for a possession." So there was nothing for the children of Israel for them to possess outside of the land of promise. There was nothing for them that God didn't give them the land in the wilderness. Therefore therefore they had problems in the wilderness. God could not bless them in the wilderness. God couldn't God couldn't come down and yes he if you want to say that he they laid in his permissive will. Yes, he would bless them because they were the children, but yet they weren't in the pro promised land, but yet God was teaching him through the struggles and through the trials and through the situations. We can go we can go uh we can go and look and we can see in the in in in the scripture where here that nevertheless that Israel was in the wilderness and they were in the confusion and they and they were they were going through battles for 40 years and and now looking at this you can see that they they they had they had brothers that was with them there in Numbers 14 or 20 and 14 through 18. Y'all just y'all just let me just kind of lay this out here so we can try to see the whole entire thing as a whole. But it says here in Numbers 20 and 14-18, and Moses sent messengers. Now, this is the children of Israel in the wilderness. Okay? Now, in the wilderness, they're trying to navigate their way through. They're trying to, you know, they're trying to settle in there. They're trying to, you know, hey, make some friends and do this, but that land's not theirs. And God was going to make sure that they weren't comfortable in the land that they were in. It says here, "And Moses sent messengers from gate Kadesh unto the king of Eden. Thus saith thy brother." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Not your neighbor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not your longtime friend once removed. Thy brother Israel. Thou knowest all the TO THE TRAVAIL THAT hath befallen us. How our fathers went down in Egypt, and how we dwelt in Egypt a long time. And the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers. And when we cried out unto the Lord, &gt;&gt; uhhuh, &gt;&gt; he heard our voice and sent an angel and have brought us forth of Egypt. And behold, we are in Kadesh and in the city of the most of the uttermost of the borders. Let us, I pray thee, through thy country. We will not pass through thy fields, through the vineyards, neither drink of the water of the wells, that we will go the king's highway, and we will not go to the right or left. We will we until we have passed through the borders. And Edom said unto him, "Thou shalt not pass by me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Lest I come out against thee with the sword. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Talk about uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, you Israel's thinking, "Hey, I'm just going to go talk to my bro and everything's going to be okay. Everything's going to be all right. I'm going to live next to him. We're going to live next to each other and everything's okay." He says, "No, and if you do, I'm going to come at you by the sword." And so they're like, "Okay." So they try it again. They go they they go to A-Rod and they go to Silo and then next thing you know and and and they go to these two these other ones that are their brothers that are their kindred and they say don't come to my borders and in fact they go to the borders with swords and men and they they end up getting to a battle and Israel has to destroy every one of them and God's making sure that they're that they're not comfortable in this wilderness. They're making sure that they're not set in roots that they're not set in place. &gt;&gt; Okay. The wilderness was not their possession. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, Israel was out of their land and they went around this had to go around this mountain and this continuous cycle for 40 years to where they had to battle and they had to sustain and they had to fight this stuff and they had to they had in order to do these things they they couldn't plant here because this wasn't their land. It was it was this land and these people would constantly be trying to come back for it and they so they had to event they had to stay there. But during this time in the wilderness, you got to remember that there was an age group of people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That there was an age group of people of 20 and over that God had said, "I want every ONE OF YOU DEAD and nobody's going to go into the promised land until your corpse rots in the wilderness." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's kind of heavy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's kind of low down. And God tells you that I hate you so much that I'm going to wait until your corpse rots in the wilderness before I let your children even go over. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whoa. It's kind of a lot there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he just and during this time that in the wilderness, he's instructing his covenants and his laws and the and the children and these ones that these ones that that are that are the 20 and under, they're being instructed of the laws during this time in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Okay, now we're starting to make a transition. these two, the the Israel of old, the ones that had rejected, the ones that were unbelieving, the now they're instructing all of the young ones of the statutes of God and what God had done for them in Egypt and how that he provided them with water and how that he brought the mana and how that he he he had done ALL THESE GREAT BATTLES AND THROUGH THIS TIME PERIOD, all these OLD FIGHTERS BEGIN TO DIE OFF AND ALL THESE old ones that had seen the glory of the Lord in time past, they all begin TO DIE OFF. AND IT COME TO THE POINT THAT even Moses had come to his point in his time where he was going TO HAVE TO GO BY THE WAY OF THE GRAVE and you find that in the scriptures where you go and you see where where where these different ones were coming unto the promised land. Okay. Then you have Eleazar and God gives his commission to Moses to do what he needs to do to Eleazar and Eleazar is left there on the mountain and and God now God's coming and he's leading Moses and they're coming up to the promised land and he's instructing Joshua. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, Joshua was one of the two that were of a different spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. And he's instructing Joshua, hey, the time of those that are about the age of 20 are coming up of age and all the old the other ones are are are fight are are are dying UP. AND WHEN YOU GO UPON WHEN YOU COME UPON this new land, I want you to sacrifice like this. And I want you to give thanks like this. and I want you and I want you to do these things that are pleasing unto the Lord. And Joshua's standing back and he's wondering what he's GOING TO DO WITHOUT MOSES AROUND. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; And there's where we could stop the picture for a moment. &gt;&gt; Now, all of this, as we talked about in the sermon in the past, is nothing has all to do with Israel, but more so to do with you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and your walk with God &gt;&gt; and how you deal with things and how in your wilderness and where your journey is that you come with the Lord and where your where your stage is and where your walk is and and and and how you deal with the things of God. And we left off at the point where we come to Aanes BARNEA IN OUR LIFE TO where where we are GOING TO ACCEPT GOD. GOD HAS FINALLY BROUGHT US TO THE POINT, THE PINNACLE OF EVERYTHING that we've learned, everything that we're seeing, everything that that that WE'VE HEARD THROUGH THE MESSAGES, EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE heard through the scriptures and and and the sermons that ARE PREACHED AND WE BROUGHT UP AND HE SAYS, "GO AND POSSESS YOUR MOUNTAIN." AND WE STEP BACK AND WE ACT AS IF GOD IS NOT ABLE. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; And God has to run you through the meal and AROUND THE MOUNTAIN 40 DIFFERENT TIMES. You can pick pick whatever your number is. You can pick how many ever years that you want to deal with that unbelief that's in your life. Whether it's year one, year two, year three, year four. And God puts you around that mountain until he begins to put all of that unbelief to death. And he begins to take all the unbelief out of his people. And all the unbelief begins to come and it begins to strangulate, amen, the the the the sin of unbelief out of your life. And you begin to see, amen, all of these old things BEGIN TO DIE OFF, AMEN, out of your life. And then you begin to see where God is ushering in a new era for the believer. Now, we've come from justification. And we've come from sanctification. Amen. We we've BEEN WE'VE BEEN PULLED OUT of Egypt, the world. AMEN. AND GOD HAS BROUGHT SHOWN THE LIGHT OF THIS MESSAGE over us TO CALL US OUT OUT OF EGYPT. NOW, think about it. Egypt talked about THE GARLICS AND THEY'RE ALWAYS WANTING TO GO BACK to the garlics and and and and and and God was wanting to come AND JUST BURN OUT ALL THOSE BRIDGES AND DESTROY IT WITH THE RED SEA. And now that we've come to THIS PLACE IN OUR WALK, AMEN. What are we going to do when we come to THE BORDER OF GOD'S PROMISE FOR YOUR LIFE? &gt;&gt; OKAY, &gt;&gt; I can go back and I can look here. Now, we're talking about the life that parallels with the journey. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now look here. I thought this was an I thought this was an interesting quote if I could just find it here. It says, "A man outside of Caven knows nothing. He's still wandering." Not saying that he's not a good man. I don't say that. I don't say that a man even in Egypt's not a good man. But until he comes into this possession and the possession that the promise that we give to the church is not a natural land but it's a spiritual land for we are a royal priesthood a holy nation then in this royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people called out elected chosen set aside then all the world is dead on the outside and we are led by the spirit sons and daughters daughters of God, led by the spirit of God, NOT BY MAN, BUT BY THE SPIRIT. SO, now that we've talked about that, this man, Amen, doesn't that this man knows nothing and he's still wandering, you're still trying to figure out where you are in the plan of God, wandering in between Egypt and the promised land. &gt;&gt; Still wandering IN BETWEEN JUSTIFICATION AND SANCTIFICATION. You know, I got to be good here and has God called ME OR HAS GOD CALLED me not? YOU KNOW, OR OR OR you know what? I I seen the miracles, amen, boldly with my eyes through brother window. Or I seen boldly through my eyes, amen, the the prayer requests that were answered, amen, through this brother or that brother. AMEN. AND YOU'VE SEEN ALL THESE things and you come to that place and you come to your SPEIA AND YOU REJECT GOD. &gt;&gt; OKAY? &gt;&gt; Just like the children of Israel did. They come to that point and the believer comes to that point in their walk WHERE YOU WILL ACCEPT AND YOU WILL WALK INTO the promised LAND OR YOU'LL REJECT GOD AND YOU'LL STAY IN SANCTIFICATION AND IN JUSTIFICATION. AMEN. And you'll not move on into the new land. &gt;&gt; What is the new land? As we talked about in the times back, y'all y'all just bear with me. I got to make that transition. Amen. Amen. Over into there. It's kind of like, you know, how many of you ever standed boards? you know, you got two boards that are like this, you know, and and you're trying to transition those two and you just got to sand them down, you know, until until it gets to that point where it's all leveled out. And that's where we're trying to get to is just leveling it out here. Amen. So you you're trying so you come to that place where there's a rest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You got to come to a rest with God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It says they are like the children of Israel who came out of Egypt AND STOPPED SHORT OF THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; OKAY. that deserved a wow. &gt;&gt; And they STOPPED SHORT OF THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Who came out of Egypt and stopped short of the promised land. Now those children of Israel left out about 2 million strong. They all JOURNEYED TOGETHER. ALL SAW THE SAME MIRACLES. ALL partaken of the same mana. all the water FROM THE SMITTEN ROCK AND FOLLOWED THE same cloud by day and the pillar of power by power by night. Only two reached the promised land. Only two were the real believers. That is correct because the word tells you THAT THE REST DIED BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF. And because of their unbelief, they could not enter. Hebrews 13:19. Then since it is so the only two that entered, the rest were not true believers. What made the difference? two stayed with the word when the hearts of the 10 spies failed AT KANES BARNEA, JOSHUA and Caleb did not stagger, for they believed the word that was said, "We are more than able to take the land." They knew they could because God had said, "I have given you the land." After all the Israelites saw the power and the goodness and the deliverance of God, they did not enter into rest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They did not enter into rest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You've seen how God can deliver those that are underneath drugs and alcohol. You seen how God can deliver out of depression. You seen how God can can miraculously create a liver. You seen how God can restore eyes. You seen how God can come down in the power of this world or come down in the power of the word. Amen. Manifest through bodies and MANIFEST THROUGH THE WORD. Manifest through songs. Manifest through ALL THESE THINGS. AND YOU CAN COME TO CHURCH AND YOU REJECT GOD'S WORD WHEN IT STANDS BEFORE YOUR EYES. YOU STAND AS AN UNBELIEVER, UNPOWERED, NOT ABLE TO MOVE ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE YOU COME TO THE BORDER OF YOUR PROMISE AND YOU COUNT GOD AS UNFAITHFUL. &gt;&gt; You count him as unfaithful when you nonchalotely walk INTO THE CHURCH DOORS AND YOU ACT as if GOD IS JUST SOMETHING ELSE. AMEN. that you can just come and you could just you could just put your time in and you could walk out and you wonder where wonder why you're going through the trials. You wonder why you're going through THE SITUATIONS AND YOU WONDER WHY IT'S BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD TO PREVAIL. I mean for the things that ARE IN YOUR LIFE, YOU MUST ENTER INTO REST THAT GOD IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. &gt;&gt; WHAT is the Holy Ghost? What is it? IT'S A REST. IT &gt;&gt; IS GOD COMING IN AND IT'S COVERING THE FIBERS AND THE PORES OF THE OF OF of the world. I loved how brother Window talked about it. He talked about the shittwood &gt;&gt; and he talked about how the gold being overlaid over the shittwood. What is that shittwood? That shitwood is it's not just it's just a little porous, you know, it's it's it's it's just horrible wood and it's just horrible. And that's what you are. You're a horrible wood. You weren't fit for nothing. You weren't fit for anything to build. Amen. For the master's use, amen. But yet that your pits and your scars and the things that you've gone through of unbelief can be sewed up and that could be soaked in by the deity of the Holy Ghost and God's spirit to where it could COVER EVERY PORE OF unbelief in your life to where all that reflects is the MANIFESTATION OF GOD'S GLORY OF HIS WORD. AMEN. BEING DISTRIBUTED, MANIFESTED throughout elite body of a group of believers on this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; So they come up into that promise and they come up to that place and now now they come to that place and they've laid everything. The prophet the prophet is off the scene. Now they come to this place AND NOW JOSHUA WAS holding the bag. Joshua's standing there and he's like he's just like whoa. And you know he had just come off of this scene where where Moses was. Could you imagine filling the shoes of Moses? &gt;&gt; Not I, you know, not I. You're talking about somebody that You're talking about somebody that went out there and he split the Red Sea with a stick. You're talking about somebody that just looked up and fire rain from heaven. He come out and he he come out and the the the the the river Euphrates, the one that the God that that they worshiped, the mother, the birth of all living things around that area, God defied their their the God that they served by turning it into blood and made it unhabitable. Made it to where to where every living thing could had to escape from it. You couldn't DRINK FROM IT. GOD HAD DONE ALL THESE THINGS THROUGH MOSES. And now Joshua's like, "Me?" Yeah. You &gt;&gt; and you and you. &gt;&gt; And you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he looks at this and you can go back and you can find in the scripture right here. You can find in Joshua 1 and5. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee in all the days of thy life. As I I That was not Donald Trump. Donald Trump didn't say as I &gt;&gt; was with Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't your granddad. It wasn't your mom. It wasn't doctor so and so. It wasn't this person. He says he says therefore not any man stand before thee. As I was with Moses, so shall I be with thee, and I will not fail thee, nor will I forsake thee. Amen. You got to be able to come up and be able to you be able to come to your promised land and be able to be like, you know what? AMEN. I'M TIRED of living in the wilderness and I'm TIRED OF I'M TIRED OF LIVING WITHOUT PURPOSE. I'M TIRED OF SERVING GOD WITHOUT PURPOSE. I'M TIRED OF COMING TO church and I'm TIRED OF SITTING ON A PEW and I'm tired of just listening to what THE PREACHER SAID. I'M TIRED OF JUST LISTENING TO A QUOTE. I'M TIRED OF JUST READING THINGS, AMEN, HALF-HAZARDLY AND NONCHALANTLY. AMEN. BUT I'M READY TO walk into the FRUITS OF THE PROMISED LAND. AMEN. THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN. I've seen the miracles through William Brandon's ministry. I'VE SEEN THE MIRACLES NOT ONLY THROUGH HIS MINISTRY, BUT DIFFERENT ONES. DARYL WARD HAD HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS BROUGHT BACK. HER SIGHT WAS BROUGHT BACK. AMEN. THAT'S A LIVING TESTIMONY OF THE EVIDENCE. AMEN. THAT GOD IS BROUGHT BACK TO US THAT HE'S LIVING, THAT HE'S REAL. AND THAT SAME POWER THAT DWELLS IN THOSE MEN AND THAT DWELT IN THAT DWELT IN THOSE PEOPLE CAN COME AND IT can inlay itself through the Holy Ghost inside you. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we begin to see, you know, I begin to match things. You know, sometimes if you're not, you begin to see things and you begin to know things by its characteristics. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, some of your children, you adults, I could tell exactly who whose children they belong to by those characteristics. &gt;&gt; Poor Dylan and Austin. [panting] I can see their characteristics of who they belong to. [panting and sighs] I can see those things. I can see characteristics that are there. So all of a sudden you begin to look you know what you know there was a lot of people that was there that didn't hear Moses tell Joshua if as I was with as I was with or you know as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee was a lot of people that wasn't there so all of a sudden yeah the as a natural man as a natural woman you begin to look at the characteristics and you begin to look at the things that God did with Moses and if God was with Moses then he'll be with Joshua so you begin to see right there in Joshua 3 and 15 and they said and they said that and as they said they they bear the ark were were coming uh unto Jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water. For Jordan overflowed at its bank at a time of harvest that the waters which came from from the above stood and rose upon the heap of the far uh from the city of Adam that was beside Zeratan. and those that came downward to the sea of the plain even at the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed right over against Jericho. Now think about this. You got Joshua splitting water and then you got Moses splitting water, you know, and and there in Joshua 6 and 20. So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets. And it came to pass that when the people had heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout, you see that Joshua was beginning to move into the promised land and he's beginning to possess it. He's beginning to possess the land. Now think about this now. Now, now Joshua, now now the the whole purpose, the whole motive, the whole everything around Israel begins to change when they begin to go into the land that God had had had desired for them to have. Amen. Now they're stepping out of a place. Amen. They're stepping out of this. They're stepping out of this. I don't think, you know, I I don't belong here. You all these people are fighting me. All these things. And all it's doing is it's pushing them into their homeland. And now they step into this homeland. Now there's a difference when they step into this homeland is because God has positionally placed them to be in that land. He said that he'd given them a land that flowth with milk and honey. The milk and honey was there. THE 10 SPIES BROUGHT BACK THE PROOF THAT THE milk and honey was there, that the grapes were there, that the Hittites were there, that the Canaanites were there, that the Jebusites were there, and that WAS EVERYTHING THAT GOD SAID THAT THAT THAT was going to be there. But he said that IT WAS YOUR LAND TO TAKE. And so they had to the same faith that that that that the Israel before failed to have to go into the promised land is the same faith that the Israel that come to possess the land. THEY BEGIN TO WALK INTO THAT LAND BECAUSE THEY FULLHEARTEDLY BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS WITH THEM AND THAT GOD WOULD WOULD FIGHT FOR THEM AND GOD WOULD HELP THEM POSSESS THE LAND THAT THEY HAD AND GOD DID IT. AND EVERY TIME THEY CONQUERED a they conquered a Jericho, EVERY TIME THEY CONQUERED THE WALL AND THE FENCE CITIES and there was nothing that could stand before them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What was happening? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What was happening? Bless the Lord. It's good. &gt;&gt; What was happening? I'll tell you what happened. Just a second. I tell you what happened. Is that you weren't dealing with the same Israel before that Israel didn't know where she belonged. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That Israel, she was just stuck out into the wilderness. And God's just like, "Keep going to the promised land." and he's leaning on this Israel, you know, she's she's fighting this and she's fighting that, you know, but but but but but she she's she's chose to stay in the wilderness because she didn't want to move any further. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But there come a new age, if I could put it this way, there come another time where Israel had heard of it and they desire to possess the land. Now we look here they're in uh adoption one it says now he's talking to the spiritual Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel who's possessed the land or aren't you glad that you've come out of Egypt's garlic aren't you glad that you've come out of the wilderness and remember they had to eat mana angel's food out of heaven until they crossed over into the land and when crossed over into the land. Mana ceased to fall. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they were fully mature then. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; GOD wasn't having to go around and hold their hand everywhere that they go and they're like, "Hey, HE'S JUST OKAY. NOW, WATCH AS DADDY GOES over here and destroys the bad guys for you." You know, just just not having to hold their hand everywhere that they go. Stop sinning. Stop doing this. Stop doing that. is because they DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT GOD WOULD DO WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And remember, they had to eat mana, angels fruit out of heaven until they crossed over into the new land. And when they crossed over into the new land, mana ceased to fall. They were fully mature then. And they and they ate or and they ate the old corn of the land. Now, not now that you're not babies anymore. Let me say that again. and they eat the old corn of the land. Now, now that you're not babies anymore, now that you're not desiring the sincere milk of the gospel, &gt;&gt; can I can I preach? Is this all right? &gt;&gt; Not desire desiring to get off the milk, OFF GOD'S BOTTLE. desiring to GET OFF GOD'S BOTTLE TO BE ABLE to be a mature Christian. &gt;&gt; Not sitting here desiring what can the church do for me? &gt;&gt; What can God do for me with a with a welfare type mentality? What can what what what's God going to do for me? WHAT'S GOD NO. I'M A SON. &gt;&gt; WHAT CAN I DO TO ADVANCE HIS KINGDOM? WHAT DID God do when he was a young boy? Don't you not know that I must BE ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS? And this is a little kid. Amen. He's going out and he's debating with the Sadducees and the Pharisees. This this group of people that went into the promised land came mature. They came to saying WE'VE COME TO POSSESS THE land that God had given us. &gt;&gt; Gym mature and they ate the old corn of the land. Now they they're not babies anymore. That they're not desiring the sinc sincere milk of the gospel. that they don't they don't have to be babyed and powdered and and persuaded to come to church. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now, you're not desiring the sincere milk of the gospel. You don't have to be baby and p and persuaded to come to church now that you're fully matured. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter what Joe does to me. &gt;&gt; Joe's made me mad plenty of times. &gt;&gt; And Joe will continue to make me mad plenty of times. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But I don't come to church because of Joe. &gt;&gt; I don't come to church because because Joe comes to church. And if Joe fails me, then I'm not coming to church. &gt;&gt; I am fully persuaded. that the man that comes up behind this desk and the gospel that's being preached, amen, I AM FULLY PERSUADED THAT THAT IS MY MEAT, AMEN, FOR THIS DAY AND IN THIS HOUR. THEREFORE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME, AMEN, TO BE AT CHURCH. You don't have to tell me to listen to tape. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME, AMEN, AMEN, to pray every day. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME BECAUSE I'M FULLY PERSUADED AND I ENJOY STEAK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The problem is we walk around as Christians with binkies in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to work in the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nursing on your last revival. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nursing on the last time that a minister came through. Nursing that the last time when when when you're to go out and you're to Aren't you represented as the eagle? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you represented to be able to go out and find your own meat and go out and to kill your own prey and to go out and to do these own things instead of having to just wait and wait for your pastor or your or the minister to be able to come up and feed you. This ain't no food line, you know. This ain't something that you just come through. Amen. He the word that he's preaching should be vindicating what you're listening to. &gt;&gt; The word that he's preaching should be something that you know what, I know that that's the truth because I heard the messenger of the hour preach that. I read that in my Bible. So what he's saying is the truth and it ping and it amens you. Amen. But there's no pinging because there's no reading and there's no listening and there's none of that going on. That's why there's no amen going on. Amen. And that's what happens is because we're used to the milk. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We would rather get the world's supplement. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We would rather go out and we would rather get on some app. Yeah. &gt;&gt; We would rather get on some app somewhere and be like, "VOICE OF GOD, SHOW ME WHAT I'm to read today." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I get on my daily Bible app and and Mr. Zuckerberg or whoever it is that writes that thing writes that thing, FEEDS ME MY OWN DAILY SCRIPTURE for today. How about FINDING A SCRIPTURE THAT your family needs? for you today. &gt;&gt; How about GOING OUT AND SAYING, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M BATTLING, AMEN, this demon of depression in my family, and I'm not going to rely on this sap and I'm not going to rely on on this person. I'm not going to rely ON THAT ONE. I'M GOING TO GO TO MY CONCORDANCE, AND I'M GOING TO FIND IT FOR MYSELF, AND I'M GOING TO GO AND I'M GOING TO SAY, "AMEN, I'M A I'M A MATURE SEED." &gt;&gt; AMEN. I AM A MATURE CHRISTIAN AND I'M IN MY PROMISE BECAUSE I'M FILLED WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. I'm resting upon God's word of the hour and I am not waiting for the fight to come to me but I AM GOING TO THE FIGHT. [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You know during this whole entire time you watch you watch as Mo when Moses was come was going through the wilderness and now now you remember that there was a battle that was that was going on and Moses had to go out and he had to and and in in this battle as long as Moses's hands were raised. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The battle was going &gt;&gt; as long as the word was being exalted. as long as the word was being was being was was being waved over the people. Amen. The the the Israel was winning. And all of a sudden, he began to go down. He began to let down the bars and the word began to get tired and he began to come down. And so Joshua sent men up there to prop the word up. And that's what we do. Amen. You prop the word. You I mean, you don't got to prop the word up, but but you know what? You see the word, Amen. beginning to deviate down in your life. You go up there. Amen. And you prop it up. Amen. because it's that that brings you victory. But I also want to point something else out to you underneath Joshua. Joshua was in a battle as well. &gt;&gt; Joshua was in the middle of he was battling the five kings &gt;&gt; and he was right there. It was one of the last battles that he was going to have to go through before Amen. before the the taking of the complete promised land. And time was beginning to transpire and his men were spread out all throughout the field. And he was standing and he was looking at the battlefield AND HE WAS WATCHING all these things beginning to take place. But he knew that if he retired from the war that the enemy which were great and numbered and they had them all split up and strategically divided to where they could conquer the enemy. But he knew that if they would all regroup and that they would have time, amen, that they wouldn't be able to overcome them. Now look, amen. It was a prophet back then that had went out there and it was his hands that were being raised up. It was the word in the prophet his hands being raised up. Amen. That was saying but YET IT WAS JOSHUA. AMEN. He did it. It was the word that laid INSIDE JOSHUA THAT TURNED AND HE SAID, "SON, STAND STILL OVER GIDEON." AMEN. AND IT WAS THE WORD THAT WAS BEING SPOKEN OVER AN INDIVIDUAL. AMEN. It was THEM SPEAKING THE WORD. AMEN. THE SUN STAND STILL THAT I CAN CONQUER over my enemy. And it's you. It's not the prophet no longer speaking the word, BUT IT'S YOU, THE BRIDE OVER YOUR SITUATION SPEAKING THE WORD. You can overcome your enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You can overcome. &gt;&gt; You can come to your mountain. &gt;&gt; Say, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can do these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. They were coming with a divine purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna finish this quote. They were further matured Christians and ready to to eat the strong meat. Now you're ready to come into something. He says you're ready to uh understand something that's deep. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's rich. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh well, we'll get into it directly in a way. It's hidden since the it's been hidden since the foundations of the world. He said, "Now that you've come to this, I'm addressing this to you, not to those that have just left Egypt." &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Not your boarding call. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Those of you that are still in Egypt, still don't know whether God's going to do something for you, &gt;&gt; still don't believe that he's powerful, still hanging, still hinging off of whether God can do this. This this isn't for you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You you your mountain's over there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You just keep spinning around your mountain over there. But there come a generation of people that was like, I am tired of going around the mountain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There come a generation of people that you know what? I'm tired of drugs and alcohol destroying my family. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of depression destroying my family. I'm tired of anxieties. I'm tired of of of family issues. I'm tired of of hereditary problems. I'm tired of health problems. I'm tired of all these things that are coming into my family. Amen. Why do we just stand here? I'm just going to die, Amen. with this problem, with this headache, with this infirmity. I'm going to die with all these things anyway. You know what? GOD, YOU'RE FAITHFUL. GOD, I BELIEVE YOU, GOD. AMEN. I'M taking the fight to them. I'M I'M TIRED OF SITTING THERE. NOW, as they begin to go through this journey now, as they begin to go through this journey and they begin to go through and they've conquered AI. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they conquered Gibden and all the five kings. They'd all come and they all come against him. And they all come against him. And he and he AND HE PUSHED THESE FIVE KINGS BACK INTO BACK into a cave and they rolled a stone over them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he comes back. Now these people, there's a difference when you're not fighting for anything from but when you're fighting for something. Okay. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, your life is worth fighting for. &gt;&gt; Your children, &gt;&gt; your grandchildren are worth fighting for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your presence in this congregation as an elder, as a pillar, as a post, as a sign that somebody can look to and say, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S SOMEBODY THAT'S WEATHERED THE STORM. That's somebody that's possessing their land. THAT'S SOMEBODY GOD IS PLEASED WITH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, as they begin to roll this stone over the over the over the lid of the five kings, Joshua begins to come back and they roll it back over. And we know how the story goes about how Joshua commands the children of Israel to put their heels up against their neck and he begins to cut their heads off one by one. and that that this day forever more that they will never see these kings anymore, nor they'll be tormented, NOR THEY BE NOR THAT NOR THAT THEY would be that they would be in any way, SHAPE OR FORM AND BE INHIBITED BY their presence. &gt;&gt; All right? AND JOSHUA BEGINS TO JOSHUA BEGINS TO come and then he he he the scripture says that he gets old in years and at this point that he possesses THE LAND AND JOSHUA COMES TO THIS PLACE AND HE BEGINS TO DIVIDE OUT THE LAND. NOW, this is something that pretty that that struck me as he begin to divide out the land and he begin to come out. He they begin to come out and he begin to give Nas Manasseh their their land and he begins to give Ephraim their land and he begins to give all these other ones their land and he begin to notice that every if you begin to notice that every TRIBE BEGINS TO FIT the land that they were given. Okay? And if you think and if you look at this, you can go back. You can go back and do there in adoption one. It says each one of them Hebrew mothers. Now think about this. And I thought this tied in beautifully because now Israel's in the promised land. Israel's in their inheritance. They've conquered the land and they've come to this place. And now and now they're coming to this place that God has says it's been yours. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, each one of these Hebrew mothers giving birth to these children, they spoke of the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land. Oh, IT IS GREAT STUDY. IF WE COULD ONLY go into detail, which which could take hours, someday we would get when we get our church fixed. I just like to COME TO TAKE A SOLID MONTH JUST TO SAY IT RIGHT. WATCH WHEN EACH one of these mothers when she called out Ephraim when she was in labor positionally placed him where his feet was sitting in oil just every one of him where they were at. And Joshua not knowing this, but by inspiration led of the Holy Spirit after being led to the promised land, each gave each man his promise, exactly what the Holy Spirit promised them back before birth. &gt;&gt; The children of Israel WERE WALKING INTO SOMETHING THAT GOD HAD ALREADY predestinated them to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when they were walking in the wilderness, the first time that the rock was smoked, when the mana was laid down in heaven, there was there was questions in their mind or if they were able to be able TO POSSESS THE LAND. But before the founder, before Ephraim was born, MANASSES WAS BORN, GOD HAD GIVEN THEIR MOTHERS through inspiration the name of the land and the name of the place that they would go. SO WHEN THEY GO TO THE PROMISED LAND without assurance, without any doubt, THEY COULD REALIZE THAT GOD HAD GIVEN THEM THIS LAND of promise. &gt;&gt; You're talking about being able to walk in and say, you know what, this is mine. &gt;&gt; Hey, this is mine. Hey, I don't know. I don't know what you say, but before I was even born and my mother had given me of this birth. Amen. And God, this is where mindbomb emoji comes. [snorts] Listen to this Pentecostal. Listen or listen to this. Not Pentecostal. Listen to this. Predestination looks back to fornowledge. I mean election. He says election looks back to fornowledge. and predestined looks to destiny. Don't forget that election looks back here. Here it is. I was a conqueror. I was born in sin shapen in iniquity. Come into this world speaking ly born among sither s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sinners, fathers and mothers and all my who or whole family sinners. I was a cocker bird, but all of a sudden I became a a wheat grain. How did it happen? What was that? Election. election. God before the foundation of the world elected the cocker was was to become A GRAIN OF WHEAT. NOW I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved. How did I do it? I looked back and see that he predestinated it A LONG TIME BY FORNOWLEDGE. He seen that I would love him. So he made a perpetuation through his son that through him I might become a cocker to a grain of wheat. Now, where am I at now? I'm saved. I'M WALKING THROUGH GRACE. WHAT DOES predestination look? It looks to destiny. What are the Where will he take me to? And where I'm going? Amen. That's got you. That's where you are. Now, let's now let's just a little further. Then we'll have to close pretty soon. According. He's reading a scripture. According according. We're talking about God predestinating us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; THIS WAS ALL TYPED OUT THROUGH ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; YOU JUST THOUGHT that you were reading just Moses and a little being stuck in the bull rush and you just THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE JUST READING THE LITTLE RED SEA and you just thought that you were just YOU WERE JUST READING JERICHO. BUT YET GOD WAS MAPPING OUT THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION, AMEN, TO HIS PEOPLE. GOD WAS MAPPING OUT, AMEN, THIS PLAN. AND IN JUST AS I had PREDESTINATED ISRAEL TO GO into a land of promise that I had I had given to THEM BY NAME BEFORE that they had even got there that their attributes that their characteristic is proof. Amen. That you come into this land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost AND THAT YOU'VE RESTED FULLY. &gt;&gt; Rested fully. YOU CAN WALK INTO your situation. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN WALK RIGHT IN AND YOU NO MATTER WHAT THE doctor says, you can walk right INTO THERE. AMEN. THE DOCTOR IS infringing on your promise. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Infringing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's squatting. Yeah. Back in the world, you had no inheritance. You were you were squatting on the devil's land. You were a child of God squatting on the devil's land out there in the wilderness. Amen. But underneath this rest, &gt;&gt; underneath this seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, amen, that you've come underneath a full rest has been granted, amen, to you. And now you're walking out into your promised land. Amen. You don't have to no longer you don't have to no longer wonder, oh, I'm going to possess this, but I can't keep it. No, you can possess the land of your children because that's your inheritance. And if you have enough faith, amen, to believe for your own salvation, then you should be able to believe the salvation for YOUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO COME. And you can't. Does it matter what Jericho? Doesn't matter what AI doesn't matter, Amen. any of the monsters or any of the armies, amen, that have COME AGAINST YOU. GOD [screaming] HAS BEEN THE ONE THAT SAID THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU THE LAND. IT'S NOT up to you. It's not up to YOU TO SURRENDER. GOD GAVE YOU THE LAND. NOW YOU GO AND POSSESS IT. AMEN. BECAUSE YOU'RE BONE OF HIS BLOW AND YOUR FLESH OF HIS FLESH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; As our musicians come, &gt;&gt; it says, "According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation &gt;&gt; of the world." &gt;&gt; See the parallel there? &gt;&gt; You see what's going on? &gt;&gt; I I did this before. That was all around. I'm the originator of that. They stole They stole that from me. &gt;&gt; According chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy without him without blame before him in love. You see the parallel there? You see where God brought Israel into a land that was already theirs and God has already given you the victory before the foundation of the world. He had already seen you sealed. He had already seen you positionally placed in YOUR LAND OF PROMISE FOR TODAY. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now it's up to you to believe this ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it's up to you to believe this Joshua ministry. You think the burden is just off of is off of you because Israel tanked it. &gt;&gt; No. Now it's on you. &gt;&gt; God's like, I've done all these things. I've raised a young man. I've raised a young boy back from the dead in Finland. I've healed countless person. John Ryan, I healed him of his blindness. I brought different ones in your congregation out of sickness, from a hyper thyroid. I brought I brought I brought different ones from cancer. I brought different ONES FROM THIS. NOW THAT YOU SEE THAT I AM REAL NOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT I AM REAL, will you believe to possess your promise? Will you believe to possess your children? WILL YOU BELIEVE TO POSSESS over the the health issue that you might be going through in your life &gt;&gt; or will you fail at Kanesh Barnea? We're not talking about a people that are beyond the that are on the other side of Jordan. We're not talking about a people that are just laying in justification and in sanctification. We're talking about a people that have already crossed over and are coming to a place that they they're realizing who they are and they're realizing that you know what I have a purpose in life and that's to exhibit a living God just as Israel did. Look at him. Look at every time that Israel went and did and went and did something. He says that so my glory would be made known. All right. All right. &gt;&gt; So that all the world will know that I am God. You think that God's exhibiting himself through you for your glorification? No. But he's chosen a willing vessel for today. If it's willing, if that vessel's willing &gt;&gt; to possess the land. Are you willing to possess the land? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, we've heard this message long enough. And I ain't sitting here and saying that I've reached too [music] far. That's way I can I can preach this. But we've we've lived in this message long [music] enough. We've we we we we've come to a place where God's expecting you to possess. God's put that desire in your heart for a loved one. God's put that desire in your heart that you can overcome the infirmity in your body. God put this desire in your heart, amen, for for your financial need or for a brother or for a sister. He put those things in your heart because he knows that you can overcome him and that you're the only hands he's going to be able to use. &gt;&gt; Surely he can come down in the [music] spirit. Surely he can come down in manifestations. Surely he could come down by AN ANGEL. BUT WHY WOULD HE DO THAT WHEN HE COULD USE YOU? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; If you don't, the rock's will &gt;&gt; and you've been given a message to possess the land that you live in. You've been given a message. Amen. Just as just as just as God was with brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just as God was with with these other men that we that that have went on before us. The same God that was with them stands right here, right now. Then it will stand with every son and daughter of God that be willing. But they've got to be willing. They got to be ABLE TO SAY, "LORD, I NEED TO HEAR YOUR WORD OR I'LL DIE. GOD, I NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME INTO YOUR PRESENCE IN YOUR HOUSE TO BE IN FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR BELIEVERS OR OR I WILL CEASE TO LIVE. LORD, I NEED YOUR WORD." AMEN. What are we singing? Kobe. &gt;&gt; I surrender my life. I give it all to you. Are you ready to &gt;&gt; feel God's real [music] power? &gt;&gt; I know, Lord. [singing] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to feel God's &gt;&gt; real strength and see the God's real vision for your life? This message has been telling you year after [music] year after year after year. But God's been waiting for you to possess it. He's been waiting on you to put off that doubt. The only time that they sustained any loss inside the promised land was when sin was in [music] the camp and Achen had to pay for his sin. We are living under a new covenant. We are living in a new land. We are living in a place where God's word is real. [music] But it's up to the people to possess it. Are you Are you Are you ready to eat of the strong [music] meat? Are you ready to come into the to to to to God's word for real? I mean, are you are you tired of just dancing around the message? Are you just tired of saying, "Oh, I believe in a prophet and you don't even know what the prophet says." Are you tired of just saying being affiliated with the message, but the message not being affiliated with you? Are you ready to handle the power that that your prophet talked about that should dwell in everyone inside of every one of the believers? Are you just going to stand on the outside of Jordan and watch all of it happen? There's a Caleb and a Joshua somewhere in this congregation here tonight. There's a Caleb and there's a Joshua. There's there's a there's a couple of you, Amen, that are made of another spirit. There's some, you know, I'm just going to put it out there. I mean, there's a couple of you, amen, that are here tonight that are made of a different spirit. And it's been calling out and it's been calling, Amen, for the for the realization of this message. Amen. And let me tell you something. If you've been calling out to the realization of this message, amen, there's a there's a fire that a prophet or that your pastor talked about this morning. Amen. That'll come and it'll come down and it'll light you. Amen. It'll set your heart on fire. It'll burn out all the drops. It'll it'll beat you until that until that gold covers you to the point where the master sees his reflection in you. Amen. But you got to be able to say that I'm more than able to take the mountain. No matter what the situation is looking like IN YOUR LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOUR kids are going way. It doesn't matter if you're going down in health. It doesn't matter. Amen. Amen. That if you feel that you're at the bottom of your SPIRITUAL WALK, AMEN, GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THE ABILITY, AMEN, to possess your mountain. Amen. You're not of this denominational system. Amen. You're not, Amen. You're not the FOOLISH VIRGIN. AMEN. YOU'RE NOT NOT GOING TO I MEAN YOU'RE NOT going to miss THE RAPTURE. AMEN. GOD HAS ordained you to possess the land and it's time for you to do so. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to do so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] [music] &gt;&gt; It's time for you to do something. I say it's time to shine the armor up. &gt;&gt; I say it's it's time it's time to get out the old sword. Like we were talking about David back [music] in the old day where he where he pulled out the old sword of Goliath and it took him back to the time what it was doing is that new generation they were reminiscing on all the times that God had been faithful. This generation is without [music] excuse. Every one of us are without excuse, me included. Everyone to the youngest all the way to the oldest in this cong. I can't speak for everybody out there in TV land. Amen. But I can expect all for all those that are inside this church that are right here. We have seen the miracles. We have watched God overcome. Amen. We have seen healing. We have seen Amen. I am a direct product of prayer. Amen. Where I've seen, Amen. men and women get together and pray &gt;&gt; the decision from a judge. &gt;&gt; I am direct product of that generation. I am direct product of that and I refuse to let my children die IN THE WILDERNESS NOT KNOWING THE SAME GOD THAT I DID, NOT KNOWING THE same God. LET THEM SEE THAT I POSSESS. LET THEM SEE THAT YOU POSSESS. LET THEM SEE THAT YOU CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN. LET THEM SEE THAT THIS MESSAGE isn't just laying in MP3s. That this message isn't just laying in books. AMEN. BUT IT'S A MESSAGE THAT IS CONQUERING, OVERCOMING THE MAN THAT I AM, that I can exhibit him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Every time Israel destroyed them, they were like, the enemies of Israel were like Israel and their God. &gt;&gt; And God, &gt;&gt; let me be this. Let me be this individual. Let me be the man. If it's just me, if it's just them, Lord, let us [music] gain courage that you'll be with them. &gt;&gt; Kobe, go ahead. M [singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; I [singing] surrender my life.

You know, if you're not careful, &gt;&gt; if you're not careful, &gt;&gt; we'll try to possess land that's not ours. [music] And sometimes we get stuck in a rut of trying to possess hatred [music] or we get stuck in a rut and we try and we and we tr and we try to we try to possess ill feelings [music] or or or or depression or we you or we try to possess those things of the world and God hasn't asked you to possess those things. God's desire for is for not to you to stay [music] in a place of neg negativity. That's not your land. Hatred isn't your land. Yelling [music] and shouting and and and and and carousing and doing all these [music] things of the world, that's not your land. That's why that's why he told Moses, "Leave those things alone. That's not your land to possess." &gt;&gt; Yeah. [music] So tonight, stop trying to possess those things and claim the things that are yours. [music] Claim the possession that is yours. And if you can do so good at fighting for the things that are not yours, think about the things that are yours that God can't possess. Claim those things in the name [music] of Jesus. You read the word of God and God says that you could have it. Possess it. This here is [music] your land. and anything else that's as contrary as squatting on that lamp.

But I'm here to tell you, [music] I mean, you know, I there Joshua 5, I I was I [music] was looking um you know, at at the scripture that um that brother Brandham quoted on the new corn, the new corn, and you know, the it says [music] when they when they came over, you know, Joshua 5 is talking about the you know, that that [music] they just wanted they just said, "All right, you know, we're just going to let the we're just going to let those older ones just have church. Let them come. Let them do their thing. Let them go through their rel. They're They're just [music] going to let them die off. All right. They're just going to go. They're just playing anyways. Let them die off. But then when that next generation came up, they're in Joshua 5. They did not [music] They weren't circumcised. And so it they required them to be circumcised. Circumcision represents, you know, the Holy Ghost. [music] The new land represents that that promised land, Holy Ghost word living in us, right? And after they had sanctified [music] their hearts, they were over in the new land, they were they they were uh they they all were circumcised. And the Bible says that they begin to eat um you know it it it says [music] there in in Joshua 5 and and um well it's not giving [music] me the the the verse there but it says they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised by them by the way. And it came [music] to pass uh they had done circumcised all the people they abode in their places till they were whole. And the Lord said unto Joshua, Joshua, this day have I rode away the reproach of Egypt from off you. [music] Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal, unto this day, and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month, at even in the plain of Jericho. And [music] they did eat of the corn of the land on the marorrow after the Passover, unleavened [music] cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day. And the mana ceased on the marorrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land. And neither had the children [music] of Israel mana anymore, but they did eat the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. They they they they had to they had to cross Jordan. They had to surrender and die to their stinking natures. [music] They had to do that in order to come over to that promised land. God circumcised their hearts and the Bible [music] says that all the reproach was all born away. Well, praise the Lord. How many wants to be an example of [music] faith? I want to be an example of faith. I want to be an example of faith. [music] Hallelujah. And and so he you know the the the the [music] uh uh when brother Brandon would talk about the children of Israel going he says he said all it was was murmuring complaining and and [music] it was just it was just a constant uh it was just a feuding a feuding among them just just every little bit. Moses was constantly having to having to fix things just constantly. It was just, he says, but when they came over into the other land, there's no more feuding. They were in their land. They were possessing their promises. They were taking Amen. And and and I I just I just decided I want to be that kind of a person. I want to possess my land. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Did you enjoy that message tonight? &gt;&gt; Yes. [applause and music] Hallelujah. Now remember Moses represented the law. Joshua represented grace. The law Moses under the law under under that it was it [music] was it was just just just constant uh uh uh you know just constantly having to get them to to believe God. constantly having to they were just constantly discouraged just constantly. But when they got over to Joshua, I love the way you brought that out. It wasn't someone having to hold Moses hands up. [music] Now it was a Joshua leading the crew saying charge. Amen. Why? They [music] didn't belong. It was the permissive will of God in the wilderness. It's [music] the perfect will of God in the land. And when you're in this pro, what what what land is it? It's this. The Holy Spirit has [music] opened up the book to you. &gt;&gt; Now we can possess it, brother. Charge. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Charge. Go forward in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I just Man, I just love it tonight. Amen. There's no possessing in the wilderness. Possessing. when we get through with all of our little pet peeves and all of this that [music] and the other and just come to God's word and look in the mirror and say, "I'm going to possess everything God said I can have." Well, can I hear an amen? So, [music] so we want to do that. We want we want to I started out saying us elders, we want to, [music] you know, um uh us elders want to be that kind of an example. We want to be that example. And actually, I was talking to somebody about that today. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We want to be an example. Amen. Uh [music] be an example. Hallelujah. And uh and if we'll do that, God will bless and [music] he'll bless that next generation. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, there's there's there's there's too many. We got we, you know, we just we, you know, setting setting [music] the message for you and we're just going to we're just going to keep all the old family tradition [music] that that bound daddy that's bound to you and you going to let it bind your sons and and and if he's got your attitude, he's going to bind he'll he'll let it bind his sons. Well, you know, somebody's got to stand up and say enough's enough. And my family has suffered enough because of me. And I I and and and [laughter] my church has suffered enough because of [music] me. And the young people have suffered enough because of me. I'm going to stand up and I'm going to be accounted for among the faithful believers. I'm going to believe what God has promised. Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you young ones that's got young people in your in your in your uh [music] uh families now, your young children, you mark my words. Amen. There are there are curses that are being passed down through your [music] genetics. And somebody's got to stand up against the tide and show them that somebody can overcome. Yeah. Well, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. [applause] you know, depression and and and bitterness was something in my family [music] and u I seen it I seen it in grandpa. I've seen it in my my dad's, you know, my dad's family and and uh [music] but dad told me when I was a kid, he told me, he said, "Now, you're going to fight it because well, [music] you're a Martin. You're going to fight bitterness." And uh but he's going to say, "By God's grace," he said, "Wendall, I have [music] I have put I have stood right there and stood guard." And it would be easy for me to get bitty. Really easy. It's in my genetics. [music] He said, "But I'm telling you, by God's grace, he has helped me. And if I can, [music] by his grace, I'm going to I I I'm going to I'm going to die a man that [music] is not like uh my father." And he loved his father, and I loved my grandfather, but he says he died a bitter man. And he said, "Wendo, you're going to have to make up your mind." I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I appreciate dad for taking me and saying, "Hey, there's some things in our family that wasn't quite that wasn't quite right." And and [music] and I want you to I want you to put the Holy Ghost on that. Put the Holy Ghost on that so that you can overcome. Amen. Well, and I'm Aren't you glad that my dad is not a bitter old man that's all hateful and today he's a kind man, loving man. He's He's just He sees good in everybody. Well, I'm glad for that. I I'm glad for that. Amen. Now it's my turn. Amen. I'm still of the genetics, but the Holy Ghost is in me that is going to help me to overcome it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I you know, when I heard what what got me going on that is when brother Michael said, "Hey, uh you know, all of those 20 years and over will not make the promise." [music] And I go, "Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch." I don't guess I'd ever read that. [music] and uh uh or I forgot about it or something and I thought, man, man, some grandpa had influenced a daddy and some daddy [music] had influenced a 20 year old and they had a bad attitude at that promised land and God says, "You ain't going [music] in neither." Ay. So, it's really [music] serious. &gt;&gt; It is serious. So anyways, uh, had to add my two [music] cents to your message. Amen. Praise the Lord. So I'm I'm I'm glad for that. But I will tell you I I will tell you that another good another good quote in the promised land. Brother Brandham says the new birth breeds [music] out the call. The new birth, he's he's talking about your nature. He says, [music] and and your genetics. He's talking about genetics, but he says the new birth breeds out the call. What what that's what that [music] means is, Amen. the Holy Ghost can come in and take over things in our lives. Amen. We can come over in our [music] promised land and possess our land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someone shout hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; So, I'm thankful for it. I I'm thankful for it. I I I and and really I think [music] the message went right along with mine this morning. Amen. Humanity and deity. God has come over. Somebody's got to look at themselves this year in a different light. I am an overcomer. That word is mine. And by George, I'm taking my mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm coming over on this other side. I ain't going to question it. I'm going to believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go forward." [music] Amen. God bless you. And um we we certainly appreciate the word of the Lord. [music] Amen. It it done something in my heart. We um we we want you to uh continue to pray for for brother Donald. He is &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um he is at the uh he he was at the he was at the ER earlier [music] and uh it looks like they're going to keep him and &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh I I really encouraged him to to go and I don't know [music] maybe I shouldn't do this but I don't know if y'all can see that, but this is what brother this is [music] what he's dealing with on his foot.
