it's good to be in the house of God I uh told Brother window he should be finishing up his sermon I that's hard to come behind somebody that preaches like that I just it's been masterpieces after masterpieces when we get to know who we are and what God has done for us the devil doesn't have a chance in your life you know I was talking some Elders here and uh they're all concerned that we're so consumed in just reading quotes and not reading our Bibles to make sure not just be not to say well we want to make sure brother Brown is preaching it but a lot of times then their minds are thinking a lot of the trouble of the doctrines that's coming out there is they're not lining up with the word of the Bible and the message together and they're coming out making their own Doctrine and it's contrary to God's word we know that the message of the hour is Malachi 4. it told us in Malachi 4 exactly what Malachi 4 was supposed to do for us we can go into Revelations and it'll tell us exactly what that Malachi 4 was supposed to do we can go into Luke 17 30. we know these things but I want to tell on myself the other Wednesday night when brother window was asking us all to have our Bibles I didn't have my Bible and when brother Colby gave me his Bible it was a book and I couldn't find scriptures to save my neck and I said oh God first book they gave me I couldn't see because the letters were so small I don't even think I could have solid microphone glass then he gave me his precious little bible with bigger words but it was just like this Bible that was given to me over the weekend it didn't have these little things over here that I can find it real fast and I thought oh God I feel so bad so I went home and repented and so but it's good to be in the house of God and and we just love you and we just sure do appreciate each and every one of you and I am sorry that you have to listen to me instead of Pastor this evening but if we can open our Bibles this evening I got three scriptures or three different places to go and not going to hold you up too long but Romans 9 and we can turn me way down I I don't care if I hear myself one of these days I'll get used to that but I haven't got used to it for 52 and a half years so uh that's why I don't talk to myself so Romans 9 and 23 and 24. he says and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessel of Mercy which he had for prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of a Jew only but also of the Gentile Gentiles let's go to John 12. and let's start at the 24th verse John 12 24. verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but if it dies it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life amen let's go to John 5. John 5 and let's just read 1 24th verse verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come unto condemnation but his past from Death unto life amen let's just bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just love you father God and Lord the last couple of weeks Lord just kind of going over these messages of what brother Wendell has been preaching and the things that I have been studying on Lord and just been overwhelming Lord been a Christian Lord for 32 and a half years Lord and and you still amaze me Lord of your word thinking that I know something and then find out I didn't know it all and still learning it's amazing Lord I just ask you Lord to help me to get away and let you come and speak to your children Lord I pray only say what you want me to say Lord help me Father God Lord we just love you we thank you for your mercies and Grace those that couldn't make it Lord I pray that you help them Father God whatever they're doing Lord knowing that Brianna and now Robert is not feeling well Lord the devil's out roaring as a lion and we just ask you Lord God to be with them and those that are not feeling well father God and Lord those that couldn't make it because they had to go here there we just ask you father God to be with them we just love you we thank you for your mercies and Grace in Jesus name we pray amen God has a provided way oh you may be seated there's a little germ of Life lying there somewhere just as sure as the sun rise Yonder in the East and begins to shine warm upon the ground it lives again why God provided a way for for to it live again for it to live again if God if God made a way for the flowers to live again what about a man that's made in His image how God has made a way for us to live again my little thought than it is little it's not a big open up book of thousands of words like it usually is but the Bible lives again I was reading a message and brother random was talking about when he was over in India there was a man that was at the at the uh he got off on the airplane and there he was and he rose to his motel and there was hundreds and thousands of people there and they were going to a bunch of ministers were there and and they were getting ready and this one come up to brother Branham and told Brother Branham he says he says we have seen this and we've seen that but God has come with you and he says we are thirsting we're hungry for the word of God and we see in your gift the Bible lives again that caught my attention the Bible lives again and I I thought and it has been since the first or second time I ministered here I preached on if you remember some of you remember preaching on preparing the ground now since I've been here almost 10 years I see the way that the farmers here is I see the way the weather is here it's different than it is in New Mexico here your phrase line is about six to seven inches you can put a water line at eight inches nine inches in the ground and it'll never freeze here unless it gets below you know 20 to 30 below zero then it freezes but in New Mexico it has to be below two feet if it doesn't get below two feet it will freeze and you have to dig it up because in New Mexico even if the ground is dry after a foot it gets solid hard Frozen it it has a little bit of moisture there it will actually turn into ice and so as I was telling ones last time I ministered this that when we go in there and we get the ground prepared and ready for corn or for wheat we got to go below the two the two foot mark and what it is this machine goes down and it digs it up and as it digs it up it curls it and brings everything that's on the very top and puts it on the bottom so that in the winter time it freezes it it kills all the seed that was laying on top of that ground into the ground now so it would freeze it it would kill it totally dead that would not come back up and so then it when spring starts coming right before spring you get back out there and you have plow you plow it up and you get it get it to where you can have it where you be able to and the farmers out there a lot of them Farmers out there the big ranchers and things like that their Farmers also so what it is is you got one brother's the Rancher the other one's the farmer and so what they end up doing is the Rancher has this big old feedlot and he takes his little tractor out there little John Deere tractor and he pushes cow manure into big old piles and his brother brothers in there going oh this is going to fertilize my ground and he goes and he picks it up and he puts it on his on the ground that he just trying to prepare to put corn in there or weed in there or maybe he's changing a ground from from seven years of alfalfa now they're taking it from there because after so many years their soil has to have something else to build that soil up so that it would be perfect to grow in and so now they have all kinds of stuff today that they don't have to wait like they did in years before that they would have to leave that ground alone for a year or so that the nature that mother nature take care of it and then bring it through but now they've got all kinds of ways today that they can just keep on and keep on because they're putting stuff in it well in this cow manure it has all the vitamins that you they need to grow any kind of wheat any kind of corn or any kind of alfalfa or grass and so they go in there and they spread that out there but the old farmer is a farmer he has to use what he's got but he's not realizing that that same cow that did that that stuff in the catalog ate all those weeds all winter long and all those weeds had seeds in them and all that grass and all these things and when they go and they drop their droppings he's spreading out all those seeds on his ground his fertile ground I cut a lot of corn for silage man you would see corn 12 feet high in New Mexico corn corn that long juicy when I was a little boy but underneath about this high was tumbleweeds as far as you can see in underneath those that crop because a mother nature blows them in there those cows provided a whole bunch of them but brothers and sisters just imagine some of you right now got a little garden out here and if you're not out there daily you've got a bunch of weeds popping up in grass growing and if you let those things take over it will kill your plant it will suck all the moisture out of it that's why you see all these Cowboys cutting all these oh not oak trees but all these cedar trees out they're saying that one tree one tree a day drinks like hundreds and hundreds of gallons of water a day yeah and you wonder why in my front yard on the side yard around that tree that my wife thinks is so beautiful when she looks out that window washing dishes that I have to hit my head on because I gotta get way down here and it's pretty hard for this boy to bend over and get hit by that big old 48 inch mower I got that pulls me around like a like anything she loves it but underneath it there's no grass growing one little twig of this and that's there that's it everything else is dead because it's sucking all that water out of the ground so a real farmer or a real Rancher gets rid of them kinds of things even they look pretty they get rid of it there's a lot of beautiful weeds out there as beautiful flowers if you don't believe you come to my house I got a bunch of yellow little yellow flowers all over my yard they're beautiful but they'll take over your yard and so you have to make sure you get into your yard and take care of your yard but one thing about this that I saw here with this you got to put that that seed in the ground in Fertile ground and it has to die as brother Wendell is saying it very very good the other night it has to die but it can only just die but it has to rot prophet of God said back in the 50s they couldn't figure they couldn't open that thing up stick it in the ground in the water it for about a week or so and then pull that thing up and find life there they can't find it but there's life in that seed when it is sitting there on your table and you're getting ready to plant it there's a life in there that's dormant it will produce if it's in the right kind of ground it will produce that's why in the mind of God he created now you can go in the scriptures and see the first chapter and second chapter Genesis it was made by the hands of God by spoken words speaking it he created heavens and earth he created life he created the animals he created the animals for the sea he created the sea he created everything he put seeds in the ground he was a a master farmer of building this this world for you and I this Eden that we're supposed to be going back to that Eden That was supposed to be perfect was perfect Adam walked and breathed in perfection he lived and breathed as a Son of God he was able to say tree I want you to move from here and move over here I don't want you lying here I want you in the other Kingdom over here they would listen to him he was a me a a small man but he had power of God living in him he had Heaven and Earth wrapped around him he was able to be a god upon the Earth and those two chapters was perfect in chapter three that's when sin come along that Beast that was standing there was in the first two chapters and God said it was good but he created that Beast for a purpose and Satan took that beast and perverted something that was good so that God could be a redeemer God used that vessel for a purpose as just as brother Wendell said that he used Pharaoh for his purpose to show his power that was the only way that Satan was able to come in the race of a human race brother random made it very clear that that that Beast was some kind of like an ape but he was more like a man but he was able to transfer back and forth with a woman and that's why we had these two seeds this we have today because of one vessel was able to be used and God planted seeds Satan planted seeds and they came up he planted more seeds he planted more seeds they came up and they harvest he planted these seeds and he planted seeds and they kept coming up and came up before long those two started mingling together made Giants in the world made all kinds of sin and Corruption I believe Seth was a man of God I believe he knew who he was he knew who his father was and he knew who his God was and I believe he stood on the Promises of God that what his daddy taught him sitting there lit to ear by the fire every evening what God did for them in the Garden of Eden I believe he was taught right I believe that he was living right but his grandchildren and grandchildren and grandchildren started mingling Sciences has taken corn today and you can't you cannot find real corn you can't go in there and take that corn that you buy today and you plant it and harvest it and say I'm going to keep this bag and I'm going to replant it it cannot produce nothing it's dead only thing you can produce is cornmeal that's it because there's no life in it that's why Church of God that them two seeds you can look at man here and you can look a man here you don't see nothing different they're both men but one has the Seed of Abraham and the other one has the seed of Satan is because they started mingling and when they started meedling with each other caused more damage to the mind because now they have the mind of Cain and they have a mind of be religious but then you have the seed of God in a person that stays away from the sins of the world because their father is of the Heavenly Realm there's a difference this mind only works is it what gets fed right here this mind can deceive you just like it did Eve but we have to make sure that you and I are living and breathing Bible because if we're reading our Bible every day we're listening to tapes not only have a quote against the devil now you'll have scripture against the devil right you have to take both of them and eat the book and when you eat the book you gotta digest it you've got to place it down into your heart and let your heart use that for strength the reason why we let the devil come in and fight us and fight us and beat us and everything else is because brother William is not in the book but when I'm in the book my wife is a lot happier I'm not a grump I'm doing other things that I should be doing I have more faith and all things are a little bit different through my trials I'm not sitting there going oh me brother Joe no I'm saying all right devil you're fighting me must be good something's good coming up and I fight you and I fight feel like I'm going to go under but my nose is still up above the water and then one shiny day there's a God that comes down and says no more Satan here he comes and he pulls me out of that water and I cut that devil's head off why because I'm Son of God he lets me learn how to swim he teaches me how to fight he teaches me how to talk he teaches me how to love because God cultivated his thoughts when he spoke him into existence and he planted the Earth for an Eden for his children because he loved him he wanted them to have something special to live on and to grow on and to be just like his dad their daddy a god a miniature God to the Earth amen amen God is good church when we can recognize what our brother's been preaching on and not only have it in had knowledge but go home and get into the scriptures and find out for 20 years I've been trying to find this one quote that I can find and say okay I got it I've Heard lots of people say that the tree of life and the tree of Good Good and Evil one was Jesus and one was Satan for some reason I was Satan I could never find it for some reason but today the day this afternoon before I showed up God showed it to me for 20 years I had I knew Christ was way back then too but Jesus came through a birth but something inside of me just believed that that was something more there I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God but I believe a God that was inside of him was God Almighty when he was standing there said peace be still Lazarus come forth I believe there was something in that body there was more than just the Sun I believe that God spoke through him all the healing come from God the Bible says in the Old Testament all the healings come from God amen you and I can lay hands on the sick but who heals them God but God takes your faith and he goes on action with it Hallelujah that's why a man can stand up here and people can be walking by and not say a word and just lay hands because he already knows that God's going to heal him and God recognizes that faith for that person and now when that person comes through maybe has diabetes and walks through there healed why because it's the word God planted it in the Garden of Eden it was there for us as long as we're living on that life of God taken into his word he took care of them Hallelujah Matthew 13 37. he answered and said unto them he that soweth good seed is the son of man the field is the world though good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that stowed them is the devil the hardest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels we just heard that the other night didn't we but I wanted to take something God gave this to me right here this this one these scriptures that was God putting his seeds in there from his mind and then Here Comes Satan throwing his seats out there and brother ham says this he says and the gospel isn't word only through Power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit which was produced the signs of Mark 16 when he said go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them the word isn't it's the word itself is dead until it becomes into an action and produces life oh saints of God we've got a lot of people walking dead in the in our churches they don't know nothing they're sitting there relying on Pastor window to tell him everything and then another person comes by and maybe says something just a little different but but brother Wendell said this but he says the Bible says this and they get confused or because they just gone off their mind and their mind is telling them well you know it's all right as he was saying this morning it's all right to drink a little and it's all right to smoke a little it's not brother Brown made it very clear that those things are just attributes of unbelief if you believe you wouldn't do those things I wouldn't do those things if I believe we've got to stick with what the word of God has brought us to do we've got to cultivate our hearts we've got to we've got to clean it out every day as we're growing Christians we've got to go out there I guarantee you brother Merle's out there and he's pulling weeds and I guarantee he starts about to this corner before he gets out there and he's probably pulling weeds on the way out there my wife gets out of the car as soon as she looks down I mean this happened to us the other day and I couldn't believe it she got out of the car a screw about that big we go in we can we get we get out our grass we go to the store she gets out she picks up a nail she just she's a magnet brother Merle is a weed killer he's always pulling weeds I go around the corner to go to my house he's at he's at the neighbor's house pulling weeds we've got to take care of what we've got we've got to cultivate you can't just pull a weed they got them little teeny machine a little uh little uh thing it goes like this and when you roll it it teals the ground up do you know what that does it tills the ground up so when you water it the water goes in and separates into your to your root system and it gets the water down there faster it makes mixtures all the water gets there we want the word all to come into our hearts so if we can cultivate this ground and get it softened up so when the word starts coming what is it going to do when the water of the word comes it's going to soak down into that seed and that seed that was predestinated before the foundations of the world it's going to produce exactly the word but brother Brian brother window brother Brandon myself cannot cultivate your mind we can throw thoughts out there we can give you word out there but you've got to take that word and you've got to apply it to your life and you've got to cultivate it so that it goes down into the side of your body and you say I am a Christian not because somebody says it because you have an experience of the Holy Spirit that's drawing you closer to him Hallelujah praise be to God except a corn of wheat Falls in that ground it abides alone and when the word is brought into a heart of faith that makes that very promise in the Bible living again see it's got to live it's germanized word oh I like that germanized word and it must live if it's received in the right place under the right condition every seed will live again if it's put under the right condition you want to be greater Christians you want to have signs and wonders following you and I'm not talking about preachers I'm talking about you individuals cultivate cultivate get all them weeds out of your head get all the unbelief out so the only thing that's in your mind you turn that Battlefield in a big old field so you can grow and grow in the presence of God you just work it and you work it every day how do you do that brother William this right here I don't have a message book so use this as Miss book and the message that's the tools that you need to farm your ground you don't need nothing else just the word of what the prophet of God said and this book right here if you can't see it go get you some bigger letters Hallelujah but see the Bible says heavy if you have a heavy laden the heavy laden come unto me and I'll give you rest do you know what that rest is knowing who you are it's not sitting on your couch thinking oh thank you Lord I ain't out there working because I'm sorry I won't be that way because I got a wife she goes out there and she starts working face turns red and I said oh God have mercy I want to work harder there than I am on my job side but you know what she's my help man we got a little piece of property that God gave me and because he gave it to me I'm taking care of it from the outside all the way on the inside you get into my house my wife has lots of pretty things but she takes care of it she wipes it down you go to sister two peas in the pod Sister Amy go to her house she'll walk by something and go while she's fellowshipping my wife does the same thing I seen sister Fresca do the same thing oh brother Wayne please the forgive us we've just been running with our head cut off and she's sitting here picking up her pillows and popping them up and the plastic sis don't worry I couldn't visit you don't worry about it what is it she's taking care of business you and I got taken care of business right here if we could take care of this guess what I'll have more left for you when you have faults I won't even look at them because I love you I love you oh I want to love you and The Only Way I Know I Can Love You is get the love of Jesus in me and the only way I can get to Jesus loving me and living in me I've got to cultivate this guy I got to keep it up I got to keep all the doubts out I got to keep out all the sin out because why I'm going home I'm going home Hallelujah look it comes to a place friend when the word world is so awful it's going to make you prove every inch of ground you stand on Satan's going to do it and it's coming to a time where impersonators and Cardinal thinking is going to be circling from the real true Body of Christ oh my oh my God that's why it's so important to stick with the word because if you're not sticking with the word any kind of winds of Doctrine comes you're going to follow it oh he said brother Brandon what brother Amber must said it but if you're reading the word and you're in the book your antennas will go up and say oh wait a minute prophet of God said this brother William I'm sorry brother William I can't believe the two Soul Doctrine sorry brother William I don't believe it I don't believe in those things because it doesn't line up with scripture it wasn't my fault when I was born in sin speaking lies but it is my fault if I stay in that condition I came to this world I didn't ask to come to this world but I came and now I have a decision that I have to make am I going to serve the Living God or am I going to live in this flesh and if I live in this flesh I'm going to die and rot and go to a hot house or I can serve a God here and sacrifice the things of the world and go to a Heavenly place called Eden and that Eden is a peace and a love when my God will come down in the evening time and fellowship with me and see me in love means watch and I can see the animals why do the animals that I would love just to touch I will be able to touch them and I won't have a heart attack when my wife walks up to a moose 20 feet and wants to take pictures hmm but I want that love I want the power of God living in me I want the signs and wonders to follow me not because I'm a preacher I want to be able to let people see that's a man of God he's not a hypocrite oh he doesn't smile very much but you get around him a little while he starts getting goofy and he's a Paul a big ball of fun but I don't want somebody to look at me and say that's a hypocrite he says that he's a Christian he's up there preaching the gospel and he's living in sin he's doing this he's doing that I don't want that behind me I want my my body cultivated so that God can come and water that I can have overcoming power of this flesh myself because my worst enemy is this right here These Eyes cause me in lots of problems this tongue causes lots of problems but if I can keep my eyes and keep my tongue in the word of God I will use my tongue of praising him I'll use my eyes to see the word of God that I can put down into my heart that I can be an overcomer of the things of the world Hallelujah I want to be a a moving Bible brother I want the Bible to live in me again Hallelujah I was dead one day but now I was found by Jesus and that Jesus changed my life Hallelujah and the Bible is living again Hallelujah praise be to God what is it but Joe a Bible living again right there why you charge your family you shut everything away he says I I don't know who I am I don't know what I'm going to do but I've got to be in that church right there in Pawnee God made a way he gave me a home gave you a place to come people bring you to church you're hearing the word what is it it's Grace is God loving you giving you the opportunity to cultivate that mind of yours that he can come down and suck with you in the evening time and give you what you need of Hallelujah praise be to God he says here and he goes and has a body that's pure and holy and filled with the spirit walking in the spirit and doing the works that he did be faithful to that he said don't look at the impersonators but man we've been buddies for years I'm sorry I'm sorry but I have to say I'm sorry but gotta go oh but man that guy on TV I mean on the on the videos man he can preach it up in Texas boy howdy that man's got people in his church that's going to burn because of their sins because he's loud homosexuals he's loud in sin that's against my Bible that I believe with all my heart or he can say flowery words but I'll stick with a man from Kentucky I'll stand with a man that lived here in Pawnee America since he's 19 years old and went through trials and tribulations people leaving him because he's standing on what he believes with the truth and today mature men of God preaching the word of God maybe we don't understand it sometimes we get mad at him does anybody get mad at brother window nobody's raising okay two of us three of us the rest of your not you're not lying I'm gonna call you Liars but you're not telling the truth but we do love him that I need there's some kind of Steel that's in that man that's going to produce this bill to go bound the right way instead of bomb it's got to be better than a bomb has got to have some kind of symbol that's going to please my God if that priests who walk in there and those Chimes not working right he was a dead man if my life ain't according to the word of God that's for this day I'm a dead man I don't care how many quotes I quote how much scriptures I quote if I'm not walking and according of the word of God and those bills are not ringing right I'm a dead man how can I say I love you if I don't love you don't speak nothing if you can't say the truth you'd be better off saying I don't like you brother Joe and then guess what gotta fix it sometimes we have to speak things so that God can understand grab a hotel and say wait a minute let's work this out what is it we're a cultina fading our heart and our mind so the word the fullness of the word can come and drop right here and produce Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever oh Hallelujah what's something's real something's real there's hunger and thirst to find the real thing they don't want theology they don't want some intellect speech they want something that gives them an insurance something that makes the Bible live again living in where in me in you you want God to live in you you want to be a son or a daughter of God that you can stand there and say Satan you're a liar thank you I had this one guy that used to irritate me to knowing I had to work with him every single day and he always teased me finally one day I'm just a working instead of hollering back at him spitting at him things I just ignored him the whole day brother Kobe I did say a word to him he would tell you William you need to do this I stopped and I go do it and I come back and I've been finishing the end of the day he goes William what's wrong with you nothing he goes what have I done to you why are you mad at me I said I ain't mad at you and I went home he went to the boss that says this guy doesn't like me no more and the boss looks at him says wonder why you keep running your mouth all the time to him he's tired of it so he's ignoring you so maybe you'll flee ended up being my buddy instead of fighting back and forth I loved him By ignoring him for just a little while so he would leave me alone and that leave alone caused him he wanted to be my buddy and now we're buddies to this day but it's what you're going to do on the circumstances that's in your life today we can be puffed up and I can tease brother Kobe and he can get mad at me beat me up very easily but what would that do to him cause him to be wrong I don't want to be wrong I want the flow of God coming out of me and shine is so bright when that sun comes from the East and it hits that ground brother Mike I want the seed that said me to shine the beautifulest flower that I got why Prophet God said watch out he said friends watch out this world is going to get awful it's going to be sick it's going to be so so dark you're going to have to have his light to be able to get through this world we're going to have a lot of fight but we've got to be strengthened by God to go through those fights Hallelujah oh my God that's the truth saint brother Brown was talking here and I already said it a little bit but he talked about this guy and this guy Saint Thomas went out and brought the gospel to India but didn't they didn't do they turn into intellectual theology there is Lays he said and this guy was talking and he says he's talking to brother Brown and I want to just re redo this because I didn't really say it like brother random really said this he says he goes he said we here over here in India that God was giving you a gift to make this Bible live again that's what we're interested in to make the Bible live again every true pastor who wants the Bible to live in every human that comes into church he might get a little rough he might get a little soft and he might cry a little but brothers and sisters if we can just take the words that he says and take them home and digest it slowly if you have to but digest it brother Brown loved beans and and uh onions but the belly didn't like it but he knew that God healed him and he would spin it up and hit suck it right back down until that Faith kicked in sometimes we got to eat the word that comes across this pulpit and we got to eat it and just keep it in keep it in because it's the best thing for us it might be a fertilizer it might be a when back home after we plant the ground and it's wheat we got wheat out there and it's all nice and smooth and it's pretty looks like like grass when it starts growing it grows and it grows and it grows well you can't go out there in a tractor and just drive through it because you kill your Harvest so you hire this guy in this plane and this plane got these big old sprinklers with a big old tank on the back of his his little teeny uh plane called a crop duster and he flies down there and you think this guy's gonna hit the ground and he's about two feet and you all of a sudden you see this white puffy steamy stuff just boiling up behind you anything how in the world did that little motor do that it's not the motor it's the pesticide the fertilizer that's in that tank that's being spread upon that on that because wheat you do not want no weeds you don't want no bugs to get into your wheat and so they spray this thing once a month they keep it clean they keep it fertilized and sometimes the things that brother Wendell preaches across the pulpit it's fertilizer sometimes it's a pesticide that wants to kill that root I was telling a man this weekend I said you the things that you got from that preacher that hurts you is those words that that man said to you for years after years and you believed it now they're growing and they're growing but now you're trying to get rid of them but if you grab a hotel and just pull it it'll break off but I said if you get the Holy Ghost and you feed and use that fertilizer and use the pesticide Holy Ghost and bring it down into your heart it will kill the roots and the body will Decay those roots into nothing it takes God to clean it out takes the word of God it takes a real farmer a real man of God that is your Shepherd to help root out some of these things and what does it do it makes you free because now you're not only you're working on you you got a brother that loves you and come over so let me help you with your garden today you come on Sunday to I want to help you out a little bit we have to help each other out that's why we've got to love our enemies we've got to love us one another to a place that the word of God can flow Among Us I was sitting there fellowshipping with brother Samuel and and another black brother and his name was uh Moses and I can't remember the little skinny guy that played the guitar couldn't play that guitar good but he was setting them and we were sitting there and then brother Tim the preacher that preached first he came come down and we were sitting there talking and all of a sudden oh brother Tim was just bawling and we were just talking about the Lord just tears running and and brother Sammy goes is it everything okay here he goes to this Fellowship I need this Fellowship I don't have Fellowship like this is it's me and my little church alone he goes this is what's Lifting me up this is giving me a drink of water you guys are giving me a drink of water how a sudden a few minutes later he starts speaking I start crying I'm thinking man this is great we were there for two hours just just back and forth talking about God and talking about our experience in the Lord and seeing the lift up and the lift up in that little time that we was there something happened something good happened oh I love the fellowship around the word of God because why he comes down you start talking about him that rain falls and oh it's so sweet the smell when the rain comes through and you smell the that odor that it brings across cleans the air cleans everything up makes the trees look pretty makes the cars look good makes the house look good what is it it's the rain Mother Nature coming down and breathing us a little moisture a little blessing here the ranchers here was all put out they were working on their their all their pumps getting them ready to go because they thought they're going to have a dry and then Here Comes god with rain and all the ponds are filled up again what is it the mercies of God God is good to his people God is good to you and I why because he loves you and me Hallelujah now if this God who made the Bible who wrote the Bible you believe God inspired the Bible is inspired God's word you believe it do you believe it with with all your heart all right he says it's God's inspired word then if it's God's inspired word then if inspiration of God is here with us to make this word live to prove what we're here surely you can receive him isn't that right Romans 8 says this he says Romans 8 and 6 says for for to be Cardinal minding his death but to be spiritual minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is an enemy against God for it is not subject to the law or of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ER not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you what is it when you're cultivating you're cultivating your heart you're called royalty and you're reading the word and you're reading the word and then all of a sudden something quickens you the Bible lives what is it I'm a son I'm a daughter of God oh and predestination comes and you understand it oh the Bible lives what is it God living in a vessel again he lived in Jesus Christ one day but he died and Rose and went to heaven that body the Corporal body but God Spirit come down to living man so the Bible can live again Hallelujah I want you to know church God lives in his people and if you are his people we're going to act like him we're going to talk like him we're going to breathe like him and we are going to say Sin is Sin but spiritual Things Are Spiritual things we're not going to be Cardinal we're going to be spiritual we're going to live for him because he quickened this body he's the one that made this body live he's the one that had created you before the foundations of the world that that feeling lay inside of you one day was dormant but now it lives because it rotted and it died and if you're a follower that comes back in the spring you might have to die out a little while in the wintertime but little Miss Lily you're gonna come through again and you're going to produce a pretty little flower oh saints of God I want to produce the word I want to produce Jesus Christ how many in here wants to produce Jesus Christ let's live for him I've got a lot more but I'm going to quit right there Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever maybe God will give me another opportunity to preach on but let's stand and give the Lord the glory tonight hallelujah oh saints of God lets us cultivate our minds let us cultivate our hearts that Jesus Christ come in the fullness of his word live in you the hope of glory oh we're

because brother William said we're not none of us none of us are victims absolutely not victims the situations that God allows in our lives and God's put those things in our lives to grow with to grow by to mature in but the problem is many a times we're not feeding on that word we're not taking that word and really applying it and therefore amen the the the weight that that you should be building muscle is tearing muscle up amen you're wise because if you're going to be if you're going to be lifting weights amen you're going to have to have a special diet you can't be eating just cheeseburgers all the time you're going to have to have a lot of protein you got to be able to build those muscles and strengthen those muscles because it's tearing muscles up and it's got to have something to replenish them back and the situations in our lives that come the reason why it tears the church down a man tears the individual down is because we're not feeding on those other things that God has ordained to bring us up amen so we don't want to have torn muscles we want to be big old muscled up people amen Scott's going to give us the task God's going to send us the trials he's going to give

sometimes it's the wrong things and and that can create a man bitterness that can create hurt feelings and early in my in my Christian walk I'm here to tell you I was a whooped pup I was defeated but God instead of just babying me he just poured it on me and allow situations that seemed like I just I thought I was going to die but I had to learn I had to learn and I had to learn by myself amen a lot of things I had to learn by myself amen there's only one way I'm gonna you're gonna have to change your way of thinking I don't care how bad you got it you're not the victim I don't care how bad this enemy is coming you are not defeated amen I had to take that word [Applause] and when I'm sick hallelujah oh sometimes I can I can I can still start going that direction but I I don't want to
