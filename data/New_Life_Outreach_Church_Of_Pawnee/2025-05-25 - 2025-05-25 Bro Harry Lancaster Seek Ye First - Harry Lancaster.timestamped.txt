[0:00] forgive
[0:03] me. My sins have been
[0:06] washed from his
[0:10] memory by the blood of the
[0:15] lamb
[0:19] calary. He
[0:23] has
[0:24] forgiven me.
[0:27] Do you
[0:28] know what it's
[0:31] like for God to be
[0:35] afraid to talk to him with
[0:38] nothing in
[0:42] between? Do you know what it's
[0:46] like when the day comes to
[0:51] ear? Sleep in peace because your heart
[0:55] is clear. Oh
[0:58] my. Do you
[1:00] know what it's like when the accuser
[1:05] comes your
[1:06] way to look him squarely in the eye with
[1:12] confidence and
[1:15] say
[1:17] he
[1:18] has
[1:20] forgiven me.
[1:23] sins have been
[1:26] washed from his
[1:30] memory by the blood of the
[1:34] lamb of
[1:38] Calary.
[1:40] He
[1:42] has
[1:44] forgiven
[1:46] [Music]
[1:48] me. I
[1:50] repent for moments I have
[1:55] spared recalling all the
[1:59] pain and failures of my past.
[2:06] I
[2:08] repent for dwelling on the
[2:12] things beyond my power to
[2:16] change. The chains that held me
[2:21] fast. I will go
[2:25] on. My past I leave behind me.
[2:31] I'll gladly
[2:33] take his mercy and his
[2:39] love. He is joy and he is
[2:43] peace. He is strength and sweet release.
[2:51] I
[2:51] [Music]
[2:53] am I
[2:57] will I give
[3:00] up the bitterness and
[3:05] hate the blaming men and
[3:09] faith for all my discontent.
[3:14] Yes, the guilt and
[3:17] pain I empty from my
[3:21] cup so God can fill it
[3:25] up with peace and sweet
[3:30] contempt. I will go
[3:33] on my past I leave behind me.
[3:39] I'll gladly
[3:41] take his mercy and his
[3:47] love. He is joy and he is
[3:51] peace. He is strength and sweet release.
[3:56] I know he is and I am
[4:01] here. I will go
[4:05] on. I will go on.
[4:09] My past I leave behind
[4:13] me. I'll gladly
[4:16] take. His mercy and his
[4:21] love. He is joy and he is
[4:26] peace. He is strength and sweet release.
[4:31] I know he is and I am his.
[4:37] I will go
[4:41] home. No one
[4:43] knew how alone I was
[4:49] feeling. And the
[4:51] emptiness I tried so hard to hide.
[4:57] Oh, I laugh and said my
[5:01] life is far without you.

[35:04] you. So glad there's more of him to be

[36:08] overwhelming. It's
[36:10] [Music]
[36:14] overwhelming. Let's sing that one more
[36:17] [Music]
[36:19] time. more I seek
[36:28] you, the more I find
[36:35] you. The
[36:37] more I find
[36:39] [Music]
[36:40] [Laughter]
[36:44] you, the more I love you.
[36:51] I want to sit at your feet. Drink from
[36:55] the cup in your
[36:58] hands. Hear your words in my
[37:02] ears. Feel your
[37:06] heartbeat. This love is so
[37:10] real, more than I can understand.
[37:15] I rest in your
[37:18] peace. It's overwhelming.
[37:22] [Music]
[37:28] It's overwhelming.
[37:33] [Music]
[37:34] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[37:37] Praise the Lord.
[37:40] Let's go ahead and bless the Lord. turn
[37:43] into our
[37:47] scriptures. We're going to go
[37:49] to Mark
[37:58] 12. Mark 12:es 29 and 30 to start.
[38:17] Mark chapter 12 starting at verse
[38:20] 29. And Jesus answered him, the first of
[38:23] all the commandments is here, O Israel,
[38:25] the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou
[38:28] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[38:30] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[38:32] thy mind and with all thy strength. This
[38:34] is the first commandment. Let's turn to
[38:37] Matthew chapter
[38:44] 6. Matthew chapter 6, starting
[38:50] at verse
[38:59] 31. Therefore, take no thought, saying,
[39:01] "What shall we eat, or what shall we
[39:03] drink, or wherewith all shall we be
[39:05] clothed?
[39:06] For all these things do the Gentiles
[39:08] seek. For your heavenly Father knoweth
[39:10] that ye have need of all these things.
[39:13] But seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[39:15] his righteousness, and all these things
[39:17] shall be added unto you. Take therefore
[39:20] no thought for the tomorrow, for the
[39:21] moder shall take thought for the things
[39:23] of itself. Sufficient unto the day is
[39:26] the evil thereof. Let's go ahead and bow
[39:29] our
[39:31] heads. Lord Jesus, we come into your
[39:33] presence this evening, Lord.
[39:35] Lord, we just thank you for allowing us
[39:37] to to gather together once more, Lord,
[39:39] to Lord, we've we've come and we've
[39:42] we've worshiped you, Lord Jesus. We've
[39:44] we've we've lifted praises up to you,
[39:46] Lord. And Lord, already we've seen the
[39:49] devil just trying to to disrupt the
[39:51] service, Lord. And Lord, we pray that
[39:53] right now you would just go to the the
[39:56] back room right now, Lord, and that you
[39:57] would just be with with Sister Fres in a
[40:00] special way, Lord. That you would just
[40:01] continue to strengthen her body, Lord.
[40:03] that you would continue to to quiet and
[40:06] and and calm her nerves, Lord Jesus.
[40:09] Just help her to be able to relax and
[40:11] enjoy the service, Lord. Enjoy your
[40:14] presence, Lord. Enjoy the word, Lord
[40:16] Jesus. Lord, I pray that you would be
[40:18] with the rest of us, Lord. That you
[40:19] would help us to to keep ourselves
[40:21] focused on you, Lord. To help us to stay
[40:24] focused on on your word, Lord, and Lord,
[40:26] not to allow ourselves to be distracted
[40:28] by what the the enemy would try to be
[40:30] throwing our way, Lord.
[40:32] Lord, may we just Lord, may we just
[40:34] reach out to to touch the hem of your
[40:36] garment as you're passing by, Lord.
[40:38] Lord, I pray that you would guide me,
[40:40] Lord. That you would give me the right
[40:41] words to speak, Lord. That you would,
[40:43] Lord, just that you would quicken the
[40:45] the words, Lord. That they would just be
[40:48] a blessing to your people, Lord. That
[40:49] they would minister to the needs of of
[40:51] everyone here, Lord. And that we would
[40:53] walk away knowing that we've been in
[40:55] your presence once more.
[40:57] Lord, we just commit the remainder of
[40:58] the service into your hands, Lord, and
[40:59] pray that you would take complete
[41:01] control. We just love you and we thank
[41:03] you for all that you do for us. In the
[41:04] name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[41:06] Amen. You may all have your seats.
[41:09] Praise the
[41:14] Lord. Psalms chapter
[41:18] 16 and verse 8. I'd like to read that as
[41:22] well real
[41:23] quick as we're getting started
[41:27] here. Psalms chapter
[41:29] 16 and verse 8 says, "I have set the
[41:32] Lord always before me. Because he is at
[41:35] my right hand, I shall not be moved."
[41:38] All
[41:39] right. Now, in the sermon in his
[41:41] presence in 1962, brother Brandham's
[41:44] preaching and he says, "Now listen,
[41:46] church, I love you and I I want you to
[41:47] listen to me now." As brother McCulla
[41:50] used to say, I'm going to say something.
[41:52] Always put the Lord before you and don't
[41:54] you do nothing that you wouldn't do in
[41:56] his presence because he's watching over
[41:58] you. See, the Lord is encamped about
[42:00] those who fear him. He stays right there
[42:02] near you and he knows everything you're
[42:04] doing. And you must recognize that when
[42:07] you start to tell a lie, don't do it.
[42:08] Remember, God is listening at you. If
[42:10] you start to do a little cheat, don't
[42:12] you do it. God's looking at you. If you
[42:15] start to take his name in vain, don't do
[42:16] it. God's listening at you. Start to
[42:19] smoke a cigarette, he's watching you.
[42:20] See, we used to sing a song all along on
[42:24] the road to the soul's true abode.
[42:25] There's an eye watching you. Every step
[42:28] that you take, this great eye is awake.
[42:30] There's an eye watching you. Remember,
[42:32] do like David. Put the Lord always
[42:34] before your face and your heart will
[42:36] rejoice and your flesh shall rest in
[42:38] hope. For he promised it. Yes, sir. He
[42:40] knew that he would raise it up because
[42:42] God had promised it. All right.
[42:49] Amen.
[42:51] Now, we've all heard the the scriptures
[42:55] read before. Seek ye first the kingdom
[42:59] of God and his righteousness.
[43:01] And there have been plenty of sermons
[43:04] preached on it. There have been plenty
[43:06] of Sunday school lessons taught on
[43:09] it. But at the same time, it's something
[43:12] that all too often we can begin to let
[43:18] slip. We live in a world where everyone
[43:21] very commonly is asking, "What are your
[43:25] goals? What are you trying to achieve?"
[43:27] Especially if you're in the business
[43:29] world or as I have been going through
[43:32] job interviews, one of the most standard
[43:34] questions they ask is where do you see
[43:36] yourself in five years? Or okay, what do
[43:38] you want to be do in the next five
[43:40] years? Or what do you want to accomplish
[43:41] in the next five years? Or everything's
[43:43] about what are you going to be able to
[43:46] do? What are you building? What are you
[43:49] creating? What are you what position do
[43:51] you want to achieve? How much money do
[43:52] you want to make? What kind of house do
[43:54] you want to have? What kind of family do
[43:55] you want to have? kind of take your pick
[43:57] of what it is. It's all about what is
[43:59] your goal? What are you trying to get
[44:01] to, okay? And that doesn't mean that
[44:04] there's anything wrong with with setting
[44:06] goals. It's nothing wrong with going,
[44:08] "Well, you know, Lord, if you would let
[44:11] me, this is really what I'd I'd like to
[44:13] achieve. I'm sure if we talk to any of
[44:15] the different brothers that own their
[44:16] own businesses, they have some sort of
[44:19] goal that they're working towards."
[44:21] Brother Colby doesn't just go out and
[44:23] get up every morning and go, "Well, I
[44:25] hope I have a job today and I hope I
[44:27] have something to do and you know, I I I
[44:29] hope I get enough gas for my truck and I
[44:31] hope I do this. I hope I do that." He
[44:32] has he has a goal that he wants to get
[44:35] to. Hey, I want to be able to make this
[44:38] much money to provide for my family. I
[44:40] want to be able to have this much
[44:42] freedom so that I can go to the services
[44:44] or that I can do this or I can do that.
[44:46] I sure he has goals. And so there's
[44:49] nothing wrong with having goals or
[44:51] having something that you're working
[44:52] towards.
[44:54] But yet at the same time, we live in a
[44:55] world where everyone will get so wrapped
[44:57] up in that being one of the biggest
[44:59] things and most important things that's
[45:02] going on for them is what are you trying
[45:04] to achieve? What are you trying to get
[45:06] to? Okay. Well, what steps have you
[45:08] taken to get there? Are you great? This
[45:10] is a goal. What what are you doing? And
[45:12] they make it so big and so much of a
[45:15] focus on what are you doing to achieve
[45:20] this in the world around us?
[45:23] What are you doing to make yourself
[45:25] successful? What are you doing to make
[45:27] yourself more wealthy? What are you
[45:28] doing to make
[45:29] yourself more fit, more healthy, more
[45:33] take your pick about whatever subject or
[45:35] whatever topic? What are you doing to
[45:37] work on it? All right. and everything is
[45:40] the world is designed to make you focus
[45:43] on the world. Yeah. The world isn't
[45:46] designed to make you think about God.
[45:48] The world isn't designed to make you
[45:51] look towards the heavens. The world is
[45:53] designed to pull you away from it. The
[45:55] world is designed to make you look at
[45:57] anything but God.
[46:00] To look at everything about what you can
[46:02] do, what you control, what you can
[46:04] achieve. Okay? And yet God God writes in
[46:07] the scriptures and tells us
[46:10] that don't worry about what you're going
[46:12] to eat. Don't worry about what you're
[46:13] going to drink. Don't worry about where
[46:15] your clothes are going to come from. If
[46:18] you go through in life and you seek God
[46:21] first, then the rest I'll add unto you.
[46:25] Now, that doesn't mean that he wants us
[46:28] to be lazy and just get up and go, "All
[46:30] right, Lord. What am I going to do?
[46:31] Where am I going? What's what's next?"
[46:34] That's why I said there's nothing wrong
[46:35] with having some goals about what you're
[46:37] trying to do. Yeah, great. If you're
[46:40] employed with this person, maybe you
[46:42] want to try to move up within their
[46:44] organization. Maybe you want to try you
[46:46] own your own business. You want to build
[46:47] it to make it bigger or better. You're
[46:50] trying to you want to learn this, so
[46:52] you're going to go take the appropriate
[46:54] classes you need or do this or do that.
[46:57] Yes. But even as we're going through
[46:59] those steps, even as we're going through
[47:00] the different things to try to
[47:02] accomplish something that we feel like
[47:05] this is what God would want us to do.
[47:07] Hey, God wants me to be in this career.
[47:10] God wants me to be an electrician. Okay.
[47:13] So then I need to go through the
[47:16] studying. I need to go through the
[47:18] apprenticeships. I need to go through so
[47:20] that I can eventually be able to get the
[47:22] licenses I need and pass these big tests
[47:25] and do all these different things. And
[47:28] that's all good. There's nothing there's
[47:31] nothing bad in doing that in in and of
[47:34] itself.
[47:37] But God tells us that that can't be our
[47:40] first and only concern. That can't be
[47:43] our biggest concern in our life. That
[47:45] can't be where all of our focus is
[47:48] going. Yes, sir. Yeah. It God tells us
[47:52] that we're supposed to love God above
[47:56] above all others and we're supposed to
[47:58] seek him first. Yeah. And if we seek him
[48:01] first, then he'll help us to do the
[48:06] rest.
[48:07] He's not going to help you sit around
[48:09] like a lazy bum and do nothing. and he
[48:11] will still provide for you,
[48:14] but he's going to, you know what? When
[48:16] you go take the test, he's going to help
[48:17] bring those things back to your
[48:18] remembrance so that you can pass. When
[48:21] you go and you're putting in the work,
[48:23] you're putting in the effort. He's going
[48:25] to help you to be able to accomplish
[48:27] some things, to be able to earn what you
[48:30] need to to be able to provide for your
[48:32] family, to be able to pay the bills.
[48:34] Maybe you're not going to be able to buy
[48:35] the new truck, but he's going to keep
[48:36] your old truck running. Maybe you're not
[48:38] going to be able to get the new house.
[48:41] Yeah. But he's going to make it where
[48:43] you have a house you can be comfortable
[48:45] in and you can live in. Might not be
[48:47] quite as nice as you want, but it's
[48:49] there. He's going to meet your needs and
[48:51] he's going to give us what you He's
[48:55] going to give you what you have need of.
[48:57] Yes, sir.
[49:00] Yeah.
[49:07] When we go back to the garden,
[49:11] as brother Wendle was talking about it
[49:13] this morning, as
[49:15] we go to we'll go to Genesis chapter 2
[49:19] and verse 16.
[49:26] And the Lord commanded the man, saying,
[49:28] "Of every tree of the garden, thou
[49:29] mayest freely eat, but of the tree of
[49:32] the knowledge of the good and evil, thou
[49:35] shalt not eat of it. For in the day that
[49:37] thou eatest, therefore, thou shalt
[49:39] surely
[49:41] die." We jump ahead to Genesis chapter
[49:46] 3. Brother Wendle read this section of
[49:50] scripture this
[49:51] morning. Genesis chapter 3, starting at
[49:54] verse one. Now the serpent was more
[49:55] subtle than any beast of the field which
[49:57] the Lord had made. And he said unto the
[49:59] woman, "Yay, hath God said, you shall
[50:01] not eat of every tree of the garden."
[50:04] And the woman said unto the serpent, "We
[50:06] may eat of the fruit of the tree of the
[50:08] garden, but of the fruit of the tree
[50:09] which is in the midst of the garden. God
[50:11] hath said, you shall not eat of it,
[50:12] neither shall you touch it, lest ye
[50:14] die." And the serpent said unto the
[50:16] woman, "Ye shall not surely die. For God
[50:18] doth know that in the day you eat
[50:20] thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,
[50:22] and yet shall be as gods, knowing good
[50:24] and evil. And when the woman saw that
[50:26] the tree was good for food, that it was
[50:28] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
[50:30] desired to make one wise, she took of
[50:32] the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave
[50:34] also unto her husband with her, and he
[50:36] did
[50:37] eat. Now, I don't need to spend a whole
[50:39] lot of time talking about original sin.
[50:41] Brother Wendell covered that this
[50:42] morning for us.
[50:45] But yet this is the first time when you
[50:47] see
[50:49] mankind get their eyes off
[50:51] of seek ye first, okay? The kingdom of
[50:57] God. If they were going into it, if he
[51:00] had gone into it with that mindset of
[51:03] seek ye
[51:05] first, then when Satan put out, oh well,
[51:09] God just knows that if you do
[51:11] this, your eyes are going to be opened.
[51:14] You're going to be able to know the
[51:16] difference between good and evil, this,
[51:18] that, or the
[51:20] other. She would have been looking at
[51:22] him going, "Seek ye first. Well, God
[51:24] said this, then that's what I'm going to
[51:26] do."
[51:28] God said, "Don't eat it."
[51:31] Okay, we're done. Moving on. Yeah.
[51:37] And all of us will look back and we can
[51:39] look back at this and go, they had one
[51:41] instruction. They only had one rule to
[51:43] follow. It was don't eat this tree. That
[51:46] was
[51:47] it. There was one thing. Don't eat this
[51:51] tree.
[51:52] And
[51:54] yet it was that easy to lose
[51:58] sight and go, "Oh, well, maybe God's
[52:03] deceiving me. Maybe God's trying to keep
[52:05] me from something better. Maybe God is
[52:08] trying to keep me from becoming like
[52:10] him." Yeah. Yeah.
[52:14] And it seems
[52:18] like we can look back at this and
[52:22] everyone look at why this was such a big
[52:24] thing. It was such a huge thing. But yet
[52:26] in the moment as Eve is talking to the
[52:29] serpent, it wasn't like he was coming
[52:32] out and saying everything God has ever
[52:34] told you was a lie. Yeah. He wasn't
[52:38] trying to throw out every single thing
[52:41] that they had ever had in any of their
[52:43] conversations with God. It was
[52:47] just, you know, it's just this one
[52:49] thing. You won't die. Yeah. Yeah. You
[52:52] won't die. It's just just this one
[52:55] thing. All the other conversations
[52:56] you've had with God have been great. All
[52:58] those evenings you've had communing in
[53:00] the garden, all the things that God said
[53:02] to you in those moments. Does anyone
[53:05] ever wish that was written down in
[53:06] scripture that we wouldn't know what
[53:08] they were saying back and forth in those
[53:09] moments?
[53:12] But yet here it is and he's just going
[53:14] this one thing. Everything else God has
[53:17] said has been right. Yeah. This is it.
[53:23] And she loses
[53:24] sight of the fact
[53:27] that I just have to follow him.
[53:32] If I just stick with what he
[53:34] said, everything's going to be fine.
[53:38] Let's go to 1st Samuel chapter
[53:39] [Music]
[53:43] 15. 1st Samuel chapter 15 and starting
[53:46] at verse
[53:48] one. And Samuel also said unto Saul,
[53:52] "The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be
[53:54] king over his people, over Israel. Now
[53:57] therefore hearken thou unto the voice of
[53:58] the words of the Lord. Thus sayeth the
[54:01] Lord of hosts, I remember that which
[54:02] Amalecch did to Israel, how he laid
[54:05] weight for him in the way when he came
[54:06] up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalecch
[54:09] and utterly destroy all that they have,
[54:11] and spare them not, but slay both man
[54:13] and woman, infant and suckling, ox and
[54:16] sheep, camel and
[54:18] ass. Let's drop down to verse
[54:22] 20. And Saul said unto Samuel Samuel,
[54:25] "Yay, I have obeyed the voice of the
[54:27] Lord, and have gone the way which the
[54:29] Lord sent me." and have brought Aag, the
[54:31] king of Amalecch, and have utterly
[54:33] destroyed the Amalachites. But the
[54:35] people took of the spoil, sheep, and
[54:37] oxen, the chief of the things which
[54:39] should have been utterly destroyed, to
[54:40] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and
[54:42] Gilgal. And Samuel said, Hath the Lord
[54:45] as great delight in burnt offerings, and
[54:47] sacrifice, as in obeying the voice of
[54:49] the Lord. Behold, to obey is better than
[54:52] sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
[54:54] of the rams. For rebellion is as the sin
[54:57] of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
[54:59] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast
[55:02] rejected the word of the Lord, he hath
[55:04] also rejected thee from being king. Wow.
[55:08] All right. Now, Samuel came to Saul and
[55:10] he gave him instructions that once again
[55:13] on the face, it's pretty simple. He
[55:17] said, "Go fight
[55:18] Amalecch and if it breathes, kill it."
[55:22] Yeah. man, woman, child, ox, ash, sheep.
[55:28] Yeah. If it's
[55:30] breathing, it shouldn't be anymore.
[55:33] That's the That's the assignment. Yeah.
[55:37] Everything that has breath, no longer
[55:39] breathing. Yeah. That's what you do. All
[55:42] right. On the surface, it's a very
[55:46] simple instruction. Yes.
[55:49] Saul goes and he leads the army into
[55:51] battle.
[55:55] And it's interesting when I look at
[55:59] this, you know, he tries to lay the
[56:00] blame onto the people for all of the
[56:07] animals, but yet he kind of forgets that
[56:10] he says right up front, I brought the
[56:13] king back alive.
[56:17] So even if Samuel accepted the excuse
[56:21] about the animals,
[56:24] even if that was somehow a valid
[56:27] argument, Yeah. which Samuel when he
[56:30] responds makes clear it's not. But even
[56:32] if it was, Saul still said, "They're all
[56:35] dead except this guy. I kept him alive."
[56:38] Yeah.
[56:41] Yeah. And more than
[56:44] likely, he's going into with the mindset
[56:46] of I'm the first king of Israel. I want
[56:50] to kind of set a precedent so that if
[56:52] they ever defeat me Yeah. they don't
[56:55] kill me. Yeah. So if I spare the king
[57:00] politically, this is a good move. Yeah.
[57:03] So that way if some other kingdom comes
[57:05] in, Yeah. They know that I've spared
[57:08] kings, so they're more likely to spare
[57:11] me and and all this kind of stuff. Yeah,
[57:15] I'm sure he was coming he didn't come
[57:16] into this with the goal of I'm just
[57:19] going to do this to disobey God. That's
[57:20] my whole purpose. Yeah, he had a reason
[57:23] looking at this. Okay, he had a reason
[57:26] of going, okay, this could be a benefit
[57:29] for this reason. He wasn't thinking, oh,
[57:32] I'm going to spare the king and then I'm
[57:33] going to send him back to his land to
[57:34] continue ruling. That wasn't the
[57:36] mindset. Sure. But he was thinking,
[57:39] okay, this is a good this is a good
[57:42] precedent to
[57:43] set. They we don't kill the king so that
[57:47] way they don't kill me. But yet at the
[57:50] same time, he then turns around and sets
[57:52] the blame on the people for well, they
[57:54] spared all this in order for sacrifice.
[57:57] Yeah. Because that's a good thing. We're
[57:59] worshiping God. We're sacrificing. We're
[58:02] giving it all to him. Yeah.
[58:06] And Samuel comes back with the response
[58:08] that I'm sure all of us have read or
[58:10] heard so many
[58:13] times. Obedience is better than
[58:15] sacrifice. Yes. Yes. And we find that
[58:18] throughout the scriptures and case after
[58:20] case as we go through when God gives an
[58:25] instruction and the people lose sight of
[58:28] the fact that their first commandment is
[58:31] to love the
[58:33] Lord and they're supposed to be seeking
[58:36] first the kingdom of God. All right.
[58:39] This is our reason for being on earth is
[58:44] to love and worship
[58:45] God and to seek him. Yes, sir.
[58:50] And when we lose sight of that, when we
[58:52] lose sight of that being the most
[58:54] important things in our
[58:56] life, that's when we allow what seem
[58:59] like small things to slip
[59:01] by. Saul looked at it was like, "Look,
[59:04] I've just slaughtered the entire army.
[59:05] I've killed all these people.
[59:09] I don't remember from the scriptures
[59:10] exactly how big the army was, but we'll
[59:12] say however many thousands of people.
[59:15] So if he if there were 5,000 in the
[59:17] army, he killed 4,999.
[59:23] You know, for most of us, if you got
[59:26] 4,999 out of 5,000, this is a good day.
[59:30] Whatever we're trying to accomplish.
[59:32] Yeah. If I missed only one, if I only
[59:34] miss one out of a thousand in whatever
[59:36] it is, whether it's I'm inputting data
[59:39] in a spreadsheet, whether it's you're
[59:42] hunting, whether it's your fishing,
[59:44] whether it's you're bidding jobs,
[59:46] whether it's whatever, if I only miss
[59:48] once out of a thousand,
[59:50] I'm doing all right. I am probably in
[59:54] the top percentile of whatever industry
[59:56] or whatever job this is if my errors are
[59:59] that low, right?
[1:00:06] He was looking at it going, "I did it. I
[1:00:10] was
[1:00:11] right. 999 out of a thousand. I just
[1:00:15] saved the one king." Right. Yeah. I just
[1:00:18] let the people keep some animals for
[1:00:21] sacrifice.
[1:00:22] All right. This isn't a big deal. This
[1:00:26] is such a small thing. And so when
[1:00:29] Saul's standing there saying, "I did
[1:00:31] what God
[1:00:32] commanded." He's saying it with
[1:00:36] sincerity. He's not standing there
[1:00:38] thinking that he's lying to
[1:00:39] Samuel. He's not standing there thinking
[1:00:42] that he's lying to God. Yeah. He's
[1:00:45] going, "I did it." Because
[1:00:49] 999 out of a
[1:00:52] thousand, that's solid. Yeah. That's
[1:00:56] pretty good. Yeah. Anyone else? They're
[1:00:59] going to sign off. You get an A on your
[1:01:00] report card and you get to move on to
[1:01:03] the next class.
[1:01:05] All right.
[1:01:08] But God doesn't look at things the same
[1:01:09] way that we do. God doesn't apply the
[1:01:11] same filters to things that we do. Okay.
[1:01:15] That one out of a thousand or one out of
[1:01:17] 5,000 or one out of a
[1:01:19] million matters.
[1:01:22] And those little things are the things
[1:01:24] that we start to let slip. When
[1:01:27] we stop seeking God first, okay? When we
[1:01:32] start letting it slip, when we start
[1:01:33] letting God slide to the back burner.
[1:01:36] Yeah. Is when we begin to let those
[1:01:40] single things slide. Yeah. And we stand
[1:01:44] here in our humanity and we go, "This is
[1:01:47] good enough."
[1:01:50] Yeah. What I'm bringing to you, Lord, is
[1:01:52] good enough. What I'm offering to you is
[1:01:54] good enough.
[1:01:57] When Cain came to offer his sacrifice to
[1:02:00] God, he was offering all of his fruits
[1:02:02] and vegetables and all the things that
[1:02:03] he had raised in the garden, he was
[1:02:06] coming in sincerity. He was coming with
[1:02:09] the desire to
[1:02:10] worship. He had been brought up the same
[1:02:12] way as Abel. Okay? He had heard the same
[1:02:16] things from his mother and father. He
[1:02:19] had had the exact same instruction.
[1:02:21] It wasn't that they had taken, all
[1:02:23] right, we're going to lie to Cain all
[1:02:24] his life. Yeah. We don't want him to
[1:02:27] know what actually happened in the
[1:02:28] garden. We don't want him to know what's
[1:02:30] important. Yeah. He wasn't being set up.
[1:02:34] Okay. In the modern terminology, he
[1:02:37] wasn't being punked. Yeah.
[1:02:42] They raised him with the exact same
[1:02:44] information, the exact same upbringing.
[1:02:47] They were teaching him what was
[1:02:50] required. Yes. Okay.
[1:02:54] So, he came with sincerity. He
[1:02:57] came thinking what he had to offer was
[1:03:00] good enough. Yeah. Okay.
[1:03:04] Cuz Lord, I'm bringing you the best of
[1:03:06] what's in my field. I know it's not
[1:03:09] blood
[1:03:11] and I know the original sin was a blood
[1:03:15] issue. Yeah.
[1:03:18] But Lord, the fruits and the vegetables,
[1:03:21] this is the best that I can offer. Yeah.
[1:03:25] Because you know, my brother raises
[1:03:27] sheep.
[1:03:29] I raise fruits and vegetables. So, I'm
[1:03:32] giving you what I This is This is the
[1:03:35] from the sweat of my brow, the calluses
[1:03:37] on my hands brought this forth. Yeah.
[1:03:41] I've put in the months and months of
[1:03:44] work tending these
[1:03:48] crops, weeding
[1:03:50] them, working in the hot sun, doing all
[1:03:53] these things to bring them about,
[1:03:55] battling the thorns and the thistles.
[1:03:57] Yeah. And I'm offering you what I've
[1:04:01] produced. I'm offering you the best that
[1:04:04] I have.
[1:04:06] Yeah.
[1:04:08] And
[1:04:10] yet it was the
[1:04:12] 999 out of a thousand.
[1:04:16] He was missing the one
[1:04:19] piece. He was missing the piece of you
[1:04:22] need blood for redemption. You need
[1:04:25] blood to purify. You need blood to cover
[1:04:29] your sin. Yeah.
[1:04:32] It isn't just about Lord, I'm bringing
[1:04:35] you the best that my hands can produce
[1:04:37] or I'm bringing you the best of the work
[1:04:39] that I can put in. Yeah.
[1:04:42] God's going, I've given you this
[1:04:45] instruction. This is what you're
[1:04:46] supposed to do. Okay. And 999 out of a
[1:04:50] thousand isn't enough. That's not close
[1:04:55] enough. God doesn't take close enough.
[1:04:58] God takes. You come by my word. You come
[1:05:02] by my path. You come by the way that
[1:05:05] I've set before you. You come by the
[1:05:08] narrow
[1:05:10] road. That's what I accept. That's what
[1:05:13] I take. Yeah.
[1:05:15] Matthew chap 24 and verse 24 says, "For
[1:05:18] there shall arise false Christs and
[1:05:20] false prophets and shall show great
[1:05:22] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:05:25] were possible, they shall deceive the
[1:05:27] very
[1:05:29] elect. They're going to have the 999 out
[1:05:32] of a thousand. Yeah. It's going to be so
[1:05:38] close by a razor's edge that it's right
[1:05:41] there." Yes.
[1:05:44] And God says very
[1:05:45] clearly, if you're willing to
[1:05:49] accept
[1:05:51] close, you're going to be deceived.
[1:05:54] Okay. True. Right. He's saying, "If
[1:05:57] you're willing to take your eye off of
[1:05:59] seek ye first the kingdom of God, if
[1:06:03] you're willing to take your eye off,
[1:06:06] love the Lord thy God above all
[1:06:09] else, then you'll be
[1:06:12] deceived because they're that close.
[1:06:14] They have the signs and the wonders.
[1:06:16] They use the same Bible. They'll use
[1:06:19] same scriptures. They'll use the
[1:06:20] different things to point to
[1:06:22] it. And they'll be that close to it.
[1:06:26] so
[1:06:28] close that it would deceive the bride if
[1:06:31] it were
[1:06:32] possible. That's the only thing that can
[1:06:35] make us
[1:06:37] confident that we're not deceived is
[1:06:41] because God put that one little extra in
[1:06:44] there. Okay? He said, "If it were
[1:06:48] possible," Okay. All right. He didn't
[1:06:51] leave it as in so much that they shall
[1:06:55] deceive the very elect.
[1:06:57] He said in so much that if it were
[1:07:01] possible, they're going to be that
[1:07:02] close. They're going to be shooting the
[1:07:04] target that accurately where they're
[1:07:07] bully after bullseye after bullseye
[1:07:09] after bullseye except for this one shot
[1:07:12] that's off to the side. Yeah.
[1:07:16] You know, remember when brother Brandham
[1:07:18] talked about that one rifle, and I
[1:07:20] forget which brand it was,
[1:07:22] that he could
[1:07:24] drill bullseye after bullseye after
[1:07:27] bullseye after bullseye at however many
[1:07:29] yards it was. Yeah, I'm not a gun guy,
[1:07:32] so I don't remember those. I could
[1:07:34] probably ask brother Austin. He could
[1:07:35] tell me all the facts and
[1:07:36] figures, but he could
[1:07:39] drill bullseye after bullseye because he
[1:07:41] had done it. Yeah. And
[1:07:44] then he had one that it wasn't doing
[1:07:47] that. It wasn't grouping that tightly.
[1:07:50] It was within a however many inch group
[1:07:53] at that many yards. Yeah. And he talked
[1:07:55] to he contacted the manufacturer. He's
[1:07:58] like, "There's something off with this
[1:08:00] rifle." Yeah. Cuz it's not drilling like
[1:08:03] it should. And they said, "No, that's
[1:08:06] that's within the the realm of
[1:08:08] acceptable for when we make these
[1:08:10] rifles. This is this is still a very
[1:08:12] accurate weapon. This is what we would
[1:08:15] say is good. Yeah. And yet brother
[1:08:18] Brandham standing there going, "No, this
[1:08:21] is not because I have shot with this
[1:08:24] rifle and I have achieved this result."
[1:08:26] Oh, yeah. Which means that if I'm not
[1:08:29] achieving that result, there is
[1:08:31] something wrong here. Yeah. Cuz I've
[1:08:33] seen it done. I've seen the way it
[1:08:35] should work. I'm not going to accept the
[1:08:38] 999 out of a thousand. I'm not going to
[1:08:41] accept this variation because I know it
[1:08:45] should be doing this. Yeah.
[1:08:50] Brother Brandham said that God designed
[1:08:52] him that way.
[1:08:54] He had to be that way to be able to
[1:08:56] handle the word of God the way that he
[1:08:57] did, to be able to be the prophet for
[1:08:59] the last hour. Well, the bride's going
[1:09:01] to be the same way.
[1:09:03] We're not going to be in the mindset of
[1:09:05] close is good enough or close enough is
[1:09:10] good enough.
[1:09:12] We're not the bride isn't in tune to the
[1:09:15] point of going, "Well, 99 out of a
[1:09:17] 100red or 999 out of a
[1:09:20] thousand or keep taking the bigger the
[1:09:22] number bigger going, "Oh, we only missed
[1:09:25] one out of a million. That's good
[1:09:27] enough." Yeah. That's not the mindset of
[1:09:30] the bride.
[1:09:32] The mindset of the bride was modeled for
[1:09:34] us by the prophet going, "This is what
[1:09:36] the word said,
[1:09:39] so that's what it is." Yeah. Yeah. If
[1:09:42] this is what it says in the scriptures,
[1:09:44] then there's no deviation. There's no
[1:09:47] going, "Well, that was for another day.
[1:09:49] Well, that was for another hour." No. If
[1:09:51] God put it in the Bible, it's for now.
[1:09:55] Yeah. If God wrote it there, Amen. And
[1:09:59] he has maintained it through all the
[1:10:03] years, all the hundreds of years,
[1:10:07] through however many different languages
[1:10:10] being translated. Yeah. Being changed,
[1:10:13] going through all these different
[1:10:14] things, and he's maintained the
[1:10:17] scriptures, held the authenticity.
[1:10:20] Okay. God's not looking at it and going,
[1:10:23] "Eh, that's close enough."
[1:10:26] You know, when they were when you would
[1:10:28] have the the monks that would be hand
[1:10:32] transcribing the Bible and they would be
[1:10:35] copying from one Bible that had been
[1:10:37] finished and they would be copying into
[1:10:39] their own, writing out the
[1:10:42] scriptures. They would
[1:10:44] have the headmaster or the whatever the
[1:10:47] guy's title was that was in charge would
[1:10:49] come in and he would read it over. Yeah.
[1:10:53] And if there was a single
[1:10:57] flaw, if there was a single punctuation
[1:11:00] mark in the wrong
[1:11:01] place, if there was a single word
[1:11:04] misspelled, if there was a single
[1:11:09] deviation, then the entire document had
[1:11:11] to be thrown away. They didn't just get
[1:11:14] rid of, well, you're working on this
[1:11:15] page, so redo that page. It was the
[1:11:18] entire thing's
[1:11:19] gone. Start over.
[1:11:24] Because 99 out of 100 wasn't good
[1:11:26] enough. They weren't looking for close.
[1:11:29] They weren't looking for it's close
[1:11:32] enough. It's almost perfect. Yeah. They
[1:11:35] were looking for this is the word of
[1:11:37] God. We don't change it. We don't adjust
[1:11:41] it. We don't mess with it. We don't edit
[1:11:45] it. Okay? If this is how God wrote it,
[1:11:49] if this is how God inspired man to put
[1:11:51] it down on paper, we're going to keep it
[1:11:54] exactly the same. All right? We're going
[1:11:57] to copy it precisely
[1:12:00] and it will be 100 out of 100. 1,000 out
[1:12:03] of 10,000. There will be no deviation.
[1:12:06] Okay? Because that was what was
[1:12:09] required.
[1:12:11] Yeah. I mean, think about it right now.
[1:12:16] I didn't look this up. I should have. In
[1:12:19] exactly how many words are in the
[1:12:21] English King James
[1:12:24] Bible, however many thousands of words
[1:12:28] that
[1:12:33] is. Actually, we're going to look it up.
[1:12:37] All right. The King James Bible contains
[1:12:43] 783,137 words,
[1:12:46] right?
[1:12:54] 783,137. If every time it was
[1:12:57] transcribed, if every time it was
[1:13:00] copied, if every
[1:13:03] time they handed off to a new
[1:13:06] printer, they handed off to a new
[1:13:09] production, a new whatever, and there
[1:13:12] was one error in every single
[1:13:15] time. That's good
[1:13:17] enough. It's one out
[1:13:19] of a thousand, one out of 100,
[1:13:23] one, one out of
[1:13:26] 783,000. That's good enough. You can
[1:13:28] mess up on one word each
[1:13:30] time. And over the hundreds of years,
[1:13:32] you keep having one error and one error
[1:13:36] and one error and one error.
[1:13:41] We would now be standing
[1:13:43] here looking at the scriptures and
[1:13:47] seeing the cow grazing in the tree. All
[1:13:49] right.
[1:13:51] As brother Brandham talked about when
[1:13:53] making the puzzle, we that would be the
[1:13:55] image we would see. Yeah. Because it was
[1:13:59] good enough. All right.
[1:14:04] But yet God has protected this
[1:14:07] word over the hundreds and thousands of
[1:14:10] years from when it was transcribed
[1:14:13] depending on which book of the Bible
[1:14:14] you're talking about. He's maintained
[1:14:16] the accuracy over all that time. Okay?
[1:14:19] And he never once looked at it and was
[1:14:21] like, "That'll be good enough for my
[1:14:25] bride. That'll be good enough for
[1:14:28] Leodysia. They can let that one slide.
[1:14:30] They can they can let that edit slide.
[1:14:33] That's okay. It's not a problem. Yeah.
[1:14:37] But God went through it and maintained
[1:14:40] and held the scriptures through all of
[1:14:41] those
[1:14:43] years so that we as the bride could go,
[1:14:47] he didn't really mean
[1:14:49] that. That's not that important. That's
[1:14:52] not that big a
[1:14:56] deal. If God maintained the scriptures
[1:14:59] for this long, Yeah.
[1:15:02] then how in the world can we look at it
[1:15:03] and go,
[1:15:07] "Yeah, it
[1:15:09] doesn't
[1:15:10] matter. It doesn't hold importance to
[1:15:13] us." Okay.
[1:15:18] All right.
[1:15:20] In Song of Songs, it
[1:15:22] says, "The little foxes that spoil the
[1:15:26] vines, for the vines have tender
[1:15:28] grapes." It's he's not talking about
[1:15:31] it's these big issues. It's He's not
[1:15:35] talking about in the translation of
[1:15:36] scriptures, they were messing up entire
[1:15:39] chapters and that's a big deal that we
[1:15:41] have to watch out for. They're messing
[1:15:44] up big problems, big issues. But he's
[1:15:48] going, "Hey, it's the small things."
[1:15:50] Yeah. It's the little issues.
[1:15:54] It's messing up the single word. It's
[1:15:56] messing up the single punctuation.
[1:16:00] And so often we can treat the scriptures
[1:16:03] or treat what we've learned from the
[1:16:06] prophet in that kind of manner where we
[1:16:08] begin to go, it's really not that big a
[1:16:10] deal. Okay? It's really not that
[1:16:14] important.
[1:16:17] Brother Brandham reminded us in the
[1:16:20] quote that I wrote a little bit earlier
[1:16:21] about the fact
[1:16:23] that when you're tempted to do that
[1:16:27] little white lie, when you're that
[1:16:29] little bit of dishonesty, that that
[1:16:31] little crooked deal, that little
[1:16:34] whatever, remember God's right there
[1:16:36] with you. God's God's watching. And God
[1:16:38] cares about the little things. God cares
[1:16:42] about those little changes.
[1:16:47] We're not talking about going from
[1:16:50] sitting on the front pew and tomorrow
[1:16:53] they're slumped over a bar drunk
[1:16:55] somewhere. Yeah. We're not talking about
[1:16:58] it being a huge shift in a matter of
[1:17:02] moments.
[1:17:04] But we're talking about those decisions
[1:17:05] that we
[1:17:07] make every day, day in and day out,
[1:17:10] where
[1:17:11] we step up to it and we either make the
[1:17:15] decision, we're seeking God first. Okay.
[1:17:19] Or we make the
[1:17:21] decision, I'm going to do what I want to
[1:17:23] do. Okay. All right.
[1:17:27] It's not in the big moments. It's not in
[1:17:31] the major descript major decisions that
[1:17:34] we see the character of a man or a
[1:17:37] woman. Yeah. Yeah. It's in a lifetime of
[1:17:41] these small moments. That's true. A
[1:17:44] lifetime of these small decisions where
[1:17:47] you step up to it and you
[1:17:51] decide, you
[1:17:53] know, it's okay for me to twist the
[1:17:56] truth just a little bit. I'm trying to
[1:17:58] spare their feelings. I don't I don't
[1:18:01] want to hurt
[1:18:02] them. So, I'm just going to change the
[1:18:04] way I say it a little bit.
[1:18:08] All
[1:18:09] right. And yet, God's standing there and
[1:18:12] going, "No, speak the truth. Speak the
[1:18:16] truth in love." That doesn't mean you
[1:18:18] come out and beat someone over the head
[1:18:20] with whatever truth you need to give
[1:18:23] them, but you also don't try to sidestep
[1:18:26] it. You also don't try to avoid it. You
[1:18:29] make the decision on I'm seeking God
[1:18:32] first.
[1:18:34] In the small moments, in the small
[1:18:38] decisions, I'm seeking God first. Yeah.
[1:18:45] In the unwelcome Christ.
[1:18:50] Brother Brandham says, "Listen, in
[1:18:52] America, when the president comes to a
[1:18:54] city, well, they lay out the carpet.
[1:18:56] They drape the flag, put flowers
[1:18:57] everywhere, the bands play, everything.
[1:18:59] The show is booked. Everybody, they want
[1:19:01] to make him welcome. But when Jesus
[1:19:03] comes, you push him in a mission. You
[1:19:05] make ready for everything else but
[1:19:07] Jesus. Yeah. That's the way the
[1:19:09] Pharisees did. Oh my. What a what a pity
[1:19:11] to see that condition. Listen, I want to
[1:19:13] ask you something now. Did you ever pray
[1:19:15] for Jesus to come to your house? If you
[1:19:17] say if you say amen, sure you have. How
[1:19:20] did you treat him when he come? Yeah.
[1:19:22] Did you give him a little place up in
[1:19:23] the attic? Maybe maybe your sewing party
[1:19:26] is there that day. When Jesus comes to
[1:19:28] your heart, do you feel like
[1:19:31] crying? You feel like weeping out. You
[1:19:33] feel like praising him. But what do you
[1:19:35] do with him? You put him up in the
[1:19:36] attic. You You go up in the attic over
[1:19:39] in a little room or down in the cellar
[1:19:40] and get down there, say, "Thank you,
[1:19:42] Jesus." Or something. You're ashamed of
[1:19:44] him before your
[1:19:45] company. Shame before your company.
[1:19:47] Ashamed of him before your company. If
[1:19:49] If you are, you ought to repent today.
[1:19:51] Amen. Give Jesus first place.
[1:19:54] Yeah. First in life, first your best,
[1:19:57] not not your second, your first. Seek ye
[1:20:00] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:20:01] righteousness, and other things will be
[1:20:02] added. But do you let him sit back when
[1:20:05] when you're talking to your boss and
[1:20:07] Jesus comes down and he wants you to
[1:20:08] testify him and tell your boss that the
[1:20:11] love of God's in your heart? Are you
[1:20:13] ashamed of him? Do you do you give a
[1:20:15] little corner? I might ask this to
[1:20:17] Jesus. Jesus, will you take second
[1:20:19] place? Yeah. Jesus would say, yeah.
[1:20:23] Would you take third place? Yeah. Will
[1:20:26] you take fifth place? Yeah, I'll come
[1:20:29] anyhow.
[1:20:31] You think your neighbor would come if he
[1:20:33] taken fifth place? No. That's what makes
[1:20:35] me love him. Makes me know that he's the
[1:20:38] God of heaven. He'll take any place that
[1:20:40] man will give him. The man will give him
[1:20:43] any place that you'll give him in your
[1:20:45] heart. Some of you people only go to
[1:20:47] church once a year. Oh my, it's Easter
[1:20:49] morning. You put on your most charming
[1:20:51] garments, your beautiful hat, and you go
[1:20:53] down to church and you set 20 minutes
[1:20:54] and then you come back and say that
[1:20:56] settles it till next Easter. Yeah. Does
[1:20:59] Jesus accept it? Amen. He accepts it.
[1:21:03] Any place you'll give him, he will
[1:21:05] accept it.
[1:21:10] You know, we're called to to seek God
[1:21:12] first. We're called to to love God above
[1:21:15] all others.
[1:21:18] But yet God will take whatever place
[1:21:19] we'll give him. Yeah.
[1:21:22] If we invite him in, he'll he'll sit
[1:21:26] there. He went to dinner with the one
[1:21:30] Pharisee and sat there with dirty feet.
[1:21:33] Yeah. He still showed up. He was still
[1:21:36] okay sitting off in the
[1:21:38] corner with dirty feet. Yeah.
[1:21:42] Unanointed, left alone.
[1:21:46] But yet he still came because he'd been
[1:21:47] invited.
[1:21:59] Okay. Hebrews chapter 10 and verse
[1:22:03] 25 says, "Not forsaking the assembling
[1:22:06] of ourselves together as the manner of
[1:22:08] some is, but exhorting one another and
[1:22:10] so much the more as you see the day
[1:22:12] approaching."
[1:22:14] In the sermon convinced then Concerned,
[1:22:16] Brother Brandham says you must be sure
[1:22:19] the Holy Spirit will bring forth a holy
[1:22:20] life. That's right. And if the desires
[1:22:22] in your heart, if you have to force
[1:22:25] yourself constantly to try to press and
[1:22:26] do what's right, and the world is still
[1:22:28] hungering you in you, then there's
[1:22:30] something wrong. See, the Holy Spirit in
[1:22:32] you will not hunger for the world, it'll
[1:22:34] hunger for God. If it's hard for you to
[1:22:36] go to church and press yourself to come
[1:22:38] when the church is open, there's
[1:22:39] something wrong with that spirit. It's
[1:22:42] trying to keep you away from God. The
[1:22:44] spirit of God will run you right
[1:22:45] straight to the church every time the
[1:22:47] door opens for fellowship.
[1:22:49] Yes, sir. See, you've got to be sure of
[1:22:52] this now. Yeah. The time is at hand.
[1:22:55] Yeah, that's very true. You know, we
[1:22:59] had when my wife and I were in Florida,
[1:23:02] we'd gone through some different times
[1:23:05] and I'd actually just gone back into the
[1:23:08] the Chick-fil-A world. I was back
[1:23:10] working at a Chick-fil-A location in
[1:23:11] Florida. was our last year that we were
[1:23:14] living in Florida before we decided to
[1:23:15] move to
[1:23:17] Alabama. And I had worked my way up
[1:23:21] within the organization there. I'd begun
[1:23:24] to move up through through
[1:23:26] management
[1:23:28] and I was one of the top three people
[1:23:32] there.
[1:23:35] But part of it is I was working an 11 to
[1:23:40] close
[1:23:44] shift Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday,
[1:23:52] Saturday. I was putting in
[1:23:54] basically 12-hour days each
[1:24:00] day. I would go to work.
[1:24:04] I would get off. I would come home. My
[1:24:08] family would all be
[1:24:10] asleep. I would shower. I would go to
[1:24:13] bed. I would sleep
[1:24:18] till 8
[1:24:21] 8:30 cuz I hadn't gone to bed till
[1:24:25] midnight. I'd get up, I'd eat breakfast
[1:24:29] with my family, and I'd go to work
[1:24:31] again.
[1:24:37] And as the weeks built up and as the
[1:24:40] time continued to
[1:24:43] pass, I began to look at it
[1:24:46] and I missed spending time with my
[1:24:48] family. I missed seeing them for more
[1:24:50] than just an hour in the morning.
[1:24:55] Yeah. And yes, on Wednesdays, I was
[1:24:58] still working. It wasn't the close
[1:24:59] shift. if I was getting to go to church
[1:25:01] Wednesday night, but I was still working
[1:25:03] on Wednesday as
[1:25:07] well. And so our church in Florida, we
[1:25:10] had just like we do here, we had both a
[1:25:12] Sunday morning and a Sunday evening
[1:25:14] service. And we would get up after the
[1:25:18] late night Saturday night. And Saturday
[1:25:19] night was one of the latest nights I
[1:25:21] would have at the restaurant. Sometimes
[1:25:23] I wouldn't leave the restaurant till
[1:25:24] midnight trying to make sure everything
[1:25:26] was cleaned up right and everything was
[1:25:28] put away. Then you get home cleaned up,
[1:25:32] wake up the next
[1:25:33] morning, rush everybody
[1:25:36] around. We only had two kids at that
[1:25:38] time, so it's a little bit easier, but
[1:25:41] rush everything around, get to
[1:25:44] church, and then it was you finish
[1:25:46] service, and then it's rush to get
[1:25:48] something to eat, rush to get back. By
[1:25:50] the time evening service is over, it's
[1:25:52] rush home,
[1:25:55] start to put everybody to bed, and the
[1:25:58] day is gone. Yeah.
[1:26:02] And so we made the
[1:26:05] decision that we stopped going to Sunday
[1:26:08] evening
[1:26:10] service because we needed the family
[1:26:13] time.
[1:26:14] I needed that time with my wife and my
[1:26:16] kids. My my kids needed to spend time
[1:26:19] with me. My wife needed me to be there
[1:26:20] to care for her and love her
[1:26:23] and we just needed time together.
[1:26:27] All right. Or at least that's the filter
[1:26:29] that we were looking through.
[1:26:32] I wasn't looking at it as seek ye first
[1:26:35] the kingdom of God. Okay?
[1:26:38] I wasn't looking at it and trusting that
[1:26:40] that God would open up the right doors,
[1:26:42] the right opportunities, or that God
[1:26:43] would allow things to work out. I was
[1:26:45] taking the situation in my own control
[1:26:47] and going, "Well, I can do this to help
[1:26:50] address the situation. I can do this to
[1:26:53] help fix this problem in my life." Yeah.
[1:26:56] And I'm It's not like I'm skipping every
[1:26:59] service. We're still going to the other
[1:27:00] services.
[1:27:03] I'm just giving up Sunday
[1:27:05] night so that I can have time with my
[1:27:08] family.
[1:27:10] Wasn't like I was going out to the bars.
[1:27:13] I wasn't going out to practice my golf
[1:27:15] game. I wasn't going out
[1:27:18] to do hunting or fishing or do whatever.
[1:27:22] I was just trying to spend time with my
[1:27:24] wife and my two young kids.
[1:27:30] Okay? You know, I can look back at it
[1:27:32] now and at the time I didn't even feel
[1:27:35] guilty about it. I didn't feel condemned
[1:27:38] in any way. It was just I'm doing what I
[1:27:41] need to do in this season.
[1:27:48] But yet, I was
[1:27:50] still hitting the 999 out of a thousand
[1:27:55] because I
[1:27:56] wasn't seeking first the kingdom of God.
[1:28:00] I wasn't seeking first to go, "All
[1:28:03] right, Lord, you're most important." And
[1:28:05] Lord, you know, I still have a family to
[1:28:07] raise. You know that these boys still
[1:28:09] need time with me. Lord, you know I
[1:28:11] still have a wife that would like to see
[1:28:13] me around more than me just collapsing
[1:28:16] in bed beside
[1:28:20] her. But instead, I decided that I
[1:28:23] needed to take control, that I needed to
[1:28:25] make the
[1:28:27] decisions. Great. And there's no huge
[1:28:30] moral to the story that I can look back
[1:28:31] and like, my life fell apart. I crashed
[1:28:33] and burned. It was so horrible.
[1:28:37] But I'm at a different state in my walk
[1:28:39] with Christ and in my journey with the
[1:28:40] Lord. And now I can look back at it and
[1:28:43] go, I wasn't fully trusting God the way
[1:28:46] that I should at that point. Okay? I
[1:28:48] wasn't putting him first.
[1:28:52] So if I was putting him
[1:28:53] first, then I would have been willing to
[1:28:56] go to my job and be like, "Hey, I need
[1:28:58] to work less because my family needs
[1:29:01] time with me.
[1:29:03] Now I don't know how I'm going to pay
[1:29:04] the bills when I work less.
[1:29:06] I don't know how I'm going to provide
[1:29:08] everything,
[1:29:10] but I know that they need time.
[1:29:15] I could have gone that route. I could
[1:29:18] have made that decision and I could have
[1:29:20] stepped out on faith and been like,
[1:29:21] "Lord, you know that I need to be at
[1:29:24] church and Lord, you know that my family
[1:29:26] needs me. So Lord, I'm trusting you to
[1:29:30] allow me to get the raise or allow me to
[1:29:33] find a different job or allow me to do
[1:29:36] whatever that will
[1:29:40] provide. But instead, I made the
[1:29:44] decision, well, I've got to have this
[1:29:46] much money, and I'm making it right now,
[1:29:48] just barely. So I can't give up anything
[1:29:50] in work. So that means I can cut one
[1:29:54] church service,
[1:29:58] right? Because it's not that important.
[1:30:04] Cuz I was willing to put it out and
[1:30:07] go there three services. As long as I go
[1:30:10] to two out of
[1:30:11] three, that's good enough.
[1:30:15] As long as I go to two out of
[1:30:20] three, it's okay.
[1:30:26] It's a small decision at the time, small
[1:30:29] decision in that
[1:30:33] moment. But if I had gone the other
[1:30:35] direction, if I had made the stand and I
[1:30:38] had stepped out on faith, I had just
[1:30:42] pulled away from worker a little bit or
[1:30:44] feel like, "Hey, I just need at least
[1:30:45] one of my days to be a half day so I can
[1:30:47] be at home for dinner with my family at
[1:30:49] least one night a week." Or if I had
[1:30:51] done this or I had done that,
[1:30:54] And I had instead modeled before my wife
[1:30:57] and my young kids that God came first
[1:31:00] and that God was most important and that
[1:31:02] I was going to trust God with my family
[1:31:06] and I was going to trust God to
[1:31:09] provide. What kind of
[1:31:11] fruits could I have reaped from sewing
[1:31:15] that? Yeah. What kind of fruits could
[1:31:18] have developed between the relationship
[1:31:21] with me and my wife if she had seen me
[1:31:23] modeling that I'm willing to trust God
[1:31:25] this
[1:31:27] much that I'm not going to step away
[1:31:29] from God. I'm not going to step away
[1:31:31] from attending church. Yeah. But I'm
[1:31:34] willing to step back from work a little
[1:31:36] bit and trust that God will
[1:31:38] somehow make the balance sheet balance.
[1:31:46] We all have those small moments, those
[1:31:49] small decisions. And they don't
[1:31:51] necessarily because we made the wrong
[1:31:53] decision. They don't suddenly by that
[1:31:55] one decision make our world fall
[1:31:58] apart. It doesn't make everything
[1:32:01] suddenly go wrong because we made one
[1:32:06] small decision wrong.
[1:32:08] Yeah.
[1:32:10] But it begins to set up a precedent in
[1:32:12] our heart when we're willing to
[1:32:14] compromise a little bit. When we're
[1:32:16] willing to give up just a little bit.
[1:32:20] Yeah.
[1:32:23] We don't have it the same
[1:32:25] where Eve was willing to give up a
[1:32:28] little bit and it plunged the entire
[1:32:29] world into sin. We don't normally see
[1:32:31] that big an response to our small
[1:32:39] wrong
[1:32:40] decisions. Our small moments where we're
[1:32:43] willing to put something else to the
[1:32:47] top, but yet they still affect us and
[1:32:50] they still follow us down through life.
[1:32:53] Yeah.
[1:32:59] Yeah. In the sermon church
[1:33:03] order in 1966, 1963, brother Random
[1:33:08] says, "And you could have heard a pin
[1:33:10] drop anywhere in that church and
[1:33:12] everybody in prayer for at least 30
[1:33:14] minutes before the first note was ever
[1:33:15] hit on the organ, the prelude." See that
[1:33:17] and just everybody in prayer, I thought
[1:33:19] how wonderful it is. Yeah. that when the
[1:33:21] minister that prelude about I think they
[1:33:23] played one prelude for about three to
[1:33:24] five minutes how great there are or
[1:33:26] something like that on and when they did
[1:33:28] everybody stopped praying and was
[1:33:29] listening to the prelude see they give a
[1:33:31] change from prayer to the prelude and
[1:33:32] when they played that then the choir
[1:33:34] director directed the choir then they
[1:33:36] had congregational song in the choir
[1:33:38] then they were ready for their Sunday
[1:33:40] school class and then when it was over
[1:33:42] there was nothing went on except divine
[1:33:44] worship all the time and that's what we
[1:33:46] come for and I think it would be a good
[1:33:48] thing if if our church and I'm just
[1:33:50] saying this we already we'll do it. See,
[1:33:51] let's do it. If somebody does anything
[1:33:52] and saying that I think it'd be a good
[1:33:54] thing, if it's a good thing, then let's
[1:33:55] do it. See, we don't want to put off any
[1:33:57] good thing. We'll do it anyhow. See, and
[1:33:59] you just go ahead and stand up there and
[1:34:01] if they start on a morning or something
[1:34:03] like that, people to visiting, just let
[1:34:05] someone or one of the deacons or
[1:34:06] somebody walk up there and say, "It's
[1:34:08] been a made a rule in the tabernacle
[1:34:10] here." Yeah.
[1:34:14] Further on in the same sermon, how he
[1:34:16] says, "Now, I'd say this. If your
[1:34:17] service begins at 7:30, if that's the
[1:34:19] time, open your church half an hour
[1:34:21] beforehand,
[1:34:23] 7:00, let one of the deacons, trustees,
[1:34:26] or whoever open the door, janitor, put
[1:34:27] it on up there, the the tape on, and let
[1:34:29] it be playing while the people come.
[1:34:31] See, because if the deacons are not here
[1:34:32] or somebody, let trustee or somebody be
[1:34:34] here to do it. Then let them play for
[1:34:35] half an
[1:34:38] hour. Brother Brandham says in the
[1:34:41] sermon, church order, he says, "This
[1:34:44] would be a good thing to do." And he's
[1:34:46] talking about this church that he had
[1:34:48] visited that everybody was there 30
[1:34:50] minutes early to pray, to prepare for
[1:34:52] the service, to get themselves
[1:34:56] ready. And this is one of those
[1:34:59] things I've heard this talked about my
[1:35:02] entire life in church.
[1:35:05] I have heard min so many ministers talk
[1:35:08] about it. I've heard Well, I grew up
[1:35:11] with a pastor, so I heard my mom and dad
[1:35:12] talk about it obviously, but I've heard
[1:35:14] it talk about
[1:35:16] You get there early to prepare. You get
[1:35:17] there
[1:35:19] early to be in the right atmosphere to
[1:35:22] set yourself up to to be able to enter
[1:35:25] into the
[1:35:27] service so that
[1:35:29] when the minister comes out, everything
[1:35:33] is set up
[1:35:36] right. And yet, how often will we let
[1:35:40] that begin to slide?
[1:35:43] All right. How often will we let that
[1:35:45] slide?
[1:35:47] Especially when we've got small children
[1:35:50] to deal with. I will be the first one to
[1:35:53] say it is not easy getting all the kids
[1:35:55] ready in the morning. It is not easy
[1:35:58] getting everybody dressed and fed and
[1:36:01] out the door. Yeah. To get there on
[1:36:05] time. Yeah.
[1:36:11] And we can look at this and we can go,
[1:36:14] you know, it doesn't say in the Bible we
[1:36:16] have to be there 30 minutes
[1:36:18] early. Brother Brandham didn't like
[1:36:21] preach a whole sermon going, "Thou shalt
[1:36:24] always be at service 30 minutes
[1:36:27] before. This is the rule forever and
[1:36:30] ever."
[1:36:36] But if it's a good thing, then let's do
[1:36:38] it.
[1:36:43] Yeah. Brother Brandham saw this modeled
[1:36:46] in in a church that he visited. It
[1:36:50] wasn't something that wasn't even
[1:36:52] something that he says that he came up
[1:36:54] with on his own. He was like, I was
[1:36:56] visiting this church. It was a big
[1:36:59] church. because he talks about the fact
[1:37:00] that they had multiple services and it
[1:37:02] worked like clockwork of start at this
[1:37:04] time, you had this long, preach this
[1:37:06] service, get everybody out and like 10
[1:37:09] 15 minutes later here comes the next
[1:37:11] congregation for the
[1:37:13] service. And he didn't hold up
[1:37:15] everything as we should model everything
[1:37:17] off of
[1:37:18] this, but he did hold up this one piece
[1:37:22] that hey, we should come early and pray.
[1:37:25] And there should
[1:37:26] be some quiet music praying. There
[1:37:29] should be something
[1:37:31] that's letting everybody know that this
[1:37:33] is the time for us to be in prayer, to
[1:37:37] be setting the atmosphere before the
[1:37:41] worship begins, before we begin singing
[1:37:44] and praising. We're just trying to get
[1:37:47] ourselves quieted, to get ourselves
[1:37:49] calmed, to be in prayer and meditation,
[1:37:51] to get ready for the service.
[1:37:55] And it's so
[1:37:57] easy for us to get busy with life. It's
[1:38:01] so easy for us to get busy with the
[1:38:03] kids. It's so easy for us to be tired
[1:38:06] because I had to work late the night
[1:38:07] before or I had to do this or do that.
[1:38:14] All
[1:38:15] right. And once again, we also know the
[1:38:17] scripture says there are times when the
[1:38:20] ox is in the ditch. You got to get the
[1:38:21] ox out.
[1:38:23] There are things that will happen that
[1:38:25] prevent
[1:38:26] you from being early or maybe even
[1:38:31] making it to church at all. It's going
[1:38:33] to happen. There's life. So, this is not
[1:38:36] one where we now stand here and go, "If
[1:38:38] you're not here 30 minutes early, you're
[1:38:41] lost. If you're not here 30 minutes
[1:38:44] early, you're backslid. Be at the altar
[1:38:47] and repent."
[1:38:51] But if we're seeking God first, if we're
[1:38:55] loving God above all above all others,
[1:38:57] if we're putting him first in our life,
[1:39:00] all right?
[1:39:02] If we have the
[1:39:05] desire, the Holy Spirit in us going,
[1:39:08] "Guess what? The doors are open. I need
[1:39:11] to rush to church to get there.
[1:39:14] I'm not rushing to be
[1:39:16] there just in time or to be there five
[1:39:21] minute or 10 minutes
[1:39:23] late. I want to be there as early as I
[1:39:26] can. I want to be there because I have
[1:39:29] the desire to be in his presence. I have
[1:39:31] the desire to come and worship him. I
[1:39:34] have the desire to come and get
[1:39:37] something from God.
[1:39:39] Right?
[1:39:42] But all too often it's too easy for us
[1:39:44] to get and I know I am meddling so much
[1:39:46] right now. I should preach this
[1:39:48] direction for a little
[1:39:50] while. It is too easy for
[1:39:54] us to get wrapped up and I've got to get
[1:39:58] this done. I've got to get this done. Or
[1:40:00] for the sisters, I've got to finish
[1:40:01] cooking this for lunch
[1:40:04] today. I've got to get this done or get
[1:40:07] this done.
[1:40:09] Yeah.
[1:40:11] And people are going to hate me for
[1:40:13] saying this,
[1:40:14] but it's okay to get up a little
[1:40:16] earlier, too.
[1:40:19] All right.
[1:40:21] It's okay to get up a little earlier to
[1:40:23] make sure the stuff gets done. And that
[1:40:25] doesn't mean that you're not going to
[1:40:26] rush. Yeah. My wife and I get up early
[1:40:29] and we still feel like we're rushing out
[1:40:31] the door to make it here on time for
[1:40:33] Sunday school and to get things done.
[1:40:37] Sure.
[1:40:38] There's still a lot of rushing that
[1:40:40] happens,
[1:40:43] but there's also the desire
[1:40:47] that I want to be here.
[1:40:50] Yeah. And I don't want to be at the
[1:40:52] place in my walk that I was those years
[1:40:55] back where I'm willing to give up that
[1:40:57] time with the Lord. I want don't want to
[1:40:59] be at the place that I was back then
[1:41:01] when I would go, "Well, that's not that
[1:41:04] important." Yeah.
[1:41:06] I don't want to be at the place where
[1:41:07] I'm willing to make the
[1:41:11] decision that even if I'm making the
[1:41:13] decision that it's my family is more
[1:41:15] important that I'm now saying, "Okay,
[1:41:18] Lord, you've got second place or you've
[1:41:20] got third place or you've got fifth
[1:41:22] place or you've
[1:41:25] got that don't in any way think that I
[1:41:28] feel like I've got my life perfect and
[1:41:30] that I have God in first place in every
[1:41:32] single aspect of my life. I know I've
[1:41:35] got plenty of places to work on. I am
[1:41:38] still very much
[1:41:40] a fallen man that has been redeemed.
[1:41:47] But yet we should have that desire.
[1:41:49] Amen. That Lord, I want you to be first.
[1:41:52] I want to be seeking you first. All
[1:41:56] right.
[1:41:59] First Kings chapter
[1:42:06] 17. Starting at verse 8, it says, "And
[1:42:09] the word of the Lord came unto him,
[1:42:10] saying, Arise thee, get thee to
[1:42:12] Zerapath, which belongth to Zidon, and
[1:42:14] dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a
[1:42:16] widow woman there to sustain thee." So
[1:42:18] he arose and went to Zerapath. And when
[1:42:20] he came to the gate of the city, behold,
[1:42:22] the widow woman was there gathering
[1:42:24] sticks. And he called to her and said,
[1:42:26] "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water
[1:42:27] in a vessel that I may drink." And as
[1:42:29] she was going to fetch it, he called to
[1:42:31] her and said, "Bring me, I pray, thee, a
[1:42:33] morsel of bread in thine hand." And she
[1:42:35] said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I
[1:42:37] have not a cake, but a handful of meal
[1:42:39] in a barrel, and a little oil in a
[1:42:41] cruise. And behold, I am gathering two
[1:42:43] sticks that I may go in and dress it for
[1:42:45] me and my son, that we may eat it and
[1:42:47] die." And Elijah said unto him, "Fear
[1:42:50] not. Go and do as thou has said, but
[1:42:52] make me thereof a little cake first, and
[1:42:55] bring it unto me, and after make for
[1:42:56] thee, and for thy son. For thus sayaith
[1:42:59] the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of
[1:43:00] meals shall not waste, neither shall the
[1:43:02] crews of oil fail until the day the Lord
[1:43:05] sendeth rain upon the earth. And she
[1:43:07] went and did according to the saying of
[1:43:09] Elijah. And she and he in her house did
[1:43:11] eat many days, and the barrel of meal
[1:43:14] wasted not, neither did the crews of oil
[1:43:16] fail, according to the word of the Lord,
[1:43:18] which he spoke by Elijah.
[1:43:26] I want you to put yourself in this widow
[1:43:29] woman's shoes for a
[1:43:31] moment. Here she was. She
[1:43:34] was She had resigned herself to the
[1:43:37] point that I'm going to cook what I have
[1:43:40] and then my son and I are going to
[1:43:42] starve to death.
[1:43:46] That's where we're at, right?
[1:43:49] There's no fighting against it. There's
[1:43:50] no struggling. There's this is what I've
[1:43:53] accepted. I'm going to get my two
[1:43:55] sticks. I'm going to build my fire, bake
[1:43:59] my
[1:43:59] cake. We're going to eat one more small
[1:44:05] meal. And that's
[1:44:09] it. And then she meets a man that she
[1:44:11] doesn't
[1:44:12] know. Meets a man she's never seen
[1:44:15] before.
[1:44:18] She's, I'm sure, heard of him, though
[1:44:20] she doesn't realize it
[1:44:23] yet. And he tells her to bring her a
[1:44:25] drink. And so she goes to get some water
[1:44:28] from the well or from whatever they had
[1:44:30] where they could still get some last
[1:44:32] vestigages of
[1:44:34] water. And then he said, "Bring me a
[1:44:39] cake." She says, "I I don't have
[1:44:42] anything. This is what I'm about to do."
[1:44:45] And he says, "Yeah, do what you
[1:44:48] planned. Make you and your son a cake,
[1:44:51] but make me a little one
[1:44:54] first because thus saith the Lord."
[1:45:00] And then she had a decision to
[1:45:03] make. At that
[1:45:06] moment, she had to
[1:45:11] decide. this man that was standing
[1:45:14] before her that was saying, "Thus
[1:45:16] sayaeth the
[1:45:17] Lord." Did she
[1:45:20] believe and was she willing to put God
[1:45:22] first and follow his
[1:45:25] instructions or was she going to go her
[1:45:27] own
[1:45:30] way? This was not an easy decision that
[1:45:34] she was just like, "Oh yeah, fine. Let
[1:45:36] me go make your
[1:45:38] food." The scriptures don't go into it.
[1:45:41] She may have stood there for a
[1:45:43] while arguing back and forth within
[1:45:47] herself, maybe even verbalizing it a
[1:45:49] little bit. The scriptures don't
[1:45:53] say, but she at that
[1:45:56] moment was making the
[1:46:00] decision, do I seek God first and obey
[1:46:03] his
[1:46:04] word? Because in the land of Israel, you
[1:46:07] didn't lightly put out thus saith the
[1:46:09] Lord.
[1:46:11] If you were caught saying, "Thus sayaeth
[1:46:14] the Lord," that wasn't true. You were
[1:46:18] dead. This was not this was not a phrase
[1:46:22] that you bandied around. You did not
[1:46:25] find kids out there playing with each
[1:46:27] other and saying, "Well, thus sayeth the
[1:46:28] Lord, this will happen or this."
[1:46:30] No, this was not a lightweight phrase.
[1:46:35] All right?
[1:46:37] So, the fact that someone was willing to
[1:46:39] utter it immediately put her to a place
[1:46:41] of, "Do I accept
[1:46:44] this? Am I willing to obey God? Am I
[1:46:48] willing to obey the word that's being
[1:46:50] delivered to
[1:46:52] me?"
[1:46:54] Yeah. Or am I going to
[1:46:57] follow what I had already resigned
[1:46:59] myself to, what I had already accepted?
[1:47:02] Yeah. Am I Which one am I going to do?
[1:47:07] Now, we all know this story so well. We
[1:47:10] know what
[1:47:10] happened. Yeah. But take a moment. Put
[1:47:14] yourself in her shoes. This was not The
[1:47:17] scriptures make it so short. It's two
[1:47:20] verses where she's making the decision.
[1:47:22] It's not It doesn't go She had to
[1:47:25] agonize over it for half an
[1:47:29] hour, an hour.
[1:47:34] This would
[1:47:36] not be an easy
[1:47:39] choice. Sister
[1:47:41] Mary, sadly, brother Kobe
[1:47:45] died. He's not in this
[1:47:48] story. It's just you and your kids.
[1:47:52] Yeah. You're going to prepare the last
[1:47:55] of the food. and some stranger you've
[1:47:57] never met just came up and said, "No,
[1:48:00] feed me first because thus sayeth the
[1:48:04] Lord, your food's going to last. It's
[1:48:07] going to multiply. It's going to be
[1:48:08] there forever." Yeah.
[1:48:13] As much as Sister Mary would have faith
[1:48:16] that the Lord's saying
[1:48:19] it, there's still the practical side in
[1:48:22] her mind going, "I have hungry kids.
[1:48:25] that are crying at home. Yeah. And they
[1:48:29] just want a morsel to try to quiet the
[1:48:33] pangs in their stomach. Yeah. They just
[1:48:36] want a
[1:48:38] morsel to try to maybe ease their crying
[1:48:41] for a little bit.
[1:48:44] To give them a little bit of strength to
[1:48:46] move around for a few
[1:48:49] moments. to give them at least the kids
[1:48:52] will have a feeling of hope for a moment
[1:48:54] that they got to eat
[1:48:56] something. And yet this
[1:48:58] stranger is saying, "Feed me
[1:49:03] first." This wasn't a lightweight
[1:49:05] decision. This wasn't an easy moment to
[1:49:08] go, "Yes, Lord. I'll serve you
[1:49:13] first." This wasn't
[1:49:20] This probably didn't even feel to her
[1:49:21] like a small
[1:49:23] decision. This probably felt like the
[1:49:27] monumental live or die if I make the
[1:49:30] wrong
[1:49:31] decision. What if this guy is a scam
[1:49:36] artist? I've just killed my children.
[1:49:42] But if he is telling the
[1:49:45] truth, I may save my
[1:49:48] children. But if he's
[1:49:51] lying, but if he's
[1:49:53] not, but but but back and forth, back
[1:49:56] and forth, these were still human beings
[1:49:58] in the Bible. They still thought like
[1:50:00] this. All
[1:50:04] right, but yet she was willing to make
[1:50:07] the decision to go, I'm going to seek
[1:50:10] God first.
[1:50:13] And I'm going to trust that God sent me
[1:50:15] someone that if they're saying thus
[1:50:17] sayeth the Lord, it's going to happen. I
[1:50:21] don't know
[1:50:22] how. I don't understand
[1:50:25] it, but I'm going to make the decision
[1:50:28] to seek God
[1:50:31] first. Brother Brandham says in the
[1:50:33] sermon, be certain of God. He says, see,
[1:50:35] now here comes a great lesson. But
[1:50:38] Elijah said, bake one first. Oh, what is
[1:50:40] it there? What lesson do we learn? Seek
[1:50:43] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:50:45] righteousness. Bake me one first. And
[1:50:48] she looked. She said, "I wonder who that
[1:50:49] is. There's something about the man that
[1:50:52] seems to be
[1:50:53] different." And he said, "Bake me one
[1:50:56] first and bring it." And she started to
[1:50:58] do what he said. Then she heard that
[1:51:01] comforting word that always comforts.
[1:51:04] For thus sayaeth the Lord, the barrel
[1:51:05] will not be empty, nor the crews run dry
[1:51:08] until the day that God sends rain on the
[1:51:10] earth. What was it? That very dark
[1:51:13] crucial moment when God is always on the
[1:51:16] scene. If you're sure that it's God, if
[1:51:19] you've repented of your sins, if you've
[1:51:21] met God's requirements, then be sure
[1:51:23] that God will keep his promise.
[1:51:26] If men and women can only realize that
[1:51:29] God is obligated to his promise and if
[1:51:32] you've met his requirements, if you've
[1:51:33] confessed your sins, if you've made your
[1:51:35] wrongs right and you've done everything
[1:51:37] that God has required, then hold on to
[1:51:39] God. You got to see daylight. He's got
[1:51:42] to bring it through. Just be certain
[1:51:44] that it's God and he'll take care of the
[1:51:46] rest of it if you're sure that it's God.
[1:51:50] All
[1:51:51] right. And Elijah in the meal offering,
[1:51:54] he
[1:51:55] said, brother Ram preacher said, he
[1:51:57] said, "But make me a little one first."
[1:51:59] Isn't that a Isn't that strange that a
[1:52:01] man would ask a widow woman dying for
[1:52:04] the last bit of meal she had in the
[1:52:05] house with a dying child? God does
[1:52:08] things so strange. Said, "Make me a
[1:52:11] little one
[1:52:13] first." She studied. You know, the Bible
[1:52:16] says that we have entertained strangers.
[1:52:17] We've entertained strangers. They were
[1:52:19] angels not knowing that we were doing.
[1:52:22] She said, "Well," she said, "I'll do
[1:52:23] it." And as she turned, he said, "Oh my,
[1:52:27] there it was. The greatest consolation
[1:52:28] that every believer ever listened to,
[1:52:30] for thus saith the Lord." That's the
[1:52:33] word that she was waiting for. Thus
[1:52:35] sayaith the Lord, the barrel will not go
[1:52:37] empty, neither will the cruise go dry
[1:52:39] until the day that God sends rain on the
[1:52:41] earth. What do we get there? Seek ye
[1:52:45] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:52:47] righteousness. All the other things will
[1:52:48] be added. How do I know, brother
[1:52:51] Brandham? How do I know? The only thing
[1:52:53] I know. Put God first and move on.
[1:52:56] Sacrifice. Mix the oil. Mix the word and
[1:52:59] spirit together. Lay yourself upon the
[1:53:01] cross and say, "Here I am,
[1:53:03] Lord." Put God first in
[1:53:12] everything. 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:53:18] 5. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. Starting
[1:53:21] at verse
[1:53:23] 16 says, "Rejoice
[1:53:26] evermore. Pray without
[1:53:28] ceasing. In everything give thanks, for
[1:53:31] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:53:33] concerning
[1:53:34] you. Quench not the spirit. Despise not
[1:53:39] prophesying. Prove all things. Hold fast
[1:53:41] that which is good. Abstain from all
[1:53:44] appearance of evil. And the very God of
[1:53:46] peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God
[1:53:49] your whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:53:51] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[1:53:53] our Lord Jesus
[1:54:00] Christ. We all find moments
[1:54:03] where we might hit the point of going,
[1:54:05] Lord, I'm not quite sure how to seek you
[1:54:07] first. I know I want to. I know I have
[1:54:11] desire that I want to put you first. I
[1:54:15] want to live for you. I want to serve
[1:54:20] you. Rejoice evermore. Pray without
[1:54:23] ceasing. In everything give thanks, for
[1:54:25] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:54:27] concerning you. Quench not the spirit.
[1:54:29] Despise not
[1:54:31] prophesying. Prove all things. Hold fast
[1:54:34] that which is good. Abstain from all
[1:54:36] appearance of evil. And the very God of
[1:54:39] peace sanctify you holy.
[1:54:43] This short scripture reading in First
[1:54:45] Thessalonians covers a whole lot of it
[1:54:48] and answers a lot of our questions when
[1:54:50] we're not sure what we're supposed to do
[1:54:54] or how we're supposed to handle the
[1:54:56] situation or how we're supposed to make
[1:54:58] the right decision.
[1:55:00] If we even just go the one verse that
[1:55:02] says abstain from all appearance of
[1:55:07] evil, that means you're now going and
[1:55:09] making a decision not even based on the
[1:55:11] fact of whether it's evil or
[1:55:14] not. I'm just making the decision on
[1:55:16] could it look evil if I were to do
[1:55:22] this? Could someone get the wrong idea
[1:55:26] if I were to make this decision? If I
[1:55:29] were to do this
[1:55:31] thing, could someone come to the wrong
[1:55:35] conclusion, then I shouldn't do
[1:55:37] it? If I'm seeking God first, then I'm
[1:55:41] going to abstain from the very
[1:55:42] appearance of
[1:55:44] evil. All
[1:55:47] right? And the thing we have is
[1:55:50] that there are those around us that are
[1:55:53] watching all the time, particularly
[1:55:56] those of us that are parents. We've got
[1:55:57] the little eyes that are keeping an eye
[1:55:59] on us at at all
[1:56:02] moments. I was telling brother Wendle
[1:56:05] this the other day as I've been going
[1:56:07] through this process of finding a new
[1:56:10] job. I had had one job that I got called
[1:56:13] in for an interview for and it was went
[1:56:16] really
[1:56:17] well. They told me at the interview,
[1:56:19] "Hey, we're going to bring you in for a
[1:56:20] second interview." There was no there
[1:56:22] was no uh we'll get back to you and let
[1:56:24] you know. was, "No, we're going to have
[1:56:25] you come back next week. We're going to
[1:56:28] have you come
[1:56:29] in." And it was a job
[1:56:33] that it wasn't necessarily going to pay
[1:56:36] the greatest in the world, but I was be
[1:56:39] providing again. I could always take it
[1:56:42] while I was looking for something else
[1:56:44] to keep going.
[1:56:47] I was be working for a city government
[1:56:50] and one of the responsibilities was
[1:56:52] going and taking minutes and notes at
[1:56:55] city
[1:56:56] meetings. But there was one thing. There
[1:56:58] was one city meeting every month for one
[1:57:01] of the boards or whatever that happened
[1:57:04] on Wednesday night. One Wednesday night
[1:57:06] a month.
[1:57:11] I left that
[1:57:13] interview
[1:57:15] and there was nothing else. I hadn't had
[1:57:19] any other interviews. I hadn't had any
[1:57:20] other calls. I hadn't had any anything
[1:57:23] else. This was
[1:57:29] it.
[1:57:32] And I was kind of going back and forth
[1:57:35] quite a bit.
[1:57:38] It was only one Wednesday night a
[1:57:41] month. It was only one service a month
[1:57:45] that I would have to miss. I could make
[1:57:47] it every other, no
[1:57:50] problem. And hey, maybe if the meeting
[1:57:52] got out early, I could even make it in
[1:57:54] to that one service as well, just get in
[1:57:58] late. But for sure, there'd be months
[1:58:01] where I would miss at least just I would
[1:58:03] miss one
[1:58:07] service. and I had to make the decision
[1:58:09] and I was going back and forth in my
[1:58:12] head, back and forth, back and
[1:58:15] forth. Finally, I decided
[1:58:17] that no, this isn't the route I should
[1:58:21] go. I sent an email and withdrew my
[1:58:24] application because I didn't think it
[1:58:25] was right thing. And so then I went to
[1:58:27] sit down with my kids
[1:58:28] and was going to explain to them, hey,
[1:58:31] I've decided not to take this job and
[1:58:35] this is the reason because it was going
[1:58:36] to mean I was going to miss one service
[1:58:38] a month. And so I I didn't feel right
[1:58:39] doing
[1:58:40] that. And in my head, I'm making this up
[1:58:43] to be, okay, this is going to be a great
[1:58:45] lesson for them. I'm going to be able to
[1:58:47] teach them and model this is how we live
[1:58:49] for God. This is the way we do it. And
[1:58:52] they're going to go, "Dad, you're so
[1:58:54] amazing. think you're so
[1:58:57] wonderful. You know, this is how I have
[1:58:59] it pictured in my
[1:59:01] head. And I start to tell them what's
[1:59:05] going
[1:59:08] on. And I forget which one spoke first.
[1:59:11] Both Luke and Charity spoke. I forget
[1:59:13] which one said it
[1:59:14] first, but they were
[1:59:17] like, "We knew you weren't going to take
[1:59:19] that job,
[1:59:20] Dad. We knew you weren't going to give
[1:59:22] up going to
[1:59:23] church. I was building it up. It's like,
[1:59:25] "Oh, there's gonna be a huge moment
[1:59:27] where I'm teaching them something." And
[1:59:29] they went, "No, we already know that.
[1:59:32] That's old
[1:59:34] news." They didn't know that I was going
[1:59:36] back and forth. They didn't know that I
[1:59:38] had this battle going out of my mind.
[1:59:40] They were sitting there and going, "Oh,
[1:59:42] we know what dad's going to decide."
[1:59:44] Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Because the state
[1:59:49] of my walk with God is
[1:59:51] not what it was those years ago.
[1:59:55] when I was willing to go, hey, I'm not
[1:59:58] going to go to Sunday night service
[2:00:03] anymore. And I've got
[2:00:05] kids that know
[2:00:07] that better than their own dad
[2:00:11] does. That they had already seen that
[2:00:15] this is how we live. This is how we make
[2:00:18] decisions. This is how we handle things.
[2:00:23] Yeah.
[2:00:25] And I may have struggled with the
[2:00:27] decision in my own mind back and forth.
[2:00:30] I may have wrestled with it. It may have
[2:00:33] been hard for
[2:00:34] me to accept that this was the decision
[2:00:37] that I had to make.
[2:00:40] Yeah.
[2:00:45] But yet those around
[2:00:47] me never questioned.
[2:00:51] They were just like, "Oh, I know what
[2:00:53] dad's going to decide. I know what he's
[2:00:56] going to
[2:00:57] do because I know that he's been
[2:01:00] modeling what's important." All
[2:01:03] right? And I know there are plenty of
[2:01:05] areas in my life as a parent where I'm
[2:01:08] making the mistake and I'm
[2:01:10] not modeling it the way that I should. I
[2:01:14] don't stand here trying to go, I'm the
[2:01:16] perfect father. I get it right every
[2:01:17] time.
[2:01:21] But there are
[2:01:23] moments where God likes to come in and
[2:01:25] remind you. He's like, "Hey, you've been
[2:01:27] making the right decision time after
[2:01:30] time after time. Here's some of the
[2:01:32] fruit starting to come out." Sure.
[2:01:35] You've been seeking me first in this
[2:01:38] area of your life. Here's some of the
[2:01:40] fruit starting to come out. Mhm. When we
[2:01:43] look at the young men on the front row
[2:01:46] or the young girls sitting on the front
[2:01:49] row when they're here and you see them
[2:01:51] growing and maturing and having a desire
[2:01:54] to have a relationship with God and
[2:01:56] having a desire to live the way that
[2:01:58] they
[2:02:01] should. You can look at it and
[2:02:04] go,
[2:02:05] "Parents, God's giving you a little
[2:02:07] nudge to go, you've been modeling seek
[2:02:10] first the right way. Sure. Here's some
[2:02:12] of the fruit that's starting to come
[2:02:14] out. Here's some of the results that
[2:02:16] you're starting to get."
[2:02:18] Yes, sir.
[2:02:27] Praise the Lord. Go to James chapter
[2:02:30] 4 as the musicians
[2:02:34] come. James chapter 4 and verse
[2:02:39] 7. Submit yourselves therefore to
[2:02:42] God. Resist the devil and he will flee
[2:02:44] from
[2:02:46] you. Draw nigh to God and he will draw
[2:02:48] nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye
[2:02:51] sinners, and purify your hearts, ye
[2:02:53] dumble minded.
[2:02:59] You know, we'll talk about the
[2:03:00] scripture, the fact that it says,
[2:03:02] "Resist the devil and he will flee from
[2:03:05] you." But it's in the same verse right
[2:03:08] before it says. It says, "Submit
[2:03:10] yourself therefore to
[2:03:12] God." It doesn't say to resist God.
[2:03:15] Resist the devil on your
[2:03:17] own. It says, "Submit yourself to God.
[2:03:21] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[2:03:23] you." If you haven't been submitting to
[2:03:26] God, resisting the devil is not going to
[2:03:27] do a whole lot. Okay. All right. Because
[2:03:31] us standing here in our fleshly bodies,
[2:03:34] we don't have our own strength to go,
[2:03:37] "All right, Satan, I can beat you in an
[2:03:39] arm wrestling competition. I can I can
[2:03:43] out talk you. I can out reason you. I
[2:03:45] can out whatever." Yeah. But it's when
[2:03:48] we make the decision, submit yourselves
[2:03:50] to God.
[2:03:55] Seek ye first the kingdom of
[2:03:58] God. Love the Lord thy God above all
[2:04:04] else. When you've taken those
[2:04:07] steps and you go and resist the
[2:04:13] devil, the Lord's there standing beside
[2:04:16] you. The Lord's
[2:04:18] there to fight the fight for you. And
[2:04:22] the devil has to
[2:04:24] flee. Brother Random says in the sermon,
[2:04:26] "Lord, show us the father and it
[2:04:28] sufficeth." He says, "Don't ever worry.
[2:04:31] If God sends you, you just go ahead."
[2:04:33] See, God will take care of the rest of
[2:04:35] it. Isn't that wonderful? Seek ye first
[2:04:38] the kingdom of God and his
[2:04:40] righteousness. All other things will be
[2:04:41] added. Just don't have to worry. God has
[2:04:46] everything.
[2:04:47] Praise the Lord. Doesn't matter what
[2:04:50] situation we find ourselves
[2:04:52] in. Doesn't matter what trial we're
[2:04:55] going through. It doesn't matter what
[2:04:57] struggle we're
[2:04:59] facing. Everyone here knows what I've
[2:05:02] been going through looking for a job and
[2:05:04] different things. Everyone knows I
[2:05:06] haven't been private about it, keeping
[2:05:08] it. And so, obviously, that's one of the
[2:05:10] things that's made me look this
[2:05:11] direction and pay attention to what the
[2:05:14] Lord's saying in this. But this doesn't
[2:05:16] just apply to if you're out of work or
[2:05:19] if you don't have
[2:05:21] finances. This applies to every area of
[2:05:24] our lives as we're going through. If we
[2:05:27] seek God first, if we put him first, if
[2:05:29] we put him as our
[2:05:31] priority, then he'll supply the rest.
[2:05:35] He'll take care of the
[2:05:36] rest. If we submit ourselves to
[2:05:40] God, we can resist the devil and he will
[2:05:43] flee.
[2:05:47] God calls us to not be like the world
[2:05:50] and be willing to accept the 99 out of a
[2:05:53] 100red or the 999 out of a thousand or
[2:05:58] whatever. We're not called to be willing
[2:06:00] to accept if I just miss one out of
[2:06:02] whatever, I'm still okay.
[2:06:06] God has called his bride to be in the
[2:06:09] same mindset as what he had placed in
[2:06:11] his prophet where if this is what the
[2:06:13] word
[2:06:14] says, this is what I do. If this is what
[2:06:18] the prophet preached, then this is how I
[2:06:22] [Music]
[2:06:25] live. This
[2:06:29] isn't lightweight. It
[2:06:32] isn't all about the big decisions. It's
[2:06:34] these small decisions, these small
[2:06:36] moments we make time after time where we
[2:06:38] are making the
[2:06:40] decision. Am I going to seek God
[2:06:44] first? Am I willing to put God above all
[2:06:49] else? Or am I asking
[2:06:53] God to take second, third, or fourth or
[2:06:56] fifth place? Right?
[2:07:01] Everything we face in life, every
[2:07:04] decision comes to that same place. Am I
[2:07:08] seeking God
[2:07:10] first? That's the filter that we have to
[2:07:13] use. That's the filter we have to look
[2:07:15] at
[2:07:16] is are we seeking God first? Are we
[2:07:18] loving him above all
[2:07:23] else? I know this
[2:07:26] wasn't an exciting sermon. This wasn't
[2:07:28] one that makes everybody jump out of
[2:07:31] their seats. It doesn't make everyone
[2:07:33] want to run the
[2:07:35] aisles. But it's a moment for
[2:07:38] you to reflect. It's a moment for you to
[2:07:41] as you're in your pew to think about
[2:07:45] your life, to think about the decisions
[2:07:47] that you've been making, to think about
[2:07:49] the path that you've been
[2:07:51] walking and go, am
[2:07:57] I am I putting God
[2:08:07] first? Am I seeking him first? Am I
[2:08:10] loving him above above all
[2:08:13] others? Let's bow our
[2:08:15] heads. Lord Jesus, we come into your
[2:08:17] presence again this evening, Lord.
[2:08:21] And Lord, I pray that you would help
[2:08:23] each one of us to do our own checkup on
[2:08:25] our lives, Lord.
[2:08:31] Lord, I thank you
[2:08:33] for the areas of our lives in the
[2:08:36] moments where
[2:08:37] you encourage us, Lord. Where you let us
[2:08:40] see the fruit because we've been making
[2:08:43] the right decisions, Lord. Because we've
[2:08:45] been seeking you first, because we've
[2:08:47] been putting you in first
[2:08:50] place. But Lord, I pray that you would
[2:08:52] also help us to examine the other parts
[2:08:55] of our lives, Lord. that you would help
[2:08:56] us to
[2:08:57] examine the other areas, Lord, to find
[2:09:00] those weak places where we've asked you
[2:09:02] to accept a fourth or a fifth
[2:09:06] or maybe a closed off closet that we
[2:09:10] haven't even allowed you to come in at
[2:09:14] all. Lord, I pray that you
[2:09:17] would forgive us of the areas, Lord,
[2:09:20] where we've allowed you to sit in our
[2:09:23] lives with dirty feet, Lord.
[2:09:25] where we've made you sit there because
[2:09:27] we valued something else more than you,
[2:09:30] Lord, because we placed something else
[2:09:32] in a higher
[2:09:35] position. Lord, forgive us of of those
[2:09:38] places, Lord. Lord, help us
[2:09:42] to help us to love you the way that we
[2:09:45] should, Lord. Help us to seek after you
[2:09:48] the way that we should, Lord. Help us to
[2:09:49] to put you as the most important
[2:09:53] thing, not to allow ourselves
[2:09:57] to to slide and think that we're doing
[2:10:00] well like Saul did.
[2:10:05] But Lord, help us to be like like that
[2:10:09] widow woman, Lord, that was willing to
[2:10:10] give up everything that she had, that
[2:10:13] was willing to give up the food that she
[2:10:16] was going to put in her children's
[2:10:18] belly because you had commanded it,
[2:10:20] because you had asked for
[2:10:26] it. Lord, I thank you for your love.
[2:10:28] Lord, I thank you for your forgiveness
[2:10:30] and your grace,
[2:10:32] Lord, for all the times that we do fall
[2:10:36] short. For all the times that we do make
[2:10:38] the wrong decisions. For all the times
[2:10:40] that we do put you in the corner, Lord.
[2:10:43] Yes.
[2:10:46] Lord, I pray that you
[2:10:47] would be in our praise, Lord. Be in the
[2:10:51] remaining time that we have here, Lord.
[2:10:54] May you just continue to min continue to
[2:10:56] minister to our hearts, Lord.
[2:10:59] Lord, draw us a little closer to
[2:11:02] you. We just love you. We thank
[2:11:07] you
[2:11:10] fully. Seek ye first the
[2:11:16] kingom of
[2:11:19] God and his rightousness.
[2:11:28] And all these things shall be
[2:11:33] added to
[2:11:36] you.
[2:11:39] Hallelu. Hallelujah.
[2:11:45] Oh, seek ye
[2:11:48] first the kingom of
[2:11:53] God and his
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:01] rightousness and all these things shall
[2:12:06] be added up to
[2:12:10] you. Hallelujah.
[2:12:15] Hallelujah. The second one.
[2:12:18] Old man shall not live by
[2:12:23] bread
[2:12:26] alone, but by
[2:12:30] every
[2:12:34] word that
[2:12:37] proceeds from the mouth of
[2:12:42] God.
[2:12:45] Hallelu. Hallelujah.
[2:12:49] Seek ye
[2:12:50] first and seek ye
[2:12:54] first the

[2:13:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:57] Amen. Your heart's desire tonight.
[2:14:01] you know,
[2:14:03] um
[2:14:05] it it is a very
[2:14:09] uh compelling thought because we really
[2:14:11] do it's just it's a must that we
[2:14:15] put that we put God
[2:14:18] first and
[2:14:20] um it is we've it just you know you you
[2:14:24] just oh you go so much you don't have
[2:14:27] time there's just so many things today
[2:14:31] to to take your
[2:14:33] time and he takes our time in prayer. We
[2:14:38] we just we lose so much and and and
[2:14:44] again all it does is is takes takes away
[2:14:48] our power, takes away our takes away the
[2:14:53] anointing. And
[2:14:56] um I believe God's word should be our
[2:14:59] absolute on
[2:15:01] everything. We we need God's word. And
[2:15:05] so, uh, we're all in different stages of
[2:15:09] our walk with God, different seasons. It
[2:15:11] but it doesn't matter, you know, as I
[2:15:13] was saying, I believe Wednesday night,
[2:15:15] whether you're, uh, a boy, girl, man,
[2:15:19] woman, husband, wife, minister, whatever
[2:15:22] you are, we want the word of God. We
[2:15:25] want to apply that word to our lives. No
[2:15:28] matter what it is, if you're a wife, if
[2:15:30] you're a husband, or if you're a
[2:15:32] preacher, the script, there are
[2:15:34] scriptures for every one of us. And and
[2:15:39] it it's easy sometimes to uh say, "Well,
[2:15:42] my wife needs that or uh well, my
[2:15:45] children need to hear that." Or, you
[2:15:48] know, it's easy for us. But we need to
[2:15:52] look in the in at the word for our own
[2:15:54] lives and say, "Lord, am I pleasing you?
[2:15:57] Am I walking with you? Am, Lord, I want
[2:16:01] you to clean me up. Clean me up." Amen.
[2:16:05] God still sanctifies today. Amen. You
[2:16:09] say, "Well, I've received the Holy
[2:16:10] Ghost, so I I'm past sanctification."
[2:16:12] No. No. We need We need sanctification.
[2:16:16] We need a sanctifier. Do we backslide
[2:16:19] daily? And we need to recognize that we
[2:16:22] need the presence of the Lord. And so I
[2:16:26] think this message is tonight was is
[2:16:28] pertinent for for this day. And Lord,
[2:16:31] help me help me to make this my my all.
[2:16:36] Let let I want your word to be
[2:16:38] everything to me. Amen. Is that your
[2:16:41] heart's desire here tonight? Amen.
[2:16:45] Hallelujah.
[2:16:47] Amen. That we we want him to take all of
[2:16:51] us, not just portion of us, but all of
[2:16:55] us.
