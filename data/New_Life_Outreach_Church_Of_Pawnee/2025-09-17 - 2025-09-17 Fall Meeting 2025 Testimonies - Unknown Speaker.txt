And so we um we're we're just wanting to take the the service tonight and and uh have a few testimonies and songs. And so if you've got u some testimonies, um I know I uh I know we're not we don't just have a a huge crowd tonight, but uh but but we're blessed to be here. And so, uh, if you've got some testimonies or songs that you want to leave, uh, and what we're going to do tonight, we're just going to open up in prayer and I'm going to read a scripture and, um, maybe comment just a just a few moments and then I'm just going to turn the service to brother Kobe and um, and then we'll uh, just open it up however he feels to do it. And but why don't we just go to the Lord in prayer and um uh there uh what what do we have um let's see I brother um brother Andrew Glover text me today and um uh little Malachi got tripped up while playing ball and and broke his leg. And um so when you look at the picture, he's got he's got one leg, whole leg in a in a cast and then the other leg he's got is going halfway down in a cast. And so I don't understand the whole uh deal, but it and then a diaper look like a diaper on top of that cast. So um you know, so let's just pray for for little Malachi. My goodness. And um and then we also want to keep um Oh yes. And then there was also u a request an urgent request uh from sister Heather, brother Shaun's wife. And uh uh Faith and Anne works um works for these people. He said, "If y'all wouldn't mind keeping my manager in prayer," and this is actually the girls's manager. She is 37 weeks pregnant, has just been informed that her baby doesn't have lungs, kidneys, and gallbladder. The doctors told her the baby will die soon after birth. Uh Beth is in her early 30s, hasn't been able to have any children due to several miscarriages, and this is the first baby she's been able to carry to full term. So, let's We don't know, you know, the these people don't go to their church, but uh let's let's pray. My goodness, I I I just I wouldn't just wouldn't know how to feel, you know, uh if that was my baby. And then u we also want to pray for brother Steve Martin that um the Lord will just continue to pray for him that the Lord will intervene in his on his behalf. I am actually Fresa and I are are heading up there tomorrow and uh we're going to go spend some time with brother Steve and and um he hasn't been able to get out of bed in in a long time and and um so y'all be praying with us as well that when we go that the Lord will just give us a special this right words to encourage brother Steve and and um and and also that the Lord would just raise him up and raise him off that out out of that bed, multiple cerosis. He's he's he's fought it a long time and and and uh the Lord has given him grace, but I believe I believe God's grace is still uh uh prevalent today. Um and then another brother brother Mike and sister Denise's uh car truck broke down again. And so I want us to just pray that God will will bless them um bless them with a good good vehicle that that uh is not going to be breaking down on them. And so there there are needs, you know, God's come among us, but uh and and we're so thankful and um but there's always going to be needs in the world until Jesus comes. But the God that was with us during that meeting is the God that that is still going to be answering prayers tonight. So why don't we go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we just thank you for for life. Thank you for your blessings. Thank you, Lord, for this wonderful meeting that you've given us. And Lord, we we're just going to come to Lord, as as as the one from the 10 lepers, we came we're coming back tonight to give you thanks, to let you know how much we appreciate you coming among us. Lord, we ask that that you would just accept the praises from our hearts, Lord. You see these needs that we have we have brought before you, Lord. And we're asking, God, that you would that you would be with this lady, Lord, who's carrying this child. Lord, you're a miracle worker. Lord, if if you can perform miracles, if we as we have experienced this last week, we know that you can do that for them, for this lady here, Lord. And Father, we're asking that you would do a miracle on that child. Lord, that you would make it perfectly whole. God, I I pray, Lord, that you would be with Brother Mike and Sister Denise. And Lord, that you will bring victory for them. Lord, I know it's a trying time, Lord. Satan's hitting them in every way, but Lord, they're warriors. They're sons and daughters, and they're son and daughter, and there we're none of us are are we don't have give up in us, Lord. And I'm asking, Lord, that you would, we're just looking to you for miracles in several instances in their lives. Lord, thank you for what you're doing for Brother Steve. Lord, we're believing he's going to be up and be behind the pull pit preaching again, Lord. And we're just asking, Father, that you would renew his strength in his body and that you would heal him, Lord, and renew him in his spirit, Father. Lord, we just thank you for all things. just ask that your blessings would be upon this service here tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen and amen? God bless you. Let's let's look here at at Psalms the And you can just keep on playing. We're not we're I won't be very long here. Amen. Uh there in Psalms 1 and 115. Praise the Lord. They um they uh this is a scripture that brother had read the other night and I'm just going to read it again. 115 and1 not unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where now, where is now their God? But our God is in the heaven. He hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's h hands. They have mouths, but they do not speak. Eyes have they, but they see not. They have ears, but they hear not. Noses have they, but they smell not. They have hands, but they handle not. Feet have they, but they walk not, neither speak they through their throat. They that make them are like unto them. So is everyone that trusteth in them. Oh Israel, trust thou in the Lord. He is their help and their uh shield. Oh house of Aaron, trust in the Lord. He is their help and their shield. Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord. He is their help and their shield. The Lord has been mindful of us. And he will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron. He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great. The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children. You are blessed of the Lord, which made heaven and earth, the heaven and even the heavens of heavens are the Lords, but the earth he has given to the children of men. The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence, but he will bless the Lord from But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and forever more. Praise the Lord. God bless you. You can be seated here this evening. And I think that should be our attitude is to give blessings unto the Lord. you know, we um I think we have a lot to be thankful for and um he's always been so good. And I've thought about the word, the word that was so rich as it has come uh forth. How many enjoyed the messages during this last week? [Applause] And it's so good to see young men that that's got such fervor for this message. And um it it gives it gives a lot of a a lot of um courage to to to just you know as I'm getting older now you know dad used to look at me and say you know you're you're you're the next generation. Give it all you've got. Make sure it counts and and uh uh don't deviate. And then now that I'm getting a little bit older and I I've uh I' I've I see the young men in our church that are preaching and the young men that preached in the meeting and and to see the ferveny and and and to to get it right and to uh preach the message, it's a blessing. And and uh there were some of us texting a little bit today sharing quotes and and here's just a few of them. Brother, I I believe it was brother William that that shared this. Um or maybe this was uh Brother Sam. Um brother Sam or brother William sent this. We were sending some some text today. Says, "I love the word." Uh this is the prophet. The Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God. Christians should always read the Bible for the Holy Spirit feeds. Its food is the word of God. Man shall not live by bread alone. Amen. There it is. But by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. That's what Christians live on. The word. The Holy Spirit loves the word. And he is here tonight to receive the word. It's in you. As the word comes forth and the Holy Spirit takes the word of God and reveals it to you. Isn't that powerful? Amen. And I I sent this one here out of indictment. It says, "And that's what he is only a reflection of the word." Talking of Jesus. That's what he is today. A reflection of the word trying to find somebody to reflect himself through. Go on down. Jesus Christ was the person, the man, God. Hallelujah. He was the manifestation of God. He was God in a body form to reflect the word for that age to make that age see God's promise for that word. Amen. So Jesus was to he was the body form of God to make the age see the promise for the age. And the Holy Ghost is the same today. It's the spirit of God upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this age to prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. St. John 14:12, the works that I do shall you do also. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, constantly trying to find and to reflect itself. Can you say amen? Amen. So uh we we are so we are thankful for that today. Amen. That God himself all we have to do is believe the word and if he can find believers find believers the Holy Spirit is right there to uncction it to make it real to make it come off the pages and to make it live. And I say this week God has made those words to come off the pages. It comes through the anointing of his Holy Spirit. Amen. Aren't you glad for that? Amen. Amen. Here's a another one. You say there's nothing impossible with God. Do you believe that? Then there's nothing impossible with you either. Amen. Nothing impossible. Another one. You're an offspring of God. God is in you. He will believe his own word though it can't be seen, felt, taste, or anything. you'll believe it. See, I see what I mean. For in for God in you believes his own word. So, as we as we look at these at these um these quotes and we can see day by day these scriptures are coming to pass. These quotes are coming to pass and it makes me thankful that I'm a believer. Amen. So, I want I I'm I'm I'm asking uh I I'd like to just hear from as many of you as as uh as possible and feel free to sing. I'm going to give it to Brother Kobe and uh Brother Kobe will will lead us in in uh in praise and testimonies, what whatever what whatever um I I just I just want it to be an informal evening of of uh praise and thanksgiving to the Lord.

[Music] For he has done great things. For he has done great things. Oh, bless his hol. Bless his holy, his holy name. [Music] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Good evening. So, I have a bit of a praise report uh concerning my grandpa. We've been praying for him because we thought he had a stroke uh recently and that his health had declined very rapidly, but it just kind of hit me a little bit differently than it normally would. But I started praying about it and having you guys pray about it. And during the meetings, I just asked God to just help him just in any way he can and to help me with my sincerity. And we just got report back that my grandpa's stroke was really an infection that is going to be healed and he's going to be fully recovered here pretty soon. He's still he still has dementia, but that's just one step closer. And I believe God can do anything. Well, I searched the world, but it couldn't fill me. &gt;&gt; And all man's empty praise. Treasures that fade are never enough. But you came along. You put me back together. And now every desire is now satisfied here in your love. There's nothing better than you. Oh, there's nothing better than you. There's nothing better than you. &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid. to show you my weakness. &gt;&gt; All my failures and flaws, you've seen them all and you still call me friend. Cuz the God of the mountain is a God of the valley. And there's not a place your mercy and grace won't find me again. Cuz there's nothing better than you. There's nothing [Music] better than you. There's nothing nothing is better than you. Cuz there's nothing better than you. There's nothing better than you. There's nothing [Music] nothing is better than you. [Music] You turn mourning to dancing. &gt;&gt; You'd give beauty for ashes. You turn shame into glory. You're the only one who can. &gt;&gt; You turn graves into gardens. &gt;&gt; You turn bones into armies. &gt;&gt; You turn seas into highways. &gt;&gt; You're the only one who can. You turn morning to dancing. You give beauty for ashes. &gt;&gt; You turn shame into glory. You're the only one who can. You're the only one who can. [Music] There's nothing better. There's nothing better than you. There's nothing nothing better than you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing better than you. There's nothing better than you. There's nothing nothing is better than you. [Music] Oh, there's nothing better than you. There's nothing better than you. Oh, there's nothing nothing is better than you. You turn mourning to dancing. You give beauty for ashes. You turn shame into glory. You're the only one who can. &gt;&gt; You turn graves into gardens. You turn bones into armies. You turn seas into highways. You're the only one who can. You're the only one who can. You're the only one who can. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad. He gives beauty for ashes. Amen. &gt;&gt; He gives joy for mourning. My, what a God we serve. How can we not praise a God like that? My goodness. Amen. Takes our worst times and difficult times and just turns it into something great. Amen. Can we sing that song as we open the floor back up? Can we go down a key? It's your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise. It's your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise to you, oh it's your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise at your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise to you, oh [Music] great are you, Lord. It's your breath. Oh, it's your breath in our lungs. We pour out our praise. It's your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise to you, holy. Great are you, Lord. As they continue to play that softly here tonight, I'd like to All right, Brother Josh, you're all you're ready to go. Amen. How many appreciates Brother Josh? Amen. Yes, sir. God bless you now. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought the meetings were just tremendous, the the services, the the food especially um from the start of the meeting to the end. Brother Matthew preaching on accepting his call, you know, and I thought it was amazing how each service is built on top of each other. &gt;&gt; One thing that really I guess stood the most to me was brother Zachary's story on the pig. I'm sure everybody remember that and that stuck with everybody on and he was explaining to in the office how that he what he normally does with the when he's preaching to the younger children he says I wouldn't do it I wouldn't get in there with the pig but if it was a human in there said it's completely different I'm willing to get dirty you know and God was willing to get dirty and that just really just registered even as a minister and adult now even something so simple that even when we were you you know, running away from the things of the Lord. He was still calling on our lives and willing to get dirty in order for us to come to our fulfillment that God has for us. And that was something that really stood out to me. And so, I want to sing this little song here. It's a Polar song, but I hope it's it's a simple song, but I hope it's a blessing to you tonight. I was there when you drew the breath of life. I could hear your voice the first time that you cried. And though you couldn't see me, I was very near. And there's something now I want you to hear. You'll always be my child in my eyes. When you need some love, my arms are open wide. And even when you're growing old, I hope you realize you'll always be my child in my eyes. I was there the first time that you prayed. I could hear all the promises you made. And then when you fell before me, crying, "Father, I have sinned." I picked you up and held you close again. You'll always be my child in my eyes. When you need some love, my arms are open wide. And when growing old, I hope you realize you'll always be my child in my eyes. I was there the first time that you prayed. &gt;&gt; I could hear all the promises you made. And when you fell before me, crying, "Father, I have sinned." I picked you up and held you close again. Yes. &gt;&gt; You'll always be my child in my eyes. When you need some love, my arms are open wide. And even though you're growing old, I hope you realize you'll always be my child in my eyes. [Music] You'll always be my child in my eyes. &gt;&gt; When you need some love, my arms are open wide. And even though you're growing old, I hope you realize you'll always be my child in my eyes. You'll always be my child in my eyes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. You enjoy that here tonight. Amen. Amen. As we get ready to open the floor up again, can we sing that? Let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich. Let the blind say I can see. It's what the Lord has done. Can we sing that again? Let the weak, let the weak say, &gt;&gt; oh might. And let the poor say I am rich. Let the blind say, "I can see what the Lord has done for me." Hosana. Hosana. Hosana to the lamb that was slain. Hosana. Hosana. [Music] Jesus died. As we sing this, whoever wants to bring their special, go ahead and come up into the river or testimony. I will wait there. My sins are washed away from the heavens. Mercy streams of the Savior's love for me. Can we do that last verse? Now rise from waters deep into the saving arms of God. I will sing salvation songs. Jesus Christ that set me free. Oh hana [Music] hosana to the lamb that was slain. Hosana Jesus died and ro one more time. Hosanana, hosana to the lamb that was slain. Hosanana, hosana. Jesus died and rose again. Thank you, Lord. God bless you now. The meetings were awesome. All all the services were just a &gt;&gt; total blessing. I appreciate everyone who had a part in it. Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; From the dust of the earth, God created man. His breath, made man a living soul. [Music] And God so loved the world, he gave his only son. And that is why I love him so. I was born in his likeness, created in his image. I was born to serve the Lord and I can't deny him. I'll always walk beside him. For I was born to serve the Lord. [Music] My hands were made to help my neighbor. My eyes were made to read God's word. My feet were made to walk in his footsteps. My body is the temple of the Lord. I was born in his likeness, created in his image. I was born to serve the Lord and I can't deny him. I'll always walk beside him. For I was born to serve the Lord. My hands were made to help my neighbor. My eyes were made to read God's word. My feet were made to walk in his first steps. My body is a temple for the Lord. [Music] I was born in his likeness, created in his image. I was born to serve the Lord and I can't deny him. I'll always walk beside him. For I was born to serve the Lord. [Music] Yes, I was born to serve the Lord. [Applause] Amen. That's what we were put on this earth to do. Amen. Can we stand to our feet here tonight and let you guys stretch out a little bit. Don't want you sitting too long and falling asleep. Amen. Can we sing this song? I Brother Ben, I heard brother Ben do it at camp. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. And I believe it's in in G if I'm not mistaken. You guys have to help me start this song. I couldn't start it last time. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. Oh wonder. Sing that again now. Oh, the love of Jesus is so wonderful. The love of Jesus is so wonderful. Oh, the love of Jesus is so wonderful. Oh, wonderful.

[Music] around it. Oh, wonderful love. What a love. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. What a love. God bless you, Sister Angie. I heard you're singing tonight. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; God bless her. Well, Caleb, I was so hoping you would sing that song tonight. That's been the song I've been singing all week. That's the theme of the meetings to me is he turns morning into dancing. &gt;&gt; If I could just paint a little background of the picture to tie this together, it would still not do justice of what I'm about to tell you. Right after our meetings three years ago on September 15th, my life turned into a living hell. During this time, I've often felt like Job as I watched my life shatter and seemingly disappear right before my eyes. With great losses, no income, surgery, sicknesses, and many trials beyond what I could fathom. The shepherd was leading me into the darkest valley I've ever been in. But little did I know the amount of trust in God I would truly gain and only one set of footprints would be seen for miles and they certainly would not be mine. I can't even begin to tell you how many times a supernatural has taken place and how many times God provided when it looked impossible. Recently when brother Wendle encouraged us to do the Bible in a year app and then brother George came I told him that was awesome and he preached the same thing brother Wendell did. He said did you get the message? I said yes I believe I did. And from that time on I have taken it seriously. My studies have been lining up countless times with the sermons preached leading up to the meetings. I've been studying the promises and faith of Abraham, the keys to the kingdom. He's in the boat. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, asking big and expecting, thanking him for it in advance. My scripture, the Lord, the Lord spoke to me that I read every day. Jeremiah 29:11. One service when Caleb Farweather was singing, "Your cries have awoken the master. A revelation struck me that God has heard every prayer and truly my cries were awakening the master. It was becoming more real to me and I was in great expectation for these meetings. I knew he was going to do something special for me. To be honest, it was all such a blur, but to whether I heard it on tape, in my scripture reading, or if it was preached during the meetings, because all of it that I'd been studying, including, sorry, Jeremiah 29:11 had been preached multiple times throughout the meetings, and it all just meshed together. Satan told me ahead of time, I'm going to give you a bloody nose in the prayer line and it will just mess it up and you can't go all the through all the way through. You'll have to step out and you won't get your prayers answered. Well, sure enough, as the prayer line began, my nose started pouring blood. As I was in the back in the as I was back in the bathroom, I said to myself, he is not going to keep me out of there. So, I shoved another Kleenex up my nose, kept my hand over over and went back in the sanctuary to show him I meant business. This year was different. I had a sturdier faith and I said, "I'm going to go through that prayer line different this time. I'm going up expecting and thanking him in advance." I made a list of things I was asking for before I went in. And I told myself, I'm not going to think of the problems when I go through. I'm going to focus on thanking him for the answers. As brother Ronnie was preparing for the line prayer line, he said, "This time, let's do it different. Let's make a list and tell him what we need and then go through thanking him for it." Wow. Confirmation. [Music] Sunday. Sunday, I woke up early in the morning and played my Bible in a year app. The past few studies have been on suffering and about Job. Then I turned brother Brandham on and he also talked of Job and his sufferings. When I got to church, Brother Wendell said, "The meetings aren't over yet. We've got one more service and there's more." I'm telling you, when Brother Matthew spoke, it wasn't just a man preaching a sermon. It was deity in flesh. Thus sayaith the Lord speaking directly to me. as he preached, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, thou mighty man of valor, you're a son of God." I said, "Yes, that's me." Satan said, "Oh, that can't be you." He said, "You're a son of God." So, he's just talking to the men. But then, Brother Matthew turned my direction, locked eyes with mine, but it wasn't his eyes. It was like I was looking into the eyes of Christ. There was a light in them. And he said, "You're a daughter of God." Something overshadowed and lingered around me. As he then spoke of my exact problems right down to a broken marriage, you've been sick for 10 years. Your car troubles, your finances, too specific that I could not doubt it was directly to me. And then he said, he's turned your mourning to dancing. and something struck my body and my legs began to quiver and my feet were bouncing and I wanted to take off running around the building. Right then and there, God totally delivered me of a slave mentality that has was embred deep within me due to many past years of spiritual trauma of man's ideas. I know my cries have awoken the master. He promised me an expected end. I asked God for big things and now I rest and wait for them to manifest. I can tell you with a steadfast faith and sincere heart that though God slay me yet I will trust him. And just like Job, God is going to restore everything and then some, he is faithful. &gt;&gt; You really just don't know like I know what he's done for me. And this is only the beginning of my story. I also want to say thank you, brother Windle. You did it right. I know it's not been easy. You've had to hear me cry. You've had to pick me up. You've had to spank me. But you never babyed and cuddled me. But you've always been there for me. You always directed me to the word. And you let the Lord do the work. How blessed we are to have a spiritfilled pastor preaching only the true word of God. Thank you for the burden for the meetings and for your people. We are truly blessed and I am very thankful. [Applause] Amen. Did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Caleb. Amen. I wish Brother Isaac was here tonight. I I tell you, I love that song. Praise him in advance, man. &gt;&gt; Love to hear that again. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um I really enjoyed the meetings and I left refreshed, you know, closer to God. Um, I really particularly enjoyed the whole pig scenario as well because I can relate to the pig. &gt;&gt; You know, I was down in a spot where where nobody else could help me out, &gt;&gt; only God, you know. So, &gt;&gt; could you put the words up to goodness of God? [Music] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me, &gt;&gt; all my days I've been held in your hands. [Music] From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. Cuz all my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good [Music] with every breath that I am able. I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In the darkest nights, you are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend and I have lived in the goodness of God. [Music] Cuz all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath I am able. I will sing of the goodness of God. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. With my life laid down, I surrender now. I give you everything. [Applause] Your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Cuz all my life you have been faithful. Oh, and all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. Sing that again. Cuz all my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. [Applause] [Music] There we go. My fault. Amen. We can all sing of his goodness. Amen. Can we sing this song as we continue to to uh open the floor? I've enjoyed all the testimonies and specials tonight. It's been good. Appreciate everyone's participation. Um, can we go to F? Let's see this. Oh, morning. I see you in the sunrise every morning. It's like a picture that you painted for me. A love letter in the sky. Oh, story. I could have had a really different story. You came down from heaven to restore me. God, help me sing it. Forever change my life. Nobody loves me like he loves me. Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus. I stand in all of your amazing ways. I worship you as long as I am breathing. God, you are faithful and true. Nobody loves me like you. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I love this. Oh, mountains. &gt;&gt; You're breaking down the weight of every mountain. Even when it feels like I'm surrounded, he promised you never leave my side. [Music] &gt;&gt; Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus. Oh my, I stand in all of your amazing ways. I worship you as long as I am breathing. God, you are faithful and true. Nobody loves me like you. &gt;&gt; Sing it now. Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus. Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I stand in all stand in all of your Amazing waves. I worship you as long as I am breathing. &gt;&gt; God, you are faithful and true. Nobody loves me like you. &gt;&gt; As they continue to play that softly now, just Amen. I've done it again. Sister Bree's already ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless her here tonight. I'm going to try to do this without crying like I always do. Um, going into the meeting, I'm going to read off my phone because I will forget everything I wanted to say. But going into the meetings, a million things were on my mind. My family especially has weighed heavily the most. But the window knows throughout the years I have come up many times praying for my family or just text them randomly asking for prayer. As you all know, my uncle Jason committed suicide a few weeks before the meetings. Uncle Jason was the uncle that I've been closest to my whole life. He was the one that was the most involved with me specifically and he was truly a second father to me. Losing him felt like a direct attack from the devil because I had just felt like I had gained my strength after my parents moving away. We had a peace that he had made his life right before his mental illness took over. I felt closure, but the bitterness of yet again feeling like everyone I've ever loved growing up is taken from me seemed to surface a little bit more. This is not a bragging thing to say. Instead, I say it with much pain. Throughout my life, I've been to more family funerals than I have weddings or births. It takes a toll on a young person's heart. I needed the Lord to strengthen me and I felt his presence the first night of the meetings right in my seat right after brother Matthew got done preaching. I felt the Lord working on my heart to let go of the pain completely and not let the devil not let the devil take root again. My biggest prayer in losing my uncle has been for my aunt and cousins to surrender to the Lord fully. Miraculously, they have been asking questions, reading brother Brandham books, calling Robert, calling my dad, and talking to my papa a lot. They've been also going to church there in Beach Island since Uncle Jason's passing. I am so grateful to see this bring them closer to the Lord instead of them running further. This leads to a testimony that I've been estatic to share since I got the news Tuesday. My mother's brother Mark left the message a few years ago. He went down a path that was filled with adultery, alcoholic lifestyle, and drugs. He secluded himself away from all family, religious or not. My uncle served the Lord for many years before he left to do his own thing. Well, in my uncle Jason's passing, it stirred up something in my uncle Mark's heart. I got a call that this past Monday evening, he went to my papa and asked for prayer, and it turned to him leading to him giving his life and heart back to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is completely separating himself from everything that has led him astray. This is such a beautiful thing the Lord has done. Even family that isn't serving the Lord has said, "This could only be God that turned his life around." I have had the most encouraging faith lifting moments, knowing that through the loss and pain that I have suffered this past few months, God still is mindful of my requests and desires. This year, I went in the prayer line very overwhelmed to the point where I literally told the Lord, "I'm glad you don't get overwhelmed like I do because I'm dumping it all out, Lord." I decided I wasn't okay with asking one or two things. If I was going to ask, I might as well take the leap of faith. As the saying goes, go big or go home. So many so many questions were answered in the outpouring of the word. I couldn't get enough. My dad always told me, you have if you have a question, sincerely pray about it and the Lord will answer it in the season you need. I am truly thankful that the brothers had surrendered themselves to the Lord and the truth was given in so many different ways that I've never comprehended it could be said. I overcame anxieties I have struggled for the for a good six years and I am so thankful to have a clear heart and mind over it. I have fully accepted my healing that I know the Lord has given me throughout the years. And I'm grateful to say that today I can stand and say I am no longer anemic. I no longer have the fears that I'm going to have ovarian cysts or that I am not going to be able to have children my doctors have cleared me. I want to say thank you to everyone for your support during the past months of every child I've been through. I couldn't have done it without it. It shows who truly cares and has prayed for me. And I want you to know that I truly love you and I feel your support every single day. [Music] Amen. Ain't God good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Amy, bless her, Lord. &gt;&gt; I didn't really prepare anything, but um I should have known it was testimony service, but I'll check with them. But um I just want to I just enjoyed the meetings and just really got a renewing and you know sometimes you just uh go through the motions. I mean you love the Lord. Come to church. You know it's the right thing to do. It's what you do. You know every faithful and you sing songs and they're just sometimes they can just become just lyrics. But um but there just seems like just the Lord just gave me a renewing that I'm just those are so much more than lyrics. just the word just so real, you know, and it just um it's good to fill your religion sometimes, you know, not just um just out of duty or but so I just thank the Lord for just renewing me and just like I said, the lyrics are real and all the things they've been I've always known predestination, but when you think that there's nothing that can take you out when you like just the revelation of that that &gt;&gt; it's already done &gt;&gt; and uh and you can get a little glimpse through all the trials and you can get a little glimpse of yourself, your name that is so precious and I'm so thankful that I can see this because there's people that come and go and they just can't see it and want so bad to just somehow open their eyes and just that they could see the truth, that they could see that God loves them. They could see they could receive it. You just want to you see that they're in chains and bars. It feels like you just and and I can see it. I'm so thankful. That's just there's no words that could ever express the love I have for the Lord that he's chosen me. And I'm thankful, you know, like they were saying in the morning, the dancing and beauty for ashes and sometimes it's the hardest things in our lives that &gt;&gt; boring and we've seen that, you know, with my husband's family, but it's the very hardest things that bring that sweet smelling savor to the Lord. It's nice to be able to see some some eyes opening to just uh, you know, to know the Lord more. So, but I just want to think actually if Eliana would come forward. [Music] I can't begin to tell you what your love has. I'm lost for words. [Music] Is there a way to show this in my heart? Can I express how truly great I think you are? My dearest friend, [Music] Lord, this is my desire to pour my love on you. Like oil upon your feet, like wine for you to drink, like water from my heart. I pour my love on you. It praises like perfume. I lish mine on you till every drop is gone. I'll pour my love on you. [Music] I don't know how to say exactly how I feel. I can't begin to tell you what your love has meant. I'm lost for words. Is there a way to show this passion in my heart? Can I express how truly great I think you are? You're my dearest friend, oh Lord, and this is my desire. [Music] Just to pour my love on you, like oil upon your feet, like wine for you to drink, like water from my heart. I pour my love on you with praise like perfume. I lavish light on you till every drop is gone. Lord, pour my love on you. Like upon your feet, like wine for you to drink, like water from my heart. I pour my love on you. It praises like perfume. I lavish on you till every drop is pour my love on you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Did you enjoy that? So I throw up my hands, praise you again and again. All that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. And I know it's not much, nothing else fit for a king. Except for a heart seeking highle. [Applause] [Music] Amen. God bless you now. Um so I I definitely want to thank the Lord for his blessings um during the meetings and actually for the last few weeks I've been so blessed by the services and um the preaching and the Lord's really been working in my life And um Colton and I have really dug into the Bible and and started reading um the Bible in a year. Um it just really has helped us to stay focused and um spend uh a more special time with the Lord. And even though all of that these meetings were coming up and I was feeling really down um just very very fatigued and in my in my mind and my body and to the point of just tears. Um and then I was I was down um because John had to leave again uh for work and and all kinds of things. is I mean things like my refrigerator went out the night be like Thursday night right before church and I had all this food and people staying with us and you know the meetings and the everything that was happening and it's just like you know little thing after little thing and so I was I was pretty down and Thursday night I didn't sleep I had a just a piercing headache and um all the things that were happening and I just I was feeling pretty discouraged and the Lord just came down and by Saturday I had I didn't feel so tired anymore and I had so much joy coming up in me that I I just thank the Lord. I I told him I was like I can't get through this weekend without you just physically like this physical body just can't do it. And um he has blessed me so much in in the preaching and then just his spirit filling him and um even the little bit of fellowship um was just so special and it just meant so much to me. Um the prayer line, well, Brother Ronnie's sermon about rejoicing just like meant so much to me and I just felt that joy in my heart. No matter what's going on right now, God knows all about it and he he's got it so I don't have to worry about it. I just felt such a burden lift. And um and the prayer line, I just went in thanking the Lord already. And I I know the Lord doesn't have to give us these extra confirmations because I already have it in me. I already know I already know that he loves me and that he's with me and that he's taking care of all of this. But he used a minister that knows nothing about me. He doesn't know anything that's been going on and he just spoke what I was asking the Lord for. &gt;&gt; So to me that was just an extra blessing. and u very thankful and and I'm I'm I'm just happy in the Lord. [Music] There's a deep settled peace in my soul. [Music] It's an anor that ever will hold. [Music] In the rough, angry waves round me roll. There's a deep settled peace in my soul. There's a pure perfect love in my life. Does the way with all in me and strife, making me his obedient and There's a pure perfect love in my life. [Music] There's a rapureing [Music] faith in my heart. &gt;&gt; Breaks the bonds of this vain world. [Music] Let me know I was his from the start. [Music] There's a rapturing [Music] faith in my heart. &gt;&gt; There's a deep settled peace in my soul. It's an anor that ever will hold. [Music] In the rough, angry waves round me roll. There's a deep settled peace in my soul. Amen. Did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we stand to our feet once again? Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we do that song? Um, he gets sweeter as the days go by. She had to add effort. He gets sweeter as the days go by. He gets sweeter as the book is fly. Oh, his love is richer, deeper, fuller, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go by. Oh, he is sweeter. As the days go by, he is sweeter. As the moment is fly, his love is richer, deeper, fuller, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the day. Can we take it up? Oh, he's sweeter as the days go by. He gets sweeter as the moments fly. His love is richer, deeper, fuller, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. days go by. Can you say amen to that tonight? Amen. God bless. You may be seated. I've asked Sister Rose to come and help me sing this song. We uh we've been wanting to do it as a congregational. Brother Ben does it back at his church, the honeycomb taste and see. Um I'm not sure we'll have her lead it. Amen. Do you love him here tonight? Amen. Oh, sorry. Hey, I'm just dropping the ball here tonight. Not paying attention. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not very good at talking in front of everybody, but here we go. Um, man, I just these meetings were amazing. Just so refreshing to me. Just it's like this the word. I can see myself so clearly in the word from cover to cover. That's me. It's just so real to me. &gt;&gt; And I've had different things going on with my in my body. You know, Satan has really tried to attack. But but he's a liar. And I just &gt;&gt; thank the Lord that I'm healed. &gt;&gt; You know, I just different things like during service when he was praying, Satan tried to attack again. And I thought, Satan, you still haven't had enough, have you? I thought, I'm healed. I am healed from the top of my head to the soles of my feet. And that's like, so be it. It's done. There's no question about it, &gt;&gt; you know, and I just thank you for renewing my mind, &gt;&gt; just renewing my body, and just &gt;&gt; giving that strength when needed &gt;&gt; because there's times I thought I told Wendell, I said, "I don't know if I can go anymore." I said, "I'm just worn out, but you know what? God just gave me that refreshing and that renewing &gt;&gt; where I can go on. You know, I can make it." &gt;&gt; So those that are different ones I know are fighting in their body here also. And you know, there is a light at the end of that tunnel. &gt;&gt; You know, there is there is hope. You know, we never give up because, you know, at the end, you know, who's going to be on the mountain, who's going to be on the who's going to win? We are. &gt;&gt; You know, we're winners. You know, &gt;&gt; I just love the Lord tonight. And I just thank him for his love and his mercy that he's showed on all of us, you know. I just love him. [Applause] Amen. If you know it, help us sing it. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know a good God. I have a father. He is my daily bread, my living water. I have a promise. He will deliver. I'm sisfied.

God bless you, Brother Joe. Sure appreciate the testimonies tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, the meetings were great. Exceptional this year. Um, and I don't know if y'all don't know that I go through a lot of mind battles. Uh, and one that's been there for about a year. It'll put me under a lot of torment and then tell me to kill myself. Has been for year, year and a half. And uh, about a week before the meetings, I'm like, you know, I'm taking you through that prayer life. I told that devil I said I'm not putting up with it no more. &gt;&gt; I was and they started I'm making sure I'm going through there. It started right before service too started doing it again. I said no no I'm going through that prayer line &gt;&gt; and uh I made sure I was one of the first ones through there and I haven't had that since &gt;&gt; since the prayer line. I still got the torment but he ain't telling me to kill myself. I told him one of them's one of you is going to go, you know, because well, we're all tried and and we're we're um that is that how our gold we're made, you know. So, I'm learning through even the torment. &gt;&gt; I'm learning even more every day. So, if that's what I got to go through, I got to go through it. But he's not telling me to kill myself no more because I'm not going to kill myself. &gt;&gt; I'll never taste that. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] What's so funny? &gt;&gt; Oh, you're too slow. I'm just glad you let us elders testify. I won't be long, but I'm going to go back a little ways. So young people, grandkids, listen up. Here in couple of days, I'll be 63. That makes me still younger than some, but older than most. It's 1980. a 17year-old boy in a Baptist barnyard &gt;&gt; and I heard an eagle scream. [Music] I accepted that call. Brother Matt, God made me a living voice. Brother Nathan, by his grace, brother Zachary, I can rejoice, Brother Ronnie, and rest in my position, Brother Zachary. again. [Music] Then Sunday morning, I had it I had it in my my notes I'd put down, digging ditches. That man of God didn't get up there and said, "Dig you some ditches." &gt;&gt; I was even thought about mentioning it before he got out there, but now I know why I didn't. God spoke right to me. I'd put down long ago. I'd looked it up in the scripture. Elisha commanded by the thus sayaith the Lord, make this valley full of ditches, you know, and it seems like it's been 45 years. Well, it has been 45 years since that day. I've been digging my ditch. I should have a deeper ditch and a bigger ditch. So you don't look up to me. But like pe like David said, "Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I'll fear no evil, &gt;&gt; for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me." I've been in a valley, many valleys. this valley of death. I all around me, my own twin brothers took his life. God took my son. [Music] My daddy died suddenly of a heart attack. Just this year, my 42year-old quadriplegic nephew took his last breath. [Music] But every shovel of dirt which is a is a dying out to this flesh. my own ideas. God is filled overflowing with his word, his life, his spirit. And I was reminded of a song, Wendy Bagwell and the Sunlighters. The tomb is empty, but my life is full. You ever heard that, Brother Wendell? The tomb is empty. Look it up. Listen to it. It's a wonderful song. That's my testimony today. Though I've walked through the valley of the shadow of death like David did, my life is full. Amen. And I'm rejoicing tonight. Amen. Wonder if you if you do have the words to uh God on the mountain. Amen. I I might be able to see it on here. Amen. Let's let's try that. in uh in we'll try it in D first. Sister Mary, life is easy [Music] when you're up on the mountain and you've got peace of like you've never known. [Music] But then things change and you're down in the valley. [Music] Oh, don't lose faith, child. You're never alone. Would you help me on the course? For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley. &gt;&gt; When things go wrong, &gt;&gt; he'll make them right. [Music] And the God of the good time is still God in the bad time. The God of the day is still God in the night. You talk of faith when you're up on the mountain. Come on. &gt;&gt; But talk comes so easy when life's at its best. But it's down in the valley &gt;&gt; of trials and temptations. Oh, that's when faith is really put to the test. For the God of the mountain is my God in the valley. When things go wrong, and they will, he'll make them right. And the God of the good time is still God in the bad time. The God of the day is still God in the night. One more time, would you help me? Oh, the God of the mountain will be your God in your valley. when things go wrong. How about it, Sister Angie? He'll make them right. And the God of the good times is my God of the bad times. The God of the day is still God of the night. The God of my day is still God of the night. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; last month I started going through reading Daniel. Um, and in In chapter nine of Daniel, you find where uh Daniel's gone through his his trials. He's seen the miracles and now he comes to the point where he understands by books the number of years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Jerusalem. and he puts himself to prayer and he's, you know, confessing the the sins of the nation and confessing his own shortcomings and going through. And at the end of the prayer, he prays in verse 19 of Daniel 9, he says, "Oh Lord, hear, oh Lord, forgive. Oh Lord, hearken and do. Defer not for thine own sake, oh God, for thy city and thy people are called by thy name. And his prayer struck me as I was going through it last month. And um as we went into uh as we went into this month, I uh had got my family together and I kind of gave all of them um a challenge. Um I wanted I told them each to get a notebook and for this month I wanted all of them, me included, to be writing down their prayers. Um, you know, there's [Music] there's something I've I've noticed that there can be something different when you start to actually write down your prayer. Um, you know, it's just entering into prayer with the Lord is great, but there are times when you if you take the time and you sit there with the pen and paper and you're writing down And it's almost like you see it in permanence in front of you of okay, this is the request I'm I'm bringing before the Lord. And so I kind of set this month that we're we're still in for the family to be, hey, we're, you know, when we have our our devotion time, we're going to be talking about prayer and we're going to be going over um looking at different prayers in the Bible. I want you to be writing down your prayers and I want you to be really looking at that part of your relationship with God. And you know, as we went into the services, um I had my my request that I was writing down going, Lord, this is what what I'm looking for in in the meetings. And um you know, as I think we've heard from from multiple other people, um you know, I was I was going into these meetings tired. Um I was going into these meetings um not necessarily as excited as I have been before. Um but I was still going in with, okay, Lord, this is these are the things that we that I need. Um, and you know, the the services were all were all excellent. Um, but the the one that stood out to me the most was uh, Brother Zachary Wallace's. Um, and I I've told a couple people, I'm like, I think that that was about the best sermon I've ever heard him preach. Um, and I mean he had a lot of um he had a lot of uh stories and a lot of types in there that were making things stand out on on on different things that um there was one thing that that he told that was um you know and the story with the pig stood out a whole lot and different things, but when he was telling the story about um the the brother with the coffee shop and how the brother had seen had been reading a quote and then had been like um Lord I don't want to hold back miracles. I don't want to turn down the miracles that you may have for me. And um it got me looking through through quotes and I don't know if this is the exact quote that he saw, but it was one that kind of stood out to to me as being very similar. And um it's in the sermon Mary's belief. Brother Random says, "Before miracles can take place, the Holy Ghost has to come." That's what the matter in the world today. They're denying the power of the Holy Ghost. And um as we were going into the the prayer line on on Saturday night, that was the prayer that was really starting to to echo in my heart was Lord, I don't want to turn down the miracles that you have for my life. Um, you know, there are a lot of times that I think we can start to categorize miracles off in this area as, okay, someone has cancer, they need a miracle. Someone has um this major medical issue, they need a miracle. And you know this, we start picturing these these really big things are where miracles happen. And we start um and we start to maybe I'm only maybe I was the only one doing this, but we start to restrict God and our own lives from giving the small miracles. And because we look at it and go, that's not really big enough. that's not really um yes, I know the Lord can do it, but goodness, it's nowhere near what this family is struggling with or what this person is struggling with, and I don't really want to bother God with this. Maybe it's not a a big enough issue or it's not an important enough issue. And sometimes it's that we just maybe we're a little too focused on the things that aren't that aren't as important in our life. And so we're not accepting the miracles God's trying to give us because we're focusing on well, I want this in my life or I want God to do I want God to perform this way. I want him to make this happen. And you know I I'd had my different prayers written out of of what I what I needed and you know I've been uh blessed to watch my children growing up and um you know I've been blessed to watch Luke growing up and stepping into his roles and being able to stand up as as more of a man and seeing the Lord work in his life and seeing, you know, him get the Holy Ghost and seeing him move into these realms and go, "Okay, Lord, I know that he's still got growing to do, but I know you've got him. He's got the Holy Ghost. He's got that peace. He's He's going to keep going. He's going to keep pressing on because you've already filled him, take care of him. And so my heart was really for Paul going into these meetings going, "Okay, Lord, I need you to take the next step with him." [Music] and prayer line started and uh you know everybody's coming through and the Lord's working and touching and uh it's still always it's still still I'm not used to the experience of standing where I stand now at the front of the prayer line and watching everything as it's going on. But um you know, I saw Paul as he was coming up through line and um you know, as I'm in my role, I'm just praying, Lord, I I want you to do something for him. I want him to get something special out of this. and then watching his face as he stepped up in into the line and seeing the Lord working on him and um you know I'm not the the one that stands and goes, "Oh yes, I know for sure he got the Holy Ghost or I know for sure he didn't." or whichever one that's between him and the Lord. But I can I could stand there and I could know for sure, okay, the Lord's working on him. Whether he got it in that moment, whether it's the start of a process for him to get it, I knew that it was it was the beginning of the answered prayer that I had. [Music] And so after, you know, everyone had had gone through the prayer line, after everything was was basically done, I I stepped over to go through myself. And that was that was the one prayer that I still had was just Lord, I don't want to be restricting you. I don't want to be &gt;&gt; holding back the miracles that you may have for my life or for my family. Whether those are spiritual, whether those are physical, whether they're financial, what whatever it is, I don't want to be standing here and going, "Oh, no, Lord. I've got this. I can handle it. I can do it on my own. I'm &gt;&gt; I'm smart enough. I'm strong enough. If I'm whatever Lord, I don't want to be in the position where I am blocking whatever you have to offer for my life. And all the services were great, all the different all the ministers speaking and and seeing the way it worked. But that was just the piece that that I'm walking away with. The piece that that really grabbed me is going, "Okay, Lord, I don't want to stand in your way. I know that you're able and I know that you have better things for me than I can even ask for. They may not be necessarily what this flesh wants. They may not necessarily be what uh exactly what I'm thinking you're going to do, but I don't want to stand in the way of what you're doing in my life or in my family. [Music] Did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're going to sing another song here and if we'll make one more call as we're get ready to turn to our pastor here tonight. Let's turn to G. I'm not a prisoner anymore. My soul and joy has been restored. He broke the chains that once held me. The son has made me free indeed. Oh, freedom to worship, freedom to praise, freedom to walk in his freedom ways, freedom to sing, freedom to dance. I have been given a second chance. Not going back to the enemy's kingdom. I've tasted freedom. [Music] His love destroyed the cage of sin. Hallelujah. Are you thankful for that tonight? With just one touch I'm do again. [Applause] No longer bound by gu. Thank you Lord. Each day I let this freedom ring. Freedom to worship. Freedom to praise. Freedom to walk in his freedom ways. Freedom to see, freedom to dance. I have been given a second chance. Not going back to the enemy's kingdom. I've tasted freedom as they continue to play that. Just like to open the the uh floor one more time to to anyone that might have a special or a testimony. I've I've enjoyed them. I know I keep saying that, but I really have enjoyed all the testimonies here tonight. Amen. God bless you, brother Mitch. Which one? Who wants to go first? Amen. All right, brother Luke. God bless you, Brother Luke. Amen. All right. Well, uh I want to start off by saying uh all the meetings were really really good. I definitely was blessed. Um I'll say uh over the years I have developed a lot of different insecurities, complexes, had so much anxiety over so many different things. Uh the service were incredible. Like I said, um brother Zachary Wallace, he preached an incredible sermon. and it was absolute masterpiece. But um before the Saturday night service, I uh I texted Poppy and I'm like, "Hey, do you have time to meet and talk before church?" And as soon as I saw his truck pull up in the parking lot, I immediately walked over right next to his office and me and him had a little chat and I'm like, I've been dealing with all these anxieties and insecurities and complexes and it such a burden, such mental and in some ways physical burden. Um, we talked and brother Ronnie Long, he got up and preached and he hit on so many of the things I was dealing with and he was repeating a lot of the things that Poppy had said to me. And um, I will say I've never gone through a prayer line before where I actually got a blessing until that Saturday night. I went through and as soon as I walked in, Brother Ronnie laid his hands on me and he he started praying for the exact things that I needed, freedom from anxiety and insecurities. And I got through to the end and Poppy, he pulled me aside and he said that sermon was for you and he prayed for me. There was such wonderful peace I felt from the Lord's touch. Sunday morning, Brother Matthew McGary got up and he he started on the exact same things. I just want to thank the Lord for giving me freedom from all those different things and for strengthening my faith. [Music] All right. This is a song that I haven't sang in a while. All right. I haven't practiced playing this song very many times, so bear with me. Who am I that you are my me? That you hear me when I call? [Music] Is it true that you are thinking of me? how you love me. It's amazing. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. He calls me friend. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. He calls me friend. Who am I that you are mindful of me? That you hear me when I call? Is it true that you are thinking of me? How you love me, it's amazing. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. He calls me friend. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. He calls me friend. God Almighty, Lord of glory, you have come. God Almighty, Lord of glory, you have called me friend. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. He calls me friend. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. He calls me friend. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. I am a friend of God. He calls me friend. [Applause] I'll stand right here because I'm not good at walking right now. Um, yeah, I just want to say one thing first. Uh, Caleb, you know, he came back from his grandparents from seeing them on vacation and and u, you know, it started a couple weeks for me before the services. Brother Wendle preached one night. So, never give up on your family. And that's been kind of hard for me at times. You know, I'm always been the crazy one. Maybe I was crazy when I was out in the world, but then God changed my life and I still became the crazy one with him, you know, and uh so it's, you know, it's been tough. And then just before the meetings, my mom called and talked to her and my she said my dad had had a stroke. He's had dementia and they had called in hospice. He's gone down real fast. Um I guess he lost his eyesight and just it was going pretty fast. And I called the kids together and told them and Caleb came to church and he sang that song, "No grave can hold my body down." and put his grandfather up and talked to my mom a couple days later and you know the doctors don't really really know but they have to explain it somehow. They said it was most likely staff and he was recovering from it. Um I think most likely God healed him immediately and then took that stroke away and he started coming back real fast. And I'm proud of Caleb for that. And Luke, it was good testimony because that was one I was going to give. Anyways, I've had anxieties, had complexes all my life, especially with the family and stuff and growing up. And you carry him with you. And when I left, I left because of the gospel. God called me and I left to do missionary work. And I'd never been to church. I'd never done missionary work. And so it did seem kind of crazy. It was, you know, I didn't even know what I was doing, but I left and u family still always looked at me as I was pretty odd. You know, I had all the riches of the world there. I could have done whatever I wanted and I left for this. And all they see is life's such a struggle, you know, financially. But you know what? They're always fighting to hang on to what they got. I'm never going to lose what I got. &gt;&gt; I'll never You'll never lose what you got. And Satan wants to bring it up all the time that you're inadequate. that you still hold these complexes. You're still that same thing going on in your head and all that stuff. And you go through a dry time and you struggle. It's been a struggle and you know every service was building up and building up and Saturday night was exactly talking about complexes and talking about you know just it was right there the whole time and God said you don't need those complexes no more. He says, "With me, all things are possible. Just you and me, all things are possible." He said, "I still have a work for you." And so that's my testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we stand to our feet here tonight, I sound like a broken record, but I've enjoyed it here tonight. And we're going to turn it to our pastor. Um, what you want to say? Okay, y'all can be seated. Just got one more special. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't mean to keep getting you guys up and down. Sorry. But there's something about my grandpa I was supposed to say beforehand, but quite a few years ago, I don't remember how old I was, honestly. Me and him had taken a little road trip. Uh, I don't know if we were supposed to pick up D off or just meet my uncle Richie, but uh, me and my grandpa went to a McDonald's, so I must have been young. But he took me through and he's just asking me questions like, "So, do you really believe all that stuff?" And at the time, I was kind of going through a phase where I didn't know what I believed. I didn't know if I believed this. And this is well before I became born again as a Christian. And he kind of looked at me funny when I gave him the answer that I don't know. I'm just kind of looking through it all that. He's like, "Well, it's a good thing. You need to stick with it." And back then I kind of brushed it off. But seeing the kind of man my grandpa is and what that would mean to say that to me. And it's also why it's been kind of tough to see him go from this tall over six foot businessman just constantly going to work every morning to someone who can't even remember who I am. And I just I love my grandpa very much for that reason. But I know God can do anything. And I know that death is not the end of it for us and for anyone who's even been kind to us, who's fed us, clothed us, and everything. So I at least know death is not the end for him either. So God can heal him in any sort of a way. And would you guys uh Brother Wendell and Kobe, would you mind helping me sing this one? Uh I gave Sister Keys the lyrics to it. So [Music] the Lord I say there ain't no grave that can hold my body down. I say there ain't no grave [Music] that can hold my body down. So when I hear that trumpet sound, [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to rise out of the ground. Cuz there ain't no grave that can hold my body down. Well, fear is a liar with a smooth and velvet tongue. Oh, fear is a tyrant. He's always telling me to run. Oh, love is a resurrection and love is a trumpet sound. Yes, love is my weapon. I'm going to tear these giants down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave [Music] that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. Whoa. There was a battle, a war between death and life. &gt;&gt; And there on a tree. The lamb of God was crucified. And he went on down to hell. Oh yeah. And he took back every key. &gt;&gt; And he rose up as a lion just to set all the captive free. Cuz there ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave [Music] that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. Well, won't you look way down the river and what do you think I see? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I see a band of angels and they're coming after me. I'm singing, "Meet me, Jesus, meet me. Won't you meet me in the middle of the air?" And I know my wings won't fail me, so I can meet you anywhere. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. Well, you can take me out to the graveyard and you can lay my body down, but when Gabriel he blows that trumpet, I'm going to get up out of the ground. I'm singing meet me, Jesus, meet me. Won't you meet me in the middle of the air and I'm going to rise to meet my Lord? I'm going to say goodbye down here. There ain't no grave [Music] that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. There ain't no grave that can hold my body down. [Music] Amen. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Did you enjoy that? &gt;&gt; So glad we have that promise. There ain't no grave. &gt;&gt; If we have to see death, there ain't no grave going to hold this body down. Amen. But so glad we're looking forward to that rapture. I believe could happen any time. Amen. Thank you for that. Appreciate that. Amen. Can we stand to our feet here tonight? And as we get ready to turn to our pastors [Music] everything, give him thanks. Give him thanks. [Music] Everything [Music] give him thanks. [Music] Oh, in the good times, praise his name. In the bad time, do the same. In everything, give the King of Kings maybe one or two. Oh, the praise in everything. Oh, with everything. [Music] Give him thanks. Thanks. In everything give him thanks. [Music] Oh, in the good times, praise his name. Heal the bad times. Do the same. In everything, give the King of Kings all the praise. One more. King in everything. Oh, everything. Give him thanks. Give him thanks. In everything give him thanks. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh the good time praise his name the bad. [Music] Hallelujah. Can we do it again? I don't know if I know the song. In everything, give him thanks. Give him thanks. In everything, [Music] give him thanks. [Music] In the good times, praise his name. In the bad times, do the same. Give the King of Kings. [Music] Praise the Lord. Been a wonderful evening. Every testimony was just so wonderful &gt;&gt; and I'm so thankful to hear what the Lord is doing for you in your life. And I couldn't find the exact quote while ago. I was I was trying to scroll on my phone, but but Brother Brandham would talk about how that um Lot's faith was paralyzed because he couldn't see the eternal purpose of God. He couldn't see he was wrapped up in the in the this and the now. But he said Abraham and Sarah lived a harder life. They were they were in a land by themselves, misunderstood, but their faith was not paralyzed because they didn't judge God by the circumstances around them. And so I would encourage every one of us here tonight as we as we leave whatever you have received from the Lord, don't let the devil paralyze your faith in any way. those testimonies that you have given, the answers that you have received and those that are that are believing that the answer is coming. Do not start looking at your complexes. Do not start looking at your feelings or anything else. &gt;&gt; Keep the faith strong. &gt;&gt; Abraham's faith was not paralyzed. Lot's faith was paralyzed. And so, amen, as as sons of God. And he and he and he spoke that. I know what tape it's in. It's a good it's a good tape even for us to all listen to this week. And that's why Christ speak. And and brother Brandham was saying the word is in the bride. The word is there. And and don't let anything paralyze that faith. How many believes that's a good idea? Amen. So, we sure enjoyed it. Enjoyed every song. I thought all the songs were beautiful uh tonight, the specials, the the the testimonies. I was blessed. And so, we appreciate Brother Kobe uh leading the leading the service and and uh we have thoroughly enjoyed it. Um praise the Lord. Well, we just pray God's blessings on every one of you and uh keep on pressing the battle and um we we know that the rapture is right upon us. I I believe it's right upon us. Praise the Lord. God richly bless you. Uh what are we going to sing as we dismiss? Praise the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. When the morning comes, all the saints of God will gather home. We will tell the story of how we've overcome and we understand it better by and by. Oh, by and by. God bless you. You're dismissed in the fear of the Lord. We love you of God. We'll gather home. Oh, we'll tell the story how we've overcome and we'll understand it better by and by. Oh yes. By and by. When the morning come, all the saints of God's going to gather home. We will tell the story how we've overcome. And we'll understand it better by and by and by. Da da da da da da da. On the restless sea of time, somber skies and howling tempest of succeeding sunshine in that land of perfect day. When the mists have rolled away, we will understand it better. By and by, oh by and by when the morning comes. Oh, when the saints of God will gather home, we will tell the story of how we've overcome. and we'll understand it better
