[46:50] peace from God our Father and from the
[46:52] Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the god and
[46:56] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[46:58] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[47:01] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[47:04] as he had chosen us uh before the
[47:07] foundation of the world that we should
[47:08] be holy and Without Blame before him and
[47:11] love having predestinated us unto the
[47:15] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[47:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[47:21] of his will now I'd also like to look
[47:24] here in the Book of Romans the 11th
[47:25] chapter and we're just going to read one
[47:27] verse and that's here at Verse
[47:30] 18 and it says boast not against the
[47:34] branches but if thou boast thou boast or
[47:38] thou bearest not the root but the root
[47:42] thee let's go to the Lord in prayer
[47:45] father we want to thank you
[47:47] tonight for your love to us and your
[47:50] grace Upon Our Lives we thank you Lord
[47:54] for
[47:56] Lord having us in your heart upon your
[48:00] book the book of remembrance Lord before
[48:03] the world ever
[48:05] began thank you for
[48:07] Calvary thank you for the baptism of the
[48:09] Holy
[48:11] Ghost we're asking Lord that you would
[48:14] just be with us here tonight now Lord
[48:16] and you would Minister to us I'm asking
[48:20] Lord that you would Lord just Lift us
[48:22] all up into your presence Lord both
[48:25] speaker and hearer that we may see what
[48:27] you are speaking to the church tonight
[48:30] and we'll give you glory and honor in
[48:33] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ can
[48:36] the church say amen amen and amen God
[48:40] bless you
[48:42] amen we are wanting to speak tonight um
[48:47] on our position in Christ and and um we
[48:53] uh the The Roots is what bears the tree
[48:57] and and I want to speak a little on the
[49:01] root system amen we been talking a lot
[49:04] about
[49:05] Ministry we've been talking about a love
[49:08] that that is that comes from way down
[49:11] deep inside and that every one of us
[49:13] have a
[49:14] Ministry and there is a reason that this
[49:18] love comes and oozes out of us is
[49:21] because amen we are in we were pred
[49:25] destinated in Our Roots we are in Christ
[49:30] Jesus you can't help but oo Redemption
[49:33] because there's where you are amen your
[49:37] life is hid uh with Christ in God and so
[49:43] amen there so today we we're thankful
[49:47] for the roots we're not we're not here
[49:49] because of our good abilities or or or
[49:53] our understanding we're not here because
[49:57] amen we we um have grasped the message
[50:00] we are here by predestination we are
[50:04] here because God thought of you before
[50:07] the foundation of the world Now The
[50:10] Roots is what bears the tree now many
[50:13] today are rooted in opinion they're
[50:15] rooted in Creeds and dogmas amen and and
[50:19] so that that is what they are and of
[50:22] course it'll never produce the Life of
[50:24] Christ because the Life of Christ is not
[50:26] in the seed amen it's the wrong life you
[50:29] can't you can't have the wheat life and
[50:33] and and be a weed and you can't be amen
[50:36] produce the weed life and be a wheat you
[50:40] you have got to be one or the other and
[50:42] so amen we we understand that the tear
[50:46] can say that I'm the wheat amen but the
[50:49] life is is weed life and so it can't
[50:53] pred it it can't produce anything for a
[50:57] little while they'll look the same amen
[51:00] but but it was always a wheat and a
[51:02] wheat was always a weed and so uh when
[51:06] when we look here at this scripture in
[51:09] that first verse we we ought to be
[51:11] thankful for this because Ephesians 1:1
[51:14] again to the faithful in Christ Jesus
[51:19] you're faithful because you're in Christ
[51:23] Jesus can you say amen now brother
[51:26] Brenham talks about h a being in in
[51:30] Christ amen and he and he says when
[51:33] you're when you're baptized into Christ
[51:35] amen uh into Christ by the Holy Ghost
[51:39] there's where you find rest from all
[51:41] your labors because now his life is
[51:45] expressing itself through you and he
[51:47] would say in Oneness he would say Amen
[51:50] Jesus going to the grave of Lazarus I'm
[51:52] the resurrection and life he that
[51:54] believeth in me though he be dead yet he
[51:57] shall live and what and who whatsoever
[52:00] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[52:02] die believeth in me not on me but in me
[52:08] being in me believing if you abide in me
[52:11] and my words in you in him believing I
[52:15] hope the Holy Spirit gets that right
[52:17] down to you amen he says believing in
[52:20] him you cannot believe in him until you
[52:23] come in him or he comes in you and then
[52:27] you're believing in him then you have
[52:30] eternal life Believing on him until you
[52:33] receive eternal life and then eternal
[52:35] life is God's life in you and then
[52:39] you're believing in him so so when the
[52:42] seed is energized by the power of the
[52:45] holy spirit amen it gives the the
[52:48] germination of that seed gives the seed
[52:51] permission to live its life amen the
[52:55] rain doesn't give amen doesn't give the
[52:58] wheat seed its life because the rain
[53:00] gives amen it it it gives permission to
[53:02] the to whatever seed to produce after
[53:06] its own kind amen God gives the seed God
[53:10] creates the seed God ordained the seed
[53:13] the rain and the sun simply ignites what
[53:17] is already there and it gives permission
[53:20] for it amen to produce
[53:23] itself and so when the the Holy Spirit
[53:26] comes Upon Us amen the Holy Spirit
[53:29] simply germinates that seed that is
[53:33] within your heart by
[53:35] predestination amen by one Spirit are we
[53:39] all baptized into one body amen you're
[53:42] submerged into this you are amen you're
[53:45] not sprinkled you're not you're not
[53:47] poured you're not stamped you're you
[53:49] it's not a tattoo amen but but it
[53:52] becomes amen the the life within you you
[53:56] become synonymous with the root you
[53:59] become amen you and the root is exactly
[54:03] the same thing can you say amen amen
[54:06] that's why Jesus says no man can pluck
[54:09] you out of my hand amen you and the life
[54:12] are one and nothing shall separate us
[54:17] from the love of God in Christ Jesus
[54:19] well aren't you glad for that amen shall
[54:21] tribulation separate us no amen so
[54:24] famine separate us no shall tribulation
[54:27] separate us no shall sickness separate
[54:30] us no shall sin separate us no there is
[54:34] that love you are in
[54:39] himen now I want you to understand that
[54:43] because as we begin to talk about our
[54:45] position amen our position is the
[54:48] Abiding Place it's not work related at
[54:52] all amen now we we've been talking about
[54:56] Ministry but you see Ministry can only
[55:00] come when we find who we are and we are
[55:06] satisfied amen with what God is doing
[55:09] now now many pray and every day and they
[55:12] say that's abiding in and I say no amen
[55:15] somebody you say what it's reading my
[55:17] Bible every day amen that must be
[55:19] abiding no amen well I I do good deeds
[55:23] that must be abiding no that's not how
[55:27] you abide you are baptized into Christ
[55:32] you and God become
[55:35] one well that should make you want to
[55:38] shout now the acts Amen in the natural
[55:42] these are tokens of our love Ministry is
[55:47] our token amen it's an expression back
[55:50] for what God has done for us amen I I I
[55:55] want to tell you today you cannot have
[55:58] confidence in the Deeds Done amen
[56:01] because remember the Jews had a law amen
[56:04] and they that they lined themselves up
[56:06] by a and they had the dos and the don'ts
[56:09] down to the tea according to the
[56:11] scripture but you see you amen are not
[56:15] in a religious activity you are an
[56:19] expression of the Eternal God Amen now
[56:23] how many's understanding that M that's
[56:25] what God wants you to understand you are
[56:29] represented in Christ the seed
[56:35] alone you're not represented in your
[56:37] ability you're not represented in your
[56:40] in your ministry amen you you can you
[56:42] can you can cast out Devils you can you
[56:45] can perform Miracles you can work work
[56:47] work work work work work and that does
[56:50] not make you the seed of Jesus Christ
[56:53] that's right you're the seed of Jesus
[56:54] Jesus Christ because of the roots you
[56:58] were in
[56:59] Him Praise the Lord now the Greeks
[57:03] wanted an audience with Jesus and Jesus
[57:06] was fixing to to go he was fixing to be
[57:09] crucified and and there in John
[57:13] 12:23 uh when when the disciples come in
[57:15] and and and told him they wanted to see
[57:17] him and this was his response Jesus
[57:19] answered saying the hour has come that
[57:22] the son of man should be glorified
[57:24] verely verily I say unto you except a
[57:26] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[57:29] die it abides alone but if it die it
[57:34] brings forth much fruit he that loveth
[57:37] his life shall lose it he that hateth
[57:39] his life in this world shall keep it
[57:41] unto eternal life now Jesus is is is
[57:44] expressing something I'm fixing a leave
[57:47] and if you were to go on down there he
[57:49] begins to talk about how that he's
[57:50] leaving amen but he is letting them know
[57:54] I I am fixing to be put into the ground
[57:57] yeah I've got to die I'm the root and
[58:01] there's only one way that the Life of
[58:05] Christ can be exhibited manifested
[58:08] throughout the Earth and that is through
[58:11] with by death and there will come a
[58:13] plant life up of its of its kind can you
[58:17] say amen amen I want you to see that
[58:19] plan amen because you are in the sea
[58:25] you are in him you are predestinated in
[58:31] The Roots can you say amen he represents
[58:35] every kernel of wheat that should ever
[58:38] come
[58:39] along when you plant that one seed into
[58:41] the ground I don't think I have amen
[58:44] hallelujah you plant that seed into the
[58:46] ground in that seed amen is is is every
[58:51] kernel of wheat that will ever ever be
[58:55] produced is in that seed right there and
[59:00] when you planted when God planted Jesus
[59:03] Christ into the
[59:04] ground up come the church 50 days later
[59:09] Here Comes amen the Pentecostals
[59:12] speaking in tongues the power of God the
[59:15] glory of God there was there were 3,000
[59:18] so added to the church and it was all
[59:21] because there was a seed that was
[59:26] planted
[59:28] Hallelujah can you say Amen now Jesus
[59:31] was that you were chosen in him before
[59:36] the foundation of the world so the life
[59:39] of the wheat plant will come into
[59:43] maturity because it was
[59:47] predestinated in The
[59:49] Roots if you're not in the wheat plant
[59:53] you can't come to to maturity come on
[59:56] but if you're in the wheat plant there's
[59:59] nothing left but maturity because God is
[1:00:02] bringing he's going to bring that plant
[1:00:06] well praise the Lord you man now in the
[1:00:09] natural when the when the seed when that
[1:00:12] seed uh uh burst open and the life is is
[1:00:16] germinated amen and and you can
[1:00:19] literally watch it you can get on
[1:00:20] YouTube and and and they've got cameras
[1:00:22] there that'll that that'll show you how
[1:00:25] that seed and how it dies and begins to
[1:00:27] rot and then amen as that life begins to
[1:00:31] uh uh as that all of a sudden that that
[1:00:34] seed just pops open and stuff begins to
[1:00:37] ooze out of it amen it's it's it's the
[1:00:40] most incredible thing amen and it begins
[1:00:42] to ooze out of it and that little bitty
[1:00:44] seed begins to Spring out little bitty
[1:00:47] little bitty Roots little tentacles out
[1:00:49] of it and before you know it it begins
[1:00:51] to come up and and you can push you can
[1:00:53] push the little PL play deal because
[1:00:55] amen it it this happens over a period of
[1:00:57] months but they've got it to where uh uh
[1:00:59] they're taking pictures just you know
[1:01:01] every little bit and so you can push it
[1:01:03] where it makes a little movie and and
[1:01:04] you can just see it when you hit it amen
[1:01:06] all of a sudden it busts open little
[1:01:08] things begin to come out and then after
[1:01:10] a while you begin to see the fullness of
[1:01:13] what the seed was supposed to produce at
[1:01:16] the beginning
[1:01:18] right and everything that the wheed has
[1:01:21] everything it'll ever be everything that
[1:01:23] you go and all and that's beautiful it
[1:01:27] all
[1:01:28] happened on because of the seat amen
[1:01:32] amen now now y y'all catching me here
[1:01:35] hallelujah because I want you to see
[1:01:36] this God oh God's Got Something
[1:01:39] Beautiful now remember here here God was
[1:01:44] doing something there there by the time
[1:01:46] you got to acts 5 and
[1:01:48] 34 you know they were they they were uh
[1:01:51] crucifying the church and and
[1:01:53] persecuting the church should I say and
[1:01:55] and and G stands up there in Acts 5:34
[1:01:59] and then he says you know a Pharisee
[1:02:01] named G a doctor of the law had
[1:02:02] reputation among all the people
[1:02:04] commanded uh uh to put the apostles
[1:02:07] forth this little space and said unto
[1:02:09] them ye men of Israel take heed to
[1:02:11] yourselves what you intend to do is
[1:02:13] touching these men for before these days
[1:02:16] Rose thas boasting himself to be
[1:02:18] somebody to whom a number of men about
[1:02:21] 400 joined themselves and who was slain
[1:02:23] and all and and as many as obeyed him
[1:02:25] were scattered and brought to not after
[1:02:28] this rode Judas of of GA Galilee in the
[1:02:31] days of of the taxing and Drew away
[1:02:32] people after himself he also perished
[1:02:35] and and if even as many as obeyed him
[1:02:37] were dispersed now I say unto you
[1:02:40] refrain from these men let them alone
[1:02:44] for if this counsel or this work be of
[1:02:48] men it will come to not but if it be of
[1:02:51] God on you can not overthrow it lest
[1:02:57] happily ye be you be found to fight
[1:03:00] against God can you say Amen so that man
[1:03:02] was a smart man he's he was saying this
[1:03:05] these people aren't just acting like the
[1:03:07] normal people these people have been
[1:03:10] energized by something greater than
[1:03:13] themselves praise the Lord I you know I
[1:03:16] I I I want to say here tonight amen
[1:03:18] we're not just a bunch of religious
[1:03:20] folks here in in Le odys I believe that
[1:03:23] the power of the the holy spirit is is
[1:03:26] right here living his life and did you
[1:03:28] know that the Rapture is not going to be
[1:03:30] something amen that is that that that is
[1:03:33] a a natural event it's the supernatural
[1:03:36] it is the manifestation or it is the
[1:03:38] harvesting of the wheat plant and taking
[1:03:41] it into Glory I I say today we ought to
[1:03:44] be thankful for
[1:03:46] it amen now as we as we go on a little
[1:03:50] bit
[1:03:51] positioned in Christ every
[1:03:55] amen everything about that
[1:03:58] seed represents the plant now I also
[1:04:02] want us to look before I go too much
[1:04:04] further here tonight amen this being a
[1:04:07] Wednesday night and just uh uh uh
[1:04:09] teaching a little bit but they me Jesus
[1:04:12] Christ was the established head of that
[1:04:16] church now okay now this is this is
[1:04:18] incredible because he didn't just start
[1:04:21] a movement here on the Earth
[1:04:24] but now he is our
[1:04:28] representation in the heavens right amen
[1:04:31] you look there at at Matthew 21 and and
[1:04:35] and uh
[1:04:36] 42 and Jesus said unto them did you ever
[1:04:39] read the scriptures the stone which the
[1:04:41] builders rejected the same has become
[1:04:44] the head or the chief the Supreme the
[1:04:46] master of the corner and this is the
[1:04:48] Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our
[1:04:51] sight if you look there in Ephesians 1
[1:04:53] and 20
[1:04:54] it says and which he had wrought in
[1:04:57] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[1:05:01] and set him at his own right hand in the
[1:05:04] Heavenly places now that word set it

[1:05:08] established made him to set to have a uh
[1:05:12] to have fixed one's abold at his own
[1:05:15] right hand so when Christ was raised up
[1:05:19] you are
[1:05:21] represented in him tonight
[1:05:25] so when he is sitting at the right hand
[1:05:28] of the father when he has been
[1:05:31] positionally placed so have

[1:06:08] church he is representing you through
[1:06:11] your good through your bad through your
[1:06:13] UPS through your Downs through your ins

[1:07:29] this world but also in that which is to
[1:07:31] come and has put all things somebody say

[1:08:00] that we've got a representative we were
[1:08:03] part of him the only reason we're here
[1:08:07] is because of Christ Our
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:11] beginning Christ is the beginning he's
[1:08:13] the author of the creation of God he is
[1:08:16] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:08:19] he will never leave you nor forsake you
[1:08:22] he is positioned in the heavens he's
[1:08:25] positioned there not for
[1:08:27] himself Christ has not been positioned
[1:08:30] in the heavens for himself the whole
[1:08:32] reason Christ came was to redeem you he
[1:08:36] wanted to redeem he wanted a new
[1:08:39] race he wanted a people amen that would
[1:08:43] fulfill the purpose that Adam and Eve
[1:08:44] fulfilled and Christ came to birth you
[1:08:48] Amen to bring you into existence and now
[1:08:52] he is seated in the Heavenly place say
[1:08:54] and he's representing you before
[1:08:58] God well that should make you want to
[1:09:00] shout that should make you want him can
[1:09:03] you say amen amen and and he says and
[1:09:05] has put all things under his feet gave
[1:09:07] him to be the head over all things to

[1:09:10] fullness of him that filth all in all
[1:09:14] Hallelujah where's Christ in the
[1:09:17] Heavenly
[1:09:18] places now now catch this now the
[1:09:20] Apostle Paul then goes and says and now
[1:09:23] we have been positionally placed in
[1:09:27] those same Heavenly places we are here
[1:09:31] in this body and this body has so much
[1:09:34] torment this mind has so much torment
[1:09:37] there's so many things about this body
[1:09:40] that just that that that and yet Christ
[1:09:45] or the Bible says the Apostle Paul says
[1:09:47] you are positioned in those heavenly
[1:09:51] places how are you POS position your
[1:09:55] position there because Christ your
[1:09:58] representative is seated
[1:10:01] there now brother Brandon when he begin
[1:10:04] to preach on adoption he says now this
[1:10:06] is really
[1:10:07] deep this is really deep because we see
[1:10:12] things in the natural we view things by
[1:10:16] the way we feel we view things by our
[1:10:20] emotions we view things by amen our good
[1:10:23] good or are bad but Christ is
[1:10:27] representing
[1:10:29] you whether you feel good or whether you
[1:10:32] feel bad that's right and I just want to
[1:10:35] tell you if you ever get into the get in
[1:10:38] your mind that you're ever going to earn
[1:10:39] anything from God you might as well go
[1:10:41] fly a cat go jump in the lake go do
[1:10:44] something because you can't do nothing
[1:10:46] to earn God's approval you can't earn
[1:10:48] anything you can't earn anything from
[1:10:51] God are y'all understanding me so many
[1:10:54] Ministry is simply because I know who I
[1:11:00] am yes thank you Lord that's the only
[1:11:03] way you can be effective is to know
[1:11:06] God's love in you and when you've
[1:11:07] experienced God's love and you've got
[1:11:10] that
[1:11:11] expression Hallelujah it didn't matter
[1:11:14] whether those guys whether Jesus was
[1:11:15] Healing The Sick or whether he had a bad
[1:11:17] headache it didn't matter whether amen
[1:11:20] he had a whole crowd or whether everyone
[1:11:22] had forsaken him and it turn turn around
[1:11:24] to his 12 and says are you going to
[1:11:25] leave me also he was loved by God and
[1:11:29] that was all that
[1:11:33] mattered right the human being Jesus
[1:11:38] Christ is in heaven representing you
[1:11:44] before God Amen thank you
[1:11:47] Lord he's the only one that was ever
[1:11:51] perfect he's the only one that could
[1:11:54] represent you Mary represent you Kobe is
[1:11:57] the only one that can do it he is the
[1:12:01] originator the author of God's new
[1:12:08] race oh Hallelujah you say boy this is
[1:12:11] pretty simple really W it's pretty deep
[1:12:13] for some of you
[1:12:16] Hallelujah there's nothing you can do
[1:12:18] about
[1:12:20] it when we can come to the real
[1:12:24] it that my Beginnings did not start at
[1:12:28] an altar
[1:12:31] somewhere but my
[1:12:33] Beginnings
[1:12:35] started in the little seed
[1:12:39] form 2,000 years ago in the body of
[1:12:43] Jesus Christ now I'm just now coming up
[1:12:46] 2,000 years later but I was already in
[1:12:49] the seed before the foundation of the
[1:12:53] world it Christ was already the lamb
[1:12:55] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:12:57] 2,000 years ago here he came up the life
[1:13:01] of God has energized me today and I'm an
[1:13:05] expression of that now you
[1:13:08] understanding
[1:13:10] well how long is my salvation as long as
[1:13:14] he's
[1:13:15] there as long as he's there I've got a
[1:13:20] representative as long as he's represent
[1:13:23] me I'm going to be
[1:13:26] okay oh brother wend I I just don't want
[1:13:29] to I I I I I heard the prophet say that
[1:13:32] I can send my day of Grace away well it
[1:13:35] depends it
[1:13:37] depends it it it depends on whether
[1:13:40] you're a weed or you're a wheat come
[1:13:43] on a wheat can never did I just say
[1:13:47] never somebody say
[1:13:49] never send their day of Grace away
[1:13:54] yes
[1:13:56] right you're in
[1:13:58] Christ now if you're a weed well you're
[1:14:01] going to Buck against God and everything
[1:14:03] you ain't going to submit to his word
[1:14:04] you ain't going to have the desire to do
[1:14:05] so you ain't going you're just a weat
[1:14:08] come on and God's grace will
[1:14:10] someday quit dealing with you that's
[1:14:13] right the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:15] that's upon you making you feel good and
[1:14:18] all that well someday you because it's
[1:14:21] in your nature to reject his word that's
[1:14:27] right but a
[1:14:30] wheat it's a
[1:14:32] wheat it don't matter what part of the
[1:14:37] plant it don't matter whether the plant
[1:14:39] is a little blade sticking up or whether
[1:14:41] the plant's in the stock phase or
[1:14:43] whether the plant's in the weak phase it
[1:14:46] is a wheat
[1:14:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:14:57] Hallelujah you love
[1:15:00] him
[1:15:01] Hallelujah here's the little
[1:15:05] seed
[1:15:07] Hallelujah and then the rain and the Sun
[1:15:10] comes and then all of a sudden amen The
[1:15:12] Roots begin to go out everywhere and
[1:15:15] amen before you know it here comes a
[1:15:17] little
[1:15:18] leaf and then another little
[1:15:22] leaf
[1:15:24] is it going to be a wheat or is it
[1:15:26] already a
[1:15:31] wheat now I thought wheat I thought
[1:15:33] wheat looked you know like this
[1:15:36] and and and and all over like this and
[1:15:40] and and and little leaves on it and and
[1:15:42] all that I I I thought that's a wheat
[1:15:45] that's the final stages of the
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:51] wheat but your wheat because because the
[1:15:53] seed is
[1:15:55] wheat yes you're wheat now in your mind
[1:16:00] you're still a faulty human being but
[1:16:03] God's got a seed on the inside of your
[1:16:09] ground amen this is you right here
[1:16:11] you're you're the dirt Hallelujah this
[1:16:14] is you you are dirt hallelujah amen and
[1:16:20] when Jesus said amen thy will will be
[1:16:23] done in somebody say in Earth as it is
[1:16:29] already in the heavens you've already
[1:16:32] got a representative up there
[1:16:35] representing the seed in
[1:16:40] your can you say
[1:16:43] Amen now now the devil will tell you
[1:16:45] young and H well Mom don't love you Dad

[1:16:49] let's just get this thing straight God
[1:16:51] loves you amen and you'll always be
[1:16:54] loved by God
[1:16:57] Amen and your mama loves you too and
[1:17:00] your daddy loves you too it's just the
[1:17:02] devil trying to tell you but when he
[1:17:04] tries but if he's got you convinced that
[1:17:06] dad's just out to kill you mama just
[1:17:09] doesn't like you and she would love to
[1:17:10] sell you on the black market just
[1:17:13] remember you've got something in here
[1:17:16] that's causing desire to love him to
[1:17:20] serve him to give him glory GL that can
[1:17:24] on that that ain't going to happen on
[1:17:25] the serpent
[1:17:27] seed that's not going to happen to give
[1:17:30] yourself to God and to surrender
[1:17:32] yourself to
[1:17:35] God that can only happen through a
[1:17:38] predestinated
[1:17:40] seed well glory to
[1:17:42] God
[1:17:44] Amen you see
[1:17:47] Ministry can only come and express
[1:17:52] itself when we can
[1:17:55] understand what is taking place within
[1:17:57] us yeah can you say amen amen Christ is
[1:18:03] Seated on the right hand of the Majesty
[1:18:07] on high amen what did the scripture say
[1:18:10] there in Hebrews 1:13 it says to which
[1:18:12] of the Angels said he at any time sit on
[1:18:14] my right hand until I make thine enemies
[1:18:17] thy foot
[1:18:19] stol
[1:18:21] hallelujah what here here another one
[1:18:24] there in Hebrews 10 and 12 but this man
[1:18:27] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:18:28] sins forever sat down on the right hand
[1:18:32] of God from
[1:18:35] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[1:18:38] made his foot
[1:18:40] stol okay all right so so so Christ paid
[1:18:44] the
[1:18:45] price he comes to the heavens he sits
[1:18:49] down folds his legs and he he is
[1:18:54] expecting every one of those enemies
[1:18:56] that are against you to be defeated and
[1:19:01] what wh why is he up there sitting
[1:19:03] because he is interceding for your sins
[1:19:05] while the devil is beating on you and
[1:19:07] telling you that you're worthless and
[1:19:09] telling you that you'll never make it
[1:19:11] and he's telling you amen that you you
[1:19:14] can't have a Ministry Jesus is setting
[1:19:17] there interceding for you until you come
[1:19:21] into that maturity
[1:19:25] well I just feel like shouting right now
[1:19:27] and I'm not even evangelizing right now
[1:19:29] hallelujah amen you see it's because of
[1:19:32] our
[1:19:34] position not our
[1:19:38] feelings we're positioned in
[1:19:42] Christ Hallelujah now watch from hence
[1:19:46] forth expect until his enemies be made
[1:19:47] his foot stol for by one offering
[1:19:50] someone say hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:53] someone say hallelujah hallelujah for by
[1:19:56] one offering he hath perfected
[1:19:59] forever them that are
[1:20:02] Sanctified you're in him
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:07] now the position of the believer in this
[1:20:11] last day
[1:20:13] matters it matters a
[1:20:17] lot and and and you know in
[1:20:21] fact it it's it's it's when the it's the
[1:20:25] positioning comes as we talked about
[1:20:26] here a week or two ago is when the son
[1:20:29] comes of age he comes to that point am
[1:20:33] man where the father has tutored him and
[1:20:35] tutored him and schooled him and now
[1:20:38] amen he's he's thinking like Dad and
[1:20:41] he's he's acting like Dad and amen and
[1:20:46] just let me tell you kids you'll never
[1:20:49] outgrow your
[1:20:50] father you can't outgrow your father
[1:20:52] father I don't care how old he gets I
[1:20:55] don't care if he's feeble I don't care
[1:20:58] how poor he is you will never
[1:21:02] outgrow your father and the quicker the
[1:21:06] the the the good way of understanding
[1:21:09] maturity is being able to look at that
[1:21:12] Father Figure in your life and start
[1:21:15] seeing things the way he sees
[1:21:20] things understanding things what can you
[1:21:22] say amen amen so the only criticalness
[1:21:26] from us kids toward our parents should
[1:21:28] be the criticalness is of of am I
[1:21:32] getting it
[1:21:34] right my my father brought me in my
[1:21:37] mother is bar but they they have they
[1:21:40] have produced this here again again
[1:21:43] you're the
[1:21:44] branch they're the
[1:21:46] root can you say Amen on so the quicker
[1:21:50] you could understand
[1:21:53] why Mama and Daddy's dealing with you
[1:21:56] why they're bringing things why your
[1:21:59] life was you know you can you can look
[1:22:00] there and pick on your mama and say well
[1:22:02] you done way you screamed at me you you
[1:22:05] know you you you you uh made me feel bad
[1:22:09] you whatever
[1:22:13] well you might have been a difficult
[1:22:15] child and and and and
[1:22:19] maybe maybe Mama's trying to tutor you
[1:22:22] but the quicker as you grow up and you
[1:22:26] start understanding things on the adult
[1:22:28] level are you kids understanding me the
[1:22:30] quicker you understand those things then
[1:22:33] you can start thinking ha now I yeah now
[1:22:36] I get it now I get it oh boy and it
[1:22:41] sometimes it don't happen until you get
[1:22:42] your own kids then you think
[1:22:46] a cuz you're want to kill your kids and
[1:22:48] your dad didn't kill
[1:22:50] you hallelujah amen
[1:22:53] and and and but what it is is is you're
[1:22:58] beginning to grow
[1:23:01] up instead of the selfish little old
[1:23:03] thing blaming everybody else for your
[1:23:06] stupidity you're
[1:23:08] understanding
[1:23:10] huh and their daddy is still sitting
[1:23:13] there with all his mama with all their
[1:23:15] gray hairs looking at you you know and
[1:23:16] you're only you're only amen 16 years
[1:23:19] old but they've already got a h a head
[1:23:21] full of hair gray hair because of you
[1:23:24] you
[1:23:26] see it is a it is God or it is you're
[1:23:29] you're coming into that maturity God is
[1:23:33] bringing every one of us into that
[1:23:35] maturity and you know what God is
[1:23:37] patient because you are part of
[1:23:42] him well there ain't none of your M and
[1:23:44] daddies would try to sell you amen I
[1:23:46] don't
[1:23:47] think unless they just got really needed
[1:23:50] some money I guess but no they wouldn't
[1:23:53] do that because you're of them you're
[1:23:58] part of
[1:24:00] them you came from them are y'all
[1:24:06] understanding
[1:24:08] me praise the Lord now here we are in
[1:24:13] the fullness this remember this is the
[1:24:14] dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:24:16] this is the time where us Believers have
[1:24:18] got to come into maturity now I've used
[1:24:20] you youngans uh uh for example but but
[1:24:24] you see now God's calling the entire
[1:24:28] church into
[1:24:30] maturity God's bringing us all up into
[1:24:32] maturity so when you hear us talking
[1:24:34] about bright age or adoption or uh or or
[1:24:39] anything of that nature it is it is
[1:24:41] declaring the time that we're in a
[1:24:44] prophet came in this in this last time
[1:24:47] Amen to initiate us to point us to what
[1:24:51] our divine Divine Purpose is in this
[1:24:53] last day and to tell us you're you're
[1:24:57] going it's time to go back to
[1:24:59] Eden you're ready to go back into that
[1:25:02] place of authority and and you're going
[1:25:05] to rule and Reign on this
[1:25:07] Earth that's the place where we're at
[1:25:11] can you say
[1:25:12] Amen
[1:25:14] now we're in brother brandham would put
[1:25:18] it this way now he says the Pentecostal
[1:25:21] Church
[1:25:23] that was that was God's that's what God
[1:25:26] had in mind the Pentecostal church at
[1:25:29] the
[1:25:30] beginning but then Satan come in the
[1:25:33] insects and he and brother Bram would
[1:25:35] would say amen he he talks about what
[1:25:39] about the true this is in the resume of
[1:25:40] the ages in the church age book he says
[1:25:42] what about the true seed he says it will
[1:25:44] happen just as we have said the people
[1:25:46] are being made ready for the word of
[1:25:49] truth from the messenger to this age
[1:25:52] in her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[1:25:55] for the spirit will bring the people
[1:25:57] right back to where they were at the
[1:25:59] beginning and this is thus sayeth the
[1:26:02] Lord amen it is thus sayth the Lord for
[1:26:05] it for that is what Joel 2:23 says it
[1:26:09] says be glad ye children of Zion rejoice
[1:26:13] in the Lord ye your God for he hath
[1:26:16] given you the former Reign moderately he
[1:26:18] will cause to come down for you the rain
[1:26:20] the former Reign and the latter reign in
[1:26:21] the first month and the floors will be
[1:26:24] full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow
[1:26:27] with wine and oil and I will restore to
[1:26:30] you the years that the Locust hath eaten
[1:26:33] the cankerworm the caterpillar the
[1:26:35] palmerworm the my great Army which I
[1:26:37] sent among you and you shall eat in
[1:26:40] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[1:26:42] name of the Lord your God that hath
[1:26:45] dealt wondrously with you my people
[1:26:47] shall never be ashamed now brother
[1:26:49] Brandon would say now it says God is
[1:26:51] going to restore the Lutheran age did
[1:26:53] not restore the church it started a
[1:26:57] Reformation the wesleyian age did not
[1:27:00] restore the Pentecostal age did not
[1:27:03] restore but God has to restore for he
[1:27:08] cannot deny his
[1:27:11] word he says this is the resurrection
[1:27:13] this is not the resurrection of the
[1:27:15] church this is the restoration God will
[1:27:18] take the church right back to the
[1:27:19] Pentecost of the beginning notice in
[1:27:22] verse 25 it tells why we need the
[1:27:24] restoration because the Locust and the
[1:27:26] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[1:27:28] Palmer worm have eaten all but the roots
[1:27:32] and a small bit of the stem now we are
[1:27:34] told that all these insects are all one
[1:27:37] and the same in different stages this is
[1:27:39] the Antichrist spirit manifested in
[1:27:41] organization denomination of false
[1:27:42] Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor
[1:27:44] little root and stock is going to be
[1:27:47] restored God isn't he is not going to
[1:27:50] plant a new church church but is going
[1:27:53] to bring his original back to the
[1:27:56] original seed now I want us to look real
[1:27:59] quickly here before I be before we um uh
[1:28:03] before I end here tonight now Hallelujah
[1:28:07] all
[1:28:10] right
[1:28:11] so the church at Pentecost
[1:28:15] Christ amen y'all love y y'all know that
[1:28:19] I'm a really good artist Christ was the
[1:28:21] seed
[1:28:22] died went three days he was
[1:28:25] resurrected up amen came a
[1:28:28] plant that was
[1:28:31] beautiful all the powers of God all in
[1:28:34] it now it looked like it looked like it
[1:28:37] came up quickly but it did not amen it
[1:28:40] it it came up it was the Old Testament
[1:28:43] prophets prophecies all coming into
[1:28:45] Christ and then it was fulfilled in this
[1:28:47] church right here the power of the holy
[1:28:50] spirit amen man it was human beings
[1:28:54] living the life of God on human beings
[1:28:58] dead were raised sick were healed the
[1:29:01] Gentiles had the gospel preached to them
[1:29:03] God was living in human beings amen but
[1:29:08] now the scripture says or the as we just
[1:29:11] as we just read these insects begin to
[1:29:14] eat up the tree and before you know it
[1:29:17] it was it was eaten here and the pmer
[1:29:19] worm and the cankerworm
[1:29:22] and it was eating that little wheat tree
[1:29:25] wheat and plant all the way up and the
[1:29:28] prophet told us that the only thing that
[1:29:31] was left was what the root and a little
[1:29:36] nub sticking out of the
[1:29:38] ground in the Dark Ages the Catholic
[1:29:41] Church totally took it all
[1:29:44] away but then God said I'm going to
[1:29:49] restore
[1:29:50] amen Hallelujah so out of the Dark Ages
[1:29:54] here come little leaf begin to come up
[1:29:58] what was
[1:29:59] that
[1:30:02] justification Martin Luther stood up and
[1:30:04] said the just shall live by faith yes
[1:30:07] praise the Lord now brother brandham
[1:30:10] would say in this quote he he would say
[1:30:13] Amen uh he says U let me find it here
[1:30:17] real quickly well glory to God you love
[1:30:20] him let's see
[1:30:24] uh amen he says now along we've been
[1:30:27] talking about the seed of the wheat
[1:30:29] being buried and then sending up two
[1:30:30] shoots the tassel and the true ear and
[1:30:33] and this might make some wonder if if we
[1:30:37] said that the Luthers didn't have the
[1:30:39] Holy Ghost because they taught basically
[1:30:41] sanctification it might make some wonder
[1:30:43] about the Methodist no sir we're not
[1:30:46] saying that we're not talking about the
[1:30:48] individuals of the people but the age
[1:30:50] Luther had the the spirit of God but his
[1:30:54] age was not the full age of restoration
[1:30:57] by another outpouring like at the
[1:30:59] beginning it was the same with Wesley
[1:31:01] Booth Knox Whitfield Brainard John
[1:31:04] Edwards Mueller Etc surely they were
[1:31:07] full of the Holy Ghost yes they
[1:31:10] certainly was Hallelujah my my Deal's
[1:31:14] going crazy all right he said yes they
[1:31:17] certainly was he says uh but the age in
[1:31:21] which each lived was not the age of
[1:31:25] restoration neither was any other age
[1:31:28] but this last age it will be a age
[1:31:31] completely black out in apostasy this is
[1:31:35] the age of apostasy but this is the age
[1:31:38] of restoration it's the age of the
[1:31:41] finished cycle with this it's all over
[1:31:45] all right so
[1:31:47] how can the leaf have the Holy Ghost how
[1:31:52] could Luther have the Holy
[1:31:54] Ghost I need some class participation
[1:31:57] hallelujah
[1:31:59] amen hallelujah this didn't look
[1:32:01] anything like it was didn't look
[1:32:03] anything like this up
[1:32:06] here hallelujah beautiful wheat
[1:32:09] plant amen Roots all right here's your
[1:32:14] wheat this is the Holy Ghost this is the
[1:32:16] book of Acts this is the power this is
[1:32:18] what God is wanting the church to be
[1:32:23] how could that how could they have the
[1:32:24] Holy Ghost come on talk to
[1:32:28] me the life is in the
[1:32:34] root the life is what brings the
[1:32:41] leaf it had every bit of life in that as
[1:32:45] the wheat little Pebbles up
[1:32:48] here but it
[1:32:50] wasn't the original it's not in its
[1:32:53] maturity here come amen so here here was
[1:32:56] the Lutheran they were coming up little
[1:32:58] little sprigs and and then and then here
[1:33:00] come here come the stock and little
[1:33:03] leaves on it and this was sanctification
[1:33:05] now down here
[1:33:07] hallelujah this here is
[1:33:10] justification quit
[1:33:13] laughing
[1:33:14] Justified
[1:33:17] appear
[1:33:19] Sanctified Hallelujah
[1:33:23] it's coming on up all right then you
[1:33:26] come on up here and and you begin to get
[1:33:29] you begin to
[1:33:31] get the little and I'll explain that to
[1:33:33] you in a minute but let's just call this
[1:33:35] Holy
[1:33:38] Ghost
[1:33:43] baptism all
[1:33:47] right hey like
[1:33:50] that
[1:33:53] Hallelujah okay so out of all these in
[1:33:57] that age where brother on that stock on
[1:34:00] that stock that's where brother brandham
[1:34:02] was talking about uh Wesley Booth Knox
[1:34:05] Whitfield brainer John Edwards all of
[1:34:08] those guys they were all part of the
[1:34:11] stock that was growing up growing
[1:34:13] growing growing growing growing growing
[1:34:17] all under the work of
[1:34:20] sanctification under that work of
[1:34:23] sanctification Hallelujah now when you
[1:34:26] come up to up up here to when it's
[1:34:29] beginning to
[1:34:31] mature that's when that's when things
[1:34:33] look let me see if I can make this look
[1:34:35] a little bit more realistic here maybe I
[1:34:38] don't know
[1:34:43] amen it looks like the wheat little
[1:34:47] bitty little bitty deals there right now
[1:34:51] and a lot of people thought that was the
[1:34:54] Holy Ghost or that was that was the
[1:34:56] original church because it began to look
[1:34:58] different Justified now Luther Luther
[1:35:01] Luther uh smoked a pipe while he was
[1:35:04] while he was writing his books on
[1:35:06] justification Allelujah and let me just
[1:35:09] tell you something all of you folks who
[1:35:11] love that uh who's who what's that guy
[1:35:14] that everyone loves the quote all the
[1:35:20] time that
[1:35:22] Spurgeon he smoked a cigar it's in his
[1:35:25] writings he smoked a cigar after every
[1:35:28] sermon he preached he says there's
[1:35:31] nothing like getting up and relaxing
[1:35:33] with that
[1:35:37] b that's
[1:35:40] right he was down here in this Justified
[1:35:44] state but then here come sanctification
[1:35:48] the plant is growing further this is
[1:35:51] y'all's walk you can't stay in the baby
[1:35:54] stage on when we was talking about the
[1:35:56] other night Amen on the dress the way we
[1:36:00] dress see we got to get we got to get
[1:36:02] past this part and come on up because we
[1:36:06] want to come into the mind of Christ
[1:36:09] what God had at the
[1:36:12] beginning so that's when we start
[1:36:14] getting Sanctified that's when we start
[1:36:16] thinking okay time for the clear the
[1:36:19] clear fingernail polish
[1:36:21] to come off that's when it's time for
[1:36:24] the makeup oh but brother wend let just
[1:36:26] get it's time for the makeup to come off
[1:36:29] we are growing in sanctification this is
[1:36:32] where he starts separating himself or us
[1:36:35] to himself and starts cleaning us up
[1:36:38] we're beginning to
[1:36:40] understand in other words you pooped
[1:36:42] your diapers down here and it was
[1:36:48] okay come on but mama's gonna say listen
[1:36:52] Haven ain't changing your diapers no
[1:36:55] more it's time for you to be
[1:36:58] Sanctified it's can you say Amen you're
[1:37:02] coming on up coming on up now sure the
[1:37:04] leaves of justification keep right on
[1:37:08] coming they keep right on coming so
[1:37:11] justification climbs right on up with
[1:37:13] sanctification it's all part of the
[1:37:17] plant but when you get up here the Holy
[1:37:21] Ghost
[1:37:21] baptism now this is where brother
[1:37:23] brandham this is where brother brandham
[1:37:25] sort of schooled us a little bit to tell
[1:37:28] us to tell us exactly why it gets
[1:37:31] confusing in this age because it looks
[1:37:34] so
[1:37:35] real everyone speaks in
[1:37:37] tongues everyone's
[1:37:41] prophesying they wear
[1:37:43] makeup and they
[1:37:45] right but the holy spirit is wanting us
[1:37:48] to understand this looked like
[1:37:53] wheat but it wasn't wheat now now watch
[1:37:57] this
[1:38:00] Hallelujah I brought this quote just in
[1:38:02] case it would do good or just in case it
[1:38:04] got to it and I did
[1:38:06] Hallelujah all right now he says
[1:38:10] now he says he says now he's he's going
[1:38:13] back he said he ain't going to plant a
[1:38:14] new plant he said he's going to restore
[1:38:17] the one where the nub is and he's going
[1:38:19] to come back amen he says now at this
[1:38:22] very moment we are in a complete
[1:38:23] fulfillment of Revel or Matthew 24:24 in
[1:38:26] so much that if it were possible they
[1:38:28] shall deceive the very elect who is it
[1:38:31] that shall attempt to deceive the very
[1:38:32] elect why the spirit of the Antichrist
[1:38:34] the false anointed ones of this day
[1:38:36] these false ones have already come in
[1:38:39] jesus' name claiming that they've been
[1:38:41] anointed of God for the last day they're
[1:38:43] false messiah's anointed ones they claim
[1:38:46] they are
[1:38:47] prophets but are they one with the word
[1:38:50] never they added to it and taken from it
[1:38:52] and W denize the spirit of God man and
[1:38:55] and uh manifesting the gifts is upon
[1:38:57] them but like balam they have their
[1:38:59] programs the appeal for money exercise
[1:39:02] gifts and but deny the word or bypass it
[1:39:05] for the fear of controversy he he says
[1:39:08] yet preach salvation and deliverance
[1:39:10] through the power of God just like Judas
[1:39:12] with a Ministry imparted by Christ now
[1:39:15] and he and he goes on down he says now
[1:39:17] they all out shout shine in effort and
[1:39:19] Zeal he says and and he says but now let
[1:39:22] me explain they preach the second uh the
[1:39:25] second coming of Christ but deny the
[1:39:27] Advent of the Prophet messenger though
[1:39:29] the though in power and signs and true
[1:39:32] Revelations he eclipses them all oh yes
[1:39:34] this is the false spirit in the last
[1:39:36] days it's so close to the real it can it
[1:39:39] it can can be distinguished only by its
[1:39:41] deviation from the word and whenever
[1:39:43] it's caught by being anti- now he says
[1:39:48] he says it it falls back on the one
[1:39:50] argument arent that we've already shown
[1:39:52] to be false we get results don't we we
[1:39:55] have to be of God he says now before we
[1:39:57] close I want to bring this thought along
[1:40:01] with talking about the seed of wheat
[1:40:03] being buried it sends up the chotes the
[1:40:05] tassel and then the true ear this might
[1:40:08] make some wonder if we've said the
[1:40:09] lutherans didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:11] they had the Holy Ghost he goes on down
[1:40:16] he he says he says um uh he says we're
[1:40:18] not talking about the individuals he
[1:40:19] says Luther had the spirit of God but
[1:40:21] his age was not the age of full
[1:40:23] restoration but the outpouring of of of
[1:40:25] the uh like in the beginning he says but
[1:40:28] in the age which uh each lived was not
[1:40:31] the the age of restoration neither was
[1:40:33] any age but this last age now this age
[1:40:36] goes complete
[1:40:38] apostasy and it's also the age of
[1:40:42] restoration now uh I I must not have
[1:40:45] brought I read all of that but I didn't
[1:40:47] bring what I what I was planning on
[1:40:49] doing all right just ke I you uh put put
[1:40:53] that first put that first picture I gave
[1:40:55] you just real quickly I'm not going to
[1:40:57] hold you too long now now this is when
[1:41:01] the wheat comes into its
[1:41:04] fullness now what you're seeing up here
[1:41:06] in this is what I was trying to do when
[1:41:09] you when you see those little those
[1:41:10] little things there okay and it looks
[1:41:12] almost like it except I need these
[1:41:13] little deals here sticking out like
[1:41:15] those yeah now so that's the wheat
[1:41:22] it looks really
[1:41:24] close so is the farmer going to take
[1:41:27] that wheat just like it
[1:41:30] is and carry it to the
[1:41:33] barn no no that's not the wheat that's
[1:41:38] the wheat plant but inside those little
[1:41:42] inside those little deals where you see
[1:41:44] this little deal like that this is the
[1:41:48] husk and that's got to open up up it
[1:41:51] opens up just
[1:41:53] like it opens up and here and here's
[1:41:55] where it hides the sea put it put put
[1:41:57] the next One S
[1:42:00] skis so there's the shuck or the shaff
[1:42:04] chaff and then there's the grain that's
[1:42:08] inside the the
[1:42:11] shuck uh what's the other one look like
[1:42:13] I
[1:42:14] forgot Hallelujah okay so once once it
[1:42:19] has been
[1:42:22] harvested you have got The Shack on one
[1:42:26] side which will be burned you've got the
[1:42:30] wheat on the other side which will be
[1:42:39] taken
[1:42:44] now I want you to catch this because
[1:42:47] this is really
[1:42:49] cool
[1:42:53] Justified this was here see you can have
[1:42:57] you can have your seed but God's not God
[1:43:01] didn't plant it just to get
[1:43:03] leaves now if you notice I for I didn't
[1:43:07] bring the picture of what it looked like
[1:43:09] as it's coming these are all green
[1:43:11] really green and as the stock goes up
[1:43:14] it's green everything is green green
[1:43:17] it's all green why is it
[1:43:19] green
[1:43:21] CA the life but as it begins to come up
[1:43:27] higher all this begins to
[1:43:31] die go back to the second one or the the
[1:43:33] third one first one sister
[1:43:35] keys and before you know what the
[1:43:38] greenness is all
[1:43:47] gone I can tell Elana's want answer this
[1:43:51] question why is the greenness
[1:43:59] gone
[1:44:01] died because it died that's
[1:44:06] right it's all gone it's all
[1:44:11] dead it's
[1:44:14] useless none of that's going to the
[1:44:17] barn none of it's going to the barn
[1:44:22] it served its
[1:44:25] purpose the
[1:44:27] leaf was a carrier of the
[1:44:32] seed the stock was a
[1:44:35] carrier show me where the seed is it's
[1:44:38] in the
[1:44:40] life the roots are saying I've got to
[1:44:43] get to the
[1:44:44] seed come on so the roots shoots out
[1:44:48] some leaves don't look nothing like like
[1:44:50] what's in the ground here comes a stick
[1:44:53] don't look nothing like in the ground
[1:44:56] come on but it's desire one seed someone
[1:44:59] say
[1:45:00] uno in the
[1:45:02] ground and then s Keys yeah yeah one one
[1:45:06] seed in the ground and then out of that
[1:45:09] one
[1:45:10] stem hundreds of
[1:45:13] seeds except they're
[1:45:18] covered by the shu
[1:45:22] did you know that when brother brandom
[1:45:25] came who is the
[1:45:28] one that sent him all over the world
[1:45:32] what group sent brother brandom all over
[1:45:33] the
[1:45:34] world the
[1:45:39] Pentecostal is that just am I the only
[1:45:42] one rejoicing in this or you saying I
[1:45:43] don't know what you're talking
[1:45:45] about you see brother
[1:45:48] BR the leaf
[1:45:51] could not send brother brandom all over
[1:45:55] the
[1:45:57] world neither could the
[1:46:01] stuck it's the Shu that holds the
[1:46:05] life and that brought the prophet
[1:46:09] Ministry to bring you and I the word of
[1:46:13] God because it was the sunlight of God
[1:46:15] it was the it was the seed time of
[1:46:18] God it's time for
[1:46:21] Rapture and God
[1:46:23] says I gotta ripen it
[1:46:27] Hallelujah you were hidden inside that
[1:46:30] Pentecostal move it doesn't do away the
[1:46:35] seed does not do away with justification
[1:46:37] sanctification or speaking in
[1:46:41] tongues all of that life is still a part
[1:46:44] of the plant but now it's back in the
[1:46:48] seed the same seed SE that went into the
[1:46:51] ground is what God is going to
[1:46:55] Rapture and take to
[1:46:59] heaven we don't know what we we know not
[1:47:02] what ke uh uh uh uh 1 John 3 and one
[1:47:07] let's let's look at that real quickly 1
[1:47:09] John
[1:47:12] 31 behold what manner of love the father
[1:47:15] ha bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:47:17] called the sons of God therefore the
[1:47:21] world knoweth us not because it knows
[1:47:22] him knew him not beloved now somebody
[1:47:26] say
[1:47:27] now why why is it now because we are
[1:47:31] part of
[1:47:34] him beloved now we are the sons of God
[1:47:38] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:47:40] be but we know that when he
[1:47:46] appears we shall be like
[1:47:52] him the seed that went into the ground
[1:47:56] that Holy seed of God in a body is going
[1:48:00] to be living in your bodies on
[1:48:03] Resurrection morning
[1:48:07] hallelujah
[1:48:09] amen now position if you're not in the
[1:48:14] root you'll never enjoy that now Sister
[1:48:16] ke let's go back to the second picture
[1:48:18] just real quickly amen
[1:48:24] okay so brother brandom would teach
[1:48:28] us and he would show
[1:48:30] us in tight he'd say okay let me show
[1:48:35] you another story because now G now now
[1:48:37] he's using this he's using this to show
[1:48:39] to show you how the week comes all right
[1:48:41] but now now brother Brandon wants to
[1:48:43] show us one other thing
[1:48:46] okay he's he's wanting to make sure we
[1:48:48] get it he says there were three women
[1:48:51] he says notable women in the Bible all
[1:48:54] right he says and he and he brought in
[1:48:59] Sarah she was to
[1:49:01] produce Isaac the natural
[1:49:04] seed then there was
[1:49:09] Hagar she produced a servant
[1:49:15] child then there was
[1:49:18] Mary who produced
[1:49:23] Jesus the
[1:49:27] word brother random tells us he says
[1:49:31] these are the three
[1:49:32] stages justification
[1:49:36] sanctification Jesus or Mar Mary these
[1:49:39] are these are the stages these are the
[1:49:41] denominational systems Luther
[1:49:45] Wesley
[1:49:46] Pentecostal he says but what Christ is
[1:49:50] coming after none of these
[1:49:54] organizations he says the church will
[1:49:57] produce the
[1:50:00] word
[1:50:02] amen let me give you a
[1:50:04] quote he says now he says there's three
[1:50:07] women carriers of the natural seed until
[1:50:09] the matured into Christ Ishmael could be
[1:50:13] could not be because he was really as we
[1:50:15] think today out of wedlock because he
[1:50:16] was the bond Bond woman's son then come
[1:50:19] a little more like like him uh like
[1:50:22] Jesus come out of Isaac and uh but it it
[1:50:26] wasn't but it wasn't uh because it was
[1:50:28] born of the sex between Sarah and
[1:50:30] Abraham uh but then Along come Mary by
[1:50:34] the Virgin birth produced Jesus Christ
[1:50:37] that's right word made flesh and let me
[1:50:39] just stop right real real quick I done
[1:50:41] those wrong that's Hagar on the bottom
[1:50:43] that is Sarah y'all probably already
[1:50:45] caught that Hagar on the bottom Sarah in
[1:50:48] the middle and then we're going on up
[1:50:50] got me all right he says now look
[1:50:53] there's three women typed here churches
[1:50:57] women always types the churches means
[1:51:00] three denominational Ages which were
[1:51:03] carriers and must also
[1:51:08] die dry up just like the shuck and so
[1:51:12] forth does to give room for the
[1:51:18] seed SE seed can uh cannot get rip until
[1:51:22] the shuck stocked leaves are all dry
[1:51:25] that's right saps every bit of the life
[1:51:27] out of them and now it all gathers into
[1:51:30] the
[1:51:31] seed amen so where are we
[1:51:35] at can I tell you
[1:51:38] something amen that now now here was
[1:51:41] here was
[1:51:43] Luther's here's a
[1:51:47] Methodist and then here's Pentecostals
[1:51:51] all right
[1:51:55] Hallelujah show me Luther is there any
[1:51:57] life in the Luther Church come on I mean
[1:52:00] they're ordaining come on they're
[1:52:03] they're they're they're fighting for
[1:52:05] they're they're they're fighting for you
[1:52:06] to be lesbians and
[1:52:08] homosexuals Wesley amen we learned that
[1:52:11] here in our own Community the Methodist
[1:52:14] Church pastor of the Methodist Church
[1:52:15] was was uh was was fired right here in
[1:52:19] py America because he was teaching boys
[1:52:22] that homosexuality is wrong ended up
[1:52:25] having a the the the the secretary the
[1:52:29] secretary of the church was a lesbian
[1:52:32] they called the main office they had him
[1:52:35] fired so Methodist is out life is gone
[1:52:38] Luther is out life is gone so let's go
[1:52:40] to our Pentecostal
[1:52:43] move you got all the jumping shouting
[1:52:45] hollering have you can't you can't you
[1:52:47] can't look at a Pentecostal service
[1:52:49] without watching a bunch of be bobbing
[1:52:50] like this I mean they got everyone on
[1:52:52] the stage you got about 15 girls up
[1:52:53] there on the stage and they're all
[1:52:54] dancing like this all over the place and
[1:52:56] there ain't a lick of God in
[1:52:59] it and they got this Voodoo
[1:53:02] music trying to make and and the whole
[1:53:05] church the whole church is just like
[1:53:06] this come
[1:53:10] on come on
[1:53:13] folks it'll produce
[1:53:17] sincerity when the life is gone all you
[1:53:20] become is a
[1:53:22] form and you've got to fit the
[1:53:24] form and you take away those pretty
[1:53:27] girls and drop the
[1:53:32] music I don't know if there'd be too
[1:53:35] much dancing going
[1:53:38] on but they've got the light shows
[1:53:40] they've got the music come on some of
[1:53:42] those those guys have even got
[1:53:46] smoke coming up out of you know I heard
[1:53:49] a preacher the other day I I was
[1:53:50] listening to him someone sent me a
[1:53:51] little little something this guy said
[1:53:52] about the brother random or something
[1:53:53] and and and so I was looking he goes he
[1:53:56] goes boy when I come out he says I I was
[1:53:58] I was sort of thinking that the Shak of
[1:54:00] Glory was here but that was a smoke that
[1:54:02] was a preacher saiding yeah I was a
[1:54:03] visiting preacher saiding but I guess
[1:54:04] that was a smoke coming off the on
[1:54:06] platform he goes that's okay I guess but
[1:54:08] I'd sure like to have the Shan glory and
[1:54:10] everyone's all laughing really good yes
[1:54:13] yes
[1:54:15] yes but there is the
[1:54:18] bride that's what God's coming
[1:54:22] after
[1:54:24] amen
[1:54:27] now just because the Pentecostals do do
[1:54:30] all of this that doesn't mean that we
[1:54:32] can't worship that doesn't mean we can't
[1:54:35] speak in tonu that doesn't mean that we
[1:54:37] can't run the aisles doesn't mean that
[1:54:40] emotion's part of our
[1:54:43] religion I believe in emotion and I'd
[1:54:45] rather have a I'd rather have someone in
[1:54:47] this church full of emotion than that at
[1:54:49] a St stupid ball
[1:54:52] game come on but when the dance is
[1:54:56] over we are the
[1:55:00] word it's coming to that
[1:55:03] maturity this is what God's going to
[1:55:07] take to the new Eden that's the Adam and
[1:55:11] Eve that's the restoration and that's
[1:55:14] why God had a prophet to come and tell
[1:55:16] us get out of your own emotions get out
[1:55:19] of your own your own stinking thinking
[1:55:21] get get out of those denominational

[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:11] I I don't feel like I've done the
[1:59:13] Justice on the very last here
[1:59:18] folks religious
[1:59:21] forms all these
[1:59:24] denominations they're now coming to
[1:59:26] church with no
[1:59:28] sincerity there's no life there's no
[1:59:30] convictions there's nothing there what
[1:59:33] I'm
[1:59:36] saying the way that we
[1:59:39] judge that seed Shu pulling
[1:59:43] away as the Shu pulls away from the from
[1:59:47] the seed then the life
[1:59:50] it begins to mature that
[1:59:52] seed the more mature it becomes
[1:59:56] it takes all of the moisture out of it
[1:59:59] and the dross out of
[2:00:05] it I think there should be a real
[2:00:10] deep desire to do the will of the Lord
[2:00:13] just like Jesus had he was the fullness
[2:00:16] he was the seed now we could go all
[2:00:18] through the old test Testament the same
[2:00:20] thing the wheat plant we could see the
[2:00:22] prophets coming up see the shoots we can
[2:00:23] see them all coming up all the way up
[2:00:25] until it came to Jesus Christ and it was
[2:00:28] the it was the most holy
[2:00:32] people who loved the most holy God it
[2:00:35] was the most holy preachers that
[2:00:37] crucified the most holy king in the most
[2:00:40] holy
[2:00:41] city they had to pull
[2:00:44] away in order for the sun to be
[2:00:47] expressed and lifted up
[2:00:50] now
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:56] listen I want a deeper
[2:00:59] sincerity as Elena sung that song
[2:01:02] earlier I I want to stay there with
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:09] him and if the shock is still
[2:01:11] surrounding Us in this Pentecostal
[2:01:13] denominational thinking I'm I'm asking
[2:01:15] you today won't you ask
[2:01:18] God
[2:01:20] to take the shuck away from
[2:01:22] you you've got you've got the seed
[2:01:25] that's the reason you have
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:28] desire but ask God shine your light on
[2:01:31] me so that that Pentecostal thinking or
[2:01:33] the worldliness of this crazy Church age
[2:01:37] this apostate age let it pull away from
[2:01:40] me Let It Be So
[2:01:43] separated that I love God more than I
[2:01:46] love men and women or friends or jobs or
[2:01:52] more than I love
[2:01:58] sin I know I'm part of you cuz I've got
[2:02:00] it here you're representing me I know
[2:02:02] you love me I know I love you Lord just
[2:02:06] pull anything and everything away from
[2:02:07] me that's not
[2:02:09] right because the seed brother brandom
[2:02:11] says he's the promise was that that this
[2:02:15] seed would be the like the original
[2:02:20] that's your
[2:02:22] promise so you can't use the excuse well
[2:02:26] you know we're way over here in Le Osa
[2:02:28] and the and the we'll never be like the
[2:02:30] book of Acts the prophet didn't say that
[2:02:33] the word didn't say that the word says
[2:02:36] that's our promise I will
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:43] restore I believe the power of the Holy
[2:02:46] Ghost just like they had in the book of
[2:02:47] Acts
[2:02:50] is our promise that's
[2:02:53] right sincerity even remember brother
[2:02:57] Bram says it goes into total apostasy
[2:02:59] that's the
[2:03:01] shuck but it's one of full restoration
[2:03:04] that's the
[2:03:06] seed the church system will go to
[2:03:12] hell but the seed will grow more like
[2:03:16] him that's right
[2:03:19] [Music]
[2:03:24] I love him tonight not because he's been
[2:03:26] good to
[2:03:27] me I love him because I'm part of
[2:03:31] him I love him tonight not because I
[2:03:33] feel
[2:03:36] good I love him because I'm part of
[2:03:40] him oh
[2:03:44] bless me
[2:03:47] now my
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:52] saor I
[2:03:56] can
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:00] do or let the seed cry out to him
[2:04:05] crying
[2:04:08] [Applause]
[2:04:09] [Music]
[2:04:14] save make me more
[2:04:17] sincere to hear
