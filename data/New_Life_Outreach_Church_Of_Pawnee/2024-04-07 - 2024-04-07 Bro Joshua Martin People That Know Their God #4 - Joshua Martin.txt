in the middle of the circumstance cuz he said he would be there amen are you thankful for thaten if you have your Bibles let's open our scripture to Genesis 12:1 then John 14 and8 I thought that was a masterpiece this morning I was blessed tremendously by that I that was so good I trust you was blessed as well amen I'm thankful that we we get fed pretty good around here amen we got a wonderful a wonderful Pastor that sticks with this message that's all you can ask for amen uh Genesis 12 And1 The Bible would say now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee of a great a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing then John 14 and 8 and Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us and Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he he he that has seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me and the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works amen can we bow our heads this this evening dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for your love and your mercy Lord thank you for the wonderful word we heard this morning Lord and your spirit is coming Among Us father Lord as we come into this part of the service father I ask that you would Lord help me to get myself out of the way Lord and speak the words that you have for the service Lord God may I not speak my own thoughts or my own ideas Lord but speak what you have for the service Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated and so we see that uh Abraham he was separated for a purpose and I like how the Bible is putting it I will make thee a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great it had nothing to do with human ability but I was going to do this and we know that it's been God's desire to have men and women to be in his own image to express himself and like I I had said last time God would unveil himself to Avil himself in humanity and it's telling Abraham not what you can do but what I can do and what I what I like about it it it it would be Moses that would ask the burning bush who do I say sent me and the Bible or the burning bush would say to him say that I am I am the one that sent you and then is the same I am that would give a promise to Moses was the same I am that was speaking to Abraham saying I am going to bless you I am going to multip I am going to to bless your seed so the blessing of God was going to be poured out on Abraham and Abraham was then going to reflect or demonstrate the power of God in his life because the Bible would say he he would stop and say then thou shall be a blessing and though it stops and and went from God saying I'm going to bless you I'm going to make the a great nation I'm going to make thy name great then he stops and he says then thou shall be a blessing so he wasn't doing all of this in vain but AB Abraham had something to do as well Abraham was to take what the Lord was giving him and was to reflect it and I believe that we've got something to do on Earth as well we're not just here living under this message or having a word brought to us just for any other reason but God has given it to us for a purpose and I just love the election of God that God didn't just one day look on Earth and randomly pick Abraham but I believe that Abraham all along was in the mind of God the reason Abraham was on Earth was for the blessing of God to be poured out on him and him to reflect the blessing of God cuz the Bible would tell us in Psalms 3 and8 salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is upon thy people and so the blessing of God wasn't just for anybody but for his people and his people ain't just anybody but it's any predestinated people that God has chosen before the foundation of the world and brother Brandon would say this when he come expressed exactly like the Testament said he would be expressed then all of those who was redeemable believed it because they were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and brought back to God and as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God because they were redeemable from the beginning in the expression and so since they was redeemable from the beginning beginning they would see what God was doing they would see the thoughts of God being manifested because they was redeemable and I'm so thankful that even though we was in sins and in trespasses and addictions there was something on the inside of us that was always redeemable no matter how far in sin we was there was something on the inside that would respond to the blessing of God and say Lord Use Me Oh Hallelujah and so God would come to Abraham because he was in God's mind from the beginning of from before the foundation of the world and every generation that would come forth after Abraham would reflect the power of God or the power of the devil and so that just because that Jacob was an offspring from Abraham didn't make him a reflection right away he had to come in contact with the same God and receive the same blessing in order to be reflection oh man we can be born in a message church we can be set on a message Pew be a pastor's son a deacon son a song leader son but and before we can be a reflection we first have to receive the blessing so that the power of God can be reflected through us but you see this was so much of a reality that a to Abraham that he would separate himself so and before the blessing but come into manifestation in Abraham's life he first had to reflect himself and you see brother Brandon brother Brandon preaches a message called the Masterpiece and it's and it's an incredible sermon and he talks about Michelangelo that and he created the sculpture of Moses and that sculpture of Moses would start to take on an image and that image was a vision that Michelangelo had in his mind and so as he was shaping this image molding this image it would start to reflect what was in his mind before he even started that project and we see that Abraham would have to separate himself in order to be moted into the image that God would have before the foundation of the world cuz you the Bible would tell us here that after he separated them from lot then the Lord would come to Abraham and say look to Eastward look Westward Look northward look Southward all of this land I will give to you but you notice it was after he separated himself from lot that the blessing of God can then start to be manifested oh my brother brandom says the problem of it is with the Christians is they have an arcade full of blessings but they're not willing to explore it and I like how brother the brand and he talks about or the Bible would talk about Abraham he would say the Lord would say to Abraham arise and walk through the land since he separated himself then the blessings of God would start to pour on him now he could explore what God was given to him oh my once there's a separation from unbelief separation from doubt separation from the things of the world then the blessings of God can start to pour upon us and we can explore the blessings of God there's healing in the blessings of God there's a refilling of the Holy Ghost in the blessings of God we can explore it but first we have to separate oursel but you see the only reason he would separate himself help was because it was a reality it wasn't just a something he was hearing in his head but it was so much a reality to him that he would obey the word of the Lord and separate himself and you know as I was thinking on these things I'm sure that it was more than natural things that he had to separate himself from could you imagine the Mind battles that he would go through that my I'm my wife is baren I'm I'm 9 75 years old there's no way that God can bless me there's no way that I could have a child he had to separate those things from negative thoughts concerning his life and sometimes we have to separate oursel from complexes separate oursel from negative thoughts that insecurities put in our mind so that the blessing of God can fall we see that Abraham was in a natural land we're fighting in the spiritual realm so we might not have to separate oursel from natural things but they spirit things that we have to separate oursel from so that God can bring the blessings on our life oh my but you see when brother Brandon would talk about Michelangelo he would say there would be a pattern that Michelangelo would go by and he says it didn't matter what the critics would say he had a pattern that he was sticking to and the vision would take place and I like how brother Brandon would say this he says the negative would then become the positive what was in the mind would would then start to take would take on a form then brother Brandon would say let's close that book and talk about the great sculpture he says then God wanted to create something and bring into existence what his attributes desired he said Michelangelo had to have a marble to create His Image but God didn't need something materially he could create something and so he would start to create the brother brandom says he creates uh he creates the low form of animals then he creates the Tigers and the Lions he creates these things but he created all the creeping things but finally he wanted a reflection of himself and so then he would create a man in His image and brother Brandon would say this but finally there come upon the Earth of perfection that was the man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was the reflection of what the Creator was and God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image oh God wasn't satisfied with the tiger with the lions with with nature with all of these other things with the angels he wanted the reflection of himself the Angels couldn't be a reflection the Lions couldn't be a reflection the Tigers couldn't be a reflection but he wanted a man that he could Veil himself in and be a reflection of his attributes a reflection of his nature just like God would speak to Nature the reflection would speak to Nature just like the Creator would speak to the speak to the the the storm the the the reflection would speak to the storm what was it it was the negative becoming positive and it was a reflection that brother Brandon would say that God wanted a masterpiece family so what he would do is he would strike the sight of Adam and out of the sight of Adam he would start to form Eve and what I think is so beautiful is he would say he went to take another creation he took a part of the original creation he took Eve from Adam and would create another Masterpiece oh my and what did what did God say when he come looking for Adam and Eve he would say Adam Adam Where Art Thou there were one and the same and it was after the fall the Bible says that Adam would give Eve her name but it was after the fall but in the midst of this masterpiece there were one in the sh oh and God has got a masterpiece upon the Earth today he's got the bride of Christ that has come from the sight of Christ and they are one and the same it's a perfect reflection it's a perfect uh bone of bone life of Life flesh of Flesh it is the same power reflecting in humanity just like it did when Adam was upon earth oh my but brother Brandon would tell us when God rested his enemy would break through the wall and would Mar this masterpiece he would break it so no longer is Adam reflecting eternity but now he's reflecting another land he's reflecting a land of death he's reflecting a land of Sorrow he's reflecting a land of Decay and brother Brandon would say this as I said in the beginning what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here what you are what your Celestial body is up yonder what your Celestial body is somewhere else is what you are reflecting back here in the spirit land what you are is what you are here if you're still vulgar minded so forth in the spirit land you're vulgar minded here if you still got malice Envy Strife in the spirit land with that it reflects back here so the reflection right here is only pointing back to where we are living spiritually and we see when Adam was a was a perfect reflection of God Whenever there was walking in unity his flesh would declare that but after he would fall his flesh would declare something else and the same thing is happening today our flesh is only reflecting where we are living spiritually I don't believe we got to live in a spiritually and a spiritual Amnesia we don't got to live in a hypocritical life but we can live in such a place spiritually that the life of God is reflecting through our life every day of the week not just on Sundays not just on Wednesdays but every day we wake up if you go through a trial go through a hard time we are living in such a place spiritually that our natural life is reflecting where we are spiritually oh Hallelujah and we see that when the children of Israel was in the land of Egypt what did they reflect they reflected bondage and even though they was called to something else they was called to a higher purpose Caleb Joshua and Caleb the the the the the the the great Overcomers Caleb that would say give me my Mountain was living an overcoming are living a defeated life because of where he was dwelling at but once he would change his Dwelling Place once he would get into the promised land his flesh would then start to overcome what God had given him but first he had to get out of the land of bondage and into two US promised land and the reason why many of us can't overcome is because we're still dwelling in the land of bondage we're still Bound by complexes we're still Bound by insecurities and we can't our flesh can't overcome naturally because we're bound spiritually but once we get out of the land of bondage and into the promised land then we can see a reflection The Life of Christ inside of a teenager inside of a mom a daddy whatever you are tonight once you get in the land of Freedom then your flesh starts to reflect the land that you are living in oh Hallelujah then it reflects the land that you're living in Joshua and Caleb that was once slaves are now in their bodies an overcomer oh my so that's why God calls for a total separation and brother Brandon would say this now a total separation from all unbelief and remember Abraham was by Abraham the patriarch was never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what God said to do and he says will never never never be blessed in and have the blessings until we obey what God Said so well God said to do and so before there can be a reflection there has to be a separation and here's the the scripture I quoted earlier in Genesis 13 and 14 and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place what Thou Art northward Southward Eastward Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee I will give it and through thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if am can number the dust of the earth then shall they then so shall thy seat also be numbered arise and walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it to thee so after the separation come The Possession after the separation God would say hey this is all of yours go explore it but first there had to be a separation and brother brandom says oh that's what the trouble with Christians today you are air of all things well brother if I bought a house or something and you give or somebody gave me a house I'll go through every room in it I'll go down in the basement I'll go in the garage I want to know what I own and that's the way it was when I got saved these are God's promises so I just went through them and claimed every one of them they're mine oh my so if we're separated this evening stand up with the boldness and see every promise is mine my children are mine my family is mine a renewing is mine Revival for this church is mine a Revival for my children or mine you see once you are separated there's no more condemnation to the things of the world once you're separated you can come with the boldness uh there's a there's a certainty that no matter what I ask for there's no condemnation that is keeping me from the Throne of God oh Hallelujah so Footprints mean possession so start walking in what God has given us so it's more than just a form it's a reality this like our Pastor said this morning we can have the form of a message but we want the message to come into reality and take on flesh CU you see there's a difference in the reflection and the shadow the shadow you have a form but a reflection you have a person and that is something that just really stood out to me if this message is just a form all you have as a shadow but if the message becomes a reality then you have the person Jesus Christ not a form not a type not a shadow but the reality of the supernatural God inside of your life cuz you see the the blood of bulls and goats were types and shadows of the Redeemer but there was no authority to dismiss their sins it was just a form so they would come before before the Tabernacle and to the Tabernacle before the altar as a form and a ritual and would say Lord forgive me of my sins but then they will leave that place with the same desire there was no reflection of the power of God but once Christ would come he wasn't a shadow of the Redeemer it was the person the Redeemer himself and brother Brandon would say it was the perfect Masterpiece all the types of the Old Testament was now met in him so when Christ come it wasn't a form it was a reality it wasn't a form of saying Lord forgive me of my sins but now there was a reality to break the curse of a sin nature that we could reflect not the form of bulls and goats but the reality of the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's where we're standing today not in a form not in a ritual not with the Creed but with the person the realities of Jesus Christ I say let's explore what this message has done for us let's explore this revival let's explore the Deliverance that God has given us in this generation oh it's a reflection of the Supernatural is being reflected in our life today amen oh Hallelujah and when Satan broke this masterpiece in the garden brother Brandon would say God wasn't willing to leave a face down and ruined but he would work he would he would work back to back he would go back to work and build another Masterpiece another reflection and brother Brandon would say he would start with Abraham he would start with the with the Patriarchs and because you remember where the brandom says the Michelangelo would build by a pattern and this is how God would start to work on his Masterpiece was by a pattern and brother Brandon would say that this masterpiece he would start with the foundation Abraham Faith Isaac love Jo Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection and then brother brandom says then he moves to the body and he says and the prophets were the word brother brandom says so there was the foundation and then the word would start to make up the body and then he says the head would come Christ would come and then it would be another Masterpiece but you see it was no longer when Christ come it was no longer types but then it was the reality but the Brandon would say this and and then come finally the great head the head of it all the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation laid by the patriarch but the the the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all Jesus came on the scene then when this headpiece was put on it we find him the entire handiwork of God we find in him the perfect reflection of the word of God for the word and the for he was the word the fullness of the word now began God has the perfect Masterpiece again so Abraham had a portion Isaac had a portion Jacob had a portion Joseph had a portion the prophets all had portions but when Christ come it was the fullness of what everybody had in one body Abraham had faith and there stood the faith of God Isaac had love there stood the love of God Jacob had Grace there stood the grace of God Joseph had Perfection there stood Perfection so all of these types was pointing to something of a reality then Christ would come there was no longer a type but now there was a reality oh Hallelujah and I like how brother Brandon puts it he says Michelangelo would strike the knee of that sculpture and say speak to me speak and brother Brandon would say there was no life in it to speak back but when God created his Masterpiece he would step into the Masterpiece and give it life that it could speak back to him oh Hallelujah so when Christ come there stood a reality brother would say he was The Rock in the wilderness and the Bible would say if you drink of this water reality you'll never thirst again the Bible would say that Jesus would look at the preachers and say your father ate of the man in the wilderness and their everyone dead they were living under a type but then Jesus would say if you eat of the bread of life then you will never hunger again he was bringing a reality that was destroying the type that we should have a reflection oh Hallelujah I hope this is making sense this evening brother Brandon would say this here all the prophets had flaws all the ones was the portion but here at last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no Faults in him at all so perfectly reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his own work God and Christ was one H so much and put his own Spirit into him that even the image and the Builder had become one oh Hallelujah so here stood Christ here stood Christ and like I said last time brother Brandon would say when God unveiled himself Christ was sitting there on the cross has The Mercy Seat but nobody could see him they was blinded by their form they was blinded by the type and brother Brandon would say they would be singing Psalms 22 they pierced my hands they pierced my feet they did these things and brother brandom says the one they were singing about was sitting there on the cross but because of the form they could not see reality oh and I'm going to change that a little bit now we could have a form of godliness and deny the realities of the gospel because of a form we could come the church out of Duty we could come the church out of a ritual and we start to become the church as a form instead of a reality and we'll never see the power of the Gospel but if we change it from a type or from a form into a reality then we can see the demonstration of the Gospel in every one of our Lives oh Hallelujah he stands today as the same yesterday today and forever not a type not a form but the person and you see remember brother brandom talks about the chines laundries they would take a little card and would tear it up you would keep one piece and they would keep one piece PE and he says then if you would come back and I like that brother Brandon how he tells the story he says in order to redeem your dirty laundry you got to take that piece with you and then you would match the two pieces together in order to redeem your da your dirty laundry and brother Brandon would say you couldn't impersonate it there was only one way to do it that was for the two to Dov tail and brother brandom says this therefore the China man you could claim where the law condemns you and says that you were dirty you were guilty and you could put you in the prison but when he came he was the match piece for it that you could that could take you out and bring you back to the complete ticket the Redemption that God had promised in the Garden of Eden and so when Christ come he was the missing piece that could bring the total Redemption to her life and just like the China man would have your dirty laundry and in order to redeem it the two pieces had to match together and when Christ come it was the word and his life would Dove tell together that would bring forth full Redemption that the dirty laundry could be redeemed but you notice if you would drop your laundry off it was dirty but once it was redeemed it was no longer dirty it was clean and once we went into sins we was dirty but once Christ come and redeemed us back we're no longer dirty but we're clean by the blood of Christ We Stand blameless we stand all of our sins in the SE of God's forgetfulness but brother Brandon would say that Redemption was promised in the Garden of Eden and here stood the match piece and that match pie this match peace would take a condemned Son of God and redeem him back and brother Brandon would say this and when and when God when he looked upon him he was so inspired to see him the way he looked and to see the form of him he was so inspired that it would be a perfect Master Masterpiece of a redeemer Jesus the Redeemer so God in order to be submitting himself to pay the price to pay his own penalty God and Christ become one so that he could be Smit so he could be smoted in that image he could be scarred and that's why Isaiah said we did esteem him smitten and Afflicted of God yet he was wounded for transgressions he was bruised for iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed so in order for Redemption to happen the Masterpiece had to be smitten and brother Brandon would say just like just like um um Michelangelo would Smite the Smite His Image and it would break off he said Christ Our God would Smite would Smite Christ in order for Redemption to take place and there which stood a reflection of redemption then the promise of scripture would be fulfilled he would smitten and Afflicted of God he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed no longer a type but a reality oh Hallelujah and that's why a lot of people have a hard time reflecting the message is because it not it's not a reality it's just a form but you see the the when Christ come he was built up by the word and that broke the type and brought forth reality and you see brother Brandon as I said earlier there was reading Psalms 22 that pierced my hands pierced my feet and this was happening happening right there in their very mited but they were blinded by it because of their form and the Bible would say in 2 Timothy 3 and 5 excuse me three and five having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from turn away and so having a form denies the realities of it brother Brandon would say take example now of Mana from Heaven God sent down Angel bread from Heaven to Israel but the bread did not satisfy it was only good for a day those who ate were hungry again the next day it was left around and it become contaminated but Jesus is the true bread from Heaven whereof Mana was a type and if any man eats of the bread that come from Heaven he will never hunger again he does not need to come back and eat again the moment he partook he had eternal life here indeed was reality no longer in need for a shadow no need for a partial salvation here was the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a part of God he is God so brother Brandon was saying whenever reality come it broke the form and you see when God unveiled himself there's no longer longer uh we don't need to live in a shadow we don't need to live in a form of victory that only last so long we don't need to live in a form of happiness that only last so long or a form of peace that only last so long but now there is a reality that we can grab a hold of Peter had a form but there was no lasting effect to it but once he overcome his own desires overcome his own makeup and got reality it changed his reflection but once it moved from a form to reality it was a different Peter and brother Brandon would say this denying the word in forms of godliness denying the power of His word how can he place a blessing upon that he can't do it he sure won't we got to come back to the real thing so we got to move from a form to the reality for the blessings to come upon us oh Hallelujah I hope this is making sense tonight I was I didn't have it all put together just perfect so I hope it's making some kind of sense tonight you got to come from a for to reality for the blessings of God to fall upon us and I like how the the Bible would tell us in Matthew 9:17 neither do men put new wine into Old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runthe and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and are both preserved and brother Brandon would say this used to stump him until he'd done missionary work and he said because we think of bottles as glasses you know but he says over there the bottles that Jesus is talking about ain't glass but it's skins he says it's skins that are tanned and they're sewed together and they would put oil in them they would put water in them they would put uh they would put a wine in them but you see they would carry these things but once the skin would get old it would dry up and once it would dry up it could still carry water it could still carry oil but it couldn't carry wine and brother Brandon would say it was because the wine had life in it and as it would start I forget the word he used fated maybe he says as it would start to do that it would start to expand and he says that those old skins would be too dry and whenever that life would start to take place it would break up and the wine would pour out and the bottle would be destroyed and I think oh my that's why many people can't have keep the victory they can't keep a Victorious Life is because they're old and DED up and when the life of God comes on the inside their life expands and they explode up but you see water down religion is just fine the oil is just fine they put water in there but the brandom says they could keep water because there was no life he was dead but the wine that had life would break it up but all you need is a new bottle and brother Brandon would say the new skins still had oil from the animal on it and when the wine starts to furminate the oil pushes out and the skin start to expand it wouldn't break but it would start to expand and brother brandom says that's the way it is when you're olded by the Holy Ghost when the word comes in you start to expand you push out the things of doctrines that ain't of the word you push out theology you start to expand because we're oiled by the Holy Ghost and brother brandom says put the new wine in an old bottle you say now our school teach is different or denomination that old cow that old dry cow hide our teachers our Pastor said these things are finished but if it's a new hide it's got new life in it excuse me it's flexible and it gives to the word and the word supports the spirit or the spirit supports the word and when they come into the new bottle and they say someone got healed of cancer last evening the old height says let me see what the doctor says let me see a year from now I just can't believe it but the new heights say Hallelujah to the lamb it spreads out then both wine and bottle is kept then brother Brandon would say that's what we need today is the church the church needs an oiling a holy spirit oiling oh man the Bible would tell us hurt not the oil and the wine and you see brother the brand would say the oil is the Holy Ghost and the wine is the stimulation of Revelation and so once the oil is inside it expands and it's ready for the word to come inside of it you see then we can keep the victory then we can keep an overcoming life but you see we got to give the room word or room to work the word room to work we got to give the message room to work and you see Abraham was just to be a reflection of what deity could do cuz after Adam had fallen the Covenant between God and man was broken and you see and God would come and take Abraham a fallen human being and would reflect deity in it and I just love how how this was jumping out to me it was it was because of a fallen condition that Abraham couldn't have children because we know that the children wasn't supposed to come by sex but was going to come by the spoken word but because of a fallen condition he wasn't able to have children but then God deity would come to a fallen humanity and would reflect the promise inside of his womb oh he would take the curse and turn it into a blessing it was because of the curse he couldn't have children but then the Bible would tell us how be it our God has turned the curse into a blessing and so deity would come to Fallen humanity and would give a portion of himself to Abraham in order for there to be a reflection of the blessing and but and our pastor talked about it last Sunday he was taken the last the last letters of Elohim and were plac it upon Abram Abraham and so now deity was coming inside of humanity to produce the promised word for that generation to produce the promised child and brother Brandon would say then he changed his name from Abram to Abraham and ham was the part of God's name did you notice that did it ever soak in Abraham Elohim he was the part of God's name because God is the father of all and he made his name being Elohim he put a part of his name with Abraham and made him a partner with him through his seed he would bring forth the seed and bless every nation in the earth he would be the father of many nations Abraham would reproduce the faith of Elohim he would reproduce the faith of Elohim and brother Brandon would tell us the the foundation that Christ was built upon was Abraham Jacob all these other things and it was faith that Abraham would have how did he get this Faith because Elohim deity would come and pour out blessings upon Abraham oh Hallelujah so this was the blessing that was being poured out upon Abraham was deity coming inside of humanity it was after his name was changed that his body was changed it was after his name was changed that the promised child would come to pass it was after his name was changed changed that he would see Jehovah Gyra my provider but it was after deity would come and Fallen Humanity that he would see the results in his life oh when little church deity has come once again and Fallen Humanity to bring forth the word and reflect the promised word for this generation oh Hallelujah you see Abraham would get a portion of his name but the bride in this generation has got all of God's name we are Christ we are we are M Jesus Christ you see Abraham got the last part the last four letters of Elohim but this bride has got all of Jesus Christ Living inside of her if nothing could keep Abraham from fulfilling the word what about this bride Abraham went through discouragement Abraham went through depression Abraham went through scoffers and Skeptics but he stood he still stood with the promised child at the end of the day with only a portion of Elohim what about the Bride of today you might go through hard times you might go through depression you might go through insecurities but all of God has been poured out into into human in humanity today to bring forth the promised word to bring forth the reflection of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah it was the blessing of God that we be poured out upon Abraham that that he could see the reflection and God has stepped into this bride the blessing of God has come inside of this bride first Peter 3 and9 not wender rendering evil for evil or raing for for raing but but contz blessing knowing that year there unto called that you should inherit a blessing and since we're called we are called to inherit the blessing of God and what is this blessing that you're talking about brother Josh the Bible would tell us that as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy a notd for a blessing is in it so a blessing is in the new wine what did the 120 get in the upper room was a new wine it was the spirit of God coming to humanity and then they would reflect you see brother Brandon would say this and the body of Christ is one Spirit where every member from Pentecost to this time drinks of the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same results how do we do it by one spirit it's God's Open Door the Holy Spirit what is it it's God's open door it's a sign it's a seal it's a comforter it's an advocate an assurance a rest a peace it's goodness it's healing it's life it's God's open door to all of these things and what is opening the door to all of these things the blessing of God the new wine of God Elohim coming in Humanity opens the door to a real peace not a type not a form but a piece of reality that passes all understanding if we wake up in a bad mood we got reality if we wake up on the wrong side of the bed we got reality if we're shaking our body we got reality because the blessing of God has been poured out upon us amen hallelujah it's God's open door it's God's open door it's a CH it's a comforter it's an assurance it's a rest all of these things are because the blessing of God is bringing forth the results oh my just like when Abraham got the blessing it brought the results through his flesh and brother Brandon would saying I thank when you see the power of God sweep through meeting it means that Jesus Christ is living somewhere hallelujah it's the same holy ghost power that raised them up on the day of Pentecost and give them the blessing of God that power power is still existing somewhere amen he says thy power is still existing somewhere and I say it's right here this is where the blessing is still existing still existing he never runs out of it he never runs out of the Holy Ghost like I like I said last time whenever Elisha would come to the widow woman's house and would say hey go get some empty vessels it didn't matter how many empty vessels they would bring in as long as empty vessels was be being called he still had enough oil and the Bible says he had a little cup of oil but that cup of oil would fill all of the empty vessels and all that was in God he poured in the Christ and all that was in Christ he's poured into empty vessels he didn't run out on the day of Pentecost he didn't run out at Aus the street but if there're still empty vessels that he is calling if there's new bottles that is standing here today God is still pouring out deity to be a reflection in the midst of humanity oh Hallelujah he's still coming in humanity he's turned the curse into a blessing how could how could Abraham be such a patriarch of faith without the curse yeah you know how could Abraham reflect the power of deity if if Sarah wasn't Barren you know how could these things take place and how could we reflect deity and Humanity if it wasn't for the curse of humanity but it was the curse of humanity that put us under the rule of sin put us under the rule of addictions put us under the rule of Satan that Elohim would pour himself out into that humanity and turn the curse into a blessing oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say this he know what he was talking about so that's the reason he wasn't afraid of Goliath it wasn't the rock that David had in the sling that killed Goliath it wasn't the sling that he had in his hand that killed Goliath it wasn't the stones that he had in his pocket that did it it was the hidden power the blessing of God so that's what I'm talking about what is this blessing you shall be a blessing I will bless your family I will bless you I'll make you a great nation I Will Bless You The Blessing was Elohim coming into Abraham and him reflecting it and here David was a reflection of the blessing the hidden power that God put on the inside that's why he could stand against Goliath stand against the bear stand against the lion he had something on the inside that was just reflecting on the inside oh that's what God needs today is somebody so full of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that in every situation you reflect deity in every circumstance you reflect deity oh Hallelujah it was the hidden power the blessing of God when David let loose what he had God took it and blessed it with the hidden power so it wasn't David it wasn't the stone it wasn't the slingshot it was the blessing that was on David that slew the enemy and you know that just struck me when I read that earlier when David let loose of what he had God took it and blessed it with the hidden power when David let loose of it then God could work sometimes that's the hardest thing to do is to let loose you want to see your children saved let loose you want to see your marriage fixed let loose you want to see a Revival in your family let loose then the same hidden power that was inside of David would then come out to a circumstance oh Hallelujah see God didn't just want to live in humanity and not move in any circumstances but the same hidden power that was inside of David would start to move in the circumstance that he was given to God and if you give your depression to God you give your trials to God you let loose of those complexes watch the hidden power start to move out of you and work inside of that circumstance oh it was the blessing that was on David that slew the enemy oh my God has given us the blessing to slay your enemies but you got to let go brother brandom says God can't fight your battle if you're fighting get yourself see just just let loose and let him do it just committ it to him the greatest weapon that I know of of a Christian today is committed to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it he says that's the greatest weapon to a Christian today is committal to God when you can't do it when you can't get under brother brandom I think well the greatest experiences he had of had of God I believe he said I think that's the wording was when he couldn't get under it he couldn't get over it he couldn't get around it but God would take him through it that was the greatest experience when he couldn't do it when hum when H when hum human ability couldn't get through it when human nature couldn't get through it when human ability couldn't make it through complexes and depression but there was something on the inside that would say God I'm giving it to you the battle's not mine but it's yours sayith Little David I can't do these things but the hidden power on the inside I'm committing it to you oh Proverbs 11:1 by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted the blessing is exalting oh my that's what has exalted us he's the blessing it's not us exalting oursel it's the blessing of God that has exalted us where we're marching over Giants leaping over walls running through a troop going through every Goliath every fiery furnace the blessing of God has exalted us where we are a mighty conqueror oh Hallelujah in other words that exalted city is just reflecting the blessing that exalted it and my that's what God wants is somebody so humble that can say when I couldn't do it he done it give God the glory not you give God the glory if you prayed for somebody and God healed it that Glory goes to God if you overcome depression the glory goes to God God is exalting a people so that they could look back and say it was because of the blessing the blessing of God this new wine has come and shine of this humanity and is reflecting the power of the wine brother Brandon would say Jeremiah took the word of the Lord the wine of his word and the wine is the power of His word wine has a power wine is intoxication wine has got power behind it and I took the Lord's word said Jeremiah and made manifest the wine the power that's in it I exercised it before them oh I just love that I exercised it I took the wine of his word the power of it and I exercised it before them and and the scripture would show the people didn't listen to me they didn't listen to the word being exercised and I think my is the same thing today here we are the blessing of God has coming to a people and we're we're we're exercising the power of the word and the and the people still won't listen to it but there's somebody that is listening to it Amen brother Brandon would say he was so filled with the Welsh Revival till he was the Welsh Revival we ought to be so filled with Christ till we reflect him in the power of His word that's alloted to us today oh my we got to be so filled till we reflect the allotted word for today oh my brother brandom talks about the woman who licked radium and I'm sure we we all remember the story and it was it was and that that lady lick radium that was for watches and clocks and it would kill her and brother Brandon would tell that it was years later that they would take the scar bone of that woman and put it next to a watch and the watch would work it was the life of that radium that was still in that body all it needed was something compatible the radium wouldn't work with the tree it wouldn't work with the microphone or it wouldn't work for for a car but it needed something that was compatible and once it come and contact with something compatible the life of that radium would reflect itself oh mind this word has come to somebody that was compatible it was he it didn't work on the denominations it wouldn't work with the prostitutes it would have work with the horse system but it come to humanity that was in a fallen condition that was compatible he's come to a fallen human being this bride was compatible the Brandon would say it was word calling to word word responding to word he talks about the eagle he says when Mama Eagle would fly across the chicken pin and she would scream out he said it was Eagle responding to Eagle it was that eagle looking up and saying that's where I come from that's my identification and he says when the word come across your life it was word responding to word it was somebody that was compatible it was somebody that had a had a g seat on the inside that would say that's where I come from Hallelujah that's my reflection that's my identification that's who I am yeah but the word is only compatible with the word the predestinated seed come from the word so when this word come by the seed cried out the seed cried just like a little that the little Eagle he had to take a baby step he had to jump up on the upon Maybe Upon a rock on a post then he would get up on the side of the barn then we get on top on top of the barn it was a drawing and attraction saying come up higher come up higher you're called to be a reflection oh my this word come across their path and said come up higher come up high you're made to be my masterpiece you're on Earth to be my master peace yeah brother brandom says this now the smiting of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride that he might take him a bride so his Masterpiece was perfected that he had then he had to Smite it and take from him not another piece not another creation but the same creation my brother don't think bad at this but think a minute he if if it if it took from him the original creation to make the bride for him he never made another creation he took a part of the original then if he was the word what must this bride be it's got to be the original word the Living God in the word let musicians come Hallelujah brother brandom says if he didn't take another creation but took a part of the original then what must this bride be the word what was Jesus the word that's what this bride is to be another Masterpiece oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say thisise near for now for nearly 2,000 years God has have been again making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam a piece off of him part of him to make a to make a wife for him and now the perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's in the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled so the new and the old is husband and wife and it take the new to to to took the old to foreshow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece in the making in other words Christ had his scripture to fulfill now the bride has got h scripture to fulfill you've got the Rapture you've got the body change but just like Christ fulfilled his partu you're going to fulfill your part don't get discouraged don't get weary and wello you've got a part to play Oh Hallelujah brother the random says and it as it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now it's been nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece and so doing it he does it by his never changing method the same way he made the Masterpiece his word that's the way he makes his masterpieces because it's only it can only be a perfect Masterpiece if it's the perfect word oh my it's the perfect word that us created the perfect Masterpiece amen amen what are you playing brother Kobe bless Lord the pool the pool let me
