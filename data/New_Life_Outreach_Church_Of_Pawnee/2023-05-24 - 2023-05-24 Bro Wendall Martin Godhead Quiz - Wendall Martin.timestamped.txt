[36:58] we're going to be dealing with a godhead
[37:00] tonight and I I uh so number one I want
[37:04] you to know uh who you uh why we believe
[37:08] what we believe and you need to have
[37:10] scripture for it you need to be able to
[37:13] um there's only one needing a Bible
[37:15] while I'm talking
[37:16] amen

[37:34] going to get you one
[37:36] Robert Angel oh hey and and actually
[37:40] yeah no we're not looking these things
[37:43] up with tablets tonight now
[37:47] brother William
[37:50] oh my word you bring you don't bring
[37:54] that thing that you that you've already
[37:56] that you've been playing games and
[37:57] everything on you gotta bring your Holy
[37:59] Bible
[38:00] okay
[38:05] um all right so so first of all you
[38:08] always bring your sword to church Amen
[38:10] brother Michael always bring your sword
[38:12] to church brother Michael learned that
[38:13] early on as a kid
[38:16] and so hey we're almost to the point
[38:21] look at here we've got Bibles amen you
[38:24] know he's expecting a bunch of you not
[38:26] to have your Bibles
[38:28] and so um
[38:34] you've got a testimony
[38:37] okay go right ahead Fresca's got a
[38:40] testimony
[38:50] praise the Lord that's that's awesome
[38:52] Hallelujah
[38:55] amen
[38:57] Okay so
[38:58] I we want we want to now I want you guys
[39:02] not to just turn there but if you've got
[39:04] a pin or something Mark some of these in
[39:07] in the if you got a tablet uh but uh but
[39:10] I want us to know why we believe now
[39:14] I've put some scriptures together and
[39:16] I'm I'm hoping I'm putting them in order
[39:18] now
[39:19] um
[39:20] um
[39:21] and to to where we can
[39:24] um uh it I want you to see the the
[39:29] Oneness of God in the in the body of
[39:32] Jesus Christ and I I want you to see it
[39:35] that you in the scripture and but I
[39:38] don't want you just taking my word for
[39:40] it so what we're what we're going to do
[39:42] now I think that number one he that wins
[39:47] Souls the scripture says is what
[39:50] wise now imagine they're they're in
[39:53] Colossians 4 and 5 it says walk in
[39:56] wisdom toward them that are without
[39:59] Redeeming the time
[40:01] let your speech be always with Grace
[40:04] seasoned with salt that ye may know how
[40:08] ye ought to answer every man
[40:12] in order to know what you're how to
[40:14] answer every man you need to know what
[40:16] you're talking about
[40:18] now when we talk about when we listen
[40:20] there is not a greater revelation
[40:23] than to than this Revelation that God
[40:27] became flesh to save you
[40:31] he did not just save you but that but
[40:35] God is now in another body he's in you
[40:38] through the same spirit that was in
[40:41] Christ amen now so so we want to uh
[40:45] there in First Peter 3 and 5 it says
[40:48] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts be
[40:51] ready always to give an answer to every
[40:56] man that asketh you a reason of the hope
[40:59] that is in you with meekness and fear
[41:01] having a good conscience that whereas
[41:04] they speak evil of you as evildoers they
[41:08] may be ashamed that falsely accuse your
[41:12] good conversation in Christ so so
[41:15] there's going to be a lot of people who
[41:17] don't understand you and they're going
[41:19] to be a lot of people that talk about
[41:20] you they talk about our church
[41:23] they call us whatever and and that and
[41:26] and that would hurt my feelings amen uh
[41:29] if if it wasn't based on Bible but we
[41:32] everything we have is based on Bible
[41:37] and I want to say if we turn it around
[41:40] and start asking them about their belief
[41:43] system well
[41:45] amen if you can't back it up with Bible
[41:48] then they are the cult
[41:50] amen you're following a man we follow
[41:54] Jesus Christ the word
[41:56] amen and that Revelation amen so then
[41:59] there and before we get started there in
[42:01] second Timothy 2 and 14 it says of these
[42:04] things put them in remembrance charging
[42:06] them before the Lord that they strive
[42:08] not about words to no Prophet but to sub
[42:12] uh to the subverting of the hearers
[42:13] study to show thyself approved unto God
[42:18] a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[42:21] rightly dividing the word of Truth is
[42:26] that right
[42:27] now I'll tell you
[42:29] um brother Branham says the Oneness of
[42:31] God is all the way from Genesis 1 and 1
[42:35] to Revelations 22 1. but the people have
[42:38] been so Blinded By An unscriptural dogma
[42:40] of a trinity and the Dogma is so
[42:43] universally accepted that to try to see
[42:46] a one God person is all but impossible
[42:49] if people can't see the truth of the
[42:53] godhead but fight it they can't ever see
[42:57] the rest of the truth because the
[42:59] Revelation is Jesus Christ in his church
[43:03] and his works in the midst of The Seven
[43:08] Ages and so these are that this is
[43:11] something that I I thought as we're as
[43:14] we're beginning to start going into
[43:16] Revelations and and we dealt a little
[43:18] bit with the and and the Beast the
[43:21] uh the other day and um now I now listen
[43:24] I asked for folks to give me uh
[43:27] questions if you were in the slightest
[43:30] bit confused I mean Austin says listen I
[43:32] didn't even I I quit taking notes and I
[43:35] just started writing questions you lost
[43:36] me at the beginning amen and
[43:40] and so if if you've got questions
[43:44] especially when we start when we start
[43:46] getting into these things hey I I would
[43:49] rather have class participation because
[43:51] if I'm if if I'm confusing you then
[43:53] we're not doing any good so you got to
[43:55] just you got to say hey hey
[43:58] um I'll start over amen and then and
[44:00] then we'll we'll see we'll see what we
[44:02] can do because
[44:03] um some of these things are are very
[44:06] important and I want us all to catch
[44:08] them so if you're not catching it amen
[44:11] throw your hand up and say hey but you
[44:14] know or what or something like that can
[44:17] you say Matt so I
[44:19] I
[44:19] um okay so this is uh sister go ahead
[44:22] and put that first one up
[44:24] now what we're going to do we're just
[44:25] going to sort of make this uh we're
[44:27] going to divide this one up and whoever
[44:29] finds whoever finds the answer first let
[44:33] you just let us know we're not keeping
[44:35] score or anything tonight and we're
[44:37] definitely not wanting this to get out
[44:38] of control like like we did at Christmas
[44:40] amen and uh but but I want us to
[44:44] um
[44:46] amen so so we we have it here that God
[44:52] created and lived in the body of Jesus
[44:55] Christ
[44:56] he mediated as a human
[44:59] what scripture where is this found for
[45:02] there is one God and one mediator
[45:05] between God and man the man Christ Jesus
[45:09] now if you boys want to go with some of
[45:12] the elders and you you and you girls too
[45:15] want to get with some of the others and
[45:17] let them show you how to find that
[45:18] there's a concordance in the back of
[45:20] your Bibles that that'll um and this is
[45:23] one of the reasons why I'm wanting to do
[45:24] it all right
[45:25] you've got it
[45:33] [Music]
[45:39] Hallelujah
[45:41] Okay so
[45:43] well that what what how well that's
[45:46] going to do you amen
[45:48] okay so that is
[45:51] all right so that was what
[45:54] that is two that is first Timothy 2 5.
[45:57] so mark that down make make sure and
[46:00] make sure you're writing this down this
[46:02] this these are incredible scriptures
[46:04] that we're going to be studying if
[46:05] anyone wants any markers if you want to
[46:07] if you want to mark your scriptures here
[46:08] I've got I've got some highlighters in
[46:10] here if someone wants to use one which
[46:13] which color do you want
[46:16] I want my I want my highlighters back
[46:18] amen
[46:19] you want green now now put it on the
[46:22] side of it just in case it it might be
[46:24] too dark
[46:32] all right I've got two more left
[46:38] these guys already asked
[46:43] as I say I don't know how dark those are
[46:45] going to be on the on the deal there so
[46:48] oh we've got we've got a couple more
[46:49] here
[46:51] one more two more you okay
[46:55] who was that with each these two were
[46:57] asking for them while ago
[46:59] all right so
[47:00] all right so here now now I want you to
[47:04] we got to see this God created
[47:08] a blood cell in the womb of a of of a
[47:13] virgin
[47:14] and then God lived in the body of Jesus
[47:18] Christ it was not there is no no such a
[47:22] thing as the Eternal Sun there it don't
[47:28] make sense
[47:29] a son is begotten a son is born there is
[47:35] no such thing as the trinitarians put it
[47:38] Eternal sin no that's not scriptural
[47:42] there is an eternal God who created a
[47:46] body and that body became uh is now the
[47:52] dwelling place of the Eternal God and
[47:55] there's only one God you'll ever see and
[47:58] that is Jesus Christ he lives in the
[48:01] body of Jesus Christ now again anything
[48:06] you all want want to do this you just
[48:08] you just go ahead and let's go to the
[48:09] next one sister keys
[48:11] amen
[48:14] and so yet he so he mediated as God
[48:19] as man but then he also mediated as God
[48:25] that's not going to quite work hey that
[48:28] no no that didn't do it amen he was
[48:31] almost there right there right right
[48:33] there okay so now all right answer this
[48:36] question whoever can find that I've
[48:37] given you exactly where it's at to with
[48:40] that blank was in Christ
[48:43] reconciling the blank blank not imputing
[48:47] their trespasses unto them hath
[48:50] committed unto us the word of
[48:53] reconciliation
[48:59] yes you got you gotta fill in the blank
[49:12] Amen to wit that God was in Christ
[49:18] reconciling the world unto himself
[49:26] this is this is big news buddy this is
[49:28] big news we're talking about the very
[49:31] God of all creation is out to redeem
[49:37] amen all right now once God entered into
[49:42] the body of Jesus Christ
[49:44] once you not then you're going to find
[49:47] that that it is synonymous Jesus and the
[49:51] father were synonymous once God moved
[49:53] into that body
[49:54] amen uh uh they're they're in Saint John
[49:58] uh 12 and 44.
[50:03] that next one there sister kalila
[50:06] foreign
[50:08] I'm sorry I gave the answer amen
[50:13] all right go ahead and turn there uh
[50:15] yeah okay
[50:17] so but let's go and turn there anyways
[50:20] Saint John 12 and 44. and Jesus cried
[50:25] and said
[50:26] because they were having a hard time
[50:28] with Jesus Jesus was saying he he he he
[50:31] was saying that that he's the son of God
[50:33] and they're saying God don't have a son
[50:37] you can't the the Eternal God can't have
[50:40] a a body and Jesus cried and said he
[50:43] that believeth on me
[50:46] believeth not on me but on him that sent
[50:52] me
[50:55] amen
[50:56] I I I I messed that one totally I'm all
[50:59] right but on him that sent me so so what
[51:04] we're seeing here amen Jesus is here for
[51:07] one purpose he is the body that God
[51:11] created moved on the inside amen now he
[51:17] you've got to believe that sacrifice of
[51:20] that body
[51:22] amen it was God in Christ all right
[51:26] khalila I I want to look on your report
[51:27] there because I've got my answers all
[51:29] right here amen all right so
[51:33] um
[51:38] all right so Jesus was the invisible
[51:40] God's Earthly image now now Colossians 1
[51:46] and 12.
[51:49] it says giving thanks unto the blank
[51:54] amen
[51:56] which which made us
[51:59] uh uh meet to be partakers of the
[52:02] inheritance of the Saints and light who
[52:04] delivered us from the power of Darkness
[52:08] and translated us into the kingdom of
[52:13] his dear son
[52:15] in whom we have Redemption through his
[52:18] blood even the Forgiveness of sins
[52:22] who is blank blank blank blank blank
[52:26] who is the image
[52:31] of the invisible God
[52:34] now do you see what now I want you to
[52:36] see what is taking place here when Jesus
[52:39] was on Earth it was God coming in
[52:43] for Redemption
[52:45] he created this body to do the work in
[52:49] amen all right
[52:53] praise the Lord we'll go to the next one
[52:54] now amen
[52:57] and um
[53:00] all right
[53:02] what what uh what's what what what book
[53:05] does it say for it please blank blank
[53:08] that in him should all fullness dwell
[53:22] thank you
[53:25] amen it's Colossians that's right what
[53:27] does it say
[53:33] it pleased the father that in him should
[53:37] all fullness dwell
[53:39] are you boys catching it are y'all are
[53:41] y'all able to find the scriptures
[53:43] because if y'all need help get with some
[53:45] of these other guys to help you because
[53:46] I want I this is this is good here too
[53:48] because we're we're in a day of of of uh
[53:51] tablets and uh but I I'd like for you
[53:54] all to know how to find these these
[53:56] scriptures in the back of your uh by
[53:58] using your concordance as well
[54:01] all right another scripture amen
[54:05] there in John 14 and 7. let's go let's
[54:08] let's look at that
[54:11] praise the Lord
[54:19] are you there
[54:23] okay
[54:24] if ye had known me you should have known
[54:28] my father also
[54:30] from henceforth you know him and have
[54:34] seen him
[54:35] Philip saith unto him Lord show us the
[54:38] father and it suffices us
[54:41] Jesus said unto him have I been so long
[54:44] a time with you and yet hast thou not
[54:48] known me Philip he that hath seen me
[54:52] hath blank blank blank
[54:55] hath huh
[54:59] seen the father how sayest thou then
[55:03] show us the father believeth thou not
[55:06] that I'm in the Father the father in me
[55:09] the words I speak unto you I speak not
[55:13] of myself can you say Amen
[55:17] now uh oh or I'm sorry but the father
[55:20] that dwelleth in me he doeth what
[55:24] he doeth The Works amen so now these are
[55:28] these These are are are things I want
[55:31] you to really put down there don't don't
[55:33] we're not blindly following anything
[55:36] you've got to have Bible for what you
[55:38] believe
[55:39] amen see some people think well well we
[55:43] we got to believe in a trinity because
[55:44] it keeps saying Father Son and Holy
[55:47] Ghost those are three dispensations it's
[55:49] three offices of the one god Jehovah
[55:52] above us it was God walking with us now
[55:57] it is God living in US
[55:59] if you don't see that you're missing
[56:01] Redemption this is this is the beauty of
[56:04] redemption we are not wanting to someday
[56:07] achieve we are his sons he lives within
[56:13] us we're his body can you say Amen now
[56:17] so the great is the mystery of godliness
[56:19] uh if you go to that next one God
[56:22] manifest In the Flesh now now there in
[56:24] first Timothy 3 and 16 without
[56:28] controversy
[56:31] great is the mystery
[56:34] of godliness so when you find that
[56:38] you can complete that
[56:47] amen all right that's that's wonderful
[56:51] all right Colossians Colossians 2 and 9.
[56:57] praise the Lord
[57:00] and when you find when you get to
[57:01] Colossians 2 and 9 y'all y'all let me
[57:04] know
[57:05] praise the Lord
[57:08] amen
[57:19] all right who wants to read it
[57:23] Dylan wants to read it
[57:31] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[57:35] the godhead
[57:36] bodily amen
[57:39] so Jesus now you and I have the spirit
[57:43] by measure
[57:45] you you and I just we get we we've got
[57:49] and it and together we we we we are I I
[57:53] might be an ankle you might be a leg
[57:55] we're all together the body of Christ
[57:59] and we all have a portion of the spirit
[58:02] within us
[58:03] Jesus did not have a portion of the
[58:06] spirit now remember on the day of
[58:08] Pentecost cloven tongues of Fire split
[58:11] up amen it was the great Pillar of Fire
[58:13] split up and a portion of God went into
[58:16] to all of the Believers
[58:19] now but Jesus had all of God somebody
[58:25] say oh
[58:26] of God now now let's let's look here
[58:30] at the uh at the next one here let's
[58:32] look here at John 3 and 34. now as again
[58:37] we I didn't do this as we do a quiz to
[58:39] try to I I want I want us to get there
[58:41] and um
[58:43] and and see this because and and and you
[58:47] need to have an answer for yeah I I you
[58:49] know I
[58:50] man there's so much there's so much
[58:52] scripture in the Bible that I'm not even
[58:53] putting in there tonight it's just the
[58:56] the the
[58:57] Redemption and and God God's plan for
[59:01] redeeming you and I it's just from
[59:02] Genesis to Revelation guys amen I'm just
[59:05] putting a few scriptures in here uh that
[59:07] I think would would would uh do good for
[59:11] our young people and for us adults as
[59:13] well but John 3 and 34 for he whom God
[59:18] hath sent
[59:20] speaketh the words of God
[59:23] for God giveth not the spirit blank
[59:28] blank unto him
[59:32] he giveth not the Spirit by measure in
[59:36] other words he's not just giving a
[59:38] little bit he emptied the entire godhead
[59:42] in the body of Jesus Christ
[59:46] and the father loved the son and hath
[59:50] given all things into his hands now this
[59:55] is something uh now I think this one
[59:57] here everyone knows uh uh you know this
[1:00:01] next scripture and um they're in there
[1:00:04] in Isaiah nine and six we could probably
[1:00:06] all Quote it uh without even looking at
[1:00:09] it maybe you wouldn't even have to turn
[1:00:10] to it I wonder if any of you I wonder
[1:00:13] who can finish that without even looking
[1:00:15] at the Bible right now
[1:00:17] For unto us a child is born unto us a
[1:00:20] son is given a senior hand and the
[1:00:22] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:00:24] and his name shall be called
[1:00:32] amen all right wonderful that's that's
[1:00:35] wonderful praise the Lord so who is
[1:00:39] Jesus
[1:00:41] Jesus his name is wonderful
[1:00:45] counselor
[1:00:47] the Mighty God the Everlasting father
[1:00:52] the Prince of Peace
[1:00:56] now this is for unto us a child is born

[1:01:59] I come in my father's name
[1:02:02] ye receive me not
[1:02:06] if another should come in his own name
[1:02:08] him will you receive now see now the
[1:02:13] Oneness the Oneness we're not Oneness
[1:02:16] like the Oneness uh denominations the
[1:02:20] Oneness do not accept the sonship they
[1:02:23] do not accept that Jesus could become uh
[1:02:25] sin they do not accept that they they
[1:02:28] they they they try to and and you can't
[1:02:31] make the Bible I mean it plainly says
[1:02:33] that he has a father
[1:02:36] he has a father but that God lives in
[1:02:42] that body
[1:02:45] amen
[1:02:46] my God lived in that body now
[1:02:50] let's go to the next one there sister
[1:02:51] keys
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:59] for this cause I bow my knees what what
[1:03:02] not did I did I not I'm just giving all
[1:03:05] the answers here
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:09] okay amen all right so Jesus says I come
[1:03:13] in my father's name now here in
[1:03:15] Ephesians 3 and 12 for this cause I bow
[1:03:19] my knees unto the father of our Lord
[1:03:21] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family
[1:03:25] of Heaven and Earth is named amen Jesus
[1:03:30] came in his father's name
[1:03:35] I I tell you
[1:03:40] the father's name is Jesus
[1:03:43] the son's name is thee are synonymous
[1:03:49] when God moved into the body of Jesus
[1:03:54] Christ
[1:03:56] that's right God the spirit that Spirit
[1:03:59] there's only one Spirit we're fixing to
[1:04:01] get into some of that there's only one
[1:04:02] spirit
[1:04:03] there's only one Lord there's only one
[1:04:06] God and he lives in the body
[1:04:10] that flesh of Jesus Amen so yes Jesus
[1:04:15] Took on that that name of which the
[1:04:18] whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[1:04:21] named now people ask
[1:04:24] what Jesus had to come as a savior Jesus
[1:04:27] God is is the great God but then the
[1:04:30] second person of the godhead had had to
[1:04:31] come he's the Savior he's the one that
[1:04:34] had to come down and take care of
[1:04:35] business
[1:04:36] well the scripture says very plainly
[1:04:38] there's only one God and he is the
[1:04:41] savior now let's just look at it here
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:46] to the next one there
[1:04:53] yes that's that's exactly right
[1:04:58] he had to pay the role of a Kinsmen
[1:05:01] Redeemer and here's the deal here's the
[1:05:04] deal
[1:05:05] a Kinsman had to be the one to redeem so
[1:05:08] so if you didn't if you weren't if you
[1:05:10] weren't kin then you couldn't do it now
[1:05:13] here's the double whammy
[1:05:15] because these were God's children God
[1:05:18] Sons and Daughters
[1:05:20] they they come from eternity
[1:05:23] amen and yet here they are in a fallen
[1:05:27] condition Satan's claimed them now as
[1:05:29] his he's the first he's the first of kin
[1:05:31] according to the flesh he's he's that
[1:05:33] next of kin that came before and Boaz
[1:05:35] that that came in and says you know I'll
[1:05:39] redeem them but you see God came down in
[1:05:43] a with a greater cause God had to step
[1:05:46] out of Eternity create a body to do the
[1:05:51] work of a Kinsmen
[1:05:53] God
[1:05:55] could have just said you know just just
[1:05:57] just don't worry about it I'll you know
[1:06:00] the dinosaurs have all been wiped off
[1:06:02] will will let them be wiped off too no
[1:06:04] no no no no no God had Sons he can't
[1:06:08] wipe them off they're real legitimate
[1:06:11] Sons their Spirit of his Spirit they're
[1:06:14] as Eternal as he is eternal but they're
[1:06:17] trapped in sin in a body of decay
[1:06:22] and God says I'm going to get them back
[1:06:25] I'm going to redeem them I'm going and I
[1:06:29] don't care what kind of a hell hole you
[1:06:30] came out of God says I will get to them
[1:06:33] I will not lose one of them they are
[1:06:37] mine
[1:06:39] man Hallelujah now he always was a
[1:06:44] savior
[1:06:46] but he couldn't save
[1:06:48] he couldn't redeem now he would he would
[1:06:50] roll back the Red Sea he would but there
[1:06:52] was no way that anyone could that he
[1:06:55] could even save your soul you couldn't
[1:06:57] be saved unless you paid the price of
[1:07:01] that Kinsmen Redeemer it was going to
[1:07:03] have to take a body to die and go to
[1:07:08] hell
[1:07:10] let's look at this amen
[1:07:13] they're they're in Hosea 13 and 4. I
[1:07:16] guess you've probably already turned
[1:07:17] there by now amen who's got the answer
[1:07:19] to that one
[1:07:28] all right so let's read it together yet
[1:07:30] I am the Lord thy God
[1:07:34] from the land of Egypt Thou shalt know
[1:07:37] no no God but me
[1:07:39] for there is no savior
[1:07:43] beside me amen all right let's go to the
[1:07:46] next one
[1:07:48] praise the Lord
[1:07:49] they're in they're in Isaiah 43
[1:07:53] and 10.
[1:07:56] Hallelujah now whoever gets there the
[1:07:58] first you got to yell it out because
[1:08:01] yeah right
[1:08:03] you're here
[1:08:05] all right Kobe's man he's got you all
[1:08:07] right so Kobe you read it
[1:08:24] the next one
[1:08:31] I even I am the Lord and beside me
[1:08:35] there is no savior
[1:08:40] he's a savior
[1:08:43] but in this spirit
[1:08:46] remaining in the spirit
[1:08:49] he can't he can't redeem you he can't
[1:08:52] redeem you he's got to be kin folk not
[1:08:56] just in the not just in the spirit but
[1:08:59] he's got to be Kinfolk in flesh
[1:09:03] amen now let's look at another one
[1:09:05] praise the Lord
[1:09:07] all right we're at an Isaiah
[1:09:09] does it say tell ye and bring them near
[1:09:12] yea let them take counsel together
[1:09:16] who hath declared from this from this
[1:09:19] from ancient time who have told it from
[1:09:21] that time have not I the Lord there is
[1:09:24] no God else beside me
[1:09:26] a just God and a savior there is none
[1:09:31] beside me look unto me and be ye saved
[1:09:35] all the ends of the Earth
[1:09:37] for I am God and there is none else
[1:09:46] huh
[1:09:48] all right 45 and 21. that's that's
[1:09:51] exactly right amen now it's got some
[1:09:53] more that goes with it just needs to go
[1:09:55] up a little bit more
[1:09:57] I have sworn by myself the word is going
[1:10:01] out of my mouth in righteousness
[1:10:03] and shall not return
[1:10:05] that unto me blank blank blank blank
[1:10:10] huh
[1:10:12] every knee shall bow
[1:10:16] and every tongue shall confess shall
[1:10:20] swear is that right
[1:10:22] but he didn't have a body to bow to
[1:10:27] the savior he was God he was savior but
[1:10:32] he didn't have a body
[1:10:34] let's leave let's see what the Apostle
[1:10:35] Paul says
[1:10:36] amen they're in Philippians 2 and oops
[1:10:41] did I did I did I go beyond that amen
[1:10:46] oh good I didn't give away anything all
[1:10:49] right Philippians 2 and 6. let's all go
[1:10:51] over there real quick
[1:10:55] praise the Lord
[1:11:00] and we're going to go uh Cleveland
[1:11:01] that's going to go from six all the way
[1:11:03] down to 11 here in a minute
[1:11:08] now it's so it's going to show the plan
[1:11:09] here's going to plan God had to take on
[1:11:12] the form of a human being
[1:11:13] he had to live like us he had a hurt
[1:11:15] like us he had to die like us now watch
[1:11:17] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:11:20] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:11:22] made himself of no reputation
[1:11:25] took upon him the form of a servant was
[1:11:28] made in the likeness of men being found
[1:11:31] in the fashion
[1:11:33] as a man he humbled himself become
[1:11:36] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:11:38] the cross
[1:11:40] wherefore God has highly exalted him who
[1:11:46] that body and given him a name which is
[1:11:50] above every name that at the blank blank
[1:11:55] blank every knee should bow
[1:11:59] huh
[1:12:00] at the name of Jesus every knee should
[1:12:05] bow of things in heaven things in Earth
[1:12:08] things under the Earth that every tongue
[1:12:11] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:12:15] to the glory
[1:12:21] oh Hallelujah
[1:12:24] God was able to accomplish
[1:12:29] what he was looking for
[1:12:31] God came
[1:12:33] crafted a body
[1:12:35] moved on the inside of that body
[1:12:39] and he purchased the the Redemption for
[1:12:44] every one of you can you say Amen amen
[1:12:48] now now let's look now you know we'll
[1:12:51] let's we'll just go on
[1:12:53] let's just see what God has done so now
[1:12:54] here he's he's got the body he was born
[1:12:57] and said it'll be God With Us amen then
[1:13:00] Jesus in his Works he's saying hey if
[1:13:03] you can't if you if if he when you see
[1:13:05] when you see the works that I'm doing
[1:13:07] you you've got to believe it as it's
[1:13:09] from God because it's God in my body
[1:13:11] doing these things amen and he's and he
[1:13:14] says and and he says if you know if if
[1:13:16] you just go to the Bible whom you think
[1:13:19] you have eternal life and they're the
[1:13:20] very ones that testify of me he's
[1:13:23] talking about the redeem then he comes
[1:13:25] now here he comes Jesus God there in
[1:13:28] Isaiah is needing a uh he says I am I am
[1:13:32] the Savior and there will come a time
[1:13:35] when the every knee shall bow every
[1:13:37] tongue is going to confess to me the
[1:13:39] Apostle Paul comes in and says here it
[1:13:41] is here's the body to the glory of God
[1:13:45] every knee is going to bow to Jesus now
[1:13:47] let's look at what Jesus says here in in
[1:13:49] uh in the next one
[1:13:51] amen
[1:13:52] now
[1:13:54] and what scripture is this found
[1:13:57] God who at sundry times Hallelujah in
[1:14:02] diverse manner spoken time past unto the
[1:14:05] fathers by the prophets
[1:14:06] and hath in these last days spoken unto
[1:14:09] us by his son whom he hath appointed
[1:14:13] heir of all things
[1:14:18] Hebrews
[1:14:20] Hebrews 1 and 1 that's exactly right
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:23] appointed heir of All Things by whom he
[1:14:27] he made the worlds who being the
[1:14:30] brightness of his glory and the blank
[1:14:34] blank of his person
[1:14:39] being the brightness of his glory and
[1:14:43] the express image of his person and
[1:14:47] upholding All Things by the word of his
[1:14:50] power when he had made by by himself
[1:14:54] purged our sins sat down on the right
[1:14:57] hand of the Majesty on high now the
[1:15:02] Apostle Paul would not be talking about
[1:15:05] this this glory and then and and and and
[1:15:08] and then come in and tell us sitting
[1:15:11] down on the right hand of the Majesty
[1:15:12] then we then we stop and we think well
[1:15:14] oh no well now we got now we've got two
[1:15:17] gods in heaven no no no when the Apostle
[1:15:21] Paul is using the right hand he's
[1:15:23] talking about Authority his son an
[1:15:26] adopted son was placed amen he just
[1:15:30] talked about how he has appointed Heir
[1:15:32] he is up he is appointed as uh uh the
[1:15:36] right hand it in the Bible signifies a
[1:15:39] Authority dominionship adoption
[1:15:43] especially if you look back in the Old
[1:15:44] Testament when they adopted the sons it
[1:15:47] was it was in a day that was set and and
[1:15:50] and and everyone would come and they
[1:15:53] would adopt this son uh and place him
[1:15:56] over the kingdom amen so so we we look
[1:16:01] to that
[1:16:03] let's see
[1:16:04] amen okay so what's the next one there
[1:16:07] sister keys
[1:16:08] praise the Lord

[1:16:18] we sure did we just done that one that's
[1:16:22] the one that had a lot of good stuff in
[1:16:23] it amen
[1:16:25] okay uh let's go on to the next one
[1:16:32] we don't we don't use this uh
[1:16:35] that projector often on on this kind of
[1:16:38] thing and so she's she's having to
[1:16:40] really work with it to get it to do
[1:16:41] something do anything amen
[1:16:43] so
[1:16:45] um
[1:16:46] all right now through that body
[1:16:48] when Jesus because Jesus
[1:16:53] it's a man
[1:16:56] a man I I I I I I want you to really
[1:17:00] catch this now
[1:17:01] God
[1:17:03] took a man
[1:17:06] and placed that man high in the heavens
[1:17:13] now that's the body of God
[1:17:16] and it's showing what he's going to do
[1:17:19] with every one of you mortal beings
[1:17:23] that is coming to bring man and women
[1:17:28] back into that relationship
[1:17:33] it's all God's plan God's so loves
[1:17:38] people
[1:17:39] that God became a mortal man
[1:17:45] and God exalted that body and placed him
[1:17:50] in the highest
[1:17:51] oh he didn't place the Angels the
[1:17:54] scripture says unto which of the Angels
[1:17:56] did he say to sit on my right hand he
[1:17:58] says he took a mortal man matter of fact

[1:18:27] the brightness of his glory the express
[1:18:28] image of his person upholding All Things
[1:18:30] by the power of His a word of his power
[1:18:32] when he had by himself purged our sins
[1:18:36] set down on the right hand of the
[1:18:38] Majesty on high
[1:18:39] being so much better than the angels
[1:18:43] as he hath by Excellence obtained a more
[1:18:47] excellent Name than they were talking
[1:18:50] about Immortal we're talking

[1:23:39] of God to declare I say at this time his
[1:23:42] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:23:45] the justifier of him which believeth
[1:23:49] in Jesus
[1:23:51] well praise the Lord
[1:23:53] amen
[1:23:55] Hallelujah now this is a familiar past
[1:23:58] this next one is a familiar passage of
[1:24:00] scripture
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:03] but where is this found be it known unto
[1:24:06] you all and to all the people of Israel
[1:24:08] that by the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:24:10] Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God
[1:24:13] raised from the dead even by him doth
[1:24:16] this man stand here before you whole
[1:24:18] this is the stone which the builders
[1:24:20] said it not which said not a view
[1:24:23] Builders which has become the head of
[1:24:25] the corner neither is there salvation in
[1:24:28] any other
[1:24:29] for there is blank blank blank under
[1:24:32] Heaven given among men whereby we must
[1:24:35] be saved
[1:24:37] huh
[1:24:40] no other name
[1:24:43] under Heaven Can you say Amen
[1:24:46] all right
[1:24:47] now
[1:24:49] amen
[1:24:50] weak we've got it clear that God is
[1:24:54] Jesus father but I want you to know that
[1:24:57] that God is your father too
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:00] now you you look there uh they're in in
[1:25:05] Matthew
[1:25:06] 23 and 9.
[1:25:08] it says call no man your father upon the
[1:25:11] Earth
[1:25:12] for one is your blank which is in heaven
[1:25:17] that's right amen that's that's that's
[1:25:20] your father which is in heaven you've
[1:25:22] got a Heavenly Father amen all right the
[1:25:25] next one
[1:25:27] I'm sorry if I'm going too fast there
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:31] it says but now
[1:25:34] Our Father we are the clay Thou Art the
[1:25:37] Potter
[1:25:38] and we all are the work of thine hand
[1:25:41] so it's not only Jesus
[1:25:43] father but he's your father but where's
[1:25:46] that found at
[1:25:48] Isaiah 64 and 8 that's exactly right
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:53] Ephesians 4 and 6 oops amen
[1:25:58] finally I got an interesting there where
[1:26:00] you'd have to search a little bit
[1:26:01] amen there's one God
[1:26:04] and father of all who is above all
[1:26:08] and through all
[1:26:10] and in you all
[1:26:13] amen so there's one God and Father
[1:26:16] amen it's above us
[1:26:19] he's in
[1:26:20] he's manifesting can you say Amen now we
[1:26:24] went through this here here some time
[1:26:25] ago but but it I think it Bears who is
[1:26:29] who is the father of of Jesus
[1:26:33] amen is it is it God the father or is it
[1:26:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:26:38] amen it's it's the same thing it's the
[1:26:42] same thing
[1:26:43] and and and you you look there and um uh
[1:26:46] where is that at going to the next one
[1:26:47] there kalila uh Luke 1 35
[1:26:51] amen let's look there at Luke 35 135.
[1:26:56] praise the Lord
[1:27:16] amen and the angel said unto her
[1:27:22] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[1:27:27] and the power of the highest shall
[1:27:30] overshadow thee
[1:27:31] therefore also that Holy thing that
[1:27:34] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:27:37] the son of God
[1:27:39] all right the next one where is it found
[1:27:41] where it says now the birth of Jesus
[1:27:43] Christ was on this wise
[1:27:45] when as his mother Mary was espoused to
[1:27:47] Joseph and before they came together she
[1:27:50] was found with child of the
[1:27:53] Holy Ghost Now where's that found at
[1:27:56] Matthew that's right amen
[1:27:59] all right if you're going down to the
[1:28:01] 20th verse
[1:28:03] uh
[1:28:05] well there I go again but while he
[1:28:08] thought on these things behold the angel
[1:28:10] of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream
[1:28:13] saying Joseph thou son of David fear not
[1:28:17] to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[1:28:19] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:28:23] Ghost
[1:28:24] now you see
[1:28:26] you you to me it's a lot harder to make
[1:28:29] a trinitarian Doctrine out of out of
[1:28:33] out of the Bible
[1:28:35] than it is to just accept that God is
[1:28:38] manifesting himself in three offices
[1:28:42] same one God it's the same God but he is
[1:28:47] manifesting himself he's come with the
[1:28:50] with with with the verbiage of of son so
[1:28:54] that you as a being a mortal man can
[1:28:58] identify with what God is doing
[1:29:02] he is he is trying to get you to
[1:29:05] understand he brings it down to our
[1:29:07] level to where we can understand and and
[1:29:10] I want you and again
[1:29:12] you are a son of God I'm not talking
[1:29:16] about I'm not talking about a Son of God
[1:29:18] uh because you're going to church you
[1:29:21] also were in the mind of God before the
[1:29:24] foundation of the world
[1:29:27] and there were you had to be redeemed
[1:29:31] amen praise the Lord amen so uh uh now
[1:29:37] let's look here at this spirit for just
[1:29:39] a moment the Bible says they're in
[1:29:41] Ephesians 4 and 4. if you want to turn
[1:29:43] that
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:48] praise the Lord
[1:30:01] Ephesians 4 and 4 there is one body
[1:30:05] and
[1:30:06] one Spirit even as you are called in one
[1:30:11] hope of your calling on up
[1:30:15] amen First Corinthians 12 and 13.
[1:30:20] praise the Lord
[1:30:22] now I think we we want to we want to see
[1:30:24] this here now I'm fixing to show you
[1:30:26] here in a minute
[1:30:27] how that okay the the the the spirit of
[1:30:30] Christ
[1:30:31] the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit
[1:30:34] I'm fixing to show you scriptures where
[1:30:36] they are all synonymous they all work
[1:30:39] right in together the Apostle Paul uses
[1:30:42] it many times
[1:30:44] and and
[1:30:45] um and and I'll show you there's one God
[1:30:49] one spirit
[1:30:50] amen
[1:30:52] now so it says uh First Corinthians 12
[1:30:55] and 13 it says for blank blank blank
[1:31:01] four by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:31:06] into one body whether we be Jews or
[1:31:08] Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and
[1:31:11] have been made to drink in two one
[1:31:15] spirit
[1:31:16] amen now let's look at the Spirit what
[1:31:19] is this spirit it's the Holy Ghost it's
[1:31:23] the promise that God had said it's the
[1:31:25] promise that God gave that we would
[1:31:28] receive the Holy Ghost through Jeremiah
[1:31:30] through Isaiah now but let's look here
[1:31:33] at Joel and let's just see amen uh as
[1:31:37] Joel says it uh pretty plainly there in
[1:31:40] Joel 2 and 27.
[1:31:43] amen we'll give you time there to go
[1:31:47] uh uh Joel 2 and 27.
[1:31:52] you guys are already there
[1:31:54] all right amen
[1:31:56] for ye shall know that I'm in the midst
[1:31:59] of Israel that I am the Lord your God
[1:32:01] and none else
[1:32:03] and my people shall never be ashamed and
[1:32:05] it shall come to pass afterward that I
[1:32:06] will pour blank blank blank
[1:32:10] I will pour out of my spirit upon All
[1:32:14] Flesh and your sons and daughters shall
[1:32:17] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:32:21] your young men shall see Visions so
[1:32:25] while the Apostle Paul is constantly
[1:32:28] making he is constantly making a a a a a
[1:32:32] a a difference between the spirit the
[1:32:36] father and the son
[1:32:39] there is no difference between the Holy
[1:32:43] Spirit and the father God
[1:32:45] now are you saying well brother Wendell
[1:32:47] now you're making two Gods no we're not
[1:32:50] making two Gods it is the Jesus had a
[1:32:54] time he was born he had a time that he
[1:32:57] died he had a time he was resurrected he
[1:33:00] had a time and father God lives in that
[1:33:05] body when you get to heaven and you're
[1:33:08] looking for three and if you do see
[1:33:10] three when you get to heaven you
[1:33:11] probably won't be there in heaven
[1:33:14] because you'd have to be drunk amen
[1:33:16] you'd have to be drunk to see three of
[1:33:18] them in Heaven There is not three that
[1:33:21] you're going to see
[1:33:24] Hallelujah
[1:33:27] now they're they're in the fourth
[1:33:29] chapter of the Book of Revelations the
[1:33:30] Bible says and and he was caught up into
[1:33:32] heaven and there was one one that set on
[1:33:36] the throne one
[1:33:39] amen one that said on the throne so so
[1:33:43] yes Jesus set on his father's Throne oh
[1:33:46] when you see the beauty of it do you see
[1:33:48] how you you wouldn't even you wouldn't
[1:33:51] even be able to overcome the devils in
[1:33:53] any way shape or form if God didn't live
[1:33:55] in you
[1:33:56] amen but this one here Jesus Christ he
[1:34:00] is God Amen that was God that was God
[1:34:03] living there that was that was that was
[1:34:06] that was God laying in the manger that
[1:34:08] was God that was that that departed the
[1:34:11] uh or that that that calmed the Seas
[1:34:13] that was God that raised up Lazarus that
[1:34:16] was God it was God in his body
[1:34:20] then you'll never ever ever ever
[1:34:22] separate God from his body again
[1:34:26] amen now are we all are we all clear on
[1:34:29] that now you you you're again got
[1:34:32] anything you want to say make sure you

[1:35:12] prophet Joel
[1:35:13] and it shall come to pass in the last
[1:35:16] days saith God I will pour out of blank
[1:35:21] blank

[1:35:51] Ephesians four and four
[1:35:54] amen praise the Lord I'm gonna I'm gonna

[1:35:57] ahead of me I'll I'll quit looking at
[1:35:59] this amen
[1:36:30] well you can't you you can't separate
[1:36:32] okay you you look there it
[1:36:37] well yeah he's got uh when you're
[1:36:41] looking there in in the um especially
[1:36:44] like if you okay you look you take their
[1:36:47] um Revelation 5. that that's a that's a
[1:36:50] that's a scripture I love preaching out
[1:36:52] of okay so you've got one on the throne
[1:36:55] and then you've got a lamb that is
[1:36:59] coming over and taking the book so you
[1:37:02] want so so the trinitarians will say see
[1:37:05] see so you've got you've got one on the
[1:37:08] throne and then you've got a lamb well
[1:37:11] first of all
[1:37:13] you you've gotta you've got to miss you
[1:37:15] you don't you you uh you've got to
[1:37:17] understand in the way that these that
[1:37:20] these uh that the Apostle John was
[1:37:22] seeing it first of all there is not a
[1:37:24] woolly lamb in heaven
[1:37:27] there's not a woolly lamb
[1:37:28] that woolly lamb is there he put that
[1:37:32] there so that we can understand
[1:37:35] in our finite condition what God is
[1:37:39] doing
[1:37:40] there is no woolly lamb
[1:37:43] but it is showing you
[1:37:49] that lamb
[1:37:51] he
[1:37:53] God could never take the book without
[1:37:57] that lamb
[1:37:59] God could never redeem though he was the
[1:38:02] Savior without that body
[1:38:05] so he's showing us that that the body is
[1:38:10] showing us what it's for the body come
[1:38:13] in
[1:38:14] to fulfill the purpose of redemption
[1:38:16] take that book
[1:38:19] the title deed to the Earth and to uh
[1:38:22] redeem us back to that place with God so
[1:38:25] when you when you look there amen
[1:38:29] um you know let's just look here real
[1:38:31] quick let's let's just look at it
[1:38:36] now you're and again uh hey I'm glad I'm
[1:38:39] glad you're saying
[1:38:41] uh you you bring this up let's look here
[1:38:43] at Revelations five and one I seen in
[1:38:46] the right hand of him that said on the
[1:38:47] throne a book written within and on the
[1:38:49] backside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:38:52] amen these are symbols these are
[1:38:55] symbolic
[1:38:56] and I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with
[1:38:58] her loud voice who was worthy to open
[1:39:01] the book and to loosen the seals thereof
[1:39:03] no man in heaven neither in the earth
[1:39:05] neither under the Earth was able to take
[1:39:07] the book neither to look upon God him
[1:39:10] himself
[1:39:14] could not open the book
[1:39:18] he's got the
[1:39:21] God can't open it
[1:39:24] until he gets a body
[1:39:26] then the lamb steps forth takes the book
[1:39:29] there has to be a Kinsmen Redeemer to
[1:39:34] come in and to take that book and to
[1:39:38] open it
[1:39:46] there had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer there
[1:39:49] had to be a Kinsmen there had to be
[1:39:52] somebody that knew that could fill your
[1:39:55] pain that could do your soul Christ so
[1:39:58] it's showing here that God's got the
[1:40:01] book the one on the throne he's got the
[1:40:03] book no one is worthy to open it it was
[1:40:06] lost by man man is in sin
[1:40:10] and God in his own law says there has to
[1:40:13] be a Kinsman no one else can come and
[1:40:15] take that book no one else can come and
[1:40:18] redeem that that's that's the Old
[1:40:19] Testament uh a law of redemption
[1:40:23] oh
[1:40:24] but then the Lamb of God
[1:40:27] the body of God God through Christ took
[1:40:32] the book opened that book you were in
[1:40:36] that book the title deed to the Earth
[1:40:38] your position as sons of God going back
[1:40:42] to to the Garden of Eden again
[1:40:45] it was in that Lamb's work
[1:40:49] y'all see that
[1:40:51] so so you can see now now is there is it
[1:40:53] now if there's anything that's if if if
[1:40:55] there's any questions uh make sure make
[1:40:58] sure you ask that because amen uh
[1:41:02] because Sunday night there was a lot of
[1:41:03] you saying
[1:41:05] so so make sure you ask questions
[1:41:08] you're not gonna hurt my feelings if
[1:41:10] even if you think I'm wrong you can
[1:41:12] still you know you as long as you say it
[1:41:15] nice don't hurt my feelings amen
[1:41:26] yes
[1:41:30] yeah but you're never gonna but you're
[1:41:32] you're you'll you'll never do away with
[1:41:35] the body
[1:41:36] that body of Christ God will forever be
[1:41:39] in that body he will reign as king
[1:41:44] that's right there's not two no no it
[1:41:46] doesn't make two it makes
[1:41:51] yes
[1:41:52] yes taking that back God made us God
[1:41:55] made us in that image
[1:42:04] uh-huh
[1:42:14] yes bingo
[1:42:32] that's beautiful that's that's it's you
[1:42:34] and you're one person
[1:42:37] different offices
[1:42:39] different that's right that's right
[1:42:42] yeah that that that is exactly what God
[1:42:46] is he took it's it's it's he takes off
[1:42:49] one hat
[1:42:52] and puts on another hat
[1:42:54] still the same God
[1:42:56] but he takes off the one hat puts on
[1:42:58] another are you kidding you can you
[1:42:59] can't understand that
[1:43:01] um okay so when you all played somebody
[1:43:03] uh who some of y'all played two two
[1:43:06] different deals in that in our last play
[1:43:07] didn't you did when there's someone that
[1:43:09] done two different parts two different
[1:43:11] rows
[1:43:14] Brianna so what were you
[1:43:23] okay there you go
[1:43:25] see she took off the one she she acted
[1:43:28] in the one part
[1:43:30] and she and and and and and she was an
[1:43:33] angel
[1:43:34] and then in the next part of the scene
[1:43:36] she takes that
[1:43:39] disaster moth
[1:43:40] off puts in what were you again
[1:43:43] a guard
[1:43:45] going from Angel to killing people
[1:43:48] and then
[1:43:51] you better watch out amen
[1:43:53] but but the but the it's one God living
[1:43:59] oh what a plan
[1:44:02] it was something that only God could do
[1:44:04] there was no one else that could live
[1:44:07] this there was no one else that could
[1:44:09] play that part
[1:44:13] and no one could live that part no one
[1:44:16] could do it God had to come and live
[1:44:19] that life
[1:44:21] amen any other questions comments
[1:44:24] I like I appreciate that amen
[1:44:35] yes
[1:44:36] now the scripture says that his name
[1:44:39] shall be called
[1:44:40] counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God
[1:44:42] Everlasting father
[1:44:44] and the reason is is once God moves
[1:44:46] inside that body then it becomes
[1:44:48] synonymous it becomes they become one
[1:44:51] Jesus says I and my father
[1:44:53] are one
[1:45:04] that that was the Holy Ghost that was
[1:45:06] God that was the all of God I'm fixing
[1:45:09] to show you here in a minute where where
[1:45:11] where the Apostle Paul uses the spirit
[1:45:13] of Christ spirit of God and the Holy
[1:45:15] Spirit
[1:45:16] all the same and
[1:45:21] all in one body all wrapped up in one
[1:45:23] body all wrapped up in one body now now
[1:45:25] but where where people get mixed up and
[1:45:28] and and and and this is where sometimes
[1:45:30] if you don't understand the sonship if
[1:45:33] you take away the sonship you've taken
[1:45:36] away Redemption
[1:45:38] that's the beauty God done what no one
[1:45:41] else could
[1:45:44] I love him I I I'd like to cry right now
[1:45:48] I'm telling you I love him so much
[1:45:51] What A Plan of Redemption
[1:45:55] and then Satan comes in with this
[1:45:57] Trinity thing and he comes in trying to
[1:45:59] do all of these other things and before
[1:46:01] you know it it's taking away it's taking
[1:46:05] away the preciousness of what God is
[1:46:07] trying to do what God is doing in our
[1:46:12] lives
[1:46:13] because I'm going to tell you right now
[1:46:15] uh uh uh sister Kaylee
[1:46:18] when we talk about the baptism of the
[1:46:21] Holy Ghost we're not talking about the
[1:46:23] third person the Trinity we're talking
[1:46:24] about the same God
[1:46:27] that done all of this in creating that
[1:46:30] body so that he could get to you and
[1:46:31] live in you
[1:46:33] he'd done all that was his path to get
[1:46:36] to you to you and he couldn't get to you
[1:46:37] to you until he'd done all of this other
[1:46:40] oh how beautiful how beautiful
[1:46:43] amen where am I at such keys
[1:46:46] all right
[1:46:47] so what scripture is there is hallelujah
[1:46:52] Ephesians
[1:46:54] amen now let's look
[1:46:56] let's look here amen
[1:46:59] the spirit of God
[1:47:02] and the spirit of Christ are
[1:47:04] interchangeable now let's look here on a
[1:47:07] few things here
[1:47:08] amen
[1:47:10] what you saying something oh
[1:47:12] all right so Ephesians 3 and 16
[1:47:15] that he would Grant you
[1:47:19] I'll let you turn to it are you guys
[1:47:20] already there
[1:47:23] that he would Grant you according to the
[1:47:25] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:47:27] by his spirit in the inner man that
[1:47:31] Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith
[1:47:34] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[1:47:38] love
[1:47:39] now now what I want you to want you to
[1:47:42] look at this now we just settle it
[1:47:43] there's only one Spirit he said there's
[1:47:45] only one spirit
[1:47:47] so now he's saying that be that
[1:47:49] strengthened by his Spirit and the inner
[1:47:50] man that Christ May dwell in in your
[1:47:54] hearts uh by faith now let's let's go
[1:47:57] down to the next one sister keys
[1:48:01] amen all right let's look here at Romans
[1:48:03] 8 and 9.
[1:48:09] praise the Lord now I want you to watch
[1:48:11] how he's how he's talking about the
[1:48:12] spirit of God and then below him the
[1:48:14] spirit of Christ spirit of God Spirit of
[1:48:16] Christ
[1:48:18] Romans 8 and 9.
[1:48:21] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:48:23] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:48:27] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[1:48:30] spirit of Christ he is none of his
[1:48:34] so there you are the
[1:48:37] the
[1:48:38] moment that God moved in that body
[1:48:44] it becomes synonymous it's now the
[1:48:46] spirit of God Spirit of Christ holy
[1:48:48] spirit it's all the same thing in that
[1:48:52] body

[1:49:52] dwell in you and now if any man have not
[1:49:55] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[1:49:57] amen now first first Corinthians 12 and
[1:50:02] 13. amen it says
[1:50:07] by one Spirit somebody say one spirit
[1:50:11] are we all baptized into one body
[1:50:13] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:50:16] we be Bond or free and have been all
[1:50:18] been all made to drink in one spirit all
[1:50:23] right just write these down in your
[1:50:25] books in your deals because I'm going to
[1:50:27] just I'm gonna I'm gonna start spitting
[1:50:29] some stuff out to you and you can read
[1:50:31] it in your devotion all right so I'm
[1:50:33] going to show you Holy Ghost spirit of
[1:50:35] Christ spirit of God are all the same
[1:50:37] are you ready

[1:50:42] Ghost they were all filled with the Holy
[1:50:44] Ghost Acts 2 and 38 ye shall receive the
[1:50:48] gift of the Holy Ghost acts 4 and 31
[1:50:51] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:50:54] all right now let's see what he says
[1:50:56] what what God Said and what he promised
[1:50:58] to send Acts 2 and 17 saith God I will
[1:51:02] pour out of my spirit on All Flesh
[1:51:05] Romans 8 9 the spirit of God dwell in
[1:51:10] you let's look at the Spirit of Christ
[1:51:12] Romans 8 and 9. if any man has not the
[1:51:15] spirit of Christ he has none of his
[1:51:16] Galatians 4 and 6 God hath sent forth
[1:51:19] the spirit of his son into your heart
[1:51:22] Ephesians 3 and 16 that Christ May dwell
[1:51:27] in your hearts so when they're talking
[1:51:30] about the Holy Ghost spirit of God and
[1:51:33] the spirit of Christ it's all the same
[1:51:36] thing
[1:51:39] are we understanding

[1:51:52] over Cleveland I don't
[1:51:53] amen
[1:51:55] yes yes I think I've said that it's
[1:51:58] called the spirit of Christ because once
[1:52:00] the spirit dwelled in the body of Jesus
[1:52:03] now God's spirit is synonymous with
[1:52:06] Jesus amen that's why Jesus said when
[1:52:09] you have seen me you have seen the
[1:52:11] father
[1:52:12] amen the spirit of the father dwelt in
[1:52:16] him now let's go to that next one there

[1:52:20] everyone to to go to this one
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:25] Hallelujah

[1:52:32] talked I've talked a little bit too much
[1:52:35] in between time amen
[1:52:39] Hallelujah
[1:52:42] now
[1:52:45] when we get into these others that we're
[1:52:47] going to talk about you say well why you
[1:52:51] know
[1:52:52] you talked about the Beast last week and
[1:52:54] and and the deal that was talking on the
[1:52:56] Beast was I was trying to get you to see
[1:52:58] there are kingdoms
[1:53:02] that makes those kingdoms act the way
[1:53:04] they are the United States and the world
[1:53:06] and the transgender and the adulteries
[1:53:08] and all these things that are going on
[1:53:09] the Anarchy that's going on that is the
[1:53:12] spirit of that's behind the kingdoms so
[1:53:16] when we're seeing all the lawlessness
[1:53:18] and stuff out there
[1:53:19] what we're trying to show you is that
[1:53:22] fourth Beast is a conglomeration of all
[1:53:25] the other beasts of Daniel it was it was
[1:53:28] the other world Empires that is now that
[1:53:31] has now come into one and now this guy
[1:53:35] is just causing Havoc we don't see it I
[1:53:39] mean all we see is kingdoms and
[1:53:41] legislations and all of this kind of
[1:53:43] stuff but there are spirits behind it
[1:53:46] amen so so we got that but when you look
[1:53:50] there in in the first and second chapter
[1:53:53] of the Book of Revelations it is dealing
[1:53:56] with the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:53:59] Jesus Christ is God now you tried now
[1:54:03] now there's where there's where I sort
[1:54:05] of differ
[1:54:05] you that that's one God Amen now I know
[1:54:08] we've got some that that try to say that
[1:54:11] we're going to see two and they're
[1:54:13] you're not going to see two you're not
[1:54:15] going to see two you will never ever
[1:54:18] Hallelujah
[1:54:20] the Bible says well uh Hallelujah amen
[1:54:24] he is the invisible God now he shows
[1:54:27] himself with a rainbow he shows himself
[1:54:29] with the cloud he shows himself with a
[1:54:32] whirlwind but no one's ever seen God
[1:54:35] Jesus is the only one
[1:54:38] that is every Hallelujah and he's
[1:54:40] declaring him unto us amen all right now
[1:54:44] here's the deal right here I want no one
[1:54:46] installed I want you kids this here this
[1:54:49] here we'll put it all together where you
[1:54:50] kids can understand exact this this here
[1:54:53] will just clinch down what I've said all
[1:54:55] night long all right first John 5 and 7.
[1:54:58] there are three oh
[1:55:02] there are three that bear record in
[1:55:06] heaven and you're saying Oh Oh Brother
[1:55:10] winner you've been preaching some false
[1:55:11] Doctrine amen
[1:55:13] there are three that bear record in
[1:55:15] heaven the
[1:55:18] the
[1:55:19] the
[1:55:22] and these three are Trinity
[1:55:29] these three are
[1:55:33] and there are three that bear witness in
[1:55:36] Earth
[1:55:37] the spirit the water the blood and these
[1:55:43] three
[1:55:46] agree in one
[1:55:49] now how can how can the three in heaven
[1:55:51] be one it's the three offices that they
[1:55:55] are known for it was god Jehovah now
[1:55:59] living in in a body of Flesh now living
[1:56:03] in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:56:08] one God one God three offices
[1:56:12] but now there is a difference in the
[1:56:15] spirit
[1:56:16] baptism and the blood
[1:56:20] you can have the blood you can be
[1:56:22] justified and not be sanctified
[1:56:25] you can be Sanctified and not be filled
[1:56:27] with the Holy Ghost
[1:56:29] but when you get Justified Sanctified
[1:56:33] filled with the Holy Ghost then they
[1:56:36] agree in one in the consummation of a
[1:56:37] new birth
[1:56:39] there's a lot of people sitting in
[1:56:41] church they're Justified and they're not
[1:56:42] sanctified
[1:56:43] there's a lot of them that are
[1:56:44] Sanctified and they're not they don't
[1:56:45] have the Holy Ghost but what we want
[1:56:47] amen the three here on Earth that
[1:56:49] consummates a new birth what you know my
[1:56:51] wife when she had her he's got to break
[1:56:53] the water there's got to be blood
[1:56:55] there's got to be water and then there's
[1:56:56] got to be life
[1:56:57] amen the life comes into that baby and
[1:57:00] he he begins to breathe and so so once
[1:57:04] again amen we're thankful for that so
[1:57:07] once again uh uh the next one sister
[1:57:09] Caleb we just we've done that before but
[1:57:11] once again First Timothy 2 and 5 help me
[1:57:14] out here for there is
[1:57:18] one God
[1:57:19] and one mediator between God and man the
[1:57:25] man Jesus Christ
[1:57:30] oh we should forever more love him
[1:57:34] amen
[1:57:35] you know
[1:57:38] I I was when I was preparing I I I read
[1:57:41] some of the
[1:57:42] I read some
[1:57:45] Billy Graham had made a comment he said
[1:57:47] when they asked him in an interview
[1:57:49] explain the Trinity he says no one can
[1:57:52] understand the Trinity it's a it's it's
[1:57:55] it's a mystery no one no one can
[1:57:57] understand it
[1:57:59] they're in the Baptist the the big
[1:58:02] Baptist University in Texas uh Dr Bowles
[1:58:04] I think he's died now too
[1:58:06] but he says this will be something that
[1:58:09] you never understood that that's it's
[1:58:11] unexplainable
[1:58:12] and I say
[1:58:14] it's a wonderful thing when you can
[1:58:17] truly see what God has done and how
[1:58:19] precious his work is
[1:58:22] can you see man
[1:58:23] amen did you know
[1:58:26] as the musicians come did you know that
[1:58:30] this the same anointing the same
[1:58:33] anointing the Bible says they're in Luke
[1:58:35] 4 and 1.
[1:58:38] Luke 4 and 1 it says and Jesus being
[1:58:41] full of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:44] return from Jordan and was led by the
[1:58:47] spirit
[1:58:49] Into the Wilderness
[1:58:53] now
[1:58:55] being full
[1:58:57] of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:01] the Bible says that he was led into the
[1:59:03] spirit to be tempted of the devil God
[1:59:04] was proving
[1:59:07] now this is where that question that you
[1:59:09] asked the other night or the the other
[1:59:11] day sister Steffy about
[1:59:13] Okay so
[1:59:15] if the dove if if the Dove came down at
[1:59:19] that point which was again it was
[1:59:22] another symbol it was a symbol of
[1:59:24] adoption
[1:59:27] then does that
[1:59:29] you was asking did he become God when he
[1:59:32] was 30 we thought he was God when he was
[1:59:34] born
[1:59:35] well I want to tell you that was a that
[1:59:38] was that was Jehovah laying in that
[1:59:40] Manger
[1:59:41] that was Jehovah playing with the kids
[1:59:45] that was Jehovah living in that body
[1:59:49] then why why the ceremony
[1:59:52] why is it that when he went to the when
[1:59:54] he went to the uh Jordan
[1:59:56] [Music]
[1:59:58] and the heaven opens it and you hear the
[2:00:00] voice saying this is my beloved Son in
[2:00:02] whom I am pleased to dwell
[2:00:04] and you see lightning unto a dove coming
[2:00:08] and resting upon him
[2:00:10] what John had already been told the one
[2:00:13] that you see the dove
[2:00:16] rest upon
[2:00:18] he will be the Lamb of God
[2:00:21] he will be that lamb
[2:00:24] now he didn't know John didn't know John
[2:00:26] was just out there as a prophet
[2:00:28] saying the lamb cometh
[2:00:31] but he didn't know who the lamb was
[2:00:35] but when that anointing came down it was
[2:00:37] did you know that the priest in the Old
[2:00:40] Testament times the priests were not
[2:00:42] allowed
[2:00:44] to even enter into the priesthood until
[2:00:46] they were 30 years old
[2:00:48] then when they entered into the 30 years
[2:00:50] old then they would go in they would
[2:00:52] have the oil the anointing all would be
[2:00:54] poured on which is symbolic of the Holy
[2:00:57] Spirit coming up on them
[2:00:58] and placing them into the ministry
[2:01:01] placing them
[2:01:03] so at here we had
[2:01:07] God Emmanuel living in a body but Jesus
[2:01:09] never performed a miracle
[2:01:11] Jesus never had a sign
[2:01:15] until he come up out of that water
[2:01:19] what was it he was put into service that
[2:01:23] vessel
[2:01:28] that vessel even fulfilled the Old
[2:01:29] Testament priesthood
[2:01:35] here he was the very Lamb of God
[2:01:38] and when he walked out
[2:01:40] now here's the here's here's the kicker
[2:01:42] and this is something that's so
[2:01:43] beautiful to me
[2:01:44] [Music]
[2:01:46] the same word anointing when Jesus said
[2:01:50] the spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[2:01:52] and he hath anointed me is the exact
[2:01:55] same word that is used when the Holy
[2:02:00] Ghost comes upon you as the believer the
[2:02:02] exact
[2:02:03] same word in the Greek is used of you
[2:02:07] when you are anointed and put into
[2:02:09] service by the Holy Ghost
[2:02:16] it's no wonder that he says in my name
[2:02:18] you'll cast out devils
[2:02:22] The Works that I do shall you do also
[2:02:29] I hope I hope
[2:02:32] I I hope you're getting a a picture of
[2:02:35] what Christ come to do he come to tear
[2:02:38] down that middle wall of partition so
[2:02:39] that the spirit of God could come to you
[2:02:40] the spirit of God could not come to you
[2:02:42] until that body come to take care of
[2:02:44] redemption
[2:02:47] and you know what God didn't put away
[2:02:50] his body that body is still representing
[2:02:52] you tonight
[2:02:53] [Music]
[2:02:57] that body is still representing you
[2:02:59] there he is in a position of authority
[2:03:03] man
[2:03:05] God took a man God took a body chose to
[2:03:09] leave he could have he could have lived
[2:03:10] in a in a temple he could have lived in
[2:03:12] Gold he could have lived in anything but
[2:03:15] he chose to create a human being to live
[2:03:18] in
[2:03:20] foreign
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:25] I know sometimes in our minds we get
[2:03:28] weary and and and and sometimes in our
[2:03:30] frailties and our failures and there's
[2:03:32] so many but I want to tell you God
[2:03:34] didn't abandon that body that body is
[2:03:36] still there that body is still
[2:03:38] representing You In Heaven There is a
[2:03:41] body there in heaven and God says I'm
[2:03:44] living in that body
[2:03:45] and this body
[2:03:47] that I used
[2:03:49] to redeem you
[2:03:52] that blood that was shed to save you
[2:03:58] that blood will be there to take you all
[2:04:01] the way
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:05] you get weary you get tired but I've
[2:04:07] overcome I've overcome and I'm already
[2:04:10] here and I'm I'm waiting for you I'm
[2:04:13] waiting for you I'm waiting till all of
[2:04:16] my enemies become my footstool
[2:04:21] the body
[2:04:23] of God
[2:04:26] still dripping with blood
[2:04:29] to remind God
[2:04:32] of what he's done for you to remind God
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:39] when God looks at the blood
[2:04:43] he sees the finished work
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:48] and God looks
[2:04:50] the blood of his own hands in the body
[2:04:53] that he created to redeem you
[2:04:57] God sees you
[2:05:01] it reminds him
[2:05:03] I'll not lose a one of them
[2:05:07] I'll not lose one of them
[2:05:09] I love you
[2:05:12] laughs
[2:05:14] you might have scars tonight
[2:05:16] but I just want you to know that his
[2:05:18] scars
[2:05:20] you know what I believe I believe when
[2:05:22] we get to the other side those scars
[2:05:24] will still be there
[2:05:25] I believe we're going to see those scars
[2:05:27] those scars are trophies
[2:05:29] those scars are what it took to redeem
[2:05:32] your team you
[2:05:34] he loves you tonight
[2:05:37] Oh How He Loves You
[2:05:42] he was led up into the Wilderness to be
[2:05:43] tempted of the devil
[2:05:45] you know what I believe God was proving
[2:05:48] that the spirit of God can overcome
[2:05:51] every Temptation by the word of the god
[2:05:54] and the Bible says they're in Luke 4 4
[2:05:56] and 14 when he come down out of that
[2:05:58] Wilderness when he come back out of that
[2:06:00] Wilderness he stood there the Bible says
[2:06:03] he returned in the power of the spirit
[2:06:06] into Galilee and there went a fat of
[2:06:08] Fame
[2:06:11] and it went to the temple
