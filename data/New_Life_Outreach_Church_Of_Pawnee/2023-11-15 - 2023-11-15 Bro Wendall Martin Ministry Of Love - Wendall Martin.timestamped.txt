[34:33] uh with us and and uh I I love love her
[34:38] voice amen love that singing here in 2
[34:42] Corinthians 5 and
[34:44] 11 it says knowing therefore the terror
[34:47] of the lord we persuade men but we are
[34:51] made manifest unto God I trust
[34:55] also uh are made manif manest in your
[34:58] consciences for we commend not ourselves
[35:01] again unto you but give you occasion to
[35:05] glory on our behalf that ye may have
[35:08] somewhat to answer to them which glory
[35:11] in appearance not in heart for whether
[35:14] we be beside ourselves it is God whether
[35:17] we be sober it is for your cause for the
[35:21] love of Christ constrains us because we
[35:24] thus judge that if one died for all
[35:27] then were all dead and that he died for
[35:31] all that they should live not hence for
[35:35] uh they uh they which live should not
[35:39] henceforth live unto themselves but unto
[35:41] him which died for them and rose again
[35:44] wherefore uh henceforth know we no man
[35:47] after the flesh yay though we have known
[35:50] Christ after the flesh yet now
[35:52] henceforth know we him no more therefore
[35:55] If any man be in Christ Christ let he uh
[35:58] he is a new creature old things are
[36:00] passed away behold all things are become
[36:03] new all things are of God who ha
[36:05] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[36:08] and hath given to us the ministry of
[36:11] reconciliation to it that God was in
[36:14] Christ reconciling the world unto
[36:16] himself not imputing their transpasses
[36:18] unto them and ha committed unto us the
[36:21] ministry or the word of
[36:23] reconciliation now then we are
[36:26] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[36:28] beseech You by us we pray you in Christ
[36:31] yet be reconciled to God for he hath
[36:35] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[36:38] sin that we might be made the
[36:41] righteousness of God in him can you say
[36:46] Amen aren't you glad you heard the good

[38:10] and um uh we uh are are sure in in
[38:16] prayer for uh sister titha and and I
[38:20] know that she must her and brother Mitch
[38:22] or must be just wore out with that uh
[38:25] wedding and and and uh glad to hear that
[38:28] everything went good for sister Angie uh
[38:31] yesterday and and so we're we're sure
[38:34] thankful for that believing the Lord to
[38:37] to help her to feel a lot better than
[38:39] what she has she's been struggling with
[38:41] that hand for a long time and uh but I
[38:44] want to just Minister tonight for uh for
[38:48] a a few moments on the ministry of love
[38:52] and um as we read tonight man uh the uh
[38:59] the Apostle Paul let us know he says the
[39:02] love of Christ constrains us amen that
[39:06] we should not live henceforth to
[39:09] ourselves amen but unto him that died
[39:12] for us and that rose again and I I think
[39:16] that you know uh the the prophet of God
[39:19] told us that none of us are were saved
[39:23] uh uh just to be a religious person amen
[39:28] but each of us have been given a
[39:31] Ministry and and um there's there's many
[39:36] uh there's the five-fold ministry there
[39:38] are the nine spiritual gifts there are
[39:41] the the helps and the governments in the
[39:43] church there's there's so many things
[39:46] that but every one of us there in 1
[39:48] Peter 4:10 it says as every man hath
[39:51] received the gift even so Minister the
[39:55] same one one to another as good stewards
[39:59] of the manifold grace of God so amen as
[40:03] every man every believer has received
[40:06] the gift that is singular that's the
[40:09] gift of eternal life that's the baptism
[40:11] of the Holy Ghost that's the new
[40:14] birth and so amen the first thing in in
[40:19] being a part of a body is that we uh are
[40:25] we must be uh baptized into that body by
[40:30] one spirit and we are a many membered
[40:34] body can you say am man now I've been
[40:37] preaching a little bit to the uh uh
[40:39] concerning the god called preacher and
[40:42] and the god called preacher is so
[40:44] incredibly important but every member of
[40:48] the church is important every Ministry
[40:52] in the church is important amen so the
[40:56] first thing to Ministry is receiving the
[41:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost so amen that
[41:03] you can't be a good steart of the
[41:05] manifold grace of God the multiple gifts
[41:08] that God has given unless we have
[41:11] received the singular gift which is the
[41:14] holy spirit that's the gift of eternal
[41:17] life and then you're baptized or placed
[41:20] into Jesus Earthly body and so the gifts
[41:24] and callings PL
[41:26] would be distributed among the body amen
[41:30] matters of fact there in first uh
[41:32] Corinthians 12:1 says but all these
[41:36] worketh that one and selfsame spirit
[41:39] dividing to every man severally as he
[41:43] will so that tells us that that there
[41:46] are several gifts that are given to each
[41:49] of us so we've got callings and we've
[41:53] got gifts that are placed in our life
[41:56] amen what are these gifts and callings
[41:58] for they are for the edification of the
[42:01] body of Jesus Christ amen in a human
[42:04] body you've got your ears and your eyes
[42:07] and your your your nose and your kidneys
[42:09] and your liver and and and and all of
[42:12] these other parts of the body and all of
[42:15] these are required these members are are
[42:19] required for this body to function
[42:23] properly amen so every everyone has
[42:27] their place has their purpose and and
[42:31] there's one thing in between that that
[42:33] brings Ministry to work and that is love
[42:38] love is what brings Ministry to the
[42:42] Forefront amen because Ministry is
[42:45] actually a servants position it is a it
[42:48] it is it is something uh within us to
[42:52] serve the rest of the body amen now
[42:56] uh there in Ephesians 4:15 it says uh
[43:00] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[43:02] up into him and all things which is the
[43:04] head even Christ from whom the whole
[43:07] body fitly joined together and compacted
[43:12] by that which every joint
[43:14] supplies amen so so what it is saying is
[43:18] we've all connected together and and and
[43:21] we are all ministers every one of us are
[43:25] minister
[43:27] Hallelujah now remember when when
[43:29] brother brandham uh there in the church
[43:31] age book I read it to you here I I
[43:33] believe it was the last service that I
[43:35] preached where where brother Brenham
[43:37] says the spirit of the Antichrist is to
[43:40] take the ministry of the Saints away and
[43:44] place it on a few holy men amen and he
[43:48] says and when you do that then you have
[43:50] effectively moved and taken the spirit
[43:53] of Christ out of the church church
[43:56] because that's the only way that we can
[43:59] work uh uh effectively can you say Amen
[44:03] so it says the whole body uh uh fitly
[44:06] joined together and compacted by that
[44:08] which every joint supplieth according to
[44:11] the effectual working in the measure of
[44:13] every part maketh increase of the body
[44:16] unto the edifying of itself in love now
[44:20] I also want to look here in first uh
[44:22] Corinthians 12:4 amen I I know we could
[44:26] delve into these uh gifts a lot but I
[44:29] I'm just I just want to uh Center on our
[44:32] ministry for tonight it says there are
[44:35] diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit
[44:38] there are differences of administration
[44:40] but the same Lord there are diversities
[44:43] of operation but it is the same God
[44:45] which worketh all in all but the
[44:47] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[44:49] every man to profit with them can you
[44:53] say Amen now every one of us have been
[44:57] placed here in the body of Christ by
[45:00] predestination the scripture says gifts
[45:03] and callings of God are without
[45:05] repentance that means amen they were
[45:08] ordained to you but while you were still
[45:11] a sinner amen God had God placed you
[45:14] here on this Earth with a specific
[45:18] purpose amen that means every one of us
[45:22] have have come to Earth to fulfill
[45:26] a specific purpose that God had in his
[45:30] mind now any gift that is laying within
[45:33] you was predestinated I don't care who
[45:35] you are I don't care whether it's Amen
[45:38] uh uh the baby that Lord read is Holy
[45:40] amen or or uh uh or or whoever would be
[45:44] the eldest among us we've all got gifts
[45:47] we come to the Earth with a
[45:52] purpose we've got purpose every one of
[45:55] us have got purpose amen and brother
[45:57] Bram says and when our purpose is
[46:00] finished then God takes us home but
[46:03] Satan cannot take us home until the
[46:06] purpose of God has been completed amen
[46:10] hallelujah so so that gift that was in
[46:13] you those gifts and those callings were
[46:17] placed there amen before you were saved
[46:20] before you were filled with the Holy
[46:21] Ghost now now that doesn't mean that
[46:24] every one of us are going want to come
[46:26] to our our fullest potential amen just
[46:29] because we've got we we we've got
[46:32] talents and gifts and things that God's
[46:34] given us there's going to that doesn't
[46:36] mean that that that every man and
[46:38] woman's going to take advantage of it
[46:40] matters of fact there's going to be many
[46:42] many many many many many that will not
[46:44] that cannot ever come to the Fulfillment
[46:47] that God's ordained for them total
[46:49] fulfillment because they have not worked
[46:52] according to the laws of God so we our
[46:56] gifts and our our callings amen God's
[47:00] got a design he designed you for that
[47:03] but but unless you walk and work
[47:07] according to his laws amen then you will
[47:12] not reach its its fullness can you say
[47:14] amen amen so so most want to just walk
[47:18] behind the pulpit that's what people
[47:20] think a Ministry is is is uh you know I
[47:23] I I want to get up and preach or I I
[47:25] want to get up in front of everyone and
[47:26] sing amen and you know but but sometimes
[47:30] God's got a God's got uh uh uh something
[47:33] for you to do behind a stove or or or
[47:36] behind a lawnmower or amen or or
[47:39] assisting this or that can you say Amen
[47:42] but you see we've got to walk and work
[47:44] according to the gifts that God's placed
[47:47] in our lives some people want to be uh
[47:50] uh you know singers and Hallelujah and
[47:53] and bless their heart they're not called
[47:56] the saint now now they they might they
[47:59] might make a Joyful Noise to the Lord
[48:01] amen some people might want to uh uh you
[48:04] know be a prophesier but if they're not
[48:07] called to prophesy amen then for them to
[48:12] pray and seek and beg God uh uh for that
[48:16] gift it they will never come to the
[48:19] fullness of what God called them here to
[48:23] fulfill well praise the Lord so the holy
[48:26] spirit says he has placed Us in the body
[48:31] such as it pleased him now brother Bram
[48:35] talks about India a and and having great
[48:38] potential uh of of being a a very rich
[48:42] Nation amen he's you know and the
[48:44] possibilities being
[48:46] innumerable and he says he says you know
[48:49] there's 470 people uh in in uh 70
[48:53] million people in India and honest I
[48:55] know I'm exaggerating but I'd guess 400
[48:58] million Beggars they know nothing but
[49:00] beg they've got plenty of Natural
[49:03] Resources but the mentality to develop
[49:07] it all they know is beg and religion can
[49:12] you say Amen so we are not beggars in
[49:17] the kingdom of God we have a position as
[49:21] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we have a
[49:26] position every one of us every position
[49:30] matters you see now brother Wendell I I
[49:34] I want to uh uh where do I start with my
[49:38] Ministry amen I think I think the first
[49:40] thing you do is you start with the
[49:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost because it's
[49:44] the Holy Ghost again that initiates you
[49:46] and places you in your position amen
[49:50] there is where the seed burst forth and
[49:54] a and is and is and is energized amen so
[49:58] now there's many that can operate gifts
[50:00] without the Holy Ghost now amen there's
[50:02] unregenerated men that's got gifts in
[50:04] their lives uh H uh men that amen that
[50:09] you know uh you know have a call to
[50:11] preach and they're and they're good
[50:13] they're they're good car salesmen
[50:14] they're good uh uh you know they they
[50:18] they they're they're good in in
[50:20] management and things of that nature and
[50:22] if these men have the baptism of the
[50:24] Holy Ghost then God could use them many
[50:28] times amen I'm not saying in all cases
[50:30] but some of these times uh uh God God
[50:33] God might have a gift in their life for
[50:36] setting the captives free okay and and
[50:39] so uh so but what we need today is the
[50:44] substance of life that is what makes a
[50:48] minister now again you can be a Preacher
[50:51] Song leader you can be a deacon you can
[50:53] be a musician you can be a pastor you
[50:55] can be amen and you can have you can do
[50:57] all of that and not have the Holy Ghost
[51:00] amen but any gift that we have we must
[51:05] have the power of the Holy Ghost In Our
[51:08] Lives that's when we become effective
[51:11] until then amen we're just going through
[51:13] the rituals we're going through the the
[51:16] Motions of things without the life of
[51:18] God to make that to live do you
[51:21] understand what I'm saying now now I I
[51:24] want to say and remember that there are
[51:26] gifts you know I going back to what I've
[51:29] just said Moses had the gift of God in
[51:33] his life but until he met the burning
[51:35] bush he could not find the potential
[51:38] that God ordained him to be so the
[51:41] potential coming to full potential is
[51:44] coming into the life of God Amen and and
[51:49] and and then there is something that
[51:50] really begins to transpire can you say
[51:53] Amen now now there you know there there
[51:56] are many
[51:57] nobodies there there are there are many
[51:59] nobodies that maybe they're not
[52:01] preachers maybe they can't even uh play
[52:04] music or maybe they can't even sing a
[52:07] song and yet they're just oozing with
[52:09] the Holy Ghost oil amen why because they
[52:13] they have found their contentment in
[52:17] Christ and the gift that God has placed
[52:20] in their lives they're living in with
[52:22] such a a a a sweetness of spirit and
[52:25] they you know the these these kind of
[52:27] folks are nourishing uh wherever they
[52:30] are they're they're they're so happy and
[52:33] content in Christ Jesus you see that
[52:36] that gift that is within them they are
[52:40] nurturing amen the body of Christ and
[52:44] and and and maybe maybe their name is
[52:47] not even known much in the church but
[52:49] the gift of God is within them and it's
[52:53] living and it's min ministering well
[52:56] praise the Lord amen oh you don't have
[52:58] to you don't have to be behind a Pulpit
[53:01] you don't have to sing be a singer in
[53:04] the church all you have to be is
[53:07] Anointed of the Holy Ghost and let him
[53:09] anoint those gifts on the inside of you
[53:12] well praise the Lord amen now I I would
[53:16] rather have amen uh uh that kind of a
[53:19] gift whatever the gift would be I if if
[53:22] the Lord were to give me aen more than
[53:25] being able to preach or to sing or or or
[53:28] or to testify or or or whatever else I I
[53:31] would rather be what fulfill this this
[53:36] be fulfilled on the inside with with the
[53:39] power of the Holy Spirit working through
[53:42] me then I would try to be something that
[53:45] I'm
[53:47] not Hallelujah I I think of that I amen
[53:51] I I I I think of the of of those that a
[53:55] man that brother bradam relied on and
[53:58] how he would he would go out there to
[54:00] rest and he just loved going out with
[54:02] those people because amen they they had
[54:06] something within them and they were a
[54:09] minister unto brother branam amen that's
[54:12] right so so the minister is an
[54:17] expression of the heart of God Amen you
[54:20] Mamas are an expression you wives are an
[54:24] expression
[54:25] you husbands we amen uh uh you preachers
[54:29] we you musicians whatever we are as a as
[54:33] a true minister of Jesus Christ we are
[54:38] ministering the heart of God Amen there
[54:41] and which can only come again from the
[54:43] Holy Ghost there in there in in U Romans
[54:46] 5 and 5 amen it says uh hope maketh not
[54:50] asham because the love of God is shed
[54:54] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[54:57] which is given unto us now I begin to
[55:01] think uh love I I you know I talk about
[55:04] love a lot but amen love is is is is
[55:08] something that amen a gift can only be
[55:12] effective when it is ministered by love
[55:16] amen it it is it's it's it there's the
[55:19] only way that you're going to be
[55:22] overwhelmed with results is through love
[55:26] love for him and his love for you and
[55:30] the presence of God why is it because
[55:32] it's number one it's a Divine gift amen
[55:36] it's his gift in your life number two
[55:39] the Holy Spirit germinates that gift
[55:43] with his love amen the the the God is
[55:47] love that's what that's what the uh uh
[55:50] the Apostle John said he says God is
[55:54] love so as a minister there's one thing
[55:57] the minist ministry it is it is giving
[56:01] of something it is acting on the behalf
[56:03] of it is amen it is it is it is standing
[56:07] as that Ambassador we are
[56:10] ministering his love to those around us
[56:15] amen you
[56:17] Minister the love of Christ through your
[56:20] gift unto me I minister to you through
[56:26] the gift that God has given me can you
[56:29] say amen amen now love just cannot be
[56:33] displayed without results you cannot
[56:36] display love and not get results you
[56:40] cannot have the genuine love of God in
[56:44] your heart without it manifesting
[56:47] something within us can you say Amen oh
[56:50] truly when we really begin to think of
[56:52] who we really are as the body of Jesus
[56:56] Christ that you are an ambassador of
[57:00] redemption you are the heartthrob of God
[57:04] you are an extension of God here on the
[57:08] earth the the the perfect Lamb slain for
[57:12] an imperfect world Amen and God can only
[57:16] express that through his living body
[57:20] here on the earth oh hallelujah amen AR
[57:25] you did you understand that a a perfect
[57:27] lamb for an imperfect world and God has
[57:30] chose you to express those Eternal
[57:34] attributes can you say amen amen what is
[57:38] his what is his love towards us the
[57:40] Bible says that amen he says while we
[57:43] were yet sinners God died Christ died
[57:46] for the
[57:47] ungodly can you say Amen so love is the
[57:51] very Foundation someone had asked me the
[57:54] other day they said brother wend I I I
[57:56] would like to I I could you give me any
[57:58] pointers in Ministry and it got me to
[58:02] thinking
[58:04] well studying is good uh uh praying is
[58:08] good and and all of those things are
[58:11] good but all of those things are pretty
[58:13] well
[58:14] mechanical if the call or the feeling of
[58:19] love for the people is not there because
[58:23] it's not the desire to preach it's not
[58:26] the desire to sing it's a burning love
[58:31] and compassion for people that's what
[58:35] makes a Ministry a
[58:39] Ministry man I I it we know a lot of
[58:44] people that can preach really good but
[58:46] can they Minister we know a lot of
[58:48] people that can sing really good but can
[58:51] they minister to people you see you it's
[58:54] it's it the the the
[58:57] results the results come from a genuine
[59:01] heart no matter what the gift is it
[59:05] comes from a from something burning on
[59:08] the
[59:09] inside for
[59:12] People Ministry love people amen as God
[59:18] has reconciled you now he's given you a
[59:22] Ministry and you in Christ instead say
[59:26] be reconciled unto God can you say Amen
[59:30] so love God so loved that he gave he
[59:37] gave of himself willingly the Apostle
[59:39] Paul said amen to one of the churches he
[59:42] says I have been
[59:43] spent and I'm willing to be spent again
[59:47] amen he he said amen to galatia and uh
[59:52] you know he's he's a he's getting on to
[59:54] them a little bit because they
[59:56] backslid but then he says my little
[59:58] children of whom I travail in birth
[1:00:02] again until Christ be formed in you you
[1:00:07] see there's something there I instead of
[1:00:10] sculling him and said come on man I gave
[1:00:12] you I gave you what it took and he did
[1:00:15] he did he said oh foolish Galatians who
[1:00:19] has Bewitched you that you would be
[1:00:22] moved from this soon from the gospel of
[1:00:24] Christ to another what what what what
[1:00:27] has caused you to turn around amen that
[1:00:30] was in Galatians the the first chapter
[1:00:33] but when he gets to the fourth chapter
[1:00:34] he says oh Galatians you're my
[1:00:37] children I love you and I I'm going to
[1:00:41] travail and I'm going
[1:00:43] to you give me a headache but I love
[1:00:48] you and I'm going to give of myself to
[1:00:52] you and I want to see Christ formed in
[1:00:55] you and I want you see it was the
[1:00:57] heartbeat of God being expressed because

[1:01:02] us God has been patient Time and Time
[1:01:05] and Time and Time and Time and Time and
[1:01:07] now the Apostle Paul through this gift

[1:05:05] work by
[1:05:07] what by
[1:05:09] love in order to have faith in God
[1:05:12] you've got to love him in order to have

[1:05:26] you that is oozing out you're called to
[1:05:31] be a
[1:05:33] minister now it don't matter it don't
[1:05:34] matter whether you're the eye whether
[1:05:36] you're the nose whether you're the whe
[1:05:37] whe whether you're you're you're the you
[1:05:39] know the mouth peace it don't matter
[1:05:41] there's one thing it is all comes
[1:05:44] together with
[1:05:46] love love works it all love puts it all
[1:05:50] together love initiates it through the
[1:05:53] power of the Holy Holy Ghost can you say
[1:05:55] Amen now brother Brandon would say love
[1:05:57] the Lord with all your heart with all
[1:06:00] your soul with all your mind with all
[1:06:02] your strength and faith will accompany
[1:06:06] that
[1:06:07] love he says now notice Abraham had to
[1:06:11] love God to believe him and you you love
[1:06:15] him and more you love him the more faith
[1:06:18] you will accumulate amen so so so so
[1:06:23] Saints let just let me just put it the
[1:06:26] world is
[1:06:28] looking for
[1:06:33] ministers while you're thinking the
[1:06:35] world is going to reject your
[1:06:38] ministry the world is looking for
[1:06:43] ministers they're looking for
[1:06:47] someone to love
[1:06:53] them in fact the prophet would tell us
[1:06:56] he would say the world is dying for
[1:06:59] love the church is dying for love Jesus
[1:07:03] said you're the salt of the earth but if
[1:07:05] you lose if the salt has lost its savor
[1:07:08] it is henceforth good for nothing but to
[1:07:10] be trod under the feet of men and if the
[1:07:13] church has lost its divine revelation of
[1:07:17] the love of God it becomes a mock a
[1:07:21] stalk a stumbling block to the
[1:07:24] world so the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:07:28] can only come through his body it can
[1:07:31] only come through you and through me it
[1:07:33] can cannot come through anybody else it
[1:07:35] can only come through his Earthly body
[1:07:38] which is the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[1:07:40] are the bride coming of Christ can I
[1:07:42] hear an
[1:07:44] amen but we've got to but love is what
[1:07:50] initiates that gift that is within in
[1:07:54] our lives amen the world needs to know
[1:07:57] that they matter the world needs to know
[1:08:00] that amen that you care enough to show
[1:08:03] it hey people in the church need to know
[1:08:06] that they matter amen I need to know
[1:08:09] that I matter you need to know that you
[1:08:12] matter come on church we all we we all
[1:08:16] need to know that we
[1:08:21] matter now
[1:08:25] amen you take the blind Mexican
[1:08:30] man and and and the healing and how that
[1:08:33] healing
[1:08:34] transpired there in there in
[1:08:38] Mexico that healing
[1:08:42] transpired amen from the love of one
[1:08:46] mortal to another mortal being now now I
[1:08:49] want you to catch this The Compassion
[1:08:52] from one mortal
[1:08:54] to another mortal being produced healing
[1:08:58] brother brandham says I remember one
[1:09:00] night there was an old Mexican dad come
[1:09:03] across the platform and he didn't have
[1:09:05] any shoes his trousers were all torn off
[1:09:08] and he had an old hat in his hand and
[1:09:10] sold up with twine cord no coat no shirt
[1:09:13] on Gray beard over his face and he was
[1:09:16] blind and he and I thought when he come
[1:09:19] that perhaps somebody's daddy maybe
[1:09:22] maybe the enemy's been so cruel to him
[1:09:25] the people in Mexico don't don't get to
[1:09:28] live like we do here their economics are
[1:09:31] are very poorly balanced so I looked at
[1:09:34] him and he and he got close to me he was
[1:09:37] Catholic by faith he took out a crucifix
[1:09:40] or a a prayer a prayer beads and begin
[1:09:43] to say his prayer uh over uh prayer
[1:09:45] beads over and I spoke to him that it
[1:09:48] wasn't necessary just then and he kept
[1:09:51] wanting to find me he was blind and when
[1:09:53] when I got my arms around the old fella
[1:09:56] I thought my if my daddy would have
[1:09:58] lived he would have been about the age
[1:10:00] of that man he was somebody's Daddy and
[1:10:04] there he was almost naked maybe had
[1:10:06] worked many a hard day to raise some
[1:10:09] little children and then besides all of
[1:10:11] that he was blind I had a good suit good
[1:10:14] pair of shoes I put my foot up to the
[1:10:16] side of his I was going to give him my
[1:10:20] shoes but his foot was larger than mine
[1:10:23] my showers nothing like like would me
[1:10:26] out with him I couldn't give him my coat
[1:10:29] I thought poor old fella and you know
[1:10:32] you have to enter into the suffering of
[1:10:36] a person to have feelings for them if I
[1:10:40] if I if it ever gets to a place that I
[1:10:43] can't feel sorry for the sick then it's
[1:10:45] time for me to leave the platform
[1:10:47] praying for them when I when I get to a
[1:10:50] place that I can't feel the burden of
[1:10:53] sin on the people then it's time for me
[1:10:55] to get away from here because I can
[1:10:57] never do no good for God it's the
[1:11:00] feeling you have for the people somebody
[1:11:02] say it's the feeling feeling you have
[1:11:06] for the
[1:11:07] people that's what makes a
[1:11:11] Ministry not a
[1:11:14] sermon the
[1:11:16] feeling you say well how how can I have
[1:11:19] feeling for the People by playing music
[1:11:22] your desire is to bring his presence
[1:11:27] down hallelujah what can you say Amen
[1:11:30] your desire to see the presence of God
[1:11:34] come upon that brother or sister then it
[1:11:36] don't matter whether you're behind the
[1:11:37] pulpit or not then it don't matter
[1:11:39] whether you're in church or not then it
[1:11:40] don't matter anything then it's a body
[1:11:44] that is working oh can you say Amen oh
[1:11:48] my Hallelujah I say this right now amen
[1:11:53] the the gift that you have is just as
[1:11:55] powerful and important as the gift of
[1:11:58] Malachi 4 the purpose for Malachi for
[1:12:01] was to turn your hearts back around so
[1:12:04] that God could put his ministry and
[1:12:06] bring his ministry to a living reality
[1:12:09] through you don't don't don't ever don't
[1:12:11] don't ever get to the point brother
[1:12:12] Donald Amen to where you think that
[1:12:14] you're uh you're you're witnessing the
[1:12:16] way you do and you calling and and and
[1:12:19] talking to the down and out and
[1:12:20] encouraging them and and and that that
[1:12:22] that it is it is minist you no God gave
[1:12:25] you that burden God placed that upon
[1:12:27] your life God gave you that love for
[1:12:32] people God gave that love it is a
[1:12:36] Ministry and it's just as important as
[1:12:39] my ministry as a
[1:12:43] pastor pastor's Ministry is no more
[1:12:45] important than the congregation's
[1:12:47] ministry we've all called with gifts and
[1:12:52] call
[1:12:53] ings in our
[1:12:56] lives can you say
[1:12:58] amen he says it's the feeling you have
[1:13:00] for the
[1:13:01] people he says you know it's a love that
[1:13:05] you project to the people that they know
[1:13:08] that you love
[1:13:09] them and they love you and you can feel
[1:13:13] it there's something that happens then
[1:13:18] and when I was praying for the old
[1:13:19] fellow a vision came and he had his head
[1:13:22] laying over on shoulders patting me when
[1:13:25] I was praying he couldn't understand
[1:13:28] what I was saying because he couldn't
[1:13:30] speak English but I was looking this way
[1:13:32] praying for him and as I opened my eyes
[1:13:35] brother esosa was repeating the prayer
[1:13:37] over in Spanish out to one side and I
[1:13:39] looked and I seen the old man just
[1:13:42] jumping in a vision with a sight I knew
[1:13:45] he had it then so I just pull him up
[1:13:48] like this and I believe the the Mexican
[1:13:51] word is Gloria deos something like that
[1:13:54] Glory of Glory to God and and that's it
[1:13:58] he hollered that way he could see he
[1:14:01] could see and down from the platform he
[1:14:04] went just jumping as hard as he could
[1:14:07] jump he could see it was a
[1:14:12] compassion oh God you
[1:14:16] see the
[1:14:18] gifts it's not an
[1:14:22] education it's it's not an education you

[1:14:38] of a gift of God in my life I just loved
[1:14:42] people and when I saw somebody hurting I

[1:23:22] and taking care of your family and your
[1:23:25] children did you know the brother that's
[1:23:26] a quote that brother Brenham says amen
[1:23:30] some were predestinated to be a
[1:23:32] plumber some were for ordained to be a
[1:23:35] preacher some were for ordained to be a
[1:23:38] farmer some are for ordained to be
[1:23:40] Housewives to take care of their family
[1:23:43] he says and at the end of the day you'll
[1:23:46] get the same
[1:23:49] reward because it's Ministry can you say
[1:23:53] Amen you see amen we do we do whatever
[1:23:58] we need amen love drives you to do
[1:24:02] whatever is required love drives you to
[1:24:04] step up if it's to mle the lawn or uh
[1:24:08] you know mo mo an Elder's lawn or or or
[1:24:12] you know I I hear I hear some of you you
[1:24:14] ladies are are are are helping you know
[1:24:16] feeding sister Angie this week and and
[1:24:19] and uh you know uh we cleaning a house
[1:24:22] house or or doing something it's a
[1:24:25] Ministry from the earth there's
[1:24:28] something within us that are driving us
[1:24:31] for one another we love one
[1:24:34] another and it
[1:24:37] creates a Minister's
[1:24:40] heart praise the
[1:24:43] Lord now only the Holy Ghost can do that
[1:24:46] because we found out that there in 1
[1:24:48] Corinthians the 14th chapter that you
[1:24:51] can give your body to be burned and not
[1:24:53] have love you can give all of your goods
[1:24:55] to the poor and not have love you can do
[1:24:58] all of that in other words it's a
[1:25:00] showman it's something to be seen amen
[1:25:03] and that's where us preachers have got
[1:25:05] to be careful make sure we ain't just
[1:25:07] amen servants because we're up here to
[1:25:09] be seen it's got to be right here I
[1:25:14] love servants
[1:25:16] heart for the
[1:25:19] people can you see man
[1:25:23] he says you can have all of
[1:25:24] that but you have not charity then it
[1:25:27] profits you nothing praise the
[1:25:30] Lord but when the Holy Ghost places that
[1:25:32] you become
[1:25:35] burdened and we don't just become
[1:25:36] burdened I'm I'm I'm I'm I've got a few
[1:25:39] more pages here and then I'm going to
[1:25:40] close you don't just become burdened for
[1:25:44] Saint it's not for just us for and no
[1:25:50] more but we become burdened
[1:25:53] for sa an
[1:25:57] Center we become burdened we're God's

[1:26:17] whether they can Minister back to me

[1:26:21] not it that's that matter just so long
[1:26:23] as I am fulfilled and brother there is
[1:26:26] nothing that can fulfill a man with a
[1:26:28] Ministry there is nothing that can
[1:26:30] fulfill that man like like reaching out
[1:26:34] and helping the hurting and encouraging
[1:26:37] the weary it don't matter what he gets
[1:26:39] back that man is
[1:26:43] fulfilled don't matter whether he's
[1:26:45] living in a in a in a in a big sty it
[1:26:48] don't matter whether he's driving a nice
[1:26:50] car or or not car he's fulfilled when he
[1:26:55] is helping
[1:27:02] people While
[1:27:07] others are putting money in the
[1:27:10] bank buying
[1:27:13] land looking to grow their
[1:27:17] portfolio a
[1:27:21] minister has got his mind and heart on

[1:28:33] Africa you're a
[1:28:39] minister you're a minister you you're
[1:28:42] fulfilled
[1:28:43] because you're giving of
[1:28:46] yourself oh can you say
[1:28:49] man you
[1:28:51] see brother window how how can that be H
[1:28:55] how how can it be you
[1:28:58] see you have the end product in mind
[1:29:02] some Waters some Souls some reaps but
[1:29:07] it's God who gives that
[1:29:10] increase can you say Amen you man have
[1:29:13] notice Paul there in 1 Corinthians 9
[1:29:15] and6 he's feeling the weight of his call
[1:29:18] upon his life and I watch how he handled
[1:29:21] that gift
[1:29:24] and this is something that I've tried
[1:29:25] to put into action within my own
[1:29:28] personal life over the
[1:29:30] years and that's there in uh uh there in
[1:29:32] 1 Corinthians 9:16 for though I preach
[1:29:35] the gospel I have nothing to Glory of
[1:29:39] for necessity is laid upon me y wo is
[1:29:43] unto me if I preach not the gospel for I
[1:29:47] do this
[1:29:48] willingly I have a reward but if against
[1:29:51] my will a disp ens ation of the Gospel
[1:29:53] is committed unto me in other words I I
[1:29:56] know my
[1:29:57] place I'm the Apostle to the
[1:30:00] Gentiles and if I don't fulfill
[1:30:04] this I'm going to have to
[1:30:07] answer he says what is my reward then
[1:30:11] verily that when I preach the
[1:30:14] gospel I may make the gospel of Christ
[1:30:18] without charge that I abuse not my power
[1:30:22] the gospel for though I be free from all
[1:30:25] men yet have I made myself servant unto
[1:30:30] all now watch watch is coming out of him
[1:30:33] watch him that I might
[1:30:41] gain and everything that I'm doing
[1:30:44] everything that I'm doing I've got souls
[1:30:46] in my mind everything that I'm doing
[1:30:49] I've got a purpose I've got a strategy
[1:30:56] I made myself a servant so that I can
[1:30:59] gain the more and then he tells us how
[1:31:02] he does it unto the
[1:31:04] Jews I become as a
[1:31:07] Jew that I might gain the Jews to them
[1:31:11] them are under the law as under the law
[1:31:12] that I might gain them that are under
[1:31:14] the law to them that are without the law
[1:31:18] as without being not without the law to
[1:31:21] God but under the law to Christ that I
[1:31:24] might gain them that are without the law
[1:31:27] to the weak became I as
[1:31:29] weak that I may gain the
[1:31:31] weak I have made all things to all
[1:31:36] men that I by all
[1:31:38] means might save
[1:31:41] some and this I do for the gospel's
[1:31:44] sake that I might be partakers
[1:31:48] thereof with
[1:31:49] you can you say Amen
[1:31:54] what would this mean to
[1:32:00] us that means
[1:32:02] sometimes we get on the kids' level and
[1:32:06] we let those kids get confidence in us
[1:32:12] and
[1:32:14] we we love them and we place value upon
[1:32:19] them what are we doing
[1:32:27] I love all of you kids and the
[1:32:32] reason the reason that
[1:32:34] I let you kids know that I love
[1:32:38] you it's because I want you kids to love
[1:32:41] me and I want you to trust me when I
[1:32:42] tell you about
[1:32:45] Jesus I want you to know that I'm very
[1:32:48] real that I'm very
[1:32:50] sincere

[1:32:57] today and there's this Holiness woman
[1:33:00] and and then her daughter with
[1:33:05] her L looked to me like she was in her
[1:33:10] 30s you know not Holiness cut hair
[1:33:13] and and we've seen a lot of that I'm
[1:33:16] sure you have or we've
[1:33:18] seen a lot of
[1:33:20] it
[1:33:22] in the apostolic churches and also in
[1:33:26] the Holiness the the trinitarian
[1:33:28] Holiness
[1:33:30] circles and more so in the trinitarian
[1:33:33] Holiness
[1:33:34] circles they preach all the dos and the
[1:33:36] don'ts they get up and they don't and
[1:33:38] and and and and there's and and there
[1:33:40] there there is that something that they
[1:33:42] are talking about we we we've lost the
[1:33:45] younger
[1:33:50] generation and I thought somebody
[1:33:52] somewhere somebody
[1:33:58] somewhere
[1:34:00] Ministry
[1:34:02] escaped
[1:34:12] somewhere they're gone they're out the
[1:34:16] doors but it does my heart good to see
[1:34:20] people here in the church
[1:34:24] that still understand that you have a
[1:34:32] Ministry and those of us with wward
[1:34:36] children we know that we're applying the
[1:34:38] token and every one of them's coming

[1:35:30] ourselves and for you those of you that
[1:35:35] came to the wedding the other day to
[1:35:37] support these kids instead of out
[1:35:41] hunting or whatever you know golfing or
[1:35:43] whatever you could be doing but you were
[1:35:45] here to support it was a
[1:35:48] Ministry those who bake the pies and for
[1:35:51] the pie auction and those who gave amen
[1:35:56] you remember what it was like when you
[1:35:58] were a kid starting out and you gave out
[1:36:01] of your own need to help these kids

[1:36:32] people you

[1:36:37] up this way here I was this is supposed
[1:36:39] to be an encouraging
[1:36:42] message I feel what I'm
[1:36:45] saying
[1:36:48] ministers there ain't too many ministers
[1:36:50] left in the world
[1:36:53] there's not too
[1:36:54] many there's not too many
[1:37:01] ministers that'll put their schedule on
[1:37:03] hold so that they can be a blessing to
[1:37:06] somebody
[1:37:08] else they're wrapped up in me and mine
[1:37:11] what will you do when you stand before
[1:37:14] God and give an account for your
[1:37:20] life
[1:37:30] Jesus looked at
[1:37:34] the
[1:37:38] disciples he says the day will
[1:37:40] come there in Matthew 25 and
[1:37:44] 35 he said I was
[1:37:46] hungered and you gave me
[1:37:50] meat
[1:37:51] I was thirsty and you gave me
[1:37:54] drink I was a stranger and you took me
[1:37:57] in naked and you clothed me I was sick
[1:38:00] and you visited me I was in prison and
[1:38:02] you came to
[1:38:04] me then shall the righteous answer him
[1:38:06] saying
[1:38:07] Lord when saw we thee hungered and fed
[1:38:12] thee or thirsty and gave thee to drink
[1:38:15] when did we see you a stranger and took
[1:38:17] you you in naked and clothed thee
[1:38:22] when saw we thee sick or in prison and
[1:38:26] came unto
[1:38:27] thee and Jesus and the King shall answer
[1:38:31] and say unto them verily I say unto you
[1:38:35] in as much as you have done it unto one
[1:38:38] of the least of my
[1:38:42] brethren you have done
[1:38:44] it unto
[1:38:48] me the rewards
[1:38:53] it was so it was it was so part of them
[1:38:59] that they didn't even know that they got
[1:39:01] it it was so part of their inner being
[1:39:04] this is not something you can teach
[1:39:06] yourself it's not something that you can
[1:39:07] you can say a preacher can get up and
[1:39:09] and say you got to do this and you got
[1:39:11] to do this and you got to do this and
[1:39:12] you say yes sir now I'm going to be a
[1:39:13] minister no it's something that only the
[1:39:16] Holy Spirit can do right
[1:39:20] here
[1:39:22] and brother brandom says they done it so
[1:39:26] unconsciously they just done it because
[1:39:28] they seen a
[1:39:29] need they just done it because somebody
[1:39:34] asked for help they just done it
[1:39:40] because they wanted to be a blessing and
[1:39:42] Jesus says when you've done
[1:39:44] it to me or you done it to
[1:39:49] them you you've done it to
[1:39:58] me oh
[1:40:01] Jesus you
[1:40:07] see brother Brenham would put this
[1:40:14] and he talked about Israel going through
[1:40:17] horri on their
[1:40:19] journey and he says now that's name horb
[1:40:22] means a dry place or a desert he says
[1:40:25] that's when we get out of fellowship
[1:40:26] with one another in the church and out
[1:40:28] of the blessing or the fellowship with
[1:40:29] the holy spirit that brings us to a dry
[1:40:31] place a desert and nothing alive
[1:40:32] everything got stickers on it a little
[1:40:36] piece of cactus with a sticker on it did
[1:40:38] you know what it is that's a precious
[1:40:41] little Tender Leaf that hasn't got no
[1:40:43] water it's just wound itself up so tight
[1:40:46] that it's a sticker and when you see
[1:40:48] somebody like that maybe it's a precious
[1:40:50] soul that could be water Ed right would
[1:40:52] have been a tender little leaf or
[1:40:54] something but instead it's wound up till
[1:40:56] it's a sticker just punching at
[1:40:58] everything and you know Finding fault
[1:41:00] and only only thing it needs is just
[1:41:03] some water it just needs a Revival or a
[1:41:06] breaking up a refreshing from the Lord
[1:41:10] and it'll unfold its little self if you
[1:41:12] just put some water to it but that's
[1:41:15] where them who live in that place has to
[1:41:17] suffer with the conditions of that place
[1:41:21] those who desire to live in that kind of
[1:41:23] an an atmosphere of where everything's
[1:41:25] just punching and fussing and whirling
[1:41:27] and stewing and you'll just live under
[1:41:30] that atmosphere that's
[1:41:31] all but we don't have to live
[1:41:34] there it's not necessary for us to live
[1:41:37] there can you say
[1:41:39] Amen how many wants you say oh brother
[1:41:45] when if I was just
[1:41:48] gifted if God would just use
[1:41:53] me you don't just have a
[1:41:58] gift but he gave
[1:42:04] severally God has given gifts to each of
[1:42:14] us you

[1:42:49] will have a Ministry it will be a
[1:42:53] powerful Ministry it's not a
[1:42:57] Onan Ministry it will be as the prophet
[1:43:00] would say a body bride body Ministry it
[1:43:06] requires every one of
[1:43:12] us but no matter the gift the common
[1:43:16] denominator is love shed abroad in our
[1:43:20] heart Hearts by the Holy
[1:43:23] Ghost that's the common
[1:43:25] denominator can you say
[1:43:30] Amen
[1:43:34] no I came to the conclusion a long time
[1:43:37] ago I would not be a big time
[1:43:39] Pastor although I had those
[1:43:43] dreams
[1:43:45] Allelujah I showed when I graduated we
[1:43:49] had from high
[1:43:51] school we had the tssa world out there
[1:43:56] they did and um so they were taking
[1:43:59] pictures and they wrote this deal about
[1:44:01] me and uh this young man sung soulfully
[1:44:06] when he
[1:44:08] prayed it was as if he has talked to God
[1:44:11] before and I'm Going H yes so they
[1:44:14] interviewed me and they asked they asked
[1:44:16] me what what what are your dreams well
[1:44:19] my instructor was a little bit
[1:44:20] disappointed because he wanted me to
[1:44:22] talk about his school and the electrical
[1:44:25] program I didn't I mean the first thing
[1:44:27] came to my mind was is
[1:44:29] Souls I told him I'm want to be an
[1:44:32] evangelist I'm going to win thousands
[1:44:35] I'm going to preach Hallelujah and I'm
[1:44:38] telling the I'm I'm I'm just a 16year
[1:44:40] old
[1:44:41] kid and
[1:44:43] uh so we found that newspaper article
[1:44:46] here sometime back I sh the boys Caleb
[1:44:50] looked at that and looked at me and
[1:44:52] looked at that and then looked back at
[1:44:54] me and says what happened
[1:44:59] Dad ain't quite I ain't quite made it
[1:45:04] there but that's all
[1:45:07] right God ain't called me for that and
[1:45:09] God ain't called me for
[1:45:16] that I'm in the people
[1:45:19] business
[1:45:21] God's called me to set captives
[1:45:24] free God's called me to heal the
[1:45:28] brokenhearted I don't know I've been
[1:45:30] preaching on preachers
[1:45:32] lately I've been thinking along these
[1:45:37] lines I've been thinking how we need
[1:45:40] people how people of PA need to hear
[1:45:44] this message of Jesus
[1:45:49] Christ
[1:45:52] you go around town and you see so many
[1:45:54] of
[1:45:55] these these kids and it's easy to say
[1:45:58] all like that
[1:46:01] Thug but do they know anything about
[1:46:05] Jesus you
[1:46:10] understand see the only thing that can
[1:46:12] truly help
[1:46:14] them and the only way I can have faith
[1:46:17] in humanity again is for me to have a
[1:46:22] love for me to love those
[1:46:26] people and want to help those
[1:46:29] people are you understanding if I'm
[1:46:32] missing the faith in them and the
[1:46:36] missing the faith in what God oh it's
[1:46:38] easy for us to say the door is closing
[1:46:40] we just ain't got no more just going to
[1:46:42] have to hear amen but brother there's
[1:46:44] still a soul
[1:46:49] somewhere
[1:46:50] [Applause]
[1:46:53] I know we got excited here a while back
[1:46:55] when a family came we thought oh
[1:47:01] yes but we got to keep right on we got
[1:47:04] to keep right on a
[1:47:06] sharing we got to keep right on it
[1:47:09] giv I'm preaching to me too but I'm
[1:47:12] saying we've all got that gift can you
[1:47:15] say
[1:47:16] amen God bless you here this
[1:47:19] evening
[1:47:21] are we going to do it it ain't going to
[1:47:24] be being spiritual to one another
[1:47:27] matters of fact you're going to deal
[1:47:28] with each other in the flesh and the
[1:47:30] spirit a lot more than you're going to
[1:47:31] deal with each other in the soulless
[1:47:35] real
[1:47:38] hallelujah sister Angie ain't needing
[1:47:40] her soul safe

[1:47:55] God's little ones

[1:48:02] good when you're preaching the word no
[1:48:04] no no no
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:08] Ministry is a body fitly framed
[1:48:12] together and US carrying enough for
[1:48:14] somebody else to get out of our stinking
[1:48:16] comfort zone and love somebody else like
[1:48:19] you haven't done in a long
[1:48:29] time
[1:48:31] ministry is serving someone
[1:48:39] else I don't care whether you're getting
[1:48:41] up in the middle of the night to go hug
[1:48:42] a bubble a boy across the across town
[1:48:46] it's missing a
[1:48:49] daddy
[1:48:51] and crying and you have to hold him till
[1:48:54] he falls
[1:48:56] asleep I don't care if you happen
[1:48:59] to help
[1:49:01] prostitutes I don't care if you

[1:49:38] of things outside the
[1:49:42] doors I got a news flash for you as I'm
[1:49:46] closing some of you are
[1:49:49] saying
[1:49:51] if I could just do away with people they
[1:49:53] just make me
[1:49:57] nervous without
[1:49:59] people you have no
[1:50:04] Ministry go back and what read what
[1:50:06] Jesus said the spirit of the Lord God is
[1:50:08] upon me he hath anointed
[1:50:11] me not to sit on a mountain and have a
[1:50:15] holy Comm he already had Holy Communion
[1:50:17] between him and God he had to go come
[1:50:19] down to earth he had to come down to
[1:50:21] people he had to come down to those that
[1:50:24] didn't like
[1:50:27] him he ate with
[1:50:32] Sinners he was
[1:50:36] despised healing people and delivering
[1:50:39] them when he knew good and well doing it
[1:50:41] on the Sabbath day he was going to be
[1:50:42] kicked out of the
[1:50:47] synagogue but he loved people
[1:50:54] he looked out there one day and he
[1:50:56] said he starts crying he
[1:50:59] says I see
[1:51:01] all of these people as
[1:51:04] sheep with no
[1:51:07] Shepherd and then the scripture
[1:51:10] says and he was
[1:51:13] moved with
[1:51:16] compassion over the
[1:51:18] multitudes
[1:51:22] because they didn't have a
[1:51:25] Shepherd they were
[1:51:32] lost you are his
[1:51:36] body you
[1:51:38] are his body here on the
[1:51:43] earth can you say am
[1:51:48] man
[1:51:53] as I close musicians come the shemite
[1:52:06] woman she was always serving
[1:52:16] Elijah Elijah was her pastor and he
[1:52:21] she just
[1:52:23] loved she loved her
[1:52:30] pastor and brother Brenham
[1:52:33] said she had realized that Elijah was a
[1:52:36] servant of God and when they would come
[1:52:39] by that way she'd always try to do him a
[1:52:41] little favor try to be kind of him to
[1:52:45] him if there's anything that we ought to
[1:52:47] be it's kind to one another when you see
[1:52:50] a brother or sister in a fault don't
[1:52:52] don't never never breathe it to nobody
[1:52:56] keep it to yourself pray for that
[1:52:58] person be kind to
[1:53:01] them and if the spirit of God is in you
[1:53:04] then you will be kind to one another
[1:53:06] Jesus said I come to do the will thy
[1:53:09] will
[1:53:10] father where about the Master's
[1:53:14] business as he was about the father's
[1:53:17] business and the spame spirit that he
[1:53:20] had to begin the works of the father and
[1:53:22] to finish the atonement to make a way
[1:53:25] that we could carry the message it's
[1:53:27] that Spirit that's in
[1:53:29] you you'll have the same attitude
[1:53:31] towards
[1:53:33] people trying to do what you can to help
[1:53:36] them no matter who they are where they
[1:53:39] are you'll try to help
[1:53:41] people amen that's kind of strong but
[1:53:44] that's the truth that's
[1:53:48] right rather friends that the time has
[1:53:51] come that we're nearing the end and
[1:53:52] something's got to be
[1:53:54] done we've got to have rapturing
[1:53:58] faith right away
[1:54:02] now but he goes on and he he begins to
[1:54:06] talk
[1:54:08] about how that little
[1:54:10] lady had talked to her husband
[1:54:15] and said he comes and he's so
[1:54:18] tired
[1:54:20] so
[1:54:26] weary she said can we build a little
[1:54:29] room for
[1:54:32] him can we build a
[1:54:35] room that way we'll put a little bowl in
[1:54:39] there and a bed and a little Basin and
[1:54:45] chair that way he can come and rest and
[1:54:59] God seen
[1:55:01] that God
[1:55:05] seen she wasn't the one healing she
[1:55:08] wasn't the prophet she wasn't the one
[1:55:10] doing all of that she was
[1:55:13] simply the
[1:55:15] one
[1:55:18] helping
[1:55:20] she didn't have the vision she didn't
[1:55:22] have the word of God she wasn't the
[1:55:25] pastor all she was is just wanted to
[1:55:27] give courage and strength and
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:34] support and she got the prophet's
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:45] reward brother Brandon would stop and he
[1:55:48] would say it
[1:55:50] pays to be
[1:55:52] friends with a
[1:56:02] prophet I look at all of us here

[2:14:43] Lord I love you
[2:14:46] Lord
[2:14:49] I've thought about
[2:14:52] how our sisters are such servants here
[2:14:55] in the church and I ran across a a
[2:14:58] scripture today and I just almost wanted
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:02] to I just almost wanted to start crying
[2:15:06] then Philippians 4 and 2 it says I
[2:15:09] beseech udas and
[2:15:13] beseech
[2:15:15] s that they be of the same mind
[2:15:18] in the Lord and I entreat thee also true

[2:15:38] also and with other my fellow laborers
[2:15:41] whose names are in the book of
[2:15:45] life that I thought
[2:15:48] [Music]
[2:15:50] Paul had those precious
[2:15:56] sisters we know they weren't called to
[2:15:58] preach because he had already told us
[2:16:02] that a woman wasn't to
[2:16:07] preach but I think that they were a lot
[2:16:10] like the ladies here at our church just
[2:16:12] doing what they can to see the work of
[2:16:14] the Lord go on and strengthen the hands
[2:16:21] that's
[2:16:23] labored in the
