good friend of ours and and a good friend of yours and but I want to tell you amen he doesn't bring Revival in a suitcase well glory amen we bring the Revival it's our hunger that brings the Revival so if you're pulling on the gift here [Music] today I love that what brother Andrew said last night he said you're not the only one one pulling you're not the only one responding God's responding when that predestinated seat on the inside of you is screaming out for more of God then God comes on the scene and he'll respond Hallelujah so we're going to ask brother Timothy to come and to deliver the word of the Lord today amen now we didn't complete our prayer last night we asked the Lord to stop the rain and and he did I mean it was almost immediately the rain stopped but we didn't ask for Sunshine and uh so amen so we're going to continue to pray that the Lord will just give us amen sunshine and and um but I I appreciate the Lord Jesus today it doesn't matter what's going on on the outside what matters is what's here on the inside and brother if you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost I ask you today just get something down deep in your soul get things out of your heart and say Lord I I want everything removed from me that'll that'll that that would hinder me from receiving the holy ghost or getting closer to you amen I believe God loves every one of you amen touching Jesus

way and we're so thankful Lord you are the guide you are the leader in this life that we're in Father may we just submit our hearts to you there be one here today that don't know you may they find you Lord this morning there'll be one here that don't know the purpose in their life may they find that purpose that purpose to serve you and to love you and to live for you we pray Lord we commit this service this weekend into your hands Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 3 amen also Hebrews chapter 6 if you would just like to say it's an honor to be here with you thank brother Wendell and the and the team here for the invitation to come and amen something we don't take lightly but amen it's something that's very dear to our heart amen this generation that amen you had to fight things that we didn't have to to fight he had to go through things we didn't have to go through but we still have the same God and the same God to take you through that takes us through amen and amen we're thankful to uh be serving the Living God to this day and amen a god who's the same yesterday today and forever and amen God bless you this morning I I just like to speak to you on faith to fulfill amen Faith to fulfill Matthew chapter 3 and verse 13 says then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee thou Come Thou comest thou to me and Jesus answered him said suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he's baptized went straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened up to him and he saw the spirit of God descend like a dove and lighting upon him and ler voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased I just look real quick at a few words becometh means it's fitting or it's proper or it's right and to fulfill is to bring to completion or reality to achieve or realize something that's desired or promised amen Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 4 says for it is impossible for those those who are once enlightened to have taste of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again to repentant sin They Crucified themselves the Son of God AR fresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom is dress receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and nigh un cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you things that accompany salvation thus we though we thus speak for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name that you ministered the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patient inherit the promise for when God made the promise to Abraham because he' swear he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely bless him I will bless thee and multitud multiply and I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he had obtained the promise amen God bless you you can be seated we sure appreciated brother Andrew we sure appreciate his ministry and amen and the way God uses him we're so thankful to see amen a young man of his stature to be able to rise up in this evil age that we live and to show the devil that you can overcome in this world Amen that amen that you can apply yourself amen as a young person to the word of God and and God bless you and we're we're so thankful for that you know I I was thinking on my way up here as I begin to think about these services and and the Lord began to deal with me uh kind of uh as maybe say on on a kind of a new horse I hadn't preached this sermon before so a lot of times a preacher likes to be comfortable in that and maybe preach something he's already went over before but the Lord laid these things upon my heart and I found this quote that begin to really dwell with me and in my inner man as I begin to think about it said I think it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we are here in the first place amen and who was kind enough to bring us here amen who was kind enough to bring us here we ought to consider and ask him what he would have us to do amen the purpose of Us coming and to fulfill what he has purposed for us to fulfill every one of us has has a part to play every one of us it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter where you come from it doesn't matter amen your your stature or your or your uh uh how how rich or how poor you are that matters nothing Amen in the eyes of God but every one of you is important every one of you has a part to play and every one of you need to take a moment and say why am I here why why why I you know I don't believe you just came to just sit on a white chair in a in a building or or to be around some friends play some volleyball but I I believe there ought to be something deeper on the inside of us that are wondering why am I here why did somebody think of me so much in the first place and was kind enough to allow me to be born in this time that I'm living in amen and were you were one in a million amen when you were born it was worn out out of millions that could have made it amen to that egg to be gerti but God chose you and he brought you to this place not to just sit on a Pew or not to just be a a young person in Leo deia age but amen To Be A God Called child of God Amen that God could put something in your life or desire Amen to fulfill and you know as we're coming why are we coming why are we coming to youth camps why are we going to church why are we living where we're living at why is God placed Us in the place that we are at you know I believe that we've come to this meeting amen not to just meet somebody and if you meet somebody that's fine or not to just Fellowship but if you fellowship with somebody that's fine but it's for a purpose and that purpose is to find a New Hope Amen to find what God has a has planned for us in our lives we are on this Earth here and we know we're living in darkness we we don't have to imagine that we don't have to uh kid ourselves we know that we are living in the shadow of death and never in my lifetime have I se heard so much on the news about nuclear warfare and nuclear destruction and everybody's threatening everybody's doing all this wars and rumors of wars we are living in the shadow of death but we are also living in the time of the coming of the Lord so amen we don't get our eyes upon all of that things of the things of the world because if you do you'll get depressed and down I don't have no future let me tell you you got one of the greatest Futures that could ever be upon the face of the Earth your future future is not a home somewhere in Oklahoma or Louisiana or Ohio wherever you came from your future is in glory amen amen living and praising the King of Kings but we're living in darkness and and we hear the screams of the ambulances and we past cemeteries and there's still caskets and and there's still death and and you know if it's nothing but death we're a doomed people amen both young and old it doesn't matter how young you are amen if you have nothing but death before you you are a doomed person amen but we we come in such a place this morning Amen to gather hopes it's a A New Hope of what we're here for and what is the purpose and he said brother the prophet of God said I think that this is a wonderful time to think on the hopes that God has given us hallelujah we want to draw in our minds that there not be one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of God is fulfilled amen he who has has created us has given us a purpose and there's nothing that can stop it there's nothing that can destroy it amen we were made for a purpose amen this building was made for a purpose and somebody that was building thought maybe you know I just build a building out here and my do but listen God had a purpose for this building he knew that there would be his chosen people and would sit here and hear the words of God and would gain strength and and would would be f fil with the Holy Ghost amen it was built for a purpose it wasn't this Foundation was not dug and and the cornerstones laid and the blocks or the tin or the post put there just to see if it could be done God put it here for a purpose amen your your home you live in has a purpose amen the car you drive has a purpose it wasn't built to just see if it could be done but it was built for a purpose amen clothes you wear are for a purpose the food you eat is for a purpose God did not just make a tree to see if he can make a tree amen but a tree serves a purpose amen therefore he did not create you to just see if he could create you he created you for a purpose he created you that you could come in this time that we're living in for such a time as this amen that you could be live that you could live that you could die that you could uh fight that you could reain why he built you for a purpose purp sometimes you get to feel it like nobody cares nobody I know how I know how it is amen I used to be a young person too the devil tells you you're by yourself there's nobody cares about you nobody understands what you're going through you ought to just commit suicide you ought to just do this you ought to just do that nobody cares but that God has come in this service to tell you I care about you and I've made you for a purpose I brought you here amen you just didn't come on your own accord you didn't just come because you thought it was a good idea but I brought you here and I have put you in this place that my glory may be revealed in you God didn't make you and I just to see if he can make you and I he made you for a purpose there's a purpose for all of us being here hallelujah you're not here just to to be another human being hello somebody you're here to be what God called you to be see the devil wants you to get all tore up about what somebody else is and what you're not so we got to buy clothes like somebody else has and we got to have a house like somebody else has listen that's not the purpose of God God brought you here to serve his purpose Amen to bring amen it's a specific thing he put you here for no matter how little you are how insignificant you feel how big you are how important you are or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose amen just as you know my your finger has a purpose and the nail on your finger has a purpose your eye every part of your body has a purpose seen or unseen and many times the Unseen are more important than the scene come on somebody well nobody sees me well that tells you just how important you are amen my finger is here for a purpose the nail is here for a purpose my eye every part of our body it was not put here to just see what it would look like if it was put there amen if we were put here for a purpose then we are God's purpose he did you on purpose you are not an accident come on somebody you are not an accident you're not accidentally here you're not accidentally sitting in the seat you didn't accidentally get in the car and come here you are here for a purpose you're here for God's will to be fulfilled in your [Applause] life the devil wants to tell you you're an accident the devil wants to tell you that you just you're nobody you're unimportant they said you're the most important people on the face of this [Applause] Earth what he's wanting you to not realize is you're here at as God's purpose then if you're God's purpose he can't destroy you amen nothing can harm you to that purpose God has put you here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have no matter how much heartaches or Sorrows you go through all these are for reason there's a reason for it we take for instance no in the Bible the flood come the Earth was destroyed the vegetation everything but Noah and the SE was taken into the ark why because the purpose of God will never be defeated come on somebody I'm trying to drive it into your heart you're God's purpose so if you're God's purpose you cannot be defeated this is why the devil don't want you to see who you really are he wants to make you think you're some little trotten down forgot about person but God came this morning to tell you know that's not who you are you're my son you're my daughter you're my child and I have placed you here and nothing shall defeat you hallelujah it's a rest you can take the revelation of God's word living inside of me then you can say no sickness no sorrow no death no Peril nothing to separate me from the will of God cuz I've been put here for a purpose there's no power there's nothing can separate me from God's Immortal plan so then we'll find that in the days of all the worlds being destroyed God made a preparation he made a preparation for what cause to preserve his purpose he had an ark why to preserve his purpose he's got a Rapture why to preserve his purpose come on somebody amen he did it in the days of and he's doing it today he's making a preparation to conserve his purpose he will conserve a church he will conserve a people he will conserve subject for his great domain and death will not destroy them we realize that by faith we believe this by res the resurrection produce a solid foundation on which our faith rests nothing can destroy as a poet once wrote Oh What A foraste of Glory Divine air of salvation purchased of God born of his Spirit washed in his blood Blessed Assurance upon this Solid Rock the resurrection of our Lord Jesus nothing can destroy it it has been planted it is a seed of God it is a purpose that will be fulfilled you are the planning of the Lord and you're going to bring forth fruit in it's duee season he's going to send the rains he's going to send the sunshine he's going to send whatever you have need of cuz he going to make sure his purpose is fulfilled he said we we have God's Eternal promise he said there may be teachers there may be isms there may be programs rise there may be some things sometimes it looks like it's going to be destroyed but it can never be destroyed look at your neighbor and say I can't be destroyed now look at that devil and say you ain't going to destroy me cuz I'm God's purpose God will never let his Heritage be destroyed oh my it's his purpose to give it to us we think today upon destructions trying to destroy we have Christ's own promise we think of the Hebrew children amen they were determined Satan was determined to destroy the purpose of God because he knew those children was going to go into the furnace and so they heated it seven times hotter is that not a type of us today seven times hotter the worst age has ever been to live in he's heated it up he's brought all the problems he brought all the situation he's Unleashed all the sicknesses Millions times millions of demons have been released into this age that we living in he's brought it all here he's he it up but he failed to put one thing in his equation the fourth man he put the wood he put the fire he added it and added it and added it seven times harder but he failed to realize that when you step into the [Applause] fair Hallelujah and something was given on the inside of these Hebrew children I have a purpose do what you want to okay but as for me I'm not going to Bow amen if I can just ignite that in your heart this morning do what you want to devil but I'm not bowing I'm not bending my knee to your pressure I'm not bending my need of what you have I'm not bending to your dress I'm not bending to your pornography I'm not giving myself to that I have a greater purpose [Applause] it may look impossible but our God is greater amen Daniel purposed in his heart he wouldn't defile himself with the king's meat do we have any Daniels in the building amen so we have a purpose Daniel knowing how God was going to do it or not knowing how he was going to do it rather but knowing god was able to knowing something down and told him God has a purpose in this and it's going to be fulfilled a lion could not eat the prophet because God had a purpose there Satan is going around as a roaring lion but he can't eat you cuz you have a purpose there amen he can't get to you brother R said like this he said I was sitting in a barber chair one time and get a haircut young Fell's cutting my hair down at brother eggin shop and I was just sitting there my head down I was so tired meetings have been so long and I trying to get away in the morning for a little rest before the next ones would start and I was so tired it seemed like my heart would just quit beating after a while sitting there all of a sudden I could hear everyone talking but it seemed like I was out in space somewhere I thought have a had a heart attack am I just going to die leave right here in this Barber chair I thought wonder if that's what's taking place I felt my hands they were numb my heart seemed like it quit beating I thought oh but there is a gospel that's got to be preached there's no power that can take me until God's purpose is fulfilled there's nothing that can hurt me not one thing until God's purpose fulfilled and when that isn't fulfilled I want to go on with his purpose when he's finished I'm finished when he's finished with me I'm finished with life when you're when he's finished with you you're finished also so what difference does it make god holds it all in his hand whether you're young or whether you're old you brother Timothy I'm a young person I got a long life no there's been a lot of young people's life snuffed out just like that cuz God's purpose for them was finished hello somebody this world is not our purpose I'm just going to say it getting Ed real education is not your true purpose sure it might be needed for what you need but don't get the wrong idea that that's my purpose because when it becomes your purpose it becomes your God and you put it over the things of God and the next thing you know you put your job over God and you put your life livelihood over God and you put everything above the purpose of God Amen anyhow God has a purpose Jesus said it becometh me to fulfill all righteousness in other words it's right is what I should do to fulfill brother BR said what is righteousness he said it is the word of of God I've come to fulfill the word of God this is what he said search the scriptures you think you have eternal life search them you believe in God believe also in me if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do the works I am my father are one when you see me you have seen the father see when you see the word made manifest you see father God because the word is the Father the word is God the word made manifest is God himself taking his own word and manifested among the Believers nothing can make it live but Believers amen nothing can make it live but Believers remember if God has a work for you to do let me tell you I'm just I'll just put it straight every one of you has a work to do listen this work is not just dependent on a few preachers this work is not dependent on just a few musicians and a good song leader a worship leader somewhere it's depending on all of us amen we have to have the whole body from the least to the greatest whoever it is and however you want to do it we got to have everyone so every one of you is important the devil's trying to make you not realize you're not important he's the one that's trying to put his thumb over you and Say You're Just a Nobody he's trying to put his n thumb over you and put complexes in your life to where you can't operate in the fullness of God he's trying to put things upon you to say see you never that's not you you can't be that amen why you want to keep Liv listening to the devil why you want to keep listening to somebody who lies 100% of the time amen you let me lie to you one time and see if you want to listen to me no more but you'll take a devil and listen to him over and over and over and over and he's lying to you every time he say you can't make it why cuz you are making it he's saying you can't overcome why cuz you are [Applause] overcoming he's lying to you hey you let a church do something you know I I'm I ain't going back that church but you'll keep going back to what the devil says 100 times somebody sent me this and I'm just going to throw it out here cuz it's pretty good you'll go to McDonald's and they get you order wrong what you going to do the next day go back no and they're probably going to get it wrong again I told her I want a chicken nuggets honey mustard sauce I told him barbecue and you drive right back up there give me my chicken nuggets with barbecue and they give you honey mustard I told them barbecue bunch of retards ah yeah I know stupid idiots yeah I know but you go right back but let something happen to the church I ain't never going back to that church no more you hear what that preacher called me I ain't going back well you wouldn't go back to Jesus's church either cuz he might call you a dog get back on my [Applause] notes amen when you see the word made manifest you see the father being made manifest remember if God has the work for you to do all the Demons of Torment can't take you they can't startle you oh this is direct quote handwriting on the wall Demons of out of Torment can't take you they can't startle you why cuz God's got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and all the devils in Hell won't be able to take it away God has a purpose for it it'll never be destroyed until God lets it fulfill the purpose he has ordained Ed to do and it will and it will they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover and it will they shall cast out demons in my name and it will they'll believe he's the same yesterday to day and forever and it [Applause] will Hallelujah anyhow I said Hallelujah anyhow Jesus Christ another quote no matter if he was in the Storm and The gales was knock the waves were knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of a pile of demons it never moved him amen he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be he was simply unconscious of the fear or anything around him oh my wouldn't that be wonderful I believe there is a people that can be just like that I'm going get a little ahead of myself but I feel to bring that in right now the prophet of God said he was the perfect antitype well what is an antitype an antitype is something serving as a model for what comes later oh watch out now amen an antitype is something serving as a model for what comes later amen what are you modeling your life after what are you put what are you pattering yourself after are you pattering after Hollywood are you pattering after leot DEA or are you following the true antitype that when you face a demon I got a purpose and devil you ain't going to stop it till I fulfill it amen it puts a faith inside of here amen where the doctor says the doctor can say what he wants to I have a purpose amen so he walked unconscious to fear amen what was it whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew he knew it was going to happened because God said so he didn't say oh have I prayed through have I pray have I fasted long enough wonder if I did this wonder if I did that he just walked right on amen that's right he believed what God Said was the truth the word must be fulfilled and he know what his life was here for it was to fulfill the word and you are here to fulfill it too you check check check is this mic working or not you are here to fulfill it too you are here to fulfill it too so you walk unconscious to fear I'm no longer a slave to fear why do you not a slave to fear cuz I'm a Child of God I have found the ESS God has put me here so Satan can come with his fear he can come with his torment he can come with all the things he wants to come with I am a child of God hallu so if something he said what so he said walk unconscious to the world walk unconscious of criticism that's one of the hardest things to do I know I I get criticized a lot you have to walk unconscious to it because you know if you ain't unconscious to it you hear it and then you want to respond to it but somebody's going to be a David that don't throw the javelin back Saul wants to throw a javelin at you because of your worship because of whatever amen be a David don't throw it back just keep on worshiping God I'm only doing what God called me to do if God called you to be a sauce so be it but God called me to be a David amen so I'm just going to walk unconscious to that and move right on some of you need to move I'm not talking about moving States I'm not talking about moving chairs I'm talking about moving from that condition you have sat beside and set it over and over and over it's time to move it's it's time to rise up and say devil that's not who I am I am a Son of God I am a child of God he has called me for a purpose Hallelujah walk with God the the doctor says you're going to die walk with God hallelujah walk anyhow you know we got news with my wife that she has a she had she had some nodules or the tumors really what they are but they call them nodules at first and on her lungs two on her right one on her left we knew about the left one for about seven years now they've been watching it now they're saying she has a nodu or tumor in her brain we've been walking with God she got a CT scan the other day they said got good news the left one on the left side has went down halfway there ain't none on the right side they're gone why cuz you just walk with God Amen God's in control of this anyhow amen the doctors they can do what they can but it's God who is the Healer it's God who's the deliverer it's God who's the savior so walk with God for God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you well brother Timothy I feel all along God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you you are not alone somebody needs to catch that you are not alone amen for he promised I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world he took the oath and by the Covenant to give you he'll confirm it just walk with God you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you got to go through some Brier patches you got to go over some sharp rocks and off some Bluffs somewhere down over some hillsides up through some mountains over some Waters but just keep walking with God brother BR I tell you I just deal take take take just a little bit off the path just for a moment maybe but he said I always thought the church wasn't a halfhazard what the what do he mean lacking order or purpose not planned Jesus never came to the Earth in a halfhazard way he never died in a halfhazard way he came for a purpose and that purpose was to fulfill the word of God that he might purchase himself a church without spot or without wrinkle so if he is the perfect antitype amen a model of something to come then we shouldn't be halfhazard either we shouldn't be halfhazard about our church and about our Bible and about the message and and about our life it ought to have a purpose to it it ought to be order to it it ought to be plans he said you can be halfhazard about a lot of stuff but when it comes to your Eternal destination you better be sure well I'm just is going to go up that camp and see what it's all about you're hap Hazard got a name for you hap Hazard well I'm just going to go there and just see if I can just you know visit a few people and you know I don't really care about the services I don't really care about anything I just want to show up and just kind of see if there's anything really you halfhazard in other words you're something that happens to be a hazard that's mine I I throwed that in there that's not in a dictionary he said keep he said that you better be very sure of your Eternal destination that's why he said make your calling and election sure let's not be halfhazard about that you can be halfhazard about how you dress in the sense of I I just wear these old jeans and I wear the but don't be Hast pleasure when it comes what what this is about right here is about eternal life it's not about just a better life it's about eternal life it's not about better finances it's about eternal life it's not about who I'm going to marry or listen listen it's not about that it's about eternal life you can be halfhazard about a lot of things but Eternal destination be very very sure don't take no chance with that amen he said if you went to a restaurant and ordered a bowl of soup and in that soup was a big old spider oh Lord I can hear you talking about cries last night you talking about some cries you know Sister Katie in end up in my sermon sometimes this girl probably fight a giant but if you let something about that long with a tail come across she'd love to tear up the whole thing around her bless her heart screams screams and screams and more screams and I keep telling her Katie you're bigger than that love you Katie bless your heart we was in Paris now this this really ain't no joke cuz it ain't no little bitty mice we was in Paris with our family here back the end of last year and we went up into the Eiffel Tower all the way to Top Got it's closing it so we took the thing down elevator down and me and sister Ruth and the sister that was guiding us around Paris and the the kids said well we want to stop at this halfway and go to the gift shop I was like all right I see at the bottom so we get down the bottom we're sitting there and the place is empty and all all a sudden I hear I look over there that's rat that dude's about that long and he here comes another rat and I count about five 10 rats just in a few moment I said oh Lord Katie going to have a fit and so we hear some voices coming down and I look up and all the kids are just running down the stairs you know having a good time and they got energy to burn so they doing it I like yeah do it I'm sitting on my bch all of a sudden I hear we had to pray her all the way home to the Airbnb it was no joke it was real to her but if she could ever get the realization who she really is that what she is is greater than what that is and that that is actually afraid of her more afraid of her than she's afraid of it I want you to know the biggest rat I know of is the devil and he's come scaring along some of your Trails it's time you quit going ah it's time you go [Applause] ah I've had enough of your lousy shelf I had enough of you devil today I'm taking your head off cuz I I have a purpose it's not jump back and scream it's scream and go forward if I can get you to realize that what he is is not greater than what you are for greater is that is in you than he that's in the world Hallelujah you don't have to jump back from depression cut his head off you don't have to jump back from every kind of spirit of fear cut his head [Applause] off you have been given a sword it's the word of almighty God and it'll defeat the Devil anywhere any time at any [Applause] condition he ain't nothing but a rat and you have been given power over that devil but you little a little spider getting your soup man push you back I ain't never coming back here he said hey the poison of that spider cooked in that soup it might kill you I get I get amazed at people with spiders some people have a you know I got to study on fear one time and there's a fear for everything it's crazy there's a fear of putting peanut butter on your sandwich can you believe that how dumb is that they actually got a name for it I was blown away when I got to studying fear and the long I can't even pronounce them phobias but uh uh my goodness maybe I'll bring them later it's incredible fears of all kinds the devil has come up with all kind to where you got to be somebody's got to be afraid to spread some peanut butter on their bread sounds silly to some of us to some people it ain't too silly it's real I mean I'm not not trying to make light of it there fears are real demons are real we're not trying to say they're not real they are real but what we're trying to tell you is you're greater than any fear you're greater than any Spirit of hell that wants to rise up and say you can't do it or say you ain't able or say you're unworthy or say all kinds of things about [Applause] you Mercy time is moving it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness in other words it must be fulfilled all the word of God that has been spoken must be fulfilled Jesus fulfilled his part Elijah fulfilled fulfilled his part John the Baptist fulfilled his part Paul fulfilled his part William Brandon fulfilled his part but it's not just up to them to fulfill and we look back and we say look how they fulfilled it they've done such a good job fulfilling it it's such a wonderful thing it's fulfilled but no God still has word in this day to be fulfilled and I want you to understand it's not just about scripture about a preacher to fulfill [Music] it amen because there's other antitypes in the Bible that were models of something future to come there was a Mary that was about 16 years old that got visited by an Angel and she looked at that and heard the word and said how can these things be and he began to expound to her how it was going to take place how that she was highly favored love that last night brother Andrew I she was F highly favored and he she said this is going to be well be it unto me where's a young 16y old girl today that hears the word of God and just says be it unto me where's a young boy amen that will stand in the face of the fire and say be it unto me build up the fire how you want to oh King but I'm not going to bow where's a young man that that that found out there's a Goliath that's making a challenge and and he's and he's made all listen David didn't go down into that into that Valley because he he fought well he wasn't a good fighter sure he killed a bear he killed a lion he he he he could use a sling amen but he wasn't a train fighter he didn't go down there cuz he fought well he went there because he [Applause] believed there was others that f well but they didn't believe give me a young man that believes that believes he's the same yesterday today forever that believes he's the same God that he was then he is now give me a young girl that [Applause] believes let's hear about our antitype he said I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me W that's a hard word right there as a teenager is will we got our own wheels I ain't talking about w e e l I'm talking about w i l l but some of you are so more concerned about your w e LS keeping them shiny and clean man look at them Wheels meanwhile the person that gets inside them shiny Wheels is so smudy and dirty why don't we worry about cleaning this up as much as we worry about cleaning that up come on somebody but we got our will w l but Jesus our antitop said not my will but thy will be done not what I desire but what you desire let me let me just drop this in here to young people because a lot of times you get all we get we get you know we get into our our teenage years and I know I I I was one at one time too many years ago and I became a rebellious teenager done a lot of things I wish I wouldn't have done slam doors in my mama's face that I wished I'd never slammed today I wish I could take back every door come on somebody oh we got real real right then said things I wish I could take back she forgave me we talked about them and all that but I still wish I'd have never set them but it was because I wanted my own will and I started looking at her and looking at my dad at somebody that was stopping me from what I wanted when I didn't realize they was protecting me from what I couldn't see they had already been down those roads they had already been through that listen your parents are not there to try to haunt you and hurt you they are put there by God for your protection so we have to lay our own will listen if you want anything from God you got to lay your whe down well I want I want the Holy Ghost but I want this and I want that I want that now forget about all that well brother Timothy I got a career forget your career it's temporary amen you make sure you find God first that is the most important thing not not a career people get it backwards they want a career well I want to be a nurse I want to be a doctor I want to be this I want to be that I got and it's so focused on a career and yes we need we need work we need to be able to provide understand all of that but if you'll find him he'll be with you when the career leaves you he'll be with you when there ain't no money in the bank he'll be with you when all your friends walk away he'll be with you when there ain't no hope and ain't no future and you don't know where to turn he still will be with you as a prophet of God said he said no matter what you do or how successful you are without Christ you totally lost everything he is the main thing well I want the Holy Ghost will lay down your stinking will your wants your desires your your what you think is your future lay it all down we want the Holy Ghost and what we want you ain't going to get both but I can tell you you get the Holy Ghost he'll give you what you need may not always get what you want but he will give you what you need amen this say the morning service so we just laying some stuff in here come on amen he was the antitype he was the high priest he said before the high priest could be anointed he had to be washed washed oh yeah I remember as a teenager I didn't like Washings do I have to yeah you stink we don't like that you know some of us just need somebody come your attitude stinks yeah well anyway you want to be anointed then get washed you want to be filled then get washed you can read about it in Exodus how they would take the high priest and and they would wash him we're to be washed by the watering of the word we need to let the water the word wash over us hello take out all of our man-made dams when I don't want the water flowing that way I want to protect something I got something I want to keep no we want him to go through every Avenue cuz we have been we have to have faith to fulfill all righteousness amen we are to fulfill all the word of God he said when the high priest was washed then he could be anointed he was anointed with the Holy Ghost for John bear record saying seeing the spirit of God descending like a dove and going upon him a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in how do you think the holy spirit is going to want to dwell with pornography dwell with sins and unbelief I understand you have thoughts that's not what I'm talking about amen thoughts go through your mind and it's not Amen brother said you want to know if you're thinking the devil's thoughts or God's thoughts he said if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thoughts he don't never put it back on on you he puts it back on the devil amen but when you allow those thoughts to stay there and you start building and building and building upon before you know you done committed it in your own mind you have to be washed before he was anointed he had to be washed so he could fulfill our what righteousness he had to be washed with water before the anointing he said what a beautiful type of today as priests unto God we must be first bapt baptized confessing our sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ washing away our sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the anointing amen wash first and then the anointed for service no Minister should enter the pool pit without being first baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because remission of sins is only in Jesus Christ's name not in another name under Heaven REM repentance and remission of sin must be taught in his name that's where the Holy Ghost fell at the beginning of Jerusalem that's where the Holy Ghost fell and anointed first so minister or any believer or any believer must be first washed from his sin in the name of Jesus Christ and then the anointing of the Holy Ghost will bring forth a testimony unto God Jesus said suffer John said me me baptize you you need to be baptized me he said no suffer it to be so cuz we must fulfill all righteousness we must fulfill this part of the word I have to be washed in other words John you're a mighty man you're Great Mighty prophet and your revelation of me is exactly the truth you know who I am you know because your ministry didn't come from man your ministry came from God you never learned it of a man you wouldn't taught this in a seminary but at the age of 9 years old you went into the Wilderness because you're born a odd and peculiar child and from your very birth God began to deal with you and even before your birth the prophet saw you and you are a light for this day you know who I am signs following me you already bore witness of you know it and you know who who each other are we know each other and then it's true that you need to be baptized of me but let it be suffered to be so John if we are lights of the day we must fulfill all righteousness as God's word must be fulfilled by us for this day it is becoming to us or behooving it's becoming it is like us we must fulfill the word amen for we are true witness if we're to be true Witnesses of God today John we are lights of this age we are lights of this age there's so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled in his AG then it's up to us hallelujah it's up to us to see all God's righteousness is fulfilled it's up to you young people it's not up to Mary no more it's not up to David no more it's not up to those back there no more it's up to you it's not up to Willam Brandon no more it's up to you you must fulfill all [Applause] righteousness in other words John you know who I I am I am the high priest it's true John I have need to be baptized of thee cuz we have to fulfill all righteousness I have need to be baptized of thee to fulfill the word of God because all the word has to be fulfilled he said not one jot or one TT that's like the smallest little you can put the smallest little thing won't be fulfilled every word's going to be fulfilled hello somebody Hallelujah every word must be fulfilled the light of every age will do the same hello how many is the light of this age amen we know what is to be fulfilled you who are spiritual and know the word of God you see what God has promised now the word will not come just easy you got to press your way into it we'll get to it later this week brother BR said just getting in his presence that's not all to it but you have to move deeper than that there's a lot of people that gets in his presence and dies right there in their seat come on somebody the rain falls on the just and the unjust but if there is a seed on the inside of you when you get in the presence of that rain that's something that's going to respond it's a law of God it's the word of God there's something on the inside that's going to come back he said see what it behooveth us it becometh us to fulfill all God's righteousness we must do it we must do it he said the Church of the Living God could only get in their heads this morning and their hearts that the church will not be separated by denominational barriers hello that differences in Creeds and colors and so forth that we might come together in the name of the Lord Jesus not having anything to bear away from the true word of the Living God and walk straight down the line of scripture to fulfill God's righteousness of today for anyone knows we're living in the evening lights Prophet said it shall be light in the evening time did you know he is prophesying about [Applause] you we know we're living in that hour the hour of the evening lights so the Lord God help us realize that let's go back for a little bit take up some of the characters and he goes through Noah and he said it behooveth him him or became cometh him to fulfill the desire of God and when it was revealed to him there was nothing going to stop it critics rose up what are you doing Noah are you crazy you lost your mind you've been out here for let's see 20 years now You' been nailing on this Ark listen I'm going to tell you I went and visited that Ark in Kentucky I don't know if they got it exactly right whatever but if they got it close I'm glad God didn't make me nowh God have mercy what a job but it came such a revelation to him that he knew if he didn't get these boards on in the place God told him to do if he didn't pitch it the way God told him to him and his family was going to be destroyed so it becometh him to fulfill what God has spoken and so by fulfilling it he started nailing on the ark he started preaching it's going to rain could you imagine going to brother Noah's Church on the 300 and whatever service of the Year moah opens his book and he says I got a message this morning it's going to rain 20 years later you come back it's going to rain and is he ever going to get something new to preach we get mad when a preacher does part three or part four can't he find something else no it did part 120 who years I ain't got time to do all that math just say he had one Sunday a month what is that how many weeks is that 52 times 20 120 it's going to rain no what are you going to do today why you doing that in because it becometh me to fulfill the word of God no you're crazy I don't care what you say no you lost your [Applause] mind but listen to these words right here amen it came one day that it switched from Noah hammering on the ark to them hammering on the ark let me in let me in he said I didn't shut the door God shut the door amen but it was becoming to me to fulfill all righteousness so critics may rise it becometh them to fulfill that too there has to be a Judas I know we always point back to the David and the Elijah and the jesuses and the Pauls and the William Brams but there's also judases there's also Pharisees there's also Sadducees there's also those that crucify him again they are fulfilling the word of God it is becoming of them I know I hate I hate to even say that but there's somebody that's going to take that part not me what you doing this morning hammering on an ark hammering on the word of God Amen it's a word that's going to get me out of here you can criticize it you can scandalize it you can call it whatever you want to amen but I'm telling you I have a word amen it's for my Escape it's for my deliverance and I'm not going to let it go it becometh me to fulfill all righteousness let the critics say what they want to let the denominational system do what they want to let them all do what they want to I could care less that's not my word but my word says there is a bride without spot without wrinkle and it's becoming to me there's a word that said they shall cast out devils in my name and that's becoming to me it's becoming unto me to put the devil under my feet it's becoming to me to rise up above depression rise up above sickness it's becoming to me to overcome as he also overcome you can keep your you can keep your feet oh brother he said we're just too late now we know what we have we who are born again of the Holy Spirit we see his works right among us just like it was in the Bible times come on now we're not talking about a Bible God just a Bible God we're talking about a Bible God who's a god of the Bible today if you believe in the same Holy Spirit then why isn't he doing the same thing in your church direct quote I'm sorry I'm not sorry whatever cuz he cannot change he's God no matter what the scientific proofs are they say you're just emotional is it okay if I quote the prophet okay well you're just mentally upset there's really nothing to this great religion of yours it just what it it's just what not what it should be so forth we're you're just a bunch of outcast don't believe it don't believe it if your daughter happens to come from the school and says M they prove the skull of a human just like that of the chimpanzee that's where we came from we're just merely animals don't you believe that no matter what anybody says what any Theologian says what any doctor says what any science says what Any teacher says we hold on to God's Eternal Word Noah in the midst of criticism it didn't bother him no matter how much they say there's no such a thing as a baptism of the Holy Spirit don't you believe it there's no such a thing as Divine Healing it behooveth me it becometh me to fulfill all righteousness no matter what the critic says no matter what anybody says I'm only looking to what he said let's stand at our feet this morning it's becoming [Music] you know somebody looks at you and they saying is they see in a nice

[Music] now and I know it's a morning service but there was a lot of things that were said here today that are so incredibly important because that purpose and understanding that purpose that God has for every one of us that we're not we're not wannabes we're not we're not hoping to [Music] be you're here because God put you here your design your nature your likes everything about you is so strategically and so incredibly down to the minute detail of Who You Are God built you but Satan comes in and he perverts that and he gets you confused and you have these these things of you're apologizing on the inside all the time and you're wishing you were somebody else all the time and you're wanting to somehow feel like you have purpose and that's why Christ had to come because I promise Adam and Eve didn't have those kinds of situations in their minds they didn't battle that of their hearts we battle it because you've got an eternal Soul you've got you you've got eternal life you've got a predestinated seed on the inside of a fallen body [Music] and sometimes it's easier just to run from our purpose that's where we've got to stop say Lord I want you to direct me I want your Holy Spirit to take control so that your life can live and manifest and be reflected through me I want to tell you the power of the holy spirit is here this morning and if you'll open up that heart right now and just raise that hand and say Lord I don't need a prayer line this morning I'm just wanting to surrender everything that I am to you I'm just a boy or a girl or I'm a teenager and I brother Timothy has struck my heart this morning the words that he's saying Lord some of you adults might need it too just Here I Am Lord I'm opening everything I am up to you if that predestinated seed I'm just asking for the logos that Living Word to just come down and ignite that word in me I Want To Be Your [Music] Vessel help me Lord God sees your tears God seen your tears God has seen your tears even before this service he seen your tears when you're at home and the devil's beating up on you telling you how filthy and how you'll never be listen I'm a human being too and I've been and fought in those same areas I was fought when I was a kid I'm fought as an adult Satan trying to keep God's purpose from my life but you heard the man of God this morning nothing will defeat the purpose of God so what are we doing we're surrendering ourselves to the purpose father in the name of Jesus I felt your presence in the back but I feel it lingering up here behind this pulpit and I'm just asking Lord that that great pill of fire would just come and let the presence of God just settle upon these young men and young women Satan you're a liar you filthy spirit that would [Music] try that would accuse would try to defeat the purpose of God in our [Music] lives you lead these young people alone in the name of Jesus we're rising up we've been given the mantle this message has raised
