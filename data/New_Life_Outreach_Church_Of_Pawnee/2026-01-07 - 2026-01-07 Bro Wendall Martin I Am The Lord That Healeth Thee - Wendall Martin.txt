Healing is here. Oh, he that is here. I receive it and I receive it. I lift my hands. Oh, I lift my hands. my you know my &gt;&gt; I trust in you. Oh glory glory healing is here. Oh yeah, healing is here. Thank you. Thank you. Heing is here and I receive it. Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad for that healing? is the children's bread. And I believe that I believe that as as brother Michael was ministering the other night, you know, they were at Kadesh Barnea and and they had to make their choice. They had to make their choice what what they were going to do. either take God's promise and and die to themselves and because that's what that river Jordan represents, death. Die to all the impossibilities. Go across that land and say, you know, they I I I'm going to possess my land. They didn't have the authority on on that side of the river, but they sure had the authority on this side of the river. And when you have a prophet that comes in and lays it out and says, "This belongs to you." It just makes us want to just gives us confidence and said, "I don't care how big the giant is. Might have to take off the toes first, go to the ankles next, but he's coming down. He's this is my land. This is my promise." And I believe that here tonight. And so I believe healing is here, Brother Borland. It sure is good to see you. Amen. Sight for sore eyes. Amen. And u uh so good to I I was I I was looking at through my text a little bit just before I came out and I I'd seen where I'd missed your text there, brother. Uh it's been a it's been a busy couple days. And so uh but we're sure we're sure glad to have brother Tom with us here tonight. Just good to good to have every Stacia. It's so good to have you and Alba Joe with us. That's an Indian baby. I mean that that baby is uh isn't she just adorable? And so and uh uh we're sure glad to see sister Stacia and and the baby and and so glad y'all are doing well. And um &gt;&gt; how many love Stac Patrick? We just love them. Amen. Well, let's look here in in the Bible. Uh we'll go to the book of Psalms 103. And um we sure uh appreciated the Psalms here tonight. and &gt;&gt; um brother Kobe sort of setting the um setting the stage for the for the the word tonight. I want to minister on healing. And um and so those songs were uh very appropriate. And um Amen. You've already the question's already been asked you, whose report do you believe? And you said, I believe the report of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so tonight, we want to um deal with with healing for a few moments here this evening. And uh but Psalms 103 and1, bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, and bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Aren't you glad that you've got benefits in the kingdom of God? Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases, who redeemth thy life from destruction, who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfies thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles. The Lord execututeth righteousness and judgment for all. Somebody say, for all &gt;&gt; that are oppressed. Amen. And let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we want to thank you today for your goodness, for your righteousness, for your unfailing love. Thank you, Lord, for always being in our futures, &gt;&gt; always being so good to us, Lord. Father, we we thank you. We thank you for eternal life. We thank you for this message that points us and makes eternal life so clear. Lord, we just ask that you would now be with us all and help us, Lord, as we really help us to examine how how close you are to every one of us in so many ways in our lives. Help us to trust you. We thank you for this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. God bless you. You can be seated. We there have been a lot of folks here in the church that man have are really going through some uh some hardships in their bodies and and um uh there's just a lot of you know a lot of things that um you know we get older and and Um um you know things uh our bodies start needing healing. Uh a lot of us are are still young or some of us are still young and shouldn't be battling things like brother Luke with those with those um uh you know kidney stones and and and I mean those things were big enough that the doctor says he's just not going to pass them by himself. And and so um so we're praying for brother Luke and uh they put the stints in, make sure the you know make get just get rid of the any infections and and going to have to come and and um laser those uh bad boys and and um so uh there's there's u some here tonight that's that's been given a um diagnosis of cancer. Uh we've got some We got one liosis of the liver. We've got um you know, you've we've got dad fighting uh that Parkinson's devil. We've got &gt;&gt; So, I mean, we we've got and we could go on. I want to say we thank God for for uh being with Brother Wall-E yesterday. It was a fivehour plus &gt;&gt; uh surgery and God brought him through &gt;&gt; and and we're thankful for that. Um but there's there's a lot of us uh there there's some that's b diabetic um and um you know so in in a in a little congregation like we have there are a lot of needs and I I just I just felt it on my heart as as we um we've got brother Donald who um you know has got that infection in his in his leg and he is uh um I mean It's we need healing. &gt;&gt; We we need healing. &gt;&gt; And and so I I you know I I know it's a Wednesday night, but I just want to I just want to preach a little bit uh on healing. you you you can you can go through and and and um you know you many many say well you know if you're sick then then that means that you know you're being punished or that you're you you've sinned but that's not true that's that I I I believe in some cases that is true for somebody that's backslid and God will God will God will send the hounds of hell after us to uh you know turn us around. I I I believe that. But I also believe that sons and daughters of God who are walking with God and and are under the blood token should be able to come to God without a fear and without any kind of doubt and say Lord I'm I I'm I'm here to accept something that you have given us. &gt;&gt; I think the first thing that we need to understand is this body is not redeemed yet. Your soul is redeemed, but your mind and your body is not redeemed. &gt;&gt; And so what I mean is is the prophet says, "Your body, Amen, Satan can still afflict." Amen. He can't touch that soul. It's seals away. But your body, Amen, is still and your mind is still under uh it can be it can be sick. And uh Amen. we have to believe God for for for healing. &gt;&gt; Others say, "Well, I just I I know God will heal this one, and I know God will heal that, but I just don't know. I just don't know if if he'll heal me." And and and I just say, "We humans, we we just we we just make things weird. We just make things weird. It's not God that makes things weird. We make things weird." &gt;&gt; God says, "I'm the God that health thee." &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? And and so there there's a lot of things there that'll you know you know we can ask and and because we're dealing with ourselves, we know ourselves. We know our our failures. We know our ups and downs. But but I just want to say here tonight, Amen. Those who are under the blood of Jesus are righteous before God. &gt;&gt; You're righteous because he has made you righteous. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and as we as we sing the song, Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. He invites his come his chosen people to come and dine. And I I I say I I I want to come and dine. Amen. If God's got something for me that I I I I want to sit at his table. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I don't want to just sit around and wish. I want to sit up at the table. Brother Brandham says, "If I went to your table and sat down and and you said, "Preacher, come eat with me. I believe you love me." Amen. I you you had beans and potatoes and carrots and fried chicken and pumpkin pie and ice cream and everything sitting there. Well, I believe I just I' I'd be just as welcome to the potatoes as to the beans. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The The only thing I believe Amen. I' I'd be just as welcome to the chicken a as as to the pie. It's all on the table. The only thing that I have to say is would you please pass me some pie? &gt;&gt; I I I believe with a good free heart if you if if you love me you would say certainly my brother have a nice big piece of it. Is that right? If I'd say would you pass me potatoes? Why certainly my brother? Here it is. Every redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ died for and purchased in his atonement at Calvary is sitting at the table tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every believer is sitting before it. Hallelujah. He said, if I need healing, I say, "Father, pass me some healing." And I pour it out on the plate and eat a big a thing of it. Can you say amen? Amen. That's right. I How many believes that healing is the children's bread? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Of course, any Christian believes that that there would be a resurrection. But if there's no attributes of the resurrection, if there's no earnest of the resurrection, then there is no resurrection. And if there's no divine healing, there is no resurrection." Amen. You couldn't disprove that if if uh if you could by the scripture. I'm arguing the points of Christ. See, because we have the earnest of our salvation, which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Is that right? That's the down payment, the earnest which holds it secure in heaven for us. Then if there is no divine healing to make a cancerridden body come normal and well again, there is no resurrection of the dead. That's right. We have no earnest of it at all. THERE'S NO PLAN MADE FOR it at all. Amen. So that WOULD THAT JUST SADDLES IT. SO BROTHER RANDOM is saying, "Amen, get in your mind. If we're believing in a in in in an eternal a a resurrection and and and a heaven, then you'd better believe that healing is yours." And if you CAN'T BELIEVE IN HEALING, THEN DON'T EVEN EXPECT AMEN. You It's It's all a fairy tale to you. Amen. That's what he's saying. Amen. If we don't have healing, he says, then we have no earnest at all. There's no plan for it. So, that settles it. But I say tonight, there's somebody that says there is healing for me. AMEN. BUT THERE MUST BE A faith to appropriate to it. And I'm just going to talk to you from my heart here tonight. There's got to be faith THAT APPROPRIATES THAT HEALING. GOD can do no more for you than what he's already done at Calvary. How many believes that here tonight? Amen. The promises of God are are sure. AMEN. THE PROMISES of God are are real and they're and they have been given to every one of us. Amen. That there the Bible says that the that that that the words are life to them that find it and it's health to all their flesh. There in Exodus 23 and 25. Ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread and thy water, and I will take away from a sickness away from the midst of thee. Hallelujah. Now, you can't go into this thing presuming. Presuming is to Amen. IS TO SUPPOSE SOMETHING IS THE case based on probability. Amen. So, I presume, Amen. that that that healing could BE FOR ME BECAUSE THE PREACHER HAS PREACHED AND I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE HEALED. YOU SEE THAT'S PRESUMING BUT A HEART OF FAITH IS NOT LOOKING FOR A HOPE. SO a heart OF FAITH SAYS GOD DIED FOR ME. &gt;&gt; JESUS PAID THE PRICE FOR ME. HIS STRIPES WERE PUT ON HIM for me. Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Brother brother Bradom says Moses never went down into Egypt presuming that God was with him. He went DOWN TO EGYPT KNOWING GOD WAS WITH HIM. YOU DON'T ACCEPT YOUR HEALING thinking God will heal you or do it. You accept your healing because GOD HAS ALREADY SOMEBODY SAY ALREADY DONE IT. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT THINKING HE'S GOING TO DO IT. It's in the past tense. Healing has been paid for. HEALING IS SETTING AT THE TABLE. YOU JUST GOT TO GET YOUR NAPKIN, YOUR FORK, AND YOUR SPOON AND SAY, "PASS IT OVER TO ME. I'M READY TO EAT." &gt;&gt; OH, can you say amen? IT AIN'T WHETHER YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH. IT AIN'T WHETHER IT DON'T MATTER YOUR FAMILY STATUS. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU ARE IN THE COMMUNITY. IT'S WHAT YOU ARE IN HEAVEN. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, EVERY ONE OF YOU HAVE A blood atonement. &gt;&gt; Amen. Healing has been paid for for you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. It's already DONE IT. HE'S PROMISED IT AND YOUR FAITH SAYS IT'S SO AND NOTHING ELSE CAN WIPE it out. And I say amen to it. &gt;&gt; James 1 and6. But let him ask in faith nothing wavering. For he that waverth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. FOR LET NOT THAT man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. For a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. AMEN. SO, SO I WELL, I you better watch out. You're fixing to fall. Amen. No, no, no, no, none of this guessing, none of this wishy-washy. Either God's word is right or it's wrong. &gt;&gt; EITHER JESUS PAID FOR YOUR SINS or he didn't. And either his his stripes was laid stripes were laid on his back for your healing or it wasn't. Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to keep laying scripture in here for a while. How many how many believe that's all right? Amen. Hebrews 11 and6. Without faith, it is impossible to please him. For he THAT COMES TO GOD MUST BE DOUBLEMINDED. MUST THINK THAT MAYBE ONE OF THESE days God's going to heal me. &gt;&gt; NO. HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST BELIEVE THAT he is &gt;&gt; and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him. Can you say amen? I I I believe that we're living in the day of the returning to the inheritance. We're not in Egypt. We're not in the wilderness of denominationalism. We have been given a word of promise. Satan has said we can't have it. Satan took it away from Adam and from Eve. AND ALL OF THE ADAM'S RACE IS JUST STRUGGLE. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, WE ARE GOING TO A LAND and divine HEALING HAS COME TO US TO LET US KNOW. You know what? You know what divine healing is? It's the grapes of the other land. &gt;&gt; It's the grapes. It's the pomegranates. It's the proof. Amen. It's the proof that the other land exists. IT'S IT'S IT'S GOD SAYING, "OH, here I'm going to give you I'm going to let you eat a juicy grape." So, just so that you know, Amen. what it's going to be like on the other side. &gt;&gt; Well, there ain't going TO BE NO SICKNESS ON THE OTHER SIDE. There ain't GOING TO BE NO DISCOURAGEMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE. THERE AIN'T GOING TO BE NO BACKSLIDING ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO, WE MIGHT AS WELL just start believing it right now. Hallelujah. Well, glory to God. Amen. Now, if there's ever a day that we need to believe healing for our minds, we need healing in our minds. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, this this this generation is is struggles in our minds. &gt;&gt; It's an onslaught of hell. The the the lid of hell has come off. Amen. Hell is everywhere. And it's not just touching those people outside there. It'll affect you right here. YOU BIBLEBELIEVING GODLY PEOPLE, SATAN WILL AFFLICT YOUR MIND. HE'LL AFFLICT YOUR BODY &gt;&gt; and he'll make you think that YOU'RE THE MOST WORTHLESS THING THAT EVER THAT EVER COME ON PLANET EARTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ANYMORE, I just agree WITH HIM. YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT I'VE GOT A LAMB who has given me his righteousness. &gt;&gt; I don't even argue with him anymore. Why can't you say amen? That's right. AMEN. SATAN IS THERE A A PLAGUE IN OUR MINDS. DEMON INFILTRATION OF OUR minds and of our heart. But I'm I I I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS IS WHAT THE scripture says there in 1 Thessalonians 5:23. And the very God of peace sanctify you holy AND I PRAY GOD your whole spirit. Somebody say spirit &gt;&gt; AND SOUL &gt;&gt; and well are y'all going to help me on this. I PRAY GOD your whole spirit. YOUR WHOLE SOUL AND YOUR BODY BE PRESERVED blameless &gt;&gt; until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth thee of all thine iniquities, and healeth thee OF ALL. SOMEBODY SAY ALL. ALL THY DISEASES. WELL, I'M GETTING TOO OLD. It don't matter HOW OLD YOU ARE. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION. THERE IS NO CLAUSE UP TO 60 years old OR UP TO 40 years old. The Lord has delivered YOU FROM ALL YOUR INIQUITIES AND HE'S HEALED YOU OF ALL THY DISEASES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Can you say amen, man? &gt;&gt; Does he forgive? DOES HE STILL FORGIVE INIQUITIES? &gt;&gt; Then he still heals all our diseases. &gt;&gt; What about the Amen. Does the Lord still heal? Amen. Oh yes. I mean he he look look at what God done even in the New Testament. Amen. We we see the angel coming down on the pool of Bethesda would stir that water at a certain season. Hallelujah. And what was it all to do? To provide healing. The angel would come down to the pool and trouble the waters. And whoever would go into that, Amen. pool, the first to go in would be healed. Amen. Israel in the wilderness. Amen. When sickness would come because of their sin, GOD WOULD SAY, "I am the God that heal thee." &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? AMEN. WHAT CAUSED SICKNESS in the FIRST PLACE? WHAT CAUSED DEATH? WHAT CAUSED DEATH? AMEN. Sin cause death. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and and THERE IF IF THERE IF THERE WAS NO SIN, THERE WOULD BE NO SICKNESS. THERE WOULD BE NO DISEASE and there would BE NO DEATH. &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE SIN CAME, AMEN. death reigns in our bodies and that brings sickness and and and and hardships. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 5:12. Wherefore, as by one man sin uh uh by one man sin enterth into the world, AND DEATH BY SIN, AND SO DEATH IS passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. &gt;&gt; We've all sinned. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; WE ALL GET SICK. &gt;&gt; WE ALL FIGHT MIND BATTLES. &gt;&gt; WE ALL DO these things. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? Rich, POOR, &gt;&gt; nobles and peasants. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. WE WE WE ALL FIGHT IT. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? But I but I I I I just want to tell you, Amen. Hallelujah. I'm so glad that there's a remedy. &gt;&gt; DISEASE IS IS THE PHYSICAL penalty of iniquity. The day you eat of the fruit, you shall surely die. That's spiritually and physically. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, so, so where or or who DOES DOES SICKNESS COME FROM? Does it come from God? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Does sickness come FROM GOD? &gt;&gt; NO. SICKNESS DON'T COME FROM GOD. THE BIBLE SAYS uh uh there in in in Acts 10, I I believe it's Acts 10 and 36. Amen. and how 30 36 and 38 how that God anointed Jesus, amen, of Nazareth and UH HOW GOD ANOINTED JESUS OF NAZARETH WITH THE Holy Ghost and with POWER WHO WENT ABOUT doing good and healing &gt;&gt; ALL THAT WERE OPPRESSED OF THE DEVIL. For God was with him. &gt;&gt; So you ain't got fighting himself. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOD FIGHTING HIMSELF. IT'S GOD FIGHTING THE ENEMY. GOD BROUGHT JESUS CHRIST TO HEAL YOU BODY, SOUL, AND SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; WELL, I hope you're getting that in your mind right now. Get it anchored. Get it lodged. Get it right now in your mind because I believe God could do a miracle in your body right now hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Hallelujah. Amen. All that were oppressed of the devil. So sickness is the consequence of sin. If there had been no sin, there would be no sickness. SO IF YOU DEAL WITH THE SIN QUESTION, THEN YOU HAVE THE FAITH TO come and ask for healing. &gt;&gt; IF YOUR SOUL IS REDEEMED, THEN WHY CAN'T I believe God? Amen. To touch my body. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I remember uh uh uh you know, Sister Stephanie coming in and and there she was a a druggie, been a druggie, you know, a long time. We all know the story that you know, she I mean, she she done drugs since she was uh in her pre-teens and and uh uh you know, and and and and her mom died at an early age, you know, just just you know, just uh drug related and things of that nature. And here we we seen Stephanie, you know, close to 40 years old. Amen. and her teeth were all all rotten and she was just as skinny as could be and Amen. and and and and you know called herself an atheist and and you know she didn't know anything about anything you know. Amen. But but when God touched Sister Stephanie Hallelujah. Now this she just started believing. Hallelujah. you know, she'd come over where I was working and I' I'd tell I', you know, I'd go get in the car with her and Fresca and talk about Daniel and oh, she just loved it hearing about Daniel in the lion's den or about Abraham and I would tell her about Abraham and how we we are the royal seed of Abraham. Just give her little stories AND SHE JUST WOW WOW wow and uh Amen. But but see when she came, she came with a bad liver and and so things started getting uh really getting bad. And of course they they were living on the streets when they had came. They didn't have anything but just the the clothes on their back. And so uh uh YOU KNOW SHE SHE DIDN'T SHE DIDN'T HAVE no she she really didn't have any righteousness to come and bring before God. Stephanie had nothing. Right? Y'all remember when Sister Stephanie was saved? Well, here here she comes. Amen. And so she told me that they were going to, you know, going to the doctor and and uh well, the doctor wasn't too proud, you know, just, you know, she told the doctor she's she's she's doing good now and she's giving her heart to the Lord. And the doctor's going, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I've seen your kind before. You're a druggie. You've done this to your body." And amen. Cuz cuz they were hoping to get put on for for, you know, uh the uh the the the transplant. And uh you know uh uh the doctor just she said I'm not going for it. You're you know you're just it it you know there's going to be other people who genuinely need livers and and you're just going to go back out there and keep on playing around and and she tried to tell her, you know, I'm I'm really I'm a Christian now. I'm not I don't do that stuff anymore. Heroin is is behind me. And and and she she done heroin for uh for for many years, 30 years. AND AND SO HERE BUT BUT she believed the Lord &gt;&gt; and and so she goes, y'all remember the story how she goes back to the doctor. Amen. And you know the doctor had given her some medication and telling her what she needs to eat and so this that and the other. She goes back in has has the next test run and and the doctor comes back in and says there is nothing wrong with your liver. Your liver &gt;&gt; there's no cerosis. There's nothing there. Well, well, now look at that. She She had She had nothing. SHE HAD NOTHING GOING FOR HER. &gt;&gt; She couldn't come in and say, "But Lord, I've saved this many people and I've come to church for this many years, and I She'd only She'd only been in church for a few months. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God." You see, IF WE WOULD JUST COME AND just believe God, &gt;&gt; JUST BELIEVE GOD, THAT'S ALL GOD WANTS. HE JUST WANTS FAITH IN HIS WORD. FAITH IN HIS WORD. STEPHANIE'S NOW NOW BEEN SERVING THE LORD FOR 10 YEARS AND SHE'S JUST AS HEALTHY AND AMEN. AND AND AND AND AND GOD DONE A GREAT WORK IN HER LIFE, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. How we LOVE SISTER STEPHANIE AND BROTHER JOE. GOD. BUT YOU SEE, IT WAS SOMEBODY THAT KNEW THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO EARN IT. THEY JUST SIMPLY BELIEVE THE PLAN OF SALVATION. JESUS DIED FOR DRUGGIES AND DRUGGIES THAT JESUS DIED FOR HAD A RIGHT TO BELIEVE FOR HEALING. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. You see, we sit around and we we think, well, but I had that thought yesterday and I had I said I misspoke two days ago and I I just don't know. Why don't we get rid of that mental attitude and just say, God, I am forever yours. You have sanctified me forever through the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. I CAN STAND HERE AND BELIEVE YOU. I AM GOING ACROSS THAT JORDAN RIVER AND I'M GOING TO POSSESS MY MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at the blood for a moment. Amen. The blood, the covenant of the blood. Atonement means to cover over. Atonement means to make reconciliation. It means to atone for by legal rights. It means to pacify or satisfy the judge. Are y'all hearing me? So only the blood could satisfy the courts of heaven. God was the first to slay a lamb IN THE GARDEN. GOD WAS THE FIRST TO SLAY A LAMB. WELL, glory to God. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HIS CHILDREN MADE A FLUB of themselves and they couldn't redeem themselves. And God, &gt;&gt; ADAM DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR A LAMB. GOD GAVE A LAMB. IT WAS GOD'S HEART ASKING OR WANTING TO GIVE REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam was guilty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he knew it. And he just had his head hung in shame. And he had Amen. He was walking out of the garden. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; And God was God's heart was breaking. &gt;&gt; Says, "Adam, wait. Wait, wait. It was God running after Adam. Adam was doing the hiding. God was doing the searching. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Glory. When it's it's when WHEN WHEN YOU'RE OVER THERE IN YOUR LITTLE PITY PARTY AND SAY, "I WISH I DIDN'T AND I WISH I COULD AND I WISH AND I WISH." GOD IS LOOKING FOR YOU. SAY, "LISTEN, YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO ME." &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's good. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, God was the first to slay a lamb. Abel was the first human to offer blood back to God. Adam slew a lamb when he met God. Noah offered a lamb up to God after the flood. The Passover night in Egypt required blood. Aaron the HIGH PRIEST. AMEN. HAD TO HAVE BLOOD TO enter into the holiest. Well, can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, WHAT HAPPENS to your sin when the sin question is dealt with? &gt;&gt; I'm glad you asked that. Hallelujah. What happened to my sin? It's placed in the sea. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my goodness. It it Well, glory to God. Amen. You can take You can take now, you know, they don't make things as powerful as they used to. Amen. But but uh uh you know these these chemicals and things but but you do the you know you get the bleach and and and and you could drop a little drop of of ink into that bleach and then you you you can just watch it going every which direction. What what is it? Amen. The chemical in the bleach is more powerful than the stain in the ink. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now now these days bleach is a lot like religion. It only just muddles it up. But Amen. Back in back back when they used to clean stuff when my mama used to clean it, you'd be able to you couldn't walk into that bathroom for two weeks after she cleaned it. Hallelujah. It stunk so bad. Amen. Well, that's the way that's the way the blood of Jesus CHRIST NOW THE BLOOD. AMEN. NOW, now now the church has muddled it all up. It's muddled it all up. Amen. and and and so you drop your little sin and that that little um church forgiveness and all of that and you look and all you can see is just a bunch of black liquid everywhere. Hallelujah. But the BLOOD OF JESUS IS LIKE THE OLD BLEACH. HALLELUJAH. THAT OLD STUFF, YOU COULD DROP THAT INK IN THERE. HALLELUJAH. AND IT THAT INK HAS LOST ITS POWER FOREVER. IT IT IT REMOVES THE POWER OF STAIN. IT REMOVES EVERYTHING. AMEN. TAKES IT BACK TO WELL, are y'all hearing me? &gt;&gt; And you get the your the blood. Amen. You get your sins, I don't care. The Bible says, "Though your sins be a scarlet," Amen. Though you have BEEN DIRTY WRONG, HALLELUJAH. IT SHALL BE WHITE LIKE SNOW. GOD CAN TAKE AWAY YOUR SIN ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHERE YOU FIRST COMMITTED YOUR FIRST SIN. AMEN. THAT AGE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SOMETIMES WE GO ALL THE WAY BACK AND WE CAN REMEMBER WHERE WE FIRST DONE IT. WE CAN REMEMBER WHERE IT SCARRED OUR HEART. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, JESUS BLOOD CAN TAKE AWAY ALL THOSE SCARS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If there's no sin held against you, you say, "But there is sin in my life. There is mistakes." Then you, you know, then you need to really check yourself because if you don't believe you're saved and you don't believe that Jesus blood has enough power, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to save you, you you you better check your soul. Make sure you've got your ticket ready to go. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm here to tell you, the blood of Jesus has enough power to forgive your past sins, your present sins, and your future sins. &gt;&gt; And if he does not hold sin against you, then what is there to keep you from being healed? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, so who can who can remove that curse? The doctor can assist nature. Amen. But only God can heal. &gt;&gt; The doctor can set the bones, but only God can heal the arm. &gt;&gt; They can remove the cancer, but only God can bring the healing. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All of your vitamins and minerals and um all of your oils can can Hallelujah. They can they're okay in assisting nature. Hallelujah. But I'm here to tell you, your vitamins and your minerals and your oils cannot bring healing. It requires God. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. You can eat your veggies every day of your life. Hallelujah. and you're still going to be end up diseased. &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad that there is a God who heals our diseases. &gt;&gt; So I'm saying here tonight, there's only one cure, one cure. And and and I want us to as as as Israel was a type, amen, of the believer, it required the blood. And they had to take the blood, put it on the post, and they had to eat the lamb. It was the very first communion service there in Exodus 12. Amen. Where the blood was to be applied. And the death angel that was going to strike, God says, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you." Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that that that he is Amen. He says, "And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plagues shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt." Well, can you say amen? Now, the last I remembered there in Revelations, I believe in the ninth chapter when the bottom when when the when when the angel of the bottomless pit comes in, opens it up and he's man and all the plagues are coming upon the earth. They're coming upon the fearful and the unbelieving. &gt;&gt; They're not coming upon the elect. It affects us all. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But the mighty angel has come with healing in his wings. So, we're living in this earth that's been cursed. And because of the cursing of this earth that we're living in, we're we're we're we're, you know, we're breathing the smog and whatever. And we're we're having to we're eating all of the junk. We're doing I mean I Hey, it affects us all. It does. But I am the Lord. Somebody say, "I am the Lord that health thee." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, there were provisions for two million people. Hallelujah. In the wilderness. Now I want you to think about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. There there. And the Bible says that after that Passover, there was not one feeble person. &gt;&gt; Two million people and not one feeble person. &gt;&gt; See, brother Widow, that was way back then. They that man, that was that was that was way Listen, they were a type, brother. &gt;&gt; That was a type of God's elect. Today, &gt;&gt; they were going to a natural land. YOU'RE GOING TO YOUR POSSESSIONS THAT ADAM LOST. &gt;&gt; And Adam would never Adam didn't have sickness. Adam didn't have death. Adam didn't have any of that until the fall. &gt;&gt; We're going back to our promise. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not one. The Bible says there in in Psalms 105 and 37, he brought them forth also with silver and gold. And there was not one feeble person among them &gt;&gt; among their tribes. Well, can you say amen? Hallelujah. Let's just look at something else. Some of the other supernatural things. Because it wasn't just their healing. It wasn't just their healing. The the Bible says their clothes didn't even get old. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. COULD YOU could you imagine? Could you imagine you girls? Amen. You you you girls sitting here growing up getting growing up and growing up and your shoes grow with you. You say now that that that can't h Well, let's just see what the Bible says about it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now Deuteronomy 29 and5. I have led you 40 years in the wilderness, and your clothes are not waxing old, and the shoe is not waxing old off thy foot. &gt;&gt; I I don't know. I don't know if they had weight problems like me or not. Amen. But I guess as as they grew, the the the clothes grew. Hallelujah. Amen. So God even God God even cared for the chubby folks. Amen. And he cared for you young folks. He cared for them. THE ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? IT WAS A supernatural thing. God, they were under ORDERS TO GO TO THAT LAND. AND GOD WAS GOING TO PROVIDE. WE ARE UNDER MANDATE FROM GOD TO MAKE A RAPTURE. AND GOD IS GOING TO KEEP EVERY ONE OF YOU. YES, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WE'VE GOT TO GET OLD AND DIE. THAT'S FINE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THIS PLACE DISEASED. &gt;&gt; When it's time FOR ME TO GO, THEN HALLELUJAH. How Amen. I praise the Lord. We I was going I've always said, "Let's just let it be a really a really tough car wreck." And Amen. I might I might adjust that prayer. Hallelujah. But uh I mean just no suffering. Just just LET ME GO. I DON'T CARE. OR OR OR OR YOU KNOW, just go to sleep, not wake up. I don't YOU YOU UNDERSTAND? I BELIEVE GOD CAN DO THAT. HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT? YEAH, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham would say, "Now, when you receive this bread, remember it represents the lamb. It was at it was at the uh Passover or communion. Long years ago when Israel's lamb was roasted over fire and was taken with bitter herbs, the people had strength and their shoes never wore out and their clothes uh never come threadbearing all through the journey till they hit the promised land. May God keep us healthy, happy, serving him until we reach the promised land that he has given us. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the way he seen it. &gt;&gt; That's the way he believed it. &gt;&gt; What can you say? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm fighting, Brother Wendle. I I'm in a battle. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I I understand. &gt;&gt; But the fight needs to be by faith. &gt;&gt; It's got to be the good fight of faith. Satan is there to get us so hinder our faith. &gt;&gt; Healing is for every one of God's people. &gt;&gt; When the water was bitter, God provided. Amen. Cut down a tree and put in the water and and and and God made it bitter. Praise the Lord. When they needed food, God provided mana and God provided quail. When they sinned and Amen. And and and and God provided healing for them. Well, that's right. Another place when they need God provided water out of a rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so I I I I I my my thoughts here tonight is God. Oh God, Lord, we need healing here. We our our our our little group needs healing. And and I I I want us to really I I want us to really really think about this and and and I want us to get a burden for for for one another because we are a we I so I we we are a body. We're a body. And um as as I as I've been looking at this a at you know the needs that that we have here and and and um you're well taught. I I believe our church is well taught. &gt;&gt; I you know I I I believe we know all of these things. I'm I'm I'm not preaching at you as if you don't know these things, but I'm bringing these things back to our remembrance. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And then getting the earnestness and feeding upon these scriptures and feeding upon God's word because none of us in ourselves can make anything happen. But this is what God did say. You know what I guess what I'm trying to say here is you can't give yourself faith. I can't give myself faith. &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that will give us faith. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Hearing the word of God. Come on. &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing &gt;&gt; the word of God. &gt;&gt; So take these scriptures, put these things in our mind and start dwelling upon them and start eating those spiritual vitamins. &gt;&gt; Because every time, every time in the Moses, every time when when sickness came in the in the wilderness, every time Hallelujah. Amen. When there was a when there was a baby that was born that was Amen. And with complications, they'd run to Dr. Moses, Dr. Moses would bring over his little his his little satchel. Amen. His little his little doctor bag. Hallelujah. And he'd pull out, &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that healeth thee. &gt;&gt; You say, "Ah, that's not script." That's what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whenever someone started, Amen. kind of leprosy or something started coming. I am the Lord that health thee. &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Look, look when they got into their own INTO THEIR PROMISED LAND. Did you know that they never even lost one man in battle until Achan sinned? &gt;&gt; That's right. WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING GIANTS, &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ORDAINED OF GOD to do it. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we are ordained of God. &gt;&gt; I don't care who disbelieves. I don't care how much it comes. You are NOT ONE OF THEM. YOU ARE NOT AN EGYPTIAN. YOU ARE NOT A LEODYSIAN. YOU ARE NOT A CHURCH MEMBER. YOU ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; The only thing I see for believer Amen. LAY HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL RECOVER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING THAT I SEE FOR A BELIEVER, AMEN, IS TO SOUND THE TRUMPET. SOUND THAT TRUMPET. LET IT BE KNOWN. LET THE UH THE ears of the believer hear the words of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When Kora led a rebellion against Moses &gt;&gt; and the people believed loudmouth Kora over the vindicated prophet Moses. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a dozen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. There was 14,700 people died of that plague. &gt;&gt; But you know what God said? He He said, "Put up." Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; He He actually He told He told Moses told Aaron, "Run out. Run in there and grab grab the incense colas off of the altar." Amen. And they and and they they they put them in in and they they took the incense and begin to go out there between the living and the dead. And they were and and and they were running out there. Mo Aaron, he was the he was the high priest and he was running out there between and you know what it caused God to stop &gt;&gt; Sure did &gt;&gt; the plague and healed the people &gt;&gt; even for their sins. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, now they were saying, "You're not the only holy man. We're gifted just like you." And you know, God speaks to us just like he speaks to you. And and and all of this. But when Aaron ran out there and started he interceding for healing for the people, THE PLAGUE WAS STOPPED and the people were healed. &gt;&gt; Right. right here. &gt;&gt; What about the other time they're in in numbers uh 16:46 when when when the uh you know that they were dying. Amen. Because they were they were rebelling again. Hallelujah. When thousands of the children of Israel were dying and they were being bit by serpents because of their sin. Hallelujah. But God provided a healing. So, what I'm trying to tell you here tonight, what I'm I'm trying to give you guys some ammo against the devil. &gt;&gt; The devil telling you, "Well, you've sinned and you can't be healed." But it's time if God will do that through a through a a natural man by the name of Aaron. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD WILL COME IN, ARE YOU hearing me? What will he do when Jesus Christ paid the ultimate price? What I'm saying is I I I don't care what the devil's bringing against you tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't care what he's bringing against you tonight. God provided healing. He told Moses to make that serpent of brass and get it lifted up in the midst of the people. And those who looked upon that brass serpent were healed. If they were willing to look away from their sickness and willing to look at that brass serpent, they were healed. Now remember what was Aaron the high priest. We have a priest that has already entered behind the veil interceding for you. &gt;&gt; Come on. What did the brazen serpent? Serpents always represent sin. It was the serpent who introduced sin to Eve. Sin. SERPENT. HALLELUJAH. BRASS SERPENT. It was sin judged. SIN HAS ALREADY BEEN JUDGED BY CALVARY FOR YOU. OH, &gt;&gt; so you can look and live. Well, PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I SAID, "PRAISE THE LORD." WHEN PEOPLE STARTED GETTING LEPOUS, AMEN. LEPROSY COMING OVER AND TAKING THEM OVER. AMEN. During in in in LEVITICUS 14 AND 18, GOD PROVIDED AN atonement for their leprosy. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It don't matter what you are facing here tonight, healing is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here to tell you and I I just You can go through Leviticus that 14th and 15th chapter and it's just anything you can imagine. Amen. He was putting it out there &gt;&gt; to to to make sure that you was going to be healed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, cancer's not in there." Well, it's here now. &gt;&gt; And our brazen serpent has been lifted so high. has been exalted all the way. &gt;&gt; Jesus has been given a name that is above every name. &gt;&gt; Every name. &gt;&gt; Cancer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Parkinson's. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Given a name above every name above diabetes. &gt;&gt; Given a name above all of that. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus come, he says, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, the spirit, to preach deliverance to the captives, the soul, and the recovering of the sight to the blind, the body, to set at liberty them that are bruised, spirit and soul, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whose report do you believe? Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall believe the report of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Whose report do you believe? We shall believe the report of the Lord. His report says I am healed. His report says I am sealed. Whatever. I think I'm singing right. His report says &gt;&gt; I am free. &gt;&gt; His report is victory. Brother Wendell, have you ever do you know of anyone that's been healed of sugar diabetes?

You started praying for the sores in my mouth. Did you know I had sores in my mouth?" And I said, "No." She says, "You prayed and immediately the sores in my mouth left." &gt;&gt; She didn't. She was embarrassed. She wasn't going to ask me to pray. But God knew her heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Come on. God can do anything. He He can do anything. All All he's just wanting is somebody to just believe him for those things. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

And uh he he says, "I'm going to tell you right now." Most of the time when we tell you there's a cancer in a person that want that person will fall apart &gt;&gt; and say, "Get this thing out of me. I don't want this thing in me." And you're over there saying, "It'll be fine. It &gt;&gt; God's going to heal it. AND HER BACKSLIDEN PREACHER SON SAYS, "MAYBE WE SHOULD GET THAT OUT." And she goes, "I don't think so. We're just going to leave it just like it is and let God take CARE OF THAT." &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD. SO, he said on on the last visit, he he he said on the last visit, he said, "You know what? You're gonna die of something. But I really doub I doubt very seriously you're gonna die of cancer &gt;&gt; because she ain't scared of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's our healer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You've got a testimony. &gt;&gt; I remember her. She would get so bad. She would faint. I mean, she listen her blood levels would go so low. She was anemic. That that girl has had has had problems even as a girl. But there was a time when God came on the scene &gt;&gt; when the doctors were having a hard time keeping that iron level up and God healed her. And how long has that been? &gt;&gt; A president a President Trump. Amen. Praise the Lord. SO GOD GOD'S A HEALER. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a healer. There's there's there we could go we we could go through Listen, Kobe shouldn't be here. Kobe when he was he he was he was born uh uh uh three uh he was born a couple months premature, weighed three pounds. And uh uh when when they were born I you know I was he was born uh when she had him uh uh you know they they had they told her not to have any more children. She wouldn't have any more children. She her insides were uh were really rough from what she had went through. Went through some really really rough struggles in old lady. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. said by the time she was 30, she'd have the insides of an old lady, you know, cuz she she had gone through so much. And here she is, 55 years old and just as cute as she ever was. Hallelujah. She was on ICU at St. Francis on the fourth floor, way on the other one side of the hospital. Kobe was in the NICU uh uh way on on the second floor, way on the other side. my wife, my my and and the thing is is after she had the baby, nothing was working. Nothing was working. The organs weren't working. Uh she just getting bigger and bigger. They couldn't get they were they were they were just so concerned. And um so she was in ICU, he was in ICU, and I was just a kid running back and forth. I mean, and and uh uh but when God come on the scene, God healed her. God healed Kobe &gt;&gt; and he don't look like he was ever a preeie. &gt;&gt; Well, what am I saying? There's just no telling what God can do for you tonight. &gt;&gt; Y'all believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I believe that there is no telling. We have seen God do it over and over. I say tonight these needs now we're going to we're fixing to ask sister Denise to come back to come up tonight and um uh and anyone else that wants to be prayed for and we we want you to um uh we're going we're going to pray. And so you know Sister Denise is has been told that cancer has come back and she's got cancer right here in her they're saying this is all cancerous here where that where that big old uh deal is on her on her neck and um and she's it's it's you know getting hard for her to swallow and things of that nature and um but but but let's let's pray for Denise. &gt;&gt; If God can do these other things, why can't he touch &gt;&gt; do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Others that are that that are that have been struggling. Listen, don't let our faith waver. Hold to the promise. Hold. Sometimes we just have to hang on. You say, "Brother Wendle, I was prayed for and I and I've really and I really do I need to get prayed for again." Listen, if you've been prayed for and that you you've you've you've got that faith on that thing, don't let go of it. &gt;&gt; Don't let go of it. I don't care how long it listen uh uh uh Daniel Daniel waited for 21 days &gt;&gt; for his answer and he and he had the assurance at the beginning that that angel says listen I came as soon as I came as soon as you asked but the prince of Persia hath has withstood me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the devil wants to kill every one of us. Yes, &gt;&gt; he wants to. Amen. But listen, I I I just, you know, we got we got we got more important things to do than to be thinking about what the devil thinks about us. &gt;&gt; We've just got a lot more important things to do. We've got to live. And and I say we're going to live. &gt;&gt; That's a scripture. You shall live and not die &gt;&gt; and declare the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We've got important things to do. I I I don't I've got I've GOT IMPORTANT THINGS TO I I don't I don't I don't I ain't got time to be depressed. &gt;&gt; I ain't got time to sit around and wondering if if I'm going to LIVE OR DIE. I'M GOING TO LIVE. &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe God's word. &gt;&gt; I want to live. I want to believe God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want a defeated attitude. I want it. I want to go uh uh uh uh uh you know, I want to go to heaven. I do. But but I do know that somebody has got to declare the purposes of God. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to declare it. Well, why can't it be me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Why can't I be the testimony? &gt;&gt; You know, I to me I I you know that one scripture where Paul says, "For me to to to what what is that?" Uh to to to die is gain. Uh &gt;&gt; uh you know listen he was saying huh &gt;&gt; live as Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah to live as Christ. But he was saying I I you know I I want to go but for your sakes I want to stay. How's that how's that go? Uh u you know &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; You know he's just basically saying hey guys I want to go but you know I also know that that's sort of selfish and so if Christ wants to declare his glory through me then then I'm just going to do that. I I want to do that. So he here we stand here today. I know many times I'm saying, "Lord, just take me home." And I just woo. Hallelujah. And I'll see y'all on the other side. Amen. But if I'm here, God's got a purpose for me. &gt;&gt; I've got to declare I've got to declare the How is God going to declare he's a healer? &gt;&gt; Through me. &gt;&gt; Through you. &gt;&gt; He's got to allow us to get sick. &gt;&gt; He's got to allow US TO GO THROUGH OUR STRUGGLES. That's the only way that we're going to be able to do it. You know, he he does that through he he does that through uh uh you know, but he has to allow guys like Patrick to to to go wayward and and uh you know, go through all of the the junk he went through &gt;&gt; to prove that he's a redeemer. &gt;&gt; He y'all understand what I'm saying? He's got to allow these things But the thing is is he is a redeemer. He is a healer. He is a savior. And I want us to believe that tonight. So if there's anyone that would like to, I know I took a little longer than I wanted to, other than I planned on it, should I say. I uh if if um the musicians would come and then we will you know we just want to pray and I I in a minute we're just all going to gather together and and um we're we're going to pray and Angie's going in for a surgery tomorrow and they think they found out what her problem has been and so um she's she's going in in the morning. Um, we got brother Donald with with that cellulitis and man, they've been running every kind of a uh I mean they they put they they've got him on so many antibiotics right now and u I mean they've got him on a bunch of antibiotics trying to trying to get that that that uh staff or whatever it is killed. And so, uh, I mean, I know I know this ain't just a this this ain't just a a classy, uh, preaching message here tonight, but, I my my deal is I just hope we can get get a clearer picture of who we are, what we are, and let's just get together and let's just believe God for some miracles. &gt;&gt; We really need some miracles. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I mean, okay, brother Jimmy has about lost his sight with diabet diabetes. He's wanting to come to church. Well, why shouldn't we believe that God can heal an 84 year old man and give him his eyesight so he can drive to church? Sister Betty's wanting to be at church, but her legs are are so are so swelled up right now, weeping and and getting sores on her legs. Why can't we believe that an 87 year old woman who wants to be here every service and she would be here every service if she could? &gt;&gt; Why why uh uh uh uh uh you know uh we we've got we we've got all of these that are that are some major needs. &gt;&gt; Why can't we just believe God for that? I mean I'm not I'm not asking I'm not asking you all as if you guys are unbelievers. I'm asking as as as a team, &gt;&gt; why why why can't we as a team &gt;&gt; just pull together and say, "Lord, Brother Torrance has been struggling in his body." Well, what why I I know I know Brother Torrance is is 80. I think he's Aren't you 87, Brother Torrance? 88. 87. &gt;&gt; 85. Woo. I'm trying to push you on. 85. and and he he can't even he can't even come uh church on Sunday mornings because it you know just just uh uh things in his body and and just just having a hard time. He wants to be here. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why? You know, I I just I I just believe the Lord God has a soft spot a soft spot in his heart for those that are needy. And I I I I mean I I believe I had a soft spot in his heart when I was in need and he came along and saved me. &gt;&gt; I believe he still has a soft spot for me. &gt;&gt; I believe he still has a soft spot for all of us. Well, if God saved you, then dog on it, he can heal you. That ain't no problem. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, if u if we could just bring a bring a chair up here for for Denise and and let her sit down up here and then we'll pray for Denise. Um and then anyone else who's who's needing prayer, but some of these ones that I've talked about, Brother Mitch. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, God God is a healer. There's nothing there's nothing too great. And and again, I I don't want any of us any of us coming coming in tonight with the um with the idea of u I I hope I brought I I I I I dealt with the sin problem enough here tonight to let you know Christ took our filth and gave us his righteousness. So you can't come before the Lord and say, "I'm filthy. I don't know if I deserve it." you're righteous. &gt;&gt; If you've accepted the atonement, why not accept your healing? If he redeemed your life from destruction, why not accept all of these other things? Sometimes it can be a little hard for ourselves. It is. It's easier for me to believe for somebody else sometimes than to believe for me because I know me. Praise the Lord. So, if we have a heart tonight that says, "I I'm just going to believe him. I'm going to believe the Lord." Then I want you to come up. There's anyone else that needs to be prayed for, just come you come on up and stand here, too. Uh Denise, come on up. Uh Sister Angie, you come on up. Brother Mitch, you come on up. Uh, anyone that's been fighting, struggling, you just you just need us to pray for you. Now this and then we'd like I'd like for sure you you uh ministers to come and um Kobe if if Mary could play for you and then Um and then um and any of you elders that would like for to come. We're not we're not putting it just to the preachers, but any any of you believing elders now, you know, I I'm I'm a little bit tired tonight and so I don't um I don't really uh you know, feel a little bit scattered, but I I hope I hope that I've I've done a a good enough job laying out my case. We just got to believe the Lord. Yep. Just pass that around, you preachers, and then just pass it around to all of the all of the believers that are that are gathered around now here in in Mark 4 and and we're just going to go ahead and uh read that to you. I wasn't, but I'm going to. And uh now this is I you know I just think faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word. And so we've got to believe. So this is what Jesus said after his resurrection. He he afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and upgraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after his r he was risen. He said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. These signs shall follow them that believe." I just I wonder how many believers we have in the building. &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. If they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. And they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Now, that was what Jesus said just before he left. I'm going to fill you with my spirit. I've got to go. And if I don't go, then the Holy Spirit cannot come and fill you all as a body. You're going to altogether be my body. Now I'm going to the pillar of fire that was in Jesus on the day of Pentecost that logos that pillar of fire separated itself and the cloven tongues of fire came on that 120. Everyone that is filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. A portion of that great pillar of fire comes in them. We are not Jesus Christ. We are not the perfect son of God. But together we make up the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; So you shall lay hands on the sick. Now here in in James 5 and um um 5 and13, is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him sing psalms. And if we need to get uh uh sister Angie a chair, you brothers can bring bring a chair over here for sister Angie, too. is but but y'all y'all listen to me while they're doing it now. Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up. And if he's committed any sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your faults one to another. Pray one for another that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. Can you say amen? now. So, we're just simply doing uh what they have commanded. And so, the oil, we have all got some oil with us. And um uh and so we're just going to uh all gather together and pray. And I know you're here. I know you're here to pray for these and we appreciate that. But I also want us to pray for Sister Tracy. Do you need a chair? Um, I want I want you you just come on up here. I appreciate you coming up to pray, too. And, uh, I think Brother Michael's already anointed y'all. And, uh, now guys, there's no science to this. We just Jesus said, "You'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover." James comes back in, says, "Call for the elders. We're here around you. Anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick. It's just that simple. That's how all of these other miracles have been done. Y'all believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, as we lay hands upon the sick, &gt;&gt; we've got some impossible cases here. Lord, if we don't &gt;&gt; get miracles, &gt;&gt; things could get ugly. &gt;&gt; We don't pretend to be really big in faith. We don't claim to be spiritual supermen. We just simply claim &gt;&gt; to be your children and that you have commissioned us to lay hands on the sick &gt;&gt; and that they would recover. Now, Father, with all the faith that we have, &gt;&gt; we are taking these scriptures that we have talked about tonight and we're applying them to our hearts. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking for a new liver for Sister Angie. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm asking, Lord, that you would take those tumors away, &gt;&gt; that you would dissolve them and heal her, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not going by how we feel. We're not going by what we see. We're not going by what we hear from the doctors. We are going by your word. We have chosen to believe your report, &gt;&gt; Lord. Sister &gt;&gt; Denise father, they the they were going to take and do that surgery on the 26th and they said it's just too complicated. They're sending her to another specialist, Lord. And and Lord, they they're claiming it's all cancerous and father. &gt;&gt; We need a miracle. And &gt;&gt; I'm asking God that you would &gt;&gt; come upon this neck and that you would bring that healing and just totally touch Sister Denise. &gt;&gt; Lord, with all of our faith, we're &gt;&gt; we're putting our hands upon that lamb &gt;&gt; that was shed, that &gt;&gt; blood that was shed for us, and we claim our healing. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I thank you for it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm asking that you would touch her supernaturally right now &gt;&gt; that your grace would be upon her. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see this diabetes and you see, Lord, this bladder. I'm asking God &gt;&gt; that when the doctors have said it's impossible, that there's nothing else they can do. &gt;&gt; I'm asking God that you would just totally touch my sister Tracy. &gt;&gt; I'm asking that you would infuse her with your divine faith. We cannot believe on our own. It requires your faith and we're coming upon we're hearing your word tonight and we're asking you to turn that word into faith. turn our hearing into divine faith. &gt;&gt; We don't know how it happens. We just believe that you do it. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking, God, that you would give her a brand new bladder. &gt;&gt; I'm asking that you would give her, Lord, a blood transfusion. &gt;&gt; Take away that diabetes. &gt;&gt; Help her, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; I thank you for it, Lord. You see this depression and this take away, &gt;&gt; Lord. All of this stuff that Satan has tried to kill this lady, &gt;&gt; Satan's tried, Lord, and he's left her feeling like she's worthless. Left her feeling lonely. But oh, Satan, you're a liar. &gt;&gt; You're a liar. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; No one has ever too far gone. And the blood reaches. I don't care where we are, what we are fighting, where we are in our mind. Satan, you're a liar. &gt;&gt; You're a liar. In the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; bring victory. Give her liberty, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we lay hands. We cast out everything that is contrary. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for doing it, Lord. Hallelujah. The blood sugar, Lord. And I'm asking that you would give him a a blood transfusion. That blood sucking demon. I'm asking you take it out of that body in the name of Jesus &gt;&gt; and give him that healing of his body. Lord, you have done it. You have healed sugar diabetes on many occasions. And we're expecting the same tonight &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Oh God. Oh God. My brother Lord who has struggled in his body Lord. That diabetes Lord. And you see his neck. You see the ailments how Satan Lord would love to just him, Father. But God, we've heard your word. And we're asking God that that word would become faith. and that faith would just rise to the occasion and reach up and claim this promise that has been given specifically to my brother Mitch.

Don't allow that devil back. Now remember what what did what did Jesus say? He says he says when a house has been swept or you cast the devil out he said amen. He said that that devil will leave at the power of Jesus. And then but he says but if we don't he says but that just know that that devil will come right back around. He'll come back in, man. He'll come back around and find the house all swept, no one living inside, and he'll bring seven more with him. And so the angel of the Lord, I told brother Brandham to told him to watch and how that when they would cast out devils and healing and things like that, he said, "You watch 36 to 72 hours." said that devil will come back and if you let him, he'll come right back in. Don't let him. &gt;&gt; Don't let him. Now, he might he he might come in. He might come in come back to you tonight when you're at home.

I'm believing what God said about &gt;&gt; you believe what God said about you. &gt;&gt; Just believe it with all your heart. Praise the Lord. He's so wonderful. His presence is so good.
