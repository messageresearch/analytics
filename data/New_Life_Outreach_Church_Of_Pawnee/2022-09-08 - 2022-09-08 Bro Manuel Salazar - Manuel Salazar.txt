him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of what his will young men say his will it's his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood hallelujah the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath

familiar scripture let's turn to amos chapter 3. amen amos chapter 3 and we're just going to read one verse there familiar verse verse seven amos chapter three and seven surely somebody say surely young men in this row say surely surely surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets let us bow our heads dear precious heavenly father lord jesus we

christ's name and the bride says amen hallelujah you may be seated god is good all the time and all the time god is good so this evening i want to begin by for my brother reuben's sake i want to give him the title of the message tonight for brother reuben and the title of the service would be thoughts i think toward you thoughts i think toward you i want to talk tonight to a special group of people i was telling the church back home i'm getting too old i'm getting too grumpy getting too grouchy to be playing games we're not playing church come on church we're not playing church we're not here just to be seen or to be heard but we're here to praise our god and if we can't praise our god then we better go home because i'm here to praise my god tonight [Applause] now we want to begin i want to just read you something tonight and maybe a few things but brother branham says this in one of the messages he says god he said does things kind of strange how many has ever thought about that and said yeah he does things kind of strange he does things different than what i would have done it or maybe the way that we thought it should have been done god does things different and so the prophet of god came back and he said god does things strange and odd he does think strange and odd and he works in peculiar ways his wonders to perform and so we look at that tonight and we say wow how strange and how odd and how peculiar that god would literally allow his enemy satan to go ahead and choose the battleground he allowed him he said come on you're my enemy and i will allow you to to choose where we're going to have this fight and we find out that satan went ahead and we we know here tonight i know you're well taught that saiyan went ahead and he chose man's head and when brother branham talks about he says he chose man's head by the intellectual and so we have to look at that tonight and say well why would satan choose that why would satan say oh i have the rights to take the battleground and i'm going to take the battle here to your mind and your mind and your mind that's where he's going to place the battle and the reason that he chose that place that satan chose your mind is because he knew that he had access he knew that he could access certain things he knew that he could access your imagination he knew that he could get in there and they conjure up and you'd be imagining things he knew that he could access your conscience he knew that he could access your memory he knew he could access your affections and the way that you see and the way that you're here and the way that you smell he knew he had access to these things and we know that all those things are valuable to us if you've ever not been able to see your eyesight's very valuable to you or your smell or or these things or touch all these things are very valuable to the human being now we look at that and we can say we can all agree with that and say amen now these things are all right the prophet of god said as long as they agree with the word so your eyesight's good as long as it agrees with the word your smell is good it's long your imagination's good as long as it agrees with the word your worship's good as long as it agrees with the word now we want to watch this tonight so he knew that he could have access to these certain avenues and he took advantage of it but i want to tell you tonight he does not have access to the mind of god he has access to man's mind he can get in there by the intellectuals but he does not have access to the mind of god but i'm talking to a special group of people tonight that they have an all-access pass where to the mind of god journey to the center of the mind of god satan does not have access to that the angels do not have access but sons and daughters have access where to the very mind of god [Applause] why why are you saying that brother man because i want to tell you you're a special people you're a chosen people you're a peculiar people you're an odd people we don't have phds in lld's and double lds we have odds o d d our people to kill all your people come on church if we ever decided who was going to preach to us would we choose these men don't tell them about my preacher brother manuel i'm not i'm just saying well you know if it was my pick especially to this guy right here would have never picked him would have never chosen him but god did and that's how that matters notice when we we look to this and we see brother branham in the message called god's power to transform brother brahman said since the opening of those seven seals and them angels just behind the mountain yonder this has become a new book somebody said a new book it's the things that's been heard somebody say hid is being revealed as god promised in revelation 10. he would do it notice this he says and we are the privileged people that god has chosen so tonight i'm talking to a special breed of people here tonight that god has chosen he has elected he has pre-destinated you you're not here tonight by mistake you're not here by some kind of chance do you realize all the things that have to transpire just for you to be here tonight you're here for a reason and the reason is that god called you here tonight god told you to worship him here tonight it's not some kind of chance i said oh i think i'm just going to stroll in and kind of look to see how things are going that's not the way it works god's in control notice this he says and we are the privileged people so just coming from new mexico i just said i don't just come and say well it's brown privilege you know what's coming next and i'm just going to say this white privilege or i'm not just saying it's red privilege or black privilege we are the privileged people who christians [Applause] directions privilege tonight your privilege amongst everything about all the people notice the word privileged privilege means special rights privilege means advantages privileged means or immunities so tonight i'm talking about christian privilege now we looked and we see that god does things kind of strange and odd and brother batman said he works in peculiar ways when we look at the word peculiar it means a purchased possession peculiar means a people selected by god for his own possession but it could also mean unique it could also mean special peculiar can mean out of the ordinary now brother madam takes that word peculiar and if you search it through the message over 230 sometimes brother brahma uses the word peculiar he goes and even to his own birth he says my birth my my birth was a peculiar birth and he goes on he said well moses's birth was a peculiar birth and then he would take it a little further what about your birth and your birth and your birth it was a peculiar birth which one brother the one we celebrated with ronnie no the rebirth that was a peculiar birth that was different than what the world can ever celebrate peculiar birth notice he goes on he mentions a peculiar life how many could relate to a peculiar life here tonight is your life peculiar he comes and he says oh is this a peculiar ministry he mentions a peculiar feeling a peculiar child a peculiar specie a peculiar time peculiar ways peculiar actions a peculiar stone a peculiar sword or peculiar thing but more than that a peculiar people notice he says were called out of the world how many are called out of the world tonight remember a privileged people tonight he said we're called out of the world a peculiar people to do what to serve god god called an odd bunch of people to serve him he got a bunch of odd preachers to preach for him peculiar he says oh he peculiar to serve god and he said zealous unto good works notice in another place brother ram says peculiar because now we know that we're peculiar but why are we so peculiar why would he say we're peculiar and or we're different or or we're odd or we're this or that notice he says we're peculiar because someone say because we're peculiar because we're a people that are looking to god's word there's not a people out there that are looking at god's word they're not looking to it they're looking to ball games they're looking to all kinds of uh recreation but we're a people what what are you doing here what are you doing on your birthday what are we doing here in elk season pre-destinated us to be here tonight well you say well brother man i need a little more well let me tell you in deuteronomy chapter 14 and verse 2 the bible says for thou art unholy people i'm talking to you you are a holy people he said for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all nations that are upon the earth and then we go to the new testament and in first peter it says oh it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of who of him who have called you out of darkness into this marvelous light you're acting like that's not enough i just told you how great and how wonderful you are and you're like oh okay you're amazing you're wonderful yeah okay right sometimes you tell your wife that say oh i love you just no you don't no no i really i really love you say no i don't know if you really do and hear the lord's telling you tonight i love you your chosen people you're a wonderful people i don't know if he really does oh baby [Applause] maybe maybe i'm young maybe he loves that side better than this side now remember he said we're peculiar because we're looking to god's word we're peculiar because we're looking to god's word now if we're looking to god's word and we're peculiar because of that somewhere somebody left god's word because if they had it we wouldn't be peculiar looking for it but we know in the book of revelations right we we go in there and we see that there's a rebuke to every age notice the book in ephesus what was the rebuke thou has left thy first love we move on quickly into smyrna what was the rebuke i know thy blasphemy we go to pergamus what was the rebuke doctrine of balaam and nicolaitans we go to thiateria what was the rebuke thou suffers that woman jezebel to do what to teach to teach and serve the rebuking sardis i have not found thy work perfect before god notice the rebuke in philadelphia thou has little strength that's like many people in our day say well i got a little bit brother how are you doing i'm just hanging in there what do you mean you're just hanging in there you just said by your own testimony you got the holy ghost you're saying you crossed over to the promised land so come on start packing some grapes no we can't pack into the church oh i don't know i don't know brother william we're kind of sad you know you don't know what happened to me today or oh i'm not sure you know work was pretty difficult and oh my family's been rough while me and oh you don't know all the things wait a minute you said you've crossed over to the other hand you're the one to be getting a brother say let's pack the ring i have back and forth [Applause] you say how do i feel it doesn't matter how i feel [Applause] what's happening in the world it doesn't matter what's happening in the world i'm packing grades i'm a great packer packing him packing him say brother get off how about your brother how about your sister you know at home and i wasn't going to say this i have a big bottle and honest says goody goody that's the goody goody bottle he said oh well the the goody goody bottles for the one who's mad at their pastor so you mad at the preacher let me spray you with some goody goody oh i'm mad at the deacons because i don't really maybe let me spray with some goodies judy so i don't know i i'm upset let me spray you with some goody-goody and every time someone's sitting there like i said i know just the remedy goody goody spray well what do you say well where'd you get that brother brandon said it he said we're not a bunch of hotbed plants i said what is that so when you walk into a into a place where they have all the plants and it's a controlled environment and the mister's coming and it's 90 degrees and it's warm in there and all the plants are happy and they're growing so long as they're getting goody goody goody and you know it's goody goody goody until you leave the doors and then you get out there in the wind and let me tell you if you're not grounded in the word you snap and you snap this way and it doesn't matter if even god himself would come and call you a dog you'd say that's nothing but the truth that syrophoenicia little lady she come on the scene and said wow everything you're telling me is true hey you said it it's nothing but the truth and sometimes we need the honest brutal truth you ought to be the happiest most blessed the most privileged people on the face of the earth and you see the pastor coming back here for his goody goody spray he's i don't need that i don't need no goody goody spray what i need is the word come back to the word so you might say tonight i got a little bit of strength goody goody now are you happy can we move on everybody's happy right those that are mad you got goody goody sprayed those that are sad you got goody goody spread those that are mad at the pastor goody-goody mad at all the preachers goody goody you know that was a rebuke in that age many people said well he did say that at least we have a little bit did you not listen to brother ronnie's service last night he said we're in the bright age he said we're there the limit i said oh my goodness then why are we wearing you should have been in coming in and encouraging your brother encouraging your sister hey how many times as a preacher have you gone to the hospital and the very person you're talking to encourages you and you walk out of there and say well i came to encourage her and i'm more encouraged than ever then i said did the pastor need some you know brother wendell one thing while we walked around so it's really tough it's a different breed of people these days they just won't listen you tell them the truth and they get upset notice in the last stage the rebuke to the philadelphia to the laodicean age was lukewarm wretched miserable poor blind naked but notice this in the church age book brother man comes back and he says every fresh and true revival somebody say fresh somebody say true he said every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age notice he said the cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of god repent and come back to the word for the first book in the bible genesis to the last book revelation there is only one reason for god's displeasure somebody say one reason there's only one way to really upset our god and that is leave his word and you say well brother i don't know i just i just don't know what's happening in my life you know what's happening where did you leave him let's make it simple say i'm having issues wait wait let's go back let's find where you left it now i'm not talking about the trials and tribulation that he allows us to go through you know the difference between that but there's something where he said oh i just don't feel it anymore you know i'm not so sure you know maybe church ain't that important anymore you know i kind of this or that whatever that it is maybe you're getting a little lukewarm and you know it and notice brother adam because he says there's only one reason for god's displeasure leaving the word he said and there is only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word [Applause] that's pretty simple isn't it even us in new mexico could understand that he said if we have god upset somewhere we left his word and all we have to do is repent and do what come back to his word well praise god i i i'm not so sure i like when someone tells me what's wrong and they never give me the answer right say oh well this is wrong and this is happening okay well tell us the answer tell me how to get out of this [Applause] well praise the lord so i'm going to ask how many here have gotten back to the word how many here have gotten back to the word then don't fuss about it all right when the revival comes don't fuss about it i say when the revival comes don't fuss about it don't try to put it in the box and say well this is the way the revival has to be oh this is the way the revival has to be well let me tell you the revival will be however god wants it to be i ain't gonna put him into a box if i want to shout herself if i want to run around if i want to cry i'll cry if i don't want to say a word i won't say a word but don't tell me how my revival is because i know what's happening in here and because people are out there jumping and shouting don't be jealous hey i'm happy when i see people shouting in the [Applause] lord i'm happy when i see young people on fire i don't know why we've got to come and say well brother jonathan i'm going to worry about your church or i'm going to worry about your church or your church or your church i'm not worried about nothing because god's not going to lose a wine i think sometimes we don't realize that we have problems at our own place and we have to look out somewhere else well that makes you feel good that makes you feel good if you want another dab of goody goody we got some back here for you if you need a back rub i can't help you there notice brother brandon in a message called jehovah jira one he says we've had a revival he said joel said oh he said we fast so much about ladder rain and he goes on to say well the latter rain had movements called the latter rain he said the latter rain the former rain the inner rain the outer rain they were all fussing about well it's this rain and it's not rain well let me tell you we were in a mega drought just a couple months ago back home and let me tell you the indians were dancing come on church we were on our knees praying people were asking for the rain and let me tell you when the rain came we didn't evaluate it we didn't come and say oh yeah we just started drinking let's drink again and we didn't worry about them over there said oh well they said they brought it because they danced i said it's here where is it it's here so let me tell you don't be about it just start drinking just start drinking when that rain comes start drinking it so oh i don't know this water it came down pretty heavy it came up really fast i don't know well let me tell you i like it that way [Applause] hey when we were in a mega drought everything was dry i was looking at the earth saying my goodness it's turning to sand and let me tell you when the rain came those weeds they didn't care where it came from remember they thank the rain too come on church they take the rain too but let me tell you the good plants they just drink and drink and drink that rain and let me tell you growing and growing and producing [Applause] we were i was looking at the men's chat and uh brother wayne put out something he was talking about a season and this was a season that we were going through back home he said there's a season of sending and then there's a season of receiving remember we were asking the lord send the rain but when it came it was time to recede and to produce [Applause] you know some you know how many know the old saying you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink well let me tell you i got a couple horses and i moved one to greener pastures and i took him over there and he's all he didn't know where to start he was just used to eating out of a feeder i mean there was no grass we'd throw him in hay but i took him to a green pasture kind of like what you guys got out here he didn't know to go this way to go that way where to start eating i'm like it's everywhere but i realized when i put him there i said well he needs water so i got a trough and i filled it up with water and i knew he was thirsty and he comes and he's looking at the trough what is he doing he's like [Music] that's like some people come to church and they see the preacher he comes down don't come with me [Music] brother andrew i was i was putting my hand in there it's in here look it's water splashing him he's oh i don't know splashing sometimes you gotta use a church and there's a lock it's water it's water it's water don't be afraid of it break it out freeze it up fill up the water fix the water water water water water water water water water water water water and before he do anything just water come on church we don't have to force you to drink water you're the most blessed people on the face of the planet you just say just freak me the water i don't care what vessel it can it could be that one or that one of them and that wouldn't ever just bring the water and when it comes it's hard to receive [Applause] [Music] you won't get me refusing to drink i don't care what odd vessel he chose the foolishness of preachers of preaching he said i'm going to pick that group over there and they're going to preach my word in the last day yes sir well hallelujah do we have another two hours [Applause] in the message called ensign brotherhood say just because they love god they're peculiar to the world what's that guess what just because just because you love god you're peculiar to the world notice he says but remember he said they're blessed in the sight of god peculiar to the world but blessed in the sight of god notice he said god's people is peculiar people a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to god you know what that is that's your amen your hallelujah that's your second preacher notice brother i said that's the fruit of your lips giving praise to his name how many praise the lord when do we praise him we praise him we adore him in the good times in the bad times some of you right now don't want to praise him and that's the best time that's the best time when the devil comes and says don't move [Applause] don't let the devil get on your sink that can't move i'm just a girl don't think i'm weird you're already old sister sharon all right what's he tell you don't move don't move it's not deep enough it's not wonderful to stay down don't move that's the time to move that's the best time to move oh devil you ain't gonna hold me down you're not gonna hold my here to praise god somebody praise god tonight somebody shout the victory praise him praise the lord hallelujah praise jesus oh devil you're not going to hold me down he said i might be young but he can't hold me down somebody said all the graves can't hold me down gravity can't hold me down all these non-believers ain't gonna hold me down [Applause] somebody give the devil a black guy ah give me ten more minutes noticing hallelujah this is my kind of party this is how i want to spend my birthday yes right good brother actually that care about you yeah let's go on to spend it right where's god tonight yeah where is he way out there so our opening scripture right book of ephesians notice we find out when you search it out it's written to believers somebody say that it's written to me brother says not to the outside world but to the saints a chosen people the book of ephesians to a predestinated people to a redeemed people and we understand the revelation of this was given to paul by the holy ghost it wasn't paul but it was the holy ghost working through paul to give us this revelation so this revelation doesn't come by man it's not a man just calling you a chosen people tonight it's not a man saying you're privileged just because he thinks so but it's because god thinks so [Applause] but notice brother ben takes that in the adoption theory and he says now he says the first thing he says and he's talking about the revealed word he said the first thing paul starts out here to tell the people he said remember this is to the church not to the outsider it's a mystery and a riddle to him never able to understand it it goes over the top of his head but notice he said he does no more know about it than nothing but watch what he says bought to the church he said it's honey it's rock oh he said it's joy unspeakable oh it's blessed assurance somebody say blessed assurance it's the anchor of the soul it's our hope and our stay it's the rack of ages and it's everything that's good it's everything that's good now the bible said in first john it says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world no with us not yeah because it knew him not it says beloved now somebody say now now are we the sons of god and daughters now we're the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but but know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is i'm trying to close here so listen he says no he says the bible said somebody said the bible said the bible said now you're the sons of god not you will be somebody say i've always been i've always been you are right now right now we are the sons of god right now we're seated together what you said earlier brother wendell where in heavenly places in christ jesus not tomorrow this night tonight we're the sons of god so i guess we've established something who you are notice brother baptist he says when you can think now that you're sitting but look at him different brother colby look at your wife not just as your wife amen but a part of god that lives in there brother during look at sis in her is a daughter of god let me tell you you're going to look at your spouse differently tonight she's straight but look at john and john look at sister april i'm looking at sister shannon i know who's in here because she backs me up it's the god that's in her and you mess with me be careful now notice he says now he says that you're sitting by a son of god or a daughter of god and you are the same as they are you act different when god is sitting next to you you praise different when you know god is sitting right next to you [Music] notice he says and you are the same as they are and christ jesus is tabernacled in you here on earth notice he says showing the great manifestation of his blessings and power willing that everyone should be saved notice and you'll go after a brother and you'll go after a sister yes sir why because it's now christ in you and your desires are different you wouldn't that nobody be lost [Applause] notice he said that everyone should be healed would that be your desire tonight not just me not just thinking oh well i need your lord i need you to say wait wait a minute my brother my sister my sister my brother up there down and they all need you lord my desire is that nobody would be sick that nobody would be lost and i look next to me and i know who's sitting by me he said that all none should be perished oh he said i tell you if you could really fathom that means to comprehend that means to understand if you could really fathom that in your mind i tell you you wouldn't have to have any prayer for the sick that's right what do you mean brother that means if you would really know who's here tonight if you would really get the revelation that who's sitting next to you and you and you and you you really have an understanding that there wouldn't even have to be one prayer if you could fathom it if you could understand it church we're coming to a place where we're realizing who we are and who's sitting next to us [Applause] and then privilege would come to a whole other level can i have five more minutes brother wendell brother baby says this in a message called the angel of the lord he said it's in the mind of christ that the human being has the privilege to enter in remember satan himself cannot enter in the angels [Music] cannot enter in they have to guess they have to wonder remember what's he doing what's his plan how's this unfolding how's this working and they're wondering but we've come to an age above all ages to where we've been welcomed in where we can now come and enter into the mind of god [Applause] and he said when they open those chills yes sir that's right now we've enabled it the seal was opened right and it allowed us to enter in and what the angels couldn't get into what the devil couldn't get into we stepped in [Applause] and we said wow look at this oh i was saying what does it mean to be in a bright age what does it mean it means now we have the full mind of god we've entered him come on church who's gonna step in with me tonight listen to our feed
