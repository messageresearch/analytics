[42:08] through there's something that's a
[42:09] companion amen if you have your Bibles
[42:13] let's turn to Matthew 4 and 1.
[42:15] I have a lengthy passage of scripture
[42:18] this morning
[42:19] um
[42:20] are you happy to be in the house of the
[42:22] Lord amen
[42:26] like it's been said our pastor is in
[42:28] Virginia
[42:29] there for Uncle Sean's 50th birthday
[42:31] party
[42:32] um he had Uncle Sean had Josiah out all
[42:35] day thinking that it was going to be at
[42:36] Josiah's birthday party and so whenever
[42:39] Sean came in and realized it was for him
[42:40] it was a look of surprises on his face
[42:43] it was pretty funny
[42:44] and so he was definitely surprised he
[42:46] said well Jonathan's here Wendell's here
[42:48] Dad's here so it's pretty funny seeing
[42:51] his reactions so amen Uncle Jonathan
[42:54] will be preaching this morning and Dad
[42:56] will be preaching tonight so I we pray
[42:59] that they have some good services but
[43:01] Matthew 4 1 and we realize this is the
[43:03] scripture right after John baptizes
[43:06] Jesus and the spirit you know descended
[43:08] upon him but Matthew 4 and 1 then Jesus
[43:11] was led up into the Wilderness to be
[43:13] tempted of the devil and when he had
[43:15] fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was
[43:17] afterward of hunger and when the tempter
[43:20] came to him and he said if thou be the
[43:22] Son of God command these stones to be
[43:24] made bread but you notice how he come at
[43:27] his weakest moment he was hungry he was
[43:28] in fasting for 40 days and he come at
[43:31] his weakest moment in the fourth verse
[43:33] but he answered and said it is written
[43:34] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[43:37] every word that proceedeth out of the
[43:39] mouth of God then the devil would taketh
[43:41] him up into the holy city and sitteth
[43:43] him Upon A Pinnacle of the Temple people
[43:44] and said unto him if thou be the Son of
[43:47] God cast thyself down for it is written
[43:49] he shall give his angels Church
[43:51] concerning thee and in their hands they
[43:53] shall bear thee up lest at any time thou
[43:55] shall Dash thy foot against the stone
[43:57] and Jesus said unto him it is written
[43:59] again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[44:01] God again the devil taketh him up into
[44:04] the exceeding high mountain and showed
[44:06] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[44:08] the glory of them and he said unto him
[44:10] all these things will I give unto thee
[44:12] if thou will fall down and worship me
[44:14] then Jesus said unto him get thee hence
[44:17] Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[44:19] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[44:21] shall thou serve then the devil leaveth
[44:23] him and behold Angels Came and
[44:25] ministered unto him and now when Jesus
[44:27] had heard that John was cast into prison
[44:30] he departed unto Galilee and leave
[44:32] leaving Nazareth he came into Wilton
[44:34] Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast
[44:37] and the borders of zebulun and Nephilim
[44:39] that it might be fulfilled which was
[44:42] spoken by Isaias the prophet saying the
[44:45] land of Zebulon and the land of Nephilim
[44:47] by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan
[44:49] Galilee of the Gentiles the people which
[44:52] set in darkness saw great light and and
[44:54] to them which set in the region and
[44:55] shadow of death light is sprung up and
[44:58] from that time Jesus began to preach and
[45:01] to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[45:03] is at hand and Jesus walking by the Sea
[45:06] of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called
[45:09] Peter and Andrew his brother casting a
[45:11] net into the sea for they were Fishers
[45:13] and he said unto them follow me and I
[45:16] will make you Fishers of Men and they
[45:18] straightway left their Nets and followed
[45:20] him and going on from thence he saw two
[45:23] other Brethren James the son of zebaby
[45:25] and John his brother in the ship with
[45:27] his ever be their father amending their
[45:30] Nets and he called them and they
[45:31] immediately left the ship and their
[45:33] father and followed him and Jesus went
[45:36] about all Galilee teaching and their
[45:38] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[45:40] the Kingdom healing on manner of
[45:42] sicknesses and all manner of diseases
[45:44] among the people and as Fame went
[45:46] throughout all Syria and they brought
[45:48] unto him all sick people that were taken
[45:50] with the diverse diseases torments and
[45:53] they which were possessed but devils and
[45:55] they which were lunatics and they that
[45:57] have policy and he healed them amen can
[46:00] be about our heads this morning dear
[46:02] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to
[46:05] thank you for the the word you've given
[46:07] us Lord Jesus God lord all that the Lord
[46:10] all the the forerunners had to go
[46:12] through Lord to get this printed Bible
[46:14] Lord we want to say thank you we take it
[46:16] for granted too many times God but Lord
[46:18] we want to say thank you for the word
[46:20] you've given us Lord we want to thank
[46:21] you for the service that you've allowed
[46:23] us to be and Lord as we come into this
[46:25] part of the service God you know the
[46:27] needs of the people I ask that you would
[46:29] anoint your servant Lord help me to get
[46:30] myself out of the way father and speak
[46:32] the words that you would have we ask
[46:34] these things in your precious name amen
[46:37] you may be seated and I know that was a
[46:40] familiar scripture and a long scripture
[46:42] but if I had a title it would be the a
[46:44] season of pressure and I know this is
[46:47] the quote they'll be all no but brother
[46:48] Branham says unless we suffer with him
[46:50] we cannot reign with him you have to
[46:53] suffer to Reign the reason for this is
[46:56] that character is simply never made
[46:57] without suffering character is a victory
[47:00] not a gift he says a man without
[47:02] character can't Reign because power
[47:04] apart from character is satanic but with
[47:07] power character is fit to rule and since
[47:10] he wants us to share even his throne on
[47:13] the same basis that he overcome and has
[47:15] set down in his throne then we have to
[47:18] overcome to sit with him and I love this
[47:21] part and he's quoting a scripture here
[47:22] in the little temporary suffering that
[47:24] we go through now it's not worthy to be
[47:27] compared to the tremendous Glory that be
[47:30] that will be revealed in us when he
[47:33] comes and oh what Treasures are laid up
[47:36] for those who are willing to enter into
[47:38] his kingdom through much tribulation and
[47:41] I just love how the Bible puts these
[47:42] he's quoting the scripture and Romans 8
[47:44] 16 the spirit itself bearth witness with
[47:47] our spirit that we are the children of
[47:50] God and if the children then heirs Heirs
[47:52] of God join heirs with Christ if so be
[47:55] that we suffer with him that we might be
[47:58] also glorified together for our reckon
[48:00] that the sufferings of this present time
[48:02] are not worthy to be compared with the
[48:05] glory which shall be revealed in us so
[48:08] he's saying the things I'm going through
[48:10] right now it's not worthy to be even
[48:12] compared can't even be in the same
[48:14] sentence in what we're going to gain
[48:17] from this suffering but brother Branham
[48:19] says character is not a it's not a gift
[48:22] but it's a victory it's something that
[48:24] we gotta fight for it's something we got
[48:26] not necessarily earn but it's not
[48:28] something that's given to us we've got
[48:30] to fight for it because power apart from
[48:32] character is satanic and brother Branham
[48:35] says this is that right waiting God
[48:37] trying to place his church in a position
[48:39] to manifest himself getting one that can
[48:42] work through this and say that that my
[48:45] spirit flowing freely there it is I can
[48:47] work there get another one over here and
[48:49] place him I can place him adoption
[48:51] placing manifesting he says God is
[48:54] trying to get his church in a position
[48:56] where he can manifest himself through
[48:59] that church but we know but we know if
[49:02] we don't got the character of God we're
[49:04] always going to display our feelings
[49:06] we're going to display what we think is
[49:08] right what what our manifest our own
[49:10] desires but God is wanting somebody that
[49:13] has his character that can display his
[49:16] power his authority look at Isaiah 8 and
[49:19] 20 to the law and to the testimony if
[49:21] they speak not according to the word it
[49:24] is because there was no light in them in
[49:27] other words their actions their words is
[49:29] going to display the character that is
[49:32] on the inside so God is looking for
[49:35] somebody that is going to display his
[49:37] word through every trial through every
[49:39] circumstance through every hard time
[49:41] through every suffering there's a
[49:43] character on the end side that is
[49:45] displaying the authority of the word we
[49:48] can look at dictators throughout the
[49:49] span of the world we had Hitler Stalin
[49:52] Mussolini Saddam Hussein all of these
[49:54] men had power but without the character
[49:57] to to use that power that becomes
[50:00] satanic they become uh uh they they
[50:02] become rulers that were hated they hated
[50:05] people that throw them in prison they
[50:06] weren't that that power was immense to
[50:08] bind people but that power was meant to
[50:11] loose the captives the power was meant
[50:13] to set him free but without the
[50:15] character to use that power they're
[50:17] abiding the people and I thought oh my
[50:20] that's the way it is with many people
[50:21] they don't got their character to use
[50:24] the word so they're putting people in
[50:26] condemnation they're putting people
[50:28] under the rule of a man but God ain't
[50:31] God didn't call us to be put in
[50:33] condemnation but under the character of
[50:36] Christ we can fulfill the word that he
[50:39] has for this generation so any man
[50:41] without character will abuse the power
[50:44] that is God we look at politicians
[50:46] politicians they're all dirty now judges
[50:49] can be Bots all of these high rulers can
[50:51] be above the presidents have got their
[50:53] own agendas now what is it they've got
[50:55] power but they don't got character to
[50:58] use that power and so the Apostle Paul
[51:00] is telling us in Romans if we suffer
[51:03] with him if we gain a character then we
[51:06] can be glorified with him we can sit
[51:09] with the same Authority we can sit with
[51:11] the same power with the same mindset
[51:14] that God has we can have but that only
[51:18] comes through the sufferings through the
[51:20] trials through the tribulations it's
[51:22] through those things that are carnal
[51:25] character is being beat out and start to
[51:28] reflect God's character you know being a
[51:31] think of the diamond the diamond in the
[51:33] ref that it it's in a horrible spot but
[51:35] as that diamond as as that Master starts
[51:37] to beat on that diamond it's chipping
[51:39] off all of the heart spots it's shipping
[51:42] off all of the heart and the pointy spot
[51:43] watch until he can look into that
[51:46] diamond and see his own character he can
[51:49] see a reflection of himself and that's
[51:51] what God is wanting he don't want to
[51:53] abide with their own agendas with her
[51:55] own mindset with their own actions but
[51:58] he's wanting somebody that he can look
[52:00] at and seek himself he can see a bride
[52:03] both of us bone flesh of his flesh power
[52:05] of power of his power she is him that's
[52:08] what he is wanting in this generation is
[52:12] somebody with a character that is like
[52:14] unto him but you looked at First Peter 4
[52:17] and 12. beloved think it not strange
[52:19] concerning the fiery triumph which is to
[52:22] try you as though some strange thing
[52:24] happened unto you but rejoice in so much
[52:27] as ye are partakers of Christ's
[52:30] suffering so he's saying here he is
[52:33] counting you worthy enough to go through
[52:35] the same things that Christ went through
[52:38] so we've got a right to rejoice in every
[52:41] trial we've got a right to rejoice in
[52:44] every Affliction because God has enough
[52:46] confidence in you to put you through the
[52:49] same thoughts the same sufferings that
[52:52] Christ went through so you can have the
[52:54] same results that Christ have I don't
[52:57] believe that we are a powerless
[52:59] individual but because of the sufferings
[53:01] that we're going through it's producing
[53:04] a character a character to rule you see
[53:08] brother Branham says this that is what
[53:10] Peter said is it a strange thing that
[53:13] God wants us to develop a christ-like
[53:15] character that comes through suffering
[53:18] no sir we and we have all have trials we
[53:21] are all tried and chastise the sons no
[53:24] one that goes through that the church
[53:26] the church that is not suffering is not
[53:29] being tried and it isn't of God and I
[53:32] thought my many people think after they
[53:34] get the Holy Ghost the battle is over
[53:36] with but in reality the battle is just
[53:39] starting whenever we get the Holy Ghost
[53:41] the Holy Ghost ain't to take the trials
[53:43] away the Holy Ghost equips you to press
[53:47] through the trials the Holy Ghost equips
[53:49] you the Press through the sufferings you
[53:51] look at Ephesians 6 and 10 finally my
[53:53] brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[53:56] the power of his mind so the first step
[53:59] of Christianity is to be strong in the
[54:02] Lord and in the power of His might then
[54:05] watch the next verse say put on the
[54:07] whole armor of God that you might be
[54:10] able to stand against the Wows of the
[54:12] devil so in order to stand you got to be
[54:15] strong in the power of His might in
[54:17] order to put the armor on you've got to
[54:20] be strong in the power of His might in
[54:22] order to obtain character you have to be
[54:25] strong in the power of His Amite so the
[54:28] Holy Ghost don't do away with the trials
[54:30] it gives you a perseverance to go
[54:33] through the trial you see the Apostle
[54:35] Paul through human strength could not
[54:37] those three beatings could not go
[54:39] through scorchings do not go through
[54:41] stonies and shipwrecks and to be
[54:43] beheaded but because he had an anchor on
[54:46] the inside he had the strength of the
[54:48] Lord on the inside he was able to
[54:51] persevere to gain the character and in
[54:54] your own strength you would be blown
[54:56] away by every trial you'll be blown away
[54:58] by every persecution but I believe
[55:00] there's a bride that is in the strength
[55:03] of his power the power of his strength
[55:05] and we're not being blown away we're not
[55:08] wishy-washy Christians but there's a
[55:10] strength on the inside that is
[55:12] persevering through everything we go
[55:14] through so getting the Holy Ghost is the
[55:17] start of our battle career it's where
[55:19] we're enlisting and God is building a
[55:21] character inside of us you see brother
[55:24] Branham talks about uh uh talks about
[55:27] the Eagles and he says what are the
[55:28] equal among the eagle do he says
[55:30] whenever it gets to a certain point she
[55:32] starts to pluck out all of the soft
[55:34] things in the nest she's wanting to
[55:36] she's wanting to build a character
[55:38] inside of them inside of that eagle you
[55:41] know I like helping the Brandon puts it
[55:43] he says now the mother is determined
[55:45] them little Eagles are not to be
[55:48] chickens but she's determined that they
[55:50] are not to be you know what she does
[55:52] says she struts up and down the nail
[55:54] spreads and she says looky here honey
[55:56] how great I am see here you've got the
[55:59] trust me I'm going to take you somewhere
[56:02] where you have to trust me and how do I
[56:04] know that God has a scent these sick
[56:07] people in this afternoon the same way
[56:09] put you in a place where the doctor you
[56:12] may say I'm a Christian brother Branham
[56:14] I know it I've got the Holy Ghost and
[56:16] here I am suffering and he says this how
[56:18] do you know that Jehovah that Jehovah's
[56:21] not just trying to get you to look
[56:23] through his wings and see how great he
[56:26] is how great I am I'm going to do
[56:28] something for you but you have to trust
[56:31] me and so he's saying the mama ego in
[56:34] order to determine that those are those
[56:37] eaglets are not chickens they've got to
[56:39] go through some character building they
[56:41] got to go through some trials they've
[56:43] got to go go through some hard times and
[56:45] those sufferings is building up an
[56:47] ego-like character that separates them
[56:50] from the chickens oh my and the
[56:53] sufferings that you go through is
[56:55] building up a christ-like character that
[56:58] separates you from the serpent seed it
[57:01] separates you from The Cast Away God and
[57:04] raising serpent say God ain't raising
[57:06] Castaways God ain't raising one of these
[57:09] but he's got he's got his children on
[57:11] Earth Sons and Daughters of God that are
[57:14] going through some hard times to produce
[57:16] a character that is likened unto him but
[57:20] he says you've got to trust me and it's
[57:22] only an eagle that can trust Mama ego
[57:24] how come because she came from Mama
[57:27] Eagle he knows that I come from that
[57:30] eagle and he's got my best interest in
[57:33] mine and I think that's the way it is
[57:35] with the children of God we've been born
[57:37] by The Germ life of God and we know no
[57:40] matter what we go through he's got our
[57:43] best in interest in mind you see so
[57:46] whenever a mama Eagle wants to see the
[57:48] eagle-like character she sends them
[57:50] through some testings and here's another
[57:52] quote mother Branham says and soaring so
[57:55] high way in the air here's the funny
[57:56] part about it when she got up there you
[57:59] know what she'd done she shook them off
[58:01] off of her wings she wasn't they wasn't
[58:05] going to be chickens they had to fly and
[58:08] I love how he keeps pointing back that
[58:10] some point what is going to separate the
[58:13] chicken from the eagle is the character
[58:15] that the sufferings is bringing upon
[58:18] hope you're catching it this morning
[58:19] what is separating you from the rest of
[58:23] the world it's the sufferings it's
[58:25] building a character on the inside that
[58:28] is making you fit to rule we're gonna
[58:30] rule one day and we're gonna March over
[58:33] the ashes of the wicked but character or
[58:36] power without character is not fit to
[58:39] rule we may not want to go through
[58:40] sufferings we might not want to go
[58:42] through hard times but God has his
[58:45] Authority waiting for you he has a he
[58:47] has a throne waiting for you but you
[58:49] just have to overcome the sufferings
[58:52] you've got a person here and come out on
[58:55] the other side ready to roll but you're

[58:59] persevere you see God is sending you
[59:02] through some times you see brother
[59:03] Branham says this cloudy skies and the
[59:06] storms of life or not signs of God's
[59:09] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[59:12] still water signs of his love and
[59:14] approval and so you may feel like God
[59:17] has forgotten about you because you're
[59:19] in the trial of your life that doesn't
[59:21] mean God has not approved you but he is
[59:24] standing there right beside you watching
[59:27] character build you notice Mama Eagle
[59:29] don't leave the baby eaglets whenever
[59:32] she knocks it off her Wing she's flying
[59:34] right beside him watching it every step
[59:36] of the way waiting for it to Flap those
[59:39] wings and take off the character
[59:41] building is not the eagle by itself but
[59:45] it's a mama Eagle right beside it every
[59:47] step of the way and character building
[59:49] inside of your life is not you by
[59:52] yourself it's Papa God next to you every
[59:55] step of the way saying come on son
[59:57] you've got this the end of the trial is
[1:00:00] right ahead of you I see light after the
[1:00:02] end of the tunnel you're not going down
[1:00:04] but you're going up it's a character
[1:00:07] that I'm building on the inside of you
[1:00:09] so that you can rule one day oh we don't
[1:00:13] like the suffering but we are going to
[1:00:15] like the ruling part we always do like
[1:00:17] the yin product of the suffering but you
[1:00:20] see where the Brandon continues on to
[1:00:21] say his approval of any of us is in the
[1:00:25] Beloved here's the love is elective
[1:00:27] which he had for us before the
[1:00:29] foundation of the world how does does he
[1:00:32] love us oh yes but how shall we know we
[1:00:35] shall know because he said so and so in
[1:00:38] order for us to know that God loves us
[1:00:41] is to walk by faith the only way that we
[1:00:44] can feel love from anybody's the trust
[1:00:46] that they love me we can see their
[1:00:48] actions we can see how their their
[1:00:50] expressing their love but it still takes
[1:00:53] trust to say my mom loves me that my dad
[1:00:56] loves me because anybody can come up and
[1:00:58] say your parents don't love you the
[1:01:01] devil does that with many children
[1:01:02] nobody loves your mama don't like you
[1:01:04] Daddy don't like you and even though
[1:01:06] they're expressing their love without a
[1:01:09] trust in them you can never appreciate
[1:01:11] the love of the parents and that's the
[1:01:13] way it is with God the devil will come
[1:01:15] and season left you by yourself and if
[1:01:18] there's not a trust there you can never
[1:01:20] appreciate the love of God it's the love
[1:01:23] of God that we go through sufferings
[1:01:25] because he's wanting us to rule one day
[1:01:28] oh my brother random continues on to say
[1:01:30] and manifested he did love us for he
[1:01:33] brought us to himself and gave us his
[1:01:36] Spirit placing us our sons and how shall
[1:01:39] I prove my love to him by believing what
[1:01:42] he said and by conducting myself with
[1:01:45] joy in the midst of the trial that he
[1:01:48] and his wisdom allows to come to pass he
[1:01:52] says how do we express love back to God
[1:01:55] is having joy in the trial that he
[1:01:58] allowed to come to pass so the devil can
[1:02:01] never put you through anything that he
[1:02:04] did not run through God first come on
[1:02:06] now the devil don't got free rule over
[1:02:09] your life he can only do what God allows
[1:02:12] and brother Branham is saying here it's
[1:02:14] by God's wisdom that you go through
[1:02:17] sufferings but in the midst of the
[1:02:19] sufferings you can still have joy
[1:02:21] because you are experiencing the love of
[1:02:24] God oh hallelujah it's not the hatred of
[1:02:26] God that you're going through the valley
[1:02:29] of the shadow of death but it's the love
[1:02:31] of God letting you know that there's a
[1:02:34] character that is going to be expressed
[1:02:36] one day you might be in the Lion's Den
[1:02:39] you're my being in the fiery furnace but
[1:02:42] God hasn't left you he's building a
[1:02:44] character that is fit to rule
[1:02:47] how joy in the trial have praise and the
[1:02:50] suffering have have something that is of
[1:02:52] character in the hard times God hasn't
[1:02:55] forgot about you it's his wisdom and his
[1:02:58] love that he's sending you through that
[1:03:00] oh my James 1 and 2 my brother and
[1:03:03] counted all joy when you fall into
[1:03:06] diverse Temptations diverse means more
[1:03:09] than one Temptations is Trials you see
[1:03:12] we fail to see the end product of many
[1:03:14] times when before we forget to count it
[1:03:17] all joy because all we share is the
[1:03:20] trials but if we can just see what the
[1:03:23] Apostle Paul saw then we can have Joy
[1:03:25] inside of the trial the Apostle Paul
[1:03:28] says these present sufferings are not
[1:03:31] worthy to be compared to what I'm going
[1:03:33] to gain from it the Apostle Paul knew
[1:03:36] every suffering that he went through was
[1:03:38] a building came up to Roar every
[1:03:40] suffering every trial every heartbreak
[1:03:43] he went through Christ was starting to
[1:03:45] reflect inside of him self through every
[1:03:48] trial and through every hard time Christ
[1:03:50] is seeing himself inside of you a
[1:03:53] e-cigar and greater and greater and
[1:03:55] greater oh hallelujah what brought on
[1:03:58] the image of Christ inside of the fiery
[1:04:01] furnace it was them going through the
[1:04:03] suffering and the King that threw them
[1:04:06] in the suffering turned and says who's
[1:04:08] the fourth man in the fire who's that it
[1:04:11] looks like the Son of God while brought
[1:04:14] on the image oh Hallelujah of the Son of
[1:04:17] God it was the suffering come on

[1:04:24] furnace inside of a god-forsaken land it
[1:04:28] was somebody having joy in the midst of
[1:04:31] the suffering and that's what brings God
[1:04:33] in the middle of laodicea for the world
[1:04:36] to see is somebody having joy in the
[1:04:40] midst of the suffering in the midst of
[1:04:42] the pain you're still reflecting love in

[1:05:03] midst of the suffering oh Hallelujah
[1:05:06] that expresses God more than than your
[1:05:09] testimony it's whenever you're in the
[1:05:11] suffering and still expressing the love
[1:05:14] of God
[1:05:15] oh come on now that expresses God the
[1:05:18] more you remember I know I know this
[1:05:20] this story is told many times remember
[1:05:22] when brother Branham lost his daughter
[1:05:24] and lost his wife his first wife uh the
[1:05:27] the critic come up to brother Branham he
[1:05:29] says Billy I've seen you pray hell no
[1:05:32] I've seen you work all day then go to
[1:05:34] the street corners and preach all night
[1:05:36] then go right back to work and come back
[1:05:38] and preach again he says I've seen you
[1:05:40] do this time after time after time you
[1:05:43] go and visit people that are discouraged
[1:05:45] and sick and here God has taken your
[1:05:48] loved one away he's taken your daughter
[1:05:49] away he's taken your your your wife away
[1:05:52] what do you think of God now and in the
[1:05:55] midst of the suffering God's character
[1:05:58] started to express itself and says he's
[1:06:01] still the same he is still faithful and
[1:06:04] what did the critics say oh you've kept
[1:06:06] your religion huh he says no my religion
[1:06:09] has kept me the character that was on
[1:06:12] the inside was blossoming and blooming
[1:06:15] oh Hallelujah you don't gotta get you
[1:06:18] don't gotta get hated or hatred inside
[1:06:20] of the trial you don't gotta curse God
[1:06:22] inside of the suffering but you can
[1:06:25] express the love of God that even the
[1:06:27] Lions can feel oh my the Lions inside of
[1:06:30] the den with Daniel started to fill the
[1:06:33] character of God you notice you notice
[1:06:35] brother Branham says the Adam and the
[1:06:37] beginning was petting Leo the Lion but
[1:06:40] after the fall he was running from the
[1:06:42] lion what was Daniel doing in the Lion's
[1:06:45] Den
[1:06:46] he was expressing the character that
[1:06:49] Adam had come out somebody in the midst
[1:06:52] of the fiercest Lions they had to
[1:06:54] realize this is God's character on Earth
[1:06:58] oh my they could not they was realizing
[1:07:02] that the champ the same love the same
[1:07:04] character that Adam had in the beginning
[1:07:06] this a man is expressing in the midst of
[1:07:09] hatred in the midst of chaos he's
[1:07:12] expressing a character like it under
[1:07:14] Gods like thunder or maker you see so
[1:07:17] God is wanting an image on Earth that in
[1:07:20] the tough times it's Jesus in the good
[1:07:22] times it's Jesus on the Mountaintop in
[1:07:24] The Valleys it's Jesus and it's only
[1:07:27] through the character of Christ can we
[1:07:29] reflect reflect Christ in every pressure
[1:07:33] you see when did Jesus ministry start it
[1:07:36] was right after the Temptations in the
[1:07:38] wilderness but you notice he was
[1:07:40] equipped to press Through The
[1:07:42] Temptations because the Bible says that
[1:07:45] he went he was baptized by John and the
[1:07:47] Spirit come like an unto a dove and says
[1:07:49] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:07:52] pleased to dwell and what happened right
[1:07:54] after the the Holy Ghost rested upon him
[1:07:57] the Bible says the the spirits let him
[1:08:00] into the Wilderness how come his
[1:08:03] ministry was about to start and in order
[1:08:06] for him to fulfill his ministry he had
[1:08:09] to gain character oh come on now he had
[1:08:13] to gain character so that he can rule in
[1:08:16] his administrate and so the Bible says
[1:08:19] the spirit of the Lord led him into the
[1:08:21] Wilderness to be tempted so he wasn't by
[1:08:24] himself but he was led by the anchor oh
[1:08:28] come on now you don't go to the Valley
[1:08:30] of the shadow of death by yourself how
[1:08:32] come you don't fear no evil because the
[1:08:34] anchor is the one leading you through it
[1:08:37] so that you can obtain the character
[1:08:39] Jesus didn't heal one body he didn't
[1:08:42] open one blinded eye unclog one deaf ear
[1:08:45] until after the Temptation him the
[1:08:48] Wilderness and what happened right after
[1:08:50] the Wilderness the Bible says he started
[1:08:54] to preach the Kingdom of Heaven it's an
[1:08:56] eye what puts him in the position to
[1:09:00] fulfill his administrator the character
[1:09:02] building times through the suffering oh
[1:09:05] come on now you may say I don't got a
[1:09:07] Ministry I'm not a preacher I'm not a
[1:09:10] prophet I'm not this you don't need to
[1:09:12] be a preacher to be had to have a
[1:09:15] Ministry you see what it was Stephen
[1:09:17] that was not a preacher but here's a
[1:09:19] Ministry reflected the character of
[1:09:22] Christ even in the midst of the
[1:09:25] suffering how did the Apostle Paul get
[1:09:27] saved it was by the character of Christ
[1:09:30] being shown through Stephen he wasn't a
[1:09:33] preacher but it was somebody with the
[1:09:35] ministry that was expressing the
[1:09:38] character of Christ oh Hallelujah you
[1:09:41] don't got to be a preacher you don't got
[1:09:43] to be a singer you don't got to be a
[1:09:45] deacon but all you need is the character
[1:09:47] of Christ to express the character to
[1:09:51] the lost and Dying World it can be the
[1:09:53] hardest of Sinners the ones that's
[1:09:55] Addicted by the biggest and strongest of
[1:09:58] drugs that you can set free it's because
[1:10:01] of a character that has been obtained
[1:10:04] through suffering
[1:10:06] oh come on somebody it's a character
[1:10:09] that is reaching out to the lost and
[1:10:12] Dying World you see so the devil don't
[1:10:14] pull fast ones upon God every time you
[1:10:17] feel like you're at your weakest moment
[1:10:19] and the devil's bombarding your mind
[1:10:21] God's allowed it to build a character
[1:10:23] you see you notice what happened right
[1:10:26] after that Jesus won the victory you
[1:10:29] look at Matthew 4 and 11 then the devil
[1:10:31] leaveth him and behold Angels Came and
[1:10:34] ministered unto him
[1:10:36] so you notice what if Jesus would have
[1:10:40] been obeying his own will whenever the
[1:10:42] devil says jump from this Pinnacle and
[1:10:45] the angels will catch you because the
[1:10:48] Angels were there follow me now the
[1:10:50] Angels was there because the Bible says
[1:10:53] they came and ministered so I'm sure
[1:10:55] that he had the same thoughts that we
[1:10:57] have how many have the thoughts whenever
[1:10:59] you're being tempted you're being tried
[1:11:01] and you're going through a struggle and
[1:11:03] the devil says just give in and you will
[1:11:06] get rid of this suffering just give in
[1:11:08] and the heartache will go just give in
[1:11:10] and this will go I'm sure that Jesus
[1:11:13] have the same thoughts just give in and
[1:11:16] jump and these angels will catch me but
[1:11:19] in the midst of the suffering he knew he
[1:11:22] needed the character oh come on now in
[1:11:25] all points he was tempted like you were
[1:11:28] tempted but without sin there was a
[1:11:31] promise to you to know that the same
[1:11:34] thing the bra or the same power the bra
[1:11:37] Christ through the Temptation through
[1:11:39] the Wilderness through the suffering is
[1:11:42] the same power that can pull me through
[1:11:45] every suffering through every season
[1:11:47] through every trial
[1:11:49] Hallelujah it was in the wilderness
[1:11:51] season that the Angels come and
[1:11:53] ministered to Jesus come on now it was
[1:11:56] in the wilderness season that the
[1:11:58] ministers come or that thy Angels come
[1:12:00] and minister to Jesus and it's in your
[1:12:03] Wilderness season that the angels are
[1:12:06] going to come and minister to you you
[1:12:08] see where would Jesus ministry had been
[1:12:11] if he gave into the pressure what if he
[1:12:14] would have gave into the pressure and
[1:12:16] followed what he was wanting to do or
[1:12:18] what the devil was wanting him to do he
[1:12:20] wouldn't have obtained the character
[1:12:22] that he was gaining through that trial
[1:12:24] oh my you so while we Express in the
[1:12:28] wilderness season is going to determine
[1:12:31] or ministering what is going to
[1:12:33] determine the outcome of the Wilderness
[1:12:36] you notice it was right after the
[1:12:38] Wilderness that Jesus preaches the
[1:12:41] Sermon on the Mount and I'm sure that
[1:12:43] there was many people that were sitting
[1:12:45] there thinking my what a wonderful
[1:12:47] sermon this is powerful this is great
[1:12:50] but they didn't realize the suffering he
[1:12:53] had to go through to get that sermon
[1:12:55] come on somebody he had just come
[1:12:57] through suffering it was by the
[1:12:59] suffering that he could preach The
[1:13:01] Sermon on the Mount and it's through
[1:13:03] your suffering that you can preach God
[1:13:06] that you can preach a Grace and love to
[1:13:09] a lost and Dying World you see every
[1:13:11] preacher that we look at and admire they
[1:13:14] didn't get there by accident they had to
[1:13:16] go through the Wilderness Seasons you
[1:13:18] look at Ron Spencer a great warrior of
[1:13:21] Faith it's somebody that is standing
[1:13:22] against the odds but he didn't get that
[1:13:25] way by accident he had to go through the
[1:13:28] Wilderness Seasons he had to go he he
[1:13:30] had he fell off a roof multiple times
[1:13:32] he's broke his back multiple times he's
[1:13:35] been through a fire he's been through
[1:13:36] these hard times but it was through the
[1:13:39] sufferings that he can stand as a
[1:13:41] general and letting you know even though
[1:13:43] I've got cancer I'm still going to
[1:13:46] preach the God heals the body
[1:13:49] come on somebody what is it he's been
[1:13:51] through some sufferings that's brought
[1:13:53] on a character that he can let the world
[1:13:56] know that he is still the god that
[1:13:59] healeth all diseases he's still by your
[1:14:01] stripes he still heals even though he's
[1:14:04] in the suffering hope you're catching up
[1:14:06] this morning even in the suffering he's
[1:14:09] still expressing the character of God oh
[1:14:14] my you know we we look at brother Morrow
[1:14:16] and sister Leah they're like solid rocks
[1:14:18] but they didn't get there by accident it
[1:14:21] was through some suffering that they
[1:14:22] went through and it was your response in
[1:14:25] that suffering that is determining good
[1:14:28] Ministry now one of few would have
[1:14:30] turned away and become bitter at God and
[1:14:32] said you took my son you took him too
[1:14:34] early I'm gonna hate you I'm gonna be
[1:14:37] bitter but no in the midst of the
[1:14:39] suffering they express the christ-like
[1:14:42] character so that they can let you know
[1:14:45] that in the midst of the Suffering The
[1:14:47] Angels administer to us in the Dark
[1:14:50] Knights the Angels administered to us in
[1:14:52] the lonely times the Angels minister to
[1:14:55] us it was their response in the
[1:14:59] suffering that has produced their
[1:15:01] Ministry come on somebody it's your
[1:15:03] response him the suffering that is
[1:15:06] producing a powerful Ministry you might
[1:15:10] never get up behind the pulpit and
[1:15:12] preach you might never get up and sing a
[1:15:15] song or be a deacon but your ministry is
[1:15:18] just as powerful as every preacher that
[1:15:21] is on the earth just as powerful your
[1:15:23] ministry is so powerful that you can
[1:15:26] reach people that the preachers can't
[1:15:28] reach you can reach people that the
[1:15:30] prophet couldn't reach you can reach
[1:15:32] people that the deacons can't reach it's
[1:15:35] because of the suffering it's because of
[1:15:37] the suffering that's brought on a
[1:15:39] character
[1:15:42] oh it's the suffering that's brought on
[1:15:44] the character for you to express God oh
[1:15:48] man the same angels that minister to
[1:15:51] Jesus in the wilderness was the same
[1:15:53] angels that minister to Elijah you know
[1:15:56] brother Branham dramatizes it he says I
[1:15:58] want the surface that they're the angel
[1:16:00] with the softest hands to go down I want
[1:16:03] you to rub his brow I want you to stroke
[1:16:05] his hair he's at a hard place right now
[1:16:07] he's in the suffering but he sent
[1:16:09] ministering angels in the midst of the
[1:16:12] suffering to encourage him it was the
[1:16:15] same angels that were surrounding Elisha
[1:16:17] and his servant whenever they were
[1:16:19] surrounded by the by the by the armies
[1:16:22] and it looked hopeless and what's the
[1:16:24] bible say that Elisha says Lord open
[1:16:26] this Poor Man's eyes and whenever his
[1:16:29] eyes come open he's seen Chariots of
[1:16:31] Fire surrounding him what was it it was
[1:16:34] a ministering angels in the midst of the
[1:16:37] suffering God hasn't left you by
[1:16:39] yourself there's a ministering Angels
[1:16:41] every step of the player now speaking
[1:16:43] encouragement how did you get through
[1:16:45] the hard times how did you get through
[1:16:47] the heart breaks it was the ministering
[1:16:49] angels that brought you each step of the
[1:16:52] way you shouldn't be here this morning
[1:16:54] you should be and Billy Joe you should
[1:16:56] be in a ditch somewhere with drugs and
[1:16:58] alcohol but it was a ministering angels
[1:17:01] that was in the suffering the pressure
[1:17:03] through we all have testimonies that we
[1:17:06] can tell and say I shouldn't be here I
[1:17:08] should be backslid I should be bitter I
[1:17:11] should be off somewhere else but it was
[1:17:13] the ministering angels in the midst of
[1:17:16] the suffering that has brought you
[1:17:18] through so you can stand today with the
[1:17:21] character
[1:17:22] say no matter what you go through God
[1:17:24] can bring you through no matter the
[1:17:26] Heartbreak God can bring you through no
[1:17:29] matter the trials God can bring you
[1:17:31] through it was the suffering that has
[1:17:33] brought on the character oh my hey was
[1:17:37] my greatest heartbreak the struck a fire
[1:17:39] on the inside of me it was the suffering
[1:17:42] that God brought on a character like
[1:17:45] never before Oh Hallelujah but how you
[1:17:48] respond determines your outcome you look
[1:17:51] at Matthew 11 and 6 blessed is he
[1:17:54] whosoever shall not be offended in me he
[1:17:57] is saying not being offended in
[1:17:59] everybody else but being offended in me
[1:18:03] and brother Branham says this oh my
[1:18:05] blessed is he who is not offended in me
[1:18:08] now don't be offended I believe there's
[1:18:10] more people offended in Jesus than any
[1:18:13] other person that has ever lived on
[1:18:15] earth they get offended too quick Jesus
[1:18:18] now in this misplaced me attitude slip
[1:18:22] over there so that we can get it tonight
[1:18:24] excuse me he says blessed is he who was
[1:18:27] not offended in me don't be offended in
[1:18:30] me no matter what takes place everything
[1:18:33] is working right on schedule so just go
[1:18:36] ahead and believe it everything is all
[1:18:39] right just go ahead and believe it oh my
[1:18:43] soul how come we can't get offended at
[1:18:46] God because whenever we get offended
[1:18:48] that's somebody we start to treat them
[1:18:50] different we start to think about them
[1:18:52] different we don't we don't trust them
[1:18:54] anymore that's the same thing that
[1:18:57] happens to God when we become offended
[1:18:59] how God our trust has broken we can't
[1:19:03] believe his word anymore we can't pray
[1:19:05] anymore we can't listen to the messages
[1:19:07] anymore what was it we've become
[1:19:10] offended at God but he is saying here
[1:19:13] blessed is he who is not offended you
[1:19:16] may say brother Josh He said hopeless
[1:19:18] it's not hopeless the word is here to
[1:19:21] break that offense because you notice he
[1:19:24] is speaking talking this how about John
[1:19:25] the Baptist it was John the Baptist the
[1:19:28] forerun the first coming of Christ he
[1:19:31] had baptized Jesus in the Jordan River
[1:19:33] he was there when the dove come down and
[1:19:36] ascended or descended upon Christ but
[1:19:39] now he's in a jail cell now he's in a
[1:19:42] dark place and now he's getting offenses
[1:19:44] because of the suffering he's responding
[1:19:47] wrote oh just follow me for a second
[1:19:50] he's responding growing in the suffering
[1:19:53] so what's the Bible say the Bible says
[1:19:55] he sent his disciples to Jesus and say
[1:19:58] are you the one or are we to look after
[1:20:01] another well the Branham says John the
[1:20:04] Baptist seeing the Messiah sign he had
[1:20:07] seen the Vindication of Jesus but
[1:20:10] because of the because of the offense he
[1:20:13] is now looking at Jesus in a different
[1:20:16] way oh my you may have been on fire 20
[1:20:18] years ago you might have been in love
[1:20:20] with this message but because of
[1:20:22] offenses maybe you're looking at the
[1:20:24] word in a different way but it's not
[1:20:27] over blessed is he was not offended
[1:20:29] there's a word this morning that can
[1:20:32] break that offense because how did Jesus
[1:20:35] respond to that offense Jesus he tells
[1:20:38] the disciples you know brother Branham
[1:20:40] says he didn't say here give here's some
[1:20:42] literature go tell John how to be happy
[1:20:45] in the jail cell tell John how to be
[1:20:47] happy in the prison Jesus didn't say any
[1:20:50] of that but what Jesus did say was come
[1:20:53] to my meeting tonight and watch the word
[1:20:56] manifested and he tells the disciples go
[1:20:59] tell John that the blind sea that the
[1:21:02] lame walk that the poor have the
[1:21:05] minister have preaching to them what was
[1:21:08] it it was scripture back in Isaiah I
[1:21:10] believe that was being manifested so it
[1:21:14] was the manifested word that broke the
[1:21:16] offense off of John oh come on somebody
[1:21:19] you may be sitting in a hard time saying
[1:21:23] I don't I don't think I can believe this
[1:21:24] message anymore there's too many doubts
[1:21:26] I've been through too many sufferings
[1:21:28] and if you might got some offenses this
[1:21:30] morning but the word is here it's a
[1:21:32] break off every offense it's here so
[1:21:35] that you can love again you can praise
[1:21:37] again maybe you've lost your joy maybe
[1:21:40] you've lost your worship maybe you've
[1:21:42] lost your praise because of the
[1:21:44] suffering but there's some morning
[1:21:45] there's a word that is Sam blessed is
[1:21:48] here who is not offended you don't gotta
[1:21:51] say it in that offense you don't got to
[1:21:53] stay in that in my hard time but get out
[1:21:56] of that offense and see Christ like he's
[1:21:59] meant to be seen he's still the same
[1:22:02] yesterday today and forever he's still
[1:22:04] the friend the sticketh closer than a
[1:22:07] brother he is still with you in the
[1:22:09] Valley of the shadow of death you just
[1:22:11] need to see him again you just need to
[1:22:14] seek him the same way oh my it's not the
[1:22:17] God has changed but the way you see God
[1:22:20] Has Changed come on somebody God's still
[1:22:23] God is still right there there but if
[1:22:25] you don't see him as the friend that
[1:22:27] sticketh closer than a brother how can
[1:22:30] he be a friend let's sticketh closer
[1:22:32] than a brother you've got to allow him
[1:22:35] to be that friend you've got to allow
[1:22:37] him to be the healer of all diseases and
[1:22:41] because of the fences we keep him from
[1:22:44] being that to us but if we can get away
[1:22:47] from all of the offenses he can be that
[1:22:50] friend that he wants to be he don't want
[1:22:52] you to be by yourself in the suffering
[1:22:55] he don't want you to be by yourself in
[1:22:58] the wilderness season he wants to
[1:23:00] express himself but first you got to get
[1:23:04] rid of the offenses
[1:23:06] oh my you've got to get rid of now it's
[1:23:09] not offenses towards the brother and the
[1:23:11] sister you need to get rid of those two
[1:23:13] but I'm talking about doubts I'm talking
[1:23:15] about defenses though we get towards God
[1:23:18] God why if you left me here why don't
[1:23:20] you hear my prayer anymore why don't I
[1:23:22] feel your presence anymore we all get
[1:23:25] there we're not all Saints we have been
[1:23:27] I've been offended Our God but I also
[1:23:29] know what it's like for the word to come
[1:23:31] across my path and it breaks that
[1:23:33] offense and I can walk out of that
[1:23:36] offense and praise God like never before
[1:23:39] you want your joy back break out of that
[1:23:41] offense you want your worship back break
[1:23:44] out of that offense you want your joy
[1:23:46] back and your peace back your
[1:23:48] long-suffering back you want to love
[1:23:50] people again get out of that offense and
[1:23:53] love people like I hey uh Kobe and Caleb
[1:23:57] can testify as the pastor's kid you see
[1:23:59] a lot you see how your dad gets batter
[1:24:01] or baby gets beat up he gets he gets
[1:24:04] cursed out I've seen him cussed to his
[1:24:06] face right there somebody claiming to be
[1:24:08] a Christian I've seen those things and
[1:24:11] you know what Dallas always told us he
[1:24:13] says if you become bitter you can never
[1:24:15] love anybody and that is something that
[1:24:18] has stuck with me because I have become
[1:24:20] bitter I'd become bitter where I didn't
[1:24:23] love anybody anymore I couldn't look at
[1:24:25] the good at people anymore and I was at
[1:24:28] a hard spot because I had become
[1:24:30] offended at God but the same word that
[1:24:33] broke John out of his offense was the
[1:24:36] same word that brought me out of my
[1:24:39] offense and it's the same word that can
[1:24:41] print you out of every offense that you
[1:24:44] go through you may say brother Josh I
[1:24:47] went to the deepest of the trial and it
[1:24:49] didn't feel like God was Smith me get
[1:24:51] out of the offense
[1:24:53] get out of it
[1:24:54] for the same God is on Earth
[1:24:57] he's just he's sitting there waiting for
[1:24:59] you to see him brother Branham says John
[1:25:01] the Baptist eagles eye was filmed over
[1:25:04] Sir John Jesus was still there the word
[1:25:07] was still there but because his eyes was
[1:25:09] filmed over he couldn't see it
[1:25:12] yeah oh but it was the word
[1:25:14] that that took the film off of his eyes
[1:25:16] so that he could see the word made flesh
[1:25:19] brother Branham says that the devil is
[1:25:21] trying to get John to disbelief he was
[1:25:23] the Messiah you may say how's that even
[1:25:26] possible he was John that says Behold
[1:25:28] the Lamb of God the take away the sins
[1:25:31] of the world he was human
[1:25:34] he was human just like you as human you
[1:25:37] must say how could John the Baptist do
[1:25:38] that he saw the Messiah because of the
[1:25:41] suffering and how he responded him the
[1:25:44] suffering I believe he did the that God
[1:25:46] allowed that to happen so that you won't
[1:25:48] feel hopeless if John the Baptist went
[1:25:50] through offenses and if you go through
[1:25:53] it it's not over you can come out just
[1:25:55] like John did
[1:25:57] oh my look at Matthew 11 and 4. Jesus
[1:26:00] answered and said unto them go show John
[1:26:02] again again you notice how he says that
[1:26:05] again in other words he has seen these
[1:26:08] before this is what caused him to
[1:26:10] believe in the first place I'm going to
[1:26:12] show him the same things to break him
[1:26:15] out of those offenses Go and show John
[1:26:17] again these things which you do hear and
[1:26:19] see the blind receive their sights the
[1:26:22] lame walk the lepers are cleansed the
[1:26:24] death here the dead are raised up the
[1:26:26] Dead the poor have the gospel preached
[1:26:28] to them
[1:26:29] what was it he was letting John know I'm
[1:26:32] right on schedule but the Branham says
[1:26:34] this go tell John the lame walk the
[1:26:35] blinds see the deaf here all that comes
[1:26:37] to the meeting is poor the Poor's got
[1:26:39] the gospel preached to him tell John not
[1:26:42] to be scared not to think anything
[1:26:44] different I am right on schedule
[1:26:46] everything's running right everything's
[1:26:49] all right I'm right on schedule tell him
[1:26:51] there's a healing service going on the
[1:26:53] gospel has got the the Poor's got the
[1:26:55] gospel preached the power of God is
[1:26:57] moving among them I'm right on schedule
[1:26:59] don't pay any attention to nothing else
[1:27:02] I'm right on schedule
[1:27:04] don't pay attention to anything else I'm
[1:27:07] right on schedule
[1:27:09] and let me tell you this morning don't
[1:27:11] pay attention to anything else he's
[1:27:13] right on schedule he's right on schedule
[1:27:16] he's right there you may feel like
[1:27:18] you're about to step into the fiery
[1:27:20] furnace he's right on schedule
[1:27:23] right on schedule but you notice notice
[1:27:26] how Jesus responds to the offense
[1:27:29] you notice how we respond and so Jesus
[1:27:32] is offended John is offended of Jesus
[1:27:36] but look what Jesus says in Matthew 11
[1:27:38] and 7 and they departed and Jesus began
[1:27:41] to say it to the multitudes concerning
[1:27:43] John why went ye out into the Wilderness
[1:27:46] to see a reed shaken with the wind but
[1:27:48] why you went out to forth to see a man
[1:27:50] clothed in South Raymond behold they
[1:27:53] though wear soft clothing are in King's
[1:27:54] houses but what went ye out to see a
[1:27:57] prophet yea I say unto you more than a
[1:28:00] prophet for this is he of whom it is
[1:28:03] written behold I send my messenger
[1:28:05] before my face which shall which shall
[1:28:09] prepare the way before thee what was
[1:28:12] John do and what was Jesus doing in the
[1:28:15] midst of John's offense he was quoting
[1:28:18] scripture concerning him
[1:28:20] come on somebody he's not going to leave
[1:28:23] you hopeless he's letting you know
[1:28:25] you've got promises concerning your life
[1:28:28] if you can get out of the offense you
[1:28:31] can fulfill the promises that you're
[1:28:34] meant to fulfill and verily I say unto
[1:28:37] you among them that are born of women
[1:28:39] there hath not risen greater than John
[1:28:41] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:28:44] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he he
[1:28:47] is responding in a way that even though
[1:28:49] he was offended he was still lifting up
[1:28:52] John
[1:28:54] hmm Hallelujah
[1:28:56] he may feel like offenses are going to
[1:28:58] take you over but God is still lifting
[1:29:00] you up he's still quoting his promise
[1:29:03] he's there's still a word here letting
[1:29:05] you know you're not Forsaken and he's
[1:29:07] right on schedule nothing is out of
[1:29:09] cater brother Branham says God Know Thee
[1:29:11] again from the beginning therefore he
[1:29:13] could plan everything that would work
[1:29:14] out just for his glory and that gives us
[1:29:17] courage to Noah no matter what comes or
[1:29:19] what goes God is making everything the
[1:29:22] time clock is ticking exactly on time he
[1:29:25] says sometimes we get upset we get
[1:29:27] hastily we think oh we must go and do
[1:29:30] this or that but remember God's time
[1:29:32] clock will be just exactly on time
[1:29:36] God's time clock will be exactly on time
[1:29:39] the Bible says in Isaiah 46 and 9
[1:29:42] remember the former things of old for I
[1:29:44] am God and there was none else I am God
[1:29:47] and there was none like like me
[1:29:49] declaring the yin from the beginning
[1:29:50] from ancient times the things that are
[1:29:53] not yet done saying my counsel shall
[1:29:55] stand and I will do all my pleasure he
[1:29:59] know he declares the end from the
[1:30:01] beginning from ancient times from times
[1:30:03] that are not yet done and you think that
[1:30:06] God has forsaken you you're engraved in
[1:30:09] the palm of his hand he can't forget you
[1:30:11] in order for him to forget you he has to
[1:30:14] lose his strength what is his right hand
[1:30:16] the Bible declares that his right hand
[1:30:18] is his strength it's scripture after
[1:30:20] scripture so in order for him to forget
[1:30:23] about you he's got to lose his strength
[1:30:25] he's got to lose his power and God is
[1:30:28] never going to lose his power he's never
[1:30:30] going to lose his authority so that
[1:30:33] means even though you're in the
[1:30:34] suffering he's not going to lose you
[1:30:36] even though you're in the wilderness
[1:30:38] time he has not forgotten about you
[1:30:40] you're a part of him
[1:30:42] in order to forget about you he's got to
[1:30:44] forget about himself and how can he
[1:30:46] forget about himself he's never going to
[1:30:49] forget about you
[1:30:50] such a place of Courage on the inside
[1:30:52] that God knows exactly what I'm going
[1:30:55] through this one may forsake me this one
[1:30:57] may turn against me I might be going
[1:30:59] through hard times but God is right
[1:31:01] there and I refused I refuse to be
[1:31:04] offended at him I refuse to be offended
[1:31:07] at his word I know the pressure is
[1:31:09] coming at me we're living in the day of
[1:31:11] pressure but the Brandon preaches will
[1:31:12] find messages on pressure and he says
[1:31:15] this is this is pressure it's coming
[1:31:17] after everybody coming after children
[1:31:19] coming after couples that's coming after
[1:31:21] the families it's a pressure that the
[1:31:24] devil is trying to use to admire your
[1:31:26] character but you can withstand the
[1:31:28] pressure you see what happens when the
[1:31:31] pressure comes against you how does
[1:31:33] somebody lose their temper it's not
[1:31:35] something that they lose right away or
[1:31:37] most people don't some people do but
[1:31:39] what how do how does that call how do
[1:31:41] people lose their temper it's not by one
[1:31:43] thing happening but it's something
[1:31:45] that's built up it's built up it's built
[1:31:47] up the pressure has built up it's built
[1:31:50] up until you finally explode it didn't
[1:31:53] happen right away and that's what is
[1:31:55] happening here in Lake odessia pressure
[1:31:58] has been building up through the first
[1:32:00] church age the second Church age the
[1:32:02] Third Church age and here we are in the
[1:32:05] seventh Church age and that pressure is
[1:32:08] coming so hard where it feels like we're
[1:32:10] going to lose our mind where it feels
[1:32:12] like we can't think straight but we've
[1:32:14] been called to stand in this evil age
[1:32:17] we're not standing in our own ability
[1:32:20] we've got the strength of the Lord that
[1:32:22] as we're standing every pressure we're
[1:32:25] going to come out with our character
[1:32:27] intact or character and being marred or
[1:32:31] a character ain't being destroyed but
[1:32:33] we're going to come through this most
[1:32:35] evil age with our character what a
[1:32:38] brother Branham saying look God's coming
[1:32:39] after character he says you're going to
[1:32:42] lose everything else but what's going
[1:32:44] with you is your character
[1:32:49] means for evil God is turning around for
[1:32:52] good so the pressure that the devil is
[1:32:55] using to try to destroy your character
[1:32:57] God is using to build up your character
[1:33:01] that's why the Bible says Rejoice that
[1:33:04] you are partakers of the sufferings of
[1:33:07] Christ because what the devil meant for
[1:33:09] evil God has turned around and is making
[1:33:12] it good
[1:33:14] there's pressure remember the story of
[1:33:17] the rifle the blue mother branham's face
[1:33:19] he had a model of 70 Winchester rifle I
[1:33:22] believe and then somebody was going to
[1:33:24] report it and convert it into a
[1:33:26] Weatherby Magnum 257. I believe that's
[1:33:29] one of us and he says when brother
[1:33:31] Branham went to shoot it they didn't
[1:33:33] reboil it right and so there was some
[1:33:35] air or some pressure behind the cap I
[1:33:38] believe what it was and so whenever he
[1:33:40] shot the rifle the rifle had too much
[1:33:42] pressure and it exploded he says the the
[1:33:45] barrel went up it went up 50 yards the
[1:33:48] scope went flying behind him and blew up
[1:33:50] the boat went flying one way he says he
[1:33:53] was bleeding everywhere he says the
[1:33:55] doctor looked at him and says the only
[1:33:57] way you're still alive is because God
[1:33:59] was standing by his servant but he says
[1:34:01] one cause that to happen he says
[1:34:04] pressure he says it was pressure inside
[1:34:07] of that rifle the constant to blow up
[1:34:10] and he says none of us what's happening
[1:34:12] instead of laodicea it's pressure he
[1:34:15] says what is that what is the devil
[1:34:17] trying to do he's trying to blow up
[1:34:19] families by pressure I'm preaching now
[1:34:23] the devil is trying through pressure to
[1:34:25] get you to buckle and explode but the
[1:34:28] devil has no right to cause you to
[1:34:31] explode unless you give it to him but if
[1:34:34] you can stand against the pressure
[1:34:36] there's nothing that the devil can do
[1:34:39] tomorrow your character oh my look at
[1:34:42] Matthew 5 and 10 blessed are they which
[1:34:45] are persecuted for righteousness sake
[1:34:48] for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven So
[1:34:51] when you say it here those that are
[1:34:53] persecuted are going to gain the kingdom
[1:34:56] and the next verse blessed are ye when
[1:34:58] men shall revile you and persecute you
[1:35:01] and shall say o manner of evil against
[1:35:03] you for her against you falsely for my
[1:35:07] sake you may say well I don't feel a
[1:35:10] natural persecution but there is a
[1:35:12] spiritual persecution you noticed how he
[1:35:15] separates the two blessed are they which
[1:35:17] are persecuted for righteousness Sake
[1:35:20] One definition of righteousness is being
[1:35:23] right in the eyes of God including
[1:35:25] character so the spiritual persecution
[1:35:29] is coming after your character it might
[1:35:32] not be a natural persecution where
[1:35:34] you're being beaten you're being whipped
[1:35:36] you're being flawed but it is a
[1:35:38] spiritual persecution that is coming
[1:35:41] with pressure against your character
[1:35:44] come on somebody that's the pressures of
[1:35:46] the world you may say I don't think I
[1:35:49] can make it don't give in to the
[1:35:51] pressure the devil's trying to to marry
[1:35:54] your character brother random says this
[1:35:55] when John came he was Supernatural when
[1:35:59] Jesus came he was the Supernatural and
[1:36:02] the enemy on the fundamental side always
[1:36:04] persecuted the supernatural you see God
[1:36:07] you see what he's trying to do today the
[1:36:10] same thing so it might not be
[1:36:12] persecuting you naturally but he's
[1:36:15] coming against the supernatural
[1:36:17] character the goddess building on the
[1:36:20] inside but the Bible says rejoice in
[1:36:23] Matthew 5 and 12 rejoice and be
[1:36:25] exceeding glad for a great is your
[1:36:27] reward in heaven for so persecuted than
[1:36:30] the prophets which were before you you
[1:36:33] are the salt of the earth but if the
[1:36:36] salt has lost its savior where will
[1:36:38] shall it be salted it is thence for good
[1:36:41] for nothing but to be cast out and to be
[1:36:43] trodden under the foot of men so you'll
[1:36:47] notice how the Bible puts it there's two
[1:36:49] results that you're going to have inside
[1:36:52] of the same trial he says you can either
[1:36:55] be put into the kingdom or you're going
[1:36:57] to be trodden under the foot of man ye
[1:37:00] are the salts of the Earth but if the
[1:37:03] salt has lost its Savor what is Thy word
[1:37:05] Savor it's a characteristic and so the
[1:37:08] savior is the character of the salt so
[1:37:12] how you respond inside of the suffering
[1:37:15] determines if you're going to gain
[1:37:17] character or lose character hope you're
[1:37:20] following me this morning the character
[1:37:22] is either going to push you into the
[1:37:25] kingdom or losing your character is
[1:37:27] going to put you under the foot of a man
[1:37:30] but how you respond to it determines the
[1:37:33] outcome but then he says bless it or
[1:37:36] they that are persecuted for
[1:37:38] righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:37:40] kingdom he gave you a promise if you can
[1:37:43] just stand in the midst of the pressure
[1:37:46] there's a rule waiting for you there
[1:37:48] there's the kingdom waiting for you
[1:37:50] there's a throne waiting for you there's
[1:37:52] Authority waiting for you if you can
[1:37:55] just stand against the pressure stand
[1:37:58] against the persecution you see
[1:38:01] character is always shown through
[1:38:04] pressure it was the character of job
[1:38:06] when he was on the ash Heap that was
[1:38:08] expressed whenever he was at his darkest
[1:38:11] moment his friends turn against him his
[1:38:13] wife says curse God and die but his
[1:38:16] character started to express itself and
[1:38:19] say the Lord gives and the lord taketh
[1:38:21] away but Blessed Be Thy holy name it was
[1:38:25] that character that gave him a glimpse
[1:38:28] of this future what if he would have
[1:38:31] cursed God you think God would have
[1:38:33] spoke to him through the Thunders
[1:38:35] come on somebody if he would have cursed
[1:38:38] God like his wife said you think God
[1:38:40] would have lifted him up for him to see
[1:38:42] the Redeemer but it was because he
[1:38:45] stayed true in the suffering he stayed
[1:38:48] true in the wilderness season the god
[1:38:51] lifted him up and he can say I know my
[1:38:54] redeemer liveth what was it character
[1:38:57] lifted him up
[1:38:59] hallelujah it's your character that sees
[1:39:03] God as a friend that is with you and
[1:39:06] every child
[1:39:07] don't curse God in the suffering don't
[1:39:10] curse God in the wilderness that
[1:39:12] character Express gods
[1:39:16] Hallelujah nobody else seen the Redeemer
[1:39:18] he was standing there with his friends
[1:39:20] whom when that when the Thunder started
[1:39:23] started to ring out everybody else just
[1:39:26] heard the Thunder they just seen the
[1:39:28] lightning but the character of job heard
[1:39:30] something else
[1:39:32] come on somebody
[1:39:34] he refused to be offended in the midst
[1:39:38] of the suffering you know why you look
[1:39:40] at you look at Joseph he was the
[1:39:42] Suffering The put Joseph in the Kingdom
[1:39:46] how he responded to the suffering put
[1:39:49] him in the Kingdom you notice that his
[1:39:52] brother sowed him as a slave and he went
[1:39:54] in and he started to do some things he
[1:39:56] worked his way up the ladder and he was
[1:39:58] there with potiphar and you notice he's
[1:40:01] in the midst of the suffering on his way
[1:40:03] to the kingdom and then the Devil comes
[1:40:06] with pressure and how he responds to
[1:40:09] this pressure determines his ministry
[1:40:11] because you notice what happens it was
[1:40:14] Potiphar's wife the cometh to Joseph it
[1:40:17] says come lie with me it was pressure
[1:40:19] that was coming against Joseph but what
[1:40:23] happened is character prevailed what if
[1:40:26] he would have went and laid with it with
[1:40:28] Potiphar's wife he would have been
[1:40:30] killed once potiphar found out obviously
[1:40:33] so he could not fulfill his ministry
[1:40:36] that way come on now follow me but
[1:40:38] because his character stood strong in
[1:40:42] the midst of the pressure even though he
[1:40:44] went through some more suffering he went
[1:40:46] to the prison but it was because of the
[1:40:49] suffering that he ruled and second in
[1:40:52] command next to Pharaoh himself he was
[1:40:55] the one that was calling the shots
[1:40:57] during the payment how did he get there
[1:40:59] through suffering
[1:41:01] he didn't give up by accident but it was
[1:41:04] through suffering and his character
[1:41:07] remains even in the suffering
[1:41:12] what if he would have lost his character
[1:41:14] think about it what if he would have
[1:41:16] lost his character would Jesus been on
[1:41:18] Earth
[1:41:20] because his brothers would have died
[1:41:22] Joseph's brothers would have died
[1:41:24] because of the famine if Pharaoh if
[1:41:27] Joseph wasn't in command
[1:41:30] so think about that because he says that
[1:41:33] Joseph says if I can get it right what
[1:41:34] God meant for evil why man meant for
[1:41:36] evil God turned for good and he says I
[1:41:39] can't remember how he puts that but life
[1:41:41] was preserved because of this he wasn't
[1:41:44] speaking of his own life but the life of
[1:41:47] Jesus Jesus would not have come I
[1:41:50] believe it come through Judah he would
[1:41:52] not have come if Joseph's character
[1:41:54] would have been marred
[1:41:56] come on now better with his character
[1:41:59] prevailing in the persecution that
[1:42:02] brought life it's your character in The
[1:42:06] persecution that can bring life that can
[1:42:09] bring a sustaining power it was his
[1:42:12] character through the suffering that he
[1:42:14] can look at us brothers and say I
[1:42:16] forgive you
[1:42:17] hum Joseph it was character you can't
[1:42:21] love you you can't love somebody they'll
[1:42:24] persecute you without the character of
[1:42:25] Christ you can't do it it's impossible
[1:42:29] we look at the world they're full of
[1:42:31] hate because they've been done wrong but
[1:42:33] it was the character of God inside of
[1:42:36] Joseph that says I forgive you
[1:42:39] and not only come through the suffering
[1:42:42] I hope you're following catching it this
[1:42:44] morning this has been something that has
[1:42:45] been burning strong to me it comes
[1:42:47] through this suffering
[1:42:49] the love of God can be expressed if
[1:42:52] you're hating God in the suffering but
[1:42:54] it's the love of God can be expressed on
[1:42:56] the other side of the suffering
[1:42:59] but it's through the pressure that's
[1:43:01] getting us out here I'm gonna I got a
[1:43:02] few more points just bear with me you
[1:43:04] see what happened whenever the children
[1:43:06] of Israel was about to leave Egypt the
[1:43:09] pressure got stronger you notice now the
[1:43:11] pressure got stronger the Bible says the
[1:43:13] Pharaoh commanded the task Masters don't
[1:43:16] get the straw for them let them get
[1:43:18] their own straw and double their work
[1:43:20] for the for the day so now they've got
[1:43:22] to go
[1:43:23] the Bible says they was going throughout
[1:43:25] the land of Egypt getting straw for the
[1:43:28] bricks and they're going to make the
[1:43:30] same amount of bricks that they would be
[1:43:33] making if they had the straw for them
[1:43:35] and so now they've got to go get the
[1:43:38] straw and make the same amount of bricks
[1:43:40] for that day that's what Pharaoh said to
[1:43:43] do how come because it was time for
[1:43:45] Exodus the pressure was getting stronger
[1:43:48] you look at Genesis 15 and 13 and he
[1:43:51] said unto Abram know of a surety but thy
[1:43:55] seed shall be a stranger in a land that
[1:43:58] is not theirs and Shall Serve them and
[1:44:01] they shall afflict them for 400 years
[1:44:04] and also that Nation whom they Shall
[1:44:07] Serve will I judge afterward they shall
[1:44:10] come out with great substance you notice
[1:44:13] how the Bible says that he says they're
[1:44:15] going to go through some pressure but on
[1:44:18] the other side of the pressure they're
[1:44:20] not coming out empty-handed they're not
[1:44:22] coming out with nothing but they're
[1:44:24] coming out with great substance come on
[1:44:27] now we're not leaving this in this
[1:44:29] Exodus with nothing but you're coming
[1:44:32] out of it with great substance you're
[1:44:34] going to come out with your character
[1:44:36] you're going to come out fit to rule
[1:44:39] the pressure is shown the pressure's
[1:44:42] upon us but it's the character that's
[1:44:45] going to Prevail when the pressure is
[1:44:47] gone when the trials are gone when the
[1:44:49] sufferings are behind us and the
[1:44:52] Wilderness season is behind us only one
[1:44:55] thing is going to remain that is the
[1:44:57] character that was brought through the
[1:45:00] suffering
[1:45:02] God by Vision said there was going to be
[1:45:04] afflicted
[1:45:06] by a vision could you imagine that the
[1:45:08] word afflict means to be occupied
[1:45:10] oppressed to be put down they were
[1:45:12] pressured
[1:45:13] but they said we're not leaving a child
[1:45:15] behind
[1:45:16] who are not leaving a child behind the
[1:45:19] promise says we're coming God with great
[1:45:21] substance we're not leaving Family
[1:45:23] behind and that should make your
[1:45:25] altitude we're coming God with great
[1:45:27] substance I'm not leaving a hoof behind
[1:45:30] I'm not leaving my teenagers behind I'm
[1:45:33] not leaving my young daughters behind
[1:45:34] I'm not leaving my sons behind the
[1:45:37] promise is we're coming out with great
[1:45:39] substance all the how to do was
[1:45:42] withstand the pressure they had a
[1:45:44] prophet on the scene that come with the
[1:45:47] pillar of fire and a message so now they
[1:45:50] was in position for Exodus all they had
[1:45:53] to do was wait for the right time and
[1:45:55] withstand the pressure
[1:45:57] oh my the prophet was on the scene the
[1:46:01] God says I'm going to come down until
[1:46:03] and deliver them he shall Moses with the
[1:46:06] message the pillar of fire was
[1:46:08] vindicating that message not all they
[1:46:11] had to do was withstand the pressure oh
[1:46:13] and what did we get in this day we had a
[1:46:16] message that was Vindicated by the
[1:46:18] pillar of fire it's time for Exodus all
[1:46:21] you have to do is withstand the pressure
[1:46:24] don't give in to the pressure If you
[1:46:27] give in to the pressure The Exodus might
[1:46:29] happen but if you can withstand the
[1:46:31] pressure keep your staff in your hand
[1:46:33] your shoes on your feet it's time for
[1:46:36] Exodus don't give in to the pressure
[1:46:41] foreign
[1:46:42] it was because of the pressure they was
[1:46:44] under but they started to forget can you
[1:46:47] imagine I'm sure I went over there was
[1:46:49] first in in slavery they were probably
[1:46:51] having the promise in mind
[1:46:54] we're going to come out with great
[1:46:55] substance 100 years later we're going to
[1:46:58] come out with great substance 50 years
[1:46:59] later no the next generation is like man
[1:47:02] this is crazy this is a fairy tale
[1:47:04] there's no promise ain't doing nothing
[1:47:05] for us we're being beaten the same 200
[1:47:08] years later we're being beaten still I'm
[1:47:11] sure they might have started to forget
[1:47:12] about the promise of the great substance
[1:47:15] then all of a sudden 400 years went by
[1:47:17] and I'm sure there's multiple
[1:47:19] Generations now
[1:47:21] and could you imagine all of the elders
[1:47:24] saying it's time it's time it's time for
[1:47:27] great substance and I can see the Next
[1:47:29] Generation oh you're crazy man you've
[1:47:31] been believing this for 400 years we
[1:47:34] haven't seen nothing God's forsaken us
[1:47:36] they were becoming offended but what
[1:47:39] happened now it's come out of the
[1:47:40] Wilderness and I'll come out of the
[1:47:42] desert was a message
[1:47:44] but the message that broke off every
[1:47:47] offense
[1:47:48] we've been believable for a Rapture for
[1:47:50] years we've been believable for this
[1:47:52] Exodus for years we've been believing
[1:47:54] for this body change for years maybe
[1:47:56] you've become offended because it's
[1:47:58] taken so long but God sent the message
[1:48:01] John the Baptist Malachi 4 he sent the
[1:48:04] messenger to let you know the time is at
[1:48:08] hand it's time for great substance
[1:48:11] it's time for The Exodus we're not
[1:48:14] leaving a hoof behind when did the
[1:48:17] Supernatural come to the camp of the
[1:48:19] Israelites when the message came on the
[1:48:21] scene it was when the message come on
[1:48:23] the scene is when the Supernatural come
[1:48:26] on the scene that's when flies come last
[1:48:28] came water was turned in the blood the
[1:48:31] message brought the supernatural to
[1:48:34] restore the strength the restore the
[1:48:36] confidence in the promise and this
[1:48:39] message has brought the supernatural so
[1:48:42] that you can know that beyond a shadow
[1:48:45] of doubt that the promises of God are
[1:48:48] yea and a man that the supernatural can
[1:48:51] break off every offense it can break off
[1:48:54] every doubts it can break off every
[1:48:56] unbelief the message has brought the
[1:48:59] supernatural back into the camp
[1:49:02] but you notice remember how did they
[1:49:04] break this how do they break the
[1:49:06] offenses remember what did John tell
[1:49:08] Jesus or what did Jesus tell John he
[1:49:10] quoted the Fulfillment of scripture and
[1:49:13] that's what broke off the offenses off
[1:49:16] of John and why did Gia why did Moses do
[1:49:18] he come to Egypt quoting scripture that
[1:49:22] God gave to Abraham so he was he wasn't
[1:49:24] bringing a new message but he was
[1:49:27] bringing what was already there and
[1:49:30] using that for a Deliverance God didn't
[1:49:33] bring a new word in this day he took the
[1:49:36] original and he broke the seals off of
[1:49:39] it and says this is the delivering power
[1:49:42] to the church it's time for Exodus
[1:49:46] it's time for Exodus oh my just bear
[1:49:51] with me one one more one more uh one
[1:49:54] more Point remember the five thousand I
[1:49:56] was hungry remember this remember that's
[1:49:58] a simple story but you notice how did
[1:50:00] they get fed it was whenever Jesus
[1:50:03] brother Branham says that he says here
[1:50:05] he took the original five barley Loaves
[1:50:07] and they begin to break the Loaves and
[1:50:10] from the original He Made bread it fed 5
[1:50:14] 000. so what was the sustaining power
[1:50:17] against the pressure was when Jesus Took
[1:50:20] the original and he broke it he then a
[1:50:23] seated it brother random says he didn't
[1:50:25] create more bread he took the original
[1:50:27] and whenever he broke it when he broke
[1:50:30] it that brought forth a sustaining power
[1:50:33] and you notice how what how did this
[1:50:35] what was the chain of command you look
[1:50:37] at Matthew 14-19 and he commanded the
[1:50:40] multitude to sit down on the grass and
[1:50:43] he took Five Loaves and two fishes and
[1:50:45] looking up to Heaven blessed and he
[1:50:48] break and gave the loaves to his
[1:50:50] disciples and the disciples to the
[1:50:53] multitude so you see the process it was
[1:50:56] Jesus who broke the loaves then he gave
[1:50:59] it to the disciples then the disciples
[1:51:01] he gave it to the multitudes in my who
[1:51:04] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[1:51:07] the seals thereof when I looked hopeless
[1:51:10] when it was beyond hope to see the word
[1:51:13] John was weeping and he heard an outer
[1:51:15] say whip not John for the lion of the
[1:51:18] tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the
[1:51:22] book and loose the seals thereof and I
[1:51:26] saw another Mighty angel coming down
[1:51:28] from heaven with an open book so he did
[1:51:32] not create another word he took the
[1:51:35] original word and he broke it to know
[1:51:38] somebody he took the original word broke
[1:51:41] the seals off of and watched the Bible
[1:51:44] say he comes down to earth and now we
[1:51:47] are to go to the Earthly Angel and say
[1:51:50] give me the book just like Jesus he
[1:51:53] broke the bread then he gave it to the
[1:51:55] disciples then the multitude got the
[1:51:58] bread from the disciples the mighty
[1:52:01] Angel come to Earth with an open book
[1:52:04] that was opened up gave it to the
[1:52:07] seventh angel and says in the voice of
[1:52:09] the seventh angel when he begins the
[1:52:12] sound the mysteries of God shall be
[1:52:15] known then he commission and says go to
[1:52:17] the angel and take the open book out of
[1:52:21] his hand we've been commissioned to go
[1:52:24] to the original word and partake and
[1:52:27] that's what's going to withstand the
[1:52:30] pressure
[1:52:31] Hallelujah God's taken the original open
[1:52:35] the seals he didn't bring something new
[1:52:38] just like Moses then it brings something
[1:52:40] new he just broke off the offenses and
[1:52:43] says what the original has is still the
[1:52:46] same today it's the delivering power and
[1:52:49] what the book of Acts had is what we got
[1:52:52] today it's the original Power of
[1:52:54] Pentecost that is that is prevailing
[1:52:57] over every pressure is prevailing in
[1:53:00] every suffering it's prevailing in every
[1:53:03] Wilderness the original has come with
[1:53:07] the supernatural
[1:53:09] hallelujah it's the supernatural that is
[1:53:13] equipping you to stand against the
[1:53:15] pressure
[1:53:17] it was when Jesus broke the bread but
[1:53:19] the Supernatural come
[1:53:22] they said Jesus We've Got Five Loaves
[1:53:24] and two fishes
[1:53:26] how are we going to feed five thousand
[1:53:28] he says give me those you can do it
[1:53:31] nobody's worthy to loosen the seals
[1:53:34] nobody can do it give it to me
[1:53:37] I can do it but I'm not going to give
[1:53:40] them this I'm going to give it to you
[1:53:41] then you got to give it to them the
[1:53:44] multitudes has got to come to you then
[1:53:46] once he broke the bread the Supernatural
[1:53:48] come and I started to multiply it
[1:53:51] started it was just enough
[1:53:53] for that present day it was just enough
[1:53:55] it was what they needed and my I started
[1:53:58] to study these things and that just
[1:53:59] struck me and I saw another Mighty Angel
[1:54:01] come down descend from heaven with an
[1:54:04] open book
[1:54:06] an open booked not a closed book not a
[1:54:09] book of offenses but an open book to
[1:54:12] break off offenses
[1:54:15] now we've been commissioned
[1:54:18] we've been commissioned Revelations 10
[1:54:20] 7.
[1:54:21] but in the voice of the seventh angel
[1:54:23] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:54:26] of God should be finished as he hath
[1:54:29] declared to his servants the prophet the
[1:54:31] prophets and the voice which I heard
[1:54:32] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:54:34] go take the little book which is open in
[1:54:36] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:54:38] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:54:40] went unto the angel and he said and I
[1:54:42] said unto him give me the little book
[1:54:45] and he said take it
[1:54:48] eat it up and it shall make that belly
[1:54:50] bitter bitter shall be in thy mouth
[1:54:52] sweet as honey
[1:54:54] that's you and I
[1:54:56] that's you and I coming up to the
[1:54:58] Earthly Angel not saying please can I
[1:55:00] have the book but no that's my
[1:55:01] inheritance that's my Deliverance that's
[1:55:04] that's that that's my inheritance that's
[1:55:06] my way out of this pressure
[1:55:08] that's my way out of this that is my
[1:55:11] Exodus give me the book
[1:55:14] give me the book
[1:55:15] that's my Exodus
[1:55:18] in church
[1:55:19] take this word
[1:55:21] it's our Exodus
[1:55:23] brother random says why don't you take
[1:55:25] his word
[1:55:26] for he is the word run into that and you
[1:55:29] are safe
[1:55:30] and he said he continues on today today
[1:55:32] it's always something they got to do
[1:55:34] they run to a Creed they'll join and
[1:55:36] unjoy and everything else from one to
[1:55:38] another but they won't try to take
[1:55:40] Christ watch him as he vindicates
[1:55:43] himself that builds up pressure you must
[1:55:46] let it off just believe his word he says
[1:55:49] just believe his word that's what lets
[1:55:51] off the pressure
[1:55:52] that's what lets off the pressure as the
[1:55:54] musicians come
[1:55:56] I was listening to uh
[1:55:59] letting off the pressure
[1:56:01] in uh uh 62 513 and I I've heard this
[1:56:06] multiple times but I was hearing it I
[1:56:08] was listening to it I was getting ready
[1:56:09] actually it just it just struck me
[1:56:11] brother Brandon was saying if you're
[1:56:13] listening if you're if you listen to
[1:56:14] that tape towards the end of it you hear
[1:56:16] Brother Branham he's preaching then it
[1:56:18] shuts off and I'll be singing and then
[1:56:20] he explains what happens he says oh
[1:56:22] Heavenly Father Satan has lost the
[1:56:25] battle just be patient don't build up
[1:56:27] don't build up steam standing here
[1:56:30] preaching on letting off the cell
[1:56:31] letting off the Steam and Satan thought
[1:56:34] he could run me from the pulpit get me
[1:56:36] out of this altar call no Lord in my
[1:56:39] heart there was something burning saying
[1:56:41] there's somebody here there's somebody
[1:56:44] hunting for the rock we thank you Father
[1:56:46] for the victory when the last person
[1:56:49] walked to the altar the lights come on
[1:56:51] he's seen he had lost so he might as
[1:56:54] well give up the battle
[1:56:56] and that just struck me thank God for a
[1:56:58] prophet that wasn't intimidated by
[1:56:59] pressure
[1:57:01] he was sitting there preaching he can
[1:57:02] listen he's preaching he's preaching and
[1:57:04] it shuts off the power goes off
[1:57:06] but he continued on preaching he says
[1:57:08] the devil wanted me to get out of the
[1:57:10] pulpit because he knew there was
[1:57:12] somebody here that was needing to get
[1:57:14] out of the pressure
[1:57:16] I thought my
[1:57:18] the devil pressures every service it
[1:57:21] comes with mind battles he comes with
[1:57:23] one more to do tomorrow what I'm going
[1:57:25] to do afterwards and he's trying to
[1:57:27] pressure you out of your inheritance
[1:57:30] he's trying to pressure you out of your
[1:57:33] deliverance the Holy Ghost a renewing a
[1:57:36] revealing whatever it is it's pressure
[1:57:39] but brother Branham is our example
[1:57:42] to press through the pressure so that we
[1:57:45] can break through and I just love how
[1:57:47] brother Branham puts that when the last
[1:57:49] person comes to the altar the lights
[1:57:51] came back on he realized he had lost
[1:57:55] and he might as well give up the battle
[1:57:57] that's why the pressure is so strong
[1:57:59] right now because he knows the time's
[1:58:02] almost up it's time for Exodus it's time
[1:58:05] for a Rapture all the offenses are gone
[1:58:08] so he's coming with pressure he's turned
[1:58:10] out the lights we're on the darkest age
[1:58:12] there's ever been
[1:58:14] but just be perseverance
[1:58:16] don't give up
[1:58:18] don't give up we're not sitting here by
[1:58:21] accident but the Branham continues on to
[1:58:23] say it may be very strange father very
[1:58:25] simple
[1:58:26] you make things so simple so that we
[1:58:29] won't error on us love that but because
[1:58:31] they raced out of their seat and come to
[1:58:33] onto the invitation
[1:58:35] Satan tried to keep them from doing it
[1:58:38] every effort that he could put forth
[1:58:40] he tried to do it
[1:58:42] but he lost
[1:58:45] Satan's putting forth every effort to
[1:58:48] keep you out of this Exodus but let me
[1:58:50] say this he's lost the battle maybe he's
[1:58:53] fighting you this morning trying to keep
[1:58:55] you from renewing
[1:58:56] trying to keep you from from being
[1:58:59] pressurized don't give in to the
[1:59:01] pressure once you ever become
[1:59:03] pressurized
[1:59:05] the pressure won't bother you no more
[1:59:06] brother Branham says that to become
[1:59:09] pressurized
[1:59:10] he says get in my brother my sister get
[1:59:12] pressurized the pressure won't hurt you
[1:59:14] when you get inside and get pressurized
[1:59:16] it's the word he says get in Christ and
[1:59:19] you won't care what the world says
[1:59:21] that's what he's trying the devil is
[1:59:23] trying to keep you from is getting
[1:59:25] inside of this word of Exodus this is
[1:59:28] the message of Exodus and he's trying to
[1:59:30] keep you from it
