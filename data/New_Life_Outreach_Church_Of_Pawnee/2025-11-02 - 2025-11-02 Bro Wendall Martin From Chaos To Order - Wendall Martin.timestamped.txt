[28:34] Amen. Amen. We try this song here

[28:38] seated.
[28:41] When I think of all my faults
[28:45] and my failures.
[28:49] When I consider [singing] all the times
[28:52] I've let God down.
[28:57] I am humbled by the grace he [music] has
[29:01] extended. [singing]
[29:05] I'm amazed
[29:06] at the mercy [singing] I have found.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[29:13] &gt;&gt; when I can never earn [singing]
[29:16] his [music]
[29:17] love one my own.
[29:20] Oh, [singing] every time I come before
[29:24] his throne, [singing]

[29:30] by the blood of [singing] the lamb.
[29:33] Thank you, Lord. I stand redeemed
[29:37] before [music]
[29:38] the great I am.
[29:41] When he looks at me, he
[29:44] [music and singing] sees the NASCAR
[29:46] hands that bought my [music] liberty.
[29:51] I stand
[29:53] redeemed. [singing]
[29:55] Are you thankful for that? And [music]
[29:58] even at my best, I am unworthy. Oh my.
[30:05] Oh, I have nothing precious I could
[30:09] [music] give. [singing]
[30:12] A broken life is all I had to offer.
[30:16] [singing]
[30:20] And [music] yet it is a priceless gift
[30:24] to him. [music]
[30:25] [singing]
[30:27] And the bitter mark of sin
[30:31] will [music and singing] never fade
[30:33] away.
[30:34] But I can come [music]
[30:36] before him unashamed. [singing]
[30:41] I stand redeemed
[30:44] by the blood of the lamb.
[30:46] [singing and music]
[30:48] I stand redeemed
[30:51] before the great I am.
[30:55] When [singing] he looks at me, [music]
[30:58] he sees the nail scarred hands that
[31:02] bought my [music] liberty.
[31:05] I stand
[31:07] redeemed. Can you help me sing it now?

[31:13] by the blood of the lamb.
[31:16] Oh, I stand redeemed [music and singing]
[31:20] before the great I am.

[32:10] for moments I have spent
[32:14] recalling all the pain [singing]
[32:18] and failures of my past.
[32:23] And I repent
[32:26] for dwelling [singing] on the things
[32:30] beyond my power to [music] change
[32:34] the chains that held me [singing] fast.
[32:39] I will go on.
[32:42] My past [music and singing] I'll leave
[32:44] behind me.
[32:47] I'll gladly [singing]
[32:49] take [music]
[32:50] his mercy and his love. [singing]

[36:29] Amen. Believing the Lord for that, you
[36:32] know. And so we're thankful to that.
[36:35] Let's look in here at Genesis 1 and um
[36:39] we're going to start at the second
[36:41] verse.
[36:43] And the earth was without form and void
[36:47] and darkness was upon the face of the
[36:50] deep. And the spirit of God moved upon
[36:53] the face of the waters.
[36:55] And God said, "Let there be light."
[36:59] And there was light.
[37:01] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. [snorts]
[37:03] Father, we want to thank you today.
[37:06] Thank you, Lord, for
[37:09] these wonderful songs that we have heard
[37:12] and your presence that we have felt.
[37:14] And Lord Jesus, we're asking that you
[37:17] would minister to our hearts here
[37:19] tonight. Lord, we've got two young men,
[37:22] Lord, is coming up in life and going to
[37:26] be making decisions and got their life
[37:30] ahead of them, Father. And Lord, they've
[37:33] they've made some decisions to serve
[37:35] you. And Lord, we're we're thankful for
[37:38] that. And Lord, making you, Lord, is is
[37:41] is so important to us. And and Lord,
[37:45] we're just asking that you would bless
[37:47] them and bless the service. bless my my
[37:50] words here tonight. Let me speak only as
[37:53] you would have in Jesus name we pray.
[37:56] Can the church say amen?
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[38:01] seated. [clears throat]
[38:05] We um I want to deal with with this for
[38:09] a few moments and how God
[38:13] is good at turning chaos into order.
[38:18] He's so good at making things,
[38:23] lining things up in our lives.
[38:26] And um thinking about this um tonight uh
[38:31] as baptism here this evening and and I I
[38:36] thought of in the beginning God had
[38:40] brought a great transformation and he he
[38:45] did he truly did bring order out of
[38:47] chaos
[38:49] &gt;&gt; and he took amen the nothingness the
[38:52] Bible says the world as we just read the
[38:54] earth was without form and void and dark
[38:58] and Amen. And it was it was a a a
[39:04] place that was not inhabitable.
[39:06] There was there was nothing of it. But
[39:10] yet God seen beauty in the He seen
[39:15] beauty in his mind. He had a masterpiece
[39:19] in his mind.
[39:20] He had he had thoughts about this world
[39:24] and what this world was could be, what
[39:27] it what it would be, what it could be,
[39:31] what what it was and what it could be.
[39:36] Looking there at the at the void, the
[39:40] the the
[39:43] brokenness, if you will.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a dream. In this dream, a
[39:50] man would have trees on earth with trees
[39:54] and flowers and there would be animals.
[39:59] There would be mountains and rivers and
[40:04] there would be a man in his mind. God,
[40:07] this great architect God while looking
[40:10] at the void,
[40:12] looking at the chaos,
[40:15] he is looking at at a dream that he had
[40:20] to make something beautiful of this this
[40:24] great big ball called earth.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; And as God began to bring light, the
[40:30] very first thing that God done is God
[40:32] God said, "Let there be light." He
[40:36] began, Amen. with this light. This light
[40:40] began to uh draw back the the the water
[40:45] and it amen. And I think that's the one
[40:48] of the once that's the first thing that
[40:49] God does for you and me is he he brings
[40:52] light to our situation.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Light is not just a Amen. It's it's not
[40:58] just light for the natural light. We you
[41:01] you you turn the lights on and then
[41:03] Amen. Then you can clearly see where
[41:05] you're at. You can clearly see uh the
[41:08] things all around you. Amen. But there's
[41:11] also a light that comes on in our heart
[41:14] where God begins to let us know who we
[41:17] are,
[41:18] &gt;&gt; what we are,
[41:20] &gt;&gt; and the purpose that he has for our
[41:22] lives. And I I think of the power of
[41:25] God's word, how that it'll always bring
[41:29] transformation. When God said, "Let
[41:31] there be light." the Bible the very next
[41:35] words and there was light.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; When God speaks, when God comes on the
[41:42] scene and God begins to speak, he's got
[41:45] a purpose for that. And when we come to
[41:48] the Lord, when God begins to deal with
[41:50] our lives and his Holy Spirit begins to
[41:54] knock at our door, it is God that is
[41:58] essentially speaking to our lives,
[42:01] speaking into our hearts and saying,
[42:04] "Let there BE LIGHT."
[42:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S got a dream for every one
[42:09] of us. He's got I believe he's got a
[42:11] dream for for the Bible says that you
[42:14] were forever more in his in his mind
[42:18] that you were in his thoughts before the
[42:20] foundation of the world. These two young
[42:23] men that that have given their lives to
[42:24] the Lord is going to get baptized
[42:26] tonight. God knows exactly God's known
[42:29] you since you were a a a baby. God knows
[42:33] God knows your entire life. God God
[42:36] knows exactly where you were and what
[42:39] you WILL BE. GOD'S GOT a dream. And I I
[42:43] want us TO ALWAYS REMEMBER JUST AS GOD
[42:46] had this dream, Amen, for planet Earth.
[42:50] And the Bible says in six days he had
[42:53] done a total transformation.
[42:57] He had taken the nothingness. He had
[42:59] taken the brokenness. He had taken the
[43:02] chaos and the emptiness and God began to
[43:06] mold and build and and on the first day
[43:10] he brought light and then he begin to
[43:13] bring the botany life and the flowers
[43:15] and the seeds begin to grow in the
[43:17] sunlight. In the sunlight transformation
[43:21] begins to transpire. Amen. The seeds
[43:24] begin to come up. Before you know it, we
[43:26] had birds flying and we had animals
[43:30] coming up and Amen. On the sixth day,
[43:33] the Bible says that God created man
[43:36] himself.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; And he created man in his very own
[43:40] image, in the image of God created he
[43:43] them, MALE AND FEMALE.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; SO GOD IN HIS DREAM, HE DIDN'T JUST STOP
[43:50] THERE. AMEN. with the first day or the
[43:53] second day or the third day. And I want
[43:55] to say this is very important because
[43:57] when we give our life to the Lord Jesus
[44:00] Christ, Amen. And when God does
[44:02] something to our lives, remember he it's
[44:05] a continual work. God is working in our
[44:08] lives. And as long as there is light and
[44:11] we stay in the light of God's word, he
[44:13] will transform us. Amen. I can say it's
[44:17] been a metamorphice for me. Amen. I gave
[44:19] my heart to the Lord when I was a a
[44:21] young man. And God has has progressively
[44:25] led me, Amen, through uh uh situations
[44:29] to a higher level. And he's still
[44:31] transforming my life even tonight. Amen.
[44:35] As I'm getting older and and and my my
[44:39] um shoulders are becoming more stooped
[44:41] and getting bald, Amen. I rest in the
[44:46] fact that my hand my life is in the
[44:49] hands of God.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; AND AND SO BUT I GO BACK FOR JUST A
[44:54] MOMENT AS GOD HAD CREATED, AMEN. this
[44:57] this great paradise and he took man and
[45:01] his wife and he put them in the garden.
[45:04] It was pristine. It was in the garden of
[45:06] Eden. There was Amen. It was beautiful.
[45:10] It was perfection. Amen. They walked
[45:12] with God in the cool of the evening.
[45:15] There was there was no fear. There was
[45:18] no condemnation. There was no jealousy.
[45:21] There was no abandonment.
[45:24] There there was nothing there. They were
[45:27] loved by their father.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they loved their father. It
[45:32] was A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAPA God and
[45:36] Adam and Eve.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; But it didn't last very long. We find
[45:41] that after a while, Amen. Uh uh Satan
[45:45] began to to to uh he came lurking and
[45:50] and I I love the way brother Brandham
[45:52] would put it. And as he says, what a
[45:53] beautiful place God was so satisfied
[45:56] till he just went back and rested from
[45:59] all of his works. Every tree never
[46:02] brought forth thorns and thistles. No
[46:04] berries ever came off of a thorn tree.
[46:07] Everything was perfect. All seeds were
[46:10] perfect. Everything was in perfect
[46:13] condition. And then he went to take a
[46:15] little rest. And his enemy slipped in
[46:18] with deceit and took it over by
[46:21] misinterpreting his program to his
[46:23] children.
[46:25] when he put trust in his own child as
[46:28] you would put trust in your daughter
[46:30] when she goes out at night with a man or
[46:33] when when you put your trust in your son
[46:36] when he has to go with a boy that is
[46:38] drinking or smoking. You see, he put
[46:41] trust in his son that he would not do
[46:43] anything wrong and would keep every word
[46:46] that he said. But the enemy slipped in
[46:49] and like that greasy slicker that would
[46:52] take out your daughter and misbehave
[46:54] himself or some woman would would go out
[46:57] with your son and the same thing. See,
[46:59] he slipped in and the enemy of God
[47:03] slipped in and misinterpreted the word
[47:05] to Eve. Now he by this fall, it has took
[47:09] over and possessed the Garden of Eden
[47:13] himself. He took it over and now he's
[47:16] had 6,000 years of deceitful rule,
[47:19] deceiving the people, God's children, as
[47:22] he did then because they were based on
[47:24] the free moral agency to act any way
[47:27] they wish. They Amen. in believing that
[47:30] they would act right or trusting that
[47:32] they would act right. Then they've come
[47:34] in with the wrong act and sold their
[47:36] birthrights as Esau did for the world.
[47:39] And Satan wanted, he took it OVER AND
[47:42] HE'S HAD 6,000 YEARS TO BUILD UP his
[47:45] Eden as God had 6,000 years to to bring
[47:49] his Eden to a close and by deceit of the
[47:52] word or of the people now established
[47:55] his own Eden on earth in sin. Now, so he
[48:00] here this picture is painted.
[48:03] GOD HAD MADE THIS BEAUTIFUL something
[48:07] and then Satan come in and by deception
[48:11] brought in sin.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Did you know that Adam and Eve would
[48:14] have never had to die? There was never
[48:17] no sickness.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; There was never no there there was never
[48:21] no waking up on a on the wrong side of
[48:23] the bed. Hallelujah. There there was
[48:26] never any of these things. There there
[48:29] was no such things as addictions. There
[48:32] was no such things as as as children
[48:35] being uh uh left to raise themselves or
[48:39] there was there was it was all
[48:41] beautiful. It was all perfect. But Satan
[48:45] brought sin. And the scripture says the
[48:48] wages of sin is death. So when you when
[48:53] you go to buy sin, you're going to pay
[48:58] it by death.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. the the wages OF SIN. AND NOW
[49:04] every man and woman, boy and girl, we
[49:07] are all born, we're all born under
[49:10] condemnation.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're born in h shaped in
[49:14] iniquity. We're born under the
[49:17] condemnation. And every one of us as we
[49:19] grow up, I don't care whether you're
[49:21] born and and and raised in a rich family
[49:24] or whether you are you you were uh
[49:27] raised in a poor family. We we are all
[49:31] WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED
[49:33] WHAT IT feels to be condemned.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Condemnation
[49:39] is is is THERE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN
[49:42] GET OUT OF IT.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; All right. NOW THIS DRUG SITUATION THAT
[49:46] that we have and I say it's an epidemic
[49:48] that is in our land today that there are
[49:51] so many men and women who are who are
[49:54] good people good people but they are but
[49:58] they are trapped by drugs and alcohol
[50:03] &gt;&gt; AND AND WHAT WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THIS
[50:06] IS YOU ARE UNDER THE CONDEMNATION OF
[50:10] DEATH.
[50:11] EVERY ONE OF US ARE UNDER THAT
[50:14] CONDEMNATION of death.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; SINCE ADAM AND EVE, SINCE THE FALL, ADAM
[50:20] SOWED US ALL INTO THIS. AND THERE WAS NO
[50:23] WAY TO GET OUT OF IT,
[50:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[50:25] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY TO GET out of this death.
[50:28] Amen. The wages of sin is death. I don't
[50:32] care how pretty and how good-looking you
[50:34] young people are today. Amen. You're
[50:37] going to end up looking like me sooner
[50:38] or later.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE
[50:43] YOUNG AND YOU'RE HANDSOME AND YOU'RE
[50:44] PRETTY and Amen. BUT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO
[50:48] GET old and you're going to die.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; That and and that's and and the reason
[50:54] for this is because of what took place
[50:58] in the beginning. Can you say amen?
[51:00] [clears throat]
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And I want to say amen. SCARS SCARS are
[51:05] are very real on the human spirit.
[51:09] SCARS. WE WE'VE GOT SCARS THAT WE WERE
[51:13] THAT WE HAVE CARRIED FROM BIRTH. Maybe
[51:16] maybe uh uh maybe it was molested as a
[51:21] child or m maybe maybe it was
[51:24] abandonment uh uh from a a father or a
[51:27] mother and and and what seems to be uh
[51:32] UH SIMPLE TO THE WORLD BECAUSE everyone
[51:34] is the world is full of chaos. Can you
[51:37] say amen to that?
[51:38] The world is FULL OF CHAOS. BUT BEHIND
[51:42] THE SMILES, BEHIND THE MAKEUP, BEHIND
[51:46] THE CAREERS, BEHIND ALL OF THOSE THINGS
[51:49] ARE SCARRED human beings.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; They're scarred.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hurts. Hurts because of mama done
[51:57] something. Hurts because of something
[51:59] that transpired on the playground.
[52:02] HURTS. AND WE CARRY THOSE HURTS. AMEN.
[52:05] And we AND OUR AND OUR SPIRITS are are
[52:08] are are
[52:11] not made to CARRY THAT.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; OUR HEARTS ARE NOT MADE TO TO TO FEEL
[52:17] THAT ANGUISH.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T CREATE US FOR THAT.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why
[52:26] there are so many Hollywood actors and
[52:28] actresses. Amen. And I mean they've got
[52:31] the money. They've got the money. Amen.
[52:34] to puff up their their lips and their
[52:37] cheeks and their breast and behinds,
[52:39] whatever they got. I mean, they can do
[52:41] whatever they want to do to make
[52:42] themselves look pretty and they still
[52:45] can't find peace.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; They still CAN'T FIND PEACE. THEY'VE GOT
[52:50] ALL OF THIS MONEY. THEY'VE HAD ALL OF
[52:52] THIS THEY THEY'VE HAD ALL OF THIS
[52:54] COSMETIC STUFF DONE AND THEY'RE still on
[52:57] drugs.
[52:59] THEY'RE STILL ON ALCOHOL. SO IT SHOWS
[53:02] MONEY DOES NOT GIVE you peace.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; I was telling a young lady the other
[53:08] day, OH YOU COULD HAVE THE PRETTIEST OF
[53:10] HOUSE AND YOU COULD HAVE THE your your
[53:12] husband could be Mr. PERFECT AND YOUR
[53:14] CHILDREN COULD BE but if you don't have
[53:16] Christ
[53:18] &gt;&gt; you see you
[53:20] humanity
[53:22] HUMANITY WHEN WE FAIL FROM THAT POSITION
[53:26] WITH GOD WE have been under the guilt of
[53:31] condemnation
[53:32] &gt;&gt; right
[53:33] &gt;&gt; amen so we all walk until we find Christ
[53:37] we all walk I don't care whether you're
[53:38] a child there's that little something
[53:41] down in your heart, that little ug down
[53:44] in your heart. And as you grow older, it
[53:47] gets more of a bigger ug. It's it's it's
[53:50] you're not satisfied.
[53:52] You're not you're not where you're
[53:54] supposed to be. Well, PRAISE THE LORD.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SCARS ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE
[54:06] SOMETHING THAT CAN BE A BENEFIT TO US
[54:10] when we start looking for someone who
[54:13] can help heal THE SCARS.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE START LOOKING FOR SOMEONE that
[54:18] says, "I'll love you and I'll never
[54:20] forsake you." ONE THAT SAYS, "I'VE GOT
[54:24] YOUR BEST INTEREST." Sometimes parents
[54:27] don't always have the best interest of
[54:28] the children. you know, they've got
[54:30] their own way that they're doing and
[54:32] their own thing going on and and a child
[54:34] is just one of those things that's just
[54:36] lugging along. Amen. While they're going
[54:38] through their uh life experience, but I
[54:41] just want to tell you, there is not one
[54:44] of us that ARE NOT LOVED BY GOD.
[54:48] [applause]
[54:48] &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S LOVE FOR YOU, GOD'S
[54:51] [screaming]
[54:52] LOVE FOR YOU IS GREATER THAN his love
[54:54] for himself. HIS LOVE FOR YOU WAS SO
[54:58] DIVINE THAT WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN upon
[55:01] this earth and he seen that his he seen
[55:04] that his uh UH SON AND DAUGHTER WAS WAS
[55:08] FALLEN AND HE AND HE LOOKED THERE WITH
[55:12] WITH WITH WITH GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND
[55:15] HE PRONOUNCES THE JUDGMENT. I'M DONE
[55:17] GIVING YOU MY WORD. THE day that you
[55:20] sin, you shall surely die. Amen. And we
[55:23] understand that a thousand years is as
[55:25] one day with God.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; But he turned around to Adam and Eve as
[55:29] he's as he's Amen. kicking them out of
[55:32] the Garden of Eden because of the sin
[55:34] and he pronounces the judgment upon
[55:36] them. Hallelujah. God stops and he says,
[55:39] "Wait, wait. I can just see Adam and
[55:42] Eve. I can see Adam and Eve as THEY'RE
[55:44] CRYING." AMEN. NOW THEY THEY'VE BEEN
[55:46] CLOTHED BY uh they they they you know,
[55:49] there they are neck. There they are in
[55:52] regrets and AND AND GET GOD. [screaming]
[55:56] GOD COMES CHASING ADAM AND EVE AND
[55:58] SAYING, "WAIT, WAIT, WAIT." AMEN. And he
[56:02] slays a lamb and he takes the the the
[56:05] the skins of the lamb and he clothe them
[56:08] with it. Amen. Great love for him
[56:11] saying, "I will redeem you.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; I will redeem you."
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's good.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You see? Amen.
[56:21] Since the fall, man has had the
[56:24] inability to really commune with God.
[56:27] Yes, Christianity is um is is has always
[56:31] been a pretty big deal here in the
[56:33] United States.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Although it's been dwindling down
[56:37] over the years. Amen. We're not a
[56:40] Christian nation anymore. And and it's
[56:43] and it's been because Amen. GOD IS JUST
[56:48] A FIGMENT OF OUR IMAGINATION.
[56:51] We come to church once a month. We come
[56:54] and sing our song. We go home. Amen.
[56:58] We're still going to be under the
[57:01] influence of a broken heart.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; We're still under the influence of
[57:05] condemnation.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we try to satisfy that that
[57:10] that brokenness with drugs or sex or
[57:14] alcohol. Amen. Today it's an all-time
[57:17] high where where boys and girls are
[57:20] shacking up outside of the marriage
[57:23] covenant with no covenant at all where
[57:26] where you know I can leave you any time
[57:28] and you can leave me any time and
[57:30] everything about the structure of
[57:34] humanity today as is is there is no
[57:38] eternal connection
[57:40] &gt;&gt; there there is no commitment TO ONE
[57:42] ANOTHER. MAMAS DON'T WANT TO BE
[57:44] COMMITTED to their children. Children
[57:45] don't want to be committed to THEIR
[57:46] MAMAS. AMEN. SPOUSES DON'T WANT TO BE
[57:49] COMMITTED TO ONE ANOTHER. WE'VE LOST
[57:52] CONTENTMENT OR WE HAVE WE HAVE LOST WHAT
[57:55] IT WHAT IT IS TO BE COMMITTED TO ONE
[57:58] ANOTHER.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS [screaming] SAYING EVEN IN
[58:02] THIS DARK HOUR, I'M very real and I want
[58:06] to be committed to you. [applause]
[58:09] &gt;&gt; I want to be committed to you. Mama
[58:12] might have failed you. Daddy might have
[58:13] failed your brother might have failed
[58:14] you. Spouses might have failed you.
[58:15] Bosses might have failed you. Amen. Your
[58:18] your your friends at school MIGHT HAVE
[58:21] FAILED YOU. BUT GOD WILL NOT FAIL YOU.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; God cannot fail you. God's desire is to
[58:30] bring Hallelujah.
[58:32] is to bring order, beauty back into
[58:36] chaos, out of chaos. HE WANTS TO take
[58:40] our chaos, our brokenness, and he wants
[58:43] to make something beautiful within it.
[58:46] Oh, can you say amen?
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him here this morning
[58:50] or this evening?
[58:51] &gt;&gt; You see, there's no way for you to ever
[58:53] pick yourselves up by your own
[58:55] bootstraps. There's no way, Amen. to to
[59:00] uh uh fix yourselves. And what ends up
[59:03] happening is brokenness is passed from
[59:06] generation to generation.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Brokenness then goes from mama to
[59:12] daughter. Amen. And that daughter to
[59:15] their daughter and that daughter to
[59:18] their daughter. In fact, if you look
[59:20] there at the statistics and you you look
[59:23] there, Amen. you will find that
[59:25] brokenness does not just happen.
[59:28] Brokenness is passed down. PASSED DOWN
[59:32] GENERATION after generation after
[59:34] generation. It's a generational curse.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; GENERATIONAL CURSES
[59:41] THAT HAS GO ON. AMEN. GREATGRANDFATHER
[59:44] TO GRANDFATHER TO SON. AMEN. OR TO
[59:48] FATHER TO SON. AND IT'S PASSED ALL
[59:51] [screaming] THE WAY ON DOWN.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; IF WE DON'T FIX THE PROBLEM, and I want
[59:57] to say this is what makes it so nice.
[59:59] Amen. to be able to baptize these young
[1:00:01] men today because somebody's making a
[1:00:03] conscience decision. When you're coming
[1:00:05] to Christ, you're making a conscious
[1:00:07] decision THAT I'VE GOT A SIN PROBLEM.
[1:00:10] I'VE GOT A SITUATION THAT I NEED. I'M
[1:00:13] BROKEN. AND I WANT TO SAY, YOU SAY,
[1:00:15] "WELL, WELL, WELL, MAYBE I'M I'M NOT
[1:00:18] BROKEN." AMEN. YOU WILL NEVER BE SAVED
[1:00:21] AND YOU WILL NEVER BE TRANSFORMED UNTIL
[1:00:23] YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE BROKEN.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD PREACHER. GOD CAN'T SAVE
[1:00:30] ANYBODY UNTIL THEY REALIZE THEY NEED TO
[1:00:33] BE SAVED.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're rich. I
[1:00:36] DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU'RE POOR. WE ALL
[1:00:38] [screaming] CAME TO EARTH BROKEN.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; And only Jesus,
[1:00:48] it was God.
[1:00:50] It was God who came
[1:00:54] when God couldn't find any human being
[1:00:55] to redeem.
[1:00:57] God couldn't find anyone to
[1:01:00] listen. Listen.
[1:01:03] Adam was created by God.
[1:01:06] Eve came out of Adam.
[1:01:08] They were kicked out of the garden after
[1:01:10] the sin
[1:01:12] and their very first son
[1:01:15] killed
[1:01:18] the other son.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Murders were already taking place. And
[1:01:23] then we can find it throughout the
[1:01:24] scripture. All right.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; But we needed someone who could stand
[1:01:30] and say,
[1:01:33] "I'm good. I'm good at taking brokenness
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; and bringing it back into order."
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; God done it at the beginning and God can
[1:01:43] DO IT AGAIN.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; IN FACT, I'M A WITNESS OF THAT. WE HAVE
[1:01:48] GOT WITNESSES HERE.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH HAS WITNESSES.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. OF MEN WHO WERE ABSOLUTELY
[1:01:56] BROKEN,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; ADDICTED TO DRUGS, ADDICT HEROIN
[1:02:01] ADDICTS, AMEN, FOR 20, 30 YEARS.
[1:02:05] WRAP SHEETS AS AMEN. AS LONG AS YOU
[1:02:08] COULD you could see and all of that. AND
[1:02:10] YET [screaming] GOD COULD TELL COME IN
[1:02:14] AND BRING chaos
[1:02:16] into order.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:21] Brother Merl, I I look at you, if you
[1:02:24] don't mind me picking on you, I pick on
[1:02:25] him all the time. Amen.
[1:02:28] Well, Amen. A father being married four
[1:02:33] or five times
[1:02:36] and not not him being married four or
[1:02:38] five times, his father married four or
[1:02:40] five times.
[1:02:41] He knows what it is to be rose in in
[1:02:45] brokenness.
[1:02:47] Seeing a lot of things that happen as a
[1:02:49] young man.
[1:02:52] I think of sister Leah being raised as
[1:02:55] in brokenness,
[1:02:57] daddy taken off, leaving her. When she
[1:03:01] was a girl,
[1:03:04] she seen a lot of this ups and downs.
[1:03:06] When she got married,
[1:03:08] she couldn't even stand the thought of
[1:03:11] brother Merl being gone. Brother Merl
[1:03:12] had to call her all the time because she
[1:03:15] was afraid that he wasn't coming home.
[1:03:19] Sister Leah's witnesses that the
[1:03:21] brokenness was so bad
[1:03:24] until she she felt she she she had a
[1:03:29] hard time with trust.
[1:03:32] But then you look and it took two young
[1:03:34] people. They were young when they got
[1:03:36] married. Two young people
[1:03:39] THAT CHOSE TO DO IT GOD'S WAY.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; And though THE BROKENNESS IS GOES DOWN
[1:03:46] BOTH HISTORY, THE BOTH BOTH UH SIDES OF
[1:03:49] THE FAMILY'S HISTORY,
[1:03:51] WE'VE GOT NOW [screaming]
[1:03:53] A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED
[1:03:55] FOR how many years?
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; 41.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; 41 years. And what what Amen. I'm not
[1:04:01] I'm not going to ask about the
[1:04:02] anniversary of the engagement.
[1:04:04] Hallelujah.
[1:04:08] [laughter]
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; It it brokenness and here we are 41
[1:04:15] years now. It took someone to look ahead
[1:04:19] and say, "God, I'm a kid.
[1:04:23] I'm a kid." You're still a kid when
[1:04:25] you're 20 years old. I mean, when you
[1:04:26] get as old as we are, you're still a
[1:04:28] kid. Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, here I am. I've not I don't know
[1:04:31] exactly where I'm going, but I'm going
[1:04:34] to place my life in your hands.
[1:04:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Now, nothing to do with with with with
[1:04:42] the Amen.
[1:04:45] Brothers and and sisters, experiencing
[1:04:47] all brokenness in in their
[1:04:49] relationships, and it's and it's
[1:04:50] continued to go on. But here's two
[1:04:54] people out of broken families who have
[1:04:56] stood the test and said, "I'm going to
[1:04:58] do what it takes to raise my family the
[1:05:01] right way in the will of God according
[1:05:04] to the word of God." Praise the Lord.
[1:05:07] And now you've got grandchildren today
[1:05:09] that are serving the Lord. It to what it
[1:05:11] took, it took somebody to stand up and
[1:05:14] say, "I'm going to break this curse.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to break this curse.
[1:05:22] CAN YOU SAY
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN?
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; MY WIFE w was raised uh in in
[1:05:27] brokenness. Her mother was never
[1:05:28] married. Had all kinds of men. Amen.
[1:05:34] It was it was it was nothing. SHE THERE
[1:05:36] WAS DRUG DEALS GOING ON AROUND HER HOUSE
[1:05:38] ALL THE TIME. She her her her brother
[1:05:42] was at that time w was the was the the
[1:05:45] head was HAD THE BIGGEST DRUG THING in
[1:05:47] in the state of Oklahoma going on.
[1:05:50] Matter of fact, they got busted right
[1:05:52] after we got married. Amen. They they
[1:05:55] had THOSE THINGS GOING ON. ALCOHOL, SEX,
[1:05:58] JUNK, ALL ALL AROUND. BUT MY WIFE AT THE
[1:06:02] AGE OF 14 YEARS OLD CAME UP TO AN ALTAR,
[1:06:06] GAVE HER LIFE TO JESUS CHRIST, AND SAID,
[1:06:08] "I'M GOING TO START A NEW WAY."
[1:06:13] [applause]
[1:06:15] Of course, her twin sister didn't
[1:06:17] understand that. Made fun of her. Amen.
[1:06:20] And and she's went her direction AND AND
[1:06:22] AND SINCE THAT TIME, SHE'S GIVEN HER
[1:06:25] HEART TO THE LORD. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:06:26] SHE'S told me? Her twin has told me, "If
[1:06:28] I would have made the same commitment
[1:06:30] that Fresca made when we were girls, I
[1:06:33] it would have saved me all of this
[1:06:35] broken relationships."
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; What am I saying?
[1:06:40] Christianity is not a feel-good thing.
[1:06:43] CHRISTIANITY IS GOD COMING IN AND
[1:06:47] SATISFYING.
[1:06:48] AMEN. THE BROKENNESS IN HER HEART.
[1:06:51] [applause and cheering]
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE THAT CAN GIVE YOU
[1:06:55] PEACE, AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE
[1:06:58] A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP WITH.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; You think you've got a broken
[1:07:01] relationship with your mama. You think
[1:07:03] you've got a broken relationship uh uh
[1:07:05] uh with your with, YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR
[1:07:07] DAUGHTER OR YOUR SON. YOUR BROKEN
[1:07:09] RELATIONSHIP IS WITH GOD.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:07:15] IF WE FIX THAT RELATIONSHIP, [screaming]
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; if we fix AND GET CONNECTED BECAUSE YOU
[1:07:24] WERE CREATED IN HIS IMAGE, YOU WERE
[1:07:25] CREATED FOR A DIVINE PURPOSE.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; And when we come back together
[1:07:32] with God,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; the Bible, Jesus put it this way, with
[1:07:39] God all things are possible. Another
[1:07:43] place he said, "He that believes all
[1:07:46] things are the God that can do the
[1:07:50] impossible,
[1:07:51] connecting with you as his son, his
[1:07:54] daughter. You can do things that are
[1:07:57] impossible because you have come back to
[1:08:00] your origin."
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. And we have
[1:08:05] found ourselves in that in in that
[1:08:08] deformed state. We're still sons. You
[1:08:11] always were a son.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; You always were a son, but you had to
[1:08:17] realize who you were.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Have you ever thought
[1:08:23] about God, the power of love to create a
[1:08:27] body,
[1:08:30] move into that body to redeem you back?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; The great invisible God. There was no
[1:08:36] one here on the earth that could ever
[1:08:37] redeem any of us.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; NO ONE. NO ONE COULD REDEEM US. WE WERE
[1:08:42] ALL SINNERS. NO ONE. BUT YET THE
[1:08:45] RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD OR THE LAW
[1:08:46] [screaming] OF GOD SAID IT HAD TO BE A
[1:08:48] KINSMAN THAT REDEEMED. It was going to
[1:08:50] take a a a a man to redeem man.
[1:08:56] So God created a blood cell in the body
[1:09:00] of a virgin. I'm fixing to close
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; in the body of a virgin. And that virgin
[1:09:08] who knew not a man, but the seed of God
[1:09:12] was placed in her womb, she produced
[1:09:16] this baby,
[1:09:18] Jesus Christ.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; God moved into that body.
[1:09:24] God himself moved into the body of
[1:09:27] Jesus.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; So that he could redeem you, Theo.
[1:09:35] so that he could bring you back. I know
[1:09:39] our relationships here on earth can be
[1:09:41] broken and we and they and it is and it
[1:09:43] is tough. I've it is tough when you're
[1:09:46] when you're estranged from a from a a
[1:09:48] husband or a wife or you're something's
[1:09:50] happened and you re friends are at odds
[1:09:53] but there's nothing any greater than to
[1:09:56] being at odds with your heavenly father.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; But you think that you've got something
[1:10:01] missing in your heart. God had something
[1:10:04] missing in his heart because he created
[1:10:07] you for divine purpose.
[1:10:10] And it's not for drugs. It's not for
[1:10:13] alcohol. It's for a for you to prosper
[1:10:16] in this life, to live a life of
[1:10:18] righteousness to where you can have
[1:10:19] peace. Well, come on now. For you girls
[1:10:23] to be able to be married. Amen. And
[1:10:25] knowing that your that that your husband
[1:10:27] is not cheating on you. Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I TELL YOU WHAT, WALKING WITH
[1:10:33] GOD IS THE BEST THING YOU COULD EVER DO.
[1:10:37] [applause and cheering]
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF A
[1:10:40] RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LORD AND A TRUST
[1:10:42] WITH GOD.
[1:10:45] God died. He didn't just he didn't just
[1:10:50] live here on earth the perfect man and
[1:10:53] he was but he didn't just live on this
[1:10:56] earth go around healing people raising
[1:10:57] the dead
[1:10:59] so that we could all say wow
[1:11:02] wow
[1:11:05] so that we could sing a song about him
[1:11:07] in a church service.
[1:11:09] What?
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come for us to sing in
[1:11:14] church. Come on.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; JESUS DIDN'T COME FOR US TO PUT OUR name
[1:11:19] on a pew or on on the church book.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T COME FOR US TO SHAKE THE
[1:11:26] PREACHER'S HAND AND THEN BE AND OUR
[1:11:29] HEART still be broken and hurt.
[1:11:35] Jesus come
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; to fix that little problem in the heart,
[1:11:43] that condemnation, to take the guilt
[1:11:47] away
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; and to restore relationship back with
[1:11:51] man.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:11:56] Now,
[1:11:59] when Jesus went to Calvary,
[1:12:02] he took your place,
[1:12:04] Theo.
[1:12:07] I don't care if you had never sinned a
[1:12:09] day in your life. You're born guilty.
[1:12:12] You're born a sinner.
[1:12:16] And you would have to go to hell.
[1:12:19] But God looked down and said, "That's my
[1:12:21] son."
[1:12:23] Glory to God.
[1:12:25] So Jesus come to pay the price
[1:12:29] of your sin, of your guilt.
[1:12:33] We were all born. It's just the way it
[1:12:35] is. Adam sold us all into sin. And the
[1:12:37] only way to get back out is to have a
[1:12:39] brand new birth. And the only way to
[1:12:41] have a new birth was for for for the the
[1:12:43] the the condemnation TO BE STRUCK OUT TO
[1:12:47] TO TO STRIKE IT CLEAN.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:56] Did you know that when Jesus died for
[1:12:58] your sin and he went to hell, he took
[1:13:00] your sins to hell, that you can know
[1:13:02] when you accept Jesus Christ into your
[1:13:05] heart and you've accepted his plan for
[1:13:08] your life, there is no more sin held
[1:13:12] against you.
[1:13:14] Right? [applause]
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; You can be a murderer one minute and be
[1:13:22] totally redeemed by God the next. You
[1:13:26] say, "Well, everyone but murderers."
[1:13:29] God's blood is big enough for no matter
[1:13:31] what you've ever done.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; God's blood is big enough. It's powerful
[1:13:36] enough for every one of you. Can you say
[1:13:39] amen?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I he paid the price
[1:13:47] to bring us to himself.
[1:13:50] Bring us to himself.
[1:13:52] The power of the blood. You are when we
[1:13:55] talk about nothing but the blood.
[1:13:57] Nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can
[1:13:59] wash away our sins? Nothing but the
[1:14:01] blood of Jesus.
[1:14:03] Jesus gave his life.
[1:14:07] Hallelujah.
[1:14:10] Hallelujah.
[1:14:12] It could no longer be done. I I I heard
[1:14:15] the story one time of a judge
[1:14:19] and the judge, his son got in trouble
[1:14:25] and um he was speeding and he he he he
[1:14:29] outrun a policeman and he was and he got
[1:14:32] he got caught and so he come now he's
[1:14:34] standing before his own father
[1:14:37] and he was
[1:14:40] sure hoping his dad would give him mercy
[1:14:43] but His dad passed the penalty of the
[1:14:46] law to him, pronounced him guilty,
[1:14:50] dropped the gavl and said, "You're
[1:14:52] guilty." There the son was.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Broken
[1:14:58] and father was broken, too.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; But then he took off his robe.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Came out from behind the judge's chamber
[1:15:08] and came around to the front.
[1:15:11] went up there to the went up to the
[1:15:13] court clerk or or the clerk there, paid
[1:15:17] the fine
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; and they both walked out, father and
[1:15:24] son.
[1:15:25] I'm sure he got his talking to and got a
[1:15:27] good got got hallelujah. I don't know
[1:15:29] what happened once he got home, but the
[1:15:32] law was satisfied.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? All right.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And I just want to tell you that's what
[1:15:40] God has done for us.
[1:15:43] God dropped the punishment. God God
[1:15:45] dropped the gavvel and he says you sin.
[1:15:48] The wages of sin is death. And God was
[1:15:51] not going to turn that around.
[1:15:53] But God himself
[1:15:55] become a man
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; paid the penalty
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; so that you and I could go free.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Now, the scripture says there in Hebrews
[1:16:15] 2 and 14, if y'all a little bit hot,
[1:16:17] y'all can turn that turn that AC on a
[1:16:19] little bit if if you guys are hot. For I
[1:16:22] see some fanning. For as much as the
[1:16:25] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:16:27] blood, he also likewise took part of the
[1:16:31] same,
[1:16:33] that through death he might destroy him
[1:16:35] that had the power of death, that is the
[1:16:38] devil,
[1:16:39] and deliver them who through fear of
[1:16:42] death were all their lifetimes
[1:16:44] uh subject to bondage.
[1:16:47] Verily he Jesus took not on the form or
[1:16:50] on the nature of angels, but he took on
[1:16:52] the seed of Abraham. Or he took on the
[1:16:54] form of a man. Wherefore in all things
[1:16:57] it behooved him to be made like unto his
[1:17:00] brethren that he might be a merciful and
[1:17:03] faithful high priest in things
[1:17:04] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[1:17:08] for the sins of the people. Revelations
[1:17:12] 1 and5. and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:17:15] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:17:16] of the dead, the prince of the kings of
[1:17:19] the earth. Unto him that has loved and
[1:17:22] washed or him that loved us and washed
[1:17:25] us from our sins
[1:17:27] in his own blood has made us kings and
[1:17:32] priests unto God our father. To him be
[1:17:34] glory and dominion forever and ever.
[1:17:37] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Romans 5:9, much more THAN NOW BEING
[1:17:44] JUSTIFIED BY HIS BLOOD, WE SHALL be
[1:17:47] saved from wrath through him.
[1:17:52] Ephesians 2:13, but now in Christ Jesus,
[1:17:56] ye who sometimes were a far off are made
[1:17:59] nigh by the blood of Christ.
[1:18:04] there in Colossians 1:20, having made
[1:18:07] peace
[1:18:09] through the blood of his cross by him to
[1:18:12] reconcile all things to him to himself
[1:18:16] by him I say whether they be things in
[1:18:18] earth or things in heaven
[1:18:21] and you somebody say me
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; THAT WERE SOMETIME alienated and enemies
[1:18:27] in your mind by your wicked works
[1:18:31] yet now has he reconciled
[1:18:34] in THE BODY OF HIS FLESH through death
[1:18:36] to present you holy, unblameable,
[1:18:40] unreprovable
[1:18:41] in his sight.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Romans 5:1. Therefore, being justified
[1:18:47] by faith, we have peace
[1:18:51] with God.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:18:57] What is peace? The world's looking for
[1:18:59] peace. They can't seem to find peace.
[1:19:03] The reason why they can't find the peace
[1:19:06] is because only God can give that peace.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; We're all thirsting for something.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; You've got that craving. God's built you
[1:19:20] with that craving.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can feel that
[1:19:25] craving is with Jesus Christ.
[1:19:28] I want to say here tonight,
[1:19:32] we're going to be baptizing
[1:19:35] two brothers that have given their heart
[1:19:36] to the Lord. And if there's anyone else
[1:19:38] here that wants to be give their heart
[1:19:40] to the Lord, I'm not talking about
[1:19:41] coming up shaking a preacher's hand and
[1:19:43] making a new commitment. I'm talking
[1:19:45] about coming and letting God change that
[1:19:48] heart and give you something that no
[1:19:52] preacher, no church, nothing else can
[1:19:55] give you. and you want to accept that
[1:19:58] and be baptized. Well, we'll just
[1:19:59] baptize a whole bunch of you tonight if
[1:20:01] you wanted to.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Buried.
[1:20:11] Why are we baptized in the name of
[1:20:14] Jesus? There in Acts two,
[1:20:18] Acts 2 and and uh 238.
[1:20:23] Amen. Let me get it get it to you here.
[1:20:27] after the day of Pentecost on the day of
[1:20:29] Pentecost when they had they had been
[1:20:31] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:34] Amen. That this they said um uh the 37th
[1:20:38] verse. And when they heard this, they
[1:20:40] were pricricked in their heart and said
[1:20:42] unto Peter and to the rest of the
[1:20:43] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[1:20:45] we do? And Peter said unto them,"Repent
[1:20:50] and be baptized, every one of you in the
[1:20:53] name of Jesus Christ for remission of
[1:20:55] sins, and you shall receive the Holy
[1:20:58] Ghost, the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[1:20:59] the promise is unto you, to your
[1:21:03] children and all of those down in 19 or
[1:21:06] 2025."
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. A far off as many as the Lord our
[1:21:12] God should call.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? SO WHEN WE HAVE
[1:21:16] REPENTED WHAT DOES THE WORD REPENT that
[1:21:18] means we are we are not just using
[1:21:21] RELIGION AS A CRUTCH.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; ALL right
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; religion is not a crutch. Religion is
[1:21:26] WHAT IS OR SALVATION IS WHAT IS REQUIRED
[1:21:29] TO FILL THE GAP
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; TO FILL THE VOID.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Repent.
[1:21:40] I'm wrong.
[1:21:43] I've been doing wrong.
[1:21:46] I've not done things. I know my
[1:21:48] conscience tells me that I'm wrong.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; I need this guilt taken care of.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; And we turn away from it and we come to
[1:21:59] Calvary and say, "Jesus, help me.
[1:22:04] Help me." You boys aren't just saving
[1:22:07] your lives today. You're not just giving
[1:22:09] your hearts to Christ today,
[1:22:12] but you are turning things around for
[1:22:16] your generation in your lineage.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THIS STATE
[1:22:25] and say, "I
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; whether you be an urban or WHETHER YOU
[1:22:30] BE A WADE, [screaming]
[1:22:31] I AM GOING TO STAND TODAY AND GOD'S
[1:22:36] GOING TO GIVE ME A FAMILY.
[1:22:38] I'M GOING TO RAISE THEM IN THE FEAR OF
[1:22:40] THE LORD. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT
[1:22:42] [screaming] GOD HAS CALLED ME TO DO.
[1:22:44] SATAN, YOU'VE LOST YOUR HOLD.
[1:22:48] [applause]
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE LOST [screaming] YOUR HOLD. CAN
[1:22:53] YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; When God turns lives around, it's
[1:23:01] beautiful. Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And to see young men that come and say,
[1:23:05] "I'm going to take this thing seriously.
[1:23:08] I'm going to take this thing seriously."
[1:23:12] He's a serious God. And he means serious
[1:23:15] business. And when he says you're no
[1:23:17] longer guilty, when God says you're
[1:23:20] justified by his blood, you can take
[1:23:23] that to the bank, BABY, BECAUSE GOD DOES
[1:23:26] not lie. And God DOES NOT PLAY AROUND
[1:23:31] when it comes to your salvation
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and your justification.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "This peace I leave
[1:23:40] you, and my peace I give unto you, not
[1:23:44] as the world gives,"
[1:23:48] that's what I'm giving you. Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; So I want us to as we look here tonight
[1:23:56] baptized in the name of Jesus. I want to
[1:23:58] look at one more scripture here in
[1:24:00] Romans the sixth chapter and then
[1:24:05] we will
[1:24:07] move on. Romans 6
[1:24:11] and 1. What shall we say then?
[1:24:14] Shall we continue in sin that grace may
[1:24:16] abound? Now, that's that's the that's
[1:24:19] the way Christians are today. It don't
[1:24:23] matter.
[1:24:25] Hey, I can still go out with these girls
[1:24:28] and have sex and do all of that kind of
[1:24:30] stuff. I mean, it don't matter. It does
[1:24:32] matter.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; God's word says it's wrong.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It does matter. Well, it don't matter if
[1:24:39] I It don't matter what whether I'm high
[1:24:41] or whether I'm drunk or It does matter.
[1:24:44] That's right.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Shall we sin
[1:24:48] because we've accepted Christ? And then
[1:24:51] the Apostle Paul brings it to it. God
[1:24:54] forbid.
[1:24:56] How shall we that are dead to sin live
[1:24:59] any longer therein?
[1:25:02] Know ye not that so many of us AS WERE
[1:25:04] BAPTIZED INTO JESUS CHRIST WERE BAPTIZED
[1:25:08] into his death? Therefore, we are buried
[1:25:12] WITH HIM BY BAPTISM INTO DEATH, THAT
[1:25:15] LIKE AS CHRIST WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD
[1:25:18] BY THE GLORY of the father, even so we
[1:25:21] should walk in also in newness
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; of life.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus died.
[1:25:32] Jesus was buried.
[1:25:34] He carried your sins to hell.
[1:25:38] He brought you back or he God raised him
[1:25:42] from the dead in newness of life.
[1:25:46] When Jesus WAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD,
[1:25:49] THAT meant God accepted his sacrifice
[1:25:52] that he did that he gave whenever he
[1:25:55] gave his life on Calvary.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Now, if Jesus hadn't raised from the
[1:25:59] dead, you and I wouldn't know. We
[1:26:00] wouldn't know. Amen. A lot of lot of
[1:26:03] religions out there today and Muhammad
[1:26:05] never raised again and Buddha never
[1:26:07] raised. No one else ever was raised, but
[1:26:08] Jesus [snorts]
[1:26:09] has raised from the dead. Why is he
[1:26:11] raised? To prove to you that his his
[1:26:14] sacrifice was accepted.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Did you know that you can have that
[1:26:20] assurance?
[1:26:22] You boys, you young men,
[1:26:25] you can have that same assurance that as
[1:26:28] you have died, you have laid down your
[1:26:31] life and this is going down in a watery
[1:26:33] grave. All of your sins are going to be
[1:26:36] left there and you can rise in the
[1:26:38] newness of life. The Holy Spirit can
[1:26:41] come upon you and your nature be
[1:26:43] changed, your desires changed,
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; guilt be gone. You can be satisfied in
[1:26:50] your heart because God paid the price
[1:26:53] and he has accepted you. Well, praise
[1:26:56] the Lord.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; He has accepted your witness.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:03] Isn't this a wonderful evening?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I I think there of Weston
[1:27:10] and what an honor it is, Weston.
[1:27:13] What a blessing it is.
[1:27:27] It's incredible night for me.
[1:27:35] We've prayed for you, buddy.
[1:27:39] And we appreciate
[1:27:41] your family there that has
[1:27:45] taken you in and
[1:27:48] been a family to you.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; we commend y'all for that. And we say,
[1:27:52] God bless y'all.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] But I want to tell you,
[1:28:09] our God doesn't want to be an invisible,
[1:28:11] something way out there that we can't
[1:28:12] reach, Weston.
[1:28:17] God wants a relationship with you,
[1:28:19] buddy. And I know you've had brokenness.
[1:28:22] And I know and I don't want to bring in
[1:28:24] a lot of I don't want to turn this
[1:28:26] service into a crying service,
[1:28:30] but your mama being gone and I know it
[1:28:32] it's hurt.
[1:28:34] But what you're doing
[1:28:36] connecting with God, that is a that is
[1:28:39] one that'll never leave you. He'll never
[1:28:42] forsake you. He cannot die. He's risen
[1:28:45] forever more.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And he'll prove himself to be alive to
[1:28:48] you, Weston.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:51] and we all love you.
[1:28:56] I know if I love you, how much more does
[1:28:59] God love you? How about it, family? If
[1:29:02] you all love him, how much more does God
[1:29:04] love him? [applause]
[1:29:06] That's right.
[1:29:10] If the musicians would come
[1:29:14] as we get ready to [snorts]
[1:29:21] go into this uh go into the pool to be
[1:29:25] baptized.
[1:29:27] I wanted to
[1:29:30] really bring it to uh
[1:29:34] I I I I wanted you young men to really
[1:29:37] understand what what's what's taken
[1:29:39] place here
[1:29:42] in the few minutes that I have spoken.
[1:29:45] I I I want to tell you there is nothing
[1:29:48] like the power of God's transformation.
[1:29:53] He'll transform our lives and turn our
[1:29:56] lives from brokenness
[1:29:59] into great beauty.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:03] My dad was in a place one time in a
[1:30:08] and there was there was this this artist
[1:30:11] that was talking as he was teaching and
[1:30:14] he
[1:30:16] was a teacher and he was an artist and
[1:30:19] and he was a beautiful artist and he was
[1:30:22] he was drawing. He says, "Your life
[1:30:24] [music] when you were born, you were
[1:30:25] like this." And oh my. And as he was
[1:30:28] talking, he was talking about the
[1:30:29] serenity and the beauty and the And dad
[1:30:33] says, "This big old painting right there
[1:30:35] before hundreds of people.
[1:30:39] It was the most beautiful the most
[1:30:41] beautiful garden.
[1:30:44] Had a beautiful little oasis.
[1:30:51] AND AS THE MAN IS talking then and he's
[1:30:54] not and I believe he was using chalk.
[1:30:56] Was he using chalk? It wasn't painting.
[1:30:59] It was a chalk.
[1:31:01] And all of a sudden he took a brown
[1:31:04] piece of chalk. [music]
[1:31:06] And he went from the top to the bottom.
[1:31:09] Three different Mars all the way down.
[1:31:14] And the whole the whole group just
[1:31:17] [sighs and gasps]
[1:31:18] he wrote the picture.
[1:31:21] He says, "And then this is your life."
[1:31:25] [snorts] Something comes in and it mars
[1:31:26] it.
[1:31:28] It scars it.
[1:31:30] And sometimes you think,
[1:31:37] "Will my
[1:31:41] will my picture ever be beautiful again?
[1:31:45] Can my picture ever be of worth?"
[1:31:50] And the man just kept right on a
[1:31:53] painting. [music]
[1:31:54] He says, ' But the great artist, when
[1:31:57] you don't understand, sometimes you
[1:31:59] don't understand
[1:32:03] THAT THE DISASTERS IN OUR LIVES is the
[1:32:05] tender hand of Jehovah
[1:32:08] wanting to BRING US TO HIMSELF SO THAT
[1:32:11] HE CAN MAKE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.
[1:32:15] And dad says, "Right there before their
[1:32:17] eyes, he took those
[1:32:20] scars
[1:32:22] and made three of the most beautiful
[1:32:25] palm trees."
[1:32:28] And as he [music] worked, the artist
[1:32:30] worked. And if it wasn't for the palm
[1:32:32] trees and the beautiful oasis and the
[1:32:35] and the beauty of the mountains and he
[1:32:38] said it enhanced the p. It was pretty
[1:32:40] before, but it was never a masterpiece.
[1:32:46] until there were Mars.
[1:32:51] We're all born with innocence.
[1:32:55] But as life comes and scars happen and
[1:32:58] situations,
[1:33:00] God's wanting to say, "Listen,
[1:33:03] let me make something beautiful.
[1:33:06] Let me make something beautiful [music]
[1:33:08] tonight."
[1:33:10] He's He's not through painting in your
[1:33:12] life. HE'S NOT THROUGH PAINTING AT ALL.
[1:33:16] [snorts]
[1:33:17] I'm glad he's not through painting in my
[1:33:19] life. He's still painting.
[1:33:22] Every one of you here, he's painting a
[1:33:25] picture.
[1:33:28] And there may be some that's got some
[1:33:30] real brokenness.
[1:33:33] And you think, man, if I would have done
[1:33:35] this different, man, if I would have
[1:33:37] done that, MAN, GOD ALLOWS YOU TO find
[1:33:42] that in your humanity, you're just
[1:33:46] not all there.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; You're broken. Every one of us,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; And the sooner that we can understand
[1:33:56] that, [music] that we don't make
[1:33:58] ourselves,
[1:34:00] we need him. He knows me better than I
[1:34:03] know myself.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Let him make a beautiful picture.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Now, you young men, uh, Weston, do you
[1:34:10] need to change your clothes or you
[1:34:11] you're going to go? You going to Are you

[1:34:18] ready to go.

[1:49:39] you,
[1:49:41] it was absolutely
[1:49:43] chill to the bone.
[1:49:46] And, uh,
