Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and a man he is so so wonderful and we love him here tonight amen good to see everyone here amen that's come on a Wednesday night and I know Wednesdays can be a little tough you've been working all day and and you know then you you sisters haven't you've got your you got you've got to get your babies all all ready and and uh it's hard to get three or four kids all all and all together for a Wednesday night and uh uh so we always think and I think the Lord for even for for you families amen you young families with with these uh bringing your kids to church and being faithful uh every Wednesday night I tell you what amen I I I someone someone says well you know I I I I just don't feel like coming tonight I said well what about those girls that uh any mind have to feed their husbands and their families and then amen bring all of those youngins to church they don't feel like coming neither Hallelujah and so I I'm just glad I think God gives a a special blessing Amen on these Wednesday nights when you when you come and um with that extra effort amen amen it's good to good to have brother Merle and sister Leah back home and and um we sure have missed them around here and uh just just good to see uh everyone uh back I I see Brothers I think brother Joe and them were going this last weekend and I was too amen so but we had uh uh we had a wonderful Services there in in Bentley Kansas and and the Lord was just really sweet and so we're so proud for that church amen let's look here in Revelations the first chapter and um amen um we'll start at the 10th verse and so um we dealt this last um Wednesday you know just just going over some scriptures uh on Amen the the beauty of the invisible God becoming a human being the beauty this is this is this is incredible the story of redemption is incredible and um and so um I think that it's that it's important to catch that because as we go into the church ages we are now finding that God the invisible God the Lord amen Jehovah is Lord he become he he came in flesh Jesus Christ that Earthly name amen but now today he is living through the church ages on Earth not not in the body of Jesus Christ here on Earth he is now living in the the mystical body of Jesus Christ here on Earth so now Jesus is still he's got a body he'll forevermore have that body as we uh how many how many uh got anything out of the last Wednesday night service amen that body will all that's the body of God but now here on Earth his spirit is coming now living through to the holy spirit in you and in me amen and so as we go through these we want to see these things and and enjoy these Mysteries of the Lord so here in Revelations 1 and 10. I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seeest write in a book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus into Smyrna and to pergamus unto thytera unto Sardis unto Philadelphia and unto laodicea and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot gerd about the paps with the golden girdle his head and his hair were white like wool it has white as snow his eyes were as flames of fire his feet like under brass fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice has the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharpened two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength amen we asked the Lord's blessings upon the word you can be seated here tonight amen we um I want to deal with just a few just a few things here um and we might not get through the whole verse but I'd like to just go through the the the different characteristics of this of this one that is in the in the fire or or that is seen in the golden candlesticks and so um if we can deal with you know the five verses that's dealing with that then that would be wonderful but we might not get to all of that I know it's a Wednesday night and um and so uh we but we want to to deal with the voice and and and the candlesticks and the one in the midst of the candlesticks I would I definitely want to try to to just talk about those here this evening and and I would like for it to be sort of like um as we did the other night if you have any questions or anything you want to add um we we're going to do this for a while uh in a Bible study type setting um I I wish I had me a little Podium or something where I could just be right down among you and we'd all squeeze in together and where where we felt like we were in a living room or something but um but I I I think that it's a it's a wonderful thing in these with these types and so I he said and I turned um to see and if you look there in that in that 12th verse I turn to see The Voice that spake with me now amen I want you to notice he didn't turn to see the one whose voice spoke amen whose voice he heard he turned to see the voice now you might think that that is just a a translation um uh error amen but that's not a translation error if you if you look it up a man in the Greek amen the voice and the person is the self-same thing Jesus is the word amen Jesus Is God and so when you ever really see the word then you'll see Christ you'll see Jesus uh wherever the word is now they're they're in in Saint John 1 and 1 it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God Amen so you'll never be able to separate God from his word he says the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so so I want us to as we as we deal here tonight with this one that is in the midst of the candlesticks amen I want you to to look at this one as as we as we talk tonight as the living word amen that's the Living Word now the scholars and I don't want to go uh too deep into it tonight but amen the the the the the uh the Greek word for in the beginning was the word it is the logos of God Amen that's the that is the thoughts of God becoming word amen so God had his thoughts in the back of his mind forever amen and then and then when God spoke amen what happened when God spoke Hallelujah now then God became visible so we had the invisible God that filled all spaces all time he had there was you can't get you can't get below God you can't get above God and and again the other night as we were talking about the one on the throne amen how can you get on the right side of an invisible God Amen so God uses these types amen so that you and I can see so here's the one setting with the book in his right hand and here comes the lamb it is showing that God was going to build himself a body so that he could come and do the work of a Kinsmen Redeemer amen you cannot get on the you cannot get it above beneath the one side or the other of the invisible God can you say Amen but yet when God spoke let's just take let's just take this here amen uh for for for uh instance here praise the Lord hey I appreciate uh oh I don't know if y'all can see that amen Hallelujah so so let's put this let's put this easel or let's let's put this uh this deal here man this is God you can't get around him he's just there's nothing but God yeah come on over here some empty seats on this side of the building Hallelujah and um you can't you can't see God but God was there invisible for all eternity God is nature God is God is the breath God is God is God God is invisible God is there's there's there's not even oxygen there's nothing amen there's nothing but God and God had these Minds it's these thoughts in the back of his mind Amen in his mind forever he thought of the world he thought of you he wanted to be a he wanted to be a father he wanted to he wanted to express himself he wanted to have a creation amen so then God spoke and when God spoke out of the invisible realm came a tangible form of God Amen in the form of a Halo now so the first light that was created the first light was not let there be light amen at the beginning when God created the Sun the first light was the logos it came out of God God is now living in a visible form now now where wherever you see amen where God shows the Bible says he God is light God is light so so when in the beginning was the logos the logos was with God the logos was God and the logos was made flesh hallelujah amen on the pillar of fire you when when in the upper room amen when the cloven tongues of fire came down amen it was this dwelling whipping Pillar of Fire and lexifier came off and hit that 120. amen and and embodied them it was a part of God being expressed man now I without going into amen a lot of theological terms amen so but God you see they could that he lived in this light but you see amen uh God wanted to come in a more visible form so now everything everything from creation is in this is in this light when God spoke at the beginning the Bible says they're in in Hebrews the fourth chapter The Works were finished from the foundation of the world it was all spoke then can you say Amen so the logos is the Living Word amen everyone say the Living Word it's it's not logos it's not a word on a page like you would read now we would read here and we'd see words making up a sentence that is not the logos the logos is a Living Word it is it is God's body that there is God that spoke and he is now living inside his word amen he's got that form now so when you I want us to to to uh keep that in our mind because it's God becoming tangible it's always been God's desire to become tangible he he come the great Pillar of Fire came Amen on Mount Sun a Sinai and God spoke out of that with the Thunders and the lightning and and the and the and the mountain was on fire that was God speaking it was the fire that appeared unto Moses there in the in the burning bush it was the fire that appeared it was it was the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel you see God becoming tangible for you and for me now I want us to keep that in mind as we go amen of course we know what the candlesticks are I'm going to stop for a moment on that one that is walking in the midst of the candlesticks and I want us to look at these candlesticks the candlesticks are not they men are not necessarily uh they're not they're not um they're not candlesticks they're lamps amen so they're lamps that are that are there so amen I want us to matters of fact let's let's just look here there was another prophecy concerning this back in Zechariah let's look at Zechariah real quickly and um I don't want to I don't want to push things through if there's anything that anyone wants to add um or a question make sure you ask now amen Zechariah 4 and 1. praise the Lord now this here is is talking about the it's a prophecy of of the church ages that were to come amen and so um of course we know that the that the candlesticks according to Revelations 1 and 20 says that they are the seven churches but Zechariah 4 and 1 it says the angel talked with me again came again and walked with me as a man that awakened me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seeth thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl on the top of it and his seven laps thereon and the Seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one up on the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I spake or I answered and spake to the angel that I talked with me saying what are these my Lord and then the angel talked with me answered and saying no us thou not what these be I said no my Lord and he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord undiserable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of the hosts can you say Amen so so here is what he here is what he saw and I don't know if I can do this okay so here's the stand and you got your you got your fire amen Hallelujah I'm a wonderful artist all right and then you've got then you've got two trees two olive trees oops amen one on either side okay so here's your lamp stand now amen here's your here's your bowl and I you know and then the bowl that that holds the the oil in it and then we've got then we've got we've got oil coming from each one of these olive trees now amen so you've got now what were these are what are these olive trees representing anybody have a guess I see a smile huh it's the and and the Bible says that they are the two witnesses all right it is the Old Testament and the New Testament that is supplying oil to the seven Church ages amen so their their witness these Witnesses amen are are the are they new and the old we are we are the Fulfillment of all of this and it's living through us so the oil now now these these are not candlesticks because if they were Candles there is there's the the the once the once the uh once it's it's going out it has gone out you can't use oil but you see these These are tubes that that come in um Hallelujah you guys gonna love my drone amen so and they had Wicks these Wicks came from each that go down these these sticks and then they would dip into that oil that was down there in the bowl see that so you had you had all of these amen you you had all of these Wicks coming down getting the their oil from the same Bowl Amen Oil represents the Holy Spirit amen and so here we have the Old Testament the New Testament amen which is the two Divine Witnesses and each one of these church church ages are getting amen they are they are getting the same Supply as the last Church so it's not that this one the first church age oh it was a powerful they had more of the Holy Ghost the second Church age is dipped in of the Sabbath is dipped into the same Holy Ghost that the first church age was hooked into amen you you don't don't ever look back and say Amen well you know we're just in another age before the coming of the Lord and so God don't do those things anymore no God does those things Hallelujah the anointing follows the word New Testament Old Testament if you want the anointing the anointing oil has got to follow the word of God if you don't have the word then you are not in the church because the church still has everything that God ever was now you boys remembering you kids remember if we saw the dead Rays back there we'll see the dead raised here if we saw Miracles back there we can see Miracles today the only thing that would separate us is if that Wick somehow gets cut and we get off of the main line amen then this fire this fire will go out can you say man so in order hear me now yeah and that's why I always tell you young ones I don't care what you think I know you're smart I know we've got it but remember you'll never outgrow the Old Testament and the New Testament amen this is where God's anointing is can you say amen amen so how many understands that so the fire that fell on Pentecost Hallelujah did you know that the set or the candlesticks in the in in the in the tent in the Tabernacle amen they would take the they would take the the fire the flame from the original uh a fire that God lit at the beginning did you all know that God lit the fire in the Tabernacle at first it was the Holy Fire and then the the priest would come in and take that light amen this candle and they would like this and then would like this and then would like this until all of the candlesticks were lit praise the name of the Lord oh the fire that fell on Pentecost is just as good today we don't want no Strange Fire we want the Holy Father amen so so that fire the oil that flowed Amen in this bowl is the says the same oh I want you to catch that it is Jesus Christ the same he'll always be the same and if we don't see him the same it's not his fault it's because that'll lay ought to see in church a spirit God on us that don't want what they ought to see us saying I'm rich increase with Goods have need of nothing I don't need that light anymore I want to tell you if you're going to make a Rapture you better be connected to the Holy Spirit can you say man God Wants You On Fire Hallelujah too many times we got too many things that's going on can you say Amen now in the midst of these candlesticks the Bible says that the son of man was seen in the middle of it amen he was Christ was in the midst of the candlesticks Hallelujah who is Christ we just talked about it who is Christ the word the word he's the son of man he did he didn't say it was Jesus in in between he says one like unto the son of man man it's still God but it's God living in bodies from this church age this church age this church ate it is God's spirit the logos living in flesh Among Us that's what the Holy Ghost is all about Buddy that Holy Ghost is right there amen making you empowering you amen it's God living his life in you amen there in John 1 and 14 now we just read in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God Amen the world was made by that word 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth if the true if the church wants to see deity if the church wants to see deity it must stay with the word are you hearing me so if you want to see deity how many wants deity in your midst then you've got to stay with the revelation of the word amen he's progressively moving in each of those Church ages amen now remember Israel I want to just add this real quick Israel had to follow that logos Israel had to follow that Pillar of Fire amen so if the pillar of fire stopped I don't care if it stopped for a month they had to they had to sit there put up their tents they were to sit right there amen until that Pillar of Fire moved but when the pillar of fire moved they had to follow the pillar of Fire man and if they if they didn't follow the pillar of fire man God was no longer responsible for them when that Pillar of Fire moved there wasn't no arguing there wasn't no complaining they had to pick up and follow the pillar of fire amen can you say Amen why because the pillar of fire was taking them to the promise and the and and the and the promise that God gave them according to Exodus 23 and 20 he says I'm going to send mine Angel before you amen beware of him and obey his voice and provoke him not for my name is in him he will keep you in the way and he will bring you into that land he says I'll be an enemy to your enemies I'll be an adversary to your adversaries amen but he says I'll cut them all off as long as you're following that Pillar of Fire well praise the Lord and the pillar of fire is with us today but you've got to follow that Revelation it's the Living Word the reason why you're not content setting in a Baptist Church or a Pentecostal church or or one of these other churches there is a desire to know God in a deeper and more intimate relationship not that it's all here it's that you're you you come from him and you're you're wanting to know who you are so you've got to find who he is he's the Living Word and so are you Hallelujah can you say Amen so Jesus is not the letter on a page am I going too slow amen now Jesus is not the page or not not the letter on the page of a book he is that Living Word in the form of Flesh amen that's what he was now we went through that I think we nailed it down pretty good the other night and there's a there's a bunch more scriptures that we could use amen showing that that Christ amen that it was God building a body living in that body and dying in that body to redeem you and me for what purpose for us to come in and sing you know oh happy day for us to come in and sing Amazing Grace for us no no no he came to redeem me so that his holy spirit can now live in me amen can you say Amen now when Jesus came Israel was stuck they they were stuck in the uh the the in in in in Moses letter amen all they saw was letters written on tables of stone that's all they seem all they sing amen was the Ten Commandments all they seen is they didn't scratch that's what God was to them God is not God is not this the words that is inscribed on a page God is living living someone say he's living they were stuck with the Articles of Moses and says we believe Moses but the the living logos was now in the body of Jesus and they rejected it while hanging on to this back over here now they they they were hanging on to Moses we'd be with Moses Jesus says if you if Abraham were your faith you believe Moses should believe me amen they'd said another place well we believe Abraham we're Abraham he goes if you were Abraham's children you would wreck was something in the past whereas God was living today in a body that he had already said his word had already given all the types he had already given all and he was there fulfilling them and they couldn't see the Living God the Living Word present day in a body can I tell you something else we've got now we've got everyone talking about Jesus of yesterday and Jesus in the manger and Jesus saw and God is moving on he's got abroad a matured bride and now no one can see this now they're worshiping a god of yesterday now they've got an idol of Jesus and God is living in his word for a rapture amen can you say Amen now watch now Israel was stuck they were stuck and Jesus reminds them here what's this he says there in John 5 and 36 I have greater witness than John than that of John for The Works which the father hath given me to finish the same works I do bear witness of me that the father have sent me and the father himself hath sent me which has sent me hath borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he had sent him ye believe not now he's talking to these Pharisees that are clinging to Moses and he's telling them now you've neither heard his voice and you're not seeing his shape I'm here and you won't recognize it he says you have neither heard his voice nor seen his shape and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him you believe not search the scriptures for in them you Pharisees think you have eternal life and they are the ones that testify of me now here they are they're over there they're over there Moses said Hallelujah Moses said Hallelujah more Abraham Hallelujah and Jesus is saying hey goofballs I'm not in that I'm here I'm here you're not hearing his voice you're not seeing his shape and the Very scriptures that you are reading and claiming that you have eternal life are the very scriptures that tell you who I am [Music] ah can you say Amen you see it takes divine revelation now this one that is walking in the midst of the candlesticks it's that Living Word it is God's word speaking revealing himself to each one of the churches throughout the Seven Ages it is God revealing himself in a different manner coming closer amen bringing that Bride on into maturity can you say Amen so the fifth age can't look back to the to the fourth age and say well no no no no no it's God bringing a mature blood until we come to this age and there is a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish the word has come we'll praise the Lord I love it I love it search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me so Jesus will always be the Living Word all right questions and answers Hallelujah any questions huh now we've done this that one Sunday night and and then uh Austin said man right back at the very beginning I just started writing down questions because you'd already lost me amen I pick on Austin because I know a bunch of other ones said the same thing amen so amen y'all understand that you you understand the logos of God the invisible God God speaks light appears the Bible says he dwells we ain't got time to go through all that but he dwells in that light he dwells in that light it's not two Gods but it is God in a physical form in the form of a light it was God slowly Hallelujah and you know what the prophet said about you he says when God created you he created you in His image he says so if he is like a hate if he's the Halo he says a Son of God would be something like a cloud your spirit represents that Hallelujah because you come from the same image that God came the word image all right I gotta go all right let's let's keep on going here now amen so now I want you to understand what he was in that first age he'll forevermore be someone say Amen it's no wonder Jesus said the works that I do shall you do because it's the same spirit that lived in him that is living in that church now the church is not candlesticks the church is you the candlesticks represent you the oil represents the Holy Spirit can you say Amen now watch if the price for Redemption has been paid let's look here at Romans 8 and 9. amen now Jesus is saying the works that I do so you do Greater Works than these shall you do I've got to pay the price of redemption I've got to return to the heavens but the same spirit that dwells in me is going to dwell in you I am now free I am now released to live in you sin has been taken care of so let's look here Romans 8 and 9. but if ye but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be uh that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his if and if Christ be in you amen the body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him if somebody say the same spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so now you're quickened now the scripture says there in verse Corinthians 12 and 1 for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body that's that word body amen whether we be jew or Gentiles whether it be Bond or free and have been made to drink into that one Spirit somebody say one spirit what spirit The Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead the very not not the not the second person of the godhead or not the third person of the godhead but God himself living the same spirit that was in Christ is now in you and that's another one that I was was talking about the other night amen either you know as we just we just got through Reading during in Romans 8 9 it says the spirit of God dwell in you but if you have not the spirit of Christ you're none of his but if Christ be in you body is dead because of sin the spirit is life because of righteous it's all interchangeable because now God is forevermore he is forevermore in that body of Jesus Christ amen now all right you love him Luke Luke 4 and 1. let's let's turn there and look here for a moment Hallelujah okay just just so that amen um that's thistle thistle help catalyze what I'm what I'm talking about here amen and Jesus being full of the second person of the godhead no no no Jesus being full of the father because he did say the father dwelleth in me so it's got to be the no okay great let's do this again Jesus being full of the lord it's that one spirit that baptizes you into one body come on Saints we're not talking about three we're talking about God building a body and living in it Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost amen I love it amen now now I want you to remember this is the spirit it's the spirit of a word those of you that missed us on Wednesday night we put a lot of scriptures up there and and I think it's worth going back and listening to but Jesus is the or the uh amen the spirit of the word the logos is walking through the midst of the candlesticks the logos of God Amen Hallelujah it's that Spirit of the word it's the anointing it's the theophany of God it's they they have they have a lot of uh of theological things that they that they call that logos but it's the Living Word looking for bodies to express themselves in can you say Amen now watch they're in second Corinthians 1 and 21. now he which establisheth US yeah let's turn let's just turn there real quickly I get back to going again amen Hallelujah now he which establishes US with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God so now it's not God in Christ now it's God in you amen who has sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit you know in our hearts all right now as we talk about this this this one in the midst of the candlesticks let me just ask how many believes the church is powerful amen I believe the church is powerful you see because it's the one holy spirit of God the same holy ghost that anointed Jesus is the same Holy Ghost That Came Upon you at the new birth now you will never be an expression of what's here you'll never be an expression your light will never shine until you become born again until you get all of the clogs out of your system so that the oil can go all the way up and burn through your life amen Jesus did their their Nicodemus came to Jesus and he says hey we know the Miracles that you've done we know you're a man of God all the Miracles and and and and it's and he's got to if you were to read John 3 and the first chapter on on down but I'm going to break in here at the third verse and he said John 3 and 3 Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto you except a manly born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus says unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto you accept a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto you that you must be born again why is it that the church that is claiming themselves to be the church is not producing the life of God because they're not born okay Jesus was the Virgin born son of God what is the second birth what is the new birth what does it mean to be born again you are a virgin born son or daughter of God praise the Lord now how could Jesus be the Virgin born because he was the word predestinated word that was spoke and God came in and I believe when God spoke the word at the beginning he also knew the woman he knew the womb that it was going to be when God said a virgin shall conceive amen he already knew their name was going to be Mary because Jesus that was well let's just let's just look here real quickly amen and then we we won't hold you real long tonight let's look at Jesus for a minute Jesus was the seed word of God in the womb of a virgin let's look here at First Peter 1 and 19. and I'll I'll wait for you boys or you boys and girls this time amen First Peter 1 and 19. praise the Lord so so when you talk about the Virgin birth we're talking about the word of God falling into a predestinated womb the anointing coming down upon that word amen and causing it to live quickening that word amen the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you well why does she need the Holy Ghost to overshadow you because she was a predestinated seed that God had planned that word in before the foundation of the world and you have predestinated words planted in your heart from before the foundation of the world too and just as the Holy Ghost had to overshadow the womb of Mary to bring out amen the perfect Son of God so do you have to have a new birth or you'll never understand the mysteries of God you'll always try to reason them you'll always try to figure them out God is known by revelation can you say Amen you can't teach God it's got to be here and then God begins and then as you get rid of this then that that new seed on the inside well it's the same word it's the same word amen it's this right here in here it's already planted in seed form so when the Holy Ghost begins to overshadow that seed that was already planted before the foundation of the world in your heart he knew you would be here in laodicea he knew you'd be right here in this service here tonight and he knew the whole he knew you'd be in this bad world he knew that it would just be so chaotic and bad and sinful but he placed his seed on the inside of you and I just think we ought to shout hallelujah amen let's look at Jesus they're in First Peter 1 and 19 are we there but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you and that word for ordained is to predetermine it was already predetermined pre-decrete the word was spoke Hallelujah can I just put it this way I I don't I I think this is neat God looked down through time before there was ever in Adam not man Adam but a molecule an atom before there was before there was air before there was water before there was anything it was God right Hallelujah and God in his mind looking down and then all of a sudden he saw a fall all of a sudden he looked down 2023 and he saw some of his sons that were going to be right here in Pawnee Oklahoma and God seen that they were going to need a savior and right then before there was ever the devil created before the garden was ever created Hallelujah a lamb was slain y'all missed it man that's powerful Jesus was not the after product the Bible says he was ordained before sin got here Jesus was not amen the result of sin Jesus was ordained before sin ever got here because God knew the fall was coming God knew you was going to need a savior oh I'm trying to be good amen 14 foreordained somebody say foreordane redetermined but was manifested in the last days let's look at another one real quick amen there are several scriptures but I'm not going there let's look at Romans 13 Revelations 13 and 8. Hallelujah Hallelujah you see now brother when Hiatus don't believe that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain two thousand years ago we all know that it happened here in the mind of God what and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of The Life Book of Life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world he he Jesus was that word living in a body and all the religious people didn't know who he was he was the Living Word the son of a virgin Saturn 800 years prior in Isaiah behold of virgins shall conceive and you shall call his name the Everlasting God the uh the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace the Mighty God is that right here he comes in and now they're saying you're claiming to be the Son of God God has no Sons God's God He Ain't Human and Jesus was saying have you not read there in Isaiah 53 he was bruised the chastisement of our peace was upon him by his stripes we are healed he was the lamb that was slain in the mind of God before the foundation Lord he was simply coming and living that word in a body come on Church you are the predestinated seed of God you are here living that word you say I don't believe it all right let's look at it real quick every son of The Seven Ages have had to come the same way by the word of God that was spoke before the foundation of the world the Bible says there you can put it up there uh you don't have to turn there but because it's just the first line there a First Peter one and two I think amen elect somebody say hallelujah elect according because the mercies of God when he comes when you come to an altar he man here five years ago or one year ago or no no no no according elect Accord God oh can you say man Hallelujah you see foreknowledge looks back but predestination looks to Destiny for knowledge for knowledge is is when we were in the mind of God predestination is pointing you and establishing your destiny in Christ amen hallelujah all right amen so you've got the gene word seed of God Jesus this is explained to them in Matthew 13 and 37 you know when he's talking about the parable of the wheat and the tares amen and he says you know uh he says he that soweth a good seed is the son of man the field is the world amen he says the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the weeds are the children of the wicked the enemy uh that sold them is the devil and the Harvest of the world the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels so here we find that his word was the seed Austin what causes you to want to love God and reach after God what causes that hunger there's a seed that was planted in your heart way before you were born way before your daddy was born way before your mama was born I'm talking about way before there was a devil created there was a seed that was planted in your heart God's seen you was coming and God planted Hallelujah you didn't see you as coming he ordained you for this specific season and he planted his seed in you because it was going to be the son of man what is the son of man the son of man in the Old Testament is always a prophet it's God coming and speaking through a prophet can you say Amen now here it is God's living in human beings through the Holy Spirit but how are you birthed your birth by the spirit igniting the seed Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary amen overshadowed that seed and Jesus came the Holy Spirit comes in our church services overshadows this seed not that you're hearing tonight but overshadows the seed that was planted in you before the foundation of the world any questions man all right what does First Peter 1 and 23 say I quote this a lot so I'm gonna I wonder how many knows what one First Peter 1 23 is come on Sister Amy amen Hallelujah being born again not of corruptable or sexual seed but of incorruptable what by the word I thought it was by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has got to fall on something Hallelujah amen if the if there is a dry eraser seed in the ground amen hallelujah the only way to get another seed is for the light to come on it if you put the seed of God in the ground when the Holy Ghost comes it'll produce what is in the ground Jesus says search the scriptures I'm the Fulfillment the Holy Spirit has come and energized the word concerning me can you say that all right that's a bad that's a bad illustration all right Born Again by The Incorruptible word of God let's just keep on going let's look here at Romans 8 and 29. Hallelujah I want you kids to turn there let's let's go there oh there's going to be some times when you youngins are going to go through trials especially when you start hitting your teenage years and then all of a sudden your world starts rocking hallelujah oh man you don't know how many times I went to this scripture when I was a kid I still go to the scripture amen Romans 8. amen Romans 8 and 28 for we know that all things are you are you kids there are we all there all right good you guys are awesome we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to what oh my Amen to them who are wanting to be a Christian no no no to them who are they call according to his purpose God's purposes can't be frustrated your purposes can be frustrated man's purposes can be frustrating but God's purposes will never be frustrated watch watch now he goes on to explain for whom he did for no Hallelujah that means to have knowledge of beforehand past tense he also did predestinate did you notice that's Brit past tense now what is predestination what does predestinate mean anybody know determine beforehand it is to decree or ordain before him for so for whom he did for no them he also did predestinate or to decree or ordain to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate past tense them he also called past tense and whom he called past tense then he also Justified past tense whom he justified past tense he them he also also glorified past tense what shall we save into these things if God be for us you are just as predestinated as Jesus Christ was so you can look at scriptures today and say search the scriptures devil for they are they that testify of who I am how do I know how do I know that the message is accurate how do I know that God is calling me because there is a deep that is calling to the deep and if there is a deep calling there is a deep to respond hope Hallelujah when the coyotes are out there howling you don't you don't hear from you don't hear from the wolves or from from uh you know you know cows don't start moving no when one coyote when you go [Music] all of a sudden it sounds pretty good and then all then then all of a sudden from way over here oh [Music] and before you know it you gotta [Music] what is it it's the Deep calling to the Deep and it's the responding of the same nature back and when the Holy Spirit The Living logos is walking in the midst of the candlesticks and he's revealing his word there's something in me saying yes yes yes [Music] foreign because he said so how do I know that I'm saved because he said so there's something calling me [Music] but praise the Lord amen so when the devil ever comes back and tells you well you you you just tell them I'm already call I'm already predestinated I'm already called I'm already Justified I'm already glorified how can that be because I was predestinated that's why Jesus could stand there and say destroy this Temple three days I'll raise it up brother Branham said it wasn't necessarily that the Lord showed him that he read it in the Bible concerning him he read it that he would have to go into the grave for three days well glory to God didn't that just wonderful I don't have I just believe what God's word says so here we go I'm going back again if you want deity keep his word ever before you because the life of the word is there with you can you say Amen Ephesians 1 and 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children so now what happens now you say now brother window there in first John 5 and 8 it said the other night that there are three that bear witness in the Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these agree in one which consummate a birth that's right you got to have at the new birth or at a natural birth you have to have water blood and spirit right water's got to break blood and then there's got to be spirit enter into that Hallelujah but you can't have a new birth if there's no seed I could tell sister Angie have a baby she can't have a baby unless she's got a seed in her womb here I go and Angie amen now here I go you cannot receive a new birth if there was not a seed planted in your heart before the foundation of the world if there's no seed the Holy Spirit could Hallelujah there's all kinds of water then water around here a long time there's all kinds of blood there's all kinds of spirits that will not mean there's going to be a new birth or until there's a seed that that falls upon and then Hallelujah Jesus was the word that the Holy Spirit overshadowed can you say Amen you happy quickened who were once dead in sin seed was laying inside of you but he quickened you can you say amen hallelujah oh do you love him so now now looky here now watch this now I want you to see what that Spirit does for you amen I'm going to start reading you a bunch of scriptures we're not going to turn now amen because I am out of time amen so so write these scriptures down so you can read them in your devotion I want to show you that the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ is that same that's that same logos that's walking in the midst of the step it's the Holy Spirit In You The Living Word in you acts 10 and 38 . I I know the trinitarians just this they they hate scriptures like this one but amen acts 10 and 38 how that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and Power you know what God's you know what God's you know what God's trying to show you the same Holy Ghost that's in you as a Son of God it's going to now Empower you who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with them watch this acts 1 and 8 but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come a upon you it's the same Holy Ghost That Came Upon Jesus it's the same holy ghost that overshadowed the womb of Mary didn't just overshadow the womb he overshadowed the seed in that womb that was predestinated by God before the foundation of the world as that same seed that is predestinated in you before the foundation of the world come on you can't have you can't have it any other way and when the Holy Spirit comes upon you it germinates that seed am I making sense I hate it when y'all's not asking questions or some I can see somebody who's going huh Hallelujah all right watch this power Luke amen if he gave to the he gave the disciples power without the Holy Ghost what do they do if you've got the Holy Ghost because Jesus turned around and he said and he gave them power and authority over the devil's to cure diseases amen Luke 10 and 19 I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and overall the power of the enemy and nothing should by any means hurt you can you say Amen now watch watch now I'm gonna write these down Matthew 3 and 1. all right John is saying I indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that comes after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire what's what's what this what what's what this Holy Spirit done to the early church acts 4 and 33 and with great power acts 4 33 with great someone said with great power gave the Apostle Witnesses of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus acts 6 and 8 and Stephen Full of faith and power did great works and miracles wonders and miracles among the people Romans 1 and 16 I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation First Corinthians 2 and 4. my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and of Power are you going to be a powerful church if this happened here and we're getting the same oil that Jesus had in him I'm just trying to tell you what this church was is what this church has got to be if you're connected to the same boat Jesus was the Fulfillment of scripture you are the Fulfillment of scripture oh that just makes me want a shout spit scream Hallelujah God is so good to us amen all right now watch he says but in the demonstration of the power of of the spirit and of power that your face should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God first Corinthians 4 and 20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power power first Thessalonians 1 and 5. for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and much Assurance second Corinthians four and six for God who's committed the light to shine out of Darkness have shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us can you say Amen now what did that now what did Acts 2 and 22 say I'm going to bring a scripture in from last week amen you men of Israel hear these words uh they're in Acts 2 and 22 Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God that first church was approved of God among you by me approved of God by among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him it was God now it's God and in many membered body well glory to God all right amen now I want to show you something just real quick now you say brother window why is it that the church man why is it that the church here is uh I I you know why why we talk about power and but but but other people do do Miracles too well yeah I think I think there are gifts there are gifts and callings that and it's and it's a different gifts and callings or without repentance which means you could be a call to the ministry you could have you could have gifts talents um Elvis Presley had had gifts um brother Branham says that his his brother Edward was called to be a minister but he says he couldn't get his he just he couldn't get his act together so these come without repent these you are born with those gifts amen but now there's going to be but just because you've got gifts and talents doesn't necessarily mean that your name's on that Lamb's Book of Life those gifts and talents are not the predestinated seed and I'm fixing to show you watch okay so I'm going to create a tree Hallelujah amen so you got the you got the trunk of the tree here this is this is amen all right we got leaves out here all right all right now here's here's here's the tree the vine Jesus says I'm the Vine you are the branches is that what he said if the branches if the branches are going to produce any kind of fruit they've got to be connected to the Vine amen so if it is that if this if this is an orange tree and The Roots it'll produce oranges in the in the fruit Hallelujah then you say why is it why is it that those people that you call false are seeing miracles why is it it's called grafting it's a neat little deal brother Michael says we need we need to plant one we need to do something like that out here in the church so we can just go out and look at it occasionally because this this it's the neatest thing they'll take they'll take a little stub that's coming off here they'll cut that off and they'll make a v now that is a part of a branch they will take another I meant off this other tree amen over here we're going to make this that's you know we're going to make this a grapefruit this here is a grapefruit tree so they're going to take this Branch they're going to they're going to cut that off then they put this Branch right over here amen and then they splice it and they wrap it around right here next year next year this orange tree is now bearing grapefruit not here in the original not here in the original but right here in this grafted Vine you can also come right out here and then bring another one in and make this a lemon all right bearing lemons on an orange tree hooked into the vine of Christ but bearing false witness of Christ claiming to be a Christian but bearing fruit that is contrary to the Bible look it up it's pretty neat mm-hmm yep yes and that and that is a good point and what you've and what you're looking at is is Christ talking about how that that that that God cut Israel off and put the Gentile in but this is coming but this only can come as I just as I've just told you through a new birth so it's it's the Pig that is being turned to a lamb in that regard because this we're talking about dispensation we're talking about dispensation on on uh where God cut the one off and now bringing in the Gentile elected predestinated seed they we were it we we were in sin we were in the world but our seed was eternal in the mind of God so when he has grafted Us in yes we are gentiles but we are ever bit that root from the beginning it was predestinated in us though we were we were the dogs we were the Gentiles so God the Jews forsook him because now the lineage is not coming through a natural but now it's going to come through that spiritual seed Jesus Christ his seed and then it brings it in that way so there was a dispensational change now here we are we're dealing we're dealing with the church and let me let me just show you and then and then I'll I'll um and then I'll see if this answers your question all right so John 15 and 5. our fruit is dependent upon him if you wouldn't mind just putting that up Sister Clea John 15 and 505 got this wrote down right I am the vine you are the branch he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit without me you can do nothing now all right so now let's look here when you graft that those branches into the Tree of Life just as the Antichrist is done now I want you to look here at this scripture here in Matthew 7 and 21 talking about our day when we when they or when the Judgment Day and which is coming around the corner after the Rapture there in Matthew 7 and 21. not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many shall say unto me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in your name in thy name have cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you in other words you were never in my foreknowledge depart from me ye that work iniquity so here's Here's Where We Are this is this that now now we're talking about now the Gentiles it don't matter whether you're Jew or you're Gentile so whether you're whether you're over here with the Jews or whether you're here with a gentile God is going according to the predestinated seed so he's taking this Jewish tree and he's taken the Gentiles and grafting them in but by Nature not not by the nature of the flesh but by the nature of that predestinated seed of God that he planted in our hearts before the foundation of the world you understanding sure right yeah predestinated seat according to the roots the word now again Christ is the roots he's the word amen so he says search the scriptures for that's who I am there was Gentiles who were the Gentile dogs lost without any kind of a hope that had that same seed within them that was planted into this other okay because if because it's a citrus it's a citrus tree and here's the deal it's it's it's bearing false witness because orange is citrus lemons uh grapefruit tangelos now here's the deal they're bearing false witness of the roots of the tree they are Spirit men and women serpents children are spirits just as you and I but only one has Christ seed in their heart therefore they can come in tapped into the same Holy Ghost in the last days there will be false prophets false anointed ones and shall deceive the very elected if it was possible because they're bearing claiming to be Christ but they're not let me give you let me give you another example when when Moses came when Moses came to Israel and Heap every sign miracle that he'd done before the people janison Chambers came back and done every miracle that Moses could do how can that be how can that be they even had when he turned his snake when he put his rod down and it become a snake so did they and they use that to try to harden the hearts of the people but you know what I'll tell you something that was different about them they could not take the plagues away Moses was the only one God's showing him so so what what I'm showing here and this this is a little bit different than than the Jewish tree I'm talking about the tree of Christ here now because here we are the Jews the Jews were cut off and the Gentiles grafted in and and so y'all understand his question because because the script and he's what he's doing is he's asking that question of the Bible how that how that the Gentiles were grafted in you you had the Jew tree the Jew tree was cut down and then we were grafted in in its place and and but but the lineage is still the same you were predestinated in Christ before the foundation of the world yeah yeah they're they're they're they're living are you talking about the grafted in in this one here or the other one that yeah yeah in that tree they produce the very life of that tree yes predestinated be a different spirit it's a spirit of being devilish or a mm-hmm OS it it it's it's it's it's this is good I appreciate you bringing this out uh clay um First Timothy the third chapter let's let's look here just real quickly first Timothy or is it second Timothy it's this gets fun amen all right I don't know it's Wednesday night so we gotta we gotta we will we'll we'll shut it down here in a minute okay they're they're in second Timothy three and one know this also that in the last days perilous time shall come men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous bolster proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God now this sounds like they're all sinners having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so now this is in the Christian church for of this sort are they which creep into houses amen television evangelist internet lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and Chambers withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt mind rep bait concerning the faith now now you hear you know so here here we are talking again in the Christian church this is in the Christian church having a form of godliness connecting to the life can speak in tongues was Balaam a false prophet right how many believe Balaam was just as evil as they get and yet Balaam prophesied of Jesus birth that prophecy came to pass and his prophecy is still coming to pass and he's a false prophet he couldn't know that other than through the whole through God the Bible says the rain shall fall on the and the son shall come on the good and the evil the same anointing that is causing the wheat to come up is the same anointing that's causing the cares to come up it depends the seed so it's huh there you go that's that's a good one yes Judas was part of the 70 that went out and and was given the power to cast out Devils that's right that's right Judas was given that power and he was the son of the serpent from the beginning the Son of Perdition is that right so now yeah angel of Light yep that's right yep the fruit if that tree itself puts forth another branch is going to be it will it will that and and that is and that is true and and I want y'all I want y'all to catch this this is this yeah you bring up a good point so let's just say let's just say this branch has been you know that's a lemon okay okay if when the tree dies and the life goes back down on the ground when it comes up the next year it'll still bring out a limit okay but if the tree ever produces of its own again let's just let's just move up here at the top of the tree it'll produce oranges look look at them on the online I mean they've got these things ever they have they have got trees they've got trees with all of this fruit all over it who's hollering my name yeah oh you do put that up there Hallelujah man so there's there's a tree that's got oranges lemons grapefruit tangelo's and they are all bearing false witness of the roots absolutely you can listen listen I I came out of Pentecost guys I seen miracles I I've seen guys that were living as corrupt reprobates cheating on their wives and Performing miracles Hallelujah right and it's interesting that this grafting has just they have just got this grafting in our day and here we are we're seeing we're seeing how the enemy's coming in and just tapping into the Holy Spirit tap it it's the same rain it's the same rain falling upon but it's the seed their seed is lemons and not oranges amen well I wouldn't doubt it that's going to be it's it's going to be every everywhere living but no no it's the enemy and again now this ain't and I will say this you ain't going to find that in scripture that's not script I'm giving I'm just given an illustration on I'm given an illustration on on what is causing this what what what what is causing the Christian church who claims who who says like that like that deal that who put that deal on there today yeah yeah of that of that Lutheran woman preacher you know out there with a lbq whatever that is and and and uh and they want to say well let me talk to you about the Bible no you want to talk to me about the Bible no no no no no no no no evangelize to me tell me no no I don't want to tell you to just come to my church well okay claiming to be Christ and bearing fruit that is totally opposite he says are you born again yes yes the roots is Christ he is the vine we are the branches the devil has tried to come in and take this righteous tree that God God that was forwarding in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and Satan has can I Satan has come in and grafted his own tree into that amen because we're all Spirit beings the root is in the soul the spirit the spirit we've all got the the uh uh uh uh amen the Adolf Hitler was a spirit man uh Jeffrey Dahmer was a spirit man just as you're a spirit man Satan anoints that spirit and can get it so close that diviners amen with a Ouija board or a diviner uh uh you know looking at her in her glass can can actually foretell things and get it right sometimes they're Spirit individuals and they claim that but what happens is when the church claims to be Christians and they're not Christians and they're living contrary it shows from the roots that it's wrong I don't care what the bad to say I don't care what the Methodist the Pentecostal or anyone else is I'm going to Bear witness of the root the word y'all understand that you see that that and and but you're but but what you said is exactly right when it puts out another branch it will be an orange that's interesting it's really interesting and uh it's quite an incredible thing would you say something Hallelujah so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible that means these fellas are going to be gifted anointed tapping in to something Supernatural you know them by their fruit what what did what did God say in the Old Testament and you musicians can come but what did God say in in the Old Testament he says now if a diviner divine's true and then leads you contrary to what I have said he says that man is false in order to be true you've got to be tapped in some way the rain is falling and the Terrors are rejoicing the Terrors are maturing but the seed and there is where I'm talking about in the in the candlesticks y'all catching that the son of man walking it is that Living Word walking through the churches and we're going to start seeing we're going to start seeing brother Dennis how Satan has attached himself to the Christian church all the way back there in the in in the early church and we're going to start seeing how how that is how Satan has done it now we know that they are of a false spirit we know but see the world doesn't know that We Know by the word that's right you judge it by the word and when you look at that you're thinking well they're crying tears oh they're crying tears and you might get your feelings hurt from what I said the other night about the Gaither videos about all those sweet hollow sweet little ladies and all painted up and hair all cut and and and you think oh Christian they're Christians if it's an orange tree it's going to Bear oranges right now I know that there's some that might not have heard the truth but if they've heard the truth there'll be many there that that have not heard the truth and they're judged by what they know but if you and I have taken that word we're grafted in or we we are part of that root system that's who we are you can come up cry at crocodile tears you can dance and shout all over the building you can you can perform Miracles and still go to hell so I didn't get quite get to where I wanted to finish just because there's the fake does not mean that the real Pentecostal Skies are not full of the blessings neither I have a problem with people saying well oh you speak in tongues oh you're Pentecostal no no no no no no no [Music] if the if the root of this spoke in tongues if the first church spoke in tongues the last church can speak in tongues if the first church had prophecy the last church will have prophecy are you are you hearing me oh well well I don't want no one to turn meth oh I don't want to be considered false you're going to be false if you ain't got no life in you you just let the Holy Spirit come in you that Living Word live his life through you there's going to be gifts in operation there's going to be Miracles and there's going to be the moving of God and we are going to grow and we do see them amen that baby that we just that we've been praying for that shameful baby you know um that was a bad situation said baby he cannot live I wasn't going to live it just wasn't going to live past a year and those were newly those were newlyweds and they were just so worried and things you know and then and then we got the news today that the doctor is now saying they can't find it in the baby's system it may be in the genes and it might affect his the baby's children on down but we're saying nah amen the doctor trying to cover for himself but you know what God came on the scene and touch that baby he touched that baby [Applause] the problem is is we get so much of that unbelief in our hearts and we say well but that might have well but no why can't we just accept God and just believe God for Supernatural things in our lives not make them up but accept them when they come I don't have to make we don't have to make nothing up God's with us stick with that root stick with that word the life will follow the word this is written word what we want is the Living Word to come in this day and light that word up in our hearts can you say Amen how is it how is it that that we all how is it that when you hear truth and and then all of a sudden it's like you've always known it it's like yeah yeah it was there you didn't know it you didn't know it but it's that Gentile going back to that that seed something within here amen what did the Apostle Paul say the Gentiles who do by do by Nature that the Gentiles without the law do by Nature that which is contained in the law it shows that he says the law was written in their hearts and in their minds oh it'd be wonderful isn't he so good to us amen now any more questions I don't want to leave I know it's getting late but I I don't want to leave anyone hanging neither any other questions real quick and I can and and I can uh what I'll do is I'll I'll do it I'll go a little bit deeper in this little in this deal too on the on the uh the Holy Spirit yes yep the Citrus life yes yep and they do it they do it they'll come back every year people are planting them in there the people are planting them in he does yes there are two vines that have been growing in the church and and and and and this is this has been the deal all along and now this is and this is simply what the reason I brought I brought this in there is no scripture that that that necessarily says it this way but I'm what I'm trying to show was Balaam hooked into this life in order to prophesy something that is still coming to pass janison Chambers hooked into that light because that power only comes from God he hooked into that and so that that but the believer will always bear the fruit of the root there it is the cry yes Satan has his bride God has his bride but the thing is it's all within the framework of the one tree it's all in the framework of the Christian church what he does have his tree yeah yes that's that's right that's right you got this tree if you've got this uh if you've got this tree over here let's just call this let's just call this Satan's tree I mean we know you know you've got this tree here and and uh that's that's that's that's the tree of of the serpent anything rebellious sin um and and we know that Buddha is gonna religion is going to come off this the bahaminism and all of these that's that is the tree of the devil and the and and Satan and it will come in frusion and this that's that's or you could use the the wheat and the and the tares you know back the weed and the weeds but what happens is the Bible says that in the last days it would get so much that Satan would take it off that put it over here to make it look like it's Christian they're using the Bible they're using they're speaking in tongues they're doing it all and it don't look nothing like this you did you see that so so there's what that you can't be deceived by this by this tree because you know that's that's that's going bad the Deception comes from this right here yes yes you are you are it was a god dealt with nothing but the Jews the Gentiles had nothing to do with it God dealt with Abraham and his seed as a natural people up until Christ Christ had to come out of the lineage of David the natural lineage but when the Holy Ghost came and they rejected Christ rejected the Holy Spirit then God pruned that tree and put the Gentiles into that tree now that doesn't mean that the Jews are not going to God's going to reveal themselves back to the Gentiles the Apostle Paul says have they all had they have they have they sinned that they should uh uh you know totally be you know uh put away by God and and the Apostle Paul says God forbid there's going to come back a time where that tree is going to grow again and it but it will produce the same roots as are the same fruit that you as Gentiles produce the Life of Christ you understand what I'm saying ultimately yeah ultimately she's on her own she she's I mean she is the wife she will be the wife of Satan and she will be and and she will be uh destroyed and we know it we know it as as church members but they don't know it outside there we know it you know we can we we we we see because we we're looking at the fruit of the thing and we can see exactly the the harlots we can see all of that and so in that regard you know on these types you can't take these types and and take them away if if you okay and we're close I promise but you look at Abraham okay you got to be careful when to start and stop your type with Abraham because Abraham had that son and then after that then he had then he had daughters and then he went on and then he went you know Noah you got to know when to start your type and in your type yes sir yes sir or you'll have no you'll have Noah becoming a drunk after after after he got into the New World um y'all understand that so when we're using our types these types and as we get into the revelations you'll see these types here that God's given us and we've got to keep those types exactly and not confuse them with this that and the other these are just simply types to show like like um uh uh like Joseph and and um their their Joseph was exalted to the right hand of the Throne of pharaoh he had a gentile bride in the palace when he reveals himself to his brothers when his Brethren that's a type that you and I are going to be caught up in the rapture when God reveals him Jesus reveals himself to the hundred and forty four thousand and shows himself that way but you got to know when to stop that type and then as you're going through y'all understand that so so so the the the the um Satan's group is known as the Satan's group is is is has got has gotten many different names and the bride you know sometimes we're called the sons of God sometimes we're called The Bride of God you're going are we Sons or are we bride well it's a type it's God showing who we are and what we're doing amen yeah yeah well they'll be they'll be it'll it'll the Bible says that they will that that that Satan's Apostles will turn themselves into angels of light so he takes these unregenerated men without the Holy Ghost puts them into that tree and they look real they look oh my goodness and the Bible says that Satan will turn his own men his own Apostles into angels of light it's incredible he did yeah yeah man they'll they'll they'll they'll look like man they're just a lot more Hardy they'll look like everything else but yet they're not they're not the original man all right are we all clear I uh all right I want us to all be clear because I uh I know it's I know it's it's getting late and I know that uh y'all got to go to work in the morning all right so any of these questions tonight that you've got write them down give them to me during the week and that way we can have some Bible studies on them and um because I would like to start taking uh maybe these Wednesday nights or Sunday nights we're awfully it's
