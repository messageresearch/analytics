it's good to be back in the house of the Lord tonight good to see brother Jude and these other fine young men here I I forget your names Amen brother Judes is an easy name to remember and uh but we're so glad to have y'all here tonight and uh lenni it's good to see you again and uh uh good good to see good to see everyone here tonight back back for the the evening service and uh wonderful presence here tonight praise the Lord let's look here in the book of Ephesians the sixth chapter and uh we're um um going to read out of the first three verses praise the lord well um we uh want to remind everyone we've got the coup's banquet coming up this is it Friday or Saturday this coming Saturday and so um if you've not registered we we want you to and and those that if there are some that might not have have the money uh for the meal just don't just let us let me know and and um and I will try to help you with that uh we would like for all of you um everyone to come that can come and um and so we we sure appreciate uh those that are that are working to put that on and um and so it's going to be a wonderful time uh for the couples um let's look here at Ephesians 6 and and one children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest live long on the earth amen may the Lord add a blessing to his word you can be seated here tonight and um I figured I would speak a little bit I uh to to the children we we preach a lot to the um uh teenagers and and um the adults but we um I thought tonight I would um uh preach to you to to some of you younger ones of course there's going to be um the teenagers involved in it too Mam and dads where the word of the Lord is for us all but um I I want to to uh title my thoughts tonight the first commandment with promise and um when I heard brother Jude was here I thought oh what a what a sermon for these guys amen y'all to come at this uh for a for a a simple teaching like this but uh but we're glad you're we're glad you're here amen and um you know uh there in Proverbs 6 and 20 it says my son keep thy father's commandment forsake not the law of thy mother bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee when thou awak it shall talk with the thee for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life I think this is an incredible thing as we read the scripture honor your father for this is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and that you would live long upon the Earth you see though God has so blessed you children and especially you children here that have Christian uh mom and dad that loves yall and um that teaches you in the ways of the Lord and and to uh teach a certain uh uh train simply is is to teach a certain type of behavior through practice and instru instruction over a period of time and the scripture does say in Proverbs 22 and6 train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it and so in teaching there's there's three things that us parents know is it's a plan there's instruction and then there's practice and so God gives us Mam and daddies uh to to to train Us in the ways of the Lord and uh to teach us how to be productive uh uh citizens how to behave ourselves how to uh be appreciated by other people uh when you when you go to school um when you've got when you've got uh uh children that know how to respect authority and um uh when when you uh are out in the public and you see uh children that uh behave themselves and answer yes ma'am and yes sir and and open doors for elders and and um you know these kinds of things a a lots this comes from well-behaved children means that there is moms there are moms and dads that that love them that are teaching them uh uh the ways of the Lord and not just the ways of the Lord but every one of us have um we talk about that predestinated seed all the time and we've all been born with a purpose and the purpose that God has has given uh can never come to its completion unless unless God sets boundaries in our lives and when we talk about boundaries we're talking about amen most generally to all of us here 99% they we're talking about moms and dads now I understand that um there's some of you here that that uh have foster parents and but they would be in the same category because man this is this is God's blessings to you it's God's blessings to you now you you take the swamps of Louisiana and um I you kids might not know uh what a swamp is but a swamp is just a bunch of water and excuse me there's a bunch of water and and there's no boundaries there's no there's no edges to it it's just little bit of water and it's swampy and alligator live there and and swampy creatures live there nothing against Louisiana by the way amen and uh and but God don't want our lives to be swampy swamps usually has a lot of skeers and and just a lot of low lion areas that are just don't have anything really really good about them but you see if you take that same water and you put edges you put boundaries on each side of that water and you then you would turn you would turn the old swampy uh alligator infested areas into a river and the more that boundary the the the the closer the boundary gets the the the more powerful the river becomes now I want us to think about that for a few moments I've I preached hard this morning and so I I just want to talk to you kids tonight amen because if we're not appreciative of the gift that God has given you in your mama and daddy then you will you you will not understand the tools that God has given you so you boys and girls how many of you boys and girls have have a little bit of a hard time with liping Mama amen well you're a bunch of liars amen hallelujah hey this guy did now this guy raised his hand it was just a little bit but he raised his hand a little bit amen God bless you Daniel and and so uh uh but but sometimes we do and and if we're not careful you can discourage mama you can cause Mama to cry you can make Mama feel like she's not loved and here God has given you the greatest gift because he's given you someone that stays at home to take care of you and to train you amen and to get you out of the swampy condition now brother bradam would say here I've got a quote here somewhere amen praise the Lord do you love him uh uh uh praise the Lord oh my goodness um amen all right I'll get to it I I'll get to it in a minute but if you're left alone then you then then you miss the the blessing that God has given you to raise you up I think one thing that this generation is missing is we have got and you kids might not understand this but we are a generation where mama is working and daddy is working and we have got we have got a generation that has raised up amen that is neurotic they they they they don't have that closeness they don't have that Bond of a human being that loves them they're all in daycares amen they're they're in a big unit a big group unit and and they are not they're missing the Personal Touch the personal feel from their mother I hope this going to be okay here tonight a personal feel from the woman that loves them and and I I I want to I I I want you to look at that they are out there now you might think that it's fun for those kids not to have M at home and for them to be out playing being away from home all the time but God's blessed you in giving you someone at home that loves you that cares for you that's that's that's looking after you and training you in the ways of the Lord now when I was a kid they didn't have the daycare thing like what we have today all right amen how many of you Elders can say Amen to that the day I mean the daycare was there you could have daycare but but but for the most part you were raised at home we were taught by the by by the I I was I was trained amen how to treat a woman because my dad always came home my mother always I I learned amen uh how a woman is to treat a man I I seen those things but another thing too is I learned the productivity and what it was to become a man amen it was just part of the action I I I was raised in a in in a family that that was uh conscientious that God put us here on the Earth today for a purpose now here we are these many years later I'm 54 now these many years later the majority are of the kids are are at are at daycare they're they're not with their mother and uh amen and and they are just uh so what do they do a mother that don't really care or a woman that don't really care for them she looks after him and makes sure that that the nose is clean and and and and feeds them at 11 or 12:00 amen but she is not a mother to them the Apostle Paul says you have many instructors but not very many fathers and and so amen they they they they they instead of investing love into their lives they have given them uh a tablet they give them a television they give them so they're put just just go sit down be good amen watch the movie do those things there and they and they have lost kids have lost the ability to interact with with the others amen they they they don't know how to work I'm talking about I'm talking about 25 year olds amen still living at home with Mama and there's nothing wrong and I say I say to you teenagers there's nothing wrong with living with home with with Mom and Dad hey if you can save the money and you you keep your money in your you know I mean pay them rent by all means amen but but if you're not having to if you're not having to to to to to pay for the electric and the gas and this and that amen and and stay home hey keep putting the the money in the bank that's that's the way I see about it but you pay your way you you don't you don't you you you're not there uh uh mooching off of your mom and daddy and and and living home free and and watching them struggle to pay the bills and you're not helping to pay the bills amen but you see you see you are you you're not there just uh uh playing your games and and uh uh doing your own thing no God has put us here with a purpose and a boy and a girl that is left to themselves at a daycare somewhere is not learning their purpose so when you got a mother who stays at home and sometimes we look at mom as if who is she anyways I mean I mean you know you're with her all the time and you begin to think well you know and you treat her anyway let me tell you something with that mother that mother is the backbone to your family the reason we've got so much nonsense and so many kids today on drugs and on and and and and and not uh uh uh with so many complexes is because there's not a mother there to keep the home together Hallelujah because Mama's wanting a career Mama's wanting to go to work Mama's wan to do this do that well praise the Lord so to have a mom at home that is there loving you training you teaching you and you might think that well you know listen she's there and with her being there that is the backbone to your family my mother was not a um my mother doesn't spell very well and um uh uh you know my my my mother uh but yet she invested in our lives and you would never known that that she couldn't spell when we were growing up because she was a stickler on us and our and our vocabulary words and learn and she would go back and forth I didn't know I didn't know that Mama wasn't a good speller until I was an adult amen and uh uh but but the thing is is amen but she invested in my life invest there are some people that take care of you and then there's other people that invest there'll be others there'll be plenty that that take care of you that that nurture you along that make you that and and and you would probably survive so is the whole world but there's very few that will invest in you that no matter no matter what you do no matter what you come what no matter what she's going to be there your mom and dad both are going to be there thick and thin from now on Amen going to be there now I think I told you it's going to be simple I think because I'm I'm I'm I want you I want you kids to understand I want youall to understand the importance of respecting and loving your mama and your daddy now mom and dad's got a plan they they they're already looking at the future they're wanting you to be a productive citizen they're wanting you to um uh uh know how to handle yourself Hey listen you see this this this age today this this generation 30 years old and don't know how to do anything uh that this is new this is new this is not this this is not the way it's listen the the there was a there was a young boy at the age of 7 years old by the name of Josiah that was king of Israel Jesus amen knew how to handle himself his mom and dad had left for for for three days journey and left him at the a at the temple amen and and at 12 years old he knew how to handle himself feed himself he knew how and the the Bible says that even this child this child was so brilliant in his mind that the elders and and the and the preachers were all standing around thinking wow this young man's got it put together 12 years old we could go through it was it was seven years old or or or or or eight years somewhere in there where that that God came down and appeared unto Samuel so what I'm saying is training is important amen mouthiness from a child to an adult is wrong can I get an amen from you young people you say it's not in my heart Yet brother amen I ain't Amen in that amen mouthiness from a child to an adult now detached parenting leaves a child to himself amen and too many times we we'll do that and M and daddies I want to say detach parenting if you've got if you're that kind of a parent don't do that be be a parent that is not passive be an active parent be a part of their lives be a part from the beginning to the end and when they get to that teenage years amen that's not the time and and and especially boys boys want to but boys want to to to to be a man and that's that's the way God has built them to be a man God's built them to be strong and to be and they're and they're and they're pulling and they're pulling away but remember that young man or that young young girl the young lady needs you as a parent you are part of who they are now you see we when we and and and that's something for you young men and young women you teenagers to always keep that in mind listen God's given you a bond you you boys God's given you a bond and that Bond must never break that Bond will be there amen that's your foundation that God gave you today I am 54 years old and I still have the greatest honor and respect for my mother and father I I am I am 54 and I if the Lord should ever take them home oh it'll hurt it'll hurt brother Merl you you you lost your dad here a couple years ago it hurts you see because there's been an investment in your lives now the scripture says there in Proverbs uh 29 and 15 the rod and reproof give wisdom amen the rod the belt and repr reproof gives wisdom and a child hey you you kids I want youall to either read it in your Bible or look up there and a Child Left to himself or herself bringeth his or her mother to shame so here's the deal if Mama lets you go I'm G to pick come going pick on you if your mama lets you you go and and you and you're lying to Mama and you're hiding things from Mama and you're doing you're going to grow up one of these days and you won't be a good girl you'll be one that's got all these bad habits about you and you know what your mom will have to go like this sometimes man who does she belong to um you see what I'm saying so God doesn't want want your mama to be ashamed saying oh I don't know whose girl that is that is her daddy's girl see God wants us to bring those who are investing in our lives honor I think that's the greatest thing we could ever give a a a a a parent is someone who is investing love in your life investing their time in your life life you being and bringing honor to them when someone when when when when uh uh Nathaniel is is is investing his love and sister Katrina is investing her love into your life the greatest thing that you could ever do is give honor and respect to them that's that's the way you would do that you see because it it it it tells them I'm proud of who you're making me I'm proud that you are helping me to overcome some of these things in my life that I am struggling with I'm thankful for your help well praise the Lord boys and girls uh teenage boys and and uh teenage girls Hallelujah you know it used to just be a few now we've see you're going to be a teenager so how you're you're 11 or 12 12 you're fixing to be a teenager how old are you 11 amen and she's already been a teenager for a while you but you'll never outgrow that you see it's because the investment in your in in the life and there are things in our lives that that uh and and we've got teenagers here that that's that's that's that that's coming and and and and and there are if there's ever a time you need Mom and Daddy in your life you need it in those teenage years that's true and that's the time where you're already beginning to feel like a woman and feel like a a man and you're thinking man I've got this all together if there's ever a time that you need uh uh that that that love around you you needed at that time what's the greatest way that you could ever express love to Mom by honoring her how do you honor her when she is trying when she is saying up you're being a little bit Lippy say I'm sorry when you're when when when you're a hold you're 12 you're fixing to be a teenager and and Mama's correcting you and she says I don't want to I I don't want to hear no more of it yes ma'am I'm sorry what are you doing you're giving honor to the one who loves you enough to say quit being a brat because she wants you to grow up to be a man and you're going to sit there and argue with Mama and she says enough Paul you say yes ma'am you give honor to that one who is teaching you and now I'm coming to you you give that honor to them you're you're showing respect and how many of you mamas in here when you're when when those when those your children shows respect like that and says sorry what does that do for your heart doesn't that just you think they don't want to be chewing on you your mama don't want to fight with you well praise the Lord he said well I don't know why she fights with me because you're the kid and she's the adult Simeon and you back there too see we can all look around and we can all we can we can say these things but these are gifts that God has given given us all right enough of on that now so here brother bradam would say and he's he's comparing hard preaching uh to to to uh apparent correcting he says listen hard preaching sometimes it'll keep your church leveled up it'll keep it'll keep it what God Said like sometimes if I hate to do is correct my children or give them a weapon I just hate hate to do that the worst thing one of the last things I wanted to ever do to my boys they might not believe that was to equip them or correct them I felt yucky I didn't like I just don't I want people to like me especially my kids right come on how many of you parents how many of you parents just do do you love spanking your children or correcting your children no I seen you nudge your dad there amen they don't they don't they don't we don't like it you say well I don't like being corrected well your dad don't like correcting you but it's a requirement it's got to be it's part of what it is now brother Bram would say it say I you know anything I hate to do is a my children or give them a whon I just hate to do that but yet the Bible says to do it and you watch these little people today that don't whip their children and correct them find out what they got they got a smart elet that'll stomp their foot and slam an orange against the wall and ball you out the parents see that's it the Bible is right in everything isn't that right the Bible is right in everything so so God is is wanting something and I and I and I want to talk to you parents uh uh just just for a moment amen don't ever get discouraged don't ever get don't ever get weary in well doing don't ever get downhearted and say I just don't know mamas you're having an effect upon your children and mamas we need you we love you daddies do you love your mama or your your wife amen the children's Mama amen you you love them so so everything that is that is that is uh uh uh worth having comes with a price and you Mama's got to understand that amen the natural progression of the universe amen is movement from order to chaos it's not the other way around amen it's it's it's it's just the oppos opposite there is there is a force to bring destruction and it and it requires you to have a vision and say no I've got to keep this together I i' I've got to have a vision here because if you don't amen it's the natural thing of the universe to pull apart to to to to to to to fragment and and and to destruct and a family left to itself is self-destructive a Child Left to himself herself is self-destructive Mama you're the nucleus you're the you're the one that God's ordained to keep the home that is out working in the in the in in working on the on the job he's out taking care of this and that and you're the one you're the one that God is has for ordained and predestinated to be there for your children now I I want us to to to think of that because amen the only way that we're going to beat the curse amen is to invest energy into the project or into the the the the object the only way to beat the curse a Child Left to himself will self-destruct Satan will take him and destroy him that's just the way it is so if we are going to help this boy or this boy or this boy or this boy or this boy or this boy it is going to require someone with a vision and someone with the energy to put it and keep it all together even though it seems sometimes it's trying to come apart every which direction but God's blessed you mamas God's blessed you children with Ms can you say Amen so to set those boundaries without rules you young people don't learn the appropriate way to behave without structure you children don't develop security without structure your children don't you you you children don't develop the ability to master self-discipline amen are y'all is this okay here tonight without structure give me an example brother Wendell sure I didn't think you'd ask mom says it's time to go to bed at 8:00 you say but Mom and and she don't want to tell you to get ready for bed at 8:00 cuz every night you are on her all the way till 10:00 until she just wants to go and cry but because she knows structure is important she puts her neck out on the line knowing that you're just going to throw yourself a little hissy fit because she's wanting to teach you discipline am I doing all right over here teenage guys amen hallelujah discipline so so if we if we want and the greatest thing I think the greatest thing that we could ever have sometimes you kids especially you know you these girls get all pretty and woof we've got some pretty girls in here and and we got some handsome fellas in here and sometimes all week can think man we're growing our little peach fuzz or mustache and uh we're we and and man we're we're going around we think we can't wait till the day we get married man I tell you what I'm going to get my chick and we're going to get married and we're going to we're going to we're going to get this and and and you ain't no discipline at home sleeping till noon every day you don't know how to hold down a job you don't know how to save money you don't know how to keep your mouth shut whenever mom and dad's trying to talk to you you ain't got no discipline so God gives us boundaries God sets the boundaries hallelujah amen God puts the boundaries and he says stay in the confinement of these boundaries he is training you to bring your will under your control not Mama's control your control mama is simply putting the boundary now it's up to you to do the right thing it's not Mama's job it's not Mama's job said I told you to St I I I told you I'm to help me I'm I'm G to tell your dad and it's your job J to stay in the boundaries that have been set for you and you don't get to choose the boundaries you get to choose to do the right thing when the boundaries are set and when you learn that you are safe when you're in the boundaries mama don't scream mama don't cry mama is giving you rewards you're blessed every time you turn around you think wow you know what I sort of like my boundaries there's safety here in these boundaries you don't want to hear Mama scream quit putting your foot outside the boundary well I'm doing better than what y'all are amening good how about you youngans are y'all y'all catching the drip yet boundaries there is nothing worse than a young person that knows everything about everything and it's constantly I was going to say no I'm not going to look this way and I'm not going to I'm just I'm just going to just keep my eyes open while I'm a preaching that's constantly wanting to C cor everybody constantly and we've got some people in this audience that knows how to correct everybody amen and I and I want and I want to say your mama teaches you well but that's your mom ain't teaching you to go around correcting everybody it's a bully nature it's a bully nature that just wants to constantly have subordinates around them it's a bully nature that says you're a bully you're not a leader a leader is confident in who they are a leader has a purpose a Leader's got a go a leader is a leader because he has the best interest of all of those around him a Leader's not trying to leave that Al don't you you quit you're try what that's not a leader that's a bully wo I'm not even getting I must be hitting pretty close to home cuz not even mama and daddies are a man and now H or maybe Mom and Daddy's getting mad at me I don't know but we what we want is go a Christian is always looking for the best interest of somebody else so if I say oh don't touch that I'm not doing that because well I want to touch it so don't you take no I know that if you touch that and it's real hot and you don't know it's hot you're going to hurt yourself so I am stand if there is a command as a child one one young person to the other and there's and and and you're reaching out to try it's because you know that that they're going to hurt themselves or there's going to be you're not trying to to to to keep them under your thumb you're trying to help them praise the Lord so when we look at one another amen our our and I will say that we are all born very selfish we're all born bullies we all want things our way done our way and parenting those who are subjecting themselves to their parents at home will portray that when they're away from home they will show amen out of the good character of their heart what they're learning because Mom is not kicking you all over the place because because you're being uh uh uh uh because you're you're I say kicking all over I better watch what I say with the internet she's she she's not demanding things for her own she is trying to teach you how to be a productive citizen and to be a help uh uh to to to to be a a a human being with purpose amen all right praise the Lord do you love him the Bible says there in Proverbs 23 and 13 this is the way they used to do it back in back when I was a kid this scripture was used a lot Proverbs 23 and 13 withhold not correction from the child for if thou beat him or chastise him with a rod he shall not die and I'm a living proof I didn't die there was times I thought I was that's right that's God's way now if you've got parents that are giving that to you I'm asking all of you young people to really stop and think about that Lord and especially if you're Lippy with your Mam and your daddies and you and you've always got to have some to say back I want you tonight to repent because this is bad character from a boy and a girl very bad especially if you're fixing to be teenagers or if you are teenagers it's not good it's not good quality for a young man and a young woman to have that's not discounting you you you you younger ones neither amen but we what we do is we want to repent and we want to ask Lord help me give me the grace to stay Within These boundaries that you have given me can you say Amen now what should our attitude be Proverbs 12:1 who so loveth instruction loves knowledge but he that hateth Repro reproof is brutish that word brutish is stupid that's the good old that's that's that's that's that's that's one of the definitions it's one that that that's not thinking so one who doesn't like uh in instruction and and reproof is is is is is is is not thinking correctly the ible says there in Proverbs 27 and5 open rebuke rebuke is better than secret love amen amen Proverbs 9 and 7 I want you to turn to that let's all turn there won't be holding you too much longer now Proverbs 9 and7 he that reproveth a scorer GTH to himself shame he that rebuke a wicked man GTH himself a blot reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee re rebuke a wise man and he will love thee give instruction to a wise man and he will yet be wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning so if there is a scorner one that is scorning and you're when you're when you're and especially and and you know sometimes kids you know I guess they do it to their to their dad too um but lots you know Dad's ain't going to just you know Dad's dad's not in their nature to put up with it and uh but but but you you work your mama over and and um and and and correction reproof is given to to to a a boy or girl and and that that's a scorner and and then he'll turn that thing right back around turn that thing right back around on his mama and make her look like the fool and and and sometimes you kids can win you win the argument because Mama's not trying to argue mom's got the facts and you can spin this thing all around but the fact is if you're a scorner the Bible says to just not even worry about you that you're going to go and do your own thing but I say if there's a heart to repent and to quit being a scorner when someone is trying to instruct you and reprove you then you've still got a hope but those that the scripture says leave him alone don't even rebuke him I don't want God to ever do that to me I don't want to be one when God's correcting me but see I learned that when I was a kid I want to do that which is right with the authority that God's put me under can you say man see but on the other hand rebuke a wise man and he'll love you re you you give instruction to a wise man and he'll be wiser someone comes up and says hey you know as a young man you I I've noticed this and he'll say thank you I I appreciate that I haven't noticed that I appreciate that then that shows that heart shows that you're wise in your heart to accept correction it also shows that you're willing to add to your wisdom and you will continue to grow and become wiser and wiser as you go but any man that despises correction and despises Authority at their youth when they get older it'll it'll it'll just constantly be something that they have to battle against then you'll never be able to respect your pastor you'll never be able to respect this respect that you'll never and God is trying to train you and you ladies would never be able to respect your husband the way that you should so God I'm going back am I am I doing okay here for for you kids so so God has given you these things to bring it out for you to grow and prosper somebody say Prosper he wants us to prosper all right Proverbs 19 and2 6 amen amen it says he that wasteth his father and chase away his mother is a son that causes shame and brings reproach now any of you any of you boys want to be that kind of a person you want to be that kind of a person you want to be that kind of a person bring shame reproach to your mom and dad huh you want to be that kind of CH said yes amen you don't want to be that kind of a person Good Charity you want to be that kind of a person now you girls are saying it says boys amen but it's but it's for the boys and the girls amen we don't want to bring reproach to our parents amen now here's here's another one uh proverbs 30 and 17 the eye that mock at his father and disobey and despises to disobey his mother the Ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eaglets shall eat it amen in the New Testament the Bible says rebuke not an elder amen now this is talking about a about a pastor it's it's talking about Authority in the church amen but it's also talking about uh uh uh your Sunday school teacher it's talking about your it's talking about your school teacher it's talking about any of these it says rebuke not an elder but in treat him as a father so you never you never get over that that respect that you're learning as a kid is something that goes with you all through life it's something that God is training you right now and it says and the Elder women as mothers in other words you treat the elders like you would your mother like you would your father you respect them say well I don't have to obey you huh amen so it doesn't matter uh Madison if if um um I don't know if Sister April gets on to you when you're outside and you're out there running behind cars and sister April says you get back up there on that sidewalk and you say I don't have to do that you're not my mother the Bible says you treat the elders Elder as a mother you respect her and mamas daddies when an elder gets on to your children you should be on the side of that Elder well praise the lord well I don't want no one getting on of my children well yeah just let them get ran over next time no teach your children to respect authority boy I'm doing good amen I've got a hand clap from Len so so when so we we read the scriptures here so it's now it's expanding on to just not just not just the the the the the parents but now it's the Elder it's the pastor it's the amen do you look there in first F first Peter 5 And1 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another be clothe with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble amen uh there in 1 Timothy 5:1 17 let the elders that rule well uh be counted a double worth a double honor now I know this is speaking again to the ministry but but did not did not did not brother brandom say that you mothers are the Fifth Gospel and that you mothers preach the gospel so you got a woman preacher in the house amen and you are the prophet says you've got to listen to that Mama amen amen right well the girls have to listen to Mama but none of us boys we don't have to listen you listen you respect and God will honor you for that all right let's finish this off let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and Doctrine double honor that means if Mama and Daddy has been good to you you ought to just you ought to say sorry twice the next time that you mouth and you ought to think them twice double the amount than what you I'm already having I'm running kids off now amen no he's going back where you at Nathaniel he's going back to apologize amen so so those that are Ru that that rule well um especially those who labor in word and Doctrine for the scripture saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that tread out the corn the labor is worthy of its reward receive not an uh against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses in other words you you trust and you respect your your mother your father you love them you give them there in Proverbs 1 and7 Fe fear the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and understanding the fear of the Lord is what now the fear of the Lord does not mean I'm scared of the lord it's the respect the reverence and when I reverence God and I love God then who are the ones who are the ones that are your instruction who are the ones that's given you knowledge it's these two right here so the the the the fear of the Lord the respect of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge that you are receiving from him and her you've got a respect therefore the Lord is teaching you everyone understand that amen all right for you Maly ones proverb Proverbs 16 and2 23 the heart of the wise teaches his mouth amen and adds or increases learning teaches power insight to his lips can you say Amen there Isaiah 50 and4 the Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned that word learn is the discipled so that the Lord has given me the tongue of the discipled that I should know how to speak a word in season can you say amen amen so I as I as I as we close out here tonight thank you for your patience we um I just want to say that we are not automatic Overcomers we're not I have to work I I have to keep this body in the script that the Apostle Paul says I Die daily amen but I want to show I want to tell you kids when you look at your mom and dad and you're you're looking at at at at at at the Elder you see something about them and maybe and maybe you don't know it but we were all young people ourselves and we had to learn we had to be taught and we had to be teachable amen I like this and I want to read this quote to you before we it's a little lengthy but then I'll close brother bradam preached a message how can I overcome then 63 he says the same now in each age the same overcome when they each son of each each son out of each Church age overcome the temptation of that age I've got the scriptures here I don't think we really have time to make it through it he says as I said in the beginning you are born defeated that birth can never bring you to life because you were born defeated you're in a defeated World among defeated people amongst defeated Creeds defeated denominations and you've got to come to Victory some way so every one of us you say well I struggle I I I'm I'm struggling with Lipp that's okay that's okay you say that's okay yes as long as you're willing to be taught amen he says at the birth you you come you you uh at and that birth you can never come to life because you're born defeated you're in a defeated world it's just like a lily a lily I think is one of the most prettiest flowers there is I'm very fond of those little kala lies and pond lies I I think there's hardly there's nothing hardly as pretty as a good as a great big Pond Lily call it a water lily how it's Radiance now where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy Mucky Pond and the little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in is in it right then when it's in that mud now I just want you youngans to think about that now maybe I brought in some things here tonight and maybe you're as mouthy as can be and maybe you're a little defiant and maybe whatever you're going through I'm W you kids to know that right now on the inside of you is the seat of God Mama daddies do y'all believe that it's the seed of God on the inside out of you to bring you into into your completion now watch this he says I think there's hardly ever he says what does it come from it's a little seed down the bottom of the muddy Mony Pond that little seed he says he says uh uh uh but it's but it has to strive daily knowing that there is there is something it's it's it's black it's dirty it's Mucky it's slimy in that slime that that it's living in yet it presses its way through the mud and the muck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time I think that's an overcomer that once in sin once did things that was wrong don't worry about it now see once once did things that was wrong then now why look back into the pond again he says God by predestination see has brought this seed to life and it's pressing itself it's coming to light now on top of all of that it has overcome doesn't Express itself down there it's getting up to express itself and I you you kids understand that see God God's bringing that thing right out of us glory to God and though your Mam and daddies were once right there in y'all situations and sometimes it was rough in their lives but God brought them out and he's going to continue to do that with you now watch he says he says it's he says neither did you in your sin adultery and the things you lived in you didn't Express nothing there was a seed in there it and and but yet there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press into that light now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight it brought you it brought out what you was in the beginning see what I mean you you saw light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily you remember my sermon on the Lily Reverend Lily he he toils yet he does not spin yet Solomon and all of his glory is not AR raid with one of these look at him he takes nothing for himself the Lily don't care about himself what does he do he throws his Beauty out his life that others might see his life is expressed out that others might see the glory what's in him that's that was in him in the mud and now he's on top that's the Overcomer he overcome the mud he overcome the things of the world now he freely gives himself out everybody can look at him his life you can't put a finger on it he's a real Overcomer you can't say nothing about him now he came out of the mud who you say well he came out of the mud but he's not in the mud now he's on top of it you can't point back what he was what is he now he's on top then the bee comes by and and say Ah that's wonderful per perfume I believe I'll go and get my part he just opens up his heart come on now all right everything takes from him he's a real Pastor he expresses the glory of God he looks where he where he come from he had he had to overcome to do that and one time he or she was young and fair and beautiful they had a lot of Temptations to go through but they overcome that they overcome now they're expressing the real beauty of Christ in their life expressing it through the mud Jesus gave us the example how to do it now we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to overcome humility somebody say humility humility is the ability to say I don't have the answer humility is the ability to say sorry when I'm wrong humility is the ability to say I want to trust Mom and Dad humility is the ability to say not my will but God's will be done in me amen he says now he he says he he says humility GED himself with a towel washed the disciples feet and wiped them the very God Of Heaven humiliated himself we don't want to be humiliated that's the reason women don't want their hair to grow out and the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should dress and men don't want to it's it's the same thing they don't they they they they get humiliated but God but Jesus constantly look who he was greatness I'm going to say something greatness humiliates itself great humbles itself greatness I've had the privilege of getting and I want you kids to listen to this I've had the privilege of getting to meet some great men it's these guys that's got a change of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket to Rattle that that's the guy that thinks he's something when he's nothing but I've stood by Great Men I mean great men with ragged sleeves and cuffs they they make you think you're the great person greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be I I don't mean dirty I I mean humble in spirit I don't mean just get out and go go to wash and clean up well you should do that you know that you see but I'm talking about humility genuine humility not something that is put on something that is that's real humility Jesus told us how to do it overcome means to stand the test stand the test overcome means God's going to send test our way and it's important that we pass it you see what I'm saying and that goes for you all you teenagers as well all of y'all amen stand the test mamas and daddies all of us we all need to stand the test he say that's right like the old Saints did like Jesus did like amongst uh uh amongst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being Messiah and he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the word destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days the word said so in the presence of death he defeated it he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the Grave he overcome the grave why all by the word and humility there's the real man there's the one to make your example he defeated everything and overcome it can you say Amen how many wants to have how many wants that promise amen what what what's that scripture honor your your your your your father and your mother for this is the first commandment with promise promise that if I take this and I subject myself I will become great in the eyes of God He Who abases himself God exalts if the musicians would come well this took me a little bit longer to get through I thought I could get through that in 30 45 minutes [Music] amen what what did I I need I need an amen or a standing ovation or something amen [Applause] Hallelujah I love all of our young and I'm so stinking proud of all of you and how God's grace I I I think of how proud I am and I can I can just only imagine how proud God must be of y'all I found and I was a mildy i my mother contest attest that I was a mildy fellow but you all know what I what what I found as a kid is when I found my nature was so contrary when I when I was just constantly having to bite my tongue and when I was just constantly making my mama cry I was just you know what that done for me it drove me to prayer as a boy that that's when I learned to really pray because I knew it wasn't pleasing to the Lord and I knew that I deeply loved my mother I didn't want to see her cry I didn't want to hurt her feelings and I sure didn't want to hear my dad get known to me for making my mama cry you know what I done that's when me in [Music] Jesus started a relationship that's when I really got serious with God said Lord help me and mama can tell you as a kid I did I spent hours in prayer as a boy a lot of people thought that I was just trying to be spiritual oh no oh no there was a lot of rebellion in me there was a lot of junk in me as a kid and there was something in me that wanted to please the Lord and I would I would go to the church on a daily basis I would go by myself all the time and I would just say God help me I would walk up and down i' I'd want to pour my hair out at times said God help me because I knew God give me the boundaries I respected that I knew my parents loved me I knew what they were trying to do for me and my will was screaming out but did you know what God done for me God helped me as a little boy and it began to mold character in me and begin to teach me and what I learned there as a kid is something that I have built upon in my adult life learned how to humble myself I learned how to say I'm wrong I learned how to say sorry I learned how to rise above [Music] it I've learned that if I'm anything it will be because he's pleasing with me I've made a lot of money I've lost a lot of money I've had nice things just to see him go to [Music] rest for me things are not important there's one thing that I want to [Music] hear I want to hear my daddy my heavenly daddy say I'm well pleased I want to hear him welcome me home I want to hear him say job well done son that's what I want to hear that's what I'm
