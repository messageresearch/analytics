redeemed I stand redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I stand redeemed before The Great I Am when he looks at me he sees the nails godhe that brought my Liberty I and redeemed praise the Lord praise the Lord he's the reason that we can stand redeemed he's the reason that we're able to stand at all amen let's go ahead and take up our Bibles and we're going to turn to Ruth chapter 3 Ruth chapter 3 and we're going to start at verse 10 and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou Hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou follows not young men whether poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman let's turn to Proverbs chapter 31 proverbs 31 and verse 10 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies Lord Jesus we come into your presence this evening Lord and Lord I pray that you would just Lord take control Lord you you see the the thoughts that I've been going over lord the a few scriptures and and quotes that I've put together but Lord I want you to be the one to to take control in the service Lord to to minister what needs to be said Lord may you just Lord use my lips use my voice Lord may I only say what you would want me to say Lord may you hold me back from saying anything that I shouldn't Lord and Lord may it just be something that would Minister to the hearts and the needs of your people Lord Lord we thank you for being here Lord we thank you for your presence Lord and we just commit the remainder of this service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may all have your seats that verse in Proverbs if you read from the Amplified version it says an excellent woman one who spiritual capable intelligent and virtuous who is he who can find her her value is more precious than jewels and her worth is far above rubies or pearls now the ver word virtuous means having or showing high moral standards if you actually go back to uh the archaic use for it it's also uh was normally used to uh be understood as someone that was chased now brother brandom says in the sermon Blas Blasphemous names he says I believe there is a bride that's predestinated I believe God said he would have a church without spot or wrinkle I believe in predestination that the bride is predestinated she's got to be there I hope I'm with her that see I'm with her now it's up to me to work out my own salvation with God until these things are approved of God and then sealed into the kingdom of God there is the holy spirit there is the genuine works of God it's sealed until the day of redemption and we know that brother brandham taught that the bride comes out of the church the bride is the called The Chosen the elect for the end time and so when you look at scriptures that are talking about uh about a virtuous woman talking about a woman of of quality woman of high moral character you can take those and we can apply them to our sisters and we can go into teaching about this is what it means to be a Godly woman but that's so those same things will apply to the bride of Christ those same lessons that you would take that you would hold on as this is what it means to be a Godly woman is also going to be very much the same lessons that would apply to what it means to be part of the Bride what it means to be part of the bride of Christ and so let's turn to Luke chapter 15 Luke chapter 15 and we're going to start at verse eight says either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she ha found it she calleth her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I found the peace which I had lost likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth now in the sermon the second coming of the Lord that was preached in 57 brother brandom says Jesus Christ God's son likened this he said to a woman in our subject tonight we find this woman her husband is gone and she lost one of the coins out of her tablet now I'll try to explain that today if a woman is a married she would wear a wedding ring as a sign that she's married that's to keep other men from having anything to do with her they look and they see she's a married woman in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet they called it a tablet they put on their head it had 10 coins and it went around their head and that was a sign they were a married woman and no man was to fool with them no boys to flirt with them they were married each one of those coins if we only have time I could tell you what each one of those coins meant it was placed in there and each coin meant a certain virtue of that woman the first meaning her love to her husband the second her pledge of virtue to live clean for him and the third and fourth and fifth on to the 9th and 10th if if you want to look it up look in Galatians 5 you'll find out that the woman represented the church and the church is an espouse wife to Christ and the tablet the church is supposed to wear is found in Galatians 5 which is love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience that is the tablet that's supposed to be worn in the church Brotherly Love kindness Fellowship now as I was looking and and researching in into this a little bit I found that they say that normally these pieces would be approximately the size of a quarter in most cases uh each coin would have the the coat of arms or the symbol of the husband's family if the husband had come from a family that was known to be Shepherds then maybe there would be a a a sheep that was stamped onto it or if they were a family that uh they grew olives and maybe there would be an olive tree or something on it or if they grew grapes or they did this or they did that there would be some type of symbol on there that signified this was part of the family there were then those that would say that uh you know that they they would actually have on their on the other side they would sometimes stamp the year that the coin had been made and they were they were not normally known as them El being of immense value the coin itself was not something that you would normally take in and hey this is what it's going to be a huge amount of money I can take it down to the pawn shop and get a lot for it but it had a powerful representation to it it was something that it was one of the women of this time period were a lot of times given many jewels and Jewelry by their husbands it was a common gift that they were getting and because of the laws of that time the jewelry that she was given was completely her property even if they were to get divorced all of the jewelry that she had received was her property to take with her except for this this if her husband were to die if they were to be divorced it had to be returned back to the husband's family family because this was everything that went through that Heritage and it was also everything that was represented in what was expected of this woman these were the type of things that they were not worn commonly this was not something that she would wear because they got invited to dinner at The Neighbors this is not something that she would wear as she's around the house cleaning this is not something that she would wear for just any type of occasion this was something that she would only bring out in the most special times for the most special events that she would take this out because it was also representative that if she were caught in some type of trouble if she were caught doing something that she wasn't supposed to while her husband was away she could be taken down to the priest and the priest would take away the coin that represented the flaw that she had so if we had this is the coin that represents her love for her husband she's been found in the arms of another man I'm going to take that coin away so when the husband came back first off he knew exactly what type of betrayal had happened without anyone even telling him simply because the coin was gone all that was left was these nine instead of the 10 or these eight instead of the 10 or whatever it might be and so this had a lot of symbolic value and so when we look at it from the Western perspective of the idea of she lost a silver coin okay why did she then throw a party when she found it she invited all the neighbors because this was a big deal and even the neighbors would be like oh no she's going to be a shamed woman if she can't find this if she can't find the coin that she's supposed to have if she can't find what's supposed to be in her tablet in her headdress in whatever term you want to use for it it's not going to be there and her husband will have every right to put her out and in fact in the what I the different articles that I was reading about it it said he wouldn't divorce her but he would basically banish her from the house until the coin was found she would not be allowed to live in the home until the coin was found to bring back if she lost it now if it had been taken because she went to the priest and they took it away because of her doing something that could lead to divorcement but if she just lost in the house he had ever right to throw her out of the house until she found it to come back this was not something that was taken lightly in this and while these coins may not have been the most valuable jewelry she possessed they may not have been uh the most expensive item that she owned in most in really every other way they were the most precious thing that she had another place that I about it it said that this was something that she would have even before the wedding that would be in her possession and anytime that she was thinking about her betro anytime she was thinking about him they would take them out and they would begin to to rub them and polish them and so at the wedding how shiny they were was a direct reflection of how much she loved her husband the more she had thought about him the more that she had been thinking about him before the day of the actual ceremony the more time she would have spent polishing and cleaning them where if she showed up on that day and they were kind of dull and dingy it was immediately an indication that she didn't actually care for the husband that much there's a lot of ways we can go into this but as we're looking at it and brother brandom talks about this being a type of the fruit of the Spirit our love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance we could bring that up be like so how often are we pulling those out and polishing them how often are we making sure that we're displaying all those things so that when we would step into the ceremony are they going to be as shiny as they should be are we going to have wiped off all the dust are we going to have made sure that they were in use the way that they're supposed to be let's turn to Revelations chap 21 Revelations chapter 21 and verse two and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their god let's drop down to verse N9 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light was like unto a stone most precious even a jasper stone clear as Crystal when we look at that in verse two it says it was prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now obviously we think about the all the the garments that go with it going you know from our western side going it has the the wedding dress just right and everything fixed up but yet at the same time when we tie that back into the tablet that we talked about earlier she has on display all of the coins that she's supposed to have as she's dressed as the bride adorned for her husband this would have been one of the things that she would have worn to the wedding that's one of those important events that she would have worn it for you know maybe she would have worn it then for 25th anniversary or 50th Anniversary those kind of things but she has those coins on display she has those fruits of the spirit on display to all for all to see see this is not something that's that's hidden away this is not something that uh is just in her pocket this isn't the uh the something old that the bride carry is hidden away in her pocket you know so that way she has all the different what is it old new blue and whatever um yeah borrow there we go um this isn't okay I've got to make sure I have all these different things like no this is proudly on display to make sure that everyone can see and these coins would while May might they might not have been the most expensive jewelry she owned they at the same time were also a reflection of the wealth of her husband's family okay so they could be more precious they often weren't the most expensive item she owned but if she was marrying into the right family maybe they were the most precious thing she owned maybe they were and if you're going in and you're marrying the King of Kings they're probably the most precious thing that you have is if you have all of them on display brother brandham says in the sermon the choosing of a bride he says when God gave man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of salvation but when one goes to trying to to take a man's place that's when she's about the worst thing he could get a hold of in recognizing your day and his message brother brandom says and remember the vision of last week that when the bride came to the preview of it there came up that little bride lovely in the vision and I not thinking about it just sitting there watching outside and there Comes the Bride I Heard a Voice by the side of me said here is the preview of the bride and she came by I noticed her the way she was a very lovely pretty young she was walking just as step as she could not a March just in the stride of a woman how they walk gracefully ladylike that's the way she was walking coming to my left on this side and she went out of my sight in the sermon recognizing your day and its message he says did you notice the fall of the world begin with the immorality of a woman did you know it's to the end the same way the immorality of the woman and the church represents is by a woman the church is a woman spiritually speaking so is the bride a woman spiritually speaking the immorality of the church how it's done look at the Visions look at the things see the Visions even that God gives and the vision is true I have my Bible over my heart to you people on tape the audience can see it I saw that God Almighty knows the truth never known it till just now there she is naked and don't know it she was just having her great time there you there you are but when the little Bride come in view it was different and in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says what a sacred trust what responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to the prayer and to the word and to Christ just the same as the woman has dropping a little bit further down in that same sermon he says she's a type she has the same precious virtues by Spirit give given to her to preserve the spirit and the word and never commit adultery with anything of the world or anything stay virgin to the word as a woman is to stay virtuous to her husband it's a sacred trust to honor her Lord's word above every man-made Creed wisdom denomination there is the church has given that trust now Proverbs it said who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies saying very clearly that this is something that's rare this is something that's valuable this is not something that is found just everywhere they're not found just laying on the sidewalk as you're going around around this is something that you have to to search for because of its Rarity if you go to Proverbs chap 20: 6-7 it says most men will Proclaim everyone his own goodness but a faithful man who can find the just man walketh in his Integrity his children are blessed after him and so the same thing is brought up in Proverbs referencing the man so this isn't just singling out the woman but going a faithful man who can find they didn't describe it with gems and everything but just still asking the same question who can find this this is this is a rarity this is not something that you that you find everywhere this is something that is special when it comes out this is something that stands out as being something that's important because it's different now let's go back to Proverbs chapter 31 we're going to start at verse 10 and just read down for a ways here Proverbs chapter 31 and and verse 10 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ship she bringeth her food from afar she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she considerthe it with the fruit of her hand she planteth a Vineyard she girth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yay she reacheth forth her hands to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with Scarlet she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sth among the Elders of the land she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she open her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she lookth well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates now this has become a pretty common scripture for people to reference there are far more commentaries on this than I could would ever begin to count or talk about there are so many that are written to women on this is how to be the Proverbs 31 Woman this is what you do yeah there's more than we can talk about with it because it's there for everything and just in a little bit of looking because I was curious almost everyone that I found said now don't be afraid this probably seems like such a high bar to set that you're going to start off feeling like you're a failure not quite in those words but that's pretty much how most of them start off it's like you're going to read through this and go wow I don't fit that I have zero interest in preaching at the sisters we're sticking to the type of the Bride here thank you but as we go through this so as the start we've already talked about you know who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies this is someone that is rare there's a value here there's a a quality to it that's not to be expected verses 11 and 12 talk about how she is so trustworthy the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life I had to dive into a little bit to try to get the idea of what it meant when it said so he'll have no need of spoil she's TR trustworthy he's going to have no need of spoil what is that even mean sometimes the old English doesn't translate quite so well basically it's the idea of spoil is what you would get when you win a battle when you go to take something and basically what they saying is she's able to provide everything that he has need of he has no need to go to some other source he has no need to go somewhere else this is the woman that he can fully trust this is the woman that he uh that is there to fully help him to fully take care of him to fully support him he has no need to look for anything else and yes you can look at that in the physical side but then you also look as the bride of Christ is the part partner that God created that God is calling us to be he's not going oh well I need to get this from that church and I need to get this from that church and this from that church it's no this is my bride this is where I'm have everything that I need this is where I'm going to get all the worship that I need all the Adoration that I need all the fellowship that I need comes from My bride I don't have to get it from this place or that place I get everything from from My bride this bride is is trustworthy she is faithful Luke 16:10 says he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much Revelations 17 and verse1 14 says these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful as we continue down this proverbs 31 we go into verse 13 she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ship she bringeth her food from afar this this bride is industrious she's hardworking she's not not lazy she's not just laying around and saying God you do every single thing I'm going to lay here and eat grapes and watch soap operas cuz you can handle everything she's a worker now she's still trusting her husband to provide but she's faithful she's industrious she's hardworking verse 15 it says she riseth also while it is yet night she gets up before the sun gets up I'm going to look at my kids for a minute they get up early and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she consider a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a Vineyard she girth her loins with strength and strengthen her arms she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she riseth early while it's yet night and then during the night she stays up because otherwise why would you leave the candle lit so she's still up working she's not lazy in any sense of the word she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the dis staff in Philippians 2: 14-15 it says says do all things without murmuring and disputing that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world Galatians 6 and9 says and let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not God calls his his bride to be working he calls us to be active he calls calls us to be doing different things he's not calling a woman that would fall into the old Greek lifestyle where the women just sat around the house and had all the servants to do everything and didn't necessarily have to do a whole lot God's going no I want a woman that is truly my helpmate that is right there beside me working that is doing the different things that is trying to take care of the fields and take care of the house and take care of the children and take care of whatever we want to talk about I'm looking for a bride and once again very clear I'm not pointing at sisters sisters can take it yes but this is for all the brothers because we're all part of the Bride here and God's calling all of us to be working to be industrious he's calling us to be working in the fields for him amen verse 20 she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yay she reacheth forth her hands to the needy his bride is caring she's loving she cares about those around her John 13:34 it says a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my my disciples if you have love one to another back to verse 21 it says she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with Scarlet She's Not Afraid of the cold she's made sure that the household is well clothed that they have everything they need to stand against the elements nowadays great the kids all have good winter jackets we're set you know we've got uh there's we've got good Heat Going we've got all these different things the family's taken care of the children are secure the family is secure she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple they're focusing on the idea of the the silk and purple because this is showing that she's able to get the quality she's able to get it's not because we're wanting to be out there in super bright colors all the time but she's going for the quality and taking care of her family she's making sure that everything is there so as the bride when we're looking at our brothers and sisters are we helping to take care of them the way that we should are we helping to care for those around us to show that love are we doing our part looking around us verse 23 her husband is known in the gates when he sth among the Elders of the land you know it's interesting to me in all this listing here it talks about her husband but it doesn't actually talk about what the husband does and so a lot of this what I get from it is the idea that the husband's reputation is only increased or improve d by his bride they look at the bride and they think better of the husband because of the quality that is is that is in the bride because of what they've seen because of how they've seen her work because of how they've seen her act because of how they've seen her handle different things they immediately have a higher opinion of the husband before they even meet him before they've even before they even really know him just from the bride they have a better thought of what kind of character the husband has because he chose the bride and so if he chose a bride of this character then that means that his character must also be at a certain level the sociologist Rodney Stark noted in his book the rise of Christianity that Christian Courage in the face of death particularly caught the attention of the pagans Christians were not only willing to die for their faith through persecution but they also accepted the risk of disease to care for the sick even when they had been abandoned by their families they cared for the poor Christian and Pagan alike and they treated women children and slaves with great dignity including recovering abandoned newborns I found this when I was just researching the testimony of that first church as they were going going out and they're going into this Roman world and what was it that would stand out I know that in sermons before I've talked about what it meant to go the Second Mile this was actually something that the Christian Church would do there was Roman law that a Roman soldier could compel somebody to carry their pack for one mile the law allowed one mile at the end of one mile you could set the pack down and walk away you didn't have to keep going but yet the Christians of the time would purposely go no I'm now going to go a second mile because now it's I'm no longer being compelled it's now I'm no longer doing it because the law told me to do I'm now doing it of my free will I'm now choosing to serve you my enemy the person that hates me I'm choosing to go another mile continue to carry your pack for you to continue to carry your equipment and it's by these types of things that we see in our lives and our witness that so many would be converted to Christ it was because of how they saw the bride acting it was because of how they saw the chosen acting and it's the same thing today most people aren't converted simply because they sat down somewhere and decided to read the Bible you know they're at a hotel room they found that whoever Gideon Bible in the in the night stand they decided to read it and went oh man I should accept Christ that I'm sure that happens occasionally but that's not the common way normally it's because they've seen someone's life they've seen the way you act they've seen the way you act on the job site they've seen the way that you act as you go through trials as you go through struggles as you go through problems and they realize that because of the quality of the Bride they would really like to get to know the groom because of the quality of the Bride they can see that there's now something about the groom that they want to know about they may have never met the groom before they may have never known anything about him but because of the quality of the Bride because of the character that is there the reputation of the groom is now increased the reputation of the groom at least in their eyes we all know our Lord is the king of kings Lord of lords his reputation can't go any higher but in their eyes in that person's eyes they didn't necessarily see them see our Lord as king of kings and Lord of lords but because of your life because of how you've acted because of how you've handled different things because of how you've lived they look and go their something different there's something about this that is now elevating the groom in their eyes and to me that's the piece that you see here as you go her husband is known in the gate I don't know what her husband does I don't know anything about his history you don't know anything about what family he came from you don't know anything about him but yet because of the character of his wife it's immediately assumed and held up that the character of her husband has to be at this level for this character for the Character level of this woman her husband must be a judge in the gate he must be one of the elders he must be one of the respected one of the valued one of the top tier and all of that's being found simply because they're looking at the bride and going this is is her quality well obviously her husband must be of this quality as well she maketh fine linen and sth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchant strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she lookth well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness she gets up early she stays up late and she doesn't eat the bread of idleness like we already said she's a worker she's doing what needs to be done she's one that her husband can trust in her he can trust in from this obviously he can trust in the decisions she's making cuz she's going out and buying fields and buying Vineyards and doing these different things there's a quality there and the husband can have faith in her because he knows her quality he knows that her desires are the same as his desires the desires that he has for growing the family bettering the family doing these different things are those same desires within her she's working towards the same goals she's ultimately the Homemaker the mother the the helpmate to him and when we look at our relationship with Christ those are so many of the different things that we're called to in the simp way we're called to be showing his care and his love to the world around us we're called to be working in the world around us we're called to be ministering to those around us to helping take care of the family to help take care of what's going on and brother bham talked about the fact that having a bride to the point that when she speaks she's speaking his words she's speaking with the same Authority that he has and he can trust her with that Authority because she has the same Desir she's going for the same goal she has the same Target in mind as what the husband does she's going for the same the same thing she's not out going hey I'm going to grow my my own little world my own little whatever it's I'm working with my Lord to achieve this her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her her husband also and he praiseth her that's the place that we're called to as the bride we should be living in such a way that it's so much like the story of Job where God can go to Satan and go hey have you seen my bride down on earth have you seen brother Michael and brother Donald the way that they're living have you seen the testimony that they have with everything you keep throwing at them that's still my bride and that's still the way that she's living that's still the way that she's standing as everything's coming against her as you're throwing everything you can as brother brandom said with every gun of Hell trained on us and yet God can still go there and praise her and go this is my bride this is the quality that I've chosen this is the one that I have chosen that I have selected to live this kind of life to live out in Satan's eaten to live out in the darkest age and yet her husband can still praise her can still praise her for the way she's living for the decision she's making for the action that she's taking this isn't some type of low calling this isn't some type of oh B you know we can hit this any time this is high level we are called to be so much and we're called to H move with that same heart same decision making that God has to go when this is what hey this is what I decide I'm going to do it should be because we know that's the kind of thing God would want us to do it's not about going hey this is what I'm going to do for my own pleasure for a few moments this is how I'm going to go enjoy my life for whatever season it's about no this is what my Lord would want me to do this is the kind of field he would want me to buy this is the kind of work he would want me to do this is the kind of people he would want me to be around this is the kind of testimony he would want me to have but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised it ties in so well with her husband also and he praiseth her because a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised and the same thing we can switch it and a man that fearth the Lord he will be praised as part of the Bride this these aren't instructions that only go to the sisters that are in the crowd this isn't going hey the Proverbs 31 Woman This is for women only guys we can cut that chapter right out of the book we don't even have to read it it's not important to us no the type is still there we are still the bride of Christ in the spiritual side we still fall in the feminine and so we can still take these same verses and go hey I can learn some lessons from here and those lessons tie right in with all the rest of scripture so we're not looking at something new that we've never read anywhere else before Matthew chapter 22 verse 36 Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets I was talking with my Sunday school class this morning as we were Beginning to Look At The Ten Commandments and when you take the Ten Commandments and start to look at them ultimately if you take these two Commandments it covers the others The Ten Commandments are more detailed but if I love the Lord God with all my heart with all my soul with all my mind I'm not going to have any other gods before him because I love him completely I'm not going to make any Idols because I love him completely I want to worship him I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that because I love him completely and then you go into the verses of Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not covet this that or the other well if I love my neighbor as myself then I'm not going to go take brother Donald's lawn mower CU I love brother Donald I don't want to take his lawn mower I'm not going to go take one of brother Williams fishing rods I know he likes to fish so I'm going to make sure he has his fishing rods I'm not going to go and do these different things I'm not going to sit there and go man I really wish I had brother Williams dog those those three cute puppies I man I wish I had one of those instead of my big old thing because we love our brothers and our sisters as ourselves if I love God with all my heart with all my mind if I love love my brothers and sisters as I love the rest of it suddenly gets real easy the law of Love covers so much of it real quick and so when a woman or a man fears the lord loves the Lord with all their heart with all their mind with all their soul they are going to be elevated to a certain place because the character if you love God then you know I should be up and working I should be up and doing these different things I should be not spending 12 hours in bed I should be up about my tasks I should be living my life a certain way I should be having a witness I should be making sure that when I'm on the job site that I'm carrying my myself in the right way that I'm not blowing my top at every single little thing that comes along that I'm not allowing myself to get caught up in the music that's being played by other Crews that are there or this that or the other hey I work at Chick-fil-A in the kitchen they've got their speaker where they have their music playing that is not the nice Christian music that we play out in the dining room for everybody that's not awful or anything we have very clear guidelines but it's not just the typical Christian music and so I can go back there and I can hear some of the old country music that I used to listen to coming through sometimes I can hear some different contemporary songs that I used to know or this that or the other as I'm walking back and forth being a Chick-fil-A doesn't make me immune to what the guys run into on the job site sometime but God calls us to live it a certain way God's calling us to to be living out A Life That's a testimony so when people look at us we are that salt we are that light that's attracting them that they're going hey I want what you have I want to know how you got what you've got I want to know what makes you different why do you act different for the Sisters why do you dress different we're called to be in a place where it's noticeable you know when you read through this description of the Proverbs 31 Woman just reading through the description you know it's noticeable whoever was around her would know she's probably acting different than some of her neighbors if all her neighbors acted the same way that was a really good neighborhood that's where I want to live but she set an example she set a standard in the way that she was walking and the way that she was carrying herself and the things that she was doing and the way that her children treated her and respected her in the way that her husband treated her and respected her people could look at it and know okay there's something that's different here I mean ultimately this is the one where I'll jump into the marriage for just a minute husbands our wives are not doormats we don't get to command them around and do whatever we want it's not the way it works that's right because that's not the way that God treats us and he's our example as a husband yes sir the value that he places on us as the bride is the same kind of value that we should be placing on our Brides as we look at them people will look at our sisters and the way they dress the way most of them are stay-at-home moms and all these kind of different things and they'll go well you're not letting them do what they should do you're not letting them have the opportunity to go into the world and have jobs to do this that or the other we're going I don't know about for every sister here I know for my wife this is what she wants to do it's made my life real easy she wants to be at home taking care of the kid she wants when we first got married before we had kids I would have been fully okay if she had wanted to work when we first got married I mean it was an empty house she can only clean it so many times there's only two of us not not going to get that dirty but she didn't want to she was like I want to be at home I want to be a homemaker and obviously she wanted to have kids probably not quite as many but you know the Lord had plans but this was her this was her desire this was her desire when she got out of school I mean her first job was she worked at a daycare because she wanted to take care of children this is where her heart was and so in no way are any of us as husbands going hey we're going to stamp out our wives dreams and they're going to be our servants and they're going to do whatever it's no these are our rubies these are our Treasures yes sir this is our bride and when Christ looks at each one of us and goes that's my bride we're not living a life where hey I love the way that it's put is that I've heard different ones say it's like hey I go to the bar and I drink just as much as I want to I go and I use just as many illicit drugs as I want to God just took the want to away so I don't want to I'm not living a certain way because this is rules and regulations that okay I have to make sure I live within this we live that way because we know that it's what our Lord wants and we want to serve our Lord we want to be living for him we want to be at the point where the decisions we make immediately tie in with his guidelines we want it to be that my desires fit completely within his desires so so that I can be to the point where I can be trusted like brother brandom was with certain things or like had he right was to have that power of the spoken word God could give that to Hatty rright because he knew he could trust her with what she would ask brother Brandon we've read it through sermon after sermon that she could have asked for a million dollars she could have asked for this she could have asked for that and she would have gotten it because it had just been given to her but God knew that he could give that to her because her desire was correct and that she was going to Beed go I want their salvation that's more important than anything else how many of us could be in that exact same spot and God could go yes I absolutely know I can trust this brother this sister with that exact same thing there are days where I can definitely say God couldn't trust me with that I will admit I'm not I'm trying not to be gentle on myself either there are days where I know he couldn't trust me with that if he just went speak it and it'll happen it's not not going to be a good thing but we want to be at the point where God could trust us with that that God could go down and could go over and go brother John speak it and he would know that your desire and your heart are beating at the exact same place that his is and so what you speak is going to be what he wants be what he wants to have happen and each one of us that's the place that we're called to be we're called to be this bride that is living so close to God that is him living through US him speaking through US him taking control so that our desires are his desires and then yes he can hand over the credit card or checkbook or whichever one you want to call it and know that we're going to only be spending and claiming what he wants us to in the leoty in church age brother brandom says a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown said the wisest man on earth a man ought to honor a good woman see but an evil one is water and his blood and his blood is his life you men that's got good wives you don't know how you ought to thank God for a good wife for if God could have given man anything better for a helpmate he'd have done it but a woman is the best helpmate that God could give a man in the second coming of the Lord he says could you imagine coming in at night time tired weary worn if you're a farmer mechanic preacher whatever you are come in when you go into your little home you're you're longing till you can get there you open the door and a sweet little wife stands there she greets you she's all pretty and cleaned up she walks over kisses you on the cheek and says Dad you're tired she sits you down in a chair she sets herself down on your lap she puts her arms around you and she Pats you it just seems like then that you're not tired something picks you up it's something that God gave you for that purpose it's a part of you now if she's a true wife in the sermon speak to the Rock brother brandom says oh I think of that I think of it in in Genesis when when God made the Sun and made the moon now the Moon is the wife of the sun now when the Sun goes away the Moon reflects the light of the sun is that right on the earth and now when Jesus was taken away we are the bride which is the Moon to reflect the light of the gospel and we can't reflect it until he Shines on us amen well when when the gospel goes to shining on us then we shine it out so send the light Lord is my prayer that we can reflect the light of the Son of God in his power and his resurrection and his fullness how marvelous and in questions and answers law having a shadow brother brandom says now and the moon and when the sun has gone down the moon shines you can call me it but I look to see something moov moving look in the creation all things typed and patterned some night I get to preaching I have a few nights of this I just feel like I could just move on and on and on see just to see how it begins to jump up in front of you you know when the Holy Spirit bringing and hanging up there for you to see all the things of Shadows and types when God made the heavens and earth he made the moon to shine in the absence of the sun to give light while the sun was gone see a beautiful type of Christ in the church the church is the Moon to give the light to the world while the sun is gone see what I mean a lesser light amen and then otherwise the moon and the sun is husband and wife as Christ in the church is husband and wife the wife being the weaking weaker vessel only giving a smaller light in the absence of her husband and the church can only make manifestations of the Holy Spirit remember the moon cannot give any light of her own and when you see the Moonlight it's not the Moonlight it's the reflection of the sunlight and Christ ascended up is that right and shineth his light on the church to reflect his light and power to the world in his absence see what I mean Revelations 22 and verse 17 says and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely as the musicians come in the sermon it is the rising of the Sun and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is the Flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power power of his power she is him a man and a woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken the spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics until the church or the people all these Easter bunnies and ceremonies and big churches and finery will fail and pass away until that church becomes both Dynam Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hid on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him charge of my damic of my Dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day that's the Easter message the Dynamics and mechanics together the mechanics without the Dynamics no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics the Dynamics and mechanics together I wanted to minister tonight on a virtuous [Music] woman God has called us to a bride that is the epitome of a virtuous woman we're virtuous because we've been washed in his blood we're virtuous because he paid the price for us so that everything we did wrong is washed away and it's gone and so now we can stand there holy and pure to go into that archaic definition that I talked out before we can stand there completely chased we can stand there showing the high moral standards and living a life that's a witness living a life that is the same kind of witness that you've seen down through all the ages where people would look at the Christians and know there was something different that they would look at the Christians and that would Point them to the Savior the life that was being lived before them would make them want to look for the groom the life that the bride lives is what draws to the groom we're not trying to point to ourselves we're not trying to build our own platforms we're not trying to make ourselves be anything special but everything we do points back to the groom and we can read through the Proverbs 31 Woman and we can go through every single thing that she did that set her apart as being [Music] special as long as we have the understanding that that applies to the bride as well that God doesn't lay these out in the scriptures for no reason he doesn't lay them out for even normally just a singular reason most verses have multiple things that you can learn from them and as he lays this out and goes through the different lessons of what it means to be a virtuous [Music] woman he is looking at you and he is saying you are rare you are valuable you are trustworthy you are caring you are loving you are industrious and hardworking you are a homemaker you are the helpmate you are everything [Music] that he could want he desires to have that relationship he desires to have that communication back and forth with us so that we can fully enter into his desires and living a life that is only living out what he wants us to [Music] he's calling us and we talk about it all the time that we're his bride and we're talking all the time about different ways to try to explain what that means and what that represents and you could Minister on virtuous woman in so many different angles you could Minister on the bride in so many different angles but in my own stumbling way to just point to God is calling us to live a life that points everyone back to him that one verse was the one that when I read through it just stood out so much to me the fact that her husband is at the gates but the scripture doesn't talk about what her husband does doesn't talk about what place he has doesn't talk about any of those but yet his reputation is affected by the way that she's living and the way that we live is what draws the attention to him we know that there are so many people in the world that they have been hurt in churches they have been hurt by people they have been hurt by different things and they then take on a lower expectation they take on a lower look at what God is or what God represents well the same way that that kind of Life can affect it how much can the life that's lived by the truly virtuous bride if the mistakes of people and the things that they've done wrong can make someone look lower at it then how much more can the truly virtuous bride living the life that God's called her to live Elevate and draw attention to the Savior that's what we're called to do we're called here to be here working we're called to be here living for him but all of that working and all that living is to simply be pointing back to Christ to go he's the reason he's the reason we live the way that we do he's the reason that our lives are different he's the reason that we don't just get messed up in everything that the world gets messed up in like brother William said he's the reason he got pulled out of the bars and he's not there anymore that's the reason that brother John got pulled out of his stuff that's the reason that brother Caleb got pulled out of his stuff and every single one of us can go down and go I got pulled out of this and I got pulled out of this because of my savior and so we don't stand here pointing and going see how great I am I overcame this see how great I am I can now lead you through a 12-step program on how to get rid of this or get rid of that we stand here and go no we only have a one-step program Christ that is our program yes sir we don't have this long list we don't have anything but everything we do every moment that we're here on Earth We're supposed to be pointing back to him and everything in our life is designed to draw attention back to him Lord Jesus Lord we come before you Lord and Lord I know that this isn't a screaming yelling excitable sermon this isn't well there's so many things this isn't but Lord this is just a moment for us to take inventory Lord for us to look at how we're living and and what we're called to [Music] Lord Lord we thank you Lord I Thank you for having called me Lord for having chosen me for having placed me as as a member of your bride Lord [Music] Jesus Lord help me not to to take it lightly to not take it for granted Lord Jesus but Lord may it be something that I place value on every single day Lord every single moment
