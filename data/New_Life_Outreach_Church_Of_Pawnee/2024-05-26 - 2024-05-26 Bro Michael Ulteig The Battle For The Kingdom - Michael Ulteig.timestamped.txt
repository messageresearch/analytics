[33:35] [Music]
[33:49] I sounds like we got some
[33:52] [Music]
[33:54] Thunder praise the lord it's good to see
[33:56] everybody
[33:59] nervous as a is it not
[34:05] working brother W puts it over here like
[34:07] this it
[34:10] helps
[34:15] well is that
[34:21] better well I'm nervous just about as
[34:24] nervous as a young man was up here
[34:29] but it's good to be in the house of the
[34:31] Lord it's good to be here in Pon
[34:34] e this is the this is the God's provided
[34:39] place and when all the storms and the
[34:42] tornadoes and everything comes through
[34:44] here it seems like we got a little Haven
[34:47] of Rest right here and get protected so
[34:51] uh it's kind of like being in Goan so we
[34:54] know that that we're protected and it's
[34:57] not not just necessarily by the way the
[34:59] land lays and the rivers flow and the
[35:01] hills are but we believe it's God's over
[35:05] us
[35:07] am I just want to thank brother Wendell
[35:10] for inviting me here to to deliver my
[35:14] heart and um I'll have to keep the
[35:17] advice of my
[35:19] wife on the frontlets of my brain don't
[35:23] try to tell them everything you know in
[35:25] one service so uh we're going to try to
[35:29] hold things down that's what she used to
[35:31] tell me when I'd go out she'd say now
[35:34] Michael she said you don't have to tell
[35:36] them everything you know in in one
[35:38] service so I was explaining to some it's
[35:42] kind of hard especially for a a pastor
[35:46] or Minister that's been preaching on on
[35:49] a series and then you got things spread
[35:52] out and then when you try to condense it
[35:55] into to one service
[35:59] it uh it gets kind of mind rcking and
[36:03] because it's like chewing on a piece of
[36:05] gristle it just at first it's just so
[36:08] nice and then the more you get your
[36:11] notes together the more it starts
[36:13] scattering out and then you get
[36:15] scattered out and then you get nervous
[36:17] and then you feel like crying and then
[36:19] you feel like saying we ain't
[36:22] coming so we just have
[36:25] to look to the Lord and depend on him
[36:28] just like we do in our daily lives the
[36:31] same faith that it takes for you to rise
[36:34] up in the
[36:35] morning and face the challenges of the
[36:38] hours the same faith it takes to come to
[36:40] a
[36:41] Pulpit and deliver your heart that's
[36:45] right so we just pray that that God will
[36:48] be with us this
[36:50] morning and we pray that the I think the
[36:53] wedding is today isn't
[36:55] iter yesterday so they're over the hump
[36:59] and today is a day of Celebration and
[37:02] and they can relax and uh we just thank
[37:07] God
[37:09] for for men and women that are willing
[37:12] to face the
[37:13] challenge of marriage and not like the
[37:16] rest of the world just going out there
[37:19] and living haphazardly and no
[37:21] responsibility that's right but God has
[37:24] given us a gift that's right of marriage
[37:27] and the gift of marriage is is the
[37:30] children that we have so we thank God
[37:33] for that God wanted children we want
[37:37] children Satan's you know he wants
[37:40] children but in this world it seems like
[37:44] they just don't have time for for babies
[37:47] they want children but they they want
[37:49] them at the age that they want them they
[37:51] don't want to go through the through the
[37:54] trials and tribulation of raising
[37:56] children
[37:57] but it's part of the victory we have and
[38:01] it's what they need in life is is
[38:03] parents God designed a family to have a
[38:06] mother and a
[38:07] father and mother and father were
[38:09] designed to have
[38:11] children because God wanted to be a
[38:14] father and God is also our mother
[38:19] elhadi and he wanted children and he
[38:22] wanted to raise the children he just
[38:24] didn't want to have children and set
[38:26] them out
[38:28] so we are the children this
[38:31] morning and we're we're the apple of his
[38:34] eye that's right and I read in the
[38:38] scriptures and remember when brother
[38:41] Brandon was talking about the young
[38:43] eaglets they were playing down there in
[38:45] the in the valley in the
[38:48] field mama was perched up high and and
[38:53] keeping their eye on
[38:55] them and you know they could they could
[38:57] look down there on the ground and See
[38:59] Your
[39:00] Shadow and that's comforting for you and
[39:04] I to dwell in his
[39:07] Shadows but then one day I was I was
[39:10] reading in the Psalms and David talked
[39:14] about that great mother eagle and he
[39:17] talked
[39:18] about feeling the
[39:20] feathers come on so we don't want just a
[39:23] shadow experience that's a good
[39:25] experience because that brings us to the
[39:29] to the knowledge of his presence and
[39:31] that he is a living God in the present
[39:33] help in the time of
[39:35] trouble but the feather
[39:38] experience that's when he grabs you out
[39:40] of the nest carries you up dumps you out
[39:44] in the land of
[39:45] nowhere and while you're flopping and
[39:48] falling at at the speed of sound almost
[39:53] great mother Eagle comes down faster
[39:55] than the speed of sound and and catches
[39:58] you and then you and you just grab onto
[40:02] their feathers and the next thing you
[40:03] know he dumps you
[40:05] again but listen it brings you to the
[40:08] reality of the
[40:10] presence of a living God and that's what
[40:12] we want this morning we want to live in
[40:15] his shadow but listen we want that
[40:17] feather
[40:18] experience we want to to have communion
[40:22] with him and to know him in the reality
[40:25] of life
[40:27] [Music]
[40:28] so as we uh would open our scriptures
[40:31] this morning I want
[40:33] to to start in uh St
[40:37] John uh chapter
[40:51] 18 and in St John chapter 18 uh verse 33
[40:59] and I want to title us this
[41:03] morning the battle for the
[41:06] kingdom it's not a battle for a
[41:11] kingdom but it's the
[41:13] battle for the kingdom we're talking
[41:17] about one
[41:19] Kingdom we're talking about a
[41:23] battle so in St
[41:25] John chapter 8
[41:27] 18 and verse
[41:30] 33 then pilate entered into the Judgment
[41:34] into the Judgment Hall
[41:37] again and called Jesus and said unto him
[41:41] art thou the king of the
[41:44] Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this
[41:48] thing of
[41:49] thyself or did others tell it thee of
[41:53] me and pilate answered am I a Jew
[41:58] thine own nation and the chief priests
[42:01] have delivered thee unto
[42:03] me what thou what H has thou
[42:06] done and Jesus
[42:09] answered my
[42:11] kingdom is not of this
[42:15] world if my kingdom were of this
[42:18] world then would my subjects fight that
[42:23] I should not be delivered to the Jews
[42:26] but now is my kingdom not from
[42:30] hence and pilate therefore said unto him
[42:33] art thou a king
[42:35] then Jesus answered thou sayest that I
[42:40] am a
[42:41] king to this end was I
[42:44] born and for this cause came I into the
[42:49] world that I should bear witness onto
[42:53] the
[42:54] truth everyone that is of the truth
[42:58] heareth my
[42:59] voice and pilate saith unto
[43:02] him what is truth and when he had said
[43:07] this he went out again unto the Jews and
[43:10] saith unto
[43:12] them I find in him no fault at all may
[43:17] we just bow our
[43:19] heads Lord Jesus we just thank you this
[43:22] morning for your mercies and
[43:25] Grace and Lord Lord as we've assembled
[43:28] ourselves
[43:29] together without you we can do
[43:33] nothing but through you Lord we are more
[43:36] than conquerors this
[43:39] morning and Lord anything that we can do
[43:42] without you is
[43:44] nothing but your word promises that
[43:48] where two or three are gathered together
[43:50] in your name you would be in our
[43:53] midst so Lord you are the center of our
[43:56] gathering this morning may you anoint us
[44:00] and Inspire us
[44:02] father that we might know and understand
[44:06] your
[44:07] way lead us and guide us this morning
[44:10] take preeminence and all of our hearts
[44:14] anoint our ears anoint our lips Lord
[44:17] that we might speak the things that You'
[44:20] have to speak to your children this
[44:23] morning to increase their faith to meet
[44:26] the challenge
[44:28] of the day that we live in for we ask it
[44:31] in Jesus Christ's
[44:33] name amen amen you may be
[44:43] seated so Jesus the main thing that I'm
[44:46] drawing from this from this scripture
[44:50] here is in verse uh
[44:54] 36 my kingdom
[44:58] is not of this world if my kingdom were
[45:02] of this world then would my servant
[45:05] fight that I should not be delivered to
[45:10] the Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[45:15] hence and I just want to read this over
[45:18] in the
[45:19] Amplified and it uh reads uh just a
[45:22] little bit
[45:24] different but he says if my kingdom were
[45:27] of this world my followers would have
[45:30] been fighting to keep me from being
[45:32] handed over to the
[45:34] Jews but as it is my kingdom is not from
[45:39] here this world it has no such uh origin
[45:45] or
[45:46] source so uh what prompted me
[45:50] to to start this I preached it at home I
[45:54] guess in about three three different
[45:58] services that in looking uh reading the
[46:02] news of what's taking place around
[46:06] us that there were there were uh three
[46:10] words that had come up that uh caught my
[46:16] attention
[46:18] and uh one newsman was was talking about
[46:23] uh
[46:24] Trump and and uh
[46:27] worried about him coming in
[46:30] to uh to be the president he said if if
[46:33] uh Trump comes
[46:35] in he said the United States will be
[46:38] under a
[46:40] theocracy and I thought that was kind of
[46:44] interesting because if you look at
[46:46] Revelation
[46:48] 13 that when it comes down to the mark
[46:51] of the beast and you can't buy or
[46:53] sell that we find that that the world is
[46:57] under a a
[47:00] theocracy so when I looked up this
[47:04] uh this terminology of
[47:07] theocracy theocracy is a government of a
[47:12] state by immediate Divine
[47:15] guidance or by officials who are
[47:19] regarded as divinely
[47:22] guided a state governed by a theocracy
[47:28] so when when
[47:31] Rome uh ruled over
[47:34] Europe a civilized uh world at that time
[47:39] that it was a
[47:40] theocracy because you had a civil
[47:43] government but then you also had the
[47:46] Roman uh the Roman Catholic
[47:50] Church was the was the religion that
[47:54] that
[47:55] controlled and drove
[47:58] the uh countries in Europe at that
[48:02] time so a theocracy is the combination
[48:07] between civil and ecclesiastical
[48:11] powers and they they claim to
[48:14] be uh
[48:16] divinely
[48:18] inspired to run the
[48:20] government and that's what happens under
[48:23] the mark of the beast that's what
[48:26] happened in the times of nimrod he built
[48:28] a city and a
[48:31] tower so the city represented uh civil
[48:35] power represented
[48:38] civilization and the tower represented
[48:42] religion so it was a union between
[48:46] religion and politics or civil powers
[48:49] and ecclesiastical Powers that's a
[48:53] theocracy all civilizations
[48:57] before Jesus Christ were
[49:02] theocracies uh you take the the American
[49:05] Indian it's really a theocracy because
[49:08] you have the chief and you have the
[49:09] witch doctor and we know that the witch
[49:12] doctor is the one that really controls
[49:14] the the tribe because he controls it
[49:16] through religion or we would call it
[49:20] Superstition right so then there's a
[49:23] there's a a union there's a coming
[49:25] together between the chief
[49:28] and between the witch doctor and that's
[49:30] a a theocracy is we're speaking of
[49:34] it and so in under a theocracy it's
[49:38] really not Faith it's
[49:41] obedience and it's
[49:44] participation when it comes time that
[49:46] there's a drought and they're going to
[49:48] have the rain
[49:49] dance it's not whether you believe it's
[49:52] something that they do it's a it's a
[49:55] tradition
[49:57] uh and so when they gather together the
[49:59] whole tribe gathers together because
[50:02] they all
[50:03] participate in that in that
[50:07] ceremony uh that they believe that's
[50:09] going to bring rain and if somebody
[50:11] doesn't attend they they feel that
[50:15] that's
[50:16] offensive to the god or to the power
[50:19] that they're worshiping to bring
[50:21] rain and so under a a theocracy it's not
[50:25] really Faith so much much it's it's
[50:29] obedience and its
[50:32] participation uh it kind of reminds me a
[50:35] little bit that when you say when we
[50:38] used to go to ball games and everybody
[50:41] would gather together and the first
[50:42] thing that we would do is they'd play
[50:44] the national anthem and raise the flag
[50:47] and everybody would stand with their
[50:49] hand over their heart or they'd salute
[50:52] and if you saw somebody standing there
[50:54] with their hands down at their side you
[50:56] say like oh what oh you know it was odd
[51:01] it was oh they're not patriotic they
[51:04] don't love the country you know it's
[51:06] just it's because that's the way we've
[51:07] been raised and that's the way it is in
[51:10] a in a
[51:12] theocracy or what they would call a
[51:14] sacral
[51:15] society and so that when uh somebody
[51:18] doesn't participate it's a threat to the
[51:22] unity and so then if that person is not
[51:25] brought in into Unity then there comes a
[51:29] a judgment and an excommunication or
[51:32] capital
[51:33] punishment that's right even Israel was
[51:36] a
[51:38] theocracy because you had the king you
[51:41] had the prophet you had the
[51:44] priests and when you were born you was 8
[51:48] days old you were circumcised so you
[51:51] were part of the abrahamic Covenant yeah
[51:54] and you it wasn't your faith
[51:57] it was tradition it was what God had
[52:00] required of man that's right and so it
[52:02] was a theocracy not a pagan theocracy
[52:06] but it was a
[52:08] theocracy but when it came to Christ
[52:10] Christ began to preach something and
[52:12] teach something that was completely
[52:15] different than what had ever been in the
[52:17] world before because up at that time all
[52:21] societies were what you would call
[52:24] monolithic everybody believed the same
[52:26] thing thing everybody believed to the
[52:28] belonged to the church look at uh
[52:31] Nimrod he built a tower he built a city
[52:35] there we have a theocracy and he was
[52:38] conquering all the nations around him
[52:40] and bringing brother Brown said into one
[52:42] Federation it was to be a World
[52:46] Federation and so it wasn't a matter of
[52:48] faith it was a matter of of obedience it
[52:52] was a matter of
[52:54] participation uh when it came to Nimrod
[52:57] or uh Nebuchadnezzar we find it it was a
[53:02] theocracy and so then when they captured
[53:05] the Jews it looked like it was a freedom
[53:08] of religion because the Jews were
[53:11] allowed to live together in their in
[53:13] their uh uh tribal Unity uh we would say
[53:17] in their housing areas or in their
[53:20] communities they were allowed to live
[53:22] together and that's when they began the
[53:25] synagogues and uh they would come
[53:27] together and they would study the word
[53:30] they would study the Bible they believed
[53:32] in Jehovah God and there was no problem
[53:36] with
[53:37] Nebuchadnezzar uh the problem came was
[53:41] when the image was built and now
[53:44] everybody was required to bow to image
[53:49] yeah that's a
[53:50] theocracy that it's not a matter of
[53:53] Faith it's not matter whether you
[53:55] believe in that Idol or for that God
[53:57] it's a matter of where everybody bows
[53:59] and you look around and you see a
[54:03] Unity God has a plan Satan has a plan
[54:08] God's plan is to unify man under him
[54:12] under his
[54:13] headship but his plan was that we were
[54:17] to be born again amen that it was to be
[54:20] a a Unity of Faith but now Satan he has
[54:25] a plan and his plan is to unify people
[54:29] under him but his plan is under a
[54:33] theocracy he demands
[54:35] unity and so as long as people
[54:38] participate there's no problem when it
[54:41] came to the Roman Empire when it came
[54:44] down to the to the foot of the image
[54:48] when it came down to the the last
[54:51] manifestation of the Gentile
[54:54] Nations that we find that that there was
[54:57] a uh there was a Roman
[55:01] Empire and young
[55:04] Christianity and under young
[55:06] Christianity we're talking about now
[55:09] 325 ad so we're we're almost 300 years
[55:14] into the church it's just barely 300
[55:17] years old not really 300 but but close
[55:20] to 300 years
[55:22] old and so we find that in 53 ad that
[55:26] was was the beginning of the false Vine
[55:29] manifestation amongst the church we had
[55:32] 20 years of pure Church from uh 33 ad to
[55:37] 20 uh to 53 ad 20 years and the church
[55:41] was kept clean when anasis and Safa came
[55:46] that the Holy Spirit called that sin out
[55:49] yeah and so the church was kept pure we
[55:51] find it that when that happened there
[55:53] was those uh it's hard to imagine this
[55:57] but there was those that knew that God
[55:59] was with these Christians with these
[56:02] Believers with the people of the book
[56:04] yeah and so they were afraid to join
[56:07] themselves to them because they knew if
[56:10] they join themselves to them and they
[56:13] didn't confess their sins their sins
[56:15] would be called out and so it said they
[56:18] dared not they dur not join themselves
[56:21] to the church even though they knew that
[56:23] God was with them so we had 20 years of
[56:28] pure
[56:29] church but then in 53 ad the false Vine
[56:33] began to manifest itself it was there
[56:36] but now it's coming to a
[56:39] manifestation so by the time we get to
[56:42] 325 ad now the false Vine had begin to
[56:48] uh begin to gain territory against the
[56:50] True Vine that's right uh they begin to
[56:53] organize they begin to formalize
[56:56] and what caused this was that they were
[56:59] trying to protect the truth brother
[57:02] Brandon in the church ages said Satan
[57:04] whispered in their ears and says now you
[57:07] have the truth you've got to protect
[57:10] it it was the same thing that Peter
[57:14] did Peter when when he was talking to
[57:17] the Lord they came down off Mount
[57:20] Transfiguration they're walking along
[57:22] the road Jesus begins talking to him and
[57:25] he starts talking about how that he's
[57:27] going to be arrested how he's going to
[57:30] be mistreated how he's going to be
[57:33] crucified and and Peter's listening and
[57:37] he hears that and he says oh no we're
[57:41] not going to let them do that to you
[57:43] Peter loved Jesus he would have give his
[57:46] life for him he already said I I'd give
[57:50] my life for
[57:51] you but you know uh sometimes
[57:57] what we
[57:58] seek or what we want to do for the Lord
[58:02] is not
[58:04] bad but it's the way that we do it that
[58:07] it becomes bad our good intentions our
[58:10] good
[58:12] desires they're good but they become bad
[58:15] in the way that we want to do it and so
[58:19] Peter uh I have to think that his his
[58:21] brain lock down or you know in some
[58:24] Services you'll come out and
[58:26] and either the husband or the wife will
[58:28] say well did you hear that and he said
[58:29] so and so he said I didn't hear that you
[58:32] have to go back to the tape it was that
[58:34] moment that your mind drifted or you
[58:37] just didn't catch it you know and you go
[58:38] back and sure enough there it is and so
[58:41] Peter I always say his brain must have
[58:44] locked down when Jesus said and I'll
[58:47] raise on the third day he never did hear
[58:50] that he he just said oh no uh I'm going
[58:55] to protect you
[58:57] and his business was not to protect the
[58:59] word his business was to be under the
[59:02] word but now watch the disciple the
[59:05] student now becomes the teacher he pulls
[59:08] him aside and he begins to upgrade him
[59:11] now here he is he's the student right
[59:14] he's the disciple but now he's going to
[59:16] tell Jesus Oh no you're not going to do
[59:18] that we're not going to let you do that
[59:21] and he says Get Behind Me Satan thou
[59:24] savest not the things of God but the
[59:27] things of man so what he what he's doing
[59:31] is he's out of his own love for Christ
[59:35] out of his own love he begins to
[59:38] exercise his ability driven by his
[59:42] ambition and now he's going to protect
[59:44] him but in doing that he's standing
[59:46] right in the middle of the way of the
[59:50] Divine will of God and so the
[59:54] inspiration is coming from Satan it's
[59:57] Satan pushing him now into this carnal
[1:00:01] mind and Jesus said if a man seeks to
[1:00:05] save his life he'll lose
[1:00:08] it but if he loses it for my sake he'll
[1:00:13] find eternal life
[1:00:14] Hallelujah that's an interesting
[1:00:17] statement because if we seek to save
[1:00:21] something many times we'll end up losing
[1:00:24] it so like a man or a woman they they
[1:00:28] come to church and one of them gets
[1:00:31] saved one of them they're touched in
[1:00:33] their heart by the gospel they're moved
[1:00:36] on by the Holy Spirit and they give
[1:00:38] their life and dedicate their life to
[1:00:41] the gospel and they start coming to the
[1:00:43] church but the other partner is not
[1:00:45] touched by the gospel and they said well
[1:00:48] I'm not going to church and if you keep
[1:00:51] going to church uh we're done that's it
[1:00:55] and so the one that's been touched by
[1:00:57] the Lord many times they'll make a
[1:00:59] compromise and they say okay well I'll
[1:01:02] just stay at
[1:01:03] home if you seek to save your marriage
[1:01:07] by your human
[1:01:09] ability driven by your ambition to cons
[1:01:14] to keep the marriage in a Unity you'll
[1:01:17] lose it that's right but if you seek
[1:01:21] Christ he's the one that's going to keep
[1:01:23] the marriage together that's right many
[1:01:26] times as human beings our human love
[1:01:30] fails one another we just get to that
[1:01:34] place and we're just like they say
[1:01:36] kicking KS down the road and we'll say I
[1:01:39] don't know I guess I guess I don't know
[1:01:42] I don't know why I ever married him or
[1:01:45] her you know I
[1:01:47] just but if Christ is in our
[1:01:51] heart he takes up that insufficiency
[1:01:54] that's right because he's the tie poost
[1:01:57] he ties you to the word and the word
[1:02:01] ties you to that
[1:02:03] Union so if a man seeks to save his
[1:02:08] life and he does it by human ambition
[1:02:12] and human ability he'll lose it that's
[1:02:16] right but if he seeks the kingdom then
[1:02:19] all things will be given on to him that
[1:02:21] he has need
[1:02:23] of and that's an interesting verse
[1:02:26] because it shows up again in Luke
[1:02:30] 17:30 where it says as it was in the
[1:02:33] days of lot so shall it be in the days
[1:02:36] when the son of man is
[1:02:39] revealed and then he says uh I'll take
[1:02:42] one leave one so we know it's at the
[1:02:45] time of the Rapture and it
[1:02:48] says remember Lot's
[1:02:51] wife that's right if a man seeks to save
[1:02:55] his life
[1:02:56] he'll lose it but if he loses it for my
[1:03:00] sake he'll find eternal life isn't that
[1:03:03] something so that
[1:03:05] scripture is a predominant scripture
[1:03:07] it's an important scripture for the day
[1:03:10] that you and I are living in because
[1:03:12] many people will seek to save their life
[1:03:17] save their job save their marriage or
[1:03:21] save it outside of the word human human
[1:03:24] ability and human
[1:03:27] ambition and the carnal mind is death
[1:03:31] yeah and the carnal mind we don't get
[1:03:34] away from the carnal mind the carnal
[1:03:35] mind is
[1:03:36] reasoning it's emotion it's memory but
[1:03:41] down in here there is the mind of Christ
[1:03:44] that brings this mind subject to the
[1:03:48] word of God in faith in God living in
[1:03:52] his shadows and carried up into the
[1:03:55] heavens and his feathers and if he drops
[1:03:58] you if you got a bad day if it's a dark
[1:04:02] time listen he can fly faster than you
[1:04:06] can drop and you won't hit the bottom
[1:04:10] and he'll catch you and lift you back up
[1:04:13] and those are times that we have to
[1:04:16] trust in him and to know him as a mother
[1:04:20] Eagle that she'll not forget her young
[1:04:23] that's right so the
[1:04:26] then uh it's not it's not uh what you
[1:04:31] seek remember Israel in Romans 9 the
[1:04:34] last part of Romans 9 and the first part
[1:04:37] of Romans 10 that Israel was
[1:04:42] seeking the righteousness of God now
[1:04:45] that's not
[1:04:47] bad they were seeking righteousness yeah
[1:04:50] that was good there's many people that's
[1:04:53] seeking the Holy Spirit there's people
[1:04:56] that's seeking
[1:04:58] salvation people seeking justification
[1:05:03] sanctification those things are not
[1:05:05] bad they were seeking righteousness but
[1:05:09] the scripture says they sought it not by
[1:05:13] faith but by the works of the law by the
[1:05:16] law they sought it so what they sought
[1:05:19] was not
[1:05:21] bad but how they sought it was bad amen
[1:05:25] they never found it and by not finding
[1:05:29] God's perfect
[1:05:31] will by not finding God's
[1:05:34] righteousness it forces man to set up
[1:05:37] his own righteousness that's
[1:05:40] right he'll come to a place that he sets
[1:05:44] up his own righteousness his own Holy
[1:05:48] Spirit experience his own Holy Spirit
[1:05:53] way of receiving life
[1:05:56] and it becomes a church
[1:05:58] denomination it becomes uh a comparison
[1:06:02] of one's person's experience to the
[1:06:05] other whether they got it or whether
[1:06:07] they don't have
[1:06:10] it but God has a divine
[1:06:15] order when he sent the Mana in in uh
[1:06:20] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:06:22] 8 the scripture says that he sent the
[1:06:25] Mana
[1:06:27] and there was two purposes for the
[1:06:29] Mana number one the Mana was sent for
[1:06:33] nutritional value to keep them alive
[1:06:37] everything they had need of for
[1:06:39] nutritional value for health for their
[1:06:42] immune system for their eyes for their
[1:06:45] hair they didn't have to take different
[1:06:48] vitamins or search the vitam and book
[1:06:50] and say do I need c do I need
[1:06:53] B12 but that Mana
[1:06:56] was everything that they had need of for
[1:07:00] perfect
[1:07:01] kidneys it was it was heart
[1:07:04] friendly it didn't bring sugar
[1:07:07] diabetes it it was everything that they
[1:07:11] had was in there was for nutritional
[1:07:14] value and God created it it was created
[1:07:19] in heaven so the Mana was divine in
[1:07:23] origin
[1:07:26] its origin was divine he created that
[1:07:31] right but there was there was placed in
[1:07:34] the Mana a
[1:07:36] law it was a law of
[1:07:40] corruption and you would think if God
[1:07:42] created bread why it would never Meo it
[1:07:46] would never mold it would never go bad I
[1:07:48] mean Divine bread but it was
[1:07:53] designed that it would if it wasn't
[1:07:56] picked up at the right time of the
[1:08:00] day if it wasn't picked up uh in the
[1:08:04] morning if you went out there an hour
[1:08:07] after the time that you were supposed to
[1:08:09] go it melted it wasn't anything
[1:08:14] there and if he said you just pick up
[1:08:17] enough for one day for the whole family
[1:08:21] and that's all you pick up don't pick up
[1:08:23] any extra you're not going to St it for
[1:08:26] tomorrow don't do that and somebody says
[1:08:29] well you know this is the first time
[1:08:31] I've ever experienced this and I don't
[1:08:34] know if he's going to send any tomorrow
[1:08:36] so I'm going to just in case I'm going
[1:08:40] to save up a little bit for
[1:08:42] tomorrow and so when he did that it
[1:08:45] spoiled and got worms and turned rotten
[1:08:49] and it was divine in origin right but it
[1:08:52] said he sent the Mana to teach
[1:08:56] them that they should live by every word
[1:08:59] of God Amen so it was sent to be a
[1:09:04] nutritional value and it was uh sent for
[1:09:09] Spiritual instruction that's right and
[1:09:13] so Moses it came to a time that Israel
[1:09:17] must have been preaching that Moses had
[1:09:19] given them the Mana and Jesus said Moses
[1:09:23] didn't give you the Mana God gave you
[1:09:26] the
[1:09:27] Mana but Moses being the prophet had the
[1:09:33] instructions for the Mana he's the one
[1:09:36] that told him said now you're going to
[1:09:38] have to get it between 8 and 10 in the
[1:09:41] morning and and some of you I know you
[1:09:44] don't like to get up early and some of
[1:09:47] you just don't like to go out and get
[1:09:49] your own breakfast but if you don't do
[1:09:52] that um you're not going to eat
[1:09:56] because everybody else is just getting
[1:09:58] enough for themselves it's kind of like
[1:10:00] the oil they had just enough for
[1:10:02] themselves they didn't have enough to
[1:10:04] give to everybody else it's an
[1:10:06] individual Affair the Mana was an
[1:10:09] individual Family Affair at that time
[1:10:13] yeah right just enough to eat for that
[1:10:15] day so the instruction was to listen to
[1:10:20] the word of God and be obedient to the
[1:10:23] word of God and the Mana would be of a
[1:10:26] nutritional value to you but if you
[1:10:29] don't listen to the word of God and you
[1:10:31] decide to do your own schedule then
[1:10:35] you're going to starve and that's why
[1:10:38] that God designed it it seemed like it
[1:10:41] was designed with a flaw but that flaw
[1:10:45] was to match the word of God for the
[1:10:48] instructions of God Amen it was to be in
[1:10:51] a harmony with the prophetical word of
[1:10:55] God so then you know how sometimes it is
[1:10:58] in the church you know and so you get
[1:11:01] used to the rules and everything as it
[1:11:03] was and then all of a sudden the pastor
[1:11:06] changes the rule and now he says oh he
[1:11:10] says now today is Saturday he said now I
[1:11:14] want you to gather enough for tomorrow
[1:11:17] when you go out today get it for two
[1:11:20] days and of course the grumbler you know
[1:11:22] he'll say I can't believe this
[1:11:26] he's been telling us we can only get it
[1:11:28] for one day and now he's telling us we
[1:11:32] got to get it for two days I wish he'd
[1:11:34] make up his mind what he wanted you know
[1:11:37] but he's just getting his instructions
[1:11:39] from God
[1:11:41] right and they said well I'm just going
[1:11:45] to stay with the
[1:11:46] original I am not going to gather up two
[1:11:50] days worth I'm going to get up in the
[1:11:52] morning because this is what God Said
[1:11:55] and this is what I'm going to do come on
[1:11:58] so they got up the next morning and they
[1:12:00] went out like they always did and lo and
[1:12:03] behold there wasn't any Mana can you
[1:12:06] imagine
[1:12:07] that so we must listen to the word of
[1:12:11] God and we must do things in divine
[1:12:15] order that's right David David wanted to
[1:12:19] bring the
[1:12:20] ark the Throne of
[1:12:23] God which represented the word of God
[1:12:27] and the presence of God in that day he
[1:12:30] wanted to bring it to the
[1:12:33] center of Mount Zion that was where
[1:12:35] David's house was that's where the
[1:12:38] government was it wasn't where the
[1:12:39] church was it was where David's Throne
[1:12:43] was and David wanted to bring God to the
[1:12:47] midst of the people he wanted he wanted
[1:12:51] he wanted Israel to know a living God he
[1:12:54] knew the living God he had had the
[1:12:56] experience with the lion and the bear he
[1:12:59] had had the experience with
[1:13:01] Goliath he knew the presence of God he
[1:13:04] knew the Deliverance of God and he
[1:13:07] wanted Israel he wanted the church to
[1:13:09] know the Deliverance of a mighty God a
[1:13:13] present God a living God my soul thirsts
[1:13:17] for God for a living God not not just go
[1:13:21] to church and sing songs and and
[1:13:26] but to have communion with him that's a
[1:13:29] living God to speak to him and he speaks
[1:13:32] back to have communion and that God has
[1:13:35] ordained it that every person in here is
[1:13:38] to have a personal experience with God
[1:13:42] have a personal supply of Mana given to
[1:13:46] you by God through the Holy Spirit but
[1:13:50] God has a divine order amen that we
[1:13:54] assemble ourselves
[1:13:56] and some say well I don't need that I
[1:13:58] just stay at
[1:13:59] home that's not the divine order come on
[1:14:04] God said where two or three are gathered
[1:14:06] together that's the church so people say
[1:14:09] well honey you and me we're going to
[1:14:11] gather together and here's the church we
[1:14:13] don't need to go to Pony we don't need
[1:14:15] to go to brother Wendell's church or
[1:14:17] brother so and so's church or this
[1:14:19] church and then Paul turns around and
[1:14:21] says don't forsake the Assembly of
[1:14:24] yourself he's not talking about home
[1:14:26] Church come on he's talking about a body
[1:14:30] Ministry and when a person uh
[1:14:34] individuals they don't need the body of
[1:14:36] Christ they can live on their own I got
[1:14:38] my own Holy Ghost God called me God
[1:14:41] saved me God's going to deliver me that
[1:14:44] is not the divine order that the
[1:14:48] scriptures set up amen you will die in a
[1:14:52] desert place as a hermit amen God didn't
[1:14:56] call us to be Hermits he didn't call
[1:14:58] brother brandham to be a Hermit he
[1:15:00] wanted to be a Hermit he got frustrated
[1:15:03] with all the darkness and all the
[1:15:05] confusion and all the um Rebellion that
[1:15:10] was among them he wanted to go up in a
[1:15:12] mountain someplace and fish and hunt and
[1:15:16] just live in the presence of God and
[1:15:18] enjoy that and then come down when he
[1:15:22] had thus sayith the Lord deliver a
[1:15:24] message and go back up into that Utopia
[1:15:28] he said you do that and you'll be a bum
[1:15:31] because I've not called you that way
[1:15:32] listen God ain't called us that
[1:15:35] way you know some of us like to meditate
[1:15:38] a lot we like to read a lot other people
[1:15:40] like to talk a lot we're all
[1:15:43] different but when it comes to the word
[1:15:45] of God it doesn't make any different how
[1:15:48] different we are in our personalities
[1:15:50] and our makeup we're not we're not
[1:15:53] robots we're not put into a form we're
[1:15:56] not put into a mold we're all different
[1:15:59] but down in that Soul we're all the same
[1:16:02] where're the attributes of God it's the
[1:16:04] Living Word of God and it lives by the
[1:16:07] word of God and what Satan wants to do
[1:16:09] is push you out to away from the word of
[1:16:13] God to use your own human ability and
[1:16:15] your own Ambitions that's good and your
[1:16:18] desire can be good David's desire was
[1:16:21] good there was nothing wrong with his
[1:16:24] desire right but what it was was the way
[1:16:27] that he was wanting to bring the
[1:16:29] ark and so when he brought the ark they
[1:16:32] stumbled and when it stumbled an
[1:16:34] innocent man went to protect the word
[1:16:37] and he put his hand to that and it was
[1:16:40] judgment listen his intentions was good
[1:16:43] he didn't want the ark falling in the
[1:16:45] mud in a pit he didn't want it down here
[1:16:48] in the dirt in the dust and he and he
[1:16:50] and he put it forth to save it but that
[1:16:53] was not God's divine order
[1:16:57] so it's not good
[1:17:00] intentions those things can be good but
[1:17:04] the way that we do something and David
[1:17:07] was the cause of that because he was out
[1:17:09] of order and it caused another man to
[1:17:11] get out of
[1:17:13] water kind of reminds me when you'd see
[1:17:15] these uh bands at halftime and there was
[1:17:18] always this one guy it was a it was a an
[1:17:21] act but he was always trying to find his
[1:17:24] place he was out there used either one
[1:17:26] of those tubas or else he had a drum and
[1:17:29] he'd be bumping into people trying to
[1:17:31] find his place you know and when he
[1:17:33] finally got it everything was in order
[1:17:35] and everybody was marching uniform and
[1:17:39] sometimes people are trying to find
[1:17:40] their place and bumping in you know you
[1:17:42] can cause somebody to fall you can cause
[1:17:44] somebody to trip up cause somebody to
[1:17:46] get out of their position so we all want
[1:17:49] to be in our position that we're all
[1:17:52] marching according to the order of of
[1:17:55] the
[1:17:55] majorette come on the man or the woman
[1:17:59] that's up there with the Baton that's
[1:18:01] saying Left Right forward stop and
[1:18:04] playing according to the music all
[1:18:08] right but when David
[1:18:11] found when David found God's divine
[1:18:15] order when he found his divine order and
[1:18:18] he got in his divine
[1:18:21] order that he found that it was to be
[1:18:23] carried over the hearts of the
[1:18:26] Levites so then they called the Levites
[1:18:29] everybody got prepared and the Levites
[1:18:32] took the
[1:18:33] staff and it probably looked different
[1:18:35] to the world it didn't look right
[1:18:38] because everybody had that staff over
[1:18:41] their heart on their left shoulder the
[1:18:43] ones on the right had it on their left
[1:18:45] shoulder the ones on the left had it on
[1:18:48] their left
[1:18:49] shoulder uh the world might have said no
[1:18:52] no that ain't the way you do it uh those
[1:18:55] that's on the left you put it on your
[1:18:57] right shoulder and the ones on the right
[1:18:59] put it on your left shoulder and that
[1:19:01] way it'll be symmetric and everything
[1:19:03] will look balanced and that don't look
[1:19:05] right everybody carrying it but God's
[1:19:07] word said everybody carry it over their
[1:19:10] heart whether it's left right center he
[1:19:14] arranges it in a place that you can
[1:19:16] fulfill that word there's a space for
[1:19:19] you to get in in God's divine order that
[1:19:22] you can place that on your left shoulder
[1:19:26] over your heart the word is not to be
[1:19:29] carried in our heads it's to be carried
[1:19:31] over our and in our hearts that's where
[1:19:35] God designed it to be that's the resting
[1:19:38] place of his word listen I can read I
[1:19:41] can memorize this I can put it all in my
[1:19:43] brain but God don't want it in my brain
[1:19:46] he wants it in my heart it's a book of
[1:19:50] redemption and when the word comes it's
[1:19:52] a living experience it's a living word
[1:19:55] so there has to be Deliverance not of
[1:19:57] the brain not a Reformation it has to be
[1:20:00] the Deliverance of the soul of man that
[1:20:03] God comes in and dwells in his people
[1:20:07] amen amen so I was looking at these
[1:20:11] words theocracy I said now that's kind
[1:20:14] of
[1:20:15] interesting and you notice how religious
[1:20:18] that Trump is getting he was religious
[1:20:21] the last time he was in office right and
[1:20:25] and now he's even more religious than
[1:20:27] what he is so there was another name
[1:20:30] that they brought up Christian
[1:20:32] nationalism and I thought Christian
[1:20:34] nationalism I never heard of that what
[1:20:36] is that and so I looked it up and
[1:20:39] Christian
[1:20:41] nationalism is a movement amongst the
[1:20:43] people to try to preserve America as a
[1:20:48] Christian Nation they said our Founders
[1:20:50] were Christians the Constitution is
[1:20:53] based on Christian precepts on the Bible
[1:20:57] and we the early people the early
[1:21:00] Patriots they were Christians as a
[1:21:04] majority and so our
[1:21:06] constitution one nation under God
[1:21:10] indivisible and so we find all men were
[1:21:13] created equal it's scriptural so they
[1:21:16] want to preserve America as a Christian
[1:21:20] Nation they see them taking prayer out
[1:21:23] of school they want prayer back in
[1:21:25] school that's nothing wrong they they
[1:21:28] see what America is turning their back
[1:21:30] on God and they're wanting to preserve
[1:21:33] America as a Christian
[1:21:36] Nation there was another word that came
[1:21:38] up it was called uh Christian Liberty
[1:21:43] party and I thought Christian Liberty
[1:21:46] party and I found that when I was
[1:21:48] looking up Christian
[1:21:49] nationalism it's a political
[1:21:52] party and it's interesting because
[1:21:55] there's some uh senators and
[1:21:57] representatives that's already in our
[1:21:59] government that belongs to this uh
[1:22:02] Christian uh Liberty party and it has
[1:22:06] the same Concepts to preserve America as
[1:22:10] a Christian Nation that uh you look at
[1:22:14] the people that's running for office and
[1:22:16] those people that claim to be Christians
[1:22:18] that's who you vote for you vote to put
[1:22:21] Christians in there and their desire is
[1:22:24] to get Christians a Christian president
[1:22:26] Christian Senate Christian
[1:22:28] representative and God Jesus Christ is
[1:22:32] going to be the head of this nation I
[1:22:35] went to some meetings like that about
[1:22:37] eight years
[1:22:38] ago and uh my doctor had invited me to
[1:22:41] come to some of their meetings and I
[1:22:44] don't know if it was the same name but
[1:22:45] that's what they were out for they said
[1:22:48] Matthew 28:19 were to go out and convert
[1:22:51] the Nations so they wanted to convert
[1:22:54] governments into
[1:22:56] Christianity and I said after about two
[1:22:59] meetings I said well uh uh you're trying
[1:23:03] to save these governments and convert
[1:23:05] them over to Christianity and I said uh
[1:23:09] my Bible says they're going to be burned
[1:23:11] off and he says oh he says you're a
[1:23:15] premist aren't you and it's kind of like
[1:23:18] they write you down and they put you
[1:23:20] over in the in the Box you know under
[1:23:22] the catalog and and then that's the end
[1:23:25] of
[1:23:26] it so their
[1:23:29] desire is to make
[1:23:32] America a Christian
[1:23:36] Nation you know when you make America a
[1:23:39] Christian
[1:23:40] Nation now you're going to have to now
[1:23:42] you have an
[1:23:44] established religion and the first
[1:23:47] amendment is what stop that because
[1:23:49] that's what we had over in Europe at the
[1:23:52] time that America was discovered all
[1:23:55] Europe all of Europe was under the the
[1:23:59] Roman Catholic
[1:24:00] church or the Protestant churches and
[1:24:04] all the Protestant churches had gone to
[1:24:07] a theocracy Luther
[1:24:10] Calvin West all of them they had gone to
[1:24:14] a state church and the state church was
[1:24:17] set up just like the Catholic church
[1:24:20] under Luther brother Brown said he uh
[1:24:23] how did he say that he just um his
[1:24:27] judgment went bad and so then Luther
[1:24:31] wanted a a true um godall Living Church
[1:24:36] but after a while because of the
[1:24:38] pressure of the Catholic church and
[1:24:40] their natural powers and the Nations
[1:24:42] they controlled that he he went to the
[1:24:46] princes of the nation of of of um
[1:24:51] Germany and there they made Lu ISM
[1:24:55] became the state religion and brother
[1:24:58] brandham said he chose the state to be
[1:25:01] the defender of the faith instead of God
[1:25:05] and so then it was the same uh
[1:25:09] theocracy that when your children when
[1:25:11] you had children you had to bring your
[1:25:13] child to the church and they had to be
[1:25:16] baptized and when you were baptized or
[1:25:19] sprinkled then you were in the church
[1:25:22] and that's what the Catholic Church
[1:25:24] teaches they only substituted sprinkling
[1:25:27] children or infants for
[1:25:29] circumcision that made it a
[1:25:32] theocracy it wasn't a matter of faith it
[1:25:36] was a matter of obedience and
[1:25:39] participation if you didn't bring your
[1:25:41] children down then the church would note
[1:25:44] that you know uh so and so they just had
[1:25:48] a little baby boy they haven't brought
[1:25:50] that baby in yet to be sprinkled because
[1:25:53] these people believed that a person was
[1:25:56] to be baptized on the basis of a
[1:25:59] confession and receiving Jesus Christ as
[1:26:02] their savior so they didn't believe in
[1:26:04] infant baptism but according to the
[1:26:08] Lutheran Church the state Church you had
[1:26:10] to bring your children in because
[1:26:13] everybody that sprinkled is part of the
[1:26:15] church and the church is a
[1:26:18] nation a Christian Nation the problem is
[1:26:22] God has not called a nation he called
[1:26:26] Israel as a nation in the Old Testament
[1:26:29] but in the New Testament he's building a
[1:26:32] church a people a body individuals and
[1:26:36] it's based upon the confession of Faith
[1:26:39] it's not based upon uh obedience it's
[1:26:43] not based upon
[1:26:45] participation it's based upon faith in
[1:26:48] God in his word in his Plan of
[1:26:51] Redemption
[1:26:54] and so all of
[1:26:56] Europe was under the red
[1:27:00] dragon and so there was a an exodus the
[1:27:04] escaped ones in the Lutheran age and
[1:27:08] they came over to America and brother
[1:27:10] Brenham said God had provided a place in
[1:27:13] the wilderness for the woman that the
[1:27:16] dragon was after that's that's
[1:27:19] Revelation
[1:27:20] 12:6 he said when they came to America
[1:27:23] what was it he said A
[1:27:25] wilderness so America became the
[1:27:29] sanctuary for the woman the
[1:27:32] Trine religious
[1:27:36] freedom when you study it they were
[1:27:39] already starting to set up the old world
[1:27:41] in the new world they were setting up
[1:27:44] the Anglican church and where the
[1:27:45] Anglican Church was in Virginia that
[1:27:48] everybody had to go to church so many
[1:27:50] times a week and if you didn't go to
[1:27:53] church then you were penalized uh they
[1:27:56] took away your food and then the next
[1:27:58] time they took away your property the
[1:28:00] next time you were excommunicated if
[1:28:03] there was another time it was capital
[1:28:05] punishment so the old world was being
[1:28:08] set up in a new world the Puritans the
[1:28:11] pilgrims the anglicans all the old
[1:28:14] system was being set up in the colonies
[1:28:17] so when it came time for the
[1:28:20] Constitution they there was two there
[1:28:23] was two
[1:28:24] colonies it was Pennsylvania and I
[1:28:27] believe it was Rhode Island Roger
[1:28:30] Williams was in Rhode Island and William
[1:28:33] Pinn was in Pennsylvania and they said
[1:28:35] we believe that people ought to have the
[1:28:37] freedom of religion to go to church
[1:28:40] wherever you want to go to church they
[1:28:42] have faith however you want to Fai and
[1:28:44] if you don't want to go to church you
[1:28:45] don't have to go to church and everybody
[1:28:48] has the same legal rights they're all
[1:28:51] protected by our laws regardless of what
[1:28:54] their religious affiliation is and they
[1:28:58] were the two colonies that prospered
[1:29:00] above all the other
[1:29:02] colonies and so when it came to the
[1:29:05] Constitution it was the first amendment
[1:29:08] that stopped the dragon she had already
[1:29:11] set her Roots under of what we call
[1:29:15] denominations but it stopped him from
[1:29:18] being empowered in having an established
[1:29:21] religion and so there was a San
[1:29:24] uary and America became the light of the
[1:29:28] world and from America the freedom of
[1:29:31] religion was spread over the world and
[1:29:35] influenced many
[1:29:37] nations and that was all
[1:29:40] inspired by the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:29:44] that the wheat and tears would live
[1:29:46] together it was what they call a
[1:29:47] composite Society you might go to a
[1:29:50] Lutheran Church and this one might go to
[1:29:52] a Catholic Church this one don't go to
[1:29:54] church at all but we all work at the
[1:29:55] same Factory and in a Harmony under a
[1:29:58] theocracy you can't do that everybody
[1:30:01] has to go to church at the same Temple
[1:30:04] you have to worship the same God it's
[1:30:06] not based on faith it's based on
[1:30:08] obedience that's where the Christians
[1:30:10] ran into problems during the Roman
[1:30:12] Empire because they believed in one God
[1:30:17] and Rome believed all the gods they had
[1:30:19] a catalog of gods Every Nation they
[1:30:21] conquered they put them in a catalog
[1:30:23] they built temples for them and so it
[1:30:26] made it easier for those conquered
[1:30:28] Nations to come under the civil law of
[1:30:31] the Roman Empire they didn't care what
[1:30:33] you believe but the but the Christians
[1:30:35] couldn't be put on that catalog because
[1:30:38] rule number one is you can't worship any
[1:30:42] God except he be in the
[1:30:44] catalog number two your God can't
[1:30:47] displace any God in our catalog it might
[1:30:50] be your favorite God but you have to
[1:30:53] recognize all the other gods well when
[1:30:55] it came to a Christian there's one God
[1:30:58] so then God couldn't be put in the
[1:31:00] catalog CU if he did all the other gods
[1:31:02] had to be emptied out so then they had
[1:31:05] to Worship in secret and at night they
[1:31:08] had to hide in the catacombs and
[1:31:09] different places to be able to
[1:31:12] assemble now can you imagine 300 years
[1:31:17] of
[1:31:18] persecution 300 years of meeting in in
[1:31:21] silence and hiding watches to see if in
[1:31:24] you but he's following you and
[1:31:26] persecutions and now Constantine stands
[1:31:30] up and he says no more
[1:31:35] persecution of the
[1:31:36] Christians can you imagine I'm talking
[1:31:39] about 300 years we're talking about more
[1:31:41] than one generation we're talking about
[1:31:44] three maybe four
[1:31:47] generations a
[1:31:49] persecution being burnt uh fed to the
[1:31:54] lines all what we read in the fox's book
[1:31:57] of
[1:31:57] Martyrs and now Constantine stands up
[1:32:02] and he stops
[1:32:05] it let me read
[1:32:08] something this is this is
[1:32:12] from this is
[1:32:14] from 2016
[1:32:23] things Trump
[1:32:25] said they say where is he
[1:32:29] going we got a movement and Trump has
[1:32:32] joined in with this
[1:32:35] uh Christian Liberty party he's he's
[1:32:39] embraced this Christian
[1:32:42] nationalism because he's wanting to make
[1:32:45] America a Christian
[1:32:49] Nation now it sounds good it ain't no
[1:32:52] different than when Peter said said oh
[1:32:54] no we're not going to let them kill you
[1:32:56] you're not going to be they're they're
[1:32:58] not going to torment you it's the same
[1:33:00] when David said what do you think men
[1:33:03] should we bring God into the presence of
[1:33:05] of Jerusalem should we bring his throne
[1:33:07] do we want God yeah amen praise the Lord
[1:33:11] but it was the method it was how that he
[1:33:14] was going to do
[1:33:16] that and so they're want to
[1:33:19] establish the kingdom of God
[1:33:23] in America but the kingdom of God is a
[1:33:27] body it's a church that Christ is
[1:33:31] building it's not a
[1:33:33] nation the New Testament is not calling
[1:33:35] Nations it's not calling governments
[1:33:38] listen they belong to the Devil he's the
[1:33:40] one that's inspiring he's the one that's
[1:33:42] over
[1:33:44] them this is what he
[1:33:46] said Trump is going to change the law
[1:33:50] back that Christian companies will not
[1:33:53] have
[1:33:54] to supply insurance for abortions he's
[1:33:57] going to put Merry Christmas back in the
[1:34:00] department store putting Christ back
[1:34:03] into
[1:34:04] Christmas he was also slamming people
[1:34:07] who didn't say Merry Christmas so you
[1:34:10] can see how Something Good Can all of a
[1:34:13] sudden start becoming bad because it's
[1:34:17] participation it's it's not it's not
[1:34:20] worship in Christ but it's participation
[1:34:24] if you don't say Merry Christmas oh
[1:34:28] you're not a Christian huh you know I've
[1:34:31] had people say that at work they say
[1:34:33] well you getting a bunch of gifts in a
[1:34:35] tree now and I say no and I say we don't
[1:34:38] worship Christmas like you do he well I
[1:34:40] thought you was a
[1:34:42] Christian because it's the way that
[1:34:44] people assimilate to tradition and
[1:34:47] what's been brought into America as what
[1:34:50] Christianity is Christianity is the body
[1:34:54] of Christ that's what the argument was
[1:34:58] during the
[1:34:59] Reformation it was a it was a national
[1:35:02] church but the True Vine believed that
[1:35:05] it was those that had repented and
[1:35:08] accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior
[1:35:10] and was baptized and were born into the
[1:35:14] kingdom it was those that was born again
[1:35:17] by one spirit and baptized into one body
[1:35:21] but the organized Church said it's this
[1:35:23] we're Lutheran this one said we're
[1:35:25] Calvin this one said we're we're um
[1:35:29] Libertarians whatever it be but the true
[1:35:33] church the church that God that Christ
[1:35:36] is
[1:35:37] building by one Spirit were baptized
[1:35:40] into one body he's not building Nations
[1:35:44] so when a man is trying to preserve
[1:35:46] Christianity like Peter was trying to
[1:35:48] protect Jesus Christ now they're playing
[1:35:51] into the hands of sa and inspired by
[1:35:59] Satan Tony Perkins the president of the
[1:36:01] Family Resources said Trump is committed
[1:36:04] to undoing the anti-faith
[1:36:07] policies of the previous aministration
[1:36:10] and restoring true religion true
[1:36:13] religious freedom Trump said that we are
[1:36:16] stopping cold the attacks on Judo
[1:36:19] Christian values he said America is a
[1:36:23] ation of Believers and together we are
[1:36:26] strengthened by the power of prayer he
[1:36:29] was the he he he as the President of the
[1:36:32] United States has recognized Jerusalem
[1:36:35] as the Eternal capital of Jerusalem and
[1:36:38] is initiating the move the moving of our
[1:36:41] Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Trump
[1:36:45] also in instituted the Bible study in
[1:36:48] the white house for his cabinet members
[1:36:50] and any others who would like to attend
[1:36:53] first time in a hundred
[1:36:56] years and I
[1:36:58] said sounds like Constantine to
[1:37:02] me because he's Champion the cause of
[1:37:06] Christianity and yet he's
[1:37:09] unconverted now watch watch
[1:37:13] now so now we're in
[1:37:17] 2024 and so we've been talking about
[1:37:19] Christian nationalism which he has
[1:37:21] embraced
[1:37:27] and they're afraid that we are that we
[1:37:29] are losing our identity and our freedom
[1:37:32] if we do not preserve our cultural
[1:37:36] inheritance in Christian
[1:37:39] nationalism and I'm just trying to skip
[1:37:42] over some of
[1:37:45] this and this last
[1:37:49] Easter so
[1:37:51] Biden appoints the same day as
[1:37:54] Easter as the
[1:37:57] transgender um visibility day whatever
[1:38:01] that is on
[1:38:04] Easter and so
[1:38:06] Trump this is what he says happy Holy
[1:38:09] Week let's make America pray again as we
[1:38:14] lead into Good Friday and
[1:38:17] Easter I encourage you to get a copy of
[1:38:21] the God bless the America B ible Trump
[1:38:25] wrote in a post all Americans need a
[1:38:28] Bible in their home and I have many it's
[1:38:32] my favorite book Trump said in this
[1:38:34] video posted on Truth social I am proud
[1:38:38] to endorse and encourage you to get uh
[1:38:41] this Bible we must make America Pray
[1:38:44] Again The Bible will also feature now
[1:38:48] this is interesting I don't know if any
[1:38:50] of you have ever seen this or heard
[1:38:51] about it but uh the picture that I saw
[1:38:55] of it uh on the news it's a it's a Bible
[1:38:59] and across the front there's an American
[1:39:03] flag an American
[1:39:06] flag and a Bible a
[1:39:09] city and a tower right civil power the
[1:39:14] United
[1:39:15] States and a Bible that's interesting
[1:39:18] and in this
[1:39:20] Bible what they were calling the Trump
[1:39:22] Bible now he calls it the God Bless
[1:39:24] America
[1:39:26] Bible religion um he said this Bible
[1:39:30] will also feature in this Bible the
[1:39:34] United States
[1:39:36] Constitution the Declaration of
[1:39:39] Independence the Bill of Rights the
[1:39:42] pledge allegiance as well as a
[1:39:45] handwritten chorus of God bless the
[1:39:48] United or the USA according to the
[1:39:51] website that's interesting isn't it now
[1:39:55] we've got political power and religious
[1:39:59] power in one book a symbol of a
[1:40:04] theocracy that's how close we are that's
[1:40:08] right they got a Bible Constitution Bill
[1:40:12] of Rights pledge allegiance American
[1:40:15] flag on the
[1:40:17] front and they're wanting to make
[1:40:21] America a Christian Nation which is a
[1:40:25] theocracy in order to have a theocracy
[1:40:28] you have to have what we would call a
[1:40:31] state religion it's called an
[1:40:33] established
[1:40:35] religion the first thing they have to do
[1:40:39] is
[1:40:40] nullify the First Amendment the first
[1:40:43] amendment is what was holding the dragon
[1:40:47] back it already had its roots but it
[1:40:50] held it from being empowered once you do
[1:40:53] do away with the
[1:40:55] Constitution and they're even saying
[1:40:57] well you know we want the Bible to be
[1:41:00] the absolute now in order to make the
[1:41:04] Bible the absolute we've got to get rid
[1:41:07] of the Constitution because the
[1:41:10] Constitution is the absolute and it's
[1:41:13] bible-based so let's go to the
[1:41:17] original you know we got a messenger and
[1:41:20] we've got
[1:41:21] messages and they come from the Bible so
[1:41:24] why not just lay the message and the
[1:41:26] messenger aside and go back to the Bible
[1:41:28] to the
[1:41:30] original but that's where they were
[1:41:32] before the prophet came yeah so now when
[1:41:37] you have the Bible as the absolute and
[1:41:40] we push the Constitution away because
[1:41:43] it's only bible-based now now the
[1:41:45] problem is who's going to interpret this
[1:41:49] for you there's the problem the problem
[1:41:53] problem is not having Jesus Christ over
[1:41:55] you but who's communion with him who's
[1:41:57] getting the instructions that's right
[1:42:00] who's the
[1:42:01] diviner yes yes sir you see what I'm
[1:42:04] saying and then if the Bible we go to
[1:42:07] straight to the absolute well that's
[1:42:09] good but if it's not inspired of the
[1:42:11] Holy Ghost what have you got what do you
[1:42:14] got with a church that goes to an
[1:42:16] absolute but doesn't have the Holy
[1:42:19] Spirit the right interpreter the holy
[1:42:21] spirit is the only Divine interpreter to
[1:42:24] the word that's right that's why you
[1:42:27] must be born again you must have the
[1:42:29] Holy
[1:42:31] Spirit it's God that's going to teach
[1:42:34] you I was looking back this
[1:42:39] Kingdom we just
[1:42:42] uh yeah well we're just running out of
[1:42:46] time but that's the way it is because
[1:42:48] we're creatures of time right now but
[1:42:51] there will come a time that we will'll
[1:42:53] be more free we'll have a million years
[1:42:56] but uh or a thousand years I'm sorry but
[1:42:59] right now we don't have a thousand
[1:43:02] years so now I've got to figure out what
[1:43:04] I'm going to do here but this
[1:43:08] Kingdom I wanted to I wanted to go back
[1:43:12] to
[1:43:13] Genesis that this Kingdom that you and I
[1:43:17] are contending
[1:43:19] for Jesus said if my kingdom was of this
[1:43:25] Earth then we'd fight for it but he said
[1:43:28] my kingdom is not from this Earth it's
[1:43:31] from its origin its Authority comes from
[1:43:36] God now in the beginning God created man
[1:43:40] and he set him over he set him over the
[1:43:44] Earth in all
[1:43:49] life that was his Dominion
[1:43:53] that was his kingdom yeah and Adam was
[1:43:56] the King and his authority came from God
[1:44:00] God set that Kingdom up yeah not Adam it
[1:44:04] wasn't of the world it wasn't from some
[1:44:06] World System that's what Jesus is saying
[1:44:09] it's not from the earth it's not the
[1:44:11] Roman government it's not the Greek
[1:44:13] government it's not any government this
[1:44:16] Authority doesn't come from any human
[1:44:18] power it comes from Heaven he never
[1:44:21] denied he was a king
[1:44:23] he said the kingdom if my kingdom if my
[1:44:27] subjects if this kingdom was of this
[1:44:30] world we'd be at War but my kingdom is
[1:44:33] not of this world and he was at war with
[1:44:41] Satan you said but it's not not from
[1:44:44] this Earth it's not from this world
[1:44:47] Listen Adam's Kingdom it was created by
[1:44:51] God and God set Adam over over the world
[1:44:56] and over all living
[1:44:58] life and then in this perfect world that
[1:45:02] he had created and he looked and he said
[1:45:04] everything is good then in the middle of
[1:45:07] it he takes and he creates The Garden of
[1:45:09] the
[1:45:10] Eden and in the Garden of Eden he
[1:45:13] creates Adam Out of the Dust of the
[1:45:15] earth and then he takes Adam and he puts
[1:45:17] them in the Garden of Eden that's the
[1:45:20] throne
[1:45:21] room that's where the throne
[1:45:23] is and he's to rule have dominion he's
[1:45:28] to subdue and take control of all the
[1:45:31] world and it was designed that way right
[1:45:35] it was designed to have a king a
[1:45:37] Shepherd that's what a true king in the
[1:45:40] kingdom of God is is a Shepherd he's not
[1:45:43] a royal king having people wash his feet
[1:45:45] and bow down and
[1:45:47] treasures Jesus Christ is our King he's
[1:45:51] our
[1:45:51] Shepherd David was a Shepherd
[1:45:55] king and the word over in Matthew where
[1:45:58] it talks about and he shall rule it's
[1:46:01] talking about a Shepherd feeding his
[1:46:04] sheep yeah that's what a real king does
[1:46:07] that's what we're made Kings and Priests
[1:46:10] and people thinking of castles and
[1:46:12] Thrones and but we're Shepherds we're
[1:46:15] Shepherd Kings and
[1:46:18] Priests to feed the people and lead the
[1:46:21] people in in the way of God
[1:46:25] Amen so he set Adam and he came down and
[1:46:28] he met with Adam that was the holiest of
[1:46:32] holies that was where the throne was
[1:46:34] that God would come down and fellowship
[1:46:37] with Adam but Adam
[1:46:40] fell he walked away from the
[1:46:44] throne his wife had fallen and he had to
[1:46:48] leave the throne to go to her side to
[1:46:52] try to redeem her to embrace her in love
[1:46:56] and he walked away from the throne he
[1:46:58] was a Fallen King he lost his kingdom
[1:47:01] and the kingdom
[1:47:04] fell and God's three-fold purpose is to
[1:47:07] do
[1:47:09] what number one he wanted to reveal
[1:47:13] himself to the people and he did that
[1:47:16] through Christ he wanted to come to the
[1:47:19] Earth and be a human being among amongst
[1:47:23] his people human beings he wanted to he
[1:47:27] wanted to take Jehovah as he was in that
[1:47:30] form the pillar of fire a whirlwind and
[1:47:34] all the different forms that he
[1:47:37] appeared and he tabernacled himself in a
[1:47:41] human body and God identified himself
[1:47:45] something that you and I could talk to
[1:47:48] we we look in the scriptures we see him
[1:47:49] take the children and put them on his on
[1:47:52] their lap we see him talk to the woman
[1:47:54] at the well the compassion we see him
[1:47:57] feed the 2,000 the 3,000 the 5,000 we
[1:48:01] see the compassion we see the humanity
[1:48:04] we see the love we see the anger when he
[1:48:07] walked into the church into the house
[1:48:10] and they'd made it a den of Thieves and
[1:48:12] and made merchandise out of religion and
[1:48:15] he took a three qued sash he was human
[1:48:18] and he didn't get mad at somebody would
[1:48:21] steal some money from him but when he
[1:48:22] saw what they did to the H House of God
[1:48:25] and anger him said this is a House of
[1:48:27] Prayer it's not a house of business this
[1:48:30] is not a house of merchandise this is
[1:48:32] not where people come to make money and
[1:48:34] give money this is where we come to
[1:48:36] worship God right but what have they
[1:48:40] made out of
[1:48:43] churches it's a place that we come and
[1:48:46] worship he was a human being that's the
[1:48:48] one that we
[1:48:50] identify how much do you identify
[1:48:53] with
[1:48:54] Jehovah you read about Jehovah in the
[1:48:57] Old
[1:48:57] Testament and the closest we can come is
[1:49:00] oh I'd like to meet him job said if I
[1:49:04] knew where his seat was where his throne
[1:49:06] is I'd go knock on his door that's
[1:49:09] what's in every True believer's Heart we
[1:49:11] want to find
[1:49:13] him but how can you identify with a with
[1:49:17] a a Jehovah a pillar of fire that would
[1:49:20] be an amazing experience as the angel of
[1:49:23] the Lord that'd be something else but to
[1:49:26] see him as a man to sit around the
[1:49:28] campfire with him to lay your head on
[1:49:31] his bosom to hear words of comfort to
[1:49:34] hear words of Correction as a human
[1:49:37] being what do we identify with we
[1:49:40] identify with Jesus Christ not Jehovah
[1:49:43] not the pillar of
[1:49:46] fire you it's hard to sit down and hold
[1:49:49] hands with a pillar of fire it's hard to
[1:49:52] put your arm around the pillar of fire
[1:49:55] but if that Pillar of Fire tabernacled
[1:49:58] itself in human flesh and become
[1:50:01] man he wanted something you could
[1:50:04] identify yourself with
[1:50:08] amen and
[1:50:11] then all Jehovah was he poured into
[1:50:16] Christ then all that Christ was he
[1:50:18] poured into the church amen he said on
[1:50:23] this
[1:50:24] rock I'll build my
[1:50:26] church and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:50:30] Prevail against it that's the same
[1:50:32] promise that he give to
[1:50:35] Abraham it's the same promise he gave to
[1:50:38] Rebecca it's the same promise he gave to
[1:50:41] the Seed of
[1:50:42] Abraham that the gates of hell that they
[1:50:46] will not Prevail against them the Gate
[1:50:48] of the enemy will not Prevail against
[1:50:51] them listen it's not not just a church
[1:50:53] it's a people the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:50:56] Prevail against you it shows that it's
[1:50:59] going to be in contention it's going to
[1:51:02] come against you death is going to come
[1:51:04] against you religion's going to come

[1:51:15] soul listen when they Clos the gates of
[1:51:18] Gaza to lock Samson in the gates could
[1:51:21] not prevail he took the gates and
[1:51:24] carried them off to a hill laid him down
[1:51:26] and kept on going

[1:51:57] say now who's going to teach
[1:52:00] you am I going to teach you what to
[1:52:02] say or is the holy spirit going to teach
[1:52:05] you come on who's the teacher
[1:52:08] today listen it's it's it's it's The Man
[1:52:11] Behind the pulpit that's a Divine
[1:52:14] gift but there's a Divine gift in you if
[1:52:16] you don't have the Divine teacher in you
[1:52:19] the Divine teaching up here is not going
[1:52:20] to do you any good it's just going to
[1:52:23] fall on your ears and end up in the in
[1:52:25] the Corral of your brain but it's meant
[1:52:28] to go down into the heart and the Holy
[1:52:30] Spirit the only one that puts it down
[1:52:32] there he's the only Divine interpreter
[1:52:34] of the word he is the shepherd he's the
[1:52:37] king shepherd he's The Shepherd of your

[1:52:42] soul to keep
[1:52:46] youen it's not the law that keeps you
[1:52:49] it's not the church that keeps you it's
[1:52:52] the holy spirit it's the life he that
[1:52:55] has the son has life not he that has the
[1:52:59] prophet not he that has the message not
[1:53:02] he that has the Bible but he that has
[1:53:05] the son has life amen and then all of
[1:53:09] that becomes your domain your
[1:53:11] inheritance we're coming to an
[1:53:14] adoption what is the
[1:53:17] adoption galatian says in the in the
[1:53:21] fullness of time
[1:53:23] God sent his
[1:53:24] son that's
[1:53:26] Calvary in the fullness of
[1:53:29] time God sent his
[1:53:31] son that's
[1:53:33] Calvary that he might redeem
[1:53:37] us why why were you redeemed so you
[1:53:40] could be a Christian so you get the Holy
[1:53:43] Ghost and live a good life he redeemed
[1:53:46] us that we might
[1:53:48] receive the adoption of sons you you
[1:53:52] know what the adoption
[1:53:53] is that's receiving your
[1:53:57] inheritance because the adoption of the
[1:53:59] King's son when he's placed in adoption
[1:54:02] he's placed in the throne so he his
[1:54:05] inheritance as a prince is the kingdom
[1:54:08] the throne and so in his adoption he's
[1:54:12] brought to the throne and set in his
[1:54:14] position we're coming to the
[1:54:17] fullness of our adoption yes and all
[1:54:20] hell is against it right when that
[1:54:23] Throne fell the kingdom fell back in the
[1:54:26] in Genesis in the Garden of Eden the
[1:54:29] whole thing
[1:54:30] fell listen when the bride was wakened
[1:54:34] when the Lord descended with a shout it
[1:54:37] Not only was the bride awaken Not only
[1:54:39] was a foolish awaken but I want to tell
[1:54:42] you what creation was awakened and it
[1:54:45] began to groan and
[1:54:48] travail for the manifestation of the
[1:54:51] sons of God because creation fell and
[1:54:55] creation is to be restored because
[1:54:57] creation is our Dominion amen and we are
[1:55:01] now in restoration we are now born again
[1:55:05] we are now redeemed and why were you
[1:55:08] redeemed that you might receive the
[1:55:10] adoption we sealed unto the adoption
[1:55:14] we're predestinated unto adoption we
[1:55:17] have an inheritance being predestinated
[1:55:21] when you receive the Hool Holy Ghost you
[1:55:23] not only become a son and daughter of
[1:55:25] God you become an heir an heir of what a
[1:55:32] kingdom the second fold is to gain the
[1:55:36] preeminence in a people hallelujah in a
[1:55:40] church and he does that by coming and
[1:55:44] living in you what's the third fold
[1:55:47] purpose to restore the kingdom back
[1:55:51] these people are are good intentions
[1:55:55] they're trying to put prayer back in
[1:55:56] school they're trying to do away with
[1:55:59] all this abortion and all these laws
[1:56:01] have been passed against Christian
[1:56:03] Christian values against Christian
[1:56:06] families against uh what God has called
[1:56:09] us to do they're trying to get to a
[1:56:12] place to make it illegal for us to be
[1:56:14] Christians so the effort is to make
[1:56:17] America a Christian Nation listen God
[1:56:20] ain't call us to politic
[1:56:23] God has called us to preach the gospel
[1:56:26] to live the gospel to be a
[1:56:29] light because it ain't going to be long
[1:56:32] we're going to be out of
[1:56:36] here we don't want to do
[1:56:39] something because we have good
[1:56:43] intentions we want to find God's perfect
[1:56:47] will am and when we're with the word the
[1:56:50] word is with us
[1:56:56] right it's not just what it's
[1:57:01] how it's How David came into
[1:57:05] correction and listen when when he put
[1:57:08] that
[1:57:09] Ark on the shoulders of those
[1:57:13] priests and they made three
[1:57:17] steps God strengthened
[1:57:20] them when we do things according to the
[1:57:23] word of God come on in divine order yes
[1:57:28] it taken a
[1:57:30] profet to come and to give us
[1:57:33] instructions because the world had just
[1:57:36] they had put all their instructions and
[1:57:38] all their traditions and we could not
[1:57:42] pull the
[1:57:44] full
[1:57:46] nutritional spiritual of this
[1:57:50] word brother Bren didn't give us the
[1:57:53] word God gave us the word he sent a
[1:57:57] prophet to give us the
[1:57:58] instructions and how to throw Nutri
[1:58:01] nutritional value and
[1:58:04] strength from this
[1:58:06] word by whitewashing by getting all of
[1:58:10] man's ideas and
[1:58:11] Theology and bringing us back to the
[1:58:14] word to the original Faith
[1:58:19] amen God sent a prophet
[1:58:23] listen it's not you just was woken
[1:58:27] up but look at this world brother
[1:58:29] Brandon preached birth
[1:58:31] pains
[1:58:33] tornadoes
[1:58:35] volcanoes
[1:58:37] hurricanes look at the seasons they're
[1:58:40] all mixed up you used to be able to go
[1:58:43] down to Guyana South America they had a
[1:58:46] dry season and they had a wet season you
[1:58:48] didn't go down there in the wet season
[1:58:50] cuz you couldn't get around in the
[1:58:52] mosquito the malaria was just double and
[1:58:55] so you go down in the dry season now you
[1:58:58] go down there in the dry season and it's
[1:59:01] raining why he said the Earth is in
[1:59:04] birth pains listen she's woken up she's
[1:59:08] groaning and she's travailing Israel was
[1:59:11] groaning and travailing why because it
[1:59:14] was a covenant time we're at a covenant
[1:59:17] time that God is going to come Christ
[1:59:20] said I'll come and receive you onto
[1:59:22] myself we're at that time we're at
[1:59:25] covenant time because the Covenant Angel
[1:59:28] John was a covenant Angel he came and he
[1:59:31] introduced to us God of that age that
[1:59:35] God that hung it and God has sent a
[1:59:38] prophet in this day to introduce Jesus
[1:59:41] Christ to you and me the son of man the
[1:59:44] sign of the word the presence of
[1:59:47] God hallelujah he that has the son
[1:59:52] as
[1:59:53] life he that listened to Moses got
[1:59:57] nutritional value from that
[1:59:59] Mana God sent the Mana but God designed
[2:00:03] it in such a way you had to listen to
[2:00:06] his
[2:00:07] messenger god had a messenger at the
[2:00:10] first Exodus he had a messenger at the
[2:00:13] second Exodus he's got a messenger in
[2:00:15] the Third
[2:00:18] Exodus he fulfilled his commission and
[2:00:21] God pulled him off the
[2:00:23] scene I must diminish and he must
[2:00:26] increase so Christ the holy spirit is
[2:00:29] supposed to be increasing in you and I
[2:00:33] but listen our daily struggles our daily
[2:00:35] battles we're still human
[2:00:39] beings but we have the
[2:00:42] word to meet these battles with through
[2:00:47] faith it's not some kind of a
[2:00:50] remedy well I don't have any money the
[2:00:52] business is not doing good all right I'm
[2:00:55] going to double my ties I'm just going
[2:00:58] to see I'm going to double my ties and
[2:01:00] God will open up the doors of Heaven
[2:01:01] that ain't
[2:01:03] it you know why
[2:01:06] Abraham when he came back from the
[2:01:09] Battle of redemption after he redeemed
[2:01:12] lot you know why he gave tithe it wasn't
[2:01:16] because the church said you have to give
[2:01:19] ties you got to give this you got to do
[2:01:21] that
[2:01:25] it was when MDC told
[2:01:28] him that God had given him that battle
[2:01:32] you go read
[2:01:33] it God gave that battle that Victory to
[2:01:38] Abraham as soon as he heard that it it
[2:01:41] said he offered up tithes of the
[2:01:44] spoils the tithing was
[2:01:47] recognizing that God had given him yes
[2:01:51] God had given him that battle amen God
[2:01:55] has given us our incomes God is going to
[2:01:57] take care of us seek ye first the
[2:01:59] kingdom it's not a matter of doubling
[2:02:01] your ties listen it's not a remedy it's
[2:02:04] not cough
[2:02:05] medicine it it's it's not uh positive
[2:02:09] thinking it's it's it it's not uh how
[2:02:13] we're going to run the business and how
[2:02:14] we're going to make money it's
[2:02:17] worship when he gave that to when he
[2:02:20] gave uh that that tithing he was
[2:02:24] confessing that God had given that that
[2:02:27] Victory to
[2:02:30] him it was
[2:02:36] worship I'm going to read one scripture
[2:02:38] and then I'm going to close I want to
[2:02:41] turn to Hebrews
[2:02:42] 2 Hebrews let me see if I find it on
[2:02:46] here I can read it
[2:02:49] better and then we'll close Hebrew
[2:02:51] Hebrews chapter
[2:02:57] 2 let me find
[2:03:07] it let me let me start at verse one if I
[2:03:13] can we're at
[2:03:15] 12:30 actually
[2:03:17] 1229 and A2 I think sorry got 30 seconds
[2:03:25] therefore we ought to give more Earnest
[2:03:28] heed to the things which we have heard
[2:03:32] lest at any time we should let them
[2:03:36] slip so he's talking about giving
[2:03:39] heed to the things that we've heard
[2:03:41] we're not talking about news we're not
[2:03:44] talking about what I told you about
[2:03:45] Trump we're talking about the gospel of
[2:03:49] word amen what's been delivered to us Us
[2:03:51] in this day
[2:03:55] amen you know sometimes you you can pull
[2:04:00] up I was talking to a young girl one
[2:04:03] time and I said you better be careful
[2:04:07] it's like you're in a boat and you're
[2:04:09] out the end of the pier and it's not
[2:04:11] tied off and if you sit there just kind
[2:04:14] of watching the clouds and things you
[2:04:16] won't know but the boat will start to
[2:04:19] drift and you know you can reach out and
[2:04:22] grab the the the pier real quick but if
[2:04:25] you get the what we used to call Lolly
[2:04:27] gagging around you might find yourself
[2:04:31] out
[2:04:32] there without a paddle and you'll let
[2:04:35] you'll let the pier slip by that's what
[2:04:38] it means with just in
[2:04:41] attention just let it slip
[2:04:48] by for if the word spoken by angels was
[2:04:51] steadfast in every transgression and
[2:04:53] Disobedience received a just recompense
[2:04:56] of
[2:04:57] reward now listen to this how shall we
[2:05:02] escape if we
[2:05:04] neglect so great a
[2:05:07] Salvation which at the first began to be
[2:05:10] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[2:05:14] unto us by them that heard him God also
[2:05:19] bearing them witness both with signs and
[2:05:21] wonders and with diverse Miracles and
[2:05:25] Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[2:05:27] own
[2:05:28] will For unto the
[2:05:31] angels have he not put in subjection the
[2:05:35] world to come wherefore we speak who who
[2:05:40] did he put the world not not the world
[2:05:43] past not the world present but also the
[2:05:47] world to come who did he put it
[2:05:50] under but one in a certain place
[2:05:54] testified saying what is man that thou
[2:05:58] art mindful of him or the son of manth
[2:06:02] him that mest him a little lower than
[2:06:05] the
[2:06:07] angels that crowned that crownest him
[2:06:11] with glory and honor and Des set him
[2:06:14] over the works of thy
[2:06:18] hands he's talking about back there with
[2:06:21] Adam
[2:06:23] but he's also talking about the world
[2:06:26] that's to come who set over it you and
[2:06:29] me because we're the sons of God that's
[2:06:32] and our
[2:06:34] inheritance is that Kingdom that fell
[2:06:38] that God now is restoring you and
[2:06:41] me back to our
[2:06:44] kingship at the manifestation of the
[2:06:48] sons of God to even to the changing of
[2:06:51] our bod's
[2:06:53] adoption and he says if we
[2:06:58] neglect so great a Salvation if we
[2:07:01] neglect so great a
[2:07:04] message not just the scriptures but God
[2:07:07] has sent a
[2:07:08] messenger the Lord descended he when he
[2:07:11] came to Moses he said I've come down
[2:07:15] listen
[2:07:16] Revelation
[2:07:18] 101 I the Lord have come down right
[2:07:22] another Mighty Angel
[2:07:24] Christ Covenant time rainbow over his
[2:07:28] head 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord shall
[2:07:32] he send with a shout a message he said
[2:07:35] Moses he said you're going to be my
[2:07:37] mouth I'm going to be with your mouth
[2:07:39] I'm going to teach you what to say God
[2:07:41] sent a prophet that was his mouth and he
[2:07:44] taught him what to say he said I was
[2:07:46] only there when he said
[2:07:49] this if we neglect
[2:07:52] listen there's those that never received
[2:07:54] it they rejected it it's not talking
[2:07:57] about those that rejected it it's those
[2:07:59] that have received it and now are
[2:08:02] beginning to neglect
[2:08:05] it I find it easy to build a house but
[2:08:10] then maintaining the
[2:08:13] house I become negligent I can build new
[2:08:18] houses but but then to maintain if we
[2:08:22] begin to neglect it we won't have a
[2:08:26] house if we
[2:08:28] neglect this salvation that we've
[2:08:31] received if we start getting sidetracked
[2:08:35] into the things of the world and
[2:08:37] problems of the world if we
[2:08:42] neglect just to neglect he said how you
[2:08:46] going to escape in other words the only
[2:08:48] way of
[2:08:49] Escape is the word word of God that's
[2:08:52] right the only salvation is through
[2:08:54] Christ amen and if you neglect that if
[2:08:58] you lose that you're not going to
[2:09:02] escape we don't want to get to a place
[2:09:05] we become cold and
[2:09:07] indifferent because of sickness because
[2:09:11] of
[2:09:11] finances because of domestic problems
[2:09:14] whatever it is all
[2:09:17] right we don't want to
[2:09:20] neglect the word of God that we've
[2:09:23] received where it'll slip away from
[2:09:27] us as we bow our heads Heavenly
[2:09:34] Father Lord those in lay the
[2:09:38] seal Lord they they thought they were
[2:09:41] rich and had need of
[2:09:45] nothing but the spirit of the Lord said

[2:09:50] didn't know it they had
[2:09:53] neglected they had neglected the
[2:09:55] Salvation that they had and now it had
[2:09:58] been slid from them Slipped Away cold
[2:10:02] indifferent whirly worldliness have been
[2:10:06] to creep
[2:10:07] in through
[2:10:10] neglect and through their own
[2:10:12] worldliness the prophet said they ran
[2:10:15] him out Lord we don't want to run you
[2:10:19] out with our neglect
[2:10:22] we don't want it to slip from us this

[2:10:27] love of our
[2:10:29] life we don't want to be like Adam that
[2:10:32] was standing there waiting for you every
[2:10:34] evening and then you created and gave
[2:10:36] him a gift of Eve and then when you came
[2:10:40] he wasn't there his love was turned
[2:10:43] aside for what the gift that you had
[2:10:44] given him Lord we don't want to fall in
[2:10:47] love with the gifts but we want to love
[2:10:50] The Giver of theft

[2:10:54] aside for things that you give us in
[2:10:56] this
[2:10:57] world but Lord we thank you for those
[2:11:00] things that you give
[2:11:02] us but we don't want to neglect you we
