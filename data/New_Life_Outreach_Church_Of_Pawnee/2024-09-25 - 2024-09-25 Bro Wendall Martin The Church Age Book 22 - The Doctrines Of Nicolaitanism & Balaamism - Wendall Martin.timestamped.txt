[19:13] out on the
[19:16] water storm raging
[19:20] High the Waters of around them were
[19:25] troubled that night
[19:29] fear filled their
[19:32] hearts they thought they would die they
[19:37] failed to
[19:40] remember the master was night then he
[19:46] spoke the
[19:48] words the winds all Stood
[19:52] Still even the
[19:56] waters they oy
[19:59] his
[20:00] will he calmed their
[20:04] storms just like he will
[20:08] mine if I'll just
[20:12] remember he lives deep
[20:16] inside so why should I
[20:20] worry why should I
[20:24] fear the very same Jesus
[20:29] he's always so
[20:32] near he lives in my
[20:35] heart he hears when I cry I'll call on
[20:42] his name till the storm passes
[20:47] [Music]
[20:51] by we read in the
[20:55] Bible how he walked with
[20:59] then brought light to the
[21:03] darkness when the way grew so
[21:07] dim how great it would be to have his
[21:12] steps
[21:14] leading mine to walk with the
[21:19] master all of the time but when Trials
[21:27] come and then death is so
[21:30] nigh I search for the
[21:34] master he said he'll be there on
[21:38] time and when I'm in
[21:42] trouble and my body is in pain all I
[21:48] have to do is call on his
[21:54] name so why should I worry
[21:59] why should I
[22:01] fear the very same
[22:05] Jesus is always so
[22:09] near he lives in my
[22:13] heart he hears when I
[22:17] cry I'll call on his name till the storm
[22:22] passes
[22:24] by so why should I worry
[22:30] why should I
[22:32] fear the very same
[22:36] Jesus is always so
[22:40] near he lives in my
[22:43] heart he hears when I
[22:47] cry I'll call on his name till the storm
[22:53] passes
[22:55] by I'll call on his name
[22:59] till the storm passes
[23:03] [Music]

[34:58] nice out there um everyone that worked
[35:02] um the other day and last night and uh
[35:06] that they came out and and uh cut up the
[35:08] limbs and and hauled them off we just
[35:10] say God bless you and um say the
[35:14] pictures and and um you young people and
[35:16] and even you sisters out there working
[35:19] and and to me that's just you know I I
[35:23] I've always wanted to be a part of
[35:24] everything I had some pastoral work I
[35:26] had to do last night or I would have
[35:27] been here too but um uh I I just think
[35:32] it's so wonderful to make it a family
[35:34] effort and um so we just say God bless
[35:38] you it really did look nice and and um
[35:42] and I you know Brotherhood is a is a
[35:45] thing that you have to strive for and um
[35:48] you know there's always going to be um
[35:51] people in every congregation that's just
[35:53] satisfied coming to church and just
[35:55] doing their part there but I I just
[35:58] don't believe
[35:59] that you Christianity is not where you
[36:02] click in and click out it's it's uh it's
[36:05] not a time uh card or or we we just all
[36:09] jump in and we we just see the kingdom
[36:11] of God going on and wanting to do
[36:13] something for the Lord um and and and do
[36:17] it together as in unity and so I was
[36:21] blessed to see that last night and and
[36:23] we just say God bless you it well I tell
[36:26] you what that's a big pile of trees out
[36:28] there Limbs and things and so um and I
[36:32] and I seen the slide platform it didn't
[36:35] it it's it survived it looked like for
[36:36] the most part and um um this time we'll
[36:41] um put it in the
[36:43] ground and uh well we built we had built
[36:46] it out here on the on the parking lot
[36:49] and uh our goal our Our intention was to
[36:53] um have it out here and then end up
[36:54] taking it over to the fellowship hall
[36:56] but after we got it up there we said we
[36:57] ain't moving this thing and the wind
[37:00] said yes we are amen so blew it over but
[37:04] um so it was it it's it is uh it was
[37:07] nice for that we appreciate you Brothers
[37:09] doing that as well praise the Lord let's
[37:12] look here um we're going to start at
[37:15] page
[37:17] 197 and um we're going to start there um
[37:21] the doctrine of the nick
[37:23] itans uh and and we will um
[37:29] we we have already read that verse so
[37:31] we're not going to read that again so
[37:33] we'll just start down to that other
[37:34] paragraph it says you will recall that I
[37:38] brought uh out in the Ephesian
[37:41] age that the word nickan comes from two
[37:45] Greek words NOA which means to conquer
[37:49] and Leo which means the
[37:51] Ley letin means to conquer the Ley which
[37:56] which is why uh uh now why is this such
[38:00] a terrible thing it is terrible because
[38:03] God has never placed his church in the
[38:06] hands of an elected leadership which
[38:09] with uh which moves with political
[38:11] mindness he has placed his church in the
[38:14] care of God ordained Spirit-filled word
[38:18] living men who lead the the people
[38:21] through the feeding them with the
[38:24] word he has not separated people into
[38:27] classes
[38:28] so that the masses are led by a holy
[38:30] priesthood it is true that the
[38:32] leadership must be
[38:35] holy but uh but then so must the whole
[38:39] congregation further there is no place
[38:41] in the word where priest or ministers or
[38:44] such mediate between God and the people
[38:47] there is no place where they are
[38:49] separated in their worship of the Lord
[38:52] God wants all to love and to serve him
[38:56] together nickan ISM destroys those
[39:00] precepts and instead separates the
[39:02] ministers from the people and makes the
[39:05] ministers overlords o overlords instead
[39:09] of servants now I I think this is this
[39:12] is so important because and this is the
[39:15] reason why um any of us that are in the
[39:17] leadership position it's not just now
[39:20] that's not now it is it is for the
[39:22] five-fold ministry for sure then that's
[39:24] what we're dealing with here um and and
[39:27] especially that of a of a pastor but
[39:31] it's so important if we had that kind of
[39:35] mentality amen and under have that
[39:37] understanding uh in our homes for you
[39:40] brothers and dealing with your wives and
[39:42] your children uh you wives you mamas
[39:45] that are dealing with your children we
[39:47] we we don't just we don't want to come
[39:50] across as overlords we we're not we we
[39:53] we should be selfless in the fact that
[39:56] uh uh you know uh um it it should not be
[40:00] me me me this is not this is not about
[40:04] me this again this is about a team amen
[40:09] and whether it's the whether it's it's
[40:11] it's um uh you know brother Robert and
[40:14] sister uh Brianna back there with no
[40:16] children they're still a team they're
[40:18] they're a part of the M marriage
[40:20] covenant or or whether it be Kobe and
[40:22] Mary with with their children it's the
[40:25] family as a team uh
[40:27] whe whether it's here as the you know me
[40:30] as pastor and and and then uh uh uh the
[40:35] musicians we're we're Team song leaders
[40:38] deacons trustees and so what there is
[40:41] there is no Overlord there has to be
[40:44] leadership but it's for one common goal
[40:48] and and that is amen for the furtherance
[40:52] of the family the furtherance of the
[40:54] Gospel the furtherance of the local of
[40:56] the Church of whatever it is and so you
[40:59] you know and and and if you go back
[41:01] we've I I you know i' I've quoted this
[41:02] many of times but over there in 3:30
[41:05] page 330
[41:08] um brother brother Branham would talk
[41:11] about one that that that a wrong spirit
[41:16] this is this is the way a wrong Spirit
[41:19] works and and again sometimes we want to
[41:21] put this with just being preachers but
[41:24] you leaders you men and and and leading
[41:27] your family you mamas in in teaching
[41:30] your children you know you you've you've
[41:32] got to uh and I've and I've had y'all to
[41:34] mark this before so um it it is it is
[41:37] halfway down about the middle of the
[41:39] page um it says now in every
[41:44] case um we're just down right below the
[41:47] middle of that page and if you haven't
[41:49] marked it yet then you need to mark it
[41:51] amen now in every case you will notice
[41:55] that a false prophet is one who is
[41:57] outside the word can you say Amen now
[42:00] that's any kind of a leader that is
[42:02] whether it be Pastor evangelist Prophet
[42:04] teacher husband uh uh a deacon or or
[42:08] whatever anybody in that leadership
[42:10] position it says now outside the word
[42:13] just as we have showed you that
[42:16] Antichrist means anti- word so these
[42:19] false prophets come perverting the word
[42:22] giving it a meaning that fits their own
[42:25] somebody say own devilish ends have you
[42:29] ever noticed how that people who lead
[42:31] others astray bind them closely to
[42:36] themselves by fear so a man that is
[42:39] constantly that's just constantly
[42:42] keeping his his wife under his thumb
[42:45] that's an evil spirit those you you you
[42:48] that are that are that are constantly
[42:50] manipulating even your children that's
[42:52] an evil spirit amen we have a reason for
[42:57] our leadership it is not to make
[43:01] something or or to to to build around
[43:04] yourself you are we are building around
[43:08] the scripture we're never building
[43:11] around us and our demands were building
[43:16] around the scripture and the scripture
[43:19] has placed the the the husband as the
[43:21] head of the wife and the the wife is to
[43:23] take care of the children and and govern
[43:25] the home and those so we want we fall so
[43:28] the The Authority is there but we're
[43:31] doing it under the authority of the
[43:36] scripture so as pastors I can only lead
[43:40] you as I feed you so every one of us and
[43:45] as leadership and this is something for
[43:46] you for for you young men amen y'all
[43:49] keep that in your mind as well because
[43:51] we all because because we're all leaders
[43:53] amen us men are called to be leaders
[43:55] that's just all there is to it we're all
[43:56] supposed to to be leaders in in whether
[43:58] it be in our family some's going to be
[44:00] leaders in in business some's going to
[44:01] be lead you know but but we are but but
[44:03] men are called to lead and and we want
[44:06] to always keep that in our mind as as we
[44:09] look at this God give me the heart of a
[44:13] servant so that I can truly follow you
[44:17] in order to lead others can you say Amen
[44:20] so you want to be that kind of a leader
[44:24] now it says um it says have you noticed
[44:27] that uh lead themselves
[44:30] astray um bind themselves closely by
[44:32] fear and they say that if people don't
[44:34] do what they say or if they leave then
[44:37] destruction will follow they are false
[44:39] prophets for a true Prophet will always
[44:41] lead one to the word and bind the people
[44:44] to Jesus Christ he won't tell them to
[44:46] fear Him or what he says but to fear
[44:49] what the word says notice how these
[44:52] people like Judas are out for money now
[44:54] we're not going to go on through that so
[44:55] but I just wanted to bring that
[44:57] uh uh uh bring that back in let's go
[44:59] back to page
[45:00] 197 now now again he says nickel adism
[45:05] destroys those precepts and instead
[45:07] separates ministers from the people
[45:08] making ministers or the leaders
[45:10] overlords instead of
[45:12] servants now this Doctrine actually
[45:14] started as a deed in the first age it
[45:18] appears that the problem laid in the two
[45:20] words Elders presbyter overseers Bishops
[45:24] though uh though scripture shows that
[45:27] there are several Elders in each church
[45:30] and some ignacius among them uh began to
[45:33] teach that the idea of a bishop was one
[45:37] of preeminence or authority or control
[45:40] over the elders now now the truth of the
[45:44] matter is the word Elder signifies who
[45:47] the person is while the word Bishop
[45:50] signifies the office of the same man now
[45:54] I don't have I don't have the uh my
[45:57] chalkboard up here but now so so there
[46:00] are Elders in this congregation there's
[46:03] there's a bunch of us
[46:05] Elders uh that that are here and and the
[46:08] and the and the scripture and it says
[46:10] the Elder is is the man the bishop is
[46:13] the office Elder always has and always
[46:16] will refer to Simply to a man's
[46:19] chronological age in the Lord he is an
[46:21] elder not because he is elected or
[46:23] ordained Etc but because he is older
[46:27] he is more seasoned trained not a novice
[46:31] reliable because of experience
[46:33] long-standing proof of his Christian
[46:36] experience but no the Bishops did not
[46:39] stick to the Epistles of Paul but rather
[46:42] they went to Paul's account of the time
[46:44] he called the elders from Ephesus uh to
[46:48] to meias uh Amen in in Acts 20 in verse
[46:53] 17 the record States Elders were called
[46:55] and then in 28 um they are called
[46:58] overseers
[47:00] Bishops and these Bishops no doubt
[47:02] political minded and anxious for power
[47:04] insisted that Paul had given the meaning
[47:07] that overseers were more than local
[47:10] Elder than than the local Elder with the
[47:12] official capacity in his own church to
[47:15] them a bishop was now with extended
[47:17] authority over many local leaders in the
[47:21] different churches uh such as a concept
[47:24] such concept was neither scriptural nor
[47:27] historical yet even a man of the stature
[47:30] of polycarp lean toward such
[47:32] organization thus uh that which started
[47:35] as a deed in the first age was made
[47:37] aital Doctrine and so it is today
[47:40] Bishops still control uh claim uh Power
[47:43] to control men and deal with them as
[47:45] they desire placing them where they so
[47:47] will in the ministry this denies the
[47:50] leadership of the Holy Ghost who said
[47:52] separate me Paul and Barnabas for the
[47:54] work whereinto I have called them this
[47:57] is anti- word and
[47:59] Antichrist now so so what brother
[48:03] Brenham is dealing with is in the
[48:04] organizational world you have got your
[48:07] you have got your your your pastor then
[48:11] you have got the bishop they don't they
[48:13] don't consider the pastor as the bishop
[48:15] they they have a bishop that is over a a
[48:18] a region of pastors and then you've also
[48:21] got those and it just and it goes up and
[48:23] up and up and up and up until everyone
[48:26] is controlled it's all the the control
[48:28] is is trickled down until the local
[48:31] Elder the local Pastor uh has no
[48:35] jurisdiction he can't he can't say what
[48:37] he's what what the scripture says
[48:39] because the organization says you have
[48:41] to baptize in Trinity baptism and so now
[48:44] he has he doesn't have the ability to
[48:48] follow the word of God he doesn't have
[48:50] the say if not he loses his pension he
[48:52] loses his his his his his church he
[48:56] loses it oh and and as we we we were
[48:58] talking uh my wife and I were talking
[49:00] today about the um uh here in in in paon
[49:05] E some years back with um the Methodist
[49:09] Church and so uh you you all we all know
[49:12] that the Methodist Church has become so
[49:14] liberal uh you know until they're
[49:16] they're ordaining lesbians and and and
[49:19] and a lot of that kind of stuff well um
[49:22] what was what was that pastor's name uh
[49:26] yeah Clen Dozer so Clen Dozer who I did
[49:29] not agree with at all um theologically
[49:33] but yet he had he had enough gumption uh
[49:37] to stand against it and so uh he was the
[49:40] the Methodist Church was across the
[49:43] street from the school and so he would
[49:45] feed all of those Middle School uh
[49:48] students any of them that would want to
[49:50] come uh down in the basement he would
[49:51] feed him and um and and would teach to
[49:54] him teach him and he and he had quite an
[49:56] audience
[49:57] and uh um but he and he and he started
[50:00] preaching against
[50:02] homosexuality and and so it the word got
[50:06] back to the uh what you know all the
[50:10] chains of command up and they had a
[50:12] meeting and told him either he's going
[50:14] to have to recant that uh uh or or he's
[50:17] going to have to you know and they they
[50:19] gave him the options and he says I'm I'm
[50:21] not going to do that now this man um he
[50:26] he ended up being fired let go from the
[50:29] church and lost his pension because of
[50:33] his conviction now I think they went to
[50:35] court and and and and I don't know I
[50:38] think he ended up getting his his
[50:39] retirement pension but that's so sad
[50:42] that that that the word of God has no
[50:45] effect or has has no jurisdiction and so
[50:49] what we should be thankful for and this
[50:51] is why even in the messes church we we
[50:55] must refuse use that that uh that system
[51:00] that nickol letin system that says hey
[51:04] you guys have got to do what we say you
[51:06] do up here in Jeffersonville we will
[51:08] play the tape and you guys you know you
[51:10] can have a pastor by title only but we
[51:13] don't want him up there pastoring or
[51:15] preaching he can push the play now
[51:17] that's not even that's not even close to
[51:20] scriptural but yet we have got hundreds
[51:24] of churches who who the pastor have came
[51:27] under that and have quit preaching and
[51:30] it's and they have come under that
[51:32] nickan spirit and that is not the plan
[51:37] God's church is to be free amen the
[51:41] anointing is to be free the the the
[51:44] power of the holy spirit is to work in
[51:47] that local congregation and it's not
[51:50] just one man the pastor or it's not just
[51:54] but it is the local body alog together
[51:57] that God is is uh has has called being
[52:01] the living organism can you say Amen now
[52:04] so let's go on and
[52:06] um let's see here uh where did we okay
[52:11] so
[52:12] um okay so now we we stop there he says
[52:16] uh separate me Paul and Barnabas for the
[52:18] work where unto I have called them this
[52:20] is anti- and Antichrist Matthew 20
[52:24] 25-28 but Jesus Jesus called them unto
[52:27] him and said ye know that the princes of
[52:31] the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
[52:33] they that are great exercise Authority
[52:37] upon them but it shall not be so among
[52:40] you but whosoever will be great among
[52:43] you let him be your minister whosoever
[52:46] will be Chief among you let him be your
[52:49] servant even as the son of man came not
[52:52] to be ministered unto but to minister to
[52:55] give his life a ransom for many now
[52:59] again you can apply this to the family
[53:01] as well Matthew 238 and9 but uh but be
[53:06] ye not a RAB called Rabbi for one is
[53:09] your master even Christ all ye are
[53:12] Brethren and call no man your father
[53:15] upon the Earth for one is your father
[53:18] which is in
[53:20] heaven now he says in order to clarify
[53:22] this even more let me explain nanism in
[53:25] this way you recall in Revelations 13:3
[53:29] it says and I saw one of his heads as it
[53:32] were wounded to death and his deadly
[53:34] womb was healed and all the world
[53:36] wandered after the Beast now we know the
[53:38] wounded head was the Pagan Roman
[53:42] Empire that great political world power
[53:45] the head rose again as the Roman
[53:48] Catholic spiritual
[53:50] Empire which uh now watch this
[53:54] careful uh what what did political Pagan
[53:57] Rome
[53:58] do uh that was the basis of her success
[54:01] she divided and conquered it was the
[54:04] seed of Rome divide and conquer her iron
[54:07] teeth torn and uh tore and devoured whom
[54:11] uh whom she tore and deved could not
[54:14] rise again as she destroyed Carthage and
[54:16] sold her to the salt the same iron seed
[54:20] remained in her when she arose as the
[54:23] false church and her policy has remained
[54:25] the same divide and conquer that is
[54:28] nickan ISM and God hates it now amen
[54:33] nickan ISM can come right in the church
[54:35] in any form anything to try to divide
[54:39] separate conquer try to bring in my own
[54:41] little opinions amen and and it'll start
[54:44] with this click that click this click
[54:46] God wants no clicks God wants us all as
[54:51] one as as as one Union we are the body
[54:56] of Jesus
[54:58] Christ amen there's no big there's no
[55:02] little there's no Rich there's no poor
[55:04] amen there's no uh goodlooking ugly
[55:08] we're all we're all the children of the
[55:10] most high God can you say Amen
[55:13] now he says now it is well known his
[55:16] it's a well-known historical fact that
[55:18] when this error crept into the church
[55:21] men begin to VY for the office of Bishop
[55:24] with the result that his position that
[55:26] this position was being given the more
[55:30] to the more educated and materially
[55:32] Progressive and politically minded men
[55:35] human knowledge and program began to
[55:37] take over Divine wisdom's place and the
[55:40] Holy Spirit no longer controlled this
[55:43] was indeed a tragic evil for the Bishops
[55:46] begin to maintain that it is no longer
[55:49] required a transparent Christian
[55:51] character to minister either the word or
[55:54] the rights in the church for it was the
[55:56] elements and the ceremony that counted
[55:59] this allowed evil men seducers to Ren
[56:01] the flock with the man-made doctrine of
[56:04] the elevation of Bishops to a place not
[56:06] accorded them in scripture The Next Step
[56:09] was the handing out of graded titles
[56:11] that built up into uh a religious
[56:15] hierarchy soon there were archbishops
[56:17] over Bishops and Cardinals over the
[56:18] archbishops by the time the uh the time
[56:21] of bonfice III there was a pope over all
[56:25] a pontiff
[56:26] what what with the nician doctrine uh
[56:30] and the uh
[56:33] agation
[56:35] Alam all right of Christianity with the
[56:38] Babylonian ISM the net results had to be
[56:43] what Ezekiel Saw in chapters 8 uh in
[56:47] chapter 810 so I went in and saw and
[56:50] behold every form of creeping thing and
[56:52] abominable beast and all the idols of
[56:55] the House of Israel portrayed upon the
[56:57] wall around Revelations 18:2 and he
[57:00] cried with a mighty voice saying bab uh
[57:03] Babylon the great is Fallen is Fallen
[57:05] has become the habitation of devils and
[57:07] the hold of every foul Spirit and the
[57:09] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[57:11] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[57:14] of the wrath of her fornications now
[57:16] this nickan Doctrine this rule that was
[57:20] established in the church did not hit
[57:23] off too well with a lot of the people
[57:25] for they could read the odd epistle or
[57:28] essay on the word written by some Godly
[57:30] person so what did the church do it
[57:33] excommunicated the righteous teachers
[57:35] and burned the Scrolls they said it
[57:38] takes a special education to read and
[57:40] understand the word why even Peter said
[57:43] that many things wrote uh that Paul
[57:45] wrote were hard to understand having
[57:48] taken away the word from the people it
[57:50] soon came to the people listening only
[57:53] to what the priest had to say and doing
[57:56] what he was told what he told
[57:58] them he called um they called that God
[58:02] and His holy word they took over the
[58:05] minds and lives of the people made them
[58:08] Servants of a despotic priesthood now if
[58:11] you want proof that the Catholic demands
[58:14] and uh that the Catholic Church demands
[58:16] the lives and minds of men just listen
[58:19] to the Edict of theodosius uh
[58:22] to and the first edict says this edict
[58:25] was issued immediately after he um was
[58:29] baptized by the First Church of Rome we
[58:32] three Emperors will that our subjects
[58:36] steadfastly adhere to the religion which
[58:38] was taught by the St Peter to the
[58:41] Romans which has been Faithfully
[58:42] preserved by tradition which is now
[58:45] professed by the pontiff Damascus of
[58:47] Rome and Peter Bishop of Alexandria a
[58:51] man of apostolic Holiness according to
[58:53] the institution of the Apostles and the
[58:55] doct of the Gospel let us believe in one
[58:58] godhead of the Father the Son and the
[59:00] Holy Spirit of equal Majesty in the Holy
[59:03] Trinity we order that the adherence of
[59:06] this Faith be called Catholic Christians
[59:09] we brand all senseless followers of
[59:13] other religions with the INF Infamous
[59:16] names of Heretics and forbid their vinal
[59:20] assuming the name of the churches
[59:22] besides the condemnation of divine
[59:24] Justice they must expect heavy penalty
[59:27] with which our Authority given uh Guided
[59:30] by Heavenly wisdom shall think proper to
[59:33] inflict now here here we are now the
[59:36] church has is totally ran by
[59:41] men and and and God is totally out now
[59:45] totally
[59:46] gone the spirit of the Lord can't dwell
[59:49] there the spirit of the Lord can't can't
[59:51] dwell because it's nothing is according
[59:54] to the scripture you see and then you
[59:57] even look and and the next the next uh
[59:59] um paragraph here says and the 15 penal
[1:00:02] laws that this Emperor issued in as many
[1:00:05] years um deprived the evangelicals of
[1:00:09] All rights to exercise their religion
[1:00:12] excluded them from all civil offices
[1:00:14] threatened them with fines confiscation
[1:00:16] banishment and even in some cases death
[1:00:19] do you know what we are headed right
[1:00:23] that way today the Roman Catholic Church
[1:00:27] calls herself the mother church now
[1:00:30] someone someone sent um today I don't
[1:00:33] know if it was someone here but where
[1:00:36] where um where the pope has has declared
[1:00:39] himself uh the the one was that you that
[1:00:41] sent that what um I couldn't get it to
[1:00:43] open they was wanting me to go on so but
[1:00:46] I read a little bit of it um but um uh
[1:00:51] where he is he is declaring a one world
[1:00:54] religion and and so this is this is a a
[1:00:58] a a big deal and I I I can't wait to
[1:01:00] read it um and then I think brother
[1:01:02] Mitch mentioned the other night uh I I
[1:01:04] haven't looked it up but brother mention
[1:01:06] mentioned that he had heard that that
[1:01:08] maybe uh or that that that um uh yeah
[1:01:13] that he endorsed Donald Trump uh for
[1:01:15] president what the these kinds of things
[1:01:18] you know they they they mean a lot and
[1:01:22] uh and and so um sorry I got distracted
[1:01:27] there for a minute amen
[1:01:29] and been there done that
[1:01:33] amen um you get up your foot's asleep
[1:01:36] amen but
[1:01:38] uh but but it's so uh we want we want
[1:01:44] the holy spirit in our lives in our
[1:01:48] churches how many wants the Holy Ghost
[1:01:50] in our church how many wants the Holy
[1:01:52] Ghost in our homes it it's so so
[1:01:56] important it's so important because we
[1:01:59] we make religion and I I I we make
[1:02:01] religion as if just a a you know uh uh
[1:02:05] once or twice a week thing but but
[1:02:08] that's not it the Holy Spirit wants to
[1:02:11] flow in each individual life each
[1:02:13] individual family each individual
[1:02:15] congregation amen and and there is a one
[1:02:19] day he's going to come and take us all
[1:02:21] amen and Rapture us all and give us a
[1:02:23] body change can you say Amen now so he
[1:02:27] says
[1:02:28] now um he says we're headed that
[1:02:32] way right today the Roman Catholic
[1:02:35] Church calls herself the mother
[1:02:37] Church she calls herself the first or
[1:02:40] the original church this is absolutely
[1:02:43] correct she was the the she was the
[1:02:45] original First Church of Rome that
[1:02:47] backslid and went into sin she was the
[1:02:50] first that organized in her was found
[1:02:52] the deeds and then the doctrine of
[1:02:54] nianis
[1:02:56] no one will deny that she is a mother
[1:02:59] she is a mother and has produced
[1:03:01] daughters now a daughter comes out of a
[1:03:03] woman a woman robed in Scarlet is
[1:03:06] sitting in the Seven Hills of
[1:03:08] Rome she is a harlot and is born
[1:03:12] daughters those daughters are the
[1:03:14] Protestant churches that came out of her
[1:03:17] and went right back into organization of
[1:03:20] nanism this mother of the daughter
[1:03:22] Church of this mother of the daughter
[1:03:25] churches called a that is what a
[1:03:28] woman who was untrue to her marriage
[1:03:30] vows she was married to God then went
[1:03:33] off fornicating with the devil and in
[1:03:35] her fornication she has brought forth
[1:03:38] daughters that are just like her this
[1:03:40] mother and daughter combination is anti-
[1:03:43] word anti-p Spirit consequently
[1:03:46] Antichrist yes
[1:03:49] Antichrist now different versions
[1:03:52] totally different versions uh not not
[1:03:54] everyone's pray to to Mary not
[1:03:56] everyone's bowing at statues not
[1:03:58] everyone is uh uh doing those things but
[1:04:02] again that that's why they call mother
[1:04:05] and daughter they they're not the same
[1:04:07] in in that regard she's the Catholic
[1:04:10] church and a Lutheran will never be a
[1:04:12] Catholic a Methodist will never be a
[1:04:14] Catholic a Pentecostal will never be a
[1:04:16] Catholic but yet they all came from her
[1:04:20] they got her denominational ideas from
[1:04:23] her even though they're different
[1:04:25] different dogmas different teachings
[1:04:28] different ways they are still anything
[1:04:31] contrary to the word is adultery against
[1:04:35] the word amen amen so so um so he says
[1:04:41] now before I get uh too far along I want
[1:04:44] to mention that these early Bishops
[1:04:47] thought they were above the word they
[1:04:49] told the people they could forgive their
[1:04:50] sins upon confession of those sins that
[1:04:53] never was the truth they began to B
[1:04:55] baptized infants in the 2 Century they
[1:04:58] actually practice regeneration baptism
[1:05:00] no wonder people are mixed up today if
[1:05:03] if they were so mixed up then so close
[1:05:06] to Pentecost now they are in the most
[1:05:09] desperate condition being 2,000 years
[1:05:11] away from the original truth oh Church
[1:05:13] of God there's only one hope get back to
[1:05:16] the word and stay with it can I hear an
[1:05:20] amen now the doctrine of balum
[1:05:23] Revelations 2:4 thou Hast them there
[1:05:26] that hold the doctrine of balum who
[1:05:27] taught Bao to cast a stumbling block
[1:05:30] before the children of Israel to eat
[1:05:31] things sacrificed into idols and to
[1:05:33] commit fornication now you just can't
[1:05:36] have a nickan setup in the church and
[1:05:41] not have this other Doctrine come into
[1:05:45] you see if you take away the word of God
[1:05:48] and the moving of the spirit as a means
[1:05:51] of worship and they that worship me must
[1:05:53] worship me in spirit and truth then you
[1:05:56] have to give the people another form of
[1:06:01] worship as a
[1:06:03] substitute and uh and substitution
[1:06:07] spells baalism now that's powerful right
[1:06:10] there when you take
[1:06:12] away the word God is the word you do
[1:06:17] away with that then you have to have
[1:06:19] another form of
[1:06:20] worship if the word is not the
[1:06:24] preeminence that's why you've got to
[1:06:26] have all of the programs everything else
[1:06:29] because the power and the authority of
[1:06:32] the word is not upon that church now
[1:06:36] it's got to go through the through the
[1:06:37] youth programs and through all of these
[1:06:40] other programs as as Brother Band would
[1:06:41] say you know the the the old lady the
[1:06:44] old lady societies and you've got all of
[1:06:46] these other things to try to that's
[1:06:48] their form of worship what we worship is
[1:06:52] subjection and a love to Jesus Christ
[1:06:57] the word that's where our love is it's
[1:07:01] not it's it's not a system it's not a
[1:07:04] youth program it's not a a Sunday school
[1:07:07] but it's the word it's the word that we
[1:07:11] want can you say Amen that is what we
[1:07:14] worship so so that is powerful I'm going
[1:07:16] to read it to you again now you just
[1:07:18] can't have a nickel and setup in the
[1:07:21] church and not have this other Doctrine
[1:07:23] come in to you see if you take away the
[1:07:26] word of God and the moving of the spirit
[1:07:28] as the means of worship then you they
[1:07:31] that worship me was worship me in spirit
[1:07:33] and truth then you will have to give the
[1:07:35] people another form of worship as a
[1:07:37] substitute and the substitution spells
[1:07:40] bism if you're going to understand the
[1:07:43] doctrine of balum in it uh what it is in
[1:07:45] the New Testament Church we had better
[1:07:48] go back and see what it is in the Old
[1:07:49] Testament Church and apply it to that
[1:07:51] third age then bring it up to the
[1:07:54] present the story is found in numbers
[1:07:56] chapters
[1:07:58] 22-25 now we know that Israel was chosen
[1:08:01] the chosen people of God they were the
[1:08:03] Pentecostals of their day they had taken
[1:08:06] Refuge under the blood they had been
[1:08:08] baptized in the Red Sea they come up out
[1:08:11] of the water singing in the spirit and
[1:08:12] dancing under the energy of the Holy
[1:08:14] Ghost while miam the prophetess pler
[1:08:17] tambourine well after a certain time of
[1:08:19] Journey these children of Israel came to
[1:08:23] Moab you remember who Moab was he was
[1:08:25] the son of lot by one of the by one of
[1:08:28] his own daughters and lot in turn was a
[1:08:30] nephew of Abraham so Israel and Moab
[1:08:33] were related I want you to see that the
[1:08:36] moabites knew the truth whether they
[1:08:38] lived up to it or not so Israel came to
[1:08:42] the border of Moab and sent uh
[1:08:45] Messengers to the king saying we are
[1:08:48] brothers let us pass through your land
[1:08:50] if our people or our animals eat or
[1:08:52] drink anything we will gladly pay for it
[1:08:55] but the the king but King balac got very
[1:08:57] excited that head of the nickan bunch
[1:09:00] was not about to let the church come
[1:09:02] through with signs and wonders and
[1:09:05] diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:08] with their faces shining with the glory
[1:09:10] of God it was too risky and he might
[1:09:13] lose some of his crowd so baac refused
[1:09:15] to let Israel pass through in fact so
[1:09:18] great was his fear of them that he went
[1:09:21] to a hireling prophet called balum and
[1:09:24] asked him to mediate
[1:09:25] between him and God and and petition the
[1:09:29] almighty uh uh petition the almighty to
[1:09:31] curse Israel and render them impotent
[1:09:34] and balum being eager to take part in
[1:09:36] political Affairs become a great man and
[1:09:40] was only too glad to do so but seeing
[1:09:42] that he had to uh that he had to
[1:09:44] approach to and receive an audience from
[1:09:47] God to get the people cursed as he could
[1:09:49] not do it by himself he went to God at
[1:09:53] to ask God if he could have his per
[1:09:55] mission to go now isn't that just like
[1:09:57] the nicians we have with us today they
[1:10:00] curse everyone that won't go their way
[1:10:03] when bam asked God for permission to go
[1:10:05] God turned him down my that stunk but
[1:10:09] Balo
[1:10:10] insisted promising him even greater
[1:10:12] rewards and honor so balam went back to
[1:10:15] God now one answer from God should have
[1:10:18] been enough but not for self-will balum
[1:10:22] when God saw his perversity he told told
[1:10:25] him to get up and go he and quickly he
[1:10:28] saddled the donkey and away he went he
[1:10:31] should have realized that this was
[1:10:33] simply God's permissive will and he
[1:10:35] wouldn't be able to curse them if he
[1:10:37] went 20 times and tried 20 times now
[1:10:40] like balam are uh now like balum are
[1:10:43] people today they believe in three Gods
[1:10:46] get baptized in three titles instead of
[1:10:48] the name and yet God will send his
[1:10:50] Spirit upon them as he did upon balum
[1:10:54] they Will Go On Believing that they are
[1:10:55] exactly right and here they are exactly
[1:10:58] perfectly bamit see the doctrine of
[1:11:01] balam go go ahead anyway do it your way
[1:11:05] they say well God has blessed us it must
[1:11:08] be all right I know he has blessed you I
[1:11:11] don't deny that but it's the same
[1:11:15] organizational route that balum took
[1:11:17] it's Defiance to God's word it's false
[1:11:22] teaching can I hear an amen am so balum
[1:11:26] went wildly down the road until an angel
[1:11:28] of God stood in his way but that Prophet
[1:11:31] Bishop Cardinal chairman president
[1:11:34] General overseer was so blinded to the
[1:11:36] spiritual things by the thought of honor
[1:11:39] and glory and money that he could not
[1:11:41] see the angel standing with his drawn
[1:11:43] sword there he stood to to block the Mad
[1:11:46] Prophet the little donkey saw him and
[1:11:49] dodged back and forth until he finally
[1:11:51] crushed Bam's foot against a stone wall
[1:11:54] and the ass stopped and would not go one
[1:11:56] he could not so balum jumped off and
[1:11:58] began beating him the donkey began to
[1:12:00] talk to balum God let that donkey speak
[1:12:04] in a tongue that donkey was no hybrid he
[1:12:07] was the original seed he said to the
[1:12:09] blinded Prophet I am not or am I not
[1:12:12] your donkey haven't I carried you
[1:12:15] Faithfully bam replied yes yes you are
[1:12:18] my donkey and you have carried me
[1:12:20] Faithfully until now and if I can't get
[1:12:22] you going I'm going to kill you whoa
[1:12:25] what's this talking to a donkey that's
[1:12:29] funny I thought I heard the donkey
[1:12:31] talking I was and I was answering it
[1:12:34] back God has always spoken in a tongue
[1:12:38] he spoke it at belshazzar's Feast then
[1:12:40] at Pentecost he is doing it today it's a
[1:12:43] warning of sooncoming
[1:12:46] judgment then the angel was made visible
[1:12:48] to balum he told balum that except for
[1:12:51] that donkey he would be dead even now
[1:12:53] for tempting God and when balum promised
[1:12:56] to go back he sent him uh he sent on
[1:12:59] with admonition to say only what God
[1:13:01] gave so balum went down set up seven
[1:13:04] altars for the clean Beast of sacrifice
[1:13:08] he killed a ram signifying the coming of
[1:13:10] the Messiah he knew what to do to
[1:13:13] approach God uh to to approach into God
[1:13:18] he had the mechanics just right but not
[1:13:21] the Dynamics same as now can't you see
[1:13:24] nanism
[1:13:25] there was Israel down there in the
[1:13:28] valley offering the same sacrifice doing
[1:13:31] the same things the only one had the
[1:13:35] signs but only one had the signs
[1:13:37] following only one had God in their
[1:13:41] midst uh form won't get you anywhere it
[1:13:46] can't take the place of spirit
[1:13:50] manifestation this is what happened at
[1:13:52] NAA they put over balam's doct not the
[1:13:55] doctrine of God they stumbled yay they
[1:13:58] fail and they become dead men after the
[1:14:02] sacrifice was made baam was ready to
[1:14:03] prophesy but God tied his tongue up and
[1:14:07] could not and he could not curse them he
[1:14:08] blessed them paleo was very angry and
[1:14:11] there was nothing that balum could do
[1:14:13] about the prophecy it had been spoken by
[1:14:16] the Holy Ghost so balam BAC told balum
[1:14:19] to go down below into the valley and to
[1:14:21] look into the back parts to see if there
[1:14:23] wasn't possible Poss possibly some way
[1:14:26] he could curse them the tactics that
[1:14:28] Balo used are the same tactics that are
[1:14:31] used today the big denominations look
[1:14:34] down at the little groups and anything
[1:14:37] they find amongst them uh them to make a
[1:14:40] out a scandal they'll bring it out and
[1:14:42] shout it if the moderns live in sin uh
[1:14:46] no no one says anything about it but let
[1:14:48] one of the elect get in trouble and
[1:14:50] every paper blasted across the country
[1:14:53] every yes Israel had their their back
[1:14:56] carnal Parts they had their side uh that
[1:14:59] wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of
[1:15:02] their imperfections by the purpose of
[1:15:04] God that works through election by grace
[1:15:07] and not by works they had the cloud by
[1:15:09] day and the pillar of Fire by night they
[1:15:11] had the smitten Rock and the Brazen
[1:15:14] Serpent and the signs and wanders they
[1:15:15] were Vindicated not in themselves but in
[1:15:19] God God didn't have any respect for
[1:15:21] these nicians with their phds llds and
[1:15:24] DDS and all their fine organizations and
[1:15:27] the best that man could boast but he did
[1:15:29] have respect un Israel for they had the
[1:15:33] word Vindicated amongst them certain
[1:15:36] Israel couldn't look too polished oh
[1:15:38] certainly Israel couldn't look too
[1:15:40] polished up just having come out of
[1:15:42] Egypt in their precipitous flight uh but
[1:15:46] she was a blast people anyways and she
[1:15:49] had all she had ever known was three
[1:15:51] over 300 years of hurting flocks and
[1:15:53] tending fields and slaving away in the
[1:15:56] fear of death under the Egyptians but
[1:15:59] she was now free she was uh a blessed
[1:16:03] people through the sovereignty of God
[1:16:05] certainly Moab looked down on her all
[1:16:08] that n other nations did too
[1:16:10] organizations always look down on the
[1:16:12] unorganized and either will by
[1:16:15] determination bring them into an
[1:16:17] organization or destroy them when they
[1:16:20] won't come now someone might ask me
[1:16:23] brother brandham that makes
[1:16:25] what makes you think that Moab was
[1:16:27] organized while Israel was not where did
[1:16:30] you get that idea I get it right here
[1:16:33] out of the Bible it is all typed out
[1:16:35] here everything written in the new in
[1:16:38] the Old Testament that is in story form
[1:16:40] is written by for our admonition so that
[1:16:43] we can learn from it here it is right in
[1:16:46] numbers 23:9 from the top of the Rocks I
[1:16:50] see him from the hills I Behold Him Lo
[1:16:53] the people shall dwell alone and shall
[1:16:56] not be reckoned among the Nations There
[1:16:59] It Is God looking down from the top of
[1:17:01] the Rocks not in some Valley looking for
[1:17:04] their bad points and condemning them God
[1:17:07] seeing them the way he wanted to see
[1:17:09] them from the height of love and mercy
[1:17:14] oh doesn't that make you feel wonderful
[1:17:16] in all of your mistakes and all of your
[1:17:19] amen Frailty and yet God in his goodness
[1:17:22] chooses to see you for who you what the
[1:17:26] way he wants to see you through love and
[1:17:28] mercy he says they dwelt alone and they
[1:17:30] weren't organized they didn't have a
[1:17:32] king they had a prophet the prophet had
[1:17:36] God in him by the spirit and the word
[1:17:38] come to the prophet and the word went to
[1:17:40] the people they didn't belong to the UN
[1:17:43] they didn't Belong To The World Council
[1:17:44] of churches to the Baptist Presbyterian
[1:17:46] Assemblies of God or any other group
[1:17:48] they didn't need to belong they were
[1:17:50] joined to God they didn't need counsel
[1:17:53] from any counsel they had thus saith the
[1:17:56] Lord in their midst Hallelujah now in
[1:17:59] spite of the fact that that balum knew
[1:18:01] the proper approach to God and could
[1:18:03] bring forth a revelation from the Lord
[1:18:06] by the means of special Endo of power he
[1:18:08] was still for all of that a bishop in
[1:18:11] the false
[1:18:12] group for what did he uh for for what
[1:18:16] did he do now in order to win favor with
[1:18:19] Bay he formulated a plan wherein God
[1:18:24] would be forced to deal with Israel in
[1:18:28] death just as Satan knew that he could
[1:18:32] beile Eve cause and cause her to fall in
[1:18:35] fleshly sin thus causing God to pass his
[1:18:39] pronounced Judgment of death against sin
[1:18:41] so balum knew that if he could get
[1:18:44] Israel to sin God would have to deal
[1:18:47] with them in death so he planned a away
[1:18:49] to get get them uh to come over and join
[1:18:52] in sin now I think this is something
[1:18:54] that we we all need to really really
[1:18:56] watch as the children of God Amen it
[1:18:59] doesn't matter what these guys teach and
[1:19:03] we're fix and we're fixing the seed now
[1:19:05] remember what was the three things that
[1:19:07] we mentioned on Wednesday night on or
[1:19:09] Sunday night amen he invin evil then he
[1:19:13] anoints the leaders to to teach evil
[1:19:18] then he anoints the the the preacher to
[1:19:21] condone evil Satan invin it the world
[1:19:25] system puts it together and then and and
[1:19:28] and and and broadcasts it amen just like
[1:19:31] what we see today and then anoints the
[1:19:34] church to condone it I don't care what
[1:19:38] that church out there condones we are a
[1:19:40] separate people to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:45] it doesn't matter what laws they pass it
[1:19:47] doesn't matter what they say the
[1:19:50] anointing is with the bride and church
[1:19:53] we've got to keep keep our garments
[1:19:56] clean amen we've got to keep our
[1:19:58] garments clean I was talking to you
[1:19:59] young men the other day and all of you

[1:20:38] Earth and you can have a gift of God you

[1:20:42] name in that book but because you're
[1:20:45] playing with and following for the
[1:20:47] tricks of what the enemy is doing it'll
[1:20:50] it'll destroy
[1:20:52] you can I hear an amen from you Brothers
[1:20:55] amen so so we want we want to keep that
[1:20:58] don't get that started you young men if
[1:21:00] you have got it started amen you need to
[1:21:03] you need to get an elder and you need to
[1:21:04] get get that thing exposed don't keep
[1:21:06] that thing in the
[1:21:08] dark we don't keep sin in the dark open
[1:21:11] it up find you somebody that you that
[1:21:13] that you respect amen and not that not
[1:21:16] not going to go back there and and and
[1:21:17] sympathize with you and and and and look
[1:21:19] at the junk with you but somebody that
[1:21:21] can pray with you and help you to over
[1:21:24] come we will We Shall Overcome because
[1:21:28] God's given it his word we're not like
[1:21:30] Eve that is that is going to fall for
[1:21:33] this kind of stuff but yet we can get
[1:21:35] our garments we can get our garments
[1:21:37] full of spots we can get our garments
[1:21:39] with sin we're walking in this evil
[1:21:41] world but we are not to be a part of it
[1:21:44] and that's what the blood of Jesus is
[1:21:46] for y'all hear me amen that's what the
[1:21:49] blood of Christ is for all right so
[1:21:54] he says um let's see here amen
[1:21:59] um so he planned to get them to come
[1:22:01] over and join in sin he sent out
[1:22:03] invitations to come to the Feast of uh
[1:22:06] bpor come over and worship with us now
[1:22:10] Israel no doubt had seen the Feast of
[1:22:12] the Egyptians so they did not feel it
[1:22:14] was too wrong to go and just look on and
[1:22:17] perhaps eat with the people what is
[1:22:20] wrong with Fellowship anyway we're
[1:22:22] supposed to love them aren't we H how
[1:22:24] can can we win them being friendly never
[1:22:27] hurt anyone or else they thought but
[1:22:30] when they when those sexy moash bysh
[1:22:33] women begin to dance and undress while
[1:22:35] they Whirled around doing their little
[1:22:37] rock and roll and twist the lust rose up
[1:22:40] in the Israelites and they were drawn
[1:22:43] into adultery and God in Wrath uh slew
[1:22:48] 42,000 of them and that is what
[1:22:52] Constantine and his successors did at
[1:22:54] Nia and after NAA they invited the
[1:22:57] people to the convention and when the
[1:23:00] church sat down to eat and Rose up to
[1:23:02] play partaking of church form and
[1:23:05] ceremonies and Pagan Feast named after
[1:23:07] Christian rights she was trapped she had
[1:23:10] committed fornication and she walked out
[1:23:13] and God walked out and when any man
[1:23:16] turns from the word of God and joins a
[1:23:18] church instead of receiving the holy
[1:23:21] spirit that man dies dead that is what
[1:23:26] he is don't join a church don't get into
[1:23:30] organization and get uh taken up with
[1:23:32] Creeds and tradition and anything that
[1:23:35] takes the place of the word and the
[1:23:36] spirit or you're dead it's all over
[1:23:39] you're dead eternally separated from God
[1:23:42] and that's what happened in every age
[1:23:44] sense God delivers the people they come
[1:23:47] out by the blood Sanctified by the word
[1:23:50] walk through the waters of baptism get
[1:23:52] filled with the spirit but but while but
[1:23:55] after a while the first love cools off
[1:23:57] and somebody gets the idea that they
[1:24:00] ought to organize in order to preserve
[1:24:02] themselves and make a name for
[1:24:04] themselves and they organize themselves
[1:24:06] right back into the S Second
[1:24:08] Generation and sometimes even before
[1:24:10] then they no longer have the spirit of
[1:24:13] God just a form of worship they are
[1:24:17] dead they have hybridized themselves
[1:24:20] with Creed and form and there is no life
[1:24:23] in them so balam got Israel to commit
[1:24:26] fornication do you know that physical
[1:24:30] fornication is the very same spirit that
[1:24:34] lies in organized religion I said that
[1:24:38] the spirit of fornication is the spirit
[1:24:42] of organization all fornicators will
[1:24:45] have their place in the Lake of Fire
[1:24:48] that is what God thinks of organizations
[1:24:50] yes sir the and her daughters will
[1:24:52] be in the Lake of Fire denomination
[1:24:54] are not of God they never have been
[1:24:58] never will be it's a wrong spirit that
[1:25:00] separates the people of God into
[1:25:02] hierarchy and Ley and it's therefore a
[1:25:05] wrong spirit that separates the people
[1:25:07] from the people that's what organization
[1:25:10] and denominations do in organizing they
[1:25:13] separate themselves from the word of God
[1:25:16] and bring themselves into spiritual
[1:25:18] adultery now notice that Constantine
[1:25:21] gave special Feast unto the people uh
[1:25:23] they were were the old Pagan Feast with
[1:25:26] new names taken from the
[1:25:28] church or in some cases Christian rights
[1:25:31] were taken and abused with Pagan
[1:25:33] ceremonies he took the worship of the
[1:25:35] son God and changed it into the Son of
[1:25:36] God instead of celebrating December 21st
[1:25:40] which is when they used to celebrate the
[1:25:41] Feast of the Sun God then they uh they
[1:25:44] put up December 25th and called it God's
[1:25:47] birth day son of God's birthday but we
[1:25:50] know that he was born in April when life
[1:25:53] comes forth not December they took the
[1:25:55] feast to a starting and called it the
[1:25:59] Easter celebrations wherein the
[1:26:01] Christians is supposed to celebrate the
[1:26:02] death and the resurrection of the Lord
[1:26:04] actually it was a pagan Feast to a
[1:26:06] starting they placed altars in the
[1:26:08] church put up images uh put in images
[1:26:11] they gave the people what they called
[1:26:13] the Apostles Creed though you can't find
[1:26:15] it in the Bible they taught the people
[1:26:17] ancestor worship thereby making the
[1:26:19] Roman Catholic Church the greatest
[1:26:22] spiritualist uh uh spiritist Church
[1:26:24] Church in the world every foul bird was
[1:26:27] in that cage and you have the
[1:26:30] Protestants with their organizations
[1:26:32] doing the same thing can you hear say
[1:26:37] Amen now so so we're going to we're
[1:26:42] going to stop right there
[1:26:44] tonight and um I think that was a
[1:26:47] powerful reading so so here here it
[1:26:51] is now again I'm bringing this down to
[1:26:55] families the two Spirits work
[1:26:59] together okay when you we we we the the
[1:27:03] nianis is to conquer the
[1:27:06] Ley the spirit of baalism is to
[1:27:11] introduce things that's not according to
[1:27:14] scripture and the two work together you
[1:27:17] begin to teach so you find somebody
[1:27:20] that's got the wrong Spirit a
[1:27:22] controlling spirit then you watch his
[1:27:25] Doctrine his Doctrine will will will
[1:27:29] will be of that that is contrary to that
[1:27:31] of a servant but what we want amen here
[1:27:35] in py America we want our heart we want
[1:27:39] to be Servants of the Lord I am a
[1:27:42] servant to my wife my wife is a servant
[1:27:44] to me I am a servant to my
[1:27:47] children amen we are a servant to the
[1:27:51] community amen so there therefore it is
[1:27:54] not us up in the air demanding our
[1:27:56] rights it is it it's there there is
[1:27:59] something that there is a love that is
[1:28:01] projected that can only come through the
[1:28:03] Lord Jesus Christ now do we still have
[1:28:06] our do we still have our ups and downs
[1:28:07] we still have our personalities we still
[1:28:09] have those yes yes yes and that's what
[1:28:11] the blood of Jesus Christ is for the
[1:28:13] blood is to forgive us to wash us amen
[1:28:16] not for us to continue going down this
[1:28:19] we got a backtrack come back up Amen to

[1:28:23] tree amen man and and and but you can't

[1:28:28] called you to
[1:28:30] do justifying sin will never get you
[1:28:34] anywhere amen so so we begin Satan will
[1:28:38] take us off and then he'll start using
[1:28:40] scripture and start using things for us
[1:28:42] to justify our sin and you know God
[1:28:46] knows and the devil knows that sin is
[1:28:49] still sin it's still sin and we got to
[1:28:53] take care of sin we're the only people
[1:28:56] with the pillar of fire we're the only
[1:28:59] people with the blood of the Covenant

[1:35:45] Christianity is not
[1:35:49] religion it's
[1:35:52] relationship and and Satan wants to
[1:35:55] substitute relationship and if he can
[1:35:58] introduce sin then you and God are
[1:36:02] separated and so if and and when you
[1:36:05] introduce sin though you're still going
[1:36:07] to church and you're doing all of these
[1:36:08] things uh uh brother brandom says though
[1:36:12] you're saying you love him your worship

[1:36:17] keeping those things that he has placed
[1:36:20] in your heart in your
[1:36:22] life you're keeping the things that
[1:36:24] Christ came to set you free
[1:36:27] from and so
[1:36:29] relationship is is is So
[1:36:32] Glorious it's
[1:36:38] relationship you got those that that
[1:36:41] that that that that are they're going to

[1:36:50] church or they'll they'll keep track of
[1:36:52] of of uh
[1:36:54] you you'll find that kind of
[1:36:56] legalism and if they're legalistic to
[1:36:58] others they're also legalistic to
[1:37:00] themselves and and and and and and
[1:37:02] they'll live under that condemnation
[1:37:06] God yes the Ten Commandments are all
[1:37:11] in the New Testament
[1:37:14] Church it's it it it's all been listed
[1:37:17] at one place or another in the New

[1:43:21] has been perfect
[1:43:23] we can't say that we've always got it
[1:43:25] right but we can say that God has never
[1:43:29] forsaken us God has never let us down

[1:47:08] kid you're the you're you're the bad one
[1:47:10] out of the entire church whether you're

[1:47:38] there now missed you on Sunday amen
[1:47:41] praise the Lord
[1:47:43] Paul Amen brother Mitch
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:55] bism and all
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:47:58] that with what you said you're talking
[1:48:02] it's
[1:48:04] uh that's how he says that they would
[1:48:06] outshine the
[1:48:08] elect you know yeah that it's I get the
[1:48:13] nickel aism the controlling but then
[1:48:17] there's got to be
[1:48:18] programs uh
[1:48:21] excitements going on yeah that will
[1:48:23] outshine the
[1:48:25] elect in in deeds and everything else
[1:48:28] that says it in the church
[1:48:31] AG it kind of all comes together for me
[1:48:34] now
[1:48:35] it's so then that holds the
[1:48:38] people yeah so it's not so much not it's
[1:48:42] not the spirit of God anymore doing it
[1:48:44] you you it's taken you you you are still
[1:48:47] manipulating the people but you're doing
[1:48:49] it with the music you're doing it with
[1:48:51] the with with the program you're you're
[1:48:53] it's but it's still
[1:48:55] manipulation it's the it's instead of
[1:48:57] this Holy Spirit control it is the
[1:49:01] manipulation of of
[1:49:03] men to get people to come to the church
[1:49:06] come to this church instead of that
[1:49:07] church come to this church instead of
[1:49:10] right see and and that's that's not what
[1:49:13] God wants we want the anointing of the
[1:49:16] holy
[1:49:17] spirit amen to
[1:49:20] draw and and and and to bring in that's
[1:49:23] what
[1:49:24] separates God's Church from the other
[1:49:27] churches see you see what I'm saying
[1:49:29] because it's it's it they they that's
[1:49:31] the reason why amen the teaching has to
[1:49:33] be there or or you you you've got your
[1:49:36] you you've got you've got the doctrine
[1:49:37] of the nicians you usurping the control
[1:49:40] by uh um subtracting the word putting
[1:49:43] man's opinions in then you have to bring
[1:49:45] in your own form of worship and then
[1:49:47] with that form of worship then you're
[1:49:48] forgiving sins in your own manner you're
[1:49:50] doing things in your own way and then
[1:49:52] the word of God totally out there's no
[1:49:54] deliverances there's no power there's no
[1:49:56] anointing there's no nothing that's why
[1:49:58] transgenders are accepted reason why
[1:50:00] homosexuality is accepted that's the
[1:50:02] reason why that's why the church God is
[1:50:04] full of cigarette smokers marijuana
[1:50:06] smokers uh alcoholics and and and all of
[1:50:09] these things all in the church there's
[1:50:10] nothing there's there's no difference
[1:50:12] between any of us because the spirit of
[1:50:13] God is not there
[1:50:16] anymore it's become such
[1:50:19] manipulation of men but I'm so glad that
[1:50:22] I've belong to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:26] where the
[1:50:30] anointing what can
