[31:25] here and that's why I come come this
[31:30] morning with all the sincerity that I
[31:32] know to
[31:34] have to come early and pray and seek the

[43:37] amen and uh so uh we're just we're just
[43:43] looking forward to that day preparing
[43:45] for that day let's look here in Genesis
[43:48] 22 and 1 and it came to pass after these
[43:53] things that God did tempt Abraham or
[43:56] test him is the better word and said
[43:59] unto him
[44:00] Abraham and he said behold here I am he
[44:04] said take now thy son thine only son
[44:07] whom thou
[44:08] lovest and give and get thee into the
[44:11] land of Mariah and offer him there for a
[44:16] burnt offering upon one of the mountains
[44:19] which I tell thee
[44:20] of and Abraham rose up
[44:24] early in the morning
[44:27] saddled his ass and took two of his
[44:30] young men with him and Isaac his son and
[44:32] clav the wood for the burnt offering and
[44:34] Rose up and went to the place which God
[44:37] had told him of Now Catch the picture
[44:40] Abraham had waited for 25
[44:43] years the child is now 13 years old
[44:47] somewhere in there God comes and says
[44:50] this child that you have waited for 25
[44:53] years and I have given you 13 years with
[44:56] the child I want you to take this
[44:58] promise and I want you to go and kill
[45:01] him and the Bible says and
[45:04] Abraham woke up
[45:06] early saddled his mule and or his donkey
[45:12] and and and and went to the mountain
[45:14] that God told him and then on the third
[45:17] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[45:20] the place a far off and Abraham said
[45:24] unto the young men abide ye here with
[45:27] the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder
[45:31] and worship and come again to thee to
[45:34] you and Abraham took the wood of the
[45:37] burnt offering and laid it upon his son
[45:40] uh Isaac and he took the fire in his
[45:43] hand and a knife and they went both of
[45:47] them together and Isaac spake unto us
[45:50] unto Abraham as father and said my
[45:53] father he said here am I my son he said
[45:57] the behold the fire and the wood but
[46:00] where is the Lamb for a burnt
[46:02] offering and Abraham said my God shall
[46:07] provide
[46:09] himself a burnt offering so they went
[46:13] both of them together and they came to
[46:15] the place which God had told him of and
[46:17] Abraham built an altar there laid the
[46:20] wood in order and bound Isaac his
[46:23] son and laid him on the altar upon the
[46:28] wood and Abraham stretched forth his
[46:30] hand and took the knife to slay his son
[46:34] and the angel of the Lord called out and
[46:36] out of unto him out of heaven and said
[46:38] Abraham Abraham he said here am I he
[46:42] said lay not thine hand upon the lad
[46:44] neither do thou anything unto him for
[46:48] now I know thou fearest God seeing thou
[46:53] Hast not withheld thy son thine only son
[46:56] from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes
[46:59] and
[47:00] behold and looked and behold there uh
[47:04] behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by
[47:07] his thorns and Abraham took the RAM and
[47:10] offered him up for a burnt offering
[47:13] instead of Isaac his son and Abraham
[47:16] called the name of the place Jehovah
[47:18] Gyra as it is said to this day in the
[47:22] Mount of the Lord it shall be seen God
[47:26] bless you you can be seated here this
[47:30] morning want to
[47:33] minister a few moments on Jehovah
[47:36] jyra God my
[47:40] provider God loves to test his people he
[47:44] will he tests his people and
[47:48] and he knows what is in you amen but
[47:54] there's something about the expression
[47:57] expressed being expressed from the heart
[48:01] amen and God allows God loves to test
[48:05] his people the prophet said many a time
[48:08] that he
[48:11] expresses he will test you so that he
[48:14] can get an expression of Eternity from
[48:17] you Sister Sarah it sure is good to have
[48:20] you and your friend with us here God
[48:22] bless y'all enjoyed uh visiting with
[48:24] y'all a little bit last night and um but
[48:28] he wants to see an expression from you
[48:31] amen
[48:33] he's he he's um amen he'll he'll allow
[48:38] the devil as he done job sort of pull
[48:41] back from the man from the uh uh just
[48:45] lift his hand a little bit how many's
[48:47] ever experienced when God lifts his hand
[48:49] a little bit and and everything's going
[48:53] good and wonderful and then amen will
[48:57] hit or you know you'll amen your car
[49:01] will break down or amen the things will
[49:04] begin to happen and and if you're not
[49:07] careful amen you you'll get out of the
[49:11] flesh or you'll get out of the spirit
[49:13] and and and you'll start uh judging
[49:15] things by the flesh but Abraham even
[49:19] though uh it was it was now at least you
[49:23] know 33 34 years or or no 37 years 38
[49:29] years in in the process since God had
[49:32] given the promise God had now amen all
[49:35] of these many years later after Abraham
[49:39] had walked with God by faith after he
[49:41] had believed for 25 years after God had
[49:44] fulfilled the promise amen the scripture
[49:47] says that God was still testing Abraham
[49:50] amen even 30 something odd years later
[49:54] still testing ABR abam and Abraham his
[50:00] heart was right he was willing to obey
[50:04] God as even as an elder uh walk with God
[50:09] believing God and I want to say Amen
[50:12] that God is taking you to to uh to the
[50:16] fullness of this Rapture amen and and
[50:19] there are going to be testing times
[50:22] along the way and God is looking for an
[50:26] ET Eternal sound to come amen from you
[50:30] from deep within you can you say
[50:33] amen and so we we can see that we walk
[50:37] by by faith with God Amen we walk with
[50:42] God by faith and obedience and and and
[50:46] and he is responsible for fulfilling his
[50:51] word in you now we just say what God
[50:55] says because what God says says is never
[50:57] wrong amen we believe what God says
[51:00] because what God says he will always
[51:04] back up no matter what you're seeing in
[51:06] your present situation or your current
[51:08] situation or the the situation you may
[51:11] Face Tomorrow amen just believe it the
[51:14] way God said it and God will bring it to
[51:18] pass for you amen I I I I I like that
[51:22] you see amen the elect has been given a
[51:25] key and it the key of divine revelation
[51:29] Abraham was given Revelation and that
[51:33] Revelation when God appeared unto
[51:35] Abraham there was nothing that could
[51:38] ever turn him away from the promise that
[51:42] God had given him more able to to pull
[51:44] him aside now he had many of his uh of
[51:48] his wanderings or his ups and his Downs
[51:50] his ins and out but the scripture says
[51:53] that he staggered not at the promise of
[51:55] God but he judged God Faithful who gave
[51:59] the promise now I want you to look at
[52:01] that this morning because I I I want you
[52:03] to know that this great mysterious God
[52:07] Amen the one that that is that fills all
[52:11] space and all time amen he he was then
[52:14] seen through the pillar of fire and and
[52:17] the the natural Sun that we see today
[52:19] that was not the First Sunlight the
[52:21] First Sunlight amen was the logos the
[52:24] pillar of fire when God spoke amen and
[52:27] then out of God the invisible God come a
[52:31] tangible Pillar of Fire that was that
[52:34] was the first expression of God Amen but
[52:37] you see God's desire was not to just
[52:40] remain invisible and not to just be seen
[52:43] in the pillar of fire but his desire was
[52:46] to be made manifest in humans in a human
[52:51] being and that's why Jesus came Jesus
[52:54] came as a redeemer to redeem you so that
[52:58] he can be expressed through you amen and
[53:02] so Revelation was coming to Abraham amen
[53:06] and this Revelation if you were to if
[53:09] you were to look through Abraham's life
[53:11] amen the Revelation it was Progressive
[53:14] and it grew and it grew and it grew
[53:16] until amen this this great Jehovah Gyra
[53:20] and I I want to say here today Amen in
[53:23] our in in in our finite conditions that
[53:26] we live in then in you is a revelation
[53:31] and remember you aren't responsible for
[53:35] the Revelation you didn't give the
[53:37] Revelation and you cannot fulfill the
[53:39] promise of God in your life there's
[53:42] nothing there's nothing about you that
[53:44] can fulfill amen Divine Healing there's
[53:46] nothing about you that can fulfill a
[53:49] Rapture there's nothing about you that
[53:51] can overcome sin there is nothing about
[53:54] you that can defeat the Devil am amen
[53:56] but you see it's the revelation of
[54:00] Christ in you the hope of glory that's
[54:04] the Revelation that brings you through
[54:06] well blessed be the name of the Lord
[54:09] amen I I I'm so thankful for that here
[54:11] today he is the Revelation now if I'm a
[54:15] little bit too loud you can you can turn
[54:17] that down a little bit but don't turn me
[54:19] off Allelujah amen so he is responsible
[54:23] for fulfilling his word amen so today I
[54:28] just want us to to to just say What God
[54:31] Says amen when we testify to one another
[54:34] it should be amen of what God says and
[54:38] so I want to say here that the elect has
[54:41] been given a key we walk with God in a
[54:46] world alone we walk with God Amen not
[54:51] everyone's going to see my Revelation
[54:53] not everyone's going to understand my
[54:55] revelation
[54:57] but I have a revelation from God Amen
[55:01] well praise the Lord amen I I I I like
[55:04] what brother brandham said here he says
[55:06] I I'm just an oldfashioned Backwoods
[55:08] preacher that believes in the old time
[55:10] heartfelt sky blue kin sin kill and
[55:13] religion that's right that believes the
[55:17] oldfashioned way I believe that man when
[55:19] he's born of God he becomes a Son of God
[55:23] the supernatural power of God dwells in
[55:25] him I we have a supernatural God we have
[55:29] a supernatural life I believe that any
[55:32] man that's born of the Spirit uh the
[55:35] supernatural Spirit believes in the
[55:37] Supernatural we got a supernatural
[55:39] Resurrection we got a supernatural
[55:41] Heaven we'll have a supernatural Rapture
[55:44] I believe the whole thing is built up
[55:48] around the Supernatural and if a man is
[55:51] born of the spirit of God he believes in
[55:55] the Supernatural can I hear an amen he
[55:58] can't help it because he's a Son of God
[56:01] it's a revelation to him amen oh blessed
[56:04] be the name of the Lord he said Christ
[56:07] couldn't help being what he was he was
[56:09] the son of God that's it see what I mean
[56:12] now see if you were intended amen you
[56:15] see the word of God you believe you
[56:18] believe it amen because why there's
[56:21] there's something new see why you have
[56:24] have you ever heard of a strain in a f
[56:26] family a son will have will kind of uh
[56:29] impersonate his father or the mother or
[56:31] the grandfather the grandmother it's the
[56:34] strain in the family amen you've heard
[56:36] of it haven't you well that's the same
[56:38] thing from predestination you were
[56:41] supposed to be here in the right way at
[56:43] the beginning but being You Came the way
[56:46] you did you're subject to the fall amen
[56:49] you're subject to your flesh you're
[56:51] subject to Decay you're subject to
[56:53] sickness you're subject well praise the
[56:56] Lord heart you're subject to family
[56:58] issues amen but that doesn't that
[57:00] doesn't change the fact he says you're
[57:03] subject to the fall but because you're
[57:07] predestinated you hear the word of God
[57:10] and it brings you right back to where
[57:13] you were predestinated amen brings you
[57:16] it says what makes you believe the word
[57:18] and turn down these other things is
[57:21] because there is something in you way
[57:24] back Yonder you're supposed amen what
[57:27] you are made to live here forever I just
[57:30] want to shout hallelujah amen he says
[57:33] the Revelation is never wrong speak it
[57:37] anyhow no matter what it sounds like or
[57:41] what goes It goes right with that word
[57:45] amen you say it anyhow you believe it
[57:48] anyhow oh that's a positive confession
[57:51] amen the confession is not that I'm sick
[57:54] not that I'm defeated the confession is
[57:58] that I have been redeemed so that the
[58:01] supernatural God can have his way in me
[58:05] I am redeemed so that God can be
[58:09] expressed well praise the Lord amen oh
[58:13] we got we we go around too many times
[58:15] frowning amen every time yeah somebody
[58:18] it's a amen how they're doing some
[58:20] people it's just always well you know
[58:23] well you know oh man h
[58:27] I well I'm Mr defeat I'm sister defeat
[58:31] amen oh man oh you just don't know amen
[58:34] oh we do know ever since we've known you
[58:37] you've been defeated but I want to say
[58:40] today we're not here to glorify defeat
[58:43] we're here to glorify God Amen it is the
[58:47] god of Heaven that has become the god in
[58:51] your body that wants to express himself
[58:55] like he did to
[58:57] Abraham
[58:59] amen it was a willing heart of Abraham
[59:02] and he never got away from it that it is
[59:04] God that gave the promise and it is God
[59:08] that will fulfill the promise oh can you
[59:11] say amen amen the prophet of God would
[59:13] say the word the evening message must
[59:18] carry evening results the evening
[59:21] message must so evening seed not morning
[59:24] seed evening seed is is that right the
[59:27] midday scene is it seeds back there amen
[59:31] it was denomination it died and it
[59:33] perish but the evening time message will
[59:37] show evening time light and will bring
[59:40] show evening time results the evening
[59:43] time message he said Jesus time was the
[59:47] midday message it showed the midday
[59:49] results amen the beginning the message
[59:52] showed the beginning results amen he
[59:55] made his son in his own image in the
[59:58] midday in the evening time he makes a
[1:00:02] bride for him amen you see it by what
[1:00:05] his word how did he form the Earth how
[1:00:08] did he speak it into existence by his
[1:00:11] word who was his son the word in the
[1:00:15] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:00:17] with God and the Word was made flesh how
[1:00:19] will he take the bride by the word not a
[1:00:24] new cart not theologian idea but
[1:00:27] according to his word he will identify
[1:00:31] her well can you say Amen why did
[1:00:34] Abraham get up early that morning it he
[1:00:37] could identify with the word that he had
[1:00:40] been walking with for 30 some odd years
[1:00:44] he could
[1:00:45] identify amen it was the same one that
[1:00:48] revealed himself there in the land of
[1:00:50] her it was the same word that had spoke
[1:00:54] to him Amen in m
[1:00:56] it was the same word that appeared to
[1:00:59] him before the body changed and I want
[1:01:02] to say today amen when you become
[1:01:05] accustomed to walking with the spirit of
[1:01:08] the word amen you're not listening amen
[1:01:11] for anything else but what God says
[1:01:15] because God has has quickened You by
[1:01:18] divine revelation and he is showing
[1:01:21] himself strong and real in your behalf
[1:01:24] can you say Amen
[1:01:26] amen man now the prophet of God says you
[1:01:31] have something that you can go back to
[1:01:34] because the God who called you at the
[1:01:36] beginning is the god that you're walking
[1:01:38] with today Hallelujah the God my
[1:01:41] provider he is my provider every every

[1:20:30] said that I'm the guy with all of the
[1:20:31] mistakes amen and all of the wrongs that
[1:20:34] I'm having to deal with but you know
[1:20:35] what I've got a seat on the end there is
[1:20:37] a family resemblance and it's not that
[1:20:39] of Durant Martin it's not that of Wesley
[1:20:41] Martin amen it's that of God I was a Son
[1:20:45] of God a long time before I was a son of
[1:20:47] durren

[1:20:52] before mama ever thought about me and I
[1:20:54] want to tell you I'm going back I'm
[1:20:57] pressing forward I'm believing the
[1:20:59] promise and God's going to take this
[1:21:01] measly Wretch like this body that I live
[1:21:04] in and make me who he wants me to
[1:21:10] be the Seed of Abraham will always have
[1:21:13] to rely on the efficiency of God or you
[1:21:15] will be a
[1:21:18] failure well praise the
[1:21:21] Lord but God gives us the evidence
[1:21:24] oh God is so
[1:21:26] good you know the evidence of that land
[1:21:30] that we're going God gives us that
[1:21:34] evidence in this new land of the word
[1:21:37] that we have been brought back to the
[1:21:39] word is where we came from the word is
[1:21:43] ours but we have found that there is an
[1:21:47] enemy squatting on our
[1:21:49] land that there's Giants on that
[1:21:52] word that's our inheritance
[1:21:56] I'm not talking about a dead letter I'm
[1:21:58] talking about the Loos living in you
[1:22:00] making the word to live there is a devil
[1:22:04] setting upon that word there's a de come
[1:22:08] on church but what did God do when God
[1:22:11] took the people the children of Israel
[1:22:13] when he took them over to the promised
[1:22:14] land he did not just send them over amen
[1:22:18] as a whole and them be defeated amen
[1:22:20] when they saw the so you know what he

[1:22:24] spies over that direction and they're
[1:22:26] going to bring back the promises to you
[1:22:30] and show you the milk the honey the
[1:22:33] grapes the pomegranates everything that
[1:22:36] I've said because there's going to be
[1:22:38] Devils there that is going to try to
[1:22:40] twist your mind if you look at the

[1:36:03] son for God has seen your
[1:36:07] heart and God Is providing a
[1:36:17] lamb the greatest confession Abraham
[1:36:19] could have ever made by getting up the
[1:36:20] next morning by having what we would all
[1:36:24] term a
[1:36:25] nightmare what we would all term that
[1:36:27] couldn't be of
[1:36:29] God he was walking with
[1:36:31] God he knew
[1:36:34] him he identified with him he obeyed
[1:36:41] him and God didn't abandon
[1:36:45] him the
[1:36:47] greatest the the greatest of the
[1:36:51] abrahamic Covenant was when when he was
[1:36:55] willing go go go go go go read that you
[1:36:58] know uh Clea put that up there on that
[1:37:00] next verse we didn't finish that next
[1:37:02] verse that the the 14th verse Abraham
[1:37:04] called that there in in Genesis 22 and
[1:37:07] 14 and Abraham called the name of the
[1:37:09] place Jehovah Gyra as it is said today
[1:37:11] in the mou of the Lord shall be seen and
[1:37:13] the angel of the Lord called from Heaven
[1:37:16] to Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[1:37:17] and said by myself have I sworn sayith
[1:37:20] the Lord that because thou Hast done
[1:37:24] this thing and has not withheld thy son
[1:37:26] thine only son that in blessing I Will
[1:37:29] Bless thee in multiplying I will
[1:37:31] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:37:32] heaven the Sands which is in the sea and
[1:37:34] the seed thy seed shall possess the
[1:37:37] gates of his enemies and in thy seed
[1:37:41] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:37:42] blessed because thou Hast obeyed my
[1:37:48] voice he is
[1:37:52] amen you're walk talking with
[1:37:54] me even
[1:37:57] though it's not pleasing even though
[1:38:01] it's one thing to have the promise I'm
[1:38:04] going to give you a child and God giv
[1:38:07] little signs I'm going but then when the
[1:38:10] whole thing turns around and says now

[1:38:13] been promising you and him waking up the
[1:38:16] next morning I I just that that that
[1:38:18] that that just touches my heart I'm
[1:38:20] willing to give it up because my
[1:38:23] Revelation was never about Isaac my
[1:38:26] Revelation was that God that I met in
[1:38:29] the land of Earth the Revelation is that
[1:38:31] mesc the Revelation is that one who come
[1:38:35] and I fed that's the one who gave the

[1:44:19] years and what you are to be right now
[1:44:22] when he saw the completion of the whole
[1:44:26] thing he began to shout the Bible says
[1:44:30] those in heaven heard him shout everyone
[1:44:31] on Earth heard him shout everyone under
[1:44:34] the Earth heard him shout you know why
[1:44:38] because God had provided a
[1:44:40] lamb God had provided a lamb the lamb
[1:44:43] had come to open the book to him the

[1:50:25] says the Bible says that God brought in
[1:50:27] such a confusion that the enemy started
[1:50:29] killing
[1:50:33] themselves all the commotion going on
[1:50:35] like crazy and these these four leopard
[1:50:37] dudes are walking in and thinking
[1:50:40] whoa Hallelujah one picks up a big old
[1:50:43] lamb leg and starts eating on it and the
[1:50:45] other one say well it's not good for us
[1:50:47] to be eating over here all by ourselves

[1:50:53] be hungry too they start beating on the
[1:50:55] gates and saying open it up man we we
[1:50:57] got food out the Bible says that the
[1:50:59] gates opened up and they went out and
[1:51:02] the guy that was Mr doubt Mr skeptical
[1:51:05] the guy amen that was just Mr defea in
[1:51:08] his mind the one that says I know it can
[1:51:11] happen but God God will have to open up
[1:51:13] Windows in heaven to do it I'm just
[1:51:15] that's all I got to say the Bible says
[1:51:17] he was trampled underfoot while the
[1:51:21] people were going to find their food
[1:51:22] well I just want to tell you God don't
[1:51:24] let me be an
[1:51:31] unbeliever not when I've been called to
[1:51:34] possess you're going to call me crazy
[1:51:36] call me crazy anyway I believe the word
[1:51:40] of
[1:51:43] God can you say Amen second
[1:51:47] Timothy 1 and 11 it says for which cause
[1:51:50] I suffer also suffer these things
[1:51:52] nevertheless I'm not ashamed for I know
[1:51:55] whom I have believed and am persuaded
[1:51:58] that he is able to keep that which I
[1:51:59] have committed and unto him unto that
[1:52:02] day brother brandom says I'd like to
[1:52:05] drive this
[1:52:06] home when you catch that faith when
[1:52:10] you're going to be healed every
[1:52:11] circumstance everything else all signs
[1:52:13] all symptoms can point you or dying
[1:52:15] you'll never move it's a resting place
[1:52:19] in it it's resting places in the
[1:52:21] sanctuary of God's word When Faith
[1:52:23] genuine Faith sets itself there not make
[1:52:26] belief now in faith not hope but faith
[1:52:28] hope hope is out here hoping it'll it'll
[1:52:31] it'll hoping it was it in but faith is
[1:52:35] already in looking out and saying it's
[1:52:37] done that's faith and there's where
[1:52:40] faith is taking its resting place for it
[1:52:42] knows that God will never never let the
[1:52:45] enemy R over the top of him someone
[1:52:48] shout yes he never has Faith knows that
[1:52:52] so regardless of what the thing looked
[1:52:55] Noah knowed the ark would float
[1:52:57] certainly did Daniel know that God could
[1:53:00] close the mouth lion's mouth Hebrew
[1:53:03] children knew that God could stop the
[1:53:06] fire Jesus knew God would raise him
[1:53:09] again because the word said I'll not
[1:53:11] leave his soul in Hell neither suffer my
[1:53:15] Holy One to see corruption he know
[1:53:17] corruption said in 72 hours within 3
[1:53:19] days I'll raise it up it took its
[1:53:21] eternal resting place in the sanctuary
[1:53:24] of God's word and there it's to it
[1:53:27] reason will try its best to recognize
[1:53:29] well this system is is bound to be
[1:53:31] better this is that amen it looks better
[1:53:34] because uh you you're looking in within
[1:53:36] that intellectual mind amen you can
[1:53:38] prove reasonings but you cannot prove
[1:53:41] Faith someone shout yes amen cuse it you
[1:53:44] can it if you can prove it it is no
[1:53:47] longer Faith but Faith knows only the
[1:53:50] word and the promise and it looks to the
[1:53:52] thing that you do not see faith is the
[1:53:55] substance of things hoped for the
[1:53:57] evidence of things not seen you can't
[1:53:59] reason it I can't prove how it'll be
[1:54:01] done I don't know how it's going to be
[1:54:03] done I don't know it but I believe it I
[1:54:06] know that it's so because God said so
[1:54:09] and that
[1:54:13] settled it's the reason I know that this
[1:54:15] is right I know the word is right I know
[1:54:17] this message is right for it's in the
[1:54:19] word I see the Living God moving among
[1:54:22] it to prove we're at The Exodus
[1:54:25] certainly true even death itself can't
[1:54:28] shake Faith man stand right in the in
[1:54:30] death right in the face of death and
[1:54:32] Shout the victory of the Resurrection
[1:54:34] Paul oh death where is thy stink grave
[1:54:38] where is your Victory because Christ
[1:54:40] raised up and those that are in Christ
[1:54:42] will come forth with him at his coming
[1:54:44] it can't change it Faith makes the word
[1:54:47] of God its sanctuary of its Eternal rest
[1:54:50] it lays in the word of God
[1:54:53] God can you see
[1:55:00] man Hallelujah just keep what what what
[1:55:03] are you looking at this morning can you
[1:55:05] see yourself in that word can you see
[1:55:06] yourself right now in that word y'all
[1:55:10] remember y y'all remember brother
[1:55:12] brandom having the vision of the of the
[1:55:15] caribou and and the grizzly and that he

[2:05:12] really this
[2:05:18] here this here is meant to exhibit his
