[45:05] chapter um amen we

[45:14] season we have so much to be thankful
[45:16] for and um
[45:19] amen um this this time that has been set
[45:23] aside uh to you know to go back and and

[45:41] and um I'm I'm thankful for that today
[45:44] thankful to know that amen uh that that
[45:49] he couldn't uh stay in heaven without us
[45:52] amen that that he had to come to redeem
[45:56] me and you
[45:57] and so we're thankful to him for that
[46:00] we're going to look in Ephesians 1 and 1
[46:04] and uh we're going to go to the fourth
[46:06] verse it says Paul an apostle of Jesus
[46:09] Christ by the will of God to the Saints
[46:13] which are at
[46:15] Ephesus and I'm I'm want to really deal
[46:17] with the Saints here this
[46:20] morning um to the faithful in Christ
[46:23] Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God
[46:26] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[46:29] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[46:33] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[46:36] us with all spiritual blessings in
[46:39] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[46:43] he ha chosen Us in him before the
[46:46] foundation of the world that we should
[46:48] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[46:54] love amen now if you would look at the
[46:58] original it it actually the in love
[47:01] belongs with the fifth verse so it
[47:04] actually should say that we should be
[47:07] holy and Without Blame before him period
[47:11] in love having predestinated us unto the
[47:15] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[47:17] himself according to the good pleasure
[47:20] of his will let's go to the Lord in in
[47:23] prayer father we want to thank
[47:25] you for all all of your goodness for all
[47:29] of your grace thank you Lord for being
[47:33] so good to us and good to our families

[47:51] ask Lord that you would speak to us and
[47:55] Lord let the words of life have come
[47:57] from your gracious lips and Lord let it
[48:00] settle in our spiritual ears down into
[48:03] our hearts father we thank you for it
[48:07] thank you for all that you mean to us
[48:10] now Lord I'm asking that you would help
[48:11] us today help me to get out of the way
[48:14] Lord and Lord and just allow you to use
[48:17] this my my voice and my body father and
[48:21] we'll give you glory and honor in the
[48:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the
[48:26] church say
[48:27] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[48:30] seated here this
[48:33] morning amen we want
[48:36] to
[48:38] um think along these lines as as I'm
[48:42] just going
[48:43] to uh think about this to the Saints
[48:47] amen which are at Ephesus to the
[48:51] faithful which are in Christ
[48:53] Jesus and the positive word that that
[48:57] God has has placed over the
[49:01] bride we' I've used that word quite a
[49:04] bit lately they were from some quotes
[49:07] that brother brandham had uh that
[49:09] brother brandham had talked about that
[49:11] we're living in the days of positive
[49:14] word amen where it's no longer a shadow
[49:17] of the hand amen but we have gotten so
[49:21] close to the light that we are clearly
[49:24] seeing the object of that amen that the
[49:27] light has been shining upon the Old
[49:30] Testament had the had the types and the
[49:34] Shadows but Jesus was the anti-type or
[49:37] he was the positive word amen so
[49:41] everything of the Old Testament they
[49:43] seen the Shadows of the positive amen
[49:46] they could they could see that God was
[49:48] looking for a redeemer that God was
[49:50] redeeming God they could see the heart
[49:53] of God Amen but when Jesus game he was
[49:57] the very object amen that that um uh
[50:02] they were looking for so it is today
[50:05] there has been a amen there has been a
[50:09] promise looking to a a perfect Church
[50:13] looking to a Rapture looking to the sons
[50:17] of God coming into their position but
[50:19] we're living in a day not of just in the
[50:22] shadows of yesterday but we're living in
[50:25] a positive because we are here Amen in
[50:30] the Fulfillment so it's no longer a
[50:33] shadow of things to come amen a shadow
[50:37] of a church that is going to be raptured
[50:39] but we are living in the days of the
[50:42] Fulfillment amen so this day of rapture
[50:46] requires a perfect Faith now the reason
[50:50] that God sent us a prophet to bring
[50:52] things more positive to you is because
[50:55] there's got to be a positive faith in
[50:57] the positive word each generation had to
[51:01] believe their age they had to believe
[51:03] the message for their age and so God in
[51:06] this age as it has come and become more
[51:09] clearly it's coming from you know
[51:11] justification
[51:12] sanctification uh there was the isusa
[51:15] street baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[51:17] there was that there was the promise
[51:19] coming closer and closer and closer and
[51:22] when God wanted to bring it to this day
[51:24] God says I'm going to send a prophet to
[51:26] where there is absolutely no doubt no
[51:30] Shadows anywhere of who you are and and
[51:34] and and what I've got for the day I
[51:35] don't want no guessing amen because this
[51:38] is going to require a perfect faith my
[51:40] wife's been listening to the perfect
[51:42] amen perfect faith lately amen and I I
[51:45] I'll hear it and I I told her the other
[51:47] day as well add Messiah to that too and
[51:50] amen because perfect faith and the
[51:52] Messiah is a are are are incredible uh
[51:56] passages where where brother bradam is
[51:59] is is is declaring amen that there is a
[52:03] people again on the earth with that
[52:06] Faith they've got a perfect word which
[52:09] is giving perfect faith and therefore
[52:11] God's got Messiah is right here little
[52:14] Messiah is under the great Messiah
[52:16] little Messiah is UN anointed under the
[52:19] great word for the day amen to fulfill
[52:22] God's words how many believe that God
[52:24] has got all power right here in in in Le
[52:28] odys the anointing of the holy spirit is
[52:31] right there with you you do not you do
[52:34] not have anything second class you have
[52:37] the very dynamics of God now whether you
[52:41] want to believe that and accept that and
[52:43] appropriate that that is up to you but
[52:46] I'm here to tell you what God has sent
[52:48] to Earth is the greatest thing of all
[52:51] time Amen to take you into a Rapture now
[52:55] now I I I want to to really look at that
[52:57] because you you know uh the Jesus told
[53:00] his disciples there in Matthew 5:37 he
[53:03] says let your yay be yay and your Nay be
[53:07] nay amen don't let your yes don't let it
[53:11] be yes and no amen that's
[53:14] double-mindedness that's amen you just
[53:16] you just don't know amen but 2 Peter 3
[53:19] and9 says the Lord is not slack
[53:22] concerning his promises somebody say the
[53:25] Lord is not
[53:27] like concerning his promise he does not
[53:32] say yes no maybe yes no amen the
[53:36] scripture says there in fact in 2
[53:39] Corinthians 1:18 it says But as God is
[53:42] true our word toward you was not yay and
[53:46] nay for the Son of God Jesus Christ who
[53:50] was preached unto you by us even by me
[53:53] and sylvanus and timotheus that uh was
[53:56] not yay and nay but in him was yay for
[54:04] all somebody say all oh aren't you glad
[54:07] for that well I wish God could do this
[54:09] but I amen I I just don't know if God
[54:11] can perform Miracles all the promises of
[54:16] God in him are say it with me are yay
[54:20] and in him
[54:23] amen now amen so when God gives a
[54:28] promise then we need to step up to the
[54:31] plate and say I believe that I accept
[54:34] that I want that promise to become
[54:37] positive in my life hallelujah how
[54:40] many's ready to step up to the plate and
[54:42] say God Amen I want you to give me what
[54:45] everything that you have given us now
[54:47] amen it's important because we've got in
[54:51] in uh in Congress you know uh we've got
[54:54] the the the
[54:56] amen uh what what do they call that the
[55:00] uh the uh propitiation or the
[55:03] Appropriations Committee amen that that
[55:06] has been uh uh you know the president
[55:10] and the Congress they come up with a
[55:11] funding and amen and they they select
[55:14] what this funding is all go to and then
[55:17] there's the Appropriations amen that
[55:20] that oversees that and so the money is
[55:24] there but it requires someone to come up
[55:27] and say listen it's already been voted
[55:29] on it's already been accepted it's
[55:31] already been approved I need the money
[55:33] to fund this certain program or I need
[55:35] the money uh uh for the uh you know for
[55:39] uh for the military for this for that
[55:41] amen and it's already there but I want
[55:43] to say here today that God in his own
[55:46] will God had no other counsel God in his
[55:49] own will has already
[55:52] appropriated everything that you need in
[55:56] this Earth's Journey all the way from
[55:59] amen the time of your birth all the way
[56:01] to the time of the Rapture and your body
[56:03] change there is nothing in between that
[56:07] God has not already appropriated for you
[56:11] in this journey aren't you glad for that
[56:13] whether you need healing this morning
[56:14] you can stand up to the plate and say
[56:16] God Amen I'm just asking for my healing
[56:19] it's already mine it's already paid for
[56:23] it's already taken care of I am here
[56:26] believing what you have to say your
[56:29] promises are yes and forever settled
[56:33] amen hallelujah amen forever settled the
[56:38] scripture says Thy word is forever
[56:41] settled in the heavens amen Jesus says
[56:45] let thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[56:48] Earth as it already is in heaven he's
[56:51] already appropriated it now let my heart
[56:55] come in line with that that word and say
[56:57] so be it unto me if you're needing
[57:00] healing this morning so be it unto me if
[57:03] you're needing the baptism of the Holy
[57:05] Ghost so be it unto
[57:07] me
[57:09] Amen to the Saints which are at Ephesus
[57:13] amen now there's there's a lot of um
[57:17] learned theologians that amen uh or most
[57:21] of them say that the two to the Saints
[57:24] of or to Ephesus not in the original
[57:27] text amen that it was actually written
[57:30] to Le osia and and um uh so there's
[57:34] there's been I but I I thought even if
[57:36] if if they are true it is quite an
[57:38] appropriate it is quite an appropriate
[57:41] uh uh uh thing because Le oosa is having
[57:45] an Ephesus can you say amen amen but
[57:48] when we think about the Saints when Paul
[57:51] started this epistle Amen to Ephesus he
[57:55] pinned to the Saints which are at
[57:58] Ephesus amen Saints God's chosen God's
[58:02] elect amen the word Saints comes from
[58:05] the Greek word hagios amen and and it it
[58:09] literally means sacred it it means
[58:13] physically pure morally
[58:16] blameless ceremonially consecrated amen
[58:20] so when God is looking and and when the
[58:23] Apostle Paul is wanting to place the
[58:26] Saints now this was not just a the the
[58:29] an average letter this was not you know
[58:32] to to the the Corinthians that that he
[58:35] was constantly having to correct and and
[58:37] and get on to him but this was the
[58:39] positioning this this is the positioning
[58:43] uh a a letter of the New Testament
[58:46] positioning the church where they belong
[58:49] and when he starts out he he is saying
[58:51] that this is not to amen uh h a church
[58:55] member this is not to uh The Sinner this
[58:59] is not to a wannab be this is to God's
[59:03] very elect that he has purchased with
[59:07] his own blood can you say amen amen so
[59:11] so that word Saint would be the the the
[59:14] great uh uh doctrinal word of the
[59:17] epistle and I and I want us to look at
[59:19] it for just a few moments because I find
[59:22] this uh uh very peculiar when the Paul
[59:25] was was was looking for the term to to
[59:30] uh uh Express what the believer is in
[59:33] the sight of God Amen and Holiness and
[59:36] Purity and amen there there were no
[59:39] other words in the Greek language that
[59:42] the Apostle could take and he he took
[59:45] that word hagos which was right out amen
[59:49] of of Amen it's a term right out of the
[59:52] Pagan Greek religions there there was no
[59:55] other word for Holiness there was
[59:58] nothing else that could be used there
[1:00:00] amen there were well there were four
[1:00:01] other words of uh uh that that related
[1:00:04] to Holiness but nothing as Purity to the
[1:00:09] it always was the the the Holiness of a
[1:00:12] god it the Holiness of a deity the
[1:00:15] Holiness of a but the Apostle Paul would
[1:00:18] would would take it beyond that and and
[1:00:22] to let you know that the god you're
[1:00:25] serving is not just the holy God Amen
[1:00:29] the the righteous God which he is he's
[1:00:32] not just the amen the the the the pure
[1:00:36] God but the one that God has Redeemed by
[1:00:41] his blood amen has taken in the Purity
[1:00:46] or the righteousness the the amen the
[1:00:50] glory of that God that they are
[1:00:53] worshiping now now no other no other
[1:00:56] place could give that to you again amen
[1:00:59] the pagans would use it to amen it it
[1:01:02] was to uh uh devote something to a God
[1:01:06] Amen it always had an object in mind in
[1:01:09] other words the temple is Holy therefore
[1:01:12] separated uh uh for the gods or the gift
[1:01:16] that you brought to the temple is Holy
[1:01:19] and separated to the God Amen or the
[1:01:22] sacrifice is considered holy and
[1:01:25] separated to their deity but when the
[1:01:27] Apostle Paul took it he says the Saints
[1:01:31] are holy and pure and separated unto
[1:01:36] their God Amen it was something that the
[1:01:39] other pagans could not do because their
[1:01:42] sacrifices their gods their their their
[1:01:45] temples had nothing to be able to touch
[1:01:48] the heart of a man but the blood of
[1:01:51] Jesus Christ is so powerful that it
[1:01:56] makes you as holy as God is
[1:02:00] Holy amen uh brother Michael
