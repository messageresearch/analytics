[1:05:24] tonight we would just like to get right
[1:05:26] into the word of life
[1:05:28] we're going to go to the scripture in
[1:05:30] the book of matthew
[1:05:31] the seventh chapter
[1:05:33] amen matthew chapter 7.
[1:05:38] there's been a
[1:05:39] there's been enough word preached this
[1:05:41] week to save the entire planet
[1:05:44] amen these
[1:05:46] these guys they'll preach hour and a
[1:05:48] half or so and it's nothing but word on
[1:05:50] word
[1:05:51] and it's just it's just amazing amen all
[1:05:54] the filler gets cut out and the word
[1:05:55] gets preached amen
[1:05:57] amen matthew the seventh chapter i want
[1:06:00] to read the 28th and the 29th verse
[1:06:04] matthew
[1:06:06] 7 verse 28 29
[1:06:08] and it came to pass
[1:06:10] when jesus and into these sayings that
[1:06:12] the people were astonished at his
[1:06:14] doctrine
[1:06:16] for he taught them
[1:06:18] as one having authority
[1:06:21] and not as the scribes
[1:06:24] for he taught us one having authority
[1:06:28] and not as the scribes
[1:06:30] in matthew 17
[1:06:32] and verse 5.
[1:06:35] this is the mount transfiguration
[1:06:37] experience
[1:06:43] matthew 17.
[1:06:46] and verse 5
[1:06:48] and while he spake
[1:06:50] behold a bread a bright cloud
[1:06:53] overshadowed them
[1:06:55] and behold a voice out of this cloud
[1:06:57] which said
[1:06:59] this is my beloved son
[1:07:02] in whom i am well pleased
[1:07:05] hear
[1:07:06] ye
[1:07:07] him
[1:07:09] we ask the lord to bless his word as you
[1:07:10] can be seated
[1:07:12] i want to speak to you tonight for just
[1:07:14] a few minutes here
[1:07:16] upon the thought of the authority
[1:07:19] of the new creation
[1:07:22] the authority of the new creation
[1:07:25] amen when i'm reading this portion of
[1:07:27] scripture of course
[1:07:29] speaking about the lord jesus and the
[1:07:31] authority that he exercised while he was
[1:07:34] on the earth
[1:07:35] the bible tells us that when he taught
[1:07:38] of course he taught one as having
[1:07:40] authority in other words he knew what he
[1:07:42] was talking about
[1:07:43] and he wasn't asking the pharisees for
[1:07:46] their uh for their direction or for
[1:07:48] their what they thought the scripture
[1:07:50] meant they he hadn't been to any of
[1:07:52] their schools and he didn't come through
[1:07:55] any of their theological ideas
[1:07:57] but yet he taught the scripture as if he
[1:07:59] knew exactly what it meant
[1:08:02] and they noticed that he taught with
[1:08:04] authority
[1:08:06] without doubt or without question
[1:08:08] with no darkness in it
[1:08:10] now of course this this is what set
[1:08:13] jesus apart in his ministry in that
[1:08:16] that he was the interpretation of the
[1:08:19] actual word
[1:08:20] now in matthew 17 when you read here
[1:08:23] this is a is a portion of scripture that
[1:08:26] speaks about the transfiguration of
[1:08:28] jesus christ which is uh better known
[1:08:31] the adoption
[1:08:32] on mount transfiguration now what what
[1:08:35] is happening here in the scripture is
[1:08:37] that jesus has taken three men went upon
[1:08:39] this mountain and while he was there
[1:08:42] they was there was jesus was
[1:08:44] transfigured before them and the in the
[1:08:46] cloud that overshadowed them let them
[1:08:48] know
[1:08:49] that jesus was the place of god's
[1:08:52] authority
[1:08:54] now what we've what we find out about
[1:08:56] this is brother brahma will say it like
[1:08:57] this he said now i would take a text on
[1:08:59] hear ye him after all he's the voice of
[1:09:02] authority
[1:09:04] now god himself witnessed to that and
[1:09:06] said hear ye him therefore there are
[1:09:08] many voices in the world today many
[1:09:10] things going on many doctrines or isms
[1:09:12] but hear him
[1:09:14] see he's the voice of final authority
[1:09:18] he's the one that'll speak he's the one
[1:09:20] that said the heavens and earth shall
[1:09:21] pass away but my word shall never fail
[1:09:24] so hear ye him
[1:09:26] he's the one to listen to
[1:09:30] when you wonder who should you listen to
[1:09:33] jesus is the one you listen to
[1:09:36] he is the one it's his voice now if
[1:09:39] you're if you if you like to study the
[1:09:41] the scripture you'll find out that it
[1:09:43] was john that introduced jesus a couple
[1:09:46] of verses or chapters earlier and the
[1:09:49] scripture tells us that when he went to
[1:09:50] the river jordan that john's uh job
[1:09:53] john's entire job was to identify jesus
[1:09:57] when he come
[1:09:58] he was different than all the other
[1:09:59] prophets everybody else prophesied of
[1:10:01] his coming but john identified him when
[1:10:04] he did come and and and the scripture
[1:10:07] tells us that when he saw him the bible
[1:10:10] said that a voice spake and said this is
[1:10:12] my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to
[1:10:14] dwell in is that right now now it's it's
[1:10:18] a little bit later a few days later that
[1:10:20] jesus comes up here in matthew 17 he
[1:10:23] takes three disciples goes up on top of
[1:10:25] the mountain and while he's up there
[1:10:27] that same voice speaks but it said this
[1:10:30] is my beloved son and adds those words
[1:10:33] to it hear ye him now when this happened
[1:10:36] what was going on is god was identifying
[1:10:39] that jesus is the way the truth the life
[1:10:43] he is the authority so if you're going
[1:10:46] to get salvation it's through jesus
[1:10:48] christ if you're going to have truth
[1:10:50] it's jesus christ people say to me all
[1:10:52] times well who has truth
[1:10:54] jesus is truth
[1:10:56] is that right he he is all healing is
[1:10:59] through jesus christ all salvation is
[1:11:02] through jesus christ he is the supreme
[1:11:05] authority it's in him where he is the
[1:11:08] voice of final authority he's the one
[1:11:11] amen that you have to go to now the
[1:11:13] scripture says hear ye him now if it
[1:11:16] says hear ye him then you're looking at
[1:11:19] a prophecy that he will speak
[1:11:23] right if if the scripture says to you
[1:11:25] hear ye him then that's a prophecy he's
[1:11:28] going to speak
[1:11:31] do you see that now if if he is going to
[1:11:33] speak he's going to be the voice of
[1:11:36] authority when he speaks now the bible
[1:11:39] will tell us in john chapter 5 and verse
[1:11:41] 24 that he who that hears his voice and
[1:11:44] believes that voice the bible said he's
[1:11:47] passed from death unto life and shall
[1:11:48] not come into condemnation is that right
[1:11:52] so we find out then if you're hearing a
[1:11:54] voice tonight how do you know the voice
[1:11:57] you're hearing is the voice of jesus
[1:11:59] christ
[1:12:00] there's a lot of people today claim to
[1:12:02] have salvation and they say we hear his
[1:12:05] voice but how do you know the voice
[1:12:07] you're hearing is the voice of god
[1:12:10] unless you can trace this voice all the
[1:12:12] way back to the physical body of jesus
[1:12:16] christ you're not sure what you're
[1:12:17] hearing amen but in this generation god
[1:12:20] has given us the grace to have an
[1:12:22] abstract upon the voice that we are
[1:12:25] listening to and it has been traced from
[1:12:27] the literal body of jesus christ right
[1:12:30] up through seven church ages and
[1:12:32] messengers until it come all the way to
[1:12:34] the end and then the bible tells us that
[1:12:37] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:12:39] angel when he shall begin to sound that
[1:12:41] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:12:44] it has been given unto the servants of
[1:12:46] prophets now that prophet stood here in
[1:12:49] the end time and said i meant that he
[1:12:51] appointed a final voice to a final age
[1:12:55] and it would be a bride who would come
[1:12:57] under the authority of that word and
[1:13:00] they would stand in the same authority
[1:13:02] that spoke two thousand years ago would
[1:13:04] be speaking the word in this generation
[1:13:07] there still remains a voice of authority
[1:13:10] there still remains a voice on the earth
[1:13:13] today god still has a bride and he still
[1:13:15] has a voice amen amen i believe it i
[1:13:18] believe personally that the scripture
[1:13:20] are teaching us that we have come to a
[1:13:22] mount transfiguration experience today
[1:13:25] that we have heard that same voice speak
[1:13:28] out of heaven and say this is my beloved
[1:13:30] one hear ye him
[1:13:33] amen this is adoption time church we had
[1:13:36] a river jordan and we had a mount
[1:13:39] transfiguration but we've now had an
[1:13:41] ohio river and we've had a sunset
[1:13:44] mountain and that same voice has
[1:13:46] identified an authority on the earth
[1:13:49] today i don't believe we're in confusion
[1:13:52] i believe that god has identified
[1:13:54] something in this generation now the
[1:13:57] prophet of god says in spoken word
[1:13:58] original see he said listen now in the
[1:14:01] last days there'll be a true church
[1:14:03] bribe it'll come to the headstone and we
[1:14:05] will be a super church a super race as
[1:14:09] we near that headstone they will be so
[1:14:11] much like him even they will be in this
[1:14:14] very image in order to be united with
[1:14:16] him they will have to be the very
[1:14:18] manifestation of the living word of god
[1:14:20] denominations can never produce this
[1:14:23] they will produce creeds and dogmas
[1:14:25] mixed with their word it will be a
[1:14:26] hybrid product but nothing can produce
[1:14:29] the word made manifest outside of god
[1:14:32] himself and here what we're looking at
[1:14:35] is is we're not in the in the time of
[1:14:37] the beginning of the church we're not
[1:14:39] down here in the time of faith or
[1:14:42] temperance or amen we're not just in the
[1:14:44] in the middle of this of this mountain
[1:14:47] of transfiguration but the church of the
[1:14:49] living god amen has been brought up to
[1:14:51] the headstone
[1:14:53] we've been brought up to the capstone in
[1:14:55] this age which speaks something to us as
[1:14:57] we near that headstone the church will
[1:15:00] be a super church
[1:15:02] she will be a super race now if a
[1:15:05] prophet identified were in that time
[1:15:08] whether you understand this or not you
[1:15:11] are a super church you are a super race
[1:15:14] and i think it's time you start acting
[1:15:16] like who god said you are amen we're not
[1:15:20] just a trodden down little group of
[1:15:22] nobodies sitting in the corner amen but
[1:15:25] god by his own voice has identified his
[1:15:28] pride as a super church as a super race
[1:15:32] as an authority in the word of god of
[1:15:35] course amen there's going to be a
[1:15:37] contentions on this there's going to be
[1:15:39] others that's not going to like this but
[1:15:41] listen we are coming to the time of the
[1:15:44] adoption of the church
[1:15:46] in ephesians 1 paul said we were
[1:15:49] predestinated unto the adoption
[1:15:51] in other words predestinated god saw a
[1:15:54] destiny you wasn't going to be shuck you
[1:15:56] wasn't going to be stuck you were coming
[1:15:58] to be seen
[1:16:00] there's a destiny over your life it's to
[1:16:02] be conformed into the image of the son
[1:16:05] of god we are not to be a church we are
[1:16:08] to be a bride and that bride will be a
[1:16:10] manifestation of every word that is
[1:16:12] written in this bible we are not here
[1:16:15] for church memberships we are not here
[1:16:17] for social events we are here to
[1:16:20] manifest the presence of almighty god in
[1:16:23] this generation until this age knows
[1:16:26] there's a bride and that blood has a
[1:16:28] husband and that husband is almighty god
[1:16:34] i believe we're coming to a fullness of
[1:16:36] adoption people say to me since i've
[1:16:37] been a little boy preaching this message
[1:16:39] they'd say to me brother wayne you know
[1:16:41] this adoption y'all talk about isn't
[1:16:43] that the body change isn't that the body
[1:16:45] change i say absolutely for sure the
[1:16:47] fullness of adoption is the body change
[1:16:50] but what about first john the third
[1:16:52] chapter
[1:16:53] but what about it when the bible said
[1:16:55] what kind of love has god gave us that
[1:16:58] he could call us the sons of god
[1:17:02] now i'll tell you if he says manner
[1:17:03] that's two kinds right that's a god
[1:17:05] praying divine what kind of love did god
[1:17:08] love you with he could take you in your
[1:17:10] unruly place in the situations of your
[1:17:12] life and all of your problems and he
[1:17:15] could call you a son of god now people
[1:17:18] say well does that mean daughter of
[1:17:19] course it means an attribute whether
[1:17:21] that attribute is a male or female that
[1:17:23] has nothing to do with it as a son of
[1:17:26] god you are an attribute of god and that
[1:17:29] means you come from god so you can go
[1:17:31] back to god now the bible said that we
[1:17:35] are now the sons of god
[1:17:37] we are right now attributes of almighty
[1:17:40] god manifested in a time amen which we
[1:17:44] came from eternity
[1:17:46] so there's an eternal quality to the
[1:17:48] elect
[1:17:49] now the bible said as many as received
[1:17:51] him
[1:17:52] to them he gave power to become the sons
[1:17:55] of god now that's not power like muscle
[1:17:57] power that's a liberty that's a fire
[1:18:00] team
[1:18:01] now i just have to put this the best way
[1:18:03] i know how to say it amen you were
[1:18:05] always sons
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:09] you never become son on any day you
[1:18:11] never became a son when you became a
[1:18:13] christian you never became that when you
[1:18:16] came into the message you always were a
[1:18:19] son
[1:18:21] come on church we're talking about
[1:18:23] eternal life when did eternity begin
[1:18:26] tell me there was no beginning to
[1:18:29] eternity eternity always was and if
[1:18:32] you're a son or a daughter of god you
[1:18:34] always were a son or daughter of god and
[1:18:37] that's the reason you receive the word
[1:18:39] when you come into your age because god
[1:18:42] anointed you to see it and to receive it
[1:18:44] into your age and because you are a son
[1:18:47] he has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:18:50] whereby we would cry at my father
[1:18:55] brother we would call him our daddy amen
[1:18:58] we have now received the spirit of
[1:19:00] adoption whereby as being sons as being
[1:19:04] seed
[1:19:06] as being seen are you with me now i
[1:19:09] don't know if we got any doctors in the
[1:19:10] building
[1:19:11] amen probably has some kind of physician
[1:19:14] assistants or nurses or somebody and
[1:19:17] medical people amen uh or just
[1:19:19] hillbillies could answer this is there
[1:19:21] anybody in this building
[1:19:23] that wasn't a seed before they were
[1:19:25] human
[1:19:27] did anybody
[1:19:29] did anybody in this building get a birth
[1:19:32] without being the seed of their dad
[1:19:36] i don't believe there's anybody sitting
[1:19:37] in here right now fellowshipping with us
[1:19:40] except that they pre-existed as their
[1:19:42] father
[1:19:43] you were here on the earth in the 1800s
[1:19:45] but you were walking around in the body
[1:19:47] of your father or grandfather or some
[1:19:49] other father i'm old church come on you
[1:19:52] might not even been in this america you
[1:19:54] were somewhere else all together but you
[1:19:56] were in somebody else's body at some
[1:19:59] other time you existed in their body as
[1:20:02] a human life but you are deposited into
[1:20:05] your mother as a seed and now you're
[1:20:07] here as a human being having fellowship
[1:20:10] outside of your father but you still
[1:20:12] have the traits of your father you still
[1:20:14] believe and act and talk and you look a
[1:20:17] certainly because of who you are in your
[1:20:20] father is that right
[1:20:22] that if that's true as a human it's the
[1:20:24] same as the son of almighty god amen
[1:20:27] you're not just a homo sapien you're a
[1:20:30] son of god your theos of god had come
[1:20:33] from god came from eternity manifested
[1:20:36] in a body and was a seed to begin with
[1:20:39] already
[1:20:41] you were already a seed
[1:20:45] it's a preacher why are you preaching
[1:20:46] like that because i want you to say i
[1:20:47] want you to realize something the
[1:20:49] prophet of god said the rain falls on
[1:20:51] the just and the unjust
[1:20:53] [Applause]
[1:20:56] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:20:58] unjust but you want to know why the rain
[1:21:00] comes
[1:21:02] brother bran said the rain come because
[1:21:03] there's a seed
[1:21:06] and if there's a super seed in the end
[1:21:08] time there's a super rain to fall on
[1:21:10] that seed
[1:21:12] and every time the seed word starts
[1:21:16] watering the word that's in your life
[1:21:18] amen everything on the planet gets
[1:21:20] watered by that same seed
[1:21:23] same water falls on the whole thing
[1:21:25] people say well i'll tell you what's a
[1:21:27] bunch of i'll tell you why there's a
[1:21:28] bunch of hypocrites down there this is
[1:21:30] happening that's happening and they just
[1:21:32] get up and shout around everything else
[1:21:33] hey man i can't believe all that worship
[1:21:35] and praise and all that stuff going on
[1:21:37] down there and all the problems they got
[1:21:38] they said i want you to know something
[1:21:40] god didn't send the reign for the
[1:21:42] hypocrite he sent the reign for the
[1:21:43] believer and people said well i tell you
[1:21:46] what people would shout and dance and
[1:21:47] everything else and still be lost amen
[1:21:49] you don't think that i don't know that
[1:21:52] you know how insulting it is for
[1:21:54] theologians to try to ring me up or text
[1:21:56] me and say brother wayne you're
[1:21:58] preaching experience but don't you know
[1:22:00] that anybody can have experience anybody
[1:22:02] can do this i said yes of course i read
[1:22:05] the bible of course i read what the
[1:22:07] prophet said but i'm not looking at the
[1:22:09] weeds brother i'm looking at the seed
[1:22:12] i'm not worried about the weeds that's
[1:22:14] in this earth i say god there's gonna
[1:22:16] come a reign of the holy ghost that
[1:22:19] touch the seed lie that's in the
[1:22:21] believer this is a harvest time the seed
[1:22:25] must come to ripening and maturity to do
[1:22:28] it we've got to have the rain of the
[1:22:30] baptism of the holy ghost so i say let
[1:22:33] it rain let it rain with fire
[1:22:36] let it reign with the glory of god let
[1:22:38] the spirit of god come
[1:22:41] i'm not looking at the weeds i'm looking
[1:22:43] at the seed
[1:22:45] bring the rain
[1:22:48] somebody's coming to adoption in this
[1:22:50] age somebody's going to rise up in this
[1:22:53] age
[1:22:56] [Applause]
[1:22:58] come on we're right now the sons of god
[1:23:01] we're not going to be we are right now
[1:23:04] so by the way i tell you we don't want
[1:23:06] those kind of things going on in our
[1:23:08] church do you know that laodicea has
[1:23:10] brought christ out
[1:23:12] do you all know that
[1:23:14] loud as he has brought christ out amen
[1:23:16] and the last place he has anywheres to
[1:23:19] be is in the bright churches i pray to
[1:23:21] god we don't put him out i pray that we
[1:23:24] have put out the move of the holy ghost
[1:23:26] and the power of god listen we still
[1:23:29] need the move and the holy ghost to come
[1:23:32] into the church with an anointing and
[1:23:34] change hearts and life
[1:23:36] we don't need a thousand more marriage
[1:23:38] counselors we need an experience an
[1:23:41] encounter with a living god with
[1:23:43] authority and power to fall into the
[1:23:45] church
[1:23:50] by the way
[1:23:51] what in the world is wrong with you i'll
[1:23:53] tell you what's wrong with me we need
[1:23:54] god
[1:23:58] we need god to come into our churches
[1:24:03] when we when he comes in we don't want
[1:24:05] to call him some bad name
[1:24:08] identify him with something wrong
[1:24:13] we are right now sons and daughters of
[1:24:15] god now this ain't off in the future
[1:24:17] somewhere
[1:24:18] but we're right now seated
[1:24:21] in heavenly places
[1:24:24] now there's a there's a teaching i'm not
[1:24:26] going to teach on it but you if you'd
[1:24:28] like to study it study heavenly places a
[1:24:30] little while
[1:24:31] we're right now seated in heavenly
[1:24:33] places
[1:24:34] as sons and daughters of god see it
[1:24:36] don't appear what we shall be in the end
[1:24:37] but we know we shall be like him
[1:24:40] we'll even have a body like his
[1:24:42] and we'll see him as he is
[1:24:45] do you know that jesus christ is in this
[1:24:47] building tonight
[1:24:53] i've got enough scripture to cover you
[1:24:54] up to prove my point
[1:24:56] there's an overwhelming amount of
[1:24:58] scriptural evidence that he's in this
[1:24:59] building
[1:25:02] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[1:25:04] name
[1:25:06] there
[1:25:07] i will be
[1:25:08] in the midst of them
[1:25:11] is that what he said
[1:25:12] yet a little while and the world shall
[1:25:14] see me no more but you shall see me
[1:25:17] for i be with you even
[1:25:20] until the end of the world
[1:25:23] the prophet of god said jesus christ is
[1:25:25] in this building tonight to perform
[1:25:27] miracles
[1:25:29] he's not here just to come as an
[1:25:32] entertainer
[1:25:33] he's not here just to be a sideshow to
[1:25:36] us having some songs and somebody
[1:25:38] preaching some word he's here to do
[1:25:41] miracles in this building tonight
[1:25:44] god is here to fix marriages god is here
[1:25:47] to fix homes god is here to give the
[1:25:49] holy ghost god is here to change lies
[1:25:52] god is here to call preachers god is
[1:25:54] here to show a supernatural act god is
[1:25:57] here tonight as a miracle-working god
[1:26:00] but the prophet of god said he's going
[1:26:02] to do it through his church
[1:26:04] [Applause]
[1:26:06] so if you block god out of being in the
[1:26:09] church you'll never see a miracle
[1:26:12] you're never going to see a move of god
[1:26:14] because what god is doing is in and
[1:26:17] through his people
[1:26:22] now the prophet of god will say watch if
[1:26:25] you lay your hands on the sick they
[1:26:26] shall recover in my name they shall cast
[1:26:28] out devils is that right the
[1:26:30] commission's given to the church what's
[1:26:32] the matter with the church today it
[1:26:34] doesn't know its position
[1:26:40] amen
[1:26:42] no
[1:26:43] watch the prophet say this
[1:26:45] if you knowed positionally who you was
[1:26:49] and what you are tonight
[1:26:51] there wouldn't be a feeble person in
[1:26:53] this bill in the next five minutes
[1:26:58] you must be somebody with god
[1:27:03] you're more than you think you are with
[1:27:04] god
[1:27:08] you might not know who you are but the
[1:27:10] prophet told us who you are
[1:27:12] if you knowed positionally what god made
[1:27:15] you
[1:27:16] there wouldn't be a feeble person in
[1:27:18] here in the next five minutes you see
[1:27:20] what he's saying he's saying god has
[1:27:22] given to you something more than you're
[1:27:25] obtaining something more than you can
[1:27:27] catch your ability to consume it is not
[1:27:30] as powerful as the potential that has
[1:27:33] been given to you
[1:27:36] what is it it's the supreme authority
[1:27:38] that jesus christ has given to every
[1:27:41] believer
[1:27:42] now i know
[1:27:44] that you may think there's a lot of
[1:27:45] things wrong with the church
[1:27:48] i know people that thinks there's all
[1:27:49] kinds of problems and curses and every
[1:27:52] kind of life but but coming from a
[1:27:54] prophet he said i want you to know
[1:27:57] what i believe is the greatest curse
[1:27:59] that's on the church today
[1:28:03] what kind of curse
[1:28:05] rests on the church today
[1:28:07] he said it's not knowing what they are
[1:28:12] you thought it was your heritage does
[1:28:14] your mom dad your thoughts where you was
[1:28:16] born you thought it was some situation
[1:28:18] that's happening in your life the
[1:28:20] greatest curse that's on the church is
[1:28:22] not knowing who you are
[1:28:25] come on now
[1:28:26] but god sent this message to break the
[1:28:29] curses
[1:28:32] the word will break the curse the
[1:28:35] message come to tell you who you are
[1:28:41] what is it it has to be a word of
[1:28:43] authority
[1:28:45] a supreme authority
[1:28:47] to come to break
[1:28:48] the curse
[1:28:50] of unknowing
[1:28:51] i think of the scripture in second
[1:28:53] corinthians 5 and 17
[1:28:56] therefore if any man be in christ
[1:28:58] he is a new creature
[1:29:00] and all things are passed away
[1:29:02] and all things are new
[1:29:05] if any man be in christ now watch the
[1:29:08] word they spell m-a-n if any man be in
[1:29:11] christ isn't it beautiful that that a
[1:29:14] man can be in christ
[1:29:16] because after all
[1:29:18] aren't you really trying to be an angel
[1:29:21] isn't that really what you're in your
[1:29:23] thought pattern isn't that really what
[1:29:24] you're isn't that what your focus is on
[1:29:29] isn't that really what you think
[1:29:30] adoption is
[1:29:32] is angels walking around on the earth
[1:29:35] and nobody got no problems
[1:29:38] come on that's a devil that's lied to
[1:29:41] you
[1:29:42] and you've misunderstood
[1:29:44] the promise over your life and it's left
[1:29:47] you in a mess because you're stealing
[1:29:49] the human body
[1:29:52] and you're fighting wars that you don't
[1:29:54] understand
[1:29:55] because in your mind you're thinking if
[1:29:58] i get the holy ghost i'll have no more
[1:30:00] battles if i get the holy ghost there'll
[1:30:02] be no more troubles that's contrary to
[1:30:05] the word of god
[1:30:06] the prophet of god said when you get the
[1:30:09] holy ghost is when the battle started on
[1:30:11] you
[1:30:15] you wasn't war until you got the holy
[1:30:17] ghost but when you got the holy ghost
[1:30:18] that's when the devil started roaring
[1:30:21] against you and you're alive
[1:30:25] you know it's true
[1:30:27] but if any man be in christ
[1:30:31] how does an m-a-n get in christ he has
[1:30:34] to become a new creature
[1:30:37] what is that new creature it's a new
[1:30:40] creation
[1:30:42] now the only way to understand the
[1:30:44] creation is to go back to the old
[1:30:47] look i don't know if you realize this
[1:30:49] but there's a genesis in the middle of
[1:30:51] the bible it's called the book of
[1:30:52] matthew
[1:30:54] it is a new creation when jesus the
[1:30:58] original creator
[1:31:00] came to the earth and began to recreate
[1:31:05] come on church look what he done to adam
[1:31:07] in the beginning he blew the breath of
[1:31:09] life into him and made him a living soul
[1:31:12] he was a man but he wasn't alive he was
[1:31:15] afraid but he wasn't alive but god
[1:31:18] breathed the breath of life into him and
[1:31:20] the same god amen buried on the day of
[1:31:23] pentecost he breathed the breath of life
[1:31:26] into man and started a new creation
[1:31:31] come on your first birth made you a son
[1:31:34] of the first adam your second birth made
[1:31:37] you a son of the second adam
[1:31:40] we are sons of the second adam we're not
[1:31:43] born to the church we're born to the
[1:31:46] word of god and therefore being a new
[1:31:48] creation we are in christ jesus and we
[1:31:51] are heirs and ambassadors with almighty
[1:31:54] god
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:31:58] this new creation is a spiritual kingdom
[1:32:02] everybody's looking for the kingdom the
[1:32:05] new creation is the kingdom of god
[1:32:09] it's a spiritual kingdom lord when will
[1:32:11] you restore the kingdom when you're
[1:32:13] going to put the jewish kingdom back he
[1:32:15] said it's not even for you to know the
[1:32:17] time of the hour but when the holy ghost
[1:32:19] comes
[1:32:21] but when the holy ghost comes he shall
[1:32:23] give you power he'll set up a kingdom
[1:32:26] it's not the kingdom of the earth it's a
[1:32:28] heavenly kingdom in the earth amen our
[1:32:31] father which is in heaven hallowed be
[1:32:32] thy name thy kingdom come
[1:32:35] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:32:39] heaven he's not talking about just on
[1:32:41] the planet he's talking about the will
[1:32:43] of god walking in human life
[1:32:46] human beings
[1:32:47] human beings with their failures but the
[1:32:50] will of god has took over their lives
[1:32:56] god has already pre-adorned pre-anointed
[1:32:59] pre-arranged the adoption of the church
[1:33:02] and there is nothing can stop it now
[1:33:08] somebody said brother wayne can't
[1:33:10] understand this new
[1:33:12] kingdom stuff you talk about jesus told
[1:33:14] nicodemus unless you're born again you
[1:33:16] can't see it
[1:33:19] unless you're born again you can't see
[1:33:21] the kingdom
[1:33:22] because it's a birth but it's not coming
[1:33:24] through your mother's womb the second
[1:33:25] time
[1:33:26] this verse is of the water of the blood
[1:33:28] and the spirit
[1:33:31] now
[1:33:32] jesus was the one that started this
[1:33:34] doctrine
[1:33:36] when he said lo
[1:33:38] the kingdom is neither here nor there
[1:33:40] but the kingdom of god
[1:33:42] is within you
[1:33:45] so there
[1:33:46] is some theologian somewhere
[1:33:48] that'll try to split hairs with you
[1:33:51] and make you think well you're trying to
[1:33:52] say there's no heaven and there's no
[1:33:53] this
[1:33:54] no we're not saying that at all
[1:33:56] we're saying exactly what the scripture
[1:33:58] said and if that was your focus you
[1:34:00] would never believe someone's teaching
[1:34:01] something differently
[1:34:04] come on
[1:34:05] but it's got to the place where every
[1:34:07] time you say something the scripture
[1:34:09] says somebody said well you're making
[1:34:11] room for this you're making room for
[1:34:12] that by preaching the message i'm making
[1:34:14] room for something
[1:34:19] said preacher what are you talking about
[1:34:20] i think we ought to get back to
[1:34:22] preaching the message and quit trying to
[1:34:24] explain why everybody else is wrong
[1:34:27] why don't we tell what's right for once
[1:34:29] i tell you what's right a man to get the
[1:34:32] holy ghost and the kingdom of god to
[1:34:35] move into the church of the living god
[1:34:37] let the word have its endurance in the
[1:34:40] church and its authority and its power
[1:34:42] no i'm not scared that i'm going to
[1:34:44] start some weird doctrine by preaching
[1:34:47] what christ preached when he said the
[1:34:49] kingdom of god is within you
[1:34:51] [Applause]
[1:34:54] i'm not going to say here there i'm
[1:34:55] going to say it's in the earth it's in
[1:34:57] the church god's kingdom is not of this
[1:35:00] earth but it's in our hearts
[1:35:03] it is a spiritual kingdom quoting
[1:35:05] there's a spiritual kingdom the kingdom
[1:35:07] of god comes but not without violence
[1:35:10] the kingdom of god is within you the
[1:35:12] holy spirit god's kingdom moving in man
[1:35:15] governing and controlling him
[1:35:18] that's the kingdom
[1:35:21] i know there's a lot of people building
[1:35:22] up churches right now
[1:35:24] i know i'm not interested
[1:35:28] i'm interested in building one church
[1:35:31] and that's the church of the living god
[1:35:35] and it's got one headquarters and that's
[1:35:37] almighty god
[1:35:40] come on if you're gonna have another
[1:35:41] headquarters make it wrong would you
[1:35:44] be an original once quit being an
[1:35:47] impersonator and say well we're not
[1:35:49] methodist and we're not baptist but you
[1:35:50] got a headshit somewhere besides the
[1:35:53] word you're just as catholic as the
[1:35:55] first ones were why don't you be an
[1:35:57] original catholic
[1:36:00] so preacher what are you talking about
[1:36:01] i'm talking about false teaching taking
[1:36:04] the place of the handship of jesus
[1:36:06] christ i believe we ought to make him
[1:36:08] head again we ought to make him king
[1:36:10] again
[1:36:11] make his word king among the church
[1:36:14] ruling in the heart of the believers
[1:36:16] [Applause]
[1:36:20] you say preacher what do you say the
[1:36:21] kingdom is i tell you what the prophet
[1:36:23] said it is he said it's god in his word
[1:36:26] made power
[1:36:29] now i'll tell you how to know if
[1:36:31] somebody's in the kingdom tell them what
[1:36:32] the word said and see if it has any
[1:36:34] power over them
[1:36:36] you can tell some people what the word
[1:36:38] is has no
[1:36:39] bearing at all over them
[1:36:42] you say well the the word teaches this
[1:36:44] is this and they'll say well that really
[1:36:46] don't matter to me
[1:36:49] not the kingdom of god there
[1:36:53] the kingdom of god is when the word that
[1:36:56] you're reading
[1:36:58] takes power
[1:36:59] in your life
[1:37:03] the prophet of god said the kingdom of
[1:37:04] god is
[1:37:05] his word made power of course that's
[1:37:08] first corinthians 4 20 the kingdom of
[1:37:10] god is god's word made power
[1:37:12] what is the kingdom of god it's within
[1:37:14] you
[1:37:15] and when the word comes in there
[1:37:17] and does the word begin it turns itself
[1:37:20] into power
[1:37:22] making it say just exactly what it said
[1:37:26] now
[1:37:27] see it turns itself
[1:37:29] its word into power
[1:37:31] so with being teach
[1:37:34] the words of god intellectually
[1:37:37] they are building intellectual kingdoms
[1:37:40] under their understandings
[1:37:43] now you said preacher why would you say
[1:37:44] that because the bible said in first
[1:37:46] thessalonians 1
[1:37:47] our gospel
[1:37:48] came not unto you in word only
[1:37:51] but in power and the holy ghost and such
[1:37:53] assurance now
[1:37:55] paul said our gospel
[1:37:59] isn't that beautiful some time ago i was
[1:38:01] listening tate brother brown said some
[1:38:02] some preachers said brother adam we
[1:38:04] don't believe that he said who's we
[1:38:09] he said is that you and your group of
[1:38:11] guys
[1:38:12] he said because it ain't you and god
[1:38:16] we don't believe we don't believe but
[1:38:18] paul said our gospel who's our
[1:38:22] come on church who's our
[1:38:25] well the bible paul calls it the gospel
[1:38:28] of god
[1:38:30] so paul's gospel was the gospel that god
[1:38:33] had concerning jesus christ
[1:38:36] what gospel are you listening to
[1:38:39] he said well there's not another gospel
[1:38:41] paul said there wasn't he said there's
[1:38:43] not another gospel but you've been
[1:38:44] turned from the original gospel
[1:38:46] and the gospel of jesus christ is the
[1:38:49] gospel that he's alive
[1:38:52] look the gospel of paul was the gospel
[1:38:55] he said if an angel come teach you any
[1:38:57] other thing
[1:38:58] let him be accursed
[1:39:00] so paul's gospel was god's gospel
[1:39:03] that became william branham's gospel
[1:39:06] let me just say this william branham
[1:39:08] restored the word
[1:39:12] somebody said to me one time so brother
[1:39:14] wayne brother brown didn't preach what
[1:39:15] paul preached i said well according to
[1:39:17] the vision
[1:39:18] when he went to the other side
[1:39:21] he said i'll be judged and if paul is
[1:39:23] okay i'll be okay
[1:39:26] because i preached what paul preached
[1:39:30] come on church
[1:39:32] paul preached it
[1:39:34] he meant manifold wisdom of god paul
[1:39:37] preached that word paul preached a god
[1:39:40] that'll change your life
[1:39:42] paul preached and he preached to the
[1:39:44] gentiles
[1:39:45] who were idol packing idolatrous and he
[1:39:48] said god could come into you and make
[1:39:50] you a son of almighty god by the hearing
[1:39:54] of the word through the spirit of the
[1:39:56] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:40:01] now it's a gospel brother madam says it
[1:40:04] like this we are his gospel on the earth
[1:40:07] isn't that powerful
[1:40:09] then the gospel is not in word only but
[1:40:11] in power and human flesh
[1:40:14] we are his eyes we are his feet we are
[1:40:16] his legs god is here to do miracles and
[1:40:19] he's here to do it in the church
[1:40:21] you are his gospel that's a direct quote
[1:40:23] you're the gospel on the earth
[1:40:27] do you know that matthew 24 said the
[1:40:29] gospel the kingdom must be preached unto
[1:40:30] all the ends of the earth
[1:40:32] and then the end shall come matthew 24
[1:40:34] 14.
[1:40:35] do you know brother bam said under the
[1:40:36] sardis age
[1:40:38] he said missionaries like no other time
[1:40:40] went out and covered the entire earth
[1:40:41] think of it every nation under the
[1:40:43] heavens has already heard the word
[1:40:46] it completed that many many many years
[1:40:48] ago
[1:40:49] he said but not the gospel
[1:40:52] he said just the word the letter killeth
[1:40:57] but the spirit giveth life they heard
[1:40:59] the bible being taught in sardis age
[1:41:04] but the gospel wasn't preached until the
[1:41:07] last age
[1:41:09] because it took the spirit to make it
[1:41:12] live then the bible doesn't say go young
[1:41:14] the world and teach i said go the world
[1:41:15] and preach
[1:41:18] to preach is to manifest
[1:41:20] in other words god has empowered the
[1:41:22] church
[1:41:23] to manifest his news
[1:41:27] some people some people get up in the
[1:41:29] morning read the news
[1:41:31] the news is a newspaper they read words
[1:41:34] some people read the bible it's news to
[1:41:36] them
[1:41:37] but the prophet of god said this news
[1:41:39] does not come in word only
[1:41:42] this is news you can read in
[1:41:45] people who have been written by the hand
[1:41:48] of almighty god
[1:41:50] the written word living manifesting what
[1:41:53] is it amen there's a message in the last
[1:41:55] day that for the first time for a bright
[1:41:58] age out of a resurrection of dark
[1:42:00] denominationalism will be a message
[1:42:03] that the full maturity of the word is
[1:42:05] turned again into its full power
[1:42:07] and being waved over the people by the
[1:42:09] same signs and wonders that were done
[1:42:11] back there why because the gospel is
[1:42:14] being preached with kingdom authority in
[1:42:17] the church of the living god
[1:42:19] it's a messianic kingdom it's a kingdom
[1:42:21] where christ has dominion over the
[1:42:24] church
[1:42:27] now in mark the 11th chapter jesus
[1:42:30] now
[1:42:31] do you all know that there's a
[1:42:32] difference in god and little gods
[1:42:38] now jesus is when god became a little
[1:42:41] god
[1:42:42] and remained the big god
[1:42:46] brother braham said he was the only
[1:42:47] little god without sin
[1:42:50] he said if you say unto this mountain ye
[1:42:52] little gods
[1:42:53] he said there was only one little god
[1:42:55] without sin
[1:42:57] and that was when god entered humanity
[1:42:59] in little god form
[1:43:03] well i mean i thought it was pretty good
[1:43:09] and since he was
[1:43:10] a little god without sin he introduced
[1:43:13] this new race called the new creation
[1:43:18] the race of the second adam mark the
[1:43:20] 11th chapter
[1:43:21] gives us an outline of jesus showing
[1:43:26] that he was teaching his disciples of
[1:43:29] another level of authority over creation
[1:43:33] now remember
[1:43:34] remember since the time of adam there
[1:43:37] had been nobody exercise a spoken word
[1:43:40] over nature as such as for the trees for
[1:43:43] the mountains that that has not been
[1:43:45] been exercised like this but jesus walks
[1:43:48] by a fruit tree sees the thing doesn't
[1:43:50] have any fruit and curses
[1:43:54] and and within 24 hours
[1:43:57] his disciples walking with him walk back
[1:43:59] by that same tree and they see that tree
[1:44:01] and they say to him lord the tree it
[1:44:04] withers and jesus said unto them amen
[1:44:07] now now don't marvel yourself
[1:44:10] if you would have faith in god
[1:44:13] you could say unto this tree you could
[1:44:15] stay into this mountain
[1:44:18] if you can believe and not doubt in your
[1:44:20] heart
[1:44:22] now he said you you could be able to do
[1:44:24] this same thing
[1:44:26] now jesus began to teach this if you
[1:44:28] continue to read this in mark the 11th
[1:44:30] chapter and read down to the 28th verse
[1:44:32] where he institutes this the 23rd verse
[1:44:35] read right down to the 28th verse and
[1:44:37] then the pharisees heard
[1:44:40] of this teaching this man was doing
[1:44:43] and they were problems with this
[1:44:45] they come to jesus and they actually
[1:44:47] said unto him by what authority do you
[1:44:49] teach these things
[1:44:52] what what what school of pharisees have
[1:44:55] you come from to teach these humans that
[1:44:58] they can control nature by their words
[1:45:00] like our father can
[1:45:04] you didn't get this teaching approved
[1:45:06] through any of our channels
[1:45:08] we didn't we did not our bishops are
[1:45:12] our apostle didn't approve that teaching
[1:45:15] for the church
[1:45:16] you can't be reading those quotes to the
[1:45:19] church we don't approve them in our
[1:45:22] little circle
[1:45:24] but what authority do you teach these
[1:45:27] things
[1:45:29] and jesus
[1:45:30] and jesus just looks at the man and said
[1:45:33] unto him well i'll ask you a question he
[1:45:35] says and then i'll tell you by what
[1:45:37] authority if you'll answer me did john's
[1:45:40] baptism now was it from heaven or from
[1:45:42] man
[1:45:44] and they didn't like that question at
[1:45:46] all because if they said it was from
[1:45:48] heaven
[1:45:49] john was the one that introduced jesus
[1:45:52] as the very messiah of the lamb of god
[1:45:55] come on amen if it was for man then they
[1:45:58] all believed john was a great man and
[1:46:01] they would have been condemned by their
[1:46:02] own people so they were left at a
[1:46:04] standstill with not being able to be
[1:46:06] against it before it amen but jesus was
[1:46:09] making his point that the authority
[1:46:11] which i preached from is not from man
[1:46:14] it's from heaven
[1:46:16] and i tell you this the authority the
[1:46:18] jurisdiction that jesus christ had did
[1:46:21] not come from a group of men it didn't
[1:46:23] come from a pharisee he didn't come from
[1:46:25] the school it come from almighty god he
[1:46:28] was introduced as the messiah and i'll
[1:46:31] tell you i think it's time to shake this
[1:46:34] tale and tell them come see we have
[1:46:37] found the messiah
[1:46:42] you say found the messiah yes we found
[1:46:44] the messiah you say the messiah well are
[1:46:47] you if you're not a pagan we found him
[1:46:51] you said what do you mean what are you
[1:46:52] talking about by the way there is
[1:46:54] discipline one god
[1:46:57] the messiah is not a man it is the
[1:47:00] spirit of jesus christ that is returned
[1:47:03] in the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:47:07] [Applause]
[1:47:11] it's the truth people say well we want
[1:47:12] jesus to return and the holy ghost comes
[1:47:15] in the church and they kick it out
[1:47:17] what they meant is they wanted their own
[1:47:18] brand of jesus
[1:47:20] but they don't want what he promised he
[1:47:22] said yet a little while and the world
[1:47:24] will see me no more but i will be with
[1:47:27] you even in you to the end of the age i
[1:47:29] is a personal pronoun then i jesus is
[1:47:32] not an emotion the holy ghost is not an
[1:47:35] emotional workout don't you water this
[1:47:38] down by saying it's emotion or
[1:47:40] fanaticism it is the presence of jesus
[1:47:44] christ in his authority and his power
[1:47:47] that causes the stir in the church of
[1:47:50] the living god that's what the noise is
[1:47:52] about that's what the shout is about
[1:47:54] that's what it's about it's jesus christ
[1:47:58] [Applause]
[1:48:04] this voice which speaks to us come from
[1:48:06] heaven
[1:48:10] i don't have a i don't have the ability
[1:48:12] i wish i had better ability to preach it
[1:48:14] to you but you can say this with me
[1:48:15] always and only
[1:48:18] the word always and only comes to a
[1:48:20] prophet
[1:48:22] is that right
[1:48:23] amos the third chapter
[1:48:25] when jesus came to the earth where did
[1:48:27] he go
[1:48:29] he went to john didn't he he didn't go
[1:48:32] to the pharisees he went to john and was
[1:48:34] scripturally identified as the lamb of
[1:48:36] god
[1:48:39] always and only to a prophet that's why
[1:48:42] when the word returned in this age it
[1:48:44] went to a prophet
[1:48:46] it went to a prophet of god and he
[1:48:49] introduced the messiah to this
[1:48:50] generation not as a human but in a human
[1:48:55] in the church of the living god god is
[1:48:57] here in the tabernacle that he has
[1:48:59] chosen to manifest himself listen he

[1:49:25] god god is not in heaven
[1:49:31] there's been a prophesied presence in
[1:49:33] this age
[1:49:35] i know you don't want to believe it
[1:49:37] because you got problems i know you
[1:49:39] don't want to believe it because they're
[1:49:40] seeing questions but the blood would
[1:49:42] answer the question if you would study
[1:49:44] the blood you would find there's been a
[1:49:46] perfect sacrifice
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:54] this voice from heaven is the mediator
[1:49:57] of another covenant
[1:50:00] isn't it
[1:50:01] it's a new creation but you know it's a
[1:50:03] new covenant too
[1:50:05] now people say all the time so brother
[1:50:07] wayne we're in the new testament not if
[1:50:09] the spirit of god's not in you
[1:50:13] you're in the old testament unless
[1:50:15] you're under the blood of jesus christ
[1:50:17] which is his spirit
[1:50:20] people say well we're we're under grace
[1:50:22] if if christ is not in you you're not
[1:50:24] under that dispensation
[1:50:26] the new covenant is a spirit covenant
[1:50:30] amen
[1:50:32] now i've got a ton of scriptures stacked
[1:50:34] on you
[1:50:34] romans 8 chapter said he that hath not
[1:50:36] the spirit is none of mine
[1:50:39] but if the spirit that raised jesus from
[1:50:41] the dead
[1:50:42] also dwell in you it will quicken your
[1:50:44] mortal body
[1:50:46] come on when is the resurrection then
[1:50:48] it's when you receive the holy ghost he
[1:50:51] resurrected you from a world of dead and
[1:50:53] unbelief and traditions of man into the
[1:50:56] kingdom of god where your eternal life
[1:50:59] is already there and you're just
[1:51:01] recognizing who you are
[1:51:03] [Applause]
[1:51:05] come on that's that's future home
[1:51:09] you never were a garfish to begin with
[1:51:13] he always was a trout
[1:51:17] now the scripture says
[1:51:18] that this is a voice that came from
[1:51:20] heaven of course that's what's talked
[1:51:22] about in hebrews when he said a voice
[1:51:24] that
[1:51:25] shakes the heavens and the earth that's
[1:51:27] what he's talking about in first
[1:51:28] thessalonians 4 the lord himself shall
[1:51:30] descend from heaven with a shout
[1:51:32] and a voice
[1:51:35] it's a voice from heaven bringing
[1:51:38] divine authority
[1:51:41] this message was doing more than making
[1:51:43] you a member of a church
[1:51:45] it was bringing you a divine authority
[1:51:48] it's a divine authority that was being
[1:51:50] given to you what's jesus what's jesus
[1:51:53] teach
[1:51:54] in the book of matthew when the roman
[1:51:56] centurion came to him and had a servant
[1:51:59] remember
[1:52:00] and and he needed healing and he came to
[1:52:02] jesus
[1:52:04] now
[1:52:05] uh when when he when he spoke to jesus
[1:52:08] he wanted he wanted healing and jesus
[1:52:10] said i'll come down to your house
[1:52:13] now just in case somebody don't think i
[1:52:15] got scripture for this i do want to say
[1:52:16] this do you know that brother branham is
[1:52:18] in in arizona and he says this he said
[1:52:20] lord if you were here in your corporal
[1:52:21] body tonight
[1:52:22] he said there'd be no more people in
[1:52:24] this meeting that's here now
[1:52:27] because he knew
[1:52:28] his ministry was the same in every
[1:52:30] aspect except for
[1:52:35] preacher what are you talking about
[1:52:36] we're talking about the token
[1:52:38] the literal life the holy ghost in other
[1:52:41] words the only difference is the very
[1:52:43] corporal body
[1:52:47] it's exactly the same life
[1:52:52] now saying that this this centurion
[1:52:55] caught a revelation of who jesus was
[1:52:58] and he said lord
[1:53:00] you don't need to actually come to my
[1:53:02] house
[1:53:04] just send your word
[1:53:07] it's a preacher what are you saying i'm
[1:53:09] saying that man knew
[1:53:11] that the words that jesus spoke had the
[1:53:14] same power in the absence of his body as
[1:53:18] it did in the presence of his corporate
[1:53:19] body he was saying we don't have to have
[1:53:22] the corporate body to have authority
[1:53:25] we've got to have the word of authority
[1:53:32] we want to look come on church the
[1:53:34] gentiles said you got to come heal the
[1:53:37] people
[1:53:38] you got to come there's healing you've
[1:53:40] got to come with a healing campaign but
[1:53:42] you won't have to come to this church in
[1:53:44] a court perform you send your word
[1:53:49] and they knew that word would have its
[1:53:50] authority
[1:53:52] [Applause]
[1:53:54] said preacher what are you saying i'm
[1:53:55] saying the bible said he went home and
[1:53:57] found that his servant was healed in the
[1:53:59] self-same hour
[1:54:01] now to you that like the study brother
[1:54:03] brahm said that was 11th hour
[1:54:06] that was in the 11th hour when the
[1:54:08] spoken word brought healing to the sick
[1:54:10] and they received the same pay as the
[1:54:13] first hour worker received
[1:54:15] come on church we're in the hour of the
[1:54:18] spoken word
[1:54:19] and it's brought the 11th hour worker
[1:54:22] the same pay the first hour worker had
[1:54:25] we don't have to look back to the book
[1:54:27] of acts to try to figure out how to get
[1:54:29] a move of god god brought the book of
[1:54:31] acts and placed it in our lives and now
[1:54:34] the same spirit that wrote the book of
[1:54:37] acts is writing your life in the gospel
[1:54:40] of jesus christ
[1:54:43] hallelujah
[1:54:44] the book of acts is not an acts of the
[1:54:46] apostles it's the acts of god in the
[1:54:48] apostles and that same god is in the
[1:54:51] same room by the same authority that he
[1:54:54] was in the book of acts
[1:54:59] now this man said i am a man under
[1:55:02] authority
[1:55:04] so i understand authority
[1:55:07] because i have somebody who's over me
[1:55:11] i know what it means to be over someone
[1:55:14] and that when i speak
[1:55:16] it's not the words i'm speaking
[1:55:18] it's the position i hold
[1:55:20] and who's behind me
[1:55:23] that roman knew
[1:55:25] that that man jesus held a position
[1:55:28] somebody was behind
[1:55:30] him he knew when he spoke
[1:55:33] things moved
[1:55:35] he knew when he said something the
[1:55:37] heavens would shake the waters would
[1:55:39] calm the mountains would move the trees
[1:55:42] would shake because the creator was
[1:55:44] behind him listen i want to share
[1:55:47] something with you tonight that same
[1:55:48] authority is in the church of the living
[1:55:50] god
[1:55:52] but it ain't who you are it's the
[1:55:53] position you hold and who is behind you
[1:55:58] the prophet of god said all heaven
[1:56:00] stands behind this word
[1:56:03] brother josh the devil ain't scared of
[1:56:05] you but he's scared of what you
[1:56:07] represent
[1:56:10] we represent a kingdom of people who has
[1:56:12] been birthed under a new creation
[1:56:15] authority and the breath of life has
[1:56:17] been breathed over them and authority
[1:56:20] has been invested in them and they have
[1:56:21] been sent into the world
[1:56:27] now
[1:56:28] this this this this gentile
[1:56:31] was being taught authority
[1:56:36] isn't it amazing
[1:56:38] that you're gentiles
[1:56:41] and what you were taught in this age
[1:56:42] from a prophet
[1:56:44] was the lesson of authority
[1:56:46] that's what he taught you was authority
[1:56:48] he kept trying to tell you you don't
[1:56:50] have power
[1:56:52] you have authority
[1:56:54] the power you have you've been endued by
[1:56:57] the father it's his power
[1:56:59] but you're using it
[1:57:03] see god all power omnipotent right
[1:57:07] so the prophet of god said if there's a
[1:57:08] little bit of god in you all power's in
[1:57:11] you
[1:57:14] but when god stepped in you could have
[1:57:16] all power but not have authority to use
[1:57:19] it
[1:57:21] but in the age we're living in we have
[1:57:24] moved from servitude to adoption
[1:57:28] come on galatians said as long as you're
[1:57:30] a child you're different nothing from a
[1:57:31] servant but when the maturity comes
[1:57:36] theirs comes a separation between the
[1:57:38] servant and the son and the son comes
[1:57:41] into an inheritance and has a checkbook
[1:57:44] authority over his father's home a
[1:57:46] servant will never own the checkbook
[1:57:51] and as long as we were in a pentecostal
[1:57:53] age we were all endued with power but
[1:57:56] nobody had a checkbook but when the
[1:57:58] message of the hour come it separated
[1:58:00] the chicken from the eagle and it
[1:58:02] brought an understanding in this message
[1:58:05] that lifted you from the thoughts of
[1:58:07] servitude from just being a prodigal son
[1:58:10] and saying i'm not even worthy amen i
[1:58:13] want to live like a servant in your
[1:58:14] house but the father said you've never
[1:58:16] been a servant you've always been a son
[1:58:19] and he gave him a ring and he gave him a
[1:58:21] robe and he gave him shoes
[1:58:23] because he always was
[1:58:27] i wish i had the power to say it the way
[1:58:29] i believe it you always was a son
[1:58:34] and there's no devil and there's no
[1:58:36] trial and there's no problem and there's
[1:58:39] no darkness and there's no sin that'll
[1:58:42] ever change
[1:58:45] what god did in eternity
[1:58:48] is eternal and it's out of the reach of
[1:58:51] hell
[1:58:56] said preacher i don't know if you tell
[1:58:57] me the truth brother man said he took a
[1:58:59] picture of you
[1:59:00] and god has that picture in heaven it's
[1:59:03] a perfect picture
[1:59:05] [Applause]
[1:59:06] and the devil can't get that high
[1:59:14] the bible is teaching us
[1:59:16] that he brought us
[1:59:18] an authority in this age
[1:59:22] as a son
[1:59:24] we can use authority
[1:59:27] now the only reason
[1:59:29] the only reason
[1:59:31] that that man asked jesus to speak
[1:59:34] is because he understood who jesus was
[1:59:39] let me ask y'all a question
[1:59:41] why would brother branham
[1:59:43] ask you to speak to a storm
[1:59:46] unless he understood who you were
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:53] he would have never told you to speak
[1:59:56] if he didn't see that you had authority
[1:59:58] to do so
[2:00:05] but what authority
[2:00:07] now
[2:00:08] they didn't they just could not
[2:00:09] understand jesus giving this kind of
[2:00:12] commission
[2:00:14] to these kind of people
[2:00:17] how can you how can you how can you take
[2:00:19] this kind of people
[2:00:22] and put that kind of authority on them
[2:00:26] but what authority do you even do these
[2:00:28] things and say these things
[2:00:30] well i'll tell you what brother
[2:00:32] and this bible tells us
[2:00:34] that
[2:00:35] that on the in the upper room come 120
[2:00:37] of them gathered up there
[2:00:39] and the holy ghost began to fall on them
[2:00:42] listen that may be that may be old news
[2:00:44] to people but let me tell you what i
[2:00:45] believe we could use another axe too
[2:00:53] do you all realize
[2:00:55] what was released in that upper room
[2:00:59] it was not a part of god it was god
[2:01:02] himself
[2:01:05] the bible said cloven tongues of fire
[2:01:10] rested on 120 people as a preacher what
[2:01:13] are you saying i'm saying that fire that
[2:01:15] the pillar fire that was with moses
[2:01:19] come in that room by promise
[2:01:21] and said he would endue those people
[2:01:23] under the promise of the father and that
[2:01:25] pillar of fire that god separated
[2:01:27] himself and stepped into 120 people
[2:01:32] the bible said they were all in one
[2:01:34] accord in one place and the holy ghost
[2:01:36] filled them all
[2:01:38] now you say preacher why you say i'm
[2:01:39] saying that because that upper room
[2:01:41] wasn't important till that happened
[2:01:44] nobody knew anything about the upper
[2:01:46] room and those 120 were not important
[2:01:49] until that event took place
[2:01:52] he said well this is just pawnee and
[2:01:53] this is just a little meeting let me
[2:01:55] tell you something could happen in this
[2:01:56] meeting tonight that they talk about as
[2:01:58] long as there is time
[2:02:02] that was 120 of them people got together
[2:02:05] in one mine and one accord and the
[2:02:07] pillar of fire came into the room and
[2:02:10] filled them with the holy ghost
[2:02:13] the preacher what are you saying i'm
[2:02:15] saying the sun came to the earth and
[2:02:18] gave his authority and power into that
[2:02:20] church in that upper room
[2:02:22] can can i can can i just can i preach a
[2:02:24] little something to you here
[2:02:26] do you all know we have an energy crisis
[2:02:29] in the world right now how many knows
[2:02:30] that energy crisis they would like to
[2:02:33] use nuclear fission
[2:02:35] which is this dividing of atoms i don't
[2:02:37] know what fission is hydrogen bomb if
[2:02:39] they would like to use fission in other
[2:02:40] words they'd like to separate atoms but
[2:02:42] it creates nuclear waste
[2:02:45] they want to use oil but y'all see the
[2:02:47] problem with oil creates waste in the in
[2:02:49] the in the atmospheres amen and it's a
[2:02:51] limited source but everybody agrees that
[2:02:54] the sun puts out enough power
[2:02:58] that they can take a cup of sea water
[2:03:00] and power the earth for a thousand years
[2:03:02] if they can recreate the sun on the
[2:03:05] earth
[2:03:07] so since the 1970s they've had projects
[2:03:09] that they want to take and create a
[2:03:12] miniature sun on the earth and radiate a
[2:03:15] fission power of fusion power upon the
[2:03:17] earth
[2:03:18] a fission separates and fusion brings
[2:03:20] together how many knows what effusion
[2:03:22] actually is
[2:03:23] effusion is when two
[2:03:26] and adam i'm a dumb hillbilly i just
[2:03:29] read science books something
[2:03:31] but you take a you take an atom right
[2:03:33] and it has three levels to it
[2:03:36] and the inside is a nucleus right
[2:03:39] well that you can put atoms together
[2:03:41] and they can they can make a positive
[2:03:43] negative charges it's like you take a
[2:03:45] you take a take a magnet you turn it
[2:03:47] over one way and it attracts
[2:03:49] that's like a fusion it's it's putting
[2:03:51] the atoms together turn them over the
[2:03:53] other way and they're two positives and
[2:03:55] they kind of repel
[2:03:57] but they in the sun
[2:03:59] there's enough power through the gravity
[2:04:02] and there's a heat that breaks down the
[2:04:04] outer shell of the of the of the atom
[2:04:07] and there's a there's a force under that
[2:04:09] heat that pushes them together
[2:04:12] and when them two nucleuses join
[2:04:14] together they call it effusion and when
[2:04:16] that comes together it radiates an
[2:04:18] energy
[2:04:20] now you say preacher why are you saying
[2:04:21] that because to recreate that in the
[2:04:24] late 1970s uh there was some people got
[2:04:26] together and decided that they would use
[2:04:28] light on the earth to do it one of the
[2:04:30] one of the ways to do it and they have
[2:04:32] actually a facility they call the
[2:04:33] ignition facility
[2:04:36] they built a building specifically for
[2:04:38] this point they took the most powerful
[2:04:41] laser they could find
[2:04:43] and they recreated that laser 192 times
[2:04:46] it is took them from the 1970s to build
[2:04:50] a building to build the lasers and to
[2:04:52] create a condition that is conducive to
[2:04:56] firing 192 lasers at the same time
[2:04:59] they're aiming them at a piece of a
[2:05:03] target that's about the size of an
[2:05:04] eraser and if they can get 192 lasers on
[2:05:08] that eraser at the same time they will
[2:05:11] recreate the sun on the earth
[2:05:14] he said preacher what are you saying i'm
[2:05:16] saying for 30 something years the
[2:05:18] smartest minds have used billions of
[2:05:21] dollars to bring a power into the earth
[2:05:24] that is built by a fusion power
[2:05:27] now now you know as well as i know that
[2:05:29] was under 120 of the upper room
[2:05:32] but there's more than 120 in this room
[2:05:37] and every one of you
[2:05:38] are a powerhouse by yourself
[2:05:42] every one of you can run out the devil
[2:05:44] by yourself
[2:05:47] but what if we could unify
[2:05:50] 192 of you here in this building tonight
[2:05:56] you know what they said the problem with
[2:05:58] fusion is is that they're both positive
[2:06:00] charges so so they want to re they will
[2:06:03] actually want to repel each other
[2:06:05] they actually want to repel the human
[2:06:07] natures repel
[2:06:08] you see they're too much alike and it
[2:06:10] kind of repels but there's enough heat
[2:06:13] and enough force that when they finally
[2:06:15] get together
[2:06:16] it releases an anointing that church of
[2:06:19] the living god it's a costly thing
[2:06:22] they're doing they're spending billions
[2:06:24] of dollars to do it because they know it
[2:06:28] will release an energy like nothing else
[2:06:30] will and i know that this pastor has
[2:06:33] spent a lot of money i know you've spent
[2:06:36] a lot of money to get here and it's been
[2:06:38] a great cause but if you could get your
[2:06:40] hearts together tonight and let a unity
[2:06:44] come in the house of god
[2:06:47] the newspapers will write about what
[2:06:50] takes place in these meetings because
[2:06:52] god is still god god is still the god of
[2:06:55] miracles
[2:06:56] he's still healing he's still delivering
[2:06:59] he's still bringing the power of god
[2:07:05] you can get 192 believers focused on one
[2:07:07] thing brother brother wendell you know
[2:07:09] get 190 but there's always that two you
[2:07:12] got to bump them back in line a little
[2:07:14] but they're still lasers it's worth the
[2:07:16] time it's worth the adjustment it's what
[2:07:19] it took them 30 years might take you
[2:07:21] more than 10 years might take you five
[2:07:23] years with one laser but just keep
[2:07:25] adjusting that laser because they are
[2:07:28] valuable every one of you are valuable
[2:07:32] by yourself you're a powerhouse
[2:07:37] but when you begin to get together
[2:07:39] and focus on the word of god every devil
[2:07:42] is defeated every power is broken hell
[2:07:45] has lost its power when the sons of god
[2:07:48] begin to unify
[2:07:52] now you know why the spirit of jealousy
[2:07:54] moves in among preachers
[2:07:57] now you know why that little envy
[2:07:59] analysis and personality conflicts
[2:08:02] happen because the devil would do
[2:08:04] everything he could do
[2:08:05] to keep men of god from finding a focus
[2:08:09] and preaching the power of god until the
[2:08:11] anointing would strike a building
[2:08:14] [Applause]
[2:08:16] i'm preaching to you i can feel i'm
[2:08:18] preaching to you that's why those little
[2:08:20] things start working in a church that's
[2:08:22] why those little issues and problems are
[2:08:25] working it's trying to keep unity out of
[2:08:27] the church of the living god
[2:08:30] but if it's precious it's going to cost
[2:08:32] you something
[2:08:34] it might cost you pride it might cost
[2:08:36] your opinion it might cost your feelings
[2:08:38] but i believe it's worth it
[2:08:41] [Applause]
[2:08:45] 120 of them the holy ghost fell for the
[2:08:48] first time and you know it went around
[2:08:50] the world
[2:08:51] 3 000 people were saved that very day
[2:08:53] but you know brother brown said the
[2:08:55] devil never even got out of bed
[2:08:59] come on
[2:09:00] brother said the devil never even got
[2:09:01] out of bed
[2:09:03] 3 000 people got the holy ghost and the
[2:09:05] devil didn't even get out of bed
[2:09:08] he said but when peter went walking down
[2:09:11] there with one of his buddies and there
[2:09:13] was a lame man next to the gate called
[2:09:15] beautiful and as that man laid there and
[2:09:17] begged for them to arms somebody get me
[2:09:19] home somebody help me and peter looked
[2:09:22] at the man and said listen sir silver
[2:09:25] and gold have a nun

[2:09:29] lifestyle you are but that what i have i
[2:09:33] give unto you in the name of jesus
[2:09:35] christ rise up and walk oh that devil
[2:09:39] shook all of hell see he woke up all the
[2:09:42] devils he woke up everybody authority
[2:09:45] has returned to adam's race
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:50] peter was born like everybody else peter
[2:09:53] had trouble like everybody else
[2:09:57] i don't know if you hear me i think it
[2:09:59] was brother biscuit said one time i bet
[2:10:02] peter wasn't aiming at the ear of that
[2:10:03] man either
[2:10:06] he was just a bad shot he was going to
[2:10:08] cut somebody's melon off brother amen he
[2:10:11] was a high temper amen man but when god
[2:10:14] got a hold of him
[2:10:15] [Applause]
[2:10:19] oh he could say your eyes up and walk in
[2:10:22] the name of jesus christ and the devil
[2:10:24] knew something has changed
[2:10:29] you know what those religious people did
[2:10:31] those religious people got involved and
[2:10:33] took them up there and beat them up
[2:10:37] and didn't even want them to they said
[2:10:39] but what authority did you let this man
[2:10:42] walk
[2:10:43] he said being filled with the holy ghost
[2:10:46] he said i have gave them that authority
[2:10:48] by the name of jesus christ this man
[2:10:51] could rise up and walk
[2:10:53] preacher why would you be on something
[2:10:55] like that tonight because that spirit
[2:10:56] ain't died yet
[2:10:58] that religious spirit is still moving
[2:11:00] around trying to make excuses of why
[2:11:02] when god really does something they try
[2:11:04] to dismiss it as somewhere else it was
[2:11:06] just this it really wasn't that bad it
[2:11:08] really was
[2:11:10] that's the devil he's always been there
[2:11:13] you know it's amazing brother branham he
[2:11:15] preached he preached a message talked a
[2:11:17] lot about a man named john ryan how many
[2:11:19] members john ryan blind guy
[2:11:21] john ryan was sitting in the meetings
[2:11:23] come up here blind man come up in the
[2:11:24] prayer line the man saw a vision
[2:11:26] he looked at the man said john
[2:11:28] he said thus saith the lord you're
[2:11:30] healed
[2:11:33] john left wouldn't sit down
[2:11:35] a little while he comes back in the
[2:11:36] prayer line
[2:11:37] he said brother branham
[2:11:39] i thought you said i was healed
[2:11:41] he said john you said you believe me
[2:11:46] he said but brother branham i can't see
[2:11:49] he said john what has that got to do
[2:11:51] with it
[2:11:52] [Applause]
[2:11:55] now he said i knew right then i had to
[2:11:57] give that boy something to say
[2:11:59] he said so i told him john you go
[2:12:01] testify your healing to everybody you
[2:12:03] see and john left the platform blind the
[2:12:06] only thing that had changed
[2:12:08] was his words
[2:12:12] but because he was a man under authority
[2:12:18] because he recognized the authority of a
[2:12:21] prophet the prophet could change his
[2:12:23] testimony
[2:12:25] he didn't change his side he didn't
[2:12:27] change the way he felt he changed his
[2:12:29] testimony and the authority of vision
[2:12:32] was put in the spoken word before the
[2:12:35] man could see anything he was already
[2:12:38] testifying i'm a healed man
[2:12:44] testified everywhere
[2:12:46] it got to be a big deal
[2:12:48] can you imagine blind man running around
[2:12:50] telling everybody he's healed
[2:12:52] two weeks later he's testifying this
[2:12:54] down in the barber's chair

[2:13:12] cancer can't leave until there's an
[2:13:14] operation

[2:13:50] he said i did it by jesus christ
[2:13:53] he said by jesus christ he said yeah he
[2:13:56] said he was just a teacher he said oh he
[2:13:59] said you believe your prophets would
[2:14:00] tell something wrong
[2:14:02] he said albeit the prophets wouldn't
[2:14:03] tell nothing wrong he said then who was
[2:14:05] isaiah 9 6 talking about
[2:14:08] for his name shall be called emmanuel he
[2:14:11] will be god with us
[2:14:13] he said what what association will
[2:14:14] messiah have to god he said the jew said
[2:14:17] well he will be god
[2:14:18] he said then how did jesus miss it when
[2:14:21] isaiah said he shall be born of a virgin
[2:14:25] and the and the and the boy began to see
[2:14:28] it he said but brother branham if i'd

[2:14:36] young man i'd rather drink the brunch
[2:14:39] water and eat soda crackers and preach
[2:14:41] the truth
[2:14:43] then live in a great big mansion
[2:14:46] let me tell you i stand right where that
[2:14:49] prophet stood
[2:14:55] what authority do you do these things by
[2:14:57] the name of jesus christ the son of god

[2:15:05] big african campaign now these are not
[2:15:07] these are not believers that he's with

[2:15:28] and all of a sudden there's a cross-eyed
[2:15:29] boy starts coming up onto the platform
[2:15:32] and brother bam turns and looks at him
[2:15:34] he's about 10 feet from brother branham
[2:15:36] his eyes come open
[2:15:37] just
[2:15:38] his eyes straighten up
[2:15:40] and when his eyes uncrossed that was a
[2:15:42] man standing next to him took off a run
[2:15:44] and jumped up on the platform and
[2:15:46] grabbed brother branham by the coattail
[2:15:48] somebody said don't touch him right now
[2:15:50] he's under the anointing and and and
[2:15:52] they started moving him away and brother
[2:15:54] man whirled and looked at the guy and he
[2:15:56] says to him he says let the doctor alone
[2:15:59] what does he want
[2:16:00] and the man looked up at brother brown
[2:16:02] said how did you know i was a doctor
[2:16:07] he said let the doctor along the doctor

[2:16:16] eyes
[2:16:18] did did you did you do hypnotism over
[2:16:21] him
[2:16:23] he said well i'm surprised you being a
[2:16:24] doctor thinking hypnotism doesn't cross
[2:16:26] eyes
[2:16:29] he said if that works why ain't you
[2:16:31] practicing it
[2:16:32] [Applause]
[2:16:39] he said doctor what'd you do to him
[2:16:40] brother man said i didn't touch the boy
[2:16:42] he was 10 feet from me when his eyes
[2:16:44] uncrossed he said what did you do to him
[2:16:46] he said i didn't do anything to him
[2:16:49] he said well what happened to him he
[2:16:51] said sir he was ten feet from me when he
[2:16:54] was healing he said in that space he met
[2:16:58] jesus christ the son of god and he
[2:17:01] opened his eyes
[2:17:04] let me tell you jesus christ is not in a
[2:17:07] tomb in jerusalem
[2:17:10] jesus christ is not in a tomb in
[2:17:12] jeffersonville
[2:17:15] jesus christ is alive
[2:17:18] and he's in the church of the living god
[2:17:21] and the miracles that you read about in
[2:17:23] the bible is still happening in the
[2:17:26] church of the living god
[2:17:30] by what authority do you have these
[2:17:32] prayer lines by the authority of mark
[2:17:34] the 16th chapter by what authority do
[2:17:37] you believe god does these because god
[2:17:40] has commissioned this church with
[2:17:41] authority and with power
[2:17:43] [Applause]
[2:17:48] now
[2:17:49] now i know you're sitting here tonight
[2:17:51] people saying well brother wayne i i
[2:17:53] just don't i don't understand because
[2:17:54] y'all keep talking about all this
[2:17:56] authority all this power let me let me
[2:17:59] just say this is it's it's as plain as i
[2:18:01] know how
[2:18:03] the bible said in first peter 2 and 9
[2:18:06] that he hath made us a royal priesthood
[2:18:10] in the book of kings it said it made us
[2:18:13] kings
[2:18:15] and priests unto god
[2:18:18] now you say preacher now by what
[2:18:21] authority
[2:18:22] let me ask you something what is a
[2:18:24] priest
[2:18:26] what is a priest to do
[2:18:29] what does a what what action in the old
[2:18:31] testament a priest had something right a
[2:18:34] priest had the access to the holies of
[2:18:36] holies
[2:18:38] and he could go in behind the veil and
[2:18:40] eat of the hidden manna
[2:18:42] he could offer atonement he would
[2:18:45] deliver the church through the gospel
[2:18:47] trumpet and he could sound the trumpet
[2:18:49] for jubilee he was a priest he could do
[2:18:51] them things but what he did was offer
[2:18:53] sacrifices
[2:18:56] now
[2:18:57] i know the church of the living god has
[2:18:59] got to the place where people's wanting
[2:19:01] to make a morgue out of it i get it
[2:19:04] amen because dead people enjoy quiet
[2:19:07] places
[2:19:16] it's the truth
[2:19:18] you put somebody pumping full of a bomb
[2:19:20] and fluid of some denominational
[2:19:22] theology and they love it quiet
[2:19:26] but you put life in somebody and put
[2:19:28] them in the presence of jesus christ and
[2:19:30] god always created noise wherever he was
[2:19:34] at
[2:19:36] somebody said well it's quiet when god
[2:19:39] comes around liar
[2:19:43] liar
[2:19:44] he said preacher what are you talking
[2:19:46] about amen the prophet of god said god
[2:19:48] created angels and they filled the
[2:19:50] heavens with noise for the last billion
[2:19:53] years
[2:19:54] there's not a quiet moment in the fold
[2:19:56] of god angel said holy holy holy holy
[2:19:59] holy holy holy
[2:20:02] now you say well maybe they're quiet now
[2:20:04] the bible said isaiah saw them isaiah
[2:20:06] the sixth chapter said isaiah saw one of
[2:20:08] them cherubs you know what the bible
[2:20:09] said it said that the voice of one of
[2:20:12] them shook the temple
[2:20:14] the other man said if one voice of one
[2:20:16] angel shook the temple what's it like in
[2:20:18] heaven when there's millions of them at
[2:20:20] the same time
[2:20:21] [Applause]
[2:20:24] i know that's a little shocked but it's
[2:20:26] the truth
[2:20:29] now now
[2:20:31] now you spritz what you told me i'm
[2:20:32] talking about i'm talking about i'm
[2:20:34] talking about priest
[2:20:36] because i'm talking about new creation
[2:20:38] authority
[2:20:40] by what authority do you heal the sick
[2:20:42] jesus christ by what authority is it
[2:20:45] that you worship and praise god the way
[2:20:47] you do
[2:20:49] who gave you the authority to do so the
[2:20:52] bible calls you a priest
[2:20:55] now a priest has a spiritual sacrifice
[2:21:00] is that right you say a sacrifice yes
[2:21:02] that's right sacrifice means you do it
[2:21:04] when you don't feel like it
[2:21:08] it wouldn't be a sacrifice otherwise
[2:21:11] brother man said you say well i'm too
[2:21:13] tired he said the devil's going to take
[2:21:15] you tell you that till he takes you to
[2:21:16] hell
[2:21:17] [Applause]
[2:21:19] that's what he said i'm too tired
[2:21:20] brother wayne i'm too tired amen now
[2:21:23] that's the time that you actually make
[2:21:25] the sacrifice
[2:21:26] amen when you're tired and you don't
[2:21:28] feel well and you're going through
[2:21:30] things and you're troubled and things
[2:21:32] are happening at home and problems are
[2:21:34] everywhere and satan's piling he's
[2:21:36] piling condemnation he's piling things
[2:21:38] on your life to quiet that's when the
[2:21:41] church exercises an authority as a
[2:21:45] priest and makes a sacrifice to god
[2:21:49] the sacrifice is the praise of our lips
[2:21:55] giving glory to god you say you said
[2:21:57] preacher what are you saying i'm saying
[2:21:59] this very clearly it clears i know how
[2:22:00] to say it in the old testament a priest
[2:22:03] was born into the levite order
[2:22:06] is that right he was born of the tribe
[2:22:08] of levi but do you all know that the
[2:22:11] first priests were supposed to be the
[2:22:12] firstborn of the house of israel
[2:22:15] amen and that's why when jesus come he
[2:22:18] was the firstborn
[2:22:20] but according to scripture he come
[2:22:22] through the tribe of judah instead of
[2:22:24] the tribe of levi
[2:22:26] so he was a priest after the order of
[2:22:29] melchizedek not after the order of aaron
[2:22:32] he said preacher what are you saying i'm
[2:22:34] saying this they never had a perfect
[2:22:36] sacrifice
[2:22:37] they never had a perfect priest they
[2:22:40] never had a perfect nothing until
[2:22:42] melchizedek became their priest
[2:22:46] and when melchizedek become the priest
[2:22:48] there's a perfect priest
[2:22:50] when melchizedek become the king there's
[2:22:53] a perfect king that's a perfect one when
[2:22:55] melchizedek does it
[2:22:57] you said preacher what are you saying
[2:22:59] i'm saying there's never been a perfect
[2:23:00] bride
[2:23:02] in the history of the universe there has
[2:23:05] never been a perfect bride
[2:23:07] but in the last days
[2:23:09] melchizedek prophesied to step into the
[2:23:13] order of the bride of jesus christ and
[2:23:16] now there is a perfect bride under the
[2:23:19] order of melchizedek we are a
[2:23:24] a priest under god
[2:23:27] it's a preacher why in the world what
[2:23:28] are you doing i'll tell you what i'm
[2:23:29] doing i'm telling you you've got a right
[2:23:31] to praise god when you don't feel like
[2:23:32] it you got a right to praise god when
[2:23:35] all your trials and all your problems
[2:23:36] and all your situations and everything's
[2:23:38] going wrong you still got a right you
[2:23:41] got a right to throw your hands up and
[2:23:42] worship and praise god not because
[2:23:44] you're worthy but because he's worthy
[2:23:47] there has never been a day in your life
[2:23:49] that jesus christ is not worthy of your
[2:23:52] praise there has never been a moment
[2:23:55] that jesus is not one i know you're no
[2:23:57] good i know you're a dirty rascal but
[2:24:00] jesus christ is worthy
[2:24:04] of all of our praise and all of our
[2:24:06] honor
[2:24:06] [Applause]
[2:24:10] by the way i don't know do you all know
[2:24:11] that david was a king right kings i'm
[2:24:13] talking to you kings david was a king
[2:24:15] but he acted as a priest
[2:24:18] right king priest david got the promise
[2:24:20] of melchizedek but watch david david
[2:24:22] knew how
[2:24:24] david knew how to do it let me let me
[2:24:26] just say this brother kenny amen there
[2:24:28] was nobody in the kingdom failed god
[2:24:30] more than david
[2:24:33] i guarantee you if you take a a a a
[2:24:36] comprehensive study of scripture there
[2:24:38] has never been a failure like david's
[2:24:42] david was the first perfect king
[2:24:44] anointed amen that god chose to become
[2:24:47] king and look what happened to him he
[2:24:49] committed adultery
[2:24:52] he killed one of his own soldiers
[2:24:55] he meant to cover up a baby that was
[2:24:58] being born from an adulterous affair
[2:25:03] now church
[2:25:05] he was a rascal
[2:25:07] you said preacher what point are you
[2:25:08] making here i'm saying that god saw
[2:25:11] david and all of his rascal ways and he
[2:25:14] said he's a man after my heart
[2:25:18] he said how could god say that because
[2:25:20] god was showing you what a king priest
[2:25:23] could do in the middle of all his
[2:25:25] struggles and all of his troubles what
[2:25:27] was it david different than others david
[2:25:29] was quick to repent
[2:25:32] when david got in trouble david was
[2:25:34] quick to repent listen you king priest
[2:25:37] you may get in trouble repent to god and
[2:25:41] let the thing go
[2:25:48] i know i'm getting long but i know i'm
[2:25:49] preaching right now you you got to let
[2:25:51] some things go in your life the bible
[2:25:54] says in psalms 103 it says it like this
[2:25:56] bless the lord oh my soul and all that's
[2:25:58] within me bless his holy name bless the
[2:26:01] lord o my soul and forget not his
[2:26:02] benefits who forgiveth all thy iniquity
[2:26:05] who healeth all thy diseases david was
[2:26:08] saying we're gonna bless god the one
[2:26:10] that can forgive the iniquity the one
[2:26:12] that can take away the problem we're
[2:26:13] gonna worship the god who is able to do
[2:26:16] all of these things and i'm going to do
[2:26:18] it by the authority of almighty god i'm
[2:26:21] going to do it under the blood of jesus
[2:26:24] christ david was teaching us
[2:26:28] how to worship when we didn't feel like
[2:26:30] it
[2:26:32] how to worship when our lives were less
[2:26:35] than better somebody said well i thought
[2:26:37] we had to live a life before we could
[2:26:38] worship listen sometimes amen if you if
[2:26:41] you get that mentality that satan will
[2:26:44] so condemn you and keep you under
[2:26:46] condemnation you're going to live your
[2:26:47] whole life with your head in the sand
[2:26:49] and never ever accept the promise of the
[2:26:52] blood of jesus christ because you're
[2:26:54] looking at your works instead of looking
[2:26:57] at the blood of jesus christ but if you
[2:27:00] would look at the blood and your faith
[2:27:02] would catch the blood deliverance would
[2:27:04] come over your soul
[2:27:12] i'm gonna i'm gonna borrow something
[2:27:13] from my good buddy ron spencer
[2:27:16] the only i love how he said it he said
[2:27:19] the only people that has a has the
[2:27:21] authority to have a quiet church is a
[2:27:23] dead church
[2:27:25] i i thought that was good
[2:27:28] so
[2:27:29] what do you mean psalms psalms 150 says
[2:27:31] it it says you should praise the lord
[2:27:34] you should praise him in his sanctuary
[2:27:37] you should praise him in the firmament
[2:27:38] of his power you should praise him for
[2:27:41] his mighty acts you should praise him
[2:27:43] according to the excellent grace
[2:27:45] you should praise him with the sound of
[2:27:47] the trumpet
[2:27:48] that's right
[2:27:50] you should praise him with a psalm tree
[2:27:52] in the heart you should praise him with
[2:27:54] a timbrel in the dance you should praise
[2:27:56] him with stringed instruments and organs
[2:27:58] maybe i misread that let me read that
[2:28:00] again you should praise him with the
[2:28:02] temporal and with a dance
[2:28:05] i want to ask somebody something can
[2:28:07] somebody help me who took the dance out
[2:28:10] of the church
[2:28:13] what devil took the dance out of the
[2:28:15] church of the living god my bible said
[2:28:18] we ought to praise him
[2:28:20] in the dance
[2:28:22] but that devil has took the dance out of
[2:28:24] the church of the living god
[2:28:27] i think it's time we bring the dance
[2:28:29] back in the church of god
[2:28:34] so preacher i don't feel like dancing
[2:28:35] it's because you ain't doing no drinking
[2:28:38] if you get to drinking some wine you'll
[2:28:40] feel like dancing a little bit you'll
[2:28:42] get stimulated on the revelation of
[2:28:45] almighty god and the dance can come back
[2:28:47] in the church of the living god
[2:28:50] i'm sorry i don't think our children are
[2:28:53] to learn to dance in the hockey talk i
[2:28:55] think if they want to learn to dance you
[2:28:57] ought to bring them to the house of god
[2:28:59] and turn loose and victory into the
[2:29:01] power of god and come back in the church
[2:29:06] i am i'm serious it's time to bring
[2:29:09] worship back to the house of god bring
[2:29:11] the dance back to the house of god
[2:29:16] by what authority do you do these things
[2:29:18] psalms 150 said i ought to praise the
[2:29:21] lord in my dance
[2:29:24] hallelujah
[2:29:27] i think it's time
[2:29:29] i think it's time to lose condemnation
[2:29:31] and let victory return to the house of
[2:29:35] said preacher you're going to you're
[2:29:37] going to cause a workup is it me or is
[2:29:39] it the scripture going to cause it
[2:29:42] how far have you watered down the
[2:29:44] scripture until it ain't caused the
[2:29:45] movement in the church
[2:29:48] how far have you got to water down this
[2:29:51] message before it don't have power in it
[2:29:53] no more but if you preach the message
[2:29:55] with power it'll be received with power
[2:29:58] and this church of the living god is
[2:30:00] ready for the power of the holy ghost
[2:30:07] let me just say it real straight i am
[2:30:09] sick and tired of dead religion
[2:30:11] i am sick of traditions and kingdom
[2:30:13] builders and people that are so scared
[2:30:16] of this message until they cannot let
[2:30:18] the holy ghost loose in the church
[2:30:20] anymore i think it's time to bring the
[2:30:23] dance back i think it's time to bring
[2:30:25] the word back it's time to bring life
[2:30:28] back in the church
[2:30:33] come on church turn loose and let the
[2:30:36] holy ghost feel the church again
[2:30:45] well brother wayne you just don't
[2:30:46] understand
[2:30:48] no i'm afraid i do understand
[2:30:51] i'm afraid that there's a lot of people
[2:30:53] in man-made cages
[2:30:56] and they'd have some liberty but for the
[2:30:58] authority of what some man has said has
[2:31:01] captured them
[2:31:03] listen i read all the time
[2:31:06] i read the prophet all the time you
[2:31:08] can't take two quotes and make ten
[2:31:10] thousand lie
[2:31:14] so preacher what are you saying listen
[2:31:16] you don't remember that house of hell
[2:31:17] they've been preaching about it how's
[2:31:19] the hell give way in the name of jesus
[2:31:21] do y'all know what them people were
[2:31:22] doing in that house
[2:31:24] y'all know why they were in that cave
[2:31:25] with those bars y'all know why the bible
[2:31:28] said the woman was taught or the vision
[2:31:30] said the woman was talking to brother
[2:31:31] branham he said brother random they're
[2:31:32] good people
[2:31:34] they've just misunderstood you
[2:31:37] and people have misunderstood those
[2:31:39] quotes and they have put the church in a
[2:31:42] bondage where they can't worship they
[2:31:44] can't rejoice they can't preach they
[2:31:47] can't shout they can't enjoy god but i
[2:31:50] say house of hell give way in the name
[2:31:53] of jesus christ let the light come back
[2:31:56] let the dance come back let the holy
[2:31:58] ghost come back in the church of the
[2:32:00] living god
[2:32:04] somebody turn on the light
[2:32:08] something is bringing us out of darkness
[2:32:10] into the power of god
[2:32:13] it's a world of darkness come on church
[2:32:16] they put the lights out everywhere you
[2:32:18] well you can't preach no more
[2:32:20] you can't shout no more
[2:32:29] i tell you what two or three times
[2:32:31] brother brown said i'm gonna ride that
[2:32:32] trail again
[2:32:35] okay
[2:32:37] okay
[2:32:39] bring that to me next time and let's
[2:32:40] talk a little while
[2:32:42] let me ask you by what authority did he
[2:32:44] say it
[2:32:46] was that of man or god
[2:32:48] come on now
[2:32:50] was it
[2:32:51] listen to me he said i am the voice of
[2:32:53] god to you
[2:32:55] and god was prophesying through his
[2:32:58] prophet
[2:33:00] and he wasn't talking about brother
[2:33:01] branham
[2:33:02] he was talking about the spirit of jesus
[2:33:05] christ will ride again in the church of
[2:33:08] the living god and here it is tonight
[2:33:13] we're not riding the pale horse we're
[2:33:15] not riding the red horse we're riding
[2:33:17] the white horse and the vindicated word
[2:33:20] of almighty god get on your horse and
[2:33:23] ride let's ride down this devil let's
[2:33:26] ride down this
[2:33:32] this is when kings go to war this is the
[2:33:34] time for kings to pick up their sword
[2:33:37] and fight these devils
[2:33:43] the preacher what are you talking about
[2:33:44] i'm talking about this
[2:33:45] [Applause]
[2:33:47] men have taken this message
[2:33:50] and they've made this about william
[2:33:51] branham
[2:33:54] now i'll tell you what it's one of the
[2:33:56] most it's one of the most disgusting
[2:33:57] things
[2:33:59] that man ever do it to to take the power
[2:34:02] of god out of william branham's message
[2:34:04] making it about the man
[2:34:05] [Applause]
[2:34:08] i said preacher what are you talking
[2:34:09] about
[2:34:10] i want you to listen to a tape called
[2:34:12] bruce serpent sometime it was preached
[2:34:14] in 1960 when william branham said
[2:34:16] they're trying to make me jesus christ
[2:34:18] and i stood still for them to call me a
[2:34:20] prophet he said but if they start
[2:34:21] calling me the lord they have made me an
[2:34:23] antichrist and i'm leaving the field
[2:34:26] don't worship me worship god
[2:34:30] now if you'll take that little portion
[2:34:32] of tape
[2:34:33] and you'll play that portion of tape
[2:34:34] while reading revelations the 19th
[2:34:37] chapter and you start reading where it
[2:34:39] said i bowed to that angel and he made
[2:34:41] me get up
[2:34:43] you'll see that revelations 19 was being
[2:34:46] preached in 1960 in the bruce serpent
[2:34:51] but a bunch of oh god
[2:34:54] a bunch of backslid man worshipers got a
[2:34:57] hold of this message
[2:34:59] and they don't want to turn loose an
[2:35:01] anointed gifted man who discerns lives
[2:35:04] and hearts by the holy ghost preaching
[2:35:06] and preaches against things that are
[2:35:07] wrong and cuts against spirits so they
[2:35:10] move the ministry out and they said well
[2:35:12] we'll just play a tape
[2:35:16] and then they say look amen y'all just
[2:35:18] hold on brother branham's coming back
[2:35:20] and he's got this tent
[2:35:22] and he's gonna set this tent up and
[2:35:24] we're gonna have a real party then amen
[2:35:26] listen to me and the whole time
[2:35:29] the children are going into the world
[2:35:32] the revival is being lost and
[2:35:37] and they're promising
[2:35:38] someday sunday
[2:35:41] sunday
[2:35:42] [Applause]
[2:35:45] preacher why are you on this i'll tell
[2:35:46] you why i'm on this as david cried out
[2:35:49] and he said from the book of psalms my
[2:35:50] god my god why is that forsaken me thy
[2:35:52] bones they stare at me come on they
[2:35:54] looked for david to do that they looked
[2:35:56] for david to be crucified he wasn't
[2:35:57] crucified
[2:36:00] but when
[2:36:03] but it was jesus christ
[2:36:05] prophesying through a voice
[2:36:09] and when he was
[2:36:11] and when it was fulfilled it was a
[2:36:13] greater than david that did it
[2:36:15] [Applause]
[2:36:18] god fulfilled his own word in the flesh
[2:36:21] of jesus christ
[2:36:23] come on church when he prophesied i'll
[2:36:26] do it again he was prophesying a place
[2:36:28] in the bride of jesus christ
[2:36:33] i went too far to turn back now can i
[2:36:35] just say it to you like this in the days
[2:36:36] of elijah in the days of elijah is that

[2:37:15] even elisha didn't anoint jehu he sent
[2:37:18] somebody to do it
[2:37:20] because the commission wasn't about the
[2:37:23] man it was about the voice of authority

[2:40:24] though
[2:40:28] and i'll tell you why they ain't
[2:40:29] preaching against it
[2:40:30] because they're not sure about it
[2:40:34] but if you'd ever get down and study
[2:40:36] what a prophet's teaching
[2:40:38] he's teaching there's a bride ministry
[2:40:43] and there's a greater one than brother
[2:40:44] bran i'm going to fulfill this
[2:40:47] [Music]
[2:40:48] it's the lord jesus christ himself
[2:40:55] can you imagine
[2:40:56] the lord jesus
[2:40:59] made a promise
[2:41:01] that in my name
[2:41:03] shall you cast out devils
[2:41:07] in my name
[2:41:08] shall you heal the sick
[2:41:11] friends
[2:41:14] that's why
[2:41:16] we hold these meetings

[2:41:21] we shout
[2:41:22] and rejoice
[2:41:24] and praise god
[2:41:31] by the way
[2:41:33] i'm afraid y'all's getting out of order
[2:41:36] brother brown said i've seen them scream
[2:41:38] shout jump dance
[2:41:40] stand to the top of their feet and
[2:41:41] scream with all their heart he said i'd
[2:41:42] never seen them out of order

[2:41:49] because they're under authority
[2:41:51] amen
[2:41:54] we're under authority
[2:41:56] kind of musicians come tonight
[2:42:00] it's a new creation
[2:42:02] authority
[2:42:11] do you remember it
[2:42:17] the chief authority
[2:42:23] chief
[2:42:24] authority amen so brother and we saw you
[2:42:28] sitting at the head of the table and you
[2:42:29] spoke differently
[2:42:31] [Music]
[2:42:33] remember that quote remember it
[2:42:35] you spoke differently
[2:42:40] before you were kind of in a question
[2:42:42] this time you spoke as one heaven
[2:42:46] authority
[2:42:48] if you can recognize the authority of a
[2:42:50] prophet
[2:42:54] and you can get under
[2:42:56] him
[2:42:58] you can exercise the authority that he
[2:43:00] gave you
[2:43:04] and that's exactly what we need tonight
[2:43:08] said preacher i'm not able to i'm not
[2:43:09] really able to believe these things get
[2:43:11] under a prophet
[2:43:15] and it'll change
[2:43:24] [Music]
[2:43:26] right now
[2:43:28] i believe i believe there's things
[2:43:29] happening in this room
[2:43:33] i believe william branham the prophet of
[2:43:36] almighty god
[2:43:39] seventh angel
[2:43:40] [Music]
[2:43:41] the ministry of the son of man to
[2:43:43] introduce jesus christ to this age
[2:43:46] i believe he carried the authority
[2:43:49] of almighty god
[2:43:52] and what he said
[2:43:55] we can believe
[2:43:58] if he said
[2:44:01] that every one of you as a believer
[2:44:05] has a right
[2:44:08] and authority over the devil i believe
[2:44:09] that
[2:44:12] somebody said well brother wayne my i'm
[2:44:14] i'm called to preach but i don't have
[2:44:15] the
[2:44:16] i don't have the gift of healing like
[2:44:18] some of your brothers exercise and see
[2:44:20] the
[2:44:20] the authority the miracles and things
[2:44:22] happen in your lives
[2:44:24] brother brown said brother
[2:44:26] he said you may not have the gift of
[2:44:27] healing but if you're called to preach
[2:44:29] the gospel
[2:44:30] you're called to pray for the sick
