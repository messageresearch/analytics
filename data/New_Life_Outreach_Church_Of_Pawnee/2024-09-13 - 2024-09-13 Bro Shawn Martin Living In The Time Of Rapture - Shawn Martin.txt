honor to be here amen uh in PA and with the py church and um you know I know this is the second service but um I'll get my part out of the way tonight and so I just want to say I appreciate the hospitality uh that uh has just been shown to us and uh there's something about uh the py church here they they know how to make a person welcome and uh they also know how to make a person gain weight and uh uh but uh we uh we certainly appreciate brother Wendell sister Fresca and the congregation here and working uh with the vision that brother Wendell has and I just say God bless you uh very much we know what it it takes to uh have a meeting and uh all the laborers I know the pastor can't do it all himself it takes the congregation and people with a vision and so we certainly certainly uh appreciate each and every one I appreciate all you ministers uh just uh uh back in the office and here in brother Wendell just the name all the ministers here I just say God bless you I really counted an honor to stand shoulder toh shoulder with you as we fight the battle amen and um I uh I believe that God's people are the most precious thing on the face of the Earth and God must have thought so too he he gave his own blood for the people and brother brandom said what is greater the blood or the purchase of the blood and he definitely told us it's the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ and I U just so thankful to be a part of you amen and we must keep pressing the battle church amen it's almost over amen we're almost finished amen and um I just love the Lord you love him and I truly believe that God wants to bless his people and if you need the Holy Ghost tonight God wants to give it to you if you need healing God wants to give that to you more than you'll ever want that he he wants to give it to you if you need salvation or whatever you have need of God wants to give it to you tonight and I just wonder if we could just bow our heads unto the Lord and whatever your need is whatever you're facing just ask the Lord to to meet them I certainly can't do it no man can but God certainly can he knows exactly where you're at he knows the need you've got but not only knows them but he knows how to meet them precious father as we stand in your presence tonight with humbled Hearts we can't thank you enough for all that you've done for us Lord you brought us through so many battles you brought us through so many things and we can look back and say it was truly your mercy now father I pray Lord that you would just come and you'd minister to your people tonight help me Lord just to get myself out of the way and Lord that you would just come and speak through these mortal lips Lord and meet every need for only you can do it Lord you know how to do it father no matter how great or how small the need would be May Faith be elevated tonight Lord I pray that when we leave this place this evening we'd know that we' been in your presence father I just love you we thank you for all your blessings upon our life in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen if you have your Bibles we want to turn to first Thessalonians first of all amen the fourth chapter the 16th verse very familiar scripture reading for us as message Believers one that is very important to us amen amen and I want to just say it's good to have my wife here and my children and um we left uh three home they're married now so I guess they couldn't travel with us but uh the lady uh the place that we're staying at the the lady asked us did you bring all your children this time and my wife says no you know we we just brought four she goes oh just brought for did you amen but uh sure love uh my wife my children amen been a great support amen they're home at church amen and um but first Thessalonians the 4th chapter and um the 16th verse for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words aren't you glad you can be comforted by that scripture amen Comfort one another if you'd like to turn with me also to the Book of Psalms the 34th chapter and we just read one verse Psalms 34 and we'll actually let's go to the sixth verse start there this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliverthat this evening I want to if I would title this it would would be living in the time of rapture and um you know there are two major events that are fixing to take place and that's the Rapture and the Great Tribulation and the prophet taught us that we are living at the junction of time and he tells us that this is the seventh Junction and he said the next thing there is is that we're going to a millennium and time will cease at this Junction he says and Eternity will begin for us ain't that right now most people don't like the subject of rapture uh when you begin to talk of the Rapture you you're talking about the end of the world it it it fear begins to uh well it just scares people and they're scared of being left behind and and scared of uh you know the future and all of these things but I will tell you the people of God don't need to be scared uh uh there there's there's no point in being scared God doesn't want us to be scared I I think when we talk about the Rapture it ought to be just something glorious uh uh to us uh because uh the Rapture is for the people of God do you believe that brother brandom said it's a predestinated seed that goes in the Rapture and so what a blessed people we are to be living in the age uh that we're living because see we are the people with whom God is finishing up his plan amen uh there's no need for time to continue when God has fulfilled every his purpose in this time of mortality this this this dimension of time you see we are are the ones that have stood the test we are the ones that that have uh rendered Satan powerless we are the people young and old in between we are the people that have arrived that Satan don't know what to do with and uh uh and and so therefore there is no need for us to stay here in this evil world anymore you see Satan has thrown everything he can at us and yet we're still standing can you say amen I I don't know about you but we've got I've just gone through hell you know and and the things of Satan just putting everything on us but I will tell you this I still got my joy I still got my peace I still got my faith I I I I still I I still got my song I I still have what what God gave me and how true it is the the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away ain't that right amen and so we we've gone through trials and yet we're still here which shows the reality of what we had talked about last night that we have been loosed by his own blood amen we've been loosed from Satan's grip and and this is The Showdown uh uh uh in this age in Satan's Eden when all the Demons of hell has been Unleashed and yet we're still standing it is God's Victory we are his victory which shows that the blood really works can you say Amen it doesn't matter how weak you are it doesn't no matter what the habits you are we've all been made up of different ways some of us are nervous some of us are passionate some of us got this and that but and through every every aspect of life through all peoples of the earth there is a blood that still stands amen and God has showed that no matter what the devil has to offer and no matter what he can put on us and no matter how much he can afflict us some have been Afflicted in their minds some are afflicted in their bodies some are afflicted in whatever but we have been loosed by the blood of Jesus Christ and Satan ain't got no hold upon us anymore amen so hence the Rapture is at hand can you say amen I believe everyone that's going in the Rapture they Overcomers amen amen and God's proved that we're Overcomers because we're still standing in this time of Le osia amen and by God's grace we have been tied to the very thing that is bringing on this Rapture now the prophet said the end time message everybody say the end time message the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is to bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore saith the Lord that's real event in time evangelism can you say Amen if you remember the angel of the Lord told Brother brandham that his ministry would be like unto John the Baptist amen he was in the h at the whole Ohio River and he was he was in there baptizing I believe the 17th person and and the angel of the Lord uh came down and brother Brandon would talk about it he says I was baptizing at 2:00 in the afternoon and right out of a brassy sky where there hadn't been rain for weeks here he come with a Roar and said as John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ you're sent forth with a message to forerun on the second coming of Christ ain't that right now later on in his ministry it was revealed to him that his message was the seventh angel uh uh uh of Revelations uh uh 10 uh7 and so this explains why his his message is so important to those who are predestinated to be a a part of the Rapture amen for brother brandom would say this the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly same seal is to what call the people the bride out of Pentecostal uh out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the atonement everybody say the atonement call us back to the atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us he said see science has Prov D it by pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly we firmly know it can you say Amen we know what this message is about we know amen why God sent us this message we firmly know it see amen and for he has never told us one thing and thus say the Lord but what's been the truth he said did he not say down there at the river as John the Baptist was sent amen so will this message as well now we know brother brandom identified this message that he had as the shout amen of first Thessalonians 4:16 ain't that right amen it's it's tied to the Rapture you see this message of the of the hour that we're believing is the key to the dead amen of of those that have slept went in slept in Christ amen of coming out of the ground it is the key to the changing of our body it is the key to us being caught up to meet the Lord in the air oh my I'm so glad to be part of the message of the hour amen see and brother Brandon would also say that the bridegroom call will come through this amen it's not just the voice of a man that we're listening to it's the voice of our bridegroom amen that is calling us calling us ain't that right amen you see why would God go through great links Amen to uh uh uh to show the supernatural Amen in brother bram's Ministry well it was God vindicating this man and his message to us can you say amen and he was letting us know that no matter how rejected this message is to the world and and no matter how strange it may seem to the world yet God approved of it himself amen I I uh I pre appreciate that you know the picture of brother Brandon with the the pillar of fire over his head and and and you know I I know you know some don't don't believe that the church is a Fitting Place for uh uh uh for that picture and and and these things and and and but you know what uh to me amen I just believe that that God Amen you know brother Ram said we have a greater proof we are more blessed to have that picture amen uh uh than we are to even just see the pillar of fire with our eyes for he said you know he said you could see it but your mind could be playing tricks on you yeah uh that could be a psychology thing he said but the picture is not psychology it's the real thing amen the camera doesn't take psychology it's not there just imagining that it's there it literally took a picture of God Amen having his picture with brother brandom can you say man I know we we like that picture and I thank God for that picture too but that picture is just a painting amen and and brother brandom said that picture is just the closest amen that he saw of Jesus Christ but that's just still a painting amen but the picture of brother Brandon with the pillar of fire that ain't a painting that is a reality that was literally God having his picture taken not that we would worship a man but to let us know that this message is right and if God Can Say Amen to it I can say say Amen to it if God would make his his whole person in this message then we can do the same thing God testifying that this message is Right amen God don't want his bride having questions amen God don't want his people being filled with questions whether this is right and this is right and this I just say Amen to it all if God's a senator a prophet Amen to speak it well you know brother brandham said that when God gets ready to speak to his people sends a prophet aren't you glad for the prophet of Malachi 4 yes sir see amen so he backed it up by the supernatural amen now in the Old Testament God had had a Promised Land prepared for his Promised Land people and and brother brandom would say he had first he had a people that he had made a land for them he had prepared a land for them and now he sent down there a preparation for it for the promised land people and it was only for those who were predestinated to that Promised Land bride day see and how he done it he sent a prophet with a message identified it by a pillar of fire and gave a token that they could rest assure that it was right how many's rest assured that this message is right I I got to say to you I'm not looking for another message I'm not looking for another messenger I don't need another prophet to come and tell me what to do amen I'm assure I'm resting in the fact that God sent a prophet and he Vindicated this man can you say man that's right I'll take his opinion over anybody else's opinion amen see he sent a prophet with the message identified it by a pillar fire gave a token that they could rest assure that it was right that's right it was her consolation and I don't know about you but this message is my consolation I don't know about a lot of things in politics I don't know a lot of things about science I don't know a lot of things about this world but one Prophet Elijah can you say man you see the Vindicated Prophet the pillar of fire the Messiah sign the first and second and third pool the supernatural amen see they are a consolation to us who are predestinated Amen to the promised land amen we're not following a man amen just like uh in 2 Peter 2:16 I believe he declared we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were I Witnesses of his majesty can you say amen amen see so we we find that the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ has been made known to to us amen and we're not following cunningly devised fables amen can you say amen amen God has so Vindicated this message that there should be no question to it amen there should be no doubt to it it well it it's just the truth Amen brother Bram said now you don't have to believe it until God says it's the truth you don't have to believe nothing until God says it's the truth ain't that right you're not obligated to believe it until God says it's the truth amen he said but if it's according to God's word and God backs it up and says it's the truth then it's a sin to disbelieve it can you say Amen you see so we find that God has been preparing us for a Rapture now the word rapture as we know means caught up amen and and brother brandom taught that there's going to be a rapture you know it's it's sad but you know people even even in the message debate whether it's a a literal thing or or what but brother brandham said there's going to be a Rapture in 1965 he said all all Christians believe that there will be a Rapture he says how many in here believe that the Bible teaches there's a will be a Rapture of the church that's exactly right a catching away of the church another place he said see this this Rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride remember the Bible says the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years see this great Rapture if there's not a Rapture friends where are we at if there is no rapture we have every right to be scared of the things that are coming and and the trouble and and and the the plagues that are coming upon this Earth men are going crazy the these days amen and if there's no Rapture amen we've got every right to be fearful and scared and Afraid and all these things he said see what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have but there's going to be a Rapture the Bible says there will be a Rapture and it'll only be for the elected lady the bride in this day that's pulled out the church now after he preached the the the message rapture amen he uh he preached four more sermons amen that he had uh uh uh before he went home to be with the Lord and the next night uh of he had preached the Rapture the next night he preached on things that are to be and he says this now speaking last night on The Rapture he said I want to speak on this subject that I might tie it together with last night's message for there is going to be a rapture we know that see that's in the future to be can you say amen he said now Jesus here speaking he's gone ahead to prepare a place he's gone ahead aren't you glad for that this Rapture is not just a sudden thing uh that's popped up in his mind God already knew that there was going to be a Rapture amen he died that you could go into a Rapture amen he he he broke the powers of Satan Amen on go goth so that you could be sure to go in a rapture yeah he knew he said I go away to prepare a place for you ain't that right so you know going on down and he says this he says now he Jesus when he says when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose I'm going away to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be there also see Jesus therefore is telling his disciples that this life is not ended in death oh because I go and prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there see he was speaking to them that there was a life amen after this life is ended what a consolation that ought to give to us all Amen to know that after this life is over there is a life that we go into oh aren't you glad for that and as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawing on close then it begins to see you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event it's continuing of this same life in another world in another place in another condition ain't that right see so then the next night brother Brandon preached modern events made clear by prophecy he said we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're not living in another age we're not living in the Methodist age we're we're living in another age now we're living on up here to the bride age everybody say bride age it's not a sin to say bride age amen there ain't nothing wrong with believing bride age amen we wouldn't even know there's a bride age if it hadn't been for a prophet amen that Amen to declare it to us he said see we're living up here to the bright age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture you understand why God would send a message your way amen it's not just like a Methodist message it's not just like a Baptist message it's it's not conformed to a Pentecostal me this is a message to get you ready for a Rapture amen God wants to make sure you make it in the Rapture amen see getting it together for a Rapture that's the age everybody say that's the age we're living in [Applause] now so the Rapture isn't a metaphor come on amen just a figure of speech it's a real happening you know brother Brown said what the Rapture is it's a roll call that takes place in heaven amen Jesus said in John 5:2 the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that he shall live amen those that have gone in the way at the grave and they're just a spoonful of Ashes a spoonful of dust uh there's going to be a roll call amen and that oh church that little spoonful of dust and the ashes uh they're going to respond to that roll call amen they went in the grave uh amen waiting for this time uh they were living for this time H oh yes sir amen see in speaking of the Overcomer Jesus said I will confess his name amen before my father and his angels brother Brown said that's at the time of Rapture job 14:14 if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change Come Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou will have a desire to the work of thine hands aren't you glad for that brother Braham said see what is it it's the great Shepherd calling his Sheep by name the creative voice of God calls them forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they had not fallen asleep so the rad call is not just for those that have went into the ground amen but it's a roll call for you and I that are still alive and remaining you don't have to go to be a spoonful of dust Amen to be changed H amen but that's the Glorious thing there is a people on the face of this Earth uh amen that'll never taste death but the quickening power amen when that roll call comes Uh something's going to change on this body and I'm going to answer him uh amen and he's going to have the desire of the work of his hands yes sir see it is the rapture the prophet said it's the great marit supper of the lamb and his bride now another place it says don't get the Rapture amen of the church and the white Throne judgment mixed up because the Rapture of the church there is no judgment aren't you glad for [Applause] that there is no judgment he said the elect goes in the Rapture because they cannot everybody say cannot canot can you put it make a personal I cannot I cannot go amen into the judgment John 5:24 Jesus says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death under life you're living in a sexb born body amen with troubles and trials and heartaches and failures and Hangups but there's already been a decree you cannot pass into judge you've already passed from Death under life We're Not Afraid about a future amen we're just looking we're waiting for our roll call we're waiting for something Uh something's going to change this old fou body he oh I may be in the biggest trial of my life uh but that ain't going to hinder God I may be in the deepest depths of Despair but that's ain't going to change the the power of God when he calls I will answer shall not come shall not come in the condemnation shall not come Church we're not preaching a message of condemnation I'm here to tell you I'm waving a promise over you you shall not come into condemnation no matter what the devil is trying to tell you death has already passed over you amen now you're into life you pass from Death un life so who's going it's the wise virgin everybody say it's the wise virgin the wise virgin the called out the foreordained the elected the redeemed that's who the Rapture is for is the redeemed you see he came to redeem all names written in the Lamb's Book of Life brother Brown would tell us Jesus come to seek and save that which was on that book he bought the book of redemption it was lost and he redeemed us and all names was on that book was redeemed when he redeemed us oh he says as I have said many times you recognize that you Rec oh aren't you glad for that there's something that's caused us to recognize this see that's why you're here this morning that's why you're here tonight right amen why you're coming out of all the organizations and things is because there's something that is pulling you it's time for Rapture church it's time to get out of here and something is pulling you sir you remember the little eaglet in the chicken yard born there Amen in the chicken yard but that's not his origin he come from another place he was identified he's got different different jeans in him amen all he needed to hear was the scream of Mama Eagle come up higher amen now now the scream just just called it was just a normal scream just a scream but the chickens never responded to it but something about that eagle there was something word calling word Jean calling Jean can you say amen amen and the eagle began to identify I'm not to be here in this chicken yard I I'm supposed to be up there and so is that God would send the prophet of Malachi 4 so you could identify that you're not belonging in here you don't belong in Tribulation you don't belong under the wrath of God uh you belong Amen in the Heights Amen in the Rapture in the Rapture Hallelujah that little eaglet he couldn't identify with what's going on on the earth and now I may get on your toes for a moment but we ain't identifying with politics this ain't the time to be wrapped up in politics oh I just hope Trump gets in and I hope this one gets in I hope no don't you identify with there ain't no Miracle Worker amen the prophet said this nation's gone there ain't nothing going he said you can put AB Lincoln in every all the ab Lincoln you want in every County and every office it ain't going to help there's only one thing left for this church it's to Bri of Jesus Christ and I just tell you it don't matter what candidate gets in it's going to be bad why because America can't stand this world can't God sent you a prophet way before this happened amen wa for this time way before this election and he told us amen a nation cannot stand we're at the end of time can you say man it ain't time to get involved in the world uh it's time to lift up your head for your Redemption draw with nigh that eaglet he couldn't identify with what was the Earthly but he began to identify with what was in the heavens amen the church just didn't have that satisfying something the world didn't have that satisfying that he needed that the prophet said but you heard something else that was a scream and you realize that you were born for that now I know they want to pick this message apart and and and all that but I'm telling you I was born for it I was born for this message amen I understand it's a supernatural message and it seemed like I'm way down here and the message is up here but all I can say to you I was born for that I I recognize that I was born to be adopted son of God I was born to be quickened by a spirit I was born for a body change I was born to be an overcomer I was born Amen to soar in the heavenlies I was born for that brother Brown said you're part of it see you fit into it like a glove on a hand now birds of a feather flock together because they have things in common brother Bram says buzzards and doves has nothing in common their diet is different although a dove could be hatched under a buzzard depends on what it was to begin with now in and in that though the dove might have uh to be mothered a while by that by that Buzzard but finally he'll find his mate and that's what the church is doing today for Jesus is the word and he's the bridegroom and the Bride is a part of the groom therefore that word has to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word word that was fulfilled in his day it's the same word same experience same Jesus Christ same Ministry same power same in action can you say amen amen when we say it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever when we talk about the revealing of the son of man we ain't talking about another person we're talking about the same Jesus Christ in a different body but the same God same power same effect same Victory amen the the Devil Couldn't defeat him and the devil can't defeat him now it's the same person in different bodies Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory oh my amen so there's going to be a Rapture now one might think that that that the Rapture is just about getting caught up in Revelation I had a man tell me that's what the Rapture is it's we're getting caught up in Revelation but brother Braham didn't teach that now he did say that the the the Rapture is a revelation to her to the church the bride it's revealed to her the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture see it's a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you ain't that right but the Revelation gives Faith to the bride for a Rapture now now brother Ram would tell us this he said I want you to get built up now in this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour the faith see it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up can you say Amen so the Revelation comes to us and gives faith for the Rapture ain't that right brother Bram said when the Holy Ghost comes and reveals the word and makes it live just exact then it's a revelation to you see this message is not just a teaching it's a revelation and you'll never be able to take that Revelation out for for Upon This Rock I'll build the uh uh what what did he say I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it now how could you stand in this day without a message how could you stand in this day without a faith that was imparted to you amen God showed it God Vindicated and it built such a faith that this is right now the gates of hell is trying to Prevail but it will never Prevail over this church thank God for the message thank God for the message you people wouldn't be where you are without this message this message is what's making us this message is what's making our homes the way it is this message is what's making our church the way it is this message is what's making you moms and you dads and you young people the way it is and the devil don't know what to do with you I say thank God for the message of the hour don't water this message down preach the message we ain't looking for anything else we don't need need anybody to tickle our fancy we just want somebody to preach the message the way a prophet preached [Music] it can you say amen I have to tell you the spirit of Truth has come in this day and has made the word known to us and has made it live just exactly what it said it would do and the Revelation has already struck our hearts do you believe [Applause] it now by this revelation we are fulfilling what Enoch typed Genesis 5:24 and Enoch walked with God not walk with politician not walk with some educator educated idiot now I'm starting to act like my brother amen see amen not not to walk with the science not to walk with the Theologian amen but to walk with God you're called to walk with God you're called to walk with God handin hand with God can you imagine think of that God was so gracious that you could walk handin hand with [Applause] him Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him you see Enoch walked with God by Revelation the Revelation he had received but God showed that there is more to the Rapture than just having a revelation for the prophet said Enoch's whole body was transformed to meet a type on in God and he was taken to heaven without even seeing death can you say Amen so now what brings about this this transformation today well I I'll just say it this way the revealing of the son of man why it is the rising of the Sun the revealing of the son of man is the rising of sun go go listen to the the uh uh it is the rising of the sun go listen to that message and brother BR I'm going tell you what the message is all about it is the quickening power that has come in this day amen that is shining on vagabonds shining on poers shining on Misfits shining on people that ain't worthy but there's something down inside of them and it's changing them it is the rising of the sun and the prophet said he is the Dynamics to the mechanics you may not have the power within you but he's the Dynam Dynamics can you say Amen you may seem helpless a lot of times you look and say God how in the world I'm in this condition and I don't know how I'm going to get there but don't you worry the r sun has risen upon you arise Shine for thy light has come you see he's the quickening power to the predestinated seed and remember the sun has the power to Quicken the seed that was laying dormant in the ground ain't that right now notice brother Bron said but when the earth gets away amen from the Sun then everything starts to Die the winter sets in then it kills the fruit and the leaves die we know that we're facing a fall we know Winter's coming on what is it the Earth the world is getting away from the Sun and everything is dying starting to die we notice the leaves are starting to change we know this this is nature this is all about it ain't that right amen but we don't despair amen because we know the Earth is going to be pulled back again and the sun in its strength is going to bring everything back to life and what seems to be dead and hopeless and just nothing no future for it the sun would tell you different the sun knows amen because it's got power in itself to change amen the situation to bring from Death unto life so brother Braham said God's nature law of nature pulls the Earth around and makes that law of God in nature bring forth an Easter a resurrection see it's beautifully the return of the sun to restore what the winter killed while it was from the Earth God sends the Earth back around the Sun as we're told way back here see the Earth went away from the sun went back out here and now when the earth gets back around the seeds is laying in the ground they're frozen the pop has run out of them and everything is gone but there's a little life preserved and as soon as the sun gets back in position with the Earth again then there is an Easter a restoration of up comes the flowers again up comes everything all that the winter killed the sun restores all that Winter's death kills uh the son of life restores and I just got to tell you the son the S so n has returned uh in this we've got something to shout about you say oh but my children are lost oh but their son has risen again amen the power of Satan the power of sin is going to be broken it's time for Rapture you see if you notice at the time of rapture the cycle of death and Corruption is broken not just for one man but for all people out of every tongue Kindred and Nation those that are predestinated seed so both the dead in Christ who have risen and those who are alive and remain are going to be changed so it's not just a revelation it's a literal changing 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory so the prophet explains it see You' be standing there and feel a change coming on the gray hair go out and the wrinkles Fall Away see be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye see and we shall meet our loved ones first well there's mama oh there's Papa oh there's my child there's my wife there's my husband amen see those that have gone on are going to race first can you say Amen oh Hallelujah he says we're ready and then together with him that we're dead says the scriptures will be caught up in the air to meet the Lord see that's the order of the coming see oh to see that old Daddy of Mine see them old loved ones that's went down in the faith Yonder to meet them see the sweetness of God knowing if we had met him first we'd Wonder well was mama in it was did did Mama finally make it we preached so hard we tried was she is she here is Uncle Joe here his brother here is is so and so here see oh Lord we love you we love you we love you see amen but first see amen we're going to meet one another so there will be no wondering about it we're all here we're all gathered together that's the wisdom of God ain't that nice about your [Applause] Lord that he would take care of your desires first that you would actually know who made it and you'd be gathered with your loved ones before you meet himall and the prophet says now we become part of that before that time comes catching up into the Rapture now we we know that Enoch was the seventh from Adam Prophet said he was the type of the church ages all rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated so now look at it and I hope this all right but the Rapture what is the rapture it's a way of Escape can you say Amen see just before the tribulation sits in the Rapture is going to take place this is why we believe that the finale of The Rapture is going to play take place just any day what's happening in the world is not by accident is the wrath of God approaching amen men are me people are losing their minds amen the devil is having his way with him trouble is in the land that ain't by accident this world is shaking this world is falling this world is crumbling but now we've got a hope there's a Rapture a way of Escape see God always provides a way of Escape for his children do you believe that God provided a way of escaping Noah's day there stood a prophet preaching a message and he provided an ark a way of Escape because trouble was coming can you say amen God provided a way of Escape at the first Exodus uh uh at the time of Passover there stood Moses the prophet with the message providing a token for those who wanted to escape the death that was coming amen today Hallelujah we have had a prophet stand with a message preparing the bride of Christ did you know the prophet said the bride of Christ is the ark for today the body of Christ is the ark get in the body can you say Amen but see what is it God doesn't leave his children to the hands of Destruction God's going to provide a way of Escape that's how much he loves us now if you notice he has given his own blood to us for a protection to where God doesn't even look at you as a sinner when he looks at you he sees his own blood he hears your voice but then he has given us angels in charge over us see God has provided a way of Escape for you and I Genesis 28:10 speaks of a dream that the prophet Jacob had Jacob went out from berseba and went toward Heron and and he lighted upon a certain place and carried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillars and laid down in that place asleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder was set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it now the prophet said see God was showing us that he would provide a way of Escape for his children he gave Jacob a dream of a ladder reaching from he from the Earth to the Heaven and the Prophet said that's our way of Escape it's symbolic of the church rising from Earth to Glory Church we're climbing upward we're marching up to [Music] Zion you see you don't have to stay in the muck and mire you don't have to stay Within These Earthbound rims God ain't going to leave you in this Earthbound mess can you say amen he has provided a way for us to leave this Earthbound sin and and the fil and and and all of these things the Earthly atmospheres and we can leave those things and come up higher into the fellowship with God you see you got to think of who you are you may have been born a sinner but that's not what God predestinated you to be can I tell you what we were predestinated to be we are predestinated to be without spot wrinkle or blemish we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of his dear son God has predestinated his church to the adoption of sons he has predestinated us to have an Incorruptible body he has predestinated us to live with him in that Eternal City we have been predestinated to rule and to reign with him and God has provided a way that we don't have to remain in this Earth real that we can go up going from sinner to Saint can you say Amen provided a way to where we could be transformed amen that word transformed is to change from one thing to another ain't that right so God has called us from the Earthly to the Heavenly amen going from being as the sand of the sea to the stars of the heaven now brother brandom in talking of this lad he says that God needed to establish his L ladder he's got his the ladder hooked up to the throne of God in heaven but he needed something to establish that ladder here on this Earth ain't that right see so he hooked it to the throne of God in heaven amen but on the earth he tried to hook it to the Jewish Nation but found out it didn't work he tried to hook it to Jacob it didn't work he tried to hook it see he couldn't hook it to Abraham who was a Shyer in a backslid and treated his wife the way he did he couldn't hook the ladder to that couldn't hook the ladder to David the adulterer can you say Amen but a prophet in the Old Testament amen cried out that there would be a stone amen that would be the Cornerstone it would be a precious Stone and God would establish that way of Escape upon him that you could be rest assured that you can make it it would be a tried Stone ain't that right if you notice what Jesus said in John 1:51 verily verily I say unto you Hereafter you shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man hello so brother R said it is hooked to the throne of God and to the Heart of Jesus Christ and we're in between the ladder's hooked to the throne of God it established Upon Jesus Christ and we're in between and that's God's way of Escape for you and I he said see God don't want his ladder slipping around he tried to hook a covenant with Adam he broke it he hooked it to a covenant see but God made this Covenant unconditionally and he hooked it into Jesus Christ there it's anchored there's no slipping no sliding there's no way of getting away what is it it's hooked by God above and by the Son of God beneath and what is it it's a pathway it's a traveler's way from Earth to glory and you can't fail [Applause] somebody say I can't fail I think it's about time we tell the devil I can't fail he's had enough of his lies of telling us that we're failures we're going to come short we we ain't going to make it but young people you tell that devil I can't fail God provided a way of escaping this way isn't an iffy way it's a sure way now no notice what a prophet said we're caught we're caught between it with a great host of angels bringing forth ministering Spirits Supernatural gifts and things vindicating we're on our road marching up can you say Amen so see if you're in God's provided way you can't help but bump into Angels come on church not only are you in between but the angels of God are ascending and descending on well the prophet said you're bumping into them what's that feeling that you feel sometimes what's that Joy you feel some what what's that time that you get discouraged but all of a sudden there just something that starts quickening into your soul you're bumping into Angels Hallelujah absolutely come on church abolutely that's right now notice now brother Brown said there's a great company of angels up and down here ascending and descending picking up the weary how many's been weary and yet you're here it wasn't your willpower God provided a way for you and he put angels all there that when you're just weary and you just just feel like you can't make there's an angel there picking you up hey this is a reality friends this thing is a reality how many's ever just thought you ain't going to make it have you ever just thought that and you just think I there ain't no way I can do it and you're still here have you ever just thought why am I here God's got angels and they're there to pick you up when you're weary Hallelujah see picking up the weary and the sick healing their bodies showing visions and mighty signs and wonders see it can't fail it can't slip it can't slide you're safe God said so that settles it forever there is no question of whether you're going to make it or not you're safe I'm here to tell you you're safe I'm preaching promise to you you're safe the prophet picked it up out of the Bible he read it and he said you're safe a theologian might have said something different amen a scientist might have said something different about your life but a prophet stood upon this Earth taking the promises of God looking at God's provided way and showing and seeing how safe it is and saying you're safe Hallelujah is this all right now notice this latter he says is hooked around the heart of God of Heaven hooked around the Son of God down here and we're brought into it through the Son of God we Ascend to him and then what you scared about church what are you scared about I know what it is see we listen to the devil so long we listen to his lies so long that it begins to become normal but you can't identify with them negative voices that come to you you cannot identify with the trials that you're in don't you let them trials don't you let your hangups don't you let your pass don't you let your Hang-Ups and your faults amen identify who you are what are you scared about a prophet is saying this to the church what are you scared come on see our promise is hooked between God and Christ and we're in between them with angels he said he'll give his angels charge over you and the angels of God are encamped around those who fear Him all up and down when we're making this Foundation climbing each day higher and higher each day brings me one round higher and higher as I move up up up up anything happens if I fall along the Road or something happens to me there's a great host of Angels standing there to pick me up and say come on we're marching up to Zion on to that beautiful city there see it can't fail there's no failing in it there's no failing in Christianity there's no failing in this bride just as sure as that Ark floated so is this bride H can you say amen glory glory glory glory he said see there's no failing in it it don't rest upon what I do it rests upon what he did it's already finished somebody say it's already finished it's already finished tell tell turn around tell somebody it's already finished what you scared about it's already finished you don't have to worry it's already finished that's the gospel today it's already finished see the believer once Anchored In Jesus Christ coming through the door back there put on this highway you can't get away he said you can't get anyway but straight up to God with it there's Angels there to take care of you God made a way of this see so we're not alone brother W you're not alone see there's Angels when you're weary there's an angel there to pick you up when you're sick there's an angel there Amen to heal your body amen when you need Deliverance there's an angel there to deliver you when you get all hung up and you just all in a mess there's an angel there amen taking you amen and bringing you out of your troubles can you say amen that's right that's what a prophet said see the angels are here now people don't believe in miracles they don't believe in the super natural they don't believe Amen in in in angels and all that you know what brother brandham said this he said they're taking the church the Commandments the teaching of the Bible and explains it all away therefore you make the Commandments of God without any effect you make the promises of God of no effect see you take the word of God and you explain it all way into some sort of a Creed and then you cry where is the god of the Bible see you've explained him away you took it all away from the people when you tell them the days of Miracles has passed amen there's no such thing as the Holy Ghost there's no such thing as Divine Healing there's no such thing as a visitation of angels there's no such thing as Miracles and when you do that you explain all the supernatural away from the Bible you take God right out of the church when you do it by Tradition now if you take away the supernatural how you going to get a Rapture how you going to have a body change it's preacher you're Pastor even the prophet couldn't bring a body change but one thing you could do is preach a supernatural show the supernatural introduce the supernatural because that's what it's going to take for a Rapture you see this message I'm going to wind it down I hope this all right this message of Malachi 4 is of the supernatural can you say Amen now I believe we're at the top of the ladder amen I just believe that you see Enoch was raptured the prophet said the seventh showing that it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture and there's no doubt everybody say there's no doubt we're in the seventh Church age we all know it it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture see the end time bride will be called out the rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh Church age which we are bearing record of that age now can you say amen that's right see and he says that it's going to take more faith than ever for it has to be a rapturing faith but don't you worry come on the angels of God are here now brother Bram said see they're here with you to Bear you up to comfort you to give you you faith and to move you alone I know I I know that all you preachers have gotten to a place that you just want to quit and you just said I'm just going to quit I'm going to give up I ain't done it and you were just bound and determined on but what you don't know there was Angels pring you am you might have been crying shedding your tears you might have been rejected feeling lonely feeling like what's the use but there was an angel all alone prodding keep moving keep pressing can you say amen I know it's all we've all been through it I know that you parents and and you young people have been through it some time or another where you just Satan's got about got you convinced just to quit throwing in the towel you ain't doing no good you ain't getting anywhere amen you just keep doing this and this and your life's a mess amen and you just want to quit you just want to give up you don't see any value in your own life but all of a sudden there's Angels it's a supernatural world it's a supernatural Rim why there's a Rapture you were predestinated for a Rapture and God ain't going to leave you behind no matter how determined you are to quit there's an angel there that just pring you and you're still standing today you're still rejoicing I don't know how many tears you have cried but you're here by a supernatural Vindicated God see what is it it's the supernatural moving upon the natural now I I want to get to something right fast then I'm going to close the supernatural you remember you you remember when when the children of Israel they they they were dying because of snake bites you know and and they were perishing but God in his great love and mercy amen provided a way of escape and he had his Prophet to raise up put a Brazen serpent upon a pole and to raise that pole up high so that all that could look could live amen that's what the people were commanded to do just look and live well what was so special about that pole it was just natural it was just a Brazen serpent it was just something natural that was made by man but what what it was is the prophet said what made it so special there was a healing angel on that pole there was a healing Angel and all the people had to do was look and live you see there's been angels of healing that have been commissioned by God for us how did the people get healed at the pool of Bethesda it was just natural water but the prophet said there was a healing angel that come upon the waters oh my yes sir see it wasn't the natural that worked the miraculous it was the supernatural the prophet said it was the angel of Mercy it was the angel of healing that moved and dropped upon the waters for the people that were sick can you say amen and the prophet said the people had to get in it in order to get healed not run from it this isn't the time to run from the [Applause] message I don't care how sick you are I don't care how how discouraged you are I don't care how low you feel this isn't the time to run from it don't you let the devil talk you out of this message can you say Amen don't you let some unbeliever tell you that this is half inspired and half not inspired don't you get bothered by the fussing and the fighting of the preachers don't you get bothered by the fussing and the fighting of the people don't you get bothered by the by the intellectual giants that are trying to downplay this message this message is your life it's God's way of Escape for [Applause] you Church it isn't just a man that should stood there and start preaching these Mysteries I I I'll move on I'll show you brother Brown said today even now the Holy Spirit the supernatural power of God is in the Earth moving and showing things and people run from it instead of getting into it the word made flesh the very Vindicated see and Vindicated the very things that he did and promised that we would do is doing the same things now brother Bram said see notice it was the man that sit at the front waiting for the supernatural to move upon the waters that got something from God he believed in the Supernatural and was waiting for it and the minute he saw it moving he pressed to get in now what was it with the prophet of God in this day brother brandom said if you will look not at the man your brother but if you'll look to what I'm speaking about the Lord Jesus his healing Angel is at the platform I'm not God's Gift the angel is God's gift it came out of Heaven I came from the earth he came from Heaven down to in Shroud or to enclothed an Earthly vessel to speak to Earthly people you see see so that you would believe on him not me but upon Him of whom I'm talking about and by doing so God will heal youall see God's gift is the spirit of God that came down in the form of an Angel so it isn't a worship of a man it isn't that we're worshiping an angel we are looking at and believing in what the angel of the Lord has come upon in this last day now we're commanded to do that for Isaiah 45:22 God says look unto me and be ye saved all ye ends of the Earth for I God and there is none else so the prophet said God has sent his angel from glory to manifest to his people the prophetic gift which can only bring Faith up into the level to where you can be healed or accept your healing from Jesus can you say Amen yes sir God didn't send this message for you to dissect it God didn't send this message for preachers to fight about and to put their own intellect into it leave the message alone it don't need to be changed it don't need a facelift it's the very thing that if we could get the people to believe it they can receive their healing can you say Amen brother Bram and speaking of the poor third pool he said this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away can you say Amen so in another place brother Bram said if you don't believe me that I told you the truth you'll never benefit by it you see why Satan is attacking this message you see why he's trying to water it down you see why he's raising up intellectual guys to preach their own thoughts and mix it all [Applause] up getting to where the people don't really don't understand what brother brandham said making a mystery out of something that God made [Music] [Applause] clear can you say Amen this message just a mystery it's the revelation of the mystery all you have to do is believe believe and if you can believe it you'll receive the benefits can you say Amen see this message is where the angel of the Lord is moving for the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always amen hallelujah oh my do you love him isn't he wonderful amen see so notice brother brandom said see they waited at the Sheep gate from month to month for whatever it was for one for that one Supernatural moving but they looked for it they were looking for it and today we've lost that Vision Pentecost we've lost something let's look to Christ Our denominations has spread it tell it's went way out and now we're fighting and trying to get more and bigger churches and higher classes and better educated preachers and things and what have we got we've got away from the very thing that God told us to look at what are we looking at look and live that's what we must do if we expect to live others might laughed at them and and and said that bunch of Holy Rollers down there around that pool why there there why it's nothing it's just but wind the wind comes down and blows that water back there but not to them who were looking it was the angel of Mercy it was the angel of healing and today it's the angel of Mercy that's moving upon the waters moving upon this message do you believe it isn't the Lord wonderful you remember when God showed up to Abraham brother Braham said it was an angel of Mercy that appeared in human flesh and it showed he was an angel of Mercy because when he determined and he told Abraham what he was going to do Sarah laughed at it Sarah laughed in at the face of God and the prophet said God would have slayed her right th but he couldn't do it cuz she's tied to Abraham and God would Overlook her unbelief God overlooked her laughing at him Hallelujah and extended Mercy he remembered his promise over her actions it was an angel of Mercy come on that was standing there and not killed her that's but showed Mercy now Church Hallelujah that same God has come in this AG hallelujah hallelujah what it's been is not just a prophet but it's been an angel of Mercy standing with that Prophet Hallelujah why because before the foundation of the world God determined he was going to have a bride and he knew every one of your names and he wrote it in a Lamb's Book of Life closed that book up until the end time and here we are we've lived our life we've been caught up in Creeds and dogmas and all all of us have our own different Paths of life but God remembered his promise and when it came time he opened the book and he began to call the names in this age cuz he had already promised he was going to have a bride a people come out of the Gentiles for his name's sake can you say amen amen and out of all of our blunders come on now I don't know about you but sometimes we get discouraged and sometimes we doubt and sometimes we look at God and we say we just don't know how it's going to be I know you probably called me but I don't feel like it I'm not going to do it I I just whatever and and and sometimes we may even secretly and and unknowingly just laughed at God as how is it going to really happen but there has been an angel of Mercy in this age that overlooks our troubles that overlooks our doubts that overlooks our our incapabilities that Overlook everything about us and it's extending Mercy in this age and all I can say this message is not a message of law it's not a message of condemnation it is a message of Grace and that angel is here to heal you physically heal you mentally heal you fi uh spiritually and to heal you for a Rapture can you lift your hands unto the Lord if the musicians will come oh do you love him hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah think of the think of the message of this hour amen something that is greater than even you for the prophet said you are the sinless Spotless bride of Jesus Christ me in all my failures hallu but you don't know who's speaking it wasn't a man it was the angel of Mercy moving upon the waters an angel of Mercy enshrouding a prophet and he began to speak through that mortal lip and tell you you was always saved you not saved on any given day you were always saved you were Justified as though you had never did it remember what he said about Justified he said you know if Perry green he said you know you you could take it and and and and and maybe brother Joel you was out drinking and all that and you repented and we hear about it and and all that and and and you know we we we you know we we say well we forgive you you know well that that's fine but that don't mean you're Justified because you've done it you're forgiven you're forgiven thank God for that amen he's forgiven cuz he repented and all that see but that don't mean he's Justified amen see but when Justified is is that maybe I heard that he went and got got got drunk amen and I heard this and so I go to him I said oh brother Joel I I you know what I I I know you shouldn't have got drunk I I know I mean I I kind of figured you know that you might have done that silly as you are no but you know I I want to just let you know I forgive you for getting drunk and and but he he could tell me and say but I never did it I I I didn't get drunk you understand what I'm saying it it's not that he could accept my forgiveness he don't need to ex he's never done it his slate is clean can you say Amen so you're not just Justified I'm not justified in your eyes you're not justified in my eyes where we stand Justified is in his eyes we never done it in the first place so when he says you're the sinless Spotless bride he's not saying that to make you feel good he's saying it because there's nothing held against you you never did it Hallelujah [Music] oh Church you love him and all I can say is thank God for the angel of Mercy can you lift your hands un the Lord and just Love Him worship Him Praise the Lord oh Jes just now Glory
