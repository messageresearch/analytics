bettered and Scar and the auction fell it was hardly worth his while to waste much time on the Old Violin but he held it up with a [Music] smile well it sure ain't much but it's all we got left I guess we ought to sell it to oh now who stop the men on this Old Violin just one more and we'll be through then he cried out one give me $1 who make it two only two who make it three three twice now that's a good price and who's going to be for me raise up your hand now don't wait any longer the auctions about to end who's got for just one more to bid on this own violet well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low from the back of the crowd a grad Man Came forward and picked up the bow he wiped the dust from the Old Violin and he TI up the Stream then he played out a Melo pure and sweet sweeter than the Angels Sing when the music stopped the auction with a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I be for the own violin and he held it up with the bow then he cried out one give me 1,000 who make it two only 2,000 who make it three 3,000 twice you know that's a good price come on who's going to be for me and the people cried out what made the change we don't understand and the auction is St and he said with a smile it was the tou of the Master's Hand now you know there's many a man with his life Out Of Tune about it SC with sin and he auctioned him to a thankless World much like that Old Violin but then the master comes and the foolish crowd they never under understand the worth of a soul and the chain that is run just by one tou of the Master's Hand then he cried out one give me 1,000 who make it two only 2,000 who make it three 3,000 twice you know that's a good price come on who's going to be on me and the people cried out what made the change we don't understand and the auction is stopped and he said with a smile it was the touch of the Master's Hand then he cried out one give me 1,000 who make it two only 2,000 who make it three 3,000 twice you know that's a good price come on who's going to be for me and the people cried out what made the change we all understand and the ction is stopped and he said with a smile it was the T of the Master's [Music] [Applause] Hand amen did you enjoy that I've always liked that song There Is No Worth to that by L no value to it until the master touched it and once the master touched it the value shot up you know I think brother brandom says we're worth what 5 cents he says you know many people spend hundreds of dollars on clothes on hats Ono uh coats but it says really we're only worth 5 cents but the soul is 5,000 worlds I believe he said so once the master gets a hold of our life it goes from 5 cents to 5,000 worlds and I think my that's what made the change in our life w we W not worthy of our own but God came gave us life you know was born in a manger this Christmas season as we're reflecting on the Christ coming and dying for us what an amazing season it is to think

good to see the Smith Clan all back uh tonight and U miss them over the weekend praise the lord we um we're just going to uh speak here this evening for um just a real simple little little thought uh you know you get you get uh started sometimes uh you you get on a thought and you then you don't get it finished up and and uh then you're torn up which way to go and and uh I guess I guess uh there's probably some other preachers around here that that have been there and um so uh I you know I'm just I'm just going to take a a little simple thought uh since this is Christmas we'll just read tonight Isaiah 7 and 14 and see see where the Lord takes us how's that sound amen it says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel let's turn over to the ninth chapter and the sixth verse for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace shall be uh shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your love thank you for all all that you mean to us thank you Lord as as the song that we were just singing we give you all the glory we love you Lord you're worthy of all of our love we're so thankful to belong to you we're so thankful to belong to one another to be a part of this body we love you Lord with all of our heart I'm just asking that you would help us this evening as we Endeavor to minister just ask Lord that you would Minister and uh to uh give me the words and and the ears to hear and give the congregation ears to hear and Faith to believe and father we just thank you for all that you are to us in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I I'm just going to take a thought tonight the Simplicity of God on Earth and [Music] and the Very thought that God would become human amen that's what the story is All About that's what Christmas is God becoming a human being and sometimes we Overlook the real plan the purpose of what God is doing and I I looked at a at a uh as I was back there in the office I when I when I was thinking about the Simplicity of God on Earth i' looked up a quote and I I I want to read this to you and it says You must be reverent with spiritual faith in your heart or God can't do nothing for you the more humbler you get and the less you know about the things of the world the better you are or the better off you are in the sight of God the greatest success I ever had was among people who hardly could read or write but now I'm not trying to support my ignorance or prejudices but I'll say the biggest hindrance that the Gospel of Jesus Christ has ever had has been this modern-day education that's right even in the ministry they've explained everything out of the Bible the blood the days of Miracles the the powers it's all explained out and dear friends don't you know the worldly wisdom is the thing that destroys the world in the Garden of Eden there were two trees and one of them was the tree of life and when man ate from that tree he live forever and the other was the tree of knowledge which was the tree of death which was the tree of sickness he destroyed himself with his gunpowder and his electric lights and his the pull the gases out of the earth wisdom run to and fro knowledge shall increase and they've been they've brought theirself a hydrogen bomb and I don't know what they're going to do automobiles every time a man he God destroys nothing man destroys himself by worldly wisdom the first conflict there ever was in the world was because somebody was seeking after worldly wisdom instead of simple faith in God you say do so and so doesn't believe it that doesn't change the word of God's word a bit remember you're not saved by wisdom you're not saved by education you're saved by faith in Jesus Christ forget about your education be simple in your own Doctrine and I as I as I looked along these lines of the Simplicity of God on Earth the Simplicity that God would come and and and live in a human being the Simplicity that God would want to redeem Mortals humans you and me the simp the the the Simplicity of the thought that God so loved teenagers and God so loved mamas and daddies that that God would create a body and become one of us he would become so one of us that the people did not recognize him when he was here he become so one of us walked among them and they wondered is this not Joseph's son he was so one of us now brother brother bradam would would talk about the the the Eternal sign and and and and and he would say how that this great super sign this this this sign that we just read in the scripture I will give you a sign and he said the sign was told to the Shepherds you will find him in the staple wrapped in swaddling clothes that's the super sign born over a manure pile the stink of the barn with not even clothes to put on him Emmanuel now the devil wants to make things big and bright God wants to keep things humble a superon you'll find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in the manger this will be a sign this will be a super sign when he was on Earth he was so poor how how we could talk about hard times who is this little one it's Jehovah Jehovah God became a man took on our stock crossed himself from God and become man there's the sign was God and become man not rich man but poor man this is the super sign you've asked for a sign said God I'll give you one an everlasting sign a super sign God in flesh God in flesh I I I think about that he says he could have come otherwise as as I've said but a baby why did he become a baby when the first little toothless mouth opened in that Manger uh uh on on the first crib the first Christmas morning in his little manger crib the first little yell that went from his voice that was God crying Jehovah crying a man come from God and was a man ever wit man and come to uh to the world with nothing but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a boy on the street he toiled like a man but yet he was Emmanuel this is the super sign God dwelling in the creation he created the super I it shall be a sign unto you the great oh my we would think when God would come down that surely he would come down as as great Angelic being bright and shiny and and and would open our eyes to let us know but you see he come veiled he was so veiled that no one even recognized who he was now when we talk about the great God King Of Heaven and Earth the great Creator and we say that great Creator became Our Savior could you children under really imagine what it would be like Amen to to to recognize that your friend that you are playing with is Jehovah God that your friend your you you play with you sleep with you you go to school with is Jehovah God living in that body he says he was so poor when he come to Earth he come through a borrowed womb a borrowed womb of a woman he had to borrow a grave to be buried in God a virgin shall conceive without sexual uh interception amen Jehovah borrowed the womb of Mary a woman to perform the duty that he had given an everlasting sign he was so poor amen now I I I I like that he says can you see the real sign it's Jehovah become one of us and as I got to think in here this evening keep your Doctrine simple what's what's what's God doing what does Christmas mean it was God coming in a body to take care of sin take care to to to bridge the gap amen so that he could live in you so that he could live his eternal life through you hallelujah amen I I I I I I think about it when God was going to come when Jesus did come and there he was and and and and we we we know that he was born in the in the stable there in Bethlehem and how the predestinated plan of God always works now she was a child and they had to travel from uh uh from from Nazareth over to Bethlehem and here's you it was such a it was such a a a hardship on her on Mary she didn't feel like being on that donkey and but but yet God had put in the heart of the king to demand everyone to come to pay their taxes because God had already predestinated a little stable God had already predestinated a little place he had already said it would be little Bethlehem that was going to give birth to that child and here she was in the hardship amen it was a hardship on her amen having her labor pains and not feeling good and barely making it over there and saying amen and and and brother Brandon would give the would would would give the illustration as he says he he he looked back at her and noticed that she was awfully quiet and and and Joseph looking and and seeing the Moonlight as it's reflecting off of off of her face and amen and and and and he's are you okay honey and I and she said yeah I I I think so and amen and before you know it she's saying I I'm fixing to have this baby I I've got to have a place and and and when he goes trying to find a room and trying to find a good place for his wife why there was no place that was all part of predestination amen God didn't want his baby born in a nice place God was going his he was going to come down you in a stable in a barn over manure that's where God wanted to be born God didn't want to be born in a in a hospital God didn't want to be born God wanted to be born among the most simple God wanted his first his first breath as a human to be in a simple humble Place sometimes you might think I I I think this way sometimes in my houses that I you know I haven't lived in too many houses since I've been in py but amen I we have preachers come and stay with us and I think oh my oh my house is oh it don't it's not fit for a it's not fit for a holy man of God like this I I I I you know when we have these wonderful preachers where I mean whoever it is I I get a little bit embarrassed for him to come and look at my house or to stay in my bedroom and and and then I go back back to thinking when God come to Earth God God God came and he chose God chose a stap God chose humility God could have come any way he wanted to come God came and chose a humble place oh Hallelujah aren't you glad and I I want to say here today God loves your little humble h too if you'll make him welcome God would rather live in your Humble House than to live in a nice fancy house up here on the hill God would rather live if you would make him welcome in your home why God loves being in your simple place can you say Amen you see God doesn't ask us to keep things simple God asked us to keep things simple because he's simple right he's simple so if we want to please God then we must keep things simple ourselves oh can you say man brother brandham says he promised the same thing in this day I wonder if we I wonder if if we would recognize it the proud and the wise had never received such a thing as that they believed if there was such a thing as the Messiah on Earth it would certainly have to come to their denomination it would be in their group to receive it or it wasn't right now now just think right hard remember the renom say now just think about this because they the world thinks it's got to be in it's got to be in the upper asalon because if he does come he's got to come through our organization he's got to come through our set of rules he's got to come through but when God came you know who God came to first you know who Heaven came came to declare the good news to First yeah he didn't go to Caiaphas the high priest he didn't go to these other men you know who the Angels appeared to he appeared to stinking Shepherds when God appeared he appeared to simple people hallelujah now M you get upset with your boys for not wanting to take baths well God appeared to men that hadn't taken a bath in a couple of days hallelujah amen now now boys take baths amen we we don't want to we don't want you stinking around here but God appeared un stinking smelling Shepherds did you know that the shepherds are they live so much with the sheep that they smell like the Sheep they Bel and smell like sheep Hallelujah they beef and smell like sheep they they they uh uh uh they brother bradam says they even they're around the shepher so much or they're around the Sheep so much that they even laugh like sheep Hallelujah now now watch this he said brother brandom says now the highest Heavens hastening to honor Earth Earth's most humble and unlearned now he's talking about the Shepherds the highest of Heavens come down to make himself known to the lowest of the earth bypassing all between to make himself known to the common herdsman coming to give these common herdsman the greatest message Of All Times amen Hallelujah now brother Josh sent that today and I thought that was really good amen was that the one you sent today amen I I I got a bunch of them here uh that that just just little just little uh deals on the Shepherds and another one he says but God chooses the nobody that's the reason he chose the shepherd shepherds are completely at home with God's lamb in their midst his word made flesh a among them the proud and the wise never receive it it passed them by can you say Amen so God chooses the nobody the simple I I I I I want us to really think here today God is looking for someone that can receive this word in in their hour now while we know that Christmas was was was God on Earth amen we we're living in another Christmas this bride has has has given birth to another anointing it's given birth to the word we are we are flesh made word brother bradam says now that was word made flesh he says but today it's the flesh made word it is you and I becoming more like him and the only way that we can do that is to recognize him when he is here can you say Amen so the message of this day is the same message that it was 2,000 years ago Messiah is on the earth yes sir Messiah is on the earth amen now it was only revealed to a handful of people and their response was praise and adoration and humility brother Rand would say it bypassed all the Nobles of the land it bypassed all of the Nobles and was revealed to the nobodies all the Nobles that were decorated with doctor's Divinity and psychology and highly educations and great Cathedrals and things it was all bypassed and revealed to no bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of the almighty God did it to make known to them the greatest message ever was the mess Messiah is now on Earth what a wisdom could only come from God who knows wisdom but you see the Jews failed to identify that they failed to see that amen a and and and but but I want to say when God is recognized when God is recognized in your midst when you understand that God gives a promise and and and and it's fulfilled and you see the you see when when those Shepherds what made those Shepherds so incredibly Rejoice first of all amen when when the king was born now when a king is born on the Earth they get the finest and the and and the best of singers and they come and they sing because the newborn a a new one is born and they give great honor well this one when they the king was born the Angels did not appear and sing unto the baby in the manger come on they sung to the Shepherds okay they came and sung to the Shepherds now now I want you to I want you to catch this you see Amen brother brother Bram would say you he would he would talk about it if I can if I can find it now praise praise the Lord as I say I've just got a few quotes here to for you for us to look at amen praise the Lord you you you see it was it was it was something amen God coming and showing now as we as as we look here the Shepherds were sung too so here comes the Angels the angels are singing unto these Shepherds then they tell the Shepherds we want you to go to a c certain place we want you to go look at a certain stable and you will find this Christ child living there now brother brandham says now no other no no other person would have followed this they would not have believed it but the Shepherds were told to go to the stable and there they would find the word of God fulfilled brother brandham says when they got there and when they went down the street exactly like the angel told them to get there and they opened the barn door and they look and there is the Christ child laying right there where God had told him he says the word of God fulfilled in their midst created a a created such a a a shouting and a praising and a and a glorifying God because they found the baby exactly where the angel said that he would be can you say Amen oh my now amen uh uh uh brother renam would say notice out praising and glorifying God for what they had seen and heard they heard the Angels Sing for their first time to a human being Angels had never sung to a human being before and look at the choirs how they had stood and TR trained and trained those voices and they' sing at the birth of the Messiah and they were all bypassed and Angels come and sung to the common Sheepman not with clergy clothes on but with Shepherd's clothes on look who got the first message it was incredible can you say amen he says and when they found the baby what a joy it must have been to them because the angel that gave them the message message they found it just exactly the way the angel said it would be just in the place where the angel said it would be what a thing that must have been to them in a Manger why see how at ease these herdsmen were in the stable what what do you think a theologian would have done in there why he would have put a pin over his nose and said get me out of this place see he would have been so out of place he's been he he'd have been in misery but you see it was just at home to the Shepherds God knows where to send his message someone say hallelujah hallelujah he said see just exactly right in this state the Shepherds was in then in their stable was their lamb a Vindicated message that they had heard how beautiful in the presence of the Messiah the V Vindicated word of their message when the Shepherds heard that the Messiah was on Earth and come into His presence right in their own environment and found the message to be true and was Vindicated there how that must have made those men feel to find that God had done this great thing for them Common People common simple people py people simple people amen working at the post office people electrician people and plumber people and carpenters and just simple Tradesmen just simple people people that don't have a lot a whole lot of college education and these days it's probably a good thing you ain't got a college education amen you you would you you'd probably be out there joining the crowd against Israel anyways amen the all of the all of the the simple people did you know the Bible says and the Common People heard him gladly Shepherds I think as preachers we we we feel at ease with the Vindicated lamb I would rather as a man of God I would rather have something that's Vindicated and God coming down to back it up than than to be one that has that that that tries to dot all of the teas and cross uh uh or dot all the eyes and cross all the teas and make everything all come out pretty I would rather the supernatural presence of God to be with me amen than than I would to to to preach in the biggest of churches and uh have the finest and I I I would I would rather be in the Vindicated word than anything else in the world hallelujah how about you Shepherds at the of the home wouldn't you all just rather have the Vindication of God supernaturally upon your home saying I am pleased with this home how about you mamas with your children wouldn't you rather just have the supernatural presence of God in your home saying I I I vindicate I validate I am here to say I approve of the way that you are handling this home oh come on church amen the other guys would not been at home but the lamb was welcome among the Shepherds I want to be that kind not a lot of Education not a lot of not not not a lot of put on just let me have the realities of the prophecy they were there in the midst of Prophecy they found the they found Isaiah 9:6 they found Isaiah 7:14 they found all of these prophecies they them Hallelujah the preachers didn't know it no one knew it God came to those [Music] poor ignorant people and showed them he's laying here this is what we've been looking for hallelujah oh come on church I you know I I I I would I want that kind of approval I think sometimes we we we are seeking too many other kinds of approval we we you know sometimes we're so busy we we get we allow the devil to pull us completely out of the presence of God out of the revealed word for the hour out of his out of his anoint oting Upon Our Lives simply because we want to do something in ourself come on and before you know it we're miserable and and and and and but they could not those men had it all figured out come on Hallelujah but those humble that could hear the voice of God now brother brandom says there was a reason why he could come to the Shepherds because those Shepherds knew a lamb when they seen a lamb amen and when they come and seen the lamb they knew the lamb that this truly was the Lamb of God I oh god oh Hallelujah let that word now now brother brother brandham would say he would say now he said but the Shepherds felt completely at ease in that place with God's lamb and any good shepherd does the same thing when a Good Shepherd over the sheep can see the word of God made plain and Vindicated of what he promised to do the Shepherds right at home I don't care what anyone else says there's God's Pro God promised it and God did it you say the days of Miracles has passed well there's no such thing as the baptism of the spirit there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was all for the apostles but let a true Shepherd of the word preach it in the power of the Resurrection that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Peter said on the day of Pentecost the promises unto you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call whereever he calls the promise and the same blessing is true let a genuine word feeding Shepherd see that Vindicated all the theologians in the world can't take it away from him because he knows God said so and it's happened that's all it's just God's word always his word was made flesh and was dwelling among them and they knew it not can you say Amen now in my thoughts of the Simplicity of God on Earth there were so many things that brother brandham said about about the son of man and how the the last day and how it would bring it would bring deity back to Earth and brother brandom would say things like the the the word becoming one with a Believer and and and he would he would list the he would list the three stages and and and we we we you you would have he he he he list the you know as as we talked the other night you know as the as the wheat plant is is being restored remember the nub and and then there would be some shoots come up and then here here you would come on up and then there would be the the you know the the the stock and and the and and then there would be the shuck that would come up and and and and how beautiful it is to see that because truly we can see that in the scripture here's the blades of GRA here's justification and then the life comes on up through sanctification and then and then this here all dies off it just it just shrivels up and becomes nothing and then as you're coming on up and then you've got the the the the speaking in tongues and the gifts and all of those kinds of things on 1906 six ausa Street and how oh how wonderful it was and and and brother brandham even back in the day was saying now listen in the adoption series if y'all remember he was saying it it don't stop there there's more there's more you got to keep going right he says don't and then before you know it what did they do they begin to denominate and and and it looked like but as they're in 1963 here come the word that was promised to come the lamb somebody say lamb lamb the lamb that was born in Bethlehem is now the lamb coming back taking a bookl are y'all hearing me it's not a baby lamb anymore now it's the lamb taking the book that the baby lamb purchased so now the lamb is coming with the word and the ones that refuse to see the lamb then is the ones that can't see the lamb now and brother brandham was saying oh the tongues and things are wonderful but if you can't see the purpose of the plant then you're going to fail to miss the realities of the word amen right so what did they do they aborted the Shu aborted the seed but that doesn't do away with you and I now yeah the plant goes away this all dies it all just totally dies and there's nothing left but the wheat seeds in the hand of God can you say Amen the wheat now now the life now when we talk about the life that is in that that is in the church we're talking about the very words of Prophecy now living in you now I'm going to just read a few quiet as I say I this is not a prepared sermon whatsoever hallelujah amen but I I want to show you I want to show you a few things that I a couple of quotes here man be you lovey praise the Lord if I can let let me let me look here and find this quote here amen praise the Lord now he would say now Jesus uh in in the trial he says you now he identified himself in the ministry as a man and not the not a son of God but the son of man God is a spirit he revealed himself as the son of man what he claimed to be and they were blinded and could not see it now unto the Gentiles he reveals himself uh now the son son of God which is the Holy Ghost uh but Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom I want this blind prosecutor to see he's a blind interpreter of the word always he takes his organizational ideas and knows no more about it than nothing he does it to deceive because he's a deceiver at the beginning now Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man I want you all to repeat son of man is revealed he says in the days of Sodom was the son of man revealed God revealed in human flesh which was one time called MDC the father mzc at the beginning had no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of life ever who he was he Remains the Same Jesus had father and mother but this man had neither father nor mother he appeared to Abraham in the form of Son of Man Elohim Jehovah the church now has served the term through the church age all seven ages in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus said here to make Malachi 4 and the rest of the scriptures real to you that in the last days just before the coming the world be setting like in Sodom and the son of man uh will reveal himself as the son of man like he did in the days of Sodom amen now to make it clear we have had we have been living under the Holy Ghost anointing all of these time the entire time but in this last day the son of man and again what is what did Brother brandom tell us the son of man is God in flesh the anointing has been upon Wesley had the Holy Ghost upon him right but he was not he was not he was not the seed of the plant Wesley had the anointing upon him the same life amen I didn't look anything like this seed that went into the ground Pentecost had the anointing and it was wonderful but the promise is that there is going to come a people that God's going to Rapture and it will be word or flesh made word it'll be the word dwelling in us now now I Hallelujah now I want you to want you who's going to see it who's going to see it are all the big denominations are the mega church is going to see it is everyone going to see it no they didn't see it then it's only going to be a just a simple group of people can you say amen hallelujah now all right let let me let me find another quote to I've got two quotes that I want to that I I want to for sure get to you praise the Lord amen you love him praise the Lord where oh where is it Hallelujah okay all right so brother brand in the Masterpiece he would say now he would say and and here's going to use it he's going to use the the illustration life was in the husk in the stock in the tassel in the hos in the husk and all gathers in the the seed as I just showed you he said justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Hol and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself amen God's provided way uh a place of worship 65 he says the church will come through sanctification through Luther uh s uh uh justification through Luther sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost through Pentecostals and will'll go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that is when the husband and wife will be the self-same persons God will be manifested into his bright his church till they will both be the same amen wonder do you do you see the beauty of this why don't the world see it they can't but yet the Angels appeared unto Shepherds somebody that felt at home with the lamb I say today I'm so thankful for this great Lamb of God Amen we believe when I I I I just asked you kids a while ago what would y'all think if you were the ones that went to school with Jesus had him over to your house or or or or ate lunch with him or amen but I'm going to say you are going to school with Jesus or you are eating with Jesus Christ and his bride has become one now what are we to expect Jesus done no Miracles uh uh uh when he was a little kid no one no one matter of fact he didn't do any Miracles until he was 30 years old and sometimes we want to look around and and it's so easy just to look at each other as just common people you're not a common person you're Sons and Daughters of God you are you have the very life of God within you amen and I think that's that that's why it's it's it's so important Amen in these last days that that God Amen that we understand what we are who we are and what we are can you say amen I I I I want I want this church to know that you're all powerful I want this church to know amen and the other night when we were uh uh in the presence of the Lord and I told y'all I said now amen I don't know if y'all can feel it out there but that that anointing is so strong uh uh up here at the platform amen and and and and and when little Andrew had come up now little Andrew can be wiry amen he's just as wiry as wiry can be but did you notice that when he walked up as soon as he as he walked up and just stood right there he just started weeping I mean tears flooding down his face what was it it was a little child that's sensitive to the Holy Spirit and that presence now why couldn't why can't a lot of us see it it's because we're too educated come on we're too educated but I want to say it's here and what I want is God let me be that vessel let me let me be the body and everyone that was up here praying I looked up as as we were praying and I I looked up and every person up here that was helping pray they were all weeping what was it it was God Among Us am it was God God are we going to hear testimonies well dear Lord yes I've already heard one m mom mom called me says she felt the presence of the Lord so strongly when she had come up amen and already seeing the work of God in her life already seeing what testimony it's got to you see it's there it's those it's it the the the the the shack are trying to make something happen the bride is not trying to make anything happen we are just saying God here here I am use me Hallelujah can you say that no I I I'm not saying that every you know you know we all grow but but I I I I do know amen uh brother see amen uh let's let's see what we're hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord I I love him here tonight Amen brother brother brandom would say they're they're in 65 just God of this evil age just just before he passed away he says now but in obedience in obedience this little faith woman lives by faith the bride the person here there here off somewhere else some other Church some other denomination whatever it is he says uh believes the word obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she's watching for it she is part of that word and she is watching for her life to manifest that promise Hallelujah she is the body she is that's what the promise is he the the lamb came to pay the price for me so that the power of that lamb could come upon me and we could this body could Unite with the Supernatural once again so we're not trying to dance and trying to work up with Voodoo drums and everything else I mean hey I'm all for shouting and worship and I'm all for dancing Hey listen I that's the kind of guy I am I and and I wish there was a few more of you that did but you don't work it up you can't work it up it's who you are on the inside that's what it is can you say Amen it's that it's that it's it's it's the word being fulfilled in this Christmas season it's the word in the manger of your heart it's living you're not the shack you are that seed of God can you say Amen yes amen man oh I love it he says now he says now Brethren can't you see that I hope you hope that don't go over you now the body which is which is waiting for the which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it and make it alive in other words there's a predestinated seat on the inside of you and the supernatural life of God of this day the son of man Ministry the son of man life are you hearing me now before it was life but it wasn't it wasn't Seed Life it was justification life it was sanctification life it was shock life but it didn't it didn't look like anything that went in the ground but the promise to you and the son of man Ministry is to bring the very thing that happened in the book of Acts to you watch this he says now he says uh the body is waiting which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm it and make it to alive that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way yet she feels it and knows it's going to happen I say that that's where we are right now and I want to say Rapture time is upon us oh come on you you ever get just a little bit miserable on the inside saying what is it it is God saying come on up a little bit higher and you ain't going to find it by a new car a new house you ain't going to find it by amen a new sermon style you ain't going to find it by singing a new song you're going to find it amen as God is calling you up higher into that seed life into greater maturity raising you up in the power of the Holy Ghost and when he raises you up amen you are an obedient Faith woman you're just waiting for that life to be made manifest now now you're not out shopping and you're not out you there's something about this Amen on the inside it driving you into prayer amen God fulfill your life in Me God I know that I am the reason for this season can you say Amen well do you love him now brother Brandon would say he says it's been one of the most amazing things that I have noted along the lines of my Ministry for our lord Jesus is the peculiarity of people the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study so watch the nature of people and the different parts of the Nations and the worlds to where you go you notice that there's a different attitude that people take towards Christ towards his service towards his servants towards worship and one of the things that has been uh that that one type of meeting will uh uh will be just one wonderful in one part of the country where it won't even work where it won't work in the other part of the country I believe mostly to blame or not to blame but mostly is the way the people are taught the church will never live any higher than as Pastor teaches you seldom find that if you got a good sounds gospel teacher you'll usually find the type of that type of church it's just what your pastor leads you the pastors that you feed on can you amen and so amen so as as the ministry we can see how how where where we we we we can see the importance of that job of our job to to to pointing the people to that living Christ not to a not to a window not to a not to an emotion but point the people to Jesus Christ because there is where people are missing it now that doesn't mean that people are going to follow it you know they'll they'll they'll you you can do whichever way you want to but I want to tell you the message is there saying the son of man is here with son of man anointing word made flesh can you say Amen how many wants to be simple in your Doctrine don't let me don't don't don't don't let me just I I I I I don't want to be satisfied at all until I have the blessings of God upon me in my heart in my home in in my church come on now hallelujah amen hallelujah when I was a kid we used to put a whole bunch on music and and uh uh uh we we we we loved it all but one of the greatest things that I I've remember one of the greatest things that that that that when the Lord showed me when coming into this message amen he had showed me that I you know in the in in the dream that God had given me that when I was struggling trying to figure out which way to go and and God showed me took me down a in in a Wilderness Area just Wilderness and which means confusion and all of this music it was like music you know all in a circle and and and and the guitars were broke and the piano was broke and the drums were broke and everything was all messed up and I I'm over there attracted to music thinking hey I can fix this so I'm over trying to get the guitar fix and this then I'm looking at this and and and and there's this man that I thought was my grandfather that had been leading me amen had had some gray hair and a little ball and and so I I in in this Wilderness and I and but and and and and the voice was and the man was saying hey come you got to let it go you got to let it go and I I said okay all right just a minute so I'm over here and and and and the voice said you got to let it go and and and and finally the stern voice said let it alone and I turned around and it wasn't my grandfather at all it was brother brandom and I looked at him and he's looking at me with those piercing eyes and reluctantly I let I I let go of the guitar and I started following him in this in this in in this uh in this in this wooded area and he led me out and and then came across the most beautiful Oasis and others were trying to fish and things and and and and then and and this man says do you want to learn to fish or you want me to teach you to fish and I said well yeah that would be nice you know and and and so you know he he threw something out and and like a box in the water or something and and before you know it there was and he had this rope and and and and these big old fish were coming in and he's pulling it in and and he turned around and looked at me and he says if you'll be sincere and listen to what I tell you you'll Feed My People well when I woke up the tears my pillow was wet I'd been crying as as as I was there and and Dad remembers that that that area of time I was really I was I was I was confused torn up ready to walk away from the ministry and everything else God had brought me to that point and and and when but when it was and and and the beautiful thing was is when I when I I I I I woke up in the in the in uh when he told me that I just started crying as brother Bram was looking at me and then off looked over behind brother brandom a little a little ways off and there was my father and he was crying and we hugged in the in in the dream and then I woke up and I'm crying and this is this is this is this is the honest truth there was a little glow at the end of my bed that that that sat there for what seemed to be forever it just just seemed to be a little bit of a little glow down there that was when that was when I was willing to throw everything else aside and say Lord if you'll teach me amen and I believe and of course I didn't know anything about the message all I had was the adoption series amen and and uh uh but but the Lord was was was doing what what was taking place it was the son of man anointing that would not allow me you see the the anointing the anointing here was sanctification so when the anointing hit or or justification the anointing that HD here just caused it to to be sanctification that was the stop the anointing here caused H H it was the shock caus him to speak in tongues and things of that nature now now now catch this and and and I'm closing I don't know what time it is but brother brandham said now the church this whole time has been under the Son of God Amen yes the Son of God Amen and I should include the Shu up there with it because the Shu 1906 was part of that Son of God he said the Son of God is the Holy Ghost he says it changes right before the coming of the Lord to the son of man through the prophetic Ministry so I was still in the shook I was still in the Pentecostal shock but I was ordained in the seed so the shock had to push me out because there was son of man holy ghost that was pulling me up higher that's right this here was on the flesh this here was was on this here was was wonderful on the flesh but you see this here was the was the son of man where the word coming it was like God saying you're not one of those intellectual guys I've got something predestinated in your heart here's the Word of Life are y'all understanding does that make sense or no amen so so the the the when I say the son of man uh uh brother did I read that to you did I did I read that to you where we have the church age has been under the Son of God the Holy Ghost I read that to youall right amen I I I I think I did hallelujah amen if the musicians would go ahead and come on up yeah the church now has served the term through the church age in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he goes through sanctification or justification sanctification Holy Ghost but he says but Jesus here amen just before the coming that the son of man would be revealed and the son of man you would marry to the word there would be a reality of every promise of the Bible made real to you see some people think that we're trying to make a fourth stage out of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you have to be adopted no we're living in the age of adoption there's three stages to the New Birth justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost sir to receive the Holy Ghost in Luther's day you were Justified to receive the Holy Ghost in Wesley's day you were Sanctified to receive the Holy Ghost in 1906 you spoke with tongues to receive the the Holy Ghost today you will believe this message amen yes sir am there is no other stage when you receive the Holy Ghost you are receiving the message of adoption y y'all understand that there's three stages to the new birth that's what happened on the day of Pentecost that was the new birth but brother bradam remember the the quote that I read to y'all last week God did not replant a new plant the seed and the nub was sticking up remember he did not replant there's four stages to Restoration come on now that's the church that's that's the church life that's this is where we've gone from from from the fifth age sixth age seventh age at the end of this seventh age it's time for Rapture God's quickening that word through a prophet phc Ministry preparing us to go up uh to to to to be caught away are y'all catching that amen and that's why that that that son of man Ministry no one else is going to recognize it that's right no one's going to recognize it only you can recognize it amen you're the ones that the angel has come to that's right you're the ones you're the ones that the angel says go look in the word and see if it's not there that's right go look and see if I'm not fulfilling my word you see what I'm saying so so though we had though though we had the three stages of of justification and sanctify and then we've got uh Holy Ghost baptism this is all as far as the as far as the uh the church this is all in the Son of God that's that's all the that's the that's the Holy Ghost through the church age that's that's that that's all under that but the fourth stage of restoration has to be a prophet Ministry to bring you out of all of this into the finality of what Christ was when he went into the ground right am I making sense or no wonderful Holy Ghost wonderful sanctification wonderful justification but the fourth stage in order to receive the Holy Ghost in Luther's day Justified when you received the Holy Ghost in Wesley's day you were what when you received it 1906 what did you do spoke in tongues Amen to receive the Holy Ghost today you will unequivocally 100% you will believe this message it's the son of man anointing it's that part of the plan what happens to the rest of the plant what happens hallelujah amen it was nice beautiful and green but as this started going up this started dying as as we get going into the shack this starts dying and then as it goes into the seed this starts dying before you know it everything's all dead it looks like it's dead but it's not dead the life is in the grain can you put that back up S skis that we done last week amen the wheat and the wheat and the and the shut amen it it and and then also that other where it's showing the the dead plant everything Harvest so everything they don't Harvest this God doesn't Harvest this that was the church that that was just the Avenue that was the vehicle that was carrying the seed so sanctification that that that original Church Luther didn't look anything like like like the word that went in the ground Wesley had a lot of wonderful things but it didn't look anything like it went in the ground oh this is where it's so deceiving because the shock looked so close that it could deceive the very elect and it looked close it was powerful it was that stage of the pl but when the son of man Ministry came they said nope nope nope what did it do they begin to pull back they couldn't see it they didn't want it but you did because you were predestinated for it amen don't you love him did you find it sister keys so the shack is separated ready to go to be burned now why do we have uh uh there's yeah that's that's that's what it lets it looks yeah right right there see the one on top is the is the shuck or the chaff the one down below is the seed now when it's covering over put it back to the other one s Keys man it looks really close it looks like it's wheat but you see it has to pull away it has to pull away because it was the seed the word seed germ seed of God in your heart you were predestinated for it you predestinated we were predestinated for this day the stable was predestinated Bethlehem was predestinated the Shepherds were predestinated Mary was predestinated Hallelujah you're predestinated for this the prophet was predestinated for it why would you come and see this light why would you see this why is there something crying out in you now the reason why wh why has Pentecost become such just nothing but Devils the scripture says that she would become a the a a a a cage full of every hateful bird and they'd be full of iniquity and full of demons and full of Amen this is what the church becomes when the seed is taken out of it that's why that's why when brother bradam says you're in the bride age you are taken out of the shook you're no longer a part of that plant this whole thing is fixing to be burned this is going in the tribulation you've been pulled out of that you're you're you're the one you're the little you're the little bundle you're you're the little bundle down here on the bottom that is that is going to be taken away amen amen so get in the life now make don't don't let this just be another dogmatic teaching don't let this just be another brother this is very very oh my the Shepherds when they seen them they were happy the Angels come to the ignorant folks to reveal the lamb the Angels the angel of God has appeared in [Music] PA to reveal the lamb oh let let let let him feel welcome in my home let him feel welcome in my heart oh God be welcome in my [Music] thoughts it it it it's not the little stable anymore I'm a stable that's right the word was living in a body in a stable now it's living in this heart make him welcome well I hope this was okay for for for my message here tonight the power of the resurrected Christ Hallelujah I still took over an hour amen but oh getting God just so wonderful to his people I want him to live in me now folks it's so important that we become so at one with him it's so important that we say not my will but thy will be done not my will but thy will be done can you say amen Amen brother brandham says God in these last days is going to draw true hearts from everywhere brought this quote just in case I needed it no matter how much counterfeit and chaff the devil has God will have a church right out of it yeah it'll be a ceiling for sure as I'm standing in this pull Pit and the hour is at hand the cold and formals weaning away the Evangelical and Social Gospel and all these other things are gone yeah the Fantastic side is is going in such radical fanaticism till anybody blind can see it but God is pulling out his church like the little water lily the little the little teeny seed born way down in the bottom of a murky muddy Mucky dirty frog scummy Pond and it winds its way up through the darkness through all the mud and through all the scum becomes the finest thing you ever looked at in the face of with with a Radiance like the sunshine so is the Church of the Living God that was born down in the mud of fanaticism and chaos and she's wound her way through the gme until she's on the top of the thing just waiting for her wings for flight many that shall run to and fro and the peoples but the people that know their God shall do great in uh exploits in that day God's Revelations to his church set still Little Flock positionally stay where you are sister Gertie and sister Angie used to sing here keep holding on don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get uh to get the mystery of God revealed to his church that's what's holding back the coming of Christ now in the great Millennium is that great Supernatural power that lays dormant in that church can you say Amen oh let me just set Steel let me get rid of all unbelief come on now I was born in this nonsense but I don't belong in this nonsense I came out of that of of that Shu I came out of that but that Shu was never me to begin with come on oh that makes me want to shout I came out of it many of us had to come out of that Pentecostal shock even while we were in this message we had a lot of domination uh domineering preachers that that that that had so intermingled the the the the the the word and opinion together but what we're doing today is we're saying God I refuse to accept anything in my heart but Thy word amen that's the reason I I I hope I hope I hope I hope I I I know I'm a leader and a Leader's got to have a strong I you got to have a strong personality but folks my personality ain't going to get you nowhere no personality in of any preacher in this church will get us anywhere come on there's only one way and that is lining ourselves up with the word of the Lord lining ourselves up with this message of the hour we are pulling away from the Shu we are pulling away from that denominational thinking and we are saying Lord let your life live in me well bless the name of the Lord amen I love him I love him I I I I I love him on this Christmas this Christmas season amen Allelujah well there ain't very many of us just a whole bunch of us here tonight but we're important anyways and uh uh I think God likes simple things God God wants to do it and we're all just simple enough to to to say Amen to it praise the Lord God bless you now amen if we just stand to our feet Hallelujah down from his glory ever living story my God and SA saor [Music] came was his name his [Music] name a strange [Music] my [Music] and oh how I love him how I [Music] adore him my breath my son shine my all and all the great creat became my savior in

everything about us brother brandom would tell us that the lamb must be handled with Clean Hands yeah and this is so important as we are dealing [Music] of course in our personal walk we for that lamb that word the realities of God has to be in a pure heart we can't be hypocritical about it we've got to we got to keep sin now number two the way we deal with one another I I can't have I can't keep the presence of God with me and have a against Kaye Kaye can't keep the presence of God in her have ought against her [Music] mama we we can't do that we got to keep the lamb in a holy clean pure [Music] place I think I think there's if there's ever a time to let the genuine life which is the charity the Capstone to rest upon us it's today let that Holy power of God is it a fight you bet you Satan's where he going to fight you at as I've always said he's going to fight you in your love life s he's going to fight you but I want to tell you wounded Hearts God knew wounded Hearts were going to be there so you know what he done that lamb that was born on Christmas day or not on Christmas day but that first Christmas [Music] I hate to even call it that but brother brandham did on my quote so that that that that lamb that [Music] came came not for us to sing Christmas carols but he came to shed his blood for all the wounded hearts and he says he's come to bind up the broken he's come to bind up the wounded now if you believe and recognize that lamb you can go to him and that lamb will wash your heart it'll happen I I still believe today that he that he that he's very much alive identifying him where he is is so important and what I've tried to show you tonight I I've tried to identify where he's at he's not in the Shu he's right here his word living here and as that word is coming into that heart amen there's going to be a lot of you that God's just going to make sure it comes out of you and remember remember if you say oh I could be a better me if there was a if there was a better them well remember just remember the very first person to follow on the human planet was living in Paradise with no sin and they fell yeah so we can't use those excuses uh whoever put that the other day uh had sent something to me you can't blame the uh whatever it was you can't blame the preacher you can't blame mama you can't blame daddy you got to look in the mirror and blame yourself something like that I think I put it on the on on the chat there and and that's true we we we got to look and say God this is a personal relationship with me and you and I want your word to be birthed in me it's the season it's the time this is the time for it this is the time where he's healing all the wounds you love him God bless you tonight we love you remember Sunday we're going to have it's going to be a wonderful day we're going to do uh we're going to have uh the Ser Sunday service and then instead of getting instead of having our our U normal eating like uh cooking I think we're going to get pizzas and so uh so for those who want to contribute to that um we're just going to we're going to order pizzas and have them ready for us and then we're going to eat and then uh and whenever we get through eating we're just going to come right back over over here and have because this is Christmas Eve um that um right so uh anyways so we we we'll do that and then um and that way you you can leave out early uh to go get ready for mons Monday or whatever you don't have to do and um I think a lot are going to be with family we're going to be with family on Saturday and so a

about it and uh I can't wait I can't wait to to see it and U it's just going to be wonderful so so um uh now I think the ladies wanted to do a nicer meal but I I I I sort of made the executive decision and said listen we can just we can all pitch in some money and eat some pizzas and and since it's came this close uh to here and and um uh we we'll just do it that way how many believ that's going to be okay amen now I do think that after after the play they're going to have some snacks and things for the kids and and and we'll probably enjoy it ourselves so that's older ones amen but we're going to have to play and of course it that just it just ain't a day and Les brother Merl is is uh telling us stories and uh so it's going to be a wonderful wonderful day amen praise the Lord father we want to thank you for your love thank you for all that you mean to us thank you for the lamb that lamb that was born in that manger what a day that was those Shepherds would forever be changed but all the lamb has appeared in this day and there's just people are just as ignorant today as they were that day but we're worshiping him we know where that lamb is he was the word made flesh then and he's still the word today oh except he's flesh and me I thank you for it Lord thank you for your grace thank you for your love we just ask Lord that your Holy Spirit would be here in a supernatural way go home with us cleanse our hearts take the double-mindedness away The Valleys of decision Lord oh God bring peace and hearts and joy of the season and glory of the Lord upon your

those that aren't here that are sick tonight inside and mold me everything let your word be born in the manger of my heart was a tiny simple stable all be turn and warn hardly a place for a king to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his mesty so I know if I'll give him control he'll be born in me so let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart well outwardly I'm nothing
