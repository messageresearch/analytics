[11:50] she has started bleeding heavily again.
[11:53] And Sister Carol is taking Sister Thelma
[11:55] to the ER to get her surgical womb

[12:21] able to step away from the busyiness of
[12:23] life for a little while, Lord, just to
[12:25] to worship you and and enter into your
[12:28] presence, Lord.
[12:30] Lord, I pray that you would help to Lord
[12:32] calm our minds, Lord. Calm our spirits,
[12:34] Lord Jesus. Help us to to lay aside the
[12:37] the concerns of of this world, Lord. And

[12:46] able to stop thinking about what we need
[12:50] to do tomorrow or
[12:52] what is this happens or what if that
[12:54] happens, Lord.
[12:56] Lord, may we just come and and and be in

[13:16] truly intercede for our sisters, Lord.
[13:20] Lord, you've seen the the battles that
[13:22] that Sister Denise has had for for so

[13:47] approach in in a way that's light, Lord.
[13:49] We can't treat this as just something
[13:51] that it's a passing prayer and we move
[13:53] on, Lord. But Lord, I pray that you
[13:55] would help us to truly enter in to
[13:57] intercede for our brothers and sisters,
[13:59] Lord. And Lord, just to lift them before

[34:01] You have led me through the fire
[34:06] in the darkest nights. You are close
[34:10] like no other.
[34:14] I've known you as a father.
[34:17] [Music]
[34:18] I've known you as a friend.
[34:22] And I have lived in the goodness
[34:27] of God.
[34:28] [Music]
[34:32] Cuz all my life you have been faithful
[34:36] as the man of God prepares to come out.
[34:39] And all my life you have been so so
[34:44] good.
[34:47] Every breath that I am able
[34:53] I think of the goodness
[34:58] of God.
[35:02] Your goodness is running after. It's
[35:06] running after me.
[35:10] Your goodness is running after. It's
[35:14] running after me.
[35:17] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[35:21] I give you everything.
[35:23] [Music]
[35:26] Your goodness is running after. It's
[35:29] running after me. Sing that again.
[35:34] Your goodness is running after. It's
[35:37] running after me.
[35:41] Your goodness is running after. It's
[35:45] running after me.

[36:21] with every breath that I am able.
[36:31] [Music]
[36:35] Sing that again. Oh my life.
[36:42] [Music]
[36:53] The breath that I am able,
[36:58] I will see
[37:01] of the goodness
[37:03] of God.
[37:09] Oh, he
[37:12] has
[37:14] forgiven
[37:16] me.
[37:19] My sins have been washed
[37:23] from his mealy
[37:27] by the blood of the lamb
[37:32] of Calary.
[37:34] [Music]
[37:36] He
[37:38] has
[37:40] forgi. Can we do verse one now?
[37:44] Oh, I know what it's like
[37:49] to think of things I've done
[37:53] and want to run and hide my head and
[37:57] shame.
[37:59] [Music]
[38:01] I know what it's like
[38:05] to really hurt someone
[38:09] and feel no s of sorrow at their pain.
[38:17] But I know what it's like to have enough
[38:22] of my disgrace.
[38:25] And find because of Jesus blood, my sin
[38:30] can be erased.
[38:33] He
[38:36] has
[38:37] forgiven
[38:40] me.
[38:41] My sins have been washed
[38:45] from his memory
[38:49] by the blood of the lamb
[38:53] of Calary.
[38:55] [Music]
[38:58] He
[39:00] has
[39:02] forgiven
[39:04] me.
[39:08] Lord, we love you here tonight.
[39:11] Want to thank you for your forgiveness.
[39:15] Your mercy, Lord, you shown to each one
[39:17] of us, Lord.
[39:19] Undeserving each one of us was, Father.
[39:24] But you look beyond our our sin and our
[39:27] shame, our mistakes and our failures,
[39:30] Lord,
[39:32] that you forgave each one of us.
[39:35] And I pray here tonight, Father, that we
[39:37] can realize that we are worthy to be
[39:40] here because of the blood that you shed
[39:42] on Calvary.
[39:43] You made us redeemed, Father. And I pray
[39:45] here tonight that we can look beyond the
[39:49] the voices of being unworthy and look
[39:51] beyond the voices of the mistakes that
[39:53] we've made and realize that you've made
[39:55] us worthy, that you've forgiven us here
[39:58] tonight. I'm asking that you'll just
[40:01] bless the reading of your word as our
[40:03] prayer. We love you Lord in our in your
[40:06] name we pray. Amen and amen. Do you love
[40:09] the Lord?
[40:11] Amen. If we can turn to our our
[40:14] scripture here tonight be Matthew 18 and
[40:18] verse 15. This is a lengthy passage of
[40:20] scripture but appreciate all the the
[40:23] specials that were were saying and
[40:26] Amen. Sister Shakana was trying to get
[40:28] out of singing. I told her she's going
[40:30] to have to sing tonight. She got a
[40:32] beautiful voice. Amen.
[40:34] really appreciate them being here with
[40:35] us. I sure hoping you guys would have
[40:38] heard dad preach tonight, but get to get
[40:41] to hear me. Amen.
[40:43] Amen. So, we're going to go all the way
[40:45] to verse 35. So we may just read a few
[40:48] passages of scripture to let you have
[40:50] your seats. But it says, "Moreover, if
[40:52] thy brother shall trespass against thee,
[40:54] and go and tell him his fault between
[40:58] thee and him alone, and if he shall hear
[41:00] thee, thou sh thou hast gave thy
[41:02] brother.
[41:04] But if he will not hear thee, then take
[41:06] with thee one or two more. In the mouth
[41:10] of two or three witnesses, every word
[41:12] may be established."
[41:14] And he and if he shall neglect to hear
[41:17] them, tell it unto the church. But if he
[41:20] neglect to hear the church, let him be
[41:23] unto thee a heathen man and a publican.
[41:26] And verily I say unto you, whatsoever
[41:28] you shall bind on earth shall be bound
[41:30] in heaven, and whatsoever you shall
[41:33] loose on earth shall be loosed in
[41:35] heaven. God bless you. Now you may be
[41:37] seated. As we continue on here in verse
[41:39] 19, so again I say unto you, if two of
[41:43] you shall agree on earth as touching
[41:46] anything that they shall ask, it shall
[41:48] be done for them of my father which is
[41:51] in heaven.
[41:53] And where two or three are gathered
[41:54] together in my name, there am I in the
[41:57] midst of thee of them. Then came Peter
[42:00] to him and said,"Lord, how oft shall my
[42:03] brother sin against me, and I forgive
[42:06] him till seven times?" And Jesus said
[42:09] unto him, I say not unto thee until
[42:12] seven times, but until 70* 7, therefore
[42:17] is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a
[42:20] certain king, which would take account
[42:22] of his servants.
[42:24] And when he had begun to reckon, one was
[42:26] brought unto him which owed him 10,000
[42:29] talents. But for as much as he had not
[42:32] to pay, his lord commanded him to be
[42:34] sold, and his wife and children, and all
[42:37] that he had, and payment to be made. The
[42:41] servant therefore fell down and
[42:43] worshiped him, saying, Lord, have
[42:44] patience with me, and I will pay thee.
[42:48] Then the Lord of that servant was moved
[42:50] with compassion and loosened him and
[42:53] forgave him the debt. But the same
[42:56] servant went out and found one of his
[42:58] fellow servants which owed him a h 100
[43:01] pence. And he laid hands on him and took
[43:04] him by the throat, saying, "Pay it pay
[43:06] me that thou owest." And his fellow
[43:09] servant fell down at his feet and beside
[43:11] him, saying, "Have patience with me, and
[43:14] I will pay thee all." but he would not,
[43:17] but went and cast him into prison till
[43:20] he should pay the debt." And when his
[43:23] fellow servants saw what was done, they
[43:25] were very sorry, and came and told unto
[43:28] their lord all that was done. Then his
[43:30] lord,
[43:32] after that he had called him and and
[43:35] said unto him, "Oh, thou wicked servant,
[43:38] I forgave thee all thy debt, because
[43:40] thou desireest me. Shouldn't thou not
[43:44] thou also have compassion on my fellow
[43:45] servant, even as I had pity on thee? And
[43:49] as Lord was wroth, and delivered him to
[43:52] the tormentors, till he could pay all
[43:55] that was due unto him. So likewise
[43:59] shall my heavenly father do also unto
[44:02] you, if ye from your hearts forgive not
[44:05] every one of his brother their
[44:08] trespasses.
[44:09] If we could also turn to Hebrews
[44:13] 12 and 14. Hebrews 12:14, then we'll get
[44:17] started here tonight. Amen. I appreciate
[44:20] your patience. I know it was a lengthy
[44:22] reading,
[44:24] but Hebrews 12:14
[44:30] says, "Follow peace with all men in a
[44:33] holiness without which no man shall see
[44:36] the Lord, looking diligently lest any
[44:39] man fall fell of the grace of God, lest
[44:43] any root of bitterness springing up
[44:46] trouble you, therefore many be defiled.
[44:51] I want to speak on a little thought that
[44:54] I've been dealing with in my own heart
[44:56] and we may have spoken along these lines
[44:59] three or four years ago, but it's
[45:02] something honestly I believe is a very
[45:04] crucial part of our Christian walk and
[45:06] also it's
[45:07] something that I could have trouble with
[45:10] and I believe we all could be in in this
[45:12] body of humanity and that's forgiveness.
[45:15] Forgiveness. And it can be very
[45:18] difficult to forgive somebody that has
[45:21] wronged you, man. But we all we all want
[45:23] forgiveness, don't we? When we wrong
[45:25] somebody. And we all know forgiveness is
[45:28] is something we want when we have
[45:30] wronged somebody. But why is it so
[45:33] difficult to to to let go of offenses
[45:37] that someone has committed against us?
[45:41] and and many and one of the many flaws
[45:43] of humanity is forgiving and being able
[45:46] to let go and forgive the person that
[45:49] has wronged you. It's it's really it's
[45:52] hard to let go, ain't it? When we get
[45:56] something in our mind about something,
[45:59] an opinion or something we think is is
[46:02] better, it's it's hard to let go of
[46:05] that. When we get our mind stuck on
[46:07] something, it's hard to let go. Imagine
[46:10] now being offended by somebody and we
[46:13] build up something in our mind. We build
[46:16] up walls uh uh in our mind against
[46:18] somebody. It's hard to let go of those
[46:22] thoughts that you have against somebody
[46:24] that has wronged you. And as as humans,
[46:28] when we are wrong, it's it is eye for an
[46:30] eye. It's it's it's tooth for a tooth.
[46:33] That's that is the way humanity is. I
[46:36] have been wronged by an individual. Now
[46:38] I'm going to wrong them back. Ain't that
[46:41] right? And we want to get even. We want
[46:43] to get ahead. And he or or she has done
[46:46] me wrong. So I will never forgive and I
[46:50] will never forget.
[46:53] Ain't that right? And we can look down
[46:55] through the course of history and we can
[46:57] see how feuds have has gotten started.
[47:01] And there have been many feuds
[47:02] throughout history. And most of them has
[47:05] started over something stupid. All
[47:08] right. If you're like me and brother
[47:10] Joe's great great great great
[47:11] greatgrandfather.
[47:15] Your grandfather came to my grandfather
[47:17] and wanted to sell me a cow. Okay. And
[47:20] he says, "This cow will produce many
[47:23] gallons of milk." Like, "Yes, okay. I'm
[47:25] going to do it." Well, we found out this
[47:27] cow was a dud. It didn't give any milk.
[47:30] Well, now my great great great great
[47:31] great great grandfather is mad at your
[47:35] great great great great great great
[47:36] grandfather. See what I'm saying? How
[47:37] stupid it is over a cow. Well, now
[47:40] because I'm mad at him, it's spread it
[47:42] over from generation to generation to
[47:45] generation. Now it's my generation and I
[47:49] have my son and I'm telling him his
[47:52] family sucks.
[47:54] I hate them because of a cow. Well, that
[47:58] is how few have started over something
[48:01] so stupid. By the time it comes to my
[48:04] generation, hundreds of years later, we
[48:06] don't even know why we're fighting.
[48:09] And it could have been something that
[48:11] was avoided if there was forgiveness.
[48:17] But because of it, they let a grudge
[48:19] build and before you know it, they're at
[48:21] war. And and you watch this builtup
[48:24] bitterness. It's and it's passed on from
[48:26] the next generation to the next
[48:27] generation. Bitterness towards a family
[48:31] that can be prevented if there was a
[48:33] little mercy and forgiveness.
[48:37] You look down through history and
[48:39] there's only been a a very few feuds
[48:41] that was ever mended.
[48:44] And if I can say this, forgiveness is
[48:48] not earned, but it's given. Come on.
[48:52] Forgiveness is not earned but it's
[48:54] forgiven. It is a choice that is given
[48:57] from one person to another that hey you
[49:01] wronged me buddy but I am willing to
[49:04] forgive you for what you've done to me.
[49:08] Imagine if we had to earn God's
[49:10] forgiveness.
[49:12] Imagine if each one of us here today had
[49:15] to earn God's forgiveness. There is no
[49:18] way that we can ever earn God's
[49:20] forgiveness. But he chose to forgive
[49:24] humanity for the mistakes that they
[49:26] made. I look at my faults and my
[49:29] failures and my weaknesses and and and
[49:31] my mess ups and I realize that I'm so
[49:34] glad that I didn't have to earn God's
[49:37] forgiveness.
[49:38] Come on, somebody. We didn't have to
[49:41] earn it. But God chose to forgive you
[49:44] over your stupidity. Humanity didn't
[49:47] deserve God's forgiveness. We didn't
[49:50] deserve God's love. Honestly, what we
[49:53] truly deserved was hell. But God see
[49:56] through our humanity and realize that he
[50:00] must forgive us.
[50:02] Amen. And if God can forgive us over
[50:06] this flesh, I mean, come on. Look at
[50:08] every mistake that we've ever made.
[50:10] Yeah. And if God can forgive us over our
[50:16] humanity,
[50:18] why can't we forgive one another?
[50:23] Hello, somebody.
[50:24] Yes, sir. Why can't we forgive one
[50:27] another? Cuz you realize that
[50:31] this church is like a family. I believe
[50:34] that. Do you believe that? And it seems
[50:36] like it's family that can hurt each
[50:38] other the most.
[50:40] Ain't that right?
[50:44] Brother Bram talks about
[50:48] how in the backyard
[50:50] they're always fighting, right? Yeah.
[50:53] But in the front yard, he says, "You
[50:54] better not mess with one of them. You'll
[50:56] get them all." And that's the way our
[50:58] church, I believe, is. We can fight one
[51:01] another. We can bicker with one another.
[51:04] We can have odds against one another.
[51:06] But if you talk about one person in this
[51:08] church,
[51:10] you're going to get the whole church.
[51:13] And sometimes it is hard to forgive
[51:16] family.
[51:19] It's usually family that has done
[51:21] something to you that they're the
[51:23] closest to you. They know who you are.
[51:26] They know what makes you tick.
[51:29] And sometimes we can do things or say
[51:31] things that can hurt one another.
[51:36] But you asked, "Brother Kobe, why
[51:37] forgiveness?"
[51:41] Is this all right here tonight?
[51:44] Just bear with me as I build a thought
[51:47] here. We see in the parable of the last
[51:50] judgment,
[51:52] condemnation fell on the goats that did
[51:54] not show mercy. Right?
[51:57] We begin to see that the kingdom was
[52:00] opened up to the ones that fed the
[52:02] hungry and gave drink to the thirsty and
[52:05] and visited those that were sick and and
[52:08] clothed those that were naked.
[52:11] And of course, this is good and this is
[52:13] great, but is that good enough?
[52:17] Perhaps the Lord should change his
[52:19] prayer and say, "Give us this day our
[52:22] daily bread, and forgive us of our
[52:24] trespasses as we give food to the
[52:27] hungry,
[52:28] and we give drink to the thirsty. Or
[52:31] maybe forgive our trespasses as we visit
[52:35] the sick and imprisoned and and we give
[52:37] comfort to those that suffer."
[52:41] That makes sense, doesn't it?
[52:45] But Jesus is teaching us how to pray. He
[52:48] says, "Forgive our trespasses
[52:51] as we forgive those that trespass
[52:54] against
[52:56] us,
[52:58] that trespass against us. The the ones
[53:01] that wrong you at the grocery store, the
[53:03] ones that pull out in front of you when
[53:05] you're driving down the road, the the
[53:06] the family member that hurt you, the
[53:08] church member that hurt you. If you want
[53:10] God's forgiveness, you must forgive one
[53:13] another.
[53:15] Forgive and you will be forgiven.
[53:18] Withhold forgiveness and the father will
[53:20] do the same. But but why is it so
[53:24] important that we forgive?
[53:26] What difference does it make if I
[53:28] forgive those who hurt me? Yeah. And I I
[53:31] seen this the other day and I thought it
[53:32] was good. Jesus commands us to forgive
[53:35] others because forgiveness, true
[53:39] forgiveness
[53:41] is impossible.
[53:44] You say, "Brother Kobe, what do you mean
[53:45] by that?" If we're trying to forgive in
[53:48] our humanity, there's no way that we can
[53:51] forgive somebody else.
[53:54] Hello, somebody. It takes the grace of
[53:57] God to allow us to look beyond the fault
[54:00] of our brother, especially when we were
[54:03] hurt deeply.
[54:05] It takes the Holy Ghost to look beyond
[54:08] the mistake and beyond the failure and
[54:11] and beyond the hurt and the scars that
[54:13] was given and say, "I truly forgive."
[54:18] Real forgiveness. It's beyond us. And
[54:21] and I'm not talking about someone that
[54:23] cut us off in traffic. And and I'm not
[54:25] talking about someone that didn't
[54:27] appreciate our our hard work. I'm
[54:29] talking about deep and abiding harm.
[54:35] We spoke a little bit on this a few
[54:37] months back on healing for every scar.
[54:39] So if you hear a little bit, just
[54:41] forgive me there. But it says, "How how
[54:44] how do I forgive someone
[54:46] that has said something to scar me so
[54:49] deeply? And how do I forgive someone
[54:51] that has betrayed me? How do I forgive
[54:55] someone that laughs and and spits on me?
[54:57] How how do I forgive cruelty? And how do
[55:00] I forgive the unforgivable?
[55:06] The answer is without the Lord, you
[55:08] can't.
[55:11] The answer is without the Holy Ghost
[55:14] deep inside, you can't forgive.
[55:18] There's no way that you can forgive.
[55:22] I'm so glad that God not only forgave,
[55:24] but he can forget as well.
[55:27] I'm so glad that God doesn't hold it to
[55:29] my account everything that I've done and
[55:33] all the mistakes that I've made and the
[55:34] pain that I've caused. I'm so glad that
[55:37] God can forgive and forget. And that's
[55:39] my prayer is Lord, not only allow me to
[55:42] forgive, but let me forget.
[55:45] Because we like to hold on to things. We
[55:47] we like to go back to those things in
[55:50] our dark times.
[55:53] You say, "Brother Kobe, it's it's too
[55:55] hard to forgive."
[55:58] It it's
[56:03] you realize when you don't forgive,
[56:05] you're giving power to the enemy.
[56:09] All right? You realize when you don't
[56:10] let go of something, you're giving more
[56:12] power to that thing. Come on. You say,
[56:15] "Brother Kobe, I I feel powerless." What
[56:18] are you keeping in your life? There may
[56:20] be something in your life, a scar or a
[56:22] wound or or something that you have not
[56:24] let go that's preventing you from moving
[56:27] on with God. Because if you let that
[56:30] thing grow in your life, what's going to
[56:32] happen? It will suffocate you. That's
[56:35] true. It will squeeze the life out of
[56:38] you. It's all you think about. It's all
[56:40] you breathe. It's all you live about.
[56:44] It will consume your thoughts. But if
[56:46] you allow God to let go and say, "Lord,
[56:50] I need your help." It's only God. He's
[56:53] the only one that can take it out of
[56:56] your life. He's the only one that can
[56:58] clean your thoughts. He's the only one
[57:00] that can clean your mind. He's the only
[57:02] one that can give you a heart. Amen.
[57:06] That's not broken.
[57:08] That's not hurting.
[57:11] Absolutely.
[57:16] Hope this is okay here tonight. I'm
[57:17] going to skip some of this here.
[57:23] Do you love him here tonight?
[57:27] Amen.
[57:30] So glad we have a God that's that is
[57:32] touched by the feeling of our
[57:34] infirmities.
[57:36] He knows what weakness is.
[57:40] He knows what temptation is. I know this
[57:42] is simple. He knows what struggle is.
[57:45] I'm so glad that God came down and dwelt
[57:48] here as a man.
[57:50] So there there's there's nothing that
[57:52] takes God by surprise. He lived it. He
[57:55] went through the struggle. He went
[57:57] through the hatred. He went through the
[57:59] things in life. He went through the deep
[58:01] scars. You say, "Brother Kobe, no one
[58:03] understands." God does. Yes, he does.
[58:05] You say, "Brother Kobe, I I just can't
[58:07] find a friend that can re that I can
[58:09] relate to." God can relate to you. He's
[58:13] been through that and still at the very
[58:15] end on the cross, he said, "Father,
[58:18] forgive
[58:19] them." Amen. Not not cause curses upon
[58:23] them, not cause the the lightning to
[58:25] come down and kill them all like
[58:27] sometimes we want to do. And in our
[58:29] mind, we're thinking, "Oh, if I can only
[58:31] control the lightning.
[58:34] Oh, if I can just throw curses at them
[58:36] and oh, if I could just get back at him,
[58:40] brother Luke, make them pay. That's
[58:42] right. Make them pay. But God on the
[58:45] cross, after suffering the most crulest
[58:48] acts ever to a human man, being beaten
[58:51] and scorged and spit upon at the very
[58:54] end of the day, he says, "Father,
[58:56] forgive them." Do you realize he had a
[58:59] call unto the father? He needed the
[59:01] father's help, too. Yeah, he needed
[59:04] help. He couldn't do it in himself. It
[59:07] was, "Father, forgive them." And when we
[59:10] get to a place in our life that we can't
[59:12] forgive, we call it God and say,
[59:14] "Father, help me forgive them."
[59:18] If Christ could forgive on the cross,
[59:21] what about us? Yes. Amen.
[59:26] You say, "Brother Kobe, I I'm not strong
[59:29] enough to forgive, but Christ is." Yes,
[59:33] he is. You say, "I I'm so weak in in my
[59:36] humanity. Christ is strong enough. It's
[59:39] in your weakness that he is made strong.
[59:42] I'm so glad it's not called God or the
[59:45] sea of God's unforggetfulness.
[59:48] But it's God's forgetfulness that we're
[59:50] in those times that when you can't
[59:52] forget, he's already forgotten. It's in
[59:55] those times where Satan keeps trying to
[59:56] bring it up, saying, "You've done this
[59:58] and you've done that and you you made
[1:00:00] this mistake here." It's God saying, "I
[1:00:03] don't remember it at all."
[1:00:09] My prayer is, Lord, make me more like
[1:00:12] that.
[1:00:15] Make me more like that, Lord.
[1:00:18] erase the memories that
[1:00:21] God cleanse my heart,
[1:00:24] cleanse my soul, Lord,
[1:00:27] because unfortunately
[1:00:30] those hurts are going to try to
[1:00:31] resurface. Come on. And it's usually in
[1:00:34] those times of darkness
[1:00:36] and those times of turmoil, in those
[1:00:38] times where you're feeling alone, you're
[1:00:40] down in the dumps, you you have things
[1:00:42] that you're dealing with in stress, uh,
[1:00:44] in business, in homework, in and dealing
[1:00:47] with the house, the children, there's
[1:00:49] those times where we get down.
[1:00:52] It it's in those times where Satan is
[1:00:55] will try to come in and plant weakness
[1:00:58] and allow things to resurface again.
[1:01:03] That's why Paul says we must die daily.
[1:01:08] That's to every thought, everything the
[1:01:10] devil tries to bring back up. Hello,
[1:01:13] somebody. Because it's easy to let a
[1:01:16] thought come in and then begin to dwell
[1:01:17] on it. And if you're not careful, the
[1:01:19] things you thought you were over with,
[1:01:20] you should have been over with, are now
[1:01:23] trying to resurface again. That's where
[1:01:25] it takes God to come in every day of our
[1:01:29] life
[1:01:31] to allow
[1:01:34] strength in our time of weakness.
[1:01:44] Is forgiveness easy?
[1:01:47] Can anyone tell me that forgiving
[1:01:50] somebody is the easiest thing you've
[1:01:51] ever done?
[1:01:53] No. Forgiveness is not easy. Forgiveness
[1:01:59] takes time.
[1:02:02] Forgiveness is a process. I found out
[1:02:05] through my life, forgiveness is a
[1:02:08] process.
[1:02:09] But I'm so glad
[1:02:12] that people was able to forgive me.
[1:02:16] Sister April, have you ever done
[1:02:17] anything crazy in your life? Yeah. And
[1:02:21] are you glad you were forgiven of that?
[1:02:24] The same forgiveness that we were shown.
[1:02:26] You say, "This is very elementary." It
[1:02:27] is. It is. It is. But the forgiveness
[1:02:31] that God shown you and somebody else
[1:02:34] shown you, we ought to be able to do it
[1:02:38] to someone else.
[1:02:41] You say, "Well, they forgave me." But
[1:02:44] that person over there, it's just like
[1:02:46] that parable that Jesus was telling us
[1:02:48] about. One man was forgiven of all those
[1:02:50] talents and then he left. What did he
[1:02:53] do? He goes right to someone that owed
[1:02:54] him and punished him over the same thing
[1:02:57] he was just forgiven over. You can be
[1:03:00] forgiven all day long. But to go to
[1:03:02] somebody else and say, "Well, I, you
[1:03:04] know, God dealt with all of this, but
[1:03:07] you called me a name.
[1:03:10] You didn't text me back. You know,
[1:03:14] if if that was the problem, Dad would be
[1:03:17] the whole be mad at you.
[1:03:23] I found someone worse than you, Brother
[1:03:24] Josh Bennett. Took me three months to
[1:03:26] get him to text me back. So, I know
[1:03:30] dad's dad's gotten better.
[1:03:33] Brother Robert Breeze talking to brother
[1:03:35] Robert there.
[1:03:41] See,
[1:03:44] seeing this the other day and it says,
[1:03:45] "When we forgive,
[1:03:47] we set a prisoner free and discover that
[1:03:51] the prisoner we set free is us."
[1:03:57] When we forgive, we set a prisoner free
[1:04:01] and discover that the prisoner we set
[1:04:03] free,
[1:04:06] the only harm that you're doing by
[1:04:08] holding a grudge, the only person that
[1:04:11] you're poisoning is yourself.
[1:04:15] You're hurting yourself. The other
[1:04:17] person could have already gotten over
[1:04:18] it, not realize they even hurt you, and
[1:04:21] you're holding on to something. All it's
[1:04:23] doing is poisoning your thoughts. It's
[1:04:25] squeezing the life out of your prayer.
[1:04:27] Every time you come across them, they
[1:04:29] don't realize they've even hurt you, but
[1:04:31] you're you're so mad at them over
[1:04:33] something that you can't see clearly.
[1:04:37] When you go to prayer and you're in
[1:04:38] church, you see that person over here,
[1:04:40] all you're doing is thinking about what
[1:04:42] they did instead of realizing that
[1:04:44] there's there's a God in the room that
[1:04:46] can free you of those chains. Praise the
[1:04:50] Lord. So when we forgive, we set a
[1:04:54] prisoner free and discover, say that
[1:04:57] with me, that the prisoner
[1:04:59] we set free set free is me.
[1:05:06] Psalms 103 and 12
[1:05:10] says, "As far as the east is from the
[1:05:12] west,
[1:05:13] so far have he removed our
[1:05:16] transgressions from us." Hallelujah.
[1:05:18] Micah 7:18
[1:05:20] says, "Who is a God like unto thee that
[1:05:23] pardoneth iniquity
[1:05:26] and passeth by the transgression of the
[1:05:28] remnant of his inheritance heritage? He
[1:05:31] retainth not his anger forever." Thank
[1:05:33] God for that. Because he delightth in
[1:05:36] mercy.
[1:05:38] He will turn again. He will have
[1:05:40] compassion upon us. He will subdue our
[1:05:43] iniquities, oh my.
[1:05:45] and thou will cast all of our sins into
[1:05:49] the depths of the sea. Matthew 6:9 says
[1:05:54] after this matter therefore pray ye our
[1:05:57] father which art in heaven hallowed be
[1:06:00] thy name
[1:06:02] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:06:05] earth in earth right here this flesh as
[1:06:11] it is in heaven and give us this day our
[1:06:13] daily bread
[1:06:15] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:06:17] our debtors and lead us not into
[1:06:19] temptation but deliver us from evil. For
[1:06:23] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:06:26] the glory
[1:06:28] forever.
[1:06:30] Verse 14 says, "And if you forgive men
[1:06:34] their trespasses,
[1:06:36] your heavenly Father will forgive you.
[1:06:39] But if you forgive not men their
[1:06:41] trespasses, neither will your father
[1:06:45] forgive your trespasses."
[1:06:47] Matthew 5:43 it says, "Ye have heard
[1:06:50] that it hath been said that thou shalt
[1:06:52] love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy.
[1:06:55] But I say unto you, love your enemies,
[1:06:58] bless them that curse you, do good to
[1:07:01] them that hate you, and pray for them
[1:07:04] which despitefully use you
[1:07:08] and persecute you." We just read this
[1:07:11] scripture, but can we read it one more
[1:07:12] time? In Matthew 18-21,
[1:07:16] then kept Peter to him and said, Lord,
[1:07:18] how oft shall my brother sin against me
[1:07:21] and I forgive him till seven times? And
[1:07:24] Jesus said unto him, I say not unto thee
[1:07:27] until seven times, but until 70* 7. How,
[1:07:32] brother Merl, you're good with math. How
[1:07:34] many is that? 490.
[1:07:37] 490 times in a day. That does not give
[1:07:39] you
[1:07:41] the right to go out there and try to
[1:07:42] rogue your brother 490 times. 490 times.
[1:07:45] 490 times. But it means that forgiveness
[1:07:50] is unlimited.
[1:07:52] No matter how many times they wronged
[1:07:54] you, how many times they hurt you, you
[1:07:57] forgive.
[1:08:00] Say, "Lord, I need your help."
[1:08:06] seen this story and I'm almost done.
[1:08:08] We're doing good for Wednesday night.
[1:08:12] Says, "There is a story of two brothers
[1:08:15] who lived side by side in their farms
[1:08:17] for many years until one day a foolish
[1:08:20] argument caused a rift between them.
[1:08:23] This was the first serious disagreement
[1:08:25] the brothers had in all their 50 years.
[1:08:29] Up until that day, they always worked
[1:08:31] their fields together and share
[1:08:32] knowledge and produce and lent a helping
[1:08:35] hand to one another in times of need.
[1:08:38] The fight began over a small
[1:08:40] misunderstanding which can sometimes
[1:08:41] happen. But the dispute dragged on and
[1:08:44] became an angry exchange of words
[1:08:47] followed by weeks of silence.
[1:08:51] recommended by one uh by one day there
[1:08:54] was a knock on the older brother's door
[1:08:57] and when he opened it he was facing an
[1:08:59] old bearded carpenter holding a toolbox.
[1:09:02] "I can sure use some work, sir," said
[1:09:05] the stranger. "Do you need any repairs
[1:09:07] in your farm?" "Yes," replied the
[1:09:10] brother. "I got a job for you. Across
[1:09:13] the creek, there's a farm that happens
[1:09:15] to belong to my younger brother. And
[1:09:17] until recently, the whole area between
[1:09:19] our homes were green. But then he
[1:09:22] changed the creek's path, making it into
[1:09:25] a border between us. "I'm not sure he
[1:09:28] did that for spite, but I'll show him,"
[1:09:30] said the older brother. "You see those
[1:09:32] trees by the barn? I want you to turn
[1:09:34] them into a 10-ft tall fence." "I don't
[1:09:37] ever want to see his face again."
[1:09:39] "Well," the old carpenter thought
[1:09:40] quietly to himself for a few minutes and
[1:09:43] eventually said, "I see." So the farmer
[1:09:46] helped the carpenter carry his tools and
[1:09:48] wood, then drove off to the city of
[1:09:50] Samarans. When he came back in the
[1:09:53] evening, the old carpenter had finished.
[1:09:55] Upon arriving at the creek, the older
[1:09:58] brother was stunned.
[1:10:00] His eyes were bulging out, and he
[1:10:02] couldn't utter a single word. Where a
[1:10:05] fence should have been standing, a
[1:10:07] bridge now stood. A quaint and special
[1:10:11] bridge, truly a work of art.
[1:10:14] At the same time, the younger brother
[1:10:16] happened to come to the same spot. He
[1:10:19] rushed over the bridge and embraced his
[1:10:22] older brother. "You're something
[1:10:24] special," he said, building a bridge
[1:10:26] after all that I've said and done. While
[1:10:29] both brothers were hugging, the old
[1:10:30] carpenter collected his tools and
[1:10:32] started walking away.
[1:10:35] The brothers turned to him and said,
[1:10:36] "Please save for a few more days. We
[1:10:39] have more things that need fixing."
[1:10:42] He says, 'I would I would have loved to
[1:10:44] you, kind sir, said the carpenter, but I
[1:10:47] have many more bridges to build and
[1:10:50] things to fix
[1:10:52] in other places. And I love this. Says,
[1:10:54] "The moral of this story is a simple
[1:10:56] one. We often let anger push us away
[1:11:00] from our loved ones and allow pride to
[1:11:03] come before our love." Says, "Don't ever
[1:11:06] let that happen. Learn to forgive
[1:11:10] and appreciate what you have. Says the
[1:11:14] past cannot be changed but the future
[1:11:17] can be.
[1:11:21] The past cannot be changed
[1:11:24] but the future
[1:11:27] can be.
[1:11:29] And before I close, hope this is okay.
[1:11:33] I want to talk about bitterness for just
[1:11:36] a a moment. And I want to use Luke 17
[1:11:40] and6 if that's okay.
[1:11:43] And the Lord said, "If you have faith as
[1:11:46] a grain of a mustard seed, you might say
[1:11:48] unto the sycamore
[1:11:50] sycamine."
[1:11:52] Is that what that says? Sycamine tree.
[1:11:56] Do what?
[1:11:59] Sycamore. Sycamine.
[1:12:01] Be thou plucked up by the root
[1:12:04] and be thou planted in the sea and it
[1:12:07] shall obey you. And what I'm wanting to
[1:12:10] really talk about in this scripture is
[1:12:11] that sycamine sycamore tree. Begin to
[1:12:15] look at these characteristics. They say
[1:12:17] this tree
[1:12:19] can get up to 50 foot tall
[1:12:22] and with widespread branches that go in
[1:12:26] every direction. And it says here that
[1:12:28] it always stays green and it had a low
[1:12:32] growing branch that makes it easy to
[1:12:35] climb. They say this tree,
[1:12:39] the the fruit that it produces is very
[1:12:42] bitter.
[1:12:44] Okay?
[1:12:46] And we see how big this tree can get.
[1:12:48] And you can look at bitterness and
[1:12:51] unforgiveness in your life that if it's
[1:12:54] not dealt with, it can grow into
[1:12:57] something big. Ain't that right? They
[1:13:01] say this tree, I guess like anything in
[1:13:04] in in plants or trees that it has it
[1:13:07] can't be cut off at the ground because
[1:13:10] the root system in this tree they say is
[1:13:15] massive and it can spread and it can
[1:13:17] spread. So we understand, brother Merl,
[1:13:19] you're not supposed to cut off weeds,
[1:13:21] right? You're supposed to pluck them up.
[1:13:24] And with this tree,
[1:13:27] they say that its roots is deep and
[1:13:31] extensive. And they say when you want to
[1:13:33] get rid of this tree, you must pluck it
[1:13:36] out by the roots.
[1:13:40] And bitterness and unforgiveness, I hope
[1:13:42] this is okay. I I came across this
[1:13:44] today. Bitterness and unforgiveness has
[1:13:47] a massive root system.
[1:13:51] It has things in your life that if not
[1:13:53] dealt with, it will grow and it will
[1:13:56] grow and it will grow till it becomes
[1:13:59] something so big in your life that
[1:14:02] without the Lord's help, you're never
[1:14:04] going to get rid of it. And a lot of
[1:14:07] times we try to deal with that and we
[1:14:09] cut it off at the at the surface not
[1:14:12] realizing that the roots are still deep
[1:14:15] down in our heart.
[1:14:18] Is that okay?
[1:14:34] They say the sycamore tree, if you put a
[1:14:37] rod up against the malberry tree, do we
[1:14:39] have malberry trees in Oklahoma?
[1:14:41] Is their fruit sweet? They say that you
[1:14:44] could put a sycamine tree and a malberry
[1:14:48] tree side by side. Their fruit looks
[1:14:51] identical,
[1:14:53] but one of them is sweet
[1:14:56] and one of them is bitter.
[1:15:01] They say the sycamore sycamine, I keep
[1:15:04] calling sycamore sycamines trees wood
[1:15:07] back in the day was the preferred wood
[1:15:10] for building caskets.
[1:15:14] I want to throw this out there if that's
[1:15:16] okay.
[1:15:18] If you allow bitterness and
[1:15:20] unforgiveness in your life, all it
[1:15:22] produces is death.
[1:15:26] You say, "I I don't know." It does. It
[1:15:28] will kill your spiritual walk with the
[1:15:31] Lord. If you don't deal with the
[1:15:34] bitterness in your life, if you don't
[1:15:37] allow something to be that was said to
[1:15:39] be let go of, what happens? It will
[1:15:42] build and the roots will go down so deep
[1:15:44] in your heart that it will crush the
[1:15:47] very life that you have.
[1:15:51] Now I hope that's okay.
[1:15:56] I seen one more thing here as the
[1:15:58] musicians get ready to come. It says the
[1:16:00] sycamine tree
[1:16:03] is pollinated only by wasps.
[1:16:08] They say the pollination process was
[1:16:11] only initiated when a wasp stuck its
[1:16:14] stinger right into the heart of the
[1:16:17] fruit. Says, "Thus the tree and his
[1:16:19] fruit had to be stung in order to be
[1:16:24] produced."
[1:16:25] How many's ever heard the saying that
[1:16:28] when when you're hurt by somebody, it's
[1:16:30] you you just been stung by them?
[1:16:35] Words can hurt.
[1:16:38] Words can destroy.
[1:16:40] And if we're not careful, we'll allow
[1:16:43] that to poison the fruit.
[1:16:52] Amen.
[1:17:01] Brother Brandham says here,
[1:17:04] go back up to it here.
[1:17:08] Says, "The spirit of God upon you will
[1:17:10] make you act like Jesus."
[1:17:13] Now, there's where you find the Holy
[1:17:15] Spirit. See,
[1:17:17] that's what the Holy Spirit does. It
[1:17:19] makes you meek. It makes you humble.
[1:17:22] Makes you forgiving.
[1:17:24] Could they pull the whiskers from your
[1:17:26] face if they had them there and jerk
[1:17:28] them out and spit in your face? Would
[1:17:31] you have the power to call a legion of
[1:17:32] angels?
[1:17:34] Could you do that for the love of the
[1:17:36] people that was spitting in your face?
[1:17:37] Could you do it? If somebody just walked
[1:17:40] up to you and said, "Hey, you
[1:17:41] hypocrite." And smacked you on one side
[1:17:43] of the face, could you pray for their
[1:17:46] forgiveness?
[1:17:48] Now, that's where trust the test whether
[1:17:51] you got the Holy Spirit or not. See,
[1:17:54] when somebody says something evil
[1:17:56] against someone, sometimes that claims
[1:17:59] to have the Holy Spirit,
[1:18:02] I'll get even with her even if it takes
[1:18:04] me in my last days. See, that's theirs
[1:18:07] is where you check about your Holy
[1:18:09] Spirit. See, says, "Blessed are you when
[1:18:13] men shall say all manner of evil against
[1:18:16] you falsely for my name's sake, but you
[1:18:19] go get even with them." No. Rejoice and
[1:18:23] be exceedingly glad, for so persecuted
[1:18:26] they the prophets which were before you.
[1:18:28] See when someone says evil about you,
[1:18:31] say something good. If you can't say
[1:18:34] something good about them, don't say
[1:18:37] anything at all. Just let it go. See,
[1:18:41] and then when you get to yourself, you
[1:18:44] pray for them. You know what? You could
[1:18:46] hurt their little feelings. Papa and
[1:18:49] mama knows a lot of time they get in
[1:18:50] trouble. gives them a spacing. He says
[1:18:53] this, another quote, why two minutes
[1:18:55] their little arms are wrapped around
[1:18:57] them and forgot all about it. And that's
[1:19:00] the way we got to do no matter what goes
[1:19:03] on. We got to be forgiving and kind to
[1:19:06] one another and be like that, like
[1:19:09] little children willing to forgive and
[1:19:12] forget and like that. That's what we're
[1:19:15] supposed to do. that when we do that,
[1:19:19] we're coming near to the kingdom of God.
[1:19:22] Then,
[1:19:26] heavenly father, uh
[1:19:29] we love you, Lord.
[1:19:34] I'm asking here tonight, Lord, that
[1:19:36] you'll look deep in our hearts.
[1:19:39] If there's anything, Lord, a root of
[1:19:41] bitterness
[1:19:43] Lord, any odd against one another, Lord,
[1:19:47] any unforgiveness that, Father, that we
[1:19:50] need to forgive someone over, I pray
[1:19:52] tonight,
[1:19:54] that you'll check the hearts, Lord. May
[1:19:56] we be honest with ourselves, with you
[1:19:59] here tonight, Lord, and realize
[1:20:02] that I might have an odd here, Lord, or
[1:20:04] I I might have something against
[1:20:07] somebody here, or I may be hurting here.
[1:20:12] Lord, I pray that you'll help each
[1:20:15] individual here tonight. Lord,
[1:20:18] we love you. We thank you for all that
[1:20:20] you've done for us and forgiving us.
[1:20:24] In your name, we pray.
[1:20:26] Amen. And amen. As we invite our pastor
[1:20:29] now, can we sing that He
[1:20:32] has
[1:20:34] forgiven
[1:20:36] me.

[1:21:36] forgiven
[1:21:38] me. One more time now. Oh, he
[1:21:42] has
[1:21:44] forgiven
[1:21:47] me.
[1:21:48] My sins have been washed
[1:21:53] from his memory
[1:21:57] by the blood of the lamb.
[1:22:02] of Calary.
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:06] He
[1:22:08] has
[1:22:10] forgiven
[1:22:12] me.
[1:22:14] Oh, search me, Lord.
[1:22:19] Oh, search me, Lord.
[1:22:24] Oh, let your light down from heaven over
[1:22:29] my soul.
[1:22:32] Oh, if you find anything that should not
[1:22:37] be, take it out, oh Lord, and strengthen
[1:22:41] me. I want to live right. I want to be
[1:22:45] saved. And can we go up a key? Oh,
[1:22:49] oh, search me, Lord.

[1:23:06] Oh, if you find anything that should not
[1:23:10] be taken out, oh Lord, strengthen me. I
[1:23:15] want to live right. I want to be saved.
[1:23:19] And I want to be whole. Can we stand and
[1:23:21] sing it now? Oh, search me Lord.

[1:23:35] my soul.
[1:23:38] Oh, if you find anything that should not

[1:23:46] me. I want to live right. I want to be
[1:23:50] saved and I want to be whole. One more
[1:23:53] time. Oh, search me Lord.
[1:23:58] Oh, search me Lord.
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:02] Let your life
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:25] I want to live right. I want to be
[1:24:29] saved. I want to be whole.
[1:24:36] Hallelujah.
[1:24:38] [Applause]
[1:24:40] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:46] What a pertinent message
[1:24:49] for every one of us today.
[1:24:52] When there's so much unforgiveness,
[1:24:55] we're living in a world of just
[1:24:57] unforgiveness.
[1:25:00] Everyone's so angry. Everyone's holding
[1:25:03] everything
[1:25:05] over the heads of somebody else.
[1:25:11] And if
[1:25:13] you could
[1:25:16] just record
[1:25:19] what we say about other people and the
[1:25:22] judgments we make
[1:25:26] and just play that back to ourselves and
[1:25:29] how that tearing somebody else down,
[1:25:31] what what are you doing to them?
[1:25:35] You hear people,
[1:25:38] you know, wives tear their husbands down
[1:25:42] and um you hear husbands tearing their
[1:25:46] wives down,
[1:25:50] parents their children,
[1:25:57] and you you you listen and you think,
[1:26:00] "Do you not remember when you were a
[1:26:02] child?" told her, "Do you not Do you not
[1:26:06] realize
[1:26:07] how miserable your husband is having to
[1:26:10] put up with you?
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:14] Come on. Sometimes he's miserable having
[1:26:16] to put up with you, and sometimes that's
[1:26:20] humanity.
[1:26:25] But when I've been freely forgiven by
[1:26:27] the Lord,
[1:26:28] freely loved by the Lord, and I have
[1:26:31] found his grace, and as as Kobe said,
[1:26:34] brother Kobe said, "No man can forgive
[1:26:37] in his own ability,
[1:26:40] there's got to be a higher someone
[1:26:43] higher who can forgive me and help me,
[1:26:47] and that's Jesus Christ."
[1:26:50] No human. We've all hurt each other,
[1:26:54] but God chose to come and become a man
[1:26:58] to pay the price to forgive me of my
[1:27:02] sin.
[1:27:04] And tonight,
[1:27:06] it makes it easy for me to be able to
[1:27:09] forgive somebody else
[1:27:13] of theirs because I've been forgiven by
[1:27:15] God. I've been loved by God. I've been
[1:27:17] healed by God.
[1:27:19] And now I can I can love
[1:27:21] unconditionally,
[1:27:23] give unconditionally.
[1:27:26] Do I make mistakes? Yes, I do. Do I need
[1:27:28] to go back and ask more forgiveness?
[1:27:31] Yes, I do. But the more I have to ask
[1:27:33] for forgiveness,
[1:27:36] I always want to be willing
[1:27:40] to forgive.
[1:27:42] Lord, let me forgive those around me.
[1:27:46] Amen.
[1:27:48] I thought that was that was a wonderful
[1:27:52] message tonight.
[1:27:54] [Applause]
[1:28:02] When you forgive I I like that when you
[1:28:04] forgive others,
[1:28:07] you set a prisoner free. And when you
[1:28:11] look, you find that you are that
[1:28:13] prisoner that's been set free. And I
[1:28:16] think that's a wonderful thing. Well, I
[1:28:19] don't want to think too high and mighty
[1:28:20] of myself, and neither should you think
[1:28:22] too high and mighty of yourself. We We
[1:28:26] We're all prone to hurt one another. But
[1:28:30] I'm so glad that a Christian's prone to
[1:28:32] forgive because of the grace of God.
[1:28:37] Amen. Well, Brother Kobe was going to
[1:28:39] preach. Uh I had him for this last
[1:28:41] Sunday night. When brother Jonathan was
[1:28:44] here, he texted and said, "Man,
[1:28:47] I can do it another time."
[1:28:50] So, we we pushed him on over here for
[1:28:53] tonight. And I'm glad I'm glad we did.
[1:28:55] We had two wonderful services on Sunday
[1:28:58] and a wonderful service tonight.
[1:29:04] Amen.
[1:29:08] and like to say it's really good to have
[1:29:12] Lena and Shakana with us and uh
[1:29:20] [Applause]
[1:29:21] and so
[1:29:23] um they came to visit with with mom for
[1:29:27] a few days and mom and dad and I think
[1:29:30] they're going to be heading back. When
[1:29:31] are you leaving? When are you going back
[1:29:32] home?
[1:29:35] Next week. So, I think they're going to
[1:29:37] be leaving next next week.
[1:29:40] No,
[1:29:43] [Music]
