that's our desire we ask Lord that you would just be with us today this service Lord as we'd say some parting words Lord Lord know not knowing if we'll see one another again on this side but Lord we

back Lord with a renewed Vigor and Fire Lord to serve you greater than ever before we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen amen turn your Bibles to Luke chapter 14 amen it's been a privilege to be with you and to minister to you and amen to um to work alongside my buddy brother Andrew and amen and uh uh he's I got I don't know I'm almost double his age close enough anyway and so it's kind of hard to run around like he does and do all he does but uh uh not just double his age but double other things too you know but anyway amen but uh we're just uh glad to be together and to work together and M what a wonderful job he has done in these meetings and amen building your faith in the word of almighty God Amen that's where our faith has to be we we can't depend on anything else but we can depend upon the word of God because it'll never fail of course want to thank brother wendle and brother Kobe brother Josh all the whole team and and my just everybody it takes a it takes a village to raise a kid you know and so it takes it's more there's there's probably just as many unseen there is seen that that are doing things and maybe don't get the thanks and the gratitude that they deserve but we just want to say thank you today for all that you've done and and for this meeting I believe it has Eternal effects amen so why don't we just give the church here New Life Outreach Church a good hand and say thank you this morning thank you for all that you done amen amen maybe just make it your goal before you leave to try to tell them all thank you go through the line say thank you somebody had to get up early to cook your breakfast this morning and work hard sacrifice a lot and and so we're just thankful for each one amen Luke chapter 14 and verse 25 says there went a great multitude with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not as a father and mother and wife and children brother and sisters yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and count the cost whether he have sufficient to finish him L happly after he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it began to all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build but was not able to finish and what king goeth to war make war against another king sth not down first and consult whether he be able to S with 10,000 to meet that which cometh against him with 20,000 or el else while the other is yet a great way off he send his ambassage or desireth conditions of Peace So likewise whoever whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all he hath he cannot be my disciple amen we'll let you be seated i' like to speak to you this morning on faith to win amen Faith to win I as we reading our scripture reading this morning Jesus is trying to get across an important lesson that it isn't he that starts is he that finishes amen and you know the only winner in the race that we're in is the one who crosses the finished line it's not about beginning it's not about starting it's about finishing and it's about finishing to win amen I I know we live in a time you know of participation trophies you know you get a participation trophy if you participate but you're not going to get a trophy because you participated in this race you'll only get a trophy if you finish this race you know athletes train and they train and they run and they lift weights and they beat their bodies into subjections and they get up you know when their body don't want to they eat right things when their body don't want to they what because they have a goal and they're fighting to win and you know they're fighting to win a corruptible Crown there's men that won trophies uh years ago that they can't even find them no more or they've decayed now and they're gone but you know I I believe we ought to have much more inside of us to fight to win because we're not W trying to win a corruptible crown of some wreath or some golden tablet but we're here to win an Incorruptible crown and you know I I was looking upon this thought as I thought how in the world am I going to close these meetings out and and and I got to I got to looking at at the at the at what it takes to win and what and you know and and there's this man he came from Tanzania maybe you've heard this story uh but it was name was John Steven uh Acra I can't pronounce his last name but anyway he's from Tanzania and he went to the 1968 Summer Olympics and while competing you know he he he got a cramp and and he because he was in some high altitude and that wasn't what he trained in because that's not what his country had and so and so way he gets this cramp in his muscle but he continues to run and you know somewhere about the middle of the race he was jockeying for position and between some Runners and he was hit and he fell down wounded wounded himself really bad and he dislocated his knee joint and he hit his shoulder real hard but however he continued running and you know he finished last among the 57 that completed the race now there was 75 that started the race but there was 57 that completed it and he was one of them and you know he finished in about 3 hours and 25 minutes and 27 seconds which is exactly 1 hour and 5 minutes behind the winter he said but by the time he came across a Finish Line his knee was bandaged and it was bleeding there was only a few people left in the stadium the sun had set and you know the television crew was wasn't there but they was sent back you know because there was they heard one more Runner was about to finish and as he finally crossed the line a cheer came from a small crowd and when interviewed later he was asked why he continued to run he he said well my country did not send me 5,000 miles to start a race they sent me 5,000 Mi to finish a race Hallelujah I want you to understand God didn't send you here to start amen he put Paul and those Runners to start the race but he put you here to finish the race amen we must be finishers there has to be a determination on the inside of us that there's nothing going to make me quit there's nothing that's going to make me stop I'm not going to be short of the go line but I am going to cross the finish line amen you know there got to be something on the inside of you that when the going gets tough you get tougher amen when things get begin to get harder You Dig Down Deeper because I am a finisher I am going to cross this line I am going to finish this race God didn't put me here to quit God didn't put me here to lay down God didn't put me here to rub my sores and my wounds and all of that God put me here to finish hallelujah amen Jesus would say this about himself he said my meat or what gives me strength is to do the work of him that sent me and to finish his work amen in John 5 and 36 he said behold I have a greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father has given me to finish amen finish you know he he he came down to that part where he had to bring his body and his thoughts and everything into subjection and and we mentioned it the other morning he was there Crying In The Garden of Gethsemane and he Lord let this cup pass from me amen what was it it was a war between his flesh and his spirit and amen what what was down on the inside of him and he all of a sudden he began to say not my will but thy will be done and he went to the Finish Line it wasn't an easy Finish Line he had to be beat he had to be scored he had to be mocked he had had to go through all kinds of things but he crossed the finish line and he's hanging upon that cross what was the words out of his mouth it is finished it is done it is finished it is over with amen if he can just get you to believe the same life that was in that finisher has now come in some more people and that life of that finisher is here to finish another race and they will lay their flesh down they will lay their attitudes down they will lay what they want down and say not my will but thy will be done let me finish the race that has [Applause] begun do you understand in a in a relay race they put the best at the last they put him at the first and they put him at the last the first sets the pace and the last finishes it hallelujah what it was is at the beginning so shall it be at the end they set the pace and now we're to finish it amen they said it they showed that there was Miracles and there was signs and there was wonders and there was healings and there was Deliverance and there was the Holy Ghost Power that'll rise up above any kind of devil amen and we are here to finish with the same attitude Paul had with the same life Jesus had to finish the race that has been started Hallelujah when he said it's finished Satan lost all power he can only Bluff you now he can if he can Bluff you into something all right you'll have to have it but legally he has no power because Jesus said is finished he is nothing but a bluff if I can put it to you very plainly this morning amen he ain't nothing but a puppet Amen brother bandam said God allows troubles to come he said but God puts harnesses upon it and bits in his mouth amen the devil has a harness on him he has a bit on him he can only go so far he can only do so much he can only do what God allows him to do he just a dumb puppet he just a bluff he's a nobody he's a nothing amen he'll only do he can only do what you allow him amen yeah boy we going to get into something just hang on hang tight now said something in the word can make you realize you're free by the grace of God then the word makes you understand or some Act of God that's included you amen it included you it includes its all then you accept it on those basis you're free you don't have to feel any different you don't have to look any different you're free Jesus never did say do you feel it he said Do you believe it it's faith faith is a mighty arm that holds a sharp two-edged sword of the god word of God and that sharp toed sword will cut every Promise free if that arm of faith is yielded is able to yield that sword some people may have weak muscle trouble they can only cut off a little scratch enough to come to church every once in a while amen others can cut their way to justification but some can go all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that great strong arm holding this Bible can cut every Promise free so be strong in the Lord be strong in the Lord amen amen in John 16 and verse 16 we can turn there if you would John 16 verse 16 he said a little while ye shall see me and again a little while you shall not see me because I go to the father then some said of the disciples among themselves what do this say what is this saying a little while you'll not see me and again a little while you'll see me because I go to the father they couldn't understand this because he used the same term a little while but one little while was only a few days they wasn't going to see him again another little while was going to be 2,000 years but to God everything's just a little while cuz he's not a creature of time he's a creature of Eternity we on the other hand are all about time and and time you know time to go to lunch time for the service to end time for this to happen time God's not interested in your time he's a god of Eternity and so you go through things for a little while how's long how long is this going to last brother Timothy a little while amen a little while and some of the disciples wondered about them what does this say in a little while and Jesus knew what they were desires to ask him and said unto you choir among yourself while I've said a little while you shall not see me and a little while you shall see me verely verely I say unto you that you shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and you shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when she's in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but soon as she's delivered of the child she remember no more anguish for the joy that AO man is Born Into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again Hallelujah I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man will be able to take from you in that day you shall ask me nothing verely verely I'll say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hither to have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full these things have I spoke to you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I no more speak to you in Proverbs and at that time Hallelujah the seventh Angels shall begin to sound and all the Mysteries should be finished he's not speaking to us in Proverbs no more at that time I speak to you in proverb but I shall show you plainly of the father at that day you shall ask in my name and I say not unto you I will pray the father for you for the father himself love you because he had loved me and believe that I came from God I came from the father and I've come into this world I leave the world and I go to the father his disciples says lo now speak us out plainly speak no proverb now we're sure that thou knowest all things and needeth not any man should ask thee but this we believe that thou comest from God he said do you now believe behold the hour cometh yay is now come that you shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I'm not alone because the father is with me these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace what he told of all the sorrow and all the problems and all but I've told you all this that you can have peace cuz in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the [Applause] world if he's overcome the world he's overcome everything in the world Hallelujah all things are under his feet amen just like brother Brandon dealing with that Maniac in Portland you know that one in Oregon that came up made that challenge and he said he said he's going to spit in his face and do beat him up and do all that and he said before I knew what I was saying I said but you will fall over my feet and he said we went to back to RAR back to hit him and it's like an invisible force hit him and knocked him down and the policeman said come over said is he delivered he said no he's not delivered but will you mindly kind of just move him off my feet and he said he got back up and he said now as I was saying faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen he said about that time somebody jumped out of a wheelchair somebody come off a c he said within about 5 minutes there wasn't a sick person in the building he said why cuz that chief of that tribe of demons made his Challenge and he lost Hallelujah and he said when he fell everything under him [Applause] fell Hallelujah devil I want you to understand you are defeated the Demons of hell are defeated everything under you is lost Jesus finished so you can finish he won so you can win but you can only win if you have the spirit of the winner on the inside of you have any man heard that song I heard it over in Europe Jesus is a winter man a winter man winter man I like the other part Satan is a loser man loser man that's time we turn it on he always talking about how much a loser you are won't you tell him what a loser he is you loser you loser sure you're going to go from here and you're going to go through difficult times you're you're going to go through trials you're going to go through issues and situations but let's make this determination you ready with me if there is a next Camp if there is a next service at my home church I'm going in as a winner I am going in as a winner I'm going in as an overcomer I'm going in as a finisher too many of you have left with a victory and come back a loser but this Camp I'm not leaving with With Victory and coming back with a loser if there is another Camp I'm coming back with Victory hallelujah it's going to pay pay you going have to pay a price but it's worth it amen Paul looked at that in Philippians 3 he says not as though I've already obtained either were all already perfected but I follow after if that I may have apprehend that which is also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind forgetting those things so in other words losing that loser mentality amen the past leave the past in the past Hallelujah reaching forth to those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling I press that's not easy I press amen the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee from you it's a resistance it's a pushing out it's a say no devil not today no you get away from for me Satan That's Not My Thoughts that's exactly what a weightlifter goes through they use resistance to get stronger Hallelujah every time you resist you come back stronger you resist and you come back stronger you resist and you come back stronger keep resisting the devil and he'll flee from you he realize I ain't big enough I ain't strong enough I can't do nothing about that s it's over with Hallelujah anyhow I'm not going to let the devil get me down 1 Corinthians 9 says know you not 24 know you not that they which run the r run in the race run off but one receiveth the prize who he who crosses the finish line so run that you may obtain every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I as not one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I preach to others I myself should be a Castaway you have to Die daily this old flesh tries to rise up every day resist it for second Timothy 4:6 for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing so you want a crown of righteousness love his appearing well I'm looking for that Rapture listen he appears in every service but some people don't love is appearing enough to come to [Applause] church amen you know why cuz they got a bunch of loser mentality and I'm going to deal with this for just a moment so bear with me you know what loser mentality is is blame others when you fail it's refusing to change when you're presented with the truth that you're wrong it means you don't ever learn from your mistakes you keep making the same mistakes over and over and over you have a my way or the highway attitude oh yeah allowing others people to completely or somebody or something some devil to Define who you are and you just go along with whatever he says amen you you choose not to stand up for truth and for righteousness you say well I failed and there's nothing I can do failure is the end of my road that's a loser mentality you have a should have or a would have or a could have or why me I knew it was going to get a little quiet for just a moment you're feeling bad for yourself but not doing anything to change it I just looked up some things on winners and losers so just bear with me for a minute a winner is always ready to tackle something a loser is prone to believe it can't be done a winner makes mistakes and says I'm wrong a loser makes mistakes and says it wasn't my [Applause] fault a winner is challenged by a problem and goes through it a loser will never face the problem and tries to go around it but never gets by it a winter realizes there's no time like the present to get a job done a loser begins to procrastinate with the hope that tomorrow is g to be a better day I'll get it done tomorrow I hope you didn't bring your eggs and your tomatoes and stuff a winner thinks positively acts positive lives positive a loser usually has a negative attitude and a negative approach to everything a winner says let's find out a loser says nobody knows a winner says I'm good but I'm not good as I should be a loser says I'm not as bad as everybody [Applause] else amen a winner makes commitments a loser makes empty promises es a winner learns from those who are superior a loser tries to tear down those that are superior a winner Works harder than a loser and has more time a loser is always too busy to do what's necessary a winner shows he's sorry by making it up for it a loser says I'm sorry but does the same thing the next time amen a winner knows what's to fight for and what to compromise on a loser compromises on what he shouldn't and fights for what isn't worth fighting for a winner listens a loser just wants to talk brother Timothy this ain't the service I was looking for well glory to God anyhow I want you I can't help this y'all got t-shirts and y'all got things that says anointed to win but don't you dare put that t-shirt on with some loser mentality you ain't got a right to wear it unless you're a winner Hallelujah a winner is always part of the answer a loser is always part of the problem a winner has a plan a loser has an excuse a winner says let me do it a loser says that's not my job W there some Devil's getting stomped this morning a winner sees the answer to the problem I to answer for every problem a loser sees a problem for every answer a winner says it's too difficult it may be too may be difficult but it's POS possible a loser said it may be possible but it's too difficult winners have dreams losers have [Applause] schemes winners are a part of the team losers are a part from the team oh Jesus amen winners see the gain losers see nothing but the pain winners see possibilities losers see nothing but problems winners believe in win win losers believe if I win somebody's going to lose winners see potential losers see the past that's why God looks at you and he don't see the past he sees your potential cuz he's not a loser he's a winner and he SE something on the inside of you the devil he looks at you and says look at this look at that look what you done you know why he's doing that cuz he's a loser but God sees a potential on the inside out of you now this one I had to read about four times to catch so winners are like a thermostat losers are like thermometers what is a therm thermostat does it sets the temperature what does the thermometer do it goes up and down with what the temperature [Applause] is why don't you step from being a thermometer and start being a thermostat you know if you're a thermostat you can set the temperature in your church one or two people on fire for God would do more than 4 to so quit being a thermometer and I'm up and I'm down and I'm up and I'm down and I'm up and I'm down but I am here to set it I am going to praise God I'm going to worship God I'm going to glorify God I'm going to give him praise I don't care how cold it is I don't care how hot it is it does not [Applause] matter winners choose what they say uhoh losers say what they choose I'm just going to give them a piece of my mind how many pieces you got left pretty soon you're going to run out of pieces amen winners use hard arguments but soft words losers use soft arguments but hard words winners stand firm on V values but they will compromise on Petty things so if it really doesn't matter it doesn't matter but if it matters it matters if it's the word of God it matters but if it's just your opinion it don't matter listen we can go through this building of of all the how many how many likes a peon pie how many likes a cherry pie how many what's your favorite pie you know all kind favorite cake everybody have a different opinion but you know what that is it's just an opinion brother Daniel Williams I don't know many of y'all probably don't even know him but he was a a soldier in the in the army of the Lord in the very early days of of these camp meetings and things in the beginning of our camp meeting and he said these things that stuck with me he said opinions are just like noses everybody has one yeah but it doesn't mean that your nose means more than somebody else's [Laughter] nose Hallelujah but losers will stand firm on Petty things and they'll compromise on True Values winers say do unto others as you would have them do unto you loser says do it to others before they do it to you but you know we got to get the C out of our vocabulary amen when it get the I can I will I do believe in your vocabulary get you some winner mentality about you because if you got a winner on the inside of you you're going to [Applause] win I remember a little girl sister Mariah you would heard her testimony but I just never forget this young girl losing all of her hair just happened to see a picture of it on my iPad as I was thumbing through looking for that broken pottery and and she's all bald just a few sprigs and she comes up she comes up to the uh get one of our camp meetings she walks up into the prayer line she got two little bobby pins she said Uncle Timothy I'm going to wear these you know what had happened to her one morning she woke up and the devil was going to was telling her in her ear that she would never have her hair back that she'd always be bald and she'd always have to in complexes were trying to sit on side of her but but her mama had a tape playing and she heard brother brandham singing I can I will I do believe and she throw down that old loser mentality and she grabbed a hold of some winning mentality and she wrote it down on the wall I can I will I do believe and that was her profession I can I will I do believe come on somebody amen the devil's come to this Camp before you got here on your drive into the yard he said you're not going to get nothing you're not going to be nothing you're going to go home a loser you came here a loser but I care I will I do believe you're the loser I'm the winner you're the defeated I'm the Overcomer you lost I have won the victory so let's get some winning mentality some winning words in our life Philippians 4 says I can do all things what's all things brother Timothy exactly what it means all things it don't take too much of a dictionary to understand all things but what's been hindering you what's been causing you to fall away what's been causing you to back up well you can do all things you know what you can do you can go home and clean your closet out you can go home and clean your iPod out or your iPhone out or your Android phone out or whatever kind of phone you got you can clean it out cuz you can do all things amen Colossians 3 says I let the peace of God rule my heart and I'll re I'll refuse to worry about anything oh that's a hard one but it's the truth amen Proverbs 3:5 says trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not into your own understanding and all your way submit to him and he will make your path straight Isaiah 54 says no weapon formed against me shall prosper and every tongue formed against me shall be condemned my righteousness is of the Lord Revelation 12 says I am an overcomer I have overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony James 4 said I am submitted to God and the devil flees from me because I resist him him Psalms 46 says God is my refuge and strength he is my well-proven help in the time of trouble Romans 8:37 said no in all these things we are more than conquerors amen I'm not just a conqueror I'm more than a [Applause] conqueror I don't remember exactly how the story goes but there was a young man by the name of George Foreman and Muhammad Ali they had this big fight and Muhammad Ali had made up his mind he's going to get on the ropes and he gets on the ropes and he's letting George George is hitting him with everything he's got George been had never lost so he'd never lost a fight he he is a big Punch Out guy he knocked people out in the first round first few seconds didn't matter and here he is flailing and flailing flailing and Mohammed just dodging and dodging and moving and moving finally got him up there close enough old Muhammad Ali pulled old George up and said is that all you got on could you imagine yeah this man been knocking people out and he's been giving every his best shots toward this man been giving it giving it giving it giving it giving it giving it and this man pulls him up and says is that all you got it why because he was a winner there was something on he was a champion there was something on the inside of him amen that would fight and keep on fighting amen but he let him get all wore out but about the seventh eighth round whatever it was he said it was time to come off the ropes and he started taking the fight to old George and he knocked him out come on young people you might have been on the ropes amen you came here on the ropes you've been trying to dodge and trying to DOD Satan been swinging he been swing but it's now time for you to come off the ropes it's time for you to grab your armor and go to the devil and say devil I'm done with you your head's coming off I'm going to knock you out you're not knocking me out of this race you're not making me quit you're not making me stop you're not making me turn around I've come to far I'm going all the way with Jesus all the way with Jesus I am not going to turn around I am not going to stop I am going to finish you need to look at that devil and say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world he said if we could only receive that truth that he that's in you is great greater than he that's in the world did you hear that not that hope so not that maybe not that might maybe it could work out maybe it that's all the devil's language he loves to use the word but he loves to use the word maybe he loves to use all the conjection whatever you call ain't no English huh conjunctions is that it whatever he likes to use those things God's A Healer but it might be his will it maybe it'll work out maybe you can overcome it maybe you'll come back next year and maybe not devil the only way I don't make it next year cuz I'm somewhere else that's what you need to tell him I've been called to another place I've been called to another dimension devil if you can't find me no more there ain't but one place to look for me Hallelujah that's why I've said it before you can call me a Holy Roller you can call me a a a fanatic you can call me whatever you want to but devil one of these days you're going to call me gone cuz I'll be changed and a woman in a twinkling of an eye cuz I have seen the Door of Hope and I walked into it so if you put that shirt on take the May out take the wh ifs out take the butts out come on somebody take take take all of that out then get that out of your vocabulary that's not who I am I can I will I do believe well brother Timothy what if it gets harder it doesn't matter I can I will I do believe amen sister Mariah walked through that prayer line came out just as bald as she ever was but her testimony never changed she kept saying I can I will I do believe more hair fell out I can I will I do believe I'll never forget that Mother's Day after we was over at my wife's Mother's house and so at her grandma's and she came to me she said Uncle Timothy I got to show you something look at my hair and she pulls off her hat and it's as bald as ever as far as I was concerned I was like wow that's beautiful joining in her confession that's beautiful maybe there might be a little fuzz there I couldn't tell but it was bald but that didn't change your confession I'll never forget we had our family camp at that time on it was happened to be on Father's Day weekend and she came up to brother Ron and my dad and she said look at my hair and she pulled it out and locks fell out Mother's Day to Father's Day locks came out and it fell down to her collar why cuz she had a can do attitude she knew God had paid the price he had done it it was finished it was over with it didn't matter what the devil says it didn't matter what he went through it didn't matter the symptoms that didn't matter What mattered was the word of almighty God and she held on to it come on somebody I hope you can get that can do attitude about you that no matter if the symptoms gets worse other trials gets worse other the problems gets worse I care more Devils I care more symptoms I [Applause] can come on now you have been anointed it ain't my anointing it ain't brother Andrew's anointing it's the anointing of God it's it's the Holy Ghost it's the indweller how many received the Holy Ghost this weekend well you know what happened if you received the Holy Ghost and God came and put his life on the inside of you you know what came in there a winner an overcomer a finisher amen not somebody's going to quit not somebody's going to succumb to their feelings succumb to what somebody else says or what the devil says or or you know the church can run away and turn around and deny the message don't matter that matters not because it ain't them that liveth anymore it's Christ that liveth on the inside of me listen I've had best friends leave brother Andrews had it we've all had best friends walk away we've had people disappoint us people that you thought would never they were pillars you thought you thought it would never happen and they're gone but don't get your eyes on them get your eyes on those that says I'm still here why because it ain't their strength it's the winter on the inside amen I can't help but keep harping on it that t-shirt or that thing that that sweatshirt whatever you got was not given to you to be a loser come here buddy I want to make sure they see the turn around is on the back what does that say huh anointed to win anointed to is that what we're reading here to what what I don't see anointed to maybe win or might win or it says anointed to win anointed to win anointed to overcome anointed to finish the CL the race anointed to cross over come on somebody I'm not talking about it just a laxidasical attitude as we talked about the other morning some halfhazard thing that's not what that church for there ain't nobody had a halfhazard lack ofical attitude that want anything come on you got all kind of Heroes out there y'all know all their stats and all the Michael Jordan's LeBron James whatever exactly exactly right and you know what all they ever done is so amazing just look how he shoots look how look how Patrick Mahomes and we make these ungodly men Heroes and they

unbelief and we make them Heroes and they ain't done nothing but and we pattern our life after him and we want to live like them and we want to be like them if I could just shoot like he does if I could just throw like he does if I could just run like he does oh my did you see my team win and there a bunch of Helens come on somebody a bunch of tore up families and living with this one and doing that all kinds of sin going on and they're made to be heroes but I'm here to tell you about a real hero he didn't do this and he didn't do this but he did this and he said it is finished and when he said that the devil's in hell shook cuz they knew right then they had lost their power and he came back he went down to Hell and he came back with some trophies it was the keys to the devil's own [Applause] kingdom Hallelujah h i mean who's got a set of keys in here right now you got a set of keys I don't have one amen but I wish I had a set of keys cuz he came back and he just shakes them in his face yeah devil you ain't got the keys to Y I knew brother mlar would come through yeah that's what I'm talking about you ain't got the keys to your own house you can't lock the doors and you can't unlock the doors you can't open the doors and you can't shut the doors you don't have a key to your own house but neither does Jesus have the keys he gave them to you we have been given the key so if you see a door that's shut before you put a key in turn it it'll open and you can walk through this morning woo hallelujah amen let's walk through let's walk through as we heard last night come on let's walk through let's give God glory let's give God praise we got the keys devil brother Miguel how defeated would you feel if you didn't have keys to your own house but some other guy did that'd be pretty defeated because you know why he can go inside your house anytime he wants to he can go in brother Miguel he can sit on your favorite recliner he can kick his feet up he can get him a glass eyes tea out of your refrigerator he can make him a cup of coffee and can do whatever you want to at any time anywhere in any place cuz he's got the keys he's got Dominion hallelujah oh come on

and you know you can't lock me up you can't shut me up you can't keep me in Devil I got the keys I'm coming out cuz I'm a winner anyway Hallelujah he showed who had the keys there in the New Testament when there was Peter that was bound in the jail house the devil thought I got him locked up I got him bound up I got him in the inner prison I got him so deep there ain't going to be no help but there was some people with some keys and they started crying out to the Lord and saying God don't you see Peter over there he's Bound in a prison he's Bound in sin he's Bound in some situation he's got soldiers around him amen but the keys were delivered to the house where Peter was at and the angel of the Lord come inside the house didn't matter if there was somebody trying to keep him out didn't matter if there was doors locked and there was prison doors shut that mattered not somebody else had the keys Peter's asleep between Four soldiers two one on each side two at the door he's asleep I said he's an angel and he said his chains just fell off I thought the Jailer had the keys I thought he was the only one that could and let him free when he wanted to let him free when he thought he had paid enough when he thought he had been punished enough when he thought but he found out the Jailer found out I ain't got the keys somebody else got the keys I love that because the scripture said he let him he leted him out out of the prison pastor the first gate the second gate to the third gate Amen to the door of the house amen what happened God come down in this camp meeting he led you from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and he's LED you to the door amen he led you to a place where you belong why because he has the keys and he's giving people power listen listen you parents back there you got a set of keys your do your daughter may be bound your child may be bound but you have a key just go calling upon the name of Jesus the angel knows what jail housee they're in he knows what barroom they're in he knows what sin they're in and he'll go to where they're at you have the keys this morning cuz you have been given the ability to

have been anointed to win come on musicians come get on these instruments you have been anointed to win you've been given the keys I want us to sing a good old song Old Camp Meeting song When the Saints Go Marching In why are we marching cuz we got the keys why are we Triumph cuz we got the keys why are we Overcomers cuz we got the keys I'm not a loser Hallelujah let me tell you we're not going to go in by the skin of our teeth and barely make it it no sir we're going to go in as Overcomers we're going to go in as more than Victorious Overcomers delivered by the power of almighty [Applause] God hallelujah cuz we have been been anointed we have faith to win I'm not a loser man Satan is a loser man the devil come to you many times before this Camp said you ain't nothing but a

soldiers March they march with their heads up cuz they're not looking down and what's all around them and what's happening around them and all the problems and situation they're looking to the hills which come with their help and they got some Authority in those feet cuz those feet are begin of an authority over every devil of hell and every devil is under them amen I can't help but think of Esther in the Bible amen when she was there all timid and worried what am I going to do the king hasn't called me here and the prophet Mori came and he said you go tell the king what the devil's doing you go tell him about old Wicked hmon you going to tell him what he's doing and you going to say cuz if you don't if you don't God to raise somebody up who will and let me tell you young people if you don't have a winner inside of you and if you don't allow him to have preeminence in your life God to raise somebody up who will cuz God will have an overcomer it's his word and to them that overcometh well I grant to S with me in my throne even as I also overcame he will find somebody who will believe he'll find some somebody who say yes I'm a winner I'm not a loser I am an overcomer I have been Victorious by the blood of the lamb and the word of my [Applause] [Music] [Applause] testimony and when Esther got to the king she realized her thoughts wasn't his thoughts come on she had thoughts she wasn't worthy she hadn't been called but that wasn't his thoughts cuz when she came he goes oh yeah his thoughts was different than her thoughts can I get that across to you this morning God's thoughts are different about you than your thoughts about yourself or what the devil wants to put inside of your mind God has a thinking above and beyond going back to those feet those legs Revelations 10 we saw an angel that came down out of Heaven he put one foot upon the land and one foot on the sea what was that judgment and authority over everything under him my brother Timothy I ain't nothing but the skin on the bottom of his feet what's so what you're still on the feet and if you're still on the foot when your foot goes down every devil is under you every devil is under you every devil is under you every devil is under you every de I can't say it enough every devil is under here amen every devil is under here cuz you have been anointed to win quit using that devil as a difficulty start using him as a stepping stone I'm getting to one side to the other and if I got to walk across every devil to get there so bad but I am going to go marching in to the kingdom of almighty [Music] God y'all heard the story what they do after after hmon was hung they use they they go to have the Feast of pureum where they write his name on the bottom of his feet and every time

devil I'm sorry about that I ain't making peace with the Enemy read your Bible read your Bible Joshua made peace with an enemy that disguised himself and said they was from afar off and they put old clothes on they did all kinds of stuff and they came to him and he made sad of it's inquiring to the word of God who they were he just they said okay we won't we won't go that far that's not part of our land and they find out later they was right there in the land right we are not a people to make peace with the Enemy I don't care what they look like how big they are how small they are how
