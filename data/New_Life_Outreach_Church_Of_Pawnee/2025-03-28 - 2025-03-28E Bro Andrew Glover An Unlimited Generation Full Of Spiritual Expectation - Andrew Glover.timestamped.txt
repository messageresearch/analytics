[3:56] [Music]
[4:05] I
[4:08] saw the harsh and
[4:12] sweet of one who
[4:15] gave only for
[4:20] me. I saw the
[4:23] suffering of his death.
[4:28] and the
[4:30] forgiveness of his final
[4:34] breath. And now I can
[4:38] never be the
[4:42] same. My heart has
[4:45] been
[4:47] forever changed.
[4:50] I want to
[4:52] live in love and give the way he
[5:00] [Music]
[5:04] gave. So now I'm giving my
[5:09] life away.
[5:14] I'm bringing it down at the
[5:19] older while I'm getting my
[5:23] life
[5:27] away. That's the very least I can
[5:33] offer is my
[5:37] own. Here I stand.
[5:43] You're giving my
[5:45] life
[5:48] [Music]
[5:56] away. Weapon may be formed, but it won't
[6:01] prosper. Can you stand and help me sing
[6:04] it now? When the darkness falls, it
[6:07] won't breathe
[6:11] in. Cuz the God I serve knows only how
[6:15] to
[6:18] triumph. And my God will never
[6:26] fail. And my God will never fail.
[6:32] Oh, I'm going to see a
[6:35] victory. I'm going to see a
[6:38] [Music]

[6:45] Lord. Oh, I'm going to see a

[7:09] tonight? Oh, every war he wages. He will
[7:16] win. I'm not backing down from any
[7:21] giant. No, I'm
[7:23] not. Cuz I know how this story ends.

[7:31] Yes, I know how this story
[7:35] ends. Oh, I'm going to see a

[15:21] if you have a need upon your heart, can

[36:18] [Music]
[36:26] [Applause]
[36:33] And I had my
[36:36] sins and I've been stray
[36:40] away. I was lost to the point that I
[36:44] thought I could never change.
[36:48] But he had a
[36:51] purpose and he had a
[36:55] plan. Since he called me by name, I've
[36:59] never been the same.
[37:02] Amen. I got a
[37:06] testimony. I got a song to sing. I got
[37:11] good news to tell you. The king who
[37:14] rescued me.

[37:33] test for me.
[37:39] I've been
[37:41] washed and I've been

[38:35] [Music]
[38:40] testimony. Oh, I can't say it enough.
[38:45] No, I can't praise him enough. No, I
[38:50] never thank him enough for what he's
[38:54] done. Oh, I can't thank him enough. I
[39:00] can't praise him with
[39:03] [Music]
[39:08] enough. I got a
[39:11] testimony. I got a song to sing. I got
[39:16] good news to tell you. The king will

[39:21] me. I put my hope in Jesus. So I got a

[44:53] miracles. Amen. How many believes that
[44:56] tonight? How many believes
[44:58] we we will see miracles?
[45:02] We are seeing
[45:03] miracles. Amen. To think tonight that
[45:07] the Lord has has sent a word in this
[45:09] age. And a prophet of God told us, I
[45:12] heard him say it just before coming to
[45:13] church. He said, "Now you believe that
[45:15] word." And he said, "The miracles will
[45:18] take place on the word." And you know
[45:21] tonight, we're not here believing our
[45:23] feelings or our emotions, but we're
[45:26] believing vindicated word. And brother
[45:28] Ben, there's a direct promise tonight
[45:29] that a miracle will take place. Somebody
[45:32] say, "Well, I'm looking for a miracle."
[45:33] And Amen. How many combed your hair and
[45:36] brushed your teeth and got ready for
[45:38] church tonight? Anybody do that? Three
[45:41] of you? Four of you. You realize when
[45:43] you were doing that and looking in the
[45:45] mirror, you was looking at a miracle in
[45:48] an age of unbelief and infidels and
[45:50] atheists and agnostics. You're a young
[45:52] person and you got a desire in your
[45:55] heart to serve the Lord and to believe
[45:56] his word. And I tell you tonight, you're
[45:58] more of a miracle than you realize.
[46:00] Amen. Amen. How many loves him here
[46:02] tonight? Amen. We want to say God bless
[46:05] you all. My wasn't that a powerful word
[46:07] this morning. Amen. Thank you, brother
[46:09] Timothy, for delivering your heart. That
[46:11] was a very uh needful message in this
[46:14] hour. As our brother said, amen. An age
[46:17] of selfies, an age of self.
[46:21] But God would send us a message this
[46:23] morning and to tell us to rent the veil
[46:26] of self off of our hearts and self-will
[46:28] and let God have his way. Amen. We we
[46:31] sure enjoyed that. It is an honor to say
[46:33] to be here with you tonight and we thank
[46:35] you again, Brother Wendell at New Life
[46:36] Outreach for the opportunity to be here
[46:38] and the the vision for these meetings. I
[46:41] I know there's a lot of workers and a
[46:43] lot of uh helps that goes uh behind a
[46:45] meeting like this, but I want to say
[46:47] this. Amen. Without a pastor, this would
[46:50] not be possible. And brother Wendle, we
[46:52] thank you for the vision and allowing
[46:54] this to happen. Your burden, we support
[46:57] you and we thank you for it. Amen. How
[46:59] many appreciates the man of God for
[47:01] putting these meetings on this weekend?
[47:04] Amen. We we appreciate it. And to all
[47:06] the help, we sure appreciate you all.
[47:09] And Amen. How many preachers do we have
[47:11] in the building tonight? Could you just
[47:12] slip your hand up wherever you are?
[47:14] Amen. I know there's pastors and
[47:16] evangelists and Amen. all over this
[47:18] building, taking time away from their
[47:19] schedules to come and be in these
[47:21] meetings. We thank you. How many young
[47:23] people would just give the Lord a hand
[47:25] clap of praise for these men of God,
[47:27] amen, that have come to show you they're
[47:29] behind you and they're supporting you
[47:32] and they're pulling for you. Amen. God
[47:34] bless you, brothers. We sure appreciate
[47:36] you. And Amen. It is a a real special to
[47:39] be here tonight with brother, of course,
[47:41] Brother Wendell and brother Shawn.
[47:42] They've been huge supports of ours and
[47:44] the ministry and their friendships and
[47:46] Amen. And I was just thinking as just a
[47:49] young minister, amen, these these
[47:51] brothers uh give us an open door to come
[47:53] and speak and amen to minister in the
[47:55] meetings and we sure love and appreciate
[47:57] them and their stand for this message.
[47:58] And it's just good to be here tonight.
[48:00] We do want to bring you greetings from
[48:02] our church there and pastor brother Matt
[48:04] Morris and the saints there at Grace
[48:05] Tabernacle. We have several here with us
[48:07] and a few of them singing tonight. And
[48:09] amen. Brother Matt said to greet you all
[48:11] and amen. Unfortunately, they were
[48:12] unable to be here due to a scheduling
[48:14] conflict, but amen. And it's good to
[48:16] know there's people praying for these
[48:17] meetings. It's not even here. Amen.
[48:20] Miracles are happening. Amen. Before we
[48:22] open the word tonight, let's just bow
[48:23] our hearts together for a word of
[48:25] prayer. I know I know it's already been
[48:27] said. There's many needs among us. But I
[48:30] believe right here tonight with this
[48:31] many this many powerful men of God in
[48:34] this building and this many believers. I
[48:36] believe we can join together and bind
[48:38] the forces of hail. And I believe
[48:40] tonight can be a night of transformation
[48:42] for hearts and lives. Let's just join
[48:44] together. Maybe you would just lay your
[48:45] hand on someone next to you, brother to
[48:48] brother, sister to sister, husband to
[48:49] wife in godly order. And let's just join
[48:52] together and let's just invite him to
[48:55] come tonight. And the foundation has
[48:57] been laid for these meetings. The vision
[48:59] has been given. The work has gone forth.
[49:02] Now it's time. It's time to move into
[49:05] the things of God. Heavenly Father,
[49:07] Lord, as these believers have gathered
[49:09] here this evening on this second evening
[49:11] service of these meetings, Lord, we're
[49:14] not gathered here out of form or
[49:15] fashion, out of ritual or tradition. But
[49:18] Lord, we're gathered here tonight
[49:19] because your prophet said, Lord, that
[49:21] wherever the carcass is, the eagles will
[49:23] be gathered together. And Lord, as I
[49:26] heard him say this morning, he said,
[49:27] many men have tried to stop this word
[49:29] from going forth. He said, "They even
[49:32] give thumbs down on these type of
[49:33] meetings and these type of atmospheres."
[49:36] He said, "But wherever the carcass is,
[49:38] the eagles will come anyhow." And Lord,
[49:40] we know there's many spirits that's
[49:42] battled against these meetings and
[49:43] battled against this church and against
[49:45] the pastor and against the workers and
[49:48] trying to hinder them in the things of
[49:49] these meetings to stop this from
[49:51] happening. But Lord, as we gather our
[49:53] faith together tonight under this great
[49:55] banner of Jehovah, Lord, we want to
[49:57] gladly and proudly tell that devil
[49:59] tonight. Amen. Satan, you did not have
[50:02] enough to stop these meetings. You did
[50:04] not have enough to stop us from being
[50:06] here. And now, Lord, as we gather here
[50:08] tonight, we're not gathering here for
[50:09] entertainment, Lord, but we're gathering
[50:11] here for war. We're gathering here to do
[50:13] battle against the enemies of hell.
[50:16] Lord, we're praying that you would that
[50:17] you would open the windows of heaven
[50:19] tonight, oh God. Lord, as these
[50:21] believers have laid their hands upon one
[50:23] another, I know that wherever there is
[50:25] division, there is no power. But where
[50:28] there is unity, oh God, there is power,
[50:30] there is power to do the impossible. So
[50:32] Lord, as these young people gather
[50:34] together in one mind and one accord
[50:36] tonight, laying aside the cares of life,
[50:39] laying aside the things of the day,
[50:41] putting our shoulder, Amen, and our our
[50:43] vision together to press forward and
[50:45] take the promises of God. I'm asking you
[50:48] tonight, oh Lord, open the windows of
[50:50] heaven. Flood this place with your
[50:52] glory, oh God. Lord, may your anointing
[50:54] reign supremely among our our young
[50:56] people tonight. Lord, may this be a
[50:58] night of transformation, oh God. Lord,
[51:00] may this be a night that we would break
[51:02] out of one dimension, oh God, and we
[51:04] would step into another dimension. For
[51:06] Lord, these meetings are not just to be
[51:08] in this earthly dimension, but they're
[51:10] to break out into another dimension,
[51:12] Lord, where these young people can
[51:13] fellowship with you unhindered, Lord, un
[51:16] unrestricted, oh God. Now, Father, we
[51:18] ask you, help us to get ourselves out of
[51:20] the way tonight. And if there be any
[51:22] sick among us, Lord, as your word goes
[51:24] forth, may there come great healings and
[51:26] deliverances, oh God, Lord, for those
[51:28] that are wrestling, Lord, in the
[51:30] presence of God, and they know it's the
[51:32] time to surrender. They know it's the
[51:33] time to give in, but the devil is piling
[51:36] everything he can upon them to hinder
[51:38] them from giving in. Satan, in the name
[51:40] of Jesus, I charge thee by the power of
[51:43] the living God, I condemn you in the
[51:44] name of the Lord. Take your spirits of
[51:47] resistance back to the hell you brought
[51:49] them out of and let liberty reign in the
[51:51] hearts of believers tonight to fully
[51:53] surrender unto the things of God. Lord,
[51:56] your prophet said when we fully
[51:57] surrender, Amen. then you will come in
[52:00] fully. And Lord, tonight we want to
[52:02] fully surrender and we want you to come
[52:04] into these meetings fully, Lord, into
[52:06] our hearts fully. Oh God, we love you
[52:08] tonight, Lord. Forgive us of our
[52:10] failures and shortcomings. A Lord, draw
[52:13] us together tonight by the bond of love.
[52:16] And we'll be sure to stand back and give
[52:17] thee all the praise, all the honor, and
[52:20] all the glory for you're the mighty God.
[52:22] You're the everlasting father. And Lord,
[52:24] you're worthy of all of our praise here
[52:26] tonight. Now Lord, as we commit this
[52:28] service into thy faithful hands, have
[52:30] your way among us in the name of our
[52:32] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray.
[52:35] And all the believers says, "Amen." And
[52:38] amen. God bless you tonight. If you have
[52:41] your Bibles while you're
[52:43] standing, Amen. I believe he's in the
[52:45] room, don't you? Amen. The book of Job,
[52:47] the fifth chapter. The book of Job, the
[52:50] fifth chapter. I want to look in Job.
[52:52] And then we're going to go to Mark 9. In
[52:54] Job chapter 5, I want to read here in
[52:57] the eth verse of Job 5. Job here
[53:02] writing, he says, "Now I would seek unto
[53:05] God and unto God would I commit my
[53:09] cause, which doeth great things and
[53:13] unsearchable, marvelous things without
[53:16] number." Somebody say, "Great things."
[53:19] Great. Marvelous things without number.
[53:23] who giveth rain upon the earth, and
[53:25] sendeth water upon the fields. Now, I
[53:28] love this. To set up on high those that
[53:31] be low, and those which mourn may be
[53:34] exalted to safety. Look at verse 12. He
[53:38] disappointeth the devices of the crafty,
[53:42] so that their hands cannot perform their
[53:45] enterprise. God gave you a promise,
[53:48] young people, that he would bind the
[53:50] hand of your enemy, that he could not
[53:53] bring to pass his desire for your life.
[53:56] Now, in the book of St. Mark, chapter 9,
[53:59] St. Mark chapter 9 and verse number 23,
[54:03] St. Mark 9 and verse 23, you love the
[54:07] Lord tonight.
[54:09] Mark 9 and 23. Jesus here speaking. and
[54:13] he's just healed the the the son of the
[54:16] epileptic and the demonic spirits have
[54:18] been have been raging in his life and
[54:20] Jesus has just healed him. And in the
[54:22] 23rd verse, Jesus said unto him, "If
[54:26] thou canst
[54:28] believe, some things are possible to him
[54:32] that believeth.
[54:33] A few things are possible." No. If thou
[54:38] canst believe, all things. Can I say all
[54:42] things are great things?
[54:44] They are marvelous things and they
[54:47] cannot be numbered. All things are
[54:49] possible to him that believeth. We ask
[54:53] the Lord this evening to add the
[54:54] blessing to the reading of his word as
[54:55] you can have your seats here this
[54:57] afternoon. I want to by the help of the
[54:59] Lord if I would take a title tonight to
[55:01] speak to you here. Uh the spirit of the
[55:03] Lord's drawn my heart and attention to
[55:05] some things here tonight. And if I would
[55:07] title this, I want to speak to you on
[55:08] this. An unlimited generation full of
[55:12] spiritual expectations. An unlimited
[55:16] generation full of spiritual
[55:18] expectations. I love what Jesus said
[55:21] when he said, "If thou can't believe."
[55:23] Now, Brother Brandon tells us very
[55:25] beautiful. He says, "Now you don't have
[55:27] to feel anything." He said, "You don't
[55:29] have to see anything." He said, "But you
[55:32] do have to believe something." Amen.
[55:34] Amen. You may not feel it. You may not
[55:36] see it. But you must believe something.
[55:38] Amen. Because all things are not
[55:40] possible to them that feel something or
[55:42] see something, but it is possible to
[55:44] them that believe something. And brother
[55:46] Brandham would say it like that. And
[55:48] when I look here at this word believe,
[55:50] it is used in the New Testament of the
[55:52] conviction and the trust to which a man,
[55:54] amen, is impaled by a certain inner and
[55:57] higher prerogative, amen, and law of
[56:00] soul. It is to trust in God, amen, as
[56:03] able to aid either in obtaining or in
[56:06] doing something. It is the mere
[56:08] acknowledgment, amen, of some fact or
[56:10] some event. So when you begin to
[56:12] believe, it is actually going beyond the
[56:14] realms of your flesh and it's going
[56:16] beyond the realms of your spirit, but
[56:19] actually it's moving into the realms of
[56:21] your soul. Amen. Where there is a law of
[56:23] your soul that allows you to believe
[56:25] things, amen, that your flesh will not
[56:27] allow you to believe. Amen. Your soul
[56:29] will allow you to believe things. Amen.
[56:32] That your spirit will not allow you to
[56:34] believe. I love that word. All things
[56:36] are possible. Amen. To him that
[56:38] believeth. When you look at that word
[56:40] possible, amen, it is strong in soul.
[56:43] Amen. It is strong in influence. Now,
[56:45] when I look at you tonight, I want to
[56:47] just tell you, Amen. As a prophet would
[56:49] say, Amen. Here is my estimation of you.
[56:52] Amen. You are a generation of the
[56:54] uncarchable riches. You are a generation
[56:57] that is partaking. Amen. Or you are
[56:59] drinking from an inexhaustible fountain.
[57:02] You are a generation that has been
[57:04] prophesied over. Amen. By the prophet of
[57:06] God who said, "Amen, that there are
[57:08] untapped resources." Amen. Amen. There
[57:11] are promises that are untapped. Amen.
[57:13] There are there are miracles. There are
[57:15] there are things that God has promised
[57:17] in this age. Let me just say this. You
[57:19] are not the church of tomorrow. You're
[57:21] not the church of next year or the
[57:23] church of two years from now. Amen. But
[57:25] you are the church of today. Amen.
[57:28] Because tomorrow is not promised. I love
[57:30] what a prophet said. He said, "I believe
[57:32] that his church, amen, is his
[57:35] representative on the earth." Now, when
[57:38] you look here in the message, redemption
[57:39] by power, he said, I am positive of this
[57:42] one thing, amen, that God will have a
[57:45] church without spot, without wrinkle or
[57:47] blemish. Another place he said, I am
[57:49] positive, sure this morning, that if men
[57:52] and women could only get into the
[57:54] position of where their soul, their
[57:56] thinking, and their attitudes, Amen,
[57:58] would be perfect in the sight of God. He
[58:01] said that would be one of the most
[58:02] powerful churches, amen, that ever
[58:05] existed. Amen. When you get your
[58:07] thinking, your soul, and your attitude,
[58:09] Amen, in line with the word of God,
[58:12] Amen, in the sight of God, then that is
[58:14] going to release you, Amen, to be the
[58:16] most powerful church on the face of the
[58:18] earth. He said if the church of the
[58:20] living God which is the pillar of truth,
[58:23] he said God intended, amen, that this
[58:25] church to be a powerful church, amen, a
[58:28] glorious church, a church, amen, that
[58:31] the whole world could look upon, Amen,
[58:33] as a bride of Christ, well expected and
[58:36] espoused. Now listen young people. Amen.
[58:39] To live in such an atmosphere. Amen. Not
[58:42] visit that atmosphere. Amen. but to live
[58:45] in such an atmosphere and to conduct
[58:47] itself in such a way that God would be
[58:50] proud of this church. Amen. To present
[58:52] it to Christ at the coming of the Lord.
[58:55] I say to you tonight, the message of the
[58:57] hour, amen, came by the Malachi for
[59:00] Elijah. It came for one purpose that is
[59:03] to move you into the atmosphere, amen,
[59:05] of expectation. This message come, amen,
[59:08] to grip you. It come to move you. It
[59:10] come to elect you. It come to capture
[59:13] you. It come to apprehend you. It come
[59:15] to select you. Amen. To be a
[59:18] participant, amen, in the rapture and in
[59:21] the resurrection. Listen, the message of
[59:23] the hour came, amen, to set you an
[59:26] expectation for what God has promised in
[59:28] his word to be fulfilled in your life. I
[59:32] want to tell that devil tonight, amen,
[59:34] there is a church of the living God that
[59:36] is on the face of the earth tonight. And
[59:38] we're not a powerless church. We're not
[59:40] a formal church. We're not a lukewarm,
[59:42] watered down, sour church. We are a
[59:45] powerful church because God has
[59:47] revealed, amen, his mind to this age.
[59:50] Hey, when I think about this church, how
[59:52] can I speak of you and not speak of
[59:54] Jesus's forecast in the book of Luke 24
[59:58] when he said, "Behold, I send the
[59:59] promise of my father upon you." Amen.
[1:00:02] But tear ye in the city of Jerusalem
[1:00:05] until you be endued, amen, with power
[1:00:07] from on high. Listen to what he said in
[1:00:10] the Amplified Bible. I am sending the
[1:00:12] promise of my father. Amen. The Holy
[1:00:14] Spirit upon you, but you are to remain
[1:00:17] in the city of Jerusalem. Now listen,
[1:00:20] until you are clothed or you are fully
[1:00:23] equipped, amen, with power from on high.
[1:00:26] In the emphatic dagot, he said, "Behold,
[1:00:29] I send forth the promise of my father
[1:00:31] upon you." Amen. But remain you in the
[1:00:34] city. Amen. until you are invested,
[1:00:36] amen, with power from on high. So the
[1:00:39] promise of the father, amen, was the
[1:00:42] coming of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:44] Now listen, it was going to do more than
[1:00:46] just make you speak in tongues. It was
[1:00:48] going to do more than just make you
[1:00:50] shout. It was going to do more than just
[1:00:52] make you dance. But the Holy Ghost was
[1:00:54] prophesied, amen, to be your equipment,
[1:00:57] amen, to whip the devil in the age
[1:00:59] you're living in. The Holy Ghost was
[1:01:01] prophesied, amen, to be the investment
[1:01:03] of God. Listen. Amen. Listen. I'll just
[1:01:06] say this. Amen. God has invested in you,
[1:01:08] young people. Amen. He has invested in
[1:01:11] you. He has invested you his word. He
[1:01:13] has invested in you his power. He has
[1:01:16] invested in you his ability. You say,
[1:01:18] "What is that power?" Amen. That power,
[1:01:21] amen, is the power for performing
[1:01:23] miracles. It is inherent power. It is
[1:01:26] power residing in a thing. Amen. By
[1:01:28] virtue of its nature. Amen. Let me say
[1:01:31] this. This power, amen, is not just
[1:01:34] resting upon you. This power is living
[1:01:37] in you. This is more than just the Holy
[1:01:39] Ghost on your flesh. It is more than
[1:01:41] just the Holy Ghost on your spirit. Hey,
[1:01:44] this is the true baptism of the Holy
[1:01:46] Ghost, which Paul said, Amen, would seal
[1:01:49] a man until the day of his redemption.
[1:01:51] Brother Sean, I am a firm believer if
[1:01:54] the Holy Ghost ever seals a person,
[1:01:56] they're not just sealed from one service
[1:01:58] to the next. They're not just sealed
[1:02:00] from one camp to the next, but they are
[1:02:02] sealed until the day of their
[1:02:04] redemption. Listen, if you ever get the
[1:02:06] Holy Ghost on your soul, it'll seal the
[1:02:08] devil out, and it'll seal the power of
[1:02:11] God in. It'll seal the world out. It'll
[1:02:13] seal leoty out and it'll seal the things
[1:02:16] of God into your soul. Yes, sir. You're
[1:02:20] more than just a bunch of young people
[1:02:22] gathered here this weekend. You are an
[1:02:24] army that Joel prophesied when he said
[1:02:26] there would be a restoration. And he
[1:02:28] said there would be a great army. I
[1:02:30] believe that's this army here tonight.
[1:02:32] See what God said was I will send the
[1:02:34] Holy Spirit. Amen. To fulfill the
[1:02:37] promise of the father. Jesus said you
[1:02:40] shall receive power. Amen. After that
[1:02:43] the Holy Ghost has come upon you. If we
[1:02:46] know what the Holy Ghost is, then we
[1:02:48] know what the Holy Ghost is not. Can I
[1:02:51] say this? And the Holy Ghost is the
[1:02:53] spirit of Jesus Christ in you.
[1:02:58] The Holy Ghost is the power of God that
[1:03:00] has been sent into your heart. Thank
[1:03:02] you, buddy. As a witness of the spirit,
[1:03:05] you are born again. Your life is cleaned
[1:03:07] up. The world is dead and all the stink
[1:03:10] of it is like the garlic in Egypt. You
[1:03:12] are far away from it. You are a new
[1:03:15] creature in Christ Jesus. Old things has
[1:03:18] passed away and you become new
[1:03:20] altogether. You are a new creation and
[1:03:23] you are born of the spirit. Listen, your
[1:03:26] whole members of your body is submissive
[1:03:29] to his spirit and you're moving in the
[1:03:31] Holy Ghost and you're not listening to
[1:03:34] the sound of the world. Amen. Your eyes
[1:03:37] are on heavenly things. Let me say this.
[1:03:40] It's time to get your eyes, amen, off of
[1:03:42] what this preacher's doing and what this
[1:03:44] church is doing and what this person's
[1:03:46] doing. It's time to look away at Jesus.
[1:03:49] It's time to get your eyes on the
[1:03:51] heavenly things. Listen, can I say
[1:03:53] something to you? It's time to get your
[1:03:55] eyes off your mistakes. It's time to get
[1:03:57] your eyes off your humanity. It's time
[1:04:00] to get your eyes, Amen, off of who hurt
[1:04:02] you and who disappointed you and who let
[1:04:04] you down and who It's time to get your
[1:04:06] eyes off of all of that. And it's time
[1:04:08] to turn ye northward. We have compass
[1:04:10] this mountain long enough. It's time to
[1:04:13] go to victory. It's time to go to joy
[1:04:15] unspeakable. Listen, it's time to quit
[1:04:18] looking at what has been and start
[1:04:20] looking at what will be. It's time to
[1:04:22] quit looking at what happened and start
[1:04:24] looking at what God said would happen
[1:04:26] when he poured his spirit out and people
[1:04:29] received the Holy Ghost. I know you got
[1:04:32] mistakes. I got mistakes. Brother Wendle
[1:04:34] stood here today and said since he got
[1:04:36] the Holy Ghost, made mistakes, fallen
[1:04:38] short. Amen. Any preacher tell you they
[1:04:40] ain't made a mistake, I'll go help you
[1:04:42] tell you what they are. They're a liar.
[1:04:44] Amen. Cuz they're humans. But can I say
[1:04:46] this? We have a sacrifice. Hey, we have
[1:04:49] an atonement. We have an advocate with
[1:04:52] the father. And I tell you what it's
[1:04:54] time to do. It's time to quit looking at
[1:04:56] your mistakes and start looking at your
[1:04:59] sacrifice. Brother Bram said, "As long
[1:05:01] as we look back, amen, to what we was."
[1:05:04] Somebody say, "What we was." As long as
[1:05:07] we look back to what we was, he said the
[1:05:09] sacrifice means nothing to us. Well, we
[1:05:13] might as well preach on that point. As
[1:05:15] long as you're looking back, Amen. to
[1:05:18] when you was this and you was that and
[1:05:20] you was doing this and and maybe some of
[1:05:22] you young people right now say, "Well, I
[1:05:24] don't have all that to look back at."
[1:05:26] But I'll say this. Amen. Our young
[1:05:28] people face things, amen, in this age
[1:05:30] that generations never faced. Amen. But
[1:05:33] let me say this. If you can get your
[1:05:35] eyes, amen, off of your past and get it
[1:05:38] on your atonement, then you'll begin to
[1:05:40] see your future.
[1:05:42] Brother Ram said, "See, look what that
[1:05:44] day on Calvary did for you." So the Holy
[1:05:47] Ghost then is not power, amen, from the
[1:05:50] church. It's not power from the bishop.
[1:05:52] Amen. The Holy Ghost, Amen, is power
[1:05:55] from on high. Let me say this. The Holy
[1:05:57] Ghost is not a handshake. Hey, the Holy
[1:06:00] Ghost is not a church letter. Amen. The
[1:06:02] Holy Ghost is not putting your name on a
[1:06:04] church book or or going to a certain
[1:06:06] church. Amen. The Holy Ghost, Amen, is
[1:06:08] the literal life of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:06:11] tabernacling on the inside of you and
[1:06:14] demonstrating to the world that our God
[1:06:16] is not in a grave in Jerusalem. Neither
[1:06:19] is he in a tomb in Jeffersonville. But
[1:06:21] the same Lord Jesus that walked the
[1:06:24] shores of Galilee. Brother Judah is
[1:06:26] right here tonight. And he's here and
[1:06:28] he's not here on his way to Calvary.
[1:06:31] He's already been to Calvary. He's not
[1:06:34] here on his way to deliver you. He's
[1:06:36] already delivered you. He's not here on
[1:06:38] his way to die for you. He's already
[1:06:41] died for you. It's time to open your
[1:06:43] eyes and accept the revelation. It's a
[1:06:46] finished work. And there ain't no devil
[1:06:48] coming. Ain't no devil here. And there
[1:06:50] ain't no devil that's been here that can
[1:06:53] defeat a son and daughter of God on
[1:06:55] their way to meet a promise of God.
[1:06:58] Yeah, I believe it. I believe the Holy
[1:07:00] Spirit is an experience of being filled
[1:07:02] and endued with power for service.
[1:07:06] Brother said it very beautiful. His
[1:07:07] spirit is in you. And I'll say this. You
[1:07:09] say, "Well, I've been baptized and amen.
[1:07:12] I I've been I've been seeking the Holy
[1:07:14] Ghost." Let me tell you this. God is
[1:07:15] under obligation, amen, to give every
[1:07:18] believer the Holy Ghost. And you say,
[1:07:21] "Well, I don't know if he wants to."
[1:07:23] Thank God for a prophet. He said he's
[1:07:25] more willing to give it to you than you
[1:07:27] are to receive it. He said, "For God is
[1:07:30] under obligation." Amen. To fulfill his
[1:07:34] word. Can I say this to you? In the book
[1:07:37] of Acts, the second and third chapter,
[1:07:39] you will find a little word that is very
[1:07:41] much overlooked today. It's called
[1:07:44] repentance. Amen. It's something hardly
[1:07:46] nobody wants to do anymore cuz
[1:07:48] everybody's right. Everybody's motive is
[1:07:51] right. Ain't nobody wrong no more. Amen.
[1:07:53] But let me tell you what the Bible said.
[1:07:55] The Bible said, "You shall repent of
[1:07:57] your sins and you shall be baptized and
[1:08:00] you shall receive the Holy Ghost." So
[1:08:02] that tells me there was a repentance
[1:08:05] that was preceding a receiving of the
[1:08:07] Holy Ghost. In Acts chapter 3, the Bible
[1:08:10] said that Jesus would be preached unto
[1:08:12] you. Amen. And the same Jesus that was
[1:08:15] here before would be preached again, but
[1:08:17] this time it would be, Amen. a
[1:08:20] refreshing from the presence of the
[1:08:21] Lord. But I love what he says. He said,
[1:08:24] "But repent that your sins would be
[1:08:26] blotted out, that when the times of
[1:08:29] refreshing shall come from the presence
[1:08:31] of the Lord, then ye shall be
[1:08:33] refreshed." Oh, I say this. Amen. It's
[1:08:36] time to repent of the thing and it's
[1:08:38] time to go on. It's time to quit walling
[1:08:40] in it and laying around in it and trying
[1:08:42] to figure out how you got in it. Hey,
[1:08:44] there is a blood and there is an
[1:08:46] atonement and there is a sea of
[1:08:48] forgetfulness. You know what the sea of
[1:08:50] forgetfulness is? It's the blood of
[1:08:52] Jesus Christ. And if your sins are in
[1:08:55] the sea of God's forgetfulness, it's
[1:08:57] time to turn your shoes, amen, from sad
[1:08:59] shoes, amen, to shouting shoes, it's
[1:09:02] time to turn your sorrow into joy. You
[1:09:05] have been repented of. You have been
[1:09:07] forgiven. Now it's time to receive a
[1:09:10] refreshing from the presence of God.
[1:09:12] Yes, sir. Amen. There is a reason why
[1:09:14] Satan wants to stop that repentance
[1:09:17] because he knows the next thing after a
[1:09:20] repentance is power. The next thing
[1:09:23] after a repentance is power. The devil
[1:09:26] knows if you thoroughly repent and
[1:09:28] believe on the Lord and you don't
[1:09:30] receive the Holy Ghost, then you make
[1:09:32] God a liar. What a prophet said. But I
[1:09:36] love what my Bible said. God is not a
[1:09:38] man that he should lie and neither is he
[1:09:41] the son of man that he should repent.
[1:09:43] Can I say this to you? You don't have to
[1:09:46] wait five minutes after repentance to
[1:09:48] receive that power. You don't have to
[1:09:50] wait 5 seconds after a repentance to
[1:09:53] receive that power. Come on man by the
[1:09:55] gate of beautiful. You've been laying
[1:09:57] there for years. But the minute God
[1:09:59] healed him, he didn't have to wait five
[1:10:01] more minutes in that condition.
[1:10:03] Immediately he received strength and he
[1:10:05] stood up on his feet. Well, I'll say
[1:10:07] this. There is a young person here
[1:10:09] tonight that's been sitting there in a
[1:10:11] repented condition long enough. It's
[1:10:13] time to get up and put your shoes on.
[1:10:16] Put your clothes on, Peter. It's time to
[1:10:18] walk out of the prison house of
[1:10:20] condemnation. It's time to walk out of
[1:10:22] the prison house of guilt. You are an
[1:10:25] eagle. And you were not born for that
[1:10:27] prison house. You were born for the
[1:10:29] heavenlies. Stay down there and cluck
[1:10:30] around if you want to, but there's some
[1:10:32] eagles here tonight that were born for
[1:10:35] heavenly places. They were born to soar
[1:10:37] in the unknowns with Almighty
[1:10:40] God. I ain't staying down there any
[1:10:43] longer. I was born for heavenly places.
[1:10:45] I was born to experience the power of
[1:10:47] God. I was born to shout. I was born to
[1:10:51] dance. I was born to run around the
[1:10:53] sanctuary. I was born to march the walls
[1:10:56] of Jericho down. I know who I am.
[1:11:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You say, "What
[1:11:04] are you talking about?" I'll say, "This
[1:11:06] power belongs to God." Do you know the
[1:11:10] Bible says he divided the seas by his
[1:11:14] power? Do you know the Bible said that,
[1:11:17] brother, he holds the mountains in place
[1:11:20] by his power. Now, come on, church.
[1:11:23] There ain't no rebar out there holding
[1:11:25] Mount
[1:11:26] Everest. There ain't there ain't no
[1:11:28] There ain't no walls holding the
[1:11:29] Atlantic Sea and the and the Pacific
[1:11:31] Ocean in their place. The power of God
[1:11:34] is doing it. Can I say what a prophet
[1:11:36] said? He said, "Who's got more power
[1:11:38] than God?" He said, "So what kind of
[1:11:41] power have you got over you to take care
[1:11:44] of you? The whole powers that created
[1:11:47] the universe." My goodness. You say,
[1:11:50] "Brother Andrew, there's no way I can
[1:11:51] live this." Well, go tell the mountains
[1:11:53] there's no way they can stay in their
[1:11:55] position. You know why they're in their
[1:11:57] position? Because they're not holding
[1:11:59] themselves. They were in gold. They were
[1:12:02] girded. They were equipped by the power
[1:12:05] of God to stay in their position. I want
[1:12:07] to tell every long tongue devil tonight.
[1:12:10] There is a power of God that has
[1:12:11] returned to the church of God. Satan,
[1:12:14] you might have moved other generations,
[1:12:16] but this is a Caleb and Joshua
[1:12:18] generation. And you could better move
[1:12:20] the mountains than you can move one of
[1:12:22] these young
[1:12:26] people. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You say,
[1:12:29] "Why are you saying this?" I'll say what
[1:12:30] a prophet said. He said, "There I was in
[1:12:32] my room and he said, the power of God
[1:12:35] swept in there." You know what it said?
[1:12:37] Pick up your pen and write. He said, "I
[1:12:39] pick up my pen and begin to write and
[1:12:41] this is what I wrote. The virgin, the
[1:12:43] members of the virgin bride, they will
[1:12:45] love him." Are you ready for this? And
[1:12:47] they will have his potentials for he is
[1:12:50] their head and all power belongs to him.
[1:12:53] They are subject to him as the members
[1:12:56] of our body. Amen. Are subject to our
[1:12:58] heads. Let me say this. The potentials
[1:13:01] of God is on the inside of every
[1:13:03] believer. And let me just say it very
[1:13:05] plainly. It's one thing if there's just
[1:13:08] two or three here, but if there's a
[1:13:10] hundred or 200 or 300 or 500. Amen. Can
[1:13:13] I say this? Amen. What power is in this
[1:13:16] building tonight? I'll tell you what
[1:13:18] kind of power is in this building is the
[1:13:20] same power that stepped out on the
[1:13:22] invisible platform and said, "Let there
[1:13:24] be a sun. Let there be a moon. Let there
[1:13:26] be creation." Hey, that same power of
[1:13:29] deity has dropped down into every Holy
[1:13:31] Ghost healed believer. It's time to step
[1:13:34] up on the invisible platform and look
[1:13:36] that devil in the face and say, "Enough
[1:13:39] is enough. You have held me as long as
[1:13:43] you're going to hold me. Bitterness has
[1:13:45] controlled me as long as it's going to
[1:13:47] control me. Hatred and unforgiveness has
[1:13:50] controlled me as long as it's going to
[1:13:53] control me. I am a part of an unlimited
[1:13:59] generation. Hallelujah. The power of God
[1:14:02] is upholding all things by the word of
[1:14:05] his power. Now, I just got to say it the
[1:14:07] way I believe it. We are not partially
[1:14:10] equipped. We are not halfway equipped.
[1:14:13] Let me say this. God don't call the
[1:14:16] equipped. Oh, but he sure equips the
[1:14:19] called.
[1:14:21] You say, "Brother Andrew, there ain't no
[1:14:22] way God could ever use me." You're
[1:14:24] exactly right. If you're equipped, but
[1:14:26] if you're not equipped, come on up on
[1:14:28] the invisible platform and stand there
[1:14:30] as a son of God. You say, "Brother
[1:14:32] Andrew, there's no way that God can use
[1:14:34] me to sing." Amen. There's no way. I
[1:14:36] know the devil says this. He said,
[1:14:38] "Well, you got the potentials of God,
[1:14:40] but your mistakes are hindering those
[1:14:42] potentials." But there is a blood,
[1:14:44] folks. There is a repentance. There is a
[1:14:46] forgiveness. We're not a bunch of
[1:14:48] Catholics. Amen. going from one camp to
[1:14:50] another. Listen, I'll just say it. Our
[1:14:52] youth camps are not purgatory. It's not
[1:14:54] where you come and and try to pay for
[1:14:56] what you've done. It's a place of
[1:14:58] transformation. It's a place of liberty.
[1:15:01] It's a place for rejoicing. It's a place
[1:15:03] for praise. It's a place for worship. I
[1:15:05] say, God, forsake the day that we ever
[1:15:08] get to a place that we lose the liberty
[1:15:10] to praise. Amen. The God of the
[1:15:13] impossible. That we lose the liberty.
[1:15:15] Amen. To worship in the liberty
[1:15:17] wherewith we have been called. I'm going
[1:15:18] to go ahead and say it or I'm going to
[1:15:20] bust. I am sick and tired of that devil
[1:15:22] trying to balance praise, trying to
[1:15:24] balance worship, trying to balance the
[1:15:26] Holy Ghost. Somebody say, "Well, we got
[1:15:28] church order." You're exactly right. But
[1:15:30] church order did not come to put the
[1:15:32] Holy Ghost in order. Church order did
[1:15:34] not come, amen, to restrict the movement
[1:15:37] of the Holy Ghost. Church order come to
[1:15:39] bind the devil that tries to bring
[1:15:41] anything in the church, amen, contrary
[1:15:44] to the message of the hour.
[1:15:48] God don't call the eclipt. Oh, but he
[1:15:51] sure eclipse the called. What are you
[1:15:53] saying? I'm saying there's only two
[1:15:55] powers. There's only two kingdoms in the
[1:15:58] universe. Now, regardless of all the
[1:16:00] differences, the prophet of God said
[1:16:02] there's God's power and there's Satan's
[1:16:04] power. He said every war, every
[1:16:06] disorder, everything that comes along is
[1:16:09] either controlled, amen, by God's power
[1:16:12] or by Satan's power. He said, now
[1:16:14] there's the power of life. Amen. And
[1:16:16] then there is the power of death. He
[1:16:18] said, "Now Satan, his power that he's
[1:16:21] got is the perverted power of God." I
[1:16:25] love to read this quote to him. He says,
[1:16:27] "It isn't no real power."
[1:16:32] The devil's power isn't no real power.
[1:16:36] It's a perversion of God's power. See,
[1:16:39] everything Satan has is a perversion.
[1:16:42] So, we are sitting here today. Amen. and
[1:16:45] one or the other powers is going to
[1:16:48] control us. Now, let me say this, this
[1:16:51] message is a message of restoration. So,
[1:16:54] all the way back in the beginning,
[1:16:56] brother Carter, God promised to restore
[1:16:59] the original power. But here's what he
[1:17:01] said. I will restore, sayeth the Lord,
[1:17:04] amen, all the years. Jehovah Gyrus 64.
[1:17:06] Now, let me show you what a prophet
[1:17:08] said. He said, I will send back another
[1:17:11] church.
[1:17:13] Did I read that right? I will send back
[1:17:16] another church in the last days. I will
[1:17:19] restore that original power again. In
[1:17:22] the evening time it shall be light.
[1:17:26] Listen folks, this power was going to be
[1:17:28] restored. Amen. Not in just book form,
[1:17:31] not in just paid form. It was going to
[1:17:34] be restored in flesh form, which is the
[1:17:37] church of the living God. Let me say
[1:17:39] this. Original power is real power. He
[1:17:42] said there's been so much mockery in
[1:17:44] every phase of religion, but there is a
[1:17:46] real power of the Holy Spirit that
[1:17:48] delivers the human being from the
[1:17:51] bondage of sin. There is a real power of
[1:17:53] the Holy Spirit that delivers the
[1:17:56] sufferer from his suffering. Hey, I love
[1:17:58] how Brother says stuff. He said, "I'm so
[1:18:00] sick and tired of human philosophy. I
[1:18:02] want to see the real power of God
[1:18:05] demonstrate and move among his people
[1:18:07] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:18:10] today, and forever. Amen. Proving
[1:18:13] himself. You said, "Brother Andrew, what
[1:18:14] is the real power?" The real power of
[1:18:17] the resurrected Christ. Amen. Is the
[1:18:19] real Pentecostal blessing. Listen,
[1:18:21] saints, it is the confirmation of the
[1:18:25] resurrection. When you receive the Holy
[1:18:28] Ghost, you are receiving a confirmation
[1:18:31] of the resurrection. See, now now I want
[1:18:33] to slow down and say this. The world has
[1:18:36] the wrong understanding of what power
[1:18:38] is. Remember said, how could Satan take
[1:18:41] that man and could be a god and how he
[1:18:43] could say that man could take the
[1:18:44] challenge of a priest and let a drunken
[1:18:46] soldier spit in his face? He said,
[1:18:48] "Today we got the wrong conception of
[1:18:51] power." He said, "Power is overcoming."
[1:18:54] Listen, it's returning good for evil. So
[1:18:58] power is overcoming returning good for
[1:19:01] evil. He said that's real power. He said
[1:19:04] they can love your enemy and can do good
[1:19:06] to those that do evil to you. Amen.
[1:19:09] That's real power. Amen. That's God's
[1:19:12] power. Amen. So here it is. The real
[1:19:15] power of God. Amen. Is with the
[1:19:17] mechanics and the dynamics. Now I want
[1:19:20] to say this to you. Amen. The devil,
[1:19:22] amen, has a perverted power. Amen. But
[1:19:25] God has, Amen, a real power. As a matter
[1:19:29] of fact, he is the real power. Can I say
[1:19:32] it like this? Amen. Satan's power is
[1:19:35] limited. The power of Satan is limited,
[1:19:39] but the power of God is unlimited. What
[1:19:42] are you saying? Can I show you
[1:19:44] something? The prophet God said way back
[1:19:46] before the foundation of the world when
[1:19:48] Satan perverted to evil. But God being
[1:19:50] infinite, he looked down to the stream
[1:19:52] of time and he saw the end. He saw
[1:19:55] fornowledge. If he don't know all
[1:19:57] things, then you have a limited God.
[1:20:00] You've made him finite like you and I.
[1:20:02] But let's just shout it aloud. Okay? But
[1:20:04] God is
[1:20:06] unlimited. Hey, hallelujah. God is
[1:20:10] unlimited. He said God's power, God's
[1:20:13] knowledge, everything. He is the
[1:20:15] omnipotent God.
[1:20:18] Do you believe that? You say, "Brother
[1:20:20] Drew, Amen. Satan's power is not
[1:20:22] limited." Oh, yes it is. And I want to
[1:20:24] say something else. It limits you. The
[1:20:28] power of Satan is a limited power. But
[1:20:30] it also limits you. Y'all ever been in a
[1:20:33] service, Amen. And the power of God's
[1:20:35] moving and the Holy Ghost is falling and
[1:20:37] all of a sudden the anointing breaks
[1:20:38] out. Amen. And the service reaches a
[1:20:40] certain height. Amen. And the preacher
[1:20:42] keeps preaching and then it's like it
[1:20:44] never goes any higher for you. Amen. Can
[1:20:46] I say something to you? Amen. There are
[1:20:48] things in our lives that can limit us
[1:20:50] from going to the next level. Oh my.
[1:20:53] There are things in our heart that can
[1:20:55] limit us from going to the next level.
[1:20:57] But let me say this. Amen. God is
[1:21:00] unlimited. When you look at this word
[1:21:02] limited, it is restricted in size. It is
[1:21:05] restricted in amount or extent. It is
[1:21:07] few. It is small. It is short. It is of
[1:21:09] a person that is not great in ability or
[1:21:12] talents. I love the word unlimited.
[1:21:14] Amen. It's having an infinite number of
[1:21:17] solutions. Amen. So when something is
[1:21:20] limited, it can only go so far. When
[1:21:22] something is limited, it can only
[1:21:24] perform so far. But when something is
[1:21:27] unlimited, there is no restrictions on
[1:21:30] how far it can go. When something is
[1:21:32] unlimited, you cannot drown them in the
[1:21:34] Red Sea. You cannot block them behind
[1:21:36] the walls of Jericho. You cannot kill
[1:21:38] him in the lion's den. You cannot burn
[1:21:40] him in the fiery furnace. You cannot
[1:21:42] destroy him in the bulling grease on the
[1:21:44] aisle of Patmas. There is nothing you
[1:21:46] can do. Amen. To a God who is unlimited.
[1:21:49] Wherever you put him, he will be the
[1:21:52] unlimited God in your
[1:21:56] life. Now I know what we say. We say our
[1:21:59] God is unlimited. And we shout
[1:22:01] hallelujah. Our God is unlimited.
[1:22:04] Hallelujah. Well, let me say what a
[1:22:06] prophet said. He said if you can limit
[1:22:08] God, then you can limit Christ. And if
[1:22:10] you limit the church today in its
[1:22:13] possibilities, listen, you are limiting
[1:22:16] Christ. When you limit God, you're
[1:22:19] limiting Christ. And when you limit
[1:22:21] Christ, you are limiting the church.
[1:22:23] Because all that was in God, he poured
[1:22:26] into Christ. And all that is in Christ,
[1:22:29] he has poured into the church. Now, can
[1:22:32] I just say it? If God is in you, oh God,
[1:22:36] if God is in you by the baptism of the
[1:22:40] Holy Ghost, that tells me you are an
[1:22:43] unlimited generation. If God is in you
[1:22:46] by the power of God, you are unlimited.
[1:22:49] Can I say this? There is no restriction
[1:22:52] on the places you can go in God. There
[1:22:54] is no time limits. There is no Oh,
[1:22:56] hallelujah. Are you hearing me? Amen.
[1:22:59] The devil right now is trying to keep it
[1:23:00] down cuz he's told you your mistakes
[1:23:02] won't let you go and your family history
[1:23:04] won't let you go. But I want to say
[1:23:06] this, that devil is a liar. And I will
[1:23:09] not back up. I will not lay down. I will
[1:23:12] not let that devil tell you one more
[1:23:13] second that you're limited because of
[1:23:16] the things of your past. You're limited
[1:23:18] because of your family tree. I want to
[1:23:20] tell you about another tree. It was on
[1:23:23] Mount Calvary. And when our Lord hung on
[1:23:25] that tree, he removed the limits, amen,
[1:23:28] off of your life by the blood that he
[1:23:34] shed. Well, you're
[1:23:37] unlimited. Well, glory to God. You're
[1:23:40] unlimited. You say, "But brother Andrew,
[1:23:42] this is the time of the Gentiles." Well,
[1:23:44] I know it is. And the Bible said until
[1:23:46] the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
[1:23:47] Brother said, "Shocking, isn't it?"
[1:23:49] Amen. To know that we have, Amen, a
[1:23:52] limited time. Can I say this? The
[1:23:54] Gentile, how many knows your
[1:23:56] Gentiles? I I know it's a day and time
[1:23:59] where everybody does their family
[1:24:00] history and they find 2.2% of a decimal
[1:24:03] of Jewish blood and all of a sudden
[1:24:04] they're Moses and Elijah in Revelations
[1:24:06] 11. But let's just bring it back down to
[1:24:08] earth. Okay, we're Gentiles and the only
[1:24:11] reason we're here is because of the
[1:24:13] blood of Calvary. Can I say it to you
[1:24:16] very plainly? Even though we're Gentiles
[1:24:18] and we have a limited time, that does
[1:24:21] not restrict an unlimited
[1:24:24] God. The Gentiles limited time does not
[1:24:28] restrict a unlimited God. Reb said this.
[1:24:31] He said, "You try to limit God to your
[1:24:33] theology and you try to limit God," I
[1:24:36] love how he says this. He says, "To your
[1:24:39] my way of thinking." So, he wasn't just
[1:24:41] putting it on the people. He said, "But
[1:24:43] sometimes the way I think, Amen, will
[1:24:46] limit God." But let me say what the
[1:24:48] Bible said. The Bible said, "My thoughts
[1:24:50] are not your thoughts, and neither are
[1:24:52] your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord."
[1:24:54] Amen. For as the heavens are higher than
[1:24:56] the earth, Amen. So are my ways higher
[1:24:59] than yours. I love this. And my
[1:25:01] thoughts, Amen, are higher than your
[1:25:03] thoughts. I want to say it as plain as I
[1:25:05] know how. An unlimited God sent an
[1:25:08] unlimited message to reveal an unlimited
[1:25:12] power. The church is always looking
[1:25:14] back. He said, "But let's look up for
[1:25:16] their powers are limited. But we have
[1:25:19] unlimited power. For all things are
[1:25:22] possible to them that believe in God."
[1:25:25] What are you saying, preacher? An
[1:25:27] unlimited God with unlimited power
[1:25:30] revealed by an unlimited message has
[1:25:32] produced an unlimited revival.
[1:25:37] I'm going to say it or I'm going to
[1:25:38] bust. Brother Wendle, this revival ain't
[1:25:40] over when we go home. This revival ain't
[1:25:43] over until Louisiana and then it starts
[1:25:45] again at True Word and then it picks up
[1:25:47] at Bethl. No, this is an unlimited
[1:25:50] revival. It burns at camp. It burns at
[1:25:53] home. Listen, because it's not a man,
[1:25:56] which is a finite restricted being on
[1:25:59] the inside of you. It is the unlimited
[1:26:01] God on the inside of you. Let me say
[1:26:04] this.
[1:26:06] I was preaching the other day on this
[1:26:08] thought and I've been praying about it
[1:26:09] and I've been studying and I've been
[1:26:11] seeking the Lord and I was just riding
[1:26:12] down the road listening to a tape and
[1:26:14] the spirit of the Lord just spoke in my
[1:26:15] heart and said tell them young people
[1:26:17] this message is the only thing that
[1:26:19] they're unlimited
[1:26:20] in. I said, "Lord, where am I going to
[1:26:23] find that?" Then I got to looking. Do
[1:26:25] you realize if you get in sports and I'm
[1:26:28] just going to go ahead and take a I'm
[1:26:29] going to take a sword to that devil.
[1:26:31] Amen. Because when in God's name did we
[1:26:33] start promoting sports so much that we
[1:26:35] ain't even got time to read the Bible
[1:26:36] cuz we're trying to keep up with some
[1:26:38] sports bracket or we're trying to see
[1:26:40] who out beats who. Hey, you're looking
[1:26:42] at one preacher that will not lay down
[1:26:44] and say it's okay to put our kids at the
[1:26:46] altar of sports. If you want to play it,
[1:26:48] that's between you and God. But I'll say
[1:26:50] this, you better be careful cuz there's
[1:26:52] a spirit behind that thing and it'll
[1:26:54] drive you into a nervous condition.
[1:26:58] Oh, I might as well pre have some
[1:27:00] liberty, brother Wendle. Amen. We made
[1:27:01] influences out of out of out of ball
[1:27:03] players that lived with three and four
[1:27:05] women and married four and five times
[1:27:07] and got more money than they got since
[1:27:09] and got babies by more women they know.
[1:27:11] And we've raised these people up in our
[1:27:14] kids' eyes. I say, God, it may get
[1:27:16] quiet, but I'll preach through it. I
[1:27:18] say, God, forgive us for the day that we
[1:27:20] raised up Hollywood sports stars as
[1:27:22] influences over the lives of our young
[1:27:25] people. I say in the name of the Lord,
[1:27:27] tear them down. Tear every sports star
[1:27:29] down. Tear every singer down and lift up
[1:27:32] the rock. Lift up the message of the
[1:27:34] hour. Let Christ come into your soul.
[1:27:37] He'll make you
[1:27:43] unlimited. The only place you're
[1:27:45] unlimited is in this message. You want
[1:27:49] me prove it to you? You want me to prove
[1:27:50] it to you? Okay. Start your career in
[1:27:53] baseball. You'll start out at a tea bowl
[1:27:55] and you'll stand there and you won't
[1:27:57] you'll hit the tee and the ball will
[1:27:58] drop three inches and mom will say,
[1:28:00] "Woo, look at my boy." And then you'll
[1:28:02] move up to pitching machine and you'll
[1:28:04] miss it 10 times and still get a trophy.
[1:28:06] Look at Oh god, I'm getting in trouble.
[1:28:08] Sure as a world, brother Sean. Amen.
[1:28:10] Then you go from pitching machine, amen,
[1:28:12] up to up to minor leagues, amen, and you
[1:28:14] play in that little league rather, and
[1:28:16] man, you're just the allstar. And then
[1:28:18] you might get good enough to make a
[1:28:19] traveling team and then that runs out.
[1:28:21] And then you make a minor league as you
[1:28:23] get an adult and then that runs out. And
[1:28:25] then one day everything you've been
[1:28:26] striving for is when Major League
[1:28:28] Baseball calls you and says, "We've
[1:28:30] selected you." Amen. To play on our
[1:28:32] team. And guys go out there, hey, that
[1:28:35] devil don't like it, but I don't care.
[1:28:36] Guys go out there and they blow their
[1:28:38] knees, break their backs, break their
[1:28:40] necks. Amen. Bump their heads. And they
[1:28:42] play in this for so many years. And then
[1:28:44] one day they say, "You're too old to
[1:28:46] play. Amen. Here's your check. Go home.
[1:28:48] Do you see? You finally made it, but
[1:28:50] you're still limited. But there is a
[1:28:53] message that you can be born into as a
[1:28:55] child. You can climb up into the powers
[1:28:58] of God. You can climb up into the wisdom
[1:29:00] of God. You can climb up into the
[1:29:02] revelation of God. And when you get old,
[1:29:05] it ain't over. Because one of these
[1:29:07] mornings, the power that saves you and
[1:29:10] the power that redeems you is going to
[1:29:12] change your body. And the gray hairs are
[1:29:14] going to turn back black again. And the
[1:29:16] stoop shoulders are going to straighten
[1:29:18] up. Hear me tonight, young people. This
[1:29:21] message has made you an unlimited
[1:29:29] generation. There is no limits on
[1:29:34] you. There is no limits on
[1:29:39] you. Now, I know what you're saying.
[1:29:42] You're saying, "Brother Andrew, I don't
[1:29:44] know about that." Can I tell you what
[1:29:46] you're bouncing against right now?
[1:29:48] You're bouncing against the sound
[1:29:49] barrier. But that sound barrier knows if
[1:29:53] you can just break it.
[1:29:57] The reason the devil tries to cause you
[1:29:59] to fall apart is he knows if you just
[1:30:03] break the sound barrier, he can't do
[1:30:05] nothing with you.
[1:30:08] He knows if you just get beyond all the
[1:30:10] youth camp gossip and all the he said,
[1:30:12] she said, they like me, he did, if you
[1:30:14] get past all of that and you finally get
[1:30:17] over against that sound barrier and you
[1:30:19] begin to believe the word of God, you
[1:30:22] will begin to break the sound
[1:30:24] barrier. How many's ever been in an
[1:30:27] airplane? You get in that airplane. I've
[1:30:29] been I've I've flown many times and and
[1:30:31] you know you get an airplane and you
[1:30:34] ride to the airport and you go about 55
[1:30:36] 65 or 95 if you're running late. No, I'm
[1:30:38] just
[1:30:40] kidding. You go about 45 55 60 and you
[1:30:43] just kind of ride along, you know, and
[1:30:45] then you get in the airplane and you get
[1:30:48] seated down and you put your your seat
[1:30:49] belt buckle on and you get all
[1:30:51] comfortable and all of a sudden the
[1:30:52] pilot gets out there and he says, "We're
[1:30:54] going to go out here and we're going to
[1:30:55] take off." and you ride out on the
[1:30:57] tarmac about the same speed that you
[1:31:00] rode the the the airport in. You just
[1:31:03] kind of coast along and bump around and
[1:31:05] and then all of a sudden, brother
[1:31:06] Ronnie, that pilot pulls the propeller.
[1:31:09] And when he begins to pull the
[1:31:11] propeller, you begin to speed up and all
[1:31:14] of a sudden you start going 100 miles an
[1:31:16] hour and then you start going 150 and
[1:31:19] then you go 200. You know what? I have
[1:31:21] never I've never been on an airplane,
[1:31:22] Brother Sam. and you're climbing up and
[1:31:25] and the things start shaking and lights
[1:31:27] start flashing and seat belt buckles
[1:31:28] start coming on and all these bo uh
[1:31:31] noises are dinging. Brother Timothy, I
[1:31:33] have never got up and walked up to my
[1:31:35] out of my seat to the cockpit and said,
[1:31:37] "Mr. Pilot, would you slow this thing
[1:31:39] down? Would you slow it back down to
[1:31:41] about 45 or 50? If I wanted to go 50
[1:31:44] miles an hour, I'd have stayed in the
[1:31:46] Baptist church.
[1:31:48] If I just wanted to go a 100 miles an
[1:31:50] hour, I would have stayed in the
[1:31:52] Pentecostal church. But I knew I was
[1:31:55] born to go fast. I knew I was born to be
[1:31:58] unlimited. Listen, folks. If I wanted to
[1:32:00] go 10 miles an hour, I'd still be riding
[1:32:03] a horse and buggy. If I wanted to go 50,
[1:32:05] I would still be in a car. If I wanted
[1:32:07] to go 200, I would still be in an
[1:32:09] airplane. But because I am an astronaut,
[1:32:12] I have broke out of time space. There
[1:32:15] ain't no restrictions on how high this
[1:32:18] revival of the word can go in the church
[1:32:21] of the living
[1:32:24] God. If you can see it, you can go to
[1:32:29] it. Now, Brother Ram said it very
[1:32:31] beautiful. He said, "You get up there
[1:32:33] and you break through. You've been
[1:32:35] struggling and struggling and struggling
[1:32:37] and struggling and I don't know I can't.
[1:32:40] I think I can. No, I can't." He said, "I
[1:32:42] could. She said I can't. And you're just
[1:32:44] struggling." But until you break through
[1:32:46] and the Holy Ghost comes upon you, he
[1:32:48] said there's about 50
[1:32:52] miles of elbow room. I'm sorry, brother
[1:32:56] Jonah. I'm the guy. I've got to know
[1:32:58] what elbow room means. So, I took time
[1:33:00] to look it up. Elbow room is space that
[1:33:04] is adequate. Amen. To move, to operate,
[1:33:07] and to work in. I said, "Well, I can
[1:33:10] find that in the message." When you get
[1:33:11] some elbow room, he said the Holy Ghost
[1:33:14] will operate in the church the same way
[1:33:16] it did on the day of Pentecost. When I
[1:33:18] heard him say move, he said, "Thus
[1:33:20] sayaith the Lord, the move is home for
[1:33:22] the bride." When I heard him say work,
[1:33:24] I've done read John 14:12. And he said,
[1:33:27] "Greater works than this shall I do."
[1:33:29] But I might as well say it. If anybody
[1:33:31] needs a campground this size, is the
[1:33:33] bride of Jesus Christ. If anybody needs
[1:33:36] a sanctuary, amen, this size, a bunch of
[1:33:39] young people is the bride of Jesus
[1:33:40] Christ. We ain't under some
[1:33:42] denominational, amen, restriction of
[1:33:44] some idea. We are freeborn, free sworn.
[1:33:47] Hey, sons and daughters of God. I say,
[1:33:50] give me some elbow room or get out of my
[1:33:52] way. I didn't come to play church. I
[1:33:55] come to have church. I'm going to break
[1:33:56] through the struggles. I'm going to
[1:33:58] break through the depression. I'm going
[1:34:00] to break through the nervousness. I'm
[1:34:01] going to break through the anxiety. I'm
[1:34:03] going to break through the complexes.
[1:34:05] I'm going to break through the fear. I
[1:34:07] have been born to be an unlimited
[1:34:11] generation. Slow down. No, I got a hold
[1:34:14] of the propeller and I'm not letting
[1:34:16] off. Slow down. I refuse. I know the
[1:34:20] potentials of God is in you to go there.
[1:34:27] Slow down. I refuse.
[1:34:31] I've done called a vision of the
[1:34:34] unlimited
[1:34:36] God. And I heard a prophet say upon the
[1:34:40] authority of God's word, there is no
[1:34:42] limit to the faith of God that he left
[1:34:45] for his church because he said all
[1:34:49] things are possible to
[1:34:52] them that believe.
[1:34:55] Now, I just got to say it. We're
[1:34:58] speaking of the true church, right?
[1:35:00] We're speaking of an unlimited
[1:35:03] generation. Brother Brim said it like
[1:35:05] this. He said the seventh church age
[1:35:07] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:35:09] the children back to the fathers. In
[1:35:11] other words, he would rebuild the church
[1:35:14] again under the power of the spirit.
[1:35:17] What is spiritual revelation? It is that
[1:35:20] the message sent to you is the person of
[1:35:23] Jesus Christ. I want to say this. God
[1:35:26] sent this message of the hour to
[1:35:28] enlighten the eyes of your
[1:35:29] understanding. Now I'll say it like the
[1:35:31] Bible said, "And you must receive it not
[1:35:33] as the word of men, but as it is in
[1:35:36] truth, the word of God, which
[1:35:39] effectually workketh also in you that
[1:35:42] believe." Did not Jesus say, "All things
[1:35:45] are possible to them that believe?" And
[1:35:48] here Paul says, "If you can believe the
[1:35:51] word as the word of God and not the word
[1:35:54] of man, that word will begin to work in
[1:35:57] you." Can I say this to you? That word
[1:36:00] is the message of the hour. And I want
[1:36:02] to say it very plainly. This is a fiery
[1:36:07] message. It don't work good around
[1:36:11] icicles. It's a fiery message. And I
[1:36:14] know I know I've heard it. People say,
[1:36:16] Grammax actually said it in 1963, he
[1:36:18] said, "Well, the people might say our
[1:36:20] church, our brethren, they say the
[1:36:22] cooling off of the message and so
[1:36:23] forth." Now, I just love a good
[1:36:25] theological Amen. philosopher answer to
[1:36:28] that and answer that statement. The
[1:36:30] message is cooling off. It ain't cooled
[1:36:35] off. The message is cooled off. It ain't
[1:36:38] cooled off. You know why? The church is
[1:36:41] cooling off, but the message ain't
[1:36:43] cooled off.
[1:36:45] Now, I'm just going to go ahead and get
[1:36:47] it out there in the open, young people,
[1:36:48] because people say some pretty dumb
[1:36:50] things. They I'm sorry that probably
[1:36:52] wasn't politically correct. They say
[1:36:54] things like, "Let's get people to Christ
[1:36:56] and then let's get them to the message."
[1:36:58] That is the greatest insult I think I
[1:37:01] have ever heard laid upon this message.
[1:37:03] You mean to tell me you're saying this
[1:37:05] message is something different from
[1:37:06] Christ? I rebuke that devil in the name
[1:37:09] of Jesus Christ. This message ain't
[1:37:11] different from Christ. This message is
[1:37:13] Christ. And I tell you why they say that
[1:37:16] is because they haven't seen the opening
[1:37:19] of the word for their hour. Oh, but if
[1:37:21] you ever see the word is open, if you
[1:37:23] ever hear the eagle scream, if you ever
[1:37:25] start chewing on the heavenly man,
[1:37:28] you'll start hearing from your theophony
[1:37:30] and you'll start climbing up out of
[1:37:32] depression. You'll start climbing up out
[1:37:34] of teenage pressures. You'll climb up on
[1:37:36] into the realms where God is and all
[1:37:39] things are
[1:37:40] possible. I'll say this very plainly.
[1:37:43] We're not following the ideas of a man.
[1:37:45] We're following the vindicated word of
[1:37:47] God. And the message of the hour, amen,
[1:37:50] has revealed an unlimited God in an
[1:37:52] unlimited generation. And it has lit an
[1:37:55] expectation in us that what we read in
[1:37:58] the word can be fulfilled in our lives.
[1:38:01] Now I just want to say what this word
[1:38:03] lit means. It means ignited. It means
[1:38:06] set on fire. And it means
[1:38:08] burning. Ho ho ho. When you have been
[1:38:11] lit, you have been ignited. You have
[1:38:14] been set on fire and you're burning.
[1:38:16] When you've been lit with an
[1:38:17] expectation, that means you have a
[1:38:20] strong belief. Now, Brother said it very
[1:38:23] beautiful. He said, "Wherever you go,
[1:38:25] whatever you do, what you expect brings
[1:38:28] your faith." If you come saying, "Well,
[1:38:30] there's nothing to it, that's just the
[1:38:31] way you'll go back home with nothing to
[1:38:33] it." If you come tonight saying, "Well,
[1:38:35] if I don't get prayed for, I'll go home
[1:38:37] and won't be healed." That's just the
[1:38:39] way you'll come. But if you come here
[1:38:41] tonight saying, "I come for one sole
[1:38:43] purpose, that is to contact Christ for
[1:38:46] my body and my soul, you will go home
[1:38:49] just as happy as you can be for you'll
[1:38:51] contact him." Can I say it? No matter
[1:38:54] what the opposition looks like, Christ
[1:38:57] is the
[1:38:59] answer. Faith brings Christ. He said,
[1:39:02] "Faith knows no defeat. Faith is
[1:39:05] perfect. Faith brings things when
[1:39:07] there's no things to be brought. Faith
[1:39:09] creates. Faith takes doubt away. It
[1:39:11] takes negative and makes it positive.
[1:39:13] Oh, faith is not a mythical something
[1:39:15] that is mentally worked up. It's an
[1:39:17] absolutely fundamental result. Amen.
[1:39:20] That happens in a person's heart. He
[1:39:22] said, "But faith must have a
[1:39:25] foundation." You cannot just lay faith
[1:39:27] on feelings. Feelings are shifting
[1:39:29] sands. You cannot just lay faith on
[1:39:32] emotions. They're shifting sands. So the
[1:39:35] foundation of our faith, it must be a
[1:39:38] revelation. And when the foundation of
[1:39:40] our faith is a I'm feeling good, is a
[1:39:43] revelation, then we can expect the
[1:39:46] impossible.
[1:39:48] Well, I don't know about you young
[1:39:49] people, but I come here this weekend
[1:39:51] expecting the
[1:39:54] impossible. I come expecting the
[1:39:56] impossible. You say, "Brother Andrew, it
[1:39:59] can't happen." It's already happening.
[1:40:01] Brother Andrew, it can't happen. Can I
[1:40:03] just say this to you? Think up in your
[1:40:06] mind the most wildest, craziest thing
[1:40:08] that can happen. And I tell you this,
[1:40:10] God will do it 10 times better because
[1:40:13] my Bible says with God nothing shall be
[1:40:17] impossible. He said, "If thou cast
[1:40:19] believe, all things are possible." Let
[1:40:21] me say what he said here. You say,
[1:40:23] "Well, brother Andrew, brother, I bring
[1:40:25] myself in. All things are possible with
[1:40:27] God." Let me say what he said. All
[1:40:29] things are possible to you, to them that
[1:40:32] believe. Do you believe that? I say
[1:40:35] this. God's power to perform the
[1:40:38] impossible is not coming. God's power to
[1:40:41] perform the impossible is here. When I
[1:40:44] say that, what I mean is this. The
[1:40:46] leadership of God has come to this age.
[1:40:49] He said, I believe in leadership, but
[1:40:51] it's not leadership of men. I believe in
[1:40:54] the leadership of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:40:56] Coming through the word. I believe also
[1:40:58] that God has set men in the church who
[1:41:00] are gifted by the spirit and they will
[1:41:02] keep the church in order. But here it
[1:41:04] is. By one spirit are they all baptized
[1:41:07] into one body. Listen. And everyone is
[1:41:10] to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Are
[1:41:13] you ready for this? And everyone is to
[1:41:16] participate in the worship of
[1:41:21] God. Everyone is to be moved upon by the
[1:41:26] Holy Ghost. And everyone is to
[1:41:29] participate in the worship of God. You
[1:41:31] say, "Well, Brother Andrew," Amen. I
[1:41:33] don't shout or I don't cry or I don't
[1:41:35] run or I stand up and scream. Amen. I'll
[1:41:37] just I'll just get it out there and say
[1:41:38] it and I'm going I'm I probably probably
[1:41:40] hurt some feelings, but what's new?
[1:41:42] Amen. Somebody say, "Well, we should
[1:41:43] shout. We shouldn't. We should dance. We
[1:41:45] shouldn't. We should sing. We shouldn't.
[1:41:46] We should preach. We should play a tape.
[1:41:48] We should do this." And all these
[1:41:50] things. And before long, you're like a
[1:41:51] robot. You don't know what to do. Should
[1:41:53] I sit? Should I? Should I run? Should I
[1:41:55] cry? Can I just go ahead and say it? Let
[1:41:57] the church be the
[1:42:00] church. And let God be God. If you feel
[1:42:03] like shouting, shout. If you feel like
[1:42:05] running, run. I say, "Let the shouters
[1:42:07] shout." I say, "Let the dancers dance."
[1:42:09] I say, "Let the tongue talkers talk. Let
[1:42:11] the preachers preach. Let the singers
[1:42:13] sing. Let the musicians play. Let the
[1:42:16] church have church again." I say, "Take
[1:42:18] off the restrictions and praise God till
[1:42:20] the Holy Ghost calls and lives are
[1:42:23] changed." Oh, I rebuke that ungodly,
[1:42:25] cold, formal devil that's trying to grip
[1:42:27] this meeting tonight. I rebuke it in the
[1:42:30] name of Jesus. I say, Satan, take your
[1:42:32] hands off of the young people. You are
[1:42:35] ex You are a liar and we dismiss you. We
[1:42:40] were born to enjoy the house of
[1:42:46] God. Can I Can I say it? Can I say it?
[1:42:49] The spirit of God makes a difference,
[1:42:51] church.
[1:42:53] The spirit of God makes the difference.
[1:42:55] You say, "What are you saying?" I'm
[1:42:57] going to say what Paul said. He said,
[1:42:58] "Quench not the
[1:43:00] spirit." Quench not the spirit. In other
[1:43:04] words, don't you quench the fire of God.
[1:43:06] Don't you stifle the divine influence.
[1:43:09] Now, I'll just say this. Amen. What is
[1:43:11] influencing
[1:43:13] you? I'm going to make it real simple,
[1:43:15] okay? You feel the Holy Ghost on you and
[1:43:17] you're ready to praise and something
[1:43:19] comes by and says, "Don't do it." Can I
[1:43:21] make it very plain? That's the
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:25] devil. You hear the word of God and
[1:43:28] something speaks in your heart and
[1:43:30] something begins to pulsate and said,
[1:43:32] "That's me. It's my night for a healing.
[1:43:34] It's my night for deliverance." And that
[1:43:37] word says, "Get up on your feet and
[1:43:38] receive it." And that devil comes by and
[1:43:40] says, "No, sit down." I'm going to tell
[1:43:42] you who that is. That's the devil. But
[1:43:44] if you're a son of God, you're an
[1:43:46] unlimited child of God. And if God
[1:43:49] begins to move on your heart, it ain't
[1:43:51] the time to pull back. It's the time to
[1:43:53] go forward. It's the time to push. It's
[1:43:56] the time to praise. I know sometimes
[1:43:58] things get on us. But I'll tell you,
[1:44:00] there ain't nothing like praising the
[1:44:02] devil off. There ain't nothing like
[1:44:03] stomping on the devil's head. Sometimes
[1:44:06] you just got to start shouting all by
[1:44:08] yourself. Sometimes you got to say,
[1:44:10] "Devil, you rode on my back as long as
[1:44:12] you're going to ride. You've condemned
[1:44:14] me as long as you're going to condemn
[1:44:15] me. I am a son of God. I am a daughter
[1:44:18] of God and God is in me and I refuse to
[1:44:21] be restricted any longer by your finite
[1:44:25] limited
[1:44:27] ideas. I say this, what's leading you
[1:44:30] now? I'll tell you what's leading this
[1:44:32] bride. Amen. Is the pillar of
[1:44:34] fire. I said it before, I'll say it
[1:44:37] again, brother Sean. It ain't the pillar
[1:44:38] of ice. It's the pillar of fire. And
[1:44:41] I'll tell you this much. Amen. If you
[1:44:43] want fire in your church, preach this
[1:44:45] message.
[1:44:47] If you want fire in your church, preach
[1:44:49] this message. Brother said, "The pillar
[1:44:51] of fire returning back." He said, "See,
[1:44:53] if God's going to lead the church or
[1:44:55] man's going to lead it," he said, "If
[1:44:56] man leads it, God pulls his church out
[1:44:59] and the pillar of fire moves on." I'll
[1:45:01] say this as plain as the prophet said
[1:45:03] it. He said, "The church, the great
[1:45:05] Pentecostal revival is now ceasing. We
[1:45:08] see it everywhere. The last great move.
[1:45:10] The message has went forth. Everything's
[1:45:12] ready now. The church is sealed away.
[1:45:15] The wicked are doing more wicked. The
[1:45:17] churches are becoming more churchy.
[1:45:18] Listen. And the saints are coming closer
[1:45:21] to
[1:45:23] God. Somebody say, "Well, we need to get
[1:45:25] some
[1:45:26] worship." Y'all, there's a song they
[1:45:28] sing and they I'm going to get in
[1:45:30] trouble. Sure as well. People get so
[1:45:33] proud. Well, I'm a Pentecostal. I'm a
[1:45:35] Pentecostal. I'm a Pentecostal. Well, I
[1:45:37] listen to a
[1:45:38] prophet and I heard him say today, he
[1:45:41] said, "People are so staked down. They
[1:45:43] say, "I'm a Pentecostal." He said,
[1:45:44] "Well, that's good. They say there ain't
[1:45:46] nothing more coming." He said, "I'm
[1:45:48] sorry you got such low ambitions." He
[1:45:50] said, "I've got high ambitions. I've got
[1:45:52] high
[1:45:54] anticipations. I'm not going back to
[1:45:57] restricted revival where there's got to
[1:45:59] be a specific preacher in the pull pit
[1:46:01] before God can do something. I'm not
[1:46:03] going back to some man trying to discern
[1:46:06] my future and tell me who I should marry
[1:46:08] and where I should go to church and who
[1:46:09] I should follow. I refuse. I have been
[1:46:13] liberated by the unlimited God. I have
[1:46:15] climbed up out of the Pentecostal age.
[1:46:18] I'm standing on Mount Zion where there's
[1:46:20] an unlimited revival, where there's an
[1:46:22] innumerable amount of angels. Come on,
[1:46:24] young
[1:46:26] people. Can I say this? Can I say this?
[1:46:30] The ministry is not a talent
[1:46:33] show. And I Oh, God. Listen, if you're a
[1:46:36] young man and God's calling you to
[1:46:38] preach, I say God bless you. I say, "But
[1:46:40] God never, amen, let you become so
[1:46:42] puffed up that you think everybody's got
[1:46:44] to hear you and everybody's got to see
[1:46:46] you and because somebody rejects you,
[1:46:49] I'm getting a little loose here." Amen.
[1:46:51] I'll say this. We need some men of God.
[1:46:53] We
[1:46:55] don't Can I say it? We got enough
[1:46:57] preachers. We need some
[1:46:59] ministers. Anybody can preach a sermon.
[1:47:02] Anybody can put some notes and quotes
[1:47:04] together. But it takes a burden of the
[1:47:06] Holy Ghost. And I say if you're a young
[1:47:08] man here and God has called you to
[1:47:10] preach, I pray he lays such a burden on
[1:47:13] your heart for souls. If you preach the
[1:47:17] fire, well, I might as well, Brother
[1:47:20] Sean, get on the dozer and doze through
[1:47:21] it. Are you hearing me? Amen. This ain't
[1:47:23] about who can outreach who and who can
[1:47:26] get who on their feet and who can get
[1:47:28] who running. It's about preaching the
[1:47:29] word until somebody recognizes that
[1:47:32] their humanity can no longer limit them
[1:47:35] in the message of the
[1:47:44] hour. I better move on. I'll get in
[1:47:47] trouble. This ain't about a talent show.
[1:47:50] It's about taking the message and
[1:47:52] helping people.
[1:47:55] And you ain't ready to preach to five.
[1:47:56] You ain't ready to preach to
[1:47:58] 500. Well, glory to God. Somebody shout
[1:48:01] aloud. Hey, I'm talking about an
[1:48:03] unlimited generation. I'm talking about
[1:48:05] wherever God put you. If he put Okay,
[1:48:09] Brother Wendle, can I preach? If he puts
[1:48:11] you in a church of five, be faithful. If
[1:48:13] he puts you in a church of 50, be
[1:48:15] faithful. If he puts you in a church of
[1:48:17] a thousand, be
[1:48:19] faithful. Come on. I refuse to lay down
[1:48:21] this message and let Pentecostalism
[1:48:24] invade our churches. It is of the devil
[1:48:27] and it don't belong in a message
[1:48:30] church. We have come to the word and the
[1:48:33] word alone. Well, I tell you, if my
[1:48:35] pastor preached like so and so, I'd get
[1:48:37] behind him. I say shame on you. If your
[1:48:40] pastor is preaching this message, I pray
[1:48:42] God take you from the floor to the back
[1:48:44] door and cause you to get behind the man
[1:48:46] of God and say amen to the word of God.
[1:48:50] Well, I got my sword out. I might as
[1:48:51] well cut that devil's head off. Well, my
[1:48:54] church ain't like so and so's church.
[1:48:55] This ain't a bunch of copycats. We ain't
[1:48:57] trying to all be like the same church.
[1:48:59] This is a mystical body of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:02] Listen, wherever God put you, you are
[1:49:05] unlimited. If you're in Paul knee,
[1:49:07] you're unlimited. If you're in
[1:49:08] Blackburg, you're unlimited. If you're
[1:49:10] in Ohio or Arkansas or Tennessee or
[1:49:13] Canada or Africa or India, this is an
[1:49:16] unlimited
[1:49:17] revival. I say, let it burn. Let it
[1:49:21] burn. Let it burn our churches. Let it
[1:49:23] burn our
[1:49:26] homes. It's more than emotion, folks.
[1:49:30] It's
[1:49:32] revelation. Well, somebody praise God.
[1:49:35] Somebody shout that old devil of
[1:49:37] personalities out of the
[1:49:46] building. I hate that devil with
[1:49:48] everything within me.
[1:49:52] You say, "Hate's a strong word." It
[1:49:54] ain't strong enough for the way I feel
[1:49:55] about that
[1:49:56] devil that limits visions and limits God
[1:49:59] and limits
[1:50:03] his I just tell you something. If you
[1:50:05] preach this message, God will send
[1:50:07] somebody to listen to
[1:50:09] it. I've used it around the world,
[1:50:11] Brother Son. I'm going to use it here
[1:50:12] tonight. I remember when you started
[1:50:14] those tent meetings. Amen. I remember
[1:50:16] when it didn't, it looked impossible.
[1:50:17] Amen. But the first year, Amen. God sent
[1:50:20] about 700 folks, amen, over there to
[1:50:22] hear the word and watch it grow. You
[1:50:24] say, "What are you saying?" Can I say
[1:50:25] this? Amen. I'll say this as plain as I
[1:50:28] know how. This is not about
[1:50:30] personalities in the message. This is
[1:50:32] not about who's who and who can outreach
[1:50:34] who and who can have a bigger meeting. I
[1:50:36] say this, if you're willing to do
[1:50:38] something for God's kingdom and fake
[1:50:40] tabernacles stepped down and they were
[1:50:42] willing to do something for the kingdom
[1:50:44] of God in the middle of a pandemic and
[1:50:46] God has put his hand on
[1:50:48] that. Brother Wendle, we didn't get here
[1:50:51] because one day you woke up and decided
[1:50:53] to have a youth camp, but somewhere you
[1:50:55] thought it out, somewhere you prayed
[1:50:57] through. And here we're standing tonight
[1:50:59] on an unlimited
[1:51:01] platform. I know you may think I'm
[1:51:04] crazy. I'm going to say it or I'm going
[1:51:05] to bust. Devil, you've lost. Devil,
[1:51:08] you've lost. This is a new generation.
[1:51:11] We don't care about who's who. We just
[1:51:13] care about one thing. We want to preach
[1:51:16] the message until the power of God falls
[1:51:18] and the anointing destroys the yoke of
[1:51:20] the enemy and somebody realizes there is
[1:51:23] a place I can go in God.
[1:51:31] Well, brother Andrew, I'm this little
[1:51:32] old singer and I sing in my church and
[1:51:34] and I don't know how in the world I got
[1:51:36] on this, but here I here we go. And I
[1:51:39] just, you know, I get up there and sing.
[1:51:41] And when I sing, ain't nobody hardly
[1:51:43] claps and ain't nobody hardly rejoices.
[1:51:45] And but Sister So and So gets up and
[1:51:47] singing. They ask her to
[1:51:49] sing, "What's up with all this nonsense?
[1:51:52] What's up with all of it? This ain't
[1:51:54] about who can out sing who." Listen, I
[1:51:56] don't care how great you perfect your
[1:51:58] pitch. I don't care how good you get
[1:51:59] your tones. If the anointing aid in your
[1:52:02] singing, it ain't going to help nobody.
[1:52:04] I'd rather you be so far off key you
[1:52:06] wouldn't know it if you met it in a
[1:52:07] 10acre field. But let the anointing of
[1:52:10] God accompany the gift of God in your
[1:52:14] life. Unlimited. And the only thing that
[1:52:17] took us there was the message.
[1:52:23] Want me prove it to you? Go to a
[1:52:25] denominational church. You'll be
[1:52:27] limited. How much money you got, what
[1:52:30] family you come out of, how big is your
[1:52:32] education, what size house you live in,
[1:52:34] what kind of standing do you have in
[1:52:36] society. But over here in this message,
[1:52:38] there's a bunch of nobodies get
[1:52:39] together, but we have a good time.
[1:52:42] Brother Nathaniel, we have a good time
[1:52:44] cuz we're all the same. We ain't got the
[1:52:46] same bank account. We ain't got the same
[1:52:48] car. We don't live in the same kind of
[1:52:50] house, but we got the same kind of God.
[1:52:53] And we've all been saved by the blood of
[1:52:56] Jesus Christ. I say come on over here
[1:52:59] where there's an unlimited revival and
[1:53:01] it's burning in the hearts of the young
[1:53:10] people. I'm just going to I'm just going
[1:53:13] to cut right to it and say it. I'm just
[1:53:16] going to say it. Okay.
[1:53:19] If you can follow this message, you're
[1:53:21] unlimited.
[1:53:26] You say, "Brother Andrew, how much power
[1:53:28] can I have my life?" As much as you can
[1:53:30] say amen to what a prophet said.
[1:53:34] How far can I go in the kingdom of God?
[1:53:36] As much as you can believe this message
[1:53:39] is as far as you can go. Some people
[1:53:41] only believe in Malachi 4. Some only
[1:53:43] believe to Revelations 5. I'm sorry. I
[1:53:45] believe all the way to the millennium
[1:53:47] because I am a child of the generation
[1:53:50] that is expecting great
[1:53:55] things. Can you believe it?
[1:53:59] Can you believe it? You say, "Brother
[1:54:01] Andrew, what are you talking about?" I'm
[1:54:02] talking about getting your eyes off of
[1:54:04] men and getting your eyes back on the
[1:54:06] message.
[1:54:08] I'm sorry, Brother Wendell. Get your
[1:54:10] eyes off of men and get your eyes back
[1:54:13] on the message.
[1:54:16] Because if you're following a man, you
[1:54:18] can only go as far as that man goes. But
[1:54:20] if you're following
[1:54:23] Christ, then you are
[1:54:29] unlimited. Now, I'll say this. You are
[1:54:32] the generation of the upright. Amen. Can
[1:54:36] I say this? You're like Israel of old.
[1:54:38] We are back underneath original
[1:54:40] headship. Brother Andrew, what is
[1:54:42] original headship? Well, here it is. It
[1:54:45] is a prophet under the pillar of fire,
[1:54:48] vindicated by the word. Let me read that
[1:54:51] again. It's a prophet under the pillar
[1:54:54] of fire, vindicated by the word. Uh, we
[1:54:57] got a picture of
[1:55:00] that. It's a prophet under the pillar of
[1:55:03] Oh, there it
[1:55:05] is. It's a prophet under the pillar of
[1:55:08] fire, vindicated by the word. So, can I
[1:55:12] say what a prophet said? He said, "All
[1:55:14] things are possible to them that can
[1:55:16] believe
[1:55:19] that." All things are possible to them
[1:55:22] that can believe that. And if you can
[1:55:25] believe it, if you can believe it, then
[1:55:29] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:55:32] believe, that is
[1:55:35] yours. Hallelujah. Whatever God will
[1:55:39] lead your soul to believe, that is
[1:55:42] yours. If you can believe that, you're
[1:55:45] going to see great things. If you can
[1:55:47] believe that, you're going to see
[1:55:49] marvelous things. If you can believe
[1:55:51] that, God is going to whip your enemies
[1:55:54] and destroy his
[1:55:58] devices. When you're underneath a pillar
[1:56:00] of fire, you're
[1:56:02] unlimited. There ain't nohere the pillar
[1:56:04] of fire can't go. There ain't nobody the
[1:56:06] pit of fire cake.
[1:56:09] I'm sorry. I've got free and I'm soaring
[1:56:11] and I ain't slowing down. I'm free. I
[1:56:14] see it. I believe it. God led my soul to
[1:56:17] it and I'm unlimited in
[1:56:21] it. If you can believe that, you can
[1:56:24] believe God can restore your fallen
[1:56:27] brother. If you can believe that, you
[1:56:30] can believe God can bring your weward
[1:56:31] sister home. If you can believe that,
[1:56:34] you can believe God will heal your body.
[1:56:36] If you can believe
[1:56:39] that, if you can believe that, you can
[1:56:42] believe you never done it in the first
[1:56:44] place. If you can believe that, you can
[1:56:47] believe what a prophet said about
[1:56:50] you. I'm tired of believing what man
[1:56:53] thinks. I'm tired of hearing what man
[1:56:55] thinks. I've done broke out. I'm an
[1:56:57] unlimited child of God.
[1:57:07] I believe, he says, as I am led to
[1:57:10] believe. That that is the picture of the
[1:57:14] angel of the Lord who comes and does a
[1:57:18] discerning. If you can believe that.
[1:57:26] See, I know that devil right now is a
[1:57:28] little intimidated because of where
[1:57:30] we're at and what's going on. I ain't
[1:57:32] ashamed of that
[1:57:35] picture. I ain't ashamed of it,
[1:57:39] saints. It made me unlimited.
[1:57:49] Now, I'm sorry. I'm going over. Give me
[1:57:51] a few minutes. We've been led to believe
[1:57:53] what we believe. Can I tell you that?
[1:57:56] You've not been talked into believing
[1:57:57] what you believe. You have been led
[1:58:01] to believe what you believe. Led to
[1:58:05] believe is a phrase which means you've
[1:58:07] been influenced to a certain belief
[1:58:10] because of something you've seen,
[1:58:12] something you've heard, or something
[1:58:14] you've read.
[1:58:15] Oh, brother Joseph, I read that. I said,
[1:58:17] 'Oh, that's who I am. I have seen the
[1:58:20] pictures. I have read the books and I
[1:58:23] have heard the tapes and it ripped off
[1:58:25] the restrictions on my
[1:58:33] life. I just going to say it. Led to
[1:58:36] believe is usually because of a
[1:58:39] conversation. Listen, Reb said this. He
[1:58:42] said, "Don't try to push yourself. just
[1:58:44] simply believe. And what he tells me,
[1:58:48] I'll tell
[1:58:49] you. So when you're led to believe
[1:58:52] something, somebody's had a
[1:58:54] conversation. And they come and brother
[1:58:56] Joel, they tell you that conversation
[1:58:58] and you say, "I was led to believe."
[1:59:02] I'm closing, but I'm having fun. I'm
[1:59:04] done preaching. They said, "I've been
[1:59:06] led to believe by what I was told."
[1:59:08] Well, can I tell you something? Let me
[1:59:10] tell you about a vindicated
[1:59:11] conversation. Can you give me the next
[1:59:14] picture? There was a prophet on the
[1:59:17] Ohigh River and he was baptizing the
[1:59:20] 17th person. And right before he took
[1:59:22] that 17th person down, there was a
[1:59:24] pillar of fire, the same one you've seen
[1:59:26] in the previous picture, come down over
[1:59:28] the Ohio River and a voice spoke out of
[1:59:31] it and said, "As John the Baptist was
[1:59:33] sent to forrun the first coming of
[1:59:35] Christ, your message is going to forrun
[1:59:38] the second coming of Christ."
[1:59:41] You know what he did? He went around the
[1:59:43] world telling that. He went around the
[1:59:46] world saying, "I met an angel and he
[1:59:48] told me, if I'll just get the people to
[1:59:50] believe, not even
[1:59:53] cancer, not even cancer will stand in
[1:59:56] your way." I'm sorry, folks. I'm beyond
[1:59:59] hope. I believe the conversation. I
[2:00:03] believe what the pillar of fire is
[2:00:04] saying. I believe the message.
[2:00:07] Therefore, I am unlimited. I am
[2:00:09] unrestricted.
[2:00:13] Can I say it? I'm going in the
[2:00:16] rapture. I have been restricted for
[2:00:18] years, but by the message of the hour,
[2:00:21] the restrictions have been taken off. I
[2:00:23] have been cleared to go in the message.
[2:00:26] I'm not going to shout my way in the
[2:00:28] message. I'm not going to dance my way
[2:00:30] into the rapture. I'm not going to feel
[2:00:32] my way in the rapture. I'm going to
[2:00:34] believe the conversation all the way
[2:00:36] into the change.
[2:00:42] of my
[2:00:43] body. Can you give me that next
[2:00:48] picture? Brother Andrew, all we hear on
[2:00:50] these tapes is just a man saying stuff.
[2:00:53] Oh, you better be
[2:00:56] careful. You better be
[2:00:58] careful. Well, them tapes, they're just
[2:01:01] And I know I'm going over, Brother Wind.
[2:01:02] I'm sorry. them tapes, they're just
[2:01:04] they're just background noise and
[2:01:06] they're just there's some weird things
[2:01:07] on there. Some you can believe, some you
[2:01:09] can't. And and you know, we got all
[2:01:11] these tapes and it's just a man talking.
[2:01:13] He's just standing there and brother
[2:01:14] Timothy, he's just pulling stuff out of
[2:01:16] midair and whatever thought comes by, he
[2:01:18] says. And can you give me the next
[2:01:26] picture? Can you give me the previous
[2:01:28] picture?
[2:01:33] Can you give me the next picture?
[2:01:36] So what he was saying was coming from
[2:01:39] the pillar of
[2:01:43] fire. He was telling you what him and
[2:01:46] the pillar of fire talked
[2:01:50] about. Can I say it? Can I say it? You
[2:01:54] know right now there's thoughts going
[2:01:55] through this room. You know what they're
[2:01:57] looking for? They're looking for
[2:01:58] somebody to believe them. There's
[2:02:00] negative thoughts going through this
[2:02:02] room looking for somebody to believe
[2:02:03] them. There's thoughts of depression and
[2:02:06] thoughts of suicide and thoughts of
[2:02:08] condemnation and they're roaming through
[2:02:10] this building and they're looking for
[2:02:11] some feeble mind, amen, to become a
[2:02:14] transmitter for those thoughts. But I
[2:02:16] want to say, thank God, the same pillar
[2:02:18] of fire that stood between the prophet
[2:02:20] and the thought world is right here in
[2:02:22] this building tonight. And the only
[2:02:24] thing we can pick up is the mind of
[2:02:27] Christ. And he says you're free. He says
[2:02:32] you're
[2:02:33] healed. He says you're
[2:02:37] delivered. Can you believe it? If you
[2:02:40] can believe it, you become
[2:02:46] unlimited. Can you give me that last
[2:02:54] picture? Oh, they hate that one.
[2:02:57] They've done everything they can Joel to
[2:02:59] dismiss that as just a pillar of a or
[2:03:01] just some smoke from an astronaut ship.
[2:03:04] But there was a Bible I got to quit but
[2:03:06] it's it's free sword now. There there
[2:03:09] was a Bible that people had been
[2:03:11] carrying for years and didn't have a
[2:03:13] clue what they was carrying. They had
[2:03:15] been reading it for years and didn't
[2:03:17] have a clue what they was reading. But
[2:03:18] in
[2:03:19] 1962 in Sabino Canyon, there was a cloud
[2:03:22] come down and spoke to a prophet and
[2:03:25] said, "Go back east and break those
[2:03:27] seven
[2:03:28] seals." Oh, I'm feeling good.
[2:03:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he went in a
[2:03:33] little
[2:03:35] room. He went into a little room and he
[2:03:38] met an angel. And the angel said, "Go
[2:03:40] tell him that the Antichrist is the
[2:03:43] white horse rider." And he went to a
[2:03:44] pull pit and said, "Here's the first
[2:03:46] seal." He went back in the room and the
[2:03:49] angel said, "Tell him what that horse
[2:03:50] rider is." And
[2:03:53] he for seven days he had a conversation
[2:03:57] about the most sacred book that you'll
[2:03:59] ever hold in your
[2:04:02] hands. On the sixth day, he went in
[2:04:04] there and he said, "There's a there's a
[2:04:06] tribulation seal." And I love this. He
[2:04:08] come out and he said, "Listen, it's
[2:04:10] tribulation, but little bride, you're
[2:04:12] not in it.
[2:04:20] But then there was a seventh
[2:04:21] conversation. I'll call it the seventh
[2:04:23] seal. It was when the mighty angel for
[2:04:26] the first time descended from the
[2:04:28] heavens to break the seven seals. And he
[2:04:30] said, "You go tell them that your
[2:04:33] message is rapturing faith. And if they
[2:04:36] can believe it, they can possess the
[2:04:38] rapture. If they can believe it, they
[2:04:40] will see their loved ones some morning
[2:04:42] between 6 and 9. I'm sorry. Stand on
[2:04:45] your feet. I'm not a crazy man. I'm an
[2:04:48] unlimited believer. The chains of
[2:04:50] restriction has been tore off. I heard a
[2:04:53] prophet.
[2:04:57] This ain't just pictures. These ain't
[2:04:59] just books. These aren't just tapes.
[2:05:01] It's a vindicated
[2:05:06] conversation. And somebody tell you they
[2:05:08] met an angel and they try to tell you
[2:05:09] what that angel told them to influence
[2:05:10] the way you believe. Be very leery.
[2:05:14] We ain't believing every angel that
[2:05:16] comes by. We got a vindicated one
[2:05:20] and he's leading you to the rapture.
[2:05:26] The devil hates this. He hates it. He
[2:05:29] hates it. But I'm going to say it.
[2:05:35] when you begin to
[2:05:39] believe. Now, I know people say,
[2:05:41] "Well, there's more to it." Well, let's
[2:05:44] just get back to saying what a prophet
[2:05:45] said. He said, "The evidence of the Holy
[2:05:48] Ghost is receiving and believing your
[2:05:52] word for that age."
[2:05:56] I'm sorry. I can't help what anybody
[2:05:58] else says. That's what a province is.
[2:06:00] Brother Bson said, "It's about time we
[2:06:01] get the people to a place where they're
[2:06:03] beginning to believe.
[2:06:07] And things are being done.
[2:06:12] Can I tell you right here tonight, as
[2:06:13] you believe this message, things are
[2:06:15] happening.
[2:06:18] As you begin to believe, right here in
[2:06:19] this building, things begin to
[2:06:24] change. You say, "Brother Andrew, I
[2:06:26] don't feel nothing. Brother Andrew, I
[2:06:28] don't see nothing." I say it all the
[2:06:31] time. I'll say it here tonight. Brother,
[2:06:32] brother Sean helped me the most in this
[2:06:34] point as a young preacher. The angel of
[2:06:36] the Lord accompanies this message
[2:06:40] always. If you'll just preach it, God
[2:06:43] will back it
[2:06:46] up. It's time to start
[2:06:49] believing. Brother Andrew, I don't feel
[2:06:51] nothing. Brother Andrew, I don't see
[2:06:57] anything. Can I tell you
[2:06:59] something? You don't have to.
[2:07:04] But a prophet said, "You better believe
[2:07:11] something." You better believe
[2:07:13] something. You better believe something
[2:07:16] stronger than your
[2:07:17] emotions. You better believe something
[2:07:20] stronger than your senses. Can I say
[2:07:22] this? The pro of God stands there. He
[2:07:23] says, "Now look, lady, do you believe
[2:07:25] with all your heart? Do you believe me
[2:07:27] to be his prophet, his servant, rather?
[2:07:29] with all your heart you believe it. Now
[2:07:31] just a moment here it is again. That's
[2:07:33] the way to believe audience. That's the
[2:07:35] way to get something from God. Now it's
[2:07:37] coming from many different places. Look
[2:07:39] here sister. You have stomach
[2:07:43] trouble. All you with stomach trouble
[2:07:45] stand to your feet right
[2:07:48] now. See there what I told
[2:07:52] you. There they are. He says let's bow
[2:07:55] our heads. Oh Lord Jesus, these demons
[2:07:58] are
[2:07:59] screaming. These demons are screaming.
[2:08:01] If you could hear in another realm right
[2:08:04] now, God, if you could hear in another
[2:08:07] realm, them demons are screaming right
[2:08:09] now. He said they're pulling. They know
[2:08:12] their time has
[2:08:15] come. They know their time has come. Are
[2:08:19] you ready for this? They know they can't
[2:08:22] get by with these
[2:08:23] things. Can I say it? They know their
[2:08:27] end is
[2:08:30] here. They know they can't get by any
[2:08:33] longer. They know their end is here.
[2:08:37] Listen what he says. Are you ready for
[2:08:39] this? Because people is now beginning to
[2:08:44] believe. Can I say it to you very
[2:08:46] plainly? When you begin to believe, the
[2:08:50] devil begins to lose.
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:55] When you begin to believe the devil
[2:08:58] begins to
[2:08:59] lose, well, why don't you give him a
[2:09:01] defeat
[2:09:03] tonight? Why don't you begin to believe
[2:09:06] God is bigger and God is greater and God
[2:09:09] is
[2:09:09] [Music]
[2:09:12] stronger? When you begin to believe, the
[2:09:15] devils begin to
[2:09:16] [Music]
[2:09:21] lose. You have believed the devil's lie
[2:09:25] long
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:28] enough. You've seen these pictures.
[2:09:31] You've heard these quotes. You've
[2:09:33] listened to these
[2:09:34] [Music]
[2:09:36] tapes. Can I say it tonight, young
[2:09:39] people? Can I say it right here on this
[2:09:41] Friday night? It's time to bring the
[2:09:44] devil to his end.
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:50] It's time right here
[2:09:54] tonight. It's time to bring the devil to
[2:09:57] his
[2:09:59] end. I'm preaching to you right now.
[2:10:01] It's time to bring him to his end. He's
[2:10:04] run free in your life. It's time to
[2:10:06] bring him to his
[2:10:08] end. It's time to bring that devil right
[2:10:11] to his end and say, "Devil, here is
[2:10:15] where you end.
[2:10:18] I
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:21] believe. I believe my name is in the
[2:10:23] lamb's book of
[2:10:27] life. I believe when the sons of God
[2:10:29] were shouting for joy, I was there with
[2:10:34] him. I believe when a prophet said when
[2:10:37] he spoke his word, deity revolved right
[2:10:40] out of God into me. I believe
[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:47] Heard a story one
[2:10:49] time. Man went out and raised in a poor
[2:10:53] family. No no no no no no no no
[2:10:56] resources, no means of
[2:10:59] nothing. His testimony said he grew up
[2:11:01] dirt poor. Didn't have
[2:11:03] nothing. But down in his heart he said
[2:11:07] he believed. Now this is a this is a man
[2:11:10] in the world. And he said one day is I
[2:11:14] won't give you the whole story but just
[2:11:15] to give you the the the quick version of
[2:11:17] it. He said one day he finally broke
[2:11:19] into success and he made all this money
[2:11:22] and he got all these fancy
[2:11:24] things. He began to become really
[2:11:27] popular and well known and and somebody
[2:11:30] come to him and they said sir they said
[2:11:34] we want to know your secret. We want to
[2:11:36] know your secret. How did you come from
[2:11:39] nothing to this? And he just kind of
[2:11:41] stood there and looked at him and the
[2:11:43] reporter said, "No, no, you're not
[2:11:45] understanding this." Said, "You got some
[2:11:47] kind of
[2:11:48] secret. You got you got to tell us. Can
[2:11:51] you Can you Can you tell us?" He
[2:11:53] said, she said, "No, sir." She said,
[2:11:56] "Okay, if you can't talk, can you put it
[2:11:59] in a book?" And brother Brother Timothy,
[2:12:02] he said these words. He said, "If I did,
[2:12:05] it would be the shortest book I ever
[2:12:07] wrote." She said, "What do you mean,
[2:12:09] sir?" He said, "Cuz it would only have
[2:12:11] one sentence." She said, "What's that?"
[2:12:14] He said, "This, I
[2:12:18] believed." I know the devil don't like
[2:12:20] that right now. I feel that devil, but
[2:12:22] I'm sorry. I'm standing on thus sayith
[2:12:24] the
[2:12:25] [Music]
[2:12:27] Lord. He said, "I
[2:12:29] believed." She said, "What's your
[2:12:31] secret?" "I believed." She said, "When
[2:12:34] you got depressed, what did you do?" He
[2:12:36] said, "I believed." She said, "When you
[2:12:38] were forsaken, what did you do?" He
[2:12:40] said, "I believed." She said, "When
[2:12:42] business deals failed, what did you do?"
[2:12:44] He said, "I believed." Come on, folks.
[2:12:46] That not God, that's not the power of
[2:12:49] that didn't come from the devil. The
[2:12:50] devil stole that. Let me say it to you.
[2:12:52] If the devil can do that in the natural
[2:12:54] realm, then what about right here in the
[2:12:56] spiritual realm? What is the secret to
[2:12:58] young people? I believe the message. I
[2:13:02] believe what God said about me.
[2:13:09] And if you can believe it tonight, you
[2:13:11] can walk out of the prison house. I want
[2:13:14] you bow your heart here
[2:13:16] tonight. You're
[2:13:20] unlimited. You're unlimited
[2:13:23] tonight. What's your secret? I'm going
[2:13:26] to tell you. Here's the secret of it.
[2:13:30] The word is in the bride. She has thus
[2:13:34] sayaith the
[2:13:35] Lord. Brother Andrew, what are you
[2:13:38] getting at? I'm saying this
[2:13:42] tonight. If you can begin to
[2:13:45] believe, things begin to
[2:13:49] change. You don't have to feel
[2:13:52] nothing. You don't have to see
[2:13:54] nothing. But you do have to believe
[2:13:58] something. What are you going to believe
[2:14:00] tonight?
[2:14:02] Maybe you're standing here and for years
[2:14:04] you've been believing what the devil
[2:14:05] says about
[2:14:06] you. Change what you're believing
[2:14:10] tonight. Change what you're
[2:14:12] believing. You don't have to believe
[2:14:14] depression. You don't have to believe
[2:14:17] anxiety. That complex that's plagued you
[2:14:19] and plagued generations before you
[2:14:21] that's trying to restrict you in the
[2:14:22] anointing. You don't have to believe
[2:14:24] that any longer. The unlimited God is
[2:14:28] right here in this building tonight.
[2:14:31] with every head bowed, ever eye
[2:14:34] closed. That devil that's told you
[2:14:36] because your parents' marriage failed or
[2:14:37] this marriage failed in your family,
[2:14:39] yours is going to. And that devil's
[2:14:41] trying to restrict you. He's trying to
[2:14:43] restrict your view. He's trying to
[2:14:44] restrict restrict what you believe. I
[2:14:46] rebuke that devil in the name of
[2:14:48] Jesus. You're
[2:14:50] unlimited. You're
[2:14:52] unlimited. Brother Andrew, I've made so
[2:14:55] many mistakes. I've had so many
[2:14:56] failures. I've had so many shortcomings.
[2:14:59] I'm beyond help. I come not to tell you
[2:15:01] there's an unlimited grace in this
[2:15:04] message. What's restricting you right
[2:15:08] now. The minute you quit believing it is
[2:15:11] the minute it quits restricting you. The
[2:15:14] minute you begin to believe, the minute
[2:15:17] you begin to turn your attention towards
[2:15:19] God, things begin to
[2:15:23] change. Could there be one here tonight
[2:15:25] could say, "I'm coming out of this
[2:15:26] prison of unbelief.
[2:15:28] Every head bowed, every eye closed. This
[2:15:31] complex, this
[2:15:33] inferiority, this this this anxiety,
[2:15:36] this depression, this mind battle, this
[2:15:39] perversion, this plague my life. I
[2:15:42] believed it. I believed it my last day.
[2:15:45] Today, I'm beginning to
[2:15:48] believe. I'm beginning to
[2:15:51] believe.
[2:15:53] Hallelujah.
[2:15:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:58] The altar is open tonight. God bless
[2:16:01] you, brother. The altar's open tonight.
[2:16:04] You want to come and say, "Lord, I'm
[2:16:06] changing my belief system tonight. I'm
[2:16:09] changing I'm changing what I
[2:16:12] believe. I'm going to believe this
[2:16:15] message. I'm going to believe it
[2:16:17] untampered. I'm going to believe it
[2:16:19] without restriction. I'm going to
[2:16:21] believe it without man's ideas. I'm
[2:16:24] going to believe it as thus sayith the
[2:16:26] Lord. Almighty
[2:16:28] God in this atmosphere right now of
[2:16:31] faith. Lord your prophet said it so
[2:16:34] beautifully when he stood there that
[2:16:36] night and he said now I transmit the
[2:16:39] faith of God to you to believe these
[2:16:43] things. Lord, here's the secret. Our
[2:16:47] human faith can only go so far. Our
[2:16:50] intellectual faith can only go so far.
[2:16:53] But Lord, when the faith of God comes in
[2:16:56] the heart of these
[2:16:57] believers, they can begin to believe
[2:16:59] like God. They can begin to believe like
[2:17:02] Abraham. And right here tonight, dear
[2:17:05] God, I know these are things they've
[2:17:07] heard. They've heard it preached their
[2:17:08] whole life. They've heard these
[2:17:10] scriptures since Sunday school. But
[2:17:13] Lord, it's burning in my heart. I stand
[2:17:16] here tonight before them. Lord is a
[2:17:19] product is a trophy of this message. Not
[2:17:22] of what a man has done or or what a or
[2:17:25] what a church has done but what this
[2:17:27] message has done. Lord in everything in
[2:17:30] my life I was restricted. But Lord when
[2:17:33] you opened my eyes to this word when you
[2:17:35] showed me who I was when I begin to hear
[2:17:38] the secrets of your heart it begin to
[2:17:40] tear off restrictions. Lord, now Lord,
[2:17:43] maybe there's a young person sitting
[2:17:45] right here in this building tonight and
[2:17:46] the devil has restricted them with the
[2:17:48] thought that God can't use them because
[2:17:51] maybe their daddy's not in church or
[2:17:53] their mama's not in church. But Lord, I
[2:17:55] take the liberty and the privilege to
[2:17:57] stand here tonight and to rebuke that
[2:17:59] devil by telling them the prophet of God
[2:18:02] was packing water to a moonshine still
[2:18:04] for his father who was making moonshine
[2:18:07] when the pillar of fire appeared to him
[2:18:09] and begin to talk to him and begin to
[2:18:11] tell him things. Lord, he was restricted
[2:18:14] with education. He was restricted in
[2:18:16] society. He was restricted, oh God, in
[2:18:19] the community. He was restricted even in
[2:18:21] religion. Lord, when he be to believe
[2:18:23] these things, they told him he was
[2:18:24] crazy. When he began to believe these
[2:18:26] things, they told him he had a dream. Or
[2:18:28] how would he, a seventh grade educated
[2:18:30] Kentucky hillbilly, ever stand and pray
[2:18:32] for po popes and monarchs and kings and
[2:18:35] presidents? And they tried to restrict
[2:18:37] him. But Lord, he broke beyond all of
[2:18:39] it, dear God. He broke beyond all of it
[2:18:42] and believed what you said about him.
[2:18:44] And tonight, dear God, I pray every
[2:18:46] young person under the sound of my voice
[2:18:48] will break beyond the voice of influence
[2:18:50] of Hollywood, beyond the voice of
[2:18:52] politics, beyond the voice of education,
[2:18:55] beyond the voice of sports, beyond the
[2:18:57] voice of their coaches. Oh God, may they
[2:18:59] hear the voice of their pastors. May
[2:19:01] they hear the voice of the ministry. May
[2:19:03] they hear the voice of this message as
[2:19:05] it screams out to them. They're
[2:19:08] unlimited. Hallelujah.
[2:19:10] or coach may be a good person, but they
[2:19:13] can only take them so far. Their teacher
[2:19:15] may be a good person. They can only take
[2:19:17] them so far. But Lord, there's a seventh
[2:19:21] angel. If they'll believe that voice,
[2:19:24] it'll take them into
[2:19:26] glory. It'll take them into
[2:19:29] eternity. We believe it
[2:19:32] tonight. Hallelujah.
[2:19:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:19:37] Whatever head, however I closed, I want
[2:19:39] you just to worship him right now.
[2:19:42] [Music]
[2:19:45] Hallelujah.
[2:19:48] Hallelujah.
[2:19:50] Brother Andrew, I'm just a little
[2:19:51] person, a little young person, and just
[2:19:53] go to a small church and don't hardly
[2:19:55] nobody know us. And oh, don't believe
[2:19:59] that. You're
[2:20:01] unlimited. You're an unlimited young
[2:20:03] person tonight.
[2:20:05] How be would say, "Lord, I want to be
[2:20:06] equipped by your spirit, God. This is
[2:20:09] more than just hearing sermons. It's
[2:20:11] more than just going to youth
[2:20:13] camp. Lord, fill me with power for
[2:20:16] service, Lord. Lord, make me the
[2:20:18] strongest backer in my church. Make me a
[2:20:21] pillar in my church, Lord. Make me a
[2:20:24] support to my pastor. Make me a make me
[2:20:27] a help,
[2:20:30] Lord." Hallelujah.
[2:20:34] Hallelujah. God bless you. Hallelujah.
[2:20:38] God, we believe. God, we believe. God,
[2:20:43] we believe
[2:20:45] forever from the impossible. Oh, it
[2:20:49] looks impossible.
[2:20:52] There's an unlimited God on the inside
[2:20:54] of you, young people. God, we believe.
[2:20:58] God, we believe forever.
[2:21:02] Move the
[2:21:05] unmovable. Break the
[2:21:09] unbreakable. God we
[2:21:13] believe. God we believe for it from the
[2:21:22] impossible. See a
[2:21:25] miracle. God we believe.
[2:21:30] God, we believe
[2:21:34] forever. You said you
[2:21:38] [Music]
[2:21:40] said I
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:44] believe. You
[2:21:48] said it is done.
[2:21:51] [Music]
[2:21:53] You
[2:21:54] [Music]
[2:21:56] said I
[2:22:00] believe. You
[2:22:03] said it is
[2:22:06] done. Move the
[2:22:09] unmovable. Move the
[2:22:11] [Applause]
[2:22:12] unmovable. Break the
[2:22:16] unbreakable. God we believe.

[2:22:26] [Applause]
[2:22:28] impossible see your
[2:22:32] miracle. God we
[2:22:35] believe God we believe for you.
[2:22:44] They say this mountain can't be
[2:22:50] moved. They say these chains will never
[2:22:58] break. But they don't know you like me
[2:23:03] do. Oh
[2:23:04] my. There is
[2:23:07] power in your name.
[2:23:14] We heard that there is no way
[2:23:20] through. We heard the tide will never
[2:23:28] change. They haven't seen what you can
[2:23:33] do. There is
[2:23:36] power in your name. So much
[2:23:41] power. So much
[2:23:43] power in your
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:53] name. Break the
[2:23:57] unbreakable we believe.
[2:24:01] I believe for
[2:24:05] it
[2:24:08] impossible to see a
[2:24:12] miracle. We
[2:24:15] believe
[2:24:18] [Music]
[2:24:22] we break the
[2:24:26] unbreakable we believe.
[2:24:31] We believe for it from the
[2:24:37] impossible to see a
[2:24:41] miracle. God we
[2:24:44] believe God we believe for it.
[2:24:53] We know that hope is never
[2:24:59] lost. For there is

[3:20:40] our
[3:20:41] heart. Those that are traveling, Lord,
