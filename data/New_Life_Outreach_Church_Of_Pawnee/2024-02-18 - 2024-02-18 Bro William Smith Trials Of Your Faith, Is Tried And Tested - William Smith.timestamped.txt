[42:52] tested when Jesus Christ came out of his
[42:55] baptism
[42:57] he was
[43:00] tested Jesus had to be tested to be
[43:03] proven who he was he had to be an
[43:06] example he had to
[43:08] be a savior that was going to save the
[43:12] world if they chose him to be their
[43:15] savior he had to show the people that in

[50:00] charged we're getting filled we're
[50:02] getting something from God that'll help
[50:05] us through that day of hard times when
[50:07] we're down in the valley down in the
[50:10] Grumps down to swimming Through The
[50:12] Valleys through the rivers and things
[50:13] and where Waters almost above our heads

[50:18] swimming and all a sudden you step on a
[50:20] rock you you can stand up and you tread
[50:22] in

[50:27] go under but you come back up cuz you're
[50:30] fighting these trials get hard I know
[50:33] they get hard to us I know we go through
[50:36] pressure I can't imagine getting one
[50:39] wrist broke and then just a little while
[50:41] longer getting the other one
[50:44] broke I can't imagine being 80 years old
[50:48] I can't imagine it but I know it's hard
[50:50] I can see it in my family church
[50:53] members 70 you're hard
[50:56] some of you can't even stand up and read
[50:59] the word with us cuz your body's aching
[51:01] why because there's testing you're going
[51:04] through a test in your old
[51:08] age that's why we need one another so
[51:13] much as all adults want these kids right

[51:19] exceed then quit putting them
[51:22] down when they make mistake lift them
[51:27] up sometimes we forget to get that big
[51:30] old beam out of our own eye that big old
[51:33] trial that we've got that we're not
[51:35] taking care of business in this on eye
[51:38] but we can see everybody else's faults
[51:41] we're worrying about other
[51:45] people worry about
[51:52] yourself because you're an individual
[51:56] God deals with
[51:58] individually you've got a road that
[52:01] youve got to go on I got to go on a road
[52:03] and this road is going to be hard it's
[52:06] not going to be
[52:09] simple I've got a of Journey of William

[1:21:42] more power and more power and more power
[1:21:45] until this body is changed and when this
[1:21:48] body is
[1:21:50] changed no devil in hell will ever
[1:21:53] fiddle with me no more because I have a
[1:21:56] new mind I have a new heart and my soul
[1:22:00] is
[1:22:03] satisfied
[1:22:06] why because it kept fighting the soul
[1:22:09] keeps
[1:22:11] fighting and one day that black dog is
[1:22:14] going to be stomped in the
[1:22:16] ground and he's going to be pushed off
[1:22:19] the
[1:22:21] edge and and the white dog is going to
[1:22:24] rain forever more in his promise

[1:22:43] knowing that God's going to do it I
[1:22:45] don't know how he's going to raise him
[1:22:46] up but he's going to die and he lays him
[1:22:48] up there and his son as he going up the

[1:29:29] scene so when I paid my ties I paid
[1:29:32] these things off God has always blessed
[1:29:35] brother
[1:29:36] William when I did it he still blessed
[1:29:39] me because I'm his son but it's a whole
[1:29:42] lot better when you're living right and
[1:29:44] you're doing right and you're doing
[1:29:46] everything you can and he comes and
[1:29:48] gives you a big old hug and say I got it
[1:29:50] be little guy God little sister I got
[1:29:57] you but we're going to go through
[1:30:01] trials we're going to go through trials
[1:30:04] let me move up a little bit now notice
[1:30:07] just in a
[1:30:11] moment now we see in the election that
[1:30:15] God calls Abraham and notice the first
[1:30:19] thing when he calls man he calls for
[1:30:23] total separation from the world total
[1:30:28] separation from
[1:30:30] yourself
[1:30:32] Abraham as soon as he got his
[1:30:35] call he separated
[1:30:38] himself from the things of the world he
[1:30:40] left his hometown he left everything and
[1:30:44] he followed God and he was tested and
[1:30:48] tested and tested and tested until the
[1:30:51] day he went in the grave you and I are
[1:30:54] going to be tested every day of Our
[1:30:56] Lives amen every Christian in here
[1:31:00] that's born again when God calls you
[1:31:04] calls for total separation if he did if
[1:31:08] he didn't you got the wrong call
[1:31:12] see that's
[1:31:15] powerful
[1:31:18] now he says here I want to skip some of
[1:31:21] this but he was talking about child uh
[1:31:25] uh being chasing and trials and you're
[1:31:28] going through it and and child training
[1:31:31] and schooling and all these ex
[1:31:33] experiences that you have to go through
[1:31:35] as a son and then he goes on and he
[1:31:37] keeps on going you have to go through
[1:31:38] them trials and through tribulations
[1:31:42] suffer persecution then you're
[1:31:45] endure these things you are real
[1:31:48] children of God he says okay so we're
[1:31:51] going to move up a little bit bit
[1:31:51] farther and he says now but after death
[1:31:55] Faith sees the
[1:31:58] resurrection and God of Resurrection so
[1:32:01] when you are dead in this world to the
[1:32:04] things of the world you're looking at
[1:32:07] one thing
[1:32:09] Resurrection right you want to go
[1:32:13] home
[1:32:15] right and so here he stands and he's
[1:32:18] he's talking and he goes now that's the
[1:32:21] power of Faith to
[1:32:22] believe when he asked stand over behind
[1:32:26] the Dark Cloud that you can't see with
[1:32:29] your natural eye but Faith stands by you
[1:32:33] directs you to that God's resurrection
[1:32:38] and God of all wisdom
[1:32:42] oh ordain our path he stands just behind
[1:32:47] every
[1:32:48] trial I love that he said don't don't
[1:32:51] you to know that Peter said that every
[1:32:56] trial is worthy more to us than gold for
[1:33:01] it's working every son that comes to God
[1:33:05] must first be
[1:33:08] tried struggles
[1:33:10] chasing if you get a little heart broke
[1:33:14] over you get born
[1:33:17] again little trials that's upsets you
[1:33:21] somewhere and you run back into the
[1:33:24] world again it shows you wasn't a child
[1:33:28] to begin with you become a illegitimate
[1:33:32] child and not a child of God James 1
[1:33:36] and2 James 1 and2 it says my beloved
[1:33:39] count it all joy when he fall into
[1:33:43] divver temptation knowing this that the
[1:33:46] trials of your faith worketh patience
[1:33:49] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:33:53] that he may be perfect and endure
[1:33:56] waiting nothing if any of you lack
[1:33:59] wisdom let him ask of God and giveth to
[1:34:03] all men Liberty and
[1:34:07] upbring up bringeth not did I say that
[1:34:10] word
[1:34:12] right yeah close enough it shall be
[1:34:15] given him but let him ask in faith
[1:34:19] nothing wavering for he that waver is
[1:34:22] like a wave of sea dive with a wind of
[1:34:27] toss I don't want to be tossed around I
[1:34:30] want to stand my grounds I want to stand
[1:34:33] on the promise of God and if it kills me
[1:34:37] I'm going to stand
[1:34:40] Hallelujah now Abraham had to be tested
[1:34:44] we have to be
[1:34:45] tested but there is one thing that I
[1:34:48] would like to say this
[1:34:50] morning
[1:34:52] that in the scriptures I read this
[1:34:55] morning or a little while ago then
[1:34:57] brother Brown came back and says but
[1:34:59] there is a gold of
[1:35:01] God do you know who that
[1:35:05] is only one person in here said me
[1:35:11] wow wasn't a
[1:35:14] trick but this piece of gold that God
[1:35:19] grabbed out of that ground
[1:35:21] he couldn't see himself in
[1:35:25] it when you first came to
[1:35:28] God you had crud all over you you had
[1:35:32] dross you had all kinds of malice you
[1:35:35] had all kinds of things that was
[1:35:38] blocking you away from a complete
[1:35:42] fellowship with
[1:35:45] God and so the master went to
[1:35:49] work he gets in into his shop and he
[1:35:53] gets that fire burning really hot in
[1:35:55] that
[1:35:57] oven and he gets that little Clump and
[1:36:01] he sticks it in there and he gets it
[1:36:03] starts getting where can squeeze it a
[1:36:05] little bit with his t uh tongues that
[1:36:07] he's
[1:36:09] got and he gets that thing out and he
[1:36:11] sits it up there on the Mallet and he
[1:36:13] starts beating it and he's beating it
[1:36:17] and then he beats it and then he beats
[1:36:20] it trials after Trials Come trials after
[1:36:24] Trials Come tribulation comes oh
[1:36:28] everything's upon you beating you he
[1:36:31] grabs it and he sticks it back in the
[1:36:33] fire some
[1:36:34] more H that furnace it gets hot and
[1:36:37] harder and he brings it back out and he
[1:36:39] beats it and he beats it and he beats
[1:36:44] it until one day he gets it about so
[1:36:49] big and he looks
[1:36:52] up and he sees
[1:36:57] himself that's the
[1:37:01] day we're going to cross the
[1:37:03] line into our new
[1:37:08] body and we're going to rain forever
[1:37:12] more and we're going to sit there in
[1:37:14] that wedding
[1:37:16] supper and we're going to be talking to
[1:37:18] all these brothers and
[1:37:22] sisters from the day of
[1:37:25] Pentecost all the way up to

[1:42:00] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[1:42:04] receive the Crown of
[1:42:07] Life which the Lord hath promised to
[1:42:10] them that love him Romans
[1:42:15] 833 who shall lay anything to the charge
[1:42:19] of God's elect
[1:42:21] it is God that justify who is he that
[1:42:25] condemn it is Christ that died yay
[1:42:29] rather that he raised again who is even
[1:42:34] at the right hand of God who also make
[1:42:38] intercession for
[1:42:40] us who shall separate us from the love
[1:42:43] of Christ shall tribulation distress or
[1:42:48] persecution or fame or nakedness or
[1:42:52] princel or
[1:42:55] sword as it is

[1:43:24] nor things present nor things to come no
[1:43:29] height no depth nor any other creature
[1:43:32] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:43:37] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:43:42] lord I got two more is uh Isaiah

[1:44:12] the fame and to them that love have no
[1:44:16] might and increased strength even the
[1:44:20] youth shall faint and be weary and the
[1:44:24] youth men shall utter fou but they that
[1:44:28] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:44:31] strength they shall Mount up with wings
