[22:39] Just before I start to sing, I want to
[22:41] say that
[22:42] there's a lot of things going on in the
[22:44] world right now. Just a lot of death,
[22:49] just persecution of everyone.
[22:52] I just want to say that
[22:56] if death scares you, it shouldn't. If
[22:58] you choose Jesus,
[23:00] there's nothing that'll hold you down.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Well, there ain't no grave
[23:12] &gt;&gt; that can hold my body down.
[23:18] I say there ain't no grave
[23:23] that can hold my body down.
[23:28] When I hear that trumpet sound,
[23:33] I'm going to get up out of the ground
[23:38] because there ain't no grave
[23:42] that can hold my body
[23:46] down.
[23:49] Oh well, fear is a liar with a smooth
[23:53] and velvet tongue.
[23:55] And fear is a tyrant. He's always
[23:59] telling me to run. Oh, love is a
[24:03] resurrection.
[24:05] And love is a trumpet sound. And love is
[24:09] my weapon. I'm going to tear these
[24:12] giants down. No, there ain't no grave
[24:17] that can hold my body down. No, there
[24:20] ain't no grave
[24:23] that can hold my body down. No, there
[24:26] ain't no grave
[24:29] that can hold my body down. No, there
[24:32] ain't no grave
[24:36] that can hold my body down.
[24:40] Oh, there was a battle, a war between
[24:45] death and life.
[24:47] And there on a tree, the lamb of God was
[24:51] crucified.
[24:53] He went on down to hell and he took back
[24:57] every king and he rose up on the third
[25:01] day just to set all the captives free.
[25:04] No, there ain't no grave
[25:08] that can hold my body down. No, there
[25:11] ain't no grave
[25:15] that can hold my body down. No, there
[25:17] ain't no grave
[25:21] that can hold my body down. No, there
[25:24] ain't no grave
[25:27] that can hold my body down.
[25:32] Well, look way down the river and what
[25:36] do you think I see?
[25:38] I see a band of angels and they're
[25:42] coming after me.
[25:45] Meet me, Jesus. Meet me. Won't you meet
[25:48] me in the middle of the air? And I know
[25:51] my wings won't fail me so I can meet you

[26:09] no grave
[26:12] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[26:15] no grave
[26:18] that can hold my body down.
[26:23] Well, look down yonder, Gabriel. Put
[26:27] your feet on the land and sea.
[26:30] But Gable, don't you blow your trumpet
[26:33] until you hear from me. Well, meet me,
[26:37] mother and father. Won't you meet me
[26:40] down the river road? And mommy, you know
[26:44] that I'll be there when I check in. My
[26:47] Lord, there ain't no grave
[26:52] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[26:55] no grave
[26:58] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[27:01] no grave
[27:04] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[27:07] no grave
[27:10] that can hold my body down.
[27:15] Well, you can take me out to the
[27:17] graveyard. You can lay my body down. But
[27:21] when Gabriel blows that trumpet, I'm
[27:25] going to get up out of the ground. I'm
[27:28] singing, "Meet me, Jesus, meet me. Won't
[27:31] you meet me in the middle of the air?
[27:34] And I know my wings won't fail me. I'm
[27:37] going to say goodbye down here. There
[27:40] ain't no grave

[45:37] here on this earth.
[45:39] But boy, it's going to be a wonderful
[45:41] day when we drop this old body, put on
[45:45] that glorified body, and it'll be a Oh,
[45:49] there will be some rejoicing going on
[45:51] there.
[45:53] [Music]
[45:55] While
[45:57] his presence is sweet tonight,
[46:00] I'd like for us to pray for brother
[46:03] Steve Martin.
[46:05] been declining in his health this last
[46:08] year or so and
[46:10] and um
[46:12] struggling with with MS and
[46:16] he's just gotten to where he can't even
[46:19] hardly get out of bed
[46:22] and his wife and children are are here
[46:25] today tonight
[46:28] and um
[46:31] but they may be having to go home
[46:33] tomorrow. uh because he's just not doing
[46:37] very well. And
[46:39] how many loves brother Steve Martin? We
[46:42] love brother Steve Martin.
[46:49] And I wonder if while while his presence
[46:53] is is is sweet and solemn, let's just
[46:56] ask the Lord to go there to Hot Springs
[47:00] and and touch our brother Steve.
[47:04] Father,

[47:09] down, Lord. And

[47:20] father, we're just asking that
[47:23] you would drop by his way tonight.
[47:27] That you would send your word to him and
[47:30] that you would deliver him of that devil
[47:35] that is trying to take his life.
[47:39] God, we ask that you would bring freedom
[47:41] to him and that you would heal that body
[47:45] Lord and renew him in his mind and bring
[47:49] courage to him, Lord.
[47:52] Lord, let him know the love that we have
[47:54] for him, Father. I pray, Lord, that you
[47:58] would touch him and make him whole. And
[48:01] may may we have a testimony even even
[48:04] this week of what your glory has done
[48:07] for our brother. Raise him up, Lord. We

[56:19] on the scene. Amen. And we've got a
[56:21] wonderful atmosphere of praise and
[56:23] worship in the building. The Bible says
[56:26] that he inhabits the praises of his
[56:28] people. And that's that's what we're
[56:30] looking for tonight is an indwelling of
[56:33] this service for that he would come and
[56:35] not just be God above us. Not even God

[56:57] Tabernacle. And it's such an honor to be
[56:59] here and so special. We uh we really
[57:02] love Brother Wendell and and this
[57:04] ministry, the the saints here,
[57:06] everything that you do for the Lord, the
[57:08] labor, uh you know, that it it doesn't
[57:11] go unnoticed.
[57:13] the what's been poured out for the
[57:15] kingdom of God, you know, uh just uh
[57:17] think of the Martin brothers and their
[57:19] years on the field of evangelism, you
[57:22] know, and and uh and sacrifice and and
[57:25] how we've all benefited from their
[57:27] gifts.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh they've been instrumental in my
[57:30] life and in our church and my family.
[57:32] And so we appreciate them very much. We
[57:34] appreciate their youth camp. And it's
[57:35] good to see a lot of my nieces and
[57:37] nephews here tonight. And makes me feel
[57:40] right at home. But uh so we we love this
[57:42] this family and uh this church and
[57:44] they're just like family to us. So it's
[57:47] a real honor to be here. Of course, the
[57:49] way uh Brother Josh, Brother Austin,
[57:51] some of these other Oklahoma boys are
[57:52] operating, they're we're getting more
[57:54] like family all the time.
[57:58] More like family all the time. Amen. But
[58:00] uh we just pray that those bonds would
[58:02] stay strong. Amen. Continue on to the
[58:05] coming of the Lord till we run out of
[58:06] mask girls anyway. So Amen. God bless
[58:09] you tonight. Amen. Let's just uh invite
[58:12] the Lord on the scene as we turn to the
[58:13] word of God. Psalm chapter 115.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Well, tonight uh I don't know if any of
[58:35] you like to eat sushi.
[58:39] The thing about it, I I love sushi. The
[58:42] thing about it, it's it's fresh,
[58:44] &gt;&gt; but it's raw.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tonight, I just we're working
[58:48] through some things that are fresh to
[58:49] me, but I'm excited about them. And
[58:51] we're just asking that the Lord would
[58:53] just take it in his hands
[58:54] &gt;&gt; and put it together the way that he
[58:56] wants it tonight. Amen. Psalm chapter
[58:58] 115
[59:00] verses 1 to8.
[59:02] Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but
[59:06] unto thy name give glory. For thy mercy,
[59:11] and for thy truth's sake. Wherefore
[59:14] should the heathen say, Where is now
[59:16] their God? But our God is in the
[59:18] heavens. He hath done whatsoever he hath
[59:21] pleased.
[59:23] Watch this now. Their idols are silver
[59:26] and gold, the work of men's hands. They
[59:29] have mouths, but they speak not. Eyes
[59:33] have they, but they see not. They have
[59:37] ears, but they hear not. Noses have
[59:39] they, but they smell not. They have
[59:42] hands, but they handle not, and feet
[59:44] have they, but they walk not, neither
[59:46] speak they through their throat.
[59:49] And this is amazing to me. They that
[59:51] make them are like unto them. So is
[59:54] everyone that trusteth in them. Amen.
[59:58] And I I'd like to uh minister tonight on
[1:00:00] idols that speak.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[1:00:04] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we love
[1:00:07] you tonight, Lord, and we feel your
[1:00:09] presence in this place, Lord. Lord, more
[1:00:12] than anything, we just want to be out of
[1:00:13] your way, Lord, that that you, Lord,
[1:00:17] could speak a word tonight,
[1:00:19] Lord, through through frail human lips,
[1:00:22] Lord. Lord, that would strike a heart,
[1:00:24] Lord, and quicken something, Lord, to to
[1:00:26] life, Father, we could know who we are,
[1:00:29] Lord, how we're positioned, Lord, and
[1:00:31] what you're doing in this day, Father,
[1:00:33] and see it a little more clearly
[1:00:34] tonight. Lord, I I'm so inadequate
[1:00:37] tonight, Lord, but you're the
[1:00:39] allsufficient one, Lord. I I want to be
[1:00:42] in total surrender to you, Father. May
[1:00:45] it not only go for the speaker tonight,
[1:00:47] Lord, but for every hearer, Lord, for
[1:00:49] everyone that's gathered together, Lord,
[1:00:51] everyone, Lord, under the sound, Lord,
[1:00:53] of your word. I pray, Father, that we,
[1:00:56] Lord, would just be taken up in your
[1:00:57] hands, Father, that you would move in
[1:01:00] us, Lord, amongst us, and through us,
[1:01:02] Father, have your way. I pray in Jesus
[1:01:06] name. Amen. God bless you as you're
[1:01:08] seated tonight. Amen. Well, we've read
[1:01:10] this beautiful psalm about the idolatry
[1:01:13] of the heathen. Amen. And how that all
[1:01:16] of their gods are man-made things and
[1:01:18] they Amen. they they they uh they're
[1:01:21] beautiful. They're costly. They're made
[1:01:23] of silver and they're made of gold. But
[1:01:25] the scripture says they have eyes that
[1:01:27] cannot see, ears that cannot hear. Amen.
[1:01:30] And and and twice it's mentioned that uh
[1:01:32] that they have mouths but they do not
[1:01:34] speak. Amen. And uh and and you know uh
[1:01:38] there's there's a lot of idolatry that's
[1:01:40] happened in this world and in the in the
[1:01:42] human race. You know that brother
[1:01:44] Brandham teaches us that man is made to
[1:01:46] worship. He'll he'll worship anything.
[1:01:48] He'll bow and he'll scrape. He'll kiss a
[1:01:50] rock. He'll kiss a tree. Amen. He'll
[1:01:52] he'll he'll he'll do whatever he can to
[1:01:54] try to express uh the attribute of
[1:01:58] worship that is in him. Amen. And Amen.
[1:02:00] And and and so worship is is something
[1:02:02] that God has put into man. But the
[1:02:04] problem that we get to is when our
[1:02:05] worship, Amen, is placed in the wrong
[1:02:08] things and place and directed to the
[1:02:09] wrong place. Amen. and and uh you know
[1:02:12] we're taught that brother Bram said that
[1:02:13] an idol isn't just you know it's a
[1:02:15] little figure made out of silver or gold
[1:02:16] that you set on your desk or you know
[1:02:18] put in a shrine but he said an idol a
[1:02:20] real idol is anything how many know that
[1:02:23] comes between you and God anything
[1:02:25] between brother sister and you know uh
[1:02:28] you know and and and we're all we're all
[1:02:30] familiar with that in our Christian walk
[1:02:31] we get we get our priorities wrong
[1:02:33] sometimes and and we're always under
[1:02:35] that temptation there's a cycle of of
[1:02:37] humanity where where man is just always
[1:02:39] looking after the wrong things to
[1:02:41] worship and always pointing his worship
[1:02:43] in the wrong places. And surely a
[1:02:45] meeting like this is a time, you know,
[1:02:47] to consecrate ourselves and to examine
[1:02:49] our lives and look at our priorities and
[1:02:51] and say, "Lord, is there anything in my
[1:02:53] life that has come between me and you,
[1:02:56] Lord, because I I don't want anything
[1:02:58] between uh Amen. as the old song says,
[1:03:00] nothing between my soul and my savior."
[1:03:02] Amen. I I want that experience of being
[1:03:04] one with him, in communion with him.
[1:03:07] Amen. united with him, not having to go
[1:03:09] between any kind of a form of worship.
[1:03:12] Amen. Or or or having any idolatry in my
[1:03:14] life, but I want to be a restored
[1:03:16] worshipper. Amen. That's in a personal
[1:03:19] communion with God. Amen. And so, you
[1:03:21] know, there's all kinds of idols that
[1:03:22] people get running after. It could be
[1:03:23] worldly pleasures. It could be
[1:03:25] temptations. It could be pride. It could
[1:03:27] be all those kind of things. But, Amen.
[1:03:28] I, you know, I believe the biggest idols
[1:03:30] that we've got in the human race are the
[1:03:32] religious idols. And brother Brandon
[1:03:34] would call them denominations and creeds
[1:03:36] and traditions and Amen. things that uh
[1:03:39] that claim to to be set up for the
[1:03:42] worship of Jesus Christ, but the problem
[1:03:43] with them is that they're man-made.
[1:03:45] Amen. Amen. You know, a denomination is
[1:03:48] uh I it's a group, but it's not a group
[1:03:50] that God has made. It's a group that man
[1:03:52] has made. A creed, amen, is a good
[1:03:54] system of belief, but it's not a system
[1:03:55] of belief that God has revealed. It's
[1:03:57] something man has made. And you know a
[1:03:59] tradition is something that you know I
[1:04:02] it it can feel good and there can be a
[1:04:04] certain satisfaction in following our
[1:04:06] traditions but Amen. but traditions is
[1:04:08] not something God has put into place.
[1:04:10] It's something man has put into place.
[1:04:12] Amen. And the problem that we've had
[1:04:14] around the message is that there's been
[1:04:15] all kinds of idolatry that has happened
[1:04:18] even in our own message ranks. It would
[1:04:19] be sad to say that we've got a message
[1:04:21] which has come to restore the bride.
[1:04:24] Amen. Back to a personal fellowship with
[1:04:27] God. Amen. But then men would come
[1:04:29] behind that message. Amen. And once
[1:04:31] again put the shikina glory of God back
[1:04:33] behind the veil of tradition, back
[1:04:35] behind forms of amen of creeds and back
[1:04:38] behind denominational groups and back
[1:04:40] behind man's teachings and man-made
[1:04:42] structures and all of those kind of
[1:04:43] things, friends. And amen. We we've had
[1:04:45] all kinds of message idols. We've had
[1:04:47] doctrines, amen, that have come between
[1:04:49] us and God. We've had little cults and
[1:04:51] little isms that have come between us
[1:04:53] and God. Amen. There's been
[1:04:54] personalities that have risen up that
[1:04:56] would try to stand between us and God.
[1:04:58] Amen. Traditions that would try to cover
[1:05:00] up his presence and keep us away, amen,
[1:05:03] from the presence of God. But listen,
[1:05:05] friends, if you want to, Amen. If you
[1:05:06] really want to get somewhere with this
[1:05:08] message, Amen. when you come into this
[1:05:10] message, you got to leave all of your
[1:05:12] little idols behind you. You got to
[1:05:14] leave your opinions behind you. You got
[1:05:16] to leave your traditions behind you. You
[1:05:18] got to forget about the way it was
[1:05:19] growing up and the way your old pastor
[1:05:21] used to teach it and the way it was in
[1:05:23] your church and the way that you think
[1:05:25] about it. Amen. Amen. You've got to
[1:05:27] leave it behind you. Amen. To follow the
[1:05:29] message. Amen. Because the message came
[1:05:32] not to set up idols. It came to break
[1:05:34] idols. It came to destroy the works of
[1:05:36] the devil. It came to destroy man-made
[1:05:38] religion. Amen. It came to bring us out
[1:05:41] of the bondage of those things and put
[1:05:42] us back into a reality of a fellowship
[1:05:45] with God. Could you imagine? You know,
[1:05:47] uh, Moses built a tabernacle in the
[1:05:49] wilderness and in that little tent,
[1:05:50] Amen, was a room where a man could enter
[1:05:53] in there and he could come into the
[1:05:55] personal presence of the literal life of
[1:05:57] the God that created the universe. And
[1:06:00] could you imagine coming into that holy
[1:06:02] place and amen and coming into that just
[1:06:04] that that that holy and reverent
[1:06:06] presence and amen and walk into that
[1:06:08] tabernacle dragging your little Egyptian
[1:06:10] idol behind you. Amen. That friend, what
[1:06:13] a terrible thing that would be. But
[1:06:14] Amen. That's exactly what it is. Amen.
[1:06:17] When you try to take the message and
[1:06:18] keep your opinion and try to take the
[1:06:21] message and and carry on with an old
[1:06:23] tradition. Amen. You want a message, but
[1:06:25] you want a personality to stand between
[1:06:27] you and the God of the message. Amen.
[1:06:29] You want another king. You want another
[1:06:31] bishop. You want a Amen. It's idolatry,
[1:06:33] friends. Amen. But look, the message
[1:06:36] came for the breaking of idols. Brother
[1:06:38] Brandham stood in South Africa and he
[1:06:40] made an altar call. He manifested the
[1:06:42] supernatural presence of God. And he
[1:06:44] called on all the idol on all the pagans
[1:06:46] and all the heathens of South Africa.
[1:06:48] Amen. To throw down their idols, amen,
[1:06:50] and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother
[1:06:53] Brand said when he made that call, there
[1:06:55] was a dust cloud, amen, that rose up in
[1:06:57] that place, amen, of idols being thrown
[1:07:00] down. Brother, sister, I've got a
[1:07:02] vision, amen, for this generation of
[1:07:04] message believers. I'd like to break
[1:07:06] some idols. Amen. I'd like to raise up
[1:07:09] some young believers. Amen. That won't
[1:07:11] fault bondage to the traditions of the
[1:07:13] elders. Amen. But they'll walk in the
[1:07:15] light of the word and be restored to
[1:07:17] fellowship with God. Amen. I I I'm an
[1:07:20] idol breaker. I'm an iconoclass. Amen. I
[1:07:23] don't I don't want a form. I don't want
[1:07:25] nothing man-made in my worship.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I don't want to worship a god
[1:07:29] through idolatry. I want to break some
[1:07:32] idols.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram told about the the one
[1:07:34] native there in Africa. Remember how he
[1:07:37] was a Christian man, but he packed his
[1:07:38] little idol? Amen. And it was that, you
[1:07:40] know what that idol was? It was the
[1:07:41] tradition of his elders. It was his
[1:07:43] daddy's idol. Amen. He said, "Daddy, use
[1:07:46] this idol." Amen. And it scared off a
[1:07:48] lion. So, I keep it just in case. I'm a
[1:07:51] Christian. I serve the Lord. I worship
[1:07:54] God. I worship Jesus Christ. But just in
[1:07:56] case, I take my little Aoya, my little
[1:07:59] idol around. Amen. So, if Aoya fails,
[1:08:01] remember he said, "But this little idol
[1:08:03] won't fail." Amen. But, brother, sister,
[1:08:06] I don't have a backup plan as a message
[1:08:08] believer of this day. I'm not holding on
[1:08:10] to something just in case. Amen. What we
[1:08:12] try to do is we take a message. We say,
[1:08:14] "I'll believe the message, but just in
[1:08:16] case it don't fix my marriage. I'll hold
[1:08:18] on to my book, and I'll hold on to my
[1:08:20] 12step program just in case there's not
[1:08:23] enough power in it to deliver me from my
[1:08:25] addiction. I'll hold on to my little
[1:08:27] program, and I'll hold on to my
[1:08:29] psychology." Amen. Just in case the
[1:08:31] prophet was wrong, I'll hold on to my
[1:08:33] understanding. I'll hold on to my
[1:08:35] private interpretation. Amen. But let
[1:08:37] there be a generation, amen, of idol
[1:08:40] smashing Christians that'll take up this
[1:08:42] message and say there is no backup plan.
[1:08:45] There is no just in case. This message
[1:08:48] is thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. And I
[1:08:51] will not have anything between me and
[1:08:53] this word. And I will not serve a
[1:08:55] man-made creed.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen. Just in case just in case
[1:09:01] I can't trust Brother Brandom. Amen. I I
[1:09:04] I'll trust my education. I'll trust my
[1:09:06] intellectual teacher. I'll trust my my
[1:09:08] great, you know, charismatic leader.
[1:09:10] I'll trust the guy who can explain it
[1:09:12] better. I'll tr Oh, Brother Brand said,
[1:09:14] "The worst kind of heathen there is is
[1:09:16] an educated heathen." Amen. It's not an
[1:09:19] ignorant pagan in a jungle somewhere.
[1:09:21] Amen. It's an educated man who thinks
[1:09:23] that he's got the intelligence. He
[1:09:25] thinks he's got the answers. Amen. But
[1:09:28] friends, I don't have an answer. I don't
[1:09:30] have one thought coming, but I've got a
[1:09:32] God. Amen. And he's not a dead idol.
[1:09:35] He's a God that speaks. He's a God,
[1:09:38] amen, that that that uh that speaks in
[1:09:40] this day. I've got a message.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, there's been so much
[1:09:45] wasted energy, so much wasted effort in
[1:09:49] our own ranks
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; on idol building
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; cuz you know, a lot of effort goes into
[1:09:53] making an idol. Idols are beautiful,
[1:09:55] brother, sister. Idols are not something
[1:09:57] you don't just kind of hack it together
[1:09:58] out of 2x4s and, you know, and just make
[1:10:01] a little uh cut out of cardboard or
[1:10:03] plywood and make that your idol. Amen.
[1:10:05] No, there's there's sacrifice that goes
[1:10:07] into idol making. There's works that
[1:10:09] goes into it. There's beauty that go
[1:10:11] into it. Amen. But at the end of the
[1:10:13] day, it's still just the work of men's
[1:10:15] hands. How many know it's just the work
[1:10:17] of men's hands? You know, Paul Paul, he
[1:10:19] taught us in the book of Hebrews about
[1:10:21] the ministration of death and the
[1:10:22] ministration of life. Amen. Amen. And so
[1:10:25] there's two kinds of ministries. There's
[1:10:26] the ministry of death under a dead law,
[1:10:28] a dead letter. And there's a ministry of
[1:10:31] life under the spirit. Amen. But he
[1:10:33] said, "But the ministration of death is
[1:10:35] glorious. It's beautiful." Look,
[1:10:38] friends, dead Christianity is beautiful.
[1:10:40] Amen. Dead religion is beautiful. You
[1:10:43] say, "What do you mean, Brother Nathan?"
[1:10:45] Amen. I mean, I mean, I mean, people
[1:10:47] Amen. serve a dead god with a beautiful
[1:10:50] Christianity, with beautiful churches,
[1:10:52] beautiful communities, beautiful
[1:10:54] preaching, beautiful songs, beautiful
[1:10:57] sermons. Amen. But can you imagine,
[1:11:00] Amen, uh uh spending all your life,
[1:11:02] Amen, trying to make something beautiful
[1:11:04] and you're just a minister of death. And
[1:11:06] we've had a lot of ministry, Amen,
[1:11:08] around the message that has ministered
[1:11:10] nothing but death. Amen. By bringing
[1:11:12] their man-made ideas, man-made
[1:11:14] traditions into a living word, friends.
[1:11:17] Amen. It's beautiful. It's beautiful
[1:11:18] death. It'll Amen. If you take this
[1:11:20] message and you take a living God out of
[1:11:22] it, it'll still make you a beautiful
[1:11:24] church. It'll still make you a beautiful
[1:11:26] community. It'll still make you
[1:11:27] beautiful preaching, beautiful singing.
[1:11:29] And Amen. beautiful worship. It'll be a
[1:11:31] beautiful idol. Amen. But look, friends,
[1:11:33] the problem with a dead idol, the
[1:11:35] scripture says the ones that worship
[1:11:37] dead idols are just like them. Amen. And
[1:11:39] if all you got in your life is a God
[1:11:42] that can't speak, hands that can't
[1:11:44] handle, eyes that can't see, ears that
[1:11:46] can't hear, you're going to be just like
[1:11:49] the dead god that you live. It'll be
[1:11:51] dead men worshiping a dead god under a
[1:11:53] dead creed under a dead tradition.
[1:11:56] Hallelujah. Amen. But there's a ministry
[1:11:58] of life. Amen. The ministry of the
[1:12:01] spirit. Amen. Which has brought us into
[1:12:04] a reality.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; That's the problem with dead religion.
[1:12:08] It's beautiful, but it doesn't speak.
[1:12:10] Amen. When you get down in a dark trial,
[1:12:12] your old dead religion, amen, isn't
[1:12:15] going to give you an answer. Amen. It
[1:12:17] can't give you comfort. It can't give
[1:12:19] you leadership. It can't bring you
[1:12:21] deliverance cuz it can't speak. Amen.
[1:12:23] It's just a dumb old man-made religion.
[1:12:25] That's all you got as a church member.
[1:12:27] That's all you got as a as a carnal
[1:12:29] message believer. You say, "Brother
[1:12:31] Nathan, I dress right. Yeah, it's
[1:12:33] beautiful." Amen. I talk right. It's
[1:12:35] beautiful. I go to the right church. I
[1:12:38] got the right kind of pastor. I believe
[1:12:40] God sent a prophet. That's beautiful,
[1:12:42] friends. But it might still be dead.
[1:12:44] Amen. But God sent a message. Amen. To
[1:12:47] minister life to the hearer.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Life. Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; To put us back in touch with a God that
[1:12:53] speaks. Brother Bam said heathens, they
[1:12:55] bow down. They worship their idol and
[1:12:57] they prostrate themselves and they work
[1:12:59] it up in their minds that that idol's
[1:13:00] talking to them.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said that's contrary.
[1:13:04] That's just that's exactly turned around
[1:13:06] of what God is. Amen. God doesn't deal
[1:13:09] with idols. Here we go now. You are his
[1:13:12] instrument. You prostrate yourself
[1:13:15] before God and he comes in you and he
[1:13:19] speaks out to the people. That's the
[1:13:21] difference. That's the difference. Say,
[1:13:23] "What's the difference, brother Nathan,
[1:13:25] between this message and any other
[1:13:27] denomination? What's different between
[1:13:29] me and a Pentecostal? What's the
[1:13:31] difference between me and a Baptist?
[1:13:33] What's the difference between me, Amen,
[1:13:34] and any of these other groups, Amen. The
[1:13:36] difference is, Amen. when you are his
[1:13:39] instrument through this message that
[1:13:41] Amen. He's a living God for a living
[1:13:44] person. He's not a dead creed for a dead
[1:13:46] Christianity. He's a living God for a
[1:13:48] living person. Not a dead god to a dead
[1:13:51] idol, but a living God to a living
[1:13:53] being. Amen. Friends, I wherever you're
[1:13:56] at in your life, you may have you may
[1:13:58] not know anything but a dead idol. Your
[1:14:00] Christianity might just amount to a to a
[1:14:02] stone. Amen. Just a stone statue. Amen.
[1:14:05] Of a god that you can imagine. You can
[1:14:07] picture him in your mind. You can you
[1:14:09] can put a a certain image to him, but
[1:14:11] he's never spoken to you. Is he's got
[1:14:14] eyes that have never seen you. Amen.
[1:14:16] They never beheld you in your condition.
[1:14:17] Ears that can't hear your cries. Amen.
[1:14:20] Ears that can't hear your prayers. Amen.
[1:14:22] But oh my. But but when when the message
[1:14:25] came, it brought us a God that speaks.
[1:14:28] And I say, if the dead idol has a dead
[1:14:30] worshipper that's just like the idol he
[1:14:32] worships, what about a living God, Amen,
[1:14:35] with a Amen. What about a God that
[1:14:37] speaks? Well, then you've got a man with
[1:14:39] a message. If there's a God that speaks,
[1:14:42] there's going to be a worshshiper that
[1:14:43] speaks. He's got a word. He's got a
[1:14:46] message. He's got something to say.
[1:14:48] Hallelujah.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what you are. You're a man
[1:14:53] with a message. You're you're God's
[1:14:54] letter. Brother Bram said, "You're a
[1:14:56] written epistle.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; A written epistle. God is in you,
[1:15:00] manifesting himself through you." And he
[1:15:02] said, "And you are a living idol of God,
[1:15:06] a living representative of God, walking
[1:15:09] around with God speaking through your
[1:15:12] lips to others."
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wasn't it true in Ezekiel 36?
[1:15:17] Amen. God said, "You might have tablets
[1:15:19] of stone that have my word." He said,
[1:15:22] "But I've got something more for you
[1:15:23] than that old dead letter. I've got
[1:15:25] something more for you than a ministry
[1:15:26] that'll kill you. Amen. And put you to
[1:15:28] death, Amen. and punish you and send you
[1:15:31] to hell and send you to punishment and
[1:15:33] put you under condemnation." He said,
[1:15:35] "My word will not always be carved into
[1:15:38] stone." Amen. But one day, amen, I will
[1:15:41] carve it on the fleshly tables of the
[1:15:43] heart. Amen. That's what the baptism of
[1:15:45] the Holy Ghost is. God didn't write his
[1:15:48] Amen. God didn't write his word just in
[1:15:50] a book. Amen. Or on a stone tablet, but
[1:15:52] he's writing it and inscribing it on the
[1:15:55] hearts of living, breathing Christian
[1:15:58] sons and daughters of God.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; You got something to say. That's what it
[1:16:02] means to be a living epistle. Amen. It
[1:16:04] means you don't have a dead letter. You
[1:16:05] got one that speaks. You got one that
[1:16:07] lives.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got one that moves.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that?
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's what that's what I
[1:16:15] am. I'm a living epistle. You say,
[1:16:17] "Brother Nathan, are you in the
[1:16:18] message?" Oh, it's better than that,
[1:16:20] brother. The message is in me. Amen. He
[1:16:23] wrote it in my heart. It was inscribed
[1:16:25] there. I had a part in it before the
[1:16:27] foundation of the world. And now I am
[1:16:30] here not to worship a dead figure of a
[1:16:33] God, but to carry his word in my heart
[1:16:36] and be a living, breathing image of the
[1:16:39] almighty God,
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; a restored son,
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; manifested
[1:16:44] child of God.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, that's that's the
[1:16:48] kind of word that we've got to have. We
[1:16:50] can we can we can uh mess around with
[1:16:52] this message. We can talk about tapes.
[1:16:55] We can quote our quotes. We can argue
[1:16:57] about our doctrines. Amen. We can try to
[1:16:59] ram it down people's throat. Try to get
[1:17:01] them to adopt a a lifestyle. Try to
[1:17:03] bring them under a standard. Amen. And
[1:17:05] force people into a form. Amen. But all
[1:17:08] of that is just the ministry of death.
[1:17:10] Amen. But through the ministry of life,
[1:17:12] through the ministry of the spirit.
[1:17:14] Amen. Amen. That look friends, we got
[1:17:17] more of a word than that. It's not a
[1:17:19] dead letter. How many know the highest
[1:17:21] form of the word is when the word is
[1:17:24] made flesh? Sure, God wrote his word in
[1:17:27] the heavens. Sure, he wrote it in the
[1:17:29] Bible. Amen. Sure, he wrote it through
[1:17:31] the messages of messengers and prophets
[1:17:33] down through the ages. But the highest
[1:17:35] form of his word, Amen, is when he takes
[1:17:38] it off the tablet. Amen. And he puts it,
[1:17:40] amen, and writes it on the fleshly
[1:17:42] tables of a heart in a living, breathing
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Christian,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; a son or daughter of God. That's the
[1:17:48] highest form of the word
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; is a word made flesh. Well, then why has
[1:17:51] there been so much why have we had so
[1:17:53] much arguing around the message? Why, as
[1:17:55] brother Matthew preached last night, why
[1:17:56] is there so much fussing? Why do we have
[1:17:58] to rise above so much uh Amen. so much
[1:18:01] friction and so much turmoil, so much
[1:18:03] doubt and unbelief and all these kind of
[1:18:05] things? Because the devil doesn't want
[1:18:07] you to see the message in its true form.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He wants to see you. He wants you to see
[1:18:13] it as a tradition. He wants you to see
[1:18:15] it as a teaching. He wants to see it as
[1:18:17] the way we believe it in my church
[1:18:19] versus the way we believe it in their
[1:18:21] church. He wants you to see it as an
[1:18:23] argument. He wants you to see it as a
[1:18:24] doctrine. He don't care how you see it.
[1:18:26] He just doesn't want you to see it in
[1:18:28] his true form.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached Christianity
[1:18:31] versus idolatry. He began to quote
[1:18:32] Ireneius. Amen. And when he preached
[1:18:34] against heresies and Ireinia said what a
[1:18:37] false teacher does, he said it's just
[1:18:39] like if they made a beautiful statue of
[1:18:40] a king and they made it out of all
[1:18:43] precious gems and precious stones and
[1:18:45] put it together in the beautiful image
[1:18:46] of a king. Amen. But he said what the
[1:18:48] false teacher does, he takes those
[1:18:50] jewels and he begins to rearrange them.
[1:18:52] Amen. He begins to look it he's it's
[1:18:54] it's still jewels. It's still valuable.
[1:18:57] It's still powerful. It's just in the
[1:18:59] wrong form. Amen. That's what that's
[1:19:01] what men have done with this message.
[1:19:02] They take the quotes, they take the
[1:19:04] scriptures, but they put it in the wrong
[1:19:06] form cuz they're trying to put it in the
[1:19:08] image of what they have in their mind.
[1:19:11] Amen. That's how they deceive you cuz
[1:19:13] it's a real true message and it's a real
[1:19:15] true word. Amen. But you got to see it
[1:19:18] in the form that it was intended.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that?
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Brand said, when you
[1:19:24] try to make the word of God say
[1:19:26] something to fit your organization,
[1:19:28] look, friends, I'm here to preach
[1:19:30] tonight. We're all guilty. Come on now.
[1:19:32] Amen. Every one of us have read have
[1:19:34] read the message or listen to it and
[1:19:36] brother Brandon will say something and
[1:19:37] it's just a little bit different than
[1:19:39] the way we wish he would have said it.
[1:19:41] It's just a little bit leaning in a way
[1:19:43] that we're uncomfortable with. So we
[1:19:44] want to gloss right over it. And we went
[1:19:46] to But friends, don't rearrange the
[1:19:48] word. Don't ever misplace it. Don't ever
[1:19:50] misuse it. Don't misrepresent it. God
[1:19:54] had an image in mind when he sent the
[1:19:56] word.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Let's look at what that image is. You're
[1:20:00] trying to make it say something to fit
[1:20:01] your organization. You're taking jewels
[1:20:03] out of the great king's body and you're
[1:20:05] making an image of a dog or a fox or a
[1:20:07] hog or something out of it. And you
[1:20:09] deceive the ignorant of the word. But
[1:20:12] brother Brand said, "Hallelujah. There's
[1:20:14] some who have the spirit of God and they
[1:20:16] stand for the word incarnate."
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; How many know what incarnate means? They
[1:20:21] stand for the word in flesh. Amen. The
[1:20:25] word in flesh. I know we've taught this
[1:20:27] message every which kind of way. We've
[1:20:29] represented every we twisted it in every
[1:20:31] different kind of shape. Amen. But the
[1:20:32] message I believe and the message I'm
[1:20:35] looking for is a message that's made
[1:20:36] flesh. Not something we can argue about.
[1:20:39] Not something to swap quotes and try to
[1:20:41] prove how spiritual we are. But a living
[1:20:43] breathing Amen. living breathing sons
[1:20:46] and daughters of God manifested with
[1:20:49] power and life and reality. That's the
[1:20:52] correct image friends.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. People take this word and and what
[1:20:57] do they do? They'll say, "Look at how
[1:20:59] spiritual I am. Look at how deep my
[1:21:01] teaching. I'm going to take this
[1:21:03] message. I'm going to snatch it out of
[1:21:04] your hands and I'm going to wrap it up
[1:21:06] and I'm going to rearrange it into a
[1:21:07] bunch of mysteries that are so far
[1:21:09] beyond you. You'll never reach it. Maybe
[1:21:11] if you come to my church and pay tithe
[1:21:13] for 50 years, maybe then you'll get the
[1:21:15] revelation." Amen. But look, friends.
[1:21:17] Amen. You can Amen. And so they they'll
[1:21:19] preach and they'll teach and they'll get
[1:21:22] a big crowd together. Amen. and quote
[1:21:24] their quotes, but it never quite takes
[1:21:26] shape. Amen. And too many people been
[1:21:29] spending too much time, Amen, trying to
[1:21:31] follow after an idolatrous version of
[1:21:34] the message of the hour that never takes
[1:21:36] shape. It never quite gets there. It
[1:21:38] never quite delivers on the promise. But
[1:21:41] I'm a living witness. Amen. That the
[1:21:44] spirit of God, Amen, is alive today. If
[1:21:46] you can get rid of your tradition, if
[1:21:49] you can pierce the veil,
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; you can see him. You can see him in his
[1:21:53] true form.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word incarnate. Amen.
[1:21:59] This message is not a mystery cult.
[1:22:01] Amen. God didn't send a message so a
[1:22:03] bunch of deep anointed teachers could
[1:22:05] wrap it up in a bunch of mysterious
[1:22:07] bondage and keep it back from you.
[1:22:10] That's not the mystery of the message. A
[1:22:12] mystery is a previously hidden truth.
[1:22:15] Amen. I agree that the word used to be
[1:22:17] mysterious, but not since God sent a
[1:22:19] prophet. Hallelujah. You say, "Well,
[1:22:21] then what's the mystery to it all,
[1:22:22] Brother Nathan? It's this mystery among
[1:22:25] the Gentiles. It's Christ not in heaven,
[1:22:30] not wrapped up behind a veil. Christ in
[1:22:32] you, the hope of glory.
[1:22:36] Hallelujah.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, if I could ever if I could ever just
[1:22:40] press my way. Oh, brother Nathan, if I
[1:22:41] could just get smart enough, if I could
[1:22:43] just get educated enough, Amen. to
[1:22:44] understand the secrets of this message."
[1:22:46] Brother man said, "Here's the secret.
[1:22:48] The word is in the bride.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to worship an
[1:22:53] idol. You don't have to have a god or a
[1:22:55] message that can't speak. The word is in
[1:22:58] the bride.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; It's speaking. Every time
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; you get around the bride,
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; it's speaking because you're a member of
[1:23:05] the bride. Christ is in you, friends.
[1:23:08] Amen. That's the masterpiece. That's
[1:23:10] what you got to do with the word. It's
[1:23:12] not just get all It's not just believe
[1:23:13] the scripture. Amen. It's not just
[1:23:15] believe the quotes. Amen. but to see it
[1:23:18] put together in the form that the master
[1:23:21] intended. And I believe in a masterpiece
[1:23:24] message. I believe that God had
[1:23:26] something in mind. Amen. When he sent
[1:23:28] his word down to fallen man. Amen. He
[1:23:31] was building towards something. He was
[1:23:33] he was creating something, molding
[1:23:35] something, putting something together.
[1:23:38] And you're the jewel. You're that blood
[1:23:40] red ruby. Amen. That he died for. Amen.
[1:23:43] To pluck you out of this world and put
[1:23:45] you into that form. You're part of his
[1:23:47] body. You're part of the image. You're
[1:23:50] part of the masterpiece. Amen. How many
[1:23:52] How many know the bride is God's
[1:23:54] masterpiece? Brother Bam said, "You're
[1:23:56] his victory. Oh, you're his
[1:23:58] achievement." Amen. You are what he has
[1:24:00] envisioned.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; You're the reason he sent every prophet.
[1:24:05] You're a You're the reason he raised up
[1:24:06] apostles. You're the reason he raised up
[1:24:08] a five-fold ministry.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are his masterpiece.
[1:24:13] Brother Nathan, I couldn't be his idol.
[1:24:15] I I can't I I look I I believe there's
[1:24:18] somebody out there. Somebody somebody
[1:24:19] must be that masterpiece bride. But it
[1:24:22] can't be me, brother Nathan, because I
[1:24:23] have so many flaws and I'm struggling
[1:24:26] with things and I I I'm in a battle and
[1:24:29] I'm dealing with this and dealing with
[1:24:30] that. Amen. But how many know it's the
[1:24:33] flaw that makes the masterpiece? That's
[1:24:35] why we go through things in this life.
[1:24:37] That's why we're tested and tried and
[1:24:39] tempted on every hand. Amen. Why? Cuz
[1:24:42] God has a form. God has an image he's
[1:24:44] trying to achieve. So, he's got to mold
[1:24:46] you. He's got to chip away at you. Amen.
[1:24:49] And sometimes he strikes out with that
[1:24:51] chisel. Amen. He begins to peck away at
[1:24:53] your at your life. But look, he's not
[1:24:55] removing the real you. He's just
[1:24:57] removing everything in between. It's
[1:24:59] just getting that dead rock off of you.
[1:25:01] Getting that dead idolatry off of you.
[1:25:04] Amen. To bring you into the image that
[1:25:06] he had in his mind before the foundation
[1:25:08] of the world.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he smites you for a different
[1:25:11] reason. Amen. That that's the way it is.
[1:25:13] Sometimes we go through things, say,
[1:25:15] "God, why have you why are you striking
[1:25:17] me? Why am I being punished? What have I
[1:25:20] done wrong?" Amen. But that's not always
[1:25:22] why he's striking it, Brother Colby.
[1:25:24] Amen. But sometimes things will go
[1:25:26] wrong. Faith will get into it. Trial.
[1:25:28] Amen. But it's not God's punishment.
[1:25:30] Amen. But he took the he Amen. It's
[1:25:32] because he's brought us to a place where
[1:25:34] he wants to take the hammer and strike
[1:25:36] his masterpiece and say, "Now speak.
[1:25:39] Speak. You're so close to what I had in
[1:25:42] mind. You're so close to what I'm trying
[1:25:44] to achieve. Speak something.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Speak to your trial. Amen. I I know you
[1:25:50] suffered a blow, but now speak.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, church?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Christ is in you, bride,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; making you an idol that speaks. The
[1:26:00] Bible says, "I am the Lord. That is my
[1:26:02] name.
[1:26:03] And my glory will I not give to
[1:26:05] another." Amen. neither my praise to
[1:26:09] graven images. Amen. And yet a message
[1:26:11] is telling you, amen, that God wants to
[1:26:14] pour his glory into you and make you the
[1:26:16] very tabernacle of his glory. You're the
[1:26:19] image through which his glory is
[1:26:20] expressed. Well, how could this be?
[1:26:22] Amen. When the Bible says he doesn't
[1:26:24] share his glory with anybody, he won't
[1:26:26] share with a graven image. Well, it's
[1:26:28] not that kind of idol. Amen. Look,
[1:26:30] friends, Amen. If your name is Mrs.
[1:26:32] Methodist, Amen. You're not going to see
[1:26:35] his glory. If your name is Mrs.
[1:26:37] Pentecostal, you're not going to see his
[1:26:39] glory. If your name is Mrs. Message
[1:26:41] Believer, you're still not going to see
[1:26:43] his glory. But there's a Mrs. Jesus
[1:26:45] Christ which has been caught out of the
[1:26:48] dust of the earth in this day. And God
[1:26:50] has formed himself a bride. Amen. It's
[1:26:52] not robbery. Amen. For her to lay claim
[1:26:55] to his glory. It's not robbery to carry
[1:26:57] out his ministry.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; It's not evil. It's not robbery to speak
[1:27:02] through the voice of the son of man as a
[1:27:04] member of this bride.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you're bone of his bone,
[1:27:08] flesh of his flesh, likeness of his
[1:27:10] likeness, image of his image, heart of
[1:27:12] his heart, spirit of his spirit, and
[1:27:14] life of his life.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; You're him.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; That's why we have a hope of glory
[1:27:19] today. Look, my hope of glory is not in
[1:27:22] this tabernacle of humiliation. Amen.
[1:27:25] It's not in this. Not in this
[1:27:26] corruptible body, but my hope of glory
[1:27:28] is in a quickening power. Amen. But the
[1:27:31] quickening power is for this mortal
[1:27:33] body. The quickening power is not for
[1:27:35] the millennium. It's not to make me a
[1:27:37] king and a priest there, but it's to
[1:27:38] come into this fallen flesh. Amen. This
[1:27:41] fallen tabernacle of humiliation and
[1:27:44] make it the house of the glory of God.
[1:27:47] Amen. God, look, friends, if you got a
[1:27:49] lot of flaws, God knows how to rub out
[1:27:51] your flaws. God knows how to shape you.
[1:27:53] God knows how to make you what he wanted
[1:27:55] you to be.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; God doesn't need your perfection. He
[1:28:01] just needs your submission.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? Amen. You're Mrs. Jesus. The
[1:28:07] bride and her husband are one. That's
[1:28:09] the kind of idol you are. See, you're
[1:28:11] not a dead idol. You're not a You're not
[1:28:13] an idol like the pagan has cuz you're
[1:28:15] not an object of worship. Amen. You're
[1:28:18] just a place of worship.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're just a place. Amen. You're
[1:28:22] just a vessel. Amen. You're you're
[1:28:24] you're not God, but you're the vessel
[1:28:25] that he shows up in. Amen. You're you're
[1:28:28] not you're not anything glorious. Amen.
[1:28:30] But you're the place where the glory
[1:28:31] comes down. Amen. You're the you're the
[1:28:34] you're the source of the river of life.
[1:28:36] Amen. You're you're a capstone bride.
[1:28:39] You're seated at the throne. Out of your
[1:28:41] belly flows a river of living water.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; You were created and raised up and
[1:28:45] formed to show forth the glory of God.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; You're not an object of worship. You're
[1:28:50] just a place of of worship. So that's
[1:28:53] what it is, brother Elijah. Amen.
[1:28:55] Because you were an elected seed of God.
[1:28:57] Amen. That capstone came and hovered
[1:28:59] down over your life. Amen. And that
[1:29:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost came down and
[1:29:03] it sealed you into the kingdom of God as
[1:29:05] a son. And it made you a partaker of the
[1:29:07] divine nature. And when that Holy Ghost
[1:29:09] came in, Amen. It cleared, Amen, the
[1:29:12] space of your life, amen, into amen, it
[1:29:15] cleared out all your sin. It cleared out
[1:29:17] all your shame. It cleared out all
[1:29:19] condemnation and made you a partaker of
[1:29:21] the divine nature. But let me tell you
[1:29:23] something. God doesn't want an empty
[1:29:25] lot. Amen. That's not why he redeemed
[1:29:27] you. It wasn't just to clear away all
[1:29:29] your old nature. It wasn't just to clear
[1:29:31] away all your sin. But God's got a
[1:29:33] building project. Amen. So that capstone
[1:29:36] will never leave your life. It'll be
[1:29:38] your guide. It'll be your inside
[1:29:39] teacher. Amen. And it'll hover over your
[1:29:42] life. Amen. But then line upon line,
[1:29:46] precept upon precept, revelation by
[1:29:48] revelation, amen, the Holy Ghost,
[1:29:50] Brother Bram said, radiates down out of
[1:29:52] that capstone. Amen. Onto that onto that
[1:29:55] foundation of faith. And it'll add to
[1:29:57] your faith virtue. And it adds to your
[1:30:00] virtue knowledge. And it'll add to
[1:30:02] knowledge, temperance. Add add to
[1:30:04] temperance, patience, and godliness. And
[1:30:06] Amen. And brotherly kindness. Amen. And
[1:30:08] so God has a building project. Now, the
[1:30:11] beautiful thing is it's his project.
[1:30:13] Amen. God didn't give you the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost. Amen. And then say, "Well, if you
[1:30:17] make it through my sevenstep plan, then
[1:30:20] you can be sealed into the kingdom of
[1:30:21] God." No, he sealed. Amen. The He sealed
[1:30:24] all the potential into you as a seed of
[1:30:27] God when he quickened you by the baptism
[1:30:29] of the Holy Ghost. And it's not you that
[1:30:31] adds virtue to faith. The Holy Ghost
[1:30:34] adds virtue to faith. The Holy Ghost
[1:30:36] adds knowledge. The Holy Ghost adds all
[1:30:38] these things.
[1:30:40] [Applause]
[1:30:42] It's God's project. God doesn't need you
[1:30:44] to figure it out. God doesn't need you
[1:30:46] to be a great builder. He doesn't need
[1:30:48] you to provide the material. He doesn't
[1:30:50] need you to provide the plan. He's got
[1:30:52] the plan. He's got the power.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; He just needs your submission.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And so that capstone begins. See, you
[1:31:01] think, well, it's a capstone bringing me
[1:31:03] up to him. No, no, no. It's a capstone
[1:31:06] getting you ready so that he can come
[1:31:08] down into you. Because brother Brandham
[1:31:10] said, "What do you have when you have
[1:31:11] the stature of a perfect man? What have
[1:31:13] you produced? A living tabernacle of a
[1:31:16] living God." That's the kind of
[1:31:18] Christianity I want. I want enough
[1:31:20] Christ in me, Amen, that my neighbor
[1:31:22] knows I'm a Christian. That my coworker
[1:31:24] knows I'm a Christian. Amen. That
[1:31:26] there's something radiating out of me,
[1:31:28] amen, that I'm not just trying to climb
[1:31:30] my way up to where God is, but I'm the
[1:31:32] kind of Christian where God can come
[1:31:33] down and inhabit this vessel and speak
[1:31:36] through this dumb idol. Amen. and give
[1:31:38] me a voice. Give me a message. Give me a
[1:31:41] ministry.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Give me a testimony.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; He's bringing himself down to you into
[1:31:47] the living tabernacle of the living God.
[1:31:49] That's what's that's why we're walking
[1:31:52] with the message of the hour. That's why
[1:31:54] we're preaching it with everything that
[1:31:56] we know cuz we recognize what God is
[1:31:58] doing today. Amen. Is God doesn't have
[1:32:01] us sitting on our hands talking about
[1:32:03] miracles that happened in prayer lines
[1:32:04] 60 years ago. Amen. But God is building
[1:32:07] a house. God, there's a building project
[1:32:10] going on. Brother man says God never
[1:32:12] stops. He's always going upward. He's
[1:32:14] always building it up. He's always
[1:32:16] advancing. He's always progressing. And
[1:32:18] what is he building? He's building the
[1:32:20] bride of Christ.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I thank God for a five-fold
[1:32:24] ministry that'll preach the message and
[1:32:26] keep their ideas out of it, keep their
[1:32:28] opinion out of it. Amen. Because we're
[1:32:30] not here to build our own house. We're
[1:32:32] here to build God's house. Amen. And if
[1:32:34] you'll if you'll stay true to the
[1:32:36] message, the message will stay true to
[1:32:38] you. Who art thou mountain before
[1:32:40] Zerubbable? Amen. There's a ministry on
[1:32:42] the earth today. Amen. That has got a
[1:32:45] commission. Amen. To build, Amen, the
[1:32:47] bride that was promised by the message
[1:32:50] of the hour. Amen. That's why I don't
[1:32:52] believe we get in a pulpit and try to
[1:32:54] beat everybody down. Amen. And just try
[1:32:56] to take the word of God and whip people
[1:32:58] with it, kill people with it. Amen.
[1:33:00] Condemn them with it. I'm trying to
[1:33:02] build the bride. That's the end time
[1:33:04] evangelism. Build her up. Amen. Lift her
[1:33:07] up. If she's in a mess, Amen. lift her
[1:33:10] up. If she's in darkness, bring her
[1:33:12] light. Bring her hope. Bring her faith.
[1:33:15] Cuz God's trying to build something.
[1:33:18] We're not a demolition crew. Look, I got
[1:33:20] a hammer in one hand. And that hammer is
[1:33:22] for building. That hammer is for heing
[1:33:25] stones. To build God a temple. Amen. To
[1:33:27] restore the tabernacle. And in the other
[1:33:30] hand, I got a sword. And the sword is
[1:33:32] not for my brother. The sword is not for
[1:33:34] the sheep. The sword is for the
[1:33:36] predator. The sword is for the enemy.
[1:33:38] Amen. I believe we got enough of a
[1:33:40] message. We can fight the devil and
[1:33:42] build our brother at the same time.
[1:33:44] Amen. Pick up your sword. Pick up your
[1:33:46] hammer. Let's build God a house.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; There's a message to preach. There's a
[1:33:54] ministry to preach it.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what this five-fold
[1:33:57] ministry is. Ephesians 4 said it's for
[1:34:00] the perfecting of the saints,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the
[1:34:04] edifying of the body of Christ until
[1:34:08] what? Until we all come in the unity of
[1:34:10] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:34:12] son of God unto a perfect man.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; A perfect man. Amen. Are you the perfect
[1:34:19] man? Am I the perfect man? Is the
[1:34:22] preacher the perfect man? No. No. Christ
[1:34:24] is the perfect man. Amen. But God sent
[1:34:26] you a ministry. Amen. to take to take a
[1:34:29] message over the pulpit and try to tell
[1:34:30] you, Amen. You're not somebody foreign
[1:34:33] to Christ. Amen. As the bride of Christ,
[1:34:35] you're identified in Christ. You're as
[1:34:37] holy as he's holy. You're as righteous
[1:34:39] as he's righteous. You're as powerful as
[1:34:41] he's powerful. Rich as he is rich.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Perfect as he is perfect
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; because you're identified in that
[1:34:49] capstone
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; unto a the measure of the stature of the
[1:34:53] fullness of Christ. But let me tell you
[1:34:55] this. I don't believe the message was
[1:34:58] sent just to raise up a bunch of
[1:34:59] superhuman preachers that we could all
[1:35:01] sit in a pew and admire. Amen. No,
[1:35:03] there's a furtherance than that. He did
[1:35:05] raise up a five-fold ministry to raise
[1:35:07] us up into the stature of the fullness
[1:35:08] of Christ. Amen. And then further down
[1:35:11] in the chapter, he says, "Then we'll
[1:35:13] grow up into him in all things." Amen.
[1:35:17] God don't want you to sit and cross your
[1:35:18] arms and listen to a preacher. He wants
[1:35:20] you to grow. Amen. He wants to build you
[1:35:23] up. He wants you to be a house. He wants
[1:35:25] you to have a voice that you would grow
[1:35:28] up in him in all things which is the
[1:35:30] head even Christ. And then watch now
[1:35:32] when you grow up into Christ then the
[1:35:34] Bible says the whole body is joined
[1:35:36] together and every joint supply. Amen.
[1:35:40] Yeah. Look friends, there's nobody in
[1:35:41] this bride that's not a jewel in the
[1:35:44] body of Christ. Amen. If you're a member
[1:35:46] of this bride, I don't care if you stand
[1:35:47] in a pulpit or sweep a rug. Amen. Or
[1:35:50] clean a toilet or shake a hand or hold a
[1:35:52] door. Amen. You're a jewel in God's
[1:35:55] economy. Amen. You are priceless in his
[1:35:57] eyes. And you're part of the revelation
[1:35:59] of Christ in this day. It's not just for
[1:36:01] preachers. It's not just for prophets.
[1:36:03] Amen. God, amen, wants idols in the pew
[1:36:06] that can speak the message. He wants you
[1:36:09] in your workplace speaking the word. He
[1:36:11] wants you in school speaking the word.
[1:36:13] He wants you out in the street speaking
[1:36:15] the word.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; The message is not just for pulpit.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; The message is for the world. It's for
[1:36:21] every nation and tongue. It's a light in
[1:36:23] a dark place. Amen. He wants to make you
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; a lighthouse,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; a tabernacle,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; a church.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; That's why I love this message.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; I love this message. Amen. Because it
[1:36:37] brings a revelation that no other
[1:36:39] church, no other organization, no other
[1:36:41] teaching can bring. Amen. I know what
[1:36:43] deity looks like in Jonathan Martin, and
[1:36:45] I love to see it. I've seen deity work
[1:36:48] through Ronnie Long. I've seen deity
[1:36:50] work through through Matthew McGary.
[1:36:52] Amen. But I want to know what deity
[1:36:54] looks like in Micaiah. I want to find
[1:36:56] out what does deity look like. Amen.
[1:36:58] When it speaks through Judah. Amen. What
[1:37:01] what does deity look like in in a shame?
[1:37:03] What does it look like in a puit? What
[1:37:04] does it look like in appear? Amen. What
[1:37:06] does it look like? Amen. Well, it does
[1:37:09] not yet appear what we shall be. But I
[1:37:12] tell you what, under the light of this
[1:37:13] message, it's becoming more clear all
[1:37:15] the time.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's a privilege to
[1:37:20] stand in a pulpit and look out at the
[1:37:22] image of what God was thinking about
[1:37:24] before the foundation of the world. Say,
[1:37:26] "What do I do with this message?" Speak
[1:37:28] it, live it, show it forth.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Become its tabernacle.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Don't make it an idol.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; It's a living reality.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; What does deity look like in you? Amen.
[1:37:43] I believe in deity speaking,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; not just through a prophet,
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; through a bride. I want to hear deity
[1:37:50] speak in an Oklahoma accent.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. What does deity from Panee sound
[1:37:54] like?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; What does deity from Ohio? What does
[1:37:57] deity from Kansas? What does it sound
[1:37:59] like, brother Sam? What does it look
[1:38:00] like? What a message. Amen. It's a
[1:38:03] chance to find out. Hallelujah. I want
[1:38:06] to find out what deity looks like in
[1:38:07] Nathan Ericson. What does it sound like?
[1:38:10] How does it preach? How does it live?
[1:38:12] What's it here to do? I don't want to be
[1:38:14] a dead believer. Amen. I don't want to
[1:38:16] be a dumb idol. I want to speak.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I want to express
[1:38:22] all the potential
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; that he had in his mind when he planted
[1:38:26] that seed
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:38:30] Look friends, I know the stature of the
[1:38:32] perfect man pertains to the church. It
[1:38:35] pertains to the seven church ages. But
[1:38:37] brother man makes it very clear that
[1:38:39] it's not just to the church or the
[1:38:41] church age, but it's to the individual.
[1:38:44] It's not just the church as a body
[1:38:46] that's a tabernacle of his presence.
[1:38:48] It's the individual that's a tabernacle
[1:38:50] of his glory. Hallelujah. Brother Brand
[1:38:52] said, "Look, God never sent me to build
[1:38:54] an organization." I'll say it again,
[1:38:56] friends. God didn't send a message so we
[1:38:58] could talk about it. So we could build
[1:39:00] our little groups, so we could rise
[1:39:02] raise up little isms. So we could
[1:39:04] organize it. So we could run with
[1:39:06] traditions. Amen. He didn't send it for
[1:39:08] that.
[1:39:09] God sent me to build individuals to the
[1:39:13] stature of Jesus Christ that they might
[1:39:16] be a powerhouse
[1:39:18] and the dwelling place of his spirit.
[1:39:22] How many believe quickening power was in
[1:39:23] the apostles? How many believe
[1:39:25] quickening power was in William
[1:39:26] Brandham? How many believe quickening
[1:39:29] power is in the hands of the five-fold
[1:39:30] ministry to lay hands upon the sick?
[1:39:32] Amen. But do you believe and can you see
[1:39:35] and can you hear the message that
[1:39:37] quickening power is in your body? Amen.
[1:39:41] By the message of the hour, God has
[1:39:44] given you a voice. God has given you
[1:39:46] power.
[1:39:50] Make you a powerhouse.
[1:39:52] Store something in you.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; A dwelling place of the spirit by his
[1:39:57] word. Amen. And I know deity was in
[1:39:59] Jesus, but God didn't want to keep all
[1:40:01] the deity in Jesus. So he said, "All
[1:40:03] that was in Christ, he poured into
[1:40:05] William Brandham."
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; No, that ain't the scripture. All that
[1:40:09] was in Christ, he poured into seven
[1:40:10] messengers and 12 apostles.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe Stephen, maybe he maybe him,
[1:40:15] too. All that was in Christ, he poured
[1:40:18] into the church. Amen. He had this Holy
[1:40:21] Spirit without measure, but thank God
[1:40:23] I've got a measure tonight. There's a
[1:40:25] lick of that fire that belongs to me.
[1:40:28] And I, as an individual, Amen. I'm not
[1:40:30] going to hide it under a bushel. I'm
[1:40:32] going to let it shine. Amen. I'm going
[1:40:35] to speak this word.
[1:40:37] I'm going to be part of the utterance.
[1:40:44] Hallelujah. Friends, you know, this is a
[1:40:46] real nice church. Amen. A beautiful
[1:40:49] building. I thank God for blessing you
[1:40:50] with it. But I hate to tell you this.
[1:40:52] This isn't a Holy Ghost tabernacle.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said there's no such
[1:40:57] thing as a Holy Ghost tabernacle. He
[1:41:00] said, "But it's individuals that come
[1:41:02] into this church. They are Holy Ghost
[1:41:05] tabernacles. They are tabernacles that
[1:41:07] contain the Holy Ghost, not the church
[1:41:09] in a body or a group."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But a Holy Ghost tabernacle is an
[1:41:16] individual who has received the Holy
[1:41:18] Spirit into their life, been a partaker
[1:41:21] of the divine nature, and they're
[1:41:22] walking in the light of the word for
[1:41:23] their day
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; and expressing the image that was in
[1:41:27] God's mind for the individual. This is a
[1:41:30] great meeting, brother friend, brother,
[1:41:31] sister. Amen. I'm so I'm so honored and
[1:41:34] I'm so grateful to be a partaker of this
[1:41:36] meeting, to speak of this meeting. But I
[1:41:38] want to say this, this isn't a Holy
[1:41:39] Ghost meeting. Amen. And see, because a
[1:41:42] Holy Ghost meeting isn't something we do
[1:41:43] as a group, but a Holy Ghost meeting is
[1:41:45] when an individual comes to the meeting,
[1:41:48] comes to the conference, and you sit in
[1:41:50] your pew as the message goes forth.
[1:41:52] Amen. And you hear a voice. Amen. Cuz
[1:41:54] you're not serving a dead God with ears
[1:41:56] that can't hear. Amen. Amen. You got a
[1:41:59] God that can hear you. That's why you
[1:42:01] can hear him. Hallelujah. Amen. It's a
[1:42:03] God that can speak
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; and you can speak, too.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I didn't come to this meeting to
[1:42:09] find God. I brought God. Amen. And
[1:42:12] everybody that's a Holy Ghostborn. Amen.
[1:42:14] Son or daughter of God. Amen. Wherever
[1:42:16] they go, they take God with them. Amen.
[1:42:18] You didn't come to this meeting to find
[1:42:20] Jesus. Amen. You brought that lick of
[1:42:22] fire with you. Amen. It's your
[1:42:23] individual experience, your individual
[1:42:26] anointing, your individual quickening.
[1:42:28] Oh, but what happens when we bring it
[1:42:30] all together? Brother Ram said, "Your
[1:42:32] lick of fire plus my lick of fire plus
[1:42:35] her lick of fire plus his lick of fire,
[1:42:37] it brings the pillar of fire." Amen.
[1:42:39] Together back in the building. I'm
[1:42:42] trying to tell you tonight, if you're
[1:42:44] looking for the place to meet God, this
[1:42:46] is the place. This is where it happens.
[1:42:50] Amen. When spiritborn sons and daughters
[1:42:53] of God bring their anointing together,
[1:42:56] it reproduces the life of Christ on the
[1:42:58] scene. If you need healing, this is
[1:43:01] where healing happens. If you need
[1:43:03] deliverance, this is where deliverance
[1:43:04] happens. If you got questions, this is
[1:43:07] where they get answered.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; It's here, friends. It's here. We're not
[1:43:13] here just to put our put our heads
[1:43:15] together. Let's put God together. This
[1:43:17] is where it happens. Jesus said, "Oh,
[1:43:19] they'll say low here, low there. Move to
[1:43:22] Jeffersonville. Go move to that church.
[1:43:25] Go hear that preacher." Amen. Brother
[1:43:27] Nathan, he's all right. But if so and so
[1:43:29] had come to the meeting, Amen. then we
[1:43:31] really could receive something from the
[1:43:32] Lord. Look friends, the only reason I'd
[1:43:34] preach this, Amen, because there's
[1:43:35] really no jealousy in my heart to say
[1:43:37] it. But it's just that it's the truth.
[1:43:39] Amen. It it doesn't matter so much who's
[1:43:41] in the pulpit. If as long as it's a
[1:43:43] gift, amen, that God's put in the body.
[1:43:45] It don't matter what church we gather.
[1:43:47] It don't matter how big the crowd is. It
[1:43:50] don't matter whether the specials were
[1:43:51] in tune or not. It doesn't matter. What
[1:43:54] matters is that we brought God with us.
[1:43:58] Amen. And when we come together, Amen.
[1:44:00] We don't come to worship a dead idol,
[1:44:03] but we worship the same pillar of fire
[1:44:06] that inhabited the tabernacle in the
[1:44:07] wilderness. The same pillar of fire that
[1:44:10] inhabited Jesus Christ, inhabits these
[1:44:13] individuals, inhabits this church,
[1:44:16] inhabits this meeting. He's in the room.
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:26] Jesus said, "Don't say low here, oh low
[1:44:28] there." He said, "The kingdom of God is
[1:44:30] within you."
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, it's here.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; It's right here. Where's my answer,
[1:44:35] Brother Nathan? Right here.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where where's my Where's the power
[1:44:38] that I need? It's right here.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; For this commandment which I commande,
[1:44:45] it's not hidden from thee, neither is it
[1:44:46] far off. It's not in heaven
[1:44:50] that thou should have say, "Who's going
[1:44:51] to go up in heaven and bring it down?"
[1:44:53] It's not beyond the sea. But the word is
[1:44:56] nigh thee. It's in thy mouth and in thy
[1:45:00] heart. Amen. Look, friends, I'm not
[1:45:03] waiting for a prophet, amen, to come
[1:45:04] flying across the sea to bring me my
[1:45:07] revival and to bring me my power and to
[1:45:09] put me in my position. The word is
[1:45:11] already in me. It's in my heart and it's
[1:45:14] in my mouth. Amen. I'm not waiting for
[1:45:17] the Amen. for the blessings to fall out
[1:45:19] of heaven. Amen. It's already in me.
[1:45:22] It's in my heart and it's in my mouth.
[1:45:25] Amen.
[1:45:26] I'm preaching the message tonight and
[1:45:28] the angel of the Lord accompanies the
[1:45:30] message always.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Always.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you've got to find the place.
[1:45:36] That's the very that's the key to it
[1:45:38] all. You want to know a living God, you
[1:45:41] want to you want to experience a living
[1:45:42] reality, you just got to find the right
[1:45:44] place. Cuz God won't meet you just
[1:45:46] anywhere. He won't meet you in your
[1:45:48] opinion. He won't meet you in your
[1:45:49] tradition. Brother Brham said he'll meet
[1:45:51] you in one provided place. Over and
[1:45:54] over, Brother Brham preached God's
[1:45:56] provided way. But one last time, right
[1:45:58] before he passed off the scene, he
[1:46:00] preached the message, God's only
[1:46:02] provided place of worship. And you know
[1:46:06] where you know where that place is? It's
[1:46:08] where his name is.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Look friends, the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:13] is not a talisman. It's not an
[1:46:15] abracadabra that we wave in the room.
[1:46:17] Amen. The name of Jesus Christ, it's a
[1:46:19] nature. It's a life. It's a token. Amen.
[1:46:22] It's a reality. It's a spirit. Amen.
[1:46:25] Where is it today? It's not in heaven.
[1:46:29] It's not across the sea. It's in the
[1:46:32] bride of Christ.
[1:46:39] Moses didn't he didn't just carry the
[1:46:40] word as a dead letter. Amen. But Moses
[1:46:43] fulfilled his ministry cuz he made God a
[1:46:45] place. Moses made a place and our
[1:46:48] prophet made a place. Hallelujah. Moses
[1:46:51] made a place for God in a tabernacle.
[1:46:54] And God made a place in Christ. But
[1:46:57] Christ made a place in the church, in
[1:47:00] the heart of the individual. Jesus made
[1:47:03] a place in the bride.
[1:47:06] Oh friends, you got to come to that
[1:47:08] place.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; You can't just join a church.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; You can't just call yourself a message
[1:47:13] believer. You can't just put a picture
[1:47:14] on the wall and a sign out by the road
[1:47:17] and think that you bear the name of
[1:47:18] Christ. Amen. There's only one name
[1:47:20] given under heaven by the whereby men
[1:47:22] may be saved. It's not the name of
[1:47:24] William Brandham. It's not the name of
[1:47:26] Wayne Lawson or Wenda Martin. Amen. It's
[1:47:28] not it's not any man's name. It's the
[1:47:30] name of Jesus Christ. And how do you get
[1:47:33] into Christ? By one spirit. Amen. Only
[1:47:36] the five-fold ministry is born. By one
[1:47:38] spirit, the prophet by one spirit we are
[1:47:41] all born baptized into the body of
[1:47:44] Christ.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Bam said, look in
[1:47:48] that heavenly city, that new Jerusalem.
[1:47:51] Amen. He said, look, he said, every
[1:47:53] religion in the world has got temples.
[1:47:56] Everybody. Amen. The the the Hindus got
[1:47:58] temples. Buddhists got temples.
[1:48:00] Christians got churches. Uh Muslims got
[1:48:03] mosques. Everybody's got a temple. But
[1:48:05] did you notice he said in that city
[1:48:07] there won't be any temple? There's no
[1:48:09] church there. There's no cathedral
[1:48:11] there. There's no sanctuary there. Amen.
[1:48:14] Because the Bible says the Lord God and
[1:48:16] the Lamb is the temple of that city.
[1:48:18] Brother Brand said, "The Lamb is the
[1:48:19] light." The Lamb is the temple. The Lamb
[1:48:22] is the throne. The Lamb is the light.
[1:48:25] Amen. The life. He is that temple. Amen.
[1:48:28] And all of these other temples have an
[1:48:29] object that they're worshiping. But in
[1:48:32] our city, he is the object.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is with his people.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; The most high God. He doesn't dwell in
[1:48:42] tabernacles made with hands. Amen. And
[1:48:44] friends. Amen. The message is not a
[1:48:46] slightly better church with slightly
[1:48:48] better doctrine and slightly prettier
[1:48:50] churches and a slightly bitter
[1:48:52] congregation and a and a and a slightly
[1:48:54] nicer community. Amen. That God doesn't
[1:48:56] dwell in that kind of a tabernacle. But
[1:48:59] if you could see the message. Amen. I
[1:49:01] know we've heard it before. I know we've
[1:49:03] heard it preached. But if you could just
[1:49:04] hear it tonight like it was for the
[1:49:06] first time, Amen. that for 2,000 years
[1:49:09] men worshiped a dead idolatrous
[1:49:12] Christianity. Amen. But in the evening
[1:49:14] time, the light came. Amen. He was
[1:49:16] kicked out of the church. He was kicked
[1:49:18] out of denomination. But he came
[1:49:20] knocking on your door.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you'll just let him
[1:49:24] in, if you'll let the message introduce
[1:49:26] you to this Christ, Amen. you'll find
[1:49:29] out that you Amen. have come into
[1:49:31] fellowship with the most high God.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; And if we could see the message that
[1:49:35] way, amen, that he's the most high God.
[1:49:39] He's deserving of preeminence.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you, he's higher than
[1:49:45] who's got the best church. He's higher
[1:49:47] than who's got the most anointed
[1:49:49] ministry. He's higher than who's the
[1:49:51] best singer. He's higher than who's the
[1:49:54] greatest teacher. He's higher than the
[1:49:56] argument. He's higher than worldly
[1:49:58] pleasures. He's higher than your idol.
[1:50:00] He's higher than your opinion.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the most high God
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; dwelling in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:10] You can't lift him high enough. Amen.
[1:50:12] You can't make him great enough. Amen.
[1:50:14] All we can do is give him the
[1:50:15] preeminence. Amen. Say, "God, forget my
[1:50:18] opinion. God, forget my preference.
[1:50:21] Forget my will. Thy will be done.
[1:50:23] Because I want to be a tabernacle of the
[1:50:27] most high God.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a man-made dwelling
[1:50:31] place. I want to be the temple
[1:50:35] of his glory. I want to be a tabernacle.
[1:50:39] I want the kind of experience with God.
[1:50:41] Amen. Where I can be the bride of Jesus
[1:50:42] Christ, the only true church of this
[1:50:45] age. You realize friends that if a man
[1:50:47] or a woman that if a human being wants
[1:50:49] to find God and find where he's
[1:50:51] manifesting himself, there's only one
[1:50:53] provided place and that is the bride of
[1:50:55] Jesus Christ. You are the place man
[1:50:58] comes to worship. You are the ma the
[1:51:00] place man comes to mean God. Amen.
[1:51:02] Brother Br said, "You're the only Bible
[1:51:04] most people will ever read. You're the
[1:51:06] only church service they'll ever attend.
[1:51:08] You're the only preacher they'll ever
[1:51:09] hear.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, then lift him high.
[1:51:16] Give him the preeminence.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; You got to worship at the right altar.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; You're trying to worship a God that's a
[1:51:24] million miles away in space.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody asked Brother Brandon said,
[1:51:29] "How could Jesus how could you Jesus be
[1:51:31] speaking on earth and then and you know
[1:51:34] and be and also be in heaven and and who
[1:51:37] was he praying to if he was a if he
[1:51:38] wasn't a separate person of the Godhead?
[1:51:40] And who? What? Oh, brother Bram said, he
[1:51:42] said, "Now, brother, do you have the
[1:51:44] Holy Ghost?
[1:51:45] Do you talk to him?
[1:51:48] Do you worship him? Do you fellowship
[1:51:50] with him?" He said, "That's all I need
[1:51:52] to hear." Amen. Who did Jesus pray to?
[1:51:54] He prayed to the God that was within
[1:51:56] him. And when you see this message,
[1:51:58] right, you won't pray to a God of 2,000
[1:52:00] years ago. You won't call on a God
[1:52:02] that's up in outer space somewhere. You
[1:52:04] won't call to a God of history. Amen.
[1:52:06] But you'll find out that the most high
[1:52:08] God is very, very near to where you are.
[1:52:12] You don't have to shout to wake him up.
[1:52:13] Brother Ram said, you just call on the
[1:52:15] master. Amen. In the middle of your
[1:52:17] storm, you wake him up cuz he's not on
[1:52:19] the other side of the sea. He's in your
[1:52:22] boat.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You can wake up Jesus tonight. Well, if
[1:52:27] I have that access to if I have access
[1:52:30] like that to the presence of God, I want
[1:52:32] to wake him up tonight. Amen. I I I want
[1:52:34] to get in touch with God. I don't want
[1:52:36] to just have another meeting. I want
[1:52:38] this to be the most life-changing,
[1:52:40] spiritfilled, Amen. power flowing down
[1:52:42] from heaven. Amen. The the greatest
[1:52:44] meeting I've ever been a part of. Amen.
[1:52:47] Because I want to realize, Amen. that
[1:52:49] God's not in the group.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; God is in me.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is in my voice to speak to my
[1:52:56] mountain and ask whatever I will.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Worship at the right altar, friends.
[1:53:03] Brother Bram said, "Look, the message
[1:53:04] that's the message, you don't have to
[1:53:06] stay 63 and after. Go all the way back
[1:53:08] to 1949, deity of Jesus Christ." Brother
[1:53:10] Bram tell you that the devil is trying
[1:53:13] to make you some kind of a coward down.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some trying to hide you back. Tell
[1:53:18] you that you're some little something.
[1:53:20] But he said, "But you're sons and
[1:53:21] daughters of God." And he said, "Deity,
[1:53:24] deity is not in heaven." Amen. He said,
[1:53:27] "Deity is in you." Amen. Jesus said, "My
[1:53:30] life give I you Zoe life." Not a
[1:53:33] slightly better life. Not a life of a
[1:53:35] church member. Not the life of a creed
[1:53:37] follower, but my life, my token, my
[1:53:41] literal Zoey life, my attributes, my
[1:53:45] presence, my power, my voice is in you.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; That's the true altar.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Deity is not in heaven. Deity is in the
[1:53:55] bride of Jesus Christ. that. And so
[1:53:57] there's where the true altar is. Amen.
[1:53:59] If you're trying to take this message
[1:54:01] and look at it in a way that puts God
[1:54:04] way over there or just puts him in a
[1:54:06] preacher or just puts him in a prophet,
[1:54:08] you haven't seen the message yet. Amen.
[1:54:11] But if you can see it right, friends,
[1:54:13] you'll recognize you don't have to
[1:54:15] travel to where the altar is. But you
[1:54:17] are the altar of his presence. And the
[1:54:20] Holy Ghost has come as a consuming fire.
[1:54:22] Amen. to burn up the sacrifice of your
[1:54:24] life and make you the shakina glory.
[1:54:28] Make you the ark of his presence. Make
[1:54:30] you the tabernacle.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "It's God dwelling in you
[1:54:35] with your temperament."
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I know it sounds awful,
[1:54:39] but it's right."
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we go a little further now?
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, friends, that's the altar I
[1:54:46] worship God. Amen. The message brought
[1:54:49] me to an altar. Amen. I I I don't have
[1:54:51] to go far to find him. I don't have to
[1:54:53] look anywhere else. I worship at the
[1:54:55] altar of the bride manifestation. I know
[1:54:58] it starts to sound heretical. I know it
[1:55:00] starts to I know it starts to make the
[1:55:02] flesh just the hair just stand on its
[1:55:05] head. Amen. To begin to speak things
[1:55:07] like that. Amen. That look, Amen. God's
[1:55:10] not in a group. God's not in a church or
[1:55:12] in an organization, but he's in me. But
[1:55:14] that's where the devil always falls
[1:55:16] back. Amen. The devil can go so far, but
[1:55:19] he can't go to Pentecost. Amen. When it
[1:55:21] comes to I and my father are one,
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; I
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; people can believe the message enough
[1:55:26] for a prophet to perform miracles. They
[1:55:28] can believe a message enough, Amen, for
[1:55:30] a prophet to discern hearts. But when it
[1:55:32] comes down to the real revelation,
[1:55:35] I and my father are one. And the bride
[1:55:39] can say today, I and the bridegroom are
[1:55:42] one. Amen. I'm not another person. I'm
[1:55:45] not under another identity. I'm not
[1:55:47] under another report.
[1:55:48] [Applause]
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; I'm him. Come on.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh.
[1:55:54] I'm the tabernacle of his presence. I
[1:55:56] believe in a bride manifestation.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, brother Nathan, the bride, all
[1:56:00] she's supposed to do is sit around
[1:56:01] listen to tapes." Amen. Then why does
[1:56:03] the scripture say she has a ministry?
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says the spirit and
[1:56:07] the bride.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not just your voice, but
[1:56:11] it's the spirit joining with your voice.
[1:56:14] Amen. to say, "Oh, all you lay out of
[1:56:16] seeans. You just go on and go to hell
[1:56:18] and we'll keep listening to our tapes.
[1:56:21] Oh, you just you just we just wait for
[1:56:23] this world to burn while we sit around
[1:56:25] and have our nice church and feel better
[1:56:26] than everybody else in the world." That
[1:56:29] that that's not the spirit of Christ.
[1:56:31] Amen. But the spirit of Christ has
[1:56:32] inhabited a bride body today and has put
[1:56:35] a voice in you to cry out in a dying
[1:56:38] world and saying if there's anybody in
[1:56:40] Pawne, if there's anybody in Oklahoma,
[1:56:43] if there's anybody in Missouri, if
[1:56:44] there's anybody in Kansas or Ohio or
[1:56:47] Arkansas that's thirsty, Amen. Come to
[1:56:50] the message. Come to the altar. Come to
[1:56:53] the place where God is manifesting his
[1:56:56] reality.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that. I believe if the
[1:57:01] bride has a ministry, there's somebody
[1:57:02] out there's going to receive it. You
[1:57:04] know, Brother Brandham put a whole class
[1:57:06] of people, amen, into eternal life. A
[1:57:09] whole class of predestination based on
[1:57:11] their interaction with the bride of
[1:57:13] Jesus Christ. A cup of cold water in my
[1:57:16] name. How many still believe in that?
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; How many believe your attitude towards
[1:57:20] somebody could determine their eternal
[1:57:23] destination? Well, then what kind of
[1:57:25] people ought we to be? Amen. We're not
[1:57:27] sitting on our hands waiting for a
[1:57:29] rapture. We are here to manifest the
[1:57:32] presence of God.
[1:57:34] Jesus came to your well. Now you go find
[1:57:36] a well. Amen. And say, "Look, Amen.
[1:57:40] Look, lay out of bring me a drink. And
[1:57:42] when you bring me a drink, I'll give you
[1:57:44] a drink of the river that flows from
[1:57:47] under the throne of God where the
[1:57:49] capstone bride sits.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Out of your belly flows a river of
[1:57:54] living water." Brother Bram said,
[1:57:56] "Amen." Look, friends. Brother Bram
[1:57:58] said, "This world is dying for love,
[1:58:00] dying for life, dying for reality."
[1:58:02] Amen. Oh my. They're dying. And you're
[1:58:05] the one that's got it.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; You're the one place.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; You're the one place
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; where it dwells.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; God don't have a prophet on the earth
[1:58:15] anymore to minister.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; But the son of man never departed.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that wave sheath was only
[1:58:23] testifying of somebody, a group, a
[1:58:26] people, amen, who can manifest that
[1:58:29] original life.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Ah, Brother Bram said, "We're just on
[1:58:33] the border." You you you want to know
[1:58:36] what altar I really worship at. Amen. I
[1:58:38] I see the message in such a way. Brother
[1:58:40] Bram said, "We're right on the threshold
[1:58:42] of manifestation of sons where he said,
[1:58:45] "Born sons, true sons, filled sons will
[1:58:48] speak and their word will be backed."
[1:58:51] That's why the devil hates prayer lines.
[1:58:53] That's why the devil hates preachers.
[1:58:55] That's why he wants to sit them down and
[1:58:56] get the people listen to a mechanical
[1:58:58] device. Amen. Because God doesn't use
[1:59:00] mechanical devices. That's not what he
[1:59:02] speaks through. He speaks through men.
[1:59:04] He works through men. Amen. That's why
[1:59:06] friends. Amen. And he said, "And there
[1:59:09] will be such a power in sons of God." He
[1:59:11] said that somebody will say, "Oh, my
[1:59:12] crops are in drought. I need rain."
[1:59:15] Amen. And there will be a son of God
[1:59:16] there that could say, "In the name of
[1:59:18] Jesus Christ, I give you your reign."
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not a charismatic, amen, to
[1:59:24] sit and make empty promises here and
[1:59:27] prophesy over you and and try to give
[1:59:29] you prosperity. Amen. But as a
[1:59:31] manifested son of God, I can preach a
[1:59:33] message and say, "Hey, it's not just my
[1:59:36] voice. You got a voice tonight."
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not on the threshold
[1:59:40] anymore. We've crossed the river.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:44] We're living in the third pole now. If
[1:59:46] you need rain, speak.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; If you need healing, speak. If you need
[1:59:51] deliverance, speak. Whatever you need.
[1:59:53] If your loved one straying, amen. You

[1:59:57] situation. Speak to the mountain. Speak
[1:59:59] to the storm. The word is nye. Even in
[2:00:02] thy mouth and in thy heart.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; That's the That's the altar I worship
[2:00:06] at.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I need something from the Lord,
[2:00:11] Amen. And I don't I don't sit I don't
[2:00:12] sit at home and look up in the sky and
[2:00:15] wait for a blessing to fall out of
[2:00:16] heaven. I go down to a good message
[2:00:19] believing church where a Holy Ghost
[2:00:21] fililled pastor, amen, will preach the
[2:00:23] word of the hour to me. Amen. Because I
[2:00:26] believe in a bride ministry and I
[2:00:28] believe that's the altar. Amen. Where I
[2:00:30] can receive something from the Lord. But
[2:00:32] get the picture right. Cuz I don't
[2:00:34] worship that preacher. I don't worship
[2:00:36] the human being. But I worship a God
[2:00:38] that uses human beings. I worship a God
[2:00:40] that manifests himself
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; through sons and daughters of God.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; This message doesn't need another
[2:00:50] leader.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need another prophet.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Doesn't need an another messenger.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Doesn't need a superhuman superhero of a
[2:00:58] preacher.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; What this message needs is voices.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Voices. the sons and daughters of
[2:01:06] God to realize, hey, it ain't just the
[2:01:09] five-fold, but I'm part of this body,
[2:01:11] and there's something in my joint that's
[2:01:12] getting ready to supply. Hallelujah.
[2:01:15] Amen. And oh, amen. And that's what the
[2:01:18] message needs. Live voices in
[2:01:21] Jeffersonville. Live voices in Pawne.
[2:01:24] Live voices in Hardy. Amen. Live voices.
[2:01:27] Amen. Thundering out. That's the thunder
[2:01:30] that shakes the devil. That's the
[2:01:32] seventh thunder. That's the opening of
[2:01:33] the seals. That's the third poll. That's
[2:01:36] the opening of the word is when you open
[2:01:38] your mouth and give utterance to what
[2:01:41] God has planted in you.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; You're the word.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; You're the message.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Now, you just need to speak it. You just
[2:01:49] need to live it. Amen. Brother Brandon
[2:01:51] wasn't the voice that we heard. It's not
[2:01:53] the voice that we're feeding on. We're
[2:01:55] feeding on the body word of the son of
[2:01:57] man. Amen. And that same word wants to
[2:02:00] speak through you. Amen. Man, I think
[2:02:02] how the prophet tried to make it so
[2:02:03] clear to us. He said, "I'm not the one
[2:02:05] who spoke those things down by the
[2:02:07] river. I was only standing there when it
[2:02:09] happened.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; I wasn't the one who did those things. I
[2:02:13] wasn't the one who read the read the
[2:02:15] hearts. I was only a voice that he
[2:02:17] used." Friends, that's why I'm taking a
[2:02:20] stand for this message. Amen. When
[2:02:22] people are falling away left and right,
[2:02:24] Amen. When when when unbelievers are
[2:02:26] raising up, critics are raising up, I'm
[2:02:28] standing for the message. I'm resting on
[2:02:31] it. I'm standing. I'll tell you why.
[2:02:33] Amen. Because if he wants to come my way
[2:02:35] and do something supernatural in me, I
[2:02:37] just want to be standing when it
[2:02:39] happens. Amen. I want to stand for this
[2:02:41] message. Amen. Believe it with all of my
[2:02:44] heart. Become a tabernacle for it to
[2:02:46] dwell in.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; I want to be standing and I want to see
[2:02:49] something happen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting it tonight.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; I want to take a stand. How many want to
[2:02:55] stand for the word? How many say, God,
[2:02:59] amen. or whatever happens in my life.
[2:03:01] Amen. Don't let me serve a dead idol.
[2:03:03] Amen. But let me come into the image,
[2:03:06] amen, of the son of manifestation.
[2:03:08] Let me reach my full potential. Amen.
[2:03:11] Don't let me stop with virtue. Amen. I
[2:03:13] don't want to stop at knowledge. I want
[2:03:14] to get all the way up into the capstone.
[2:03:17] I want to blend with you. I want to be
[2:03:19] welded together. Amen. Lord, if you got
[2:03:21] to hue me, Lord, if you got to chip away
[2:03:23] at me,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; so be it. Just let that capstone rest on
[2:03:27] me
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; and make me an idol that speaks.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; I challenge you to believe that Jesus
[2:03:35] Christ is revealed in the form of the
[2:03:38] son of man
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; in human flesh
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; in the bride's
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; body. You want to accept his call?
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet tonight as the
[2:03:48] musicians come.
[2:03:56] images of Christ.
[2:04:01] A masterpiece,
[2:04:03] a sculpture,
[2:04:06] a kingly body,
[2:04:09] you a jewel with your own positional
[2:04:11] placing.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Why would we ever take a creed?
[2:04:20] Why would we ever settle for being a
[2:04:21] member of a church, settle for a
[2:04:24] tradition
[2:04:25] when we have an opportunity
[2:04:28] to be the tabernacle of his glory? As we
[2:04:32] bow our heads tonight,
[2:04:35] I just want to bring it down to
[2:04:37] consecration.
[2:04:43] Brothers, sisters, is there anything in
[2:04:45] your life tonight
[2:04:48] that's standing between
[2:04:51] you and his glory.
[2:04:55] Standing between you and your own
[2:04:57] personal manifestation.
[2:05:03] I know we cling to little things. We
[2:05:06] carry around our old habits and our old
[2:05:08] tradition just in case.
[2:05:11] But don't you know you're a temple?
[2:05:16] Don't you know why you're here?
[2:05:21] Don't you know what it means to be the
[2:05:23] bride of Christ? It means you're his
[2:05:26] body. It means his government is trying
[2:05:29] to come down and rest upon your
[2:05:30] shoulders.
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:05:37] God doesn't want to take away your
[2:05:39] filthy language just to make you a good
[2:05:40] church member,
[2:05:44] but he wants to use that voice. He wants
[2:05:47] to use that mouth. He doesn't want to
[2:05:49] clean your hands just to deprive you of
[2:05:52] pleasure.
[2:05:54] He's got He's got something he wants to
[2:05:55] do through those hands. There's places
[2:05:57] you can't go, not because of a law, but
[2:06:00] because he's got footsteps ordained for
[2:06:02] you to step in. You're his temple.
[2:06:06] You're his dwelling place. There's
[2:06:08] somebody in this world that needs you in
[2:06:10] your position.
[2:06:13] I say, "God, let there be nothing
[2:06:15] between nothing between my soul and my
[2:06:18] savior. I'm here, God, to break some
[2:06:20] idols tonight. I Lord, I've got things
[2:06:22] in my life I need to throw down.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I want to raise a cloud of
[2:06:29] dust in my life, Lord. I want to I want
[2:06:30] a cleaning. I I want a con a further
[2:06:34] consecration, Lord. I I want to add to
[2:06:37] my stature, Lord. I want to be in f
[2:06:39] greater submission to the capstone of
[2:06:41] this day. Lord, I want this word to come
[2:06:43] and rest on me. Brother Bram said, if
[2:06:45] you could just prostrate yourself before
[2:06:48] this living God, he would come into you.
[2:06:52] And he begin to speak
[2:06:57] just in your own heart. As brother Kobe
[2:07:00] was saying, let's make a consecration
[2:07:02] tonight.
[2:07:05] But but make sure you're worshiping in
[2:07:06] the right house.
[2:07:08] Make sure you're crying out at the right
[2:07:10] altar.
[2:07:13] Accept his call tonight.
[2:07:16] He's looking down at you and he's
[2:07:17] saying, he's saying, "I want to live
[2:07:20] there. I want to live there in your
[2:07:22] heart. I want to speak through those
[2:07:23] lips. I want to I want there's things I
[2:07:26] want to perform through those hands. I
[2:07:28] want to lead those feet. I want to
[2:07:30] whisper my love secrets into those ears.
[2:07:33] I want I want my mind to be in that
[2:07:35] head. I want I want I want you to see
[2:07:37] through my eyes.
[2:07:40] Oh Jesus, we give you the preeminence
[2:07:42] tonight.

[2:07:46] thou art the most high God.
[2:07:50] Lord, and we are your bride, Lord. And
[2:07:52] it's our ministry and it's our purpose
[2:07:54] to adore you and to worship you, Lord,
[2:07:57] to lift you up, Lord, to honor you with
[2:07:59] our lips and with our life, Lord Jesus.
[2:08:03] We place you in the highest place
[2:08:06] tonight, Lord. We We put you upon a
[2:08:08] throne, Lord. Lord, that the higher we
[2:08:11] lift you, the higher we are lifted
[2:08:14] because we're identify it in you. We
[2:08:16] surrender all that we are, Lord. We
[2:08:18] consecrate oursel to your indwelling,
[2:08:21] Lord Jesus. Let there be nothing
[2:08:23] between. Let there be nothing in our
[2:08:25] life, Lord, that would drive that gentle
[2:08:27] dove away, but let us be a place where
[2:08:29] the Holy Spirit would be comfortable to
[2:08:31] dwell. Come and inhabit us, Lord. Speak
[2:08:33] through us, I pray. Speak through this
[2:08:35] bride. Fill these tabernacles, Lord,
[2:08:38] with your glory tonight as we worship
[2:08:40] you.

[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Is there someone that's not living as
[2:12:05] close as what you should?
[2:12:09] [Music]
[2:12:12] Maybe you say, "Well, I don't didn't
[2:12:14] understand everything that was said." Uh
[2:12:17] maybe there's some new ones that would
[2:12:19] say, "Well, I
[2:12:22] that here's the reality.
[2:12:25] Jesus
[2:12:27] is not wanting to be in heaven, but the
[2:12:30] spirit of God is wanting to come down
[2:12:32] and live in your bodies,

[2:12:53] serving God and serving the devil, well,

[2:12:59] living in an age where where it it's
[2:13:02] it's just all mixed together.
[2:13:05] But it's not mixed together in the
[2:13:06] Bible. The Bible's very clear.
[2:13:10] And we need to hear that message. We
[2:13:12] need to hear that word.
[2:13:15] You can't walk with God and and and
[2:13:17] continue in sin.

[2:36:19] You don't want to wear a skirt. That's
[2:36:21] that's between you and the Lord." And uh
[2:36:25] so I said, "But we've got some skirts if
[2:36:27] you want to." And my wife put some
[2:36:29] skirts out there for her. And she's and
[2:36:31] uh well one day she had a skirt on you

[2:36:55] living room just going back and forth
[2:36:56] back and forth. Fresca finally said,
[2:36:58] "What is wrong with you, Stephanie?"
[2:37:02] And she says, "I need to smoke."
[2:37:05] She says, "Well, go smoke." She says, "I
[2:37:09] got a skirt on."
[2:37:15] And Fresca said, "Well, well, maybe you
[2:37:18] shouldn't be smoking."
[2:37:21] Did you know the Lord came down right
[2:37:23] then, right there, delivered her of
[2:37:28] smoking,
[2:37:29] set her free,
[2:37:32] delivered her
[2:37:34] of heroin,
[2:37:37] delivered her husband of heroin.

[2:38:16] little kid. I mean, she just sat there.
[2:38:18] really what happened next, you know? And
[2:38:20] I would tell her that God can heal and
[2:38:23] she'd say,
[2:38:25] "Really? You think he can do it today?"
[2:38:26] I said, "I know he does it." I told her
[2:38:28] testimonies. She said, "Well, well, then
[2:38:31] God can heal me." That was all it was.
[2:38:33] That's all it took. She just accepted
[2:38:37] it. She had went she had been going to

[2:39:03] she said listen I have been delivered
[2:39:06] from heroin one, I'm saved. I'm serving
[2:39:09] the Lord." The woman said, "Well, they
[2:39:12] wanted to come back here in a in a in a
[2:39:14] few months." And and so she she came
[2:39:16] back.
[2:39:18] And when she came back that next time,
[2:39:24] doctor came back in
[2:39:27] [Music]
