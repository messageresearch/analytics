[44:21] amen
[44:23] we want to minister here this morning

[44:31] weapon
[44:32] formed against you shall prosper amen
[44:37] somebody say no weapon
[44:40] formed against thee
[44:42] shall prosper
[44:44] amen that's some of you know how about
[44:47] us all say it now no weapons
[44:50] formed against thee
[44:52] shall prosper
[44:54] amen now there's a lot of weapons in the
[44:57] world today there's uh there's we've got
[45:00] the nuclear weapons in the hands of
[45:02] unstable governments we've got
[45:04] terrorists who who love to breed fear in
[45:07] the hearts by by their weapons amen they
[45:11] um amen they they don't have to have a
[45:15] way of a a of a plane or a gun they can
[45:18] make bombs they can uh they they they
[45:22] can they've strapped suicide vests to
[45:25] themselves and and go into uh places and
[45:29] and and blow themselves up along with
[45:31] the other people they they they will get
[45:34] in a car and amen drive into a crowded
[45:38] place and blow it up and amen and so uh
[45:42] there's many weapons many weapons that
[45:44] you can that can be used to destroy and
[45:48] and there is there has been a cry amen
[45:52] for uh nuclear disarmament from uh from
[45:56] these evil regimes that are out there
[45:58] that has there's been long talks of the
[46:02] intentions of Iran and you know the uh
[46:06] don't let them enrich uranium because
[46:08] they've made specific evil comments to
[46:12] destroy uh we've had North Korea sending
[46:16] Rockets we've got China flexing its
[46:19] muscle there's a a lot of talk about
[46:21] weapons and there's a a lot of talk
[46:23] about armies amen but God says there's
[46:27] no weapon that is formed against you
[46:30] that is going to prosper amen we've had
[46:34] a lot of debate on gun control in in our
[46:37] country here these last several years
[46:39] and amen it seems like we've had so many
[46:43] of the mass shootings and weapons at the
[46:47] disposal of of bad and evil wicked men
[46:51] and Evil Hearted men and so many are
[46:55] saying that we've got to remedy it by
[46:58] confiscating all of the weapons amen
[47:01] many say that we need to arm more people
[47:03] with weapons we've we've got amen but as
[47:06] long as there is is uh uh uh
[47:10] um on Earth and Evil on the earth
[47:12] there's there's going to be no peace and
[47:16] there's going to be no place and no
[47:19] safety except for the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:22] amen that's right Amen in the recent
[47:25] months we've had uh people using objects
[47:28] thrown in concerts and injuring the
[47:30] performers and giving him stitches so
[47:33] you can do away with the guns you can do
[47:35] away with the nuclear warfare you can do
[47:37] away with a lot of things but as long as
[47:40] there is evil in the hearts of men there
[47:43] are weapons around but I've heard the
[47:46] voice of the Lord say there is not a
[47:49] weapon formed against you that is going
[47:51] to prosper amen can you say Amen amen
[47:55] but then there's the onslaught of the
[47:57] weapons that are uh uh of the enemy
[48:00] against our souls and these are
[48:03] spiritual weapons that are formed
[48:06] against the people of God Amen and boy
[48:09] does he know how to use Mass uh weapons
[48:11] of mass destruction when it comes to the
[48:14] souls of man amen men and women there
[48:17] are we're living in an age where where
[48:19] where where Satan has so uh broken homes
[48:23] and broken marriages and broken are
[48:26] young people in the heritage is it and
[48:30] even our soul but yet we are standing
[48:33] here with the promise that no weapon
[48:37] formed against you shall prosper now now
[48:42] amen that doesn't say that there wasn't
[48:45] going to be any weapons it didn't say
[48:47] that he was going to confiscate all the
[48:48] weapons he didn't say that he was going
[48:50] to annihilate all the weapons he said in
[48:53] any weapon that has formed against you
[48:57] will not Prosper somebody say no weapon
[49:02] formed against me shall prosper no
[49:07] weapon formed against me shall prosper
[49:10] you know what I'm going to stand upon
[49:12] the promises of God because God's word
[49:15] cannot lie When God says it he means it
[49:21] now there's a lot of Weaponry out there
[49:23] there's a lot of Amen a lot of things
[49:25] that are out there but if God says it
[49:28] that I'm going to believe it amen now
[49:31] the scripture says this is the heritage
[49:34] of the Saints of the Lord for their
[49:37] righteousness is of me amen so it's not
[49:42] depending upon my righteousness it's not
[49:44] depending upon yours it's depending upon
[49:46] his righteousness now I want us to to
[49:49] think for a for a few moments as we look
[49:52] here at this 54th chapter of the book of
[49:55] Isaiah because if you were to look in
[49:58] the first of the 54th chapter you would
[50:01] see that amen Jerusalem is is is as a
[50:05] mother that is weeping for her children
[50:07] amen of course this is symbolic of of
[50:10] the amen God putting Israel away as a
[50:14] divorced wife amen as you read on down
[50:17] through there you will find that Israel
[50:20] had been carried away into Babylon and
[50:23] and that she had as uh you know been
[50:26] carried away for 70 years and she had
[50:29] lost her sons and her daughters and she
[50:32] had become like a a barren woman without
[50:35] a husband and Israel had provoked God
[50:39] unto anchor amen and so according to
[50:43] Ezra the the second chapter the
[50:46] scripture says that she was reduced down
[50:49] to 42 000 people amen that was all that
[50:53] came out of captivity uh there in when
[50:57] they came out of Babylon now that's
[50:59] quite a contrast from the 2.5 million
[51:02] that came out of Egypt at the beginning
[51:05] amen so she truly was a woman without
[51:09] her children she was as a widow amen she
[51:14] she was you know broken and bruised and
[51:18] amen and if you were to read in fact
[51:21] amen man I I I'll just go ahead and read
[51:23] some of it for you here in Isaiah 54 and
[51:27] and and one and it says single Baron
[51:30] thou that ditch not bear and Break Forth
[51:34] into singing and cry aloud thou that
[51:37] didst not travail with child for more of
[51:40] the children of the death slip than the
[51:42] children of the married wife saith the
[51:44] Lord
[51:45] enlarge the place of thy tent and let
[51:49] them stretch forth the curtains of thine
[51:53] habitation spare not and lengthen thy
[51:56] cords and strengthen thy Stakes for Thou
[52:00] shalt Break Forth on the right hand and
[52:02] on the left and thy seed shall inherit
[52:06] the Gentiles and make desolate cities to
[52:09] be inhabited fear not for thou shall not
[52:12] be ashamed neither shall thou be
[52:15] confounded for thou shall not be put to
[52:18] shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of
[52:21] thy you that shall not remember the
[52:24] reproach of thy widowhood any more for
[52:27] thy maker is thine husband and the Lord
[52:30] of hosts is his name thy Redeemer the
[52:34] Holy One of Israel the Lord the god of
[52:37] the whole Earth shall he be called for
[52:40] the Lord hath called thee a woman
[52:43] Forsaken and grieved in spirit a wife of
[52:47] Youth when she when thou was refused
[52:50] saith the Lord thy God and for a small
[52:53] moment have I forsaken thee but with
[52:56] great Mercy will I gather thee in a
[53:01] little wrath I hit my face from from
[53:03] thee for a moment but with Everlasting
[53:07] kindness will I have mercy on thee saith
[53:11] the Lord thy God Amen and he's and he
[53:14] goes on down and he continues but you
[53:17] see amen you see God is now
[53:19] affectionately calling unto Israel amen
[53:24] before and he's telling them now he's
[53:26] saying now before the child in Army had
[53:30] came in and carried you into the land of
[53:33] Babylon you were mine amen and before
[53:36] your stubbornness and before you you
[53:40] willfully walked away from my word you
[53:43] were mine I've allowed you to go in amen
[53:48] and you have suffered and amen you have
[53:50] gone through some of the some of the the
[53:53] shame that that you have had to endure
[53:55] you're coming back home you're
[53:57] embarrassed you're you're coming back
[53:59] home and amen and your head is not
[54:02] really hanging too high but he's telling
[54:05] them but I want you to know I want you
[54:08] to remember you are mine amen you've
[54:12] always been mine you oh well praise the
[54:15] Lord now I've created the waster to
[54:18] destroy I created the Smith to make an
[54:22] iron amen but there is no happened
[54:25] somebody say no weapon now I I'm saying
[54:29] this here this morning is because many
[54:31] times we get into the to the areas of
[54:34] our life where we walk contrary to the
[54:37] word of God we walk contrary to what God
[54:40] has said in our lives and many times
[54:43] amen he has to bring his his arms amen
[54:48] his Swift hand of of Correction and many
[54:52] a times where we're living in our you
[54:54] know in the regrets and we're living in
[54:56] the in the situations of of hurts and
[55:00] fears and amen and regrets of the past
[55:03] amen you remember if God is correcting
[55:06] his sons and daughters he's got a reason
[55:09] for it you have always been his son and
[55:14] you will always be his son he's got a
[55:18] purpose in what he is doing
[55:22] well praise the Lord now many times we
[55:26] we quote that quote amen for the weapons
[55:29] of our Warfare amen are not carnal But
[55:32] Mighty through God but yet we fail to
[55:36] realize many a times we're having to
[55:40] stand up in the midst amen of a failure
[55:45] and come into recovery
[55:48] now I want us to look for look at this
[55:50] for a moment amount he says now you've
[55:53] come back broken and bruised you've
[55:55] suffered embarrassments you've you've
[55:58] borne the reproach of your failings amen
[56:00] but he says I'm going to redeem you back
[56:02] to myself amen I will be a husband to
[56:05] you again and your barrenness will be
[56:09] forgotten and your sin of your youth
[56:12] amen shall be forgiven and this city
[56:16] shall once again be inhabited well

[57:03] times we we can look and see how uh in
[57:07] our lives amen we go through the seasons
[57:10] of purification amen just amen as as
[57:15] there are periods of cycles of time amen
[57:18] for for a woman so is there for the
[57:21] bride of Christ there is there are
[57:23] Cycles amen a purification where God
[57:27] comes in into his and begins to work in
[57:31] his church and begins to really a man to

[57:37] need to be purified and his blood begins
[57:41] to wash us and purify us well can you
[57:45] say Amen it's in those times that God
[57:48] begins to shine the light upon our lives
[57:52] and we can see where we've allowed sin
[57:55] where we've allowed things we've allowed
[57:57] bitterness we've allowed things to to
[58:00] come in and to dominate our lives amen
[58:04] may all that time you're still the bride

[58:15] to be a man cleansed from within

[58:27] we're looking many times we feel like a
[58:31] woman forsaken amen we feel like amen

[59:35] control of his power now his eyes were
[59:38] put out and he was going to suffer the
[59:41] consequences can you say Amen but when
[59:44] Samson began to Humble himself and
[59:47] Samson began to call out to God and
[59:50] Samson says God I've been wrong I've
[59:53] wandered all somehow someway somewhere

[1:11:49] I must go and Elijah must first come and
[1:11:53] restore all things
[1:11:57] Amen in other words the church was going
[1:12:00] to go through amen those four stages
[1:12:03] amen they were going to that the tree
[1:12:05] was going to lose its leaves it was
[1:12:08] going to lose its fruit it was going to
[1:12:10] lose its bark and it was going to get
[1:12:12] down to the very life the root of the
[1:12:15] tree but God said it was an Army that he
[1:12:19] had sent to reprove that tree but there
[1:12:23] was going to be a restoration time to
[1:12:27] come back

[1:12:44] laugh that was in the tree and then out

[1:13:11] looking at the church of what it was in
[1:13:13] in the Dark Ages and what it's been in
[1:13:16] the past but he's got a pride he's got
[1:13:18] somebody that he's had his hand upon
[1:13:20] he's got somebody a man that that is
[1:13:23] that is sensitive to his spirit and

[1:13:52] promise was that the former and the
[1:13:54] latter rain would come to and fall

[1:13:58] amen we're witnessing that he said the
[1:14:01] 24th verse and the floors shall be full
[1:14:04] of Wheat and the fats shall overflow

[1:14:58] Lord that hath dealt wondrously with you
[1:15:02] and my people shall never be ashamed and
[1:15:05] you shall know that I'm in the midst of
[1:15:06] Israel that I am the Lord your God and

[1:15:37] last amen two or three Wednesday nights
[1:15:42] on family
[1:15:44] and and as we have been really hitting
[1:15:47] this and a man and and and there has
[1:15:50] been some that have that has said I I've
[1:15:52] become a little bit ashamed amen some of
[1:15:56] you ladies saying I I I I've allowed
[1:15:59] that hard Spirit my callous Spirit to
[1:16:03] take over my daintiness my my my my mind
[1:16:08] that that that that softness that God
[1:16:10] gave me some of you men have been saying
[1:16:13] you know I've not been as dedicated amen
[1:16:16] and disciplined with the word of God
[1:16:18] that is that is in my life and my and
[1:16:22] how to deal with my family and amen and

[1:17:13] only way that we're going to stand up
[1:17:15] against that Spirit outside those doors
[1:17:18] is to get some discipline on the inside

[1:17:23] to be women we need women to stay out of
[1:17:25] the place of the man and we need the man

[1:21:10] fine feminist Spirit they wear their
[1:21:12] clothes like a man they cut their hair
[1:21:14] like a man they smoke like a man they
[1:21:16] drink like a man they cuss like a man

[1:21:31] person to find isn't that right yes

[1:21:36] supposed to stand up and act like a man
[1:21:38] digging Burly because she's dainty amen
[1:21:42] a feminist spirit amen she is sweet
[1:21:46] loving not big carrying on acting like a
[1:21:48] man what she's not supposed to be when
[1:21:51] when she does that her life is perverted
[1:21:53] she's sweet loving kind where Adam is
[1:21:57] more the Burly type for he was the man
[1:21:59] the masculine type the woman is the
[1:22:01] feminist can you say Amen now now

[1:33:52] I want you to know that it's real this
[1:33:54] is what you have brought the people to
[1:33:57] and Moses got to look over into that

[1:35:59] morning I say there should be a joy in
[1:36:02] the hearts of the believer Satan cannot
[1:36:06] destroy you
[1:36:13] because there's something in the heart
[1:36:15] of the believer that Satan does not have
[1:36:17] and that's the ability to say I'm wrong
[1:36:22] Satan never could Satan never will his
[1:36:25] son Cain could not would not
[1:36:29] even after he was given the opportunity
[1:36:33] but a believer

[1:37:09] you're wretched
[1:37:10] you're miserable
[1:37:13] and you're flat out deceived

[1:37:19] is quite different than that of her
[1:37:21] husband
[1:37:27] praise the Lord
[1:37:29] but what did God say inside that
[1:37:32] stagnant Church

[1:49:30] I'm using the word of God
[1:49:34] now
[1:49:36] these were so equipped
[1:49:39] that
[1:49:42] it it it was a it was a heat-seeking
[1:49:44] missile
[1:49:46] and
[1:49:48] and as it was coming
[1:49:50] those things those things you didn't
[1:49:52] have to have them just lined up
[1:49:53] perfectly
[1:49:54] if you just got them in the general
[1:49:56] direction
[1:49:57] those things
[1:50:03] and it didn't matter how the devil
[1:50:05] brought him in how the devil tried to
[1:50:06] destroy it didn't matter what there was
[1:50:08] no are y'all are y'all no weapon
[1:50:13] formed against you
[1:50:17] that shall prosper
[1:50:20] but now he's told him now now I've
[1:50:22] allowed you to go into captivity
[1:50:24] I'm bringing you back
[1:50:27] I'm bringing you back to me
[1:50:30] Stay With Me
[1:50:33] where I am
[1:50:35] Devils can't stand
[1:50:38] where I am
[1:50:40] victories are all around
[1:50:43] can you see man
[1:50:46] and I just want to say that the word of
[1:50:48] God Amen now Ephesians 6 talks about all
[1:50:52] the defensive amen the armor
[1:50:55] man there's the
[1:50:57] there's the shield of Faith there's the
[1:50:59] there's the breastplate of righteousness
[1:51:01] this helmet of salvation she the feet
[1:51:03] shout about with the preparation of the
[1:51:05] Gospel law and skirt about with truth
[1:51:09] but there's one offensive weapon
[1:51:14] and that's the reason why we're lining
[1:51:16] everything that we are up with that
[1:51:18] weapon
[1:51:20] and you talking about a
[1:51:21] heat-seeking missile this is a
[1:51:24] demon-seeking missile
[1:51:27] and if you keep that thing activated
[1:51:29] it'll knock those weapons out of the
[1:51:32] Skies coming and going
[1:51:34] it'll keep the enemy out of your mind if
[1:51:37] you'll allow the word to do that
[1:51:40] can you say amen I was telling someone
[1:51:42] the other day you can either look at the
[1:51:44] situations that are not exactly the way
[1:51:46] they should be and there's nothing in
[1:51:48] your power to change that or you can
[1:51:51] look at your purpose that I am here with
[1:51:54] a Divine Purpose and Satan cannot
[1:51:58] destroy that purpose in my life
[1:52:02] God's word says it God's Prophet
[1:52:05] declared it as he looked through
[1:52:07] thousands and thousands of visions and
[1:52:10] he could say I say there is nothing that
[1:52:13] can destroy the purpose of God in one's
[1:52:18] life
[1:52:21] to allow those missiles to come into my
[1:52:24] mind telling me what this and that and
[1:52:28] no no no no no no I'm gonna send the
[1:52:31] word of God out and defeat it before it
[1:52:34] even hits me
[1:52:38] you say man
[1:52:40] amen do you love him
[1:52:44] if the musicians would come
[1:52:47] amen
[1:52:50] he's the one
[1:52:53] that has formed me
[1:52:56] he's the one that has called me
[1:53:00] I am his
[1:53:02] he is mine
[1:53:06] now you can say it you can say it and
[1:53:08] this is where this is where I've been
[1:53:10] coming back to the scripture
[1:53:12] a man coming back
[1:53:14] to being diligent
[1:53:17] and disciplined according to the word
[1:53:19] concerning me
[1:53:22] I must believe that word
[1:53:26] and I've got to be disciplined about it
[1:53:31] we're living in a non-disciplined age
[1:53:34] where the word has been torn and we
[1:53:36] understand it we we've seen it all the
[1:53:37] way back to the third third Church age
[1:53:39] where Jezebel seduced the servants
[1:53:46] we understand that was
[1:53:49] amen when when 83 25
[1:53:52] I see a room we we understand those
[1:53:55] things
[1:53:58] where Jezebel started leading the church
[1:54:00] and before you know it
[1:54:01] amen

[1:54:11] she told lies
[1:54:14] listen folks the entire world entire
[1:54:17] world at one time entire world
[1:54:20] we're Catholics
[1:54:24] and none of it's based on truth
[1:54:28] come on
[1:54:32] but the prophet told us if you just keep
[1:54:34] telling a lie long enough
[1:54:36] and just keep saying you believe it and
[1:54:38] you'll make others believe it
[1:54:41] and you can convince yourself that
[1:54:43] you're right
[1:54:48] and you'll do what you're going to do
[1:54:49] because you believe it oh you might say
[1:54:51] oh man I wish I wouldn't oh man no you
[1:54:54] do it because that's who you are
[1:54:58] that's your belief system
