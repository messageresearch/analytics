Tabernacle one Sunday morning and there is a famous story of brother Branham healing a little girl in Germany who didn't have any eyeballs and you all know the story and he's he said to her he said honey if he said if you had eyeballs what color would you like and she said well I've heard that blue was nice and he prayed for her and her eyes opened she had she had eyeballs and I didn't see that

and he was Discerning some things and uh he he turned to that little girl he said oh he said uh he said we know our precious sister here from Jeffersonville and he said she blind and he's but now she had eyeballs but she was just blind and he called her up there and I was just sitting right close and and uh he prayed a little prayer faith and laid his fingers on her eyelids and when she raised or

amen amen God bless you you may have your seats just for a few moments if you would say good morning it's good to be gathered together again one more time and in New Life Outreach it's honor and a blessing to be here in Oklahoma for the first time and we've certainly enjoyed ourselves and what a grand time we've had sister Mara who is not with me here today and maybe there's another year another opportunity possibly she'd come back and be with us we've been married 43 years and that only makes me 50. [Music] and a few more years I'm 62 years old but we got married when we were just kids and I was 18 she was 16 and a half and two lovely children Jonah's here with us and Isaac his son which we're thankful they could travel with us three generations here which is a blessing sister Mara gives her greetings and her love to you and she says God bless you it's such a blessing to see brother Dan's sister Dolly here as well from Canada I didn't even get permission to come and I feel pretty good to be here brother Dan because it's good to be here in Pawnee Oklahoma with you with all the saints of God and I'd like to just say that being my first time in Oklahoma but not my first time knowing brother wendo known him for many years and and it's been such a blessing to our church sister Jessica and himself and while the Oklahoma hospitality is over the top it's kind of that kind of hospitality that says my goodness and there's nothing that we have need of the accommodations are over the top and the food and everything that is taken care of and we say from the depths of our heart brother Wendell to your church God bless you and thank you for taking care of us while we're here as it's been said already the music is wonderful specials are incredible I thought this morning we should have a sing in service and I actually thought it was going that way and I thought we should have just kept on after brother Kenny and because I don't know if there's anything more to preach I guess we have the the introduction of the Bible we can turn to this morning but Brothers certainly did a wonderful time and it's an honor to stand together with these Great Men of God I say God bless each and every one of you have been enriched by your Ministries and as I'm going home with a new person more determined to press the good fight of faith I appreciated that brother Darryl give your all to the Gospel of Jesus Christ I think that was good for all of us sometimes in life we can get a little bit this way or that way get caught up just with the busyness of life and we forget what the real part is and the real thing is in this the things of God but it's good to hear it again and to be able to move ourselves back into a place that God would be pleased with us so I say God bless you to a man of God that are here the pastors evangelists that are here God bless richly bless each and every one of you it's an honor to get to know some of you I've heard your names before but it's just an honor to see you put a name to the face and it says great is the Lord good to us I've thoroughly enjoyed myself in these meetings and and well we have one more to go so yeah yeah if you have your Bibles this morning I'd like to turn to a few scripture verses if I could to Psalms 44. verses one to three there's one thing when you're the last Minister you you hear the different scriptures that are used in the different quotes that are used in and you say well he just took my scripture and he just took my quote so if you get to hear it one more time this morning just bear with me this morning when brother the brother was preaching yesterday I thought my goodness if he keeps on going I'm locking up no scriptures left then I'd written down I thought brother Andrew just stop right there here we are this morning I certainly enjoyed that last night all the services I've thoroughly enjoyed we have heard with our ears oh God our fathers have told us what work thou did Us in the in their day and in the days of old how thou did us drive out the Heathen with thy hand and plantus them how thou disaff afflict the people in castamon for they got not to land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arms say them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy continence because thou had his favor unto them I believe we are people that the Lord has had favor upon us amen it's one thing I appreciate the testimonies of Years Gone by but I certainly do appreciate every testimony that the Lord is doing right now in the midst of his people in this church and around the world Romans chapter 8 verse 11. but of the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you say that's me he that raise up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen we're in that season of time First Corinthians 2 4 and 5 brother Andrew and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of of power that your faith should not let's say should not should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God now if any person had had a right to have somebody follow them in his words it was Paul but Paul said I counted everything but done that Christ could be formed in him and he did not want people to be looking at him but he wanted them to be looking at Christ who he was representing on the Earth and anytime we Minister we we speak the word of the Lord if we speak it in a way to draw attention to ourselves we're doing it up not according to the word of God we should always give honor and praise and glory unto the Living God for he's the one that's in our midst and he's the one that's doing everything it's by his word it's by his sword we're only his servants amen you can have your seats if you wish I'd like to speak this morning briefly on the bride is rising up if there's ever a Time the bride is rising up is in the hour that we're living in today and this bride that is upon the Earth today is not a bride that is that is a just a small girl anymore but she is a full mature bride of Jesus Christ that's here today A bride that has been taught by the word of God a bride that knows that the god that she serves as a living God a bride that is not intimidated by men and by intellectualism but a bride that is very very into the word of God and stands in the word of God and keeps herself in the word of God and becomes familiar with the word of God she's only interested in one diet and not diet is the word of God anything else outside of that that's interjected into it I'm not interested in it I know you're all not interested in it we're interested in what does God have to say in the word of God for this day if there's one thing that I find disheartening is when men put in denominational ideas into this word of God that make us something that it's not and that it will bring Deliverance to the people that we we've got to live with our problems I say we don't have to live with your problem we got a Living God on the scene here this morning hour that's more than able to deliver any problem that's in the people amen this our God is alive in this hour why would we want to go back to something that is dead carrying into something that is dead when we have something that's real in this hour something that has truth in this hour something that brings Deliverance in this hour something that gives us an assurance in this hour there's something I don't I don't go for I don't go for any of that do not of that denominational thinking or intellectualism we want the power of the Living God I say this morning or if a man can't even can't even hardly preach his way out of wet paper bag as we would say but if he's got the power of God in his life that's the only thing that matters to me is the power of the Living God that's what the people need that's what brings Deliverance to the people and this bride has risen up she's not she's not just moved around I appreciate her brother Sean had to say yesterday we just because somebody has a vision or somebody has a dream or somebody has something well I'm not moved by it I wait to find out what it is and I what I find out many times is an evil spirit and when it is an evil spirit I never see that person wanted to get delivered from it they just go on to the next thing amen I say that if we go according to the word of God if there's something that's not right amen we got to come back to the Bible and back to the way they handled in the scripture and the Bible said if a dreamer or somebody prophesies something that is not according to the word of God we got a right to go back to it and say what you said was an heir therefore you've got an evil spirit and that Spirit needs to be prayed off of you amen they don't want to Humble themselves but I say this morning our it's good to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of almighty God let him come on the scene a lot of people that to me that's just a Corinthian Church which was the weakest Church in the entire New Testament everybody had a dream everybody had a saying everybody had something they all wanted to try to make themselves something when they actually actually what they were is they were just a weak Church amen they wanted the glory for everything rather than giving the glory to God but I say we find ourselves in the book of Ephesians which is where the bride is in in the book of Ephesians we know who we are we know that we've been predestinated onto life we know the sea Gene of God is within our hearts amen we're not moved by trivial things if it's not the word we stand still I hope that's okay this morning it's going to be the truth or we're not interested in it either it comes with a message or we're not interested in it and what you see in the message If It Don't Fit in the Bible you better look at it again it's gonna fit in the scripture amen I hope this is okay to close the meetings out with but amen we're the bride we're rising up we have risen up we're hoping the people will rise up and recognize who they are a brother Brown said I'm going to say something National Force but Israel in her Homeland a national force will put the church in the world Council of of churches but the power let's say the power but the power of God will put the people in the brine amen the world force is this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no National Force will do it all the things we're going through they're not going to put it as God that's putting us in place amen but the National Force did Drive Israel to the Homeland the National Force of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power let's say power but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it amen I'm not worried about staying here I'm worried about getting out of it amen well whatever happens in the world you know I I get disheartened too I look at our governments and I think what in the world are they doing and then I get in the spirit and I realize what they're doing is creating chaos amongst themselves in order that we can go into rapture because if it doesn't it does it all Rapture amen this world has to fall apart amen the economy has to drop out so we can get an erupture and we wonder sometimes why are they doing this and that they're anointed to do what they're doing amen because they're being forced into it by evil power but we're being forced into the kingdom of God to drive us upward this pride is going up he said she went up not going down not people want to be Earthbound they can be Earthbound but I've been set free a long time ago I'm not about to be Earthbound anymore amen I'm praying Christ in this hour I may not preach like a Canadian and I'm happy that I don't I'll tell you brother Brown my brother brought it to my attention one time and he said said that that the Canadian people are starchy and he was really trying to drive a point at me and in a different country and and because he hadn't been to my church and he he so he I guess he was the bishop of my church too I I didn't know I had so many Bishops and and so he told me he he said that that all you Canadians are starchy I said well don't say that about me because you don't even know me I'll be honest with you I hope it's okay I'm going to say this you don't know me so we're getting to know each other uh brother Branham said it in Saskatoon that we were Moss packed I'll tell you what church I made a determination of my heart that was not going to be me it was not going to be my church it was not going to be anything to do with me and if that is the spirit I'm gonna fight and I'll fight it with all my heart until I've got nothing left in a fight I refuse to be bossed back I refuse to be dead I refuse for myself not to worship I refuse all of those things I am the son of the Living God I've got my right and we've got our right to worship we have our right to praise God Amen I lived in the church for many years you could hear the lights buzz I said that's not going to be my church amen do we if all we have is living lights what's that amen we live in people in the church people with determination people that say under the serve God with all my heart I'm not gonna give up or back down or move out under Eternal Living God Hallelujah foreign let's act like the brine if we're going up let's think we're going on amen we gotta show our neighbors got to see it in our lives the people got to see it in our lives we are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we're a living bride we're Mrs Jesus Christ we heard this morning amen that and if we're misses Jesus Christ let's conduct yourself like Mrs Jesus Christ Hallelujah we're part of him if we're part of him then we got to be like him and we are like him I determined a long time ago it wasn't going to be me before he even brought up that quote I thought that was the past I thought man that's 60 60 some years ago I said we come up the road a long way from that time would I say that we're privileged to live in the hour that we're living in today we're living at the time of the coming of the Lord so if we're living at that time and we know the changing of our mortal bodies is just around the corner where we're going to go from mortality to immortality brother Brown said that's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity amen so what a great what a grand time we get to live in of all the times that could be chosen for any person God saved you for the last for this time because he knew that you would that that you were favored and he knew that you would accept his word in this hour amen and so we can say today we have received a Vindicated message amen from God we're living the age of the restoration I say the word of God has been restored to the people parts of it are becoming more enlightened as we continue on our journey because we need it in this hour of the journey amen the loose answers were left through the six Church ages have been all tied back to the word which is Christ amen and software tied back to the word then we know who we are we no longer look into a glass Darkly but we can see him now face to face and we see him that we see a reflection back and I appreciate that brother Sean with that mirror we see a reflection that that's me in the mirror in other words I'm part of him and he's part of me and we're reflecting back because he's the word and we're the word and we're reflecting back to him the word in this hour amen and that's not a word that's a denominational word or a charismatic word or something from a former age but it's something that's fresh meat to the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour something that we hold on to something that we chew into something that changes ourselves into the image that he would have us to be and he's doing it I say this if I would have tried to I would have given up on myself a long time ago but I'm glad he don't give up on me amen there's something that's so beautiful to me is he in the Philippians one chapters of chapter one verse six he said he which begun a good work in me will conclude it he'll complete it amen so it's not my work it's his work amen when we start to think that it's me no it's not you it's Christ in you because he favored you therefore he gave you of his Spirit he gave you the word he gave that seed inside of your heart you become part of him he's part of you how could he forsake you could never forsake you so on this in this hour the Bride of Jesus Christ comes into full reality of who she is she has accepted the headship of the word I'll say that one more time she has accepted the headship of the word because that's the part that the other ages left out they didn't want us as he kept God kept moving forward they would not accept the headship of the word but you have accepted the headship of the word amen and it's a good word it's a good land and we're happy to be in this land and the bride realizes that she will be an invincible Army it's not she might be an invincible Army but she is an invisible Army let's say I'm invincible you are an invincible Army and it's not because of your sword but it's because his sword it's not your word it's his word and if it's his work then let's use that word there we go and because that you are an invincible Army you've been given the ability to spiritually discern the two Spirits under the framework of the Christian church that's important because in this hour's Lord deception there's a lot of spirits that are deceptive so I said this Olive that we need that in our lives in order that we realize Who We Are the word Invincible in the dictionary means incapable of being conquered can't be conquered it goes on it says you can't be overcome or subdued so if you can't be overcome or sir dude then you could say well I'm a child of the king amen God has been my favor amen I'm gonna go out every single day and I'm gonna walk the walk and talk the talk of this word because I'm incapable of being conquered you're incapable of being conquered and capable means it's impossible to say impossible I say with passion impossible impossible to be conquered oh that makes me feel good when I think about it hey man when I know that God's on my side amen that's him that's fighting my battles for me I just stand in the spot and he fights it for me it's not me it's not you but it's him that's why we're interested in here we're entrusted in Christ who's the word not a fake we love our imagination but the word let's say the word which is Christ which is you we're part of that word somebody say praise the Lord [Applause] when Satan came to tempt our Lord in Matthew chapter 4. Jesus didn't use any Supernatural power to resist him he only used the father's word if it wasn't the word it would have done had no effect upon Satan if Jesus would have actually fallen into the tribe but he didn't use anything Supernatural he only used his word so we know the fortification comes from the word you want to be fortified stay underneath in in behind the word you step out of the word you'll be in no match for the devil that's why there's no do's and don'ts in this message that's why there's no legalism in this message amen because if we want to stay fortified we stay in the word the word becomes our fortification it becomes what protects us from The Wiles of the enemy but if you step out into an Internet site you got better pull yourself back you step out in a certain area you're going to pull yourself back where are you going to pull back to you're going to pull it back to the word amen because the word becomes our fortification it has to be the word nothing else will do not adding to it or taken away from it or putting things in here amen and making it's got to be the word second Timothy 11 13-15 says for such our false apostles see for workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and it says no wonder or no Marvel Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light their first no great thing if his Ministers of righteousness whose Aunt shall be according to their Works amen so Satan comes as a message preacher [Applause] he can quote the word but there's always going to be places where there's going to be problems within it amen I find sometimes you hear people they say things and excuse me for a moment here I I was I was saying Lord help me Jesus but I'll say this when people say should we stay home and listen to tapes or go to church that's not even some you should be even considered [Music] you say what's up brother Kelly because our brother Paul told us in the in the Bible that God placed the prideful Ministry in the church he told us in the Bible gather yourself together that much more as you see that day approaching and people are sitting at home just maybe give me a little bit more and then they don't know they should be in church and I find such a confusion among certain people and they're saying should I be a church or or should I be listening to somebody tell me to push play I say it like this keep pushing play but come to the house of God let the world know what side you're on what's wrong with the people hey but they won't take the Bible anymore and believe the word of almighty God [Applause] it's a disgrace to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to the to the Vindicated message on the hour for a brother how to preach anything outside of what was in their scripture it would not be accounted for let me back it up Chicago Ministerial Association then that same group of men sent a lady down said brother brown but the angel of the Lord told you he said the angel of the Lord you know his picture is there you see that the angel of the Lord told you that well we'll believe it I said anybody that a mysterial group that would be that weak if the angel of the Lord said say I'm awake well we got about 40 percent a week I hope we got six here seventy percent at least a week good to see you this morning God bless you he said if the angel said something contrary to the word it wouldn't be the angel of the Lord so I don't care if they call themselves a prophet I don't care if they call himself teacher I don't care what name they put on their self if it's not according to the word I don't accept it how can we go so far down when we won't ever take the word anymore we'll take somebody else's thought that's no different than their denominational world and if you had her take away from this prophecy your pie will be taken away from the kingdom of God [Applause] Hallelujah brother Abraham goes further the angel of the Lord will vindicate the word that's exactly what he's always done through every age he still does the same thing he stays with the word and any minister Anointed with the Holy Ghost will stay by the same word because the Bible said the entire Bible was wrote by the Holy Ghost and how can you have the Holy Ghost and deny what the Bible says the very spirit in you it Bears record that it's not from God [Applause] that's a powerful word so if that's what the word is then if we're in the word we're fortified by the word and we're the bride that's rising up amen we're going to say in the word for not to be in the word puts herself outside of the word it's not the spirit of the Living God in us and it's another spirit and there's only one other Spirit that's the spirit of the devil I know people don't want to hear that they think because they got will you Branham on their back or they got some batch on their shirt that makes him a Christian that don't make you no Christian you need to be born again by the spirit of almighty God you can't even call Jesus of Christ without the Holy Ghost you're just mentioning words we've got to come back to the foundation of this message into the foundation of the Bible [Applause] oh it's sinking sound Hallelujah [Applause] got one more two's confirmation if the angel of the Lord told me something that wasn't in the Bible it wouldn't be the angel of the Lord that's right he never one time have told me anything but what was in the word so if the angel only told him what was in the word then we're interested in what the angel has to say has to be in the word without that sinking sound that's why people can be in a message church for 40 or 50 years and all of a sudden see what in the world happened to that guy amen they weren't in the word because if they would have studied it in the word they would have known what the word says amen but they were enticed by enticing spirits because Satan transforms himself like an angel of Light just like his ministers do hope that's okay amen I can preach this this morning I've been around in this message all my life I was in the I was six years five years old when I when my dad first gave his heart to the Lord in 1966 all I know is this message amen I've seen the ups and the Downs I've seen the splits three of them in their own church I've seen a lot of things happen over the years and I've seen a lot of carnality of men amen but I I want to say this this morning when you come back to the word that's where you get your stability from that's where you get your wholeness from that's where you get your faith from that's where you get what you have need of and there's hours from it's from the word of almighty God I'll say it one more time honor that interested in any man what they have to say if it's not in the word of God but if it's in the word of God I know it's coming from the angel because he'll only bring the word to the people well if it's okay brother Wendell I don't know if you'll invite me back again but I'm going to preach with all I got anyhow all I know is what's in this word of God I love it with all my heart have to be honest I'm passionate about it amen I think we need to be passionate about it in the hour that we're living in I have something to be passionate about you have something to be passionate about it's got to be the word you can feel good one day and feel not feel good the other day but that shouldn't that shouldn't affect your salvation I've been dealing with a scripture back home in Romans 15. and when you look at it through another translation it says that we should have uncontainable uncontainable joy and that uncontainable Joy is it because you're feeling good every day but in your soul realm there's something that that's uncontainable when you realize that you are once a sinner and you got saved by grace of almighty God and he took drugs out of your life and he took alcohol out of your life and he took cigarettes out of your life he took a moral living out of your life you got something to be happy hey man you man you the edible Joy not because I feel good but because of what Christ has done in this hour Hallelujah it's price he's the one that's done it why because you're favored and if you're favored you should accept it glorify God in it people sit in church oh I'm praising the Lord and I said I don't know nobody knows you're praising them we're not doing have no mental telepathy in here so we're not reading your minds they sit there like a bump on a pickle as brother Brown said I know who can't move around at all or thank the Lord amen you say brother Kelly if you only know what what's happened this last week well are you here has Christ been good to you has he been with you through the week then you got something to Rejoice about Hallelujah [Applause] we need to have Liberty it's like brother Brown I'm not even I don't know where we're going to go this morning we're gonna go wherever we're going to go brother Brown's sitting on his chair and those people started cutting it up on this front row there got out there wash pounds and stuff started dancing around he thought what in the world did I let my church that's what he said I'm glad it's on tape maybe I've looked at her for a while but it's still there it's on tape everybody says you got to be on tape it's on tape and and so just go to go back and push play and you'll find it on the tape [Applause] and and he said he was critical and the Holy Spirit started speaking to him he said well you just don't got as much Victory as they got if you were the man sitting at the gate called beautiful and G and Peter and John they walk by your way and you never walked in your life before and they said silver gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you and he pulls them by the hand and man's never walk gets on his feet he would have just be all you know what this feels so good to be walking I you know what I just saw the Lord done something for me no you would be jumping just like he was jumping amen and when you know what Christ has done for you it'll do something foreign [Applause] thank you for his goodness it's uncontainable Joy what he's done for us he will say you're working up the people no the words working on them it's a word that's in the crowd has done for hope they got something to thank him for this bride is moving up do you know the Bible says that he rejoices with us and we rejoice in him he loves the joy of his people amen if I came home every day my wife wasn't was Sour every day my goodness he wouldn't want to go home that's for free so I did my notes brother Wendell didn't tell me to say it so you wouldn't want to go home why would he want to come in our midst if we said sourdough stopping back the holy spirit for moving and blessing somebody when our very attitudes can actually hinder the moving of the spirit of the Living God I know who that's for this morning but I I believe that's fresh from the Lord we need to get ourselves back into the line of the word of almighty God let him come on the scene and put a rejoicing within our heart for great things as our God done in this hour Hallelujah [Applause] Glory how much time do I have this morning brother window my clock is turning this the spirit is not seven spirits but one a church age book He will always be the same and act the same and the Seven Messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is a true church it will have the same very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost I I know but Canada is something that's a bad word but I don't know why it's a bad word by experience it will be a Pentecostal Church I don't know why people always get that mixed up with the denomination it got nothing to do with the denomination they only put a name on their Church hey man but he's talking about the true church The Living Church amen the bride church amen she's going to be the same as what the original church was and if we think we're getting it any other way then they got in we better go back and read the message again because we need an experience with almighty God you can say well I believe the message of the hour then let's see it manifest itself in your life if you believe the word of God shall through your life because that's a living God not some dead letter not something that's been interjected to make the people feel that although if I believe the message that means I got the Holy Ghost you'll know when you got the Holy Ghost because it'll change your life [Music] it will change your life it has to be the true holy ghost in our life then you watch your life line up with the word oh oh he's picking on me again in church so you say Lord if I need this this morning then father I want what you have for me this morning amen because I'm in the True Church of the Living God Amen and this church is the Living God is a Pentecostal Church I know people don't like to hear it but I'm going to tell it to them again anyhow I know people will be streaming this someday and they'll think I'm a fanatic but that's okay I feel good the way I am right here hey man I know what Christ's done in my life you know what Christ's son in your life amen and it changes your very thoughts and brings your thoughts into subjection to the word of God you can't have your thoughts changed back to the back to the things of God unless you got the holy ghost in your life that's why people are just actors in this day they can act for 40 years and all of a sudden what happened to him no Holy Ghost oh they had it on their flesh but they certainly did not have it in their soul Realm if the church is the true church they'll have the same spirit and word and acts of power they had a Pentecost by experience it would be a Pentecostal church and there will be tongues and interpretation of prophecies and healings God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has and that beautiful brother Brown says that as he always has Hallelujah and she will be unorganized in other words my headquarters is in heaven I know we all had quarters that's where my headquarters is Shorty's not here and he says three words here he says don't forget that yeah so it's something we need to keep in our minds kind of takes care of a lot of other things said here in first Thessalonians 1 5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but in power in the Holy Ghost and much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake amen so it's not in logos only for the letter kills but the spirit makes that letter come alive within our lives amen then it's no longer do's and don'ts it becomes your fortification amen and you willingly let's say willingly you willingly stand behind the word for you know the protection of it amen it's a protection of the word it keeps you protected I remember you a few years ago brother Wendell when he was back at our church I don't know if he remembers this or not he says he said if there's a Roaring River it has two Banks to him probably remember that but if you take the banks the way all you have is a stake and swamp a lot of people's lives are that way because they don't want nothing to keep them pulled them and tight here but if you have something that pulls it tight it's two Banks it allows the river to flows freely and when the river flows freely it puts all the junk out on the side amen everything that's not of God it moves out amen let's read this quote brother Jonathan things that are to be now then if it was hope you hope you're okay I I like to say in the message I like to keep in the message if Jesus was the fullness of God manifest he was the fullest of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth he was the manifested in flesh and was manifested in the flesh excuse me you were in him then because he was the word now I'm coming to us now here this morning and the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and doth Among Us the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him you were in him when he was on the earth you suffered with him and you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him and manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places amen already raised resurrected to New Life and sitting in any places in Christ Jesus oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally let's say positionally positionally placed in Jesus Christ now if we are those attributes of God and you watch how he says and now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by creeds we can all live by denominationalism we must let's say we must let's say one more time we must we must live by the word because the pride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word Bry and what is the word pride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creator denomination but a living Oracle let's say Oracle something that shines forth from something a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God display it to the World the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living and I say she is being expressed and she is here in this hour and we are living Oracles of God manifesting the word of God to this generation there won't be a lot of people be a few people oh amen but it will be a worldwide people living Oracles of God not dead articles of God something that's got some life in it something that's full of the Holy Ghost not afraid of the moving of the spirit I find the most some message places and that people are afraid of the moving of the spirit because they've never felt it [Applause] that's what makes them bind up they say what in the world is all this noise what in the world is happening in Pony Nation what in the world these people are out of their minds no they got their minds they got the mind of Christ in them they're accepted the headship of the word they realize they're the living bride they realize they're raising up [Applause] they realize who they are in the hour that we're living in Hallelujah brother Brown told us that there would be churches churches and Brides brides but there's going to church there has to be a real bride I believe we're part of that real bride [Applause] you know brother Brown in one service he was talking about buzzers and Eagles and one guy thought he was a buzzer the other guy thought he was an eagle it just depends where you what you're going to think amen I don't look on myself as no buzzer to look at myself as an eagle amen when I look at him I'm a part of the Bride I say Amen amen is there a real bride on the earth I say that's me hey man is she living in power that's exactly right that's in my life amen because the word of the Bride can we say this morning I'm the bride I'm the bride that's who we are we're the bride we can say look at that and say I'm the rapture amen I'm the rapture [Applause] you know when you were predestinated and this has comes to our our thoughts and when we were predestinated that means that God saw us from before the foundation of the world not to where we are right here but he sees us already in the millennium we're just going through the Dark Room of time when we start to realize that we are the bride that we are the rapture the Rapture won't be the same without you the Rapture won't be the same without me we're the rapture and one day it's gonna come into manifestation what God saw in his mind and we're gonna change our bodies to a new body it's gonna happen it's coming there's got to come a real bride he said that in 64 65 65 believe rising of the sun there's got to come a real bride I believe we see part of that real bride here this weekend amen we got part of it in Canada part of in Saskatoon grunthold was part of it in grinfo Manitoba part of it all over America part of it in Asia and all the other content is part of the bride of Christ a real bride who's in love with her with her honey the word of almighty God amen I I always think of it like this is that and when I got engaged to Sister Mara actually before that she would have talked to other guys I would thought what in the world's going on nowadays people get engaged and they got their cell phones they're communicating with guys and all kinds of stuff like what in the world is going on you should have your sight set on one person and you see that Spirit come into the message amen people don't communicate with God anymore they look over here they look over there they're looking at this and they're looking at that amen if you're in love with almighty God your love is his word hey man you can't get enough of it you can't get enough of this message hey man because you're with almighty God you're his wife you're his bride you're part of him I say that to our young people if you're looking at a young lady or young man quit speaking with other ones it's no wonder we have so much trouble uh I am going home in the morning for the window can fix it up when I'm gone that's the truth it's the truth we need to come back to the foundation if you've been over in that spot realize who you are sister Mara would have done that I would have questioned whether she really loved me or not that's we didn't have cell phones back then we had corded phones you got 15 minutes to talk to Kelly [Music] see I heard brother Merle this morning talking about his daughters my father-in-law has five daughters so he was trying to hide him too but it didn't work it didn't work we made sure we got him when they were young [Applause] ass just to make you feel better for what's coming next amen there's got to come one that's not just mechanics but Dynamics makes the church live moving the power of his resurrection until we get to that place what good does it do to fix up the car what good is it to polish it what good does it do to give it a face job or a facelift or simonizing job or there's no Dynamics in it no matter what no matter how much mechanics prove to be right there has ought to be a dynamic to make it work amen there's got to be something that makes it work that's right amen and I say this morning our the Dynamics to make the church work which causes the church to rise is here amen it's here if you're allow to be in your life it is here amen the age of God didn't leave the church and brother Branham he's still here amen and he's still hearing the power just like he's always been in the power before we're just realizing that he's here amen and I I say that we may not be able to see him physically with our eyes but we certainly can feel his presence I can certainly feel it up here this morning or the presence of the Lord amen if God is still here with us with brother Brown I mean it's not a problem here but it can be sometimes backward on that they think brother Brown has to come back to do this and brother but I'm about to come back to do that I look at her like this whenever I have need of is already on the tapes already in the word of God I better apply it to my life and when he does come back on the resurrection I'm not going to have to be taught and preached to and things like that we're going to be in a whole different dimension Hallelujah he's not bringing my new body Jesus has gone to prepare our new bodies [Applause] sometimes we get it out of kilter brother Ron says look at the carnal Church look where they're going further and further away look at their Spiritual Church shaking off all this little nonsense coming up in the spirit in the minority of course coming in the spirit but moving up to such a place until let's go up there to where the holy spirit will be right through it working its way ready to receive her Lord ready to receive her Lord amen I say the spiritual church is shaking off all this binding powers of formality and intellectualism and lukewarmness I would try to get amongst the people so let me catch my breath here for a while I'm not 27 anymore or 20 years old where's to shake all that all off lukewarmness in this age of is lukewarmness is everywhere you go to you gotta shake it off amen you go you got to bring it off it's Satan's design to make you feel lukewarm formal and Powerless amen if he could do his part that's what he's going to do if I can just get them they can come to church every service they want but just don't let them get in the spirit because I know if they get in the spirit then something something's going to happen we're going to have to report back to hell when something happened in Pawnee Oklahoma amen because they had five Services where the Lord came on the scene and people got delivered and we were up there to try to make them formal make them tired and lukewarm and stuff but they got a hold of the spirit of God anyhow amen and Assad came on the scene and did great things amongst the people changed lives of liver people amen why because they shook it all off you may say I don't feel like praising to God I say give a sacrifice a place and praise the Living God shake off those chains of formalism change I will try to find a salute formism come off your heart give a Thanksgiving a praise Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord we just shake them off it's not every day you say oh you you get up in the morning brother Kelly you feel like praising God every day if you're honest no you don't hope that's okay you say you a preacher you don't feel like that you just got to be with me Monday morning but you know what you have to do you gotta shake it off you gotta shake it off you say I know he dies for me I know he saved me I know the Miracles that happened Shake It Off knock on the church half world all right shake off a lukewarmness shake off instead of going to bed at one o'clock in the morning go to bed at a good time oh I'm getting myself in trouble right now you got to get yourself ready for church you think only the pastor has to get ready we all Gotta Get Ready we all get ready for good good about to happen Hallelujah why because you're ready to receive you're ready to worship God comes on the scene brings healings the Bible says as the word went forth the people got healed takes a preaching of the word bring our faith up receive it act on it glorify God worship Him see it brother Kelly everybody's talking about worship that's because we got to a place where we don't want to worship anymore we're afraid of the next guy around us forgettable who's or who's around you [Applause] the next thing he found himself on the floor with them you gotta shake it off amen we gotta shake it off we're the bride that's rising up in this hour amen Shake It Off people who want the moving of the spirit but I want it people want to put God in a box but I can you're not going to put God in my and I'm not going to allow God to go into your box people want five steps to living better when all they need is a good old-fashioned Pentecostal Holy Ghost Field meeting it'll make them live better you start hearing this stuff I just can't even believe a 10 steps to get out of pornography and all you need is to have the Holy Ghost in your life and have that devil cast out of you you'll get out of that all right I Don't Need No 10 steps you need one step that's a cow [Applause] then price will come on the scene how can we reduce the Gospel of Jesus Christ as such denominationalism and call that message certainly wasn't brother Brown's message [Applause] that's just once you got a devil on you and you need Deliverance pretty simple [Music] hope this is okay I hope I'm not being too bold but it's just in my heart this morning brother Wendell said I was a gentleman but when it comes to the devil I'm not too gentle that's one person I am hey man you got to recognize that you need Deliverance you need Christ to come on their scene I'll take it all out of your life it'll take the formality out of life it'll take all of lukewarm in the start of your life got to come to Christ he's the word the word tells us well we have need of shake those Spirits off bookstores that's why they make so much money nowadays Christian bookstores they got five steps for this ten steps for that 20 steps for this seven steps for that when all they need is a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting it'll save you a lot of reading and you can read your Bible after that hey Ben You Don't Need No Doctor docson we need Dr Jesus on the scene again that's what we need all this seed [Applause] hope it's okay brother Wendell it's okay you see where do you get that brother Kelly Mark 16. it's right in the Bible amen if you read your Bible you'll find it he said go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be down pretty simple and these signs shall fall they'll not believe in my name they shall cast all Devils they shall speak with new tongues right there if they take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall hurt them they shall in hands on the sick and they shall recover amen there's the formula amen it's not Dr Dobson he's not the formula it's the Holy Ghost as a formula it's the power of God that's a formula it's anointed man of God that are commissioned by God to cast out Devils as a formula Glory I think he liked that one God keeps his word for the manual God keeps his word he's faithful to his word the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise God will bring it to pass amen if we come with the right mental attitude it'll bring it to pass amen I'm just over one hour can I have a little more I don't know I might have to have a Part B or something like that [Applause] back home I said can I have some more time they all tell me afterwards are we going to say no you got four people that say yes but the rest of them you don't know right brother down the church I'll read this quotes in the fallibility of God's spoken word 56 he said when he come he come through a virgin God made his promise sure he stuck with his word every word of it had to be so he made it perfect because he was God and couldn't do nothing else he had to stay with it he said next the next thing he had to do the church had to be anointed and sent out before he could keep his promise he had to make a way for the church to be anointed and the church after Walking With Jesus anointing Jesus and had received power to heal second do everything and all these ups and downs and things that they'd had and yet walked with Jesus he know that he had to make a way to send his church out anointed the point is the anointing amen he sent them up to Jerusalem they went into the upper room and stayed there for 10 days and nights until suddenly there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind that filled all the house where they were sitting God made a way to anoint his church and to spread her across the ages across the Nations rather and today that same Mighty glorious church is marching on to Zion as she's moving up and down Anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost signs and wonders and Revival fires on every Hill everywhere he said it's not only in Chicago and I say not only in Pawnee but it's also to the uttermost parts of the earth amen it's not in the United States but it's to the Heathen lands and everywhere the Revival fires are burning a great sign and wonders are taking place the day is at hand and God has made a way of Escape he said to Joel and that day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh our young men shall see Visions upon my handmaiding and handmaidens and Maids while I pour out to my spirit I'll show signs in the heavens above flying sauces everything all kinds of Mystic signs in the heavens of of signs on the earth below there will be a sea of roaring a tidal waste breaking along Chicago and up down the place as great seas the roar a roaring men's Hearts failing amen if there's ever a time man it's hearts are failing Us in this day church amen men's Hearts failing perplexed the time distress between nations oh my is there a time of distrustment between nations amen the world has gone completely insane amen there's just nothing but disruption everywhere that you can think of it and it's Nation against Nation amen and he says and in that day the great anointed church and in that day the great anointed church has to rise to her power Jesus Christ has to come in when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it and today what science is doing all these different things and God's sending down Supernatural signs ashore to his church take your mind off all the things of the world and look up you're in the ladder now you're anchored between both the glory and Heaven amen a lighter has two ends to it amen one's Anchored In God the other one's Anchored In Christ and were caught between it with a great host of angels bringing forth ministering Spirits Supernatural gifts and things vindicating we're on our road we're marching up amen we've heard great preaching this weekend wonderful preaching this weekend preaching I told you who you are as a bride Purge in this hour to give it all to the gospel amen we don't we're not no hot fed plants we're going to be sprayed all the time amen we don't have to tell you good he spray on us all the time as pastors we have something in our hearts Beverly Hallelujah we've got to be the pride of Jesus Christ are we going to be padded and pampered I'm not the Bride of Jesus Christ not if you got the Holy Ghost [Applause] it's been powerful messages powerful messages brother Jonathan's message was powerful brother Sean's message was powerful the message just last night on Liberty was powerful amen getting rid of fear in our lives hey man that's what's stopping the church is fear hey man should I do this or shouldn't I do this or should I do that or shouldn't I do that let's bring it back to the word of God let's get our Liberty back in the house of God it's not time to go backwards It's Time to Go upwards it's time to move on Hallelujah we're on the road we're moving up there's a song I think brother Isaiah Brooks used to sing and one day I'm going to take a step toward my theophany just around the corner anytime we're going to be there I believe that with all my heart could be by morning we don't know could be the last convention that Pawnee has we don't know but one day it will be the last one I'll be honest with you I'd rather meet you all in glory than to meet you back here in Pawnee again I'll be honest with that everything you need God has given to us when we go from these meetings we need to have it in our heart I am the bride I'm moving up I'm not moving backwards I'm not giving in I'm not giving out I'm moving up it don't matter what so-and-so says I'm just moving up well I'll go back to my church and think that I'm crazy just let them think what you let them think what they want and if they think that too long maybe you have to take his decision amen the church is going up they're not going to pull me down nope they can call me what they want they can do what they want they can say what they want but I got some Dynamics in my life to prove that this gospel works and it's real you got it in your heart and be in the groom and the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can be manifested of the fulfilling of all the revelations and that they spoke of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is Flash of his flesh and bone of his bone and life of his life she has power of his power she is him that's who we are in this end time we are him no matter how much we can stand and prove the message to be right there has to be something that makes it go to work in our lives something has to make a go to work in our lives you need Dynamics and mechanics brother Branham said that if you had 100 octane gas you'd still need a spark we had a situation happen just recently yeah brother Jonas has a little boat and he gassed up a certain gas station we took it to our to our Cottage to our Lake and and to put her in the water and worked all over and worked pretty good for a dangerous soul and also just quit and so we checked it and we thought well what in the world's wrong with this thing checked well it's got gas check the spark oh they were Spark checked everything we couldn't figure out what's wrong about a new fuel pump for it and we thought well maybe it doesn't have enough fuel pump not powering up enough and we checked that and nope that's all working so we took it to a tech sometimes good to take it to attack sometimes it's good to bring it back to the Bible see if it's right or not and so the tech went through it put his computers on it did everything had to do on it and everything's there and it's got the octane the powers there everything's there yeah and so then he tested the gas and he realized that there was no octane in the gas even though he had put it in right fresh from a pump there was so much water in the gas it wouldn't even fire amen and there's so many people that are deluding this word of God it's no wonder there is not firing anymore it's such a deluding of the power of God and there's no there's no arcade left in the gas we didn't get the octane back in the gas because if you got spark you need something of a combustion arcane the man pulled all the gas out of the out of the vehicle put in fresh gas fired up just like that it's no wonder some places aren't firing they're pumping there's no octane in the gas why they've deluded the Gospel of Jesus Christ they took praise under their Church they took worship out of their Church they took times out of the church they took the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the church and all they're left with is a form they've got something that should float something that should work but it don't work I say go back to your tank and pull out empty out get Christ back in the tank let Christ come in your heart fire every time it'll work every time Hallelujah I thought it was just a just something that was just happened to his vehicle talk to the dealership and here they had a bunch of vehicles the same problem no octane left in the gas I thought my goodness Lord if that ain't what's happened to the church yeah they took the very Life of Christ out of the church oh they're turning it over but there's nothing firing because the gas won't fire so you can polish it up you can do whatever you want to but it's nothing but a bunch of hunk it's not worth anything what good is something that don't work yeah you think God wants a church that don't work nope sir he wants a church that works he wants a church that's on fire for him he wants a church that has Revival in their heart not just in special meetings but he wants it every time you come to service every day of your life he wants Revival in your life you say well I'm going to give it when I'm in the Revival of it's the spirit of God who's there no it's it's wonderful to be here but take it all with you and don't allow some man-made religion to pull it out of you and put their water into you or they're filling you up all right but there's nothing in it that's the truth right there I'm gonna cut this short everything you have needles are being paid for so you don't have to worry about it he part of he paid in paid a full sign on it you need a Salvation poof paid in full you needed healing who paid him full amen all your transgressions paid in full everything's taken care of there's nothing to fret about he hasn't forgot about you hey man he's going to go with you your freedom paid in full amen victory it's painful that's not your Victory but it's him living through you it says victory amen Joy it's all paid in full you see I'm a hard time having Joy I I say get up in the morning and sink joy unspeakable and full of Glory amen it'll deal it'll do something to your heart hey man you got something

and you think right you know what I thought that was a bad problem but you know what I got some joy unspeakable full of Glory something starts moving in your heart something starts moving the next thing you know your children feel that your husband feels that her husband and wife feel it something that's moving amen we don't have to be oh I'm a Christian I go to church and you know where are we going I don't know I I don't know I I don't think the lord loves me anyhow oh he loves you all right but what's your attitude toward him amen what's your attitude toward him peace is yours at an hour when pieces is seemingly escape the heart of people peace is yours peace is mine brother Adam said I shouted once thy dad's in the spirit he said don't he said don't take that no he said wait till the satisfaction comes the satisfaction portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in then those Joy bells are shouting and speaking in tongues that's the spirit will come you won't have to do it by music no you can do it anytime you're driving on the road you're working on my son-in-law brother Calvin he he puts up siding and he puts on eastross and stuff and he's putting his screws in he's being joy unspeakable and full of Glory next Wednesday night in church said you know I've been singing this song all day long I just got to sing it tonight amen why because something's in his heart something's in your heart doesn't matter where you're at amen we're not some dead Church we're not some old dead Wallflowers but we're the Church of the Freeborn we're full of authority and the power of the Holy Ghost we've had an experience with almighty God Amen something's in our heart amen the word has been made real to us the words be made flesh in your life amen you're now seated with him in
