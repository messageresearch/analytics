noil thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thine thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over amen thou art with me I want to minister this evening on the on a title

those in those titles for a very long time but uh get this one rejoicing in the Revelation that God is with me rejoicing won't you turn to the your neighbor and say I'm rejoicing in the Revelation that God is with me Amen brother William would be proud of me amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your love and your blessings upon Our Lives thank you for your anointing that we feel here today and these wonderful songs about your presence and the revelation of your presence Lord we we could never thank you a as we should thank you Lord knowing that we are living in a prophetic time and there's been no other time in history Lord where it says that the mighty Angel would come to Earth father we thank you for that Lord with such an an important uh message to us and we're just asking that you would be with us here tonight as we minister just ask Lord that you would help my thoughts and that you would just anoint my mind anoint my spirit and body but Lord let your word and your spirit come upon my soul lord that I could Minister only what you would want me to say bless all of your people here tonight we give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen we are living under the promise amen there in 1 Thessalonians the 4th chapter amen it talks starting there at the 13th verse it said I for I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so also them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with them for we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain shall become unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and we shall be ever with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words thou art with me I want to minister again on the rejoicing in this Revelation that God is with me we looked here as the psalmist depicted going through that Valley of the shadow of death I talked uh last Wednesday night of the influence of the earth and the amen how the death angel is striking amen and those that are without the sea of God Amen we there's there they they've it's just absolutely crazy amen and brother brandham would say in Watchman what of the night he said oh my friends listen to thus sayith the Lord if you consider me to be a servant it's just before the break of day amen just before the break of day and that's why this horrible Gloom is over the Earth it's just before the coming of the Lord Jesus there's no hope left left and nothing but his coming nations are against Nations they have fooled through God's uh laboratory until they got the power to blow one another up into Atomic ashes they're Wicked they're unreligious they're un Christlike and the only motive they have an objective is to destroy and they are inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men let me say in the name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit has sent as a Watchman on the tower and as people cry what of the night are you weary of this life are you wey of sin are you weary of funeral processions and sickness and ungodliness and on every hand has night been long and weary what of the night Watchmen he said the the morning cometh and he then brother brandham would say see the comfort and so as we look here this is the kind amen of of environment that we are in the destroying Angel is all around and and we can see the sickness there are diseases it seems like amen you there's no one safe anymore amen we're battling uh every kind of a disease and every kind even in the bride right here we amen we we are fighting sicknesses and our and and our and our bodies just seemed like amen they can't hold up like they used to hold up amen but in it all there is a Revelation that God is with me the promise was amen that in these days that Christ himself should descend can you say amen amen there in Isaiah 45 and22 it was one that brother Brenham loved to quote and he says look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else God didn't sin in this day he didn't sin uh amen uh H H help he didn't send an angel to help he didn't send uh amen didn't pacify us with a amen a bishop or a priest or a preacher or amen or even an angel but God himself has come in this last day the Lord himself shall descend can you say Amen you know it's no wonder that we can amen praise the Lord as we did here tonight because the Revelation is I am with you and I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen he truly has become our Salvation can you say amen amen I don't I don't know where you are or what you're facing or amen the situations that you're in but I I think the Revelation that Christ has come in this day should be something that is that means something to us to say that we are in the Rapture to say that we are in the coming of the Lord to say that he has ascended or descended with the shout and with the Trump and and with the uh with the voice and the Trump should mean something to us God wanted you to know that he's not just going to come someday and lift you off this Earth but while the Earth is in its greatest of climax When sin is all around he's letting you know that I'm first going to come before that body change I'm going to come with that shout message I'm going to come with an inspiration I myself I'm not sending an angel I'm not sending a doctor of divinity I am coming down I will be with you and I will lead you home well can you say man amen I as brother Harry was ministering this morning I believe God gets honor when men and women are counting the cost when they willfully choose to stand for him amen I believe that does something to the heart of God I I I believe when you stand and you choose to believe God in the in the midst of your sickness or in the midst of your Temptation and you stand for what is Right amen I believe it does something to the heart of God it brings God to a Amen to attention in your situation I believe that amen I believe it brings God to your attention whenever amen whenever you stand up for him and you take up for him and amen it brings God down in your place how many want God in your situation you remember amen the sister that uh you know she she she uh was was dying I believe of tuberculosis and and uh amen she had came and asked brother brandham to pray and the angel of the Lord said tell her amen that that she's going to die and he went up to her her her husband and and uh uh uh her daughter and said listen she's not going to live and amen and so um some of the people that she worked for the girls that came by to see her and amen and she said uh she had told him she said you know I I I I I'm preparing to die amen the prophet I asked him to pray and he says it's God's will that I'm dying and and th those oh those people those women just really got on to her and says what does that man have to have to say about anything and and and what do you mean by that and and just really ridiculing brother brandham and call him a fanatic and a fake and amen and she stood there and she says listen I've been around that man way too long I've seen what God done I've seen the Miracles I've seen his visions and they come to pass When God Says something through brother brandom I believe it and and there uh uh although they were just giving her a hard time about that time the angel of the Lord appears unto brother Brandon and he says you go and tell miss y'all remember her name what was her name I want to call her Bell but I I don't think it was Miss Bell I amen uh uh but he says you go and tell her that I heard what she said to those women and you let her know that she will live and not die God heard amen someone that took up for him what can you say amen amen I I don't know what y'all think the the pillar of fire is but I believe the pillar of fire is is none other than the Christ the god of eternal glory lives in that Pillar of Fire amen God come in this day it is low amen he cometh it the the the the promise was he shall descend in in the in a shout and the voice and the Trump amen God has when he come on Earth he always has to have someone to declare him and God sent a prophet raised a prophet up lived in that prophet it was God living among us I want to tell you today amen the second stage of the Rapture is the voice and the final voice to the final church will be a people that God is living within no other AG has had this promise as we have had this promise can you say amen amen I remember the three Hebrew boys I amen I I thought of this when God came down personally amen he was so moved by what he saw these three Hebrew boys as as as brother uh uh as as brother Harry was mentioning this morning amen and brother brother Bram catches in here and he says and you know all the time there's something going on the earth there's something going on in the heaven amen I can see him he stood he let's look at him a minute I can see him sitting on his throne oh my his Priestly robes all around him I can see coming to his right a noise what is it let's call it Gabriel the great Archangel amen run up to his side pull his sword and said master have you looked down in Babylon three True Believers are meeting there meeting therein have you have you beheld them I've obeyed you all uh uh since uh amen I've obeyed you since you created me he says let me go down there I'll change the scene in just a few moments and I believe he could don't you yes I believe he could have amen that big sword pull amen David seen him uh Joshua seen him when he was crossing the river amen I am the captain of the lord of the host of the Lord and I I've seen that sword drawn and he said Lord let me go down master and he and I can hear him say Gabriel you've been a good Angel since the day I created you you've obeyed me but I but I just can't let you go I can see Gabriel put his sword back into the sheath and stand to his side and oh my everything in heaven obeyed him that's right all but the heart of men they don't want to obey him they don't want to believe him but look coming to his left there comes another angel look at him he's he God has ministering Spirits see Angels amen I believe on on this one there uh uh one right here not far he says uh he says what is his name is W uh wormwood bitter Waters he says I can hear him say oh master I have you look down to Babin let me go down there this morning you gave me the keys to the analum destruction and I poured waters on the earth amen worm word uh has it controls all the Waters of the Earth the Bible says and there he says I'll go down there and wash babyon off the face of the Earth he says I believe he could have done it don't you yes sir amen oh he said Master look down there but I can hear him say one word you've been a good Angel you've obeyed me and broke up the Springs of the deep and so forth and destroyed the world in the uh uh in the days of Noah but I just can't let you go I can see one woodworm taking his place again and standing at attention have you considered another angel said and he said yes I've been watching them all night long he says oh brother if he was considered about those three he's considered about the 3,000 here tonight and I just want to say he's considered about the amen the 4050 people here this evening he says oh brother amen His Eye Is on the Sparrow he knows right now what you have need of he knows why you've come to this meeting tonight I can hear him say I can't let you go you know fellas because I'm going to go myself oh my I can see him rise amen you think I'm crazy don't you but I'm going to I'm going to call him holy are you're going to call me Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well go do it amen notice I love him I owe my life wrapped in him I I see nothing but him I can see him rise from his throne and the garments drop down around him and set out there amen he gets out there and way back over in the North Country I can see a big Thunderhead and I can see him come amen say come here amen oh my I can hear him say East Wind West North South come here everything Minds him amen that's right I can hear him say go out over there and get under the the Thunderhead and roll it over here and here comes East North South East Winds and go under the big Thunderhead and here comes a turning up at the side of the throne and I can see him I can see him step off on that excuse me amen oh my say winds I'm going to drive you like horses this morning I'm going down into Babylon I can see him reach up and get a hold of the zigzag lightning with his hands and pass by the tree of life and pick up a branch amen and they made their last step trusting God's word and about the time they stepped in there was the son of man standing by their side Hallelujah yes sir with a palm Fanning away even with a hot breezes down talking with them when Nebuchadnezzar opens the door how many did he put in there he said three he said well there's four and one looks like the Son of God and he's the same yet yesterday today and forever and his powers cannot fail oh can you say Amen his powers cannot cannot fail amen God oh when God comes on the scene for his people he comes on the scene I tell you what I'm about to choke up here amen I I I think the devil don't want me preaching about this great one who is among us hallelujah amen he came down now he wasn't going to let the Angels he wasn't going to let W woodworm he wasn't going to let any of these other angels He says I'm going to come down myself when the world was coming to its worst here in Le osia right at the end of the world God says I'm going to come down myself I'm not sending a preacher I'm not sending just an angel but I myself am going to come down oh can you say amen amen why would why would God come down in this last day amen because he's your Shepherd he's the Good Shepherd and he will never lose one of his own and God knows that this world is fixing to burn up he knows that the sin amen that uh that that that this world is under judgment he knows that it's got amen it's got to be judged it's got to be purified it's got to be but God says I've got men and women down there on that Earth that I have got to reveal myself to well glory to God so he says amen I want you to comfort yourself with these words amen for the Lord himself somebody say himself shall descend with a shout with a voice voice amen am with the Trump can you say amen amen what did Brother brandom say the the three-pole purpose of God is amen if you remember the first one it's the revealing of himself if you remember the second one it's the preeminence in his body amen and then the number number three is the taking away taking us back to Eden can you say amen amen what was God's purpose for coming in the first place the scripture says it was a shout what is the shout it is the revealing of God in a body here on the earth that's right amen what was the voice it's the preeminence of the Bride of the word in the bride and of course the Trump of God will be the resurrection now I want us to just you know let me just stop here for a moment amen since uh uh I got choked up anyways I might as well just stop here for a moment so I I want you to look and I think showed you in the past amen the three-fold purpose yes sir hallelujah amen purpose of God all right and then we've got the Rapture I want you to look at these amen you've got the you you've got the three and both of them right Hallelujah and then I'm going to put down here the seven seal what is the seventh seal the coming of the Lord amen all right don't be laughing at my writing all right that's also in in in three three stages all right so y'all got that the three-fold purpose of Christ the three-pole purpose of God the revealing okay Hallelujah in flesh now this is what God's promised to do in our day I want you to catch me now y'all Y y'all just stick with my thoughts here for a moment the Revelation that God is with me that God has been in heaven God's been in heaven for all of these years but right at the most evil time the the when Sodom is coming to its climax he says there's going to be the revealing of the son of man just like he was in MZ amen when God created a body and God came and ate among so when God revealed himself in flesh amen we understand that was the prophet Ministry the pillar of fire come to Earth to declare I am with you I'm talking about your Good Shepherd Amen brother Brandon ain't the Good Shepherd amen the pillar of fire was the Good Shepherd and he was living in a body of Flesh just like yours now what was his purpose for the revealing amen so that he would have preeminence Hallelujah preeminence I I'm not even going to spell that right Amen in the church Allelujah all right so it was God now this is what the Rapture is all about this is this is what the Rapture is I I want you to repeat with me one more time the rejoicing in the Revelation that God is with me the revealing God showing himself declaring himself in a body right Hallelujah God showing the devil that my people are not just going to be snatched out of here but they're going to defeat you in every way before they leave so it's God revealing himself in a pro that's the sh amen that's the shout now here it is it's all the same thing what's the first seal or the seven seal it's the revealing of the book Hallelujah all right so the the three-fold purpose revealing of Christ in a body the shout message declaring to the world brother bradam says my Ministry is to declare he is here are y'all catching me what is what was the amen what the three-fold purpose of the seven seal or the three-fold uh the unfolding of the seven seal the revealing of the symbols right amen the preeminence in the church amen which is the voice the second stage of the Rapture amen which is what the church is the final voice to the final age under her Prophet messenger god in other words God Liv living himself through her are are y'all are y'all understanding now now I want you to catch that and then of course amen this over here amen was the catching away amen taking us back to Eden so I'm just going to put catch away amen what is this this is the Trump this is the catching away when the dead in Christ shall rise amen it's the catching away well glory to God the three-fold the three-fold purpose of the seven seal y y'all remember that the the the the third one the third one was what it was the unknown tongue that came to brother Brandon remember that he said the Seven Seals in a three-fold mystery amen he said I had the I had the two Revelation but the third came in a in a uh uh in an unknown tongue he says and we'll know that right about the time of the coming of the Lord amen no man will know the time or the hour of the catching away can you say Amen now I want you to catch this that the the the reason I I I I wanted to just bring this in here tonight is because to let you know God has declared to us through the scripture that he will be with us in this generation now if he's with us in this generation it's not just because amen we can uh uh you know we we can take the uh uh it's not that we can uh what would I say the uh uh you know uh learn and you know just become a a giant mental um you know a mathematician or a great Bible scholar no God is declaring his Mysteries to us showing us who he is who we are Amen in this Valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil because God is declaring listen I've known all about this church all through those Seven Ages I have watched them amen as they were thrown in the lion I watched them as they went their babies were snatched up amen and killed and I watched them all down through these ages amen as a as Satan has tried and tried and tried but I want you to know this age I'm coming down in flesh I'm coming down with an open book and I'm declaring to you who you are what you are amen and you are going to rise above it amen all right amen are you understanding Hallelujah so I did I did I finish amen the revealing of the Mysteries amen there's the revealing of the Mysteries and of course then what is the next thing the creative word okay hallelujah amen let's put here the creative word brother brandom called that amen uh Hallelujah brother brandham had it five times right had Wright was the product of the creative word amen squirrels product of the creative word now I want you to catch put these things together Amen in this coming of the Lord in this Rapture season it's God revealing himself in bodies having preeminence in the church that's what the shout and the voice is it's the revealing of the Mysteries giving the book to the people so that they can take that book digest that book go amen are you with me amen now and of course amen the so we can we can see amen what God has has done and and how that amen we can we we we can we can just go down through there so Christ himself the angel of the Covenant is with us it's God having a plan all along God didn't move God didn't necessarily move you remember uh the the four horse riders amen and there and and and you remember the the the anointings there is the the lon amen and and and and you can see God working in all three or all four of these anointings in our lives in our church amen sometimes your faith is like a Lon faith that Lyon faith will just stand right up amen and you'll just you're going to stand up against the evil or the sickness or whatever and you declare it and amen and and and and and and and they just back off and it the these are miraculous times amen and then there's the other times to where amen you God gives you you're anointed there amen with that calf anointing you go through sicknesses and you don't understand why amen you pray and you read and you you fast and you do everything and it just doesn't seem like amen God comes on the scene amen but God anoints you to to walk through that there's other times where amen it's God uses that man anointing brother bradam says God uses uh a doctors to heal you amen and you you'll go to doctors and and and uh amen and they'll mend you and and that's that's part of it but then there is also that eagle where God just snatches you out of it and I and I want to tell you there's where we are as far as in the church ages amen we are at the Eagle anointing where God is snatching us out now the angel of the Lord amen the rejoicing the rejoicing in the Revelation in this Revelation amen God is not here to hurt you God is here Amen to show that he is with you I I I want you to really catch that because he's here to qu Quicken the promises to you now once again once again I I I hope I'm I'm making some sense the presence of God has come down he's descending he's descending the anointing is coming upon the open Mysteries it's the it's an anointing that is coming it's an inspiration that is resting upon you to believe everything and anything that God is saying concerning you right I think we got to get that we we got to get that to where there's there's no fear no matter where you are you going to there's an inspiration on the earth to overcome the enemy brother brother Brandon would say Amen as as as people would come amen up on the platform and as they' as they'd walk up uh to to to to the platform he maned he said now come on up a little bit further he says now what you feel he says that that warm feeling you feel he amen he says now that won't hurt you that's him yeah amen he says uh one place he says you're aware something's going on you're wondering what it is now that won't hurt you that's the angel of the Lord another place he said now something's going on amen he said now that won't hurt you that's just the Holy Spirit coming near you see the picture of it a while ago the pillar of fire did you ever see it another place he says now that won't hurt you you're in the presence of something you realize that's just his presence now he's here do you believe me to be a servant you do with all of your heart and then he says another place do you believe me to be a servant are you conscience now you're standing in the presence of something besides your brother for it's moving between us now that light it's a feeling on you that you haven't felt it's a warm feeling of welcome so what what what am I what am I trying to say it's the shepherd yeah in the Valley of Death that is coming to inspire your faith oh I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not making my point good enough here tonight hallelujah hallelujah I what what I'm really desperately wanting you to see here is that this angel of God we see the pictures we've we've seen we've heard it it's here there's a inspiration on the earth and it's a time of release when the book is open it releases you Amen to overcome your enemies there there if you you you remember in Daniel I believe the 12th chapter and it says and all that shall be found written in the book shall be delivered he said the book's going to be sealed but when the book's unsealed all that's written in the book shall be delivered Amen in this day God's not wanting you to go down into the ground and defeat amen when the book is open all that's written in the book shall be released you will there will be a faith released there will be an anointing released there will be that you will become the voice not because you're learning to recite anointing on the word is in your heart and you become the Living Word you got to expect that Hallelujah if you understand amen that that faith in that word the creative word of God will the creative word of God is what what what what created everything around us the word god having faith in himself God having faith in his own word and when he spoke it it was just as good as done and brother bradam would say Amen it might have been a thousand years before the that the sun was ever came into fru but God never one time went back and Revisited it he already spoke it he knew it was going to come to pass he was the word and when that word is released to us in this second phase of the Rapture it is a it is a confidence God is with me right for thy rod and thy staff does comfort Meen that's the reason why Isaiah 59 and 19 says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun amen and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion which is the church and unto them the turn uh from transgression and Jacob sayith the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with him sayith the Lord my spirit is upon thee my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy s there is an anointing here to make that come to pass brother Brandon would say this in the mystery of God revealed he would say now you see the seals when he was in his meditor work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get the book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him now you say now that's just some mumble jumble brother random don't even make sense there all that's in this book would be him okay Hallelujah all that's in this book would be him yes sir right if you can't see Christ from kber to kber you got to go back and read it again all that's in the book would be him but then brother Brenham says all that's in the book would be him for that is the believer I thought it was him in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh in this last day the bride has come to her completion this is a word bride all that's in the book has been testifying of your coming and when the Revelation comes that he is in me bride form right the cover the first the first part is the is the revealing of the Mysteries it's the declaring it's the revealing in flesh it's God saying say I'm no longer in the heavens I am now in a body that I have redeemed it's got to be a revelation now if not Hallelujah if you don't have that Revelation you'll never it's uh I believe I brother Sean that was saying something uh or amen it was it was one of the preachers saying something amen over this week or the last couple weeks I've heard somewhere amen he said I want you to look at the three fa Hallelujah here's the three fa he said now the Jews Faith Jared says if you come lay hands on my daughter yeah then then she will live the Gentile faith says if you just speak the word I'm a man of authority you're a man of authority I say go and he goes come come I know you have author you just speak the word and my servant will live those were incredible fa but both of those individuals were needing something outside of themselves Jesus had a totally different faith on now he did not have something outside himself he says I am my father are one that's right he knew who he was God reside he had faith not in somebody coming and making him something he had faith that he was the word in flesh Hallelujah now the others were saying if you would come and lay hands another one if you would speak Jesus stood there he didn't have to look somewh else he said peace be still and the winds obeyed him brother Bram says if he has faith for himself and knew who he was in that Revelation how much more in the second phase that God the bride should have a revelation of who you are in the unveiled mystery all that's in the book would be him for that is the believer amen for the words in the book and the word is him now what do we do hallelujah what what is required of me do I have to do I have to do anything no no I have to obey the inspiration that's on the earth there's nothing outside you there is nothing outside beside you for you are the bride coming of Christ right if you understood you're the bride coming of Christ then you don't have to you don't have to go when when you can't get a hold of the preacher and you can't get a hold of Mama and you can't get a hold of no one else you can realize that I am this phase I am the final voice she under her Messenger will become the final voice to the final Age come on now I will the words of God has never failed in the hearts of the Believers Never amen is that right amen so all you have to do today what are what what is what is my requirement the shout has come the book is unveiled so what is my requirement how how do I become that voice by eating the book amen believing chewing eating this book and you become the Revelation and then Satan is as scared as you as he was of Jesus Christ he's as scared of you I don't care if you feel like you're the the lowest in the church he's as scared of you here tonight amen as he is of Jesus Christ why because this is the bride coming of the Lord Jes Jesus amen well glory to God well I tell you what when Elijah was so overwhelmed and and and and and and you man he he was so weary after he killed all the prophets and Jezebel's after him and there he is under the juniper tree and amen and and and and the Bible says that God come down amen and baked him a cake amen and and fed him and whatever he ate amen he was able to go on that Journey on a 40-day journey without any more food well praise the Lord and sometimes we get weary but I want to tell you he's here in word form right I I oh glory to God I I you know I just just just just thinking about it right now amen at at how the Revelation when opens it up to us when we understand amen and you look you can look through the scriptures and and how that once the Revelation strikes once that Revelation strikes something amen it changes your attitude about it if if you if if you don't know what you're supposed to do or who you are on the job it's hard for you to really fulfill your duty but once you know what God wants done with you and you know that the power of God is residing in you you don't have to question it anymore amen I am the devil's worst nightmare see it's because it's not a mental thing it's divine revelation you've ate the book The Mystery is opened up now if if you're looking now remember the man we when we when we really stop to think of this Christ has come he's not just coming to snatch you he's not he's not let the devil no he's not saying okay you've tormented them long enough and now and now I'm taking them out of here there's going to be a people that he is coming down and he is revealing himself to and through and the ones that the devil has tormented and tormented and tormented is catching a revelation and through that Revelation Satan is starting to lose his grip on you because Satan's found out that he thinks that you're just a reject and you're not a reject God has got an eternal purpose through you and when he comes poking on you he's poking on God and you are defeating the devil through that God faith in you it's it's not it's not something external at all you're not waiting for someone to Amen to to do something special to to build you up you God's Building built you up God's built you up are y'all understanding that you are special because Christ has come taking your side standing amen not by you but in you and saying this one is worth Hallelujah is worth everything to me amen now when you when you when you look at that then it's Christ Living his word believing his word doing that through you now brother Bram would would would talk about the uh woman the shunamite woman amen now she had prepared a place let me just say this she would she had prepared a place for the word she prepared a place for the prophet y'all remember the shite woman amen he would walk through and so she asked her husband hey can I can can we build a a little room on the side of the house amen when he comes through that that we can uh that we can you know uh let him rest she prepared a place for the word then what took place because she prepared the place for the word then the word came back and opened her womb she had never been able to have a child but because she prepared a place for the word the word opened up her womb she was a stir woman amen and she gave birth to the promise yeah he had asked what can I do for this woman and his servant says well I've asked her and she she he says says can I can I mention something to the king can I do this that other the woman says no we don't I don't want I don't want anything and the servant says she's never been able to have a child she's Barren and the word of the Lord says h i and and and I'll give you a child well according to the time of life she had her child the promised word now brother Brandon would put it this way he'd said when the woman realized that this inspiration was on her what inspiration she seen the word she received the word she built a place for the word when this woman realized that this inspiration was on her she obeyed exactly because she know it was in harmony with the supernatural you say what are you talking about brother brandom I'm trying to base your faith on a level with God being Almighty Supreme all powerful and omnipotent he hasn't changed his nature doesn't change my nature might change yours might change but God's nature never changed he's still Jehovah God that created heaven and earth and all the powers in his hands he's still the same Jehovah tonight he's almighty God he can do all things and if he can't do all things he's not almighty God inspiration tells you that reasonings will say it's not so but inspiration says it's so inspiration from the soul and not the mind she obeyed the [Music] inspiration what has been poured out what is taking what is that Mighty Angel what is taking place what has caused you to see this open what has what has God done when he has unveiled it's the supernatural right theologians couldn't do that theologians didn't open up the book brother brandom didn't open up the book he wasn't smart enough if the theologians weren't smart enough brother brandham wouldn't been smart enough and we can't put anything on brother brandham saying it was his smarts he was wise he knew the Supernatural and he knew who he was and he obeyed the inspiration and he became a voice of authority to the seventh Church age Oh Glory to God and when the inspir it didn't come it was not it was the inspiration of God coming through that prophet and when it is received you can in you can see that this is a supernatural move it is not anything that that that that that that brother brandham had to do with well come on now we had all kinds of denominations this this is not a denomination this is not another group this is not another sec this is not another idea this was God this is God himself descending yeahall like he promised the inspiration is here when the book is open like it's promised you can't make that up that's scripture when the mighty Angel descends with an open book hands it to the seventh angel messenger he in turn amen is declaring to you to go to that Supernatural angel don't accept it from Brother Brenham accept it from the angel now you're going to have to hear the voice you're going to have to hear the Revelation through the mouth of that Prophet but it did not come from the prophet it's a supernatural move and when you come and you take that and you Embrace that it's the same as deity speaking you've got it in you I believe you can believe for your children I believe you can believe for your spouses you say brother wend it just it's just impossible you've got to either accept that this message is a natural man with a natural message or it's a supernatural god with a supernatural message and you're going to have to accept these things that brother Brandon brought to us he brought all three of these to you to let you know this is already taken care of so so you got to mark that out this has been revealed through that prophet that's already been revealed The Voice is not a B brother B says what we need in Jeffersonville is thousands of Living Voices thundering out and humility and Sweetness in other words believing Hallelujah the supernatural God that came in that Prophet on Mount Sunset and appeared to him and and told him to go back and open and and and declare the the preacher on the Seven Seals what did he do he called all well praise the Lord the shout was fixing to come forth and they all gathered right there in Jeffersonville Indiana and every night God God would come down and unveil another mystery another mystery another M well Hallelujah why because there is a people who is not going to have a magical catching away it's a supernatural Soul hearing being empowered by a supernatural God through super Supernatural words and they are standing up in faith believing yes sir amen she obeyed the inspiration when the inspiration was on the earth now read you a last quote here he said now no matter how religious you are he said now we see we're close to the coming of the Lord you've put off baptism of the Holy Ghost you may have relied upon some sensation maybe uh something that you've you've done that Satan can impersonate you can't have the real spirit in you to go all the way into the promises of God how can a man that claims to have the Holy Ghost deny one word of the Bible being not right you can't do it no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your names on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is the word manifested you'll see the message of the hour power because it's the holy ghost that does it but there has to be something to light that off inspiration to strike you if you pour water on the ground on the ground on the ground and there's no seed in there to strike it well it'll never bring forth anything there's nothing to bring forth that is that's the the only the elect will see it now this is the reason the inspiration struck inspiration ain't for those guys out there the inspiration is for and the devil tries to tell you he tries to he tries to get you to looking at yourself your situation your Humanity God don't want you looking at your Humanity God wants you to look at the supernatural inspiration that's on the earth the seed's already in you Hallelujah he says now the elected of God seen it in Noah's day Moses time Jesus time Apostles time Luther's time Wesley's time Pentecostal time because that was the seed that was on the earth when this inspiration poured out now while the in this inspiration is poured out to gather the bride together it's only those that are elected will see it Jesus says I thank thee father I thank thee um Hallelujah thou has hid this from these things from the Wise Eyes of the wise and The Prudent revealed to v such as we learn now inspiration has to strike that inspiration has to strike it and when the inspir inspiration struck him that that did it he had it then now we find out comes a time that these crisis when we press right on into it now you look around the day look at the condition we're living in aren't we living in the Sodom modern Sodom and Gomorrah hasn't the world come come back that was a gentile world that was destroyed then by fire didn't Jesus say in Luke 17 it says uh uh the 28 29 30th verse as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed what is revealed it's a secret made known it's a revelation it's to reveal to make known a secret now these things has been hid throughout all the church ages and now being revealed and made known are are are you catching what I'm saying now are are you are you understanding what brother brandom is is is is really really trying to to to hint at or to point at amen you are anointed the under the fifth seal brother Bram says he says the martyrs down Through the Ages they suffered terribly what were they they were under the inspiration the spirit of God the power now don't forget this church you Brethren that's on tape I want you to examine this how could men do anything else besides the power of God that's been released to them he said I'm going to set a box up here to to represent that if God sends a spirit a certain Spirit among them that's the only thing they can work by is the spirit that works among them and we'll prove that by the history of the church then the opening of the seals the powers that's let loose exactly the church responds to the anointing and can do nothing else Hallelujah am I am I making any sense to you at all tonight huh Hallelujah he's here he's here to do what to Quicken the seed of rapture that lays in your bosom and he's saying though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen when he's talking about the angels He says now he says uh he says now they don't know what it's all about scientist trying to everyone's got a picture of it or anybody got a picture of it uh a cloud 26 Mi high in the shape of pyramid seven angels represent in there brought back to you and brought you the word of God under the inspiration tells you these hours that we're living in amen he goes on down and he says that Pillar of Fire that called them out and led them from the promised land under the anointing of a prophet a pillar of fire that they could look at amen or are are you understanding aren't aren't you proud for that aren't you thankful for that hallelujah amen you've got to obey it in that season now now watch it watch what happens hallelujah amen I thought I okay this is the last last quote all right amen so now the word the word's come all right all right the word had to come the Revelation had to come catch the Revelation I'm no longer oh Church you're not a wannab be we're not biting our time God came with a specific inspiration with a specific Revelation that he's not not giving to anybody else but you and he wants you to believe that word because you're going to find out Amen brother brandham someone would ask him please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bride he says well he said well it's just a change of our bodies now he said you you you you know what I mean when I say that I I don't mean to be sacrilegious I don't mean to say ours I I I mean to say or I don't mean to say this church I I mean for to every believer Abraham was looking for a promised son that was promised him now y'all catch this and that's it's going to this quote will tie up everything else I hope that I've been saying and the church is looking for the promised son the bride is looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to Sarah and Abraham their bodies had to be changed is that right they she was too old to have a baby she had no milk veins in her breast her breast was dried up her womb was infertile she was sterile she couldn't have the the baby her heart was too old to stand labor so what happened God changed her back to an old to a young woman and he did Abraham the same way because his body was good as dead and he had to change their body in order to receive the promised son we cannot receive the promised son that's promised us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin so potentially it's in here what is it the word promised before the foundation in the world all around there that's this only reflects the negative and and will it will that will reflect the positive the word the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that is in you the body will materialize around that word so once he unveils who you are now you've already been you're already the elect you didn't know who you are they didn't know who they are but once the once the the the the veil's been taken off the word hallelujah we found amen that's got boogers in it amen so the wor so once the veil you guys are making me preach hard I I I need someone to help come on up here once the word the word was bailed so when now when open the Bible now once the word the veil came off the word the veil came off the okay see she's always been the word so when the prophet's message came the shout was to declare he's on Earth he's on Earth and when it was when it was unveiled when the book was revealed it revealed the Beautiful married any so the only boyfriend you get is your daddy maybe so so this has now but but why I sit in a church with an open book yeah and not and not realize who you are we're not beg you are the book when the book was released you were read the Bible remember seal Daniel put put that up Daniel 12 And1 praise the Lord at the time at that time Michael Michael shall stand up for thy people let's see well we need we need to go back and read the other okay so so first of all he told Daniel seal up the book seal it up okay but now he says time and he tells him he says you're going to go to the way of the Grave he says he at that time when the book is released now he saying at that time Michael shall stand up at the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people there shall be a time of trouble such as never was a nation before and and shall be delivered every one that should be found written in the book so when the book is unveiled when the book is released the people are released with the book right it's the time of Deliverance for the people in the book and not only a Deliverance for us but all of those who are in the grave throughout the Seven Ages amen when the veil comes off the book and you and me who are alive the in the second phase amen preeminence of that word understanding I'm the one amen when we come to the real revelation of who we are the brother BR says when the church knows who she is what what did he say the Rapture will take place so it's so important to us for us not to just be religious say Lord if there's ever a time let me obey The Inspirations amen Inspirations on the earth in this the great Shepherd is with us in this dark Valley in this Valley of the shadow of death yeah thou art with me and I say Thou Art In Me amen amen you're not a preacher don't you even think to be a preacher amen God bless get get get Haven up Hallelujah the revelation of who we are that's the seals amen that's what has been opened up and it show us how Satan's fought he's fought Satan thought Satan thought he could kill but he's not been able to right but the veil has been taken off can you say amen amen now so this is us this is where we are right here this is where we are all the way down amen and if you can understand amen when I say the Crea word the seventh seal that the the the third pools under that seventh seal which is that creative word opening of the word amen and and we can go into a lot there's a lot more to this down here but I wanted you to see that in all all three of these instances there is that word yes in us not not saying that we're going to be something special it's not saying we're going to be out but the Bible did say eat the book for thou must prophesy come on that doesn't mean we're going to go around laying hands on the sick and prophesying we be come go ahead you want to you want a sure word of Prophecy you want a your word if you want to prophesy and it come to pass just exactly just say what the seventh Angels said prophesy am believe what the seven things will believe take that book for yourself all right and that new body that new body is forming around that word that has been released to you in this day come on Hallelujah it what can you say Amen sorry to everyone on the internet amen hallelujah praise the Lord what a wonderful day what a what a wonderful time so so I I I I'm I'm I'm here and we've got so much sickness and we and there's so much and and and I now I got to say the one man Ministry is over if we're looking for some big somebodies to come up and make our faith good and strong that's not going to happen as far as prophecy is concerned there was amen one to an age and he's King now back in the other ages I must say back in the other ages other great men were raised up there was uh there was finny there was um uh Wigglesworth there there there there were plenty of those guys that raised up that had great gifts and and and and and were incredibly gifted men who could who could speak and raise the dead and and and that was all through that they were through those uh uh you know those those Church ages God would drop upon those men those those certain men and and they were very gifted I don't see I I just don't see that happening today I see a bride Ministry I see not someone coming and propping you you up or propping me up I see a a the bride standing up to her position and claiming her own victories because there's a faith not in a big man there's a faith inside little [Applause] me can you say Amen there's a faith inside little you and you're big you're big you're you've got the genetics of God the word resides in you just obey that inspiration there's no telling oh my there's no telling what God's going to do through you I don't care how sick you

nation he's wrecking the world and these guys don't know nothing about it our leaders know they they are they are puppets but there's also another inspiration God give me a revelation that he is with me give me the Revelation that the mighty Angel the angel of the Covenant the great Pillar of Fire the logos himself is with [Music] me Hallelujah I I didn't bring the other quotes but because there there's a lot of quotes where brother Bram said Jesus had to believe who he was he had to believe he could not believe what others said about him they were saying you're Joseph's son they they they just but Jesus had to believe the inspiration you have to believe who you are and they tried their best to take Jesus out they didn't have cell phones and that kind of thing trying to take him out in that day but it was religious man and religious things trying to and there and they ended up killing him of course we understand it was for it was so that you and I could have Redemption but it's been
