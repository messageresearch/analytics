[36:31] that he saved us and called us with a
[36:35] holy calling
[36:37] amen it says according to his own
[36:39] purpose and Grace which was given us in
[36:44] Christ Jesus before the world began but
[36:47] has now made manifest by the appearing
[36:49] of Our Savior Jesus Christ who has
[36:52] abolished death and hath brought life
[36:55] and immortality to light through the
[36:59] gospel now I also want to look here in
[37:02] and read one scripture here in Romans 8
[37:05] and 11.
[37:06] laughs
[37:08] Romans 8 and the 11th verse is a very
[37:11] familiar passage of scripture here but
[37:13] if the spirit of him that raised up
[37:16] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[37:21] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[37:24] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[37:28] spirit that dwells in you amen I want to
[37:34] speak tonight on the power of life
[37:36] we thank you for your love today
[37:39] thank you for these wonderful songs of
[37:41] worship
[37:42] thank you for the anointing of your holy
[37:44] spirit that we feel tonight
[37:46] and we're just asking Lord that you
[37:48] would Minister to us and Lord as we come
[37:52] here this evening maybe we're a little
[37:54] tired maybe we're feeling sickly Lord
[37:57] I pray that the Holy Spirit would just
[38:00] come real special
[38:02] that the anointing of God would just
[38:04] settle down upon every one Lord that is
[38:08] present and those that that can't be
[38:10] here tonight I pray Lord that you would
[38:13] be with them and heal them and comfort
[38:15] them Lord
[38:16] but Lord as we're here tonight we're
[38:18] asking that the life of the Holy Spirit
[38:20] would be here in a real special way and
[38:23] that you would minister to our hearts
[38:26] Lord as we yield ourselves to you father
[38:29] we love you with all of our soul in
[38:32] Jesus name we pray can the Church Say
[38:35] Amen
[38:36] and amen God bless you you may be seated
[38:39] here this evening amen the power of life
[38:43] is what I want to to speak on for a few
[38:47] moments this evening I begin to think a
[38:50] little
[38:51] as um man uh someone had had texted me
[38:56] earlier uh today and and had asked about
[39:01] you know what is what is the uh why do
[39:05] we worship on Sunday
[39:08] instead of on Saturday on the Sabbath
[39:12] and
[39:13] and as I begin to explain a little bit
[39:16] uh and and share that amount of the Old
[39:20] Testament Sabbath was a type of the New
[39:24] Testament rest in the Holy Ghost and and
[39:28] and going through those things I I begin
[39:31] to you know just sort of uh uh look back
[39:35] on the uh or on the law of Moses and
[39:39] actually the law of Moses is amen it can
[39:42] be divided up although Christ did not
[39:44] divide it uh or or Moses and when God
[39:48] gave it to Moses he did not divide it up
[39:50] into three sections but amen it can be
[39:53] divided up into the ceremonial law the
[39:56] judicial law and the moral law there man
[39:59] this is where God was was coming down
[40:02] and his whole purpose was was trying to
[40:05] reveal himself to the people and and to
[40:10] um and and at the same time to bring sin
[40:14] to the Forefront the sinful nature to
[40:17] the Forefront so that they could see
[40:20] that in trying to live the law of God
[40:24] they in themselves could not live the
[40:28] law and thereby they would see
[40:30] themselves as failures they would see
[40:33] themselves as Sinners they would see
[40:36] themselves without any kind of ability
[40:38] to be holy to be righteous to be that
[40:44] one with God and so amen the you had the
[40:48] amen the ceremonial laws there was the
[40:51] uh it had to do with the priesthood and
[40:53] the sacrifices that amen uh for for sin
[40:57] and uncleanness their ceremonies of holy
[41:01] days and feast days and and and and all
[41:04] of these things all represented these
[41:08] were all types of what God was going to
[41:12] do through Jesus Christ
[41:15] so as as I was as I was sharing with our
[41:19] sister today amen the the uh the Sabbath
[41:24] was simply a part of that ceremonial law
[41:28] amen and and but and though it gave you
[41:32] physical rest and that you were to rest
[41:35] on that seventh day amen there was no
[41:39] rest for this there was no rest for the
[41:41] soul there there there was nothing there
[41:44] because the soul was under the task
[41:47] master of sin and death it was under the
[41:50] as under the the the Taskmaster of Satan
[41:53] and though you could rest on that on
[41:57] that uh uh uh you know Saturday and it
[42:00] was to be a day of rest for you but it
[42:02] was also to be holy unto the Lord you
[42:05] were not allowed to work on that certain
[42:06] day you were not allowed to do certain
[42:08] things and it was to be a a day of
[42:11] worship but when the Holy Spirit comes
[42:14] Christ came
[42:16] to give us our rest Jesus says come unto
[42:20] me all you that are weary and that are
[42:23] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[42:26] take my yoke upon you learn of me and I
[42:30] will give you rest for your souls and so
[42:34] we we can see that now there were also
[42:37] if you we were to just look at the seven
[42:39] feasts amen uh I just real quickly there
[42:43] there was there in in Leviticus the 23rd
[42:46] chapter it goes through the Passover
[42:48] amen and the Passover was a feast that
[42:52] that was to uh remember the last plague
[42:57] that hit the Egyptians hit in Egypt and
[43:00] so when the death angel was to uh pass
[43:04] over those who had the blood over the
[43:09] the the the doorpost or over the little
[43:11] and also on the door post and and so
[43:15] Israel real was to slay a lamb they were
[43:18] to take hyssop amen a big bunch of
[43:20] hyssop which were weeds in their hands
[43:23] they were to reach down and and and dip
[43:26] dip it in the blood and they were to
[43:28] apply it over the doorpost and then they
[43:31] were to apply it on each side of the
[43:34] door amen so it was to be on the lentil
[43:36] and on each side of the post and you see
[43:40] it was a type of Christ Our lamb amen
[43:45] that was to come John the Baptist says
[43:47] Behold the Lamb of God which takes away
[43:51] the sins of the world so we find that
[43:54] when today when the death angel is
[43:57] striking the blood of the Passover Lamb
[44:01] keeps a death
[44:04] Eternal death away from the believer can
[44:07] you say man amen there was also the
[44:10] second Feast it was the Feast of the
[44:12] unleavened bread amen this was a seven
[44:14] day Feast that's done started on the day
[44:17] following the Passover and this was a
[44:20] type of the seven Church ages and so
[44:23] that that this would be amen uh that
[44:27] they were you know to uh take this bread
[44:30] and haste and that they would not have
[44:32] uh a time to to for the yeast to rise
[44:36] and so uh uh uh uh they were to eat it
[44:40] and bake it and haste and they were to
[44:42] eat it in haste right along with their
[44:44] lamb and and so it was also a a type of
[44:48] Amen no sin the amen no no yeast in the
[44:52] bread no no sin in in your life to keep
[44:56] those things out so you've got to be
[44:58] pure and honest with yourself I believe
[45:01] there in first or First Corinthians five
[45:04] and seven it says Purge out those uh
[45:06] perch out there for the old leaven that
[45:09] ye may be a new lump as ye are
[45:12] unleavened for even Christ Our Passover
[45:16] is sacrificed for us therefore let us
[45:19] keep the feast not with the old leaven
[45:22] neither with the leaven of malice and
[45:25] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[45:27] of sincerity and in truth Jesus says
[45:32] that he is that bread from Heaven Can
[45:35] you say Amen so so we find that the
[45:38] unleavened bread that was a type of
[45:42] Christ so I want you to catch the point
[45:44] here everyone
[45:46] everything of the Old Testament were
[45:50] types of Jesus coming in the New
[45:53] Testament amen he was that Passover so
[45:57] we don't have to keep the Passover
[45:59] anymore because Christ is our Passover
[46:03] Lamb we don't have to do uh keep the
[46:07] Feast of unleavened bread amen because
[46:10] now it's a heart of Purity and sincerity
[46:14] before God Amen now the third Feast was
[46:18] the the Feast of first fruits and this
[46:21] this year was one of uh uh three Jewish
[46:25] uh uh uh uh fall or harvest Feast that
[46:29] was intended to give honor to God and I
[46:32] want you to catch this because amen now
[46:35] I want you to now catch this because in
[46:37] the 14th day of not sin this was the
[46:39] this was the first day of the feast this
[46:42] was when they would kill the Passover
[46:44] Lamb amen then the second day would come
[46:47] amen it it would be the 15th day of
[46:50] Nisan and this was the Passover of which
[46:54] the death angel was to would pass over
[46:57] and then the 16th day which is the third
[47:00] day amen would be the celebration of the
[47:04] first fruits now I want you to really
[47:06] catch this here tonight because you look
[47:09] at Jesus now well first of all let me
[47:11] just tell you what the first fruits were
[47:12] amen it was the one the first fruits was
[47:15] the one to raise up the first it was the
[47:18] one that had matured and come into
[47:20] maturity and and it was plucked up and
[47:23] waved over the people and so amen so it
[47:27] was Jesus was was killed on on the exact
[47:32] same day did you know that Jesus was
[47:36] killed on that 14th day of Nisan he was
[47:41] in the grave he was in Hell carrying
[47:44] away the sins your sins Amen to back to
[47:48] Satan and on the day of firstfruits Amen
[47:53] this was the 17th day of nice or the
[47:56] 16th day of Nisan Jesus rose from the
[48:01] grave as the firstfruits of all of the
[48:04] Old Testament Saints
[48:06] amen now that's just beautiful Jesus
[48:10] fulfilled every one of those types of
[48:15] the Old Testament amen he was God's
[48:18] Feast he is God's Feast he is God Amen
[48:22] that come and fulfill took your place
[48:26] paid your punishment so that you could
[48:29] have eternal life now
[48:31] then of course we've got the uh the
[48:34] Feast of Pentecost and that's what I
[48:36] want to deal with for a few moments
[48:37] tonight we also have the Feast of the
[48:39] trumpets and you've got the the day of
[48:42] atonement and you've got the Feast of
[48:44] the Tabernacles and of course amen uh
[48:47] just just real quickly the day of
[48:48] atonement amen they were to take they
[48:51] were to take a bull and then they were
[48:53] to take a goat and they would slay the
[48:56] bull and the goat and then they would
[48:58] take they would take another gold and
[49:01] this goat was would would take it would
[49:05] call it was called the scapegoat and it
[49:08] would take the the sins of the people as
[49:12] they slayed the one goat they would
[49:15] allow and let the other goat and go free
[49:17] and they would uh they would actually
[49:20] drive them drive that goat from the
[49:24] congregation and they would drive it
[49:26] away long ways away it was and it was a
[49:30] type that cried Christ fulfilled Christ
[49:34] died but Christ also he was our
[49:38] scapegoat he carried our sins mine and
[49:42] yours not just out into the Wilderness
[49:44] to die a miserable death alone with no
[49:47] water and no food but he took our sins
[49:50] all the way to hell
[49:53] he took our sins he was our scapegoat oh
[49:57] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that see
[50:00] Christ carried our sins so that you and
[50:05] I could go free amen now the Feast of
[50:09] the Tabernacles if you look at the Feast
[50:10] of the Tabernacles it was it was a
[50:13] celebration that followed the day of
[50:15] atonement
[50:16] at where people would come out of their
[50:18] homes and they would live seven days in
[50:22] in a temporary structures amen they'd
[50:26] come out and live in tents for seven
[50:28] days and and this was this was a a
[50:32] commemoration of of of what God brought
[50:35] them out of in the in the Tabernacle or
[50:38] or in the in the wilderness for 40 years
[50:41] and and how that they just you know uh
[50:44] uh uh they were just vagabonds they
[50:46] didn't have homes they lived they lived
[50:48] in tents they didn't which was a type
[50:51] this was seven days talking about the
[50:54] church amen or the world actually
[50:56] Humanity going on for almost seven years
[51:00] of of uh uh of of of of no permanent
[51:04] place a man to where you uh uh you you
[51:09] you you you're born and you die you
[51:11] these Tabernacles right here we've been
[51:14] on the earth for six thousand years we
[51:16] we're going to go in the millennial
[51:17] Reign for another a thousand years which
[51:20] is seven days but it was a type that
[51:24] after the Feast of the Tabernacles we
[51:28] would go to our permanent dwelling place
[51:31] no longer living in these tents no
[51:34] longer living in these bodies that were
[51:36] going to Decay but we would be living
[51:40] eternally in a body that'll never die
[51:45] that'll never perish anymore where there
[51:49] is no sin where there is no amen
[51:53] pulling us one way or the other we will
[51:56] be eternally with God can you say Amen
[52:00] isn't that just incredible how that how
[52:03] that God is uh how the Lord was so
[52:07] accurate when he uh these These Old
[52:11] Testament uh types were so accurate with
[52:15] what God is doing in this this day until
[52:17] we can figure amen uh just with with a
[52:20] hundred percent accuracy what God has
[52:22] done
[52:23] now like all these other Jewish feasts
[52:26] that I've just mentioned the the Feast
[52:28] of the Tabernacle or the Feast of
[52:30] Pentecost is is an important one because
[52:33] it foreshadows the Messiah amen it for
[52:38] Shadows Christ's coming but it also
[52:42] Shadows the life of God coming to the
[52:46] church now and and I just want to to uh
[52:50] just just share a few moments not going
[52:52] to keep you long here tonight but you
[52:54] see each one of these are very important
[52:57] because they are foretelling of what
[53:01] Jesus Christ would do in the Plan of
[53:04] Redemption now once again Jesus is
[53:06] crucified as the Passover Lamb did he
[53:09] rose from the grave at the Feast of the
[53:14] uh first fruits now the exact same day
[53:17] that they had celebrated all of that
[53:19] time he raised from the dead on the
[53:22] Feast of the first fruits and then after
[53:25] he was on Earth for 40 days the
[53:28] scripture says he was on Earth on 40
[53:30] days amen
[53:32] amen and then he told his disciples as
[53:35] he was ascending he says I want you to
[53:37] go to a Jerusalem so they went to
[53:40] Jerusalem and 10 days later the Holy
[53:44] Ghost came it was poured out
[53:46] now what is Pentecost Pentecost simply
[53:49] means 50. amen that's what Pentecost is
[53:52] is 50. so from the so from the date now
[53:55] this is this is this is the way they've
[53:57] done it in the Old Testament
[54:00] from the from the day that of the
[54:03] atonement from that day on 50 50 days
[54:09] later would be the day of Pentecost it
[54:13] would be the Feast of Pentecost and when
[54:15] we find out that when Christ had raised
[54:19] for up from the dead 50 days later here
[54:23] come the power of the Holy Ghost that
[54:26] isn't that just to me that's just
[54:28] wonderful to see how accurate God was
[54:31] doing and how that J Jesus fulfilled
[54:35] Those Old Testament prophecies can you
[54:38] say amen amen so so now I want you to
[54:42] look here
[54:43] for a moment as we as we think about the
[54:47] Feast of Pentecost now we know that the
[54:51] other Feast that they had they it was to
[54:54] be of unleavened bread and that sin uh
[54:57] the the the the leaven represented sin
[55:00] it also though Jesus says it was the
[55:03] doctrine of the Pharisees he says and
[55:06] you've got to get rid of the doctrine of
[55:08] the Pharisees amen if you're going to
[55:10] walk with me the Pharisees Doctrine is
[55:13] the leaven and it leavens the whole a
[55:16] little bit of Leaven and it affects the
[55:18] whole lump
[55:19] but yeah in the day on on the Feast of
[55:22] Pentecost
[55:23] they were required to take the to take
[55:28] the firstfruits to take that which had
[55:31] come first combine it together
[55:34] knead it together with leaven and they
[55:38] were to make two loaves
[55:41] of leavened bread
[55:44] now this was the this was what they had
[55:47] to do at Pentecost
[55:49] now
[55:51] there's a lot of theologians and I've I
[55:53] I've looked I I've I've done a lot of
[55:55] studying on it to find out what the why
[55:58] the leavened bread a lot of theologians
[56:00] want to say that well the leavened bread
[56:02] simply means that that that Christ
[56:05] Christ's body was going to be a sinful
[56:07] body Christ was going to live in a
[56:09] sinful body you and me you you and I are
[56:12] sinful and he's going to live in us but
[56:14] I just I I sort of have a hard time uh
[56:17] with with that
[56:20] I believe and I I and and and I as as we
[56:25] look into these things here amen I
[56:28] believe that it is the life
[56:31] of God
[56:32] within the church
[56:35] living his life and affecting the whole
[56:39] church now
[56:41] I think we can prove that here in
[56:43] scripture here this evening as we as as
[56:46] we look at this because I'm not too sure
[56:50] and I I you know asked I've I've
[56:52] actually when you when you look at these
[56:54] things here and and um uh I've you know
[56:57] checking with other ministers well what
[56:59] do you all thinking and uh uh I you know
[57:03] I I as I was talking to brother Tim prit
[57:06] and um uh he he had he he had really
[57:10] brought some light on on on this on this
[57:13] life that the Holy Spirit was the life
[57:17] of God coming in that there are good
[57:20] leaven and there is bad leaven there is
[57:24] 11 that will puff you up into in into uh
[57:28] a sin and Malice and hatred but the Holy
[57:33] Spirit can come in and and and give that
[57:36] life to you amen and bring life to the
[57:40] power of God within your life can you
[57:43] say amen and Sue we as as I'm as I begin
[57:48] to look amen I I want us to to look
[57:52] remember the Pharisees Doctrine was was
[57:56] called caused by a yeast that was a wild
[58:00] yeast it was it was amen that doctrine
[58:04] that uh uh that was you know brought sin
[58:08] but Christ's life into the church is
[58:12] creating a man raising us up into a
[58:16] Rapture raising us up into a higher
[58:18] Faith raising us up to believe God's
[58:21] word and not to doubt God's word but to
[58:24] believe God's word
[58:26] amen now now when the power of the Holy
[58:30] Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost
[58:34] What did the what did uh uh Peter say
[58:38] these are not drunk as you suppose but
[58:42] these are filled with that new wine
[58:47] now amen now when the Holy Ghost came it
[58:52] was called Nuance it was not called
[58:54] grape juice
[58:56] it was not called Hallelujah and we
[58:59] don't use grape juice when we come we
[59:02] use wine why because it is symbolic of
[59:07] the Holy Ghost the power of Life grape
[59:10] juice has no life in it there's no
[59:13] fermenting power to it
[59:15] but wine has the fermenting power can
[59:20] you say amen amen now now what makes
[59:24] wine have its keeping power what makes
[59:26] wine amen have the stimulation of
[59:29] Revelation what is it it is the effect
[59:33] of the yeast that is inside that wine
[59:38] that makes the difference and I want to
[59:40] tell you it is the life within the word
[59:44] that brings the stimulation to pass well
[59:48] glory to God in other words it's not a
[59:51] dead tradition Jesus says that the
[59:53] letter killeth but the spirit gives life
[59:57] he says my words are spirit and life
[1:00:03] well praise the Lord and when the yeast
[1:00:07] Life of Christ amen which is the holy
[1:00:10] spirit comes into that word it creates
[1:00:13] power it creates stimulation it creates
[1:00:18] an anointing yeah you can raise your
[1:00:19] head back up you're fine and I'm still
[1:00:21] in the Bible hallelujah amen it creates
[1:00:24] the anointing of God to come back and we
[1:00:28] can stand there and say ha I've got an
[1:00:32] anointing upon me
[1:00:36] Hallelujah now what did Jesus say
[1:00:40] they're in in now I'm not going to hold
[1:00:42] you along tonight so I'm going to really
[1:00:44] I've got a lot to say but I I just I'm
[1:00:46] going to try to just bring it in here
[1:00:47] real quickly
[1:00:48] Jesus made clear that the Holy Ghost was
[1:00:51] going to do what
[1:00:53] the Bible says that out of your bellies
[1:00:56] shall flow
[1:01:00] Hallelujah Rivers
[1:01:03] of Living Water Living Water hey what
[1:01:07] now I want you now I want you to look
[1:01:09] there there in John 7 and 38 he that
[1:01:11] believeth on me as the scripture had
[1:01:13] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:01:16] of Living Water and this fake key of the
[1:01:20] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:01:22] should receive John 4 and 14. whosoever
[1:01:26] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[1:01:27] him shall never thirst but the water
[1:01:29] which I shall give him shall be in him a
[1:01:32] well of water Hallelujah
[1:01:36] bringing up bubbling up into everlasting
[1:01:40] life
[1:01:41] now I want you to catch this now
[1:01:43] everything all of these other feasts
[1:01:45] that I've just mentioned these other
[1:01:47] feasts were pointing to Christ
[1:01:50] Christ
[1:01:53] this one is pointing to the life of the
[1:01:58] Holy Spirit
[1:02:01] within the bread within you within me
[1:02:05] what does the two loaves represent amen
[1:02:08] are the prophet taught us at the two
[1:02:09] loaves represent the Gentile and the Jew
[1:02:12] what what has taken place the Holy
[1:02:15] Spirit within us giving life to us
[1:02:20] making us well he's no longer just the
[1:02:24] bread of life you become the bread of
[1:02:28] life because the words that you're
[1:02:31] receiving from him is not just a man
[1:02:34] falling on deaf ears it is now coming
[1:02:37] through the life of the Holy Spirit
[1:02:39] pulsating
[1:02:42] oh that's the reason why we don't ever
[1:02:44] want we should never just listen to the
[1:02:46] message or just read a a messenger just
[1:02:50] read the Bible we should always be
[1:02:53] praying God make sure the life
[1:02:57] is there to make it to live
[1:03:00] can you say Amen now amen this new wine
[1:03:04] these are not drunk and brother Brennan
[1:03:06] would say now the old intellectual the
[1:03:08] intellectual the old lady they gave her
[1:03:10] a facelift and she's still the same old
[1:03:12] woman the old man they gave him a
[1:03:14] facelift he's just the same old man
[1:03:17] I'll turn a new page on news years and
[1:03:20] I'll I'll start new life I'll throw away
[1:03:22] my pipe and then pick it up the next day
[1:03:24] that's just you it's it it it it isn't a
[1:03:28] facelift it's a birth that the church
[1:03:31] needs you can't preach this in the old
[1:03:35] church she won't stand it Jesus said in
[1:03:39] Luke about the fifth chapter about the
[1:03:41] uh wine in about the wine in in the
[1:03:45] bottles
[1:03:46] he said you can't put new wine in Old
[1:03:49] bottles or they'll perish and actually
[1:03:52] what he is brother Branham is referring
[1:03:54] to is Matthew 9 and 17. it says neither
[1:03:57] do men put new wine into Old bottles
[1:04:00] else the bottles break the wine runeth
[1:04:03] out and the bottles perish but they put
[1:04:06] new wine into new bottles and are
[1:04:10] preserved now brother Brandon would go
[1:04:12] on he would say that used to wander me
[1:04:14] that used to startle my boyish mind when
[1:04:16] I when I used to think and how the
[1:04:19] bottle would perish now what we call
[1:04:22] Glass amen what we call Glass being old
[1:04:25] it's it it makes no difference because
[1:04:27] it's glass but in Jesus time he was
[1:04:30] speaking of the bottle that they used
[1:04:32] then which was made out of animal hide
[1:04:34] and when it was new and young it just it
[1:04:38] had just been tanned it was flexible and
[1:04:41] when it got old it got dry now many of
[1:04:45] you people know how what hide uh what a
[1:04:49] hide is when it gets dry it gets old and
[1:04:52] dry and shrunk up and real hard now you
[1:04:55] put new wine into that it hasn't got any
[1:04:57] life in it it's going to burst it's just
[1:05:00] like trying to preach the baptism of the
[1:05:03] Holy Ghost in the real genuine power of
[1:05:06] the resurrection and trying to place
[1:05:08] that before the people and when you do
[1:05:10] what happens in if you put it in the new
[1:05:14] one has got life the new one is still
[1:05:19] fermenting
[1:05:21] there's your yeast amen I never knew
[1:05:24] that they used it that you would call
[1:05:26] yes I guess sister Leo would know amen
[1:05:28] but they called the fermenting power of
[1:05:30] wine yeast it's the leaven of that wine
[1:05:34] now he says all the new wine is still
[1:05:37] fermenting I hope you see it the new
[1:05:40] life is fermenting the new wine is still
[1:05:43] fermenting and if it's in a new flexible
[1:05:46] bottle where the oil of the animal is
[1:05:49] still in the skin when the new wine goes
[1:05:51] to pushing out the skin will stretch
[1:05:53] otherwise when the Bible said Jesus is
[1:05:56] the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:05:58] and forever the new skin will say amen
[1:06:00] and we'll stretch with it and when the
[1:06:03] new one said that the uh that's the
[1:06:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm the
[1:06:07] life of God that's working in you and
[1:06:08] the new skin will say amen and we'll
[1:06:11] stretch out to it when the new wine says
[1:06:13] the Holy Ghost is sufficient for our
[1:06:14] healing today the new wine will will say
[1:06:17] will stretch itself out the wine being
[1:06:19] the word and when it when it says that
[1:06:21] the new bottle will say amen and stretch
[1:06:24] out to it see but what will the old
[1:06:27] bottle do days of Miracles has passed
[1:06:29] and is gone uh what what what are we
[1:06:31] doing what are we accomplishing he said
[1:06:34] the old bottle will perish and the wine
[1:06:38] will perish with it it's almost like
[1:06:40] casting your Pearls Before Swine you try
[1:06:44] you turn and it under and you you
[1:06:47] do you see it Jesus doesn't anoint
[1:06:50] ministers to preach the gospel just to
[1:06:53] have it to return back to him void but
[1:06:55] he expects you to receive the word and
[1:06:57] in receiving the word be ready take that
[1:07:01] old cowhide that that's been living over
[1:07:03] there in the formal condition and swap
[1:07:06] it for a sheepskin that's flexible to
[1:07:09] the word of God and everything the Bible
[1:07:10] says you'll say Amen can I hear an amen
[1:07:14] but it must come from the Bible for the
[1:07:18] new wine only ferments wine it's only
[1:07:21] that it only verifies the elements
[1:07:24] that's in there the yeast only presses
[1:07:27] Force the bulb of the alcohol which
[1:07:30] makes it a bursting profession as the
[1:07:33] yeast bursts its little bubble to make
[1:07:35] it more perfect gives it a better taste
[1:07:38] to give it a better substantial holding
[1:07:40] it it it to make it more stronger to
[1:07:43] make it where it can't sour amen can you
[1:07:46] say Amen to that you see it is it is God
[1:07:50] taking you and me and putting his life
[1:07:55] within us
[1:07:57] on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:59] now it was on the day of Pentecost for
[1:08:02] all of those hundreds and hundreds and
[1:08:05] hundreds of years that they would take
[1:08:08] the two loaves of bread
[1:08:10] and it had to be it had to be a leftened
[1:08:14] bread
[1:08:15] and wave it before the Lord on Pentecost
[1:08:19] it was on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:22] 50 days after Jesus is raised from the
[1:08:25] dead on the day of Pentecost is when the
[1:08:29] Jew and the Gentile begin to receive of
[1:08:33] the life of God it was then that the
[1:08:37] cloven tongues of fire come upon the
[1:08:41] Believers
[1:08:42] so Jesus wasn't talking about a sin
[1:08:46] being in the church at all he's talking
[1:08:48] about the life of God
[1:08:52] the atonement had been made Hallelujah
[1:08:55] Jesus had been raised from the dead and
[1:08:58] now God's very life has come to make you
[1:09:03] the bread of eternal life well that's
[1:09:06] glorious
[1:09:07] amen now now what is this what is this
[1:09:10] yeast amen it says the yeast munches on
[1:09:15] both the fructose and the sucrose then
[1:09:17] it expels the alcohol along with CO2 the
[1:09:20] same happens with the sourdough it is it
[1:09:23] is a yeast that munches on the fructose
[1:09:25] and the sucrose in the dough and makes
[1:09:28] the CO2 gas that makes the bread rise
[1:09:31] yeast is actually a life a living
[1:09:34] substance that is put into the grape
[1:09:36] juice or the dough that changes it can
[1:09:39] you say amen I I just I love that
[1:09:41] definition so what did God do to make
[1:09:46] new wine
[1:09:47] what did God do he put his very own life
[1:09:54] into his church
[1:09:57] making them
[1:10:00] oh praise the Lord now it was new
[1:10:03] bottles now we we understand that that
[1:10:06] brother Branham taught us that there has
[1:10:07] to be a new spirit to receive the new
[1:10:10] the new birth so there had to be God
[1:10:13] taking every one of us and and putting a
[1:10:17] new spirit within us to receive his
[1:10:21] Spirit within us that's actually there
[1:10:23] in the book of Jeremiah amen I'll give
[1:10:27] them a new spirit and then I will put my
[1:10:30] spirit within them so God has to take us
[1:10:34] and he hang up we can't even get along
[1:10:36] with ourselves half the time amen you
[1:10:39] and I can't get along with ourselves or
[1:10:40] each other lots of times praise the Lord
[1:10:43] amen but you see when the Holy Spirit
[1:10:46] comes and creates that something within
[1:10:49] a heart that is longing for God that is
[1:10:52] loving God that is one Hallelujah what
[1:10:55] he's doing he's taking the Stony heart
[1:10:57] out and he's given you a heart of Flesh
[1:10:59] so that you can receive the things of
[1:11:01] God that's the reason why you children
[1:11:03] when when you come and your heart is
[1:11:05] longing after God and and you wonder
[1:11:08] well well you know maybe some some of
[1:11:10] you might think well I'll never receive
[1:11:11] the holy ghost or maybe God don't want
[1:11:13] to give me the Holy Ghost the God
[1:11:14] wouldn't give you that little special
[1:11:16] something in your heart that's so tender
[1:11:18] that says I want you I want your life I
[1:11:22] want to oh I want your Holy Spirit God
[1:11:26] put that in your heart he created that
[1:11:29] there for you
[1:11:32] then you take that into that upper room
[1:11:35] so you see the 120 they didn't have to
[1:11:38] go into that upper room but when Jesus
[1:11:39] left as he's ascending he's saying I
[1:11:41] want you to go to Jerusalem and stay
[1:11:44] there until you be endued with power
[1:11:47] from on high
[1:11:49] you're gonna have some water coming out
[1:11:52] of the belly you're gonna have Rivers
[1:11:54] bubbling up it's not just going to be me
[1:11:57] I'm leaving
[1:11:59] but I'm sending the Holy Spirit back and
[1:12:02] the Very life that made me who I am is
[1:12:05] going to make you who you're going to be
[1:12:07] oh Hallelujah so what happens we find
[1:12:11] that the that the yeast the Holy Spirit
[1:12:14] coming down upon us
[1:12:16] and it makes it fermented and there's
[1:12:19] something that begins to Crave for more
[1:12:21] of God can you say man hallelujah amen
[1:12:25] it says it can only be put in the new
[1:12:27] Pentecostal bottles got out 120 of them
[1:12:30] gathered in the upper room after he had
[1:12:33] oiled him by his word and it softened up
[1:12:36] and had renewed and got the old
[1:12:38] Orthodoxy out of them and all of the old
[1:12:41] system and God had 120 bottles laying in
[1:12:45] the upper room with their necks up and a
[1:12:47] funnel on top and the Holy Spirit began
[1:12:50] to raise and these bottles got so alive
[1:12:52] until they begin to run outside
[1:12:54] preaching the gospel bouncing from place
[1:12:57] to place one jumped on a stump and said
[1:13:00] this is that right back with the word
[1:13:02] this is that which was spoken of by the
[1:13:04] prophet Joel then it shall come to pass
[1:13:06] in the last day saith God I'll pour out
[1:13:09] my spirit my new wine in my new body he
[1:13:13] says what a Revival that they were
[1:13:15] having that's God's order here comes a
[1:13:18] couple of bottles bursting by and
[1:13:21] they're laid an inflicted man and when
[1:13:23] this afflicted man touched the hand of
[1:13:24] one of these why his Affliction left him
[1:13:27] and he got he got some of it and began
[1:13:29] to leaping and praising God and running
[1:13:31] into the temple shouting and glorifying
[1:13:33] God that's God's order not a big school
[1:13:36] with a degree but a living acting
[1:13:41] experience of the Holy Spirit now not
[1:13:44] fanaticism but the real genuine Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost put into action you may see it may
[1:13:52] you see it is my prayer
[1:13:56] can you say Amen
[1:13:57] so this this leaven
[1:14:01] you can have the old leaven the the 11
[1:14:04] of the Pharisees and the leaven of the
[1:14:06] Pharisee now again Jesus says the 11 was
[1:14:09] the doctrine
[1:14:11] well if it's the doctrine of the
[1:14:13] Pharisees and it was a wild yeast how
[1:14:16] much more is the doctrine of the Bible a
[1:14:20] living yeast
[1:14:22] where the Holy Spirit can come in anoint
[1:14:27] his word in you
[1:14:30] Oh Glory now 11
[1:14:34] it'll it'll cause malice and friction
[1:14:37] and can you say Amen but the Holy Ghost
[1:14:41] when the Holy Ghost fell on the uh uh in
[1:14:44] cornelius's house amen and there they
[1:14:47] were this when it was coming to the
[1:14:49] Gentiles and and and and and and and and
[1:14:51] the Bible says that Peter had got up and
[1:14:55] began to declare amen the words of God
[1:14:58] and what had happened and exalt Jesus
[1:15:00] Christ
[1:15:01] all of a sudden the life of God
[1:15:05] came out of the eternals and entered
[1:15:09] into the Cornelius
[1:15:12] and all of those that dwelt among them
[1:15:14] and they become so full of the power of
[1:15:21] eternal life
[1:15:22] that they begin to speak in tongues now
[1:15:25] now there was not there was not Jews all
[1:15:27] around like before where they were
[1:15:29] hearing everyone in their own language
[1:15:30] amen this was just that personal private
[1:15:33] language that they had between them and
[1:15:35] God they were speaking in that what took
[1:15:40] place
[1:15:41] it was the very life of God that was
[1:15:46] energizing their mortal bodies
[1:15:50] I think here tonight amen this waving I
[1:15:54] believe there is a waving that has taken
[1:15:56] place in this last day
[1:15:57] it's a waving and I believe this waving
[1:16:00] is not just amen a little of ingredient
[1:16:02] of of of yesterday's grain but I believe
[1:16:06] God's got some loaves of bread here
[1:16:08] tonight I believe God's got some loaves
[1:16:11] of bread some people that have
[1:16:12] experienced the power of that yeast the
[1:16:16] power of that eternal life the it
[1:16:19] changes you it makes you like what it
[1:16:23] does if you you become a you've become a
[1:16:26] representative of that life that is
[1:16:30] within you
[1:16:32] well glory to God it's no wonder we can
[1:16:35] speak in new tongues it's no wonder amen
[1:16:38] that we can believe in miracles that's
[1:16:39] no wonder sometimes well the word of the
[1:16:41] Lord is being preached we just get so
[1:16:43] excited and stimulated within our souls
[1:16:46] what is it it's that life it's not a
[1:16:48] dead letter but it's a living letter
[1:16:50] that is within you
[1:16:53] Hallelujah now you couldn't just offer
[1:16:57] grain
[1:16:58] in this feast
[1:17:00] amen the leaven was to take the whole
[1:17:03] lump
[1:17:04] it would leaven the whole thing
[1:17:06] the doe and the leaven would be so
[1:17:08] intertwined
[1:17:10] Hallelujah Jesus on the inside working
[1:17:13] on the outside oh what a change in my
[1:17:16] life that song I'm falling head over

[1:17:35] this one's sitting on the front row and
[1:17:37] this one's sitting on the second row and
[1:17:38] amen but now we're all in there we've
[1:17:41] been baptized into one body well praise
[1:17:45] the Lord First Corinthians 10 and 16 the
[1:17:48] cup of blessing which we bless is not is
[1:17:52] it not the communion of the blood of
[1:17:55] Christ the bread which we break is it
[1:17:58] not the communion of the body of Christ
[1:18:00] for we being many are what one bread and
[1:18:06] one body for we are all partakers of
[1:18:10] that what one bread God calling us all
[1:18:15] together feeling is with the baptism of
[1:18:18] the Holy Ghost

[1:18:56] me that's quickening me to believe
[1:18:58] quickening me to accept quickening me to
[1:19:01] stand up and say I believe that it is

[1:21:13] what God done to me when I was a kid
[1:21:15] amen when the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:16] hit me it was not just somebody sitting
[1:21:19] on a Pew and and and and and and me not
[1:21:22] knowing when the Holy Spirit touched my
[1:21:25] life I want you young people I don't
[1:21:27] want y'all to hear me amen when the Holy
[1:21:29] Spirit touched my life it done something
[1:21:31] to me there was his word become alive I
[1:21:35] it was an anchor to my heart
[1:21:40] I
[1:21:41] look there uh when we uh here a couple
[1:21:44] years ago and and some of those who uh
[1:21:49] you know kids they were y'all remember
[1:21:53] when the Holy Ghost hit and there were
[1:21:55] people laying on the outside and the
[1:21:57] inside and and uh and and some of our
[1:22:00] kids were there and were just so touched
[1:22:02] by the Holy Ghost and and I and when I
[1:22:05] when it when I seen it hit I was
[1:22:06] thinking oh Lord I got to tell you my
[1:22:08] first my first thing I think that was
[1:22:10] the first time that was the that was the
[1:22:12] first time we met the fairweathers and
[1:22:14] uh I I was thinking oh Lord that's all
[1:22:18] we need is is is is is this gets a room
[1:22:21] around the country you know
[1:22:23] acting like a bunch of Pentecostals you
[1:22:25] know and and then I began to notice that
[1:22:27] night when I got back into the room I
[1:22:29] was in the dorms with the boys and and I
[1:22:32] noticed that there were some of those
[1:22:34] guys that were laying out that were
[1:22:36] still laying out in the in in that were
[1:22:38] still out underneath the presence of God
[1:22:40] and and and the other boys amen were
[1:22:44] throwing shoes on him and Adam and socks
[1:22:46] and everything else and those guys
[1:22:48] weren't budget they were still they they
[1:22:50] still they remember one of them was just
[1:22:52] Steve was just like he was totally out
[1:22:54] he was just laying there and uh the
[1:22:57] other one had a hands up in the air and
[1:22:58] he was speaking in tongues and I I you
[1:23:01] know and we're and I'm looking through
[1:23:02] here and I said well we'll we'll see I'm
[1:23:04] here to tell you these guys even after
[1:23:07] the the lights were out the presence of
[1:23:10] God was still on these people
[1:23:15] now now I am so fat so faithful that
[1:23:19] there's some yeah
[1:23:20] yards
[1:23:22] well-oiled hides that the Holy Spirit
[1:23:26] can fall on
[1:23:31] and just because I've received the Holy
[1:23:33] Ghost
[1:23:35] all those many years ago
[1:23:37] and maybe maybe I don't need to seek it
[1:23:40] now I should be seeking for a refilling
[1:23:42] I should be sick we should all be sick
[1:23:44] how many wants a refilling of the Holy
[1:23:46] Ghost

[1:27:07] and that's the whole thing for
[1:27:08] Redemption that's what God was wanting
[1:27:10] to do that's what his plan was
[1:27:13] he was the lamb
[1:27:15] then you become the first fruits of all
[1:27:17] of the Old Testament Saints and when he
[1:27:19] rose they rose with him as a type
[1:27:21] 50 days later

[1:31:49] Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus Christ
[1:31:52] we're just as sure to raise as he raised
[1:31:55] because potentially we have already
[1:31:57] raised in him amen the old things what
[1:32:00] does it do to our mortal bodies it turns
[1:32:02] our opinions it changes our Notions it
[1:32:05] sets our affections on the things which

[1:33:13] I'm saying so when we talk about the
[1:33:16] Holy Ghost what we're saying is there's
[1:33:18] something real special
[1:33:21] God is already forgiveness Jesus Jesus
[1:33:24] forgave us
[1:33:25] he's paid the price he raised from the
[1:33:27] dead to justify us
[1:33:30] and now
[1:33:31] when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:33:34] and I want to tell you I believe God can
[1:33:36] fill with the Holy Ghost right here in
[1:33:39] this Wednesday night service
[1:33:42] well what do I have to do
[1:33:43] just
[1:33:45] be yielded
[1:33:46] just be flexible
[1:33:49] just be willing to say Lord I don't
[1:33:53] understand what the preacher's saying or
[1:33:55] I don't understand a lot of things but
[1:33:57] Lord I just I want what you've got for
[1:34:00] me
[1:34:03] you say well they had to Terry brother
[1:34:05] Wendell they had to Terry for 10 days in
[1:34:07] the upper room they had to Tarry
[1:34:09] you know
[1:34:12] we don't have to tarry today
[1:34:18] well praise the Lord
[1:34:20] they had to Terry because the day of
[1:34:23] Pentacles had not fully came
[1:34:27] Jesus was here in his fort for 40 days
[1:34:30] ascended up says go wait and scripture
[1:34:33] had to be fulfilled
[1:34:37] scripture is fulfilled
[1:34:40] so this is not the same as it was at
[1:34:42] Pentecost at the big or as as far as
[1:34:45] that goes
[1:34:46] now it is for whosoever will if you can
[1:34:49] believe that you can receive the Holy
[1:34:52] Spirit right now
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:57] Amen brother window do I have to do a
[1:34:59] lot of crying do I have to do no no you
[1:35:02] have to be desperate
[1:35:04] you have to be desperate amen i i i i
[1:35:08] find I find that too many as as the
[1:35:12] musicians come I find that too many
[1:35:14] dry-eyed confessions that have claimed
[1:35:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when I
[1:35:20] say dry eyed I mean either one coming to
[1:35:23] the Altar and then getting up and saying
[1:35:25] I got the holy ghost or want to getting
[1:35:26] happy and shouting and and then getting
[1:35:28] and then going coming back and says I
[1:35:30] had the Holy Ghost I have found that
[1:35:33] there are there are very few
[1:35:36] dry-eyed uh fillings of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:40] that has that that has lasted in what I
[1:35:43] have seen in my 30 years here in Pawnee
[1:35:45] and ministering around but I have found
[1:35:47] somebody that gets desperate before God
[1:35:49] and says God I want your life in me now
[1:35:53] he's not giving it to you because you're
[1:35:55] crying that's not it what I'm saying is
[1:35:58] your tears are coming because there is a
[1:36:03] cry of desperate on the inside of you
[1:36:06] saying I must have this or else
[1:36:10] yeah brother Branham says he says that
[1:36:12] and that man will beat his beat the
[1:36:14] altar until his fists are raw he says
[1:36:17] but when that man gets up you'll receive
[1:36:18] the Holy Ghost does that mean you have
[1:36:19] to beat the altar steal your Feast of
[1:36:21] fist is raw no
[1:36:24] it's the desire
[1:36:26] it's the cry within me saying I want the
[1:36:31] exact same thing
[1:36:33] that they had
[1:36:37] amen
[1:36:39] and I think that's what we need
