[44:11] start with the the scripture Isaiah
[44:13] chapter 40.
[44:16] and
[44:18] we're going to begin this evening on on
[44:23] verse 3
[44:28] but when you go to verse 40 in my Bible
[44:30] it says the prophets new message
[44:35] and you know I want to look at that this
[44:38] evening and we realized that at that
[44:40] time it was a new message
[44:43] but it's already a past message
[44:47] it's already taken place
[44:50] so I just went ahead there and just said
[44:51] the prophet Isaiah's message so he had a
[44:55] message and then so we want to to to
[44:57] read just a little bit about that this
[44:59] evening and as we go uh our title this
[45:02] evening would be when God speaks
[45:04] when God speaks so uh you promised just
[45:07] to to to stay with me and pull this
[45:10] evening and you know let's just say you
[45:12] know let's just make it a wonderful
[45:14] Wednesday service
[45:17] amen
[45:19] and I'll try to behave the best I can
[45:23] pastor
[45:25] Abe amen uh so Isaiah chapter 40 verse
[45:29] 3.
[45:31] and we'll read all the way to verse 5.
[45:34] the Bible says the voice of him that
[45:37] Christ in the wilderness
[45:40] prepare ye the way of the Lord make
[45:44] straight in the desert a highway for our
[45:49] God we have to realize that Isaiah was
[45:52] prophesying this somewhere between 740
[45:55] to 680 BC before Christ come on the
[45:59] scene
[46:00] so this was big big big time before that
[46:04] Christ had come on the scene and we go
[46:06] to verse 4 now it says every Valley
[46:08] shall be exalted in every mountain and
[46:11] Hill shall be made low and the Crooked
[46:13] shall be made straight and the rough
[46:16] places plain and the glory of the Lord
[46:20] shall be revealed
[46:22] somebody could say Amen right there
[46:24] and all and all flesh shall see it
[46:28] together
[46:29] for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it
[46:32] so God had spoken it and it's got to
[46:36] come to pass
[46:38] I have in one more scripture I want to
[46:40] turn to the Book of Matthew
[46:43] and turn to the gospel of Matthew and we
[46:46] want to look at chapter 3
[46:58] when they can just say Amen
[47:02] Matthew chapter 3
[47:06] and we'll just begin we're going to read
[47:08] a few verses there so we'll start in
[47:11] verse 1.
[47:12] and here we have the ministry of John
[47:14] the Baptist Matthew chapter 3 verse 1
[47:17] says in those days Came John the Baptist
[47:21] preaching in the wilderness of Judea
[47:24] and saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[47:29] heaven
[47:30] is at hand
[47:32] for this
[47:34] for this is he that was spoken of by the
[47:37] prophet Isaiah which was Isaiah
[47:41] saying the voice of one crying in the
[47:43] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[47:46] Lord make his paths what
[47:49] make his path straight so we have here
[47:52] already this is he that was spoken yeah
[47:56] there was a word that had already been
[47:58] spoken and now we say well this is that
[48:02] this is that word that was spoken by the
[48:05] prophet
[48:06] amen verse 4 and the same John had his
[48:10] raiman of camel's hair and a a lettering
[48:14] girdle about his loins and his meat was
[48:16] locusts and wild honey
[48:18] they went out to hear Jerusalem they
[48:20] went out to to him Jerusalem in all
[48:22] Judea and all the the region round about
[48:25] Jordan and were baptized of him in the
[48:28] Jordan confessing their sins
[48:31] and when he saw many of the Pharisees
[48:33] and the Sadducees
[48:35] come to his baptism he said unto them o
[48:38] Generation of Vipers who hath warned you
[48:41] to flee from the Wrath to come bring
[48:44] forth therefore fruits meet for
[48:46] repentance and think not to say within
[48:49] yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father
[48:51] for I say unto you that God is able of
[48:55] these stones to raise up children unto
[48:57] Abraham and now also the ax is laid
[49:01] unto the root of the trees therefore
[49:03] every tree which bringeth not forth good
[49:06] fruit is hewn down and cast into the
[49:08] fire I indeed baptize you with water
[49:11] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[49:14] me is mightier than I whose shoes I am
[49:18] not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you
[49:20] with the Holy Ghost and with what
[49:23] with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[49:25] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[49:28] thoroughly Purge his floor and gather
[49:31] his weed into the Garner but he will but
[49:34] he will burn up the shaft and the UN
[49:36] with unquenchable fire
[49:39] verse 13 says then cometh Jesus From
[49:42] Galilee to Jordan unto John to be
[49:44] baptized of him
[49:46] but John forbade him saying I have need
[49:50] to be baptized of thee and cometh thou
[49:53] to me and Jesus answering said unto him
[49:56] suffer
[49:58] suffer it to be so now for thus it
[50:01] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[50:06] notice then he suffered him
[50:10] and Jesus when he was baptized went up
[50:13] straightway out of the water and lo the
[50:15] heavens were opened up unto him and he
[50:17] saw the spirit of God descending like a
[50:19] dove and light lightning upon him and lo
[50:22] a voice from Heaven saying this is my
[50:25] beloved Son in whom I am while please
[50:29] let us bow our hands

[51:59] Hallelujah somebody go ahead and just
[52:02] pinch yourself this evening let you know
[52:04] you're awake it's a Wednesday night and
[52:06] God is good all the time and all the
[52:08] time God is good
[52:11] we we want to just not to hurry this
[52:14] evening but not to keep you long either
[52:16] but you know when when you open up the
[52:19] scriptures and then you start reading
[52:21] the message of the hour I come to a
[52:23] portion where brother banham's talking
[52:26] about baptism and we come to the
[52:29] scriptures that we read this evening and
[52:31] many times it was asked our Prophet a
[52:35] question and when that they would read
[52:37] this scripture and they would ask that
[52:39] the question why would Jesus have to be
[52:43] baptized
[52:44] and of course we know after all we we
[52:47] understand that baptism is an act of of
[52:51] confession it's it's an act of
[52:53] repentance and an act of confession and
[52:56] when we look into the scriptures we know
[52:58] that Jesus had nothing to confess
[53:00] we know that Jesus had no need for to
[53:03] come and to to confess anything because
[53:06] he's holy and we know that Jesus is
[53:08] spotless and we we know that he is the
[53:11] unadulterated word of the son of the
[53:14] Living God
[53:15] and we know that Jesus is God and was
[53:19] God God and he was the infallible God
[53:22] but yeah the question is asked why then
[53:24] would he need to be baptized after all
[53:28] the scripture says that he was in the
[53:30] world and the world was made by him the
[53:33] very one that made the world is now
[53:36] coming to be baptized
[53:38] and in that brother Brad takes that
[53:41] question and he asks he says why would
[53:44] he have to be baptized and we find the
[53:47] answer thus in the scripture that when
[53:50] Jesus said to the prophet he said thus
[53:53] it becometh us to fulfill all
[53:58] righteousness now the word we want to
[54:01] look in there this evening is the word
[54:03] us because we have an understanding that
[54:06] Jesus Christ was the word and he comes
[54:09] to the prophet because the word always
[54:10] comes to the always comes to the prophet
[54:14] but now we find out that the one who was
[54:17] spotless and unadulterated the very
[54:19] maker of the world here he comes now to
[54:22] the prophet and he's saying us
[54:25] now when you look at the word us the
[54:27] word us means concerning a person
[54:30] himself or herself the speaker and one
[54:35] or more people so in other words Jesus
[54:37] was saying we have to fulfill all
[54:40] righteousness right but he's including
[54:42] us now we have to look here this evening
[54:45] and say wait well well why wouldn't he
[54:47] just be able to do it all by himself
[54:49] because then he would go against
[54:51] scripture
[54:53] so now he comes to the prophet he said
[54:56] thus said becometh us to fulfill all
[54:59] righteousness and here we have a
[55:02] scenario of the two greatest leaders in
[55:04] the entire world here you have the
[55:07] prophet of God and here you have the
[55:09] maker himself Jesus Christ so you have
[55:12] the two most powerful people in the
[55:14] world and we find out that we when we
[55:16] look we have to identify and we're going
[55:18] to kind of pick up where we left off a
[55:21] little bit on the last preaching here
[55:23] can somebody say Amen
[55:25] so we see that Jesus it wasn't that he
[55:28] just shows up in any kind of form or
[55:30] fashion but we recognize that Jesus was
[55:34] the word made flesh
[55:36] so in other words we come to to this
[55:38] little corner brother Wendell
[55:40] where we saw a manifestation taking
[55:43] place right here of what of the where
[55:45] being coming flesh so we had to
[55:48] understand that here was all that the
[55:50] prophets had spoke everything that they
[55:53] had said concerning Jesus had now come
[55:57] and it was manifesting in other words
[55:59] Jesus walked off the pages he walked off
[56:03] of the pages and here he comes and now
[56:05] he's speaking to the prophet can
[56:08] somebody say Amen so in other words the
[56:10] prophet of God told us it's the word and
[56:13] the prophet together
[56:15] so here we have the living breathing
[56:18] word now coming to a prophet can
[56:22] somebody say amen and notice and he
[56:24] comes out of the pages he starts to talk
[56:27] to the prophet and he said and be cometh
[56:29] us somebody say us and become his off us
[56:34] to fulfill all righteousness in other
[56:37] words he's saying to John we have
[56:40] scripture to fulfill
[56:42] the reason that this is taking place is
[56:45] it had already been spoken about other
[56:47] prophets and now we have to fulfill our
[56:51] portion
[56:52] so in speaking that we we see oh well we
[56:55] can just put it this way for you this
[56:57] evening we're the message of the hour
[57:00] when he come out of the pages we have
[57:03] the word everything that was spoken of
[57:05] the prophets and thou what what Isaiah
[57:07] had spoken about John had everything had
[57:10] just come out and manifested out of
[57:12] scripture and here it was John living
[57:15] and breathing living and breathing was
[57:17] the prophecy that was spoken about him
[57:19] here we are Jesus now living and
[57:22] breathing breathing what everything that
[57:24] the prophets have spoken about him so
[57:26] now we have two prophecies meeting
[57:29] together
[57:30] living and breathing that's why he had
[57:33] to come and say us
[57:34] John it is us me and you not just me but
[57:40] you too
[57:43] for what for what to fulfill scripture
[57:47] I would ask a question just you know
[57:49] just a home church tonight
[57:51] you know when you look at it you know we
[57:53] we look into the scripture and we
[57:55] recognize that if you add a word or you
[57:58] take a word out of the scripture that
[58:00] it's you have a curse coming to you
[58:03] now you have to recognize the importance
[58:05] of that is because Jesus already has
[58:08] spoken something that has to come to
[58:11] pass
[58:12] and when we try to come in and change
[58:14] that in any way come on church then we
[58:17] start to change the mind of God and we
[58:19] cannot do that
[58:24] notice I like to part when you when you
[58:26] could look and and and have the
[58:29] revelation of the two living breathing
[58:31] word come alive
[58:33] and now they can say John
[58:36] worth the message of the hour
[58:40] it says we have to fulfill scripture
[58:42] notice brother about him takes that and
[58:45] he says it must be fulfilled
[58:48] he said all the word that God has spoken
[58:55] what must be fulfilled
[58:58] all the word that God has spoken it must
[59:01] be fulfilled notice brother bam takes
[59:04] that he said God cannot say anything
[59:06] without having it fulfilled
[59:10] when he has spoken it it is a finished
[59:14] work
[59:16] it's already finished when God speaks it
[59:19] so when we look at the prophecy of
[59:21] Isaiah when Isaiah spoke that prophecy
[59:24] it was as good as done
[59:26] it was already good it's done and no
[59:30] wonder that Jesus would come and say it
[59:31] it would becometh us to fulfill the
[59:34] scripture that was spoken because it
[59:37] cannot be changed it cannot deviate in
[59:40] any way John we must fulfill that
[59:42] scripture
[59:43] and notice he Brother Brad said God
[59:45] never speaks
[59:47] God never speaks until he's ready for it
[59:50] to be and when he speaks it's just as
[59:54] well as already happened
[59:57] now we can say amen and we can say
[1:00:00] hallelujah and we can say yeah but
[1:00:02] brother man what does that even mean to
[1:00:03] us
[1:00:04] what does that mean to us tonight
[1:00:07] notice brother man takes then he says
[1:00:09] now if that wouldn't give us a basis to
[1:00:14] put our faith on
[1:00:16] what are we going to get we're going to
[1:00:17] grab our faith and we're going to put it
[1:00:20] on the scriptures and know that it's got
[1:00:24] to be fulfilled
[1:00:26] if God said he's going to have a bride
[1:00:28] in this hour then I'm really just saying
[1:00:31] it's got to be fulfilled and it's going
[1:00:34] to take someone not
[1:00:42] Hallelujah
[1:00:46] notice he says now if thou wouldn't give
[1:00:49] us a basis to pull our faith on this
[1:00:53] warning how are we going to take the
[1:00:55] word and the promises of God and put
[1:00:58] your faith there knowing that there has
[1:01:00] to come to pass
[1:01:05] when God speaks the word it's already
[1:01:07] finished
[1:01:09] when God speaks a word
[1:01:14] it's going to take a little more than
[1:01:15] that
[1:01:17] when God speaks the word
[1:01:20] it's already finished
[1:01:23] when God speaks the word
[1:01:26] it's already finished
[1:01:28] and notice he says and what about his
[1:01:31] promises that he's given to us
[1:01:34] notices everything that he has said it's
[1:01:37] already a finished work he said so
[1:01:41] therefore somebody say therefore so
[1:01:44] therefore when we receive his word into
[1:01:47] our heart
[1:01:49] when we receive his word into our heart
[1:01:51] it's already done it's completed
[1:01:56] when not when it's just up here not when
[1:01:59] it's right here but when it drops into
[1:02:01] our heart it's already completed what's
[1:02:04] completed the word of God it's as good
[1:02:07] as already done when it drops into your
[1:02:09] heart
[1:02:11] you say well let's take a look brother
[1:02:13] let's see let's see her dropping into
[1:02:15] and let's see what that it does how many
[1:02:18] want to see her dropping into
[1:02:21] notice we see that that John
[1:02:24] when he was on the receiving end of the
[1:02:27] word here comes the word and the pro and
[1:02:29] the word always comes to a prophet
[1:02:32] and so John's on the receiving end of it
[1:02:34] and what is the word counting him that
[1:02:36] it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:02:39] righteousness the word coming to a
[1:02:41] prophet and guess what John being a
[1:02:43] prophet we find out that he understood
[1:02:50] he understood when that word dropped
[1:02:52] into a revelation to himself so here it
[1:02:56] was it wasn't that John just said oh oh
[1:02:58] that's nice
[1:03:00] you know oh yeah we've got to to fulfill
[1:03:03] it no immediately him being a prophet he
[1:03:07] what did he do he had to bring your
[1:03:09] brother back to scripture
[1:03:11] he couldn't just say oh that's a nice
[1:03:13] word that was great for us but he had to
[1:03:16] take it right back to the scriptures so
[1:03:19] in other words John being a prophet
[1:03:21] someone say a prophet John being a
[1:03:23] prophet immediately brother Miguel what
[1:03:25] did he do he took it to the scripture he
[1:03:27] said well this is the one this has to be
[1:03:30] the sacrifice that has to be lost
[1:03:33] so in other words now he realized and he
[1:03:36] received it well before he was saying I
[1:03:38] can't be I'm not the one how am I going
[1:03:41] to baptize you right he had no
[1:03:44] understanding of these things but as
[1:03:46] soon as he said us that we have to
[1:03:47] fulfill the scripture immediately and
[1:03:50] drive from John uh everything that John
[1:03:53] had known everything that he realized
[1:03:56] about scripture had just dropped Bloom
[1:03:59] and it hit him he said well that's the
[1:04:01] sacrifice
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:03] okay all right well the sacrifice has to
[1:04:06] be washed according to the scripture so
[1:04:09] president told us he said that's the
[1:04:11] type that now Jesus was the sacrifice
[1:04:14] and the sacrifice had to be washed
[1:04:16] sister Julian have to be washed but we
[1:04:19] also know the prophet of God told us
[1:04:20] that there was an anti-type he said Not
[1:04:23] only was it a sacrifice that needed to
[1:04:26] be washed but he was also the high
[1:04:28] priest
[1:04:30] and before a high priest could be
[1:04:32] anointed he had to be washed so Jesus
[1:04:36] was now what the word dropped into John
[1:04:39] being the prophet boom he's the
[1:04:41] sacrifice and the high priest
[1:04:45] he's the sacrifice and the high priest
[1:04:48] before that come on Church
[1:05:04] do you see it when it drops
[1:05:08] there's a lot of times that your pastor
[1:05:10] preaches
[1:05:11] and he preaches and he preaches and you
[1:05:13] go homo that was nice that was nice but
[1:05:15] what happens when it drops
[1:05:17] it's at that time you say hallelujah oh
[1:05:20] Lord now I see now now I see it's it's
[1:05:23] making sense everything's making sense
[1:05:26] my position everything that I'm doing is
[1:05:28] starting to make sense
[1:05:33] Hallelujah so we we had an understanding
[1:05:36] that now John realized but he just
[1:05:39] didn't realize making something up
[1:05:41] he wasn't just oh yeah no he immediately
[1:05:43] took it back to the scriptures
[1:05:45] immediately now that was the sacrifice
[1:05:48] yes the high priest how many believe
[1:05:50] that Jesus Christ is our high priest no
[1:05:52] and he had to be washed what before he
[1:05:55] could be anointed
[1:05:58] the sacrifice had to be as the type
[1:06:00] Hallelujah it had to be clean and the
[1:06:03] attack types the high priest it had to
[1:06:05] be washed before he would be anointed
[1:06:10] I would ask you was John the greatest
[1:06:12] man until that hour
[1:06:15] John was the greatest man that had lived
[1:06:17] until that hour someone say until that
[1:06:20] hour
[1:06:21] and notice the greatest man of war
[1:06:23] notice immediately he was humbled
[1:06:28] no and John being humbled hello and John
[1:06:32] being humbled and many times and we we
[1:06:35] receive the word we're humbled
[1:06:41] we're humbled by the word
[1:06:43] and then when we're humbled by the word
[1:06:46] then sometimes we say well you know what
[1:06:48] oh lord I can't do anything oh I'm
[1:06:50] nothing but you got to be humble to a
[1:06:52] point to where you have to understand
[1:06:54] that you have a portion that you have
[1:06:58] something to fulfill
[1:06:59] I want to ask you if we look at John
[1:07:01] brother Wendell and and John would have
[1:07:04] just said you know what it's been
[1:07:05] identified
[1:07:07] this is the sacrifice this is everything
[1:07:09] that the Old Testament was talking about
[1:07:11] this is the high priest oh no there's no
[1:07:14] way that I could do it there's no way
[1:07:17] that there's no way that it's me and
[1:07:19] many people say no no I don't see with
[1:07:22] all the people in the world all
[1:07:24] everybody all the drugs all the things
[1:07:26] why would he choose me
[1:07:29] and you know many times we can say well
[1:07:31] we're humbled by that but I want to tell
[1:07:34] you tonight but he did Choose You
[1:07:36] and he answers you and you have a
[1:07:39] portion to play in it it's not that you
[1:07:41] go back because John could you imagine
[1:07:43] if John would have said no I I can't do
[1:07:46] it I refuse to do it
[1:07:49] he would have been changing sister
[1:07:50] Fresco the word of God but the word of
[1:07:53] God could not be changed because when it
[1:07:55] was already spoken it was as good as
[1:07:58] already being done
[1:08:00] so what he's saying that he had to
[1:08:03] suffer it
[1:08:04] the Bible says and he suffered it and he
[1:08:06] baptized Jesus
[1:08:10] thus fulfilling
[1:08:12] his portion
[1:08:15] and so we noticed that many prophets
[1:08:19] and especially our prophet had wanted to
[1:08:22] to go back and just be a Wilderness man
[1:08:26] how many of us men I'm going to ask you
[1:08:28] tonight just said well that I've thought
[1:08:30] of that
[1:08:31] that I would just leave and and I would
[1:08:34] just find myself in the mountains of
[1:08:36] Colorado or Idaho or Alaska or New
[1:08:41] Mexico or wherever that would be and
[1:08:43] I'll never come out and I'll stay there
[1:08:45] and you know the prophet of God thought
[1:08:47] that too
[1:08:48] but God told him that he would become a
[1:08:51] bomb he told him that his wife would
[1:08:53] leave him
[1:08:58] because he had a greater prophecy to
[1:09:01] fulfill
[1:09:04] all right you go home and study it up
[1:09:10] brother Brandon had a great portion to
[1:09:12] fulfill could you imagine he would have
[1:09:15] said well I'm done with all you people
[1:09:16] I'm done with these people they're
[1:09:18] they're too much they they cried too
[1:09:21] much they complained too much they why
[1:09:22] too much oh it's just
[1:09:25] it's just gonna come out and maybe I'll
[1:09:27] just come out once in a while
[1:09:29] and preach and then I'll Retreat back
[1:09:31] but that wasn't his fulfillment he had
[1:09:35] to fulfill all
[1:09:38] now you're catching it he had to fulfill
[1:09:41] all
[1:09:43] see us up there he had to feel fulfill
[1:09:45] all what
[1:09:48] scripture
[1:09:53] and we realized that when he did yeah
[1:09:57] what he did what happened the Bible said
[1:09:59] that there come a message out of Heaven
[1:10:01] on the wings of uh
[1:10:05] [Laughter]
[1:10:07] and what did that message say he said
[1:10:10] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:10:13] pleased and we know that it's who he was
[1:10:16] pleased to dwell in
[1:10:19] and so now we see because that scripture
[1:10:23] was fulfilled
[1:10:26] righteousness being fulfilled bringing
[1:10:29] forth the Redemption message of Grace
[1:10:41] you know what the point is
[1:10:43] this you know what the point is tonight
[1:10:46] if John yep yep you
[1:10:49] if John
[1:10:51] didn't fulfill his portion
[1:10:55] we wouldn't have the grace that we could
[1:10:57] say Grace Grace
[1:11:05] that's why Jesus is telling them us
[1:11:09] us you have a part to play in it
[1:11:12] not just the preachers
[1:11:18] you young man you have a part to play
[1:11:22] you young ladies you have a part to play
[1:11:24] for what to fulfill scripture
[1:11:29] notice
[1:11:31] but if I'm taking that and we find out
[1:11:33] that as soon as this had taken place
[1:11:35] Jesus's Ministry was ready
[1:11:38] what do you say about that while he was
[1:11:40] washed and he was anointed
[1:11:42] and what was it brother Brown said it
[1:11:44] was a word that would redeem the whole
[1:11:46] world
[1:11:48] could you imagine John's position he had
[1:11:51] to say yes
[1:11:52] he had to suffer it but we realized that
[1:11:56] Jesus on the cross what did he say he
[1:11:58] said it is
[1:12:00] it is finished notice brother I said
[1:12:03] John looked and he saw and brother bear
[1:12:06] asked how did he know this was Jesus
[1:12:10] notice he said he saw a dove that had
[1:12:12] been told him by the spirit of God
[1:12:15] someone say spirit of God the spirit of
[1:12:18] God had already told him why because he
[1:12:21] was a
[1:12:22] a prophet and he told him upon whom Thou
[1:12:26] shalt see the spirit descending and
[1:12:28] remaining on he is the one
[1:12:31] he is the one he is the one what that
[1:12:34] will baptize with Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:12:38] he's the one that will baptize with Holy
[1:12:41] Ghost and Fire notice we built that up
[1:12:43] just a little bit tonight to start
[1:12:45] bringing it to you
[1:12:47] all this had to take place
[1:12:50] because there was a holy ghost that was
[1:12:53] coming to baptize you with Holy Ghost
[1:12:56] and Fire so John had to fulfill our
[1:13:00] righteousness he had to fulfill the
[1:13:02] scriptures
[1:13:06] so we see Jesus proving what the prophet
[1:13:09] said that he would do I want to ask you
[1:13:11] did he heal the sick
[1:13:13] did he raise the dead did he calm the
[1:13:16] storm did he turn water into wine did he
[1:13:19] multiply the fish in the bread did he
[1:13:22] walk on water did he cast out Devils did
[1:13:25] he preach the gospel he did everything
[1:13:28] he was supposed to do doing it well
[1:13:31] brother man a fulfilling all
[1:13:33] righteousness
[1:13:37] yeah
[1:13:40] oh it is good
[1:13:42] it's good for us tonight Church
[1:13:44] notice he goes on to say he proves all
[1:13:48] his words
[1:13:51] all of his words
[1:13:53] just think of it all his words
[1:14:05] notice what brother Brown says next
[1:14:08] he says and you were
[1:14:12] his word
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:25] he fulfills all his word
[1:14:29] and you
[1:14:39] Glory he was the word
[1:14:44] and you were part
[1:14:47] of his word
[1:14:53] and that's the reason

[1:16:01] word
[1:16:03] and that's the reason you're sent here
[1:16:08] to confirm your place
[1:16:10] in life
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:27] you know what he said when he preached
[1:16:28] his people said I don't think you got it
[1:16:33] what do you mean he's saying I don't
[1:16:34] know if it dropped from here to here
[1:16:37] because when it does and you realize

[1:22:37] yeah right and then the hospital is this
[1:22:40] all right brother I'm just telling you
[1:22:42] what he said go and testify a little I
[1:22:44] said I was letting you know what was
[1:22:45] happening right there
[1:22:46] and he was saying don't do it you know
[1:22:48] you're okay just sit there and I say you
[1:22:50] know what I'm not gonna sit down
[1:22:52] I've never been one to sit down I'm
[1:22:54] going to give it my best I gave my best
[1:22:56] when I preach I give my best when I'm
[1:22:58] sitting on the Pew I give it the best
[1:23:00] wherever that I am and you need to give
[1:23:02] your best too
[1:23:02] [Applause]
[1:23:14] I don't even know where that came from
[1:23:17] but I think we do
[1:23:21] don't worry you won't see me for a while
[1:23:28] can we just speak about us just a little
[1:23:30] bit
[1:23:31] just just brother that won't be too much
[1:23:33] longer
[1:23:35] notice mother Brown said he said that
[1:23:37] that's the reason you're sent here to
[1:23:39] confirm your place in life
[1:23:41] and then he says right away he says I
[1:23:43] don't think you got that
[1:23:46] so there's something that we have to
[1:23:48] grasp there
[1:23:50] we have to grasp that we have a position
[1:23:52] we have a place here
[1:23:54] it's not just to go to work every day
[1:23:58] and you realize it brother but I'm
[1:24:01] talking about in a message called it
[1:24:03] becometh us to fulfill
[1:24:06] to fulfill all righteousness he says
[1:24:08] it'd be and I want to tell you tonight
[1:24:10] it becometh us also tonight to fulfill
[1:24:13] our portion of the word
[1:24:15] notice how many realized that you know
[1:24:18] when we look into scripture Enoch is our
[1:24:21] type
[1:24:22] we know that Enoch was raptured right
[1:24:25] and then when we go over to Noah we
[1:24:27] recognize that Noah's dealing with the
[1:24:29] Jews and that they'll be carried over
[1:24:31] into by of tribulation
[1:24:33] and so now we have our understanding now
[1:24:35] with that I'm going to close on this if
[1:24:37] the musicians would just come up this
[1:24:38] evening I'm going to close on this on
[1:24:40] this quote brother Brandon preached he
[1:24:42] said in the days he said of Enoch he
[1:24:46] said just before the flood he said when
[1:24:50] Enoch looked out there and saw Noah
[1:24:52] building away on that Ark now notice how
[1:24:56] brother battery immediately puts in
[1:24:57] there and he talks about he says Enoch
[1:25:00] was a prophet someone say a prophet he
[1:25:02] said Enoch was a prophet he said Enoch
[1:25:06] knew that he was a type
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] so the thing is Enoch had already know
[1:25:13] how did he know because he was a prophet
[1:25:15] he knew that he was a type and he was a
[1:25:19] type he knew exactly what type that he
[1:25:22] was
[1:25:23] now we have to recognize notice he says
[1:25:26] Enoch knew that he was a type somebody
[1:25:28] say new
[1:25:30] he said and he knew that before the
[1:25:33] floods came that he had to give an
[1:25:37] example
[1:25:39] so we look at Enoch's life now and we
[1:25:42] recognize it wasn't that he was just
[1:25:44] blindly walking into this
[1:25:47] Enoch was a prophet and he knew exactly
[1:25:50] what was taking place
[1:25:52] he knew that he had to go to his wife
[1:25:56] and he had to talk to his wife and he
[1:25:59] had to say sister he said I love you
[1:26:01] with all of my heart
[1:26:03] I love you I do but I just want to tell
[1:26:06] you I have a journey
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:13] and let me tell you it takes somebody
[1:26:15] with courage
[1:26:19] if you knew that you were going to pass
[1:26:21] away
[1:26:23] or leave the scene and you would no
[1:26:25] longer see somebody here
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:29] on this Earth again
[1:26:31] until we cross over
[1:26:34] would it change what you would say
[1:26:42] you know we oh I would say this brother
[1:26:44] and I would say that
[1:26:46] but if you really knew this was the last
[1:26:48] day that you were going to talk to
[1:26:50] somebody here on this Earth
[1:26:53] I want to tell you it would be difficult
[1:27:00] and Enoch knew what he had to fulfill
[1:27:03] yeah so when he went to his wife
[1:27:06] he's talking to his wife and he said
[1:27:08] well I love you dear
[1:27:10] and he knew that he wouldn't see her
[1:27:12] again on this Earth
[1:27:14] and that she would miss him no doubt
[1:27:18] but not only that the Enoch had to go to
[1:27:20] his children
[1:27:22] and he would have to talk to his
[1:27:23] children and he would grab his daughter
[1:27:25] and say daughter I love you with all of
[1:27:27] my heart with everything that I have
[1:27:30] stay with the word
[1:27:33] stay with the word and then he'd look
[1:27:35] over to his son and he'd grab his son
[1:27:37] and say oh son I love you oh no doubt he
[1:27:41] would want to see what he would become
[1:27:42] no doubt he'd want to see all of his
[1:27:45] grandchildren in the lineage Beyond but
[1:27:48] let me tell you it was becoming on him
[1:27:50] to fulfill his portion
[1:27:53] together
[1:27:55] and Enoch had a portion to fulfill
[1:28:00] notice but the Raptor says that before
[1:28:03] the floods came that he had to give an
[1:28:05] example so one afternoon
[1:28:07] it was becoming to him to take a walk
[1:28:13] I'm going to tell you tonight he knew
[1:28:15] that he was leaving
[1:28:17] he knew that he was taking a different
[1:28:19] walk
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:23] and notice his brother said and it was
[1:28:25] becoming that he'd take this walk with
[1:28:28] God and some how that day he changed his
[1:28:33] path
[1:28:34] it was a little different than it was
[1:28:36] the day before and and the day before
[1:28:40] Hallelujah notice he said instead of
[1:28:43] going around the side of the Hill
[1:28:46] today he took the King's Highway
[1:28:50] and he just kept on walking somebody
[1:28:53] said Keep On Walking he just kept on
[1:28:56] walking and they found him not because
[1:28:59] he was not
[1:29:01] and he had walked up the King's Highway
[1:29:03] notice what brother Brandon said he said
[1:29:05] oh God let me be that Enoch
[1:29:09] oh and it's time to fulfill my portion
[1:29:12] let me be like Enoch let me be like
[1:29:15] Abraham let me be like Elijah let me be
[1:29:18] like brother Branham let me fulfill my
[1:29:21] portion
[1:29:23] no matter what it would do here on this
[1:29:25] Earth
[1:29:26] come on Church no matter the human
[1:29:27] emotion that we go through we have to
[1:29:31] fulfill our portion
[1:29:32] and God said he's going to have a bride
[1:29:35] clean and spotless I want to tell you
[1:29:38] here tonight you're here to fulfill that
[1:29:41] portion of righteousness
[1:29:44] Keep On Walking little bride keep on

[1:29:57] to our feet
[1:30:01] notices and I can see knock as he was
[1:30:04] becoming to him for he was a prophet
[1:30:08] and he knew what was going to happen so
[1:30:11] I can see him kiss his wife goodbye
[1:30:15] oh I could just imagine brother Wendell
[1:30:17] brother Brandon seen by a vision
[1:30:18] [Music]
[1:30:20] come on because he was a prophet he said
[1:30:23] oh I can just imagine him kissing his
[1:30:26] little wife goodbye

[1:30:34] goodbye and go down to his merry son and

[1:30:45] are you going out for a little walk
[1:30:48] and him saying yes going for a stroll
[1:30:52] but he never took the old familiar path
[1:30:54] that day
[1:30:56] he took the Kings Highway
