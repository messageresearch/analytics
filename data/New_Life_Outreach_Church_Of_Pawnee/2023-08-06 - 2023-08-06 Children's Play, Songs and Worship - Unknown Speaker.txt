Jesus parents traveled to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover when he was 12 years old they went up as they always did for the feast when it was over they left for home but the Child Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem with without his parents knowing thinking he was somewhere in the Caravan they journeyed for a whole day and began looking for him among relatives and Neighbors when they didn't find him they went back to Jerusalem looking for him the next day they found him in the temple seated among the teachers listening to them and asking questions the teachers were all quite taken with him impressed with the sharpness of his answers [Music] why you stopped me I posted about my father's business so he went back to Nazareth with them and lived obediently with him his mother held these things dearly deep within herself and Jesus matured growing up both in body and spirit blessed by both God and man foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] dressed in a camel hair and lived on a diet of locus and Wild Honey people poured out of Jerusalem Judea and the Jordanian Countryside to hear and see him in action there at the Jordan River those who came to confess their sins were baptized when John saw the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism he had to speak out old Generation of Vipers who have warned you of giraffe to come whatever um I think not to say within yourselves we are sons of Abraham for I stand to you everyone is able to rise up to himself Children of the rocks and someone is coming greater than I who feels I am not worthy to bear and he will burn up all the chat from his Gardener with an unconscionable fire then Jesus came arriving at the Jordan River From Galilee to be baptized by John when John saw him there he couldn't understand it I have need to be baptized of thee come inside to me so forth to be so we must fulfill our righteousness the moment Jesus came up out of the baptismal Waters the skies opened up and he saw God's spirit descending like a dove and landing on him and along with the spirit of voice this is my beloved Son in who I am pleased to dwell thank you [Music] need your help [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus was led to the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil after fasting for 40 days and fourth nights he became hungry it was during this time of physical weakness that the temperature came to him if you truly are the Son of God then turn these stones into bread it's written man should not live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil took him up to Jerusalem and set him on the Pinnacle of the temple the Pinnacle was 164 feet up approximately 15 stories high from this great height the devil tempted him again if you're the Son of God then throw yourself down for it is written that he has given his angels charge over you and in their hands they shall bear you up lest you dash your foot against a stone it is also written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord and the devil took Jesus up into an exceeding high mountain well on the mountain he showed Jesus all the kings of the world throughout time he showed Jesus the glory and the power in of wealth of each kingdom Fall Down and Worship me and I will give you all these things insane for that show worship Lord thy God and whom only shout that serve Jesus defeated Satan with the power and authority of God's words Satan departed and Angels Came to minister unto Jesus thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] while Jesus was teaching there came a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue Jairus fell down at Jesus feet and begged him to come to his house his only daughter a little 12 year old girl was dying Jesus agreed to go but all the people wanted to hear more of his sermon so they crowded around him and jostled at each other as they walked along the road just then a woman who had hemorrhaged for 12 years fought through the crowd she was thinking that if she could just Touch the Hem of His Garment she would be healed sought who touched me you can shove it why do you ask who touched you no this is different I can tell someone touched me because my strength has gone out of me [Music] clean daughter be of good Comfort your faith has made you whole Harris if you're not only believe in her faith will make her whole Jesus commanded that the multitude of people as well as most of his disciples should go home he only allowed Peter James and John to go with him to jairus's house as I walked into the house they found a small gathering of mourners everyone was weeping and crying over the girl's death why are you crying so loudly this damsel is not dead but is simply asleep for a moment the mourners just stared at Jesus but then they began to laugh who's this man that would come and tell them a dead girl wasn't only asleep what did he know about the situation Jesus commanded them all to leave to how to leave the house and they were gone he went into the room with the girl and her parents alone damsel I say unto thee arise at Jesus words the damsel Rose and walked to her parents they were shocked and excited all at the same time Jesus immediately commanded that they should get the girl something to eat and they should tell no man what happened in the room [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] thank you soon another Feast came around and Jesus back in Jerusalem near the Sheep gate in Jerusalem there was a pool with five alcoves in Hebrew it is called Bethesda hundreds of six sick people blind crippled and paralyzed were in these alcoves when Jesus came to the pool he walked through the crowd and single that one man this man had been had been an invalid for 38 years you're going to be healed one is there no way puts in pool time I get their Summers already in rise take up your bed and walk the man was instantly healed he climbed up to his feet and walked away with much rejoicing but as he went some of the Jews stopped him to berate and correct him it is the Sabbath why do you carry your bed that is against the law the man who hit me said take my bed and start walking who gave you the order to take up your bed and start walking who's right here man but I don't know later the same day Jesus encountered the man he had healed at the temple he instructed the man to sin no more so that a worse thing did not come upon him after the conversation the man went and told the Jews it was Jesus that had made him whole [Applause] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] after a big day of preaching and feeding five thousand men plus women and children Jesus insisted that the disciples get in the boat and go underneath while he dismissed the people with the crowd dispersed he climbed the mountain so he could be by himself and pray he stayed there alone laid into the night meanwhile in the boat that was far out at Sea when the wind came up against them and they were battered by the waves no matter how hard the disciples rode they couldn't make any progress it was about four o'clock in the morning when one of them saw something they could just make out a shadowy figure through the wind and waves and dim light look it's a it's a it is I don't be afraid if it's you call me to come to you Peter jumped out of the boat and began to walk to Jesus he took several steps without any problem but as the wind and waves splashed against him he began to look at what was taking place around him the waves churning beneath his feet as the wind blowing against him raised doubts in his mind and began to sink not save me Jesus reached out and grabbed Peter's hand lifting him back up but he admonished his disciple oh now a little faith why did stealth out the two walked across the water and they climbed the number as soon as they climbed into the boat the wind died and seas calm the disciples in the boat having watched the whole thing began to worship Jesus saying [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] thank you [Music] thank you as Jesus was walking down the street in Jerusalem he and his disciples saw a man that had been born blind cause this man to be born blind him or his parents neither this man or his parents sin to cause him to be born blind it was born this way for the works of God could be manifested when Jesus stopped speaking he began to spin into the dust once there was enough moisture collected he made a clay paste and then rubbed it into the Blind Man's eyes go on wash in the pool of Slum the man followed Jesus instructions and made his way to the pool of Siloam once there he washed the pace from his eyes and his eyes were open he could see soon the town was buzzing with his relatives and those who had seen him begging as a blind man year after year were all asking isn't this the man we knew who sat here and begged his arm it's not the same man no it's definitely me don't you recognize me a man named Jesus made a paste and rubbed it in my eyes he told me to come wash in this pool and whenever I did I could see so where is he I don't know the crowd took hold of the man and marched him to the Pharisees once there the Pharisees questioned him again about what he had seen the men continued to share the exact same story but it didn't satisfy the Pharisees this man can't be from God he doesn't keep the Sabbath how can a man that such a sinner do such a miracle what about you what do you think of the man that healed you I think he's a prophet the Pharisees didn't believe it they didn't even believe the man had been blind to begin with they decided that they needed to get more information so they called in the Man's parents is this your son was he actually born blind and if so how does he now see he speak for himself give credit to God we know that this man is a sinner I don't know anything about him being a sinner all I know is I was blind and now I see but how did he open your eyes I've told you the story over and over again if I told you again would you believe me you may be a disciple of that man but we are Disciples of Moses we know that Moses was a prophet but we have no idea where this man came from so we know that God only listens to people that do and obey his will so if he was a sinner could he really do anything how dare you you were born in sins and dare to teach us the Pharisees took hold of the man very roughly and threw him into the street he was left to wander through the crowds not sure where to go or what to do but then Jesus found him do you believe in the son of man yes shown to me shown to me that I may believe in him Lord I believe thank you [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] let's see [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus was traveling toward Jerusalem when he crossed over the border from Samaria and Galilee as he was approaching a village he was met by ten lepers the men kept their distance as was the law but they called out loudly to get his attention at Jesus command the Ten Men began to make their way to the priests as they walked they were everyone healed they were all very excited and all continued their way but one of them who happened to be a Samaritan turned around and made his way back to Jesus go on your face and make you whole [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign please [Music] foreign [Music] as Jesus was in the wilderness teaching a messenger came to him Master the only one you love is sick Jesus knew that this was a message concerning his good good friend Lazarus of Bethany the sickness is known to death but that the glory of God might be shown through the Son of God Jesus loved Lazarus and his sister Mary and Martha but instead of leaving as soon as he received the message he remained in the wilderness for another two days finally after two days of teaching he called his disciples to him let's go back to Judea you can't go back to the jail the Jews are out to kill you whoever walks in the daylight doesn't stumble because you can see where he's going meanwhile whoever walks in the night can't see where he's going so he will stumble my our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep and I'm going to wake him up if he's fall asleep he'll get a good night's rest and you woke up feeling fine Lazarus has died and I'm glad for your sakes I wasn't there but the intent that this will strengthen your faith let's go we might die with him when Jesus finally got there he found Lazarus already four days dead Bethany was near Jerusalem only a couple of miles away and many of the Jews are visiting Mary and Martha sympathizing with him over their brother when Martha heard Jesus was coming she rushed out to meet him in there my brother wouldn't have died but even now I know whatever you ask God he will give you your brother will live again I believe that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day I am the resurrection and life whosoever believeth in me even though they die will live again do you believe this yes master I believe that you the Messiah Son of God who comes into the world after saying this Martha went back to her sister Mary after Martha whispered to her that Jesus had arrived and was asking for her Mary jumped up and ran out to meet him Jesus had not yet entered the town but had remained at the place where Martha met him when her sympathizing Jewish friend saw Murray runoff they followed her thinking she was on her way to the tomb to weep there [Music] when Jesus saw Mary sobbing and the Jews with her he felt a great sorrow rise up within him asking where they had laid Lazarus to rest Jesus also began to weep as they were walking to the gravesite some of the Jews observed How Deeply Jesus must have loved Lazarus While others asked why Jesus hadn't done more to prevent the death of Lazarus remove the stone Lord by this time he stinketh it's been four days didn't I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God I say unto you remove the stone father I thank thee that thou has hurt me and I know that that will always hears me but because of but because of those around me I saith it Lazarus come forth at Jesus words he came out of the Tomb a walking cativer wrapped from head to toe and with kerchief over his face he was alive but he was still bad unwrap him and let him loose [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music]

fastened down I spent the night in sleeplessness Rose at every sound happen hopeless sorrow half and fear the day find soldiers breaking through dragon soul away just before the sunrise heard something at the wall the gate began to rattle a voice began to crawl I hurried through the window looked down into the street expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers being there was no one there but Mary soap it down the lettering stood there beside me she told us where she'd been she said they've moved them in the middle of the night and none of us knows where stoned and rolled away now his body isn't there we both ran toward a garden John ran on the head we found a stone in the empty tomb just the way that Mary said but the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell how where they'd taken him was more than I could tell something strange happened there was what I did not know John believed a miracle but I just turned to go circumstances speculations could lift me very high I'd seen them crucify him then I saw him down back inside the house again everything God promised him just added to my shame when elastic came with choices I denied I knew his name even if he wasn't alive it wouldn't be the same suddenly the arrows filled with a strange and sweet perfume and I've shown them everywhere drove Shadows from the room Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide I fell down on my knees I clothed him and cried he raised me to my feet I looked into his eyes and I was shining out from them like sunlight from the skies guilt in my confusion disappeared and sweet release every fear I'd ever had was melted into peas he's alive he's alive he's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive and

things that we leave behind [Music] you was mindful of taking the time attacks and pressing the people to pay but hearing the call he responded in faith and followed the light and the way and leaving the people so puzzled he found the breed in his heart was no longer around and it's hard to imagine the freedom we find from the things that we leave behind [Music] every heart needs to be set free from possession that hold its own tight Freedom's not found in the things that we own it's the power to do what is right with Jesus our only possession then giving me comes a delight and we can imagine the freedom we find from the things that we leave behind [Music] worshiping Goods we possess but Jesus says Lay All Your Treasures aside and love God above all the rest fast cause when we say no to the things of the world we open our hearts to the love of the Lord and it's hard to imagine the freedom we find from the things that we leave behind oh and it's hard to imagine the freedom we
