[33:10] been baptized into good evening it's
[33:13] good to see everyone here tonight in the
[33:15] house of the Lord and
[33:18] umen looks like we've got us some
[33:20] weather uh coming on and and so some uh
[33:24] especially those that have been uh that
[33:27] that have to travel a little bit they've
[33:30] they've decided to stay home and uh
[33:33] which is or to go home and uh which is
[33:36] probably pretty wise I I hear we could
[33:39] be getting a little bit uh toward the
[33:42] end of the the evening time I I think
[33:45] we'll have time for church and uh but
[33:48] later on this evening I I think it's
[33:50] going to start we have the possibility
[33:53] of course it's already freezing out and
[33:55] so uh um so we're we just want to keep
[33:59] praying for brother uh Steve and sister
[34:02] Karen as they are traveling and uh that
[34:05] the Lord will be with them amen well
[34:09] praise the Lord I trust everyone had had
[34:11] good lunch today and and um got all fat
[34:15] and
[34:16] Sassy you know um uh you get you know we
[34:21] we sure we sure enjoy we sure enjoy
[34:24] those those times at the fellowship hall
[34:27] and um uh but today we gave those ladies
[34:30] a break and we say God bless them love
[34:33] you all with all of our hearts if you
[34:36] have your Bibles we can look here in the
[34:37] Book of Genesis the 18th chapter and
[34:42] um we um are are going to just sort of
[34:47] continue our thoughts on the son of man
[34:50] and
[34:52] um um I you
[34:54] know uh the these these teachings that
[34:58] we have uh been doing we you know when
[35:02] you can't make it I I um I I I trust
[35:06] that you uh go back and listen online
[35:09] because I believe the spirit of the Lord
[35:12] is is is dealing in certain areas and
[35:15] and if it's God's if it's my
[35:17] responsibility to preach it it's your
[35:19] responsibility to listen and so every
[35:23] one of us we don't want to be uh we we
[35:25] need you need to hear every message that
[35:27] comes across this pulpit and so even
[35:30] when we can't make it um amen I know
[35:33] there's a lot of them out there but if
[35:35] if the Lord has placed you here then I
[35:38] think it's a good it's a good thing for
[35:40] us to hear the word that the Lord is is
[35:42] teaching to our church because the Lord
[35:45] is doing something um he works he he he
[35:49] works his his his spirit in in in veins
[35:53] as us preachers know amen the Lord just
[35:56] seem seems to work and and we all start
[35:58] feeling that same way and it just it's
[36:01] just the way the Lord works and so um I
[36:04] want to read we're going to to look here
[36:07] in the 18th chapter now this is dealing
[36:10] with the the Apostle or or
[36:14] Abraham and this is the fourth stage of
[36:19] Abraham's life now the 12th chapter was
[36:24] justification amen the then we skip a
[36:27] couple chapters the 15th chapter is
[36:30] sanctification you skip another couple
[36:32] chapters 17th chapter is is elshadai the
[36:37] almighty God this is the baptism of the
[36:40] Holy Ghost coming in but then real close
[36:44] to the 17th chapter we come into the
[36:46] 18th chapter and that's that fourth
[36:48] stage this is the stage of the Bride
[36:51] this is where the son of man comes to
[36:55] visit this is what Jesus is saying as it
[36:59] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[37:03] in the revealing of the son of man this
[37:06] is the revealing right here and here is
[37:08] in it's in Genesis 18
[37:11] And1 and the Lord appeared unto him in
[37:14] the plains of mammory and he sat in the
[37:16] tent Door In the Heat of the day and he
[37:18] lifted up his eyes and looked and low
[37:22] three men stood by him and when he saw
[37:25] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[37:28] door and bowed himself to the ground and
[37:30] said my Lord now he man if he didn't
[37:35] have the correct revelation of who God
[37:37] was if he hadn't gone through the
[37:39] process of justification sanctification

[40:57] and amen God bless you you may be
[41:02] seated now we just read where God
[41:05] appeared to him and he ate it then the
[41:10] 10th versary actually if we were just to
[41:13] the ninth verse and they said where is
[41:15] Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the
[41:18] tent and he
[41:20] said this is God I will certainly return
[41:23] unto thee according to the time of life
[41:25] and lo s Sarah thy wife shall have a
[41:29] son and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[41:33] which was behind him now Sarah now
[41:35] Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[41:38] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[41:40] Sarah after the manner of women
[41:42] therefore Sarah laughed with it in
[41:44] herself saying after I am waxed old
[41:47] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[41:50] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[41:53] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[41:57] of shity BR bear a child which am old is
[42:01] anything too hard for God to the Lord as
[42:05] at the time appointed I will return unto
[42:07] thee according to the time of life and
[42:09] Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied
[42:13] saying I laugh not for she was afraid
[42:16] and he said nay but thou D
[42:20] laugh and so we want to minister here
[42:24] this morning or this evening on a I
[42:26] always say morning at night and then uh
[42:29] night in the morning amen whatever it is
[42:32] this evening I want to title this the
[42:34] rising on the wings of the son of man
[42:39] amen the position of the elect is an
[42:41] incredible position it's the Bride of
[42:44] the Lord Jesus Christ amen I I can't
[42:47] think of anything greater there's not a
[42:49] greater age for sure now as we as we
[42:54] discussed for a moment there at at the
[42:56] very end of the service this morning and
[42:58] how that nature declares the the plan of
[43:02] God so beautifully you can you you God's
[43:05] expressed through nature you know he the
[43:08] son expresses the death burial and
[43:10] Resurrection the wheat plant shows the
[43:13] four stages of the church the nature
[43:17] amen we can see the chickens and the
[43:19] Hawks and the Eagles amen by the moon we
[43:22] can see the brides uh position in
[43:26] Christ's absence and and so we can see a
[43:30] lot of things and then brother brandham
[43:33] used the modern happenings to declare
[43:35] the spiritual world and and he he he
[43:39] says in the countdown he says but modern
[43:42] happenings is a forerunner of spiritual
[43:44] happenings now remember modern
[43:46] happenings are forerunners of the
[43:48] spiritual the natural as spiritual each
[43:51] happening accompany the other and only
[43:54] improved uh over for the other he says
[43:59] uh he says all the all the natural
[44:02] things are types of the spiritual he
[44:05] says now H how is that he says take take
[44:09] for One
[44:10] Transportation he says for the
[44:12] transportation was by the horse the next
[44:15] it was by automobile then science Builds
[44:18] an airplane but you see the first was
[44:21] one horsepower the car was maybe 20
[44:24] horsepower the airplane goes up to
[44:26] hundreds of horsepower see what it is
[44:29] it's just as we come on with the horse
[44:32] then the automobile was made the next
[44:34] thing was an airplane we just keep
[44:36] achieving on higher and higher going
[44:39] greater and greater this is the
[44:41] achievement of science this is the
[44:44] Forerunner this is a forerunner of
[44:46] spiritual things that has happened of
[44:49] God by his Spirit has been in his
[44:51] promised word and so when we when we
[44:55] look at this
[44:56] Amen brother bradam is is is showing how
[44:59] that we've gone from the horse and buggy
[45:01] and now here we are in in in this in
[45:04] this great rocket age amen and he and
[45:08] and it is incredible how civilization
[45:10] has been here for 6,000 years and amen
[45:13] and they rode the horse and
[45:15] buggy uh for for for nearly all those
[45:18] years and am man and they farmed and
[45:21] raised cattle there were no cars there
[45:23] were no trains there was no planes there
[45:24] were no space shuttles there were no
[45:26] Rockets there were amen this all started
[45:29] at the end of the 19th century Amen in
[45:32] the late 1800s when the automobile was
[45:34] first invented and then we can see the
[45:37] explosion of science I believe it was uh
[45:40] 1886 when the first driveable car uh um
[45:44] amen was was at first come in and of
[45:47] course amen it wouldn't it it wouldn't
[45:50] the people wouldn't really drive them
[45:52] until uh the you know
[45:54] 1908 and and and when when Ford began to
[45:59] mass-produce the Model T and thus
[46:01] replacing the the horsedrawn carriages
[46:04] amen 1909 here comes the Wright brothers
[46:07] and they are they and they they they
[46:10] built the first two seater in in uh um
[46:15] uh air you know seat aircraft in
[46:18] 1909 amen now they had been working on
[46:20] it in the early night and earlier than
[46:22] that but this was the first time that
[46:25] that that any uh uh passengers could
[46:28] ride on that and then of course we we
[46:32] know that in
[46:34] 1961 rocket propelled uh the first human
[46:37] into space and and and we can see how
[46:41] quickly things changed amen and it was
[46:44] right about the time when a prophet was
[46:46] going to be on the earth and the prophet
[46:49] was was going to not be a an
[46:53] intellectual giant this was going to be
[46:55] be a a man that didn't go to school he
[46:58] was going to be a man that's that's that
[47:00] that doesn't have the Seminary training
[47:03] amen but yet God was going to expect
[47:05] this man to share the depth of his word
[47:10] to the Common People amen because the
[47:13] depths of God's word the common people
[47:15] were going to have to have in order to
[47:17] make the Rapture amen and so God uh uh
[47:21] so brother brandham used he he used
[47:25] Hypes and shadows he he seen God in the
[47:28] nature and he seen and and and so God
[47:32] Amen provided lots of material for
[47:35] brother Bram as he as as he looked at
[47:38] the nature and he saw the trees and he
[47:40] saw the moon and he saw the stars and
[47:43] and and he saw amen the wheat plant and
[47:47] and when Brother bradam begin to notice
[47:50] amen it's incredible how when the
[47:52] seventh angel comes on the Earth all of
[47:55] a sudden amen about that same time here
[47:58] comes science just really uh uh coming
[48:01] in and and and and of course Daniel was
[48:05] told there in in Daniel 12:4 Amen it
[48:09] says that many shall run to and fro at
[48:12] the end amen he says but thou old Daniel
[48:15] shut up the words and seal the book even
[48:17] to the time of the end many shall run to
[48:20] and fro and knowledge shall be increased
[48:24] amen and so we can see amen that that
[48:28] God had had begin to to allow things to
[48:32] be done the the the anointing was upon
[48:35] the Earth to declare what God was doing
[48:38] in the spiritual realm we went from
[48:40] horse and then to car and then to plane
[48:43] and then to Rocket Amen brother brandham
[48:46] would say he says one day there was a
[48:48] horse and buggy and then we got the
[48:50] Automobiles and that's still horsepower
[48:53] but more of it in the automob moile it
[48:56] was an improvement of the horsepower and
[48:57] certainly we got the automobile it was
[49:00] an advantage over the horse and buggy
[49:02] and then we rode the horse and buggy and
[49:04] and then we took the automobile and then
[49:06] after the automobile the right Brothers
[49:08] come along and made an airplane still
[49:11] horse power but it's an improvement one
[49:13] accompanies the other one happening
[49:16] accompanies amen or types the the other
[49:19] happenings all the time now don't fail
[49:22] to get this open up ears heart and
[49:26] everything now and listen close when
[49:29] anything happens on the earth it is a
[49:32] warning to us that something is fixing
[49:34] to happen from Heaven what a what man
[49:37] does on Earth by his achievement is
[49:40] something that God is going to do by his
[49:42] achievement to the church in to his
[49:44] church now we look and and we can see
[49:46] the horse and buggy the automobile the
[49:48] airplane God is being able in the
[49:51] spiritual line to achieve from
[49:54] justification through Luther
[49:56] sanctification through Wesley through
[49:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now see
[50:01] it's a type Shadow achievement of what
[50:04] God has been able to do he says now
[50:07] remember God by Luther with the holy
[50:09] ghost power was able to achieve by
[50:11] Luther to the church justification and
[50:14] when the church got justification out of
[50:17] out of Roman Creeds and began to get
[50:20] life and begin to move through
[50:21] justification God was able to do it
[50:24] through his achievement to get one man
[50:27] to stand still long enough that he could
[50:29] project himself through and get his
[50:30] message out to the people all right the
[50:33] next achievement God was able to do by
[50:36] John Wesley to stand still enough to get
[50:40] away from the Lutheran Creeds where it
[50:42] had got to to preach sanctification then
[50:44] the church come from the horse and buggy
[50:46] to the automobile it's got more life and
[50:49] started running a little it it got got
[50:51] to go a little faster then and then
[50:54] there come and ausa Street where they
[50:57] left the ground and HIIT the air through
[50:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost God
[51:01] through the church from an Earthbound
[51:04] Creed uh God took the church from an
[51:06] Earthbound Creed into a solo flight in
[51:09] the air just as the airplane come in the
[51:12] Holy Ghost come in behind it see that's
[51:15] right justification horse and buggy
[51:18] sanctification automobile baptism of the
[51:20] Holy Ghost it took off the ground got
[51:23] her feet off the ground flying around in
[51:25] the Heavenly places in the in the
[51:27] heavenlies with Heavenly gifts speaking
[51:29] in tongues Divine Healing amen and and
[51:33] and so you you can see what God is doing
[51:36] God is showing the bride is not going to
[51:39] get less the bride is going to come
[51:43] greater the bride doesn't go up in
[51:45] Pentecost 1906 and then fall to the
[51:48] ground no no no no no no no no no sir
[51:52] this last stage is the Great greatest
[51:56] stage and I'm wanting to show you
[51:58] tonight through some quotes and I am
[52:00] going to give you quite a few quotes if
[52:02] you want to to to take a few notes amen
[52:05] uh uh and I know this is Sunday night so
[52:07] I I I'll try to monitor how much I do
[52:11] but but I want to show you that God's
[52:14] plan when we say the son of man is not
[52:18] directly tied uh uh just to brother
[52:21] brandham but it is this last day AG of
[52:26] the church now now brother bradam would
[52:29] go on and and he he would say now the
[52:31] pillar of fire moved down and they come
[52:34] to zusa Street here in California and
[52:37] and then what did it do it represented
[52:39] the airplane days man was Able by the
[52:42] right Brothers to achieve an airplane
[52:45] that could fly immediately uh for for
[52:48] running that the zusa street fell and
[52:52] man took to the air and the supernatural
[52:54] to the unknown he spoke with tongues he
[52:56] done unknown things that was foreign to
[52:59] the church because he took off from the
[53:01] ground he he he he he left into the air
[53:05] and what did it immediately after the
[53:07] airplanes come on he took to the air God
[53:10] showed by the airplanes that his church
[53:12] was arising he showed by the Natural
[53:15] Things what's happening in the spiritual
[53:17] amen now he goes on down and he says now
[53:21] he he says John Wesley found
[53:22] sanctification now he never condemned
[53:24] justif ification he only added more
[53:27] power when the Pentecostals found the
[53:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[53:30] restoration of the gifts they never
[53:31] denied sanctification or justification
[53:34] they just got more power praise God he
[53:38] went up because he found more power amen
[53:42] now uh he says now from isusa the the
[53:46] Plaines took off then the great Revival
[53:48] swept amen the unknown places and the
[53:51] and and and unknown tongues and the
[53:53] gifts and and those kinds of things but
[53:56] then he says but but we've got but now
[53:59] we're in the astronaut age and in that
[54:03] astronaut age we're free you don't have
[54:06] to come back down you don't have to amen
[54:09] you you you get in that capsule and you
[54:11] just leave the the the gravity of Earth
[54:15] behind you're free amen there's no
[54:18] gravity there can you say amen and so
[54:21] we're not going to go uh uh uh through
[54:23] any more of those quotes but now I want
[54:26] us to just stop and look because he's
[54:28] now he has talked about man the three
[54:31] stages astronaut being the fourth amen
[54:35] he goes on now and he and he begins to
[54:38] talk about the stages of Abraham's life
[54:41] and as I said while ago Genesis 12
[54:45] Justified right Genesis 15
[54:49] Sanctified Genesis 17 baptism Genesis 18
[54:55] the placing now I'm going to read this
[54:58] to you amen and and um uh I hope you get
[55:02] a blessing out of some of this because
[55:04] we have been teaching on it for a few
[55:06] Services now and I I I just like I I I I
[55:10] I listen I I think that it's so
[55:11] important to catch what brother brandham
[55:14] is trying to get to the
[55:16] church amen this this this appearing of
[55:19] the son of man affected Abraham and
[55:21] Sarah very much so amen it changed their
[55:25] lives they've been waiting on this
[55:27] promise and it only come from the name
[55:29] change after the name had changed after
[55:33] God had changed Abraham's name changed
[55:36] Sarah's name then they could bring on
[55:38] and I'm here to tell you we've had a
[55:40] name change amen we're not the
[55:43] Pentecostal L ofans we are the the the
[55:47] Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now
[55:51] brother Brenham would say he says now
[55:53] what did he do made the Covenant with
[55:54] Abra Abraham say it with me Abraham and
[55:57] his
[55:59] seed what is the Seed of Abraham born
[56:02] again man and woman that's filled with
[56:05] the Holy Ghost oh now brother Brandon
[56:08] all right we'll see if he kept his
[56:10] promise Abraham in Genesis 12 was
[56:13] justified called out by justification
[56:15] and believed God's word is that right so
[56:17] was the church in Martin Luther is that
[56:20] right Genesis 15 uh the 15th chapter he
[56:23] was separated when he complet obeyed
[56:26] confirmed the Covenant to him by the
[56:28] blood Hebrews 13:12 and and 13 Jesus
[56:32] suffered without the gate that he might
[56:34] sanctify the people with his own blood
[56:36] is that right what did he send a message
[56:39] to the earth a messenger who was it in
[56:42] the Philadelphian age John Wesley
[56:44] preaching sanctification and that's when
[56:46] he confirmed it and separated them from
[56:49] sin and he believed through
[56:51] sanctification Genesis 12 he confirmed
[56:54] the blood the Covenant by Blood spilling
[56:56] the blood of a ram and so forth on the
[56:59] 15th chapter SEC and Sanctified the
[57:02] church now the 17th
[57:05] chapter he took the Holy Spirit he gave
[57:08] the Holy Spirit notice I El Shai now
[57:11] remember he's going to receive something
[57:13] in him amen from God now he's going to
[57:16] has strength like the Baby draws the the
[57:19] mother's own strength from the body of

[57:41] to his weak child that's confessed his
[57:44] faith and to give him strength for
[57:46] something he's ready to do something for
[57:48] him now justification Abraham
[57:51] justification Genesis 12 Martin Luther
[57:54] see of Abraham sanctification 15
[57:57] confirmation of the uh uh Genesis 15
[58:00] confirmation of the Covenant amen John

[58:23] it to the Pentecostals the holy ghost
[58:25] drawing God's own life right out into
[58:28] them he he he did it in the natural
[58:30] there he's doing it in the spiritual
[58:32] here Abraham's seed Abraham and his seed
[58:35] after him you get what I mean now now
[58:38] remember the church is still advancing
[58:40] now also in in the 18th chapter listen
[58:45] you may disagree with this brother now
[58:47] you will think Martin Le Luther will
[58:49] believe uh anything else but
[58:51] justification no sir that was his age he
[58:54] believed I I I believe he'll come in the
[58:56] resurrection amen it goes on down he
[58:58] says we're in Genesis
[59:01] 18 uh still in the 18th verse and let's
[59:04] watch then he taken him that second
[59:07] thing that he' done the first thing
[59:09] justification 12th chapter 15th was a
[59:13] chapter he gave sanctification 18th or
[59:16] if he meant the 17th he gave the Holy
[59:19] Ghost it says now uh uh at the end watch
[59:23] here look quickly all these others took
[59:26] years are you listening don't you love
[59:29] it all these years from justification to
[59:32] sanctification was a lap of years from
[59:34] sanctification till the confirmation of
[59:37] the Holy Ghost was years but in the same
[59:40] chapter he placed him after the Holy
[59:45] Ghost Pentecostal Pentecost is just
[59:48] 40-some years old you know and he began
[59:51] to place his his sons Martin Luther
[59:53] preached justification years and years
[59:55] and years come San uh just Martin Luther
[59:59] preached justification years and years
[1:00:00] and years came sanctification years and
[1:00:02] years and years come the baptism of the
[1:00:04] Holy Ghost but right quick after the
[1:00:07] Pentecost did the same thing the rest of
[1:00:10] them did and then he began to pull his

[1:03:52] filling it's a dip
[1:03:55] but when the word come that's when

[1:04:28] fullness of the Holy Ghost in
[1:04:32] flesh okay manifesting the promised word
[1:04:36] in the bride body giving the word life
[1:04:40] now brother brenon would put it this way
[1:04:43] he says the church has now served and
[1:04:44] I've quoted this for the last four
[1:04:46] Services the church but I'm but I'm
[1:04:48] finally reading it the church now has
[1:04:51] served the term through the church age
[1:04:54] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:04:57] Jesus said here making Malachi 4 and the
[1:05:01] rest of these scriptures real to you in
[1:05:04] the last days just before the coming the
[1:05:07] world sitting uh will be like Sodom and
[1:05:10] the son of man will reveal himself as
[1:05:14] the son of man like he did in the days
[1:05:17] of Sodom now now before we can we
[1:05:20] continue There we want to say the son of
[1:05:23] man was a prophet the prophet Ministry
[1:05:26] yes that was the son of man that was God
[1:05:29] in flesh that appeared unto
[1:05:32] Abraham but what did God in flesh
[1:05:35] do all right his words were now going to
[1:05:40] take effect to two old people sure right
[1:05:45] and the promise that Abraham had been
[1:05:49] waiting on and hoping for and yet so far
[1:05:54] far out of its
[1:05:56] grasp was now visible right there before
[1:06:01] him and he says according to the time of
[1:06:04] life you're going to have a son now it
[1:06:08] sounded so impossible to to Sarah that
[1:06:10] she started laughing and saying but no
[1:06:12] no no no the words from the son of man
[1:06:17] had changed the lives of two two old
[1:06:21] people that's good right well praise the
[1:06:24] Lord what is this son of man today you
[1:06:26] say well if the son of man was here it
[1:06:28] would have to be Jesus Christ Amen
[1:06:30] brother brother Bram would say amen he
[1:06:34] he he would say the son of man uh he he
[1:06:37] he would say uh blind prosecutor can't
[1:06:41] you see that his words are true not nail
[1:06:45] scars and Prince and
[1:06:49] Thorns now now we're not looking for
[1:06:51] nail scars prints and Thorns when Christ
[1:06:54] appears as the son of man in this
[1:06:57] day how is he going to appear he's going
[1:07:00] to appear as Prophet
[1:07:02] God to call out a people to himself and
[1:07:06] a prophetic people are going to receive
[1:07:09] the power of the Holy
[1:07:10] Spirit well can you say Amen now now
[1:07:14] brother brandham would say in another
[1:07:16] place he says now we say he's raised
[1:07:18] from the dead I didn't say it the word
[1:07:20] said it they they said he's raised uh
[1:07:24] he's raised from the dead he says he's
[1:07:26] the same yesterday today and forever you
[1:07:29] believe that he promised these things
[1:07:31] would happen in the last days that the
[1:07:34] same son of man will be made manifest
[1:07:37] now remember Jesus was not talking to
[1:07:40] Abraham there that could discern the
[1:07:42] thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him this
[1:07:44] was not Jesus he had not been born he
[1:07:47] had not been yet born but it was a man
[1:07:51] in human flesh that a Abraham called
[1:07:56] Elohim the great God well glory to God
[1:08:01] so so wasn't Jesus back there Jesus
[1:08:03] wasn't born Jesus was born he only had
[1:08:05] 33 years here on the Earth but it was
[1:08:08] the great God that lived in the body of
[1:08:11] Jesus that appeared unto Abraham and
[1:08:14] it's the same Elohim in this last day
[1:08:18] that has appeared in the body of his
[1:08:21] bride right amen now they're in the
[1:08:26] trial 64 brother Bram would say it's the
[1:08:30] Son of God impersonated in his church as
[1:08:34] son of man it has to fulfill Malachi 4
[1:08:38] and the rest of the scriptures I call
[1:08:40] the courts attention look look at that
[1:08:43] real good son of man like God the Father
[1:08:47] God the son God the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:08:49] same thing it's the same God three
[1:08:51] different attributes of the same God now
[1:08:53] this is is the son of David or the a son
[1:08:56] of man revealed then as a prophet the
[1:08:58] son of David the king and now the Son of
[1:09:01] God to the church age as as as as God
[1:09:05] isn't man God is a spirit and the spirit
[1:09:07] the son is the Holy Ghost which which is
[1:09:10] revealing the the church Age The Promise
[1:09:13] here is in these last days the son of
[1:09:16] man would be revealed blind prosecutor
[1:09:19] do you get that I want you to know blind
[1:09:22] prosecutor we we see it we believe it
[1:09:26] these words fulfilled before us and we
[1:09:28] know that they are true to the Jews he
[1:09:31] was son of David to the Greeks he was
[1:09:33] Lord to us he's Lord to the Gentiles now
[1:09:36] in the last days he would return back as
[1:09:39] the son of man because Malachi promised
[1:09:41] us that there would be a prophet rise in
[1:09:43] the last days that would return the
[1:09:46] hearts of the the people back away from
[1:09:49] their or them organizations back to the
[1:09:51] original word the faith of the fathers
[1:09:53] the original Pentecost he says and when
[1:09:56] he did it John 14:12 The Works that that
[1:09:59] he did would be done also Revelations 10
[1:10:03] promises the whole mystery how you going
[1:10:06] to reveal those Mysteries you see what
[1:10:08] Luther left off what Wesley left off
[1:10:11] what Pentecost left off and then to
[1:10:13] reveal the secret of the heart to make
[1:10:15] it the same God through every age which
[1:10:18] is nothing but God's word made manifest
[1:10:20] back to the son of man again we don't
[1:10:23] look for nail scars we look for the word
[1:10:27] made
[1:10:28] manifest notice god promise these things
[1:10:32] now and he does it just as he said now
[1:10:37] amen so are are you staying with that
[1:10:39] then now you understand there got to be
[1:10:41] a prophet it is a the son of man is God
[1:10:44] in flesh through a prophet coming in
[1:10:48] amen because there is there is something
[1:10:51] he's not just here those words
[1:10:54] now now when when uh the son of man
[1:10:58] appeared unto Abraham now he didn't just
[1:11:00] do it just to make himself feel good
[1:11:03] Hallelujah he done it because there was
[1:11:05] a people that the promise had to be
[1:11:08] quickened to right are y'all hearing me
[1:11:12] yes sir all right now now brother how
[1:11:15] how many how many's following me so far
[1:11:17] yeah all right sir brother Bram would
[1:11:20] say the first three stages of them that
[1:11:23] went through the Dark Ages and then the
[1:11:26] third stage comes at the the the church
[1:11:28] comes out from
[1:11:31] justification
[1:11:33] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:36] incarnate God made manifest Among Us
[1:11:41] somebody say
[1:11:43] justification
[1:11:46] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:49] incarnate God made manifest Among Us
[1:11:53] amen he's incarnate God made manifest
[1:11:55] Among Us here he comes as the Antichrist
[1:11:57] as the false prophet and the the then
[1:12:00] the Beast and the Dark Age and this is
[1:12:03] in the the third seal but he but he's uh
[1:12:06] uh it says and then the church comes out
[1:12:07] of those Dark Age justification now he's
[1:12:09] going to go back over it again he's
[1:12:11] going back over it
[1:12:13] justification
[1:12:14] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:17] Incarnate Word the way
[1:12:21] now okay that that
[1:12:24] that should make you want to
[1:12:28] shout the holy spirit that fell on was a
[1:12:32] baptism in
[1:12:33] 1906 but it wasn't it wasn't anything
[1:12:38] that could produce a promise yes sir it
[1:12:41] could not produce what God was looking
[1:12:44] for God had when when God came down in
[1:12:48] person it has to be the son of man and
[1:12:52] the son of man man can only come through
[1:12:56] a prophet listen to me up there in the
[1:12:58] sound booth amen here it comes
[1:13:01] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:13:04] the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word now here's
[1:13:07] another one in the Masterpiece it says
[1:13:10] notice here the life that was in the
[1:13:12] husk in the stalk in the tsel in the all
[1:13:16] gathers in the in the seed the life that
[1:13:20] was in in in the stock he says
[1:13:22] justification made way for
[1:13:24] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:13:26] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:13:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:13:31] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[1:13:34] in Perfection back to the word again to
[1:13:40] manifest itself okay
[1:13:44] okay amen now let's just call let's just
[1:13:48] call this Abraham and Sarah right here
[1:13:51] hallelujah amen that's right here
[1:13:54] they had gone chapter 12 they had gone
[1:13:57] chapter 15 okay chapter 17 but something
[1:14:01] was taking place right here when Prophet
[1:14:04] God came down the word was going to come
[1:14:07] off the printed page and would take on
[1:14:12] flesh
[1:14:14] right they were fixing to have the baby
[1:14:19] yes that they had been waiting for yes
[1:14:22] sir
[1:14:24] yes whatever took place right here was
[1:14:28] so powerful that the king in
[1:14:32] the later on in the in the 19th Chapter
[1:14:36] the 19th Chapter the king wanted Sarah
[1:14:38] for his
[1:14:41] wife whatever took place whatever took
[1:14:45] place whatever the son of man that
[1:14:48] conversation with the son of man
[1:14:51] produced something in the body now they
[1:14:54] were just they were just types God used
[1:14:58] them for types to show you who you are
[1:15:02] now I'm trying now I don't want to make
[1:15:04] this real complicated and am am I making
[1:15:06] it too complicated I don't want this to
[1:15:08] be complicated I and I don't and I don't
[1:15:11] want you kids looking out at at at at at
[1:15:15] denominationalism as if they've got
[1:15:17] something to offer they might have a lot
[1:15:20] of music and and and a lot of things
[1:15:22] like that the son of man cannot be was
[1:15:28] was never in any of these
[1:15:31] ages it can only it we're we're talking
[1:15:34] about God taking us back to
[1:15:37] Pentecost we're talking about dead race
[1:15:40] blind seeing deaf hearing we're talking
[1:15:44] about the
[1:15:48] supernatural Hallelujah you see what I'm
[1:15:51] saying we have have a right to expect
[1:15:56] God's word to live in
[1:16:02] us but it's not going to be just from
[1:16:04] the letter of the word the token life
[1:16:07] there's where the problem is with the
[1:16:09] message churches they've said they've
[1:16:13] taken they've taken the saying that
[1:16:15] they've got the Holy Ghost and and and
[1:16:17] and and and there's and there's nothing
[1:16:19] applied there there's there's and and
[1:16:21] what happens is the M churches have
[1:16:25] taken on easy believism it's nothing but
[1:16:28] a Baptist
[1:16:30] Dogma about it yeah that says all you
[1:16:33] have to do is believe and you've got the
[1:16:36] Holy Ghost brother bradam spent his
[1:16:38] entire life amen saying no believing is
[1:16:41] not the Holy Ghost come on come
[1:16:44] on
[1:16:46] Amen and and when the when you remember
[1:16:48] when the Baptist preacher came up to him
[1:16:49] and told him uh uh uh well I believe do
[1:16:52] you believe that Abraham believ and he
[1:16:53] was accepted imputed for righteous he
[1:16:54] said yes I do he says he says well then
[1:16:58] amen uh uh he says then then uh that
[1:17:01] that's the way we we believe un
[1:17:03] salvation and brother Bram
[1:17:06] says but he says what did he do after he
[1:17:10] believed and it was imputed unto him he
[1:17:12] went for circumcision which was a type
[1:17:15] of the circumcision of the heart the
[1:17:19] baptism are y'all
[1:17:21] understanding any question questions now
[1:17:23] come on there's now don't be waiting
[1:17:24] till after church and then because your
[1:17:28] dumb
[1:17:29] questions might help some of us other
[1:17:32] dummies amen so don't there is no dumb
[1:17:36] questions and while we're small here
[1:17:38] tonight uh uh just just say it because I
[1:17:41] can I I really do see a few uh puzzled
[1:17:44] looks
[1:17:46] amen I understand when you say that the
[1:17:50] church ages has four steps yes I
[1:17:54] understand that you made the comment
[1:17:58] that we only need the justification
[1:18:00] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[1:18:02] Ghost yes but isn't there a part of that
[1:18:05] Holy Ghost for the for the bride of
[1:18:08] Christ because it's a promise it's a
[1:18:11] it's a token but on Earth today we have
[1:18:15] we have been lifted up in power to speak
[1:18:18] demons out is that just in because of
[1:18:22] the Holy Ghost because you got you got
[1:18:24] all the gifts you got all those things
[1:18:25] working with that part isn't that
[1:18:29] another step in our life yes it is but
[1:18:34] you can't it no no well but you you you
[1:18:38] but you've got to understand it there is
[1:18:41] never been okay let's go back let's go
[1:18:43] back to Pentecost they were Justified
[1:18:46] they were Sanctified brother Bram showed
[1:18:48] us the justification and then and then
[1:18:51] uh uh and then they were uh
[1:18:53] Sanctified amen and brother brandom said
[1:18:55] that that Judas was justified Sanctified
[1:18:58] but could not go to the baptism of the
[1:19:00] Holy Ghost okay so when they got to the
[1:19:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost did they have
[1:19:05] to wait for the fourth
[1:19:08] step before they went and healed the
[1:19:12] sick raised the
[1:19:16] dead well that that was when the Holy
[1:19:19] Ghost was that was when the Holy Ghost
[1:19:21] was on their spirit but this year was a
[1:19:24] filling it was it was the Divine filling
[1:19:27] that has been promised to this
[1:19:29] age they did not have to wait for four
[1:19:33] days or 10 days or 10 years to to to to
[1:19:37] find out if they're good enough to find
[1:19:39] out if okay amen now now I'm I'm now I
[1:19:42] can be adopted they were the Apostle
[1:19:46] Paul the Apostle Paul says we have
[1:19:49] received the spirit of adoption right it
[1:19:54] it was the Holy Ghost it was that third
[1:19:58] stage but brother branam was telling
[1:20:03] brother brandham was telling the
[1:20:05] Pentecostals in the adoption
[1:20:07] series you've received the
[1:20:13] baptism but adoption time's
[1:20:16] coming you've got your three stages but
[1:20:19] adoption time is on its way they were
[1:20:23] they were they were ready to put brother
[1:20:26] brandham out aside brother brandham was
[1:20:28] already being pushed aside by the
[1:20:30] 1960 you know his his teaching but not
[1:20:33] you know he was he was preaching in 57
[1:20:35] and 58 and he was already but but listen
[1:20:37] to me brother brother bradam was telling
[1:20:40] them you've got a baptism you and
[1:20:42] another place brother bradam says you've
[1:20:44] got a
[1:20:48] dip when did when did when did
[1:20:51] Revelations 10 when the mighty Angel
[1:20:53] come to Earth with the open book when
[1:20:54] was
[1:20:56] that
[1:20:59] 1963 so let's put it this
[1:21:05] way
[1:21:08] 1906 let me get a different color here
[1:21:11] so it'll stand
[1:21:12] up I like different
[1:21:14] colors
[1:21:18] 1906 and these guys the the Pentecostals
[1:21:21] were happy
[1:21:23] they said they

[1:23:49] past your threes over and over and over
[1:23:51] baptism or or the justification
[1:23:53] sanctification baptism but anytime when
[1:23:56] he was dealing with the bride tree he
[1:24:00] says it was four stages of death and
[1:24:04] it'll be four stages of Resurrection
[1:24:07] right okay uh uh uh how how did how did
[1:24:11] that go the Palmer worm po uh uh
[1:24:15] cankerworm uh caterpillar the Locust and

[1:24:35] beginning okay okay
[1:24:39] amen but don't substitute knowledge
[1:24:42] we're not in the
[1:24:43] managee don't substitute knowledge for
[1:24:47] the Revelation and the power of the Holy
[1:24:49] Spirit today that's
[1:24:51] right Hallelujah it had to take brother
[1:24:55] brother bham had to come in and preach
[1:24:57] the way he preached and bring out these
[1:24:59] depths so that you could understand who
[1:25:02] you are in this day not to make you a an
[1:25:05] intellectual giant did that answer your
[1:25:09] question let me let let me show
[1:25:15] you I'm just looking at how how when I
[1:25:20] was struggling through sanctification
[1:25:22] when I got filled with baptism the it
[1:25:25] settled me but then that hunger I wanted
[1:25:28] more well of the power of God well is
[1:25:32] that all in that Holy you know that's
[1:25:34] where I'm looking at yeah I you know
[1:25:36] with with me studying along these lines
[1:25:38] with with me coming along these lines
[1:25:40] I'm I'm uh uh you know
[1:25:43] I you
[1:25:45] know
[1:25:48] um the the the you you and I and maybe a
[1:25:53] lot of us might have come through that
[1:25:56] third sta or that that third stage of
[1:25:58] restoration we might have received we we
[1:26:02] might have re received a touch of the
[1:26:04] Holy Ghost and and and and yet we did
[1:26:07] not come on into that fullness and we're
[1:26:09] not adopted but you don't have
[1:26:12] to you you can you can you can receive
[1:26:16] the genuine power of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:19] right now tonight not have to wait for
[1:26:21] another before you receive the the
[1:26:24] genuine power you see what I'm saying
[1:26:27] now you
[1:26:28] know okay I know we're online and I
[1:26:31] don't I it's so I uh uh I I've been I've
[1:26:36] been talking with preachers lately just
[1:26:38] you know sharing my you know trying to
[1:26:41] and and um I so I talked to Donnie
[1:26:44] Reagan and um and and just ask brother
[1:26:47] Donnie now you're a Pentecostal boy so I
[1:26:51] was telling I I I I I'll tell you man I
[1:26:55] I have I I I I I have preached that
[1:27:00] 1963 anyone who received the genuine or
[1:27:03] receiv received the Holy Ghost from 1963
[1:27:05] received the genuine holy ghost in 1963
[1:27:09] Donnie brother
[1:27:10] Donnie he he says he says that he feels
[1:27:14] like he went through all four of those
[1:27:15] stages here he says that he he he says
[1:27:19] you know he was like me seen Miracles
[1:27:21] performed formed wonders signs but he
[1:27:24] says but when he come into the message
[1:27:27] it was not just a a a cleansing of his
[1:27:30] mind he he he he believes that that that
[1:27:34] brother that brother bradam taught and
[1:27:36] and I and I can see that that the token
[1:27:38] as I preached this morning the token
[1:27:41] could only come the token life could
[1:27:44] only come after the word the the the the
[1:27:49] message of the Hour come right right and
[1:27:52] and so we might have had a dip when
[1:27:54] Martin might have had a dip in Pentecost
[1:27:56] but when I come into the message and
[1:27:58] maybe that's why we were so unstable in
[1:28:00] Pentecost there was nothing to stabilize
[1:28:02] this but it was more than just somebody
[1:28:05] bringing a a h a a new form this here is
[1:28:10] not a new form of thinking but it's the
[1:28:14] Holy Ghost itself upon
[1:28:18] us so in that case
[1:28:22] is it possible that these kids
[1:28:25] can get the anointing upon their spirit
[1:28:28] and not upon upon their soul well you
[1:28:31] know I I yeah I think that I think we
[1:28:33] can do that I think we can it can fall
[1:28:36] Upon Our flesh and we do man we we
[1:28:38] manifest things and but what we're
[1:28:40] wanting is a
[1:28:42] birth it's a word birth y y'all Y am I
[1:28:46] making more sense am I making sense
[1:28:48] there so so and brother Bram says this
[1:28:51] is is a word birth and so I've talked
[1:28:55] with brother Brown uh brother Donnie
[1:28:56] I've talked with brother Tim um brother
[1:28:59] sha brother Wayne I've talked I've
[1:29:01] talked with several uh along those lines
[1:29:04] and just seeing you know where where
[1:29:06] they see the son of man and and so the
[1:29:10] but in this in this briad time in this
[1:29:13] in this son of man
[1:29:15] season amen uh uh let let me let let me
[1:29:20] show you um
[1:29:25] praise the
[1:29:26] Lord someone have anything to
[1:29:32] say long
[1:29:35] awaited restoration
[1:29:39] sorry well I I would ra what in the
[1:29:44] world
[1:29:46] um no no you uh I I I would rather you
[1:29:50] all understand what where where we're
[1:29:51] going here and so um okay so brother
[1:29:56] brandham said
[1:29:59] now the church age book he says
[1:30:06] um he says this age started just at the
[1:30:09] turn of the 20th century as it as it was
[1:30:12] to be the age in which the true church
[1:30:14] would return to being the Bride As she
[1:30:18] was at Pentecost y'all getting tired of
[1:30:19] me showing you bride
[1:30:23] Pentecost all right this is that's
[1:30:25] that's that's this is the time now he
[1:30:28] says he says uh uh as it as it was to be
[1:30:33] the age in which the true church would
[1:30:35] return to being the bride she was at
[1:30:38] Pentecost we know that there must of
[1:30:40] necessity be a return of dynamic power
[1:30:43] the belie Believers sense this and in
[1:30:44] their spirits and begin to crying for to
[1:30:47] God for a new outpouring which was in
[1:30:50] the first century what what seemed to be
[1:30:53] the answer came as many begin to
[1:30:55] speaking in tongues and manifest gifts
[1:30:58] of the Spirit it was then believ that
[1:31:00] this was indeed the long awaited
[1:31:02] restoration it was not it was if for the
[1:31:07] latter rain could only uh the latter
[1:31:10] rain can come only after the former rain
[1:31:14] which is the spring or the teaching rain
[1:31:16] the latter rain then is the Harvest rain
[1:31:19] what uh how could this be the real thing
[1:31:22] when the teaching Reign had not come the
[1:31:25] prophet messenger who was sent to teach
[1:31:28] the people and turn the hearts back to
[1:31:30] the Pentecostal fathers had not come yet
[1:31:33] thus what was thought to be the
[1:31:37] restoration and the the final quaking
[1:31:39] unto the Rapture had not come in it was
[1:31:43] a mixture of unrighteous uh partaking of
[1:31:46] spiritual blessings manifesting in the
[1:31:48] Holy Ghost as we kept pointing out to
[1:31:50] you and it was also devil Powers men was
[1:31:53] under the control of devils yet no one
[1:31:55] seemed to notice it then to prove that
[1:31:58] it was not real then these people after
[1:31:59] the second generation had appeared
[1:32:01] organized wrote their unscriptural
[1:32:03] doctrines built their fences as every
[1:32:05] other group did before them so what they
[1:32:09] thought was the N this as the as as
[1:32:14] justification
[1:32:16] sanctification and as and then this as
[1:32:20] as they had at pent
[1:32:22] cost they said it was well that wasn't
[1:32:25] it that that wasn't it it was the shuck
[1:32:28] it was a dip of the spirit that was upon
[1:32:32] them but it was not the final
[1:32:36] restoration that would come from a word
[1:32:39] birth that they had at Pentecost
[1:32:42] okay y'all
[1:32:44] catching amen any
[1:32:50] questions amen all right so so see that
[1:32:53] question there helped others did that
[1:32:54] did that help that that show you why
[1:32:57] sister Carol we spoke in tongues before
[1:33:00] we come and we had all of those
[1:33:02] manifestations but the word had to come
[1:33:06] that word was the adoptions that's the
[1:33:09] time that's what the cloud was about
[1:33:12] when God took a prophet and the and and
[1:33:15] the Seven Angels Came Down the
[1:33:18] consummation of all Seven Ages all come
[1:33:22] together in a prophet over there in
[1:33:24] Arizona and told him go back and preach
[1:33:28] or open the Seven Seals right it that
[1:33:32] was the adoption time that was that was
[1:33:36] that that was the season now whether or
[1:33:38] not you've come into that adoption
[1:33:40] that's what I'm saying that was what my
[1:33:42] preaching was this
[1:33:44] morning we've got to come into that
[1:33:47] don't just take a little manif a little
[1:33:50] feeling or an emotion but that there's a
[1:33:52] word birth that'll produce the realities
[1:33:56] of this word in your
[1:34:00] bodies any other
[1:34:02] questions praise the
[1:34:05] Lord all right how many how many's game
[1:34:07] for a little
[1:34:09] longer all right so now this son of man
[1:34:13] could no could not come to Earth except
[1:34:16] through a
[1:34:18] prophet through through a prophet so it
[1:34:20] had to be amen that Mighty angel had to
[1:34:24] come directly to the seventh angel
[1:34:27] Messenger on the earth he would declare
[1:34:29] the
[1:34:30] book can you say Amen now now let's let
[1:34:35] let's let's uh let's just continue on
[1:34:37] amen he said that the sounding brother
[1:34:39] Brandon would say at the sounding of the
[1:34:41] seventh Angels message the mystery of
[1:34:43] God should be finished that's been
[1:34:45] declared uh By His holy prophets that's
[1:34:48] the prophets who has wrote the book at
[1:34:51] the sound of ing of the seventh Church
[1:34:52] age the last Church age all the lucans
[1:34:56] that through these Church ages have been
[1:34:57] probed at will be wound together when
[1:35:00] when the seals are broke and the Mystery
[1:35:03] is revealed down comes the angel the
[1:35:06] messenger Christ setting his foot upon
[1:35:09] land and upon sea with the rainbow over
[1:35:11] his head now remember the seventh angel
[1:35:15] is on Earth at the time of this coming
[1:35:19] amen so when when that when that coming
[1:35:23] when that when Christ steps forth
[1:35:26] Revelations 10:1 then the mighty or then
[1:35:29] that Earthly Angel would be here at that
[1:35:32] time all right how many's with me so

[1:56:40] God coming Upon Us
[1:56:44] amen sin has vanished fear has vanished
[1:56:48] have I left anybody confused tonight any
[1:56:49] more questions I have got my iPad off so
[1:56:52] don't worry about that
[1:56:55] hallelujah
[1:56:58] amen
[1:57:02] yeah that we're all going back to
[1:57:04] Pentecost through Pentecost do you think
[1:57:07] we can go any higher than that like in
[1:57:10] the garden yes yes and that's a that's
[1:57:13] that's an excellent question because we
[1:57:16] do have something more than than this
[1:57:21] here what what this this here now this
[1:57:25] was this was the manifestation of God
[1:57:28] after the coming of the uh uh after the
[1:57:30] resurrection of Christ the Old Testament
[1:57:33] this was the fullness of that word being
[1:57:37] waved over the
[1:57:40] people this this church was destined to
[1:57:44] go back into the ground
[1:57:47] right this church
[1:57:50] is destined to go
[1:57:52] up so when the word came in this day the
[1:57:55] prophet did not just come in and and and
[1:57:58] and and and and uh
[1:58:02] uh you know tell you that you are a son
[1:58:04] of God and come back and you need to you
[1:58:07] need to uh come back to the you know uh
[1:58:10] uh uh dress codes and you need to
[1:58:12] baptize right and you need to we believe
[1:58:15] in predestination and we and a prophet
[1:58:17] came in through and the pillar of Fire
[1:58:19] Vindicated all of that for our
[1:58:21] faith but this was the age where the
[1:58:24] book was open and that open book has
[1:58:28] nothing left but Rapture
[1:58:31] yeah this church didn't have the open
[1:58:34] seals this they were blinded to what was
[1:58:37] going on this church is going to have
[1:58:41] this with a promise of
[1:58:45] rapture
[1:58:47] rightall does that make sense or no it's
[1:58:51] not just restoring because because it's
[1:58:54] not just a restoring back to the Bible
[1:58:57] doctrines this is not the restoring back
[1:58:59] to the Bible doctrines this is more than
[1:59:02] going back to the Bible doctrines this
[1:59:05] is an the book being
[1:59:08] open the leans have are being ripped
[1:59:13] off the leans of all of these all of
[1:59:18] these dogmas and teachers and and all of
[1:59:21] these these men that put all of these
[1:59:24] leans on the church and and there was no
[1:59:27] there they couldn't believe nothing
[1:59:29] because my goodness worshiping Mary and
[1:59:33] praying to Peter
[1:59:35] and you know and then then they come out
[1:59:37] and in Luther's age and then they go
[1:59:39] right back to uh Bishops and all and and
[1:59:42] all it was it it the church has been a
[1:59:46] mess and Le oosa shows how me big of a
[1:59:51] mess the church is in until they can
[1:59:53] truly think that God is doing something
[1:59:56] in their
[1:59:57] midst and God is no God is so far away
[2:00:01] from that denominational system I don't
[2:00:04] care whether your denomination or UND
[2:00:05] denomination if you're not in the word
[2:00:07] and yet they they they're it's so far
[2:00:10] away but it took this time for the
[2:00:13] opening of the book to show us the two
[2:00:18] Vines to show us the insects and the
[2:00:21] brid tree it took the opening of the
[2:00:24] book to show us the grafting and how it
[2:00:27] has happened all down through these ages
[2:00:29] it's took the open of the book to show
[2:00:33] us these
[2:00:34] things yes we've got something far
[2:00:36] beyond
[2:00:38] Pentecost you see what I'm
[2:00:41] saying but the original
[2:00:44] Life The Original Seed is here we're
[2:00:50] here and we'll have nothing any
[2:00:52] different as far as experience than this
[2:00:54] other than
[2:00:56] Rapture he's destinated you he's
[2:00:59] predestinated you to Rapture you see
[2:01:02] that not they they try to say oh brother
[2:01:05] brother you could you could write the
[2:01:07] 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelations
[2:01:09] with the he goes no no no no no no no
[2:01:11] even though seven Thunders have got to
[2:01:13] be found in the word they were just
[2:01:16] hidden till this time if they had known
[2:01:20] it ahead of time maybe this would be a
[2:01:23] different situation right maybe this
[2:01:25] church would have been raptured after
[2:01:27] all but God didn't want them raptured so
[2:01:30] God blinded their eyes to see this
[2:01:32] because there had to come an elect of
[2:01:35] this age elect of that age and you're
[2:01:36] going to see that as we go through the
[2:01:37] ages and all these things but the last
[2:01:40] time now's our
[2:01:42] season and our season ain't going to the
[2:01:44] ground our season is not another is is
[2:01:47] another cycle of death our season is

[2:12:57] that thinking we're still under we're
[2:13:00] still we're still under the
[2:13:02] denominational thinking that's not what
