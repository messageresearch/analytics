[54:44] every time a preacher is up here
[54:46] preaching under the anointing of the
[54:48] holy spirit that that when we say
[54:50] anointing of the Holy Spirit we are
[54:53] saying the angel of God is here to
[54:56] fulfill his word in your life Amen
[55:00] brother Bram says El easier when he had
[55:02] the when he had the assurance that the
[55:04] angel was going before him then he could
[55:07] decide to go because he had something to
[55:09] back him up I think that ought to be the
[55:11] Assurance of every man of God that
[55:14] preaches the gospel that he's got
[55:17] something positive from God that'll back
[55:20] up what he preaches I'm not preaching my
[55:23] own Doctrine I'm not preaching my own
[55:25] ability I'm not preaching my own ideas
[55:29] I'm preaching the Eternal Word of God
[55:31] and if you can believe what God is said
[55:35] the angel of God is here to back it up
[55:37] to your
[55:38] heart amen oh the darkness has to go
[55:41] away when the light comes in darkness
[55:44] has to go back when the light comes in
[55:47] amen all fear has to lead when the light
[55:50] comes in when the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[55:53] what is the gospel it's not the word
[55:56] only
[55:56] it's the Holy Ghost backing that word up
[56:00] amen he says my the Apostle Paul says my
[56:03] my preaching came not with enticing
[56:05] words of man's Wisdom but I come in the
[56:08] power and the demonstration of the
[56:10] spirit amen what is we what is he saying
[56:13] this word is not just a man's word a
[56:16] denominational word but this word is the
[56:20] Living Word of God and the living power
[56:24] of the living Christ is there to back it
[56:27] up Hallelujah well glory to God

[56:41] mind you didn't wake up in a bad mood
[56:45] amen you're not having a bad hair day

[56:50] demons that come against you can you say
[56:54] amen amen now he says he says got
[56:57] something positive that when he preaches
[56:59] if you haven't got it Brethren it's for
[57:01] you God still sends his men with an
[57:04] angel before him when he goes to take
[57:06] the message to the church on down he
[57:08] says every true servant of God that sent
[57:11] out has got a whole book full of divine
[57:14] promises that he can offer to the bride
[57:16] and I'm so glad of that he's got gifts
[57:18] in there for and he will not hold any of
[57:20] them back he will give every one of them
[57:23] out freely a true servant of God a model
[57:25] servant a servant that God can put trust

[57:40] entertaining entertaining
[57:43] Spirits amen nurturing
[57:47] Devils sitting there amen and thinking
[57:51] you know when when when I when I when
[57:53] the flu's coming on or or when you got
[57:56] cough and and then you sat there and
[57:58] start entertaining that kind of thing
[58:00] well I'm probably going to get this or
[58:01] I'm I'm probably going to why would you
[58:04] do that when you know it's a
[58:07] devil come on now amen you got a lump on
[58:10] your breast amen and the devil's getting
[58:13] you all fearful I remember I remember
[58:16] some years back uh uh fresa you know got

[58:21] than just a lump on her breast amen it
[58:23] was oozing and and and it was and and
[58:27] and and if it it we we were we were a
[58:29] little bit nervous amen but we got

[58:42] up and she went back or she went to the
[58:45] doctor to have it checked out amen and
[58:47] there was no cancer no nothing there why
[58:51] because we understood it was a devil and
[58:55] we don't have to accept what the devil
[58:59] is putting on me it's a spirit and I
[59:04] have to accept that and when I know that
[59:08] God has commissioned every believer not
[59:10] the preacher every believer to cast The
[59:14] Devil away then why don't you boys and
[59:17] girls cast them away why don't you mam
[59:20] and daddies cast them away why don't we
[59:23] break the strongholds of the enemy
[59:26] that's over our minds telling us that we
[59:28] can't be anything but I want to tell you
[59:30] you
[59:31] can
[59:33] hallelujah amen now I I the these
[59:38] Spirits now Jesus would say that those
[59:40] spirits that come amen he would he would
[59:43] say there in Matthew he would deal with
[59:45] it you know there in Matthew the 12th
[59:47] chapter then the 45th uh 43rd through
[59:50] the 45th verse he would talk about when
[59:52] the unclean Spirit comes out of a man
[59:55] that he can be he he can be delivered
[59:59] amen but if a man is not careful and
[1:00:03] does not fill his soul with the presence
[1:00:07] of God with the word of God Satan will
[1:00:10] come right back around knock on that
[1:00:12] door and you'll open that door up and
[1:00:15] he'll bring seven times more
[1:00:18] Devils that's right amen he says when
[1:00:20] the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man
[1:00:22] he walks in dry places he Congress and
[1:00:24] finds none then he said I will return
[1:00:26] into my house from whence I came out and
[1:00:29] when he has come he finds it empty swept
[1:00:31] and garnished and then he then go with
[1:00:34] he and taketh with him himself seven
[1:00:36] other Spirits more wicked than himself
[1:00:38] and they enter in and dwell there and
[1:00:40] the last state of that man is worse than
[1:00:42] the first even so shall it be also of
[1:00:44] this wicked generation can you say amen
[1:00:47] amen Jesus came to the Jesus came to to
[1:00:50] to the crippled man there in John the
[1:00:52] the 5th chapter and the 14th verse amen
[1:00:55] and and the the the the the the the
[1:00:57] impotent man that that lay there at the
[1:01:00] gate be at the at the pul of
[1:01:03] patha and and he amen the Bible says
[1:01:06] that he had been crippled for 38 years
[1:01:10] so it was not a a a disease that was
[1:01:13] going to take his life this was a
[1:01:16] debilitating H uh something that you
[1:01:18] know either crippled him or he had py or
[1:01:21] amen but it wasn't anything that was
[1:01:23] going but but here now I want you to
[1:01:25] watch because when Jesus healed him amen
[1:01:28] and he went on then the then the Bible
[1:01:30] says that Jesus goes back to look for
[1:01:34] that boy for that man and and that 20
[1:01:37] that that 14th verse he says and
[1:01:39] afterward Jesus finds him in the temple
[1:01:41] and said unto him behold Thou Art made
[1:01:44] whole sin no more lest a worse thing
[1:01:48] come upon you amen what what he's what
[1:01:51] he's saying is unbelieve no more don't
[1:01:55] disbel believe the word of God or you'll
[1:01:58] go back and be worse than what you ever

[1:03:28] cancer is located in the womb and the
[1:03:30] doctor told you there is nothing that
[1:03:31] can be done and now the only hope that
[1:03:34] you have and that is in Jesus Christ
[1:03:38] amen now it was somebody that was
[1:03:41] experiencing the power amen and I I you
[1:03:45] know I I I heard a message that brother
[1:03:48] brother Wayne preached a message I
[1:03:50] believe it was this last uh uh I believe
[1:03:53] it was the last Thursday night I didn't
[1:03:55] enourage everyone to to to listen to
[1:03:57] that uh because he he dealt uh uh more
[1:04:01] profoundly with it than what I could
[1:04:02] deal with it here tonight but but amen I
[1:04:05] you know uh brother Wayne he's just a
[1:04:08] he's just a a master preacher amen and
[1:04:11] uh uh but you know what what he does in
[1:04:14] one service it takes me four amen but
[1:04:17] but with these angels that God sends the
[1:04:21] spirits there are spirits there that
[1:04:25] that that are listen you you are a
[1:04:28] fallen being and the reason why Spirits
[1:04:31] are having control today is because sons
[1:04:35] of God have been out of their
[1:04:38] position amen what what made Jesus the
[1:04:42] that the scripture says man amen was was
[1:04:46] was supposed to be over the Angels
[1:04:49] Hallelujah but we find that that they're
[1:04:51] below the Angels but what happened to
[1:04:54] Christ Christ came and a mortal being to
[1:04:57] die Amen to take sin to go to hell but
[1:05:01] now the scripture says that he is lifted
[1:05:05] above the
[1:05:06] angels and he has come to bring many
[1:05:11] sons into
[1:05:15] glory amen in other words we are now
[1:05:18] seated with Christ in Heavenly places we
[1:05:23] can take the word of God but believe the
[1:05:26] word of God and the angels are sent to
[1:05:29] minister for you as sons of
[1:05:32] Goden hallelujah amen what what did that
[1:05:35] uh the the the uh sister CA there in in
[1:05:39] uh uh Hebrews 1 and the last very last
[1:05:41] two verses amen uh there in in Hebrews 1
[1:05:46] praise the Lord is it easy to get
[1:05:49] to it says to which of the Angels said
[1:05:51] he at any time sit on my right hand
[1:05:54] until I make thine enemies thy foot stol
[1:05:57] amen he says are they not all
[1:06:01] ministering Spirits sent forth to
[1:06:05] minister for amen now we're thankful

[1:14:00] coming at your disposal you're a Son of
[1:14:02] God you've got the word you can't you

[1:14:36] G up the loins of your mind there is
[1:14:40] where the devil's going to fight you can
[1:14:43] you say
[1:14:44] Amen now amen they're
[1:14:48] there now it's important as I have been
[1:14:51] as I've been
[1:14:53] hidden in in the amen when we when we
[1:14:56] talked about the angel of God is still
[1:15:00] going before us and then the that other
[1:15:03] one on Amen uh uh the authority of sons
[1:15:07] amen and and I brought in on both of
[1:15:10] them

[1:15:34] believe the make believer can't believe
[1:15:37] only a Son of God can believe like God
[1:15:43] believes and it's the devil telling you

[1:16:32] forth Angels Glory what are they

[1:16:51] ministering spirits and forth how do we
[1:16:53] know they are the Bible says the word of

[1:27:03] the kind of home that an angel can get
