[33:54] everything falls apart praise His name
[33:58] when you have a broken
[33:59] heart just lift your hands and say that
[34:02] greater is he that is with is it within
[34:06] us tonight than he that's in the world
[34:09] Amen as thinking of this song as well
[34:12] what here we in as we turn it to our
[34:13] pastor
[34:15] F God wants to hear you
[34:19] sing when the waves are crashing around
[34:23] you when the fiery DS around
[34:27] you and despair it's all you
[34:31] see God wants to hear your
[34:35] voice when the wisest man has
[34:39] spoken says your circumstance is as
[34:43] hopeless as can
[34:46] be that's when God can we go uper key
[34:50] and do verse one you
[34:55] see there ch
[34:57] were fast in
[34:59] tight down at the gy that
[35:03] night still Paul and silence would not
[35:07] be
[35:09] dismay thank you Lord you said it's time
[35:13] to lift our
[35:15] voice sing praises to our
[35:19] Lord let's prove that we will trust him
[35:23] come what may God wants to hear a sing
[35:27] God wants to hear you
[35:30] sing when the waves are crashing around
[35:37] [Music]
[35:55] you
[35:58] [Music]
[36:06] that's he loves to hear you
[36:12] sing he loves to hear you sing when
[36:14] you're when he's blessed
[36:17] you he loves to hear you
[36:20] sing praise His name and being
[36:24] grateful but I do think that he
[36:29] he
[36:30] really loves to hear
[36:35] you in those hard times when it's
[36:37] nothing but Faith there's no
[36:40] emotion there's nothing there's nothing
[36:43] left doctors are against
[36:46] you everything's against you and and
[36:50] then there's something way down deep
[36:52] inside that that starts bubbling out of
[36:55] you and then it's not your deter
[36:56] mination or it's not any you have
[36:58] nothing
[37:00] left and then that's when something from
[37:03] the inner man just kicks
[37:05] in and I think he really gets a lot of
[37:09] Praise he gets a lot of Praise out of
[37:15] [Music]
[37:17] that I I believe somewhere in the
[37:19] scripture where it says that he he
[37:22] bottles the Saints or the prayers of the
[37:25] Saints the tears of the
[37:27] Saints amen there's something about that
[37:30] that when we love him despite the
[37:36] situation I'm serving him because I love
[37:39] him how about you
[37:41] tonight do you love
[37:43] him
[37:48] amen it's like my
[37:50] girl amen when I said I do I me it and I

[52:28] his testimony I remember the first time
[52:30] I ever heard his testimony
[52:32] 1971 okay I just a small boy about 10
[52:36] years old January 1971 Jasper
[52:40] Texas brother Clark was a pastor there
[52:43] in Jasper Texas and he invited Billy
[52:45] Paul and Brother Joseph and they brother
[52:47] Billy Paul gave his testimony and I
[52:50] don't know what happened I'd like to had
[52:52] that
[52:52] on uh you know MP3 or something and my
[52:55] dad had you know them big real reals and
[52:57] everything my dad had it and I don't
[52:59] know wherever happened he had a lot of
[53:01] stuff that I don't have somehow it got
[53:03] lost in their moves or whatever but how
[53:06] many remembers them real to
[53:08] reals amen so some of the younger folks
[53:11] don't remember them somebody was saying

[53:15] that he wanted to find one said Brother
[53:17] David all your travels and stuff you had

[53:28] used to have to go through to listen
[53:31] amen so we appreciate the Lord tonight
[53:34] amen now the
[53:37] singing I tell you what I don't know if
[53:40] brother Kobe Sister Mary and all them
[53:42] looked at my notes but
[53:45] my I believe I'm in the right direction
[53:47] tonight so you just help me pull from
[53:50] the gift tonight job the 35th chapter
[53:53] 10th verse
[53:58] says but none
[53:59] saith where is God my maker who giveth
[54:05] songs in the night May the Lord add His
[54:07] blessings to the WR word you may be
[54:10] seated I'd like to turn to another
[54:13] scripture and I don't know I guess
[54:15] people pronounce it habac or something
[54:17] like that the third chapter and the 17th
[54:21] verse and I I and if you got a scull
[54:25] field it'd be well you'll have to find
[54:27] it cuz I didn't write down the page
[54:29] number there but it's in there and I
[54:31] guess that's how you pronounce it but I
[54:33] want to read from the third chapter the
[54:35] 17th to the 19th
[54:39] verse and it says although although the
[54:41] Fig Tree shall not
[54:43] blossom neither shall fruit be in the
[54:47] vines the labor of the olives shall fail
[54:51] and the field shall yield no meat the
[54:54] flock shall be cut off from the fold and
[54:57] there shall be no herd in the Stalls yet
[55:00] will I rejoice in the Lord I will joy in
[55:04] the god of my
[55:05] salvation the Lord is my strength and he
[55:09] will make my feet like H's feet and he
[55:11] will make me to walk upon my high places
[55:15] may the Lord add His blessings to
[55:17] reading the word I like to take for a
[55:19] thought a song in the night a song in
[55:23] the night now we all go through uh
[55:26] troubles Amen brother brother Kobe was
[55:28] mentioning so I thought my he might have
[55:30] he probably looked at my notes or
[55:32] something but I said we all go through
[55:34] troubles I was talking to a brother last
[55:36] night it seems like every time you turn
[55:38] around brother wend everybody's texting
[55:40] and say you got to pray for this one
[55:41] pray for this one pray for this one this
[55:43] one quit this one gave up this one done
[55:46] that and every one of us tonight has got
[55:48] some kind of trouble or trial or battle
[55:51] that we're going through am I right am
[55:54] and so we're going through that but I
[55:55] tell you what it's God that gives a song
[55:59] we can't sing sometimes when we're going
[56:01] through trouble and trials unless God
[56:04] gives a song oh and he's the one that's
[56:07] got to give it amen oh you know what me
[56:10] you know what people's problems are
[56:12] men's problems are we put it all one
[56:14] category many men are terribly tormented
[56:17] because they focus on their
[56:19] troubles amen we focus on our troubles
[56:22] we focus on our trials we focus on our
[56:25] distress we focus on our fears right
[56:28] there's a lot of fears uh I I I there an
[56:31] archive brother Donnie here a several uh
[56:34] uh weeks ago and he's preaching on that
[56:36] that uh we should uh be free from all
[56:38] fear you know it's just the devil wants
[56:40] to put fear and torment in our life but
[56:43] you look it up and I I I just Googled it
[56:45] and there's a lot of fears you know and
[56:48] they got so many uh names for Phobia so
[56:51] iophobia and and and uh that's I think
[56:54] that's afraid of spids or whatever
[56:56] there's so many fears and we we fear and
[56:58] we we focus our our get our focus and
[57:00] our mind on on that our fears our
[57:02] troubles our torments
[57:06] yeah and we begin to look within
[57:08] ourselves to escape their TR to escape
[57:11] our troubles but we can't look unto
[57:14] ourselves cuz within us there's no hope
[57:17] within us there's nothing in us that we
[57:20] can do or say or or Escape our troubles
[57:23] and our trials and our

[1:04:13] say he said what was God in the
[1:04:15] beginning he wasn't even God what is God
[1:04:17] an object of worship and in the
[1:04:19] beginning he didn't have nobody to
[1:04:21] worship him he just dwelt alone the El
[1:04:24] him the all sufficient one amen he he
[1:04:28] just dropped along with his
[1:04:29] thoughts and in his thoughts he had a
[1:04:32] plan oh Hallelujah I'm so glad that in
[1:04:36] the from the beginning from the
[1:04:37] foundation of the world before there was

[1:04:44] thoughts and if I was with him in his
[1:04:46] thoughts I'll always be with
[1:04:49] him Hallelujah so he created the angels
[1:04:53] and they begin to worship holy holy
[1:04:56] around but you know what that was just
[1:04:57] going through the motions they didn't
[1:04:59] know what it was like but in in him the
[1:05:01] prophet of God said he had an attribute
[1:05:03] to be a father to be a savior to be a
[1:05:06] Healer to be all these things to be a
[1:05:08] deliverer but nobody was lost so he
[1:05:11] couldn't display his attribute as a
[1:05:13] savior nobody was sick so he couldn't
[1:05:16] display his attribute as being a
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:20] Healer

[1:32:28] Thomas Andrew
[1:32:30] dorsy I don't know if anybody's ever
[1:32:32] heard a story on him but he was a black
[1:32:36] Jazz musican from
[1:32:40] Atlanta and he wrote or composed a lot
[1:32:43] of jazz
[1:32:44] tunes with suggestive
[1:32:47] lyrics in other words they were
[1:32:50] awful
[1:32:52] wrote a lot of
[1:32:54] tunes but finally one day in 1926 he
[1:32:58] gave it all
[1:33:00] up to start
[1:33:02] composing Spiritual
[1:33:05] music he wrote peace in the
[1:33:10] valley and so but he was kicked out of a
[1:33:13] lot of churches because they didn't like
[1:33:14] his songs they thought they were too
[1:33:18] whirly and all that he said he kind of
[1:33:20] somebody asked him about it said you
[1:33:22] what about that he kind of kicked back
[1:33:24] and laughed about it but one
[1:33:28] day when he was performing somewhere a
[1:33:31] note came a telegram came from him and
[1:33:33] his pregnant wife died
[1:33:38] suddenly and he said it like this he
[1:33:41] could have wallowed and set
[1:33:45] pity he could have gave it all
[1:33:49] up but he went back to
[1:33:54] where it was that gave him inspiration
[1:33:58] and that was the songs that he wrote and
[1:34:00] he wrote this
[1:34:02] song precious
[1:34:04] Lord take my
[1:34:07] hand lead me
[1:34:09] on let me

[1:45:01] or nothing there was Shack Shackled down
[1:45:04] all the rats crawling all over their
[1:45:05] bodies and everything but in the midst
[1:45:07] of their night season they begin to
[1:45:09] praise God and because of that somebody
[1:45:11] got saved because of what they was going
[1:45:13] through but they kept their testimony
[1:45:16] and they and God gave them a song and
[1:45:18] the prisoners heard it and one of them

[1:45:27] night I heard a robin singing in the
[1:45:30] rain and the raindrops pattered made a
[1:45:34] sweet
[1:45:34] refrain making all the sweeter the music
[1:45:38] of the
[1:45:39] strain so I thought when Trouble Comes
[1:45:43] as trouble will why should I stop
[1:45:46] singing just beond the hill it may be be
[1:45:50] that Sunshine floods the green world
[1:45:53] still he who faces the trouble with a
[1:45:55] heart of cheer makes the burden lighter
[1:45:59] if there Falls a tear sweeter is the
[1:46:01] Cadence the song we hear I have learned
[1:46:06] your lesson bird with dapp a wing
[1:46:09] listening to your music with a lit of
[1:46:12] spring when the storm cloud darkens then
[1:46:16] is the time to
[1:46:18] sing Hallelujah the time to
[1:46:24] sing let me I thought about this one
[1:46:28] like I said I don't know what you're
[1:46:29] going
[1:46:30] through Kobe was saying all these things
[1:46:34] and I thought my he's gonna get on my
[1:46:36] message I thought about this song I
[1:46:39] jotted it
[1:46:42] down said I have
[1:46:44] journeyed Through The Long Dark
[1:46:47] Night Out on the
[1:46:50] see by faith alone which sought unkn and
[1:46:55] yet His Eyes Were Watching
[1:46:59] Me The Anchor
[1:47:01] Holds though the ship is
[1:47:04] battered The Anchor Holds though the
[1:47:07] cells are torn I have fallen on my knees
[1:47:11] as I face the Raging Seas The Anchor
[1:47:14] Holds and spot of the
[1:47:17] storm next verse is I've had vision
[1:47:21] and I've had
[1:47:23] dreams I even held them in my
[1:47:25] hands but I never knew they would slip
[1:47:29] right through like they were
[1:47:31] only grains of
[1:47:33] sand I've been young but I'm older now
[1:47:38] and there has been Beauty these eyes
[1:47:41] have seen but it was in
[1:47:44] the through the storms of my
[1:47:48] life oh that's when God proved his love
[1:47:52] for
[1:47:54] me
[1:47:55] amen I thought about that and I thought
[1:47:58] God when you're going through a
[1:48:01] storm and I don't know what you're going
[1:48:03] through you may be going through a storm
[1:48:06] but the anchor
[1:48:08] holds the ship may be
[1:48:12] battered and the sails may be
[1:48:15] torn and you might had to Fall on Your
[1:48:18] Knees as you face a raising sees but the
[1:48:22] anchor holds in spite of the storm stand
[1:48:28] together you believe that
[1:48:30] tonight he gives us a song don't
