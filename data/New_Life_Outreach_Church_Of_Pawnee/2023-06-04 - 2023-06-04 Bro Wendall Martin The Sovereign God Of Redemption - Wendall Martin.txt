were just really glad to have um our our friends we're with us today and so I'm glad church are you glad to be in church today amen glad to be in the house of the Lord praise the name of Jesus let's look here in the Book of Romans the eighth chapter and the 28th verse and um I sure appreciate the songs this morning so good to have brother Merle back home and we missed he and sister Leah when they were gone and what a wonderful day we had yesterday we appreciate you young people coming and celebrating that the birthday there with brother Dylan and and Brotherhood is a wonderful thing isn't it

the big one six amen so we um we just we love brother Dylan and we appreciate the invitation to be a part and all of those who amen strive for Brotherhood and and keeping and doing things together I think it's a wonderful thing to one cries we all cry when one rejoices we all rejoice and so we're thankful for that they're in Romans the eighth chapter the 28th verse and we know that all things work together for good to them who that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified then he also glorified now if you'll notice all of this is all in the past tense when did this all happen back up to the 29th verse for whom he did for no them he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so that when he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of that son that time he called he justified and he glorified 31st verse what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who shall be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we not with him also he shall not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemns it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake or we kill all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us somebody say shall be able to separate us now who is this us those that have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son because they're already predestinated they're already called they're already Justified they're already glorified and there is nothing that shall separate us can you say amen amen he says separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our father we thank you for your love Thank You for Your Grace today so good to have our visiting friends and we just ask a special blessing upon them I pray Lord that you would come in a real Sovereign way here this morning and speak to us as as we begin to think of Lord we're not just an afterthought Lord you didn't just see us Lord when we came to an altar one day but Lord we are we are the plan and I ask God that your Holy Spirit would be here with us in a real special way now Lord be with brother Josh as he's ministering this morning I pray Lord that you would be with our sister churches around the country I pray father that you would be with Israel Lord and that your hand would be with them and this prophecy is beginning to to come together for them but Lord this bride Lord we're preparing for a rapture and we love you Lord with all of our heart in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated praise the Lord I want to speak for a little while on on the sovereignty of God and um amen The Sovereign God of creation and um in thinking about this this is a this is an incredible this is an incredible thing there's been a lot of debate over the years about uh the man the the reach of man and the the reach of of God and and and where one stops and where one goes and but this morning I want to I want to uh um Minister on on the god of creation the Great Eternal creator and um amen how many believes that God's got a Got A Plan of Redemption every great artist man must see his uh masterpiece before he starts it the details are are made before one blow is even amen struck the the marble it's Iman the details the plans are made the sketches are drawn a model is crafted a man um these days you've got the 3D prototype that's created you the the artist has has got an image of what He is wanting to build he's got it in his mind and he is making that image Amen to come out of his mind and to come upon the marble amen as we think about even Mount Rushmore and and uh gutsenborglum there it took him 14 years to to carve the mountain or the the Masterpiece out of the mountain and um amen 14 years of of of of of faithful work now 14 years that's a man that's that's that's just uh Dylan's only amen he's just two years older than than that uh what it took for the man to build uh to create that masterpiece but it also took four years of preparation that amen the the painful effort amen uh before the actual Masterpiece has even started the preparation that goes into it because every minute detail has to be gone through beforehand amen every every detail has got to be there they had to sample the Rocks they had to sample the amen uh they had to play around with a dynamite they had to do these these things to to ensure that once they started the project they'd be able to finish the project amen because if you got into it and then you didn't realize uh you didn't for see things ahead of time your project could amen uh be uh be stopped and then millions of dollars be uh wasted and so they had to find the right type of rock the amen they had to have the proper tools they had to have the proper equipment they had to have everything there amen and and when it was ready amen uh having the proper equipment and having the proper sight was was not good enough then they would have to build the busts and so remember this is where uh Berglund would spend a lot of time doing the details and how he was going to put the faces and how much of the men he was going to put on the mountain and amen and which way it would face any amen he he went through this bust after bust and trying to to find the image that he wanted to put up there on that mountain because this is his Masterpiece he was going to take these amen these famous men and and it would it would last um amen through infamy and so we he wanted to uh assure that everything that he'd done a man was taken care of ahead of time before he even struck the first a man the first bit of rock can you say amen amen they when we think of Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses they say Amen that the that that it was a lifetime of work that it it took amen it was it was years and years in the making in his mind as he as he thought about it and working on other projects He had this that he wanted to to uh to bring out into the the public view his version of what Moses would look like amen and and he he would think about it and go through the sketches and amen it went years and years of thinking and and and amen trying this and that and the other before he would he would come in to the amen starting this masterpiece amen that we know today of Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses and it is one of the amen it's one of the fine pieces of art amen and so that he could see the image and it cost him a great deal of his uh of of uh of his time in bringing this together Amen brother Branham would talk about it and he would say only the man the sculpture himself has in his mind what he's trying to do he he is the one you might walk up and say to him now what are you picking on that rock for to The Outsider who doesn't know what's in his mind it's nonsense Amen to The Outsider it says but to the man the sculptor himself he's got a vision in his mind what he's trying to make and what he's trying to reproduce what he has on his mind in the form of a monument and that's the reason he's digging it out of the Rocks Zeke you have to start off right at the beginning you have to follow the pattern you can't get a little a little piece to start off and well we'll make this way now I believe we'll do it this no he's got to have an exact pattern in his mind he's got that pattern and he cannot vary from that pattern now in order to do this he had to draw in his mind and because we have no real picture of Moses for he had to get a mental picture in his mind of exactly what Moses was now a genuine sculptor is inspired like a genuine poet or a genuine singer musician whatever it might be oh Rio has to come by inspiration Michelangelo must have had that inspiration of what Moses really looked like and he caught it in his mind and what Moses must have been so he set forth on this great piece of marble The Cutting of the pattern and bringing down and holding down until he got the real picture of what was in his mind can you say Amen so as we begin to think about God as amen The Sovereign God of creation I want to say there is nothing any greater than God Amen there is no power any greater than God there is no man any greater than God there's no devil or demon that is any greater than God God is supreme and we're not here to glorify the devil this morning we're here to glorify God amen I think that'd be a good idea for every one of us in our lives too we should not be glorifying the devil in our lives let's glorify God in our lives amen glorify God now God as the great Creator I believe that God had had these thoughts eternally in his mind amen I don't believe God's ever had a new thought God is God God has no tomorrows God has no yesterdays God is God God has always been God never had a beginning God will never have an ending amen God is before all things now if God was ever created then God's not God Amen he's not an idol God has always been from eternity to Eternity amen and the Bible says there in Acts 15 and 18 it says known unto God or all somebody say all his works from the beginning of the world Amen that means that means from the very beginning when God said let there be God knew from the beginning Amen to the ending everything and every detail in between God is not learning God's all-knowing God knows your tomorrow God knows what the tribulation is going to be like God knows what the Millennium is going to be like God knows who's going to be said he at the marriage supper of the Lamb God knows all things and if God knows it no wealthy if your God doesn't know all things you'd better change gods and I want to invite you to my God the Living God he lives in the body of Jesus Christ he is forevermore God can you say amen amen that's right there in Hebrews 4 and 2 or 4 and 3 it says for we which have believed do enter into rest as he has said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world now now here he's talking he's talking to a group of people that say we don't believe it he's talking about the people in the wilderness with Moses a man that just constantly belly ate and they died and amen they they can go into the promised land but yet God says my word no matter how much unbelief is in the camp my word will last will stand the works were finished from the foundation of the world so that tells me that God is not doing anything new today God has got a plan and God is working that plan he's working that plan in the world he's working that plan in this church he's working that plan in your life he's working that plan in your family he's working that plan amen he is still God can I hear an amen Amen in all reality God never has a new thought his original thought is the new is the current one now that's hard for us humans to think about amen it's hard for us to really grasp our mind around but God Amen his plan never changes now I also want us to look amen what else now it had to come out of his mind amen but in his thoughts there was a plan and that plan would be something that would go and span the thousands of years amen all the way down into our time I I I believe that the man if God could see something then God could foreordain something amen now God can't change God can't change the Bible says they're in Micah 3 and 6 I am the Lord and I change not can you say Amen so God is unchangeable now I'm trying to get you somewhere because I want you to know how concrete God is when When God says I love you it's a Concrete thought Hallelujah God doesn't say I love you today and I don't love you tomorrow God loves his people hallelujah amen his nature is unchangeable he will forever remain holy he will forever hate sin he will forever stand behind his word his word is always the same man well praise the Lord you know I'm just glad God doesn't do anything on the spare of the moment Hallelujah now I'm a spare of the moment type guy amen hallelujah and uh that's just in my nature but God's not spare of the moment God's one of those guys that thinks it out forever amen God wants to make sure that if he starts it he's going to be able to finish it I'm one of those guys that have started plenty of projects that are still not finished God starts the project and God will end the project come on church he that has begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ amen now brother Branham would say now before the great thought become a word god perceived he pre-thought these things before the foundation of the world Amen he says another place he says the first word the man in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God now before it could be a word it had to be a thought cause a word is a thought expressed and when God when he seemed that the enemy of this world was going to do what he'd done God thought how he would send the great Plan of Redemption and when he sought it then he spoke it and as was as good as done right then all these thousands of years later come the Lord Jesus Christ and died for sin and rose again some 1900 years ago this morning for our Justified education sitting at his right hand now as the high priest making intercession for Upon Our confession see it's already finished any word that comes out of God's Bible you can rest your soul upon can you say man so first of all God had to have it in his mind God had to have a plan and then God had now the sculptor amen the great artist is now going to go at making his Masterpiece how does God make his Masterpiece God doesn't use his hands because he's a spirit he don't have hands amen God doesn't use amen he doesn't use a hammer and and chisel no God spoke with his mouth and that word creates can you say man Hallelujah well I want to tell you when God's word Goes Forth amen there and there in Psalms 119 and 89 forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven Isaiah 55 and 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me voice but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I said it that's a masterpiece that's a god that can speak and say well praise the Lord amen you see that decree has set the standard for all times amen now if I go too slow y'all just amen tell me speed it up amen Hallelujah the decree hindered for all times now I know we have fashions that set standards amen we've got Hollywood that set standards we've got we've got uh uh uh military Geniuses that set standards but God is the standard bearer of all times when God sets the standard there is nothing that can over overstep that standard it's his word and his word cannot well can you say Amen let's look here in Isaiah Isaiah 46 and 9. and I'll I'll just slow down a minute and let you kids get to that Bible amen Hallelujah Isaiah 46 and 9. praise the name of the Lord do you love him well do you love him do you really love him amen Isaiah 46 and 9. remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do as much of my pleasure as I can no no what does it say my counsel shall stand and I will do I will do oh my pleasure now we're living in a society it's a humanistic society that says you control God you control when you can get saved and how you get saved you control what you make of your life you control I want to say God is in control well praise the Lord and if there is anything the devil has done or is doing is because God has allowed it and God foresaw it and God is making he's going to bring it right around to make the Masterpiece fit just perfect well glory to God right now you're going through something you're saying I just don't know how it is God just hang on Baby put your seatbelt on because God is it may be hiring the devil right now to bring you right back around to where you need to be I believe that's the kind of God I'm serving hallelujah amen Daniel Daniel 4 and 35. I'll wait on you boys to turn there to you boys and girls amen Daniel 4 and 35. he praised the Lord now he's going to do all his pleasure Daniel 4 and 35 and all somebody say all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the Earth and none none now maybe you're maybe maybe maybe maybe you're sitting next to somebody that that is that worships at the idol of humanism you might need to punch him and say hey none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou God is God God's got the plan God is working the plan and there ain't nothing that nobody can do to take away God's original thought can you say Amen now when God started building his his his his original Masterpiece and he built the foundation he built amen as he is coming up to to building Christ that great uh Masterpiece of redemption in order to have Redemption you've got to have a redeemer and the Redeemer amen God was going to to make sure that that Great Masterpiece amen when the Redeemer come you see let me let me just stop right here you see you you you you you wouldn't know God today if you didn't know what sin was

can only know God today like we know him because of what he has put out in front of us oh oh can you say Amen now God was always as we went through the scripture these last couple weeks amen God was always a savior he was always the Redeemer but he did not have a body to do it in he had to be a kinsman redeemer can you say man now when God was building this Great Masterpiece he had called Abraham amen election he called Isaac love and then Jacob Grace and then Joseph perfection and then on top of this Amen on top of uh of this you know great Foundation then he began to add with the with the uh uh uh prophets and and as they begin to speak and they man then they begin to to to to to bring about an awareness of what the Redeemer was going to look like and what Redemption would be and how it would take place and and before you know it when Jesus come here on the earth he was the Fulfillment of all of those Old Testament prophecies can you say Amen now some people amen they get hung up on the foreknowledge versus predestination man you see foreknowledge is to have a knowledge of beforehand amen I believe that that the scripture teaches that God's seen all the way to the very end I believe God eternally now I believe he knew that laodicea would be just like it is today I believe the Bible teaches you say now how well how do you know that because he foretold it it's in the book he foretold everything that we're going through today he said in the last days will be dangerous times men will be lovers of themselves and amen and and and you know accuse false accusers and and all of these scriptures these were foretold by God thousands and thousands of years before we come he eternally knew and just for you kids you know what I believe God knew every gnat and every time the gnat would bat its eye I believe God's seen every grasshopper and God knew everything about that little old grass well praise the Lord amen and if he cares about the little sparrows that falls how much more does he care about you you see God created his entire creation by foreknowledge amen he will not do anything without that sorrow understanding of what he wants and when he wants it amen are y'all following me here this morning God knew the exact spot of the Garden of Eden amen millions of years before the Garden of Eden was ever planted God knew because he's seen it in his mind all he had to do was to create it God seen the perfect spot Hallelujah when God looked through time he's seen every fruit remember he's sovereign he is from eternity to Eternity he has known what he wanted he has known what was in his mind a man from the beginning praise the Lord he knew every he knew every every every amen form of life he knew the plant laugh come on every type of plant that was in the plant life amen he knew the the the the the leaf that each type of plant would look like he knew the seed and what the seed would produce amen he knew the animal life he knew the human life oh son of God whole daughter of God I just want to tell you if he knew all about that he knew about you too well praise the Lord can you say Amen he's seen you sometimes we say well God God God's not interested in the human Affairs we know that God is no no God is interested in you amen God's senior God seeing you turn your neighbor and say God seen you before the world ever began he's seen you hallelujah

Lord if God knows that about your hair and God knows that about your stature if God knows that about everything about you then don't you know that God knows about your soul foreign amen now some of you are with me and some of you aren't you yeah that's all right I'll keep on preaching amen hallelujah did you boys know that God strategically God wanted you God wanted that exact nature God wanted that exact build and so God put Mom and Daddy together amen and then God put their mama and daddies together because they want God wanted something out of you come on when they're building a bell amen they take a a little bit of this metal and a little bit of this iron and a little bit of this zinc and a little of these little medals and they and they Blended together and you wonder why one Bell amen has a certain tone another Bell has another tone and another Bell have you ever stopped to think how you can hit him and and you can and you can go all the way through and and it's make such beautiful music is because in each one amen of those bells there is a certain amount I meant of a material in it to give it the certainty and God has been building you for generations and generations God has been building a rapturing church for Generation after generation oh sometimes you look back at Mama you look back at Grandpa and maybe you want to carry bitterness don't be carrying bitterness God used that to bring you here where you are praise the Lord I say You're Here by God's design yeah Hallelujah there should not be any of us sitting here with complexes saying well I'm not good enough you're so good enough that God brought you here on this Earth in this season and shared with you his glory you're you're you've been in his thinking from before the time again you are not just a new thought predestination comes by foreknowledge foreknowledge sees ahead I've even talked to some folks who say oh well God don't didn't four no are you are you are you insane you mean you're serving a God that doesn't know the future you mean you're servant of God who who doesn't know who's going to be saved and who's not going to be saved you mean you're servant of God who has the videotape playing in his mind eternally knowing who would accept and who wouldn't accept God knows God knows Hallelujah Hallelujah and when Jesus says all that are mine will come to me all the father has sent me for will come to me he's talking to that that Fallen race that he has come to redeem well there should be some shouting news right there brother can you say Amen everything you've been through in your life has brought you to this point can you say Amen why amen why are you here with blue eyes your green eyes amen because God be created you would have never been here except God desired it you would have never he you would have never been here if he didn't know what he wanted you would have never been here if you weren't a part of a plan that he had already drawn up you would have never been here if he had not decreed it or spoken it oh can you say amen amen Hebrews 11 and 3 says through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear Hebrews one and three who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person upholding All Things by the word of his power Saint John 1 and 1. in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were created by Him and without him was not anything made that was made when God speaks Hallelujah can you say Amen if God is so particular dad amen bring him for this part that part and did my just just so that he could get a certain Ting out of you in this generation how much more has God got something in you hey I want to tell you right now amen you can look back in your and be bitter about life all you want to or you can stand up and say I am here because God decreed for me to be here I'm just glad I arrived hahaha I'm just glad I arrived can you see man yes sir you see you see now now you say now now brother Widow I I you know I I I I I I I can accept it for me in my body but I don't know if I can accept it for my soul amen well Hallelujah I praise the Lord you love him I thought God decreed what he foresaw can you say man amen you see he's already seen you he can if he's already seen you then he can assuredly declare your beginnings and your endings you are the Masterpiece that got the ball to Rolling in the first place now where we get mixed up is this okay this morning where we get mixed up is we're living in these in these bodies of declare that resulted a man from from the fall of Adam and Eve in the beginning but the word that was spoke concerning you is still eternal amen it's still Eternal that predestinated seed on the inside of you is the same gene seed as it would be this you being the seed of your father or you being the seed of your grandfather you were in your grandfather or your great-grandfather your great great great great great grandfather when he was a child you were in him in gene form all of God's Sons were in him Gene form before the foundation of the world well praise the Lord can you say Amen so election looks back to foreknowledge predestination looks forward to Destiny election says I've already known him or her predestination says I will give them a destiny I have seen and I have determined well glory to God election looks back to foreknowledge the drawing of the plan is dependent on what he has already seen and the word spoke declares the destiny predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son may I praise the Lord how could God be so sure because the omnipotent one has already been in your tomorrows [Applause] that's pretty good that's pretty good good job the omnipotent one has already been in your tomorrows before there was even a the word spoke let there be light he was already there he's seen you he knew you he decreed you and he saved you well praise the Lord there is not one Speck of scripture there is not one Speck of scripture that says that you were saved at an altar find it the praise of the Lord you were his at the beginning but you were in a fallen condition Christ came to redeem you Hallelujah so you didn't get saved at a certain time at an altar you always were in God's mind God had to come up with a plan to redeem you you're going there you God had to come up with a plan no the plan was already there before the foundation of the world that was also in his mind what you think is something that is rocking the apple cart could actually be part of the plan because the scripture says that Jesus what the was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so before there was a sin before there was a serpent before you mean the serpent was part of the plan you mean yeah stare had not been it would not be a redeemer if there are not it's been we would not know God in his love the way we know him come on church we know him today because of what we have seen him do to us and through us foreign Grace now do you understand Grace okay I'm gonna have to show you some scripture Hallelujah that's all right I want to show some scripture let's look here in Saint John the sixth chapter this is full of nuggets in here amen do you love him now the modern liberal Christian then says ha ha nope we have something to do with it we have something to do with it man Kenneth Hagin at one time has made a point that he says I I will determine my destiny now I'm not I'm not quoting him exactly but he had said one time amen they had in that word of faith movement that you can control your destiny by your words and and that that he a man would you know would be able to uh prolong his life by by what he says or he can die early by what he says while there are some truth to what you say and how you say it amen it depends on whether you're in the plan of God you can say you're going to live to be 110 years old but if you're already in the plan of God to go at 65 you ain't going a day further than 65. now if there's any 65 year olds in here I don't want to scare you I'm just that's just the number I pull out them out of the sky amen Hallelujah come on you're not gonna you're not gonna stick around here a day longer than what God's already has already decreed well praise the Lord God's got a plan for you enjoy the plan will ya enjoy it God's got a plan for your life now I'm fixing to get somewhere I can I I'm getting somewhere here I'm talking about the plan for your salvation God really you know here's here's here's the deal Hallelujah since we got a chalkboard so here here is God the pillar of Fire and he's up here this this is modern Christendom this is what modern people think ha God's thinking he's seeing all the Lost sinners and he says all right I'm going to send Jesus so he come he gets the second person the godhead and he says now I'm gonna I want you to go down there and I want you to die so here comes Jesus he's on he's on the cross hands there he's dying and then God looks at the Holy Spirit the third person of the Trinity he says all right now you got to come over here now now you've got to go down and convince all of these people down here you've got to convince all of these people down here on Earth that Jesus died to save him and and because God loves them and so the holy spirit is down here very defeated because laodicea has totally kicked the Bible says he's on the outside of the church knocking now here is laodicea the holy spirit's returning back and he's crying to the son saying man I'm sorry you died in vain they're both going back to the father saying my God when you have failure oh no one's accepting it Hallelujah amen looking for a dry areas or we can look at it this way the invisible God in his mind before all time spaces and Eternity before there was oxygen before there was water before there was anything before you could learn there's even a breath God had some thoughts in his mind and God spoke and Out Come the logos that great Pillar of Fire that Living Word he would come down and begin to anoint you would begin to anoint Prophets he would begin to declare Iman what he was going to look like and he would begin to show The Plan of Redemption and God would move in this body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he's coming for one purpose to redeem those who were lost then God Christ would go back amen sitting on the throne or The Mercy Seat of intercession and his Same Spirit would come and would search out all that Jesus died for you and everyone that Jesus died for would be brought back to where praise the Lord are you hearing me you say no now now I wish I had some scripture on that well I'm glad you asked Hallelujah you love him let's look here let's let's look here at John I tell you what let's look here at John uh uh John 6 and 30. 7 I brought these scriptures just in case I would need them amen you love him now watch this is all part of the plan six let's do six and 35 Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not now he's talking to the Pharisees the religious people oh somebody say oh that the father giveth me shall come shall come to me I've come to redeem those that are already the fathers they're down here they cannot get back up to here I'm simply the remedy here to bring them back and I will attract every one of them y'all hearing me amen now watch now let's let's look here he says and him to cometh to me I will in no wise cast out for I come down from heaven not to do my own will but of the will of him that's in me this is the Father's will which that sent me that of oh here he goes again of all which he has given me I well come on help me out I'm pausing for a reason amen where are we at all that uh oh that uh this is the Father's will that it sent me that of all which he hath given me repeat with me say it with me I should lose nothing it's a fail-proof plan brother God's not going to lose how could God be so sure because at the beginning in the plan God spoke the word the predestinated seed placed it in your heart in your Fallen body in your Fallen miserable creature that you are and God spoke that word concerning you planted it in your heart and there is nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing the devil or Biden or Clinton or nobody else can do about it you are his [Applause] can you say Amen amen now watch amen but should raise them up again in the last days this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see at the Sun and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I and I will be raised up in the last I'll raise them up in the last days can you say Amen now let's let's go one down through the 44th verse no man punch your neighbor and say no one can come to me accept the Father which sent me draw him so now we're saying there is no one that that is sitting here in laodicea can come to Christ accept it give permission by the by the father if you're not of him you'll never be with him amen you kids understand that you were in God's mind before the world began you say well well I don't know about that predestinated seed I do let's read the next verse hallelujah hallelujah and I will raise him up the last day 45th verse it is written in the prophets they shall be taught they shall all somebody say oh be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me okay now we're getting somewhere so it's no longer the Holy Spirit down here just trying to beg and plead and we've got preachers begging everyone to come to an altar please please please please accept Jesus please please accept Jesus Grandma want you there again no no no no no no no no no no no all of these the father has already taught each one of these individuals how did he teach him he placed the seed in his heart and those that have been taught they've got put it back up their sister Keys those that have been taught and there it is they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me well I just don't know I get out and witness and I witness and I witness it I witness if they've not been taught by God they're not coming here and ain't going to be there I don't care if they're famous singers I don't care if they're famous ah my movie stars if they've not been taught by God at the beginning they will not be with God at the ending you were in a fall is this okay you were in a fallen state but you were a son of God well that makes me want to shh amen amen now Now where's that scripture at I'm I I I'm so far off my notes here hallelujah where's that scripture at brother Merle you probably know what um amen Faith cometh by hearing uh um Faith cometh by hearing that's in Romans and I think it's Romans 10 uh see Faith uh okay there we go okay let's go let's go whoopsies 17 16 15 14. let's let's go to 14. how then shall They Call On Him whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him who they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed I report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God next one but I say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the Earth and their words unto the end of the world okay so faith comes by hearing the word and yet not everyone believed and they heard it so let me just put it this way put it back up the 17th verse so Faith cometh by hearing and I'm going to put a little amen asterisk in there uh uh uh uh from the foundation of the world and hearing by the word Jesus says they that have heard and have been taught will come to me now wasn't that those Pharisees weren't there coming to them they were there in his church service so so it wasn't that he was saying was going to come and said instead no they're already here so that's not what he's talking about but those who God has put a predestinated seat on the end how can I be so sure that I'm going to make it brother Wendell because God seen me in this dark laodicea and God put his predestinated seed within my heart and said Satan you can't have him thank you there's going to be plenty of times I'm going to fall I'm going to fail I'm going to come up oh my I'm going to have but I'm here to tell you the blood was shed for me the blood of Jesus Christ is for me he came to redeem me there's nothing you can do you might fall today get back up you might fall tomorrow get back up you might fall next week get back up yeah there's gonna be plenty that's going to blaspheme God and not going to make a Rapture but not you you can't blaspheme God you came from God and the black shall never lose his power put that in your pipe and smoke it devil can you say Amen that'll sing how to say I guarantee you that sinjacy amen is that right now are you far are you catching me now God was from eternity to Eternity Hallelujah amen now there's none of us that do good there's none of us a Christian then says well no I'm the one that done it I accepted it I came and accepted Jesus bless your heart the Bible says they're in Romans 3 and 9. amen or three and ten as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand that there is none that even seeks after God they are all going astray they are all together become unprofit there is none that doeth good no not one if you come to this word and you are bowing at the feet of this Living Word it's because God it's because the golden scepter has been extended out to you it's because God loved you before [Laughter] oh glory be to God can you say man amen that's right so brother Branham says Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace from a sovereign One Sovereign what can it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants to listen to it now Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that is sovereign God is Sovereign so he has given Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anyone someone shout hallelujah it does what it wants to isn't that wonderful it don't have to ask can I do this shall I do this can I must I will I it doesn't do it it does it itself Grace is Sovereign therefore it can save the vilest it can save the worst he can save the impurities he can save the immoralists he can heal the sickest Hallelujah God by Foreign knowledge knew that there had to be some preparation made to save man Isaiah 40 and 12. amen hallelujah I'll I'll wait for you younggins to get there praise the Lord and your old ones too amen who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand made it out heaven with a span and comprehended the dust of the Earth in a measure and Wade the mountains and scales and the hills and a balance am I starting out too fast amen Isaiah is going to be pretty well in the middle of your book amen what is it it's see it's it's what what do we have what's that which which side is Isaiah on Psalms is it on the is it after after okay after so you got yeah so let's find it yeah all right we're gonna go on who okay and it says 13th verse who hath directed The Spirit of the Lord or being his counselor hath taught him with whom Tookie counsel who instructed him who taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed to him the way of understanding behold the nations are as a bucket a drop of a bucket and are counted as small dust of the balance beholdeth behold he taketh up the aisles as a very little thing are you hearing me Hallelujah it isn't what I could desire it isn't what I could work to myself or in you it's what God in his foreknowledge has already done can you say Amen Oh Glory to God it don't matter whether you've got two parents in the home it don't matter whether you got a mind whether you got no parents in the home it don't matter whether or not you've got a good job it don't matter whether you have a husband or whether you have a wife it doesn't matter amen whether you it got everybody mad at you half the time it just does not matter if your name is there your name is there man for that should be some shouting material here this morning now you say brother Wendell you're you're gonna you're gonna you got to be careful I had a man tell me one time you got to be careful got to really be careful because if you preach this stuff you see people are going to go right outside those doors and they're going to start sinning and they're going to start smoking and trying out the marijuana stuff and and trying a little bit of booze and because they're predestinated they're going to be there that's the sign that you might not even be predestinated if you're predestinated there is something in your heart that's longing for God but you couldn't get from here to here there was no way to get there but because you do have a predestinated seed that is Longing To please the Lord God give you Calvary [Applause] God gives you give you go out and sin well praise the Lord amen someone told me one time they said your church I would never go to your church now they don't come to this church amen I'd never come because you make those people wear dresses and you just you beat them up every day I said have you ever been in my Church I Don't Preach well yep Hallelujah am I a hard preacher oh I I ain't looking at Michael amen I I all I have to do is tell you who you are [Applause] and when you find out who you are and that God's given you an atonement you're not going to want to sin you're not going to want to go out there in the world you are satisfied with what God created you to be if a preacher has to beat you up and if God has to beat you up and we've got problems God's created God's provided the remedy and because Calvary was going to get obstructed well praise the Lord because Calvary was going amen to get all caught up in the jungle of denominationalism and because Calvary wasn't going to be seen by all the clouds of darkness and all the people's World down here in laodicea God raises up a prophet Among Us Just One of Us takes us up higher past this and he's able to come back and says Calvary still exists come back they're down here telling you it don't matter what the Bible says because you'll never be able to attain to God they're telling you homosexuality is born that way smoking cigarettes God understands drinking that's just the way it's got to be God took a prophet lifted him up and he's up here with the open book amen and he is he's telling us hey hey Calvary has provided still just as real today as it was 2 000 years ago God sends a prophet because we forget the Clouds Of Darkness the Bible says amen that the spiritual wickedness in high places Keeps Us but one by one we're hearing a message one by one we've already been taught by God before the foundation of the world and when the prophet comes down with the word of God saying hey what does it do it lifts us up to Calvary and back to a rapture [Applause] into his well praise the Lord so it's not my goodness not my parents goodness but by the foreknowledge of God he brought it I don't know why I don't know why do you know why I don't know why God chose me but I guess he'd done it so he can show that he can choose whoever he wants to can you say Amen amen Saint John 15 and 15. wherefore I call you not servants yeah it's all right I'll wait on you Matthew Mark Luke Matthew Mark Luke John Hallelujah puts me on the spot up here amen up here oh my word Hallelujah [Music] all right amen John 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15. and the 15th verse henceforth call you not servants for the servant

you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it unto you can you say Amen amen now do you love him and when the disciples were leaving Jesus and I'm and I'm I'm I've just give me a few more minutes amen he was up there preaching to the he had the 70. now here's Here Comes now and and brother brother Dennis this here's this here's another deal going back to that tree that I was telling you about the other night amen so you had the so you had the um you had the 12th that Jesus had called and then there were 70 that come that was following Jesus Jesus gave the 70 power to heal the sick raise the Dead cast out devils now the scripture says that they all came back the seventy came back and said hey then the 12 were with them the 70 came back and said hey we've we we we've we've seen Devils cast out we've been seeing Miracles even the dead have been raised and Jesus do you know what scripture that's in amen uh Rejoice that your name is written in heaven is that I'm sorry amen I'm slipping a little bit here this morning praise the Lord now any any and he says don't rejoice don't rejoice that the devils are subject to you right now we're standing in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but Rejoice because your names are written in heaven now this is the seven if you would go back up and look at it you see that it was the seven they were all coming back man they're all rejoicing okay now I want you to look here at another account now hear the scripture is is coming and Jesus says except you eat my flesh drink my blood you have no part of me the 70 looked and said really these miracle workers tongue talkers These Guys casting out devils and even an account of raising the dad said we can walk with you no longer they turned around and left him Jesus turned right back around to the 12. he thinned his church out pretty quickly turn to his 12 and says will you leave me also and Peter says where could we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life these guys were taught of the father these guys were performing miracles they didn't perform come on they were living off of the life of Jesus [Music] Sister Amy brought a point up the other day amen about about the seventh about the prophecy in the in the Bible about there would be seven women that wanted one husband they wanted his bread they wanted his water but they wanted to live by their own name well praise the Lord are y'all hearing me what makes you different from any other Miracle Worker what makes you different than any other it is there is only one thing that makes you different is God foresaw you God ordained you and God sent his word your way to get you out of laodicea hey man can you say Amen how we should rejoice and thank God in our heart amen hallelujah well praise the Lord man you cannot hear because you're not my sheep there and they're in John 10 and 25 Jesus answered them and said I told you you believe and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name you bear witness of them but you believe not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they'll follow me I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man put them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father are one can you say Amen now as we bring this to a close am I doing all right Hallelujah let's let's turn let's turn to Romans 9 9 and 13. and we will help you Romance 13. that's a small letters folks because that's y'all amen because this is incredible this is incredible all the kids got it hey man all right Romans 9 and 13. no I don't want to read right no no no no no no no no no no no let's let's go on up here to um that's going up the seventh verse neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall I seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated now God's not allowed that God we we are humans and humans have power in fact we have power over God and so we get to choose whether we're loved of God

something here saying I want to love him I want to know him and here I am Jesus came looking for that Fallen people Jesus came looking can you say Amen now there's a difference Hallelujah there's a difference between The Condemned seed and the Fallen seed all right as the musicians come what is what is the Fallen see they're God Sons that fail what is The Condemned seed it's the Serpent's race that has nothing in their heart to be redeemed there are people out here in this world that will never be redeemed they're non-redeemable they don't want to be redeemed they want to be religious but they don't want to come back to the word because they were never there you came Jesus said I come from God and I'm going back to God I say you came from God and you're going back to God he's come to redeem you serpents children look at hey look look at look at Cain Cain had nothing to repent with God even gave him the grace God looked and said listen if your father people the son of Adam the son of me if you'll follow his nature and offer what I'm asking I'll accept your offering you're the son of the serpent but I will accept your offering if you do it the way that Abel's doing it and Cain said [Music] you accept my offering the way I'm giving it read the Bible God gave him a chance to do it Abel's way he was the son of his father the serpent can I just can I give you one more scripture here real quick Hallelujah do you love him amen hallelujah he'll be in it'll be in John I'm I'm pretty certain if I can find it here amen [Music] Hallelujah Oh Sister keys I'm missing it again I'm preaching a lot without notes amen you're of your father the devil just find that one Hallelujah [Music] it was eighth chapter foreign [Music] let's go here to Rome us John 8. [Music] and we'll look there at the 38th verse I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father they answered and said unto him Abraham is Our Father and Jesus said if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do all you you do the Deeds of your father and watch him watch him what'd they say they said unto him we be not born a fornication they knew the serpent seat even back then did you know that that the Jews teach the serpent seat we'll be not born of fornication we have one father and that is God and Jesus answered and said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my words you are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning going all the way back to Cain and Abode not in truth because there is no truth in him he speaks a lie or when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convince of me of sin if I say the truth and why do you not believe me he that of God everybody say he that is of god here's God's words you therefore hear them not because you are not of God well it's pretty plain and simple it's hard it's hard to get that rep that into a religious mind isn't it it's hard in this last days with this humanistic thinking isn't it but I'm here to tell you God's pick and when God if you've got a desire in your heart to love God and there's a desire in your heart to serving

for I have given unto them the words that thou has gave us me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee they have believed that thou did send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but I pray for them which thou has given me it's a little bit different when you really truly find what the Bible says about you laodicea's interpretation of the Bible as a bunch of hogwash barbaric it is Satan setting on the throne of the church like he wanted to in Isaiah the 14th chapter the Antichrist spirit is reigning over this laodicea church [Music] oh yeah they
