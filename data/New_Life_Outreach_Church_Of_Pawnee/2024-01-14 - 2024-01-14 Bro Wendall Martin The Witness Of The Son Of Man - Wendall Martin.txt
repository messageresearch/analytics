half half hour trip uh with the snow threatening like it was and so uh we we sure miss brother Steve the Cochrans and and um just everyone else that's not here today we want to uh pray for them amen um let's look here at at Revelations 10 and and one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his feet were as it were the Sun or or his his face as it were the sun his feet as the pillars of fire he had in his hand a little book and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the on the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things that uh are therein that there should be no more time and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel and that which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and E it up and it shall be uh it shall make thy better belly bitter and it shall be to thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations tongues and Kings amen Psalms 119 and 10 you don't have to turn there but it says with my whole heart have I sought thee oh let me not wonderer from thy Commandments father we just ask that you would be with us today what a special day it is Lord to have our friends Lord that we have known for such a long time with us from Canada and it's good to see that they're doing well and ser in you and Lord blessing your people wherever they go and we just ask a real special blessing upon them their Church their Pastor brother Danny far and sister Dela I pray Lord that your blessings would be with all of the those in the congregation that Lord that are not here this morning whether they be sick or Lord some of our elders just staying home Lord and and watching from uh the internet Lord I I just pray that you'll be with them today I pray holy spirit that your anointing would be upon your word to our hearts we love you Lord with all that we are we thank you for what this message means to us that we give ourselves to you in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen you may be seated um like to say that it's it's good to have uh dad back with us here to this morning and and uh he's spent a couple days in the hospital himself and and uh but good to see uh him him doing well and and uh up and and walking and I I'm just I'm just looking forward to uh a total total healing for d I I just believe God's our deliverer I I'm believeing 2024 is the year of Miracles and and I'm looking forward to what God's going to do how many believes God still heals Parkinson's amen I I truly believe that I just got to I want to speak on faith here this morning and um uh you know faith has got to have a foundation and we have been uh we we've dealt a little bit with the witness or or with the son of man and how amen that we are uh that the promise was right before the coming of the Lord that the son the the son of man would be revealed in the time of in the evening time when the um when when the Sodom condition uh would would um be the prevailing Spirit In the Land amen and and and we know that uh as as Sodom was being prepared to burn the son of man was there preparing the hearts of Abraham and Sarah for the promise that they had been waiting on Amen and so it took the witness of the son of man witnessing to the words of promise that had already been spoke to to Abraham and Sarah that they had been waiting on for 25 years waiting for this promise to come and so they had been Faithfully waiting upon the word they had stood uh against the the elements of time they had been uh waiting for 24 years when the son of man appeared and and and in the form of a of a man Prophet God had come and ministered to their hearts amen and told them that they truly would have that that child and so I want to speak this morning because I believe the son of man is here on the earth now brother brandham was a son of man amen he was the revelations 10:7 but the son of man is Revelations 10:1 that that has come with a mighty book and and that book has been open and God has declared who you are the Seals have been taken off of the book so that you can understand that you're not just a church system but that you are the very bride of Jesus Christ amen I I I say if you're looking for the bride of Christ and if you're looking for God look no further just look to your neighbor amen and you'll see God because you are the manifestation of the promises of God in this day that we're we're living in amen so the the rock of God's word should forever more be our tpost the word of God must be amen our our only foundation our desire should always be Lord never let me Drift from your word if your word has spoken and your word has been brought To Us by Malachi 4 in this day to day God give me a heart to never allow that word to to wonder from my heart can you say amen amen I want to say here this morning that his word is the only thing that is secure amen it is secure it is his word that he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will endure forever it'll stand the test of time well praise the Lord I I I want to say what you have embraced in your heart this revelation of the word of God in your heart is something that'll take you right on into the Rapture it'll take you into the Rapture now he didn't say there wasn't going to be hard times he didn't say there wouldn't going to be amen times of discouragement and Times of disappointments and Times of sickness and Times of wondering but he did say I've given you my promise and that promise I will keep to you amen well praise the lord it's greater than anything past it is greater than anything current it is greater than anything in the future the word of God is the greatest thing well praise the Lord amen I say the word of God it it it supersedes it surpasses any Revelation that you may have amen the word of God should should supersede any idea amen any kind of a thought that is contrary to the word of God the word of God should supersede it all the word should be our absolute how many believes that here this morning the word must be forever more our absolute hallelujah it's the anchor amen there is no Revelation secure unless it comes from scripture amen now I know there's some people that think they've got a greater Revelation than brother Bram or they've got a higher Revelation amen but I want tell you you'll never come any greater Revelation than what has been brought to us in our generation God sent us Malachi 4 to turn our hearts back to this and this is what we stand upon Amen brother brenon would say in the church age book he would say the word of God is forever settled in heaven and before one Speck of Stardust was made God's word God's law was there exactly as it is written in our Bible well that should make you want to shout hallelujah amen another place he says faith takes its position on the rock of God's word and all the waves of Hell beating against its foundation it'll take its Eagle Eye and soar Beyond them clouds and see the god of the resurrection and of Promise amen I it it doesn't matter Faith takes that stand Faith rests upon the Rock of God's word and there is nothing that hell can do to destroy or to take back what God has already said can you say Amen so I want to get that established this morning the word of God must be the foundation for faith if you want Faith you've got to have something for Faith to rest upon you can't rest it upon feelings you can't rest it upon gifts you can't rest it upon upon emotions you've got to rest it upon the word that's why God sent us a prophet in this day he sent a prophet because it was going to take a rapturing faith and that rapturing faith has got to have a word that would be unmovable for your faith to stand upon hallelujah amen let the waves of Hell come amen pouring over your souls when the gates of hell are bombarding you you can stand there upon that f Foundation because God's word cannot fail God's word well praise the lord well you say well I I've been battling my sickness I've been battling in my mind God's word cannot fail if Satan can take your faith and get you away from what God's word is saying then then he's got you with he's got you be but if you will take your faith and you will base it upon the word of God instead of what you're feeling it will bring you out of your current situation amen hallelujah that Foundation remains solid and true no matter what praise the Lord amen so the word of God thinking here this morning amen is as as I I begin to think about this this incredible witness of this last day and how that when God sent this prophet he he didn't really point us to his gift he didn't point us to uh uh uh the nine spiritual gifts so much he didn't point us to organization and and you know we we we appreciate all the nine spiritual gifts and we appreciate all of these things that God gave us amen and and that's all part of it but there's one thing that brother brandham wanted to to Really drive home is stay with the word I think any Pastor would want to do the same thing stay with that word amen amen there's going to be many interpretations but you stay with the word because interpretations will die with the man but God's word cannot fail amen praise the Lord so the word of God it's endured amen I all the world's uh philosophy it has endured Kings and kingdoms it it has endured thousands of denominations and yet the word is still the same it has not changed with culture it has not changed with time there has been kingdoms come kingdoms fall there's been King cultures rise cultures fall but the word Still Remains the Same amen for thousands and thousands of years and when you base your faith upon that word you you can remain the same you can stand in the battle you can stand when the enemy is fighting against you Amen brother Brandon would say he says all of the waves of hell are beating against its foundation but it'll take its Eagle Eye and soar Beyond them clouds and will see the god of the resurrection and promise can you say amen amen the revelation of the word of God will take you out amen it brought Israel out of Egypt why because a prophet of God came into that land and begin to tell them God has heard your cry and God has said you've got a land I know you've been in bondage for 400 years I know you are slaves I know amen that you know nothing about freedom but the prophet came and the prophet had the sayith the Lord and the prophet says God sees you beyond slavery he sees you beyond your circumstance he's going to take you to the promise can you say Amen you have to see the Promise you've got to put your faith not in your situation you've got to put your faith in the word of God hallelujah can you say Amen Israel might look at him and say you don't understand we are under the bondage of sin we're under the bondage of pharaoh but he came with a word that was absolute and full of power well praise the Lord faith faith put you takes you out of the Well's belly and places you on the foundation of the word Faith takes you out of the Lion's Den now you're still in the Lion's Den but your faith is perched upon the realities of an unfailing word well praise the Lord does that just make you feel good faith takes you beyond where you are and places you in a Rapture hallelujah what can you say Amen amen you know why Satan hates Revelation amen because Revelation takes you out of your dungeon that he's got you in and places you and you can see the way God sees you do you realize that God sees you perfect do you realize that God sees you in a Rapture do you realize that God's already got your name in the Lamb's Book of Life do you realize you've already got a seat there at that marriage table of the Lamb I'm telling you you're already there amen Satan don't want you to believe it amen he tries to take the word away from you if he can keep the word away from you he's going to keep you living in darkness right if he can take that word away from you you're living in discouragement if he can take that word away from you amen you're you're defeated you're condemned you're dis courage but if you can ever rise on the wings of the Eagles of Faith then you can see God's promise and you can live above it all even right here on this Sunday morning when it's cold cold cold and the Holy Spirit can warm your heart with thus sayeth the Lord amen that's right it's only through the light of the word when you're walking in dark Darkness thy light Thy word is a lamp under my feet it's a light under my path it's a revelation to me when everything else is all dark around me I've got your light and it's not just a flashlight it's a Divine revelated Light it's a light that tells me I know where I'm what I'm feeling but but God's word says something different it it it's a word that says you're you're in darkness right now but there is God's word says I I i' I I've got a I've got a well body I I I've got even my children are going to be saved my God says you you see what I'm saying it does not matter where you are you're walking in the Valley of the shadow of death but you're not fearing evil because he the shepherd is with me amen the Good Shepherd is leading me he's not going to keep me in the valley of death he's going to take me into that place that he's ordained for me hallelujah amen the son of man it's always been God it's always been God saying I've got an end for you I know the thoughts that I think about you and I'm going to give you an expected end a determined end a predestinated end I've got well glory to God all we've got to do is Lord get the let the Holy Spirit open my eyes to see it can you say Amen you see it's only through the light of the word amen now we stand here today we know the darkness is all around us and it looks crazy right now especially over there in the Middle East and how the United States has dropped a few bombs and now supposed to be some more retaliation and and and there's there's there's we just don't know what's going to happen Amen in that little battle over there we do know we do know that Russia's got a bomb we do know that there's got to be a Superman that's going to stand up and say hey I've got the answer to the world we do know amen that this stuff is coming on us and brother how many how many can sense that we're really close but in the midst of a dark gloomy World God is saying this is not your end this is not who you hallelujah oh can you say Amen I'm so glad for the eyes of Revelation that said amen don't you fear communism don't you fear Russia I want you to watch Rome keep your eyes on Rome amen can you say Amen what is it it's divine revelation in an hour of darkness when they're looking at this God says look at this amen well Glory I feel pretty good even on a cold Sunday morning Revelation can always be found right in the middle of God's promises yes sir amen praise the Lord where's the believer found right in the middle why did God have to open the seals because you were sealed in behind those seals come on your name's on that book yeah Satan's been trying to take you out all all down Through the Ages he's tried to stop this Rapture but he can't stop the Rapture he hasn't stopped the Rapture and he ain't going to stop me hallu because I'm found right in the middle of God's word so that's where I'm going to make my Abode that's where I'm going to stand that's where I'm going to live that's what I'm going to believe that's what God said to to me and I'm going to stand upon that word amen well praise the Lord do you love him yes amen I'm going to walk through canaan's land because my name is written on canaan's land I'm going to slay the Giants because God said I'm going to slay the Giants I'm going to enjoy canan's grapes because God said he was taking me to a place with with grapes and honey and pomegranate I'm here because God said I would be here amen amen now this son of man anointing it's lifted us up somebody say hallelujah hallelujah out of this Le oia sespo of men's ideas and opinions and has put us into the realm of divine Faith soaring in the Heavenly places with the Eagles amen and all the chains of Earth can not keep you down the book is unsealed and my faith is unlimited brother Bram would say in Heavenly places not just anywhere but in Heavenly places we are assembl in Heavenly it means that the position of the believer now if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up and the church is prayed up and we we're we're and we're ready for the message and we've assembled ourselves together as the Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in Heavenly places we are heavenlies in our soul our Spirits has brought us into this heavenly atmosphere Oh Glory there you are a Heavenly atmosphere and what could happen tonight what could happen right here this morning what could happen tonight again he says if we would be sitting here in the Heavenly atmosphere and the holy Spirit moving over our heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus all the sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God and our hearts lifted sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in the Heavenly places he says did you ever sit in one oh I've sit till I've weep I would Weep For Joy and say God never let me leave this place just Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen can you say Amen now amen so he's telling us there's that Heavenly atmosphere that we can be though we never even leave the the room well glory to God now you can be in you can be in the dark dungeon of Satan and never leave the room neither you can be in the dark dark dark dungeon of depression amen while sitting in this room you you you you you can be guarded by the evil powers of unbelief amen hovering over your soul well glory to God but this message has come to set us free set us free why because we're not chickens come on hallelujah we're not chickens we're eagles eagles eat chickens chickens can't fly with eagles you're a son and a daughter of God God you can step Hallelujah though you've never left this building this morning you can go into those heavenly rims with Christ in your faith in your soul and you can see the god of impossibilities right there with your own eyes amen hallelujah oh what would happen this morning if we would just let go and release our faith there's no telling all skepticism kicked out all doubt squatched all sin put under the blood and we sitting here this morning Pure Clean undefiled thoughtless before God and believing What God Says for Our Generation well praise the Lord been washed with the blood of Jesus Christ the word has come and cleansed us separated us from the prostitutes amen of Leota and has brought us as a bride amen as a virgin bride before him and let the Holy Spirit ignite the faith you know what that would create right now it would begin to create a vision because when you come into His presence you begin to see things the way he sees things now I want you to look at that now Faith is not something that we're just that that it's not a blind faith faith is not just blind and wishing amen but faith when it comes into that rim with God you can see the way God sees God gives you a vision he shows you where you are where you're going the clouds go back and you can see what God has for you Abraham amen went for for 25 years walking what kept Abraham Walking with God his faith was not looking at his old body that's right his faith was not looking at Sarah who has never been able to have a child amen and now she is she is many years amen past menopause she she is amen her her body is is is is dying by the minute his body is dying by the minute can you say Amen but the scripture says his faith grew stronger the longer that it took right that wasn't Blind Faith brother that was a vision that was a vision faith become a v you don't have to be a prophet to have a vision you do not have to have someone to lay hands on you and prophesy over you to have a vision Faith your faith when it gets out of this realm into that realm then you can see the way God sees [Music] it then it don't matter praise the Lorden you know what brother brandham says he says it's a place just you and God alone I want you to think about that have you ever been in the presence of God and then you run into somebody that's not been in the presence of God and your faith is just and you never want to leave that presence and that's right then you go talk to another man that's not been in the presence of God and he's got negative stuff and that's right he's full of doubts and he's talking about the situation and before you know it you're so miserable because you've just been here and this man is pulling you down well praise the Lord amen that's the reason I said here while back Hallelujah if your friends ain't taking you and taking you higher maybe you ought to find another friend because we need friends that's going to take us higher well praise the Lord right amen you know they they they begin to tell you what they're looking at you've been seeing healing you've been seeing Victory you're seeing things that God's going to do for the church what God's going to do for your children what God's going to do for for your husband or your wife you're seeing these things and and and then when you begin to talk to them all they can see is sickness and all they can see is men uh you know they're looking at the bills and they're seeing the troubles all around oh praise the Lord amen reminds me of Pharaoh Pharaoh all the he could see when he's looking out the window was a bunch of mud dobers all he could see was a bunch of miserable Israelites that were now slaves to him Hallelujah but brother bradam says when Moses looked out the same window he looked out the same window looking at the same people and he saw a promise he saw Covenant people he saw a nation he he saw a mighty nation a mighty nation while still sitting right there in slavery why because the burning bush gave him another outlook on life amen amen what are you looking at this morning what are you looking at this morning are we walking in faith are we seeing that God is our deliverer God is our healer God is our provider what are you seeing this morning amen you may be going through something a lot worse than somebody else down the road maybe maybe you've gone through something and the world's falling apart and yet you've got faith and joy and peace there might be somebody across the aisle a man that doesn't have it near as bad as you and they're they're in the Molly grubs and but here you are you're you're standing there because you have got a vision you have done seen it God says this is just a comma not a period you're in a comma phase of your life you're not in the this is not the final thing it is going to take you to your Victory why because you're walking in a world all alone with God you can't expect somebody else to see it it's you and God you are looking at and you are embracing healing because you're there it's real it's divine amen you're rejoicing with joy unspeakable because you're there you see it it is yours brother if you can't see it this morning I want you just pray that the Lord just open your eyes huh ju ju just like the old servant when the servant came and says alas Master amen they've got us surrounded we're going to die they're going to come and they're going to kill us and the prophet now he had already been walking with God and apparently he was walking with God Alone Gaza was right there with him but he he wasn't in the same place with well are you hearing me and what did he say oh Lord open this Poor Boy's eyes let him see let him see let him see and then and then what happened the Bible says the boy's eyes were open and then he could see all of the Chariots of the host of God the flame and fire all around why it it it's so surpassed amen the the mighty Army of Syria why because he was able to see in theen it's not that you're making it up it's not that you're trying to make something happen there are real angels and they're at your disposal there is a real God and he is the captain of your salvation there is a reality in that in invisible real and it's that invisible real that contacts that soul and you have the ability to stand there and believe God in the midst of the cancer in the midst of the discouragement in the midst of the Parkinson's in the midst of the sickness it doesn't matter what RSV says what it says is God is my answer God's our answer God brings us out this is not the figment of man's imagination and the realities of this message is to bring Jesus Christ to Earth can you say Amen we walk with God in that unique realm as brother Aaron and Sister Christina was singing the song I Feel the pool I feel the pool there's something calling me that word is lying way down in here it's a predestinated seed and there's a God a real God that is pulling that to life can you say Amen 2 Corinthians 4:18 says while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal somebody say temporal temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal oh that makes me want to do some shouting about right now can you say Amen you can look at that you can look at that temporal thing and Say Goodbye you're not here for long you can look at that temporal feeling and Say Goodbye you're not here for long I'm not going to embrace you I'm not going to feed you you are here amen it has come to pass Hallelujah it it's not going to stay I have got an absolute it is God's word can you say amen hallelujah so so the Apostle Paul would say Amen now listen he he would say you you you've got to put on the mind of Christ this Vision that God is painting is is a vision that can only come by the word of God because faith can only come from the word so you've got to look at this word except this is your absolute and ask God to give you a vision of it give you a revelation and where you can stand put yourself in Abraham's condition put yourself Amen in the widow woman's condition put yourself in that place they are types of who you are can you say Amen now Isaiah 53 And1 says who has believed our report right and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed Paul would pick it up in Romans 10 and8 and he say but I said have they heard have they not heard yes verely their sound went into all the Earth and their words unto the ends of the world yeah they heard going up 16th verse says but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have believed they've heard yes but they didn't believe but Isaiah was saying who has heard and who has believed and who will the arm of the Lord be made real to right are y'all hearing me Lord I want your word I want your arm I I want your arm to be strong in wendle Martin this year I want 2024 to be the year of God's strong arm revealed I well y'all can do what you want to but reveal to wle Martin you say oh that's pretty arrogant well Hallelujah I am his son and I have a right to believe it that word has came to me it's got to be my vision my vision won't work for you your vision won't work for me you got to take that vision for yourself and say I am going to stand upon the word of God I'm going to believe the word of God come on Church come on my my vision my Revelation ain't ain't going to do you that's why you've got to have the Holy Ghost I've got to have the Holy Ghost we're baptized into this body by one Spirit Hallelujah I want the arm of the Lord to be revealed to me and the only way it's going to be revealed to me is to believe what I have heard in this generation amen how many's ready to believe amen what you have heard Hallelujah I'm not going to be a forgetful hearer I'm not just going to come to church and go do my own thing I'm I'm coming to church because I want to hear the words of the Lord I'm pushing play because I want to hear the words of the Lord I am doing this because I want the arm of the Lord to be revealed strong in my life amen that's right praise the Lord so it's not simply the word being preached it's the word being received I'm not going to sit another year in the church amen I want the vision that God has for me when brother brandham seen a vision he had absolute Assurance it didn't matter he he had said he said if the Lord would tell me if the Lord had told me to go down to the graveyard and to call George Washington from the grave yeah he said I'd tell the whole world he said I wouldn't be a bit scared I'd invite the whole world to come down and watch because God said it if I seen it and God said it I would have enough Faith to believe that Vision amen and I'd have the whole world to be watching well that's a prophet that had a lot of faith in the vision that God gave him that's right well can you say Amen when he when when when brother brandham stood there he had already been he had already went across the world telling everyone write it in the fly leaf of your Bible amen there's going to be a a dead boy raised and and it's going to be a hilly country with rocks and it's going to be this and the foot's going to stick out like this and there's going to be this and that and he's going to be dead he said God's going to raise it he went around he went around the country for two years saying it's going to happen God gave me the vision it's going to happen yeah amen and then and then here he so so there he was over there in um uh not Scotland where where Finland he there he was over there in Finland and and they came up on a wreck and and or you know someone would hit some a boy and so they they pulled out brother brandham always stopped they said brother brand would always stop to pray for for if there was a car wreck or something and uh so he and the and the Evangelistic team got out and and and brother Brandon walked over there and he seen this boy laying there and it was so and he turned his stomach and he he he turned around to go back he's his he was already homesick been missing his own babies and and uh it just made him think about his kids at home and and so now he's going he he and as he's turning around he's he's turning around to go back to the car a hand grabbed his shoulder yeah and brother brandham turned around and there wasn't no one there right brother BR thought H now brother bradam was fixing to miss the vision too and he'd been going around telling everybody it's going to happen and now brother bram's walking away from the vision brother bram's walking getting in the car cuz his stomach was sick he he's missing his children at home about the same age of as as as U I believe she I think he said Rebecca one of the girls and and so uh that and then something said to go back and showed him the hill showed him the Rocks showed him the condition and then he he sat there thinking and he says now brother I I believe it was I believe it was Brother Moore I believe he said brother brother Moore is there is there something about this in one of the visions and then it came to him then he walks over there and he looks at this child he looks at the car he looks at everything then he says if this boy isn't standing up here in the next few minutes run me out cuz I'm a false prophet oh what is it he's seen him himself in the vision before it made him sick before he he was he was ready to get out of there but now he's standing there why because he can base his faith upon thus saith the Lord and then so God raised him up God God raised that boy up well now the vision didn't show anything about the other boy there was a second boy right that was that that was fighting for its breath and dying well the parents are now calling to brother brandham and saying you you uh you you raised this one up come and pray and they said listen he said I I I've done this by Vision I I I I can pray but I and and and and they just kept going but he but he didn't have a word of the Lord y'all remember that y'all remember the story and then and then and and and they kept asking and calling asking and calling and asking and calling and and brother brandom couldn't give him anything because he didn't have he didn't have a vision didn't have thus sayith the Lord and then and then he had the vision remember him the two the two candies and and he and he ate the one and it was sweet and he ate the other and he spit it back out and and and and and it was so bitter and then the angel of the Lord says if you don't eat that candy that boy won't live and and or that and and remember the plants the two plants there his Visions were a lot by by symbology and and so when he ate the one it went up and then this other one you know when when he spit it it was going up then he spit it back out and it wilted back again and and and so it says it won't it won't live unless you eat that candy so it eats the candy and then it's and then it lives and then the angel of the Lord tells him that boy will live and and and and then he's got all of Heaven backing him up and he goes and the boy lifts y'all remember the story if you haven't if you haven't heard it no go back it's it's incredible because he was relying now but there was and and and and we could say that on on on on the brother Bram says that he said when he went to India and he had those 17 different uh the the different religions behind him and and and he said I would have never I would have never done what I'd done on this platform and and and challenge those guys when they when I had Billy to go out and and and find find somebody and when when the when the man came up the man was totally he didn't have his eyes he had been he had been worshiping the Sun and his eyes were totally gone it was it was it was gone and so as he's walking and then turns around and he says I would have never told these guys if any of your Gods can do this go come over here and do it he said but I already seen it in a vision and my faith was in that Vision I knew it was going to happen because I seen it Hallelujah amen now I want you to really think have you ever thought about that Billy Paul went to go get the boy brother brandom had already had the vision Billy God directed Billy Paul to go get the guy didn't I he says go pick the worst case you can find didn't tell him blind lame didn't tell him anything he brings him up it's the same guy that brother random had already seen in the vision God is in control it's God's word if we can put our faith in God's word we hallelujah amen the Lord healed him can you say Amen another place brother Brandon would say he would say now about the man that had support him there I believe it was in Kansas um I I believe it was in in Kansas City and he stuck his neck out on the line and and and it and it uh uh uh uh supported brother pranam and was a great financial help to brother brandham and now brother brandham or or now the call just came in and said that a wall he he was a a wall just fell on top of him thousands and thousands of pounds and he's crushed underne and it's just he he just he is so mashed and crushed and and and the word came and brother Brandon was saying oh he's such a good man he's there there talking to meet him he says he's such a good man he's he's he's supported he's so he says I if I could just see a vision of him I it would be I I would go and and praise say if Jesus was here he would take his holy hands and he would go down because he's holy and he's and he's just and he's pure and and he would lay his righteous hands and I know the boy the man would live he said but I can't see a vision in my hands I I can't go pray for him and then the revelation truck Lord it said but you are the [Music] redeemed his blood was shed so that your hands can be holy so that your voice can be pure so that your prayer can be prayed in faith praise the Lord and he's looking there and he's he's thinking about this and he he says that's right the lamb has been shed so that I can pray and he goes and he lays his hands on him with a genuine faith believing that God still hears prayer and that God would heal and God raised the boy the man up from the grave it was something greater than a normal vision because God done these things to show you you don't have to be a prophet in order to see things the way God sees things amen it took a prophet to show us that faith in that word will bring God on the seat amen hallelujah oh can you say amen amen yes yes you see Thy word amen Thy word is a lamp you see God lifted would would would lift brother brandom up amen and he could see past the Circumstance the present condition and the prophet message has come this son of man message has come to lift us out of these perversions to declare that God is here right now the mighty Angel is on the earth it didn't go back to heaven when mother Bram died the mighty Angel is here that's right and what did the eth verse just tell us it didn't say for us to go to brother brandham because brother brandham would already be off the scene the book is now open and now he's saying go to the angel take the book eat the book get Faith from the book then you can start prophesying you can start saying the same things that the book says you can believe the same thing read the open book it was closed no one understood it no one could well Isaiah said the same thing he says he says it the people has become amen one that like one that is blind that does not know how to read or that the book is sealed and no one knows how to open it Hallelujah but here in this Grand manifestation of this message it brought God from out of those invisible rims into this rim with the bride to take you you can believe God for the for the impossibilities you can come on Church don't you let your mind wander off from this word that says you can be healed don't you let your eyes you see we're not following the signs we're following the word and the signs follow the Believers just stay with that word and believe that word amen it'll bring the super natural that's right believe what it says brother Ram says now if you leave that word you have left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages I'm the word and if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that can you say Amen now this morning though there be just a few of us that are here some of the rest of you are listening in online you may not be feeling well the devil may be hindering you but brother brandham in the inside man he he told us that the he Heavenly atmosphere of the Holy Ghost creates the vision and then brings it to pass this this heavenly atmosphere that I'm telling you this anointing it's not the same anointing that has been hidden the church ages it's it's not it's not just that but this last anointing in the days of Sodom he reveal himself the son of man shall reveal himself Among Us not a c a man it wasn't brother brandom revealing himself it was the God great God Eternal God the Loos God the word that when he spoke creation came up in the beginning the great eternal one Hallelujah that great Elohim the one with many attributes and you were one of those attributes you were in him and he knew you were coming in this last day and he knew it was going to be impossible but if you can reach out and say God I am the one that you've prophesied for this day to defeat the Devil right here in Leon don't matter the sickness don't matter where I'm at I have a right to stand upon this word and believe every promise of God and claim it to be mine I have a right I have a right for peace in my family I have a right for the Salvation of my children I have a right to believe peace of mind I have a right to [Applause] believe oh oh mighty Angel Mighty Angel brother bam says that would be none else than Christ that great logos Almighty Angel come with your book open the book to me I want to eat I want to partake almighty God Of Heaven oh great Holy Spirit come this morning and make your word to live in me can you say amen amen I want a clear-cut vision this year what does the word say we can have amen well I believe we can have peace in our families I believe we can have a wonderful marriage if the Bible says if this book says husbands love your wives as Christ has loved the church that means that's a promise that you can have if the Bible says wife am man honor and respect her husband and be obedience and then that's a scripture for you that says I can have that amen if if the Bible says amen that all of the jailers children was saved and the prophet gave his interpretation and says the same faith that you have for yourself you can use it for your children you can stand up and say I believe that for me Hallelujah if the Bibles if the Bible says it then God don't let it be here but give me a vision of a well family give me a vision of Saved children give me a vision of the baptism of the Holy Ghost give me a vision of it God let me see myself in you amen can you say Amen not that I'm having a natural vision I am not a Prophet come on but I'm taking the vision that the prophet has made clear to me yeah and I'm saying yes that's what I am oh can you say amen amen in your health I am the god that Health thee yes then you can say not my brother not my sister but it's me oh Lord can you say amen I am coming with this brother brandom says now he says you pray and standing Yonder in the future you can see a Wellman or woman standing there yes that's it that's just it they'll walk right into that just as certain as anything because you believe it God has spoke it and you know it's so am so here I am I'm listening to the message whether at church or whether whether listening at home I'm a firm believer that we need to be listening to the message at home and when you're
