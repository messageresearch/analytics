on someone you'd ask the lord to just touch that person beside you tonight that the word of life would just speak to their knee tonight father lord we've come here tonight as your children we're we're

may you walk the aisles of this building oh lord may you make yourself real among us or god we're asking you for the fire of god to burn through lord every bit of the fog or the myth that would be upon a heart or a life lord let your spirit just ignite and anoint every heart in this building and lord jesus we invite you this evening we invite you to the platform we invite you into your word lord and we're asking you now that you would lead us lord and give us of that divine mercy lord as we speak your word god may you be the voice behind the voice and we're asking you for these things in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen and god bless you if you have your bibles tonight we would just like to get right into the word of life we're going to go to the scripture in the book of matthew the seventh chapter amen matthew chapter 7. there's been a there's been enough word preached this week to save the entire planet amen these these guys they'll preach hour and a half or so and it's nothing but word on word and it's just it's just amazing amen all the filler gets cut out and the word gets preached amen amen matthew the seventh chapter i want to read the 28th and the 29th verse matthew 7 verse 28 29 and it came to pass when jesus and into these sayings that the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes for he taught us one having authority and not as the scribes in matthew 17 and verse 5. this is the mount transfiguration experience matthew 17. and verse 5 and while he spake behold a bread a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of this cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him we ask the lord to bless his word as you can be seated i want to speak to you tonight for just a few minutes here upon the thought of the authority of the new creation the authority of the new creation amen when i'm reading this portion of scripture of course speaking about the lord jesus and the authority that he exercised while he was on the earth the bible tells us that when he taught of course he taught one as having authority in other words he knew what he was talking about and he wasn't asking the pharisees for their uh for their direction or for their what they thought the scripture meant they he hadn't been to any of their schools and he didn't come through any of their theological ideas but yet he taught the scripture as if he knew exactly what it meant and they noticed that he taught with authority without doubt or without question with no darkness in it now of course this this is what set jesus apart in his ministry in that that he was the interpretation of the actual word now in matthew 17 when you read here this is a is a portion of scripture that speaks about the transfiguration of jesus christ which is uh better known the adoption on mount transfiguration now what what is happening here in the scripture is that jesus has taken three men went upon this mountain and while he was there they was there was jesus was transfigured before them and the in the cloud that overshadowed them let them know that jesus was the place of god's authority now what we've what we find out about this is brother brahma will say it like this he said now i would take a text on hear ye him after all he's the voice of authority now god himself witnessed to that and said hear ye him therefore there are many voices in the world today many things going on many doctrines or isms but hear him see he's the voice of final authority he's the one that'll speak he's the one that said the heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never fail so hear ye him he's the one to listen to when you wonder who should you listen to jesus is the one you listen to he is the one it's his voice now if you're if you if you like to study the the scripture you'll find out that it was john that introduced jesus a couple of verses or chapters earlier and the scripture tells us that when he went to the river jordan that john's uh job john's entire job was to identify jesus when he come he was different than all the other prophets everybody else prophesied of his coming but john identified him when he did come and and and the scripture tells us that when he saw him the bible said that a voice spake and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in is that right now now it's it's a little bit later a few days later that jesus comes up here in matthew 17 he takes three disciples goes up on top of the mountain and while he's up there that same voice speaks but it said this is my beloved son and adds those words to it hear ye him now when this happened what was going on is god was identifying that jesus is the way the truth the life he is the authority so if you're going to get salvation it's through jesus christ if you're going to have truth it's jesus christ people say to me all times well who has truth jesus is truth is that right he he is all healing is through jesus christ all salvation is through jesus christ he is the supreme authority it's in him where he is the voice of final authority he's the one amen that you have to go to now the scripture says hear ye him now if it says hear ye him then you're looking at a prophecy that he will speak right if if the scripture says to you hear ye him then that's a prophecy he's going to speak do you see that now if if he is going to speak he's going to be the voice of authority when he speaks now the bible will tell us in john chapter 5 and verse 24 that he who that hears his voice and believes that voice the bible said he's passed from death unto life and shall not come into condemnation is that right so we find out then if you're hearing a voice tonight how do you know the voice you're hearing is the voice of jesus christ there's a lot of people today claim to have salvation and they say we hear his voice but how do you know the voice you're hearing is the voice of god unless you can trace this voice all the way back to the physical body of jesus christ you're not sure what you're hearing amen but in this generation god has given us the grace to have an abstract upon the voice that we are listening to and it has been traced from the literal body of jesus christ right up through seven church ages and messengers until it come all the way to the end and then the bible tells us that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound that the mystery of god should be finished as it has been given unto the servants of prophets now that prophet stood here in the end time and said i meant that he appointed a final voice to a final age and it would be a bride who would come under the authority of that word and they would stand in the same authority that spoke two thousand years ago would be speaking the word in this generation there still remains a voice of authority there still remains a voice on the earth today god still has a bride and he still has a voice amen amen i believe it i believe personally that the scripture are teaching us that we have come to a mount transfiguration experience today that we have heard that same voice speak out of heaven and say this is my beloved one hear ye him amen this is adoption time church we had a river jordan and we had a mount transfiguration but we've now had an ohio river and we've had a sunset mountain and that same voice has identified an authority on the earth today i don't believe we're in confusion i believe that god has identified something in this generation now the prophet of god says in spoken word original see he said listen now in the last days there'll be a true church bribe it'll come to the headstone and we will be a super church a super race as we near that headstone they will be so much like him even they will be in this very image in order to be united with him they will have to be the very manifestation of the living word of god denominations can never produce this they will produce creeds and dogmas mixed with their word it will be a hybrid product but nothing can produce the word made manifest outside of god himself and here what we're looking at is is we're not in the in the time of the beginning of the church we're not down here in the time of faith or temperance or amen we're not just in the in the middle of this of this mountain of transfiguration but the church of the living god amen has been brought up to the headstone we've been brought up to the capstone in this age which speaks something to us as we near that headstone the church will be a super church she will be a super race now if a prophet identified were in that time whether you understand this or not you are a super church you are a super race and i think it's time you start acting like who god said you are amen we're not just a trodden down little group of nobodies sitting in the corner amen but god by his own voice has identified his pride as a super church as a super race as an authority in the word of god of course amen there's going to be a contentions on this there's going to be others that's not going to like this but listen we are coming to the time of the adoption of the church in ephesians 1 paul said we were predestinated unto the adoption in other words predestinated god saw a destiny you wasn't going to be shuck you wasn't going to be stuck you were coming to be seen there's a destiny over your life it's to be conformed into the image of the son of god we are not to be a church we are to be a bride and that bride will be a manifestation of every word that is written in this bible we are not here for church memberships we are not here for social events we are here to manifest the presence of almighty god in this generation until this age knows there's a bride and that blood has a husband and that husband is almighty god i believe we're coming to a fullness of adoption people say to me since i've been a little boy preaching this message they'd say to me brother wayne you know this adoption y'all talk about isn't that the body change isn't that the body change i say absolutely for sure the fullness of adoption is the body change but what about first john the third chapter but what about it when the bible said what kind of love has god gave us that he could call us the sons of god now i'll tell you if he says manner that's two kinds right that's a god praying divine what kind of love did god love you with he could take you in your unruly place in the situations of your life and all of your problems and he could call you a son of god now people say well does that mean daughter of course it means an attribute whether that attribute is a male or female that has nothing to do with it as a son of god you are an attribute of god and that means you come from god so you can go back to god now the bible said that we are now the sons of god we are right now attributes of almighty god manifested in a time amen which we came from eternity so there's an eternal quality to the elect now the bible said as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of god now that's not power like muscle power that's a liberty that's a fire team now i just have to put this the best way i know how to say it amen you were always sons [Applause] you never become son on any day you never became a son when you became a christian you never became that when you came into the message you always were a son come on church we're talking about eternal life when did eternity begin tell me there was no beginning to eternity eternity always was and if you're a son or a daughter of god you always were a son or daughter of god and that's the reason you receive the word when you come into your age because god anointed you to see it and to receive it into your age and because you are a son he has sent forth the spirit of his son whereby we would cry at my father brother we would call him our daddy amen we have now received the spirit of adoption whereby as being sons as being seed as being seen are you with me now i don't know if we got any doctors in the building amen probably has some kind of physician assistants or nurses or somebody and medical people amen uh or just hillbillies could answer this is there anybody in this building that wasn't a seed before they were human did anybody did anybody in this building get a birth without being the seed of their dad i don't believe there's anybody sitting in here right now fellowshipping with us except that they pre-existed as their father you were here on the earth in the 1800s but you were walking around in the body of your father or grandfather or some other father i'm old church come on you might not even been in this america you were somewhere else all together but you were in somebody else's body at some other time you existed in their body as a human life but you are deposited into your mother as a seed and now you're here as a human being having fellowship outside of your father but you still have the traits of your father you still believe and act and talk and you look a certainly because of who you are in your father is that right that if that's true as a human it's the same as the son of almighty god amen you're not just a homo sapien you're a son of god your theos of god had come from god came from eternity manifested in a body and was a seed to begin with already you were already a seed it's a preacher why are you preaching like that because i want you to say i want you to realize something the prophet of god said the rain falls on the just and the unjust [Applause] the rain falls on the just and the unjust but you want to know why the rain comes brother bran said the rain come because there's a seed and if there's a super seed in the end time there's a super rain to fall on that seed and every time the seed word starts watering the word that's in your life amen everything on the planet gets watered by that same seed same water falls on the whole thing people say well i'll tell you what's a bunch of i'll tell you why there's a bunch of hypocrites down there this is happening that's happening and they just get up and shout around everything else hey man i can't believe all that worship and praise and all that stuff going on down there and all the problems they got they said i want you to know something god didn't send the reign for the hypocrite he sent the reign for the believer and people said well i tell you what people would shout and dance and everything else and still be lost amen you don't think that i don't know that you know how insulting it is for theologians to try to ring me up or text me and say brother wayne you're preaching experience but don't you know that anybody can have experience anybody can do this i said yes of course i read the bible of course i read what the prophet said but i'm not looking at the weeds brother i'm looking at the seed i'm not worried about the weeds that's in this earth i say god there's gonna come a reign of the holy ghost that touch the seed lie that's in the believer this is a harvest time the seed must come to ripening and maturity to do it we've got to have the rain of the baptism of the holy ghost so i say let it rain let it rain with fire let it reign with the glory of god let the spirit of god come i'm not looking at the weeds i'm looking at the seed bring the rain somebody's coming to adoption in this age somebody's going to rise up in this age [Applause] come on we're right now the sons of god we're not going to be we are right now so by the way i tell you we don't want those kind of things going on in our church do you know that laodicea has brought christ out do you all know that loud as he has brought christ out amen and the last place he has anywheres to be is in the bright churches i pray to god we don't put him out i pray that we have put out the move of the holy ghost and the power of god listen we still need the move and the holy ghost to come into the church with an anointing and change hearts and life we don't need a thousand more marriage counselors we need an experience an encounter with a living god with authority and power to fall into the church by the way what in the world is wrong with you i'll tell you what's wrong with me we need god we need god to come into our churches when we when he comes in we don't want to call him some bad name identify him with something wrong we are right now sons and daughters of god now this ain't off in the future somewhere but we're right now seated in heavenly places now there's a there's a teaching i'm not going to teach on it but you if you'd like to study it study heavenly places a little while we're right now seated in heavenly places as sons and daughters of god see it don't appear what we shall be in the end but we know we shall be like him we'll even have a body like his and we'll see him as he is do you know that jesus christ is in this building tonight i've got enough scripture to cover you up to prove my point there's an overwhelming amount of scriptural evidence that he's in this building wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i will be in the midst of them is that what he said yet a little while and the world shall see me no more but you shall see me for i be with you even until the end of the world the prophet of god said jesus christ is in this building tonight to perform miracles he's not here just to come as an entertainer he's not here just to be a sideshow to us having some songs and somebody preaching some word he's here to do miracles in this building tonight god is here to fix marriages god is here to fix homes god is here to give the holy ghost god is here to change lies god is here to call preachers god is here to show a supernatural act god is here tonight as a miracle-working god but the prophet of god said he's going to do it through his church [Applause] so if you block god out of being in the church you'll never see a miracle you're never going to see a move of god because what god is doing is in and through his people now the prophet of god will say watch if you lay your hands on the sick they shall recover in my name they shall cast out devils is that right the commission's given to the church what's the matter with the church today it doesn't know its position amen no watch the prophet say this if you knowed positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person in this bill in the next five minutes you must be somebody with god you're more than you think you are with god you might not know who you are but the prophet told us who you are if you knowed positionally what god made you there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes you see what he's saying he's saying god has given to you something more than you're obtaining something more than you can catch your ability to consume it is not as powerful as the potential that has been given to you what is it it's the supreme authority that jesus christ has given to every believer now i know that you may think there's a lot of things wrong with the church i know people that thinks there's all kinds of problems and curses and every kind of life but but coming from a prophet he said i want you to know what i believe is the greatest curse that's on the church today what kind of curse rests on the church today he said it's not knowing what they are you thought it was your heritage does your mom dad your thoughts where you was born you thought it was some situation that's happening in your life the greatest curse that's on the church is not knowing who you are come on now but god sent this message to break the curses the word will break the curse the message come to tell you who you are what is it it has to be a word of authority a supreme authority to come to break the curse of unknowing i think of the scripture in second corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature and all things are passed away and all things are new if any man be in christ now watch the word they spell m-a-n if any man be in christ isn't it beautiful that that a man can be in christ because after all aren't you really trying to be an angel isn't that really what you're in your thought pattern isn't that really what you're isn't that what your focus is on isn't that really what you think adoption is is angels walking around on the earth and nobody got no problems come on that's a devil that's lied to you and you've misunderstood the promise over your life and it's left you in a mess because you're stealing the human body and you're fighting wars that you don't understand because in your mind you're thinking if i get the holy ghost i'll have no more battles if i get the holy ghost there'll be no more troubles that's contrary to the word of god the prophet of god said when you get the holy ghost is when the battle started on you you wasn't war until you got the holy ghost but when you got the holy ghost that's when the devil started roaring against you and you're alive you know it's true but if any man be in christ how does an m-a-n get in christ he has to become a new creature what is that new creature it's a new creation now the only way to understand the creation is to go back to the old look i don't know if you realize this but there's a genesis in the middle of the bible it's called the book of matthew it is a new creation when jesus the original creator came to the earth and began to recreate come on church look what he done to adam in the beginning he blew the breath of life into him and made him a living soul he was a man but he wasn't alive he was afraid but he wasn't alive but god breathed the breath of life into him and the same god amen buried on the day of pentecost he breathed the breath of life into man and started a new creation come on your first birth made you a son of the first adam your second birth made you a son of the second adam we are sons of the second adam we're not born to the church we're born to the word of god and therefore being a new creation we are in christ jesus and we are heirs and ambassadors with almighty god [Applause] this new creation is a spiritual kingdom everybody's looking for the kingdom the new creation is the kingdom of god it's a spiritual kingdom lord when will you restore the kingdom when you're going to put the jewish kingdom back he said it's not even for you to know the time of the hour but when the holy ghost comes but when the holy ghost comes he shall give you power he'll set up a kingdom it's not the kingdom of the earth it's a heavenly kingdom in the earth amen our father which is in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven he's not talking about just on the planet he's talking about the will of god walking in human life human beings human beings with their failures but the will of god has took over their lives god has already pre-adorned pre-anointed pre-arranged the adoption of the church and there is nothing can stop it now somebody said brother wayne can't understand this new kingdom stuff you talk about jesus told nicodemus unless you're born again you can't see it unless you're born again you can't see the kingdom because it's a birth but it's not coming through your mother's womb the second time this verse is of the water of the blood and the spirit now jesus was the one that started this doctrine when he said lo the kingdom is neither here nor there but the kingdom of god is within you so there is some theologian somewhere that'll try to split hairs with you and make you think well you're trying to say there's no heaven and there's no this no we're not saying that at all we're saying exactly what the scripture said and if that was your focus you would never believe someone's teaching something differently come on but it's got to the place where every time you say something the scripture says somebody said well you're making room for this you're making room for that by preaching the message i'm making room for something said preacher what are you talking about i think we ought to get back to preaching the message and quit trying to explain why everybody else is wrong why don't we tell what's right for once i tell you what's right a man to get the holy ghost and the kingdom of god to move into the church of the living god let the word have its endurance in the church and its authority and its power no i'm not scared that i'm going to start some weird doctrine by preaching what christ preached when he said the kingdom of god is within you [Applause] i'm not going to say here there i'm going to say it's in the earth it's in the church god's kingdom is not of this earth but it's in our hearts it is a spiritual kingdom quoting there's a spiritual kingdom the kingdom of god comes but not without violence the kingdom of god is within you the holy spirit god's kingdom moving in man governing and controlling him that's the kingdom i know there's a lot of people building up churches right now i know i'm not interested i'm interested in building one church and that's the church of the living god and it's got one headquarters and that's almighty god come on if you're gonna have another headquarters make it wrong would you be an original once quit being an impersonator and say well we're not methodist and we're not baptist but you got a headshit somewhere besides the word you're just as catholic as the first ones were why don't you be an original catholic so preacher what are you talking about i'm talking about false teaching taking the place of the handship of jesus christ i believe we ought to make him head again we ought to make him king again make his word king among the church ruling in the heart of the believers [Applause] you say preacher what do you say the kingdom is i tell you what the prophet said it is he said it's god in his word made power now i'll tell you how to know if somebody's in the kingdom tell them what the word said and see if it has any power over them you can tell some people what the word is has no bearing at all over them you say well the the word teaches this is this and they'll say well that really don't matter to me not the kingdom of god there the kingdom of god is when the word that you're reading takes power in your life the prophet of god said the kingdom of god is his word made power of course that's first corinthians 4 20 the kingdom of god is god's word made power what is the kingdom of god it's within you and when the word comes in there and does the word begin it turns itself into power making it say just exactly what it said now see it turns itself its word into power so with being teach the words of god intellectually they are building intellectual kingdoms under their understandings now you said preacher why would you say that because the bible said in first thessalonians 1 our gospel came not unto you in word only but in power and the holy ghost and such assurance now paul said our gospel isn't that beautiful some time ago i was listening tate brother brown said some some preachers said brother adam we don't believe that he said who's we he said is that you and your group of guys he said because it ain't you and god we don't believe we don't believe but paul said our gospel who's our come on church who's our well the bible paul calls it the gospel of god so paul's gospel was the gospel that god had concerning jesus christ what gospel are you listening to he said well there's not another gospel paul said there wasn't he said there's not another gospel but you've been turned from the original gospel and the gospel of jesus christ is the gospel that he's alive look the gospel of paul was the gospel he said if an angel come teach you any other thing let him be accursed so paul's gospel was god's gospel that became william branham's gospel let me just say this william branham restored the word somebody said to me one time so brother wayne brother brown didn't preach what paul preached i said well according to the vision when he went to the other side he said i'll be judged and if paul is okay i'll be okay because i preached what paul preached come on church paul preached it he meant manifold wisdom of god paul preached that word paul preached a god that'll change your life paul preached and he preached to the gentiles who were idol packing idolatrous and he said god could come into you and make you a son of almighty god by the hearing of the word through the spirit of the resurrection of jesus christ now it's a gospel brother madam says it like this we are his gospel on the earth isn't that powerful then the gospel is not in word only but in power and human flesh we are his eyes we are his feet we are his legs god is here to do miracles and he's here to do it in the church you are his gospel that's a direct quote you're the gospel on the earth do you know that matthew 24 said the gospel the kingdom must be preached unto all the ends of the earth and then the end shall come matthew 24 14. do you know brother bam said under the sardis age he said missionaries like no other time went out and covered the entire earth think of it every nation under the heavens has already heard the word it completed that many many many years ago he said but not the gospel he said just the word the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life they heard the bible being taught in sardis age but the gospel wasn't preached until the last age because it took the spirit to make it live then the bible doesn't say go young the world and teach i said go the world and preach to preach is to manifest in other words god has empowered the church to manifest his news some people some people get up in the morning read the news the news is a newspaper they read words some people read the bible it's news to them but the prophet of god said this news does not come in word only this is news you can read in people who have been written by the hand of almighty god the written word living manifesting what is it amen there's a message in the last day that for the first time for a bright age out of a resurrection of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned again into its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that were done back there why because the gospel is being preached with kingdom authority in the church of the living god it's a messianic kingdom it's a kingdom where christ has dominion over the church now in mark the 11th chapter jesus now do you all know that there's a difference in god and little gods now jesus is when god became a little god and remained the big god brother braham said he was the only little god without sin he said if you say unto this mountain ye little gods he said there was only one little god without sin and that was when god entered humanity in little god form well i mean i thought it was pretty good and since he was a little god without sin he introduced this new race called the new creation the race of the second adam mark the 11th chapter gives us an outline of jesus showing that he was teaching his disciples of another level of authority over creation now remember remember since the time of adam there had been nobody exercise a spoken word over nature as such as for the trees for the mountains that that has not been been exercised like this but jesus walks by a fruit tree sees the thing doesn't have any fruit and curses and and within 24 hours his disciples walking with him walk back by that same tree and they see that tree and they say to him lord the tree it withers and jesus said unto them amen now now don't marvel yourself if you would have faith in god you could say unto this tree you could stay into this mountain if you can believe and not doubt in your heart now he said you you could be able to do this same thing now jesus began to teach this if you continue to read this in mark the 11th chapter and read down to the 28th verse where he institutes this the 23rd verse read right down to the 28th verse and then the pharisees heard of this teaching this man was doing and they were problems with this they come to jesus and they actually said unto him by what authority do you teach these things what what what school of pharisees have you come from to teach these humans that they can control nature by their words like our father can you didn't get this teaching approved through any of our channels we didn't we did not our bishops are our apostle didn't approve that teaching for the church you can't be reading those quotes to the church we don't approve them in our little circle but what authority do you teach these things and jesus and jesus just looks at the man and said unto him well i'll ask you a question he says and then i'll tell you by what authority if you'll answer me did john's baptism now was it from heaven or from man and they didn't like that question at all because if they said it was from heaven john was the one that introduced jesus as the very messiah of the lamb of god come on amen if it was for man then they all believed john was a great man and they would have been condemned by their own people so they were left at a standstill with not being able to be against it before it amen but jesus was making his point that the authority which i preached from is not from man it's from heaven and i tell you this the authority the jurisdiction that jesus christ had did not come from a group of men it didn't come from a pharisee he didn't come from the school it come from almighty god he was introduced as the messiah and i'll tell you i think it's time to shake this tale and tell them come see we have found the messiah you say found the messiah yes we found the messiah you say the messiah well are you if you're not a pagan we found him you said what do you mean what are you talking about by the way there is discipline one god the messiah is not a man it is the spirit of jesus christ that is returned in the fullness of the holy ghost [Applause] it's the truth people say well we want jesus to return and the holy ghost comes in the church and they kick it out what they meant is they wanted their own brand of jesus but they don't want what he promised he said yet a little while and the world will see me no more but i will be with you even in you to the end of the age i is a personal pronoun then i jesus is not an emotion the holy ghost is not an emotional workout don't you water this down by saying it's emotion or fanaticism it is the presence of jesus christ in his authority and his power that causes the stir in the church of the living god that's what the noise is about that's what the shout is about that's what it's about it's jesus christ [Applause] this voice which speaks to us come from heaven i don't have a i don't have the ability i wish i had better ability to preach it to you but you can say this with me always and only the word always and only comes to a prophet is that right amos the third chapter when jesus came to the earth where did he go he went to john didn't he he didn't go to the pharisees he went to john and was scripturally identified as the lamb of god always and only to a prophet that's why when the word returned in this age it went to a prophet it went to a prophet of god and he introduced the messiah to this generation not as a human but in a human in the church of the living god god is here in the tabernacle that he has chosen to manifest himself listen he used to be behind badger skin but tonight he's behind bride skin you are the tabernacle of the dynamics of almighty god where is god having church tonight where is god heaven church tonight not in this building you are the church of the living god you are the flesh and blood and bones of almighty god we are the tabernacle of the deity of almighty god god is not in heaven there's been a prophesied presence in this age i know you don't want to believe it because you got problems i know you don't want to believe it because they're seeing questions but the blood would answer the question if you would study the blood you would find there's been a perfect sacrifice [Applause] this voice from heaven is the mediator of another covenant isn't it it's a new creation but you know it's a new covenant too now people say all the time so brother wayne we're in the new testament not if the spirit of god's not in you you're in the old testament unless you're under the blood of jesus christ which is his spirit people say well we're we're under grace if if christ is not in you you're not under that dispensation the new covenant is a spirit covenant amen now i've got a ton of scriptures stacked on you romans 8 chapter said he that hath not the spirit is none of mine but if the spirit that raised jesus from the dead also dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body come on when is the resurrection then it's when you receive the holy ghost he resurrected you from a world of dead and unbelief and traditions of man into the kingdom of god where your eternal life is already there and you're just recognizing who you are [Applause] come on that's that's future home you never were a garfish to begin with he always was a trout now the scripture says that this is a voice that came from heaven of course that's what's talked about in hebrews when he said a voice that shakes the heavens and the earth that's what he's talking about in first thessalonians 4 the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and a voice it's a voice from heaven bringing divine authority this message was doing more than making you a member of a church it was bringing you a divine authority it's a divine authority that was being given to you what's jesus what's jesus teach in the book of matthew when the roman centurion came to him and had a servant remember and and he needed healing and he came to jesus now uh when when he when he spoke to jesus he wanted he wanted healing and jesus said i'll come down to your house now just in case somebody don't think i got scripture for this i do want to say this do you know that brother branham is in in arizona and he says this he said lord if you were here in your corporal body tonight he said there'd be no more people in this meeting that's here now because he knew his ministry was the same in every aspect except for preacher what are you talking about we're talking about the token the literal life the holy ghost in other words the only difference is the very corporal body it's exactly the same life now saying that this this centurion caught a revelation of who jesus was and he said lord you don't need to actually come to my house just send your word it's a preacher what are you saying i'm saying that man knew that the words that jesus spoke had the same power in the absence of his body as it did in the presence of his corporate body he was saying we don't have to have the corporate body to have authority we've got to have the word of authority we want to look come on church the gentiles said you got to come heal the people you got to come there's healing you've got to come with a healing campaign but you won't have to come to this church in a court perform you send your word and they knew that word would have its authority [Applause] said preacher what are you saying i'm saying the bible said he went home and found that his servant was healed in the self-same hour now to you that like the study brother brahm said that was 11th hour that was in the 11th hour when the spoken word brought healing to the sick and they received the same pay as the first hour worker received come on church we're in the hour of the spoken word and it's brought the 11th hour worker the same pay the first hour worker had we don't have to look back to the book of acts to try to figure out how to get a move of god god brought the book of acts and placed it in our lives and now the same spirit that wrote the book of acts is writing your life in the gospel of jesus christ hallelujah the book of acts is not an acts of the apostles it's the acts of god in the apostles and that same god is in the same room by the same authority that he was in the book of acts now this man said i am a man under authority so i understand authority because i have somebody who's over me i know what it means to be over someone and that when i speak it's not the words i'm speaking it's the position i hold and who's behind me that roman knew that that man jesus held a position somebody was behind him he knew when he spoke things moved he knew when he said something the heavens would shake the waters would calm the mountains would move the trees would shake because the creator was behind him listen i want to share something with you tonight that same authority is in the church of the living god but it ain't who you are it's the position you hold and who is behind you the prophet of god said all heaven stands behind this word brother josh the devil ain't scared of you but he's scared of what you represent we represent a kingdom of people who has been birthed under a new creation authority and the breath of life has been breathed over them and authority has been invested in them and they have been sent into the world now this this this this gentile was being taught authority isn't it amazing that you're gentiles and what you were taught in this age from a prophet was the lesson of authority that's what he taught you was authority he kept trying to tell you you don't have power you have authority the power you have you've been endued by the father it's his power but you're using it see god all power omnipotent right so the prophet of god said if there's a little bit of god in you all power's in you but when god stepped in you could have all power but not have authority to use it but in the age we're living in we have moved from servitude to adoption come on galatians said as long as you're a child you're different nothing from a servant but when the maturity comes theirs comes a separation between the servant and the son and the son comes into an inheritance and has a checkbook authority over his father's home a servant will never own the checkbook and as long as we were in a pentecostal age we were all endued with power but nobody had a checkbook but when the message of the hour come it separated the chicken from the eagle and it brought an understanding in this message that lifted you from the thoughts of servitude from just being a prodigal son and saying i'm not even worthy amen i want to live like a servant in your house but the father said you've never been a servant you've always been a son and he gave him a ring and he gave him a robe and he gave him shoes because he always was i wish i had the power to say it the way i believe it you always was a son and there's no devil and there's no trial and there's no problem and there's no darkness and there's no sin that'll ever change what god did in eternity is eternal and it's out of the reach of hell said preacher i don't know if you tell me the truth brother man said he took a picture of you and god has that picture in heaven it's a perfect picture [Applause] and the devil can't get that high the bible is teaching us that he brought us an authority in this age as a son we can use authority now the only reason the only reason that that man asked jesus to speak is because he understood who jesus was let me ask y'all a question why would brother branham ask you to speak to a storm unless he understood who you were [Applause] he would have never told you to speak if he didn't see that you had authority to do so but what authority now they didn't they just could not understand jesus giving this kind of commission to these kind of people how can you how can you how can you take this kind of people and put that kind of authority on them but what authority do you even do these things and say these things well i'll tell you what brother and this bible tells us that that on the in the upper room come 120 of them gathered up there and the holy ghost began to fall on them listen that may be that may be old news to people but let me tell you what i believe we could use another axe too do you all realize what was released in that upper room it was not a part of god it was god himself the bible said cloven tongues of fire rested on 120 people as a preacher what are you saying i'm saying that fire that the pillar fire that was with moses come in that room by promise and said he would endue those people under the promise of the father and that pillar of fire that god separated himself and stepped into 120 people the bible said they were all in one accord in one place and the holy ghost filled them all now you say preacher why you say i'm saying that because that upper room wasn't important till that happened nobody knew anything about the upper room and those 120 were not important until that event took place he said well this is just pawnee and this is just a little meeting let me tell you something could happen in this meeting tonight that they talk about as long as there is time that was 120 of them people got together in one mine and one accord and the pillar of fire came into the room and filled them with the holy ghost the preacher what are you saying i'm saying the sun came to the earth and gave his authority and power into that church in that upper room can can i can can i just can i preach a little something to you here do you all know we have an energy crisis in the world right now how many knows that energy crisis they would like to use nuclear fission which is this dividing of atoms i don't know what fission is hydrogen bomb if they would like to use fission in other words they'd like to separate atoms but it creates nuclear waste they want to use oil but y'all see the problem with oil creates waste in the in the in the atmospheres amen and it's a limited source but everybody agrees that the sun puts out enough power that they can take a cup of sea water and power the earth for a thousand years if they can recreate the sun on the earth so since the 1970s they've had projects that they want to take and create a miniature sun on the earth and radiate a fission power of fusion power upon the earth a fission separates and fusion brings together how many knows what effusion actually is effusion is when two and adam i'm a dumb hillbilly i just read science books something but you take a you take an atom right and it has three levels to it and the inside is a nucleus right well that you can put atoms together and they can they can make a positive negative charges it's like you take a you take a take a magnet you turn it over one way and it attracts that's like a fusion it's it's putting the atoms together turn them over the other way and they're two positives and they kind of repel but they in the sun there's enough power through the gravity and there's a heat that breaks down the outer shell of the of the of the atom and there's a there's a force under that heat that pushes them together and when them two nucleuses join together they call it effusion and when that comes together it radiates an energy now you say preacher why are you saying that because to recreate that in the late 1970s uh there was some people got together and decided that they would use light on the earth to do it one of the one of the ways to do it and they have actually a facility they call the ignition facility they built a building specifically for this point they took the most powerful laser they could find and they recreated that laser 192 times it is took them from the 1970s to build a building to build the lasers and to create a condition that is conducive to firing 192 lasers at the same time they're aiming them at a piece of a target that's about the size of an eraser and if they can get 192 lasers on that eraser at the same time they will recreate the sun on the earth he said preacher what are you saying i'm saying for 30 something years the smartest minds have used billions of dollars to bring a power into the earth that is built by a fusion power now now you know as well as i know that was under 120 of the upper room but there's more than 120 in this room and every one of you are a powerhouse by yourself every one of you can run out the devil by yourself but what if we could unify 192 of you here in this building tonight you know what they said the problem with fusion is is that they're both positive charges so so they want to re they will actually want to repel each other they actually want to repel the human natures repel you see they're too much alike and it kind of repels but there's enough heat and enough force that when they finally get together it releases an anointing that church of the living god it's a costly thing they're doing they're spending billions of dollars to do it because they know it will release an energy like nothing else will and i know that this pastor has spent a lot of money i know you've spent a lot of money to get here and it's been a great cause but if you could get your hearts together tonight and let a unity come in the house of god the newspapers will write about what takes place in these meetings because god is still god god is still the god of miracles he's still healing he's still delivering he's still bringing the power of god you can get 192 believers focused on one thing brother brother wendell you know get 190 but there's always that two you got to bump them back in line a little but they're still lasers it's worth the time it's worth the adjustment it's what it took them 30 years might take you more than 10 years might take you five years with one laser but just keep adjusting that laser because they are valuable every one of you are valuable by yourself you're a powerhouse but when you begin to get together and focus on the word of god every devil is defeated every power is broken hell has lost its power when the sons of god begin to unify now you know why the spirit of jealousy moves in among preachers now you know why that little envy analysis and personality conflicts happen because the devil would do everything he could do to keep men of god from finding a focus and preaching the power of god until the anointing would strike a building [Applause] i'm preaching to you i can feel i'm preaching to you that's why those little things start working in a church that's why those little issues and problems are working it's trying to keep unity out of the church of the living god but if it's precious it's going to cost you something it might cost you pride it might cost your opinion it might cost your feelings but i believe it's worth it [Applause] 120 of them the holy ghost fell for the first time and you know it went around the world 3 000 people were saved that very day but you know brother brown said the devil never even got out of bed come on brother said the devil never even got out of bed 3 000 people got the holy ghost and the devil didn't even get out of bed he said but when peter went walking down there with one of his buddies and there was a lame man next to the gate called beautiful and as that man laid there and begged for them to arms somebody get me home somebody help me and peter looked at the man and said listen sir silver and gold have a nun i cannot help you continue in this lifestyle you are but that what i have i give unto you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk oh that devil shook all of hell see he woke up all the devils he woke up everybody authority has returned to adam's race [Music] peter was born like everybody else peter had trouble like everybody else i don't know if you hear me i think it was brother biscuit said one time i bet peter wasn't aiming at the ear of that man either he was just a bad shot he was going to cut somebody's melon off brother amen he was a high temper amen man but when god got a hold of him [Applause] oh he could say your eyes up and walk in the name of jesus christ and the devil knew something has changed you know what those religious people did those religious people got involved and took them up there and beat them up and didn't even want them to they said but what authority did you let this man walk he said being filled with the holy ghost he said i have gave them that authority by the name of jesus christ this man could rise up and walk preacher why would you be on something like that tonight because that spirit ain't died yet that religious spirit is still moving around trying to make excuses of why when god really does something they try to dismiss it as somewhere else it was just this it really wasn't that bad it really was that's the devil he's always been there you know it's amazing brother branham he preached he preached a message talked a lot about a man named john ryan how many members john ryan blind guy john ryan was sitting in the meetings come up here blind man come up in the prayer line the man saw a vision he looked at the man said john he said thus saith the lord you're healed john left wouldn't sit down a little while he comes back in the prayer line he said brother branham i thought you said i was healed he said john you said you believe me he said but brother branham i can't see he said john what has that got to do with it [Applause] now he said i knew right then i had to give that boy something to say he said so i told him john you go testify your healing to everybody you see and john left the platform blind the only thing that had changed was his words but because he was a man under authority because he recognized the authority of a prophet the prophet could change his testimony he didn't change his side he didn't change the way he felt he changed his testimony and the authority of vision was put in the spoken word before the man could see anything he was already testifying i'm a healed man testified everywhere it got to be a big deal can you imagine blind man running around telling everybody he's healed two weeks later he's testifying this down in the barber's chair barbara's cutting his hair and making fun of him john heard you got your healing the other night oh yes sir yes sir i was down to branham meetings god seen a vision over me had the prophet speak to me and tell me i'm healed yeah but all of our expert says the cancer can't leave until there's an operation what do you mean testify you're healed we see all the cancer still right there and here you are saying these things oh he said well thank god i'm healed god healed me and when he began to testify his eyes come open well the news of that went everywhere found a found a young jewish guy over a synagogue up in chicago he looked brother ran him up and he's of course the jews on god you know so they went to brother branham they said by what authority did you give this man his eyes he said i did it by jesus christ he said by jesus christ he said yeah he said he was just a teacher he said oh he said you believe your prophets would tell something wrong he said albeit the prophets wouldn't tell nothing wrong he said then who was isaiah 9 6 talking about for his name shall be called emmanuel he will be god with us he said what what association will messiah have to god he said the jew said well he will be god he said then how did jesus miss it when isaiah said he shall be born of a virgin and the and the and the boy began to see it he said but brother branham if i'd preach that in my church i'd have to drink soda eat soda crackers drink brunch water brother man said listen young man i'd rather drink the brunch water and eat soda crackers and preach the truth then live in a great big mansion let me tell you i stand right where that prophet stood what authority do you do these things by the name of jesus christ the son of god now watch watch brother branham's over there in africa and he's having a great big african campaign now these are not these are not believers that he's with this isn't message churches he's having these beatings in this is muslims and zulus and and hindus and every kind of of religions and anti-gods and pagan gods and everything else and brother man's preaching right along and all of a sudden there's a cross-eyed boy starts coming up onto the platform and brother bam turns and looks at him he's about 10 feet from brother branham his eyes come open just his eyes straighten up and when his eyes uncrossed that was a man standing next to him took off a run and jumped up on the platform and grabbed brother branham by the coattail somebody said don't touch him right now he's under the anointing and and and they started moving him away and brother man whirled and looked at the guy and he says to him he says let the doctor alone what does he want and the man looked up at brother brown said how did you know i was a doctor he said let the doctor along the doctor said well brother branham i got one question what did you do to that boy but what authority did you uncross his eyes did did you did you do hypnotism over him he said well i'm surprised you being a doctor thinking hypnotism doesn't cross eyes he said if that works why ain't you practicing it [Applause] he said doctor what'd you do to him brother man said i didn't touch the boy he was 10 feet from me when his eyes uncrossed he said what did you do to him he said i didn't do anything to him he said well what happened to him he said sir he was ten feet from me when he was healing he said in that space he met jesus christ the son of god and he opened his eyes let me tell you jesus christ is not in a tomb in jerusalem jesus christ is not in a tomb in jeffersonville jesus christ is alive and he's in the church of the living god and the miracles that you read about in the bible is still happening in the church of the living god by what authority do you have these prayer lines by the authority of mark the 16th chapter by what authority do you believe god does these because god has commissioned this church with authority and with power [Applause] now now i know you're sitting here tonight people saying well brother wayne i i just don't i don't understand because y'all keep talking about all this authority all this power let me let me just say this is it's it's as plain as i know how the bible said in first peter 2 and 9 that he hath made us a royal priesthood in the book of kings it said it made us kings and priests unto god now you say preacher now by what authority let me ask you something what is a priest what is a priest to do what does a what what action in the old testament a priest had something right a priest had the access to the holies of holies and he could go in behind the veil and eat of the hidden manna he could offer atonement he would deliver the church through the gospel trumpet and he could sound the trumpet for jubilee he was a priest he could do them things but what he did was offer sacrifices now i know the church of the living god has got to the place where people's wanting to make a morgue out of it i get it amen because dead people enjoy quiet places it's the truth you put somebody pumping full of a bomb and fluid of some denominational theology and they love it quiet but you put life in somebody and put them in the presence of jesus christ and god always created noise wherever he was at somebody said well it's quiet when god comes around liar liar he said preacher what are you talking about amen the prophet of god said god created angels and they filled the heavens with noise for the last billion years there's not a quiet moment in the fold of god angel said holy holy holy holy holy holy holy now you say well maybe they're quiet now the bible said isaiah saw them isaiah the sixth chapter said isaiah saw one of them cherubs you know what the bible said it said that the voice of one of them shook the temple the other man said if one voice of one angel shook the temple what's it like in heaven when there's millions of them at the same time [Applause] i know that's a little shocked but it's the truth now now now you spritz what you told me i'm talking about i'm talking about i'm talking about priest because i'm talking about new creation authority by what authority do you heal the sick jesus christ by what authority is it that you worship and praise god the way you do who gave you the authority to do so the bible calls you a priest now a priest has a spiritual sacrifice is that right you say a sacrifice yes that's right sacrifice means you do it when you don't feel like it it wouldn't be a sacrifice otherwise brother man said you say well i'm too tired he said the devil's going to take you tell you that till he takes you to hell [Applause] that's what he said i'm too tired brother wayne i'm too tired amen now that's the time that you actually make the sacrifice amen when you're tired and you don't feel well and you're going through things and you're troubled and things are happening at home and problems are everywhere and satan's piling he's piling condemnation he's piling things on your life to quiet that's when the church exercises an authority as a priest and makes a sacrifice to god the sacrifice is the praise of our lips giving glory to god you say you said preacher what are you saying i'm saying this very clearly it clears i know how to say it in the old testament a priest was born into the levite order is that right he was born of the tribe of levi but do you all know that the first priests were supposed to be the firstborn of the house of israel amen and that's why when jesus come he was the firstborn but according to scripture he come through the tribe of judah instead of the tribe of levi so he was a priest after the order of melchizedek not after the order of aaron he said preacher what are you saying i'm saying this they never had a perfect sacrifice they never had a perfect priest they never had a perfect nothing until melchizedek became their priest and when melchizedek become the priest there's a perfect priest when melchizedek become the king there's a perfect king that's a perfect one when melchizedek does it you said preacher what are you saying i'm saying there's never been a perfect bride in the history of the universe there has never been a perfect bride but in the last days melchizedek prophesied to step into the order of the bride of jesus christ and now there is a perfect bride under the order of melchizedek we are a a priest under god it's a preacher why in the world what are you doing i'll tell you what i'm doing i'm telling you you've got a right to praise god when you don't feel like it you got a right to praise god when all your trials and all your problems and all your situations and everything's going wrong you still got a right you got a right to throw your hands up and worship and praise god not because you're worthy but because he's worthy there has never been a day in your life that jesus christ is not worthy of your praise there has never been a moment that jesus is not one i know you're no good i know you're a dirty rascal but jesus christ is worthy of all of our praise and all of our honor [Applause] by the way i don't know do you all know that david was a king right kings i'm talking to you kings david was a king but he acted as a priest right king priest david got the promise of melchizedek but watch david david knew how david knew how to do it let me let me just say this brother kenny amen there was nobody in the kingdom failed god more than david i guarantee you if you take a a a a comprehensive study of scripture there has never been a failure like david's david was the first perfect king anointed amen that god chose to become king and look what happened to him he committed adultery he killed one of his own soldiers he meant to cover up a baby that was being born from an adulterous affair now church he was a rascal you said preacher what point are you making here i'm saying that god saw david and all of his rascal ways and he said he's a man after my heart he said how could god say that because god was showing you what a king priest could do in the middle of all his struggles and all of his troubles what was it david different than others david was quick to repent when david got in trouble david was quick to repent listen you king priest you may get in trouble repent to god and let the thing go i know i'm getting long but i know i'm preaching right now you you got to let some things go in your life the bible says in psalms 103 it says it like this bless the lord oh my soul and all that's within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not his benefits who forgiveth all thy iniquity who healeth all thy diseases david was saying we're gonna bless god the one that can forgive the iniquity the one that can take away the problem we're gonna worship the god who is able to do all of these things and i'm going to do it by the authority of almighty god i'm going to do it under the blood of jesus christ david was teaching us how to worship when we didn't feel like it how to worship when our lives were less than better somebody said well i thought we had to live a life before we could worship listen sometimes amen if you if you get that mentality that satan will so condemn you and keep you under condemnation you're going to live your whole life with your head in the sand and never ever accept the promise of the blood of jesus christ because you're looking at your works instead of looking at the blood of jesus christ but if you would look at the blood and your faith would catch the blood deliverance would come over your soul i'm gonna i'm gonna borrow something from my good buddy ron spencer the only i love how he said it he said the only people that has a has the authority to have a quiet church is a dead church i i thought that was good so what do you mean psalms psalms 150 says it it says you should praise the lord you should praise him in his sanctuary you should praise him in the firmament of his power you should praise him for his mighty acts you should praise him according to the excellent grace you should praise him with the sound of the trumpet that's right you should praise him with a psalm tree in the heart you should praise him with a timbrel in the dance you should praise him with stringed instruments and organs maybe i misread that let me read that again you should praise him with the temporal and with a dance i want to ask somebody something can somebody help me who took the dance out of the church what devil took the dance out of the church of the living god my bible said we ought to praise him in the dance but that devil has took the dance out of the church of the living god i think it's time we bring the dance back in the church of god so preacher i don't feel like dancing it's because you ain't doing no drinking if you get to drinking some wine you'll feel like dancing a little bit you'll get stimulated on the revelation of almighty god and the dance can come back in the church of the living god i'm sorry i don't think our children are to learn to dance in the hockey talk i think if they want to learn to dance you ought to bring them to the house of god and turn loose and victory into the power of god and come back in the church i am i'm serious it's time to bring worship back to the house of god bring the dance back to the house of god by what authority do you do these things psalms 150 said i ought to praise the lord in my dance hallelujah i think it's time i think it's time to lose condemnation and let victory return to the house of said preacher you're going to you're going to cause a workup is it me or is it the scripture going to cause it how far have you watered down the scripture until it ain't caused the movement in the church how far have you got to water down this message before it don't have power in it no more but if you preach the message with power it'll be received with power and this church of the living god is ready for the power of the holy ghost let me just say it real straight i am sick and tired of dead religion i am sick of traditions and kingdom builders and people that are so scared of this message until they cannot let the holy ghost loose in the church anymore i think it's time to bring the dance back i think it's time to bring the word back it's time to bring life back in the church come on church turn loose and let the holy ghost feel the church again well brother wayne you just don't understand no i'm afraid i do understand i'm afraid that there's a lot of people in man-made cages and they'd have some liberty but for the authority of what some man has said has captured them listen i read all the time i read the prophet all the time you can't take two quotes and make ten thousand lie so preacher what are you saying listen you don't remember that house of hell they've been preaching about it how's the hell give way in the name of jesus do y'all know what them people were doing in that house y'all know why they were in that cave with those bars y'all know why the bible said the woman was taught or the vision said the woman was talking to brother branham he said brother random they're good people they've just misunderstood you and people have misunderstood those quotes and they have put the church in a bondage where they can't worship they can't rejoice they can't preach they can't shout they can't enjoy god but i say house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ let the light come back let the dance come back let the holy ghost come back in the church of the living god somebody turn on the light something is bringing us out of darkness into the power of god it's a world of darkness come on church they put the lights out everywhere you well you can't preach no more you can't shout no more i tell you what two or three times brother brown said i'm gonna ride that trail again okay okay bring that to me next time and let's talk a little while let me ask you by what authority did he say it was that of man or god come on now was it listen to me he said i am the voice of god to you and god was prophesying through his prophet and he wasn't talking about brother branham he was talking about the spirit of jesus christ will ride again in the church of the living god and here it is tonight we're not riding the pale horse we're not riding the red horse we're riding the white horse and the vindicated word of almighty god get on your horse and ride let's ride down this devil let's ride down this this is when kings go to war this is the time for kings to pick up their sword and fight these devils the preacher what are you talking about i'm talking about this [Applause] men have taken this message and they've made this about william branham now i'll tell you what it's one of the most it's one of the most disgusting things that man ever do it to to take the power of god out of william branham's message making it about the man [Applause] i said preacher what are you talking about i want you to listen to a tape called bruce serpent sometime it was preached in 1960 when william branham said they're trying to make me jesus christ and i stood still for them to call me a prophet he said but if they start calling me the lord they have made me an antichrist and i'm leaving the field don't worship me worship god now if you'll take that little portion of tape and you'll play that portion of tape while reading revelations the 19th chapter and you start reading where it said i bowed to that angel and he made me get up you'll see that revelations 19 was being preached in 1960 in the bruce serpent but a bunch of oh god a bunch of backslid man worshipers got a hold of this message and they don't want to turn loose an anointed gifted man who discerns lives and hearts by the holy ghost preaching and preaches against things that are wrong and cuts against spirits so they move the ministry out and they said well we'll just play a tape and then they say look amen y'all just hold on brother branham's coming back and he's got this tent and he's gonna set this tent up and we're gonna have a real party then amen listen to me and the whole time the children are going into the world the revival is being lost and and they're promising someday sunday sunday [Applause] preacher why are you on this i'll tell you why i'm on this as david cried out and he said from the book of psalms my god my god why is that forsaken me thy bones they stare at me come on they looked for david to do that they looked for david to be crucified he wasn't crucified but when but it was jesus christ prophesying through a voice and when he was and when it was fulfilled it was a greater than david that did it [Applause] god fulfilled his own word in the flesh of jesus christ come on church when he prophesied i'll do it again he was prophesying a place in the bride of jesus christ i went too far to turn back now can i just say it to you like this in the days of elijah in the days of elijah is that a good that a good type god told elijah you knew through things he said i want you to go anoint elisha i want you to anoint jehu and i want you to know it jezreel or what was his name he was the king jehu king over yeah it was jehu and and and elisha and it was the king over syria jezreel i believe his name was he wanted he wanted elijah to do all three of those things do you all know elijah only done one of those things he anointed elisha and elisha anointed uh isil over syria he anointed him but even elisha didn't anoint jehu he sent somebody to do it because the commission wasn't about the man it was about the voice of authority come on church elisha had the authority to anoint a king but even he could say to a servant anoint that man king come on church god has given authority to this bride so what are we standing here today i'll tell you where we're standing we're standing here with kings we're standing here with priests we're standing here with people that has a right tonight to worship god to praise god to feel the holy ghost coming to church again listen we are not here tonight and sunday we're going to be someday when brother byron comes back now you all know how bright i preach how hard i preached this message but they made a disgrace out of it teaching that like brother branham was preaching about himself instead of jesus christ the son of god william branham's focus was jesus christ our focus is jesus christ he said he introduced him to us now preacher what are you really getting at i'll tell you in closing right here i'm gonna tell you what i'm talking about i'm talking about kings who are reigning right now in this life and they're reigning over sin and they're reigning over the flesh and the reigning over the devil [Applause] said preacher what are you talking about i'm coming over your flesh you're reigning over your flesh everybody in here you've always probably heard it or been told it when you start amen you feel a little dance coming on you feel a little shout coming home somebody say you're going to get in the flesh well let me ask you where else are we going to worship him well you're just going to get in the flesh by the way i'm going to worship god in the flesh it's in this flesh where i'm going to worship god in this age i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to put this flesh under the order of the word of god and i'm going to let a praise come out of this human body that glorifies almighty god i'm out of time i'll tell you this i'll tell you this something right here tonight folks there there is an authority that's been given to this bride to worship god to preach the gospel to shout to rejoice to dance to have prayer lines and it comes by the authority of jesus christ and it comes by the authority of jesus christ i got i got guys i know message preachers they say things they say well i don't believe in that return ministry you never heard them preach against it though and i'll tell you why they ain't preaching against it because they're not sure about it but if you'd ever get down and study what a prophet's teaching he's teaching there's a bride ministry and there's a greater one than brother bran i'm going to fulfill this [Music] it's the lord jesus christ himself can you imagine the lord jesus made a promise that in my name shall you cast out devils in my name shall you heal the sick friends that's why we hold these meetings that's why we shout and rejoice and praise god by the way i'm afraid y'all's getting out of order brother brown said i've seen them scream shout jump dance stand to the top of their feet and scream with all their heart he said i'd never seen them out of order amen because they're under authority amen we're under authority kind of musicians come tonight it's a new creation authority do you remember it the chief authority chief authority amen so brother and we saw you sitting at the head of the table and you spoke differently [Music] remember that quote remember it you spoke differently before you were kind of in a question this time you spoke as one heaven authority if you can recognize the authority of a prophet and you can get under him you can exercise the authority that he gave you and that's exactly what we need tonight said preacher i'm not able to i'm not really able to believe these things get under a prophet and it'll change [Music] right now i believe i believe there's things happening in this room i believe william branham the prophet of almighty god seventh angel [Music] the ministry of the son of man to introduce jesus christ to this age i believe he carried the authority of almighty god and what he said we can believe if he said that every one of you as a believer has a right and authority over the devil i believe that somebody said well brother wayne my i'm i'm called to preach but i don't have the i don't have the gift of healing like some of your brothers exercise and see the the authority the miracles and things happen in your lives brother brown said brother he said you may not have the gift of healing but if you're called to preach the gospel you're called to pray for the sick amen if god called you to preach the gospel he called you to pray for the sick not not an angel come down and commissioned me but a prophet did and that's enough for me he lined up a thousand people he said brother wayne you shouldn't be preaching but the prophet said that's enough so tonight we're here by the authority under a new creation authority and you have a right tonight you have a right to healing these men of god have been called of god been called of god to lay their hands on you and uh brother brother wendell's going to have a prayer line tonight we would like to join and have a prayer here with you all and you forgive me if i've been a little long i just got my heart full of something tonight i'm tired of the devil folks amen
