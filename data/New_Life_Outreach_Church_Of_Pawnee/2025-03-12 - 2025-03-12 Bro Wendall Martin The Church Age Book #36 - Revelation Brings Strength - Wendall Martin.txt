know Devils know when his presence is here but to be able to surrender ourselves to his presence to me that is such an incredible blessing that we can surrender ourselves to the presence of the Lord as his bride and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word be it unto me and so we're sure thankful to feel the presence of the Lord and to know him amen good evening good to see everyone out in the house of the Lord tonight and um amen good to see uh Brother David and Sister Laura here God bless yall what a surprise amen and uh uh good good to see see them here today and uh I I see Patrick

for all of God's children to amen come come back to God come to God let's go home amen let's it's time it's time for Rapture and um and so we're we're sure thankful for that let's look here in the Book of Revelations the third chapter and um we are going to read here at the um let's see um I believe the last one that we we read was the eighth verse and so we're going to read the uh ninth verse let's just start at the eth verse again I Know Thy works and behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly be hold that fast which thou Hast and no man that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your amazing love thank you Lord for your presence that we feel here tonight we thank you Lord that you have called us with an everlasting call and that you've loved us with an everlasting love and I ask God that your Holy Spirit would be among us and that you would be upon every heart that you would anoint every word to our hearts Lord your big you you can touch the oldest to the very youngest and you can minister to our needs and Lord we're a needy people and we look to you we love you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I'd like to say tonight that it has um uh we we've been away for uh a few minutes and uh uh got got a little bit of a of a rest and and um sometimes we get a little bit weary in our spirits and and uh so uh I appreciate my wife uh putting up with me and uh appreciate uh all of all of you all and your patience uh with us been gone and we you know didn't we have wonderful Ministry brother Andrew and brother Joshua I tell you man the the messages were were such a blessing to me and and so we appreciate them and and and uh we say God bless them we're going to read uh start reading tonight at at page 306 and um so uh we'll see how how far we get uh this evening I it's going to be a good reading and um now we've already read page 306 but I'm just going to go back a page uh before we start with with the fresh page and um how many enjoyed the church age book amen now we're in the Philadelphian Age and and chances are we could be uh get totally through with it tonight um so we we'll see how that we'll see how that goes but uh it's it's it's quite an incredible thing to see the spirit of the Lord and what the spirit of the Lord is is is doing and and how that the spirit of Prophecy has been so if if someone says that amen that you know that this is all the figment of man's imagination um they they just need to go back and and and and read just the prophecies in the first three chapters of the Book of Revelations and they will see how incredibly uh on the money the holy spirit is the holy spirit has already been in our tomorrows he's been in our yesterday and and the one who has called us yesterday and said that I love you with an everlasting love don't you know that your name is already already inde debly on that book of life and can never be taken out it can never be taken out that is God's promise to us how can you be sure of that because the one who knows our yesterdays knows our tomorrows the one who call called us with an everlasting call and love and so we ought to be thankful for that now let's look here in in uh the on 306 here in this first paragraph I have set before thee an open door I want to look at these words again this time though I'm not going to disassociate them from missions I'm going to bring you a thought which carries deep into the last age talking about our age as I have already stated this age melts into the last age it was in this age Jesus says I come quickly verse 11 and and of the last age he was going to finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because of a short work uh uh because a short work will the Lord make upon the Earth Romans 9 and 28 notice how this verse of Revelations 3:8 goes Open Door little strength word name that open door has to do with all three that now what does the door signify in John 7 and10 or or 10:7 it says then Seth Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep that is right I am is the door of the sheep now this is not just a Quin expression this is actually so notice in John 10 when Jesus is giving this Parable he calls himself the shepherd then he calls himself the door and that is what the shepherd is to the Sheep he is actually their door when I was in the East I saw that at night time the shepherd would gather all his sheep together and he would put them into the fold he would count them when he was sure that they were all in he would lay down in the open door of the fold and literally become the door to the fold aren't you glad for that no one could get in or out except by him he was the door the next day as I went riding with a friend in a jeep I noticed that a Shepherd began to lead his flock into the city right away all the traffic came to a stop so that the Sheep could go through now the cities over in the East aren't like they are here we keep all our merchandise inside but there it is like a big farmers market with all the produce on the pavement for pastor Pastor B to see and buy and I thought oh my here is where goodies she oh if I could have only known their language I would have stopped traffic myself and preach them a sermon on what I had just seen when you are a sheep that belongs to the Good Shepherd you follow right along in each of his steps just as those sheep did you won't be tempted to turn aside for some big flower of a church or listen to the voice of some DD or PhD or lld D but you stay with the shepherd the Bible says that the Sheep know his voice and they follow him but a stranger's voice will will only cause them to flee and run to their true Shepherd praise God but that was not all I saw and learned over there one day I got to thinking about having seen men in the fields hurting different kinds of animals one fellow was tending to some pigs another some goats and some camels another some mules Etc so I asked a friend who lived there what they called those men oh he replied they are Shepherds and I couldn't take that I said OU don't mean to say they are all Shepherds Shepherds only heard sheep don't they no he said a Shepherd is a herder or Grazer so anyone who grazes animals is a Shepherd well that did surprise me but I noticed a difference between the herders and the ones that took care of the sheep come night time all the others but The Shepherd of the sheep left his animals in the field and went on home the the shepherd took his sheep with him and put them in the fold and then laid down and become the door of the sheep oh praise God Our Shepherd never leaves us or forsakes US when Night comes I want to be in his fold I want to be in his care can I hear a great big amen even in this dark leot AIA we want the great Shepherd to be all around us amen you say how can to be all around us he knows your tomorrows he knows what's on the out he is all knowing he knows everything about you amen aren't you glad for that amen now then we can see that Jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him and that Revelation is opening up to bring strength to illuminate the word and glorify his name so the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of these seven Church ages the revelation of the Seven Seals the unveiling that has been taking place in this generation is to give us strength for Rapture so we're not going to barely make the Rapture but we are going to enter into that glorious Rapture because of divine revelation that has given us strength aren't you glad for that amen now he says it was in the midst of the last two ages that the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us yes we knew he was God how else could he be our savior but to know that he was only God or God Alone that he was the Alpha and the Omega that this Jesus was both Lord and Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Son and Holy Ghost all one person that had been lost since the first uh Church ages but now we are seeing it again the revelation of who he was had come back indeed godhead is not a three-person god with one personality for it takes a personality to make a person if there is one personality there is but one person but they who believe in three persons have the three have a three good godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment but the revelation of the godhead is back now the true church can build in strength again after after all this time she finally knows who her Lord is once again we are baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus just as they did at Pentecost let me tell you of a god-given dream I had about Triune baptism this is not a vision but a dream you know I'm not or you know I'm sure that one of the blessings of the church Ages was to receive Dreams by the Holy Ghost just the same as one can receive Visions it was about 3:00 a.m. on Saturday morning I had gotten up to get Joseph a drink of water and when I lay down I fell asleep instantly and dreamed this dream I saw a man that I supposed was my father he was a great big Burly man I also s a woman saw a woman that was supposed to be my mother but she didn't look like her even as the man did not look like my father this man was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it you know when you take a log and set it on in and hit it with an axe and it makes a three cornered wedge like piece of firewood it was like that he would take his club and hit her with it and knock her down and she would lie there crying and he would walk around with his chest stuck out and on his face was such a proud boastful look that he appeared to take great pride and satisfaction and beating up a poor little woman every time she tried to get up he would hit her I did not like what he was doing but as I considered stopping him I thought I can't tackle that man he is too big then he's supposed to be my father but down inside I knew he wasn't my father I knew that no man had the right uh and I knew that no man had the right to treat a woman like that I went over and grabbed him by the collar and turned him around and said you have no right to strike her and when I said that my muscles grew and I looked like a giant and the man uh saw them and then he got he was scared of me and I said you strike her again and you'll deal with me he hesitated to strike her again and then the dream left me I woke up immediately after the dream dream I thought how strange that was I wondered why I had dreamed about that woman when suddenly there he came the presence of God became known to me and the interpretation of the Dream came from him now you people know that not only have I interpreted your dreams exactly but I have many many times told you what you dreamed so that you never had to tell me the woman represents the Church of the world today I was born right into this m mess the mess that she is in she was supposed to be a kind of mother she is the mother of harot her husband is the denominations that rule her the three cornered block is a false Triune baptism into a trinity and every time she started to rise up and that means the congregation begins to accept the truth he would drive her right back down again with that false Doctrine he was so big that I was afraid of him at first but when I come against him I found I had great and powerful muscles they were Faith muscles the outcome of the dream was that since God is with me and can give me such strength then he can let me stand up for her against the denominational power of the world and make him quit striking her now I'm not trying to build a Doctrine Upon A Dream nor am I trying to vindicate any Doctrine I stand for by a dream Oneness of the the godhead is all the way from Genesis 1:1 to Revelations 22:21 but the people have been blinded by an unscriptural dogma of a trinity and the Dogma is so universally accepted that to try to see a one good person is all but impossible if people can't see the truth of the godhead but fight it they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the revelation of Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for The Seven Ages did you get that now I'm sure you understand now I want you to really understand as what brother brand if you can't see that God is unfolding him his mystery that God is is trying to reveal himself if you can't see that it was that great invisible God that created the body of Jesus so that that one invisible God could live on the inside of him in order to die and pay Redemption so that that great Eternal invisible God could come and live on the inside of you then you have missed what God has been doing see the trinitarians want to put it that there is the three Gods God the Father amen is is is is is helpless without God the son and God the Sun is going out and dying for the whole world and and and then it's the holy spirit's job to turn the whole world back to the god the son who gave his life and so God the son is crying and weeping and hoping that the world will all come to him amen that's not the way the Bible teaches it God knew you you are his sons and daughters and God had to die for you in order to redeem him hallelu Brothers we're going to you're going to live in this in this Frailty you young people are going to live in this frail bodies there's going to be plenty of times that you're going to have to repent matter of the fact you're going to have to repent on a daily basis because we are Fallen human beings but I'm so glad PR that there is ever more a blood sacrifice for everyone of God's sons and daughters that blood sacrifice forever more paid the price for you oh you say but brother W you just don't know you just don't know how bad I am I want to tell you the price that Jesus Paid for you was a price that'll go down to the very lowest it'll go to the very deepest there is no sin to Great there is nothing that you could ever do to ever uh H uh for a Son of God to ever walk away from the love of God God's love will hunt you down and bring you back Hallelujah he'll do it he'll do it amen how many knows that that the holy spir how many feels the Holy Spirit when you've done wrong and the Holy Spirit is right there just gnawing at your conscience gnawing telling you hey hey hey hey amen and and what is he doing he is saying I've redeemed you you're not one of those that's going to be uh uh uh you know f for the fire but I've called you with an eternal call amen well glory to God I love him here tonight amen now now so so I'm going to read that last of that of that to you if the people can't see the truth of the godhead but fight it they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the Revelation is Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the midst of the church for The Seven Ages and then he asked did you get it amen now now now to the that next paragraph he says Thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name now we have already mentioned that the strength was returning now how was the strength returning with the greater the Revelation the greater the strength the greater the Revelation that was coming amen strength was returning to the believer amen now he says now as we've already mentioned how the strength was returning it was the power of inquis had waned and the people had left their homelands and demanded free freedom of worship the Yoke of the hierarchy was was being broken the governments were finding it wise not to Champion one segment against another in fact well-meaning but poorly LED people were willing to wage war to defend to defend their religious rights perhaps the greatest show of strength of religion in this age was the fact that though France fell in Revolution the great wesland Revival kept the revolution away from Great Britain and saved her to be an instrument in the hand of God for many glorious years the preaching of the word was never greater as Satan raised up his hordes of free thinkers as The Originators of Communism rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy Wares God raised up Mighty Warriors of faith and the great works of the Christian literature and teaching and preaching come from this area era never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be the Spurgeon Parkers clarans Edwards bunions muers brainards Barnes Bishops all come from this era they preached and taught and wrote the word they glorified his name the Judgment of the false Jew Revelations 3:9 behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews but are not but do lie behold I will make them come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee now we can not a immediately that this problem of the false Jew or false Believers were already in existence in the second age these who falsely called themselves Jews appeared right after the first outpouring of the first age now they appear again in the second age after the reservation Reformation this is hardly an accident indeed it is not an accident it is the principle of Satan the principle is to organize and claim originality and therefore be entitled to special rights and privileges let me show you back there in the saman age these people lied and said they were actually Jews or Believers when they definitely were not they were of the synagogue of Satan they were Satan's organized crowd for it was in an age in that age that we saw the start of men and the ministry taking an unwarranted leadership over the ministering Brethren Bishop said up in districts over Elders the next thing we saw was in the third Church in the third age there was definitely a place called Satan's seat that age gave us church and state marriage with the power of the state behind her the church would literally physically uh was literally physically Invincible but God broke the hold in the in spite of the power of the state and the Reformation brought great light but what happened the Lutheran organized and join with the state and again we see the synagogue of Satan manifested in the sixth age now of course this this synagogue group wouldn't say they're of Satan no sir they say they are of God but they lie for he that is a true Jew that is uh that is what they claim to be is one who is a Jew inwardly in the spirit so then if they are false Jews it means that they are as Jude 19 says having not that Spirit the spirit children of God are born of the spirit these have not the spirit therefore they are not children of God no matter how fervently they protest and to what links they try to go to prove that they are they are dead they are children of organization the true fruits are missing they are built upon their own creeds dogmas doct and the truth is not in them for they have taken their own counsel above the word of God let me show you what I mean uh what I have been trying to teach all along about the two Vines which come from the two different spirits take the example of Jesus and Judas this time Jesus was the son of God Judas was the son of predition God entered into Jesus Satan entered into Judas Jesus had a full Holy Ghost Ministry for how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him acts 10:38 it says for he Judas was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry acts 1:7 Matthew 10:1 when he had called un him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease that spirit that was in Judas went right along with the ministry of Jesus then they both come to the cross Jesus was hanged upon the cross and gladly giving his life for Sinners and commending his Spirit to God his Spirit went to God and then was poured out into the church at Pentecost but Judas hung himself and his Spirit went back to Satan but after Pentecost that same spirit that was in Judas came back to the false Vine that grows right along with the True Vine but notice Judah Spirit never got to Pentecost it was never it never went up to receive the Holy Spirit it could not but what did that Judah Spirit go for it went for the bag of gold how it loved money and it still loves money if it goes about in the name of Jesus doing Mighty things and holding great meetings it still makes more of the money and buildings and education and everything with a material concept just watch that spirit that is upon them and don't be fooled Judas went about as as one of the 12 and he did Miracles too he did not have the spirit of God as his own he did have a Ministry uh as his own he did have a Ministry he got he never got to Pentecost as he was not the true seed he was not a true child of God no sir it is it is that way right now in the synagogue of Satan don't be fooled you won't be full if you're the very elect Jesus said you wouldn't be full can you say hallelujah yes these folks say they are Christians but they aren't I will make them come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee First Corinthians 6 and2 do ye not know that the Saints shall judge the world not only will there be 12 Apostles on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel but the Saints also will judge the world this is when the these who claim to belong to God and claim that God loves them will find out exactly who is the child of God and who is loved of the son yes that day is coming when it will be made manifest these who are now ruling the world in a measure and who during the last age will build an image to the Beast whereby they will actually rule the world one will one day be humbled when Jesus comes with his Saints to judge the world in righteousness this is exactly what we saw in in Matthew 25 when all the ones who miss the first resurrection will stand before the judge and his bride the eulogy and the promise Revelations 3:10 because thou Hast kept my word and my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation when which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth what does he mean by the word of my patience Hebrews 6:13 and 15 says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely uh blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word which is uh which is given to us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham and I think this is so true he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word was uh finally was fulfilled and I think I think patience is one of the greatest is one of the greatest attributes of God's spirit on the inside of you because it believes the word of God regardless doctors are telling you one thing you're looking at your family problems you're looking at this you're looking at that and you and yet when you're we and even looking at yourself and you're saying God gave the promise and we are going to believe Amen Brother David amen we believe that we stand upon that promise amen no matter the health issues or anything else stand upon the word god canot lie God cannot lie amen so um let's see here so uh I I lost my place here hallelujah okay so to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who was invisible he was patient then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience why if if he why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life let me show you this truth even more fully set forth Hebrews 11:1 17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up his son offer up Isaac and he that had the promises the word of God offered up his only begotten son there it is Abraham was tried after he received The Word of Promise most think that as soon as you pray in jesus' name over the good promise of God then there could not be a trial but here he says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph uh 10519 until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only in patience do we possess life may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of this sixth age the Learned patience we read the history of the lives of these great Christians what what a contrast we see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome in over impatience and haste he goes on to say to them because you have taken my word and lived it and thereby become patient I will keep you from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now here again we see the overlapping of the two ages for This Promise has to do with the end of the Gentile period which culminates in the Great Tribulation I I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said that but it said I will keep thee from from the hour of Temptation this temptation is like is exactly like the Temptation Of Eden it will be a very inviting proposition held in direct opposition to God's commanded word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and lifegiving as to fool the world only the very elect will not be fooled the Temptation will come as follows The ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one become so strongly political that she Bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to the principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect Domin uh domination of this Council little groups will lose Charters and privileges Etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local Ministerial Association approves in many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become a chaplain in the arms Services Hospital Etc it is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to The trinitarian ecumenical groups as this pressure increases and it will it will be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and many will be tempted to go along for they will feel it better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization than not to serve God at all publicly but they error to believe the devil's lie is to believe is to serve Satan even though you may want to call him Jehovah but the elect will not be deceived furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image Ed to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture you know we're getting we're getting close friends we're getting close and I and I know that that things are I I know that that uh most of us tend toward the Republican side of things you know conservative side of things but but I could see I could see how that even man an ambitious president could could very well make life pretty miserable for for for those of you who are not part of the mainstream christiandom that's right amen and willing to make a deal with with whoever amen and so uh I I I just I just believe that we're getting close I I just don't you just feel it in your heart don't you just feel that something pulsating in your soul lord I want to be ready now it says and this little delightful Winsome movement that started out in fellowship at Ephesus will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world the church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant and coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living this will be accomplished simply for the harlot's daughters are all but gone back to her in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds and all the paper at the right time the Harlot will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the system Falls the Jews will be trapped and come into the alliance and the Harlot church will take over the whole world the promise to his own Revelations 3 11-12 I come quickly hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy crown him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name we don't need to comment on the thought that he is coming quickly we know that he is because we are in the end of the last days aren't we but he goes on to say hold fast what you have that no man take your crown it is in the midst of the of the time of the great trouble that Jesus comes and with his coming there is a resurrection many are to come forth Out of the Dust and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return these will be given crowns why because they're sons of God they are Kings with him they are reigning with him that is what Crown signify reigning and ruling with the great king himself that is the promise to all those who suffer with him on the Earth all those who endured patiently knowing that God the just judge would reward them they who gave up all for him and committed all to him will sat down in his throne and share in his glorious Kingdom oh we have a word for us at this time it is to hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God use every weapon he has given us use every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and Lord of lords now he has not only given crowns but he says that these in the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us now now he is going to make the Overcomer a pillar in that Temple but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the super structure praise God that puts the Overcomer right in with the apostles and Prophets for it says Ephesians 2:1 19-22 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth into a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit oh that does that make you want to shout yes that verse 22 says we are building with them everything went through the door Jesus and is a part of that body or Temple now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar he makes him a part of that Foundation group what is he what is he doing he's given him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and Prophets had Matthew 16 And1 17 there he is in that word there he stands no one can get get him out Ponder that word overcometh John asked the question who who is he that overcometh and the answer comes right right back he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ he doesn't say that the Overcomer is one that believes in a Jesus and in a Christ but believes that that Jesus is the Christ one person not two he is the one who is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God is talking about the bride here do you want to see another picture of her it is over in Revelations 74- 17 and I heard the number of them that were sealed uh uh 140 and 4,000 of their tribes of the of the children of Israel of the tribe of Judah was were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Ruben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Aster was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of nedam was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Manasses were sealed 12,000 of the tribe tribe of Simeon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Levi were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of issachar were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of zebulun were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 of The Tribe of Benjamin was sealed 12,000 after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all the nations and Kindred and people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms s in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the Angels stood around about the throne and the elders and four Beast fell down or fell Before the Throne on their faces and worshiped God saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes whence came they and I said unto him sir thou knowest not he said these are they which come out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb therefore they are Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple and he that sth on the throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall sunlight on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them into the Le living Fountain of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes Jesus has come he has sealed the 144,000 he took 12,000 out of each tribe but there was another group that doesn't belong in that 144,000 who are seen in verses 9-8 who are they they are in the bride taken from among the Gentiles they are Before the Throne day and night they serve him in the temple they are the special care of the Lord they are his bride the bride goes wherever the Broom the bridegroom is she will never be left by him she will never leave his side she will share the throne with him she shall be crowned with his glory and honor and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God what is the name of God well he was God With Us or Emmanuel but that was not given that was not his given name Thou shalt call his name Jesus Jesus says I come in my father's name you receive me not therefore the name of God is Jesus for that is the name he came in he is Lord Jesus Christ what name does it want woman take when she marries the man she takes his name it will be his name that is given unto the bride when he takes her to himself well Glory Revelations 21 1-4 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I saw John I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a a bride adorned for her husband I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men he will dwell with them they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away how wonderful all all of God's wonderful promises fulfilled it will all be over the change will come what will have been completed the lamb and his bride forever settled in all of the Perfections of God describe it who is able to do that no one think about it dream about it it read read what the word says about it you yes we can do all of that yet we can only know in an INF part of it until it becomes rality in the first resurrection I will write my new name upon him my new name when all becomes new then he will take upon him a new name and that name will be the name of the Bride also what that name is none dare conjecture I would it it would have to be a revelation of the spirits so given so conclusively that none would dare deny it but no doubt he will leave that Revelation to the day when he desires to give that name forth suffice it to know that it will be more wonderful than we could ever imagine the final admonition to the age Revelations 3:13 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches every age ends with the same warning it is consistent the consistent plea that the churches listen to the voice of the Lord in that age The Plea is even more insistent that uh than in the former ages for in this age the coming of the Lord truly draweth nigh the question would perhaps arise is there another age Beyond this one why the urgency or if there's is another age Beyond this one why the urgency the answer lies herein the last age will be a short one a quick word of consummation and not only is this so but one must also always remember that in the eyes of God time is very fleeting yay a thousand years are but a day and if he comes within a few hours as he views time then he surely must warn us with all urgency and his voice must continually sound in our hearts to be ready against that coming oh there are many voices in the world so many problems and needs crying for attention but there will never be a voice so important and so worth attending as the voice of the spirit so he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit say unto the churches Oh Glory to God aren't you glad that the Revelation has has come to give you strength it's been the Revelation I want to say even in your even in your hardest of Trials it's the revelation of God that has kept you strong it's the
