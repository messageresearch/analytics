remember he didn't just stay in a Manger and he didn't just stay in the body of Jesus Christ but he is now living in his body here on the earth this is Miss Jesus Christ right here in Pony Oklahoma well praise the Lord amen now before we have you can be seated for a moment I want to to just read the the the the the birth of Jesus and you can turn me back up just a tad but there in in Luke 1:26 and and what I'm going to do is I'm going to read one verse you read the second verse and we're just going to alternate back and forth before we have our brother to come in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named [Music] Nazareth and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou that are highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed be blessed art thou among [Music] women and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God [Music] shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father [Music] David then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be saying I know not a Manel [Music] and behold thy cousin Elizabeth hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who who was called [Music] baren and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her now if we look there in Luke 2 and 1 we will do the same and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and all went to be taxed everyone into his own [Music] [Music] City to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child [Music] and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for him for them in the [Music] end and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the Ang said [Music] themar to All For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the [Music] lord and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly host praising God and [Music] saying and when it came to pass as the Angels were going away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us go even un Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord ha made known unto us M and when they had seen it they made known abroad this the saying which was told them concerning this [Music] child but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the sheer return glor God all the things [Music] and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called Jesus which was so named of the Angel before he was conceived in the womb as it is written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb Shall be Called holy to the [Music] Lord and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and he came by the Spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the [Music] law Lord th now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word eyes which thou Hast prepared before the face of all people right Glory of people and Joseph and his mother marveled at all at the things which were spoken of him [Music] sess yeah a sword shall pierce through mine own so also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed [Music] [Music] and she was a widow of about four score and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fasting and prayers night and day [Music] and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord they returned unto Galilee to their own it to their own City Nazareth and together and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him can you say amen Amen brother Brandon would say he said I will give you a sign a sign was told to the Shepherds you will find him in a stable wrapped in swaddling cloth that super sign born over a manure pile stink of the barn with not even clothes to put on him em manual devil wants to make big things big and bright God keeps things humble a super sign you'll find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a Manger this will be a sign the super sign when he was on Earth he was so poor how we talk about a hard times he is that who is that little one it's Jehovah Jehovah God become a man took on our stock crossed himself from God and become a man there's the sign he was God and become a man not rich man but poor man that's the super sign you've asked for a sign said God and I'll give you one an everlasting sign he could have come otherwise as I've said but a baby why did he become a baby when the first little toothless mouth opened in that man manger on the on the first crib that Christmas morning in his little manger crib the first little yell that went from his voice that was God crying Jehovah crying a man come from God was a man every wiet man come to Earth nothing with nothing still but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in a Manger he played like a boy on the street he toiled like a man but yet he was Emanuel and this is the super sign God dwelling in the creation that he created Can someone say Amen where's your super sign God living in his creation let's stand to our feet here today as the man of God gets ready to come amen how many's going to pull on the word of the Lord here this morning Hallelujah I'm glad I'm not serving a god of yesterday but I'm serving a god that is alive today Hallelujah let's sing that song He is Alive and Well let's go up a key or two amen he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he is the same he's the same yesterday and today and forever oh Jesus is Alive oh let's sing it again oh can we go up a key hallelujah oh he's alive sing it like you mean it now and well [Music] he the same yesterday and today and forever Jesus is Alive and [Music] Well amen amen how many are happy to know that in reality not just a song but you know it personally because he's alive and he's well in you that's the reality of it God bless you this morning it's wonderful to be with you and good to see all the family and see brother Duren out of the hospital that was just wonderful and uh just happy to be identified with Believers this morning if you have your Bibles let's just turn over to Isaiah the 7th chapter take a reading there yeah I I I sure wasn't feeling that good yesterday but you know brother Ron Spencer kind of shut down calling in sick so I figured that an invincible Army doesn't quit for lying vanities so we're here this morning testifying that Jesus Christ is alive and well and it doesn't matter how you feel about it it's still the word of God Isaiah the 7th chapter and verse 14 very familiar portion of scripture Isaiah 7 and14 says uh therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign yeah behold beh old a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel which is God With Us all right and Isaiah 96 just over a couple of pages there Isaiah 96 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and then we don't need to turn to it you know the scripture Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever I want to take a text this morning on the Messiah is alive all right let's just bow our heads Lord we love you and we're so thankful to be identified with a living God and to know that you're here present among us to manifest yourself Lord and that you You' never failed to keep one of your promises Lord your word has always come to pass it's always been fulfilled exactly the way you said it would be and I pray this morning Lord that you would just open up your word to our hearts that we might recognize you in your reality Lord we might recognize you alive here amongst your people this morning and identify that you're the same yesterday today and forever I just pray that you would have your Liberty Among Us may you move according to your will in Jesus Christ's name amen be seated this morning uh kept different things in the song service and things I kept uh hearing things that just kind of encourage you and tell you you're on the right track you got the right inspiration so I'm thankful for that move that down a little I don't know seems to be thumping a little bit but uh I want to just look at how the Messiah is alive but many times we look at this and we say oh well yes the Messiah is alive because he raised from the dead and the grave is empty and but we we we leave him back there we leave him as a god of history of 2000 years ago we recognize yes that Jesus he raised from the dead but I ask you where is he at right now today where is the Messiah at because he's not dead He's Alive you say well if he's alive could I meet him yes you absolutely could oh well if the Messiah is alive then you know where's he at and and that's what I really want to look at this morning and I want to keep it in the context of Hebrews 138 that God doesn't change he's the same yesterday today and forever and so if you look and you'll truly recognize what Messiah was then and how he was expressed and what he did you'll be able to identify him again today and you know they didn't recognize him then because it didn't come the way they thought it should but happens still the same today he comes in a way they don't expect and and they they they looked at and it looked like failure to them it looked like here's this this one who claims to be the Son of God he's dying stripped naked on a cross crucified rejected spit upon his own followers forsook him it looked like a mess and it looked like he was defeated but he's still the King right he was not defeated he overcame and he conquered and today he has a kingdom and I'm so glad to be under his Dominion to be a part of that Kingdom and and the prophet said here uh he says we're under the Dominion of the anointed one not only that but he has made us Kings and Priests unto God anointed ones unto God so what is an anointed one it's a messiah the the Messiah the word Messiah means the anointed one and today there is a people on this Earth who are anointed ones under that Dominion of the Mighty God okay now when when Jesus came he came in an unexpected way he came in Simplicity he came in such a way that people could not recognize that it was him okay that's the way it's always been God moves in an unexpected way he moves in paradoxes he everything he does is contrary to the thinking of man because God's ways are far above our ways his thinking is not our thinking and when he does something people don't recognize it because they have you know their own their own measuring of things and there's a way God measures something and then there's a way man measures something and they really often times don't have any anything in continuity with each other you know it's kind of funny I was up in a up in some mountains in Nicaragua one time and I was way up there ride way up in the mountains and you get up there and uh there's a little church up there in these mountains got there by horseback and we were talking to the pastor and he was having some problems in the church you know he's like well you see the brother down the hill he's got more horses than me and so he wants to run the church and it just was so funny to me to think that he would think that horses was something spiritual you know but you know Spirits are the same but the way man thinks is so human it's so carnal the way God thinks it's so beyond it's so beyond anything the way we would think we would think that when Jehovah came he would roll down the corridors of Heaven he would come down in Golden robes and he would come down in splendor and power but when he came down it was a baby crying in a Manger over a manure pile was the way God did it brother brandom says here in the sermon the Messiah he says the father dwelleth in me he doeth the works and if I do not them works then don't believe me but if I do them believe me now that was for messiah the for Messi The church here it comes are you you ready St John 14:12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also the representation of Messiah on Earth yet all right yes where's the representation of the Messiah on Earth on okay you tell me brother kobby where's it at now you say the Messiah yeah the anointed one it's the same anointing it's the same spirit and you know you see this church is all that he was if he was perfect then I'm perfect now he was perfect by sinless Perfection I'm perfect by a perfect blood amen but what he was we are so if he was the Messiah then we are Messiahs if he was a Healer then we have the same power to go and to heal the sick if he cast out Devils then his church will do the same thing she is to be the exact representation a reflection of him this very same Messiah that was here 2,000 years ago that Messiah is not dead he's not in a grave but he is alive this morning and he's in a people in such humility in such Simplicity that it looks foolish to the world and even when you look at yourself you say me yeah I Messiah yeah no no you see if it was going to be Messiah if it was going to be a messiah if it was going to be a manifested Son of God it would look like this and it would look like that and it would look and you start measuring it by the measurement of man but the prophet said the Messiahs that's right Messiahs the representation of Messiah on Earth yet so the Messiah is on Earth right now but it's in a people the Bride of Jesus Christ now when the Messiah came he came by a stable and I I just want you to let's just I want you to Journey with me in your minds as best you can uh and just think about this we're gathered around this this this Barn a cave in the wall and you hear the cows in there and it stinks I mean have you ever been in a in an Old Barn they stink they're not a pleasant place and you're in there it's dark out the the city is crowded there's all this noise going on there's this this this mother in there crying out in labor pains she doesn't have a nice bed she doesn't have nice sheets she's laying in a pile of straw with with animals all running around there's probably mice and rats running around there too I mean why wouldn't they be and you got all of this and a pile of manure in the corner and this is Emmanuel you say you know if we were sitting there and be like oh yes it's just so wonderful think about it the Fulfillment of Isaiah 9:6 the Fulfillment of a son being given to us and the Fulfillment of the Prince of Peace the Mighty God all of that right there in the dirt it's absurd it's ridiculous you would if if somebody were to be sitting let if we were to go to to uh I noticed you had a chicken coop brother Caleb where where'd you go I just seen you a second ago I lost you there you are if we were over there and you know you got your little chicken coop on the side of the house and some wafs came in and they were like hey we we we don't have anywhere to go can we have our baby in your chicken coop and you be like uh well if you have to I guess you know and and then I we say well I just want you to know this is the fulfill this is the greatest thing that ever happened on Earth in your chicken coop it's ridiculous but it's what happened in such a way and nobody knew about it nobody understood what was going on nobody nobody could believe that God would do something that it didn't happen in the great religious palaces it didn't happen in the the great places of the earth and the kingdoms of the earth it didn't happen in those places it happened in a pile of dirt and straw and manure in a stable somewhere but that gives me so much hope that gives me so much courage to know that if God can come and he can come in a way that would be like that and he would Express himself and he would bring forth the Messiah in that then he can come and he can reveal himself and he can express himself through this pile of dirt and manure and garbage this little Earthly vessel that has nothing of value or goodness in it he can come and reveal himself in Me God hides himself in Simplicity God is not in the great things he's not in the the Beauty and the glamour he hides himself in simplicity so much that the whole world walks right past it the religious people missed it the the scribes the Pharisees these people that studied the scriptures they had everyone memorized they knew all of the prophecies and prophecies being fulfilled right there in their day and they knew nothing about it God hiding himself in Simplicity and then revealing himself in the same he's doing the same thing today and yet that was the Messiah that was the Messiah laying in a in a Manger wrapped up in a old piece of cloth it didn't come to a person you would expect it came to Mary a little girl that lived in a mean little town called Nazareth was an unexpected place an unexpected person and he had Jesus when he was born he had the reputation that he was born illegitimately all right everything about it didn't make sense everything about it was Simplicity humility you know he was born under a bad name you know and I've been born under a bad name too they not good about me but he has expressed and revealed himself in my life their educational ethics could not swallow that their interpretation of the scriptures know nothing about that but yet it was thus saith the Lord he says it Shivers me to think it to see see the same thing reoccurring again God cannot change the same thing is reoccurring again in this day God coming manifesting himself the Messiah on Earth and it doesn't come according to their interpretation of the scriptures but it's exactly according to thus sayeth the Lord now where is the Messiah today where is he at what does the proph phy say what did the prophecy say the Messiah would be show me one place where Jesus didn't fulfill it he fulfilled it line upon line scripture upon scripture he was exactly according to the prophecy exactly according to the promise and yet completely different to the human thinking it's the same thing today what does the prophecy say about the Messiah today what does it say about where what this church will be in this last day it says in Ephesians 5 27 that he will present to himself a glorious church not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish this last day church is going to be a glorious church it's not going to be a church that just barely survise leoda it's not going to be a church that just barely Gets By by the Skin of Their Teeth it's a triumphant Victorious church it's an invincible Army it's a glorious church and there's not even going to be one spot on it from the filth of leoda right John 14:12 verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also that's what the Messiahs are going to look like the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father okay Mark 16 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that is what the Messiahs are going to look like that's what they're going to manifest and now when we start thinking about that we start thinking of something kind of exciting we start to think of something you know with a little bit of uh Pizzazz about it or a little bit of you know glory in In the Flesh or something we think oh well you know I'm going to be going around and I'm G to have my chest stuck out and I'm going to walk up and I'm going to cast out the devils and no it could be a little eight-year-old girl coming up and putting her hand on her daddy and pray for him don't think of it the way man would think of it look at it the way God would look at it and how he hides himself in Simplicity in Acts 10:38 it says how that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him now if we leave that back 2,000 years ago we've missed the purpose of Jesus Christ's coming okay it needs to read how that God anointed Colby Martin of paon with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him okay the same power that was on him he put into his church all that was in God he poured into his church all that were all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into his church so if this church is in tabernacling deity if it has the power of God within it it will perform the same works that he did he said that's what he said that's not my interpretation that's not my idea he said the works that I do shall ye do also so we should be under expectation to see the manifestation of the power of God in our lives God once again hiding himself in Simplicity in a simple little people in ponti Oklahoma yes sir and yet Messiahs the Messi hates of this day on the earth in Pony Oklahoma now doesn't that just kind of sounds silly but God comes in a paradox every time it seems impossible it seems unlikely but it's the truth anyway now I want to look at this morning for a little bit just the the principle of Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever and how we can recognize what he was and how he came we can recognize what he is now and how he's going to express himself but I just want to really establish this this principle of the scriptures which brother brandom called the Keystone of the Bible he said the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he says uh Ecclesiastes 3:14 I know whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is PED here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways okay God doesn't change what he did the first time he'll do the second time because if he didn't he made a mistake when he did it the first time if God forgave sinner that came and repented the first time he'll do it the second time if God healed one person who came on the basis of faith if you come on the basis of Faith he'll do the same thing because God doesn't change his nature doesn't change his laws don't change his word doesn't change and if you can find out how he works and you can recognize what he's doing then you can position yourself and be right in the line where he's going to move okay now the scripture says in Malachi 3 I am the Lord and I change not there therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed you see God chose Israel right he put his choosing upon Israel why is there a nation of Israel over there in Palestine right now because God put his choosing upon Israel and there was prophecies in the scripture that said that there would be a people on the Earth in the last days in a nation of Israel in a city of Jerusalem how is it possible that that country resurrected after all those years because of Prophecy and because God's choosing is not is not just temporary it doesn't just last for a day when God places his choosing upon you that settles it it's not because Israel is is good it's not because Israel is righteous it's not because they've earned it or deserve it no no they they they failed so many times they they God turned his back on them time after time because they kept rejecting him right down till when he sent his son to them they rejected and crucified him but it still does not change that God has placed his election upon Israel nothing Israel can do will ever change God's mind about it brother Wendell God chose you and you can't change God's mind about it amen when God places his hand upon your life it's not because you're good enough it's not because you're worthy it's not because of how holy you are but by his elective Grace he puts his hand upon your life and he claims you and he says you are mine and nothing's going to change his mind about itj God doesn't change his nature God doesn't God his nature Remains the Same now he comes in a different way he comes in an unexpected form but his nature stays the same now what is his nature well he's a redeemer he's a savior he's a Healer he's a father his very the very nature of him is love he's a God of Justice and therefore God of judgment he never breaks his word that's his nature that's his character that's who he is he hides himself in Simplicity that's his nature every time he expresses and hides himself in humility and simplicity you want to find God find humility and simplicity God doesn't change we we see here uh I was reading the story the other day of David and uh it it says how Nathan came into him and and told him this story about what this man had done and all these things and and and and David got so angry you know he was looking looking at the his neighbor and seeing all the sins of his neighbor and he's like well that guy this and that and he's like well that person should die you know it's really easy to see the faults in the person sitting next to you in church or the person across the aisle or your husband or your wife it's easy to see the faults in them but then Nathan the prophet just turned the the picture a little bit and he says you're the man you're the one and there's going to be judgment brought upon your home and and you're going to pay a price for what you've done and and David didn't make one excuse he didn't say try to offer one reason he just immediately the first thing out of David's mouth after Nathan brought this this this uh to this before him he said I have sinned against the Lord now I want you to notice how quickly David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin if God did that for David David was as guilty as guilty could be he had committed adultery he had murdered his friend who was fighting for him who was faithful who had stck by him for year after year and he murdered his own friend because he wanted to take his wife you talk about a a sinner and David he confesses I have sinned he was a repentant Sinner and the moment that he confessed it Nathan the prophet who has that Divine contact with God turns to him and he says your sin has been put away from you if that could happen under the blood of bulls and goats how much more under the blood of the perfect sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ if he forgave a sinner then he's still the same today and he'll forgive a sinner today I looked up that word put away thy Sin from you and it's the word abar it means to pass away to immigrate leave one's territory to vanish to perish to cease to exist oh my David a sinner as sinful as he could be and yet as soon as he confessed his sin God took his sin and caused it to cease to exist it vanished off of his life oh and you know it didn't David David didn't have to go and repent and sackcloth and Ashes and David didn't have to go and and do a bunch of good works to to earn the grace of God impossible to earn the grace of God he didn't have to do anything but confess and recognize I am a sinner and I was wrong hallelujah amen now I believe many times when when God deals with a person's life and he begins to bring conviction on their life and they say you know what I'm a sinner I need to get right with God and and they come and they they they they kneel down they they they confess their sins they give give their heart to the Lord and and the Lord comes and he brings his forgiveness and he washes out that vessel and he cleanses it and he gives them the Forgiveness they asked for but then after a few years go by they become a church member and they go to church and and they know they they they they act a whole lot better they're a lot nicer to be around and all these things and then what happens is they begin to think oh well you know I sinned again and you know I'm going to make sure that I'm going to go I'm going to be really good for the next little while and and I'm gonna I'm going to try and earn my forgiveness how how did you get your forgiveness the first time you came down and you said God I'm a sinner there's nothing good about me but you said there was a blood that I could receive and you claimed that blood for your for forgiveness that's how you're going to get it the next time that's how you'll get it every time not based off of your merits not based off of how good you are but based off of a blood sacrifice that was shed for you he's the same yesterday today and forever God's ways don't change how did you get it the first time that's how you get it the next time I was hearing brother Brams talk about the receiving the Holy Ghost he says when you go to receive the Holy Ghost don't come to him and tell him about how good you are he says you come and you say I'm a rascal I don't deserve it but you make made an invitation on you made a promise and I'm here to receive that promise you say oh well I want a baptism of the Holy Ghost I want I want a refilling of the Holy Ghost you know I'm going to really pray for for every day I'm going to pray every day I'm going to do this I'm going to do that you're trying to earn something from God that's not how you receive it it's by Grace you come to him you say I'm a rascal I don't deserve this but you made an invitation you said anybody that desires it could receive it and I'm here to receive it God's way is by grace and his way doesn't change if you want the blessings of God you come the way of Grace or you won't get anything but judgment Psalms 103 says bless the Lord on my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases he was a Healer in the Old Testament he was a Healer in the New Testament and he's A Healer yet today in 2024 how do I know that because I've experienced his Divine Healing power in my life I know it as a reality there was a woman that came she was found guilty guilty as could be caught in the very Act of adultery and they were they were wanting to get nmer and Jesus just asked the question whoever is without sin Let Him cast the first stone and every one of them turned around and walked away you know many times we're all ready to cast a stone but if we just look in our own heart we drop that stone pretty quick everyone they turned and they walked away and Jesus said woman where are thine accusers hath no man condemned thee and she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee you see he was the only one that could have cast a stone because he was without sin he could have done it but he says I do not condemn thee and if he didn't condemn her then he won't for condemn me because he's still the same today as he was then if you can recognize his nature you can recognize his characteristics you can recognize that great is his faithfulness and his mercies are new every morning when you can begin to recognize that then you'll know how to get in position you say oh well I want the mercy of God I want the the Forgiveness of God well how do you get it by Grace same way you got it the first times the same way you'll get it every time God's nature doesn't change if God forgave one person he'll forgive another person if God healed one person he'll heal another person if God saved job's family he'll save your family you know that job his children were saved because he offered a blood sacrifice he in his day all that was required was job you offer sacrifice and he went and he offered that sacrifice for his children believing for his household and the prophet of God says that he is with his children today because he offered that sacrifice and you know I've thought in my own heart sometimes oh I wish I could just do something that simple just to offer a sacrifice and then I heard the prophet say he says we have it even easier than that all we have to do is believe on the sacrifice that's already been made come on if job's silver children were saved because of of the blood of a bow or a goat how much more will our children be saved under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ the perfect sacrifice if God Did It for job if God Did It For That Centurion that beli if God Did It for Rahab who got her family in that home how much more will he do it for us God doesn't change Hallelujah God's nature he's he has a law if believe for your household shall Rahab did it worked job did it it worked the scripture says in Isaiah that there's going to be a great Millennium in this great millenum we're build we're going to plant we're going to harvest and we're going to a wonderful time and it also says that they shall be there and offering with them well who's in that Millennium I'm be there and you know who else be there my children I'm not mad out of the scripture and I believe the word of God and if he said my children are going to be there then they're going to be there there's nothing that's going to stop that because I am a believer God doesn't change his nature doesn't change his ways don't change how he reveals himself one time is how he's going to reveal himself another time God revealed himself in Exodus 1526 he says I am the Lord that Health thee Oh you talk about a healing power of God when they left Egypt there wasn't even a feeble one among them because they partook of that Passover Lamb and as they partook of that Passover Lamb it brought healing to their bodies and there wasn't a feeble one among them that Passover Lamb was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ and as we receive the Lord Jesus Christ it quickens our mortal bodies did you know that as they journeyed in the wilderness that their clothes didn't wear out and in Nehemiah 9:21 it says that their feet didn't even swell you know why would you why would you bring healing to their shoes and not healing to their feet I think many times we start to limit God we say oh well you know this is just part of a natural thing if you're walking around in a Wilderness for 40 years your feet are going to swell a little bit yes but you see we've got a God Among Us who he breaks those laws of nature he changes what you would think would be the expected outcome and he changes it to a different thing don't put up for anything the devil tries to put in your life when you have the Lord that Health thee in your midst their clothes did not wax old and then their feet swelled not it says they lacked nothing now he did that for a bunch of people who actually weren't even a part of the promise okay a two million of them came out of Egypt there was only two of them that actually caught the revelation of what God was doing in their hour and yet God took care of all of them you know what's available to us today all things now when brother brandom came up to that pillar of that that that those those three rainbows coming up out of the hill and that form of the manora lampstand he came up there in the message of Grace and he was standing there before that and that voice cried out and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he only changed his mask from Spirit to man now Jehovah the Healer of the Old Testament is Jesus the Healer of the New Testament it came from a pillar of fire down into a man it was the same God it was the same expression that did the same works it's the pillar of fire once it was a man of Flesh another time but it's the nature look for the nature look for the characteristics of what it is God doesn't change his nature but his form constantly changes now in identify Christ of all ages brother Bram says remember God changes his form in morphe the Greek word means he put on a different mask like in Carmen or Shakespeare plays he he's like an actor he changes his form form all what those prophets were that was God in those prophets Jesus said so you call them Gods whom the word of God came to and here I am the Son of God how can you condemn me oh my the same thing is today it's God manifested in flesh the message of the hour the light of the day oh the message of the hour the light of the day it's gone manifested in flesh God doesn't want to remain in a in a book somewhere he doesn't want to remain in history somewhere he wants to be manifested in flesh that's what this message of the hour is about that's what's going on it's God having preeminence in a people here again in Topeka Kansas identify Christ of all ages he says dear Jesus great Immaculate son of the Living God who is here tonight in the form of the Holy Spirit changed his form and come down and revealed his word right in human flesh man women of all walks of life showing that he still lives he's the same yesterday today and forever the Messiah is alive today friends he's alive and he's manifesting himself in men and women of all walks of life and it's the same way he's done it before it's humility it's Simplicity but it's the same Jehovah godall oh he says here and mighty God unveiled before us I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that know that it's not a fanaticism it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group here tonight yet they're called a bunch of heretic yet a bunch of fanaticism on account of the word of God but I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation and I'm one I'm with them living Epistles I spoke of Vindicated God veiled in human form in men and women all God veiled in human form what human yeah brother Wendell what human you see we want to think oh well God veiled in human form that was in God's Prophet absolutely it was that was the manifestation of God in flesh absolutely yeah yeah we say oh well you know I can see God you know expressing himself and brother Wendell I can see that I oh that's not what this is about you see the gospel isn't about brother Wendell and Jesus GL it is to him but but you see the gospel is about Zachary and Jesus the gospel is about what he's done in me it's the good news that Jesus Christ is raised from the dead and he's a liive in my life and if you're looking for Jesus somewhere else whether it be in the person next to you or back 2,000 years ago you're missing the reality of where he's at if you're a holy ghost filled believer then you are a messiah of this last day God veiled in human form yes oh this is a little lengthy but oh it's just powerful he says here and mighty God unveil before us he says and there he stands yet tonight the mighty conqueror since he broke every Methodist Baptist Presbyterian every other kind of veil we need to get away from all the veils of well this is what grandpa said and you know this is what our fathers said and this is what I don't care what all those Traditions say I don't care what they are I'm looking for what the word says I don't care what the Pharisees say he's going to be I don't care what the sadd are going to say he's going to be I want to know what the word says he's going to be and if the word says that Jehovah God is tabernacled in a people if the word says that the deity is not in heaven but it's in you then that's what I want to believe that's where I'm going to stand lay aside every tradition every Veil every idea brother Wendell you've got ideas of your own that's been in your mind for a long time that becomes traditions of our own minds we've got to break through those Traditions that we receive re them from denomination we receive them from other man's thinking we receive them from criticism people saying oh well I don't believe that could really happen in you or I really don't and you begin to build up a complex I don't care what those are break through every Veil everything that's trying to keep Jesus Christ from becoming reality break through that Veil until you come into that Shina Glory where the pillar of fire is war swirling he says break every traditional barrier he says he still stands among his people tonight unconquered by Traditions let people say what they want to do what they want to anything they want to God comes breaking right through that sound barrier and remember they tell me when a plane really breaks that sound barrier there's no limit to its speed and I'm telling you when you break that traditional barrier there's a tradition there's something that we just do a tradition is just something you kind of always do because everybody else does it it's just something you do because it's kind of what I've always done it's a habit it's just a way of life it's something you do constantly again and again and again he says here break that traditional barrier that Jesus is way back and he isn't now okay we've got this traditional barrier that Jesus is 2,000 years ago we've got this barrier of a tradition that says oh well that was God God was back in brother brandham oh well God's over here God's over there and we don't recognize that he's here right now he says break that traditional barrier that Jesus is way back and he isn't now when you find he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what God could do right here in this convention you want omnipotence you want unlimited power then recognize that he's the same this morning that he was 2,000 years ago go he says a Revival that'll be filled and baptized with the presence of the Living God in morphe in veiling himself into human flesh oh he broke every barrier every Veil and nothing could hide his presence when people gets hungry in their heart there's a veil ready to be broke you can just depend on that rent every veil by his great Holy Spirit and here he stands tonight the mighty conqueror same yesterday today and forever Healing The Sick baptizing the Believers just as he always did he's the mighty conqueror and doomed devils are on the Run yes sir they always are when he's around I want to declare that he's around this morning that same Jesus that whenever he came against the devil he defeated him that same Jesus is here this morning and the devils are doomed and they're on the Run they're shaking in their boots because they know that if you recognize that Jesus Jesus Christ is the same today they are utterly defeated before that Lord Jesus Christ what did the Messiah do when he was on Earth 2,000 years ago well he went around casting out Devils he went around defeating every attack of the enemy he went around delivering those that were oppressed of the enemy he went around preaching the Good News of the Gospel of the kingdom of God that there was coming a holy ghost power that would fill the Believers he told them that I will give you power to cast out Devils I give you power to lay hands upon the sick that's what he did he commissioned the people when he was on Earth he gathered around him some people and he says now I'm going to commission you to do the same things that I'm doing that's what the Messiah did when he was on earth oh it was if we were look back 2,000 years ago at what Jesus did you know we we could go through it but we know what he did we know how he was expressed we know the power of God was with him and yet the religious World couldn't recognize it they seen it and it just it didn't come the way they expected it and it was unrecognized by the world it was it was in such Simplicity and humility and and you know when we look at the birth of Christ nobody believed it unless a messenger told them Mary she didn't just read she she' read Isaiah 9:6 that a virgin would conceive she'd read that but she didn't know it was talking about her wow but you see a messenger came he said Mary you're the one she would have never believed that if a messenger hadn't come and told her an angel messenger appeared and says you're the one that these scriptures are talking about you're the one that these prophecies were speaking of and you're the one that's going to bring forth Emmanuel and she yielded to that word you know who was it that came to his birth some Shepherds well why did they come why didn't the Pharisees come why didn't the the the the princes of Judah come you see the messenger didn't come to them The Messengers The Messenger came these little Shepherds up in the mountains and he told them listen the Fulfillment of prophet is today the Mighty God coming down and veiling in human flesh Emmanuel it's happening today in a little stable down there and they believe the messenger and because they believe the messenger they found the Messiah oh you would never accept it you would never believe that you could be the one that's a part of this prophecy unless the the messenger came to you and he told you and identified to you what the situation was Simeon and Simeon and Anna only way they knew was the Holy Ghost began to Quicken and move and stir you didn't find this by reading textbooks you didn't find this by by you know self-examination you didn't find this no it took holy ghost power it took quickening power it took the leadership of the Holy Spirit to show you where Jesus Christ was why did those wise men pack up their camels and start traveling for two years why' they do it because they seen a Mystic light in the sky they seen his star they seen that star and they knew that that Mystic light was declaring that he is here now on the earth they knew what it meant they knew the prophecy and when they recognized that Mystic light they took off for all they were Earth it took them two years to get there but they knew that that Mystic light would lead them directly to Jesus Christ hallelu Hallelujah now there was a lot of people there who couldn't see it they traveled past many a a wise person many a good person they came right into Jerusalem they came right in Jerusalem they thought he would be in Jerusalem because I mean that's the reasonable place for it to be but he wasn't there he wasn't in the temple he he wasn't in the Palaces he wasn't in there he was over in a little humble place in Bethlehem oh you know we think they were excited they came running in they says oh we we we followed that we've seen that Pillar of Fire and we're here where is he that's born King of the Jews they didn't have a clue what he was talking about they didn't understand it but you see they had seen the Vindication yes they knew he had to be there yes oh friends we have seen the Vindication we've recognized that there has been a sign that's been revealed to us and it declares that he is here now Joseph the man that was predestinated to be the Earthly caregiver of the Lord Jesus Christ Joseph who was to take care of Mary predestinated for this he wasn't an accident it wasn't just something oh well Joseph I well I guess we can put him into the program no no this a predestinated man chosen for this purpose and when he hears about Mary saying hey I've heard a message and this message has told me that I'm going to be the one that's going to fulfill these prophecies I'm going to be the one he says I I I can't that's too much I that's I mean I know the scripture talks about that but but you it was it was too much for him and yet he was predestined he was one of those Believers he was absolutely a Believer but it was too much for him you see but then when he got heard from the messenger himself then because he he thought Mary was just trying to use him as a shield to protect her from being stoned for committing adultery but when he realized what was really happening when he heard the message and he found out what it was all about he was so happy to be her Shield he was so glad to Bear the reproach that she had on her life because she was manifesting the promised word it was a joy to him and you might think oh well I don't know about being identified with these holy rollers or this fanaticism or all these different things but when you can recognize what it's really all about when you can hear the message and find out what these Messi are supposed to be and see that it's a manifestation exactly according to scripture you'll be overjoyed to Bear the reproach for the cause of Christ now brother Ram says and there's a sermon brother BR preached in 1961 January 17th it's called the Messiah and uh if you want to listen to some Eagle food that's oh and that's that's some powerful stuff right there it's h it'll choke a chicken any day but it's it's some good stuff and brother Brown says in there he says God wants eaglets he wants Messiahs he wants men and women who have signs and wonders anointed ones he wants a church that's filled with the Holy ghost oh my a church reflecting him the same yesterday today and forever God didn't die he just borne to Kingdom got his Messiahs in it amen every word he says they say Amen to it that's right yes sir they look like him act like him they believe it got the conductor moving right on with signs and wonders following that's messiah messiah lives tonight he isn't dead he's alive forever more do you believe that Messiah lives where where is the Messiah where is this Great Mighty God that's unveiling himself and expressing himself in a glorious Church expressing himself with signs and wonders following right here Amen in Simplicity in humility in something you would say well in a in a stable in a barn with a bunch of garbage yeah that's how he did it the first time that's how he's doing it again in an unexpected place in an unworthy place that Barn wasn't worthy of Emanuel but that's where he chose to reveal himself amen GL GL when Jesus Christ came to the Earth what did he do well that's what his church is going to do he said the works that I do shall you do also and in John 1 John 3:8 it says the son of for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so if you're wondering what you're supposed to be doing this morning you're supposed to be destroying the works of the devil that's your job description because he says the works that I do shall you do also that's your commission that's your job and and we would think oh well somebody that's going to go forth destroying The Works of the devil that'll be such a mighty powerful fancy looking Christian no just a humble sweet little mother destroying the works of the devil John the Baptist came it was completely different to the way they had it thought of was some fuzzy faed man out in the wilderness dunking people in the water it was and we have all these prophecies speaking about how the the mountains would clap their ham hands and the Le the the skip likee little Rams all these things talking about it but when it came it was so different to the way they would have expected it and what man calls great God calls foolish and what man calls foolish God calls gra yes now we know that the first Messiah when he was on Earth he went around and he showed them the power of God he showed them how to put Satan under under their feet he conquered every Gate of Hell he destroyed the the kingdom of hell he set every captive free and here this morning he's Desiring to use a people for the same purpose see when you see somebody bound as a captive to sin God wants to use you to go to that person and to bring the Liberty that's available to them you remember that snake that was trying to bite that man brother said angel said it was sin he says there's great danger in these days and that sin was trying to go after that brother and brother brandom knew that if it ever got him it would it would kill him and the angel of the Lord told him you've been given power to bind these this and others and he bound that sin that was going after his brother now that would sound like something that only Jesus could do and you'd be right yeah but where's Jesus the angel told the prophet he says You must be more sincere there's a call to a greater sincerity when you begin to recognize what God's really doing in our lives what he's really expressing in our natures and in who we are how he's wanting to express himself through us it should we should just lay aside all the carnality of this Earth and and our jobs they really aren't that important all these things like Jesus was a carpenter for a season but then he laid that down because his father had a work for him to accomplish there's these things that we do in life just to get by but that's not the main thing the reason we're here on Earth is to express Jesus Christ that's the focus that's the whole goal of it that in this last day he would have a people on this Earth that would be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone Spirit of his Spirit we should not be distracted with our eyes on all the other things of the world or worried about who's going to be president or all these other things those things don't matter what matters is that God said that he wants to dwell in you and express himself through you oh if if you KN if you Mary when Mary had that angel come to her and explain to her that she was going to bring forth Emanuel that became the most important thing in her life in this last day we have a promise of what this glorious church is going to be one of those things is that we're going to be like Enoch who walked with God who pleased God and who was not for God took him now I I need to close here but let me uh so in in Malachi chapter 4 it says behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven now that's talking about the Judgment that's going to come on the last days there's going to come a day that's going to to burn as an oven there's going to be destruction all these things are going to happen but just before that happens behold I send you Elijah the prophet just before that day when the judgment's going to fall the fire is going to strike behold I send you Elijah the prophet and so we recognize the a pattern of how God's going to work and if you'll look back in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah just before that place burnt as an oven there came a Ministry that expressed something to Abraham and Sarah right now do you know what happened the next day after the revealing of the son of man to Abraham and Sarah now the when when when Abraham and Sarah were there a man came walking up the road he was absolutely a man now uh do you have can you give me the pillar of fire and brother brandom uh you have that picture available so I I want to uh just get into a little something here if you go to questions and answers it's a little bit deep um takes a little bit of of looking at it but he goes for about 15 minutes bringing out some different things on the revealing of the son of man and they said they said somebody told me that you were the son of man they says I don't understand that because I thought the pillar of fire was the son of man and brother Brandon begins to break that down he says well no not exactly he says the the pillar of fire is not the son of man he says and and I am not the son of man he says I am a son of man now in the scripture we know in Luke 17:30 it says as it was in the days of of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and these different things it says so shall it be when the son of man is being revealed now the son of man is that Pillar of Fire expressed through a body and William brandham was a son of man but that Pillar of Fire coming down and tabernacling in his flesh he began to reveal and express the son of man to the people he says I am not the son of man but I am a son of man revealing to you the son of man now many times we we might think that that Pillar of Fire was the son of man it's not but you see that Pillar of Fire when it comes into a body now it is a man a flesh body but it's God in that flesh body and the word for that is the son of man now the prophet when that Pillar of Fire would come to them and they would prophesy and they would speak they were called son of man because it was that Pillar of Fire expressing itself through them when Jesus Christ was here on this earth and the fullness of the godhead bodily in that man he was called the son of man now Abraham and Sarah are sitting up there at a tent and a man comes walking up the road with that Pillar of Fire and inside of him you know what that is that's the son of man it was the son of man that came to Abraham and Sarah in their tent and began to speak to them and began to show them by a prophetic sign of the Discerning of the thoughts and intense of the heart telling what Sarah was thinking in the tent behind him manifesting and showing him a sign of who he was now do you know what happened the next day after that revealing of the son of man to Abraham and Sarah Prophet says now Sarah and Abraham got got way down till they was hundred years old and I can see Abraham get up the next morning he said dear you know Sarah Sarah was a beautiful woman when she was young and said say dear do you know what your hair is turning dark again he said they got up the next morning and her hair was turning dark again I see all the wrinkles going out from under your face since last night well she said dad I noticed your shoulders are straight up oh my a few hours later he went out to get a bucket of water or something maybe come back and said Sarah you look beautiful she said why Abraham you look like you did when I married you when did that happen the next morning all right after the revealing of the son of man all right says here again he says now Abraham the next morning getting up why Sarah you know what your your your wrinkles are going out of your face no other place Abraham said then Abraham next morning he looked up and he said Sarah honey your eyes are turning black again your hair the graay are leaving from it now why is that important why does that matter because it's the hour we're living in we can see what God did in Abraham and Sarah and we can see the pattern and we can recognize where we're at right now we're not looking for the son of man to come we've already recognized the manifestation of the son of man we've seen that and we know that the next thing in the course the next thing in the pattern is the changing of our mortal bodies oh here in the Easter seal he says that's the same thing he's going to do next after that remember Abraham and his group and the next thing come was that change oh now we done seen everything justification baptism of the Holy Ghost placing of the sun signs and wonders of him being in his presence to discern the thoughts of the heart and so forth and he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we see that taking place right now what was the next thing the change of the body so where are we at what's next are we looking for another day to come no we're not looking for another day we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for another visitation we recognize where we're at we recognize the pattern of the scripture we know that just before the changing of the body is to happen there's going to be a revealing of the son of man and we've seen it we've recognized it and that tells us that we're at the hour of the changing of our mortal bodies what God did once he'll do again what God did for Abraham and Sarah he's going to do again he's going to change our mortal bodies and we shall be quickened in Genesis 19:27 it says and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord now that morning that he's talking about right there was the morning his Earthly body was changed and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and behold and low the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace that's where we're living at we're living at just moments any moment now we look at Russia and how they're they're amping up their nuclear program and all these things going on we see the Earth coming to a fiery destruction we see everything's coming to a close but just before that happens for we're going to be changed in our Earthly bodies and we're going to look out and we're going to see the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah going up as a furnace but we received aij of the Prophet before that great and Dreadful coming day of the Lord we received the messenger and he told us a message and we received that message we would believe that message we have recognized the revealing of the son of man we have recognized that Mystic light that Vindicated that he is here we recognize the Messiah is in our midst we recognize that he's the same yesterday today day and forever and that he is alive here today in a people and this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain un the coming of the Lord the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we be ever with the Lord the Messiah is coming for Messi oh the Lord Jesus Christ Mr Jesus Christ is coming for misss Jesus Christ God's not going to be unequally yolked together do not the scriptures say ye are Gods God's not going to be unequally yoke together when Jesus Christ comes he's going to be United with Mrs Jesus Christ who will be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone life of his life Spirit of his Spirit she is him as he was Messiah she is Messi little Messiah amateur Gods under God what was Adam Adam was a Son of God he was a god what is this bride she is Jesus Christ expressed expressed in a feminine form the Messiah coming for his Messiah let's just stand to our feet this morning the Messiah is alive today but don't look for him in palaces don't look for him in fancy Cathedrals and and big fancy buildings somewhere God's never shown himself that way he always comes in Simplicity in humility he comes in an unexpected way and when we look around we we can see the conditions of the earth we see the chaos that's all around us but you know when we recognize the hour we're in that we're just in the last few closing moments of time we shouldn't be so distracted by all these other things around us but we should be looking up for our Redemption draw nless you have a song br kby [Music] in theer of my heart let it live let [Music] it live inside this
