[44:13] the church say
[44:14] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[44:18] seated
[44:19] tonight amen I amen want to offer My Vow
[44:26] unto God and I just want to just talk
[44:28] for a few moments this evening on giving
[44:31] thanks and amen and what it should mean
[44:34] to us amen Leviticus 22 and 29 it says
[44:40] now when you offer a
[44:43] sacrifice of Thanksgiving unto the Lord
[44:48] offer it at your own
[44:51] will amen it should not be something
[44:55] that is
[44:56] uh that is you're made to do it should
[45:00] not be something that you are and if you
[45:02] wouldn't mind just leaving that up there
[45:03] for a moment sister
[45:05] kalila it should not be something that
[45:08] we amen that is required to do but when
[45:13] you offer thanks to the Lord do it at
[45:18] your own
[45:19] will doing it at your own will requires
[45:22] you looking at God Amen and
[45:26] as as as not just nature God is not just
[45:33] uh man you don't you're not here what
[45:35] you have is not coincidence or good luck
[45:39] you have been blessed by the Lord you
[45:43] have been blessed by the Lord and so God
[45:46] is requiring that when you offer amen a
[45:52] sacrifice of Thanksgiving unto the Lord
[45:56] do it from your heart do it from your
[46:01] own will when you come and offer amen
[46:04] and of course this is talking about
[46:06] coming amen an offering unto the Lord
[46:09] and the sanctuary amen and and you're
[46:13] bringing your sacrifice of Thanksgiving
[46:15] to God Amen you're you you're not
[46:20] depending upon the preacher or the
[46:21] priest you're not depending upon the
[46:23] song leader you you are coming
[46:26] readily amen from your heart to to give
[46:32] everything you've got unto the Lord amen
[46:36] so so offer back to Psalms 50 and uh or
[46:42] let's look here at at um amen I let's
[46:45] see here Psalms 50
[46:47] and4 it says offer unto God
[46:52] Thanksgiving pay thy vows unto the Lord
[46:58] Psalm 69 and3 I will praise the name of
[47:02] the Lord and will Magnify Him with
[47:08] Thanksgiving amen a a very common
[47:10] scripture is Psalms 100 verse4 enter
[47:15] into his gates with Thanksgiving and
[47:19] into his courts with praise be thankful
[47:23] unto him and bless his name
[47:26] now when we look at these Scriptures it
[47:30] is it is actually referring to when
[47:33] you're coming into the house of the Lord
[47:36] amen now it was established by King
[47:40] David that there were the Levites that
[47:43] were to there were worship leaders amen
[47:46] and and these leaders were to amen lead
[47:50] the people in Psalms before the Lord and
[47:53] they were to come and to offer praise
[47:57] unto God Amen and we see we read there
[48:00] if you were to go look in in Nehemiah
[48:03] the 11th and 12th chapter when they have
[48:06] coming back out of Amen Babylon and they
[48:09] are setting up the order one of the
[48:12] first things that they set up were the
[48:15] worship leaders and so I I I want to say
[48:19] God bless our worship leaders they're
[48:21] not song leaders they're worship leaders
[48:24] now we we all call them song leaders too
[48:26] but they lead us in worship amen but
[48:29] they are not to be the ones doing the
[48:31] singing We Are to do the singing they
[48:34] they in order to keep us all together
[48:37] Amen in unity they might pick the song
[48:39] that the spirit of the Lord puts upon
[48:41] their heart but where to do the singing
[48:44] where to Worship the Lord can you say
[48:46] amen amen and and you know you you um
[48:50] Nehemiah uh uh 12 and8 we're not going
[48:52] to read everything but amen it says
[48:54] moreover the Le Levites
[48:57] jhua uh Benny uh cat mile uh sh B Shah
[49:04] Judah and and Mah which was over the
[49:08] Thanksgiving he and his Brethren if you
[49:11] go down to the 46th verse it says for in
[49:13] the days of David and of assf of old
[49:17] there were chief of the singers songs of
[49:20] praise and thanksgiving unto God so so
[49:25] there there should be something within
[49:28] our hearts you know amen so we come to
[49:32] church charged we come to church we
[49:36] can't wait to get together so that we
[49:39] can express
[49:41] Thanksgiving unto the Lord that means
[49:44] the song leader ain't the one that's
[49:46] been doing it and we're just sitting
[49:47] there just looking
[49:49] and Hallelujah come on now we should
[49:53] come charged
[49:56] ready to pay our
[49:59] vows unto the Lord now how can this
[50:03] happen you say brother wendle I you know
[50:07] I I'm just that's just not the way I am
[50:11] I'm just not one of those kind of guys
[50:13] that that that express it amen you're
[50:17] just a person that is not thankful and
[50:20] the reason you're not thankful is
[50:22] because you don't uh you're not looking
[50:25] about your life and understanding how
[50:28] great God has been to you because I have
[50:31] a feeling it doesn't matter how whether
[50:34] you're expressive or not when you can
[50:36] truly understand that everything that
[50:38] you have and everything that you are is
[50:40] because God has been good to you then
[50:44] you want to express it to him I don't
[50:46] care if you sing on key out of key it
[50:48] doesn't matter amen whether you whistle
[50:50] like brother Timothy or amen or or or or
[50:53] or however you do it you're doing KN at
[50:56] from the from the depths of your soul
[51:00] because you are
[51:02] blessed now brother Harry brought it in
[51:05] the other night and I I I appreciated
[51:07] all of the uh all of the uh sermonettes
[51:10] and the testimonies the other night a
[51:12] Sunday night and they were all just were
[51:14] were so wonderful but brother Harry
[51:16] talked about Thanksgiving and and and
[51:19] and a thankful heart and how that even
[51:21] science is saying that if if if you if
[51:24] you would start counting your blessings
[51:26] and you start think thankful for what uh
[51:29] you have amen it can run the spirit of
[51:32] depression off and these are guys these
[51:34] are guys that don't even amen that that
[51:37] might not even be Believers but just the
[51:40] law of
[51:42] Thanksgiving the law of Thanksgiving can
[51:45] move the clouds
[51:48] away how much more somebody that knows
[51:50] their god well praise the Lord Psalms 92
[51:54] And1 it says
[51:55] amen uh it is a good thing to give
[51:59] thanks unto the Lord to sing praises
[52:04] unto thy name oh most high to show forth
[52:08] thy loving kindness in the morning and
[52:11] thy faithfulness every night upon an
[52:15] instrument of 10 strings upon the Salt
[52:17] Tree upon the harp with a solemn sound
[52:21] for thou Lord Hast made me glad glad
[52:26] through thy work I will Triumph how am I
[52:30] going to Triumph in the work of thy
[52:33] hands oh Lord how great are thy works
[52:38] and thy thoughts are very deep a brutish
[52:41] man or a stupid dull hearted unreceptive
[52:45] man knows not neither do a fool
[52:49] understand this can I hear an amen you
[52:52] see we're blessed amen it's no wonder
[52:54] there in Psalms 103 and 1 David says
[52:57] bless the Lord oh my soul and all that
[53:01] is within me bless His holy name why
[53:04] don't you repeat that amen bless the
[53:06] Lord oh my soul and all that is within
[53:10] me bless His holy name amen bless the
[53:15] Lord oh my soul and forget not all his
[53:20] benefits who forgiveth all thine
[53:22] iniquities who Health all thy diseases
[53:24] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[53:27] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[53:29] and tender Mercy who satisfies thy mouth
[53:33] with good things so that thy youth is
[53:36] renewed like the eagles you see David is
[53:40] looking at something amen He is wanting
[53:43] to express what is he doing he is
[53:47] looking at the Covenant of God he's
[53:50] looking at the blessings of God he is
[53:53] looking and saying God God has been good
[53:57] to
[54:00] me amen I I preached a message one time
[54:04] on Amen uh on blessings and amen and and
[54:08] blessing the Lord amen and but I I when
[54:11] I look there amen at the word blessed
[54:14] did you know that the word bless it it
[54:17] it it shows up in the scripture amen
[54:21] 330 times in the Bible amen that thaty
[54:25] word blessed it comes from the Hebrew
[54:27] word Barack amen and and and and 330
[54:31] times and
[54:33] most it is God that is doing the
[54:36] blessing so David is saying bless the
[54:39] Lord oh my soul and all that is within
[54:42] me bless His holy name but you see David
[54:46] is looking now that word that David is
[54:49] blessing it's it it's it's giving honor
[54:52] it's giving reverence it means to bow
[54:54] down to it means to prostrate yourself
[54:57] amen before God and and express
[55:00] Thanksgiving unto him but you see God
[55:05] blessed he was the first to bless and
[55:08] that word bless means favor amen so God
[55:14] Favored humanity and He blesses matters
[55:18] of fact there in Psalms 104 and 27 it
[55:22] says these all wait upon thee that thou
[55:27] mayest give them their meat in due
[55:30] season that thou givest them that thou
[55:34] givest them they gather thou openest
[55:37] thine hand and they are filled with good
[55:40] thou hidest thy face and they are
[55:42] troubled thou takest away their breath
[55:44] they die and return to dust thou sendest
[55:48] forth thy spirit and they are created
[55:50] and renew renewest the face of the Earth
[55:55] can you say Amen so God is the one who
[55:58] gives the blessing it's God who gives
[56:01] the
[56:03] favor it's God who gives you your
[56:06] job it's God Amen that gives you the
[56:09] health it's God that has blessed you
[56:12] with such wonderful children as Josh
[56:14] mentioned the other night amen children
[56:17] that that's got all of their fingers and
[56:20] toes children that that that are for the
[56:23] most part sane and sound
[56:25] amen children that are amen that you
[56:28] know we we we are blessed and it is God
[56:32] who has shown favor to
[56:36] us amen it is God that shows favor in
[56:38] the morning times when you wake up well
[56:41] praise the Lord amen it's favor it's God
[56:44] that has been showing favor to you you
[56:47] say oh I've got a good marriage it's
[56:49] because God's been favorable to
[56:52] you there's a lot of good people that's
[56:54] that's divorced amen there's a lot of
[56:56] good people that amen but but here you
[56:59] are tonight and and if you've got a a
[57:01] good husband that's loving you it's

[57:07] God's been favorable well praise the
[57:10] Lord amen if you're if you're here today
[57:13] amen and and and and all of the
[57:15] statistics are against you and you're
[57:17] still standing here is because God's
[57:19] been favorable unto
[57:22] you I look I look all around this amen
[57:25] we have so many things now amen I you
[57:28] know I I you know I I I stand uh here
[57:32] tonight with you know with with with a
[57:34] few aches and pains here even now behind
[57:36] the pull pit amen and and and and and I
[57:39] could I it'd be easy you know or well
[57:42] some people might say well you know I'm
[57:44] aching here and I've got this and I've
[57:47] got that but brother we got to quit we
[57:48] got to quit magnifying and lifting up
[57:50] the name of the devil and all of the
[57:52] hurts and the pains God's being good to
[57:54] to
[57:55] us giving us a heart of love for him and
[57:59] and Hallelujah I'm just thankful I'm
[58:02] thankful that I can still stand behind
[58:04] the pull pit and preach I'm thankful
[58:05] that I can still walk I'm thankful I

[58:09] can still see amen I'm thankful that I
[58:12] can still hear I'm thankful that I can
[58:14] still move around I've been blessed God
[58:18] has been
[58:20] favorable to
[58:23] me amen he shows that favor can you say
[58:27] amen and it's because of his loving
[58:30] kindness and I believe that's what David
[58:33] was so excited about his as he's as he's
[58:36] sitting there thinking of all that God
[58:40] has been he's loving kindness he's he's
[58:44] forgiven me he's shown Mercy to me David
[58:48] was one who who
[58:51] who didn't always have it put together
[58:55] David was one that that amen is that
[58:58] right but God had a covenant with David
[59:02] amen and we think about that song when I
[59:05] think about the
[59:06] Lord how he saved me how he raised me
[59:11] how he lifted me up and turned me around
[59:16] and he placed my feet on S holid ground
[59:20] it makes me want to
[59:22] shout hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord I
[59:27] love you amen you're are worthy of all
[59:30] the glory and all the honor I give you
[59:34] praise can you say Amen it's because God

[1:02:20] I remember thee upon my bed and meditate
[1:02:23] on thee in the night watches because
[1:02:26] thou Hast been my help therefore in the
[1:02:29] shadow of thy Wing aren't you glad for
[1:02:32] the protection of God will
[1:02:36] I
[1:02:40] Rejoice now as
[1:02:43] we think
[1:02:46] about
[1:02:48] this what this season means and not
[1:02:52] going to hold you too long tonight
[1:02:56] but I think as the Apostle Peter says
[1:02:59] stir up he says well I'm in this
[1:03:02] Tabernacle I want to stir you up by way
[1:03:05] of
[1:03:06] remembrance because I want to remind you
[1:03:08] that you have not followed a cunningly
[1:03:11] devised
[1:03:12] Fable when we made known unto you this
[1:03:15] mystery of the gospel and the power of
[1:03:19] the Lord Jesus Christ I've not pointed
[1:03:22] you to a totem po I've not pointed you
[1:03:27] to a god of wood or
[1:03:29] stone we pointed you to something that's
[1:03:32] real a relationship with the Lord Jesus
[1:03:36] Christ we were eyewitnesses of his
[1:03:39] majesty and his presence is still here
[1:03:41] can you say Amen When God says to Adam
[1:03:45] and Eve amen when when he says and God
[1:03:49] blessed them that means something when
[1:03:53] God told Abraham him amen I'm going to
[1:03:58] bless thee and I'm going to bless them
[1:04:02] that bless thee and because of my
[1:04:06] blessings upon you you're going to be a
[1:04:09] blessing to the world and as long as
[1:04:12] they can see the blessings of God upon
[1:04:14] you and honor you I will bless them oh
[1:04:19] praise the
[1:04:20] Lord now blessings are not just
[1:04:25] the natural
[1:04:27] things because lot had the Natural
[1:04:30] Things lot lot lived in Sodom lot was
[1:04:34] the
[1:04:34] mayor amen lot lot he he he he become
[1:04:39] quite wealthy down there in in
[1:04:44] Sodom he raised his family his children
[1:04:48] they got married in
[1:04:49] Sodom they
[1:04:51] were they were quite they they were
[1:04:54] quite the become the elders in the city
[1:04:57] like a mayor his family had a lot of
[1:05:05] prestige but
[1:05:09] lot did not know that the fire was
[1:05:13] fixing to
[1:05:17] fall so things does not mean
[1:05:21] favor things does not mean fav
[1:05:25] favor and so while we're thanking God
[1:05:27] for the things and we're thankful for
[1:05:29] the
[1:05:31] things but genuine favor is when God
[1:05:35] comes in and ignites your
[1:05:38] soul energizes your soul to see the
[1:05:42] supernatural
[1:05:44] real that this place is fixing to
[1:05:47] burn now I'm thankful for the temporal
[1:05:50] things but those are temporal temporal
[1:05:51] temporal you might get a new bow but
[1:05:54] that's
[1:05:55] temporal might have a pretty girlfriend
[1:05:58] and that could be
[1:05:59] temporal you could you could have you
[1:06:02] could have pretty cars and that be
[1:06:05] temporal asked brother Kobe about his
[1:06:07] truck amen nice beautiful truck and he
[1:06:09] had it for so long and then this old
[1:06:11] lady comes in and just I mean she
[1:06:14] scrapes the entire truck all the way
[1:06:17] down I was a beautiful truck amen it was
[1:06:20] temporal you were blessed for a couple
[1:06:23] days
[1:06:25] amen temporal these are temporal
[1:06:29] blessings and though we count those
[1:06:32] blessings we do not hold those blessings
[1:06:37] as if they're
[1:06:40] enduring Abraham was told to walk the
[1:06:43] length and the breadth of the of the
[1:06:46] land he was
[1:06:49] blessed but you see Abraham was not just
[1:06:53] walking the length and the
[1:06:56] bread for a natural blessing the
[1:06:59] scripture says he sought for a city
[1:07:03] whose Builder and
[1:07:05] maker was God
[1:07:08] Eternal in the
[1:07:10] heavens so he had the natural
[1:07:14] blessings lot had the natural
[1:07:18] blessings but lot did not have the
[1:07:21] aptitude or the spiritual ey sight to be
[1:07:25] able to
[1:07:26] know that all of this was fixing to
[1:07:30] burn Abraham sought with the spiritual
[1:07:34] eye and to me that's blessing thank God
[1:07:39] for a youth
[1:07:42] group but that's not the main
[1:07:46] thing thank God for all of his blessings
[1:07:49] thank God for friendship thank God for
[1:07:51] Brotherhood thank God for all of these
[1:07:53] things but there's a lot of people who's
[1:07:54] been part of a Brotherhood even in this
[1:07:58] church who did not have spiritual
[1:08:01] eyesight so if you have eyes to see what
[1:08:07] God is doing
[1:08:11] today now it's easy for us to see what
[1:08:14] God has done yesterday it's easy for us
[1:08:17] to look back and see what God has done
[1:08:19] through Malachi 4 but we need eyesight
[1:08:22] to see that God is doing something
[1:08:28] today and to have those kind of
[1:08:31] eyes to seek the
[1:08:34] Lord as Abraham
[1:08:36] did when lot was down there and in all
[1:08:39] of the
[1:08:40] prestige Abraham was sitting over there
[1:08:44] am man in that hot Barren land and maybe
[1:08:47] he had just rested a little bit from
[1:08:50] from from from walking the land and
[1:08:53] thinking about the that Supernatural
[1:08:54] presence of God and thinking about that
[1:08:57] City I know this land is wonderful and
[1:09:00] God's given me a promise of a natural
[1:09:03] seed but that one who talked to me was
[1:09:06] greater than just any kind of a natural
[1:09:08] man that I've ever seen that
[1:09:10] Supernatural something that met me at
[1:09:12] the beginning and said leave your
[1:09:14] Kindred and leave it all I'm giving you
[1:09:16] a promise and as he's sitting there
[1:09:18] thinking that day in that hot sun amen
[1:09:21] and he's got his feet kicked back or is
[1:09:24] his his his his chair kicked back a
[1:09:26] little bit as the prophet would say and
[1:09:27] he and he's Fanning himself with that
[1:09:29] little F fly uh uh Bush thing and he and
[1:09:32] and he's there and then all of a sudden
[1:09:34] he sees these men come up and he looks
[1:09:38] and in his spiritual eye he saw not just
[1:09:42] two men he saw
[1:09:46] God and when he looked there God Appears
[1:09:51] and he didn't say my lords he says as my
[1:09:56] Lord and when God comes up to him in the
[1:09:59] form of Flesh Abraham wasn't looking in
[1:10:03] the natural he done experience the
[1:10:05] supernatural do you see how Abraham was
[1:10:07] blessed lot didn't have that
[1:10:10] experience lot didn't have that
[1:10:13] Revelation
[1:10:15] amen don't let this
[1:10:20] message just become some other kind
[1:10:24] of a religious
[1:10:26] Affair walk with God in the
[1:10:29] Supernatural can you say amen amen my ti
[1:10:32] is coming down praise the
[1:10:37] Lord so we we are
[1:10:40] thankful we're thankful for that
[1:10:44] Supernatural there was a supernatural
[1:10:48] element that they could see the
[1:10:50] destruction in the land they were
[1:10:52] blessed
[1:10:54] did you know that the Bible says Noah
[1:10:57] was blessed the rest of the world had
[1:11:00] things but Noah seen the
[1:11:04] Escape he was
[1:11:09] blessed uh uh uh Joshua and Caleb were
[1:11:13] blessed everyone else was looking at a
[1:11:15] natural land and they couldn't get their
[1:11:17] eyes off the natural things but those
[1:11:20] two men seen something supernaturally
[1:11:24] while the rest of the people while the
[1:11:26] rest of the people when when when when
[1:11:29] Moses went up in the mountain with God
[1:11:32] and and he come back 40 days later and
[1:11:34] they had all backslid and they were
[1:11:36] dancing around naked uh uh naked dancing
[1:11:39] around a Goen calf that they had built
[1:11:42] it was Joshua and Caleb that were
[1:11:44] sitting at the foot of the
[1:11:46] mountain it was Joshua and Caleb that
[1:11:49] would stand there and they would begin
[1:11:51] to pick his brain every time that he
[1:11:52] would come down from God because they
[1:11:54] seen the globe they seen this the the
[1:11:56] the pillar of fire upon him and their
[1:11:59] eyes were open and it was those men that
[1:12:01] were blessed it was those men that
[1:12:03] conquered it was those men that
[1:12:06] overcome I say we're blessed can you say
[1:12:11] man I say
[1:12:13] tonight we could go on all down through
[1:12:15] the scripture but I think you can I I

[1:15:14] than me but eternal
[1:15:17] life eternal life is where the blessings
[1:15:21] come from
[1:15:26] I I I I would like I would like for it
[1:15:28] to so register in our hearts it right
[1:15:30] now in in in this season here that we
[1:15:32] would go this next year with such a
[1:15:36] praise that this that that we' raise the
[1:15:38] roof off of this place and not just
[1:15:40] around Thanksgiving but I mean told we
[1:15:42] would have such a praise such a free
[1:15:45] will offering such a paying our vows
[1:15:48] from our heart not because I have to but
[1:15:50] something that's excited to give our are

[1:16:15] Hallelujah we are
[1:16:18] thankful so as as we close now
[1:16:25] it's God's
[1:16:27] blessings I I thought of the how how
[1:16:31] precious it is for us to come to these
[1:16:33] worship
[1:16:35] services and and how important it is for
[1:16:38] the
[1:16:39] preacher The Minister's
[1:16:42] job as as preachers we're not priests
[1:16:45] but we're
[1:16:47] preachers how beautiful are the feet of
[1:16:51] them who bring preach the gospel of glad
[1:16:55] tidings
[1:16:56] amen and I think of this scripture
[1:16:59] because it's after the same ordinance
[1:17:00] this is here is in in in in uh numbers
[1:17:04] the 6th chapter and the 23rd
[1:17:07] verse and the reason I'm bringing this
[1:17:09] in is because I think
[1:17:13] it's this is this is the time that we
[1:17:16] bring our offerings now we're thankful
[1:17:18] outddors and we're and we're and we're
[1:17:20] very
[1:17:21] blessed but but it's
[1:17:24] accumulated love and prayer and
[1:17:27] blessings that God has and the realities
[1:17:29] throughout the week that when we come
[1:17:31] into church how precious it
[1:17:34] is
[1:17:37] and the Levites were to pronounce the
[1:17:41] blessings of God upon the people and
[1:17:45] this was this is what God commanded them
[1:17:47] numbers 6 and
[1:17:49] 23 speak unto Aaron and his son saying
[1:17:52] on this
[1:17:53] wise you shall bless the children of
[1:17:57] Israel saying unto them the Lord bless
[1:18:01] thee and keep Thee the Lord make his
[1:18:05] face shine upon thee and be gracious
[1:18:07] unto
[1:18:08] thee the Lord lift up his countenance
[1:18:11] upon thee and give thee
[1:18:13] peace and they shall put my name upon
[1:18:18] the children of
[1:18:21] Israel and I
[1:18:24] will
[1:18:26] bless
[1:18:28] them you go back and the scripture says
[1:18:32] all the way back to the very last
[1:18:34] chapter of the Book of Revelations he
[1:18:36] says if you should add or take away
[1:18:40] anything let me just read that to you as
[1:18:42] as the musicians prepare to
[1:18:46] come if you
[1:18:51] should let's see see
[1:18:57] um the 22 and 18 for I testify unto
[1:19:01] every man that heareth the words of the
[1:19:04] prophecy of this
[1:19:06] book If any man shall add unto these
[1:19:09] things God shall add unto him the
[1:19:12] plagues that are written in the
[1:19:14] book and if any man shall take away from
[1:19:17] the words of this
[1:19:20] book uh uh words of the book of this
[1:19:23] prophecy God shall take away his part
[1:19:25] out of the book of life out of the holy
[1:19:27] city and from the things that are
[1:19:30] written therein can you see man now it's
[1:19:36] a
[1:19:36] curse it's a curse If any
[1:19:42] man take any of the blessings out of it
[1:19:45] if you if you mess with anything it
[1:19:48] becomes a
[1:19:50] curse but then the scripture says man
[1:19:54] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:19:55] every
[1:19:58] word but he says blessed is he that
[1:20:03] heareth or readeth the words of this
[1:20:08] prophecy now I want I want you to really
[1:20:11] think about
[1:20:12] this
[1:20:17] why why are we so
[1:20:21] blessed
[1:20:23] because for Seven
[1:20:27] Ages no
[1:20:30] one had every
[1:20:36] word it was in
[1:20:39] symbols but in this
[1:20:42] generation the Lord has given
[1:20:45] us every
[1:20:51] word

[1:21:08] word has been brought to
[1:21:13] us so that there can be Faith the name
[1:21:17] of the Lord can be upon
[1:21:20] us it's a privilege to live
[1:21:23] by every
