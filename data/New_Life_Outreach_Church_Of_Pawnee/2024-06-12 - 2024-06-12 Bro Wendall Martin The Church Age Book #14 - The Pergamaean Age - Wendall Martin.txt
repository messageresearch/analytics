him and and that we're proud for that miracle baby and and um he responded thank you we're going to be leaning hard on the Lord especially for the next few months every week is a milestone there are many risk to shaul's life and and health and we trust to see him uh God to see him through each day and night and we're counting on those prayers and um so I I told him just count on us to be standing

what one pound and 4 o amen that's just that's just dinky and um so we want to continue to pray for them we're going to be starting in the uh Third Church Church age tonight and so um we're going to read the the entire um passage for that church age and um and and we'll just go on from there so we're going to start at the 12th verse to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things saith he which hath this sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy Works where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast them there that hold the doctrine of balum who taught Balo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed and idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it amen let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your love and your blessings tonight Lord thank you for uh the wonderful songs of Zion Lord and giving us a a a a song of testimony in our heart Lord to sing those songs with conviction and Zeal father we thank you for the love that you have given us Lord we thank you for the revelation of of your book The Revelation Lord in this last day father for we know that the unveiling of your word is the unveiling of the bride and we love you for it father now we just ask that you would help us Lord as we read tonight and and ask Lord that your uh spirit would be with us and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated we um so uh for for um sister Zoe and and um and brother Josiah you we we don't really preach uh not going to be preaching tonight but um we're going to read in the church age book and and how many brought your church age books amen and uh actually I've got I um um tell you what praise the Lord um would you run in my in my office and get a church age book it's it's right there on my desk uh all the way over than that four far uh you'll see it it's in a stack amen and so um we're going to start at page 158 and um man I love I love the church age book now we so we we've got to remember now that the um um what God is doing it's the unveiling of the Mysteries so this these seven Church ages seven um oh you've got a book back here well you got an extra one here too if you want to if you want to read that there amen that's only $50 okay all right so you don't anyone else need a church age book Hallelujah so um so we we um uh the unveiling the the the the whole purpose of the um of the prophet's message was was to Amen to um bring us a message it was the opening of the seals the unveiling of the um the unscrambling of the of the Mysteries that uh um that have been hid in the Book of Revelations and so that is that is the very specific purpose uh that God brought to us so remember amen it was the um the the seven Thunders being interpreted and to turning our hearts back to the apostolic fathers so and so we appreciate this I um I I think that we should take this very seriously not just uh having these on Wednesday night but read your church age book study this thing because there's there's so much in that and when we do it do it prayerfully because I do believe that that there is a specific purpose that that the Lord is trying to show to us he's showing us two things here now amen uh is showing us the the the apostate church but it's also positioning the bride of Jesus Christ positioning you where you belong and so uh we we we want to to to really understand that this is not just Doctrine but God is showing us who we are amen and how to to bypass a lot of the nonsense uh that that there is in Leona amen and so we want to keep that in mind let's let's start here in in um uh one page 158 and um amen we're going to uh actually we just read that entire uh thing there so let's go ahead and go down here to uh to the pergamus paragraph it says uh pergamum ancient name was situated in uh Mia uh in a district watered by Three Rivers by one of which is communicated to uh to the Sea it was described as the most illustrious City in Asia it was the city of uh it was the city of culture with a library second only to that in Alexandria but it but yet it was a city of great sin given over to uh lenus rights of the worship of something whom they worshiped in the form of a living serpent uh which housed and fed the temple in this beautiful Cent city of integrated Groves and public walks and parks and lived a small group of dedicated believers who were not fooled by the veneer of Beauty and uphor the satanic worship that filled the place the per uh the pergam age lasted about 300 years from 312 to 606 ad using our god-given rule for choosing the messenger to each age that is we choose the one whose Ministry most uh closely approximates that of the first messenger Paul we unhesitatingly declare the pergan messenger to be Martin Martin was born in 3155 in Hungary however his life work was in France where he labored in and around tours as a bishop he died in 399 this great Saint was the uncle of another wonderful Christian St Patrick of Ireland Martin was converted to Christ while he was following a career as a professional Soldier it was while he still engaged in this occupation that the uh that a most remarkable Miracle occurred it is recorded that a beggar lay sick in the street of the town where Martin was posted the winter cold was more than he could bear for he was poorly clad no one paid any attention to his needs until Martin came by seeing this poor man's plight but not having an extra garment he took off his outer cloak and cut it into two with his sword and wrapped the clock the cloth around the freezing man he attended him the best he could and went on his way that night the Lord Jesus appeared unto him in a vision and there he stood like a beggar wrapped in the half of Martin's garment he spoke to him and said Martin though he is only a Catan he has uh uh he is only a kman hath clothed me with this garment from that time on Martin sought to serve the Lord with all his heart his life become a series of of Miracles manifesting the power of God after having left the Army and having become a leader in the church he took a very militant stand against idolatry he he cut down the Groves broke up the images pulled down the altars when confronted by the pagans for his deeds he challenged them much the same manner that Elijah did the prophets of Baal he offered to be tied to a tree on its Underside so that when it was cut down it would crush him unless God intervened and turn the tree around while it fell the Wy Heathen uh tied him to a tree that was growing on the side of a hill assured the natural pull of gravity would cause the tree to fall as to crush him and just as the tree began to fall God swung it around and Uphill contrary to all the natural laws and the Fe fleeing Heathen were crushed as the tree fell on several of them historians acknowledge that on at least three occasions he raised the dead by faith in jesus' name in one instance he prayed for a dead baby like Elisha he laid himself on the babe and prayed and it come back to life and health on another occasion he was called to help deliver a brother who was being carried away to his death in a time of great uh persecution by the time he arrived the poor man was already dead he had hang they had hanged him on on a tree his body was lifeless and his eyes protruded from the sockets but Martin took him down and when he prayed the man was restored to life and to his rejoicing family Martin never did fear the enemy regardless of who it was thus he went to personally face a wicked Emperor who was responsible for the death of many Spirit-filled Saints the emperor would not Grant an audience so Martin went to a friend of the emperor one damasus a cruel Bishop of Rome but the bishop being a nominal Christian of the false Vine would not intercede Martin went back to the Palace but by now the gates had been locked and they would not allow him to Enter he laid down on his face before the Lord and prayed that he is able that that he be able to get into the palace he heard a voice bidding him arise and when he did so he saw the gates open of their own accord he walked into the court but the Arrogant ruler would not turn his head and speak to him Martin again prayed and suddenly a fire came spontaneously from the seat of the throne and the unhappy Emperor vacated speedily surely the Lord humbles the proud and exalts the lowly isn't that something such was his ardor in serving the lord that the devil was mightily aroused the enemy of Truth hired assassins to kill Martin they came by stealth to his home as they were about to kill him he stood erect and bared his throat to the sword and as they leaped forward the power of God suddenly hurled them back across the room so overcome were they in that Holy and fearful atmosphere that they crawled upon their hands and knees and begged forgiveness for the attempt upon his life too often when men are signally used of the Lord they become lifted up with pride but not so with Martin he even remained humble uh he ever remained humble servant of God one night as he was preparing to enter into to the pull pit a beggar came to a study and asked for some clothing Martin referred the beggar to his head Deacon and the hottie Deacon commanded him to leave thereupon he went back to see Martin and Martin arose and gave the beggar his own fine robe and bade the Deacon bring him another robe which was of lesser quality that night as Martin preached the word the flock the flock of God saw a soft white glow of light around his person surely this was a great man a true Messenger to that age never desirous of ought but to please God he lived a most consecrated life never could he be induced to preach until he had prayed or first prayed and was in such spiritual frame as to know and delivered the full counsel of God by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven often he would keep the people waiting while he prayed for full Assurance just to know about Martin and his mighty Ministry might make one think that the persecution of the Saints had invaded not so they were still being destroyed by the devil through the instrumentality of the wicked they were burned at the state they were nailed to logs face down and wild dogs were turned loose on them so that the dogs would tear away the Flesh and the bounds leaving the victims to die a terrible torture in terrible torture babes were ripped from expectant mothers and thrown to the Hogs women's breasts were cut off and they were forced to stand erect while each heartthrob poured out the blood until they crumpled in death the tragedy was even greater to think about when one realizes that this was not solely the work of a heathen but many times it was caused by so-called Christians who felt that they did God a favor in Exterminating these loyal so soldiers of the Cross who stood for the word in obedience to the Holy Spirit John 16:2 they shall put you out of the synagogue yay the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God a service Matthew 24:9 and they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake by signs and wonders by the power of the spirit Martin was truly Vindicated as the messenger to the age but not only was he gifted by great ministry he himself was forever true to the word of God he fought organization he withstood sin in high places he championed the truth in word and deed and lived out a full life of Christian Victory a biographer wrote of him on this wise no one ever saw him angry Disturbed grieving or laughing he was always one and the same and seemed something behind or Beyond mortal wearing his countenance a sort of celestial Joy never was anything on his lips but Christ never anything in his heart but piety peace and pity often did he weep for the sins even of those his distractors who when he was quiet and absent attacked attacked him with viperous lips and poison tongue many hated him for virtues they themselves did not possess and could not imitate and alas his bitterest ass salant were Bishops so that's quite a that's quite a testimony to to this uh Third Church age messenger now and and and you've got to remember now amen the word came to that messenger for that age so so the the um amen God raised these men up amen these were specially built men these were men that God raised up and anointed to bring the word to that Generation Now there were now this is not especially in this age here uh there's there's others that that thought it should be somebody else uh as as uh should be the messenger amen but the prophet God God through the inspiration uh brought the prophet to the um amen uh to this understanding here and remember when the angel of the Lord when he was through preaching these seven Church ages that the that the pillar of fire left brother brandham and went over there to the to the side of the building or the back of the building there and and literally amen done the seven uh the seven candlesticks and the way that brother brandham has wrote in your church age uh or has put here he had that on the on the chalkboard and the pillar of fire came and displayed the entire thing just like brother brandham had it which gives you and I an assurance amen that God knew what he was doing amen and of course we know we know what what was uh taking place amen we can readily accept because we're looking back 50 years and we can see the full scope of things just like believing in Jesus amen we can look back at but but back in that in that day you had to accept that prophet's message you had to believe it amen and so uh and so I I think we're just we're so it's so beautiful um Amen to see how all of this comes together amen and I've always loved the the writings and the and and and this the life of uh Martin St Martin because he is truly an incredible an incredible man now we're going to go to the salutation and um and so uh we're in page 162 we're going to start there at the first paragraph amen and um we're going to he's going to start dealing with the deity now at at the at the beginning of each one of these Church ages amen you will notice that Jesus is is referring himself he is he he's going back showing that he is he is almighty God Amen now you you remember the first age there in in in Revelations 2 and 1 amen it says he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks and then you go down to the eth verse there the samon uh it says these things sayith the first and the last which was dead and is alive you go on down to the 12th verse these things saith he which hath a sharp sword with the two edges every time that he is he is revealing himself to another age the beginning of that age he always establishes that he and he alone is God Amen he and he alone now you've got to understand there's where Satan was going to fight he was going to fight against God and the godhead amen they were going to introduce the three gods they were going to introduce um the prayers to the Saints they were going to introduce these saint but all through every age God comes back and he and and he's and he's saying Jesus comes back and saying I am God I am all God there's not one there's not two there's not three there's not five amen and it's incredible because Hallelujah you would think this you would think the folks in our in our message amen uh would have that clear cuz brother brandham preached it pretty clearly and uh but yet there's still some that's that believes in two and there's this and there's that I want to tell you there's only one God and he lives in the body of Jesus Christ can you say Amen all right and so and and and as we go now you remember and we're going to get into this here in a minute as as we read listen there's a re reason why we stay with what the word says we're not we're not interested in what someone else says necessarily amen uh though we want to Rejoice uh with other people's revelation of the word the word is our absolute the word is where we came from and so we we should never never be swayed one way or the other you know uh um well well this good preacher or this good personal there's a lot of wonderful personalities and and that could Le you from the word we don't want to be led astray from the word by any kind of a personality we stay with the word because that's who we are is the word can you say Amen now amen let's let's start Revelations um oh there in the salutation it says Revelations 2 and2 B these things saith he which hath a sharp sharp sword with two edges the message to the church the Third Church age is about to come forth um the the third scene of this unfolding drama of Christ in the midst of his church is about to be revealed with trumpet-like voice the spirit presents the matchless one he which hath the sharp sword with two edges how vastly different is this presentation from the time when pilate introduced the Lamb of God clothed in mocking Robes of purple and smitten and Thorn crowned saying behold your king now Regal robed and crowned with uh with Glory stands the Risen Lord Christ the power of God in these words he which hath the sharp sword with two edges lies another revelation of the godhead in the physan age you will recall he was set forth as the unchanging God in the Samaran age we saw him as the one true God and beside him there was no other now in the pergam Manan age there is a further revelation of his godhead set forth by the Association his association with a sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and moral and as a discerner of the thought and the intents of the heart Ephesians 6:1 17 take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Revelations 9 or 19 and 13th and 15th verse he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God and out of his mouth goeth a sharp two-edged sword John 1 1 through3 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the same word was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made which was made 1 John 5:7 there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one now we can see his association with the word he is the word he uh uh that is who he is the word in his name there in uh John 1 and one where it says in the beginning was the word the root from which we get our translation for word is logos which means the thought or concept it has the double meaning of thought and speech now a thought ex expressed is a word or words isn't that wonderful and beautiful John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus I love that the concept of God was expressed in Jesus you want to know what God is thinking all you have to do is look at Jesus Christ he is the heartbeat the very expression of God it says now John says the concept of God was expressed in Jesus Paul says the very same thing in Hebrews 1 1 through3 God who at soundry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son logos whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the power of His word when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high God become expressed in the person of Jesus Christ Jesus was the express image of God again John 1:14 the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the very substance of God was flesh and dwelt Among Us now you now brother Bram is not missing any points here he's trying to tell us there's don't don't don't try to get it all mixed up the creation of that body was so that the god of Glory could live in that flesh amen we don't we're not we we we don't need no other Revelation to try to to try to make it anything different we it is it the mystery is God in flesh don't mess with that can you say Amen then through that flesh that sinless body of Jesus Christ he paid the price God shed his own blood so to redeem you who is the word in a fallen body hallelujah amen he's he's here to bring many sons back to Glory now watch he says the very substance of God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the great spirit God unto which no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold was now tabernacled in flesh and dwelt among men expressing the fullness of God to men John 1:18 no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him God who on occasions would manifest his presence by the pillar of fire cloud and the or Pillar of Fire that struck fear in the hearts of men this God whose heart characteristics were made known only by revelation of words through the prophets now became Emanuel God With Us declaring himself the word declare is to is taken from the Greek root which we often interpret as exist which um means to thoroughly explain and to make clear that is what the Living Word Jesus did he brought God to us for he was God he revealed God to us with such perfect clarity that God could say uh that God could say about him in 1 John 1 1-3 that which was from the beginning which we have heard logos means speech which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon in our hands of handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manif man ested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ when God was truly revealed he was manifested in the flesh he that ha seen me hath seen the father now back to Hebrews 1 1 and 3 we made note that Jesus was was the expressed image of God he was God expressing himself in man to man there is something else to note in this in these very verses in these verses especially verses one and two God who at sunry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets and hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son I want you to notice here in the margin of your Bible you will see a correction the word by is not a correct translation it should be in not by it then reads correctly God in times P spoke unto the fathers in the prophets by means of the word first Samuel 3 and 21b for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel and Shiloh by the word of the Lord that brings out 1 John 5: 7 perfectly the spirit and word are one Jesus revealed the Father the word revealed the father Jesus was the Living Word praise God today he is still that Living Word can I hear an amen aren't you glad for that Living Word I love it I love it amen now remember uh who you are amen when you receive the Holy Ghost what does that do it falls upon the genetics of God on the inside of you you become that Living Word as well amen you were in Christ it says now when Jesus was upon the Earth he said believe thou not that I'm in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works John 14:10 here it is most EV evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of God in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that is exact exactly what we have been teaching all along and when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that Jesus produced the word is God the spirit is God they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of God he will have the word of God that is how it was with the prophets they had the indwelling spirit of God and the word came to them that is how it was with Jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him Jesus began both to do and to teach my Doctrine is not my own but the father that sent me acts 1 and one and John 7 and 16 remember now John the Baptist was both prophet and the messenger of his day he was filling or he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb and when he was baptized in the Jordan the word of God Jesus came to him the word always comes to the true Spirit field that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence he said I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive now we know what what the truth is Thy word is truth John 1717b again in John 843 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word did you notice that Jesus said that the world could not receive the Holy Ghost well in this verse I just read neither could they receive the word because the spirit and the word are one if you have the Holy Ghost as the prophets the word would come to you I think this is just this this here should be a a underlined very well amen when you have the true Spirit the true word will always come to you you'll never be satisfied with the status quo you'll never be satisfied with the man's interpretation you want that spirit of God within you want that word because that's who you are that's what you are you want that more than emotions emotions are wonderful amen you want that more than than gifts gifts are wonderful you want that more than the than than than uh uh you know wonderful blessings of God throughout the church service those are wonderful but you want the word and you want the anointing upon that word in your life that's what we strive for I'm not talking about a dead letter Jesus was the Living Word and if you are the seed of God and you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will be the Living Word it won't be a dead letter from a dead Prophet uh uh a long time ago it'll be a living word that is still the prophet's gone he was just the vessel in whom the word came to you you receiving that Living Word take on that life within you and that's what makes you who you are can you say amen amen he says he says now um uh amen he uh he says I let's see where did I where did I just stop he says did you ever notice that Jesus uh that said that the world could not receive the Holy Ghost well in this verse I just read neither could they receive the word why because the spirit and the the word are one if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets the word would come to you you would receive it in John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you uh uh said unto you here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of God again in John 16 and13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth word is come he will guide you into all truth Thy word is truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear the word of God that shall he speak the word he will show you things to come Spirit bringing the word of Prophecy I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized was the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be um that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word can you say Amen now it's not just amen but it's receiving that word what what what does it what does it mean by receiving that word that means you're coming under the authority of the word not just saying God sent a prophet not just saying we're living in the you know we understand the Mysteries that's not it coming under the authority of that word that means when your flesh is wanting to do something contrary you're going to say no we're going to bring it under the authority of the word it's not word this is not in in in in in uh uh just word only but this is that Living Word in me taking preeminence and authority over the over the Bride of Jesus Christ can you say Amen now if you don't want to come under the authority of a husband don't get married amen if you don't want it hallelujah it's awkward these days when I'm when I'm when I'm when I'm marrying and and and bringing the bringing the um the old you know are you uh will you obey him will you love and Obey him as long as oh I find myself even even sort of these days because it's the spirit of the age and and and probably only the message Believers are the only one that still puts that uh part in the in the ceremony I mean they've taken that totally out amen feminism is rampant feminism is of the devil feminism is wrong you don't jump in your husband's face and you sure don't jump in God's face whatever his word teaches you say I surrender my rights to you the word that's who we are don't call yourself a Christian don't say I'm the bride of Christ and refuse that word when it's coming your way so that's what brother Brandon was saying amen once again he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word so how many understands that so it's not just in letter form but it's coming under the spirit of that word amen so that's what we all want every one of us and and we can't just now remember husbands wives boys girls we are all in the category of the bride of Christ amen we all have to surrender our Wills to that word amen so in in 1 Corinthians 14-37 If any man thinkk him and he's going to show himself now if any man think him to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow that is capital f o l l o w so not just acknowledging but following the word friends we cannot be Christians in word only it's got to be a part of our everyday life you say well I just have a hard time get the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost it's him living his life through you oh Hallelujah I tell you what I don't I don't want to be just a I don't want to be one of these guys that's just halfway in and half way out either I'm going to be a full Christian or I don't want to be one I don't want to be Miss isable I want whatever that word says to me amen if you're a woman to your husb uh a wife to your husband amen don't you want to be everything that you're that that God's called you to be if you're a husband to your wife don't you want to be everything God wants you to be if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ don't you want to be everything that he has purposed for you to be I want to be everything amen without any kind of reservations amen that's what I want now all right he says the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what the prophet gave for his age as he set uh the church in order Paul had to say to those who claimed another Revelation in verse 36 what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce truth word but to receive the truth word to believe and Obey it can you say Amen so it's not it's not that you are a prophet saying well this is my Revelation or this is what I think no no words already come so we don't produce any truth we simply accept it and Obey it and when we come under the headship the Glorious thing about coming under the headship of Christ is we receive all of the blessings that come from that headship we receive all of everything that Christ all the deity all the power that he has is now trickled down not trickled that but we're under the umbrella of that glory to the church amen now uh okay so um it says have you know noticed in Revelations 22:17 that the spirit and the bride say come let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same thing as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit amen now now again we're we're we're paralleling and we got a parallel in order for you to really truly understand a woman that'll go and and and tear down her husband to another woman well what are you doing you you are you are hurting your influence number one and then number two you are you you're you're you're missing the whole point you say well you know you're you're you know we're all equal no we're not no we're not the headship is the man the headship is the man the headship is not the woman the woman is to submit herself to her husband now if you want the blessings of God you've got to follow that now this is where God is amen with his bride it's the same thing to where we can come in a setting like this and the now listen the church is claiming to be equal with God it's the feminine spirit till we've got all of these thousands of churches mega churches mega churches and they're all claiming to be the bride but they're claiming to be equal with God's word isn't the absolute so they're claiming to be equal with you are not equal with the word praise the Lord now we're we're getting awfully quiet in here but this is what he's this is what he's teaching you you you come from him you came from God so we surrender everything we are Amen to Christ Jesus the word somebody say Lord I want you to be my Lord I want you not to just be my Lord in word but I want it in heart and in deed all right now okay so um let's see now now and and now brother brandham speaks of this he he um uh the uh brother brandham talks about it there in U uh what I what I just brought to you I believe it was in um taking I I believe it's in taking sides with Jesus and and so brother Bram is really is is is is is really bringing this out because and he's talking about the Corinthian Church who he was bringing this to you see that he said the Corinthian Church was looking at the Apostle Paul as just one just a has been and so they were spiritual they had all the gifts they had everything going and so they were they were saying well you know God's visiting us and so when the Apostle Paul is standing up there amen and brother Bram goes to the history he is standing up and says whoa whoa whoa did the word come to you through you or did it come did it come through you or did it come to you he says let him which is spiritual acknowledge that I am the prophet of the Lord you you see what I'm saying in other words it was God they had to surrender their thoughts to the leadership of that day amen you got to do it they were required to come under the the headship because God had a specific purpose for those ages and that Prophet was to bring them in line or to fight against that spirit that was trying to come against that church and they had to hear they had to hear those Messengers or they would they they would miss it and so today we've got to hear if there's ever a time for us to hear the messenger of our age and to really understand we're not going into another church age this is the dressing of the Bride this is the Lord Jesus Christ looking for a bride who has submitted herself unto him amen All Right Now Praise the Lord let's see here um all right have have you noticed at the very last paragraph have you noticed in Revelations 22 and 17 the spirit in the bride say come let him that is a thirst or hear us say come the bride speaks the same word as the spirit does she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every Church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches the spirit gives the word and you have the spir if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true Christians took the word of their age did you get that last thought I repeat every Church age ends with the same admonition he that hath an ear let him an individual he what the spirit says to the churches the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has had its own elect and the elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them John 8:47 he that is of god heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God they refuse the word Jesus and his words for their day but the true seed Reed the word because they are of God and all thy children shall be taught of God the Holy Spirit uh Isaiah 54:13 Jesus said the same thing in John uh 6 and and and 45 being one with the word proves whether you're of God and spirit filled no other criteria can you say Amen no other criteria so so so to prove who you are see you see how Pentecost has totally missed it Pentecost has got all of this going this direction and that and oh they're doing great they're they're they're they're building hospitals they're helping third world countries they're doing all of these things and and and they've got all of these gifts all of these manifest stations and all God's looking for is someone to just acknowledge his word and give him honor that's all God's looking for someone to acknowledge his word and give him honor amen so so this this unfolding of the drama amen that matters of fact let's just let's just go back because because now now you understand Jesus is the word how many understands that but you came from him that's the reason why it's easy for you to submit to him and others are not uh it's not easy for others to submit because they didn't come from him Hallelujah now you're still going to deal with your flesh I'm not saying I'm not saying that you're never going to you you're you're never going to uh argue with God or you're never going to uh uh have a different thought than God in this mind cuz this mind is enmity against God but but but but but but but but only the soul that came from God can surrender to God I I love him so much let's go back let let's look something real quickly uh let let's look go back to 150 and we'll start there at the uh let's see we're one 2 three the whole thing back here is good but amen uh the the third paragraph there it says 150 in the third paragraph now it says that he hath chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means we were right there with him someone shout hallelujah in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you just you can't get away from that Hallelujah do you love him let let's let's turn over there's another one that I that I like here I've got I've got I've got this page here just marked look look how heavy I've got that marked hallelujah amen let's look at that real quickly uh 152 and we're going to start there breaking in that paragraph just the second line it says these who are of the royal seed are the elect are the predestinated forn of God were in the mind of God and His Thoughts in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decree season as each member came forth uh it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride who is Christ the word right who are you the word you were chosen in that word oh if you could understand and come under submission to that word you'll be just as powerful as Christ is you would be just as powerful because you're under his authority if my wife wants me to smile at her she she's not going to be jumping down my throat and uh and and and telling me where to get off I I I that don't bring smile if you want Christ to smile at you you're going to you're going to say Lord thy will be done even when you don't understand it when you're in your sickness when you're in your uh uh uh when you think it should be another way when you think it should be no no no you're surrendering yourself to him and it brings the smile you are part of him all right let's continue to uh read here it says and took his this this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him come from the same Source was eternal with him and as now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas God was once manifest in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now then we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the sun in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the man was the father manifest In the Flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we turn to your neighbor and say he's really preaching now amen even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn become the many spoken word seed manifest EST in flesh those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth but we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonse there is nothing to Quicken hold this uh this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores the original owner God by his death shed blood or the shed Blood Bought back his own that's your time to say hallelujah hallelujah he bought back the spoken word seed bride my my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep this is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word hearing the voice become aware that our father calling us recognizing that we are Sons we heard his voice and cried out as did the prodical son save me oh my father I'm returning unto thee well that should just make you oh that makes you rejoice because you were now now you understand you see now I'm want to and and that's that's that's all we're going to read out of the uh the pergamus uh Church age for tonight and now I I I I want I want to now as the as the um Prophet is bringing this out there how that it is there's only one special group that can hear the words to that age and the reason that group is so special because they came from the very thought of God that Jesus came from and as Jesus says my meal my meat is to do the will of my father so is it to his many membered bride saying my meat is to do the will of my husband now I just told you the blessings and the authority that comes from surrendering to the word now this and you want to write this down you can write write this down I've got I've got about five quotes here I'm going to I want to give to you that's not in the church age book amen this is the spoken word seed it says the so he says the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ because you are a pre predestinated seed like Christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the Holy Spirit Falls can you say Amen now amen now he would go on down and he goes you know he would say he says now uh Jesus he uh Jesus said he chose them before the foundation of the world they were a predestinated seed then they hauled themselves up into the upper room these seeds the word and the Word was laying on there without any life in it and all of a sudden there came a sound from Heaven as the water began to gush down and it actually filled all the house they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow it begin to manifest itself the word of God being made being manifest all right why why then uh uh being made manifest the word of God uh or manifest itself the word of God being made manifest now now I I want us to look here there in the peram well actually this is in the church age book if you want to just turn there real quickly uh it's it's in um well I don't Hallelujah let me see if I can find it here for you amen um okay it's it's on page it's on page 170 yeah it's on page 170 and the first paragraph I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus' name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in 1 John 5:14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desire of him that now now we're talking about coming under that Authority amen now we ask what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God limitations 3 and 37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when God commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate God and the word they are one now when this word and here's what I'm W to get to when this word that has left that he when this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was life John 6 63b but that is exactly what he is John 14:6 I'm the way the truth and the life Romans 8 and9 If any man have not the spirit he is none of his there it is he is the spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart places it upon his lips while that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man oh can you say Amen if the church way back there in the third age had only held onto the revelation of the Living Word in their MST the power of God would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today somebody say right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt someone say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again it's all head ship coming under that headship entitles you to his glory now now it's debatable whether these sisters when they come under under your headship and my headship you know we might not have too much glory to share with them but God has Glory I ain't got too much I can share with my girl but I guarantee you he's got it that he can share with me so no matter where I'm at or and and my wife too as long as she's under the headship of the word when we come under the headship of that word all of Heaven is at our disposal you children when you come under the head you might you might not have a you might not have a rich mom and dad or anything of that nature but when you come under the headship of the word you're coming under the authority therefore the glory of who God is oh praise the Lord can you say Amen amen that's that's that's exactly right and so amen what is this what is this Glory brother wend and the fifth seal brother brandom says I believe the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the Creator I believe if he can make a squirrel appear that has no here if the man or woman with just a Miss A Part missing that that's the complete animal in itself he is God I love him amen another one uh he says he says placing of a son to take out in a certain place and ceremony before the angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on the very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put in the church and now is coming in that the holy go Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they will speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen the power that's likes coming into the church I know it for a fact say un this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you've said and it shall come to pass you can have what You' have said the placing of the church in position where the power with the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be shut can I hear an amen amen another place it says it says uh one cell goes into another and another cell is built on top of that it's not one human cell and the next a dog and the next to cat and something else it's absolutely straightly human being and when a man is born of the spirit of God he don't in anything into his life it's the unadulterated word of God Vindicated for that hour he takes the full word he don't pull no Creeds nothing else with it it's purely unadulterated God's word made manifest Among Us what is it now listen this cannot just be a Creed it cannot just be amen a we religion this is a Living Word come under the headship of that word and let that word live I'd rather have that than all the shouting and the dancing and everything else I love the shouting I love the dancing and I I I just can't ever see myself not dancing I can't see myself not shouting I I I get I sometimes when I'm studyed I'm over here and all of a sudden I'll just start amen as I'm as I'm reading and preparing for the for the sermon I'll just start screaming out and shouting hallelujah amen that's who I am but see it's the word it's a revelation so you understand that you said well we're waiting on the adoption waiting on the no no no no no no now listen it's no longer future tense when brother brandham said this when brother Bram says this and hear ye him amen he says I know it for a fact it's going to happen that was in 1960 he was saying something's happening the the the the spoken word The Original Seed he's saying it's going to happen Mount Sunset brought us into blood time where you and I are you say well it's going to happen if you've got that kind of a mentality you're wrong it's not going to be a big major thing where it's just going to be amen uh the two million strong Believers are just going to start doing no no no no no no no you are going to be right there in your situation and you ain't got no other place to go and the power of God's going to come down upon you and you're going to speak that creative word as you have surrendered yourself to him amen sister sister Rebecca Martin brother Sea's first wife is an example of that amen she wanted she wanted brother she wanted her mama saved so bad and and and her mama was a religious person that was not saved and uh she she she she she was a long ways from a Christian and matter of fact when sister Rebecca uh first heard of Jesus name baptism oh my it was she was 16 and they snuck her over here and I usually don't do things against the parents' wishes but they snuck her up to pawn e we baptized her and uh uh cuz she she she she wanted to get baptized so bad and so uh anyways we we we we baptized her she ended up marrying sea and um oh it was rough it it you know Sean would go over there and that they they put they'd put movies on that were just you know he'd bring his family over and they'd put movies on that were just so bad or turn country music up real loud and I mean you know and they're just wan to go visit for a for a few minutes they just done everything they could or she could and and um good woman just amen just Hallelujah so but but Rebecca was always telling me she was always saying don't forget to pray for Mama she'd called me up are you still praying for Mama now brother wend I'm serious Pray For Mama and I think she probably knew my attitude about it I just thought man this she was sort of in the same category as Julie Littleton and so uh I would pray but it wouldn't uh uh you know I just Lord your will be done so um but Rebecca kept on praying and and she would cry and say brother wend please that's my mother I want you and I I repented and I started really really helping her pray and and um one night brother Shawn and her she and brother Shawn were listening to um a perfect faith and brother brandham talking about if you have the perfect Faith you the Lord will will he'll believe his word through you and and and talking about that incredible Faith don't have to go through prayer lines you just speak the word and go and anyways um uh he while that was going on Amen something had happened to her and so she at the end of the at the end of the service message uh she came to Sean she said do you believe what he said and Sean said well sure I believe what he said and and and she goes oh man so she goes back and she comes back in and she's ironing in the kitchen he was in the living room and she comes back in she says but you you you think that I and then then oh never mind and she went back in and started ironing again and finally after a couple times two or three times Sean says what's going on he said wow brother Brandon was preaching and I was iring something came out of my lips that says I send the Holy Ghost after my mother she said Sean I didn't say that but I heard myself it came out of my voice and and brother Sean said really she says what do you think of about that she he says well let's just wait and see let's see how it happens two weeks later now listen she's this this lady's this lady has no need of God she is saved according to her she's you know she had a she she' have a top position with the angels when she got there amen and so uh she didn't say that but that was her attitude and so uh uh she calls and she is two two weeks later she's calling right at dinner time she's calling and and she and Rebecca says hello and she is screaming to the top Rebecca hone got just lost I'm got I mean she was just going and Rebecca's going Mama mama stop what's going on what's going on she said I'm blind I'm I'm the parking lot I'm blind Rebecca I I and I and I'm so lost I need God I need God and and she says well we just stop we'll find somebody to help you they were in they they were living in Pennsylvania and and she said no I'm I'm I'm I'm blind but I need God I need saved and Rebecca's going looked at Sean and said Mom want saved and well they led her to the to the sinners prayer she gave her heart to the Lord and uh

strict trinitarian and did not want anything to do with Jesus name baptism and uh and so uh she says Sean you're going to have to talk to Mama about that about being baptized in jesus' name and Sean says whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that's your mama I have done been called on the carpet she does I am not talking to her about Jesus name baptism she's your mama you talk to her she goes Sean Sean I'm
