[6:35] prayer if we can and we do have a few
[6:40] requests um tonight I'm going to change
[6:42] it up a little bit and ask brother
[6:44] Austin if you wouldd mind coming and
[6:46] leading us in prayer we have um one from
[6:49] Sister Carol it says prayer request for
[6:51] my granddaughter Katlyn prayer for right
[6:55] decision and also she has one on here
[6:57] for sister Tracy so let's remember
[7:00] Sister Tracy in our prayers and brother
[7:01] Nathaniel put this today he says my
[7:04] sister-in-law Cassie is being admitted
[7:06] today to have her baby please pray
[7:09] everything goes well with the delivery
[7:12] and he told me she's 2 and A2 weeks
[7:13] early so let's remember that I believe
[7:15] this is their Miracle child their first
[7:18] child so let's remember them in our
[7:20] prayers here tonight if we may and I was
[7:23] listening to a message today in in
[7:25] desperations and it really struck out to
[7:28] me if you don't mind me reading this
[7:29] quote here says now I believe we're
[7:31] living in the days that otherwise the
[7:34] days that we we're living in should
[7:36] cause the church to go into complete
[7:38] desperation says I believe since the
[7:40] message this morning from God not me
[7:43] said I believe it ought to throw this
[7:44] entire congregation into desperation
[7:47] that we have played long enough amen
[7:50] we've went to church long enough we've
[7:52] got to do something he says I believe
[7:55] that the reason we don't have
[7:56] desperation is because it's a lack of
[7:59] love
[8:00] the love of God I think that the love of
[8:02] God causes desperation he also continues
[8:07] and says until the whole church gets to
[8:09] a place that it's between death and life
[8:12] that you've got to have an hour or
[8:14] perish then God will move on the scene
[8:17] he says it takes desperation to bring
[8:20] God on the scene how many can say Lord
[8:22] Make Me desperate here tonight we need a
[8:25] Revival in this church again and I
[8:27] believe desperation will cause God to
[8:30] come upon the scene I believe that and
[8:32] if you have a need upon your heart just
[8:34] make it known by the lifting of your
[8:35] hand God bless you now
[8:37] brother let's bow our heads and dear
[8:40] heavenly father how we love you Lord we
[8:42] just want to thank you for everything
[8:44] that you've done for us Lord just giving

[20:10] you and um they all love you all very
[20:14] much let's look here in Revelations uh 2
[20:18] and
[20:19] 20 notwithstanding I have a few things
[20:23] against
[20:24] thee because thou sufferest that woman
[20:27] Jezebel
[20:29] which calls herself a prophetess to
[20:32] teach and to seduce my servants to
[20:35] commit
[20:36] fornication and to eat things
[20:39] sacrificed unto Idols amen let's go to
[20:43] the Lord here in prayer father we want
[20:46] to thank you today for your blessings
[20:49] that
[20:50] we know that you have given us Lord just
[20:53] the very
[20:55] heartbeat Lord our our health that we
[20:58] have
[20:59] have and most importantly Lord the the
[21:02] desire to serve you and to please
[21:05] you Lord these are all blessings that
[21:09] come from your
[21:11] hand and we want to say thank you for
[21:14] that lord it's such a privilege to be
[21:18] called your wife your
[21:20] bride and Lord
[21:22] Jesus we love your word and we love your
[21:27] spirit
[21:29] we love your convictions Lord and we're
[21:32] just asking father that you would just
[21:35] speak to our hearts tonight as we read
[21:38] here uh along the church age book and I
[21:41] just pray Lord that you would bless uh
[21:44] everyone that is that is present
[21:46] everyone that's online Lord we just ask
[21:50] that you would you would teach us as we
[21:52] set at your feet and we'll give you
[21:55] glory and honor in Jesus name am
[21:59] amen God bless you you can be seated
[22:02] here tonight and
[22:04] um so we're going to start here at um at
[22:09] page uh
[22:11] 226 and um uh this is this is dealing
[22:17] with um that woman
[22:21] Jezebel and um so we're going to um
[22:25] we're we're going to start right there
[22:27] where it says that woman Jezebel uh on
[22:30] the bottom of the page and um
[22:33] so we understand that the holy spirit is
[22:38] is showing us that there would be two
[22:41] Spirits in in in the world there was
[22:44] going to be Christ the spirit of Christ
[22:48] the anointed
[22:49] one and there was going to be the spirit
[22:52] of the
[22:53] Antichrist both of them are christs both
[22:57] of them are anointed ones one is
[23:01] righteous and holy the other is evil
[23:06] amen and and against God against the
[23:10] Christ so Christ amen one is the real
[23:15] one is the
[23:16] counterfeit Christ is going to have a
[23:19] bride amen and and Satan is going to
[23:23] have a bride now but the thing is is the
[23:26] disguises is this amen Satan is coming
[23:31] in and setting as as the book of uh
[23:34] Isaiah the 14th chapter that he wanted
[23:37] to sit upon the congregation of the
[23:40] north and he wanted to be worshiped as
[23:43] God and he wanted to have these things
[23:47] and so they're both called churches so
[23:51] there's going to be uh the church
[23:53] nominal and there's going to be the
[23:55] church spiritual and the rest of the
[23:57] world is not going to understand what is
[24:00] going on Amen they're they're going most
[24:04] of the people in the world they look at
[24:06] churches amen they they they cry they
[24:10] all have a Bible they all uh amen they
[24:14] all talk about Jesus they all do these
[24:17] things but yet according to the
[24:20] scriptures amen Satan has come in in a
[24:24] disguise and he is luring these people
[24:29] to himself and and is getting his own
[24:33] bride amen so so the Bride of Jesus the
[24:37] only way that you're ever going to tell
[24:39] the Bride of Jesus from the Bride of
[24:41] Satan is the Bride of Jesus will always
[24:45] come back to this they will always line
[24:49] everything every belief every attitude
[24:52] every our thought process our our
[24:55] everything about us our belief system
[24:59] will be based upon this right here and
[25:02] if you don't base it here then you can
[25:05] be deceived amen because the Antichrist
[25:09] Spirit the Bible says the whole world is
[25:12] going to follow after that Antichrist
[25:14] spirit and so they're they're going to
[25:16] they're going to follow after him
[25:18] there's going to be a lot of emotions
[25:19] there's going to be a lot of things but
[25:21] I want to say today amen we want to
[25:24] always come back to Vindicated thus
[25:28] saith the Lord everything in our lives
[25:32] amen now it's easy for us to say we
[25:34] believe in Jesus name baptism so so so
[25:38] we're the Bride of Jesus Christ well
[25:40] that that that's good that's good we
[25:41] believe in a prophet so we've uh so so
[25:44] we're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're
[25:47] you're H the bride of Christ when you
[25:50] have received his holy spirit within you
[25:54] amen then you become the dwelling place
[25:57] of the Lord Jesus J can you say amen and
[26:00] his spirit will always lead to his word
[26:03] so let's start here um in in uh 226 all
[26:09] the way down that woman Jezebel he says
[26:12] the Apostle James also like to say it's
[26:15] it's good to have these the these uh
[26:17] these two brothers again that's been
[26:18] from out of town always been it's just
[26:20] been Delight to have you guys here with
[26:22] us uh on these Wednesday nights and you
[26:25] know we know it takes you know there's a
[26:27] lot of things well there's not a whole
[26:29] lot of things you can do in ponie but
[26:31] but you know there's a lot of things
[26:32] y'all could be doing and y'all being
[26:35] with us on these Wednesday nights has
[26:36] just really been nice amen so God bless
[26:38] y'all amen it says um the Apostle
[26:42] James shows us the course that sin takes
[26:47] now does somebody else does some um uh
[26:52] do do you guys have church age
[26:54] books
[26:56] y'all okay all right let me while you're
[26:59] let me just walk in here because I've
[27:01] got another one in here hallelujah if
[27:03] you want then you can take it home with
[27:09] [Music]
[27:10] you so
[27:13] um um we've got so we're on page 226
[27:18] there and
[27:23] um all
[27:26] right um Apostle James showed us the
[27:30] course that sin takes James 1:14-15
[27:34] but every man is tempted when he has
[27:37] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[27:42] when lust has conceived it bringeth
[27:45] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[27:49] brings forth death now that is a picture
[27:53] of exactly what is happening in the
[27:55] church ages as Sin started nothing but a
[27:59] feeling so the death to the church
[28:02] started with the simple little notice
[28:05] Deeds of the
[28:07] nians from the Deeds it went to a
[28:09] Doctrine from the doctrine it embraced
[28:12] the power of the state and the
[28:14] introduction of paganism now in this age
[28:18] it goes It goes to its own propheus
[28:22] teacher so it travels on until we find
[28:27] until it will find itself in the Lake of
[28:28] Fire and that is exactly where it is
[28:31] going to end up the second
[28:33] death now the whole Cry Of God against
[28:36] this fourth age is found in his
[28:39] denunciation of this propheus Jezebel
[28:43] and to understand exactly why he
[28:45] denounces her so we will have to look
[28:48] her up look her history in the Bible and
[28:51] we find that what she did back there
[28:54] then we will know what is going on at
[28:56] this time the first and very important
[28:59] thing that we learn about Jezebel is
[29:02] that she is not a daughter of Abraham
[29:06] nor is her induction into the tribes of
[29:08] Israel as one of spiritual admission as
[29:12] was that of Ruth moabitas no
[29:15] sir that this woman was the daughter of
[29:18] athel the king of sidon First Kings
[29:22] 1631 who was the priest of
[29:25] aardi he had gained the throne on by
[29:28] murdering his predecessor felis and so
[29:32] we see right away that she was the
[29:34] daughter of a murderer and that
[29:36] certainly reminds us of Cain and the way
[29:39] she become part of Israel was not
[29:42] through the spiritual channels that God
[29:43] had ordained for Gentile
[29:46] admission but she came in by marriage to
[29:49] Ahab the king of the 10 the 10 can the
[29:54] 10 tribes of Israel now this Union as we
[29:57] have seen was was not spiritual it was
[29:59] political so this woman who was steeped
[30:02] in idolatry did not have the least
[30:05] desire to become a worshipper of the one
[30:07] true God but rather she came with a
[30:11] vowed intentions of turning Israel away
[30:15] from the Lord now Israel the 10 tribes
[30:18] had already known what it was to worship
[30:20] the golden calvs but as yet they were
[30:23] not sold out to idolatry for God was
[30:26] worshiped and the law of Moses was
[30:29] acknowledged but from the time of ahab's
[30:31] marriage to Jezebel idolatry progressed
[30:35] in a deadly fashion it was when this
[30:38] woman become a priestess in the temp uh
[30:40] in the temples that she erected to aard
[30:43] Venus and Baal son
[30:46] God that Israel uh came to the crisis
[30:50] point of her life with this in mind we
[30:53] can see uh we can begin to see that the
[30:56] spirit of God is setting
[30:58] forth in the th tyan age here it is Ahab
[31:02] married
[31:03] Jezebel he did it in a political
[31:06] maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and
[31:08] secure
[31:10] it it is exactly what the church did
[31:13] when it married under
[31:16] Constantine they both got together for
[31:18] political reasons and though uh though
[31:21] they put a spiritual air to it now no
[31:24] one can convince me that that
[31:26] Constantine was a Christian he was a
[31:28] pagan with what looked like Christian
[31:31] tappings trappings he painted white
[31:34] crosses on the soldier Shields he was
[31:36] the originator of the Knights of
[31:38] Columbus he put a cross on the steeple
[31:41] of St Sophia's thereby starting a
[31:44] tradition it was Constantine's idea to
[31:47] get everyone together the pagans the
[31:50] nominal Christians and the true
[31:53] Christians and for a while it looked as
[31:56] if he was succeed for the true for the
[31:59] real Believers came along to see if they
[32:01] could bring back the ones that had
[32:03] drifted away from the word when they saw
[32:06] that they couldn't bring them back into
[32:08] the truth they were forced to break away
[32:10] with the body
[32:12] political then when they did they were
[32:15] called Heretics and persecuted let me
[32:18] say right here that we have the very
[32:20] same thing going on right now people are
[32:23] all coming together they're writing a a
[32:26] Bible that will suit everyone whether it
[32:28] be a Jew Catholic or Protestant they
[32:31] have their own nin Council but they call
[32:34] it the ecumenical council and do you
[32:37] know uh and do you know whom all these
[32:40] organizations fight they fight the true
[32:43] Pentecostals I don't mean the
[32:45] organization called Pentecostal I mean
[32:47] the ones that are Pentecost because they
[32:49] are filled with the Holy Ghost and have
[32:52] the signs and Gifts in their midst
[32:53] because they walk in truth when Ahab
[32:56] married Jezebel for political reasons he
[32:59] sold his Birthright and you join up with
[33:02] an organization and you sell your
[33:05] Birthright brother whether you want to
[33:07] believe it or not every Protestant group
[33:10] that ever came out and then went back
[33:13] sold their Birthright and when you sell
[33:15] your Birthright you're just like Esau
[33:18] you can cry and repent all you want but
[33:20] it won't do you any good there's only
[33:23] one thing you can do and that is come
[33:25] out of her my people and stop partaking
[33:28] of her sins now if you don't think I'm
[33:32] right just answer this one question can
[33:35] any man living tell me what church or
[33:38] what move of God ever had a Revival and
[33:41] came back after it went into
[33:43] organization and become a denomination
[33:46] read your histories you can't find one
[33:49] not even
[33:51] one it was the Midnight Hour for Israel
[33:55] when she joined with the world and the
[33:58] spiritual for the
[34:00] political it was the Midnight Hour at
[34:02] NAA when the church did the same thing
[34:06] it is the Midnight Hour right now that
[34:08] the churches are coming together now
[34:11] when Ahab married Jezebel he allowed her
[34:15] to take the state money and erect two
[34:18] huge houses of worship of aardi and Bale
[34:21] the one was erected for baale was big
[34:24] enough for all Israel to come and
[34:26] worship there at and and when
[34:28] Constantine and the church married he
[34:30] gave the church buildings set up altars
[34:33] and images organized the hierarchy that
[34:37] had already been shaping up and when
[34:40] Jezebel got the power of the state
[34:41] behind her she forced her religion on
[34:45] the people and killed the prophets and
[34:48] the priests of God it got so bad that
[34:51] Elijah the messenger to his day thought
[34:53] that he was the only one left but God
[34:55] had 7,000 more that had bound the need
[34:58] to bail and right now out there amongst
[35:01] all of the denominations of Baptist
[35:03] methodists Presbyterians Etc there are
[35:06] some who will come out and come back to
[35:08] God I want you to know that I'm not I am
[35:12] not now and never have been against the
[35:16] people it's the denomination the system
[35:20] of organization that I am against I have
[35:23] to be against it for God hates it now
[35:28] just to just let me stop here a minute
[35:31] here and rehearse that we uh what we
[35:34] have brought out about the worship in
[35:37] thyra I said that there uh that they
[35:40] worshiped Apollo who was the son God
[35:42] along with the emperor now this Apollo
[35:45] was called the averter of evil he turned
[35:48] evil away from people he blessed them
[35:51] and was a real God to them he was
[35:54] supposed to teach the people he
[35:57] explained about worship and Temple
[35:58] rights and services to God about
[36:01] sacrifices and death and life after
[36:04] death and the way he did that was
[36:06] through a prophetess who sat entranced
[36:09] upon a tripod chair my do you see it
[36:13] here is that propheus called Jezebel she
[36:17] is teaching the people her teaching is
[36:20] seducing the Servants of God and causing
[36:24] them to commit
[36:26] fornication now fornication means idol
[36:29] worship that is that is what its
[36:32] spiritual meaning is it is an illegal
[36:35] Union ahab's Union Constantine's Union
[36:39] were both illegal both committed
[36:41] spiritual
[36:42] fornication and every fornicator will
[36:46] wind up in the Lake of Fire God said so
[36:50] so are you understanding here we're
[36:52] we're where we're coming now we if you
[36:55] if you go back and and again these are
[36:57] seven churches these are seven uh uh
[37:00] these seven churches in Revelations
[37:03] 2 they uh they they
[37:07] represent seven periods over the over
[37:10] the course of the church these last
[37:12] 2,000 years have had seven distinct
[37:15] periods of time and God is predicting
[37:19] and and talking about how that how it
[37:22] would it would end up or it would start
[37:25] out leaving their first love and and and
[37:28] and and and you know and you there are
[37:31] some there that have some of the Deeds
[37:32] of the nicians and then then the next
[37:35] the next uh uh the the the second phase
[37:38] of the church that it's going in deeper
[37:41] and how that now it's becoming the
[37:43] second third age is becoming a teaching
[37:46] and and we understand that nicians means
[37:49] to conquer the Ley so there was a spirit
[37:53] of antichrist amen now remember the the
[37:57] the the the Apostle John says even now
[38:00] are many antichrists Among Us that was
[38:03] back when Jesus was alive where after
[38:05] Jesus had left and John is telling the
[38:07] church contend for the faith that was
[38:09] once delivered to the Saints because
[38:11] there is a spirit that is trying to to
[38:14] lure you and to bring you back uh away
[38:18] from Christ and so so John and and the
[38:22] Apostle Paul even said he says I fear
[38:25] that when I leave after my departure
[38:28] there's going to be Grievous wolves that
[38:30] come in these are going there's going to
[38:32] be spirits that are going to anoint men
[38:35] and they're going to try to take you
[38:37] away from what uh uh from from the
[38:40] simple love and faith uh in in God and
[38:44] so so we can we can see this that each
[38:46] one of these ages now we are here in
[38:49] this in this fourth age and now Satan
[38:52] has come in for the he's come in for the
[38:55] uh he's going after he's he's he's going
[38:57] in for the choke cold and and so amen
[39:00] now he has got the church it has now
[39:02] been hundreds of years since the day of
[39:05] Pentecost he has now got amen uh uh he
[39:09] he has been able to to to prepare and
[39:14] prepare and prepare and prepare until
[39:18] there was a woman on earth who was
[39:20] willing to be
[39:22] seduced she was she was willingly
[39:26] seduced by by this Spirit of the
[39:28] Antichrist and then she taught others
[39:32] how to seduce so she become a teacher of
[39:35] that how many understands that so so
[39:38] amen so fornication what what is
[39:40] fornication fornication is is a amen an
[39:45] act of adultery uh
[39:48] uh uh from a from a married person and
[39:52] so do you to to have uh to be a
[39:56] fornicator
[39:57] or or from a well from a from a
[39:59] non-married person I'm sorry amen
[40:02] fornication so so she was espoused under
[40:05] Christ she had promised she was going to
[40:08] be Christ amen but she began to uh uh
[40:13] you know uh you know go off and and and
[40:16] and and and commit fornication with with
[40:19] somebody else so so in this spiritual
[40:22] sense amen the church now what is what
[40:25] is spiritual fornication it's idolatry
[40:29] so so it is to accept somebody you say
[40:34] that you love God and the Bible says in
[40:38] the beginning was the word and the Word
[40:41] was with God the Word was God and the
[40:44] Word was made flesh so when we say we're
[40:48] worshiping Jesus amen we are saying that
[40:52] it is this Bible in the body of Jesus
[40:56] Christ Jesus was the word made flesh and
[41:01] for us to say Amen well um I I you know
[41:07] I I believe the the way the the the way
[41:10] uh brother so and so believes it and if
[41:12] it's not found in the Bible then you are
[41:16] in the act of idolatry you're taking
[41:20] someone else's word over the word of the
[41:25] one that bought you amen and redeemed
[41:28] you can you say Amen now am I am I
[41:31] making sense to y'all amen so spiritual
[41:34] fornication amen it's it's not it's not
[41:37] like there is a a a sexual act per se it
[41:42] is idolatry it is choosing someone else
[41:46] and putting your Allegiance your love
[41:49] your confidence in something other than
[41:53] the god of Glory who came down to to to
[41:57] purchase you and redeem you to himself
[42:00] amen amen now the Catholic church now
[42:04] when this is all set up here we're
[42:06] understanding that when Constantine came
[42:08] in and he put He put the politics and
[42:12] the church together and they married
[42:14] then we understand that this age here
[42:16] went 900 and something years and it
[42:19] would be it would become the the the
[42:22] Catholic Church would rule the world
[42:25] through the Kings all of the kings of
[42:27] the earth amen were now going to be
[42:30] Catholic and they were going to enforce
[42:33] the Catholic Doctrine upon anybody if
[42:37] you did not if you did not uh uh bow to
[42:39] idol worship and and worship Peter's
[42:42] Idol or or or Paul's Idol or or Mary's
[42:46] Idol amen then you were killed if you
[42:49] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[42:52] like like the Bible says there there in
[42:54] Acts 2:38 repent and be baptized in the
[42:58] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[43:00] of your sins and you shall receive the
[43:01] Holy Ghost if you were to do that in
[43:04] that day they would kill you burn you to
[43:06] the steak you see they they they had got
[43:09] to the point to where they took the word
[43:13] set it aside gave it their own
[43:16] interpretation and made the world to
[43:18] believe it okay amen so so y'all
[43:21] understanding amen now uh how how many
[43:25] How many's uh y y'all with me on that
[43:28] amen now so so here it is amen they they
[43:33] uh uh uh and that and that's sort of I I
[43:36] I sort of said that for the benefit of
[43:37] our of our brothers over here that's not
[43:39] been with us for the last 26 weeks as as
[43:42] we've gone through the Book of
[43:43] Revelations and and that is we we we we
[43:47] want to we want to be the one that is
[43:51] going to believe everything God
[43:54] says you're not to believe me
[43:57] you're not to believe your daddy you're
[43:59] not to believe your mama you're not to
[44:01] believe anybody else but the word of God
[44:05] and any man that'll put his opinion
[44:08] above the word of God then he is he he
[44:11] becomes amen uh a a teacher of
[44:15] fornication spiritual fornication amen
[44:18] so let now let's go ahead and and uh let
[44:20] let's read uh continue to read it says
[44:23] now then the teaching of the Catholic
[44:25] church the church is female
[44:27] it is a woman and denies the word of God
[44:31] the pope who is literally a polo in the
[44:34] in the modern version has taught the
[44:36] people to join themselves to Idols the
[44:39] Roman Catholic or the Roman Church has
[44:41] now become a false propheus to the
[44:45] people because she has taken away the
[44:47] word of God from the people and given
[44:49] her own ideas to what constitutes
[44:53] forgiveness of sins what brings the
[44:55] blessings of God and the priests have
[44:57] gone so far as to State categorically
[45:00] that they have power not only in life
[45:03] but in death they teach on their own
[45:06] that there is a Purgatory but you can't
[45:08] find that in the word they teach that
[45:11] prayers and masses and money will get
[45:13] you out of P purgatory and into heaven
[45:16] the whole system is based upon its
[45:19] teaching uh that that the whole system
[45:23] that is based upon its teaching is false
[45:26] it does not lie on the sure foundation
[45:28] of the revelation of God in his word but
[45:30] lies on the shifting sinking Sands of
[45:33] its own diabolical untruths the church
[45:36] went right uh from organization to
[45:39] denomination and hence to false teaching
[45:42] that is right the Roman
[45:45] Catholics don't believe that God is in
[45:47] his word no sir if they did they would
[45:51] have to repent and back up but they say
[45:54] God is not in his church they would make
[45:57] the The Bible History of the Catholic
[46:00] Church uh uh uh they they would make
[46:02] yeah the Bible the history of the
[46:03] Catholic church that isn't so look look
[46:06] what they did to water baptism alone
[46:09] they took it away from the Christian
[46:11] baptism and made it a pagan one of
[46:14] titles let me tell you about an
[46:16] experience I had with a Catholic priest
[46:18] a girl that I had baptized at one time
[46:21] turned Catholic so the priest wanted to
[46:23] interview me about her he asked what
[46:26] kind kind of
[46:28] baptism uh she had and I told him I
[46:32] baptized her in Christian baptism which
[46:34] is the only kind there was to my
[46:36] knowledge I had baptized her in the in
[46:39] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:41] Christ the priest remarked to me that
[46:44] that at one time the Catholic Church did
[46:46] that right away I asked him when the
[46:49] cathol uh uh when the Catholic Church
[46:51] did that for I've read their histories
[46:54] and I could not find what he said he
[46:56] told
[46:57] that it was found in the Bible and that
[46:59] Jesus had organized the Catholic church
[47:01] and I asked him if he thought Peter was
[47:04] really the first pope and he
[47:05] emphatically said that Peter was I asked
[47:08] him if the masses were said in Latin in
[47:11] order to ensure that they were U that
[47:13] they were correct and and would never
[47:15] change and he said that was true I told
[47:18] him that I thought they had wanted a
[47:20] long way from what they had at the
[47:23] beginning I let him know that if the
[47:25] Catholic Church really beli the book of
[47:27] Acts that I'm an old-fashioned Catholic
[47:30] he told me that the Bible was the record
[47:31] of the Catholic church and that God was
[47:33] in the church I disagreed with them for
[47:35] God is in his word let God be true but
[47:41] every man a
[47:42] liar if you take away or add to that
[47:46] book God has promised that he will add
[47:49] plagues to those who add and take away
[47:52] from their part uh uh away their part
[47:55] from The Book of Life if they they dare
[47:57] subtract from it Revelations 22:18
[48:01] to9 let me just show how the Catholic
[48:04] Church believes that God is in the
[48:06] church instead of the word here is an
[48:09] excerpt from the Diary of Pope John the
[48:11] 23rd my experience during these three
[48:14] years as Pope since in fear and
[48:17] trembling I accepted this service in
[48:20] pure obedience to the Lord's will
[48:23] conveyed to me through the sacred
[48:25] College of cardinals in Enclave Bears
[48:28] witness to this Maxim and is a moving
[48:31] and Lasting reason for me to be true to
[48:34] it absolute trust in God in all that
[48:37] concerns the present and perfect
[48:40] Tranquility as regards the future now
[48:42] this pulpe states that God spoke through
[48:45] the church revealing his will how false
[48:49] god is in his word and speaks by the
[48:54] word revealing his will he also stated
[48:57] that he placed absolute trust in the
[49:00] word of men and thereby obeyed it with
[49:04] Tranquility it sounds so beautiful but
[49:07] it is so false just like the Pres uh the
[49:10] perversion of the Garden of Eden now let
[49:12] us go over here in Revelation 17 and see
[49:16] what the woman the church who is living
[49:19] in on false prophecies and not the word
[49:21] of God in verse one God calls her the
[49:25] great why is she the because
[49:29] she is in idolatry she has caught the
[49:32] people up into the same thing what's the
[49:35] cure for idolatry the word of God so
[49:39] this woman is a because she has
[49:43] left the word there she sits upon many
[49:46] Waters which means the multitudes of
[49:48] people this surely has to be the false
[49:51] church because the Church of God is
[49:54] small uh uh and and a few there be that
[49:58] find it notice that she is like in the
[50:02] uh what she is like in the eyes of God
[50:04] no matter how wonderful she looks to
[50:07] people and how philosophical she sounds
[50:10] she is filthy drunk on her
[50:12] fornications she was drunk with the
[50:15] blood of the martyrs just like Jezebel
[50:19] who killed the prophets and priest and
[50:21] destroyed the people of God Who Would
[50:23] Not Bow Down and Worship baale that is
[50:26] exactly what the Catholic Church did
[50:29] they killed those that would not bow to
[50:31] the popish rule those who wanted the
[50:34] word of God instead of the words of men
[50:37] were put to death usually by cruel
[50:39] methods but this church that dealt in
[50:42] death was dead herself and didn't know
[50:45] it there was no life in her and no signs
[50:50] ever followed her amen so so how many
[50:53] how many's understanding so far now when
[50:56] you do a history and we're going to get
[50:57] into that as as we move on into the
[50:59] thine tyon Church age we will see amen
[51:03] that
[51:04] she as as she be to
[51:07] teach not only did she teach in that age
[51:12] but her teachings that she
[51:15] taught the
[51:16] Trinity the Trinity was never in the
[51:19] Bible it's hereo Israel the Lord our God
[51:23] is one Lord Thou shalt have no other
[51:28] gods beside me there there is and
[51:31] there's and there's there's just
[51:33] numerous scriptures that God says there
[51:36] is no other God beside me no not one I
[51:40] know not any that's almost an exact
[51:42] quote there there are there are are all
[51:45] these scriptures so what we do is if and
[51:48] and what they done they they they made
[51:51] the three Gods to where you're having to
[51:54] worship father Son and Holy Ghost
[51:57] instead of understanding that it was the
[52:00] great father God that was over Israel
[52:04] that came down and and and and built a a
[52:08] a body that amen uh ignited the sea
[52:12] created an egg and put a and put a a
[52:14] seed of his own the Bible says Jesus was
[52:17] had the very blood of God he did not
[52:19] have the blood of a man the Bible says
[52:21] he had a blood of God Jesus was born not
[52:25] of a man he he was born of God God
[52:29] created a body and then God moved in
[52:34] that body so when you look at Jesus the
[52:38] son amen the Bible says that he
[52:42] embodied the fullness of God so the
[52:46] scripture says all this is what the
[52:48] Bible says all the fullness of God if
[52:51] you can find that sister keys can you
[52:52] can you put that up there amen there in
[52:54] first Timothy I believe it is amen the
[52:57] fullness of God dwelt bodily in Jesus
[53:03] Christ amen so so now here is that now
[53:08] Jesus has went back and he is he is uh
[53:12] uh interceding for you and me he is
[53:15] preparing a place but the Bible says
[53:17] that the spirit that was in Jesus has
[53:20] now come back upon us and we that is
[53:23] called the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[53:25] it's this same God God living in
[53:29] different bodies it's not God in the
[53:32] body of Jesus walking on earth now now
[53:34] it's God in the body of you God in the
[53:36] body of me through the Holy Ghost so it
[53:39] is one
[53:41] God it was God in Christ reconciling the
[53:44] world to himself and then there in 1
[53:47] Corinthians amen 5 it says know ye not
[53:49] that you are the Temple of that almighty
[53:54] God hallelujah so what is God so God's
[53:57] not just simply wanting to be worshiped
[53:59] amen we can worship the Trinity and and
[54:01] we can do all of that and you're missing
[54:03] the whole thing that what God is doing
[54:05] it was it was God so missing his people
[54:08] God so missing his sons and daughters
[54:10] that he that he wanted to come he wanted
[54:12] to be a man he wanted to he wanted to
[54:14] feel like you he wanted he wanted to
[54:16] know your hardships so he come and lived
[54:19] Among Us in a human being which was the
[54:23] body of Jesus Christ he paid the price
[54:27] went to hell paid the price for your
[54:30] sins and has now went back to Heaven
[54:33] he's come Sent His holy spirit back upon
[54:35] you to bring you unto it what a
[54:37] beautiful plan for
[54:39] Redemption amen do you love him now but
[54:44] these wanted to make God dead or just a
[54:49] a fiction so now we have now am man
[54:52] they're introducing uh praying to idols
[54:55] and they're introducing all of the these
[54:56] things why am man CU they ain't got no
[54:58] the spirit of God in their lives you see
[55:00] what I'm saying I think we need the
[55:02] spirit of the Lord in us with everything
[55:04] that we have we should strive for the
[55:06] spirit of the Lord any questions as
[55:09] right now where we're
[55:10] at praise the
[55:13] Lord all right now let's let's go on
[55:18] um let's let's go on down space to
[55:21] repent Revelations 2: 21 I gave her
[55:24] space to repent of her for fornication
[55:27] and she repented not do you know that
[55:31] this church was actually more wicked
[55:33] than Ahab do you know that he repented
[55:35] for a while and walked softly before God
[55:38] you can't say that of the Roman Catholic
[55:40] Church no sir she has never repented she
[55:45] but has stubbornly destroyed any and all
[55:49] who tried to help her repent that is
[55:51] history now God kept raising up not only
[55:55] the messengers to age but he raised up
[55:57] other wonderful helpers for those uh
[55:59] Messengers he gave every age some
[56:02] wonderful men of God that did everything
[56:05] they could to bring the church back to
[56:07] God God certainly gave her an
[56:09] opportunity and helped to repent did she
[56:12] ever repent and show that she and show
[56:15] she did by our fruits no sir she never
[56:19] has and she never will she is drunk she
[56:22] has lost her senses in spiritual things
[56:25] now don't be confused and start thinking
[56:29] that the Church of Rome has repented of
[56:31] her Slaughter of the Saints because she
[56:34] has attempted to unite with the
[56:36] Protestants by making her Creeds to line
[56:38] up uh with the Protestant Creeds not
[56:41] once has she ever apologized and said
[56:44] she was wrong for her mass murders she
[56:47] won't either no matter how mellow and
[56:50] sweet she appears at this particular
[56:52] time she will yet raise up to kill for
[56:56] murder lies in her evil and unrepentant
[57:00] heart can you say Amen now it it was
[57:03] something that's that's that's lying in
[57:05] her now I I I want I I want to just stop
[57:09] for a moment here because um uh brother
[57:12] brandom dealt with this at length or
[57:15] took a half a page here on this she's
[57:17] never
[57:19] repented never
[57:22] repented and and it and and I think it's
[57:24] I think it's important because you know
[57:26] if you'd go back I think it's page uh
[57:30] 355 uh in if you were to turn back to
[57:32] 355 it's it's talking to our age here in
[57:36] in Leota this leosan
[57:39] age and I and it's uh one
[57:44] to3
[57:46] um he he he's he speaks out the holy
[57:49] spirit is speaking straight to the
[57:51] church about repentance it says be
[57:54] zalias and repent he says now this false
[57:57] church has Zeal make no mistake about
[58:00] that her Zeal has literally been that of
[58:04] the Jews John 2:17 the Zeal of thy house
[58:07] hath eaten me up but it is a wrong Zeal
[58:11] it is it is for the house of her their
[58:14] own building it is for their own Creeds
[58:18] dogmas organizations their own
[58:21] righteousness they have put the word out
[58:23] for their own ideas they have deposed
[58:26] the holy the Holy Ghost and made men
[58:28] into leaders they have uh put aside the
[58:32] eternal life as a person and make it
[58:36] good
[58:37] works or or even uh or uh Church
[58:41] Conformity rather than good works now I
[58:44] want you to catch that they have put
[58:45] aside eternal life as a
[58:49] person God is calling for another Zeal
[58:53] it is the Zeal to cry I am wrong wrong
[58:57] now who is going to say that he is wrong
[59:00] is it that all these denominations are
[59:02] based upon the claimed originality and
[59:05] that of God the claim that they are
[59:07] right now they all cannot be right in
[59:10] fact not one of them is right they are
[59:13] Whited seers full of dead men's bones
[59:17] they have no life they have no
[59:19] Vindication God has never made himself
[59:21] known in any organization they say they
[59:24] are right because they are the ones that
[59:26] are saying it but saying it doesn't make
[59:29] it so they need the Vindication the
[59:32] Vindicated thus saith the Lord of God
[59:34] and they don't have it now let me say
[59:37] this here I don't believe that God is
[59:39] calling only to the false Church to
[59:41] repent in this verse he is talking to
[59:45] his elect they have some repenting to do
[59:48] too many of his children are still in
[59:51] those false churches and they are those
[59:54] of whom it speaks of and in Ephesians
[59:57] 5:14 awake thou that sleepest and arise
[1:00:00] from the dead and Christ shall give thee
[1:00:03] light to be asleep is not to be dead
[1:00:06] these are sleeping amongst the dead they
[1:00:09] are out there in the dead denominations
[1:00:11] they are floating along with them but
[1:00:13] God cries wake up repent of your Folly
[1:00:17] here they are lending their influence
[1:00:20] giving their time and their money and
[1:00:22] actually their their lives to this
[1:00:25] Antichrist
[1:00:26] organizations and all the while thinking
[1:00:28] it is all right they need to repent they
[1:00:32] must repent they need to have a change
[1:00:35] of mind and turn toward truth yes this
[1:00:39] is the age that most needs to repent but
[1:00:42] will it will it bring back the word will
[1:00:47] it again enthrone the holy spirit in
[1:00:50] men's lives will it again rever Jesus as
[1:00:54] the only savior I say not for the next
[1:00:57] verse reveals the astounding and
[1:00:59] shocking truth of the close of this age
[1:01:03] can you say amen and so uh uh and then
[1:01:08] there was another one while we're while
[1:01:09] we're over here let's look here at 359
[1:01:11] and go all the way down to the last
[1:01:12] paragraph down there it says oh elect of
[1:01:16] God
[1:01:18] beware study
[1:01:20] closely be
[1:01:22] careful this is 359
[1:01:26] work out your salvation with fear and
[1:01:28] trembling rely upon God and be strong in
[1:01:32] his mind your adversary the devil is is
[1:01:36] even now going about like a roaring lion
[1:01:38] seeing seeking whom he may devour watch
[1:01:41] under prayer and be
[1:01:43] steadfast This is the End Time both the
[1:01:46] true and the false Vine are coming into
[1:01:49] maturity but before the wheat matures
[1:01:51] those rip and tears must be bound for
[1:01:53] the burning see they are all joining the
[1:01:56] World Council of churches and that is
[1:01:58] The Binding soon the garnering of the
[1:02:00] wheat will come but right now the two
[1:02:03] Spirits are at work in the two Vines
[1:02:06] come out from amongst the tears and
[1:02:08] start to overcome that you may be
[1:02:11] considered praiseworthy for your lord
[1:02:14] and fit to Reign and Rule with him can
[1:02:19] you say Amen so the there's there's
[1:02:22] going to be one thing that is that is
[1:02:25] that is going to
[1:02:28] identify amen the elect of God is the
[1:02:32] elect of God it's not that we weren't
[1:02:36] born in in in a body of Decay it wasn't
[1:02:40] that we were that that in other words it
[1:02:42] wasn't that we were born Christians it
[1:02:46] wasn't that we were born uh goody T
[1:02:49] shoes we were all
[1:02:52] Sinners but yet there is an eternal seed
[1:02:55] of God the Bible says that you were
[1:02:58] predestinated by God before the
[1:03:00] foundation of the
[1:03:02] world Amen not because of of your good
[1:03:06] not because of your evil amen there in
[1:03:09] there in Romans the 9th chapter deals
[1:03:11] with that that there that there is a the
[1:03:14] elect of God Amen God seen you God the
[1:03:18] Bible says there in in in Revelations 13
[1:03:21] that God put your name on his book
[1:03:26] before the world ever
[1:03:29] began and there's going to be a certain
[1:03:33] quality to the elect and that des and
[1:03:37] that is the desire to be right that's
[1:03:42] going to set you apart from everything
[1:03:45] else and that's not you demanding your
[1:03:48] rights it's it's you wanting to be right
[1:03:51] with God Amen every one of us what sets
[1:03:56] me apart from from from the religion out
[1:04:01] there is the reality that I am wrong in
[1:04:06] in myself there is nothing about me that
[1:04:09] I can rely
[1:04:11] on nothing about me that I can rely on I
[1:04:16] must rely upon him and when I do that
[1:04:21] and I come in the light of when I come
[1:04:23] and I see myself in the light of the
[1:04:25] that great that that great holy fire
[1:04:28] then it then it lets me know amen I I
[1:04:32] I've got a long ways to go and that I
[1:04:34] need to
[1:04:36] repent repentance is is is it's it's a
[1:04:40] quality that only the elect can do Cain
[1:04:44] could not do it the Serpent's children
[1:04:47] cannot do it amen but God has given you
[1:04:50] and me amen that special ingredient our
[1:04:54] desire I must be right and you know what
[1:05:00] for those of you for those of you that
[1:05:02] have that kind of a desire you know what
[1:05:04] that is sounding like that's like a that
[1:05:06] that's like your wife wanting to please
[1:05:08] you amen it's not like she's having to
[1:05:10] go around and say sorry all the time
[1:05:12] it's that her desire is to please you

[1:05:38] she's nothing without
[1:05:41] you in this world of feminism
[1:05:46] amen remember Ju Just remember when God
[1:05:49] created the the the mail baboon he took
[1:05:51] a piece of dirt and he made the mail
[1:05:53] baboon then he took another piece of
[1:05:55] dirt and he made the female baboon and
[1:05:57] then he came over here and picked up a
[1:05:59] piece of dirt and and and made the male
[1:06:02] giraffe and then he came over and
[1:06:03] grabbed another piece of dirt and made a
[1:06:05] female giraffe he he he when he wanted a
[1:06:08] dog he created took a little piece of
[1:06:10] dirt and and created the male dog took
[1:06:13] another piece of dirt created the female
[1:06:15] dog but when he created Eve he did not
[1:06:19] take another piece of Earth he put Adam
[1:06:22] to sleep and took out of Adam
[1:06:27] that rib and he created a help meet and
[1:06:31] then when Adam looks and says she is
[1:06:34] bone of my bone Flesh of My
[1:06:38] Flesh can you say Amen her name was
[1:06:43] Adam amen she wasn't given the name Eve
[1:06:46] until after uh after the first baby was
[1:06:49] born then amen she was called Eve she
[1:06:53] was the mother of all living right
[1:06:56] amen So Adam so it so is the Bride of
[1:07:00] Jesus Christ we came out of Christ when
[1:07:04] Jesus was hanging on Calvary amen and
[1:07:07] they they took the uh uh uh the the
[1:07:10] cruel Roman sword and they they they
[1:07:13] they they speared him and they crucified
[1:07:15] him and they put him in the ground

[1:07:29] on on the 120 there in the upper
[1:07:32] room what was it they were the Bride of

[1:07:37] desires they weren't made of another
[1:07:39] piece of dirt they came from God they

[1:08:02] those those girls are are they they're

[1:08:07] it's all why because God created the
[1:08:09] woman not out of a different piece of
[1:08:11] dirt he created the woman out of the man
[1:08:15] and the only way she's ever going to be

[1:09:09] amen in in in proving his word uh the
[1:09:13] prophet said he he said now if thou be
[1:09:15] the Son of God he always he's always
[1:09:18] doubted it and he still teaches others
[1:09:21] to doubt it he taught Eve to doubt it
[1:09:24] taught Moses he taught all them to try
[1:09:26] to doubt it he's teaching you to try to

[1:10:19] we look at the uh at this at this this
[1:10:24] this woman this church who claims to be
[1:10:30] the Queen of Heaven claims to be and yet
[1:10:34] her devotion is not to her Lord she
[1:10:39] claims she's his but she does everything
[1:10:43] she she and everything she does is is to
[1:10:46] tear down what he's already put here
[1:10:48] right do you understand that if you're
[1:10:51] going to be a Christian and if you're
[1:10:54] going to be the Bride of Jes Jesus
[1:10:56] Christ then it's
[1:10:58] you're why do you take on your husband's
[1:11:02] name Why do why does the why does the
[1:11:05] woman put the veil over her head and
[1:11:09] after the marriage the veil comes off
[1:11:13] and it used to they would take the woman
[1:11:15] would take that Veil off and then put it
[1:11:17] around the shoulders of her of her
[1:11:20] husband that that was that was a symbol
[1:11:24] that I am losing my identity I'm taking
[1:11:28] on your
[1:11:32] identity and just as I'm taking this
[1:11:34] Veil off and putting it around your
[1:11:36] shoulders I am your
[1:11:39] responsibility all right amen you just
[1:11:42] remember that amen I am your respon you

[1:11:59] love you serve you but I just want you
[1:12:02] to know amen that I'm all yours and God
[1:12:06] want to tell you right now Christ loves
[1:12:09] that Christ paid the price he took care
[1:12:11] of
[1:12:12] all of your debt all of your sin all of
[1:12:18] your wrongs Christ took it all and says
[1:12:22] I will take care of the debt I will pay
[1:12:26] it I just want you to be my
[1:12:30] bride then what right do you have Amen
[1:12:35] to to allow anything to come in
[1:12:40] between that sweetness of spirit in your
[1:12:45] heart can you see
[1:12:47] man uh brother brenon would say in in U
[1:12:50] you must be born again he said he says
[1:12:53] now as the prophet goes on speaking he
[1:12:56] says who can bring a clean thing out of
[1:12:58] a good out of an unclean not one and
[1:13:01] he's one Speaking That Old Testament
[1:13:03] scripture he says you stick your bucket
[1:13:06] down into the well and pull out a bucket
[1:13:08] of water and it's stagnant it stinks you
[1:13:11] look in it and it's muddy little worms
[1:13:14] is in the water there's no way at all to
[1:13:17] put your bucket back and get clean water
[1:13:21] the whole well is
[1:13:22] contaminated the whole soul mind and
[1:13:25] body of the man is contaminated with sin
[1:13:28] he's born in sin physically shapen in
[1:13:30] iniquity and comes to the world speaking
[1:13:33] lies that's his own soul is contaminated
[1:13:36] nothing good one cannot redeem the other
[1:13:39] because it's all wrong you can't take a
[1:13:42] bucket of water here that's contaminated
[1:13:44] and another bucket of water that's
[1:13:45] contaminated and mix them together you
[1:13:48] got more contamination there's no
[1:13:50] purification to it but God determined to
[1:13:54] save men can I hear an amen he placed
[1:13:57] upon him the iniquity of us all the
[1:14:00] penalty of sin and when you're that when
[1:14:04] that you were born in the penalty of sin
[1:14:06] is death sin is death the penalty was so
[1:14:09] great that there's none of us could ever
[1:14:11] help the other there's so there's there
[1:14:14] had to be someone who could pay this
[1:14:15] penalty what if this morning the penalty
[1:14:18] to leave this room was hundred billion
[1:14:20] and there's none of us that could leave
[1:14:22] because there's none of us uh uh worth
[1:14:25] that but then if one come in who was
[1:14:28] worth enough to pay it all for us it
[1:14:30] takes one we can't do it it took the one
[1:14:35] who was worthy oh how I wish I could
[1:14:37] stop here for a while and go back and
[1:14:39] pick up Ruth and Naomi and show how the
[1:14:42] kinsman redeemer to the redeem Fallen
[1:14:44] estate had to be first worthy had to be
[1:14:47] a Kinsman therefore God the spirit
[1:14:50] Jehovah became Kinfolk To Us by taking
[1:14:53] on the form of Flesh he he become kin
[1:14:55] folk had to be that then he had to and
[1:14:59] then he had to be worthy he is the one
[1:15:01] who produced the fountain filled with

[1:17:41] bits in horses' mouth and they obey us
[1:17:43] and we turn about their whole body it

[1:18:23] and they and have been tamed of mankind
[1:18:25] but the tongue can no man tame it's an
[1:18:28] unruly evil full of deadly poison there
[1:18:31] therewith we bless God even the father
[1:18:33] and therewith we curse men which are
[1:18:35] made after the similitude of God out of
[1:18:38] the same mouth proceedeth blessing and
[1:18:40] cursing my brethren these things ought
[1:18:42] not so to be do a fountain send forth at
[1:18:46] the same place Sweetwater and
[1:18:48] bitter who is wise and endued with
[1:18:51] knowledge among you let him show out of
[1:18:53] a good lifestyle conversation lifestyle
[1:18:56] his works with meekness of
[1:18:59] wisdom if ye have bitter envying and
[1:19:03] strife in your hearts Glory not and lie
[1:19:05] not against the truth this wisdom
[1:19:07] descendeth not from above but is Earthly
[1:19:11] cenal
[1:19:13] devilish where envy and strife is there
[1:19:16] is confusion and every evil work but the
[1:19:19] wisdom which comes from above is is is
[1:19:21] first pure then Peaceable uh peaceful
[1:19:25] gentle easy to be treated uh full of
[1:19:28] Mercy good fruits without partiality
[1:19:30] without hypocrisy for the root of
[1:19:33] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[1:19:35] that make peace and whence comes Wars
[1:19:39] and fightings among you they uh come
[1:19:42] they not hints even of your own lust
[1:19:44] that war in your members oh that's okay
[1:19:48] amen and so uh uh so we we we can see
[1:19:55] that that artisian well in the soul is
[1:19:59] so important now the church
[1:20:02] system is trying to take care of this
[1:20:06] Spirit man and this body without the
[1:20:09] conversion of the
[1:20:11] Soul so they're doing it they're they've
[1:20:14] got their programs they have
[1:20:17] substituted The Living artisian Well the
[1:20:21] spirit of God that requires a man to
[1:20:24] walk close with
[1:20:26] God do you see that so so we as a as
[1:20:30] Believers tonight we don't want to be
[1:20:34] amen don't don't do not be satisfied
[1:20:39] coming to church and thinking this is
[1:20:42] all there is to it and not having a
[1:20:44] relationship with Jesus Christ a
[1:20:48] relationship in on a daily basis is
[1:20:51] important you are the bride of Jesus
[1:20:56] Christ the Antichrist Spirit has taken
[1:20:59] the relationship away and has put it on
[1:21:05] works well I do this and I do that and I
[1:21:08] do this and I do that and so I'm a
[1:21:10] Christian you're only a Christian you're
[1:21:13] only the bride as you are walking with
[1:21:17] Jesus
[1:21:19] Christ so that Christ that is living on
[1:21:22] the see they substitute Ed you you have
[1:21:26] substituted the the Fountain of Living
[1:21:28] Water and you have hued to yourself
[1:21:31] these sisters and that's what those
[1:21:34] that's what the church has done music
[1:21:38] light
[1:21:39] shows programs all of this thing is
[1:21:43] taking away from God and they think
[1:21:46] they're married to
[1:21:50] Jesus when Jesus is wanting to be made
[1:21:53] flesh in you and the only way he can be
[1:21:56] made flesh in you is for you to
[1:21:58] surrender your life to him and the only
[1:22:00] way you can Surrender Your Life to him
[1:22:02] is in know is is an act of repentance
[1:22:05] and a crying out I'm wrong I need you

[1:22:11] spirit I need you I want your presence

[1:23:21] that's going to be those that want to

[1:23:30] some strong winds out there folks
[1:23:51] amen yeah
[1:24:13] yeah I I love I there there's one thing
[1:24:16] that that
[1:24:18] that comforts
[1:24:21] me and and and and and it will give into
[1:24:24] it this next this next uh Wednesday
[1:24:29] night and and that
[1:24:32] is I the the uh uh God knows them that
[1:24:37] are his and he will not lose the
[1:24:41] one and the one that that has that has
[1:24:45] orchestrated your life and has brought
[1:24:48] you through the course your course that
[1:24:50] wasn't you you're not smart enough to do
[1:24:53] it
[1:24:55] it was the hand of the almighty God
[1:24:57] that's and all of God's sheep are going
[1:25:00] to hear his
[1:25:02] voice it's not important that they hear
[1:25:04] my voice it's not important that
[1:25:08] they hear your voice unless the Lord is
[1:25:10] dealing with you to share it with them
[1:25:13] and and that's where I think that we
[1:25:14] need to be really sensitive to the Lord
[1:25:16] say Lord let my life be such a
[1:25:20] reflection that the guys on the job
[1:25:24] they're they're going to see Jesus in
[1:25:27] me amen I I think and I I I think a lot
[1:25:30] of you guys all work work together there
[1:25:32] with brother Michael and them and what a
[1:25:34] blessing yall are what a blessing yall
[1:25:37] have to be able to Believers to work
[1:25:41] together I'm going to tell you the
[1:25:45] the construction this construction field
[1:25:47] is can can be some of the most vulgar
[1:25:50] guys working in that you know and you
[1:25:53] all are blessed to be able to to
[1:25:55] fellowship with one another on those
[1:25:59] basis but whether you have a brother
[1:26:01] sitting beside you or whether you don't
[1:26:02] whether you have a sister that's with
[1:26:04] you or whether you
[1:26:05] don't we want we want we want the spirit
[1:26:09] of the
[1:26:09] Lord to flow through me and operate
[1:26:12] through me and love through me and
[1:26:15] correct me when I'm wrong and lift me up
[1:26:18] help me to overcome where I need to
[1:26:20] overcome
[1:26:22] amen and if the and and I I every elect
[1:26:26] is going to have that
[1:26:27] desire and if they've got that
[1:26:40] Des I don't think I don't think anything
[1:26:42] of our past is ever in
[1:26:44] vain I think God allows us to go through
[1:26:47] those things so that when we come into a
[1:26:50] a a more clear path with him that we'll
[1:26:54] love love him even that much the more I
[1:26:56] thank God for those things I I thank God
[1:26:59] that he allowed me to go through things
[1:27:01] in my life because I and I and I'm and I
[1:27:04] going to tell you why because it's
[1:27:05] created and and when I look back and I
[1:27:08] see what he has done for
[1:27:12] me I got more of an intense desire to
[1:27:15] please him today than I've ever
[1:27:17] had I want to please the
[1:27:22] Lord I want to be
[1:27:25] right I want my heart to be right I want
[1:27:28] I want to preach right I want to I want

[1:27:42] waned me and placed me here on Earth to
[1:27:44] do I want everything to please
