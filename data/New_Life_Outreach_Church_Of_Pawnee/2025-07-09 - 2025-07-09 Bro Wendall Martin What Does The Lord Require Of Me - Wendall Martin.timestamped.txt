[32:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's great to be here. Um,
[32:07] this is a must stop for us. If I didn't,
[32:10] &gt;&gt; I'd be in trouble with with the family,
[32:13] but no, we always enjoy fellowshipping
[32:16] with you guys here.
[32:29] As I look back down the pathway up the
[32:32] mountain, I'd have tried weary warm and
[32:36] feed a little sore.
[32:39] Thought by now I'd be much further up
[32:42] the road than where I am. I've cast
[32:44] aside some weight. I must do so much
[32:47] more.
[32:49] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[32:52] precious time.
[32:55] Besetting wait with haste. I will
[32:57] swiftly cast aside.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[33:05] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[33:09] home.
[33:10] [Music]
[33:14] Oft
[33:17] [Music]
[33:19] gaze across the valley of decision where
[33:22] I was and thank the Lord he led me from
[33:26] that place.
[33:29] The heights I've gained are greater than
[33:32] were all my yesterdays. But I must press
[33:35] on to see my Savior's face.
[33:39] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[33:42] precious time.
[33:45] Setting weight with haste. I will
[33:47] swiftly cast aside.
[33:51] No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[33:59] home.
[34:00] [Music]
[34:12] When I reach those gates of glory, only
[34:16] then will I take rest. But the first
[34:19] thing I will do when I get home.
[34:22] I'll crawl up to my Jesus and I'll weep
[34:26] down at his feet. My source of joy, the
[34:30] savior of my soul.
[34:35] Oh, there's no time to waste. My
[34:37] fleeting precious time
[34:41] setting away with haste. I will swiftly
[34:44] cast aside.
[34:47] No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[34:52] I can hardly wait. I'm almost home.
[34:56] Oh, there's no time to waste my fleeting
[34:59] precious time.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; He's setting way with haze. I will
[35:05] swiftly cast aside.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[35:13] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[35:16] home.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[35:24] home.

[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lift up your heads then. Your
[36:12] redemption drawth nigh. Amen.
[36:15] Looking forward to it. Aren't you not
[36:18] dreading it? Amen. I'm excited. Amen.
[36:23] Amen. For the dead in Christ shall rise
[36:26] first, and we which are alive and remain
[36:28] shall be caught up together with them.
[36:29] Meet the Lord in the air. So shall we
[36:32] ever be with the Lord. Amen. So let's
[36:35] let him talk to us this morning. Amen.
[36:37] Reassure us. Give us hope. Amen. More
[36:40] faith. Amen. Rapturing faith. Amen. As
[36:44] we stand in awe of him this morning.
[36:47] Could we st sing that? Amen. My hope is
[36:49] in the Lord.
[36:51] I stand in all within the presence of
[36:57] the Lord.
[37:00] In whom the wisdom of the aes
[37:06] lie.
[37:09] Whom the raging of the seas
[37:14] subside.
[37:17] A living sacrifice.
[37:21] My only source
[37:24] of life.
[37:26] My hope
[37:28] [Music]
[37:29] is in the Lord.
[37:33] From this time on
[37:37] forever more.
[37:46] is in the Lord
[37:49] forever

[37:54] man of God comes,
[37:57] his tender mercies come with every
[38:02] rising sun
[38:05] to reach the sinner in his brokenness.
[38:13] He offered healing and forgiveness.
[38:21] And those who trust in him
[38:25] will find their hearts
[38:28] and rest.
[38:30] My hope
[38:33] is in the Lord.

[40:09] forever more.

[40:46] is in the Lord
[40:50] forever
[40:52] more.
[40:54] Oh,

[41:36] Praise the Lord.
[41:38] Isn't he wonderful?
[41:41] And he truly is worthy
[41:44] of all of the hallelujah and all of the
[41:48] honor that we can give him.
[41:52] He's been so precious to every one of
[41:54] us.
[41:55] Given us health,
[41:58] given us
[42:00] the ability to
[42:03] love him, sing to him,
[42:07] worship him. I tell you, I think he
[42:10] deserves our everything. Don't you think
[42:12] so?
[42:15] Amen.
[42:20] Well, it's good to be here this morning
[42:22] in the house of the Lord and uh good to
[42:26] see all of our of our visitors. Amen.
[42:29] The whole Curtis clan. Amen. Hallelujah.

[42:52] but we've got they they left some
[42:54] fiddles behind and and things and I you
[42:57] know they they should have just came on
[42:59] up and played their fiddles and all of
[43:01] that as well. But uh we sure enjoyed uh
[43:05] their song and enjoyed enjoyed these
[43:09] Sister Mary and her children's song this
[43:11] morning. It was wonderful.
[43:16] And uh we always love sister Tithus
[43:19] singing. Amen.
[43:21] And so just wonderful.
[43:25] Well, brother Merl has already went
[43:27] through all of our visitors here, so I'm
[43:29] not going to go through all that again,
[43:31] but it is good to see everyone that is
[43:33] here today. And uh while you're
[43:35] standing, we'd like to look here in the
[43:38] book of uh Micah, the sixth chapter.
[43:43] And uh and I tell you what, I still
[43:46] don't have any any monitors on my on my
[43:49] ear. I had the Doro real good and loud,
[43:53] but no. Uh I
[43:55] &gt;&gt; No, no, that's good. I enjoyed it. I had
[43:57] my own concert. Amen. And uh uh so
[44:04] I I don't know. A Oh, it may be coming
[44:06] in. Did you?
[44:09] Hallelujah. There. where I'm getting a
[44:11] little bit. Amen. Just a tad more would
[44:14] be awesome.
[44:15] Amen. All right. Uh Micah 6 and6 says,
[44:19] "There wherewith
[44:23] shall I come before the Lord and bow
[44:26] myself before the high God?
[44:30] Shall I come before him with burnt
[44:32] offerings, with calves of a year old?
[44:37] Will the Lord be pleased with thousands
[44:40] of rams and with 10 thousands of rivers
[44:43] of oil?
[44:45] Shall I give my firstborn for my
[44:47] transgression, the fruit of my body for
[44:50] the sin of my soul?
[44:52] He hath shown thee, oh man, what is
[44:55] good.
[44:57] What do the Lord require of thee, but to
[45:00] do justly,
[45:02] to love mercy,
[45:04] and walk humbly with thy God?
[45:08] I want to minister this morning, what
[45:11] does the Lord require of me? Let's go to
[45:15] the Lord in prayer.
[45:17] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for your
[45:21] many blessings and the anointing that we
[45:24] feel here this morning. And Lord, we
[45:28] count it a privilege to be able to come
[45:31] and to lift up our voices in our hands
[45:34] and sing praises to you and give love to
[45:40] you, Father.
[45:42] And Lord, we it means so much to every
[45:45] one of us to know that you are here.
[45:49] And Lord Jesus, as we quieten our
[45:51] spirits now and and settle down for you
[45:56] to speak to us, we ask Lord that you
[45:59] would speak directly to every one of our
[46:02] hearts. Lord, that you would meet every
[46:05] need that is present.
[46:07] Father, we're so thankful for all that
[46:09] you are and all that you will always be.
[46:14] And Lord, we give ourselves to you just
[46:16] now. If there be any that is sickly and
[46:20] or not feeling well this morning, I pray
[46:23] that you'll help them and strengthen
[46:26] them and heal them, Father. And we'll
[46:29] give you glory and honor in the name of
[46:32] the Lord Jesus. Can the church say amen?
[46:37] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be
[46:41] seated here this morning.
[46:44] We
[46:46] as I was thinking throughout the week um
[46:51] these last well several weeks I've I
[46:55] think the the last Sunday we we
[46:58] ministered on a full surrender to God's
[47:00] call
[47:02] and
[47:03] we Wednesday night I ministered on
[47:07] desperation
[47:09] desperation for the living God the God
[47:12] of the Bible
[47:14] And then today I my my thought is what
[47:17] does God require of me?
[47:21] We don't know exactly when the Lord is
[47:23] coming but each of us have gifts and
[47:27] callings in our lives. We we are amen uh
[47:32] we have been placed here on the earth by
[47:35] predestination.
[47:37] God had a purpose for you being here.
[47:40] You're not here by accident. Amen. The
[47:44] Bible says before your members were even
[47:46] formed, your your body was even formed,
[47:50] every member was already written in his
[47:52] book of remembrance.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; So he knows that you were to be here.
[47:57] He's ordained for you to be here.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; He brought your grandma and grandpa
[48:02] together, your mama and your daddy. He
[48:04] brought all he he worked this whole
[48:06] thing to bring you here today because
[48:09] God's got a purpose for you in this
[48:12] life.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Each of us have been given gifts.
[48:16] This the the the I'm not the only one
[48:19] with a gift here this morning. The
[48:21] musicians are not the only one with with
[48:24] gifts. We've all got gifts and and we
[48:27] all amen are duty bound to surrender our
[48:30] gifts unto the Lord. And I will say that
[48:34] we will even be held accountable for
[48:36] those gifts that God has given us. Last
[48:40] week we talked about the rich young
[48:42] ruler and amen that couldn't quite amen
[48:46] heed the master's call because of his
[48:49] riches when he had come and asked Jesus
[48:52] what what can I do to inherit eternal
[48:54] life and he said amen well and he keep
[48:58] the commandments and he went through
[48:59] these things and he says I've done this
[49:02] from my youth amen I I've kept the
[49:05] commandments but then he he said there's
[49:07] one thing that you lack back. Amen. You
[49:10] you you've put your stock on your riches
[49:13] and he says, "Go sell all that you've
[49:14] got and follow me." Well, amen. When
[49:19] when when Jesus asked of that, he was
[49:21] very sad. And he turned around, Amen.
[49:25] and walked away. We find that later on
[49:28] in in Luke the 12th chapter that that
[49:31] this rich young ruler become more
[49:34] wealthy. He tore down old barns and
[49:36] built bigger ones. And but there come a
[49:39] time that God said, "Thou fool, this
[49:42] night thy soul shall be required of
[49:45] thee." And then Jesus would sum it up
[49:48] and he would say, "Amen." So he that
[49:51] layeth up treasure for himself is not
[49:55] rich toward God. So So you can have
[49:59] everything put together in this natural
[50:02] world. You can be a banker. You can be a
[50:06] a electrical contractor. You can be a
[50:09] Amen. You you can have a lot of things
[50:12] put together. But if we have not
[50:14] fulfilled the purpose, Amen. that which
[50:18] God desires of us to be, Amen. then then
[50:22] it profits us nothing. And Jesus would
[50:26] go on to say, Amen. After this parable,
[50:29] he says, "Take no thought of what you
[50:31] will wear or eat or drink. For your
[50:34] father in heaven cares um takes care of
[50:38] the lily and the sparrow, and he'll take
[50:41] care of you." Can I hear an amen?
[50:44] Jesus would sum it up, amen, at the end
[50:47] of this chapter. And he would say, "But
[50:48] rather seek ye the kingdom of God and
[50:52] his righteousness and all of these other
[50:56] things will be added unto you." And then
[50:59] he says there in that 32nd verse, he
[51:01] says, "Fear not, little flock. It is
[51:04] your father's good pleasure to give you
[51:08] the kingdom."
[51:10] It's the father's good pleasure to give
[51:13] you the kingdom. Now he is going through
[51:16] this. This man who lost it all. Amen.
[51:20] Because he failed to surrender
[51:22] everything to God. Amen. And now his
[51:25] soul is required of him. And then he
[51:28] turns to the elect, those who seek first
[51:31] the kingdom of God and his
[51:34] righteousness. And he says, "I will be a
[51:37] god to you.
[51:39] I will be one that clothe you and feeds
[51:43] you. Well, praise the name of the Lord.
[51:46] Amen. When he says it's the father's
[51:47] good pleasure to give you the kingdom,
[51:50] that word kingdom is is is royalty. It's
[51:53] kingship. It's dominion. It means rule.
[51:57] Amen. Not to be confused with an actual
[51:59] kingdom, but rather the right or the
[52:02] authority to rule in God's kingdom. So
[52:06] God's desire, Amen. God's purpose for
[52:10] calling each of us is to rule and reign
[52:14] in the kingdom of God. Many people think
[52:16] the kingdom of God is when we get on the
[52:18] other side. But the kingdom of God is in
[52:21] you through the baptism of the Holy
[52:23] Ghost.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Every one of you who has received the
[52:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost, Amen, that is
[52:29] the power or the spirit of God within
[52:32] you. and he has deputized you, amen, to
[52:36] rule and reign in the kingdom of God.
[52:38] Well, praise the Lord. There's no
[52:40] beggars in the kingdom of God. Amen.
[52:42] There's no there's no wannabes in the
[52:44] kingdom of God. When you surrender
[52:46] everything to the kingdom of God, when
[52:49] you surrender your life to Christ, you
[52:52] come under the headship of that word.
[52:55] Amen. You have just taken on an
[52:59] authority through his spirit.
[53:02] Hallelujah. Can you say amen? It's the
[53:05] father's good pleasure. In other words,
[53:06] amen. It's the delight. It's the deep
[53:09] and earnest sincere desire. It's my joy.
[53:13] It's my heartbeat. It's my it's it's my
[53:16] very pleasure to give you the kingdom.
[53:20] Oh, glory to God. Amen. To give you the
[53:23] authority, the right to reign. Amen.
[53:26] I've called you for this purpose. I've
[53:29] ordained you to cast out devils, lay
[53:32] hands upon the sick. I've called you,
[53:35] Amen, to further my kingdom. That's
[53:38] that's what I have called you for. I've
[53:41] not called you just to raise families.
[53:43] I've not called you just to work on
[53:45] jobs. I've not called you uh uh just to
[53:47] Amen. go through this natural life. But
[53:50] I have called you, placed you, ordained
[53:53] you to further my kingdom.
[53:58] What does the Lord require of me? I
[54:00] think kingdom being kingdom- minded is
[54:04] better than things. Amen. Which would be
[54:08] best, things or the kingdom? You can
[54:11] have things and not have kingdom. But
[54:13] you cannot have the kingdom without the
[54:16] provisions provided while in the king's
[54:18] presence and the king's service. Can you
[54:21] say amen?
[54:22] Jesus would also say, "Where your
[54:25] treasure is, there will your heart be
[54:28] also your treasure." Amen. Your
[54:32] treasure, your your your valuables,
[54:34] those precious things that you hold dear
[54:37] to your heart. Many today are so
[54:40] material oriented and they forgot their
[54:43] call. I I know many preachers mind
[54:47] because they because being a a preacher
[54:50] is can can be it's not it's not as uh
[54:54] glamorous as what uh the church world
[54:56] has tried to make it to be and they'll
[54:58] they'll become a they'll become a you
[55:01] know car salesman or they'll they'll get
[55:03] into business and amen because of the
[55:06] gift that they have in their lives and
[55:09] they can succeed but yet that and yet
[55:12] not fulfill their purpose.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; But you see, God's not wanting us to be
[55:18] material oriented. There's many there
[55:21] there's many listen when preachers
[55:24] surrender their gift to the carnal
[55:26] things of the world, then the then the
[55:29] church or the world is going to suffer
[55:31] because of it. When the church, amen,
[55:35] surrenders their lives to the carnal
[55:38] things of the world, then the world that
[55:40] the the kingdom of God will suffer
[55:44] because of it because God has placed
[55:46] gifts and callings within each of our
[55:50] lives. Amen. What is our purpose? Well,
[55:53] first of all, the purpose, amen, that
[55:55] Jesus came was for redemption. Amen. To
[55:58] go back where we came from. Can you say
[56:01] amen? So what is my purpose? My my
[56:04] purpose should be oozing redemption.
[56:06] Jesus gave his life. He sacrificed
[56:10] everything so that he could bring his
[56:13] sons and daughters back to their
[56:15] position. And I think the church should
[56:18] be kingdom- minded. Amen. Kingdom minded
[56:21] is God. Your purpose is my purpose. Your
[56:24] desire is my desire. Well, praise the
[56:27] name of the Lord. Amen. I am an
[56:29] ambassador and I represent the kingdom.
[56:32] Amen. That I have come from and bring as
[56:35] many in. Can you say amen? In
[56:38] consideration of this final age, we
[56:40] understand that the two seeds have come
[56:42] into the climax. Jesus gave us the
[56:44] parable of the two seeds that would be
[56:46] sown into the world. Amen. The good seed
[56:49] was sown in by the son of man. Amen.
[56:51] Jesus would later on say that was the
[56:53] word that he sown into the world. And
[56:56] then the bad. Amen. Here come the evil
[56:59] one, Satan. Amen. Coming in and sewing
[57:01] his seeds. And then we've we have seen
[57:04] that it has come. The two seeds have
[57:06] been growing. They've been maturing. But
[57:09] we know that we there must come a
[57:11] harvest time. And we are at the
[57:14] rapturing of the church. This will be
[57:16] this. Bible says that he's going to
[57:18] gather all the tears up, gather them for
[57:21] burning. And then he's also going to
[57:23] gather the wheat, you and me, into his
[57:26] great garner. He's going to take us home
[57:28] in the rapture. I think it's something
[57:30] to be rejoicing about. I I I think. Can
[57:33] you say amen? We are in this final age.
[57:36] These two seeds have come into maturity.
[57:39] The Antichrist church and the bride.
[57:42] We're we're we're here at the climax.
[57:46] And I want to say there is not a greater
[57:49] time than the time that you are living
[57:51] in right now to serve God and give him
[57:55] your everything.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; What would the Lord require of me? With
[58:01] the mysteries being unveiled and the
[58:02] symbols interpreted,
[58:04] the open book is available to the sons
[58:08] of God.
[58:09] Surely there are responsibilities that
[58:12] would come with it. Amen. Now, the
[58:16] opening of the seals is not a new form
[58:18] of legalism, earning God's acceptance.
[58:22] God's not interested in what? Amen. In
[58:25] in in legalism, God is interested in a
[58:29] surrendered heart unto him in this hour
[58:32] that we're living in.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Think about the day that we're living
[58:38] in.
[58:40] The preciseness and the accuracy of
[58:42] prophecy.
[58:44] And here we stand with the word of God
[58:47] being being uh uh uh interpreted right
[58:52] before our eyes by manifestation.
[58:56] Look at Israel. Look at Russia. Look at
[58:59] these things in the scripture where
[59:01] we're standing right at we are at the
[59:04] the the cusp of the coming of the Lord
[59:08] Jesus Christ. We are at we are at the
[59:11] the the brink of of of leaving this
[59:15] world into that immortal world. It's
[59:19] something that we have preached about.
[59:21] It's something we have sung about. It is
[59:23] something we have dreamed about. It is
[59:24] something that we have longed for. And
[59:27] we are there on the cusp of entering in
[59:30] to that land of eternal life.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; We're there at that place. Can you say
[59:36] amen? Amen. I What what is God requiring
[59:41] of me today? Amen. What would God
[59:43] require as we as we read there in in in
[59:47] in there in Micah where where he's
[59:50] asking would would he be pleased with
[59:52] burnt offerings and thousands of rams or
[59:55] 10 thousands of rivers of oil. And he
[59:57] says, "Oh, what does the Lord require of
[1:00:00] thee?" Amen. But to do justly and to
[1:00:02] love mercy and to walk in humility
[1:00:05] before your God. Amen. In other words,
[1:00:08] amen, the requirement that God is asking
[1:00:11] is all of you. Amen. He is asking you to
[1:00:15] surrender everything you've got so that
[1:00:18] he can finish his purpose that he has
[1:00:21] placed you here on this earth for. Oh,
[1:00:24] now listen. Don't let that leave you
[1:00:26] here today. Amen. I I dare say that
[1:00:29] we've got some preachers that are
[1:00:31] sitting in here that has never preached
[1:00:33] a sermon. I dare say that there are
[1:00:35] gifts in this church right now that the
[1:00:38] that God has placed you here for. Amen.
[1:00:41] That is still got to come to its fusion.
[1:00:43] And it's still going to require just as
[1:00:46] every prophet of old. It still requires
[1:00:49] every one of us to say, "Amen, woe is
[1:00:52] me. I am a man of unclean lips."
[1:00:55] But God, if you will sanctify me and if
[1:00:59] you will give me, then I will go for
[1:01:03] your kingdom.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; A surrendered life.
[1:01:08] It was a surrender
[1:01:10] there in as Isaiah.
[1:01:14] Amen. He the great prophet Isaiah when
[1:01:17] he was a young man, he had amen sort of
[1:01:21] taken he was taken under the wing by by
[1:01:24] the king of Judah Uzziah.
[1:01:28] And Uzziah loved him. And amen Isaiah
[1:01:32] was a good man. And he stayed in the
[1:01:35] palace with the king. And but one time,
[1:01:39] amen, there come a time where Uzziah
[1:01:43] uh he he he got lifted up in his heart
[1:01:46] and and and uh had sinned against God,
[1:01:49] done the things of the priest and and
[1:01:51] and he was struck with leprosy and and
[1:01:54] and Uzziah died. And now here is Isaiah
[1:01:58] who had looked to this great man, this
[1:02:01] great king of great wealth and character
[1:02:04] and status. And he's looking at him and
[1:02:07] he's gone. And the Bible says that
[1:02:10] Isaiah walked into the temple. And when
[1:02:13] he walked into the temple, he said the
[1:02:16] glory of the Lord came down inside the
[1:02:20] temple. And he saw the glory of the Lord
[1:02:23] fill the whole place. And and as he as
[1:02:28] he was there in the presence of God,
[1:02:31] amen, the seraraphims were there. And he
[1:02:33] talks about the glory of the Lord. But
[1:02:35] there was the question that was asked,
[1:02:38] who will the Lord send? Who will the
[1:02:42] Lord anoint? Amen. Isaiah in the
[1:02:46] presence of of this great God. He says,
[1:02:51] "I and my people are are are people of
[1:02:55] unclean lips. I come from sin. I there's
[1:02:59] nothing that I can offer." Hallelujah. I
[1:03:03] I cannot go. But then the Bible says one
[1:03:07] of the saraphims took the coal from off
[1:03:10] the altar and he took the coal and he
[1:03:13] touched his lips. Amen. And says, "You
[1:03:16] are now cleansed." And what was the next
[1:03:19] thing that Isaiah would say? Isaiah
[1:03:22] would stand and say, "Lo, here am I.
[1:03:26] Send me.
[1:03:29] Here am I." You see the difference was
[1:03:32] he he he he he had seen the fickleness
[1:03:36] of man. He had seen the great king fall.
[1:03:39] He knew in himself that he was not great
[1:03:42] at all. But when God comes in and gives
[1:03:46] a call that it is required of a man to
[1:03:49] answer that call and say, "Lo, send me."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Now not all of us are preachers.
[1:03:59] Not all of us can evangelize the world.
[1:04:02] Not all of us can play a music musical
[1:04:06] instrument. But yet, God has called
[1:04:10] every one of you for a divine purpose.
[1:04:15] You say, "Well, I'm too poor. I'm too
[1:04:18] old." Amen. I I don't have enough of an
[1:04:21] education. All God is looking for is not
[1:04:25] what you can present. He don't want your
[1:04:27] education.
[1:04:29] He doesn't want your wealth. He doesn't
[1:04:31] want what you He wants a surrendered
[1:04:34] heart,
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; a surrendered life to him that he can
[1:04:37] use for his glory.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. What is God looking for?
[1:04:45] Amen. He's looking for that humility.
[1:04:47] The prophet would say, "Brother, if you
[1:04:49] amount to anything, you've got to love
[1:04:52] God better than your wife, than your
[1:04:55] husband, better than your children,
[1:04:56] better than your pastor." Yeah. Anything
[1:04:59] that there is, you've got to love God
[1:05:02] first. God gets the first place.
[1:05:06] Can you say amen? But we give him about
[1:05:09] the 10th place, but he deserves the best
[1:05:12] we've got. Can you say amen? Now, I know
[1:05:16] this is a different message here this
[1:05:17] morning and and and I I I I as I have
[1:05:21] labored in the spirit over these this
[1:05:24] last week and asking God what he would
[1:05:26] want us to say, it it seems like my
[1:05:29] heart has has has been has has been uh
[1:05:32] uh uh uh just wounding up within me
[1:05:35] because I I I want God to be pleased
[1:05:38] with me. I want God to be pleased with
[1:05:41] our church. I want to be that that God
[1:05:44] has ordained me to be.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, the carnal intellectual
[1:05:52] church will unwittingly become totally
[1:05:55] sold out to the antichrist. Now, we know
[1:05:57] that there in the book of Revelations,
[1:05:59] amen, that the whole world is going to
[1:06:01] follow after that that council of
[1:06:04] churches. They're going to follow after
[1:06:06] that beast system. Amen. It is all
[1:06:09] through the book of Revelations. It has
[1:06:10] plainly been declared and we see it
[1:06:13] coming to pass. Rome is beginning to
[1:06:16] take her place again.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that these things are
[1:06:21] there. Amen. And the church because she
[1:06:26] has just been on cruise control, has
[1:06:29] just sort of gulped everything in that
[1:06:31] that that is that's not even in
[1:06:33] scripture. Amen. Gulped it all in as if
[1:06:36] it's of God. But I want to tell you
[1:06:38] little bride, God's put you here for a
[1:06:41] purpose. And if you'll surrender
[1:06:43] everything that you've got, the book of
[1:06:45] Acts will come to living. Amen. Kodak h
[1:06:49] a living color right here in Lelaya if
[1:06:53] he can find some surrendered hearts.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. The church world
[1:06:59] is taking on that spirit and amen. And
[1:07:02] she'll give birth. The scripture says
[1:07:05] there in there in 2 Thessalonians 2.
[1:07:08] Amen. That there will come a time where
[1:07:10] the man of sin will stand up.
[1:07:14] Amen. And and and they will he will take
[1:07:17] dominion or he'll Amen. He'll stand up
[1:07:20] in the place of Christ. But brother,
[1:07:23] there is a church that is going to walk
[1:07:25] with God. Hallelujah. Someone asked me
[1:07:28] the other day, can we still expect
[1:07:30] miracles and healings? I said, "Brother,
[1:07:33] the church should better be living in
[1:07:35] miracles and healings."
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; You You say, "Well, Brother Wendle, we
[1:07:39] don't seek after signs." We do not seek
[1:07:41] after signs. It's the signs that are
[1:07:44] supposed to follow the believer, not the
[1:07:46] believer following the signs. You get
[1:07:49] somebody that is believing the word of
[1:07:50] God, then you're going to see the
[1:07:52] supernatural that'll come in and
[1:07:54] manifest itself. Well, can you say amen?
[1:07:57] Amen. just recently uh uh there with her
[1:08:00] wi-i with with with with our our sister
[1:08:02] Denise. Amen. There she had and and we
[1:08:05] you know with her uh uh her uh um uh
[1:08:07] pancreas and the pancreatitis and Amen.
[1:08:10] They were giving her the enzymes and and
[1:08:12] and and you know how sickly that she's
[1:08:15] been and how that it's been just so so
[1:08:17] rough on her. Amen. And having to give
[1:08:19] her the shots. But you see, when the
[1:08:22] anointing come down during that service,
[1:08:25] she was not even she didn't have someone
[1:08:27] lay the hands upon her, she was in the
[1:08:30] back holding a baby so someone else
[1:08:32] could go through the prayer line. Amen.
[1:08:36] She come talking to me and she says,
[1:08:37] "Now, Brother Win, I know you're
[1:08:39] probably upset with me, amen, for not
[1:08:41] going in through that prayer line, but I
[1:08:43] I I I just felt that I needed to hold
[1:08:45] this baby." But she said, "I want you to
[1:08:47] know that I felt the presence of God in
[1:08:49] the back right there where I was at."
[1:08:51] Amen. She went back to the doctor for
[1:08:54] her shots. And the doctor says her
[1:08:56] pancreas is now working perfectly. It's
[1:08:59] been working perfectly since, amen, the
[1:09:02] beginning of March.
[1:09:05] So, it's not what we have. It's not what
[1:09:09] we can give him in the natural. It's a
[1:09:13] surrender of heart to his call upon us.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Many of times we say, "I don't know if I
[1:09:22] can do it." Amen. Well, the church
[1:09:25] world, Amen, the world out there is
[1:09:28] surrendering their lives to to to
[1:09:31] Satan's purpose. Why can't the church,
[1:09:34] why can't the bride surrender her life?
[1:09:36] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. The prophet
[1:09:38] would say, "Notice, just a minute, a nun
[1:09:40] in a Catholic church. That woman to to
[1:09:43] become a nun, she takes the last veil.
[1:09:45] She's absolutely sold out to that
[1:09:47] church. She is soul, body, and spirit
[1:09:50] property of that church. She has no mind
[1:09:52] of her own. She she can't have when she
[1:09:56] takes that last veil. No mind of her
[1:09:58] own. No will of her own." See out there,
[1:10:01] Satan makes them his bogus. Amen. Like
[1:10:04] the true. Amen. Somebody says, "But the
[1:10:07] true church of Christ, the bride is so
[1:10:11] sold out to him and his promised word
[1:10:15] till the very mind that's in Christ is
[1:10:19] now in you."
[1:10:22] What a what a difference. Amen. We find
[1:10:24] the modern church, a modern church
[1:10:27] world. Amen. I it it all also there is
[1:10:31] that church modern church but there is
[1:10:33] also that spiritual church that are
[1:10:35] pregnantated to give birth to sons.
[1:10:38] Amen. I just as the natural church is
[1:10:41] set in order to give amen to that
[1:10:45] antichrist and that antichrist will rule
[1:10:48] the world and believe me amen that
[1:10:51] anointing is upon the earth right now.
[1:10:54] Amen. Trump might think that he can he
[1:10:56] can fix all the world's problem, but the
[1:10:58] antichrist is going to come and he is
[1:11:01] going to be like a superman for the
[1:11:04] church and for the world.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the bride of Jesus
[1:11:11] Christ is to give birth unto the word.
[1:11:15] We're going to give birth to Jesus
[1:11:18] Christ. Amen. In the beginning was the
[1:11:20] word. The word was with God. The word
[1:11:22] was God. The word was made flesh and
[1:11:24] dwelt among us. The church, what are we
[1:11:27] doing? Amen. We're groaning and we're
[1:11:29] earnestly contending. We're saying,
[1:11:31] "God, Amen. Your word has promised. Your
[1:11:34] word has promised healing. Your word has
[1:11:36] promised deliverance. Your word has
[1:11:38] promised, Amen, victory for my family.
[1:11:40] Your word has promised a a salvation for
[1:11:43] my children." What are you doing? You
[1:11:46] are taking God back to his word. You are
[1:11:48] standing there and saying, "God, I
[1:11:51] believe your word is true. I believe
[1:11:54] what you said. I know your word can come
[1:11:57] to pass." And you're you're you are
[1:12:00] giving birth to word promises
[1:12:03] all around you.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I'm not talking
[1:12:12] about the natural
[1:12:14] birthing. I'm talking about the
[1:12:16] spiritual bride.
[1:12:18] being impregnated with the word, being
[1:12:20] impregnated with the promises. I believe
[1:12:23] what God says. I believe his word is
[1:12:27] true. I believe everything. And what are
[1:12:30] you doing? You are accepting the
[1:12:32] supernatural seed into your life. And
[1:12:35] you are confessing that word and it must
[1:12:38] come to pass.
[1:12:41] It's just as much of a b a virgin birth
[1:12:43] as as Mary producing Jesus. It's the
[1:12:47] accepting of the seeds and believing the
[1:12:50] words of promises to come to pass.
[1:12:55] Now
[1:12:58] you say this is really strange. I'm
[1:13:00] asking what does the Lord require of me?
[1:13:04] You see, while the church world has sold
[1:13:08] their birthright for scientific
[1:13:11] leadership as and and and and and she's
[1:13:14] caused the whole world to accept this
[1:13:17] scientific
[1:13:18] uh leadership of the educational
[1:13:21] programs that Satan had given to her.
[1:13:25] The church like Eve ha has was offered
[1:13:28] God's word. But what did she do with it?
[1:13:31] Instead of tearing for the baptism of
[1:13:33] the Holy Ghost, now she comes and shakes
[1:13:35] the preacher's hand. Well, praise the
[1:13:37] Lord. She has let her scient science
[1:13:40] proved to her that the Holy Ghost was
[1:13:42] only for the disciples. Instead of
[1:13:44] continuing on with divine healing, we've
[1:13:46] we've made our excuses and amended Satan
[1:13:50] by the leadership of religious man to
[1:13:52] take the word of God and to try to say
[1:13:54] it was for another age. Well, praise the
[1:13:56] Lord. Amen. But there is a bride who is
[1:14:00] standing there and saying, "I am not
[1:14:02] here just to be here. I have been called
[1:14:07] with divine purpose. I have a divine
[1:14:10] order. God has given me a supernatural
[1:14:13] birth." Amen. I have an authority that
[1:14:17] is greater than the job I'm sending or
[1:14:20] working at, greater than my position
[1:14:23] that I hold in the community. I've got a
[1:14:26] position in Christ Jesus. And I'm going
[1:14:30] to take that responsibility
[1:14:33] seriously before God.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:41] Hallelujah. What does the Lord require
[1:14:44] of me? What has he called me for? Well,
[1:14:48] if we're to be his bride, we're to be
[1:14:51] his body. We're to continue on his
[1:14:52] works.
[1:14:54] You see, this is where the total
[1:14:56] surrender. You say, "Well, I don't see
[1:14:58] any of that anymore." Why don't we see
[1:15:00] it anymore? Is because there's not
[1:15:02] enough surrender.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I was 16 years old when I was seeing
[1:15:14] miracles in my in my little ministry.
[1:15:19] Ronnie and Linda back there and Sister
[1:15:21] Carol. I don't see Sister Carol this
[1:15:23] morning. Oh, she's in she's in Denver.
[1:15:25] Amen. But but but y'all remember I was
[1:15:27] 19 years old when I come to Pawne.
[1:15:31] Stupid as all get out. Just as ignorant
[1:15:34] as a as a rock. Hallelujah. Amen. But
[1:15:38] there's one thing that I did. I wanted
[1:15:41] to do something for the Lord.
[1:15:44] And I didn't mind yielding myself to the
[1:15:46] Lord to do that. I didn't know what I
[1:15:49] was doing. But you see what God is
[1:15:51] looking for here this morning. God will
[1:15:54] give you what it takes. But he's looking
[1:15:56] for someone to surrender everything to
[1:15:59] him. Amen. There's got to be a total
[1:16:01] surrender. There's got to be somebody
[1:16:03] that is willing.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; You take brother Joshua. Amen. Out
[1:16:10] evangelizing.
[1:16:12] Evangelizing isn't isn't is is is far
[1:16:15] from glamorous.
[1:16:17] He and he and Loretta going from church
[1:16:21] to church throughout the week, going
[1:16:24] from motel to motel, living out of a
[1:16:28] suitcase for months at a time. Amen. And
[1:16:32] and getting offerings that that that
[1:16:35] many times they they can't even make it
[1:16:38] through the to to the next place hardly
[1:16:40] with the offering that they've got.
[1:16:43] But yet it is somebody
[1:16:46] who has surrendered. They've had them
[1:16:49] out Calvary. They had a place where they
[1:16:52] had to die to themselves and say, "Lord,
[1:16:56] not my will but thy will be done."
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; It's not a glamorous job.
[1:17:05] I look there at,
[1:17:07] you know, Caleb's house and how
[1:17:09] beautiful his is becoming. and well, I
[1:17:12] just don't work on mine. But I look at
[1:17:13] Josh's and and and and what he started
[1:17:16] and how quickly that's coming along.
[1:17:19] Hallelujah. You see, you you look at
[1:17:22] these things, you can't have both
[1:17:24] worlds, you've got to surrender. And
[1:17:26] whatever you give your life to, then you
[1:17:29] give your life to it.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; When you surrender your life to God,
[1:17:36] it's not God plus me. It is God. You
[1:17:39] give everything you've got to God and
[1:17:43] then let him take care of the rest. Can
[1:17:45] I hear an amen?
[1:17:50] God wants all of us.
[1:17:53] Many a times a sinner will come in.
[1:17:57] It used to be
[1:17:59] that people would come to an altar and
[1:18:02] they would weep and cry
[1:18:06] because of their sins and the burdens
[1:18:09] and they would ask and beg God to give
[1:18:12] and forgive them and want deliverance
[1:18:15] from their habits and sins and they man
[1:18:18] the wrongs they've done. But today it
[1:18:22] seems that it seems that
[1:18:26] surrender is hard for us all. It's hard
[1:18:30] for the sinner. It's hard for those that
[1:18:32] are the believer that's in the church.
[1:18:34] But I'm here to tell you there is a
[1:18:38] place there is amen a a a a resting
[1:18:42] place in God. And that's what I'm
[1:18:44] preaching here this morning is God don't
[1:18:46] let me be satisfied with the status quo.
[1:18:50] Don't let me just come to church and sit
[1:18:52] here. But God, I want you to look at me.
[1:18:54] I I want you to say, "When will you go?"
[1:18:58] And I want to have a heart saying, "Yes,
[1:19:01] I will go. Send me."
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; God's still the deliverer. Do you
[1:19:10] believe it?
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; He's still the baptizer.
[1:19:19] He still speaks in tongues.
[1:19:22] He still prophesies.
[1:19:25] He still works miracles.
[1:19:28] When it was asked of me, a preacher
[1:19:29] asked me of of a of one of our leading
[1:19:32] preachers in our
[1:19:34] in in you know a very well-known
[1:19:37] preacher said, "Brother Wendle, why why
[1:19:39] don't we see a lot of things?" And I
[1:19:42] said, "It's quite simple. When we were
[1:19:44] poor, we were able to surrender.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; But now when we have money and we then
[1:19:52] we have a little bit of prestige, we're
[1:19:55] not as desperate as we once were. We're
[1:19:59] not crying. Well, I'm preaching better
[1:20:01] than your amening this morning. We're
[1:20:03] not crying out and asking God for his
[1:20:06] mercy and for his help because we've got
[1:20:09] all the doctors and we've got all the
[1:20:11] money and we've got everything. Oh yes,
[1:20:13] even the poorest of us have nice things.
[1:20:16] But God is looking for somebody that he
[1:20:19] can take his hand and put upon. I don't
[1:20:23] know. I don't know which one of these
[1:20:24] boys, Amen, would would be a who's going
[1:20:27] to be the preachers or who's going to be
[1:20:28] the next song leaders or who's going to
[1:20:30] be the next deacons. But I guarantee you
[1:20:32] this one thing here. If the Lord should
[1:20:34] terry, it's going to be young men like
[1:20:36] you, Connor. That's got to surrender
[1:20:38] your life to God. It's got to be young
[1:20:41] men like you, Dylan. It's got to be
[1:20:42] young ladies that's got to surrender
[1:20:45] their lives to God. Everything they
[1:20:49] have.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Mistakes are going to be there. Failures
[1:20:59] are going to happen. Getting it right
[1:21:02] all the time
[1:21:04] is for the other world.
[1:21:10] There's going to be a lot of mistakes.
[1:21:13] There's going to be a lot of failures.
[1:21:15] There's going to have to be a lot of
[1:21:16] times where we come back to an altar and
[1:21:18] say, "The Lord Jesus, forgive me. Put me
[1:21:21] back in service again."
[1:21:24] Hallelujah. Can you say amen? You see,
[1:21:27] there's going to be those times of of
[1:21:29] But but you see, the sinner isn't
[1:21:32] desperate like it should be. the the the
[1:21:34] cry the cry for more of God, the cry
[1:21:39] like it should be. But I'm here to tell
[1:21:41] you, God's got a bride who's going to
[1:21:44] make it her business
[1:21:46] to follow him.
[1:21:49] Can you say amen?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Is this okay this morning?
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; See, his word has to live itself out for
[1:21:59] every generation.
[1:22:01] Amen.
[1:22:03] Now,
[1:22:04] two churches. There's always been twins.
[1:22:09] There was
[1:22:11] Abel and Cain.
[1:22:14] Amen.
[1:22:16] There was There was Jacob and Esau.
[1:22:20] You could go down through the scripture.
[1:22:21] There was Isaac and Ishmael.
[1:22:25] There was Jesus and Judas.
[1:22:29] Every time God wants to do something,
[1:22:33] Satan will come up. And every one of
[1:22:35] these, whether it be Cain, Ishmael, they
[1:22:38] were all religious.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Judas was very religious. He cast out
[1:22:43] devils.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; So, you can't look at the church natural
[1:22:49] and say, "This is all God's doing."
[1:22:53] We've got to look at the church
[1:22:54] spiritual
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; and we got to say, I'm going to
[1:22:58] surrender everything I've got to this
[1:23:01] word.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; What does the Lord require of me?
[1:23:07] Well,
[1:23:10] all he wants
[1:23:13] is you.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Well, if I come and I I maybe if I fill
[1:23:19] up the church, that's that's good. But
[1:23:22] he wants you.
[1:23:24] Well, I I I I'll bring a whole bunch of
[1:23:26] money and put it in the in the coffers.
[1:23:29] Well, that's good. But he wants you. He
[1:23:32] wants to walk with you and talk with you
[1:23:34] and Well, praise the Lord. Am I making
[1:23:36] sense here this morning?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; He wants that word to be so living
[1:23:40] within us that he becomes our everything
[1:23:43] as we have become his everything.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] Now, one of the churches a
[1:23:50] denominational birth and it's going to
[1:23:52] give one of these days to that world
[1:23:54] council of churches which will produce
[1:23:57] to the world the antichrist. Amen.
[1:24:00] Through denominationalism.
[1:24:02] That's the truth. Amen. It's going to be
[1:24:05] there. But the other is pregnant by the
[1:24:08] word of God and will bring forth the
[1:24:12] body, the finished body of Jesus Christ,
[1:24:15] which is his bride. The body of Christ
[1:24:19] alone isn't enough isn't finished yet. H
[1:24:22] how many knows that a man or a woman, a
[1:24:26] man is and and a woman is one. Christ is
[1:24:29] one body the word and the bride will
[1:24:31] have to be the rest of that body. The
[1:24:34] two together makes one body again like
[1:24:37] Adam was at the beginning man his wife
[1:24:40] or one. how she, the true bride, is so
[1:24:44] sold out to him that she used no mind of
[1:24:47] her own. But it's his mind. Of course,
[1:24:50] it's his will. And his will is his word.
[1:24:54] Can you say amen? The word in action,
[1:24:58] living the Bible. That's the Bible pride
[1:25:02] today. We stand alone like the
[1:25:04] bridegroom, rejected and despised. Amen.
[1:25:08] But the bride stands that way knowing
[1:25:11] that Christ is her everything.
[1:25:16] When I look at the world and I look at
[1:25:18] my my calling,
[1:25:23] as we talk just a little bit more about
[1:25:25] the callings that God has given us,
[1:25:30] I can't look at my ability to write
[1:25:32] songs or to play music or to pastor a
[1:25:37] church.
[1:25:40] Those are gifts that God gave me. Those
[1:25:44] are things that
[1:25:46] but what he wants of me
[1:25:50] is me.
[1:25:54] Cuz I can sing and it not be from here.
[1:25:56] I can preach and it not be from here. I
[1:25:59] can give money and not be from here.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; So when God gives you these gifts and
[1:26:06] talents and yet just remember Amen. The
[1:26:09] scripture says that there were the there
[1:26:11] were the the the talents that were given
[1:26:15] as the man was going to go on a long
[1:26:18] journey. And so he gives five talents to
[1:26:21] one and he gives three to another and
[1:26:24] and and and one to another. And the one
[1:26:27] with the five, he when he when the
[1:26:30] goodman came back, he he gave the he had
[1:26:34] gave him his five back and also gave him
[1:26:36] the interest of the other five. And then
[1:26:38] he those I believe he was either two or
[1:26:40] three and and then he had multiplied
[1:26:43] that and but the one that didn't have
[1:26:45] much. He didn't have
[1:26:48] he was only given one talent.
[1:26:51] The other guys were given a whole bunch
[1:26:52] and he was only given one. And the Bible
[1:26:54] says that he buried that talent in the
[1:26:57] dirt.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean I'm not like I'm not the
[1:27:01] preacher and I'm not the song leader and
[1:27:03] I'm not Amen.
[1:27:05] All I got is my little talent and I you
[1:27:08] know and so I just ah who cares.
[1:27:12] Apparently the one who gave the talent
[1:27:14] cared
[1:27:17] because when he found that he just
[1:27:19] presented to him the single talent that
[1:27:22] he had originally given him.
[1:27:26] He says why did you hide that talent?
[1:27:30] You should have at least taken it to the
[1:27:32] useries.
[1:27:34] Well, praise the Lord. Boy, this is the
[1:27:36] quietest group I've preached to in a
[1:27:37] long time.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; You You You knew that I was wrathful.
[1:27:45] You knew that I sold places that didn't
[1:27:49] belong. I You know the kind of man that
[1:27:51] I am.
[1:27:56] You didn't put that gift to work.
[1:27:59] You hid that in your dirt.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; You went and the Bible says he hid it in
[1:28:05] the dirt. And I think there's there's
[1:28:08] Hallelujah. I don't want to stand before
[1:28:09] the Lord. Amen. And I've got I've got
[1:28:12] I've got my gifts hiding in this dirt.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want to give it to
[1:28:20] the Lord. Chances are I won't need it on
[1:28:23] the other side, but I do need it now.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:28] There are souls to be saved. Now,
[1:28:33] when I heard the other day about the
[1:28:37] uh sister Brianna talking about her work
[1:28:41] uh worker there, the guy had cancer.
[1:28:43] Gower guy.
[1:28:46] Yeah.
[1:28:48] Her brother-in-law.
[1:28:51] Yeah. Mother-in-law. And and and still
[1:28:53] young.
[1:28:56] Still still young. and cancer's got it.
[1:28:58] And I I look at my dad with this
[1:29:00] Parkinson's and he wants to be here this
[1:29:02] morning, but he can't. Just just so
[1:29:03] weak. You got you got you you you hear
[1:29:06] these things. Uh uh uh you know, we just
[1:29:09] heard that that that that Sister Denise
[1:29:12] has now got a uh she she's got cancer
[1:29:15] there in her uterus. And and and we hear
[1:29:18] these things.
[1:29:21] What should it do to us as the bride?
[1:29:26] because our commission has been to cast
[1:29:28] out devils,
[1:29:30] lay hands on the sick.
[1:29:35] Do do you understand how that God has
[1:29:38] placed you here in his face? You see,
[1:29:40] when the sun is is gone and and and it
[1:29:43] is set, then it's time for the moon to
[1:29:45] rule in its place.
[1:29:48] And Christ, the son of God, the God of
[1:29:50] all glory, amen, has has went on to
[1:29:53] heaven uh uh before us. But the bride is
[1:29:56] the moon. We are standing here to hold
[1:29:59] back the tide.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That moon has a responsibility to hold
[1:30:05] back that tide.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; If that moon gets out of place, this
[1:30:09] whole earth would be covered with water.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Those stars, they stand in place.
[1:30:15] They're God's army.
[1:30:19] What about you as the living church of
[1:30:22] the living God?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Pentecost.
[1:30:32] We shot all of our steam out the
[1:30:34] whistle.
[1:30:36] I remember. I remembers those times. We
[1:30:39] ran around here. Not here at the old
[1:30:41] building. Run around. We Hallelujah. I
[1:30:44] could tell you all kinds of stories.
[1:30:46] Amen. Having a wonderful time.
[1:30:50] But God didn't send his power for us to
[1:30:52] have a wonderful time. You don't want to
[1:30:54] blow all the steam out your whistle. You
[1:30:56] want to blow that steam is to put the
[1:30:58] train down the road
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; or down the tracks.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. We're thankful
[1:31:05] for all all of the wonderful zach, but
[1:31:07] I'm here to tell you there is a powerful
[1:31:09] church here,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; but God wants
[1:31:14] I praise the Lord.
[1:31:19] You can have
[1:31:22] water over here on this part of the
[1:31:24] country.
[1:31:26] Maybe there's a hundred acres over here
[1:31:28] and it's and it's got it's got water in
[1:31:30] it and it's got a nice beautiful stream.
[1:31:33] And then you got a 100 acres sitting
[1:31:34] next to it and it's burning up because
[1:31:37] it's not had no rain.
[1:31:40] And this guy over here is wondering what
[1:31:42] what am I going to do about it? I I wish
[1:31:44] I wish I had the blessings over there.
[1:31:46] All you have to do is do things
[1:31:48] according to God's law and find a way to
[1:31:51] get that stream over there in your part
[1:31:52] of the country. All you have to do is to
[1:31:55] divert get over get some water over
[1:31:57] there in your Are y'all hearing me? All
[1:31:59] we have to do is say, "God, let me yield
[1:32:02] myself." God still saves souls. God
[1:32:04] still saves children. God still heals
[1:32:06] the sick. God still do does these
[1:32:09] things.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; A surrender. That surrender that I've
[1:32:16] been talking about, Lord, what would you
[1:32:18] require of me? You see, owning up to
[1:32:22] those responsibilities,
[1:32:25] he says, when you see then in this day
[1:32:27] now, when the word of God has made these
[1:32:30] promises and things that we see
[1:32:32] happening,
[1:32:34] then we've got the responsibility to
[1:32:36] either face up to it or get away from
[1:32:38] it. You can't stay neutral. You've got
[1:32:41] to do something about it. Some move has
[1:32:44] got to be made. You can't come in the
[1:32:45] church door and go out the same person
[1:32:47] you came in.
[1:32:49] you either further away or closer to
[1:32:51] God.
[1:32:53] Can you say amen?
[1:32:55] God can only use what we give him.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Now, as we as I begin to
[1:33:04] as I begin to wind my thoughts down here
[1:33:07] this morning,
[1:33:09] oh God,
[1:33:12] I've been having I've been I don't know.
[1:33:15] Something's been happening these last
[1:33:17] three or four weeks
[1:33:20] in my heart. There's been like a really
[1:33:23] a renewing or a a real nudging.
[1:33:26] Wendell, are you giving me everything?
[1:33:30] Are you are you putting it all on the
[1:33:32] line? Are you leaving it all on the
[1:33:34] line? Are you holding a reserve?
[1:33:39] And I've been looking in the mirror of
[1:33:40] God's word and I said, 'Well, I don't
[1:33:43] miss church. I try to be faithful uh to
[1:33:48] to my preaching. I try to. But then the
[1:33:53] the answer comes back,
[1:33:56] but are you doing all the Lord is
[1:33:58] requiring of thee? And I I say, well,
[1:34:01] what else could I do? And the question
[1:34:04] comes back, are you giving me your
[1:34:06] everything?
[1:34:11] I can't bring the full potential out
[1:34:13] until you give me everything.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm I'm a singer. Well, I'm a
[1:34:22] preacher. Well, I'm a this. Well, I'm a
[1:34:24] that. Amen. God wants everything.
[1:34:30] Can you say amen to that?
[1:34:33] Now,
[1:34:34] now there's a lot that will say, "Well,
[1:34:37] 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, you
[1:34:38] know, and if the preacher goes in, he
[1:34:40] preaches any longer than that. I'll just
[1:34:42] get up and go home."
[1:34:44] That's all they can handle. Some says,
[1:34:46] "Well, I can do a little bit more than
[1:34:47] that. I'll do I'll I I I'll do an hour."
[1:34:51] Amen. Well, that's good. But what can
[1:34:54] you give?
[1:34:57] God will receive whatever you'll give
[1:34:58] him. That's just that's just a fact. God
[1:35:00] will receive whatever you want to give
[1:35:02] him. But he wants every bit of us. He
[1:35:05] wants our all. He wants your life. He
[1:35:08] wants your testimony. He wants every
[1:35:10] minute you live. He wants He wants every
[1:35:12] action. He wants everything you are.
[1:35:15] Amen. Oh, can you say amen? He wants
[1:35:17] everything. Somebody say everything
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; perfectly surrendered to him so he can
[1:35:22] lead you and guide you and put you in
[1:35:25] places where he wants you to go. led of
[1:35:29] the spirit.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; I say to you young men and young women,
[1:35:37] boys and girls,
[1:35:40] there's never a better time
[1:35:43] than to serve God where you are.
[1:35:47] Don't sit on a pew and dry and die and
[1:35:50] and then go outside and when you get
[1:35:53] older and and go and live for the devil.
[1:35:58] Why not find Christ right now and right
[1:36:00] here where you are and surrender your
[1:36:03] talents and your gifts to the Lord right
[1:36:05] now where you are and serve him with
[1:36:07] everything you've got right now where
[1:36:09] you are.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:36:16] I remember
[1:36:18] going but as a kid to the nursing homes.
[1:36:22] Now all I had was me and my bike and my
[1:36:24] guitar and my little brother's wagon.
[1:36:27] Amen.
[1:36:29] And uh so I'd take Jonathan's wagon,
[1:36:32] hook it up to my bike, and I'd grab my
[1:36:34] guitar and I'
[1:36:37] I'd be going out singing. uh go to the
[1:36:39] funerals or uh uh nursing homes and and
[1:36:43] uh not funeral homes, nursing homes and
[1:36:45] and sing and and testify.
[1:36:49] And when when some of those elders to
[1:36:51] the Lord,
[1:36:54] God could use that.
[1:36:57] I remember when I was 16 and they
[1:36:59] finally let me go into the jail and uh I
[1:37:03] got to go and and I' I'd take my guitar.
[1:37:06] would go every every week and I' I'd go
[1:37:10] preach to them guys in jail and sing.
[1:37:14] What was I doing? I had a desire.
[1:37:18] I had a gift and that gift had to come
[1:37:23] forth. And the only way that gift could
[1:37:24] ever come into maturity is for me to use
[1:37:27] it.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every good preacher's got to start
[1:37:34] somewhere.
[1:37:36] Every good singer's got to start
[1:37:37] somewhere. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ronnie, you you and Sister
[1:37:42] Linda, y'all y'all remember when Sean
[1:37:44] preached his first sermon, Jonathan
[1:37:46] preached his first sermon. Now, those
[1:37:48] guys are incredible preachers today, but
[1:37:51] they had to start somewhere.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; A surrender.
[1:38:03] You see, when we the the the the the old
[1:38:06] saying is idleness is the devil's
[1:38:08] playground.
[1:38:11] And if you're not under the loan and
[1:38:14] you're not taking your your position
[1:38:17] responsibly, Satan will find a way for
[1:38:21] you and make sure that that that that
[1:38:23] that you're busy.
[1:38:29] So, what I say today is, Lord, I'm going
[1:38:32] to take it upon me.
[1:38:34] I'm going to enter into prayer. I I
[1:38:36] think that's the best place to start
[1:38:38] right there for every one of us. Lord,
[1:38:42] I'm going to surrender everything I've
[1:38:44] got. I I'm going to pray. God, I don't
[1:38:46] know what you've called me to do. I
[1:38:47] don't know what you've called me to be,
[1:38:49] but you've called me for something, and
[1:38:51] I want you to use me. if the musicians
[1:38:54] would come.
[1:38:57] Hallelujah.
[1:38:59] I I I want us, Lord, I I I've been
[1:39:02] feeling something. Maybe there's someone
[1:39:04] here today and deep down inside your
[1:39:06] heart, you're you're you're saying, "I
[1:39:08] I've been feeling something in my heart
[1:39:09] for a while, Brother Wendell."
[1:39:12] Well, that the way you do that is just
[1:39:14] go before the Lord in prayer and say,
[1:39:17] "Lord,
[1:39:18] I'm going to surrender everything I've
[1:39:20] got to you.
[1:39:22] You're not too young.
[1:39:25] You're not too old.
[1:39:27] You're not too far in sin. You don't
[1:39:29] have too too too bad of a past.
[1:39:36] We're living in the present.
[1:39:39] And we've got a bright future.
[1:39:43] And I say
[1:39:46] the labors, the harvest is great and the
[1:39:48] laborers are few.
[1:39:52] the harvest. There's plenty of to do for
[1:39:55] the Lord.
[1:39:58] There's plenty of work.
[1:40:00] There's plenty of things
[1:40:03] that I can be active in.
[1:40:09] But the laborers all want us to go sit
[1:40:10] in the house instead of going out there
[1:40:12] in the heat and
[1:40:15] gathering the harvest.
[1:40:20] easier easier just to do nothing and
[1:40:22] say, "Brother,
[1:40:26] good job you're doing there." God wants
[1:40:28] to say, we want to hear God saying to
[1:40:30] us, "Good job." Can you say, "Amen."
[1:40:33] That's right.
[1:40:35] That's right. I think the greatest I
[1:40:38] think the greatest thing that we could
[1:40:39] ever have
[1:40:41] is when we stand before the Lord
[1:40:45] and we find out the souls that have been
[1:40:49] saved
[1:40:50] because you surrendered your life to
[1:40:52] Jesus.
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:41:00] Hey, when I was a kid, I wonder
[1:41:04] if my pastor
[1:41:07] that that brat. He he knew if he knew
[1:41:10] that that brat would end up being a a
[1:41:12] preacher.
[1:41:14] I wonder if he knew that those three
[1:41:16] Martin boys would end up pastoring
[1:41:18] churches.
[1:41:21] Wonder if my mama ever thought about
[1:41:22] that. She's thinking, "Oh, dear Lord."
[1:41:27] Right? But somebody had to stay
[1:41:30] faithful.
[1:41:32] Good days, bad days, somebody
[1:41:36] had a purpose and a call.
[1:41:40] I don't know. I I I I I just I just say
[1:41:43] when we get on the other side, there's
[1:41:45] going to be a lot of people there's
[1:41:47] going to be a lot of people that
[1:41:50] maybe you're thinking, I I just I've
[1:41:53] been faithful. I've been a faithful
[1:41:55] mama. I've I've been a faithful Sunday
[1:41:58] school teacher. I've been a what
[1:42:00] whatever. I it it just don't seem like
[1:42:03] it's it don't seem like I've I've got
[1:42:05] much to offer or but I believe when we
[1:42:08] get on the other side there's going to
[1:42:09] be there's sister Emily there's going to
[1:42:11] be a lot of souls that were touched by
[1:42:13] your gift by your singing
[1:42:16] by being who you are.
[1:42:19] There's going to be a lot of there's
[1:42:20] going to be a lot of souls on that other
[1:42:22] side because somebody surrendered
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:28] because it takes us all.
[1:42:33] It takes us all right here in our in our
[1:42:36] little church here.
[1:42:39] It takes it it it takes a big a great
[1:42:42] big team before for us to even get a
[1:42:44] service for where everyone enjoys
[1:42:47] themselves.
[1:42:50] Takes musicians getting here early,
[1:42:53] tuning up.
[1:42:56] Takes preacher
[1:42:58] praying and laying before God and
[1:43:00] studying.
[1:43:02] Takes song leaders giving their all,
[1:43:06] calling out to God, asking for the
[1:43:08] anointing.
[1:43:10] It takes all of us.
[1:43:16] But isn't it wonderful when the effects
[1:43:19] when the spirit of the Lord comes down
[1:43:21] upon us?
[1:43:24] Isn't it wonderful when the anointing of
[1:43:26] the Holy Spirit just comes in and puts a
[1:43:28] sanction on it and says, "Ah, I want to
[1:43:31] come to that church service.
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:36] Lord, let me take my
[1:43:39] let me take your calling serious upon my
[1:43:43] life."
[1:43:45] Song leaders, if there's ever been a
[1:43:47] time for you to dedicate, now's the
[1:43:49] time. Preachers, if there's ever been a
[1:43:50] time, now's the time. We're in the final
[1:43:53] thrust. Oh God, don't let us just be a
[1:43:56] another preacher, another sermon, but
[1:43:57] let the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:59] come and break the yolks. Mama, you're
[1:44:01] your position is so important.
[1:44:04] Oh, you say, "I'm just a mama." You're
[1:44:07] anointed for this.
[1:44:10] You're anointed. You're raising sons and
[1:44:12] daughters that's going to go in a
[1:44:13] rapture.
[1:44:16] Take it serious.
[1:44:20] Call unto God and say, "God, give me I I
[1:44:22] I I I I need your strength. I need your
[1:44:25] help. I'm desperate for your anointing.
[1:44:28] I want you upon my life. Don't want to
[1:44:31] sing without you. Don't want to preach
[1:44:32] without you. Don't want to raise
[1:44:33] children without you. Don't want to go
[1:44:35] to work without you. I want you in me."
[1:44:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:44] Thank you Jesus.

[2:00:06] Many Satan has tried to destroy through
[2:00:09] drugs and alcohol.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; He's tried to destroy through
[2:00:13] pornography.
[2:00:16] He's tried to destroy many marriages.
[2:00:18] He's tried to destroy many young people.
[2:00:25] What would the Lord require of me?
[2:00:28] I stand up today and I say, "Our God is
[2:00:31] greater than the devil.
[2:00:33] I say our God is greater than addiction.
[2:00:38] I say our God is greater than anything
[2:00:40] that the devil can do.
[2:00:45] Hallelujah.
[2:00:47] That's what God is wanting. Somebody
[2:00:49] that's so surrendered to him that
[2:00:52] believes every word. And I believe God
[2:00:55] can still save the lost, heal the sick,
[2:00:58] deliver cancer,
[2:01:01] set us free.
[2:01:04] God can still deliver our children from
[2:01:06] alcoholism.
[2:01:08] God can still deliver our young people.
