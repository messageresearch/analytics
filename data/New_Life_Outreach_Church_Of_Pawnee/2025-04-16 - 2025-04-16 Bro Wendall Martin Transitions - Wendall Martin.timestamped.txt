[0:01] I want to
[0:03] hear when the wise man
[0:07] spoke says your circumstance is as
[0:11] hopeless as can
[0:15] be. That's when God wants to
[0:19] hear you.
[0:21] See, he loves to hear your praise. He
[0:25] loves to hear your praise.
[0:30] On those cheerful
[0:32] days when the pleasant times
[0:36] they by
[0:40] far but when suffering comes
[0:44] alone and we still sing the
[0:49] song that is when we bless the father's
[0:53] heart.
[0:57] God wants to hear you
[1:00] sing. When the waves are crash
[1:04] round, when the fiery darts
[1:08] around and despair is all you
[1:12] see, God wants to hear your
[1:16] voice. When the wise man is
[1:20] full says your
[1:24] circumstance as can
[1:28] be that's when God wants to
[1:32] hear you
[1:34] [Music]
[1:36] see. Oh through it
[1:44] all. Through it
[1:47] [Music]
[1:50] all, I've
[1:53] learned to trust in
[1:55] [Music]
[1:58] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[2:05] God. Through it
[2:07] [Music]
[2:11] all. Through it
[2:14] [Music]
[2:17] all. I
[2:20] learn to
[2:23] depend
[2:24] upon his
[2:31] word. Lord, I thank him
[2:34] for the
[2:38] valleys and I thank him
[2:41] for the
[2:44] mountains and I thank him
[2:48] for the storms he's
[2:51] brought through.
[2:59] Or if
[3:00] I've never had a
[3:05] problem, I would know that God could
[3:10] solve
[3:12] them. I would know what
[3:15] faith in his word will
[3:20] do. Help me sing it now through it all.
[3:23] Oh, now through it all. Thank you,
[3:28] Lord.
[3:30] Oh, through it
[3:33] [Music]
[3:36] all, I've
[3:38] learned to trust in
[3:41] [Music]
[3:43] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[3:48] God. Oh, now through it all.
[3:56] Oh, through it all.
[4:01] All I've
[4:04] learned to
[4:06] depend
[4:08] upon his word. Can we sing another verse
[4:11] as we stand
[4:13] now? I've had many
[4:15] tears. I've had many tears and sorrows.
[4:24] [Music]
[4:28] tomorrow. There's been times I didn't
[4:32] know right
[4:36] from I love this. But in every
[4:40] situation, But in every
[4:46] situation, God gave me blessed
[4:52] consolation that my trials come to make
[4:58] me
[5:00] strong. Sing it now through it all. Oh,
[5:04] now through it all.
[5:08] Thank you, Lord.
[5:10] Oh, through it
[5:15] all. I've learned to trust in
[5:20] [Music]
[5:21] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[5:26] God. Oh, now through it
[5:31] all. Oh my. Oh, through it all.
[5:37] [Music]
[5:40] I've
[5:41] learned to

[5:46] upon his
[5:52] word. Hallelujah.
[5:55] Can you say that with confidence here
[5:57] tonight that through all the trials and
[6:00] the struggles we've ever been

[6:56] that's touched by that feeling of our
[6:57] infirmities here tonight and he sees the
[7:00] needs and if you have a need upon your
[7:01] heart just make it known by the lifting

[8:09] you, oh

[8:17] Jesus. I'm dependent on
[8:21] you. Depending on
[8:24] you. Verse one.
[8:27] now. Well, when they came to the water,
[8:31] they didn't know what to
[8:33] do. There was no one to help. They
[8:37] couldn't see their way
[8:39] through. The Lord moved the
[8:42] waters. They walked right on through.
[8:46] Oh, Jesus, we're dependent on you.
[8:51] Oh now
[8:54] Jesus, Lord, we are
[8:57] depending. Yes, we are.

[9:10] you. Depending on you to see me through
[9:17] when your face try. We know this. We
[9:20] still know that it's true. You know the
[9:24] devil's a liar. There's not much he can
[9:28] do. Though he tries hard to stop us, we
[9:32] know you'll see us through. Oh my Jesus.
[9:36] How many can say that tonight? Thank
[9:38] you, Lord. Oh, now my
[9:43] Jesus, I'm depending on
[9:46] you, oh Jesus.
[9:49] We are dependent on you. Oh

[9:58] you. Depending on you once again now. Oh
[10:04] now
[10:10] Jesus.
[10:12] Oh, we are dependent on you. Oh Jesus,
[10:19] your bride is depending on
[10:22] you. Depending on you to see me
[10:30] through. Can we go to
[10:34] Bflat? Can we do our God is tremendous.
[10:37] Amen. Do you believe that here this
[10:39] evening? Amen. When I'm in need, I call
[10:44] on the
[10:45] Lord. Oh, and he hears me. Yes, he helps
[10:51] me. He is
[10:54] faithful and true. Won't forget his
[10:58] own. I love that. Oh, he's my
[11:04] companion, my best friend, the only true
[11:08] God. There's no one
[11:11] greater, wonderful
[11:14] savior. Jesus, the lion of
[11:19] [Music]
[11:20] Judah. Oh, our God is tremendous. His
[11:25] strength never faileth. He goes through
[11:28] the fire just the same. Little faster.
[11:32] Oh, he is mighty. sends his
[11:36] angels to guide
[11:39] me. There's no storm too powerful or God
[11:44] cannot handle. Our God in simplicity
[11:48] revealed in you and me. Came down from
[11:51] his glory. Gave us the victory. The
[11:55] greatest love
[11:56] story. I love this. Oh, when you're in
[12:01] trouble, Jehovah Nissi, the great
[12:05] enforcer, God Almighty, will fight your
[12:10] battle. Oh
[12:13] [Music]
[12:20] yes. Think it should our great
[12:23] Jehovah just love the paradox. Stay in
[12:27] your position and watch the
[12:30] miraculous come into act. If you believe
[12:33] he's tremendous, tell someone about it
[12:35] tonight. God is tremendous. His strength
[12:38] never faileth. Goes through the fire
[12:41] just to save a sinner. He is
[12:45] almighty. Sends his
[12:48] angels to guide me. Thank you, Lord.
[12:52] There's no storm too powerful. Our God
[12:56] cannot handle. Our God in some blessed
[13:00] revealed and you and me came down from
[13:03] his glory. Gave us the victory. The
[13:07] greatest love story. Can we do verse two
[13:09] again? Oh, when I'm in trouble, he's
[13:14] Jehovah, the great enforcer. God
[13:19] Almighty will fight your battles.
[13:23] Oh yes, he'll stand for
[13:27] you. Oh, your victory will come, but not
[13:31] the way you think it
[13:33] [Music]
[13:34] should. Just love's a paradox. Stay in
[13:38] your position and watch the
[13:41] miraculous come into
[13:45] action. Our God is tremendous. The
[13:49] strength never faileth. goes through the
[13:52] fire just to save a sinner. He
[13:57] almighty sends his
[13:59] angels to guide
[14:03] me. There's no storm too powerful. Our
[14:07] God cannot handle. Our God in simplicity
[14:11] revealed and you and me came down from
[14:14] his glory. Gave us the victory. the
[14:18] greatest love
[14:23] story. He never promised that the cross
[14:27] would not get heavy and the hill would
[14:31] not be hard to
[14:34] [Music]
[14:37] climb. He never
[14:39] offered victories without fighting. He
[14:43] said, "Help put over. Come in
[14:48] time." Oh, just remember where you're
[14:52] standing in the valley of
[14:56] decision. And the adversary says, "Give
[15:01] in. Just hold
[15:05] on. Our Lord will show up." Yes, he
[15:08] will. and he will take you through the
[15:12] fire
[15:16] again. So many times the
[15:19] question certain
[15:22] circumstances and things I could not
[15:26] understand. How many's ever been there?
[15:28] I know I have. And many times in
[15:32] trials, my weakness blurs my
[15:35] vision and my frustration gets so out of
[15:39] hand. Oh my, it's then, but it's then I
[15:44] am
[15:45] reminded. I've never been
[15:48] forsaken. I've never had to stand one
[15:52] test alone. Thank you, Lord. That's when
[15:56] I look at all the victories. The spirit
[16:00] rises up in me and through the fire my
[16:04] weakness is made strong. He never
[16:08] promised. He never promised that the
[16:12] cross would not get heavy and the hill
[16:16] would not be hard to climb.
[16:19] [Music]
[16:22] He never offered a victory without
[16:26] fighting. But he said, "Help would
[16:29] always come in
[16:32] time." Just remember where you're
[16:36] standing in the valley of
[16:40] decision and the adversary. Sister
[16:43] Tracy, do you have a song
[16:45] tonight? Just hold
[16:49] on. Our Lord will show
[16:52] up and he will take you through the
[16:56] fire
[16:58] again. Let's go to
[17:01] heaven. He promised to hold my hand. He
[17:07] promised he would help me stand when the
[17:11] valleys too low and the rivers too wide.
[17:15] He promised he would lead me to the
[17:18] other side. His promises light my way.
[17:24] Never let my feet to
[17:27] stray. Living on his word, I will
[17:32] overcome. Standing on his promises. One
[17:35] by one more time. He promised to hold my
[17:40] hand. He promised he would help me stand
[17:45] when the valley's too low and the rivers
[17:48] too wide. He promised he would lead me
[17:51] to the other side. He promised to light
[17:56] my way. Never let my feet to stray.
[18:03] Living on his word, I will
[18:06] overcome. Standing on his promises. One
[18:09] more time now. Oh, he promised to hold
[18:13] my hand. He promised he would
[18:18] help when the valleys too low and the
[18:22] rivers too wide. He promised he would
[18:25] lead me to the other side. He promised
[18:29] to light my way. Never let my feet to a
[18:36] stray. Living on his word, I will
[18:40] overcome. Standing on his promises one
[18:44] by
[18:48] one. Hallelujah.
[18:50] God bless you. God bless you, Sister
[18:52] Tracy. Amen. Brother Josh, you guys have
[18:56] a soul for tonight. All right.
[19:13] He came to
[19:17] earth a
[19:20] promise to fulfill.
[19:25] [Music]
[19:27] A
[19:28] rugged
[19:32] cross he bore up
[19:36] Calary's hill.
[19:42] and for my
[19:45] sins. He cried,
[19:49] "Father,
[19:55] forive, born to
[20:01] die, that I might live."
[20:08] He was
[20:10] accused of
[20:12] [Music]
[20:13] sin yet
[20:16] silent
[20:17] he
[20:19] [Music]
[20:23] remained. No one came
[20:29] forth to
[20:31] witness for his name.
[20:39] between two
[20:43] thieves. He bowed his
[20:46] head and
[20:53] cried. Finish
[20:58] now. I came to die.
[21:06] Born to
[21:10] die, a
[21:12] cruel cross to
[21:15] [Music]
[21:18] bear. Born to
[21:23] die, that I his love may share.
[21:33] Born to
[21:36] die. His
[21:38] precious life to
[21:45] give. Born to
[21:51] die that I might live.
[21:59] Born to
[22:02] die, a
[22:04] cruel cross to
[22:11] bear. Born to
[22:15] die, that I his love may
[22:21] [Music]
[22:23] share. He was born to
[22:28] die. His
[22:30] precious life to
[22:37] give. Born to
[22:43] die that
[22:45] I might
[22:49] live. Amen.
[22:54] Amen. Did you enjoy
[22:56] that? So glad
[22:58] he came down to die so I can live. Amen.
[23:02] As brother Josh gets ready, can we go to
[23:05] F? Just love this.
[23:08] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[23:14] [Music]
[23:19] Oh, how I love
[23:27] Jesus.
[23:30] Oh, how
[23:32] I love
[23:34] [Music]
[23:38] Jesus
[23:40] because he first. Can we go up a key of
[23:44] me? Sing it once again
[23:47] now. Oh, and
[23:51] oh, how
[23:54] I love
[23:59] Jesus.
[24:02] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[24:09] [Music]
[24:13] So how I
[24:17] love
[24:20] is
[24:22] because he
[24:25] first loved
[24:29] me. God bless you
[24:36] now. Amen. You love the Lord this
[24:38] evening.
[24:57] tomorrow. I just
[25:01] live from day to
[25:05] day. I don't
[25:10] from
[25:13] it. For the
[25:16] skies may turn to
[25:20] gray. I don't
[25:24] worry or the
[25:28] future for I
[25:31] know what Jesus said.
[25:36] And
[25:38] today I walk beside
[25:43] him for he
[25:46] knows what is ahead.
[25:50] Yes. Many
[25:54] things about
[25:56] [Music]
[25:58] tomorrow I don't
[26:01] seem to
[26:06] understand. But I
[26:09] know who holds tomorrow.
[26:14] And I
[26:16] know who holds my hand.
[26:22] Every
[26:24] step is getting
[26:28] brighter as the
[26:32] golden stairs are
[26:36] climb. Every
[26:40] birden getting lighter.
[26:45] Every
[26:45] [Music]
[26:47] cloud is silver
[26:51] light there. The
[26:55] sun is always
[26:59] shining there. No
[27:02] tear will dim the
[27:07] eye at the
[27:10] ending of the rainbow.
[27:15] Where the
[27:16] [Music]
[27:18] mountains touch the sky.
[27:22] Many
[27:24] [Music]
[27:25] things about tomorrow
[27:30] I don't
[27:33] seem to understand.
[27:38] But I
[27:40] know who holds tomorrow.
[27:45] And I
[27:48] know who holds my
[27:52] hand. I don't
[27:55] know about
[27:58] [Music]
[27:59] tomorrow. It may
[28:03] bring me poverty.
[28:08] But the
[28:10] one who feeds the
[28:15] sparrow is the
[28:18] one who stands by me.
[28:23] And the
[28:25] path that be my
[28:30] portion may be
[28:31] [Music]
[28:33] through the flame or
[28:37] flood but his
[28:41] presence goes before
[28:45] me and I'm
[28:49] covered with his blood.
[28:53] Many
[28:54] [Music]
[28:56] things about tomorrow
[29:01] I don't
[29:03] seem to
[29:08] understand. But I
[29:11] know who holds tomorrow.
[29:16] And I
[29:19] know who holds my
[29:23] hand many
[29:26] things about tomorrow.
[29:31] I don't
[29:34] seem to
[29:38] understand, but I
[29:41] know who holds
[29:45] tomorrow. And I
[29:49] know who holds my hand.
[30:01] Amen. What an assurance.
[30:04] Amen. So glad he knows my tomorrow. He
[30:07] holds my hand. And that's why we can
[30:09] sing that song as we sang earlier
[30:11] through it all. Learn to trust him
[30:13] because he's always been faithful and
[30:15] true. Amen. As we stand to our feet now,
[30:18] get ready for the man of God. Was
[30:20] thinking of this song
[30:21] today. Um can we do that? Stand still
[30:25] and let God move. Stand still. I'm not
[30:28] sure the key. Probably F or G, I would
[30:30] imagine.
[30:32] Stand
[30:35] still and let God
[30:39] move. Standing
[30:41] [Music]
[30:43] still. It's hard to
[30:46] [Music]
[30:48] do. When you feel you have reached the
[30:52] end, he'll make a way for
[30:56] you. Stand
[30:58] still. Can we go up a key? God
[31:03] move. Stand
[31:05] [Music]
[31:07] still and let God
[31:11] move. Standing
[31:14] still is hard to do.
[31:20] When it feels you have reached the end,
[31:24] he'll make a way for
[31:27] you. Stand
[31:30] still and let God move once again now.
[31:35] Oh, stand
[31:37] still. Yes, Lord. And let God
[31:42] move. Standing
[31:46] still. It's hard to
[31:51] do. When it feels you have reached the
[31:55] end, you'll make a way for
[31:59] you. Stand
[32:00] [Music]
[32:02] still and let God move. Do you think we
[32:05] can do those verses? Oh, the Father has
[32:09] a
[32:10] plan. Though it's hard to see it
[32:14] now and you feel you're walking all
[32:18] alone, but he is there no
[32:22] doubt. When the storm around you
[32:26] rages and you're tossed to and
[32:30] fro, when you're faced with life's
[32:34] decision, not sure which way to go,
[32:38] stand still. That's my prayer tonight.
[32:42] Lord, help me to stand
[32:44] still. Oh, standing
[32:48] still is hard to

[36:05] so brother Josh he says I'll come. Amen.
[36:08] God bless you for that. And even asked
[36:12] for us to come but uh uh we just just
[36:15] couldn't couldn't quite do that. We're
[36:17] we're still doing some work on Austin's
[36:20] house and and um so but we want to we
[36:24] want to be praying for brother and uh
[36:27] for the for the camp there, the
[36:28] Louisiana camp. We sure appreciate the
[36:31] brother brother Tim Puit and and his
[36:34] love for the young people that he has
[36:35] had for uh that you know been going for
[36:39] many many years and and and a lot of our
[36:42] our young families u the individuals uh
[36:46] were uh many were baptized with the Holy
[36:50] Ghost there in in that camp. And so, um,
[36:53] the Louisiana camp has a has a great
[36:57] just a real soft spot in our hearts.
[37:00] Let's let's look here. I did I tell you
[37:03] guys, um, did I tell y'all Romans or did
[37:05] I even give y'all a scripture yet? Uh,
[37:07] let's let's look here in Isaiah
[37:11] 54. Isaiah 54. And
[37:15] um, we are uh, we'll just start here at
[37:20] the first verse.
[37:22] Amen. Isaiah 54:1. Sing, O baron, thou
[37:26] that d not bear. Break forth into
[37:30] singing and cry aloud. Thou that did not
[37:33] prevail with child, travail with child.
[37:37] For more are the children of the
[37:38] desolate than the children of the
[37:40] married, the wives, sayaith the Lord.
[37:42] Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let
[37:44] them stretch forth the curtains of thine
[37:46] inhabitations.
[37:48] Um, spare not, lengthen thy cords, and
[37:52] strengthen thy stakes. For thou shalt
[37:54] break forth on the right hand, and on
[37:57] the left, and thy seed shall inherit the
[38:00] Gentiles, and make the desolate cities
[38:03] to be inhabited. Fear not, for thou
[38:05] shalt not be ashamed, neither be thou
[38:09] confounded, for thou shalt not be put to
[38:12] shame. For thou shalt forget the shame
[38:15] of thy youth, and shalt not remember the
[38:19] reproach of thy widowhood anymore. For
[38:22] thy maker is thine husband, the Lord of
[38:24] hosts is his name. Thy redeemer, the
[38:27] holy one of Israel, the God of the whole
[38:30] earth shall be called. For the Lord hath
[38:34] called thee as a woman forsaken and
[38:36] grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth,
[38:40] when thou was refused, saith thy God.
[38:44] For a small moment have I forsaken thee,
[38:46] but with great mercies will I gather
[38:49] thee. In a little wrath I hid my face
[38:52] from thee, for a moment, but with
[38:55] everlasting kindness will I have mercy
[38:58] on thee, saith the Lord thy redeemer.
[39:01] For this is as the waters of Noah unto
[39:03] me. For as I have sworn that the waters
[39:06] of Noah should no more go over the
[39:09] earth, so have I sworn that I would not
[39:12] be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For
[39:15] the mountains shall depart, and the
[39:17] hills be removed, but my kindness shall
[39:21] not depart from thee. Neither shall the
[39:24] covenant of my peace be removed, saith
[39:26] the Lord, that hath mercy on thee. Oh
[39:29] thou afflicted, tossed in tempest and
[39:32] not comforted. Behold, I will lay thy
[39:36] stones with fair colors, and lay thy
[39:38] foundations with sapphires. I will make
[39:41] thy windows of a gates, and thy gates of
[39:45] car uh carbon barnles, carbunles, and
[39:48] all thy borders of pleasant stones, and
[39:51] all thy children shall be taught of the
[39:53] Lord, and great shall be the peace of
[39:56] thy children. In righteousness shalt
[39:59] thou be established, and thou shalt be
[40:01] far from oppression. For thou shalt not
[40:04] fear, and from terror, for it shall not
[40:07] come near thee. Behold, they shall
[40:09] surely gather together, but not by me.
[40:13] Whosoever shall gather together against
[40:16] thee shall fall by for thy sake. Behold,
[40:19] I have created the smith that bloweth
[40:21] the coals in the fire, that bringeth
[40:23] forth an instrument for his work, and I
[40:27] have created the waster to destroy. For
[40:30] no weapon shall form that is formed
[40:32] against thee shall prosper, and every
[40:35] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[40:38] judgment shalt thou condemn. This is the
[40:41] heritage of the servants of the Lord,
[40:44] and their righteousness is of me, saith
[40:47] the Lord. And can the church say amen?
[40:50] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[40:52] we thank you for your grace and your
[40:54] mercies upon our life. Lord, we thank
[40:58] you for the spirit of the Lord that is

[41:49] and31. Say then to these things. If God

[44:01] is saying it doesn't matter the weapons
[44:04] that are coming against you. It doesn't
[44:07] matter the terrorists. It doesn't
[44:09] matter, Amen. the axis of of evil that
[44:12] comes out of hell. Amen. There is no
[44:16] weapon that is formed against the bride
[44:19] of Jesus Christ that will ever prevail.

[44:33] filled with the Holy Ghost, Amen. The
[44:36] scripture says that you are sealed until
[44:38] the day of your redemption. Amen. You're

[45:38] there is a devil, there's always going
[45:40] to be evil. As long as these things are

[45:47] that is on this earth. you you cannot

[47:51] Matter of fact, a Christian doesn't look
[47:52] at things the way they used to. Amen.
[47:55] The the scripture says that Amen. we'd
[47:57] be of all men most miserable if we had
[48:00] hope only in this life. But we don't
[48:03] have hope only in this life. It doesn't

[48:27] soldiers that were guarding you all the
[48:29] time. You could you could have all the
[48:31] wealth and the riches of this land.
[48:32] Amen. But if your soul does not have

[48:52] is no way for you to be safe outside of
[48:57] the Lord Jesus Christ.

[49:00] there is an onslaught, amen, of the
[49:03] enemy against your soul. Amen. He's
[49:06] against your soul. Every one of you, the
[49:08] enemy is against your soul. And there's
[49:11] where there's there's where the world is
[49:13] falling apart. Is because they're
[49:15] they're they're looking at the economy.
[49:17] They're looking at amen at these things
[49:20] to try to to make you and your life uh h
[49:24] better. But you see, no one wants to
[49:26] spend time with that soul. Amen. And it
[49:28] seems like the soul is is sort of just
[49:30] forgot about. Amen. No one spends time
[49:33] at at trying to Amen. realize what's
[49:37] causing my mind to play with me. What's
[49:40] causing my Amen these things to hurt?
[49:43] What what makes my heart struggle? Amen.
[49:46] It's not Amen. the lack of money or the
[49:49] lack of prestige or or the lack of this
[49:52] or that. There is an enemy that is
[49:55] against your soul. There is an enemy
[49:59] that wants to keep you under its
[50:01] control. Well, can you say amen? But
[50:03] Jesus says, "I've come to give you life
[50:06] and I've come to give it to you more
[50:08] abundantly." Hallelujah. Well, glory be
[50:11] to God. Amen. The enemy is there and I
[50:14] want to tell you, they're after your
[50:16] children. They're after your husband.
[50:18] They're after your wife. They're after
[50:19] your heritage. They're after your soul.
[50:21] Can you say amen? But when I hear those
[50:24] words, Amen. No weapon formed against
[50:28] you shall prosper. It makes my heart
[50:32] rejoice. How well can you say? Amen.
[50:35] When the mind battles are there and when
[50:37] the enemy Amen is is trying to convince
[50:40] me otherwise. Amen. God's given me his
[50:44] promise. I'll never leave you. Amen. And
[50:47] I'll be there with you. I've given you
[50:49] my word and I will be faithful. Can you
[50:52] say amen? Amen.
[50:54] No weapon formed. The scripture says,
[50:57] "This is the heritage of the Lord."
[51:00] Amen. And their righteousness is of me.
[51:03] Hallelujah. Won't you just turn to your
[51:05] neighbor right now and just tell them,
[51:06] "No weapon formed. No weapon formed."
[51:09] Hallelujah. Amen. I don't care if the
[51:11] economy takes. I don't care if my
[51:13] girlfriend gives up on me. I don't care
[51:15] if my family disowns me. I don't care if
[51:18] my health fails me. No weapon formed
[51:21] against me shall prosper. Can you say
[51:24] amen? Now, as we read in the first of
[51:27] this 54th chapter, Jerusalem is as a
[51:31] mother, amen, that is weeping for her
[51:34] children. It is symbolic of God putting
[51:37] away Israel. And Israel had been carried
[51:41] away into Babylon. Amen. For 70
[51:44] years. And she had lost her sons and her
[51:47] daughters. And Amen. And she had become
[51:49] like a barren woman without a husband.
[51:52] And and the reason for this is Israel
[51:55] had provoked God. Amen. Through her sin
[51:59] and Amen. and provoked God's anchor. And
[52:02] and according to Ezra 2 and 64, she was
[52:06] reduced down to 42,000 people, which is
[52:10] quite a contrast of the 2.5 million uh
[52:14] people that she was that that came out
[52:16] of Egypt. But now she is reduced down to
[52:19] just amen thousand people. And she truly
[52:23] was a woman that that felt forsaken. And
[52:27] and and I just want to say she was still
[52:29] God's woman. She was still God's people.
[52:33] Even though she was in sin, even though
[52:36] her sins brought her down and amen, and
[52:39] caused her, Amen. to go into captivity.
[52:43] Yet she was still God's predestinated
[52:48] people. And I and I want to say today,
[52:50] hey, amen, that there is no weapon.
[52:53] There's no sin in your life. That
[52:54] doesn't mean that God's not going to
[52:56] deal with you. That doesn't mean that
[52:58] God's not going to whoop you. That
[53:00] doesn't mean that God, Amen, is not
[53:02] going to allow things to, Amen, to come
[53:05] your way. But the thing is, God will
[53:07] always deal with you as a son. He will
[53:10] always deal with you as a daughter. And
[53:12] I just want to say for you young men and
[53:15] young women. Amen. You will pay for your
[53:17] sins. Amen. Mama might not know about
[53:20] it. Daddy might not know about it. The
[53:21] preacher might not know about it. Amen.
[53:24] But I I want to tell you, God will not
[53:27] allow his sons and daughters. He will
[53:30] not allow his bride to continue on in
[53:33] sin.
[53:34] We talk about the faithfulness of God.
[53:36] And God's a good God. And we hear the
[53:39] world talking about, amen, he's good and
[53:41] oh my, he won't. He He was He's not the
[53:44] author of bad. And and he's not the
[53:46] author, amen, of of of evil. And he's
[53:49] not. God is not. But I want to tell you,
[53:52] he can sure turn you loose to the devil,
[53:54] amen, and allow the devil, Amen, to to
[53:57] torment you. And Amen. And and and you
[54:00] go into captivity in your mind.
[54:03] You go into captivity because of your
[54:06] sin. When you play around, you're going
[54:09] to reap what you sow. Can I hear an
[54:12] amen? Amen. You put a You put an apple
[54:15] seed in the ground and you're going to
[54:16] reap an apple tree. You put wheat in the
[54:19] ground, you're going to reap wheat.
[54:21] Amen. You put a you you put broccoli in
[54:24] the ground and you're going to reap
[54:25] broccoli. If you sow evil, you're going
[54:29] to reap evil. Hallelujah. But if you sow
[54:33] good, then you're going to reap good.
[54:35] And Israel had sown evil, and now
[54:39] they're in sin. And and now they're in
[54:42] captivity. The Bible says they are
[54:44] slaves for 70 years. This is the people
[54:47] of God. These people, Amen, were the God
[54:50] were the ones that God chose that God
[54:53] said, "Amen, I've called you with an
[54:55] everlasting call and I love you with an
[54:57] everlasting love." These people are now
[55:01] in sin. Hallelujah. And they're and
[55:04] they're and they're they're they're
[55:05] they're under the captivity. Amen. Of
[55:07] the Babylonians. Amen. And you you read
[55:10] it. Amen. But what did God say? Amen. I
[55:14] know you feel like you're forsaken. And
[55:16] I know you feel like you're a you're a
[55:18] woman without an husband and you're a
[55:21] widow. It feels like your children have
[55:24] all gone. And Amen. Everything is away.
[55:27] But my love for you is still the same.
[55:31] My love for you, well, glory be to God.
[55:35] I want to tell you, you may be in a in
[55:37] in a in a in a in a in a matter of your
[55:39] own making right now because of your
[55:42] rebellious heart, your evil heart. Amen.
[55:45] You walked away from God, and you're
[55:47] reaping it all. It ain't your brother's
[55:49] fault. It ain't your sister's fault.
[55:52] It's your fault. Y'all were the dummy.
[55:55] You were the one that walked against the
[55:57] command of God. But you know what? God
[55:59] is still there saying, "I love you with
[56:02] an everlasting love. I love you with an
[56:05] everlasting love. And my love will never
[56:09] depart from you." Hallelujah. Amen. Oh,
[56:14] hallelujah. That's a faithful God.
[56:16] That's a That's a faithful God. Amen. I
[56:19] I I You see, I'm glad for the
[56:21] faithfulness of God. I'm glad God
[56:23] doesn't just allow me to go on and and
[56:25] let me be defeated. But when God says,
[56:27] "I've called you and you're my chosen
[56:29] people and you start acting contrary,
[56:32] amen, to what God has called," it is the
[56:34] grace of God. It's the mercies of God,
[56:36] amen, to bring you back in line with his
[56:39] word. God is faithful to you.
[56:44] Can you say amen?
[56:47] Now, amen. He looked at him. God's
[56:50] affectionately calling to Israel. I love
[56:52] that 54th verse or chapter because it's
[56:56] God telling a people, amen, that has
[57:01] been they they have been all but
[57:03] destroyed.
[57:04] The these people have suffered greatly.
[57:08] But the affection of God, he's calling
[57:11] out and says before the Chaldesian
[57:14] invasion and Amen. consequent
[57:17] captivity before your stubbornness and
[57:20] that separated you from
[57:22] me. You were my bride.
[57:25] This is God looking to his bride Jehovah
[57:28] and saying you were my people. You were
[57:31] my bride and I I I loved you. Can you
[57:35] say amen? Amen. And he says you've come
[57:38] back broken and you've come back
[57:40] bruised.
[57:42] You've suffered embarrassment and amen.
[57:45] You have borne the reproach of your
[57:46] failings,
[57:48] but I've come to redeem you back to
[57:50] myself. Hallelujah. I love you with an
[57:53] everlasting love. Well, praise the Lord.
[57:56] I want you to enlarge the your tents and
[58:00] and I want you to make your In other
[58:02] words, I want you to make your home
[58:03] bigger and I want to make you you to
[58:06] make your heart bigger. I know your
[58:08] children that but I'm going to bring
[58:10] your children back to you and I'm going
[58:12] to show you my love and I'm going to I
[58:15] I'm I'm going to make you amen nation
[58:18] again and restoration is coming. And
[58:21] he's he's not just telling them amen
[58:24] that I'm going to I'm going to redeem
[58:26] you but he says I want you to make a
[58:28] bigger house. I want you to make bigger
[58:30] rooms. I want you to start preparing
[58:33] because my desire, my predestinated
[58:37] plan, I'm going to keep.
[58:42] It don't look like it's possible with
[58:44] you right now, but I promise you, I've
[58:48] got a a a a wonderful end for you in my
[58:53] mind. Amen. Well, that might not mean
[58:56] much for for for for a lot of you that's
[58:58] never fallen, but it means a whole lot
[59:00] for somebody. Amen. Who's just looking
[59:02] for a way to come back? Looking for a
[59:04] way to be restored. Looking for a way
[59:07] when it's hard. Listen, it's hard to be
[59:10] restored. It's hard to come back. It's
[59:12] hard. You've got every demon in hell
[59:15] telling you, amen, that you belong in
[59:17] captivity, that you don't belong in
[59:19] freedom, and that that land does not
[59:21] belong to you. But when God comes back
[59:24] and tells you, "Amen, I've allowed the
[59:27] child in. I've allowed your captivity.
[59:30] I've brought it on to you. But I'm
[59:32] telling you, I'm bringing you back
[59:35] because I've got an everlasting call for
[59:38] you."
[59:41] Hallelujah. Can you say amen? That
[59:44] fourth verse, fear not. For thou shalt
[59:46] not be ashamed, neither be thou
[59:49] confounded, for thou shalt not be put to
[59:51] shame.
[59:52] For
[59:54] thou shalt forget the shame of thy
[59:57] youth, and thou shalt not remember the
[59:59] reproach of thy widowhood anymore. For
[1:00:02] thy maker is thine husband, and the Lord
[1:00:06] of hosts is his name. And thy redeemer,
[1:00:09] the Holy One of Israel, the God of the
[1:00:11] whole earth, shall he be called. For the
[1:00:13] Lord, hath called thee as a woman,
[1:00:15] forsaken, and grieved in spirit, a wife
[1:00:18] of youth. When thou was refused, saith
[1:00:21] thy God, for a small moment have I
[1:00:24] forsaken thee, but with great mercy,
[1:00:27] someone shout hallelujah, will I gather
[1:00:31] thee. In a little wrath I hid my face
[1:00:34] from thee for a moment, but with
[1:00:37] everlasting kindness. That's your time
[1:00:40] to shout. Amen. With
[1:00:44] everlasting kindness will I have mercy
[1:00:48] on thee, saith the Lord, thy redeemer.
[1:00:53] Oh, glory to God. You know, Amen. I I
[1:00:57] know this is just a Wednesday night, but
[1:00:58] you can still feel good on a Wednesday
[1:01:00] night. Amen. God loves to renew. God
[1:01:03] loves to restore. God loves Amen. to
[1:01:07] bring you back. God loves to
[1:01:09] reinvigorate. God loves to take you when
[1:01:12] you're weary and you're tired. And God
[1:01:14] loves to bring his promise back to you.
[1:01:18] Can you say
[1:01:20] amen for you kids
[1:01:23] here? You know, I we we preach of the
[1:01:28] mercies of
[1:01:30] God and the mercies of God are
[1:01:33] incredible. And you also hear us
[1:01:35] preaching, amen,
[1:01:38] of you know Sometimes some messages are
[1:01:41] hell, fire, and
[1:01:42] brimstone. And and you wonder, well,
[1:01:45] which which one do we believe? Well,
[1:01:48] you're going to live
[1:01:49] both. Here on this earth, you're going
[1:01:51] to live
[1:01:52] both because when you walk away from
[1:01:56] God, you're going to reap what you sow.
[1:02:01] Amen. You're going to receive. The Bible
[1:02:03] says that God Amen. He
[1:02:07] chastises. He spanks and corrects every
[1:02:12] one of his sons.
[1:02:14] And he says, "And if you are not with
[1:02:17] correction and you refuse to be
[1:02:19] corrected by God," Amen. The Bible just
[1:02:22] calls you a bastard. True. Amen. So,
[1:02:26] you're going that that shows you that
[1:02:29] you're going to have some mistakes in
[1:02:32] your life.
[1:02:34] And you're going to be whooped for it.
[1:02:37] And the best thing that you could ever
[1:02:39] do is say, "Lord, Amen. I'm sorry." And
[1:02:42] admit when you're wrong. Amen. And ask
[1:02:45] God to help you to make a right.
[1:02:49] But don't you ever forget who you are.
[1:02:53] Even when you're in the woodshed.
[1:02:56] Hallelujah.
[1:02:58] Don't you ever forget who you are. Amen.
[1:03:01] when you're sitting there in in in in
[1:03:04] the mess of your own making. You made
[1:03:06] the mess. It ain't nobody's fault but
[1:03:08] yours. You're the one that rebelled
[1:03:10] against God. And now you're suffering
[1:03:13] the consequences of that rebellion.
[1:03:17] And it is God that wasn't going to allow
[1:03:20] you to succeed in your rebellion.
[1:03:23] Well, praise the Lord. The serpent's
[1:03:25] children, they just do it and they don't
[1:03:27] care. And it they get blessed by it, but
[1:03:29] God's not going to let you get blessed
[1:03:30] by it because you're his son. You're his
[1:03:33] daughter. You're his bride. Well, can
[1:03:36] you say amen? But you see the mercies of
[1:03:39] God. Even in the trial, my trial, my my
[1:03:44] spanking, if if you will, sometimes I'm
[1:03:47] in a spanking. Amen. Even when God Amen.
[1:03:51] His wrath I he hallelujah his patience
[1:03:54] wears out just like your mas and daddies
[1:03:57] sometimes where Amen he'll give you the
[1:03:59] warning once or twice and and then all
[1:04:01] of a sudden he's going to get
[1:04:03] his he's not one of those daddies like
[1:04:06] we are today. Amen. Don't believe in
[1:04:07] spanking their children. Amen. Matter of
[1:04:10] fact, he says he says spank them.
[1:04:12] They'll surely not die. Hallelujah.
[1:04:14] That's the way that's the way God says
[1:04:16] it. And if and if he's telling parents
[1:04:18] to do that, well, he's the parent of all
[1:04:20] parents. He says, if you give respect
[1:04:22] unto your your earthly father, how much
[1:04:26] more should you have respect for your
[1:04:28] heavenly father, honor him and respect
[1:04:32] him and live?
[1:04:34] Can you say amen? Amen. But the thing
[1:04:38] that he's looking for is he knows who
[1:04:41] you are.
[1:04:42] He knows that you you come from him. He
[1:04:47] knows that you are his and that he is
[1:04:51] your father. And you know what he's
[1:04:53] going to do? I promise you, he's never
[1:04:55] going to give up on his sons and his
[1:04:57] daughters. He's going to keep on
[1:04:59] correcting them. And I and I and I just
[1:05:01] want to give you a little bit of Amen. A
[1:05:03] side note here. the quicker that you can
[1:05:05] understand, amen, that you're an idiot
[1:05:07] and that God knows what he is trying to
[1:05:09] do in your life and you admit that
[1:05:11] you're the idiot and you admit that you
[1:05:14] are wrong and that you need God, amen,
[1:05:16] the quicker you're going to come forth
[1:05:18] in life, especially in the presence of
[1:05:20] God.
[1:05:23] Well, can you say amen?
[1:05:26] You
[1:05:27] see, the Bible says there in
[1:05:30] Isaiah, Amen
[1:05:32] 40, he talks about the
[1:05:35] renewing.
[1:05:38] Amen. You see, God allows you to fall
[1:05:40] flat on your face so that you can see
[1:05:43] yourself that you're a failure to begin
[1:05:46] with.
[1:05:48] He He allows you to fall on your face.
[1:05:51] Amen. That you so that you can find that
[1:05:53] you can't
[1:05:55] that you you can come to your senses.
[1:05:58] And I love it there in Isaiah 40 and 29.
[1:06:02] He says, "I'll give power unto the
[1:06:05] faint." Amen. And to them that has no
[1:06:09] might, he'll increase their
[1:06:12] strength. Amen. Amen. The next verse,
[1:06:16] even the youth shall faint and be weary,
[1:06:18] and the young men shall utterly
[1:06:21] fall, but they that wait
[1:06:25] upon the glory,
[1:06:29] shall renew. You know what God's saying?
[1:06:31] I'm a God of restoration.
[1:06:35] But you're going to have to do it God's
[1:06:37] way
[1:06:37] now. You got to do it God's way. Humble
[1:06:41] yourself and God will lift you up. Well,
[1:06:44] that should make you want to shout.
[1:06:46] Amen. Hallelujah. God will forgive their
[1:06:49] sins, heal their land, renew their
[1:06:53] strength, so that they shall mount up as
[1:06:55] eagles. Amen. They shall run and not be
[1:06:58] weary, and they shall walk and not
[1:07:00] faint. Hallelujah. I I think of Joel 2.
[1:07:04] Amen. as he talks about backsliding
[1:07:07] Israel and being symbolic to the church
[1:07:08] and how it was symbolic a man of the
[1:07:11] seven church ages how they wandered from
[1:07:14] Christ and the word and become quite
[1:07:18] independent and
[1:07:21] self-sufficient and and has suffered
[1:07:24] widowhood and and he talks about how
[1:07:26] that the caterpillar and the palmer and
[1:07:30] and the locust and amen these things
[1:07:33] were were eaten away at the tree. And
[1:07:36] God pronounces judgment upon him and he
[1:07:38] says, "I have sent my great army." God
[1:07:40] calls it his great army. I sent my army
[1:07:44] to eat up your tree. That's right.
[1:07:50] But when there was the repentant
[1:07:52] heart, then God says, "But I will
[1:07:56] restore
[1:07:58] all the years that the palmer worm,
[1:08:00] cankerworm, caterpillar, the locust has
[1:08:04] has eaten. I will restore that tree,
[1:08:07] saith the Lord." I don't want you living
[1:08:10] under the condemnation. I want you to
[1:08:13] accept. Amen. I want you to catch where
[1:08:17] you've been, what you've gone through,
[1:08:20] and that I've got a plan for your life
[1:08:22] that is greater than anything that you
[1:08:24] think you've got to offer.
[1:08:27] Well, praise the Lord. Can you say amen?
[1:08:31] Hallelujah. And when God looks to them,
[1:08:34] now now he's just talking about it and
[1:08:35] and and if you were to go on down, Amen.
[1:08:38] When you go on down to Joel uh 2 and
[1:08:43] 18, now he he's he's they
[1:08:48] they this is this this is just another
[1:08:50] time where Israel as
[1:08:53] Yes, they've been doofuses.
[1:08:58] But God has finally got Listen, when God
[1:09:00] pulls his spirit from
[1:09:02] you, that that's not the time to go to
[1:09:05] pretending. That's the time to start
[1:09:07] begging for mercy.
[1:09:09] When when that's when that presence
[1:09:11] isn't there like you know it should be.
[1:09:14] God's lifted his spirit for some reason.
[1:09:17] And we've got to go and start asking
[1:09:19] God, where am I at? What have I done?
[1:09:23] What what Lord I and start examining our
[1:09:27] heart and taking the blood of Jesus
[1:09:28] Christ and start doing a little bit of
[1:09:30] washing. Well, can you say amen? Amen.
[1:09:32] But watch watch God's attitude. there in
[1:09:36] Joel 2 and 18. Yay, the Lord will answer
[1:09:39] and say unto his
[1:09:40] people, behold, I will send you corn and
[1:09:43] wine and oil, and you shall be satisfied
[1:09:47] therewith, and I will no more make you a
[1:09:50] reproach among the heathen. But I will
[1:09:52] remove far off from you the north army
[1:09:56] and will drive him into a land barren
[1:09:58] and desolate with his face toward the
[1:10:00] east sea and his hinder part toward the
[1:10:02] utmost sea. And his stink shall come up
[1:10:05] and his ill savor shall come up because
[1:10:07] he hath done great things. Fear not, oh
[1:10:09] land, be glad and rejoice, for the Lord
[1:10:12] will do great things. Be not afraid, ye
[1:10:15] beast of the field, for the pastures of
[1:10:17] the wilderness do spring, for the tree
[1:10:19] beareth her fruit. I'm talking about
[1:10:21] restoration. The fig tree and the vine
[1:10:23] do yield their strength. Be glad then,
[1:10:26] ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the
[1:10:29] Lord your God, for he hath given you the
[1:10:31] former rain moderately, and he will
[1:10:33] cause to come down upon you for you the
[1:10:36] rain, the former rain, and the latter
[1:10:38] rain. The floor shall be full of wheat,
[1:10:40] and the vats overflow with wine and oil.
[1:10:44] And I will restore to you the years that
[1:10:46] the locust have eaten, the cankerworm
[1:10:48] and the caterpillar and the palmer worm,
[1:10:51] my great army that I sent among you. And
[1:10:54] you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:10:56] satisfied. Well, that's your time to
[1:10:58] start shouting hallelujah.
[1:11:00] And praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:11:02] that hath dealt wondrously with you. And
[1:11:06] my people shall not or shall never be
[1:11:11] shamed. and you will know that I'm in
[1:11:13] the midst of Israel, that I am the Lord
[1:11:15] your God, and none else, and my people
[1:11:20] shall never be ashamed. Can you say
[1:11:22] amen? So, so what what are these
[1:11:25] scriptures, these two scriptures that
[1:11:26] I've shown you? Israel is a type of the
[1:11:30] bride that doesn't always hit it right.
[1:11:35] We don't always hit the mark. And God
[1:11:40] brings us to those situations in our
[1:11:42] lives, amen, where we can't go over
[1:11:44] around or behind or anything else. So
[1:11:47] that God, because he's wanting a certain
[1:11:48] thing out of every one of us, he's
[1:11:51] wanting his glory to be revealed in us.
[1:11:54] And God loves to reinvigorate. God loves
[1:11:57] to renew. God loves to restore. And I
[1:12:00] just want to tell you there wasn't
[1:12:01] nothing that the palm worm that the
[1:12:03] caterpillar that the locust that none of
[1:12:06] those could do to
[1:12:07] destroy God's people. They were simply
[1:12:11] put there. He says I have created the
[1:12:13] waster to destroy. I have created the
[1:12:16] smith. Amen. To to to to heat up the
[1:12:19] fire so that he could bring an
[1:12:22] instrument of his choosing. Hallelujah.
[1:12:25] Oh, that makes me want to shout. God
[1:12:28] brings the fire. God brings the waster.
[1:12:31] God, Amen, takes those things. Amen.
[1:12:33] Because the things that can be destroyed
[1:12:35] in our lives, God wants them destroyed.
[1:12:39] Amen. God wants pride destroyed. God
[1:12:41] wants, Amen. all of these other
[1:12:43] self-dependence and all of those things
[1:12:45] destroyed in our lives. He wants us to
[1:12:49] look to him. He is making something
[1:12:52] beautiful. He is Oh, glory to God. You
[1:12:56] say, "Oh, but I'm in shambles right
[1:12:58] now." Oh, those aren't shambles. Those
[1:13:01] things that are burning around you.
[1:13:03] Amen. They're not eternal. It's your
[1:13:05] soul that is eternal. And God is
[1:13:08] bringing you and he's making you and
[1:13:11] he's creating a masterpiece out of you.
[1:13:15] God allows those things because he's got
[1:13:18] a certain product in mind.
[1:13:29] My pastor when I was growing up, I I
[1:13:31] remember one thing that he had said.
[1:13:34] Hallelujah. He says,
[1:13:36] "Sometimes you try to we try to hide it
[1:13:41] when we when we're getting whooping from
[1:13:42] the Lord or we're going through a trial
[1:13:44] and we try to act like there's nothing
[1:13:47] wrong." He says, you know, he says, '
[1:13:50] And that's the greatest sign that you're
[1:13:52] a son of God.
[1:13:54] That's the greatest. He says, ' Maybe
[1:13:56] the church needs to see that you're a
[1:13:57] son of God, that you're a daughter.
[1:13:59] Well, praise the Lord. Oh, but I've just
[1:14:02] blown it, Brother Wendell. I just I just
[1:14:04] Oh my, how am I ever going to What? What
[1:14:06] if What if God? That's Listen, that's
[1:14:08] the greatest sign. Well, can you say
[1:14:10] amen? Amen. I I I've been I've been I've
[1:14:14] been spanked a lot of times from the
[1:14:16] Lord. Hallelujah. And and when I when
[1:14:18] you're getting spanked from the Lord,
[1:14:20] Amen. You don't want to lift up your
[1:14:21] head and you don't want to lift up your
[1:14:23] hands and you don't want to Well, praise
[1:14:25] the Lord. Amen. Matters of fact, you're
[1:14:28] it's easy to get into that woe is me and
[1:14:30] everything else. But God says, "No, I've
[1:14:32] given you my word and I expect." Can you
[1:14:35] say amen? Amen. But I've got to say that
[1:14:38] the situations of my life, hey, this is
[1:14:40] a Wednesday night. Praise the Lord. the
[1:14:42] situations of my life that I have gone
[1:14:45] through where I have I I where God has
[1:14:49] given me such
[1:14:53] um incredible spankings. Hallelujah.
[1:14:56] Amen. I've got to say I don't ever want
[1:14:58] to go back through it again, but I will
[1:15:00] tell you that God has brought me out on
[1:15:03] the other side with more character. He's
[1:15:06] brought me out on the other side with a
[1:15:08] greater love for him, a greater respect
[1:15:11] for him. Can you say amen? God loves to
[1:15:17] restore, to renew, to reinvigorate.
[1:15:21] Well, glory be to God. Amen. Can you say
[1:15:24] amen? Hallelujah. Brother Brandham would
[1:15:27] say now brothers or you say he was he
[1:15:30] was in the prayer and he said he says
[1:15:33] you say brother Brandham I'm sick and
[1:15:35] tired of these little old things and I
[1:15:39] got petty petty things that's hung on me
[1:15:42] so long. I'm always talking out of turn.
[1:15:45] I'm doing things I shouldn't do. I know
[1:15:47] it's not becoming to a Christian. I
[1:15:50] don't want to do that. God knows I
[1:15:52] don't. I don't want to listen to that
[1:15:53] old spirit anymore. It's the thing
[1:15:56] that's kept me down all my life from
[1:15:59] having real love and real freedom in
[1:16:01] Christ. I want you to pray for me,
[1:16:04] brother Brandham, that'll leave me this
[1:16:06] day. He says, "Will you raise your
[1:16:08] hands, every head bowed, God bless you,
[1:16:10] oh my dozens of hands, little old petty
[1:16:13] things, little old things that make you
[1:16:16] talk or start some kind of a little of
[1:16:18] fussing in the church, make you take
[1:16:21] sides of something on this side or
[1:16:24] another like that." And that, oh, that's
[1:16:27] ungodly. That's discord among brethren.
[1:16:30] Don't do that. You don't want to do
[1:16:33] that. You don't want to do that. and the
[1:16:35] little old things, your little tempers
[1:16:37] and everything else to keep you down.
[1:16:40] Say, "God, I don't want that thing no
[1:16:42] more. I'm sick and tired of it. I'm
[1:16:45] ready today to discard it. I'm coming
[1:16:47] now, Lord. I want to get away from all
[1:16:50] my selfishness. If my brother doesn't
[1:16:52] treat me right, I'll pray for him
[1:16:54] anyhow. If my daddy doesn't treat me
[1:16:56] right, I'll love him anyhow. If my wife
[1:16:59] doesn't treat me right, or my husband,
[1:17:01] I'll go about humble before God." Lord,
[1:17:04] I look only to your kingdom. I want my
[1:17:07] mind straight. I want my heart full of
[1:17:10] joy. I want to go about when trouble is
[1:17:12] really buzzing around me. I still want
[1:17:15] to stand with my hands up, my heart pure
[1:17:18] before you, Lord, knowing this that
[1:17:20] someday I'll meet you and I want that
[1:17:23] kind of experience. Lord, make me that
[1:17:28] from this day. I wonder if there's
[1:17:30] anybody that could say amen to that.
[1:17:34] Let me be that kind. Help me, Lord. Fill
[1:17:37] in the blanks. But brother Brandham, hey
[1:17:39] man, it's in this or that. Those things
[1:17:43] that we have
[1:17:46] allowed. Pride is what does those things
[1:17:49] and pride is what won't is is the thing
[1:17:51] that won't allow Leo to see it or
[1:17:53] repent. But yet the elect of the
[1:17:55] Leoysian age, the zeal of the age is
[1:17:58] repentance.
[1:18:00] And the power of the age is restoration.
[1:18:05] The zeal of the age is God, I'm wrong.
[1:18:08] The power of the age is going back to
[1:18:12] Adam and Eve. The
[1:18:15] authority, come on, church. The zeal of
[1:18:18] the age, the requirement of this age is
[1:18:23] I'm wrong.
[1:18:25] And the anointing of the age is that
[1:18:29] rapture anointing to take us back. Not
[1:18:32] just back, Amen. to when we were first
[1:18:35] Christians. Not just back to where uh
[1:18:39] the first church, but all the way back
[1:18:41] in the to the mind of God. what he saw
[1:18:44] of you in the beginning, reigning on
[1:18:47] this earth over every devil, every
[1:18:50] power, living in a perfect body, living
[1:18:54] with freedom from mind battles, living
[1:18:56] freedom from every kind of the devil.
[1:19:03] God's allow.
[1:19:05] Can you say amen?
[1:19:08] Everyone say it with me. No weapon
[1:19:10] formed no weapon formed against me
[1:19:14] against me shall prosper
[1:19:18] God is
[1:19:20] using the de devil can do whatever he
[1:19:23] wants to do but all he's doing is
[1:19:24] drawing you closer
[1:19:28] well praise the Lord
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:33] Amen. If God be for
[1:19:36] us, who can be against us? Can you say
[1:19:40] amen? Now, as I bring this to a
[1:19:45] close, it is God
[1:19:47] who says to the elect now, and we could
[1:19:49] go on I could go through Samson. I we
[1:19:51] could go through we we could go through
[1:19:52] many of these of these of these deals,
[1:19:55] but we're not but you catch my drift.
[1:19:58] But it is God. It it is it it is God the
[1:20:02] Apostle Paul talking about God's
[1:20:05] mind and and and and and the Apostle
[1:20:09] Paul when we look
[1:20:12] there amen there in Romans
[1:20:15] 8:31 it says what shall we say then to
[1:20:18] these
[1:20:20] things if God be for us
[1:20:26] who can be against us 33rd verse Who
[1:20:30] shall
[1:20:31] lay
[1:20:33] anything to the
[1:20:36] charge of God's elect?
[1:20:39] It is Christ. It is God that justifies.
[1:20:46] Who is he that condemns
[1:20:52] us people? Us us guys who have who blow
[1:20:56] it over and over and
[1:20:58] over. But yet when God is looking at you
[1:21:01] and God's talking about everyone else,
[1:21:03] he's saying, "Who is he that's
[1:21:05] condemning you? I'm the one that's
[1:21:07] justified."
[1:21:09] Did you know the greatest thing that
[1:21:11] ever that we that for for every one of
[1:21:13] us to
[1:21:14] overcome? It's not me overcoming you or
[1:21:17] overcoming your your your
[1:21:19] your failure to me.
[1:21:22] I I you know, I'm I'm one of those guys
[1:21:24] that I know I'm going to fall and I know
[1:21:27] you're going to fall and so I'm just I
[1:21:28] want to be quick to forgive because I
[1:21:31] want you to forgive me, too. That's just
[1:21:33] the way it is. And I want to work very
[1:21:36] hard to not to to to to not hurt
[1:21:38] anybody, right? That's the way we all
[1:21:42] want to. and and for and and and and if
[1:21:44] and if I've got this attitude toward you
[1:21:46] and I'm I'm I'm carrying a grudge
[1:21:48] against you and a grudge against you and
[1:21:49] a grudge, it just shows how
[1:21:51] narrow-minded I am because for me to be
[1:21:54] holding faults against you
[1:21:57] guys. I must think that I'm pretty high.
[1:22:02] I know that I have came out of the same
[1:22:06] lump that you guys have come out of.
[1:22:08] Right.
[1:22:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:13] But you know what's the hardest thing
[1:22:15] for for a Christian? It's not it's not
[1:22:18] forgiving you.
[1:22:23] It's me forgiving me.
[1:22:27] It's you forgiving you.
[1:22:32] I I I have I have more nightmares about
[1:22:36] me hurting or me failing than I've ever
[1:22:39] had about you hurting me. Now, you hurt
[1:22:42] Well, I'm not saying you've hurt
[1:22:44] me. I mean, you we all hurt one another
[1:22:50] and it hurts.
[1:22:53] But there is
[1:22:56] nothing like laying in a bed tossing and
[1:23:00] turning all night because of your
[1:23:03] failures.
[1:23:06] Am I right? Am I the only one that
[1:23:08] fights my that I I that it's the inward
[1:23:11] thing here?
[1:23:13] And the apostle Paul is telling
[1:23:17] us, who is it that is condemning you?
[1:23:22] It is Christ who died. It is Christ who
[1:23:26] has justified you. It is Christ who has
[1:23:29] put you in his book.
[1:23:32] It is Christ.
[1:23:39] How can how can daddy love me and still
[1:23:42] spank me?
[1:23:47] It's because of his love that he does
[1:23:51] spank you.
[1:23:53] It's because of mama's love that she
[1:23:56] does spank
[1:23:58] him. But what's the purpose behind it?
[1:24:04] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:24:07] I never spank my boys just to get
[1:24:08] pleasure.
[1:24:10] I spank my
[1:24:12] boys because
[1:24:16] they they need some growing
[1:24:19] up. They they I I I want I I I want them
[1:24:22] to become good
[1:24:24] men. Well, praise the
[1:24:26] Lord. Amen.
[1:24:30] So, as I as I as we wind it down here
[1:24:33] tonight,
[1:24:35] Lord, when I look in the
[1:24:38] mirror and I
[1:24:41] see, it's easy for me to say, "Lord,
[1:24:44] renew my brother. Renew my sister.
[1:24:46] Lord, be good to
[1:24:49] him." But it's time for us to go to the
[1:24:52] Lord in prayer and ask the Lord, "Give
[1:24:55] me grace.
[1:25:01] to forgive myself.
[1:25:04] Give me
[1:25:05] grace because
[1:25:07] ultimately the Lord is the one who is up
[1:25:10] is who has who has seen your
[1:25:13] uprisings and your
[1:25:15] downsittings. And I just want to let you
[1:25:17] know the psalmist the psalmist who who
[1:25:20] was one of the greatest men. I love I
[1:25:23] love David. I love David because I can
[1:25:27] see myself in David so many times. Hey,
[1:25:30] I love Peter because I can see Wendle
[1:25:32] Martin and Peter so many times. I you
[1:25:34] know, right?
[1:25:40] But I loved
[1:25:42] it when David was saying, "If I should
[1:25:45] rise in the early of the mornings, or if
[1:25:48] I should rise on the wings of the
[1:25:49] mornings,
[1:25:51] go into the heavens, thou art there.
[1:25:56] And when I make my bed in
[1:25:58] hell, thou art there.
[1:26:03] There is no place I can go away
[1:26:07] from your presence.
[1:26:11] Lord, let us let us look at
[1:26:15] ourselves in the image that God is
[1:26:18] wanting us to be. And ultimately
[1:26:20] ultimately can I just read read one
[1:26:23] scriptures the musicians come in they're
[1:26:27] in Ephesians 8 or or Romans Romans
[1:26:31] 8 and uh all of
[1:26:35] the same scripture I've read the same
[1:26:38] chapter I've been reading from on some
[1:26:39] of these others but Romans 8 what's
[1:26:42] what's what's the thing that God's
[1:26:45] doing? What is God doing? Romans
[1:26:49] 8:28. We know that all things work
[1:26:51] together for good to them that love God,
[1:26:54] to them who are the called according to
[1:26:56] his purpose. For whom he did
[1:27:00] forno them he also did
[1:27:03] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:27:07] image of his son. If God has
[1:27:13] predestinated every one of his
[1:27:17] children, put that back up there, Sister
[1:27:19] Keys. If God has predestinated every one
[1:27:23] of his children, and that's what he's
[1:27:25] saying, for whom he did forno, he also
[1:27:28] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:27:31] image of his
[1:27:34] son. then it's God's responsibility to
[1:27:37] make
[1:27:38] sure you get there.
[1:27:48] Aren't you glad you have a God like
[1:27:51] that? Aren't you glad then I and I don't
[1:27:53] care. I've been I've been a preacher.
[1:27:56] I've been pastoring for 36 years. So
[1:28:00] that's not even the time I've been a
[1:28:01] Christian.
[1:28:06] But God's still treating me like a
[1:28:09] son and God's still working on me. And
[1:28:12] you know why is because he has
[1:28:15] predestinated me to that word
[1:28:19] image. And let me just prophesy to you.
[1:28:22] I shall
[1:28:25] arrive. Why don't you prophesy to
[1:28:27] yourself? I shall arrive.
[1:28:32] If God has spoke it, it must come to
[1:28:35] pass. And there is no weapon that is
[1:28:38] formed against. Oh, Satan loves it when
[1:28:42] God gives permission. Amen. For him to
[1:28:45] do something. But I just want to tell
[1:28:47] you, Satan, you cannot destroy me.
[1:28:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:54] Amen.
[1:28:56] Greater is he that is in
[1:29:00] me. Greater is he that is in
[1:29:05] me. Greater is he that is in
[1:29:08] me than he that is in the
[1:29:13] world. Oh, greater is he that is in
[1:29:18] me. Greater is he that is in me.
[1:29:23] Oh,
[1:29:24] greater that is in
[1:29:27] me, he that is. Let's try a verse. Oh,
[1:29:33] Satan's like roaring
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:39] lion.
[1:29:41] Oh, seeking whom he may
[1:29:46] devour or tells the so.
[1:29:51] Oh, many souls have been his prey to
[1:29:56] fall in some weak
[1:29:58] hour. Oh, but God has promised us
[1:30:04] today his
[1:30:06] overcomeing power. Yes, greater is he
[1:30:11] that is in
[1:30:13] me. Greater is he that is in me. Hear me
[1:30:19] devil that is in
[1:30:21] me than he that is in the
[1:30:26] world. Yes. On the day of
[1:30:31] Pentecost, a rushing mighty
[1:30:35] wind. Yeah. It blew into the upper room
[1:30:41] and baptized all of them.
[1:30:45] Oh, with the power greater
[1:30:49] than any earthly foe. I'm so
[1:30:55] glad. I'm so
[1:30:58] glad. I've got to let
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:03] Well, greater is he that is in
[1:31:08] me. Greater is he that is in. That's why
[1:31:12] you need the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:16] It changes your desires. It changes your
[1:31:19] heart. You now have his desires. Oh,
[1:31:22] greater is he that is in
[1:31:26] me. Greater is he that is
[1:31:31] in. Greater is he that is in
[1:31:35] me than he that is in the world.
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:44] Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] Do you love him?
[1:31:49] Psalms 89 and 20 says, "I have found
[1:31:52] David my
[1:31:54] servant. With my holy oil have I
[1:31:57] anointed
[1:31:59] him, with whom my hand shall be
[1:32:02] established, and mine arm also shall
[1:32:05] strengthen
[1:32:07] him. The enemy shall not exact upon him,
[1:32:10] nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
[1:32:13] I will beat down his foes before his
[1:32:16] face, plague them that hate
[1:32:19] him. But
[1:32:21] my faithfulness and my mercy shall be
[1:32:26] with him, and in my name shall my horn
[1:32:30] or my strength be
[1:32:32] exalted. I will set his hand also in the
[1:32:36] sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
[1:32:39] He shall cry unto me, "Thou art my
[1:32:41] father, my God, the rock of my
[1:32:45] salvation. And I will make him my
[1:32:48] firstborn, higher than the kings of the
[1:32:50] earth. And I will keep him, keep for him
[1:32:55] forever. My mercy will I keep for him
[1:32:57] forever, and my covenant shall stand
[1:32:59] with him, and his seed also will I make
[1:33:02] to endure forever, and his throne as the
[1:33:05] days of heaven." Now, he's talking about
[1:33:06] me and you there. If his children
[1:33:09] forsake my law and walk not in my
[1:33:13] judgments, if they break my statutes and
[1:33:15] keep not my
[1:33:17] commandments, then will I visit their
[1:33:20] transgressions with the rod and their
[1:33:23] iniquity with stripes. But I want
[1:33:26] everyone to read with me here.
[1:33:29] Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I
[1:33:33] not utterly take from him, nor suffer my
[1:33:38] faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I
[1:33:43] not break, nor alter the thing that has
[1:33:47] gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn
[1:33:51] by my holiness that I will not
[1:33:55] lie unto David.
[1:34:05] I'm glad to have Amen. my father David.
[1:34:10] We know who the real David was. That's
[1:34:11] Jesus Christ. That's the real
[1:34:16] David. And I will not allow his
[1:34:19] children. Oh yeah.
[1:34:22] I'm going to give him a whipon plenty of
[1:34:24] times, but my
[1:34:27] mercy. Don't you just love him?
[1:34:30] Aren't you glad that God's not living in
[1:34:33] our society, but God says, "Listen, in
[1:34:36] this big time society or this society
[1:34:38] that knows nothing about correction and
[1:34:41] will not come under correction, they
[1:34:43] just they're just just Bible says
[1:34:45] they're just rebellious." Brother
[1:34:46] Brandham says it's just
[1:34:49] lawlessness. There's a bride
[1:34:52] He has his bride that sang, "Thy will is
[1:34:55] my desire." Do you love him? I love him
[1:34:59] tonight. Well, hopefully hopefully my
[1:35:01] thoughts here this evening were a
[1:35:03] blessing to
[1:35:05] you. If God be for
[1:35:10] me, ain't no devil, ain't no spanking,
[1:35:13] ain't nothing that's going to destroy
[1:35:15] me. Can you say amen? Glory be to God.
[1:35:19] Well, what are we going to sing, Brother
[1:35:21] Kobe? As we dismiss
[1:35:30] in the

[1:35:49] [Music]

[1:35:59] different
[1:36:03] story, but you came down from heaven to
[1:36:09] restore
[1:36:13] me.
[1:36:14] Forever changed my life.

[1:38:09] Thank you. Thank you.
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:19] I worship you as long as I am.
[1:38:24] [Music]
[1:38:37] Now
[1:38:39] tonight, if
[1:38:43] there's repenting that needs to be done,
[1:38:45] and I
[1:38:47] know some of you are just coming back to
[1:38:50] the Lord,
[1:38:55] and I and I want you all to
[1:38:58] know you that are coming
[1:39:01] back. We're not Catholics
[1:39:05] around. We simply yield ourselves to the
[1:39:09] Lord. But it's got to be a real we we we
[1:39:12] can't we can't bargain with God. We
[1:39:13] can't say, "I'll do this if you do
[1:39:14] that." That it just ain't going to work.
[1:39:16] We got to do it God's way and God's way
[1:39:18] alone.
[1:39:20] But if we do it God's way,
[1:39:24] I just want you to know that you have
[1:39:26] you have every right to the throne room
[1:39:28] that I have to the throne room.
[1:39:32] You you have every right you have every
[1:39:34] right to come and talk to papa just like
[1:39:36] I have. There is no difference. I I
[1:39:39] always use Stephanie as my example. You
[1:39:42] know, Stephanie was just a ranked sinner
[1:39:45] and then and and and just a couple
[1:39:47] months after she gives her heart to the
[1:39:48] Lord, God gives her a brand new lip.
[1:39:54] And if you guys heard her testimony or
[1:39:56] read her testimony, you would know that
[1:39:58] this girl was no
[1:40:05] saint. She did some pretty rough
[1:40:10] stuff. I've been a
[1:40:13] Christian since a little
[1:40:17] boy, trying to keep the commandments of
[1:40:19] God and the laws of God and trying to be
[1:40:21] a good
[1:40:22] Christian. She went her way defying the
[1:40:26] laws of
[1:40:31] God and and and and the reason that
[1:40:35] she's had a bad liver is because she
[1:40:38] abused her body.
[1:40:43] And yet when
[1:40:47] God gave her a brand new liver,
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:40:57] so there's nothing to earn.
[1:41:01] There's everything to learn, but nothing
[1:41:02] to earn. You don't You don't earn
[1:41:05] anything.
[1:41:06] But God does what it takes.
[1:41:10] Now, just because God gave her a brand
[1:41:12] new liver doesn't mean that she's
[1:41:14] somebody special and that God's not
[1:41:15] going to spank her occasionally. You get
[1:41:17] she also gets the same spankings I
[1:41:20] get,
[1:41:24] right? Because we're
[1:41:26] sons, we're daughters. when we see this
[1:41:30] in our when we see these kinds of things
[1:41:35] in God's word and that's exactly the way
[1:41:38] the prophet brought that word to us.
[1:41:41] This message is not a message of
[1:41:42] condemnation. This message is a message
[1:41:44] of holiness and purity.
[1:41:48] And when you're wrong, God's expecting
[1:41:54] you to repent.
[1:41:57] But on the other on the flip side of the
[1:41:59] coin, Satan can do anything he want. He
[1:42:01] can try and try and try and try and try
[1:42:03] and try and try to convince you of
[1:42:04] anything else. And I just say
[1:42:07] tonight, fooy with you, devil, your days
[1:42:10] of me listening to you is just it's just
[1:42:13] so stupid. I'm not listening to you. I
[1:42:17] boy, I'm using a lot of words that you
[1:42:19] boys and girls are not supposed to be
[1:42:20] using. Amen. But I'm just saying, you
[1:42:23] know, I am I I am fed up with the devil
[1:42:27] and I'm going to believe what God's word
[1:42:29] says about me.
[1:42:31] Amen.
[1:42:33] Amen.
[1:42:36] So, so where wherever we are, wherever
[1:42:39] we stand, whether wherever you are in
[1:42:42] your walk with God, God requires young,
[1:42:46] old, one-year-old Christian, 50-year-old
[1:42:48] Christian, he require it's the same
[1:42:50] zeal,
[1:42:51] repentance, saying, "Lord, I want your
[1:42:54] word. I want eyes for my eyes. I want
[1:42:58] clothed be clothed with your
[1:42:59] righteousness. I want your grace to be
[1:43:01] upon me. I want your favor. I want to be
[1:43:05] conform to that image. Can I hear a
[1:43:08] great big amen? God bless you. Love
[1:43:12] every one of you. Amen. Let the Holy
[1:43:16] Spirit come. Let's just let's just sing.

[1:45:37] hearts as we stand on the
[1:45:49] word down.
