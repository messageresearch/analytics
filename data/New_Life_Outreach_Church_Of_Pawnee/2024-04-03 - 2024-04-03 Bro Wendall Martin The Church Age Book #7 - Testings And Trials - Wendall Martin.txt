journey we're in it and um I'm I'm sure glad that God makes a way for his people amen well it's good to be here tonight in the house of the Lord and and um we uh we just want to um say it's good to

we sure miss them on Sunday and uh um I I know they had to have came back just wore out we just got through with our camp and then them going over there being counselor and and uh but we sure appreciated them I know they appreciated it um brother Tim and in the group there heard they had wonderful meetings and so we're sure thankful uh for that amen well let's look here in the book of in the book of um Revelations the um the second chapter and um we're going to start here at the um we're just going to we're going to start here at the second Church age and we're going to read from the 8th to the 11th verse and it says unto the angel of the Church of smyna write these things saith the first and the last which were with is dead and is alive I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are of the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death amen now we're going to um center tonight on that ninth verse I Know Thy works and thy tribulation and um I I think we'll enjoy this reading let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you today for your love and your blessings thank you for the anointing of your spirit that is among us and we're asking Lord that you would be with us here tonight Lord anyone can read the Bible anyone can read the church age book but Lord we're asking that the same spirit that wrote the Bible the exact spirit that Anointed The Prophet to write this this book I'm asking that that same Spirit would be here with us tonight to interpret your word to us and father we'll give you glory and honor be with all of those Lord that that aren't here help them and strengthen and heal them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen God bless you you may be seated tonight we want to say um happy anniversary to um the land casters uh brother Harry and sister Stephanie and um see what what was it 18 years 19 19 years amen well that is just awesome and so um we definitely appreciate the Lancaster family amen we um so we're going to start tonight on page um on page 10 see 110 10 in your church age book and um um so this is the beginning of the uh the saman church age and um um and so we're we're going to we're going to try to go uh to the 119 which would make us um uh uh nine pages and so uh I think we can get through that easy enough we'll just see how we go but um um how many's enjoyed the church age book since we have started I I love it I you know I love the church age book anyways and um um you know when you take off reading it uh there is there is so much uh truths to it and and so uh and I've heard I've heard a lot uh even over the the last two Wednesday nights on the serpent seed and things and how it has made it more clear to others and so we're we're sure thankful to the Lord for that and um so we're glad that it's being a a blessing amen um so let's just let's just read we're going to start with the introduction here we've already read um the verses so let's let's do um uh 110 and then paragraph one or uh two here says in order to refresh your mind I want to point out again how we arrive at finding the names of The Messengers to the various ages God in his Sovereign will has seen to it that the history of the New Testament Church was not lost even as he saw to it that the history of Israel would not be lost by placing it in the Bible and corroborating it uh today from the multitude of scows Earth and vessels and uh other artifacts that the archaeologists have discovered and interpreted we actually have a running commentary of Bible history from the first page up to now thus by reading history we can find out what man or men in various Ages were closest to God's original pattern the Apostle Paul so everything is everything in every age we we we it's you you you judge everything according to that first church age messenger brother Brenham says he will never change can you say amen he says the ones that God used to bring his people back to the word of truth would be the ones to examine then out of those there would be uh one for every age who would stand out the clearest as the closest in the word pattern and power and that would and that one would be the messenger the ages are found by a study of history one simply needs to read the ages as found in Revelations Revelation and it all patterns perfectly with history as indeed it must since the church Ages were foretold by God and their conditions revealed then of necessity the history would follow uh that would follow would be as the Bible sets forth it is that simple but then Simplicity is the key to the word I like that amen I like that now with all this I have not simply been a student and a historian I have sought to be Spirit a spiritually minded man and it was only with the Divine approval of the spirit of God that I chose the men that I have chosen that is true as God knows my heart now again there's a lot of people that talk about amen the the ages and and and brother brandom was not the first to bring out the Seven Ages the scoffield uh uh Bible talks about The Seven Ages the uh even your your Thompson Chain Bibles uh talk about The Seven Ages so so this is not just a a theory that there these seven churches that we have went and at length over in the past is is um is has been talking about the um The Seven Ages so it's seven distinct periods of time but but the the deal is it took that seventh angel messenger remember in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of the Book of Revelation will all be finished amen now and it doesn't just it doesn't just include Revelation because we find out amen that symbols uh was carried through all throughout the Bible so this seventh angel messenger amen is to bring to Front The Mystery of God for that church that God is doing can you say Amen someone says well he didn't you know he must not be the prophet because he didn't really talk about what the Jews and what's going to happen in the tribulation well that doesn't pertain to you that doesn't pertain to the bride amen God would we're we're thankful for what that what we did get but I'm here to tell you what you needed God's given to us in this generation can you say amen and so um so we're we're thankful for so it it when brother Bram says he had the definite approval of the spirit of God when the prophet says that perk your ears up because God has put his SK of approval and told him this is your man amen amen so now we're going to talk about the message messenger it says using our god-given rule of choosing the messenger for each Age We unhesitantly declare that irenius was exalted by the Lord to that position he was the disciple of that great Saint and Warrior of the faith polycarp it is no doubt as he sat at the feet of that great man he learned the Christian Graces that flowed from his consecrated life for polycarp was one of the truly illustrious Saints of all ages when viewed in the light of a blameless life you will remember from your own reading that poly clar was martyred too old to flee too sincere a man to allow another to hide him and then suffer a penalty for doing so he gave himself up to death but before he did he asked for and was granted permission to pray two hours for his brethren in the Lord for the governor for his enemies and his captors like the great Saints of all ages and Desiring a better Resurrection he stood firm refusing to deny the Lord and died with a free conscience he was placed at the stake untied at his own request and the fire was lit the fire bent away from his body refusing to touch him he was then pierced through with a sword and as this was done water gushed from his side drowning the Flames his spirit was actually seen to depart in the form of a white dove released from his bosom wow yet for all this great testimony this student of John the Revelator was not militant against the nickan system for he himself leaned toward organization not realizing that the desire for uh fellowship and what appeared like a good plan to Foster the work of God was really a trick of the enemy with irus this was not so he was militant against any form of organization also his life history wherein he served the Lord was one of much manifestation in the spirit and the Word was taught with unusual Clarity and Conformity to its original precepts his churches in France were known to have the gifts of the Spirit among them for the Saints spoke in tongues prophesied raised the dead healed the Sick by the prayer of faith he saw the danger of any kind of organized Brotherhood among the elders pastors Etc he stood solidly for a unified Spirit-filled gift manifesting local church and God honored him for the power of God manifested among the saints now you're going to notice this all through these every one of these ages every one of these Messengers stood uh firm for the nine spiritual gifts stood firm for the five uh uh uh for the five-fold ministry they stood firm for God working in the church they were against the format that that there was just a a a a a spiritual man a priest or some holy man that was taken care of all the worship God gave gifts to every member in that church that's why we've got to be baptized into that body because you cannot operate effectively in that local body without being baptized with the Holy Ghost amen if not it's just constantly looking at this one looking at that one and it's just all power struggles whereas where the Holy Spirit comes in and is living his life you are baptized into God's Eternal purpose for for every one of us and so I I think this is very important you're going to notice as we look at each one of these ages they all they they all fought for the spirit of God not intellectualism the spirit of God in their churches can you say amen and so uh and and by the way on polycarp um you can you can look polycarp's testimony up uh online the fox book of Martyrs has an incredible uh that's that's quite that's that's quite a testimony and uh if you guys want to read it there's there's there's a lot um brother bam just took a some pieces out of that but uh and if you've got the fox's book of martyr which I do um there's it's just incredible what those early Saints done so those that want to read on further on that all right let's go on he was also clear on his understanding of the godhead and since he was the disciple of polycarp who in turn was the disciple of St John we know for sure he was as perfect uh he was he had as perfect teaching as is possible on this subject in volume 1 page 412 the antien fathers we have this statement by him on the godhead all the other Expressions likewise bring out the title of one the same being the one and the same being the Lord of power the Lord the power or the father of all God Almighty most high Creator maker such like these are not the names and the titles of su uh succession of different beings but of one and of the same he pointed out clearly that these are not these are but titles as is Rose of Sharon Bright and Morning Star fairest of 10,000 Etc there is uh neither is there but one God his name is Lord Jesus Christ thus with his strict adherence to the word his wonderful understanding of scripture and the attendance of the power of God upon that Ministry he is the right choice for the age it is it is altogether unfortunate that the other ages did not have in their Messengers such a balance of fruit power and leadership in the Holy Spirit and the word now we're going to move going to Smyrna and it says the City of Smyrna was a little uh north of Ephesus at the mouth of Smyrna Gulf because of its very fine Harbor It was a commercial center renowned for its exports it was also distinguished for its schools of rhetoric philosophy medicine sciences and fine buildings many Jews lived there and they were bitly opposed to Christianity even more so than were the Romans in fact polycarp the First bishop at Smyrna was martyred by the Jews and it is said that the Jews desecrated their holy day Saturday to carry the wood that would make this uh his funeral peer the word Samina means bitter being derived from the word uh M or myrr myrr was used in AB bombing the dead thus we have two fold significance found in the name of this age it was a bitter age filled with death the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on the part of the false death was not the only seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine there was a creeping peris uh per perisis amen sorry and impotent uh because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost and no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God as seen by the multitudes of examples in the Old Testament organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost leadership was deposed and the Word was replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made rituals when Israel entered into lawful alliances with the world and formed fellowships by marriage the day finally came when the world took over and Babylon carried away the people of God into captivity now when they went into captivity they went in having a priesthood a temple and the word when they came back back they had rabbis a theological order of the Pharisees a synagogue and the tomman and when Jesus came they were so corrupted that he called them of their father the devil and this in spite of the fact they were of Abraham according to the Flesh in this age we see the same thing happening however as all Israel is not Israel but a little group were the true spirit spiritual Israelites so there would be always there would always be a little group of true Christians the bride of Christ until he came for his own well Hallelujah he says in this city there were two famous temples one was the temple erected to the worship of Zeus and the other erected Sabel to Sabel and between these two temples was found the most beautiful Road of ancient times called the Golden City to me this depicts a a further inroad of paganism that had already started in the first age but was known to exist only at Rome the joining of the two temples of a god and goddess is seed for marity uh wherein Mary is called the mother of God and receives honor and titles and powers given her a quo equality with Jesus Christ the golden street that joins them is a picture of the greed that caused the nickan organizers to join the state and the church because they knew the wealth and the power it offered them as the Ephesian age was but the seed bed uh for the tragic pergam Manan age it that was uh yet in the future this Myan age was the rain the sun and the nourishment that ensured the vile corruption that would confirm the church in idolatry with the spiritual fornication uh from which she would never rise death was permeating her root to the branch and they that took part of her partook of bitterness and death this age lasted 170 to 312 ad amen so so we can we can see here the the it's all laid out brother brandham is is is giving us what uh these two temples the marrying the two together and how that they they in turn that's exactly what Rome done but he took the Son of God and his mother and bringing them both together so it would be son and mother worship just as these others were amen and so in anytime that you replace the word of God for for for these kinds of things then you are then then you are uh effectively killing your own your your own uh your own life amen you cannot cannot you cannot take anything a even a a small portion of God's word amen and add yours to it it just won't mix you can't mix it and that's the reason why we had to have that word brought to us Prophet had to come amen and and and this is where I I think the bride should just really amen we we we have we've we've got to leave our Pride born you've got to be born again a born again you're it's no you you're no longer uh the pride issue is gone because you can't follow Christ and your own will you cannot do that it's it the your your mind is enmity against God and and and you you young men and young women how important it is don't try to figure things out don't try to find you know the minimum of God's word but ask God let me die to myself and be born of you so that I can not just uh uh that I not just understand your teachings but help me to surrender myself to your teachings because you're going to surrender to one or another and you can't it's the most it's it's the most miserable life amen Still Still Alive In the Flesh and at the same time trying to to to walk according to God it's just it's it's just a it's it's torment but we must die to ourselves our thinking our I've got to die to this old nature so that the Life of Christ can live in me can you say amen amen and so um so I think I think in in all of this oh God oh God help wend Martin help wend Martin to to totally surrender myself and every as we reading this you're going to hear that in brother bram's thoughts amen it slips in so easy so slightly it slips in amen and so we we want to uh keep those things in our mind now let's go ahead and continue reading this is the uh salutation and and he's taking it there from uh Revelations 2 and8 he says and these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive the first and the last which was dead and is alive now these are not the words of a man a m man could he speak from the grave would say I am the first and the last which was alive and is dead the first thing that happens to a man is that he is born he is alive and the last thing that happens is that he dies so this is not a man speaking this is deity man Adam took life and turned it into death but this man Jesus Took death and turned it into life Adam took innocence and turned it into guilt this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness Adam took a paradise and turned it into a waste hiling Wilderness but this one is coming back to turn an earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another Eden Hallelujah Adam took life of fellowship and joy with God and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness and that brought forth all sin moral Decay pain suffering delusion corruption that Wars within the souls of men but this one from all the tragic death and degradation that filled mankind brought forth a life of righteousness and Beauty so that as Sin once reigned unto death even so men now reign in righteousness by one Jesus Christ oh isn't that just wonderful it's it's you know uh uh uh it it should there should be just be a real cry in our heart Lord oh I want to die more I want to surrender more I want you to take me I want your life to be so overwhelming in my life I believe I believe it's possible folks but the only way you're going to do it is dying amen you're going to have to die and and and when you die oh that's when the resurrection of the new life can come can you say Amen it says now not as the offense was though terrible indeed it was but now much more is his gift unto eternal life here he is walking in the midst of Those whom he has redeemed even his church what were those who he redeemed uh who were redeemed were not many like Paul murderers and corruptors were not many like the dying Thief robbers and mankillers all trophies of his grace all brought back from the dead all made alive in Christ Jesus the Lord he said I wonder if you noted the salutation to the first age and then noted the one of to this age put them together these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand and walks in the midst of the churches these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive this is one and the same person he is letting us know that the churches is as the seed of the fruit is in the midst of the fruit so is he the Royal seed in the midst of the church as the seed alone has life in it so is he the author of life to that church his walking signifies his untiring care of it he is the chief Shepherd watching over his own that is right for he bought that church with his own blood that blood is the blood of God the one who owns the church is God very God he is the very he is the first and the last the title spells eternity he was dead and is alive he paid the price so he has so ownership of the temple of God he rules it he has worshiped in it he resents anyone taking over his lordship and Authority No Doubt the reason he introduces himself to each age as deity is to warn and comfort the people he warns the false Vine he Comforts The True Vine this is the one true almighty God hear him and live Oh Glory to God Amen so I have no say you have no say he is the one that purchased us no no one else aren't you Hallelujah no one else God didn't take a vote with nobody when he saved you the vote was in himself when he saved you you you can't even vote your way out of the grace of God God is the one that put you there he loved you he bought you and he says I will keep you oh bless the Lord bless the Lord all right any questions so far any questions or comments amen I I love I I I love this part this is really really good stuff man Hallelujah I'm glad to have experienced I I think we can all say that God has taken our wasteing places and he has made something beautiful of us all right second or or Revelations 2 and9 he says I Know Thy works and thy tribulation now this conditions of the age and poverty but Thou Art Rich he says uh I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan the key to this age is most evidently tribulation if there was tribulation in the first age there was now predicted an intensified tribulation throughout the second age there is no doubt but the following words of Paul applied to the mass of Christians uh wherever they were in the world and in every age Hebrews 10 and 32- 38 but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst ye were made a gazing stall both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became Companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring substance amen cast not a away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tar now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him he says the M Association of kind-hearted people with the True Believer might well bring death in return for their kindness now the Lord God allmighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but he does but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering now what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord but yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayeth the Lord yet I loved Jacob and and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought love meant no suffering they thought love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective Love Oh Glory to God it's not he's not he's he's not interested in in giving you wealth as much as he's interested in getting you to the other side right he's not interested in babying you here pampering you here as much as he is equipping you to to to overcome the evil one of this age so he's not interested in in in in trying to shelter you on he knows the Eternal seed on the inside of you and he is equipping you to withstand that evil one no matter what the cost because only the Overcomer is going to set in that Throne oh come on now amen so he's Hallelujah God don't I know these days here everyone thinks you know everyone's got to be pampered God does not pamper his people amen you are loved because he has placed his seat on the inside of you and said I'm taking you to a destiny Hallelujah and I'm going to ensure that you make it and it's not going to be by telling you that you're pretty all the time I I I the only way I'm going to do this amen I'm going to throw you in the Lion's de I'm going to throw you in the fiery furnaces I'm going to put you in those situation but I'm telling you everything that you overcome you're going to go to the next and you're going to rise to the next and then and the final will be death itself well Glory glory to God Amen do you love him now he says now but God said his love is elective love the proof of his love is election no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen un salvation because God had chosen you to Salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and the belief of Truth he may have committed you to death as he did Paul he may have committed you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose someone say it's all with a purpose your struggles your trials where you are right now is all with a purpose amen if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled job said he put strength in US job 236b you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things he suffered Hebrews 5 and 8-9 it says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering now we we don't we we don't ever want to we we don't ever want to bypass that if God's put that in our lives amen I you know uh uh if he's if he's put that in in in our lives then then Brothers we we want we want to say Lord whatever you are doing I trust you you've got to trust him you've got to realize he's the one that found you he's the one that uh bought you and he's the one that says I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen he's going to bring that out now I I I I I had um um I forgot I for some reason uh this other quote in the Ephesian Church age is not there brother uh or I don't I don't have the page number so I'm just going to read it to you he says now the true brother brandom's given the distinction he says the True Church of Jesus Christ the Bri that the bride is lightened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his his glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her Lord all of her works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God has spoken it hallelujah oh what confidence that should give the Bride of Jesus Christ but then the very next words but not only is the Candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit-given outside of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the Bride of Jesus Christ surely she is filling up the sufferings that Christ has left behind her goods are despoiled her life is in Jeopardy she has counted as sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the Gospel is this little bride of Christ and as gold as malleable whereas brass will break with the beating the gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty a joy Forever by the trials and testings of this life Hallelujah trials and testings God sends the testings our way can you say amen amen there's no other that you're going to reflect the image of God is through the trials and the testings that God sends to you amen he'll send those testings to you to see your reaction to see how you're going to respond to that reaction amen he's wanting to do that he does that for you can you say amen amen now okay so um all right so we we're at the top verse we just finished uh he became the author of Eternal salvation under the that obey him he says in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measuring of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1 2 1 and 2-4 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverse into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:17 uh through through 18 if children then HS and HS of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift everyone say it with me character is a victory and not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and to sit down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation can you say Amen so so the trials and the tribulations listen listen take those things amen instead of getting your nose out of joint instead of getting all upset when situations aren't going your way remember God is is is sends everything your way to bring you into that maturity that he is looking for he's looking for this the the authority of adoption is given to a people who has surrendered themselves to the authority of God's word hallelujah can you say amen amen that's that's that that's that's right you know let's just turn real quickly uh hold your place there and let's go over to the page 355 real quickly amen uh let's I I was reading this and I thought this was beautiful 355 and one and and and he's he's sharing what he's wanting you're his you're his own and he's treating you like his sons praise the Lord amen now watch this uh when you're there say amen amen all right herein is now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself therefore before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and dishonor the choosing will be his own then those choosen chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained somebody say train me will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel that he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but here we go again but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not and there cannot be oh aren't you glad for God's love you see people want it you know we and sometimes we're all of us poor folks we we we think man you know we just ain't we just ain't got the brains to uh you know to to succeed or we haven't got this that and the other the Lord is the one that's planned out our lives he's he's planned out our lives amen and just and just to let you know I mean Successful guys I believe there's there's plenty of successful amen um but but brother Bram says there's going to be very few successful and Rich folks that make it into the kingdom of God why because they've done it all themselves they're they're wealthy men they've built their lives they've done their things like that God that there's nothing wrong uh with having success but having a humble heart having a Divine heart of humility is what God's looking for can you say amen amen that's what he wants now okay so let's go back let's see um okay we're down to the uh second paragraph in page 117 think it not strange the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said it is strange that God wants to develop a Christlike character or is it strange that God wants to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as Sons not as one and not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God Hebrews 12 and 6 verses 6 and verse 8 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons if you can't take correction amen it shows that that window Martin is still living if I can't take his correction can you say amen he says now this special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no uh age free from it there is no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God it is needful let's let's just read those three lines together this is of god this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it love suffereth long and His Kind Matthew 5:1 through2 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval why don't you just tell the devil are you are you listening devil amen and cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval I'm going through this oh God must be against me God must not love me it might mean that God really thinks a lot of you come on it was God bragging on job it was God saying hey have you tried my servant job there ain't no one liking right amen so he says neither are bright SK and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know shall we know because or we shall know because he said so manifested that he did love us for he uh for he brought brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials uh that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass well can you say amen amen now now now what is now what is he saying amen he said now how what am I to do what what am I going to do he said how can I prove my love back to him by believing what he says and conducting myself with joy in the amidst the trials that he in his wisdom has placed in my life you know what that means your attitude concerning your situations that you go through on a daily basis matters the way you react the way that you respond the way that you do these things the these it matters it's the spirit of the Lord that is bringing us in these areas because he is molding us and making us well praise the Lord we're not we're not going to get to it tonight so I'm I'm want to there was one over it'll be on next Wednesday nights but uh 123 if if if you were to look there at 123 and the the second uh paragraph he says now you see the one difference between Israel and the the rest of the Nations was God put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation our attitudes toward God and what he is trying to work in our lives and we we we allow ourselves amen we we're fighting for our rights or we're doing this we let that wolf nature come up within us we we you're missing in the point of Christianity you're missing the point of what God is trying to mold in US sheep are not they're they're they they they they are um uh a powerless they have no ability of their own sheep bear the wool and then somebody else takes it right and and and and and they provide clothing and they do all of this sheep and the and and and the wol provides so much sheep has nothing that can say about it sheep has nothing that can say about it Jesus opened not his mouth to say a thing because he was God's lamb and so God and we all know how he won Hallelujah he won as a lamb not a lion he did not defeat his rights he laid his rights down and the power of Resurrection Came Upon him well glory be to God how am I going to win in my home how am I going to win on my job how am I going to win God you've allow these situations to come help me to handle them the way that you want me to handle them the spirit of the Lord makes the difference and so our attitudes toward God that our attitudes remember we're nothing without him and we're saying Lord if we're if if we're true with our confession mold me make me break me mold me the song uh break me mold me make me however that one goes amen can you say Amen so so we don't want we don't want a wrong Spirit never and when we do don't defend it repent repent right now I know we're all human but the thing is is we're learning God's right we're wrong and we say sorry it's hard for us men to do but look at your wife and say sorry sometimes it's it's harder for you women you need to look at your husband and say sorry not defending yourself that's not the point even if your husband was wrong and then you jumped in his face you are wrong don't wait for your husband to repent you repent or if vice versa don't wait for your wife to repent you repent somebody has got to declare the glory of God he sends the trials our way and it's important well praise the Lord amen that's what we want amen now yall y'all remember uh brother um brother Le Vale uh brother brandom and um we're almost through with our reading here so I I just want to uh y'all remember brother Le Vil was got got on to brother brandom and um uh he you know he was saying you know um uh you know he says the brother R say the subject came up about how do you let people talk about you like that talk to you and talk about you like that and and brother brother brandom says now brother Le Vil is one of the finest men I've ever known but he's a little too quick on the trigger I always told him you know I said you know I hope it's all right brother Veil I I said don't fly loose all at once sit still God's the one that's a do it it don't fly loose sit still God's the one that sent this thing along God's wanting to declare his glory through his body here on the earth character the prophet said what we need is the character of Faith so what is this character of Faith character is the ability to say I was Trust your word I will I will trust what you say I will trust what you're sending regardless of what I'm seeing or thinking or the situation around me looks I'm I I'm I'm going to sit here I'm going to trust you even though it seems pry weird to be trusting you right now trusting knowing that the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord so we stand there and we say Lord character is Ste stepping up I'm learning to trust you I'm learning to rely upon you I'm learning that you are you are you are you you you've brought me through this Valley of sickness you've brought me through this Valley of of of of of finan you you've allowed these things you have allowed these things to come my way Lord I'm not I'm no longer going to be worrying about it I'm no longer going to try to to to to to to fight my way out of this I'm Lord I'm going to trust in you lead me lead me the trials are here to mold me I want Faith to rise in me I want Faith to take me from this it's from Faith to Faith glory to glory can you say Amen teach me Lord what you have for me well praise the Lord it isn't that just beautiful amen okay so so I you know once again once again that that Faith you know brother brother brandham I've got it here somewhere um uh brother brandham is this not in the church age book in time evangelism he said now Peter had a sword he pulled that sword and was going to cut the high priest uh uh ears off and and and things like that he did it but when it came to a real Christian Courage he didn't have it he backed up and denied it so he's got his sword ready to cut the high priest ER all for coming after Jesus but then he says but then when it came time for him to stand on him when it counted he didn't have the Christian Courage his sword wasn't going to take care of everybody he he just he's he started cussing and saying I don't know him I've never met him I don't know who he is Jesus is over looking at him saying thanks buddy can you say Amen now watch he says he could cut the high priest ear off with the sword sure he know how to handle it amen that's but when it come to the squeeze and time to stand on the word of God he didn't have the courage he even denied the that he know Jesus there's where it's at today we got courage to build big buildings put millions of dollars in them we've got courage to put pipe organs and plush seats and everything and go out and prop the light and from place to place and make Methodist to become Baptist and so forth back and forth like that but when it comes to the Christian Courage to accept the word and the message of God and stand there on it we are few so what goods your stones without a stone Mason is that right go God's looking for character not membership character eleazer when he went to get the body of the Bride for Isaac he sweated it out until he found character can I hear a great big amen now amen okay so now are we let's say we're on page 118 um okay we're at we're at paragraph two it says I Know Thy poverty but Thou Art Rich there it is again see him walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector yet he looks on at their poverty oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this how can God bear to look upon his own in the time of need and just and not just stop at it all just give in and lavish everything material upon them here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of God this too is needful remember he admonished take no thought for tomorrow for tomorrow what you shall eat or what you shall put on your father knoweth the things that ye have need of he who clothes the Lily and Feats the sparrow shall do much more for you these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consists not of the things he possesses but seek but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all material Necessities will be added unto you the people of God are not Material minded they are christm minded they do not seek Treasures that are below they seek those above it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not wealthy rather they are on the Poor Side it was so in Jesus say It was so in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not true today for the Le oysan age is one of vast wealth where often the Criterion of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods my how rich the church is in Goods but how poor in spirit blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink it is not Material it is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things oh cries the spirit I see your poverty I see your need you haven't very much if anything to boast of but what you did have and and what you did have is taken from you you gladly gave up your possessions in exchange for Eternal ones Hallelujah you are laughed at you are scorned you don't have material resources to fall back on but you are rich in spite of it all your security lies in him who is your shield and exceeding great joy your kingdom is yet to come but it will come someone shout hallelujah hallu and it will be an everlasting one yes I'm mindful of your trials and woes I know how hard it is to get along but I will remember all this when I return to claim you as my own and then I will reward you somebody say then I will I will reward you this is nothing against rich people because God can save a rich man some of God's children are rich but money can be such a snare not only to those who have it but to those who don't have it way back in there in the first age James cried out to those who were putting stock in wealthy people have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respects respective persons the poor there were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in God don't do it says James don't do it money isn't everything money isn't the answer today it is not the answer either we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that God works he moves by his spirit and that moving of the spirit comes only to a consec life consecrated to the word amen consecrated to the word now how many wants your life to be consecrated the offenses are going to come the trials are going to come but for the ele and sometimes it can even it can even uh uh move in the church like shelving falling over yesterday I I still haven't I still haven't seen it but I but I heard that I seen pictures and uh oh wow uh but God allowed it now I'm not making an excuse I'm still going to look at my shelving and make sure that that it doesn't happen again but but at the same time Trials come and sometimes it's not just in in in a family sometimes it's in the church sometimes it's between children and mamas and daddies sometimes it's sometimes it's between preachers so trials these these things come but we see but the but the thing is even in our miscommunications and our misunderstandings and our and our and our and our and our whatever I don't I don't think anyone's blaming anybody but um um but even even even in those kind of situations like yesterday see we're still on the same team whereas the evil one is not on our team and Satan is doing everything he can to try to do it and there's where we have to be wise because we have character we have character to say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this is a trick of the devil right and so what did we do we just all said oops okay yep we'll look at that yep yep we'll do what we have to do yep see and then something that could have been a well you should and you shouldn't and this that and the other and and and uh we can't trust brother wend to be Pastor anymore he don't even know how to build shelves all you know all that kind of stuff that would that that would you know that that we would all bring together but yet we can understand hey hey this was a trick of the devil God's been trying to send a a a Revival and I you know there was there's no doubt in my mind that the devil would have loved to have um had a kid underneath that thing you know and um so you know so we you know we I I believe I I I believe uh Jesus is the one that says said that there in Matthew he he says you offenses are going to come Jesus said offenses are going to come they're going to come at you but he says but woe to the one who brings the offense so offences are going to be around us but what we've got to do is again going back to maturity going back to maturity saying hey the Lord has taught me that trials are coming and instead of getting all worked up no no Satan is trying to do something here God's allowed it to come yeah so what I'm going to do is I'm I'm going I'm going to be the master of this situation and that's not by the way of a wolf it's by the way of a lamb that's the way we win in Christ well can you say amen amen and what what are we doing then we give no place for the devil in our lives in our homes even on our jobs I'm talking about I'm talking about even even between you and The Sinner and the sinner's coming out there and the devil is anointing that sinner to try to get at your at your walk with God there is character that has being molded in you through your sufferings that you've been going through even in your at in your home you're gaining character we're we're gaining character with one another and when we go outside there we know how to possess our temples even when we go outside there and we're saying all right amen all right so what are we doing do we do we fail oh yeah many of times amen we we we'll we'll fall short repent the blood wasn't given for The Sinner the blood was given for Christians we just repent and say sorry and and we and and we do it with a genuine heart man those guys that have a hard time repenting you know I I've got a you know I've got a problem with that just be quick to say I'm wrong you you can't do that then you need to you if you don't have that in your heart to do that then you need to find yourself an altar somewhere because that that's the Zeal of the age but the bom said the Zeal of this Leo toy and age is repentance repentance and that's not once you know 30 years ago that means you're backsliding on a daily basis you're in this mortal flesh and if you f all and come short of the glory of God run to the fountain filled with blood it's still flowing it's still coming from the Emmanuel's veins there's plenty for you and there's plenty for your for your wife and there's plenty for there's plenty there's plenty for everybody can you say amen amen that's that's exactly right so so we we want that we want to keep those things in our lives amen well did you enjoy the word of the Lord here tonight amen oh yes he's mulling me he's mulling me so you think some you just thought something was wrong with you there ain't nothing wrong with is God's God's elective love in your life allowing trials and tribulations amen but it is important on how you deal with those trials and tribulations don't be moping around and and I don't care how sick you are I don't care how what things are looking at you keep that positive faith brother brandom says what we need is the car character of faith I trust God regardless of what I see trust God Amen well do you love him praise the Lord amen all right if the musicians uh would would start to come any any uh anything that anyone wants to add I don't we didn't get into anything too deep tonight uh but is there is there anything that anyone wants to add to it or if you do have a question amen uh these Wednesday nights are good for that though we we don't get them I always get them when I get the office amen good to have you back sister Carol [Applause] amen okay that family living in Still Water uhuh he um the Baptist preacher came and got for Easter Sunday was able to be in church and it just was a work he went brain surgeries and making it back a walker and to make it back he hadass my my Lord knows yes he does yes he does then and to and to know that he was seeking the Lord like he was doing that's just that's so wonderful amen you know a lot of that a lot of that goes the credit goes to you Sister Carol she's witnessed and witnessed and witnessed to Robin and uh takes a hard head to help a hard head huh amen that's that's just awesome Amen so thankful to the Lord for that and Angie that's really been bothering me and I want to know um if a woman in the church can she say amen and stuff like that when the preacher is preaching I mean what how much can she do a woman is just as free in in the church to participate in in in every form of worship other than to preach she can prophesy she can you know she she can uh she can sing she can amen she can give a testimony but she but she cannot take uh she cannot usurp Authority and uh and teach over so uh but but brother brand said that she can she can be a part of of of U all all all of the worship and so uh and I believe uh yeah you know I probably so I you know I I I I don't I don't I wouldn't think that that would necessarily be sin if if there was if we were in a position to where we need you know we needed somebody but but right I I I'm I I I lean real real strongly that way uh um you just can't find that in scripture cannot teach or usurp authority over man and that's talking about handling the word of the Lord and so um but she can sing you know they can do that uh I see nothing wrong with Amy uh leading s or uh having the pre-service songs and things the way that we do um you know those those kinds of things like that that all you know each each church is Sovereign in that regard but as far as as leadership teaching the word or anything like that a woman has no place in the five-fold ministry so does that answer your question yeah anyone else about you know character being a victory and power with characters fit the rule and with a with that land likee nature yeah thought that was outstanding uh and it just came to my mind uh you know I don't know if it's on tape where brother Brandon was preaching and uh that couple was making out yeah and I believe if I got it correct uh he was uh uh was told uh if you say the word they they'll pack them out yeah but he he said when the pillar of fire was right there and yeah and he said I forgive you yeah that's powerful amen yeah that's that's powerful they're in your hands they're in your hands do do with them as you will yeah yeah and and that that's a that's the character because because he kept on the the you know she was she wasn't dressed right in the first place and then you know and so they they had tried to get her to dress and then you know and then she and they were right up front and he just kept you know kissing on her and making love and almost in her lap and and brother Brandon was say hey this is this is religious service don't do that here and and going on and then he said I said stop and and going on and then he then he says and then it just like death presence of the Lord he says and the whole audience felt it and he says the angel of the Lord says they're in your hands do with them as you wish wow wow wasn't he he was a weak I I I believe I'd have to go back and refresh myself but he he was warned ahead of time uh by by the angel of the Lord saying um there it's there's a trap set that there's there's a trap it said handle be wise and um and that and that's the deal how many how many traps go go before us and we just walk right into them because we're not we're not walking in the maturity of the word like we should and um uh but but he did and so he said he said those he said that couple they knew it they just they were just they were scared to death and brother Bram says I forgive you wow wow yeah yeah you know matter of fact we we need to find that and put that quote on on the prayer page that's that that is true amen yeah amen near the end just the last couple days I'm really starting to feel a whole lot better praise the Lord praise the Lord well glory to God Amen I I'm I'm thankful for that testimony you know and I'm leaving the same for Brother John too you know he has been sick quite a bit lately and um so let's let's really let's let's really bind together in prayer for for those uh for Brother John and um um anyone else here before we we also uh want to keep uh brother Ron Spencer in our prayers as well they're going to put in some more stance tomorrow he he had he had one Sten put in he going to put some more Sten in and and then um uh they're thinking that the chemo that he's been taken is what um gave him the uh what caused this and so we just want want to keep praying for brother Ron Spencer amen sure we sure love brother Ron um amen why don't we just sing that simple song he is Lord he is Lord he is Lord he has risen from the dead and he is [Music] Lord every need shall die every T come for the [Music] Jesus [Music] Christ oh he is yes you are yes you are oh he is thank you Lord he has risen from the dead and you're my Lord You're My Lord I love you Jesus [Music] every shall every [Music] [Applause] [Music] Christ if you've not made a full surrender tonight why don't you just surrender everything you are to maybe there's some here that has just struggled all your life and just total surrender while the presence of the Lord is here this evening why don't you just surrender you say how how do I do it well Pride's the only thing that'll keep you from surrender it takes it takes an admission that you're wrong and that God's word is right and you surrender to him and as we pray say Lord let this be the year that I Surrender so that I can
