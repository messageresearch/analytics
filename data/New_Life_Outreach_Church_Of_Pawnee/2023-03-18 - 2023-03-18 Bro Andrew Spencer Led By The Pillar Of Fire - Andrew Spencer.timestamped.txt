[41:43] man how many has a need that you like to

[41:48] man God sees each and every one of your
[41:51] hands this morning and
[41:54] if it wouldn't make you feel too
[41:55] uncomfortable this morning maybe a
[41:57] brother to a brother or sister to a
[41:59] sister
[42:00] would come here today to give praise to
[42:03] the Lord of all
[42:05] I know that there's needs that are still
[42:07] amongst us we saw so many victories last
[42:10] night
[42:12] we are needy people but he's the god
[42:14] that supplies and we are told by science
[42:17] that when we lay our hands upon one
[42:20] another that there is a light that
[42:21] transfers
[42:23] and I believe that we are carriers
[42:26] of the pillar of fire and maybe you just
[42:28] lay your hands over on your brother not
[42:31] just praying for yourself just now
[42:32] praying for your brother your sister
[42:34] there let's go to the father in prayer
[42:36] Heavenly Father what a privilege it is
[42:38] Lord
[42:39] for us as your children Lord to be
[42:41] gathered one more time here under the
[42:44] opening of the word father or to
[42:47] recognize that we are not just a people
[42:49] but Lord we've been ordained to Stand
[42:52] Here In This Moment Lord
[42:54] it's your spirit that has drawn us to
[42:56] your father and we recognize that it's
[42:58] you that is calling upon your children
[43:00] today Lord to lift up their hands father
[43:03] to recognize that they have a need
[43:06] and they recognize that you are God that
[43:08] can supply all of their needs Lord Jesus
[43:11] science tells us that we shouldn't even
[43:13] be able to lift our hands but we have
[43:14] defied gravity this morning by lifting
[43:17] our hands to the god of Abraham Isaac
[43:21] and Jacob but you're not just their God
[43:23] you're our God this morning
[43:26] and Lord we lift our hands and surrender
[43:28] and we say father come and take us and
[43:31] make us to be what you'd have us to be
[43:34] father Lord we are looking unto you the
[43:36] author and the finisher of our faith
[43:38] this morning I pray Lord that the mighty
[43:41] Angel would Lord wrap his arms around me
[43:43] Father Lord strengthen this vessel
[43:46] father of clay that you would use it for
[43:48] the glory of the Lord Lord I sense a
[43:51] great outpouring of your spirit father
[43:52] here today and I ask Lord that you would
[43:55] move aside every little skeptic of
[43:58] unbelief father every little chain of
[44:00] doubt and you would begin to move in
[44:03] Father Lord right now I pray that you
[44:06] would allow these sixth sense to go to
[44:09] work father Lord that we would get in
[44:11] tune father with the supernatural right
[44:14] now and that you'd come and move in this
[44:16] place today Lord where are your children
[44:18] and we love you so we give you Praise In
[44:21] The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ
[44:22] [Music]
[44:24] a man if you have your Bibles this
[44:26] morning we'd like to look over into a
[44:28] couple places in the Bible
[44:31] over in the book of Exodus chapter 13.
[44:36] Exodus chapter 13 and verse 21 and
[44:40] we certainly enjoyed being in the
[44:42] presence of the Lord last night and
[44:43] watching
[44:45] watching the angel of the Lord begin to
[44:47] move in this place and
[44:49] I just counter the privilege to be
[44:52] standing here we again want to say thank
[44:54] you to brother Wendell and and the
[44:56] church for inviting us to be a part of

[45:14] I don't plan on running out of a
[45:16] friendship with him we're going to spend
[45:18] eternity together amen
[45:21] amen Exodus chapter 13 and verse 21 and
[45:25] the Lord went before them
[45:27] by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them
[45:31] the way and by not in the pillar of fire
[45:33] to give them light and to go by day and
[45:36] night he took not away the pillar of the
[45:39] cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by
[45:42] night from before the people Romans
[45:45] chapter 8 and verse 11.
[45:48] Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 and
[45:51] as you're as you're turning there this
[45:53] morning I'd like to
[45:55] I'd like to read a portion of a quote
[45:57] the Branham speaks here and in the
[45:59] message absolute
[46:01] he said now you see we are not a divided
[46:04] people
[46:07] we've got to be in unity
[46:09] because each one of us
[46:12] holding a part of God
[46:14] and we must come together
[46:16] and then the pillar of fire is
[46:18] manifested in the wholeness in the
[46:20] fullness of it when his church sets
[46:22] together in Heavenly places then the
[46:24] fullness of the power of God is in his
[46:27] church then the fullness of the power of
[46:30] God is in his church not when we're
[46:33] divided but when we come together in
[46:35] unity each one of us is holding
[46:38] spiritual gifts and spiritual offices
[46:40] coming together brings that Pillar of
[46:43] Fire back again
[46:45] Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 but if the
[46:48] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[46:50] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[46:53] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[46:55] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[46:56] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[46:59] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[47:00] after the flesh for if you live after
[47:02] the flesh you shall die but if ye
[47:05] through the spirit do mortify the Deeds
[47:07] of the body you shall live for as many
[47:10] as are led by the spirit of God they are
[47:13] the sons of God may God bless his word
[47:16] you may be seated in the presence of the
[47:18] Lord and today by the help of the Lord
[47:20] I'd like to speak to you on a thought of
[47:22] lead by the pillar of fire led by the
[47:25] pillar of fire brother Brandon said he
[47:27] said one of the greatest things that I
[47:29] found in Christian Life is letting the
[47:31] Holy Spirit lead you and guide you one
[47:34] of the greatest things in life is seeing
[47:37] to let the Holy Spirit lead you and
[47:39] guide you and here is the prophet of the
[47:42] age a prophet messenger that has come
[47:43] and has seen so many mighty miracles
[47:45] vehicles that has transpired and things
[47:48] that have happened but he said the
[47:49] greatest thing that I've found in
[47:51] Christian life is to be led by the Holy
[47:54] Spirit and we know that he is the one
[47:56] that has led us here to this Camp he it
[47:59] was not nobody here that drugged you
[48:01] here but it was the very Spirit of the
[48:03] Living God that has led you under this
[48:05] camp and we recognize that that the
[48:08] message that we are under that it makes
[48:09] us a prophetic class of people that we
[48:12] have recognized that it is his doing
[48:14] that is brought about the works of
[48:16] Christ that is that has led us here and
[48:18] we recognize that that we are not just a
[48:21] people but we've been ordained and so
[48:23] being ordained it makes us sensitive to
[48:25] the power of the Holy Ghost and it's a
[48:27] very powerful thing to recognize and to
[48:30] to witness that the Holy Spirit wants to
[48:32] lead you and he wants to guide you
[48:34] throughout all of your life and all of
[48:36] your good times he wants to lead you in
[48:38] all of your bad times he wants to lead
[48:40] you and he'll be there with you as the
[48:42] Bible said that I'll never leave you and
[48:45] I will never forsake you you and we
[48:46] recognize that even this morning that
[48:48] the pillar of fire is in the building
[48:50] this morning we recognize that Jesus
[48:52] said that where two or three are
[48:53] gathered in my name there I will be in
[48:56] the midst of them so he is here today he
[48:58] is leading you in worship he is leading
[49:00] you in Praise he is leading you in to be
[49:03] able to say Amen to the word of God he's
[49:05] LED you here every energy here that will
[49:07] be that will be exposed today or be to
[49:10] to be to be released it will be by the
[49:13] leadership of the Holy Ghost I believe
[49:15] that I believe that if if it's if it's
[49:17] that easy for men to be able to work us
[49:19] up then we ought to be able to go down
[49:21] to Walmart and work everybody up down
[49:23] there but it is it's not that but it's
[49:25] the leadership of the Holy Ghost that is
[49:28] leading the children of God to respond
[49:30] to the word of God it's a deed that is
[49:32] calling to the Deep he's the one that
[49:34] has brought us here he's a god that'll
[49:37] take us all the way through he was God
[49:39] when he was back there with the children
[49:41] of Israel when they had journeyed for 40
[49:43] years and they'd wandered around that
[49:45] mountain and they they wandered around
[49:46] but you know that the Bible said the
[49:49] Bible tells us that they never had the
[49:50] shoes never worn out they never had to
[49:52] go to another department store to buy
[49:54] new shoes or to get a little medicine
[49:56] bag to find out if they could find
[49:58] Healing down there at the pharmacy but
[50:00] they had one scripture that I am the
[50:02] Lord thy God that healeth thee and you
[50:05] know Moses didn't have nothing to do
[50:06] with that it wasn't the man that had
[50:08] anything to do with it it was the angel
[50:10] of the Lord that was leading them that
[50:13] was taking care of them so young people
[50:15] I want you to I want you to recognize
[50:17] that that same Angel is in the room
[50:19] today he's still leading the children of
[50:21] God right here right now and he's not
[50:24] ashamed to work in this place it doesn't
[50:26] matter how you came into this Camp he's
[50:28] not ashamed of where you came in at but
[50:31] he knows exactly how you're going to
[50:33] leave and I'll say this that the holy
[50:35] spirit is the god that is going to lead
[50:37] you out of this camp and I want you to
[50:39] know you're going to be an overcomer
[50:40] you're going to be a winner you're not
[50:42] going to be a Survivor but you're going
[50:44] to be an overcomer you're going to be
[50:46] able to make it you're going to be able
[50:48] to go all the way through you're going
[50:49] in the Rapture because the pillar of
[50:51] fire is here to lead you all the way
[50:53] because we are not under the leadership
[50:55] of a man we are under the influence of
[50:58] the mighty Angel it is his effect of
[51:01] this message that has transpired our
[51:03] life to where we are it is not Ron
[51:05] Spencer that has called us it's not
[51:07] Wendell Martin that has called us it's
[51:09] not Tim Pruitt that has called us it's
[51:11] not Joseph Branham that has called us
[51:13] it's not some of these other great men
[51:15] out there it's the power
[51:18] of the Holy Ghost that has brought us
[51:20] under the message if it was that easy
[51:23] Hallelujah that anybody could come but
[51:25] because God deposited a gene seed of God
[51:28] on the inside of the elect of God is the
[51:31] reason why that you feel the call on
[51:33] your life to be led by the Holy Spirit
[51:38] you see you are being led by a mighty a
[51:41] mighty conqueror that has never lost a
[51:43] battle I want you to know his record is
[51:45] perfect this morning he's never lost one
[51:48] of his children he's never one law he's
[51:50] never lost one fight he's never lost one
[51:52] battle he has a perfect record today I
[51:55] know there's a lot of people that are
[51:57] upset at March Madness today because
[51:59] their back brackets got busted but I
[52:01] want you to know God's bracket has never
[52:03] been busted when he scored the greatest
[52:06] touchdown or the greatest goal that
[52:08] there was two thousand years ago he's
[52:10] still the reigning Champion today he's a
[52:13] champion of Life he's the champion of
[52:15] the supernatural he's here to prove
[52:17] himself alive in the Church of the
[52:20] Living God
[52:22] we are here and we are being led by the
[52:25] church we are being led by Mighty
[52:27] conqueror it has been said that an army
[52:29] of sheep led by a lion will always
[52:31] defeat an army of lions that is led by a
[52:34] sheep you see it matters who you're
[52:36] being led by you see you are not led by
[52:39] some weak little wimpy cat today but you
[52:42] are being led by the lion of the tribe
[52:44] of Judah and when William Branham he
[52:46] come and preached the eagle as the eagle
[52:48] stirs its nest he said you are kin to
[52:51] the lion of tribe of Judah you have a
[52:53] Stern this you have a bravery you have a
[52:56] tenacity you have a firmness in the
[52:59] Church of the Living God there is no
[53:01] backing down in the Church of the Living
[53:03] God when the pillar of fire got angry
[53:05] and he looked at the Red Sea and he
[53:08] opened up the Red Sea that same pillar
[53:10] fire is looking over your life and he's
[53:13] pushing sin back he's pushing depression
[53:16] back and I want you to know there is no
[53:19] circumstance that can stand in front of
[53:21] the pillar fire
[53:23] is here to lead the Church of the Living
[53:25] God ain't no wonder Moses could stand
[53:28] out there as a man and it can lead 2
[53:30] million right out there in the face of
[53:32] opposition it was because Jehovah's
[53:34] leading and if Jehovah was leading then
[53:37] brother Nathan he's leading right now
[53:41] he led them right out there knowing
[53:43] knowing that Jehovah was the one that
[53:45] was leading them you see they had
[53:47] Joseph's bones
[53:49] they had Joseph's bones but they needed
[53:52] a fresh scene of what God was it was
[53:55] more than just working on the bones of a
[53:56] prophet and said we're going to go out
[53:58] of here but they needed to see the
[54:00] supernatural for themselves let me tell
[54:02] you it's not enough for the supernatural
[54:04] just to dwell in William branham's
[54:06] Ministry in his personal Ministry you've
[54:08] got to have the supernatural you've got
[54:10] to have the Holy Ghost you need to see
[54:12] miracles happen
[54:14] you'll say brother Andrew I've never
[54:16] seen a miracle in my life have you got
[54:18] the new birth it's the greatest miracle
[54:20] that there ever has been or ever will be
[54:23] we can have healing demonstrations or
[54:25] manifestations eyes being opened the
[54:28] ears being opened but the greatest
[54:30] miracle that there is
[54:32] a new birth
[54:34] you know brother banham said he said
[54:36] that same star that led the wise men up
[54:38] there to baby Jesus it's the same one
[54:41] that is leading you to the new birth
[54:43] right now he's not leading you into
[54:45] destruction
[54:47] he's not leading you into defeat he's
[54:49] not leading you into something that he
[54:51] can't get you out of he is leading you
[54:53] into something that'll grow you give you
[54:55] a greater Victory and a greater glory
[54:58] and when God gets done with your life
[55:00] young people you can expect greatness in
[55:03] your life you can expect miracles in
[55:05] your life you can expect the
[55:06] supernatural in your life you're being
[55:08] led by the Holy Ghost and he's here to
[55:11] take you
[55:16] Hallelujah
[55:18] now notice what brother random says he
[55:19] said he said we know that the angel that
[55:22] let Moses was the angel of the Covenant
[55:24] which was Christ the son of God he said
[55:26] or the logos that came out of God was
[55:28] the son of God he said God delivered the
[55:31] children of Israel when they were in
[55:33] bondage and he couldn't help themselves
[55:35] he said but today God's people are not
[55:38] in bondage
[55:43] you hear what I'm talking to you today
[55:46] God's people are not in bonded
[55:49] spiritually for they are delivered by
[55:51] the Holy Ghost
[55:53] come on wake the devil up tell him
[55:56] you're not in bondage you're not in fear
[55:59] you're not in depression you are
[56:01] delivered by the power of the Holy Ghost
[56:03] and there is no chain that can hold you
[56:06] back from being the potential as a son
[56:08] and daughter of God there is nothing
[56:10] that is too great for my Jehovah he
[56:13] knows how to destroy the Red Sea he
[56:15] knows how to destroy Pharaoh you're not
[56:17] in the bonded spiritually
[56:19] I'll tell you the same one that led
[56:21] Peter out of the prison is the same one
[56:23] that is here and is leading his children
[56:25] he's breaking every shackle he's
[56:27] breaking every fear he's breaking every
[56:30] little cycle of humanity that's been in
[56:32] your life the holy spirit is here to
[56:34] lead you out of the prison cell wake up
[56:38] wake up Peter wake up it's time to Mark
[56:41] it's time to walk out of here oh I say
[56:45] oh God let God arise and let his enemies
[56:48] be scattered

[56:51] it's time that you wake up because there
[56:54] have been prayer that's made up you made
[56:56] up for you upper and John Marsh house

[57:16] are not going to be unanswered they are
[57:18] going to be answered it might shock you
[57:21] when the answer gets coming to your way
[57:23] but there is a prayer that is going to
[57:26] be answered and brother random said in
[57:28] the Sixth Sense he said all of them
[57:30] prayers had accumulated itself around
[57:33] that Jail's hell where Peter was and the
[57:36] angel
[57:38] the angel slipped into the window he
[57:41] slipped into the window and he tapped
[57:43] Peter on the side and said wake up
[57:46] wake up young people wake up the seven
[57:49] Thunders had uttered their voices and we
[57:51] are woken that the lamb is amongst us

[58:02] doors he's so powerful he can slip

[58:26] up to things that they they thought was
[58:28] bad or things things that they shouldn't
[58:30] have done but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:32] has been awoken since 1963 when God
[58:36] revealed the seals

[58:40] to the fact that the son of man is
[58:43] manifested in the bride's body and I
[58:46] challenge you to believe it

[58:55] supernatural receive the supernatural
[58:57] you ask for a miracle receive a miracle
[59:03] Hallelujah he's in this place he has
[59:07] everything you have need of when Moses
[59:10] met him up there in a burning bush he
[59:12] had everything
[59:13] he had everything that Moses was lacking
[59:15] and everything that you are lacking
[59:17] young people the New Birth has for you
[59:19] you say I can't make it on my own let me
[59:22] tell you he can
[59:24] let me tell you I know what it's like to
[59:26] be hung out and strung out on drugs I
[59:28] know what it's like to be at the end of
[59:29] a bottle and I know what it's like when
[59:31] he comes and wakes you up let me tell
[59:33] you when God goes to waking you up when
[59:35] brother Bynum preaches the prodigal in
[59:37] 1950 he said that angel went down there
[59:40] the angel went down there and woke him
[59:43] up well wake up
[59:46] wake up you are no longer a prodigal no
[59:49] more you've been ordained to be in the
[59:52] father's house
[59:53] Father's House of Liberty a father's
[59:56] house of worship
[1:00:00] for there is therefore now no
[1:00:02] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:00:04] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:00:06] after the spirit I want you to say it
[1:00:08] out loud there ain't no chains on me
[1:00:11] there ain't no condemnation on me there
[1:00:13] is no sin on me the blood is pardon me
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:20] hallelujah
[1:00:22] hallelujah you're being led by a pillar
[1:00:25] of fire and there's a major difference
[1:00:27] between a pill or fire and a pillar of
[1:00:29] salt at Sea what the difference is is
[1:00:31] which way you turn to it I have turned
[1:00:33] my eyes towards Jesus
[1:00:36] let me tell you the pillar of fire is
[1:00:38] not something that we just talked about
[1:00:39] with our imagination that we say he's in
[1:00:41] the room he's here
[1:00:43] foreign
[1:00:44] you to believe that he's here he's here
[1:00:47] it ain't the second person in the
[1:00:50] Trinity it ain't the third person it is
[1:00:52] Elohim and Elohim has made his say his
[1:00:55] way back into the bride's body again she
[1:00:58] has the same characteristics as he had
[1:01:01] If he if we're going to be identified
[1:01:03] with anything we're going to be
[1:01:05] identified with the characteristics of
[1:01:07] Jehovah if Moses recognized him as the
[1:01:10] characteristics of the Voice who spoke
[1:01:12] to Abraham he recognized that the same
[1:01:14] character that was speaking to him at
[1:01:16] that burning bush he was more than able
[1:01:18] to make a son of man Invasion down there
[1:01:20] in Egypt and get all of his children out
[1:01:22] I say that the son of man is making an
[1:01:24] invasion into this camp
[1:01:27] the Lord's working in this place and
[1:01:29] when the word goes to work it
[1:01:32] there ain't nothing going to stop the
[1:01:33] word Creeds can't stop it theologians
[1:01:36] can't stop it ideas can't stop it the
[1:01:39] Lord is here for you young people
[1:01:44] what takes a man of God off of his notes
[1:01:46] what takes a man of God to come down and
[1:01:49] work through your 1010 alley it's the
[1:01:51] spirit of the Living God that is working
[1:01:53] in you let me tell you he knew where
[1:01:55] eunuch was one time and the angel
[1:01:57] directed he directed Philip over there
[1:02:00] the angel was the one that was directing
[1:02:02] it but the gene seed of God the germ had
[1:02:05] to come through the body he couldn't
[1:02:06] come to the angel the Angels here this
[1:02:09] morning the anointing is here this
[1:02:11] morning but he's working through my body
[1:02:14] to bring you to the realization that you
[1:02:16] don't need no theology you don't need no
[1:02:18] education you don't need some work up
[1:02:21] all you need is what the angel has the
[1:02:24] angel is depositing on the inside of you
[1:02:28] what God ordained you to believe
[1:02:32] let me tell you I've been a follower of
[1:02:34] this Pillar of Fire for many years now
[1:02:35] and he's never left me wrong he's never
[1:02:38] let me down a case where he led me to a
[1:02:40] spot that I was going to lose the battle
[1:02:42] he's always rose up as the mighty
[1:02:45] conqueror he's in these brothers he's in
[1:02:48] these sisters and he's working the works
[1:02:50] of discernment right now
[1:02:54] it's right here
[1:02:56] he's moving mother Madam said he said if
[1:02:59] you want to see what that angel looked
[1:03:00] like he said because in Exodus 23 he
[1:03:03] said behold I'll send an angel before
[1:03:04] thee to keep you in the way he said if
[1:03:06] you want to see what that angel looked
[1:03:07] like he said you look over in Exodus 13
[1:03:10] and 21 he said and the Lord went before
[1:03:12] them
[1:03:15] this is what the angel looks like the
[1:03:17] Lord went before them in a pillar of
[1:03:18] cloud to lead them in the way by night
[1:03:20] in the pillar of fire to give them light
[1:03:23] and to go by day and night and he took
[1:03:25] not away the pillar of cloud by day nor
[1:03:28] the pillar of Fire by night from before

[1:06:49] they looked out there and they seen the
[1:06:51] Statue of Liberty they began to cry they
[1:06:53] begin to weep because it was a sign of
[1:06:55] the freedom was on the other side of

[1:07:27] Devices he's looking for a live body
[1:07:29] somebody that'll leave out his message

[1:07:33] have went in a Rapture in 1965. but God

[1:07:56] wanting you to get the dynamic power of

[1:08:00] your fears it's greater than all your

[1:08:04] long he's everything that you have need
[1:08:06] of in this life's journey he'll be your
[1:08:08] everything
[1:08:19] he swore to you that he before you he
[1:08:22] gave you a promise that this land is
[1:08:24] your land
[1:08:26] he said it's not just for your mamas and
[1:08:28] daddies but God's raising up a new
[1:08:30] generation
[1:08:31] come on somebody you know where you're
[1:08:33] living at you're in a Joshua Commission
[1:08:36] you're under the greatest commission
[1:08:38] that there ever was it's time to go into
[1:08:40] your Fallen Heritage you are fully
[1:08:42] adopted as Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:08:45] walk in there and take your Liberty and
[1:08:47] tell the amarats to get out tell the
[1:08:49] jebusites to get out
[1:08:53] brother Nathan
[1:08:55] I heard the prophet say that there as
[1:08:59] soon as God made a promise to Abraham
[1:09:01] for 660 to 685 years
[1:09:05] they're the amarats he said since that
[1:09:08] time the amorites went in there the
[1:09:10] jebusites went in there to go in there
[1:09:12] and take over that land
[1:09:16] 660 years they'd went over there
[1:09:20] since the time they heard the promise
[1:09:22] you know the devil's real close wherever
[1:09:24] the word at Satan wherever the word's at
[1:09:26] Satan's real close
[1:09:28] so he's hearing what is happening right
[1:09:30] here now brother Brandon would say he
[1:09:32] said he would say in one place he said
[1:09:33] now Satan can't know what's in my heart
[1:09:36] he said but as soon as I speak it he
[1:09:38] said then he'll go to work but you know
[1:09:40] there's something in my heart that is
[1:09:42] burning right here today that's 660
[1:09:45] years they went out there to work but it
[1:09:47] only took Joshua it only took Joshua
[1:09:50] seven days to go into Jericho and
[1:09:53] overthrow it and the devil that's been
[1:09:55] working against your family history for
[1:09:57] six thousand years our great Jehovah is
[1:10:00] here to lead you out of your trouble
[1:10:08] freedom
[1:10:10] it's a wonderful thing
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:13] Freedom's a wonderful thing
[1:10:16] there's one thing God hates it's a
[1:10:19] powerless religion
[1:10:21] and if you ain't got no blood on your
[1:10:23] sacrifice you have a powerless religion
[1:10:26] but today we have the greatest message
[1:10:29] that there is
[1:10:30] we are covered by the blood of the Lamb
[1:10:33] there is still Mercy On The Mercy Seat
[1:10:35] it doesn't matter how far you are out in
[1:10:37] sin the pillar of fire has been
[1:10:39] searching for you you may have thought
[1:10:41] well I'm just going about my life and
[1:10:43] going about my business the pillar of
[1:10:45] fire has been hunting for you
[1:10:48] he's been hunting for you and you
[1:10:49] thought that you were just coming for a
[1:10:51] crumb but the angel has everything that
[1:10:53] you have need of
[1:10:54] he's everything that you want in life
[1:10:56] he's everything that you have need of
[1:10:58] the Angels here
[1:11:02] William Brandon would say that one since
[1:11:04] I've that I've watched ever since I was
[1:11:06] a little bitty child
[1:11:07] he said his standing no further than two
[1:11:09] feet away from you
[1:11:11] you see if you want angels to appear to
[1:11:13] you you've got to keep your mind on them
[1:11:17] is that right
[1:11:18] that's what Mary was doing she had her
[1:11:20] mind on them scriptures
[1:11:22] she had a mind on them angels she got to
[1:11:24] thinking about that virgin that was
[1:11:26] going to rise up in a scene and in a
[1:11:28] certain season she began to think on him
[1:11:30] and the angel appeared to him the Bible
[1:11:33] said in John 1 and 11 that Zacharias was
[1:11:36] up there offering incense at the temple
[1:11:38] he was up there doing what he was called
[1:11:40] to do he's brother random said he said
[1:11:42] if you want angels to appear to you get
[1:11:44] your house in order like zachariah's
[1:11:45] house was in order he was up there to
[1:11:47] worshiping God
[1:11:49] and the angel appeared on the right side
[1:11:51] of the Altar and when William Branham
[1:11:53] was standing there and he's going
[1:11:54] through those scriptures he's looking
[1:11:55] into those things he looks over and he
[1:11:58] begins to think about all of the things
[1:11:59] that is happening he said that's why I
[1:12:02] bring those prayer lines up there on my
[1:12:05] right side he said because that's where
[1:12:06] the angel stands I happen to say this to
[1:12:09] you that I believe that the great angel
[1:12:12] of Gabriel has come to give us a message
[1:12:15] not to leave us where we are let me tell
[1:12:18] you if theologians could have done it
[1:12:20] the Unicorn had got it when he was up
[1:12:22] there in Jerusalem if theologians could
[1:12:24] have done it they'd have gotten a prayer
[1:12:26] when he was up there and wore it when he
[1:12:27] was up there in worship but he had to
[1:12:29] come down there where the message was at
[1:12:31] that there was a holy ghost after being
[1:12:33] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ and the word worked its way out
[1:12:39] the word is working its way out right
[1:12:41] here this morning and you know that God
[1:12:44] has given you a promise that I'll never
[1:12:46] leave you I'll never forsake you I'll
[1:12:48] give you the same holy ghost that was
[1:12:50] back there in Paul's day it's the same
[1:12:52] Holy Ghost right now and if Paul could
[1:12:54] get it you can kid it if Caleb could get
[1:12:57] it you can get it if Colby could get it
[1:13:00] you can get it if Andrew can get it you
[1:13:03] can get it and shaken is here listening
[1:13:06] to these things this morning and he's
[1:13:07] trying to keep you from your promises
[1:13:09] and saying you've got to wait for
[1:13:10] another day when Satan hears about you
[1:13:13] getting ready to possess new land of
[1:13:15] healing of blessings and deliverance he
[1:13:18] will try to move in there and occupy and
[1:13:20] keep you away from your blessings but
[1:13:22] the angel is here to make sure that you
[1:13:24] get your visitation
[1:13:28] he ain't worried about how old you are
[1:13:30] ain't worried about how sick you are if
[1:13:32] he was able to get to say right 90 years
[1:13:34] old surely he can get to a 15 year old
[1:13:37] girl
[1:13:43] foreign
[1:13:44] you know what it's like you know what
[1:13:46] it's like to be in the presence of the
[1:13:47] Angel and the angel says he's coming by
[1:13:48] your house tonight you know what it's
[1:13:50] like when all the things that you've
[1:13:52] been fearing about the things that
[1:13:53] you've been asking about all of a sudden
[1:13:55] he comes by your house and your house is
[1:13:57] completely different he made it one way
[1:13:59] he made it perfect one time he's in the
[1:14:01] way of making it perfect again fear is
[1:14:03] over depression is over the things that
[1:14:06] hunt you in your nighttime they're over
[1:14:07] it's over welcome back to a new family
[1:14:10] the angel is working in the neighborhood
[1:14:14] and if you can make tumors drop off if
[1:14:16] you can make gallbladders or make make
[1:14:18] different things fall off the Angels
[1:14:20] working in here
[1:14:22] this is that that was prophesied by the
[1:14:25] prophet troll that in the last days I
[1:14:27] pour out my spirit and when he poured
[1:14:28] out in Acts 2 is what he's pouring out
[1:14:30] right now
[1:14:32] I pray that there comes such Assurance
[1:14:35] of the Holy Ghost let me tell you young
[1:14:37] people you are on the verge of the
[1:14:40] greatest move that you've ever seen he's
[1:14:42] still moving he's still working he's
[1:14:45] still making ways
[1:14:49] go ahead and back off me devil give me
[1:14:52] enough room here to work today you can't
[1:14:54] hold them no longer they're God's
[1:14:56] children you can't hold them back
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:02] you may have held him back before they
[1:15:05] got in this presence but they are in the
[1:15:07] presence of one that ain't scared of you
[1:15:08] devil
[1:15:10] you can try to threaten them with all
[1:15:12] kinds of ideas that you're only going to
[1:15:14] go so far and it's only going to be a
[1:15:16] camp experience but what Moses got he
[1:15:19] walked away from there completely
[1:15:21] changed and what you are experiencing
[1:15:26] you're in the atmosphere
[1:15:29] of the Angel of the Lord
[1:15:32] if we could walk out there
[1:15:35] it could walk out there and say what are
[1:15:37] you hunting for
[1:15:39] those things were sovereignly given
[1:15:41] if you could walk out there on Colorado
[1:15:43] Mountain
[1:15:45] and he could bring peace to a storm
[1:15:49] if you could walk out there
[1:15:51] and know that media Branham had those
[1:15:53] tumors on her body
[1:15:55] and said before the doctor ever touches

[1:16:23] sky the Bible says in First John 3 and 2
[1:16:25] that now are we the sons of God
[1:16:29] and if we are right now we have the
[1:16:31] abilities of the father
[1:16:35] I know where I'm at like an abstract I
[1:16:38] gotta write to these young people

[1:16:59] pillar of fire is working in this place
[1:17:02] yeah
[1:17:04] I'm trying to make you aware that the
[1:17:06] same Pillar of Fire that showed up with
[1:17:08] William Branham is in this room right
[1:17:10] now
[1:17:14] you've been wanting to see him
[1:17:16] take a look around
[1:17:20] come on now take a look around
[1:17:23] he's circling in the building right now
[1:17:25] he's the one that's leading these words
[1:17:27] he's the one that's leading this message
[1:17:29] he's the one that's controlling this
[1:17:31] atmosphere if he wasn't that kind of a
[1:17:33] god you'd have never got in the building
[1:17:37] Satan would have made to go he'd have
[1:17:40] made you sick but because the Angel's
[1:17:42] been circling the camp
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:47] blessed be the name of the Lord if I was
[1:17:50] a preacher or if I was if I was an
[1:17:52] atomatic person I'd climb them shingles
[1:17:55] I'd climb on top of that thing I'd
[1:17:57] shouted from the rooftops he's still
[1:17:59] alive
[1:18:01] yeah
[1:18:03] come on somebody we are here to shake
[1:18:06] the kingdom of hell so let's raise the
[1:18:09] roof let's shake the rafters let's shake
[1:18:11] down the stalactite to Hell drop them in
[1:18:14] the devil's eye we are the Victorious
[1:18:16] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:20] I'm taking you somewhere
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:27] foreign
[1:18:29] he's working right here
[1:18:32] it wasn't the water that healed the
[1:18:35] people when they got in the water it was
[1:18:37] the angel on the water
[1:18:40] I want to tell you he's working in here
[1:18:42] he's working in here how do you know
[1:18:45] that he's working in here I'm watching
[1:18:47] the moving of the water right now and if
[1:18:49] you study out the Bible Waters
[1:18:51] representing Waters represent people and
[1:18:54] I'm watching it the water is rolling
[1:18:56] backwards it's a supernatural move of
[1:18:58] the Holy Ghost he's whirling in here so
[1:19:01] I know that the Angels here you'll never
[1:19:04] raise your hand you don't never danced
[1:19:06] in the spirit you'd have never spoke in
[1:19:08] tongues but because the Angels won the
[1:19:10] water
[1:19:16] that's right ain't it
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:27] suppose them children looking on back
[1:19:28] there when them serpents came in and bit
[1:19:31] them we went up there and looked at that
[1:19:33] Brazen that Brazen serpent on that pole
[1:19:35] what was they looking at it wasn't the
[1:19:38] pole but it was the angel on the pole
[1:19:41] what was it it's like this if you would
[1:19:44] take a break up go to a bank president
[1:19:46] and said now I want you to know that
[1:19:49] there is a there is an account that is
[1:19:51] coming open it's coming open in 2000
[1:19:54] years and there's going to be a large
[1:19:56] deposit or in 2000 years upon upon this
[1:20:00] account and I want to withdraw I want to
[1:20:03] draw interest on that account that bank
[1:20:05] president would say you're absolutely
[1:20:07] crazy there ain't nothing to draw from
[1:20:10] but because God is the greatest Banker
[1:20:12] that there ever has been he looked into
[1:20:14] the bank of heaven and he knew that the
[1:20:16] Son of God was slain before the
[1:20:19] foundation of the world so he was able
[1:20:21] to draw interest
[1:20:23] and the angel was looking at a full
[1:20:25] atonement that the price had already
[1:20:27] been paid if they were looking at it
[1:20:30] that sin had already been judged what
[1:20:33] about it young people your sin is judged
[1:20:35] the perfect lamb took your spot
[1:20:39] come on

[1:22:39] supernatural realm and I believed that
[1:22:42] cancer is defeated at the cross 2000
[1:22:44] years ago it would do me no good to
[1:22:47] preach to you today that cancer is
[1:22:49] defeated if it wasn't all ready to feed
[1:22:51] it if Jesus didn't already say the wrong
[1:22:53] Spencer was healed I wouldn't stand up
[1:22:55] here and testify about it but because I
[1:22:58] understand by the books
[1:23:01] [Applause]

[1:23:50] voice of a Critic
[1:23:52] let me tell you something young people
[1:23:54] we have come too far to start listening
[1:23:56] to the voice of our critics when we
[1:23:59] ought to be listening to the voice of
[1:24:00] the mighty angel that has told us that
[1:24:03] there has been a release of the
[1:24:05] supernatural in this place he said I am

[1:25:24] Nathan
[1:25:26] when it's impossible
[1:25:31] the angel knows how to make the
[1:25:33] impossible possible
[1:25:43] who they didn't look like another child
[1:25:44] was coming by your way

[1:25:55] laughs
[1:25:59] nobody can sing you don't know like I

[1:26:28] around your body it can go to working in
[1:26:31] there and make you stiff but when the
[1:26:33] angel goes to working that's going to
[1:26:35] become a flexibility to your back pain
[1:26:38] [Applause]

[1:26:44] how many has been healed in this place
[1:26:46] before
[1:26:48] how many knows the power of Resurrection
[1:26:49] how many notes of power being saved in
[1:26:52] this place

[1:26:58] person is dancing the way that their
[1:27:00] person they're dancing you may not
[1:27:02] understand the reason why they're
[1:27:03] shouting like they're shouting but if
[1:27:05] you were standing in the shoes that they
[1:27:06] were standing in if you walk to mile in
[1:27:08] their shoes you'd understand this Shout
[1:27:11] if you was locked up like I was locked
[1:27:13] up you'd understand the power of the key
[1:27:16] being turned over yourself when the
[1:27:18] angel walked in and let you out
[1:27:21] foreign
[1:27:23] and he's changing his mass that same
[1:27:26] pillar fire that Paul met is heard today
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:31] what is it it's our same Lord Jesus
[1:27:34] Christ working in the bride's body he
[1:27:38] emptied himself out he poured himself
[1:27:40] into the Church of the Living God and in
[1:27:43] the last days this Third Exodus is when
[1:27:46] the pillar fire takes the bride from the
[1:27:49] church
[1:27:52] we're not a part of a denomination we're
[1:27:55] not a part of some move of 60 years ago
[1:27:58] we're a move of right now
[1:27:59] [Applause]
[1:28:27] we're right here
[1:28:29] on the greatest return that there ever
[1:28:31] has been
[1:28:33] the return of the power of Pentecost
[1:28:39] I ain't talking about some movement that
[1:28:41] happened in 1906 we're not even part of
[1:28:44] a movement of man this is a move of the
[1:28:46] Holy Ghost
[1:28:49] you have been restored to the faith of
[1:28:52] the Pentecostal fathers your heart has
[1:28:55] been turned back you know where you're
[1:28:57] standing at you could not have got here
[1:28:59] unless the message Led you here
[1:29:01] you could have never come to this
[1:29:03] knowledge unless the father LED you to
[1:29:05] this knowledge but because he loved you
[1:29:07] he gave you the greatest weapon that
[1:29:10] there ever has been he equipped you with
[1:29:12] the word of God to defeat every devil
[1:29:14] that you ever come up against
[1:29:16] he's not going to leave you powerless
[1:29:18] today Church you are under
[1:29:22] you are under a mighty move for the
[1:29:25] pillar fire that's shame anointing we're
[1:29:28] not just her and under an Acts 2
[1:29:29] anointing we are under a Revelations 10
[1:29:32] anointing it's a bar anointing we have a
[1:29:36] double witness that the words that I do
[1:29:38] shall you do also a greater works for me
[1:29:41] see how you do because I go into my
[1:29:43] father it's the same spirit it's the
[1:29:46] father spirit it's the father's life
[1:29:48] it's the father's will
[1:29:51] thank you
[1:29:55] Abram knew who he was talking to
[1:29:59] when he come to his tent door he knew
[1:30:00] who he was talking to
[1:30:02] it was the same voice that had led him
[1:30:04] all the way
[1:30:10] about his life he told him about his
[1:30:12] failures
[1:30:13] told him about where he come out of
[1:30:16] him
[1:30:18] and the voice that was talking to him
[1:30:21] had his back turned to the tent
[1:30:25] what was it
[1:30:28] brother Branham said he said if that
[1:30:30] Melchizedek ever was he's got to still
[1:30:33] be
[1:30:36] he said now I'm going to turn my back to
[1:30:38] the tent
[1:30:39] like Abraham like Melchizedek did
[1:30:43] what was it it was full proof that the
[1:30:46] same angel
[1:30:48] that Abraham was fellowshipping with was
[1:30:51] the same one that you are fellowshipping
[1:30:53] with he said now he said now I can't see
[1:30:56] you but I see you sitting back there in
[1:30:59] that red checkered shirt I see you back
[1:31:01] there you're dealing with this certain
[1:31:02] case you're dealing with that I see I
[1:31:05] see there's a doctor that's working over
[1:31:07] your case and it doesn't look like it's
[1:31:09] going to bring any there is no hope
[1:31:12] but our same Lord Jesus that was
[1:31:15] fellowshipping with Abraham is here to
[1:31:17] tell you that thus saith the Lord you're
[1:31:19] already healed
[1:31:22] what we said what was it it was the same
[1:31:25] Melchizedek fellowshipping right here
[1:31:28] and he's come to vindicate the word of
[1:31:30] God let me tell you the reason why I can
[1:31:33] preach to you that if you'll repent and
[1:31:35] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:31:37] Jesus Christ for the remissions of your
[1:31:39] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:31:40] the Holy Ghost is because the Bible is
[1:31:43] backing me up the reason why I can tell
[1:31:45] you that you can get the Holy Ghost the
[1:31:47] reason why I can tell you that Isaiah 53
[1:31:49] is still in effect the reason why I can
[1:31:51] tell you that Jesus Christ is alive is
[1:31:53] because the gospels are backing us up it
[1:31:56] is the framework to the Pentecostal
[1:31:58] blessing and what is the Pentecostal
[1:32:00] blessing it's a confirmation of the
[1:32:02] Resurrection that Jesus Christ is alive
[1:32:05] and well and you've been restored back
[1:32:07] to full power full Authority you are
[1:32:10] here
[1:32:12] you're here for such a time as this
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:26] what is it
[1:32:28] Satan knows that it's being identified
[1:32:31] in the body right now
[1:32:35] he knows what's happening
[1:32:39] I brought you to this moment right here
[1:32:42] because William Branham said in Christ
[1:32:44] The Mystery of God revealed he said
[1:32:45] that's why the devil's howling
[1:32:47] it's being identified in your body
[1:32:55] it's right here being identified in your
[1:32:57] body your hands shall lay hands on the
[1:33:00] sick and they shall recover now if it
[1:33:04] breaks out
[1:33:05] sin breaks out then you know what's
[1:33:08] going to happen at a certain time but if
[1:33:10] you laid your hands on a certain need
[1:33:11] and you believed it with all of your
[1:33:13] heart you can lay hands on autism and
[1:33:16] they shall be recovered you can lay
[1:33:19] hands on the sick and they shall be
[1:33:21] delivered you can take up serpents and
[1:33:24] it shall not harm you you shall drink
[1:33:26] any deadly thing and it shall not harm
[1:33:28] you you shall speak in unknown tongues
[1:33:30] come on don't you be afraid of it these
[1:33:33] gifts are in the body a gift of
[1:33:35] knowledge a gift of faith a gift of
[1:33:37] Grace a gift of speaking in tongues a
[1:33:39] gift of Prophecy and if it was restored
[1:33:42] that it's here in the bride's body don't
[1:33:44] you be afraid of the Pentecostal
[1:33:46] blessing don't you be afraid of the
[1:33:48] moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:51] [Applause]
