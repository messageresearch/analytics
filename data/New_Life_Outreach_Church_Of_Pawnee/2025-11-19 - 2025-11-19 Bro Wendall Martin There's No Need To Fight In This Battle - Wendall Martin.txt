Master, oh master, savior Jesus. Oh, like a fragrant after the rain. What a name. Oh Jesus. Jesus, Jesus. Let all heaven and earth proclaim. For kings and kingdoms will all pass away.

It's a name that devils respect. I don't care what the devil tries to teach you or what he tries to teach the world. When any devil comes into the presence of the Lord, there's a lot of fear and reverence there. But that name is exalted. That name is high. That name is greater than anything that you're facing tonight. I think recognizing him and honoring him is the greatest thing that we could ever do even in our in our battles, in our in our trials or in the darkest of nights if we could just recognize that the name of Jesus is is greater than any other name and it'll bring heaven down. Praise the Lord. Because if you fear his name, you recognize his name. He always comes where he is loved. He always comes. There's something about our thoughts should be reverent to that name. Our songs should be reverent to that name. Jesus. Jesus. Oh God. Oh God. Jesus. There's just something about your name. &gt;&gt; You're my master, my savior. You're Jesus. Like the fragrance after the rain. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Jesus Jesus. Let all heaven and earth Kings and kingdoms &gt;&gt; and kingdoms &gt;&gt; will all pass away. &gt;&gt; Oh, but there's one name. &gt;&gt; There's one name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. There's just something about that name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so thankful for that wonderful name of Jesus. wonderful presence here tonight. I loved that song that the young people sung. &gt;&gt; What a for He is truly high and lifted up. I think Amen. I believe the Lord was pleased with that song &gt;&gt; and I believe he's pleased with this That's a great song. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. What a name. We're so thankful for that. Good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Good to see everyone that has that has come. And and um we we won't keep you standing. Let's if you'd look there in the book of 2 Chronicles, the 20th chapter. Amen. And um good to good to see everyone. And um Sister Mary, what a what a wonderful job you're doing there with those young people. And I'm glad I'm I'm I'm glad for the burden that uh Mary's had to to do this. And um uh lots of u lots of uh talent in that in that group there. You and &gt;&gt; and I would say to all of you uh that are members of that choir. Amen. You know, give God your best. And and I could hear everyone all singing with all of their heart. even even our even our babies, you know, here on the front, just us singing loud and and uh we're just so thankful uh to see that and the burden that Sister Maria has for our for our youngans and and that was anointed. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's look here in in 2 Chronicles 20 and one. Then it came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Ammon with them other beside the Ammonites come against Jehoshaphat to battle. Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side of Syria, and behold, they be in Tamar, which is whatever that word is. Amen. And Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the Lord and to proclaim a fast throughout all Judah. And Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord, even out of all the cities of Judah. They come to seek the Lord. And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and said, "Oh Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven and rulest thou not over all the kingdoms of the heathen? And in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to stand withstand thee? Are not thou our God? who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever. They dwelt therein, and have built a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, If when evil cometh upon us, as the swore judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house in thy presence, for thy name is in this house, and cry unto thee in our affliction, when thou then thou will hear and help. Now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt. But they turned from them and destroyed them not. Behold, I say how they reward us to come and cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit. Oh our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that cometh against us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. And all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, their children. Then upon Jeziel, the son of Zachariah, the son of Baniah, the son of Jahil, the son of Matiniah, a Levite of the sons of Asf. Come the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation. And he said, "Hearken ye all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou, King Jehoshaphat, thus saith the Lord unto you, be not afraid, nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's." Tomorrow go ye down against them, and behold, they come by the cliff of Ziz, and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of Jeru. Ye shall not need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, oh Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not. Somebody say, "Fear not." Somebody say, "Nor be dismayed." &gt;&gt; Be dismayed. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord will be with you. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you for your blessings tonight. The presence that we feel that we know is here, Lord, as we've heard our little ones, Lord. our our our our little ones and then the all the way up, Father, the young men and women singing that song of that glorious name. Father, we count it an honor to be able to represent you here on the earth, knowing, Lord, that you have never forsaken your people. And I pray, Lord, that you would help us here tonight. Maybe there's someone that's in a battle, Lord, in their mind or in their body or in their family or their job. But oh God, you know exactly where we are all at. And Father, you've got the remedy for every one of us here tonight. And we look to you and we thank you right now, Lord, for hearing. And we thank you right now ahead of time for the blessings that you're going to that you're going to give and the miracles that you are working even as we pray. Father, we thank you for it now. We give ourselves to you tonight and we ask that you would speak to us now in Jesus name. Can the church say amen &gt;&gt; and amen. God bless you. You can be seated here this evening. Amen. We are we are very thankful to God for his many blessings. And as we have just read, I'd like to just go ahead and continue. Amen. We've we just finished reading the 17th verse. Ye shall not need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves. Stand ye still. See the salvation of the Lord with you, oh Jerusalem. Amen. Um, and fear not, nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord will be with you. Now, I I this did not just stop here, but then Jehoshaphat bowed his head to the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. With his face to the ground and all of the Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and fell before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. Now, has it not taken place yet? The battle has still got to be fought. &gt;&gt; They're still in an They're still in a in a great great &gt;&gt; This is bad. This is really bad. &gt;&gt; But God is coming on the scene. God's given him his promise. They don't even have to see. Amen. The promise come to pass. They believe what God said &gt;&gt; and they're going to stand upon that word. &gt;&gt; Going to stand upon that promise. And they begin to worship the Lord. 19th verse. And the Levites of the children of the Kathites and the children of Korites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high. I would like to minister here this evening. Amen. There's no need to fight in this battle. That's going to be my title here this evening. There's no need to fight in this battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. because God's going to fight that battle for us. As we have just read, Jehoshaphat, Amen, was was greatly concerned. Amen. Because the children of Moab and Hammon and Mount Seir, these had come up against Jehoshaphat and and and Judah. And in the natural, Jehoshaphat didn't know what to do. It it was it was a pretty bleak situation. But Jehoshaphat knew one thing. Jehoshaphat was a godly man. He He was a godly leader. Amen. And he knew one thing that Judah was living under the promises of God. &gt;&gt; That God is the one that called them. That God is the one who sent the prophet in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. That led them out of the children or out of out of Egypt. Amen. and uh and even before that called Abraham &gt;&gt; and his and his sons and Amen and and so Amen. He knew that he was the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; He knew who he was. Amen. And the Bible had or God had already told him, "Thy seed shall possess the gates of thine enemies." &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so there he was standing in Solomon's temple. Amen. And and and and he's and he's reminding the Lord. He is saying, "Amen. You said in the dedication OF THIS TEMPLE OR SOLOMON HAD PRAYED." AMEN. uh with IN THE DEDICATION, if this people, if there is ever one of the seeds of uh the any of the members, the children of the seed of Abraham should ever get in trouble, if they would LOOK TO THIS TEMPLE, that you would hear their prayer and that you would answer. Now, here they are many generations down, but they still CAN TAKE GOD BACK TO his word. Amen. Knowing that God will keep his word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when WE ARE IN TROUBLE, I think this is something that we can Amen. that that that we can all look to and say, come back to God and say, you've given us an absolute. You've given us your word. &gt;&gt; God's never promised that everything was going to go rosy. He's never promised that everything was going to go good. Amen. Somebody asked one time, "Well, if you know if if if you're serving the Lord, then Amen. You guys have sickness and you guys have family problems and you guys have these, so do the rest of us." Amen. But I just want to tell you, Amen. We are the royal seed of Abraham in covenant WITH GOD. AND THAT PROMISE is what we've got. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT THAT EVERYTHING GOES GOOD. NOT THAT EVERYTHING IS AMEN. ALWAYS PEACHY. WE'VE GOT A COVENANT WITH GOD. I think that is something that every one of us uh uh parents Amen. It should be something that stabilizes our hearts for OUR FAMILY. GOD, YOU GAVE US A promise and I'm clinging to that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God loves to test his people. Amen. He He wants Amen. He sends THE TRIALS. HE ALLOWS THE TRIALS OUR WAY. AMEN. HE HE HE VOLUNTEERS you for trials. Amen. God God done it there with with uh Job and he says, "Have you considered my SERVANT JOB?" AMEN. GOD DOES THAT. GOD BRINGS these things on. BUT YOU SEE, GOD IS WANTING A reaction from HIS PEOPLE. GOD ALLOWS THESE things to come our way, but he's looking for a positive reaction from every ONE OF HIS CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you say that you're the royal seed of Abraham, then he expects you to act like one. Amen. If you ARE IN COVENANT WITH GOD, AMEN. AND YOU BELIEVE GOD IS IS IS STRONG AND IS ABLE, THEN HE EXPECTS YOU TO STAND THERE IN FAITH AND believe him for the promises. Can you say amen? Now, he's going to SEND YOU THROUGH THE ALLOW YOU TO GO THROUGH THE FIERY FURNACE. HE'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO GO THROUGH THE LION'S DEN. HE'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO AMEN TO EXPERIENCE these things. But remember, your covenant is not based on ON ON A FLOWERY BED OF EASE. It is based upon God's character. God cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He cannot fail. Amen. So as we as we just go along some of these verses that we have just read. Amen. In that in that third verse, there was one thing that Jehoshaphat did. Amen. Number one is he set himself to seek the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Number two, he proclaimed a fast. So So he he he knew who he was. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHO GOD was and HE WAS GOING TO PETITION THE ONE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD HELP HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, now if he would have went to other nations or if he would have tried his own ability then then then the results would not have been the same. BUT WHEN HE COME TO GOD AND SAID YOU gave the covenant &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? You you we it was God that come and made covenant with you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought the odds here God is is is all knowing. God is all powerful, but when it comes to you, Amen. Here you are, &gt;&gt; you're you're you're pretty much Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're pretty much worthless &gt;&gt; in that covenant. Amen. Unless you believe. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD'S CHOSE YOU TO WORK his word, his ways, perform his miracle through. And the only way he's going to be able to do that is when you trust him, believe him. &gt;&gt; Look to him to fulfill his word through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't. Amen. The last message I preached here was we we talked about uh uh you know uh uh Sarah. Sarah Sarah COULDN'T PRODUCE AT ALL. SHE never could have children. She never could. Amen. But God chose Sarah because God was going to receive THE HONOR. AND GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU. SO QUIT LOOKING AT YOUR INABILITIES. QUIT LOOKING AT YOUR WORTHLESSNESS. QUIT LOOKING AT YOUR FAILURES. WE ARE IN COVENANT WITH GOD. I DIDN'T MAKE THE COVENANT. HE MADE THE COVENANT. YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE COVENANT. YOU ACCEPTED THE COVENANT. AND GOD IS GOING TO FULFILL HIS WORD IN YOU. OH, IF WE COULD STAND THERE IN THE TRIAL AND BE LIKE JEHOSHAPHAT AND SAY, "GOD, I'M LOOKING TO YOU. I'M LOOKING TO YOUR PROMISE. I REFUSE TO LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE BUT your word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Judah gathered themselves together. Amen. Bible says they come from all of the cities and they come to church. Hallelujah. They all come to church and uh Amen. to ask the Lord to help. Amen. And and and so uh uh you know I I you know and and again I before I get off of this remember God uses trouble to declare his glory. &gt;&gt; How many's got some situations in your life that you really need God? Hallelujah. Well, it's not the time to despair. IT'S NOT THE time to get discouraged. IT'S THE TIME TO SET YOUR FACE TOWARD THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan tries to defeat God's purpose and he and and and uh Amen. But but WHEN HE'S TRYING TO WORKS so hard to defeat God's purpose in your life, but in all reality, he is actually bringing God's purpose. Amen. Uh to fruion in your LIFE BECAUSE AND AND I WONDERED WHY I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. WHY DOES GOD ALLOW THE troubles is BECAUSE IT IT REQUIRES DESPERATION. IT REQUIRES WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR MONEY AND YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING GOING FOR YOU AND AND AND and you've got, you know, uh everything just, YOU KNOW, JUST HANDED TO you uh on a silver platter. you you you uh YOU YOU'RE NOT DESPERATE. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S WHEN YOU GET DESPERATE BEFORE GOD, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. When you're missing a paycheck or when Amen. you ain't got the money to to to to make the ends meet or when mama's fixing to Amen. mama's been diagnosed with cancer OR DADDY'S GOT THIS THAT and the other. You got a CHILD THAT IS WAVERED. WHAT DOES IT DO? IT BRINGS A DESPERATION AND THE VERY THING THAT SATAN WOULD USE AGAINST YOU TO get you to turn around. Hallelujah. He forgets that you're the royal seed of Abraham. He forgets, AMEN. THAT YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD DON'T HAVE. HE FORGETS THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD HE PUSHES YOU, ALL IT DOES IS MAKES YOU MORE DESPERATE, MAKES YOU WITH GREATER INTENSITY, GIVES YOU GREATER DESIRE TO SERVE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jeremiah, one of my favorite scriptures, if you wouldn't mind putting that up there. I believe it's in Jeremiah 31:9, Sister Keys. Amen. And it and it says, "And they shall come with weeping and with supplications will I lead them." &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL COME WITH WEEPING. SEE, SEE, SOMETIMES, THEN IF YOU DON'T MIND LEAVING THAT UP THERE, SOMETIMES YOU'RE ANOINTED WHEN YOU'RE WEEPING. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU'RE ANOINTED WHEN YOUR SPIRIT IS IN TURMOIL. SOMETIMES YOU'RE MORE ANOINTED THEN THAN WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING THE AISLES. AND YOU'RE JUMPING AND SHOUTING AND YOU'RE PRAISING THE LORD. AMEN. BE IT'S GOOD. HALLELUJAH. TO BE ALL HAPPY WHEN SOMEONE GIVES YOU A $100 BILL AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK FOR IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But it's when you're needing that $100 bill. Amen. For uh you're needing something, you know, you're you're fixing to be h put out of your house or CAR IS FIXING TO BE TAKEN AWAY. SOMETIMES IT'S in the weeping and THE SUPPLICATION THAT GOD IS LEADING YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's incredible. That's incredible because it's when you're crying and you're in desperation and you are it brings the real character of your heart out because then Amen. There's only one thing that matters to you as a Christian. It gets down to the very root of things. I need you more than I need anything else. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With supplications will I lead them. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of water in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble. Ah, for I am a father to Israel and Ephraim is my firstborn. Can you say amen? AMEN. WHAT DOES supplication mean? Amen. Supplication is an earnest, sincere appeal. It's an urgent request. Amen. FROM TO TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE POWER TO GRANT THAT REQUEST. SO SUPPLICATION IS IS NOT JUST SAYING A PRAYER, A LAY ME DOWN TO SLEEP PRAYER, BUT SUPPLICATION IS AN EARNESTNESS THAT IS SAYING, LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT WHAT I NEED. AMEN. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO UNTIL I GET WHAT I NEED from you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I I'm going to walk IN THIS WAY. I'M A DESIRE. AMEN. IT'S BRINGING OUT THE REAL TRUE AMBITION. WELL, PRAISE the Lord. Amen. It brings out WHO YOU REALLY ARE. THE TRIAL BRINGS IT OUT. MANY TIMES IN the trial, yes, there's a lot of frustration and and there's a LOT OF CONFUSION AND THERE CAN BE A LOT OF OF THIS THAT OR THE OTHER. BUT FOR a believer, amen, YOU KEEP ON DIGGING DOWN. You keep on getting a little BIT AMEN. THE FURTHER THAT YOU FIND THAT rock and that rock is predestination, brother. That rock IS SOMETHING THAT GOD PLACED in your heart. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T DISBELIEVE IF YOU WANTED TO. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE A SON OF GOD. YOU'VE BEEN BORN OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophet would say, "When you get desperate about this thing, something will take place." &gt;&gt; When you get desperate about this thing, something will take place. He said, "But you're not desperate enough. Oh, well, I'll join the church, and that settles it." But you have to be desperate about it if you have to really need God. Jesus said, "Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." But as long as you're satisfied with the things of the world, how can God ever speak to you? You say, "God never spoke to me." Why? He wants to, but you're too filled up with the things of the world. And that's what's the matter with us today. We we put all our time on things of the world and pleasures of the world and give no time for God. That's true. Amen. NOW WE FIND OUT THAT ISAIAH GOT DESPERATE. HE SCREAMED OUT AND CONFESSED HIS SINS AND confessed the sins of the of the people. And when he got through confessing, he heard a noise from above him. And when he looked up, there was the cherubam flying back and forth through the building, wings over their faces, wings over their feet, flying with wings, and they were crying, "Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty." See Isaiah got desperate and God come on the job. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN ISAIAH OR JOSIAH JOAT, AMEN, BEGAN TO PRAY. NOW I WANT US TO LOOK AT THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD you along here tonight. &gt;&gt; Now I want us to look here. If you WANT TO GET THE attention of God, Amen. FIRST OF ALL, HE SET HIS FACE toward God IN DESPERATION. AND HE CALLED FOR A FAST. THE PEOPLE ALL GOT, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR I I I I good good oldfashioned prayer meetings. &gt;&gt; You know, I remember prayer meetings. We used to have have prayer meetings. We've had many needs in this church and we got together in desperation. And how many how many can say that you are witness to what God has done during those times? Why? It's because there's something of calling that body together. Can you say amen? But then when he begins to say his prayer, HE DOESN'T START OUT SAYING, "AMEN, LORD, here I am. Uh uh, I need you. Where are you at?" No. Amen. What does he do? The very first thing he does is begin to exalt the name of God. &gt;&gt; He begins to say, "Thou art the God. Thou art the one who has called. &gt;&gt; You are the one who done it for our Amen. for for Abraham. You're the one that brought him out of Egypt. YOU'RE THE ONE I AM CALLING TO YOU BECAUSE you are the one that is worthy. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I think every prayer that we pray should start out just like that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. If you if you YOU YOU DON'T I I YOU KNOW I I I IF IF if if all of my children or grandchildren, if all they ever done is just come in and and and just wanting to uh you know, just wanting something from me all the time, I'd begin to wonder if they love me. Hallelujah. AMEN. BUT BUT BUT I WANT THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHO I AM. REC. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, IF THERE'S ANYBODY THAT DESERVES TO BE HIGH AND LIFTED UP, &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T WENDLE MARTIN. IT AIN'T YOUR DADDY. IT AIN'T YOUR MAMA. IF THERE'S ANYONE THAT DESERVES TO BE HIGH AND LIFTED UP, &gt;&gt; IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO CAN HELP YOU, DADDY WINDOW CANNOT. IT CAN ONLY GO SO FAR. WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. DADDY JOHN CAN ONLY GO SO FAR. DADDY MERL CAN ONLY GO SO FAR. BUT THERE IS A GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHO IS IN COVENANT WITH ME. THERE'S A GOD WHO IS IN COVENANT WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; Give him honor. GIVE HIM GLORY. SET HIM HIGH. JESUS SAID, AMEN. WHEN THEY SAID, "TEACH US TO PRAY." WHAT WAS HIS VERY FIRST WORDS? OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME. SET APART BE THY NAME. LIFTED HIGH IS YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; That's good preaching. &gt;&gt; Then you go on down, give us the bread and give us our needs. And can you say amen? It's a heart of humility saying that I cannot do this in myself. &gt;&gt; It's a heart of humility saying I'm going to surrender what I think is right and I'm going to follow you in your word. You called me. YOU GIVE ME YOUR PLAN and I am the one that's going to believe it and follow you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You want to get the attention of God? Amen. Set your face toward him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get desperate. Lift him up high. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the seventh verse, just going through these things, you can go back home and read in your devotion, but the seventh verse has stood out to me. Amen. He began to remind God of his promises. HE TAKES GOD BEFORE HE ASKS a thing. He starts going back and saying, "Now Lord, you gave that promise." Lord, you gave and and he began to tell him, "AMEN. OF ALL OF HIS WORKS." Begin to tell REMIND HIM OF WHAT I think sometime I believe God just loves it when we start reminding him of what he's told us. &gt;&gt; God, you said you'd never leave me. God said, "Huh, I love hearing that from you." Well, can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD, YOU SAID YOU'D MEET ALL my needs according to your riches in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. I tell you what. Amen. My I my wife can get my attention a lot more by saying that kind of stuff and complimenting me. Amen. ABOUT WHAT WHAT MY PROBLEM THAN SHE WOULD BE BY TEARING me down and telling me how bad I am. &gt;&gt; All right. TELLING ME WHERE YOU AT. WHY AIN'T YOU GOT THIS DONE? I MEAN, HELLO. AMEN. LORD, here we are. These are THREE KINGS ARE MORE THAN US AND THEY'RE FIXING TO KILL US. WHAT'S GOING ON? NO, HE SAYS, GOD, YOU gave the promise. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I think there is something about praying God's word. I I I you know I I I've been in my situations and I'll gather up all of the promises that God's given and I'll just start praying. Hallelujah. I'll start praying. What am I doing? I am confessing what God has already said. And the Bible says that he is the high priest of my confession. &gt;&gt; He wants to hear you tell him his word. Amen. It feels like the heater's on. I don't know if it's on or not, but we can turn that heater off. Hallelujah. Amen. But the um the So, WE WE WE'VE GOT WE'VE got a promise. WE'VE WE'VE GOT A WE WE'VE BEEN GIVEN PROMISES, BUT WE'VE GOT TO COME at one with that promise &gt;&gt; and claim that promise and say, "God, I'm coming in union with you. I'm believing what you said. Be it unto me according to your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, there's something about there's something about a covenant man. There's something about a covenant woman. They're praying is not a prayer of woe is me. IT'S NOT A PRAYER OF PLEASE HELP. It's not. It is, but it's not. Amen. A covenant people, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. SOMEBODY REPEAT. I KNOW WHO I AM. ONE MORE TIME. I KNOW WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU START ACTING LIKE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU START ACTING LIKE DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THE WOE IS ME ATTITUDE IS GONE. YOU ARE IN COVENANT WITH THE ONE WHO CAN MAKE anything happen. &gt;&gt; You need healing in your body, start acting like &gt;&gt; you're a son of God. &gt;&gt; And before you know it, you'll be going around like Abraham confessing and up and walking around. &gt;&gt; Amen. an old man up and walking around claiming that you're a father of many nations. Hallelujah. And there you are on your cane just barely. Amen. Keeping your false teeth in as you're walking. But hey, footsteps his possession. &gt;&gt; Footsteps his possession. What is it? God gave the promise. He was in covenant with God. And there was nothing going to keep him from that. &gt;&gt; HE BELIEVED GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD. HE DIDN'T SIT AROUND WAITING FOR THE PROMISE TO HAPPEN BEFORE HE STARTED POSSESSING. HE WAS POSSESSING BECAUSE GOD MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU START POSSESSING HERE TONIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE THE PROMISE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE THE FULFILLMENT. YOU BELIEVE THAT PROMISE AND START CLAIMING GOD'S BLESSING. START CLAIMING GOD'S WORD. STAND UPON THUS SAYETH THE LORD. YOU'RE IN COVENANT WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; You stand upon that word. &gt;&gt; You start acting like it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, glory to God. Amen. Before you know it, that old hand may be paralyzed, but you're working it every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're work. You're doing your best. You're going to make that finger move. Is that not what the prophet said? Amen. And then finally you get a little you get a little twitch and no one else sees it but you can feel it and you're said there it is. There it is. And before you know it you got a finger move. Before you know it you got two fingers moving. Before you know well praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I SAID WE'RE A COVENANT PEOPLE. THE COVENANT IS WITH HIS PEOPLE. SOMEONE SAY I'M A COVENANT PERSON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So covenant people, you look at things differently. &gt;&gt; Your prayer is different. &gt;&gt; Your study time is different. &gt;&gt; Your message that you listen to is different. &gt;&gt; And your confession &gt;&gt; that you listen to is different. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you have tied yourself to that promise. You have made it yours. Not the preacher making it his. You yourself. Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke Lancaster making the promise yours. &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's me. I'm the COVENANT PERSON. I'M THE ONE THAT GOD TOUCHED. I'M THE ONE THAT HAS RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST. I'M THE ONE THAT GOD HAS COME TO. IF THE REST OF THE WORLD, AMEN, WERE TO GO TO HELL AND THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE BUT ONE PERSON TO MAKE THE RAPTURE, I WOULD BE THE ONE. &gt;&gt; SORRY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; SORRY. That's just the way I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of attitude God wants. &gt;&gt; When when the boys were younger, y'all probably remember this. Um, Brother Forest Farmer, we were out at McDonald's and anyone knows Brother Forest Farmer? He's just a man of faith, you know, and and we love Brother Forest. You just I I just love tagging along because usually there's good things that happen when you're around Brother Forest. Hallelujah. And uh well, he hollers. We was at McDonald's out there at the old McDonald's and he hollered out and says, "Hey, hey, Brother Wendle." So I said, "Hey, brother Forest." He said, "I'm sorry, but God loves me more than he loves you." Everyone's going looking around thinking, and I said, "That's impossible. I'm his favorite son." He looked around there and he said, "Well, how could you be the favorite when God loves me more?" Amen. Now, now, now that that's that was just some going back and forth being cute. But you see, that's the kind of attitude we should all have, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If God's going to hear anyone's prayer, he's going to hear mine. &gt;&gt; What What kind OF AN ATTITUDE SHOULD YOU HAVE? &gt;&gt; IF GOD'S GOING TO HEAR ANYONE'S PRAYERS, SIMEON SHOULD SAY, "IT'LL BE MINE." &gt;&gt; And then his buddy sat beside him saying, "No, I'm his favorite." THERE SHOULD BE THIS COVENANT YOU'VE GOT WITH GOD. AND I'M SO GLAD THAT GOD'S SO BIG THAT WE CAN ALL BE HIS FAVORITE. I'M SO GLAD THAT GOD GAVE US ALL THE COVENANT. AND HE'S JUST WANTING SOMEBODY TO START acting like it, believing him in that promise. Can you say amen? AMEN. GOD GAVE THAT PROMISE. BRING HIS WORD BACK to him. EVERYONE HEAR ME. GOD GAVE YOU THE PROMISE. HE WANTS YOU TO BRING HIS WORD BACK TO HIM. &gt;&gt; That's what Jehoshaphat done. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're not praying fears. We're not praying unbelief. We're not praying anything else. We've got an absolute amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Solomon is there. He's declaring. Then the 10th and 11th verse, he begins to start declaring, "Hey, Amen. and Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir and they they here they are. They're coming and ma'am, they're wanting to kill us. And Amen. It begins to tell him, "You the one that gave us the promise. You gave us the land. Amen. You're the one. We're the seed of Abraham. And you said it would be to the seed of Abraham." Amen. Thy friend forever. Here we are standing. And you've said when evil comes upon us as swore and night verse judgment and pestilence and famine and we stand before thy house in the in thy presence for thy name is in this house and we cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help. Now he's he's bringing it to I mean he's just HE'S JUST LAYING IT OUT there now. Here we are. Amen. He confesses. Amen. The 12th verse. Oh our God, wilt thou not judge them. We have no might against this great company that cometh against us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. And all Judas stood before the Lord with their little ones and their wives and their children. Oh, can you say amen? And what were they doing? They were bringing their petition before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's in it's in faith. You know, just thinking of there in there in uh uh James 5 and I don't know somewhere on the 14th, 15th, 16th verse there. Amen. Where where where is you know he says if if there's any sick among you call for the elders of the church if he sin then let him pray. But then he but then he says he says somewhere in there the uh uh fervent prayer of a righteous man &gt;&gt; avails much. &gt;&gt; The fervent prayer of a righteous man. But then he goes on down and he says and the prayer of faith shall save the sick. It's not how pathetic we can be. It's not how bad we can present our situation. &gt;&gt; It's in the way that we say, "I got a need and I know beyond any doubt that you've got my healing." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prayer of faith shall &gt;&gt; save the sick. &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you want to shout. &gt;&gt; FOR THE EFFECTUAL, FERVENT PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN, a believing man. How do you become righteous? Abraham believed God AND IT WAS IMPUTED UNTO HIM FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. SO A FAITHFUL THE FERVENT PRAYER THE EFFECTUAL FERVENT PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN ONE WHO BELIEVES God shall avail very much. &gt;&gt; Well glory TO GOD. &gt;&gt; I SAID GLORY to God. &gt;&gt; I'M IN A TRIAL. THEN IT'S TIME TO GO TO prayer and pray like a RIGHTEOUS MAN. PRAY LIKE A BELIEVING MAN. PRAY LIKE A BELIEVING WOMAN. AND I DON'T YOU LEAVE UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT WHAT you what you have been asking for. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6 and 18, sister Keys. Amen. Is another prayer scripture. AMEN. PRAYING ALWAYS WITH ALL PRAYER. And there's that word supplication again. Amen. And what is that supplication? that earnest request and petition to the one that you know has your answer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints. Can you say amen? James 1:6, LET HIM ASK IN FAITH, nothing wavering. For he that waverth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and is tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all of his way. So if we're going to be asking, he didn't say let him ask. I hope I hope this ain't too simple and hype. AMEN. LET HIM ASK in faith. &gt;&gt; THE EFFECTUAL FERVENT PRAYER OF A BELIEVING MAN AVALETH MUCH. LET HIM ask in faith, never wavering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AH, YOU'RE IN COVENANT WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; COME ON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You can doubt yourself, but don't doubt God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, we're so thankful for that. Now I think here of Judah and um I thought it was interesting that here in this especially in this in this story that it was Judah that was that was having trouble and it was Judah if you were to if you were to look in the scripture and um and and there in the 19th verse. They they stood up to praise the Lord. This is 2 Chronicles 20 and 19. Such keys, if you just go with me as we skip down through some of this stuff. Amen. Um the Levites and the children of Corites. The these are the these are the ministers. Amen. The priest of the And and it and it says they stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high. And um uh and and and then we find the 20th verse that Jehoshaphat is saying, "Believe in the Lord your God and you shall be established and believe as prophets and you shall prosper." And then the 21st verse, if you'd want to put that up, Sister Keys. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, that they should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army, and to say, "Praise the Lord, for his mercy endures forever." Yes. &gt;&gt; And when they begin to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, and which were come against Judah, and they were smitten. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They were smitten. Judah means praise. Did y'all know that? Judah means praise. as I was that was I was contemplating my thoughts here today and and going over in my mind Judah it when when God had first come to Judah and and give him his give him his promise it was it was uh uh Jacob that that there in in in Genesis 49 and 8 and and said Judah thou art he whom thy brothers brethren shall praise Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies. Thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's wel from the prey. My son, thou art gone. He stooped down. He's couched as a lion, as an old lion. Who shall arise him? Arouse him. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come. Unto him shall the gathering of the people be. And and there even in in the book of Judges when they were going in to fight against the Canaanites there in Judges 1 and one. Now after the death of Joshua, it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, "Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?" And the Lord said, "Judah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand." Now that word Judah, Judah means praise. It means to give thanks to Law and praise to sing praises of. Judah also means to confess, to say the same thing as God says, to confess the name of God. Judah means to cast down, to shoot arrows, to throw down. Judah, it it's incredible that Judah were the people of praise. &gt;&gt; They were the people of praise. And it's incredible how that praise, confession, and casting down all falls under the same meaning of the word Judah. It's incredible that the mighty angel who has come down is from the line of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Come on. The lamb, sacrificial lamb is also the lamb. The one who died on Calvary has come back in our generation as the mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; To conquer death. The lion of the tribe of Judah. That is none other than the mighty angel coming down with an open book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise. Confession and casting down. Somebody say &gt;&gt; praise. &gt;&gt; Confession &gt;&gt; and casting down. Look it up in your Strong's concordance. Praise confession &gt;&gt; and casting down. Oh, praise the Lord. When everything is going wrong. Amen. And as brother Kobe sings that song, when everything is gone wrong &gt;&gt; and my back's against the wall, Satan's throwing it on strong and whatever. But then what else do what is this? What the main part of this song I want you to get? I just throw up my hands &gt;&gt; and start praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I can't give up because I stand &gt;&gt; word his covenant. When &gt;&gt; he comes down and inhabits my praise, I got a dynamite plan. Satan just can't stand &gt;&gt; when I throw up my hand. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. Are you GOING TO MILK THAT TRIAL YOU'VE GOT? ARE YOU GOING TO SIT THERE AND JUST ARE THAT LITTLE HURDLE THAT GOD'S GIVEN YOU? Are you going are are you going to make thistles and briars and thorns to grow on that hill by all of your tears? Are you going to get up get your bulldozing faith out and just bulldoze the hill? Or better than that, why don't you just jump over the hill? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. See, you can God's not given us this sit in any situation in our lives for us to be in the migrs or to bow to it. Don't let the enemy ever see fear in your eyes. Don't let him hear negative in your in your mouth. Don't give your thoughts over to him because the prophets done came in this generation to tell US THE GREATEST BATTLE ever going to be FOUGHT IS RIGHT THERE IN YOUR MIND AND WHATEVER DECISION YOU MAKE IN YOUR MIND IS GOING TO AFFECT YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROPHET said a the RIGHT CONFESSION WILL BRING YOUR BODY UNDER its control. Amen. &gt;&gt; I got a dynamite plan Satan just can't stand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, here is where now I I love this. I got another scripture that I that I that I've thrown in here somewhere. Let me find it. Hallelujah. Amen. Fixing to close now. They're they're in Zechariah. Now, God's using Judah again. Amen. God's using Judah again. And this is Zechariah 10:1. And and and and Zechariah has a lot of good things about us. But mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats. For the Lord of hosts had visited his flock, the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in battle. &gt;&gt; Now, what's a goodly horse in battle? That's a strong horse. Right. &gt;&gt; God's saying God's saying I have chosen Judah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My anointing is going to ride. &gt;&gt; I have called Judah and I'm going to use Judah as my goodly horse. Hallelujah. Amen. Goodly horse. He's going to ride you. He's going to ride. Now here we are in in the time of battle AND IT SAYS OUT OF JUDAH CAME FORTH THE CORNER. This is this is Zechariah 10:2. Out of Judah CAME FORTH THE CORNER. OUT OF Judah come the nail. Out of him the battlebowl. Out of Judah every oppressor together. They shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle. THEY SHALL FIGHT FOR the because the Lord is with THEM AND THE RIDERS ON HOUSES ON horses shall be confounded. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, what am I trying to say? Judah's not listening to his own reasoning. Although there is they are they are in battle. They are distressed. They are in desperation. &gt;&gt; But they're not looking to their weapons. They're not looking to their ability. They're coming with the weapon that God predestinated them. Their their name was praise. We come from that great royal seed of Judah. OUR HIGH PRIEST COMES from the royal seed of Judah. Now they were all say you WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT JUDAH? It Aaron didn't come from Judah. But when God come, he bypassed their ironic priesthood and he says we're going to come after that of Melzdc. We're going to come we're Hallelujah. AMEN. WHEN GOD WANTED TO SHOW WHO HE WAS, HE SAID, "The line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed." Somebody say, "The line OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH HAS PREVAILED." &gt;&gt; The seed OF JUDAH HAS PREVAILED. SOMEBODY SAY, "I'M GOING TO PRAISE. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO CONFESS. I'M GOING TO CAST MY DEVIL DOWN IN THE NAME OF JESUS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, the Bible says that they rose up early in the morning. They appointed the singers and they went out to say, "Praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever." Amen. 2 Chronicles 20 and 22. And they begin to sing and to praise and the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mass. And the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir and utter began to slay and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy another. And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. And when Jehoshaphat and his people come to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off them for themselves more than they could carry away. They were three days in gathering of the spoil and it was so much. Well, someone shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Baraka. For there they blessed the Lord. Therefore the name of the place was called the valley of Baraka unto this day. Then they returned every man of Judah and Jerusalem and Jehoshaphat in the forefront with them to go again to Jerusalem with joy. For the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies. SOMEONE SHOUT YES. SOMEONE SHOUT YES. &gt;&gt; OH, WE CAN DO BETTER THAN I KNOW. I KNOW IT'S A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, BUT SOMEBODY SHOUT YES. &gt;&gt; AND THEY COME TO JERUSALEM WITH SULTURIES AND HARPS AND TRUMPETS unto the house of the Lord. And the fear of GOD WAS ON ALL THE KINGDOMS of those countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against their enemies of Israel. Hallelujah. I just want to say thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I'm so glad that it wasn't the line of the tribe of Gad or the line of the tribe of But it was the line of the tribe of praise. the line of the tribe. And it's it's so incredible that all three of those virtues that come underneath that name, a name represents something. It means something. It means something. Amen. Hallelujah. But when God when he chose to be the lion of the tribe of Judah, the tribe of praise. Hallelujah. And it was gi Judah that went into the battle and destroyed. It was Judah means confession to say the same thing. And he says, "Listen, I am I am the lion of the tribe. I've got a tribe. And whatsoever things you confess, I will confess. I'm the high priest of your confession." And then the prophet would come in and say, 'N now it's important that you say the right words. It's important. It's important for Hattie Wright to say that ain't nothing but the truth. It's important today for you and I to come in covenant, come in come in relation at one with God's promise. &gt;&gt; I say God can't lie. I say God can't lie. &gt;&gt; I I I say the things that I have prayed over and confessed over and just kept before God. Amen. God has said I listen when it looked impossible for for certain things and I just kept on praying and calling out to God and calling out to God and calling even in the time when I just felt like all hope was gone. Then God comes right on in right at the nick of time. Amen. And makes it to pass and then answers my prayer and I say, "Oh, God, how did this happen? I don't know how it happened. God done it. It was supernatural. God wants it supernatural. If you can do it yourself, dummy." Amen. Then you don't need God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But God's got it to where he want where he where you're going to have to rely on him. Well, praise the Lord. Well, I believe I'll praise the Lord while I have a chance. I believe I'll praise the Lord while I have a chance. &gt;&gt; Praise him all night long. I believe I'll praise the Lord while I have a chance. Welcome. Praise praising him. Well, I feel like praising praising him. I'm going to praise him in the morning. I'm going to praise him all night long. Well, pre like praise. Oh yeah. Now, why don't you praise the Lord while you got in jail? Hey, why don't you praise the Lord while you've got a chance? Praise him in the morning. Praise him all day long. Why don't you praise the Lord while you got a chance? Well, I feel like loving. Oh, I feel like loving. I'm going to love him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to love him. &gt;&gt; Well, I feel Oh, why don't you praise the Lord? THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PRAISE HIM. Why don't you praise the Lord? Praise him in the morning. Praise him all night long. Praise the Lord while you got a chance. Yeah. Glory, glory, glory, glory. Faith does not have to see the answer because faith has already got the answer. He's in covenant with God. &gt;&gt; He's in covenant with God. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm stepping out. I'm stepping out. I You know, Hallelujah. I told the Lord done the Lord done touched my tailbone the other day and I said, you know what? Hallelujah. Amen. You know, my back is just a few inches up higher. Amen. We'll just take that, too. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God can do that. Well, glory to God. You see what? I just don't know. And that's why you don't. That's why you don't have your promise. It's just a wine. Well, well, well, well, well, whoa. Well, get rid of your wells. Amen. And come to the well, Jesus Christ, who has everything you have needed. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? How many's GOING TO WALK OUT OF THIS PLACE ACTING LIKE YOU'RE HEALED? ACTING LIKE YOU'RE DELIVERED.
