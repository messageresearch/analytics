And Lord, we love you in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. [Music] Something about that wonderful name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hell still trembles at that name. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. There's been a lot of reinvention of Christianity, &gt;&gt; but the original is still the best. &gt;&gt; The founder is still omnipotent, the Lord Jesus Christ. He don't have to be improved upon. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He don't have to be. He is all in all. He's our Lord. He's our Savior. And we love him this morning. Bless the name of Jesus. Bless the name of Jesus. Well, good morning. It's good to to be here in the house of the Lord. Good to see you here today. And uh we just pray that that the Lord will bless you abundantly. It's good to see everyone here today and u our good to see our all of our friends from Henrietta here this morning and God bless y'all. Amen. Just just so good to to see everyone here and um we just know that God and I did you enjoy brother Caleb's song? I like that song and uh I've been singing that song for the last three or four days and uh and so I uh I I was really thinking this morning it'd be nice I think I think uh Caleb sung on Wednesday night too but I was thinking man it'd be nice if if uh if he had sing that song again this morning and brother Merl had him sing it. Praise the Lord. So that's that's just wonderful. Amen. Nothing greater than you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's let's look here in in H Psalms 1 and one. And um it sure is good to have um our friend there with with brother Joe. And um we just uh hope that he feels right at home and and that the Lord blesses him this morning. and um uh brother Nathaniel and Sister Katrina, they've they've had it rough here lately. It's good good to see them this morning. And um uh tell you what we uh you know when you when that sickness goes around, you just looking forward every day to that new body. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um and so let's look here in the book of Psalms 1 and1. Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season. His leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he does shall prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish. And I I want to uh take my thought out of that third verse this morning. He shall bring forth his fruit in his season. And the prophet would tell us that it was he, the believer, will bring forth God's fruit in the prophets's season. And we're still wanting to deal a little bit this morning on the anointing. Sort of continue from last week. And father, we just want to thank you today for your words of life. And we're just asking Lord that you would anoint both speaker and hearer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be seated here this morning. The anointing, it's not a feeling. It's not an emotion. But the anointing is the presence of God on the earth. Amen. declaring or doing doing his work in different seasons of of life. we went through last week and how that the first uh mention of anointing would be there when Jacob had had the dream of the angels ascending and descending and and um and and you know God confirming the covenant with him and he got up and took the stone that he was uh that he slept on and he he he erected up as a pillar and and he anointed it. He smeared oil upon it. He called the place Bethl, the house of God. And um we find that the anointing, Amen. Uh we find later on in the tabernacle that that God would uh would have Moses to take some spices and put it in the oil and it would be the anointing oil. And this oil would be used to uh uh sanctify or to set apart the tabernacle. It would set apart the altar. It would be set apart um for the for the service of the Lord and it would never be used for anything else. It was to be consecrated. It was oil that was that was poured on or smeared on. Amen. Rubbed onto and it would be the place that God would come. Amen. And he would meet with man. And we find that the anointing that the great pillar of fire would come down upon that tabernacle and would sanction what God Amen. what they had set apart. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And so God would use the prophet Moses. Amen. to anoint and would and would set it in order for the anointing or the presence of God, the Messiah of God, the logos of God to come down and dwell with God's people. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the tabernacle was set aside for sacred service. &gt;&gt; Amen. So then God would have that anointing oil with those spices and they would anoint the garments of of Aaron and his sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they would anoint even the right earlobe, the right thumb, the right toe of the priest that they could walk in to that anointed uh sacred tabernacle and God would come down, the great God, creator of all heaven and earth would come down to visit with his people &gt;&gt; because it was set aside. WE SO THEN WE FIND AS we as we went on last week and how that Amen. God would raise up a prophet to take a the the a horn of oil and he would he would go to uh the the house of Jesse and the house of Jesse. Amen. He would find a man there that he would anoint to be king. And and we understand that uh the ALL OF THE SONS of Jesse came out one by one and the PROPHET OF GOD SAMUEL would look and say surely this is the man. &gt;&gt; Surely oh he's strong. He's intelligent. He's good-looking. And God would say this is not the one that I have had in my mind. YOU SEE GOD'S GOT A particular plan for every one of us. God's got an anointing AND HE'S NOT GOING TO PUT HIS anointing upon just upon anyone. Amen. The And and as I said last week, Amen. He could have poured the anointing oil on all on all the sons of Jesse, but that would have not been the one that God anointed because it was not the predestinated uh uh seed of God for the throne. &gt;&gt; But when he looked around and he said, "Do you not have any more?" And he says, "Well, yeah, I've got a boy down in in the He's a shepherd. He just tends the sheep." Amen. And he's the youngest, and you know, he's just uh and he says, "Oh, DON'T DON'T LET FATHER SAY SO. Just bring him up here." And and when he come, the spirit of the Lord come upon the prophet and says, "This is the man that you are to anoint for he will be my king over Israel." Oh, aren't you glad that God's got a prophet that knows the voice of God? AND THE VOICE of God, Amen, told him to anoint a particular man for that was the one that God had for ordained. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD'S GOT A GOD'S GOT A PLAN. GOD'S GOT A PEOPLE TODAY, and God will never change his plan. &gt;&gt; God will produce. He will RAISE UP A PROPHET messenger in the season. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WILL ANOINT THAT MAN TO COME TO ANOINT his church &gt;&gt; for their particular season. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it took a it took another prophet that would rise up in in the day of of of Jesus. Amen. John the Baptist would say, "This is the lamb." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the IT WAS THE PROPHET THAT STOOD THERE. AMEN. At the uh there at Jordan River SAYING, "THIS IS GOD'S MESSIAH here on the earth. God has anointed him." &gt;&gt; Jesus would stand in the temple and he would take the book written there in Isaiah 61 and he and he found the place where it was said, "Amen. And the spirit of the Lord God is upon me. And he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. Amen. And to open the blind eyes and and to preach deliverance to the captives. And and HE WOULD GO THROUGH THESE things here. Amen. THEN HE WOULD CLOSE THE SCRIPTURE UP AND HE WOULD SAY, "This day is this scripture fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Now it was Amen. IT IS IT HAS GONE FROM AN OIL. IT HAS GONE FROM JUST anointing a a A A PILLAR, AMEN, TO ANOINTING uh some spices and oil on down AND ON DOWN UNTIL NOW IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THERE IS A PROPHET THAT IS GOING TO ANOINT THE MESSIAH WITH HIS WORDS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE IS GOING TO ANOINT. AND THIS IS ALL SCRIPTURAL BECAUSE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT HIS DOCTRINE SHALL FALL LIKE RAIN. ANOTHER PLACE THE ANOINTING SHALL COME as rain. Can you SAY AMEN? SO THE PROPHET'S WORDS were anointing THE MESSIAH FOR THAT DAY. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to the lamb of God. THERE HAD TO BE A FORERUNNER TO THAT WORD. There had to be God will always raise up a prophet TO POINT TO THE word for that hour. God has always done it. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD talk in this scripture. Amen. Using the scripture here in Psalms that we had read, he says, "Now he shall bring forth his fruit in his season." Watch each his personal pronoun there. It's his fruit, God's fruit in the season. THE PROPHET IS BRINGING IT. It'll it'll be in the prophet's season. God's fruit in God's time by the prophet's season. See, he shall bring forth his fruit in his season. He see if there isn't uh see if there isn't two hises there. Amen. Bring forth his God's fruit. See, in the season that the messenger is ordained to come, HE'LL BRING FORTH THOSE. NOW REMEMBER that the messenger that brings the fruit of God will BRING IT IN GOD'S SEASON in the season of the bringer. He will bring forth his fruit. It cannot wither. Why? He's got predestinated fruit in there. It can't be destroyed. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Because it's predestinated. Psalms 5 or or Ephesians uh 1 and5. Amen. It says sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. What happened? HE SAID, "GOD BY HIS fornowledge predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ." GOD BY HIS FORNOWLEDGE PREDESTINATED EVERYTHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN right down along the road. By his fornowledge, he foresaw it. And therefore, from the beginning, he could tell the end. Therefore, IT WAS PREDESTINATED FRUIT, the root of this tree. AND THIS TREE CANNOT wither because it was holding predestinated fruit. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; NOW, HE TALKS ABOUT AMEN THAT THE SCRIPTURE HAD TALKED OF THIS GREAT TREE THAT THE INSECTS WOULD come and and would start eating this tree down. And we understand that on the day of Pentecost, the church was born and the great miracles AND POWER, THE BLESSINGS OF GOD WERE UPON IT, the anointing was upon that church. &gt;&gt; Amen. FOR THE SAME SPIRIT THAT WAS IN JESUS CHRIST, THE APOSTLE Paul said, if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you, IT WILL ALSO ANOINT YOU. IT WILL quicken you. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT ANOINTING WILL DO. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? THE BIBLE SAYS THERE IN ACTS, IT SAYS HOW THAT GOD WENT ABOUT UH DOING JESUS WENT ABOUT DOING GOOD AND HEALING ALL THAT WERE oppressed of the devil. Amen. For he WAS ANOINTED OF THE HOLY GHOST. SO THE SAME ANOINTING THAT JESUS had is the same anointing upon the word bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you SAY AMEN? NOW, SATAN COMES IN AND HE TRIED TO HE TRIED TO TAKE THE LIFE OUT AND HE did tried to Amen. TAKE THE LIFE OUT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL TREE, this great tree of God, the great tree of life, if you will, of which you and I are a member of. A and we've SEEN IT GO DOWN THROUGH THE DARK AGES AND HOW THAT AMEN. IT JUST it it got to so WORMY AND IT GOT so so rotten until there was nothing LEFT OF THE TREE. ALL OF THE insects had eaten it up. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT the scripture said WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT THERE IN THE BOOK OF JOEL, THE BOOK OF JOEL HAD IT SAID, AMEN. THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE THE MESSENGERS of death and there was going to be the cankerworm and the palm worm and the locust. AMEN. AND THE CATERPILLAR THAT WERE GOING TO COME and eat AND GNAW AT GOD'S TREE UNTIL IN THE DARK AGES IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS JUST nothing left. It didn't look like anything like the day of Pentecost. It didn't look like there was anything. But you see, the roots were predestinated. &gt;&gt; AND THEN GOD SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE A RESTORATION AND THAT there were FOUR MESSENGERS OF DEATH AND there would also be messengers of life THAT WOULD BRING IT BACK. And that, Amen, it would bring restoration of of of God would raise a messenger up, amen, by the name of Luther and BEGIN TO PREACH JUSTIFICATION. WHAT WAS HAPPENING? ANOTHER branch was coming back. It began to grow. AMEN. AND THEN GOD WOULD RAISE A MESSENGER BY THE NAME OF JOHN WESLEY. AND HE WOULD preach sanctification. AND THE ANOINTING WAS UPON THE EARTH. AMEN. For sanctification. And then we find THAT IT CAME ON UP. AMEN. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT. BUT THE ANOINTING WOULD COME THROUGH A PROPHET FOR TOTAL restoration to that church. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, remember, and we we went through this last week. Amen. THE ANOINTING IS ALWAYS GOD'S GOD'S WORD. AGAIN, GOING BACK. AMEN. If if I'm not too repetitious, the the the uh anointing OR THE PILLAR OF FIRE OR THE LOGOS OF GOD. AMEN. The word, the living WORD OF GOD HAS GOT TO COME IN EACH AGE. &gt;&gt; EACH AGE THAT ANOINTING COMES SO THAT THE WORD CAN LIVE in human beings. Now again you you know in Luther's day the church still didn't look like it did on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. It still didn't look like it didn't look like that original tree. It didn't look like uh the the Jesus that WAS WALKING HERE ON THE EARTH. BUT IT'S GOD'S DESIRE AND IT'S GOD'S PROPHETIC WORD THAT THERE WOULD BE A RESTORATION &gt;&gt; THAT THERE WOULD BE A FINAL MANIFESTATION OF the sons of God. Can you say amen? Amen. Now, NOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROPHECY THAT THAT MOSES HAD given there in Deuteronomy 32:1. Give ear, oh ye heavens, and I will speak and hear, O earth, the words OF MY MOUTH. MY DOCTRINE SHALL DROP AS the rain. My speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass. AMEN. SO GOD'S GOD'S UH UH H GOD'S PROPHECY, GOD IS TELLING US THAT THE ANOINTING WOULD COME. THERE WOULD BE A SEASON OF great maturity. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. AND WHEN GOD IS GOING TO DO THIS, RESTORATION must come from through a prophet messenger. NOW, WE UNDERSTAND THAT. AMEN. IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT that is through that prophet. AMEN. THAT IS POURING THAT WATER. AMEN. WHEN GOD COMES TO EARTH, HE ALWAYS USES a prophet messenger. And I want you to remember that the anointing HAD TO FLOW. AMEN. UH THROUGH THOSE. We had the we had the lion anointing. We had the ox anointing. We had the man anointing. And then we have the eagle anointing. THIS IS GOD'S ANOINTING COMING through the messages in their distinct seasons. And I want you to understand that. Amen. IF YOU WANTED TO WALK WITH GOD, YOU HAD TO WALK ACCORDING TO THE ANOINTING THAT WAS UPON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, as as the prophet would say, AMEN. BUT IN THIS church age, the message is being poured into the church. Another place he says, "BUT WHAT THIS MAN WAS POURING THE WATER, the messenger to the church, pouring the message into the church." But what IS THAT WATER DOING? AMEN. He He's TALKING ABOUT THAT HOLY SPIRIT THAT IS COMING ON IN. AMEN. HE SAYS, "YOU DON'T COME TO CHURCH JUST TO HEAR A MESSAGE, just to see a messenger. YOU COME TO HEAR THE MESSAGE." AND THE MESSAGE IS THE HOLY GHOST TAKING the word and giving it to you. NOW, WHEN GOD'S ANOINTING IS HERE, AMEN, we we used to we we used to think that it was running the aisles. We used to think back in Pentecost that it was jumping up and down. We used to call Amen a lot of things the anointing. Amen. But you see the anointing IS THE LIFE UPON THE WORD to live in human beings. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; That's the anointing. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. I tell you what the anointing was is is when when Jesus is walking up and there was a funeral procession. Amen. And he said, "The spirit of THE LORD GOD," HE'S ALREADY declared it. "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me and he hath anointed ME." AND HE WALKS UP THERE ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF THE FATHER AND HE RAISES THE BOY UP. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS THE anointing in ITS SEASON ON A BODY. WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. Not even death could stand IN ITS WAY. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. WHEN YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND THE ANOINTING THAT IS UPON you as the bride OF JESUS CHRIST, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND, AMEN, THAT GOD IN YOU is is the majority. &gt;&gt; YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT GOD IN YOU, IF YOU COULD JUST UNDERSTAND THE ANOINTING THAT IS upon you as the believer here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Now, Amen. Now remember he would say now he says this is the SETTING OF THE GREAT BATTLE. THE PEOPLE THAT REJECTS GOD'S message rejected the Holy Spirit. The messenger of the seven churches. Amen. The one that rejected the message of his grace has nothing left but judgment. Amen. And so we don't WANT TO BE THAT kind of a uh we we don't WANT TO BE THAT KIND OF PEOPLE WHO REJECTS THE ANOINTING WHEN THE ANOINTING COMES. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM, in 1962, Amen. Uh and I I want you to just bear with me for a few moments here this morning. AMEN. HE WOULD BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE THERE WAS THE THE TALK OF THE LATTER RAIN THAT WE'RE THAT THAT THE LATTER RAIN. WE'RE PRAYING FOR THE LATTER RAIN. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD say in the invisible or or in uh um uh the spoken word is the original seed. AMEN. HE WOULD SAY, "YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE FORMER RAIN BEFORE YOU CAN HAVE THE LATTER RAIN." &gt;&gt; And they would be asking, "Well, what is the former rain?" Well, the former rain was the rain that that that fell upon the seeds. Amen. And caused the crop to grow. THE LATTER RAIN WAS TO USHER IN THE HARVEST. IT WAS THE HARVEST RAIN TO MATURE the fruit. AMEN. SO HE WOULD SAY IN IN THE IN IN THE SPOKEN WORD IS THE ORIGINAL SEED. HE WOULD SAY, "NOW REMEMBER THE WORD MOA." AMEN. Mu or m o u r e h. That means teaching. AMEN. THE FORMER REIGN IS THE MORA REIGN. THE teaching reign. The teaching reign went forth. Amen. And it struck the world. Uh uh Billy Graham struck the world. Pentecost has struck the world. The world the word has struck the world. She He He says now she is waiting for the latter rain. That's when she produces her fruit. He says I hope you get her. Then the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be THE KIND OF CROP THAT YOU WILL REAP. NOW, NOW LISTEN, THERE HAD TO BE THAT PROPHETIC rain anointing. THAT HAD TO BE, and it's got to be. So if there's ever a serious time, it should be now TAKING GOD'S TEACHINGS THAT CAME THROUGH THAT PROPHET MESSENGER AND LETTING THOSE SEEDS find root in our heart. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONLY THOSE SEEDS ARE GOING TO produce the fruit of God's uh of this season. &gt;&gt; What is the fruit of this season? Well, this is the rapture season. This is THIS IS THE ADOPTION SEASON. This is the season of the manifested sons. This is the season. AMEN. TO FIND WHO WHO WE TRULY ARE. SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE TEACHING RATE. WE HAD TO HAVE A PROPHET TO COME AND teach us. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; TAKE THOSE WORDS AND BEGIN TO TEACH THEM AND LET THE LET THE DOCTRINE FALL LIKE RAIN UPON THE PREDESTINATED SEA. YOU SEE, YOU WERE ALREADY PREDESTINATED. YOU WERE ALREADY CALLED FOR THIS SEASON. BUT IT REQUIRED THE RIGHT KIND OF RAIN. IT REQUIRED AMEN. THAT DOCTRINE. HALLELUJAH. NOT A REFORMER'S DOCTRINE, NOT A NOT NOT A A A A A AN EVANGELIST'S DOCTRINE, BUT IT REQUIRED IT REQUIRED THE DOCTRINE IN ITS season from its prophet messenger. Right. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I'LL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET, and he will turn your hearts. &gt;&gt; It is in THE SEASON. IT'S IN THE SEASON. AMEN. TO WHERE OUR HEARTS NOT JUST NOT JUST LOOKING AT A SCRIPTURE OF justification or LOOKING AT ANOTHER SCRIPTURE, BUT THIS WOULD be a LITERAL TURNING OUR HEARTS BACK to what God originally had in his mind at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So God's not in denominations. Denominationalism is the very thing that has sown THE SEEDS OF DISCREPANCY. DENOMINATIONALISM IS THE VERY THING THAT HAS TAKEN EXPECTANCY OUT OF OUR HEARTS. DENOMINATIONALISM, AMEN, HAS MADE US JUST ACCUSTOMED TO being church members and sitting on a pew and just having a preacher preach TO US AND BECOMING COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS LAST DAY MESSENGER. HE WAS TO LITERALLY TURN OUR HEARTS BACK TO WHAT GOD HAD in his mind at the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, amen. Now, he would say, "Amen." He would say that the latter reigns when she's going to produce her fruit. I hope you get her now. And he says, "The word is going to produce sons and daughters."Uh, right? That's coming too. What? Now, look at THE GREAT LATTER RAIN supposed to be done. How they WOULD RUN OVER THE WALL, LEAP OVER, HOW THEY WOULD BE IN an ar be AN ARMY COMING. JUST WAIT A MINUTE. UHHUH. THAT KIND OF CROP IS WHAT YOU'LL GET IS THE CRIME IS THE KIND OF seed you put in your field. NOW I UH DENOMINATIONAL uh creeds will produce uh will produce fruit. They'll produce after their kind. &gt;&gt; They'll produce church members. They'll produce those kinds of things. But God's interested in word made flesh. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO GOD SENDS US A PROPHET. GOD WILL NOT REVEAL HIS SACRED word through any other way than through a prophet messenger. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; THE SEEDS THAT GOD HAS HAS DESIRED THAT GOD HAS DESIGNED FOR THE DAY COULD NOT be um TRUSTED IN THE HAND OF just any man. He had to raise a special man for that divine purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you see, he says NOW THERE'S TWO DENOMINATIONAL KINDS. AMEN. They'll unite together to GO TO SODOM. BUT THE WORD WILL STAY WITH THE ELECT, THE ROYAL SEED. JESUS SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT be in THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN." WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? IS BECAUSE THERE MUST COME AN END time anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have made the anointing into feelings, not God. We have made the anointing into a good service, not God. &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS WORD, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Living word, &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING IS ALWAYS, IT'LL NEVER CHANGE. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT ANOINTING IS GOING TO FALL IN THIS IN the la in the last days. Matthew 5:45, that you may be children of your father which is in heaven. For he makes his son to rise, the anointing to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain, his anointing on the just AND THE UNJUST. PAUL PICKS it up and he says there in Hebrews 6:7, "And the earth drinks and the rain that comes off on it and brings forth herbs, meat for them by whom it is dressed, and receives blessing FROM THE GOD. BUT THAT WHICH BEARS THORNS AND briars is rejected AND IS NIGH IN THE CURSING WHOSE END IS TO BE BURNED. SO THE ANOINTING IS NOT JUST FALLING on a certain group. It's falling upon the earth. Amen. And in in fact Joel says, amen that I'll pour out of my spirit upon all flesh. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, &gt;&gt; so the anointing, THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL. AMEN. We understand that that was exactly what happened through the teaching, that teaching rain, that former RAIN THAT FELL. AMEN. Uh as the dew from heaven UPON YOUR CROP, &gt;&gt; THAT BROUGHT YOU UP. EVERY PREDEST GOD KNOWS EXACTLY who you are. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's for his word to come. Now he would say he would say Joel's Joel said we we we fuss so much about latter rain had movements called latter rain, former rain, inner rain, outer rain. I was reading the other days, do do you know what former rain means in the Hebrew word? I in the Hebrew word, I can't call it now. Uh I I I I didn't write it down. It skips my mind. But the former reign, the first reign is a reign of teaching. The second reign is the spirit that comes upon what has been taught and produces the crops. &gt;&gt; Well, that should make you want to shout because we're living in the day of the former and the latter. And it's not going to be it's not going to be manufactured. IT CANNOT BE MANUFACTURED. You can you can do anything and everything you can to try to bring a MOVE OF GOD. THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN BRING A move of God. IF A MAN STARTS THE MOVE, A MAN can end the move. BUT WHEN GOD STARTS THE WORK AND THAT PREDESTINATED SEED IS ON IS IS ON THE EARTH IN THE EARTH AND THE PROPHETS'S MESSAGE HAS COME AND IT anoints the seeds it will produce after its kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the name of THE LORD. &gt;&gt; EVERY SEED must produce after its kind. God made man in his image after his kind to be his word on the earth. He expressed IT IN JESUS CHRIST. WHAT WAS GOD WAS IN CHRIST. THAT'S A MAN AFTER HIS KIND. OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? When Jesus come and he stood up there and says, "The Lord God has anointed me." Anointed me. He was God's predestined seed for that season. He was carrying the seeds of predestination. AND WHEN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET, AMEN, CAME UPON HIM, AMEN, AND WATERED THOSE WORDS, BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD. &gt;&gt; They came and said, "Now listen." Amen. He He said, "You he" He goes, he meets him down there at the water and and he says, "Baptize me." And John says, "I can't baptize you. I know who you are." He says, "Oh, suffer it to be so that we might fulfill all righteousness." Scriptures declaring it. Are you? It takes It TAKES A PROPHET MESSENGER TO IDENTIFY THE WORD. THE WORD MET THE PROPHET IN THE WATER. AND I WANT TO SAY THE WORD MET THE OUR PROPHET IN THE WATER THERE ON SPRING STREET. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS A PROPHET INTRODUCING THE MESSIAH, GOD'S ANOINTED WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; BUT WHY WAS GOD'S ANOINTED WORD INTRODUCED? &gt;&gt; IT WAS introduced for you as rain. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; As rain falling upon, Amen. the elect's heart to bring about the last day moving of God. Amen. That'll produce a rapture. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, "Now Jesus expressed it." Amen. What was it? God in Christ. That's a man after God's kind. See? Amen. He says, "When the word was in Christ, a man, a human being, expressing itself through him, that was God, the word in Christ, expressing itself. And God in the beginning made man in his own image." AND THAT'S THE KIND OF MAN THAT GOD MAKES TODAY. this seminary and incubator hatchery turns out a bunch of hybrids AND SEE THE SCHOOLS. BUT WHEN GOD CALLS A MAN, HE'S IN HIS own image. The word made alive in him. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE HE IS. THAT'S GOD'S MAN. MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE, IN HIS VERY LIKENESS. AND JESUS SAYS, "He'll do the works that I do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointing. Amen. This &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; bearing fruit, God's fruit &gt;&gt; in the prophet's season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the fullness of God, that's what it takes. Now, and I hope I'm not reading too many too much to you here this morning. &gt;&gt; I just I just wanted to bring some of this to you. Amen. This is all so rich to me. &gt;&gt; Christ is our Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was veiled in human flesh. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He was veiled in the tabernacle by badger skin. And this time, he's veiled in a man. And he is still Christ, the promised word for this age, &gt;&gt; veiled in human flesh. The word is God. The anointing is a person. So, HE'S TALKING ABOUT THAT ANOINTING AGAIN, the anointing coming upon the word for the day. He says, "THEREFORE, MOSES WAS CHRIST FOR HIS DAY. He was THE REDEEMER, THE ANOINTED ONE." AMEN. THE PROMISED WORD FOR THIS AGE MUST ALSO BE VEILED. SINLOVING MEMBERS, unbelievers of the church cannot SEE IT BECAUSE OF THE HUMAN VEIL. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. But there's a prophetic body. He says there from a little group of that true seed of the word, GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST, A BELOVED BRIDE, a virgin, a virgin of his word THROUGH THEM AND BY THEM WILL BE FULFILLED. ALL THAT HAS BEEN PROMISED FOR HIS word in the virgin who KNOWS NO MANMADE CREEDS OR DOGMAS. THE WORD OF PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE IT WAS IN MARY, GOD HIMSELF MADE MANIFEST. HE WILL ACT HIMSELF BY HIS OWN WORD OF PROMISE TO fulfill all that has been written of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You cannot stop what God's going to do in this in this generation. You cannot stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are holding predestinated seeds in your body. RIGHT &gt;&gt; IN THAT SOUL, THERE IS A PREDESTINATED WORD BORN. AMEN. A A SEED OF GOD WITHIN you &gt;&gt; and it's got to come to pass. It's got to bring it on. It's going. Someone says, "Yeah, but what if no one believes it?" Amen. Everyone of God's elect is going to believe it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every one of God's elect's going to believe it. You say, "Well, good. That just takes away all the pressure for me and I Hallelujah. Amen. That means if you just keep on continuing on this way with all of your games and with all of your junk when God's WANTING TO BRING AMEN. He knows exactly He knows how exactly what to get. He knows exactly what to do. HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO BRING YOU AROUND. YOU'RE GOING to come. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO THAT ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING to to the serpent's children this morning. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING TO AMEN. UH THE THE FOOLISH VIRGIN THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; I AM PREACHING TO THE ELECT OF GOD. AND YOU'VE BEEN PREDESTINED TO SHINE THE GLORY. YOU'VE BEEN PREDESTINED. GOD'S CHOSEN YOUR BODY TO LIVE HIS LIFE THROUGH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, God sent you a messenger &gt;&gt; so that the anointing could come every time. Every time. I I love the way he put it. He poured he just like pouring the anointing oil. He says he has poured the message &gt;&gt; into the bride. &gt;&gt; He's poured the message. &gt;&gt; Oh, the anointing has been poured into the Hallelujah. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. So, here's here's here's the kicker. Amen. Satan is going to do everything that he can. Amen. To take away from what God has done. But here's here's the news. MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE AND ANOTHER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THE SHEEP WILL ONLY KNOW GOD'S VOICE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Some says, "Well, whoa, I I I'm afraid I'm going to be deceived. I've got to quit." Amen. I, you know, we got to quit because we've heard and and and we don't want to be in a cult and we don't want to be this and we don't want to be that. Hallelujah. Amen. Well, they've done the same thing when the anointed word in Jesus Christ was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. They called Jesus IN A CULT. WHY? BECAUSE, WELL, THEY DIDN'T. THE word cult wasn't around those days. Amen. But they did call him a bibub. They did call him a fortune teller. They did call him all of these other names. They kicked him out of their church. AMEN. THEY PUT PEOPLE IN UH PRISON FOR BELIEVING IN JESUS BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT JESUS WAS AN OCCULT LEADER. &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOD'S WORD IN A BODY. &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOD'S DESIGN. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AND GOD HAS GOT A DESIGN. THERE'S GOING TO BE A BRIDE. THIS BRIDE IS GOING TO BE PURE AND SPOTLESS. THIS BRIDE IS NOT GOING TO HAVE SIN ON HER. THIS BRIDE'S GARMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE, AMEN. SPOILED, AMEN, BY THE PROSTITUTES OF THIS OF THE SYSTEMS OF THIS AGE. SHE'S GOING TO LOVE GOD. AND HIS LOVE, HIS ANOINTING, HIS GLORY IS GOING TO come upon her. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah the 60th chapter. Amen. Arise, shine, for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen. Now, here's that anointing. Light and anointing come up upon you. The glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. And behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and the gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory SHALL BE SEEN UPON THEE. OH, HALLELUJAH. So that tells me IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW DARK THE NIGHT GETS, HOW SICK MY BODY GETS, HOW BAD HOW IMPOSSIBLE MY SITUATION LOOKS. THERE IS AN ANOINTING AND I'm resting in assurance. You're not going to make it HAPPEN A DAY BEFORE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN A DAY AFTER. BUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING is resting NEATH THE LIGHT OF THAT ANOINTING. YES. &gt;&gt; OH, glory be to the lamb of God. AMEN. GOD TOLD GOD TOLD DAVID, AMEN. that David HAD ASKED, "CAN I GO TO BATTLE?" AND AND GOD TOLD HIM, HE SAID, "NO." AMEN. YOU WILL GO TO BATTLE, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING RIGHT NOW. HE SAYS, "GO UNDER THOSE MALBERRY BUSHES, AND YOU STAY UNDER THAT MALBERRY BUSH UNTIL THERE'S A RUSTLING IN the malberry bush." Amen. Don't you GO A MINUTE BEFORE. DON'T YOU GO A MINUTE AFTER. I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. DAVID WAITED THERE MAYBE FOR DAYS. AMEN. BUT WHEN THE ANOINTING COME DOWN UPON THE BUSH, AMEN. DAVID ROSE UP. WHY? BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN GIVEN A PROMISE THAT THE BATTLE WILL BE WON. THE BATTLE WILL BRING VICTORY. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AND THE ANOINTING IS HERE ON THE EARTH. YOU CAN'T WORK IT. YOU CAN'T MANUFACTURE IT. BUT YOU ARE STANDING THERE WAITING FOR GOD'S glorious &gt;&gt; anointing. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen? Ripening you. Ripening you. That that that little that little faith woman. Amen. THAT LITTLE FAITH WOMAN IS WAITING THERE BECAUSE SHE'S GOT SUCH INCREDIBLE PROMISES. SHE'S WAITING FOR that promise &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; She knows the anointing. There's nothing manufactured. The anointing is already on the earth for this season, for this timing. Some say, "Well, I want my children to be filled with the Holy Ghost." And I uh you you want to you want to get all in your flesh and try to make something to happen. I just say just keep the anointing flowing through your life &gt;&gt; because it's got to keep flowing. If God's touched your life, just let it keep flowing through your life. &gt;&gt; Let the anointing, it will bring every seed &gt;&gt; to its fruition. &gt;&gt; Mas and daddies, that gives you a rest in this day. That gives you a rest that every one of God's children will come to their rights. They'll come to their reality. Well, can you say amen? Maybe you're a young man, amen, that is struggling, a young lady, a struggling, AND YOU AND AND YOU WONDER. MAYBE YOU'RE WRESTLING WITHIN YOURSELF. AMEN. MAYBE MAYBE YOU'RE JUST EXACTLY, AMEN. LIKE LIKE JACOB. AMEN. JACOB HAD HAD SAID, "YES, I I'VE SEEN THE LORD. YES, I'VE SEEN THE ANGELS." BUT HE HAD STILL YET HAD not come into HIS HIS BLESSING. HAD NOT ENTERED INTO HIS BOSOM. BUT WHAT did he do when the anointing come upon him? He wrestled. Amen. Now, now the scripture says that Jacob wrestled. BUT IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK, I BELIEVE IT'S IN MICAH. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS WHEREAS WHEREIN JACOB WEPT WITH TEARS ALL NIGHT LONG UNTIL HE GOT HIS BLESSING. In other words, THERE COMES A TIME WHERE THAT SEED MUST COME. I I JUST WANT TO SAY GOD'S GOT A GREAT big old He's got a great big old clock. Hallelujah. He's got a timer on that clock. And you ain't going you you ain't GOING TO GO UP PAST AMEN. 1 SECOND. 1 mill OF A SECOND. WHEN GOD'S WHEN GOD'S CLOCK STRIKES 12 AND YOU'RE PREDESTINATED TO 12, YOU ARE GOING TO COME FORTH. &gt;&gt; All of your screaming and hollering and all of that. Amen. In between time is not going to do any GOOD FOR YOU AT ALL. WE are resting in the anointing upon THE EARTH. WE KNOW THIS ANOINTING IS RIGHT. WE KNOW THIS ANOINTING IS REAL. WE KNOW GOD'S WORD IN OUR IN OUR SOULS IS CORRECT. IT'S DRAWN US TO THAT ANOINTING. AND WE are resting in that promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, amen. It says that little group of the true seed of the word will God will present Christ a beloved bride, a virgin, virgin of his word, and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that's been promised for his word. And the virgin who knows who knows no man-made creeds or dogmas, the word of promise in himself like it was in Mary, God himself is made manifest. He will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill all that's been written of him. He does the fulfilling. A Amen. Amen. Amen. But now remember under that anointing that is here today, my sheep know my voice. THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING ANOTHER. There is there there is a sensitivity. He is near. The living WORD IS NEAR. NOW, IT MIGHT NOT BE THE TIME FOR YOUR PROMISE TO BE MADE real yet. It might not be THAT TIME YET, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, YOU'RE UNDER A RAPTURE ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; And under THAT RAPTURE ANOINTING, WHAT DID THE PROPHET SAY? HE SAYS DIVINE HEALING IS THE FIRST FRUITS OF THE RAPTURE. [Music] &gt;&gt; NOW, NOW, no other no other messenger was able to say that. Maybe maybe they weren't able to say that. They've been preaching HEALING ALL ALONG, BUT ONLY IN OUR UNDER THE RAPTURE ANOINTING COULD OUR MESSENGER STAND UP AND SAY, "WHEN YOU SEE DIVINE HEALING, IT'S THE FIRST FRUITS OF WHAT IS FIXING TO TAKE PLACE in this generation." &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S DESIRE. GOD WANTS TO BRING THERE. THERE'S NO OTHER AGE, AMEN, LIKE THIS AGE WHERE GOD SPECIFICALLY SAID, AMEN. THAT HE WOULD COME WITH HE HE WOULD RISE WITH HEALING in his wings &gt;&gt; and that you WOULD GROW UP AS CALVES IN THE STALL FOR WHEN MALACHI 4 AND5 COMES THERE WOULD be a supernatural occurrence &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; preparing preparing preparing preparing preparing can you say amen overcoming amen going through your trials having your sickness and yet God bringing you through going through your trial and God bringing you through. It's not in your It's not by your might. It's not by YOUR POWER, BUT IT'S BY MY SPIRIT, saith the Lord. I can give you no greater anointing. I can give YOU NO GREATER I IT'S NOT THE FEELING. IF IT WAS IN FEELINGS, I'D GIVE IT TO YOU. IF IT WAS IN EMOTIONS, I'D GIVE IT TO YOU. BUT I AM GIVING YOU SOMETHING THAT IS GREATER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I'M GIVING YOU THE ANOINTED WORD. &gt;&gt; There you go. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so he says as he did when he come through the virgin womb, type of the spirit womb. Now so will the virgin now accepting his word be it unto me as thou hast said though it was said by an angel while it was uh the the written word Isaiah 9 and6 they will love him and will have his potentials for he is their head they are HIS SUBJECTS SUBJECT to his headship of Christ was his Notice what harmony. Jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed it to him. Watch the harmony between God and Christ. So will the bride. And he shows her his word of life. He shows her and she receives it and she never doubts it. Nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Amen. He says, "I got a big great big hallelujah." Here is the secret. The word is in the bride. The mind of Christ to know WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD. She does it in his name. She has thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now he says, now when it's germatized, so the Holy Spirit waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose. They do only his will. Amen. He says, "I'll believe that no one can persuade them different. THEY HAVE THUS SAYAITH the Lord, or they'll keep still. Then they will do the works of God, for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete IN HIS DAY." ALL WHEN HE WAS THERE, WHEN HE was here, all things when he was here, he did not complete. All when he was here, for it was not yet time. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I think there has to be a real there has to be a real special reverence for what God has done. Don't that that the scripture says he meant grieve not the spirit. Grieve not the spirit. Don't don't don't be grieved in that spirit that that has got you sealed. Don't don't and there's a blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. What is the blasphemy? What what what is blasphemy? Blasphemy is not can't can't be forgiven. Blasphemy won't be forgiven. When the word when the Holy Spirit comes and lives in the word to make it live and we reject that, that is blasphemy. Jesus says, "Now the sacrifice has not yet been slain. I have not given my life yet. So you can make fun of the works of God in this human being. I'll forgive you." But when the Holy Spirit is coming down in each of the seasons and you reject what God is doing, then that sin cannot be forgiven. &gt;&gt; So it's it's imperative to us to reverence that Holy Spirit in our lives. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In such a way, &gt;&gt; that God feels honored. &gt;&gt; That that anointing is always at home. &gt;&gt; Take that anointing with you wherever you go. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Because truly God has come in our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has come. But even in that day after after the seals were open, &gt;&gt; he said, "Now what about the church? What kind of a messiah is the church looking for today? You the church has cried THE LOUDEST HOLLERING FOR ABOUT A MESSIAH. What are we hollering? Revival in our time back this that AND THE OTHER. WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING for to do it? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? WHAT DOES THE CHURCH WANT ANYHOW? We've already got it. God gave it to us. It's his promise of the hour. We look in the Bible and see it everywhere. anointed ones come on and made the word live again RIGHT IN THE HOUR FOR THAT HOUR. And we've got the Messiah. This is him, the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. And the word remains God. Hebrews 13:8. The same yesterday, today, and forever. We know what is supposed to take place in this day. We're wanting a Messiah, and God gave us the Messiah, his promised word. Do you understand? See, people think, "Well, the letter kleth." No, you're missing it. The letter does kill. The letter's been laying in the book all of this time. &gt;&gt; But when the anointing comes upon that word to make it live, THERE IS WHERE GOD'S MESSIAH IS. &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; God's fruit in the prophet season. &gt;&gt; All right. Some says, "Well, the we don't we we we no longer have the prophet. We, you know, we we're we're No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The prophet's words have already been spoke. The spirit of God has already planted those seeds. It's the teaching rain." &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same word of promise is circling the globe today to make that word become material right here in this service. God can make that word become material right here in this service. &gt;&gt; FAITH WILL BRING IT ABOUT YOU. WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE GET A little bit discouraged. We get discouraged sometimes because we're wanting. We're wanting. We're wanting. But have YOU REALIZED? JUST STOP FOR A MINUTE. I'M not going to hold you too much longer. But when Jesus was born, JESUS WAS THE VERY SON OF GOD. He was the the the immaculate he had immaculate conception. The anointing was there. SHE WAS OVERSHADOWED. PRODUCED THE BABY JESUS. Angels come down AN THEY'RE SAYING SINGING SINGING TO THE SHEPHERDS. I MEAN, IT WAS SUPERNATURAL. HERE COMES HERE COMES BLIND ANNA THE PROPHETIST COMING IN. AMEN. AND WALKS ALL RIGHT THROUGHOUT ALL THOSE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN TO THAT CHILD and begins to prophesy. Here is Simeon the old man. He He goes OUT OF ALL OF THOSE BABIES AND WALKS UP THERE TO THE ANOINTED WORD. &gt;&gt; Anointed word. And he says, "My eyes have seen the salvation of Israel. I've been promised this. Now catch it. IT WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE DEAL. And then you don't hear anything else for 12 years. &gt;&gt; You hear nothing else. The anointing on the earth. You don't hear nothing else of Jesus until he's he's lost, until his his mama and Joseph runs off and leaves him. And they have to come back. back. And when they find him, he's in the temple teaching and and and and debating with with with the priests and and they all looked at and marvel at this at this boy. Wow, this is a special boy. And then nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't hear nothing of his 15th birthday, 17th birthday, 20th birthday. This is God on earth. 25th birthday, third, and then all of a sudden, here comes a prophet messenger around declaring, "Now's the season." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, what I'm trying to say is the anoint Jesus was there. He was God's. He was that predestinated seed. He was the redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're waiting and we're waiting and we're waiting and we know God visited us in a church service. We know God said, "Amen." That he's going to do something. He's going to save our children or he's going to fill us with the Holy Ghost. And then all of a sudden, we go through amen. It's just sort of like uh uh I don't guess they do it on those TVs these days, but you know, in the old TVs, I'd go with grandpa and grandma's. Amen. And you'd have the black and white and it would be flashing in and out and then all of a sudden those little lines then flash back on and you know, wasn't having a clear connection. And you're thinking, man, I must have lost connection with God. God's forgot about me. God, what's going on? this that and the other. Amen. You are God's eternal. You are God's eternal thought. The anointing has come upon you. You listen. You've heard the message of the hour. The seed of God on the inside of you has agreed with it. You know this is God's truth for this hour. Stay sincere. Stay under that anointing because it's going to produce. It's going to LISTEN. IT'S GOING IT IS GOING TO HEAL PARKINSON'S. IT'S GOING TO TOUCH CANCER. IT'S GOING to You say, "Well, BROTHER WINDOW, WHEN IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN?" WE'RE IN THE SEASON RIGHT NOW. THERE MIGHT BE A SEASON YOU MAYBE YOU'RE WALKING INTO IT THIS MORNING. MAYBE GOD'S GOING TO OPEN A BLIND EYE THIS MORNING. MAYBE GOD'S GOING TO HEAL A LIVER THIS MORNING. I DON'T KNOW. UNDER THAT ANOINTING, STAY THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T QUESTION YOUR ANOINTING. DON'T QUESTION WHO YOU ARE. IT'S NOT IN YOUR EMOTION. IT'S IN BELIEVING WHAT GOD SAID. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 15. Amen. Went what? See uh 15 17 years. 17 years from when we heard of Jesus at 12 years old to when he entered into his ministry at 30. See, but the Bible says that Jesus was learning obedience through the things that he suffered. There was a preparation. He was God's Messiah. Do can do you agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's Messiah is here in bodies this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. JESUS SAID, "I CAN do nothing except the father first show me." And he was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Neither can you. &gt;&gt; Neither can I do anything &gt;&gt; but what the father first shows. &gt;&gt; But I promise you when he shows there's an anointing upon you. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour has been poured into you. Keep pouring that message. And I say get rid get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get get rid of everything else. I mean it would do it would do a bunch of us really good to just retire our phones throughout the day and just look at your messages maybe at night for an hour and then put it back in the closet and visit again the next night. Hallelujah. Go go go back to the the the oldfashioned telephones where Well, come on now. Amen. To where the anointing Hallelujah. Someone pointing at Sister Carol. She already does that. Amen. and uh but uh the but the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Amen. The anointing of the Holy Spirit, we're not waiting for some kind of a supernatural charge. Now listen, when God gets ready, I I want to tell you the prophet of God, Amen. He He would say when God would come, Amen. He would get numbed all over. He would it would be such So I know when God's going to do, he will vindicate it in your life. &gt;&gt; Come on. But the fact that people try to say that he was only anointed when he was seeing a vision, &gt;&gt; I disagree. &gt;&gt; He was God's messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this hour, &gt;&gt; he was anointed when God refused to talk to him for six months. &gt;&gt; He was anointed. He was anointed when the tax guys were after him. &gt;&gt; He was anointed when he told me, "Amen. Tell him I'm out. I'm I'm not here." And then him run outside the back. He was anointed. &gt;&gt; He was anointed. &gt;&gt; Did he have to learn obedience through the things that he suffered? Yes. But he was anointed. &gt;&gt; God was raising up a Malachi 4 messenger that was going to bring the word without compromise. And there's going to be a bride that is going to rest in that word. She's going to walk under that anointing. I SAY THIS MORNING, YOU ARE ANOINTED. &gt;&gt; OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my my. I love him here this morning. Praise the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The anointed word. &gt;&gt; The anointed word being vindicated before any man that's born to be a son of God with a predestinated germ in him for this hour. He'll seek God's message just as sure as there is a God in heaven. Martin Luther seen it for his. Wesley seen it for his. Pentecost seen it for his. Now, what about you? Uh what by they went into a denomination here is the word condemning it. telling you that we're what we're to have today just exactly Malachi 4 and all these other promises for this hour. Amen. What do you see? What are you looking at? Amen. Here we are. The real genuine eagles here. My sheep. Uh uh here. My sheep know my voice. A stranger they'll not follow. Why? It was put in there by predestination. You were fore orained to a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. You're only manifested in this day for his honor and glory. How can you do it without honoring his word and standing with every word of God? Yes, sir. WHICH YOU ARE A PART OF THAT WORD BY PREDESTINATION. BECAUSE LOOK, GOD IS THE WORD. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? WELL THEN, HE'S ALWAYS THE WORD. IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD. AND IF THE WORD WAS GOD AND YOU WERE IN GOD, THE WORD, THE PART THAT YOU'RE TO PLAY WAS IN GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. HE SEEN YOU. HE knew you. And he predestinated you to it. Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO LEAVEN AMONG YOU. THAT BRINGS THE ENTIRE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY AMONG YOU. COULDN'T DO IT in Luther's age. Couldn't do it in Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age. But in THE DAY WHEN THE SON OF MAN WILL BE MANIFESTED, REVEALED, BROUGHT BACK, THE CHURCH TOGETHER WITH THE ENTIRE DEITY OF GOD AMONG HIS PEOPLE, showing the same signs, manifesting himself as he did at the beginning when he was manifested on the earth in the form of a prophet God. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, where are you washing at? Worshiping at the house of God. You're seated in present tense anointed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Anointed. Hallelujah. What am I What am I trying to tell you today? Hallelujah. It's the word coming on word. He said, "My message to you, church, you that's in this union, this spiritual union by the word that you're dead to those old husbands, you've been born a new. Don't try to dig him up. He's dead. If you're born again Christian, that little germ that was predestinated to you, it's word coming on word on word on word on word and coming into the full statue of Christ. That's right. So he can come and get his bride. Now we're just ready for one thing, and that's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're anointed. &gt;&gt; TURN TO YOUR NEIGHBOR AND SAY, "YOU'RE ANOINTED. OH, YOU'RE ANNOYED, BUT I DON'T FEEL IT. YOU'RE STILL ANOINTED. AMEN. WELL, I DON'T SEE IT. YOU'RE STILL ANOINTED. WHAT IS DRAWING YOU IN THIS LAST DAY? WHAT IS CALLING YOU? WHAT IS BRINGING YOU? AMEN. YOU COULD be sitting out of some denominational, amen, CHICKEN YARD SOMEWHERE. BUT GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO COME TO HIS WORD. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF FAILURES YOU HAVE. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF UPSETTINGS THAT COME IN YOUR LIFE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THERE'S AN ANOINTING UPON YOUR LIFE AND IT'S GOING TO BRING THAT WORD TO PASS IN YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS IN EVERY ONE OF YOU CHILDREN. IT'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS IN YOU TEENAGERS. IT'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS IN YOU WAYWARD ONES. IT'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS. IT'S THUS SAYAETH the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in this day and musicians can come. Christ in this day that we now live in identifying himself deity among the people. He's still deity because he's the word. And when we see the word living itself, then we know that man can't do that. It's deity. The word being made manifest. But man, what what what is what HAS GOD DONE IN YOUR LIFE? You couldn't do it yourself. You wouldn't have you wouldn't have come INTO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WALKED INTO THIS CHURCH SERVICE this morning. There's some OF YOU THAT COULD NOT. YOU ARE YOU ARE BOUND BY SIN. YOU ARE BOUND BY BY RELIGION. But here you SAT HERE WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE SAYING, "AMEN." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Maybe you resisted and resisted and resisted, BUT IT WASN'T YOUR TIME YET. WHEN THAT TIME STRUCK, [Music] &gt;&gt; you came out and God says, "I've got something for you." You always were. [Music] He knows what season. He knew that in this church age, we'd have a Malachi 4 in 1909. He knew that in this church age, this fellow would be born in 1970. He knew that Darren Martin would be born in 1950. He knew he knew. He knew he knew the exact time. He knew that you were you were going to run from him for eons of time. He knew it. All part of the plan. But there's an anointing on this earth that you are not going to you are not going to run away from. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go through it in our minds. Sometimes we trying to figure out who we are. [Music] Sometimes we we don't we we don't we don't know. God knows. God knows exactly who you are. God knows exactly who you are. &gt;&gt; You might not know. You might think you know. But why all the wrestling? Why all the wrestling? [Music] Is because you have not anchored your heart yet. You've not come to that reality of who you are. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell you, you're a son of God. &gt;&gt; You're a daughter of God. and the anointing. Whether you've got whether you have got chills going up and down your spine this morning, that's I I I love all of my I love the motion. Glory to the lamb of God. Glory to the lamb of God. I guarantee you Jesus wasn't feeling the anointing as he's on the cross fulfilling all those scriptures on that day. that &gt;&gt; he was God's anointed lamb. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe Jonah didn't feel the anointing in the bottom of the well, belly of the whale. Maybe the Hebrew boys didn't feel the anointing either. They didn't change the fact that the son of man wasn't there. didn't change the fact that the pillar of fire went there with Daniel. It doesn't change the fact. It didn't change the fact that while Moses was out there in the wilderness wandering around trying to find who he was, that the anointing wasn't upon him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I love him. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I love you. What are you playing, brother Kobe? [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. [Music] that you see &gt;&gt; through eyes of love a hopeless case an empty place &gt;&gt; if not for grace [Music] where would I be [Music] you only I'm glad to see through eyes of love a hopeless case an empty place if not for grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sweet the sound. [Music] All was lost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now I'm found. Hope was the son of man. The word living itself again among the people. See the word itself made flesh in you. You're a reflection of this hour. The message the reflection of it. You live again. You live the life that was in Christ Jesus. You're in the presence. He says we're not a divided people. We got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God. We must come together. Then the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it. When the church sets together in heavenly places, then the fullness of the power of God is in his church. Each one of us holding spiritual gifts, spiritual offices, coming together brings the pillar fire back to the people. Oh God, oh stir my heart. Stir my heart. Stir every heart here this morning, Lord. Stir our hearts. If there's some of us that are sitting on the fence, oh God, I pray that your anointing would come upon them. Oh Jesus, that I live it exactly the way that you want them. Lord, I throw myself in there, too. Oh God, we need you this morning. Father, we yield ourselves to this anointing in this hour. Let your word live in us, through us. Oh, your fruit in the prophecies, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory. The empty place. If not for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. I once was lost but now I'm found. Hopeless cave. empty place. If not for grace, where would I be? What I be, you only know that you see through eyes of love, hopeless days, empty place. If not for grace once again, where would I be? You only know &gt;&gt; that you see through eyes of love. Oh, empty place and grace. Precious Lord. Oh precious Lord, please take my hand. Lead me on and help me stand. The hope is case empty place for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing grace. Thank you, Lord. How sweet the sound. Once was lost, now I'm found. Hopeless cave, empty place, not for grace. [Music] music fades &gt;&gt; and all is stripped away &gt;&gt; and I simply come &gt;&gt; longing just to breathe. something that's of worth that will bless your heart. &gt;&gt; I'll bring you more than a song. &gt;&gt; For a song in itself, it's not what you have requires. [Music] You search much deeper within &gt;&gt; through the way things appear and looking into my heart. Coming back to the heart of worship when it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the fake I made it, but it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. King of endless world. No one could express how much you deserve. Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours. Every single breath I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. [Music] Coming back to the heart of worship when it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus.

Healing in the presence. He leading in the presence of the Lord. There is he lead in the presence. He lead in the presence in the presence of &gt;&gt; He lead in the presence of the Lord.

Nothing like his presence. &gt;&gt; Nothing like those his presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you." [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe that. I believe that we love the Lord with all of our heart. I [Music] know I read a lot of quotes this morning, but I wanted to bring sort of bring continuity to the anointing that is here that it if we can just believe and reach up, it's it's it's with you. &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's here. And while we don't put emphasis on healings, we don't put emphasis on on physical manifestations. We put the emphasis on the word and we believe that. And when we know whatever we have need of in the time that we need it, it's there. So, we're not chasing healing. We're chasing after God. His anointing is with us. Then we can reach up and grab it and bring it down to us. Whatever we have need of here this morning. Amen. Amen. And so, we appreciate your attendance. We're thankful for what God is beginning in in your life, Weston. And it's not a one It's not a one-time trip to the altar, not a one-time prayer. It's &gt;&gt; it's talking to God every day and asking God for his help and his grace. And I can say that for us all. We're all that way. We all have to talk to God. But none of us can serve the Lord in ourselves. But we really can't. The sooner that we give ourselves to the Lord and surrender everything to God to do it his way, the better for all of us. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] And um and then we just had this uh young man come up to the altar here and uh said he had given his heart to the Lord a week or so ago and he wants to get baptized.
