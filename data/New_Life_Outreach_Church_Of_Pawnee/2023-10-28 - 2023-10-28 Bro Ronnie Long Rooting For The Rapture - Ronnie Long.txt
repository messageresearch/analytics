Let see brother Kobe amen praise the Lord just good to be here amen we thank brother Wendell for the opportunity and amen maybe just as they're playing this and just ask the Lord to come in and we believe he's here and his presence is amongst us but if there's a special need you have on your heart tonight that could only be answered by the word not by a man or Not by an idea but just you need a a word from the Lord tonight maybe just make it known by the uplifted hand and father we love you Lord we thank you for your grace that's brought us this far Lord and Lord we thank we're thankful for this Lord Place of Refuge that we've come in Lord and father we've been able to just lay aside our cares and thoughts and Troubles of the world and father we've been singing praises to your name here father we believe you're please Lord and Lord you made a promise to us that wherever two or three are gathered in your name you'd be right in the midst of us father Lord we know that you're here already and you're here to do a work amongst us father and Lord I know there were needs and hands raised Lord there's there's things in our life that only you can fix Lord only you can do and only you can speak to father and Lord I pray that Lord you allow a level of surrender to come in the building father for the speaker and the hearer alike Lord that we could just move out of the way Lord and let your word have preeminence and let your word go forth father and fulfill the purpose that it's meant for In This Moment father Lord we just surrender all that we are to you ask that you just come by our way father Lord we openly recognize there's nothing we can do in our flesh Lord nothing we can do as a man for one another but Lord you've chosen to use vessels of clay to vindicate yourself in this age father and Lord we look for you to come and speak to us now Lord father we just dedicate this service and this time to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles we'll turn to the book of St John the first chapter the Lord amen praise the Lord the Brandon would say we're not just come together to talk about the message yeah we are come together to get in the message all right and I'm thankful for that that we're not just here to talk about something but we're here to get into something he says that message is Christ he is the word and we're to get into it get beneath it now that's that's a commission for us not just to get associated with it but to get beneath it which means it's our headship it's our it's our lordship it's our everything to get beneath this word amen the Bible would say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not yeah and the 12th verse would say but as many as received him to them gave he power to become I that's a powerful phrase power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen may God bless his word tonight you may be seated so we just want to for a few minutes we don't to take a lot of your time tonight but we're going to speak on rooting for a Rapture right I believe we're rooting for a Rapture and this scripture would tell us that there's there's something taking place here that John's trying to describe to us and he's he's Penning this down but it was very precise it sounds much like Moses's Penning right in the beginning was God right in the beginning so there's some conversation they're having with another another another Force other than themselves that's telling them what has gone on before their time and so John is is writing this this not just to not just to be different than the other gospels but he's got a revelation of something he's got something in mind here when he's writing this down and if you go back and you look in your in your history you'll find brother William that I'm sure you know this that John actually wrote this book after he was caught up on the aisle of Patmos so John is writing this from a revelated position he's not writing this from just a level where everybody else is at but he's been caught up in a higher realm in Heavenly places in Christ so he comes back to write this to us to tell us something the word that was in the beginning is the word in the middle will be the word at the end the same word in every way it will do the same thing by the same Power by the same manifestations it won't change a bit but the word in the beginning will be the same word at the end and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us right so that word became Christ and it was dwelling amongst them and it was shaking hands and it was fellowshipping with them and then that word uh uh moved on and had had dinner with them and it had broke bread with them and then thist RT didn't expire brother Miguel when Jesus went went up off the scene but the word is still made flesh in this day the word is still to be made flesh in this hour and in this time so he's looking for somebody and he's given us the power to become this word is that what the scripture says he gave them power to become the sons of God so I thank God it's not about my skill or my strength or my ability but he gave us power to become the very word in the same way in every way not a little a little bit different not not a little bit weaker down or watered down but the same in every way that he was you shall also be I think that's a Great Commission to the church in this hour that we're not going to settle for anything less than the same right somebody say same brother the BR was say it like this but you remember when it went down the grain begin to ripen and you find that the grain before that grain can ripen everything in that stock has to be dead so can't you see where you're standing life is in the grain again just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in The Bride form same power same church same things same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to aead here and all that life come through there picked up its people and now is forming into a head for the Rapture so he's saying that all the life through all the ages has funneled through time and funneled through this age and that age to come forward to a finishing cycle and I believe that's where we're living right now and I brother brother wendle was just mentioning it you don't have to look far to see that the world is shaking and that the times are at hand and I you know brother Wendell I I I think if I was a message critic I'd be real uh scratching my head right now a little bit shaking in my boots because everything is playing out just exactly as we were this is no surprise to us but we were expecting this day to come and it should it should it should Quicken us to realize the hour is at hand the the hour is come and is now is that he is going to fulfill his word and so if he's fulfilling that part of his word he's also going to fulfill this part of his word if we see Israel being fulfilled in her time then the bride will also be fulfilled in this time so we see all of the the world shaking and groaning and crying but all of that is focused on the manifestation of the sons of God so if that is taking place then this is also taking place and it's not just one church spearheading this or one pastor spearheading this but it's a global bride movement that we're moving into a Rapture Ready body that we're we're tired of the day to day I don't have to pass the mic around and know Miguel are you tired of going to work yes because we're tired of the day to day and the in and- out and brother John you're tired of going back to the same job and we're ready to Rapture out of here it's not because we're lazy or we don't want to go to work but this is not our home this is not where we belong we shouldn't fit in here we shouldn't feel comfortable here but we were not called to fit in here we were called to take a body change and we will never be comfortable until this body takes a change and there's another body waiting there that's why you don't even feel comfortable in your own skin sometimes cuz it's not really your body there's another one waiting for you I go to prepare a place for you right that body is just a few feet away already prepared specifically for you so that's why you don't fit in here that's why you don't feel comfortable here we shouldn't feel comfortable in leoa we should be ready for a Rapture and I believe we're ready to lay everything aside can I get an agreement we're ready to lay everything aside and say enough I I I I don't want to I don't want to settle for another year of this I say even so come Lord Jesus and we got different age groups in here and young men let me tell you your days are allotted by the Lord so as long as you're in the perfect will of God whatever days you have are the days in God's mind and old people alike whatever days you have are the days in God's mind so why would we want to continue on outside of what God's already prepared for us but he's prepared a place for us and we've had enough of the world we've had enough of trying to keep the faith and you had a victory and you wonder how long am I going to keep this Victory before I fall off this mountain again but there's coming a time when you rise up in Victory and you won't have to go back down in defeat again but it will be the final overthrow of your enemy and I believe we're stepping into that realm we're stepping to that time where we're saying enough with the world we're moving on I'm Not Looking Back lot Lot's wife is not my type that's why it's not comfortable May that's a lot of times why a lot of us don't find great success in this world because we're not meant to be comfortable here we're meant to have success in the word of God and until we get into that Groove into that sequence of Life It'll be such a struggle for us but if we will let go of our worldly desires and our worldly Ambitions and say I want to line up with the word of God there's a peace that passes all understanding if we have to drink Branch water and eat soda crackers we're lined up with the word of God and that's what makes the difference in our life I believe I'm speaking to a group of people that know that we're tired of the world I don't want to be here next year I don't want to be here in the coming years and we're you know the holidays are coming up and people make PL I don't want to be here for those come on if I'm here we'll have a good time and we'll eat but I don't want to be here for those I've got another body that's pulling on me I've got another place a mansion already prepared that's calling me to come up higher and and I don't have to deal with this anymore more you know we don't have to deal with what the devil gives us in life I think that's a lie the devil's put over the church for too many years we don't have to just deal with the complexes and the and the issues and the anxieties and the temperaments there's another place for us a body prepared and Christ doesn't do work like some contractors do work his work is perfect without flaw brother BR said it's the same right remember that word same same that's what the church is doing today for Jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the Bride is a part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day it's the same word same experience same life got it Caleb same say same same and so spiritual weak can lay before the so n to be turned to a golden grain of the word see made word God made flesh Vindicated he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also the church that lives by that word ripening not through organization but in the presence of the word the sun it becomes what the very same word that went down on the day of Pentecost yeah now doesn't Malachi 4 teach us that before the the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come that this will take place how many knows that and he will restore the hearts of the children to the fathers is that right the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers and in that day I Luke 17 uh Jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not men the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the peopleall the word itself made flesh in you now this is a challenging statement brother William you are a reflection of this hour the message amen you are a reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in Jesus Christ and you're in the presence of the the son you're a reflection of this amen that's right he's he's called you to to a position to be the reflection of him in this age now I believe we're all in here tonight because we didn't have anything better to do and we we certainly could be somewhere else and we could be doing something else but we came here because we love the Lord Jesus right and we want to receive something from him so if we're going to if we're going to love him with all our heart I would think we want to represent him the best way that we could right we want to be the same as he is in action and in deed and in word and not from that but we've been given authority to have the same power that he had so why would we settle service in and service out for anything less than the same and I I wonder tonight how different our our position would be if the literal Lord Jesus in his body was standing here and he was taking requests tonight what would we bring to his request what what would we bring to his feet and ask him for but he's the same tonight we don't need him in a literal body we have him in his word body we have the same Authority tonight if we recognize it's the same power within us by the same experience by the same life right we in agreement tonight amen amen so there's a requirement for us to be the reflection of the message I like that that hook just stands out I have to look for it or tosses just right there good job whoever did that so you see he has cut wants to cut the church out just like he did the Sun out yeah like he did the bride in the groom you see he's talking about a pattern right they're they're both virgins yeah but one's wise and it's cut out of the pattern and it's in the bride group right that is the bride that he's cut out of that pattern to be his bride you must be part of him not part of the Creed not part of the church not part of the denomination but the part of him hewed out from any other kind of form won't work you got to be hewed from the word the world cut off of you just leave the world only live in you the great sculpt is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires in the last day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ is the identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh and you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the Masterpiece for the bride now Brethren God has a ma had a masterpiece then to present to the world and now he wants a masterpiece today he would say are you willing are you ready my Christian friend are you ready to be the fullness of the word now I I I I if I could just bear my heart here for a minute we started on quotes like this of the original pattern and the original Church going back to Pentecost and immediately there's an identification that takes place of the direction of the sermon but I'm not afraid to quote a quote I'm not afraid to quote what brother brandom said about it in fear that I might be labeled or I might be cast this group or cast than that group but I think we want all the word right we've had enough of just part of the word or this direction of the word but the bride will be hungry for all the word and she will say only what he said in all of what he said and I think it's very important that we maintain the Same Spirit as how he said it and brother Mitch I could take these quotes and I could use a quote against you and make you think that you'll never obtain rapturing Grace you'll never get it by misconstruing what the prophet said but I'm not saying it in the spirit that he Ed it in and for years I I I was born into a message realm and a message church and I grew up in thinking this direction but then you start to get Revelation you realize that's not what he meant at all but that was misrepresented or that was mishandled and so by that we have different different forms in our mind that if someone were to bring a quote to us immediately within us we're thinking he's going this direction and so we've already preconceived this in our mind by somewhere where we've been we've been mishandled with that bit of word is that all right am I okay we've been we we've been mislabeled right we already have a label over us and you know there when I moved to brother brother uh brother Wayne sends his greetings by the way but when I moved up there to that church it was labeled the Amish Pentecostal church I thought good Lord what am I getting into going to this church it's Amish Pentecostal I found out just Believers I found out it was just a bunch of Believers like I was but they had a label over them and if I wasn't able to look past the label I might not ever walked in the door but then come to find out it's just wonderful good people that love the word yeah but you see how a label would have scared me away from coming into that church because it's denomination and denomination an Amish Pentecostal Church well I don't want anything to do with a double denomination church but then you go there and you find out oh the word's being preached and it's being received and just because they have some excitement about them they're labeled Pentecostal you see how easy a label takes place we find that when this message this message was first preached and and the prophet was on the scene and he was preaching it and there was there was hordes of people people that would come but they weren't really there for the word they were there for the healing and they were there for the blessing and they were there for the for the angel in the room and they were there but some of them were grasping the word right because God will always have a seed it's like brother Brandon would preach the message I think it was after he got done preaching future home and he gets in the car with brother Billy and he says Billy did you understand what I preached tonight said yeah Daddy yeah yeah he said did you really understand what I preach tonight and he said at that moment I realized I didn't understand what he had preached tonight he said ' no I I I guess I didn't daddy and he said yeah I doubt whether five people in that group understood what I was preaching tonight questions and answers on the seals he'll say this isn't for you don't worry about it don't stress about it but there's a people coming all right so you see in that time he was preaching this message but it was a seed laying down there was a seed coming forth and at the appointed time that seed would come up through a bride body that would understand what he was preaching about they would understand a future home they would understand the seven seal they would understand these things but you see how men got involved in the message was by uh a lack of a lack of resource if I could say it like that it wasn't that they were bad men or they had they had uh bad ideas I'll give them Grace and say that they weren't trying to build their own kingdom but they only had a limited resource so brother bram's taking off the scene and there's just a few tapes right there's just a they don't even have all the messages uh finished and and unreal a real and I remember I spoke to a sister in Indiana some months ago and she was just maybe 12 or 13 years old when she was going to brother Bam's meetings and she said she remember when he went out the scene and they would have church in their living room and they would play a real toore and she said they had to wait because you didn't have money to buy a whole set of real to reals and they didn't have them ready anyway so you'd you'd have a real toore and you'd mail it back and then they'd re-record on it and they'd mail it back to you but the John imagine being a preacher and having to rely on a on maybe a real toore coming in every 2 three months and so you're just hammering down on that real toore then you have to send it off and wait till one comes back and even at that you only have a couple hundred recorded messages right we're in the late 60s now maybe early 70s and they just have limited resources but they made it right they didn't have uh the 1200 messages we have but they made it and they continued on in the faith and then they move into it and you got tapes coming out and then you got you got you know this sister it was pretty it was pretty interesting she told me she sent off a real toore and one came back and it had a brother's name on it she just remembered the name something struck within there I remember this brother's name and just a few years later that would be her husband and it was his name on the real toore that she got into her house you see God's got it all in control he knows where everybody's at and where everybody's going to come together in every Junction and he's got a spouse for everybody if we could just line up with the word of God it'll happen he knows where everybody's at right so she she said it was it was like it was like like like w something like wanting a burger but there being no burger place in town but she knew it was out there she knew there was more word but it was just not accessible yeah right so you see how how how then a a real toore would come into a church and then that man would take that real to real and he would preach it to the people from his filter I hope this is okay he would preach it from his filter and so not everybody had a real toore player not everybody had access to the tape library but what happen is is a man would take a a tape and he would preach that tape but it was always through that man's filter not that he was a bad man but it was a limited resource of Revelation and so you couldn't tie these loose ends together because you didn't have the whole package right you didn't have all the messages you didn't have all the uh you know the sheveport series tying with adoption you didn't have those things together at the same time you had all these and I remember my dad uh when I was young it was all about books you just had the books and not everybody even had a whole tape library but everybody had a book library right and I remember he had a he had a a whole set of red volumes and it was like the coveted shelf you know and he would always go to that red volume preach out the red volumes they had red duct tape all over them and he'd have those things just Pages falling out he'd preach out of that and then one day one of his red volumes went missing and I remember just being like a total loss you know what are we going to do and he tried to you know find it tried to find it dig it up look at the church ask the church does anybody SE my red volume no went on a couple years and we uh we we go somewhere to another church and he's in that Pastor study and he's got a set of red volumes say oh I've been looking for a couple quotes out of my volume three you know and pulls it down and opens it up and he says that looks like my handwriting said man this guy made notes exactly the same as I made notes he thought no surely not and he flips to the back of the book and sure enough the guy's name is in the back of the book man this is interesting it flips back and just looks for another quote this is my handwriting I made this note right here and goes to the back of the book and and there's a little curl on the label and rips off the label and sure enough his name is underneath that label I it got pretty weird in the office I bet oh I don't know how that got there but you see if we stop at the label of what Satan puts in front of the surpris we'll never really see what's there we'll never really see the reality of what's meant for us but we we are coming to a place where we're ready to tear off the label you can label me Pentecostal you can label me perua you can label me Thunders you can label me whatever you want to but I'm going to stay with the word I'm going to stay with the word and I don't care what you label it I don't care what you call it I don't care what you think I'm not really interested in your opinion I'm interested in what the word says and as for me I'll stay with the word I will like to believe that the Lord spoke to that brother and that brother and that brother about their Revelation but as for me I'll stay with the word the B said maybe that brother just misunderstood but I have an obligation to stay with the word because it's the same and we will not make it outside the same in every way it's got to be the same he says how can two walk together except they be agreed how can you do it you can't but on the day of Pentecost what made the Holy Spirit come they was in one Accord if you ever asked yourself that question what caused the Holy Spirit to come into that upper room they was in one Accord and that's what made the Holy Spirit Come and now what they was that's the way we ought to be now and then the Holy Spirit can come upon us right amen he says thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard somebody say standard stand that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep doing on doing until the church age closes so you can label me what you want to label me but I'll stay with the word right but what's happened is through this limited resource and this limited knowledge a man would obtain this tape and he would preach it through his filter and then you end up with divisions and fissures and separations and you've got this guy's only got this set of tapes so he's going to preach it from this angle and the people do not have access at this point to all the word I remember when you had to look up a quote brother Miguel you had to go you had to wait till you found somebody with a computer that had the table on there and you would go try to search that quote out until then you had a whole list of quotes you were trying to look up but now we've got no excuse this is open app come on it's free you can download it for free and you have the entire message in the palm of your hands you got no excuse and by that God science thinks that they've tapped into this resource by their intellect but God has allowed them to tap into this so that he might use it to get the word to you and to you and to you and to you without another filter but by your own filter of the Holy Ghost and it comes forward and now when the man of God behind the pulpit Rings a certain sound you can say Amen to the word because it's coming through the same filter that you already have received the word and you recognize it as God using his word to activate something in your life right so you see how how man would get in here and put labels on things and then men would be afraid to use certain quotes or they' be afraid to go a certain direction as fear that they might lose a friendship or they might lose and this happened I mean I I know what I'm talking about personally you lose relationships and and you lose because you preach a certain direction and that person has labeled that direction as this and see so you end up with just a separation happening and many of us young ones were born into something we had no idea what was going on why don't we fellowship with that church or why isn't there fellowship with this group over here why isn't there this because 35 years ago somebody preached something that didn't agree with this or didn't agree with that and there was a separation that took place and see everybody over there they're all emotional and they're all this and they're that and they're they're the Thunders group and then you have the other group over here that's the perua group and they they can't say Amen they can't cry they can't move in their Pew and then this group over here just stands up and shouts you can't even hear the preacher speaking and then you have a return Ministry group and you have this group and you see what happens man got involved and anywhere you have man involved you're gon to it's not going to line up you're G to have issues come so why I asked myself this question why was the church at Pentecost the pattern why was it God's pattern for the perfect church was it because they could speak in tongues was it because they had signs and wonders why were they called the pattern of the true church brother BR would say until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease what the church had at Pentecost is her aailable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost the original church was not organized by men somebody remember that not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God and it stayed with the original word pattern now just to clear something up I'm not talking about isusa street I'm talking about the original church at Pentecost I I have no desire to go backwards in this plan of God I'm not trying to go back to something that we already came from but he said come out of her and be not partakers of her so we're not interested in going back to a denomination thought where where by it's by emotion or by the initial evidence or by this or that we only want the word and I'm tired of just having half a quote and half a quote and not being able to tie those quotes together but as the end time bride we're ready for that to dob tail together where this fits that and that fits that and we're ready to go on with the whole word I don't want just half the word or this opinion or you know I believe the devil has used limited resource to stumble the bride for too many years but we've got no excuse left we have the opening of the the word we have an open resource we have a revelated Ministry preaching this in this age it's on us to line up with the word you know the devil has used religious Spirits at the back door of a church to stumble more Christians than alcohol or cigarettes or anything else a religious spirit standing there with a tap measure and no Grace and law and law and law and law and law and I personally I know people that will never darken the door of a church again lest God do something miraculous in their life because because of a religious spirit that didn't understand the fullness of the word but I'm not interested in that opinion you shouldn't be interested in my opinion don't just take what I'm saying for it don't just take what brother Wendell's saying don't just take what brother Josh is saying but take what the word says about it and when he preaches the word you know it lines up and you get in the groove and say amen that's what's calling me that's what's Rising me higher I don't want a man's opinion I want the whole word the same experience with the same demonstration right so why was it the original pattern they were gathered in the upper room in one Accord in one mind now whose mind was it this church was not organized by men there was not a great Bishop among them that rose up and said you guys have to line up with my idea but it was led by the Holy Spirit and they had to gather together in that Upper Room to do do something that we must do tonight get rid of our own idea get rid of our own thought get rid of our own pet Doctrine get rid of our own agenda get rid of our own Direction and come into the surrender of the word and say everything else is gone I don't want anything else I I don't want to attach to anything else but I only want what the word says about me all right so they spent 10 days in an upper room wasn't very big I used to know the exact dimensions but I I don't think brother William it was much bigger than probably just a section of pews here not much bigger than that for 120 people that's pretty tight space these 120 people were called GA in that Upper Room why it was a commission right he said Terry there and Jerusalem and wait until you're endued with this power that he's talking about in John 1 power to become the sons of God so here's where we enter into our thought for a minute here what did they do knew that was so pleasing that God himself would come and break himself up and pour himself into every vessel in that room they got rid of their Humanity they got rid of their own thoughts they got rid of opinions they got rid of they got rid of uh ideas about one another now these 120 people already went to church with each other they rubbed shoulders with each other they hunted they were Hunting Buddies they were fishing buddies they they hung out with each other they had competition with each other they they they they they ate supper with each other they prayed together they worked together and then they're shoved in a room together that's why it's easy for a cyber Church to maintain a large membership with 1500 1800 members because they don't have to fellowship with one another they don't have to get along with one another they could just stay home and and and and just be on their own but we're not required to do that we're required to have Fellowship because that's the attribute of God forsake not the assembling of yourselves together right why is that because God wants fellowship with his children and he wants his children to have Fellowship it's kind of like if you're if you're the third part of a friendship and you want these two friends to get together and they don't get along it's pretty awkward for you so why would God have a kingdom that's awkward when we can't get along with each other we can't rub shoulders with each other and we can't shake hands with each other that's not God's design but that's still mankind involved and they were in that upper room for 10 days and there wasn't one man over the top of them saying you know this says when I'll set my approval upon it but it was led by the Holy Ghost right and they were trying to maybe I think brother Brandon brings up a reference where they might have tried to get out there and Peter said not yet not yet we're not ready yet why did Peter know they weren't ready yet because he was Peter and he knew he still had his temper he knew that he still had a grudge against the guy sitting in the corner and he's been avoiding him for 10 days and he knew there was something there he just couldn't fix and he knew that it was out of his and and but until he got to the point where he didn't care anymore and was willing to let go of The Grudge he had between this brother and that brother it never happened it would have been 50 days it would have been 100 days but until there was a surrender of their own selves God would not move into that place but once they got to the point where they were they wanted the whole word and nothing but the whole word and not just a piece and not just a part and not just a crumb but they wanted The Full Experience the same way that he promised it they were ready to let go of everything else you know when you get in desperate times and you realize there's no other option you'll you'll find out that once you hold on to you so dearly is really not that important and you'll let it go if you realize that it's it's life at stake it's your children's life at stake it's your family's life at stake and you realize you know my beautiful home in this state over here is really not that important if there's no word there you've got to go to where the word is Right you've got to come to where the carcass is and that's what the believer will do and they'll recognize that everything else is really not that important but it took them 10 days all right shoulder toosh shoulder fellowshipping with one another how many opinions were in that room at least 120 maybe 240 we're talking men women wives husbands together in one room for 10 days opinions ideas doctrines I wonder what would happen if we all had to shove in one room for 10 days I wouldn't wish that on you brother wendle but but it's got to be the same right it's got to come the same way so there's got to be something that's the same and Paul would pick this up and he say if there be there any consolation in Christ of any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus that's why the Holy Spirit came into that room let this mind be in you now you've got to let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus right so they had to get rid of their Humanity enough to let the mind of God come into them and dictate to them and control them and be their lord right right we're not come to talk about the message not enough to be associated with it say I go to a message church that the devil don't care and God don't care if you say you go to a message church or you're associated with it he wants you to be in the word which is the message but there's a label right there's a label there but you've got to know him like brother BR would say we learned from our Prophet right I didn't learn how to preach from anybody else but listening to tapes I don't know him real well I don't know the Bible real well but I know the author and maybe I can't quote all the quotes and I can't divide all the Mysteries and I can't but I know him and the only way you get to know him is by surrender of you and let his mind be in you right so these were these were people that fellowship with each other ate with each other you think they'd ever been offended at each other you think they'd ever been sore at one another had a hard time shaking hands with one another now these are these are hot-tempered high-tempered Jews all crammed into one room you think they ever got offended at one another come on you think they ever threw dirt at one another and threw a shoe at one another but they overcame it but they got together right how many in here said I'm not going to go back all right I don't care what they do to me I'm never going back there I don't care if they buy me a steak dinner I'm not going back to that church I'm not going to go back I don't you know I don't care but what happened was is you got offended at something and you let Humanity get in the way but I want to say that you're still here tonight and you're still here because you have something in you that was greater than the offense that came your way there's something in you that was greater than the hurt that you endured or the or the scar that you have there's something in you that's greater than even your own ability or you would not be here tonight but God rich and mercy has gave you the strength to be here tonight to continue on because of if it was up to us we would have all given up years ago and decades ago but we're here tonight because something in US is greater than the offenses that we've endured in this life something in US is greater than the than the brother didn't shake my hand or somebody sat in my seat or I was offended by this something in US is greater and that's what's brought us here tonight something in us has brought us what is it it's God Christ in flesh in you he is searching brother B said for someone that he can dwell in I say why not you why not me what brought you here you think it's your own you didn't have anywhere to be you might think well my mom drag me in here not really buddy but you're here because God put something in you and despite what you want to do in yourself there's something in you that pulls you to a higher plane than neighbor you would ever have the strength to go it's the strength of God in your life it's Grace in your life that God's brought you this far I would have given up years ago I have a list of reasons brother William I grew up in church you know how many offenses I've recorded in my life anybody that knows me personally you know how many people I've offended with my personality but I'm still here yes sir I've had a list of reasons I'll never go back and this isn't right and that's a hypocritical and this and this and this and this and this but I'm still here because something in me is greater than the humanity that surrounds it we all have we all walked in this door we've all been scarred we've all been hurt we've all been offended we've all been mistreated we've all been mishandled we've all been disrespected nobody more than the pastor probably but he's still here why because something in him is greater something in you is greater than all the offenses and all the backbiting and all the gossip and the lies told and the miscommunications is this okay misunderstandings he's got a big Shepherd so he can yank me if it's not okay but something in you is greater than that let me let me let me give you a promise from the scripture brother Merl you will be offended Jesus picks this up in Luke 17 right have you ever heard Jesus say the word impossible the first verse would say then said he unto his disciples it is impossible brother John it's impossible but that offenses will come he's promising them you will be offended but woe unto him through whom they come it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones take heed unto yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn to thee saying I Repent Thou shalt forgive him how many times seven and another gospel it says 7 time 70 woo brother con that that narrows it down right I could offend you seven times today and you'd have to forgive me if I asked for forgiveness there I mean 7 time 70 that's that's multiple times in an hour Sister Amy you ever been offended that many times multiple times in an hour I have to forgive him 7even time 70 if he ask for forgiveness I must forgive him Thou shalt forgive him and you know what the apostles said to the Lord increase our faith they work together they fellowship with each other they had to endure one another they were at the church potlucks with each other they knew each other they slept in the same tent a lot of times with each other out in the wilderness with each other and they knew each other's weaknesses and strengths and they knew Peter was in the group you want me to forgive that man seven times 70 Lord you've got to increase our faith and the Lord replies the Lord said if ye had Faith as a grain of a mustard seed you might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you so he's telling them you don't need more faith you need simple Faith to overcome the offenses that your brother is going to put in your lap to overcome the offenses against husband and wife overcome the offenses against best friend and not best friend and you don't need a supernatural Faith you need the simple Faith now they're looking at this situation thinking it's impossible brother Mitch for us to do this and he's telling them you don't need a great faith you need the same faith that you walked in this room with to overcome every offense that you will endure in this life now Jesus is Calling this out specifically he says you can say to this sick tree be thou removed by the root and cast into the sea so I just thought it was interesting the sycamine tree has some particularities about it brother Kobe the sycamine tree has the largest root system in the Middle East there's not a tree in the Middle East that has deeper Roots than the sycamine tree he's talking about bitterness and offense in the Brotherhood and he says this root is deeper than any other root out there but if you could have the faith as a grain of a mustard seed you could say to this tree and by the roots it'll be plugged up now these these guys know how deep the root is and they're looking at him thinking by The Roots can't we just cut it off on the top and grind it down no he said by the roots this tree will come out of the ground and be cast in the sea now I don't know there's any arborist in here but most of us are looking at that job thinking we're going to slap it off and get a stump grinder and get rid of it but he's not calling for just a surface level recovery here he's calling for by the root of the issue if you could have the faith as the grain of a mustard seed that root would must obey you and be plucked up and cast into the sea now this sic ofine tree has roots that they call the crab root or the cancer root because they dig and they dig and they dig and it's the deepest root system of any tree in the Middle East so he's not just saying any tree he's not just saying this mosquite bush or that bush but he's saying this sycamine tree the one with the deepest roots and has the deepest stronghold in the ground will be removed move by the root and cast into the sea if you could just have the simple Faith to stand on the word of God it doesn't take a great a great Shining Light coming down from heaven but I already sent my word to you that you have the faith already in you to perform it this sycamine tree Bears a fig as its fruit it's identical brother William to the Mulberry Tree it stands side by side of the mberry tree you can't tell the difference between the two but by the fruit of it the fruit of the SI ofite tree is bitter bitter bitter to The Taste unedible to The Taste and the Mulberry produces a great fig a mulberry bush and you can make pies and jams and but not the sycamine tree it's bitter it's bitter in every way it's bitter down to the sap that's within the tree and he's saying this tree can be removed if you just have the simple faith it doesn't take a great work up but the simple Faith to say unto to this tree be thou removed by the root totally eradicated totally destroyed by the root and cast into the sea now the other interesting thing about this tree is it's not pollinated by bees because it's too bitter and the fruit is too hard for the bee to get into the pollen so you know what it's it's pollinated by wasps the WASP attacks the Fig and it stings into the Fig and it's hard enough where it can reach the pollen of that and now you've got a wasp who's not a friend to anybody does anybody here collect wasps you got a you got a wasp Hive in your backyard that you get honey from no nobody's no I think everybody's probably on high alert when a wasp flies in the room everybody's aware of it a bumblebee flies in yeah but a wasp but yet we'll let a bitter Spirit I'm not talking about trees talking about how the devil Works through spirits in the church we'll let that bitter Spirit come and fly on our shoulder now if it was a literal red wasp we would never let that thing land on your shoulder cuz it only produces danger it only produces harm to you it only is going to produce bitterness but yet we'll let it move in and this wash has stung this fruit and it's taken this bitter pollen it's moved to this one moved to that one and moved to that one you see how quick it is for it to spread around and now this bitterness and now there's a root of bitterness in here you don't even know where it came from but there's a wasp carrying that pollen through the church now maybe not this church maybe don't have that issue but it comes in different waves well did you hear about so and so no I didn't what what happened oh well I shouldn't say bless God but this is what happened pray for them I can tell you if you're going to pray for them right it's a wasp it moves through through through simple things but it's a wasp and it will never come to any good it's only bitter it only produces bitterness it's not sweet like honey it's a bitter tree this tree the bark from this tree and the wood from this tree you know what it's used for caskets it's used to make caskets because he's telling the disciples bitterness the root of bitterness will only produce death but he's telling them if you could have the faith of the grain of a mustard seed I know everybody in here has probably seen that in Sunday school they pass out the Mustard Seed jar You' probably done it before in your ministry just pass out the Mustard Seed jar and everybody looks at that little thing and they say this and they're saying you want me to use this to get that out he's saying yeah because any level of god-given faith is greater than any oppression that you will face in this life any level you may not have much but what you have is enough to overcome every trial every enemy every Affliction every depression every anxiety every sickness the faith that you've been given is already enough they said increase our faith he said no I'm not going to increase your faith you need the simple Faith as a grain of a mustard seed to overcome this issue now we've been all put here together to be the same church why was it the pattern because they overcame one another they overcame Humanity they overcame hurts they overcame scars they overcame offenses they overcame disappointments I'm going to disappoint you I probably disappointed you in the in the 45 minutes I've been up here but you got to let it go brother Caleb didn't call me for my birthday and I'm offended at him now but I got to let it go I I'm a deacon at the church and you know people get offended about the strangest things I sometimes it just baffles my mind you get offended about that and somebody comes in and they've got a regular seat brother Austin that's their seat that's where they sit they come in the back and somebody's sitting in their seat I want you to move them no I'm not going to move them there's a lot of other seeds but you know what they do song leaders just say praise and raise your hands why because they're offended and they want you to know they're offended and they want the song leader to know they're offended they want the preacher to know they're offended they want everybody to know that they've been offended because they are justified in their offense and you know what they've done they have robbed themselves of a victory in that service ever changing their life ever touching them ever touching their kids anybody in their Pew will probably not be touched by the Lord because they have an offense that they are caring and they won't let it go and they say no I'm justified in this offense and not only that but they will have that mean mug on so hard that they will actually Rob Victory from the entire service and now your little offense that you are carrying has robbed somebody of their healing of a baptism of the Holy Ghost of a saving of a soul and of the miraculous taking place if we want the miraculous to take place in our midst then we've got to let go of something right we've got to get rid of something and if we're going to Bear our own offenses and say well I'm justified in this I'm not asking whether you're Justified I'm saying to let it go anyway I don't want to hear about your offense I don't want to hear about your sorrow or your hurt I'm saying let it go use the faith that you have to get over it in the best way sincere way possible I can say get over it we've got a Rapture to take We are rooting out for a Rapture we're not going to make a Rapture L we take the hoe out like brother brandom said and Grub out everything that's not of him grub out all unbelief grub out all skepticism grub out all bitterness grub out all all unbelief in our life all backbiting and backstabbing and this and that grub it out we've got a Rapture to take friends I want you to be there and I want you to be there and you want me to be there we all want to be there so let's get with the program as brother B would say root it out you've got the power to do it you may not feel like you have much but what you have is enough what do you have well I just have a few Loaves and a few fish it was enough put it in the hands of him and it's enough faith and it'll keep coming and it'll keep multiplying and it'll keep growing but what you already have that you're breathing with is enough Faith to overcome the offenses that you've faced in this life bless the Lord you've got enough already in you to become the perfect Church James would say it like this out of the same mouth preceded blessings and cursings my brethren these things ought not to be so does a fountain send forth the same the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the a fig tree my brethren bear Olive berries either a Vine uh figs so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh who is a wise man and IND du with knowledge among you let him show you out of a good conversation his works with meekness and wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure and Peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in the Peace of them that make peace that's quite a stature of a perfect man to live up to sir we can't have both bitter and sweet water coming out of the same mouth can't say well bless God I love that brother and then turn around and say something else but let me take this another stage deeper now now what about you and your offenses what about that Spirit of condemnation that rises up every time you go to worship and every time you get used by the Lord and you think no I got this Spirit of condemnation on me and I I can't let it go the same faith that you're breathing with the same simple faith and I can prove this by the scripture in Exodus the 15th chapter they come out of a great Victory right they're they're they're coming out of the Red Sea and brother and M they're on top of the world we've just seen every enemy we have destroyed under our feet and miam's got her tambourine she's dancing around you know what three verses later three we should have never left Egypt we should have just stayed there what happened they hit Bitter Water they come out of that victory walk right into bitter water and before you know it the great Victory they had I don't like Moses should have stayed back in Egypt was better off where I came from but the Lord spake unto Moses and said there's a tree right there by the bank take that tree and put it in that water and it'll become sweet it'll become the sweetest water that they've ever tasted brother benam comes down picks that up and he says you know what that tree was it was hup hup whatever you want to say hup a simple Faith right put simple faith in that and you'll overcome it and you'll recognize I'm still Victorious you'll recognize I'm still on top of it you'll recognize my Egyptians are still dead you'll recognize I'm still overcoming this thing just put a little simple faith in that and that bitter water will become sweet to The Taste you don't need a great faith you need the same simple Faith you've already got and apply it to the right thing you know what else hup was used for it was a paintbrush brother right a paintbrush for the blood and Joshua took that hiss up in there and painted it and painted it and painted it brother Kevin I don't think he stopped just at the door frame I think he went all the way across this front wall and all the way down the side wall I want to know I want everybody to know that I'm covered in this blood and use that simple Faith to apply the blood over his situation so the faith that you already have is the Revelation you need to apply the blood just apply it you've already got the brush you've already got the blood you've just got to apply it over the condition root it out root it out we've got a Rapture to take there's gifts in this room that we need there's people sitting here that we need to take a Rapture we're not complete without you and you're not complete without me so whatever it is holding us back let it go let it go and let God use it let it go and let God activate that that gift within you let it go and let God use you to your full potential I don't think any of us want to make it there and recognize that we had something within us that we didn't let go to God now listen a predestinated seed will be there no matter what but the but the devil can rob you of your Victory I'd rather get there Victorious I'd rather get there knowing who I am knowing what I've been called for knowing that I'm able to overcome every enemy not crawling in on my knees begging for something but we're not Beggars we're Sons and Daughters of God who have been given fullness and authority to ask him at his word and it shall be given unto you it's already yours it's already yours when I look at the message I don't read a message of I can't do it and I can't do this and I can't do that I read this message and I say I I've already can I already have I've already overcome I've already won on the other side I I've already taken him out his word not just I can and dos and don'ts but this is a message telling me that I have already overcome through he that is in me but somewhere along this journey we've picked up things and we put them in our pockets I'm I'm Whiting down here don't get worried Michael I know you got to work tomorrow but we picked up things yeah and they're weighing us down you know where we picked them up somewhere here somewhere this brother didn't Shake our hand or this this this quote was misused and now we're hurt by this or we were genuinely offended by somebody they really did US dirty and they took advantage of us and but you know how you get rid of it just like this here I picked up this you know how I get rid of it that's it you don't need more faith you need the simple faith that you already have let it go brother Brandon would say that the Avenues and the channels for the Holy Spirit to flow through are clogged up because we won't let it go I think it's time to let it go I think it's time to let go of our own ideas our own doctrines our own our own our own abuses let's not look at this word through abused lenses or abused and if this brother uses this quote well I I'm G I'm going to go this way with it well that's just an offended look at the gospel why not take it for what it says take the whole word and take in the whole word to yourself and say I want it all I don't want just this that makes me feel good and this that I understand I want all the word and I want every promise that's in that word and if you take every promise that's in that word it means you have to have fellowship with every everybody in this room God bless you buddy we want it all right we don't just want some of it we want it all we want all that the father has for us but it's really hard to run this race when you're lopsided carrying all these weights Justified justified in our offenses there were real real things that people hurt us with with real wounds that we're bearing but you got to let it go if we pick this up and we we're walking along life's journey with us and we get along that straight and narrow way we might just think it's just a little bit a little offense but we won't fit through the Gap Caleb we've got to let it go it's just that easy Let It Go we've got a Rapture to take amen we've got got a word to manifest we've got a body to change into what we need to do is let go of every offense every question every doubt I believe we're at the stage of the journey where there shouldn't be one doubt about whether this message is true or not now I don't need to come cycle through this entire message and break out my red volumes and break out my table and explain to you why this is this way and why this is that way we're way too far past that you know how you get rid of that you let go of the unbelief you let go of the question you let go of the skepticism you let go of the uncertainty within you and you and you say I want only the word and all the word and if my intellect doesn't match that my intellect is wrong I'm going to let it go now I don't have to explain everything to you and tell you why this is that way and tell you why this doesn't line up with your thinking on this or that you know how it goes you your guy will try to get you in a corner and say well you need to make this line up I don't have to make anything line up I'm a Believer it already lines up it if my thinking is this way then my thinking is wrong the word is right I think we're too far down the road to have any bit any hold back any any Rock within our pocket that we think well maybe there's a backup plan there is no plan B in a believer's life we don't have a backup plan I don't have a a a second choice here but you got to let go of all unbelief he's trying to move within you your channel your Avenue why not root it out it's the only way we're going to make it if we can root it out say Lord I've had enough of this I don't know about you friends but I've had enough of me yes sir you tell me what problem you fixed in your mind and it worked out just perfectly never happened but God Alone brother William I got brothers and I've argued with them but I've never argued with one of them as much as I've argued with myself how can two walk together lest they be agreed there's still some Humanity left in there there's still some of me left in there it's time to root it out you're a reflection of this word it's time to root out everything else I don't want it I don't want it I know this was simple thought tonight I I don't want any of me you don't want any of you trust me you don't want you to make your decisions and choose your direction the Lord already has your path light up wow you don't understand this I don't need to understand it Let It Go just drop it with the m you're carrying heavy weights you know how you get rid of them you just drop them you're playing basketball and you're playing with ankle weights and you can't dunk know what you do you take off your ankle weights you just drop them oh no you don't understand understand I've got so many complexes and inabilities and just let it go what does that have to do with the word well I've been offended by you don't know how deep this cut I've been offended I've been offended more times than I could count but I'm still here you've been offended but you're still here what does that have to do with the word Let It Go amen something has taken root in us that's not of us but we can say with the simple Faith cast into the sea let me ask what sea was it cast into where Glory was it the Sea of Galilee the Sea of God's forgetfulness never to be seen again I don't know about you Michael there's some things in my life that I would want to never be seen Again cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness by the root of the issue so you know those victories that we come up and we think oh well it's just a matter of time before we come back down not this time prise lord not this time this time is the final overthrow of this struggle I'm not going to have this temptation anymore I'm not going to have this desire anymore I'm not going to have this Affliction anymore but it will be defeated tonight by the faith in the word of God the simple faith of the hisop tree if it was up to us Kevin we'd have our ourselves that there's no way we're going to make it but we're using our own intellect I think it's time to say what the blood says about us the blood speaks better things that we could ever speak for ourselves brother Kobe or whoever the blood speaks better things I don't know who's playing the music but you can go ahead and come the blood speaks better things than we could say over ourselves Sister Amy if it was up to us we would we'd have ourselves painted in a corner somewhere we're never going to make because we know ourselves too well but the blood's not looking at that part of you cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness never to be brought up again never to be dug up again there's no root there for it to grow back there's no life source for it there but it's utterly destroyed and cast into the sea a perfect walk now we're going to have struggles we're going to have trials we're going to have mistakes trip ups but the Root's gone friends I've seen too much to to go back on this I know it works I know there are things in my life that I thought I would never get rid of now they're just a fake memory something that just just blows by Brother the John there's things in our life that we if we could go back down but we don't want that memory there's a memory far past that far beyond that before there ever was a drug or a a beer bottle or a a pain pill or a a a a a a website before there was any of that there was another you where were you God took a perfect picture of you before there was a scar before there was a hurt before before there was a sorrow there's a perfect you and that's what the blood's looking at why don't we let the blood speak over us say I say to I I want I want the blood to speak what it really thinks about me it says I'm free it says I'm Justified it says that I never did it in the first place it says that I'm making a Rapture it says that I've got another body the blood says that I'm going to fulfill this word and be the Fulfillment of this age the blood has already spoken it over me I I think it's time we use our simple faith and take what the blood says about us I'm forgiven Hallelujah you know how easy it is you just let it go it takes an action of Faith right brother B would teach that faith in action you just let it [Music] go little bitterness little offense we've all got them you know what happens brother Kevin you'll find you're a lot lighter and the more you let go the lighter you get and the more you release the Freer you get and the more you you take the shackles off the more liberated you become and you wonder how somebody can just Worship in total Liberty and worship in total freedom it's because they've let go and they Saidi going to do I'm going to I'm going to be who God says I am God says I'm chosen God says I'm spotless God says I'm sinless I never did it in the first place Hallelujah let the blood speak for us Amen brother Kobe you know that song um gratitude all my words fall short L I've got nothing new how could I express all my gratitude I could sing these songs as I often do every song must end and you never do so

it takes an action it takes an action for Faith to move brother we got a trash can back there there a trash can back there somewhere is this all right maybe we picked something up down the road we just been carrying it a little bit too long there comes a point where we've got to let it go maybe you picked up an offense somewhere bitterness maybe it's some kind of unbelief maybe it's some kind of doubt in the word maybe you've been struggling about this oh I don't I don't know if the message is 100% I don't know if I'm really why not tonight let it [Music] go there's nothing physical you could throw away but sometimes it just takes an action as brother Brandon would throw a rock into the sky and it would be the opening of our age sometimes it just takes an action I don't about you friends but if something's come to your heart tonight and you think I've been carrying this way too long why don't you throw it in the trash you just throw it away never to be seen again you know what
