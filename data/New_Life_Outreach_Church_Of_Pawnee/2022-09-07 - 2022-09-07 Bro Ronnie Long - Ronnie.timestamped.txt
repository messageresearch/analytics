[58:42] bibles the book of romans the 10th
[58:44] chapter
[58:49] i uh just were
[58:53] i didn't really
[58:55] have a title but i was just thinking
[58:56] about it back there and
[58:58] for a few minutes we'll talk about
[59:00] removing all doubt
[59:02] we're moving all down
[59:04] romans the 10th chapter we'll start at
[59:07] the eighth verse but what sayeth it
[59:09] the word is nighty even in thy mouth and
[59:12] in thy heart
[59:13] that is the word of faith which we
[59:15] preach
[59:16] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[59:18] mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe
[59:20] in thine heart god hath raised him from
[59:22] the dead
[59:23] thou shalt be saved for with a heart man
[59:25] believeth unto righteousness and with
[59:27] the mouth
[59:28] confession is made unto salvation for
[59:31] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[59:34] on him shall not be
[59:36] ashamed amen may god bless his word he
[59:39] may be seated tonight
[59:41] i believe that we are
[59:44] we are i know it's been happening here
[59:46] in oklahoma maybe i haven't talked to
[59:47] you personally but i know that the the
[59:50] bride's revival is stronger than it's
[59:51] ever been i know that you're feeling god
[59:54] bless y'all from arizona
[59:56] the bride's revival is stronger than
[59:58] it's ever been it's it's performing what
[1:00:00] it promised it would perform it's doing
[1:00:02] what it promised it would do and we're
[1:00:04] living in the age that we all thought we
[1:00:06] would live in but now we're here so we
[1:00:09] recognize that we're in the age of the
[1:00:11] bride's revival we're not in another age
[1:00:13] or an age gone by but we're in the right
[1:00:15] age at the right time for a rapture i
[1:00:18] believe that we've all recognized it
[1:00:20] we've all we've all seen it we've all
[1:00:22] felt it we all feel the change in the
[1:00:24] atmosphere we feel the change in the air
[1:00:26] that this is not just the same word that
[1:00:28] we believe 15 years ago or 20 years ago
[1:00:30] but there's another dispensation
[1:00:33] on the earth today that we are coming
[1:00:35] under that anointing of i believe that
[1:00:36] we recognize as the bride of christ that
[1:00:39] we're no longer living in some in some
[1:00:42] old age gone by but we are living in the
[1:00:45] very cutting edge word of god not that
[1:00:47] we could get deeper to make it
[1:00:48] complicated but that is manifesting what
[1:00:51] promised it would manifest
[1:00:53] that's the age we're living in we're not
[1:00:55] living in an age where we wish we could
[1:00:57] and we might get there or we can believe
[1:01:00] unto what there is no unto that we can
[1:01:02] believe it's eternal what we're what
[1:01:04] we're facing right now is an eternal
[1:01:06] word we're not believing on just to to
[1:01:09] unto the just shall live by faith but
[1:01:11] we're believing unto a body change
[1:01:14] so this guy is literally the limit for
[1:01:16] us in his time i believe we're
[1:01:18] recognizing that we're feeling it we're
[1:01:19] we're feeling the charge of the hour the
[1:01:21] anointing that's in the air the the word
[1:01:24] that's just coming forth we recognizing
[1:01:27] what time we're living in
[1:01:29] in the scripture jesus would come down
[1:01:31] off the mountain after being tempted and
[1:01:33] he would go to the synagogue and he
[1:01:35] would have them open a book and he would
[1:01:36] identify exactly where they were at at
[1:01:40] that time in prophecy he flipped right
[1:01:42] to the part of the prophecy and he said
[1:01:44] right now we're walking in this
[1:01:46] scripture
[1:01:48] i believe we have the same sure word in
[1:01:50] our time that we can flip back in
[1:01:52] prophecy and say right now we are
[1:01:55] walking in this scripture and in this
[1:01:58] day this scripture is being fulfilled in
[1:02:01] your ears not somebody else's not
[1:02:03] another age not another time but it's
[1:02:06] being fulfilled in your ears
[1:02:08] we have a perfect prophetic word to a
[1:02:11] perfect prophetic people in a perfect
[1:02:13] prophetic age we're recognizing where we
[1:02:16] are at in this time
[1:02:18] it's not another time where we wish we
[1:02:20] could or we might have enough faith but
[1:02:22] this is the finishing age
[1:02:24] we are not we're not building a wall
[1:02:26] anymore but we're turning corners faster
[1:02:28] than we can get the blocks up we're
[1:02:30] turning corners after corners after you
[1:02:32] know if you're building a pyramid it
[1:02:33] starts and it's a long wall for a while
[1:02:37] and then you turn and it gets a little
[1:02:38] shorter and the next time the walls look
[1:02:40] shorter but we're at the top of the
[1:02:42] pyramid we are turning corners in the
[1:02:44] word faster than men before us ever even
[1:02:47] thought that they could get to that part
[1:02:48] in the word and it's coming to us
[1:02:50] naturally because we're predestinated to
[1:02:53] do that work
[1:02:55] that's what we've been called for that's
[1:02:57] what we've been purposed for if we don't
[1:02:59] if not here but what are we doing here
[1:03:01] if we don't have a purpose
[1:03:02] but our purpose here is to fulfill the
[1:03:05] end time prophetic word
[1:03:08] so if we're to fulfill the end time
[1:03:10] prophetic word then we must manifest
[1:03:12] what that end time prophet preached to a
[1:03:15] people that is us walking in prophecy i
[1:03:18] know we're in agreement right
[1:03:20] but tonight we want to remove all doubt
[1:03:22] that i'm talking about you we want to
[1:03:24] remove all doubt that this message is
[1:03:27] the vindicated word of the hour we're
[1:03:29] not looking for something else or
[1:03:31] another resource or a voice but this is
[1:03:34] the final voice this is what we are
[1:03:36] walking under and we have a word in this
[1:03:39] hour to say
[1:03:42] why would god give us the final word if
[1:03:44] it was gonna have so much power in it
[1:03:46] that it would set the devil into the
[1:03:47] lake of fire i believe we have a more
[1:03:50] sure word in this tower than any age
[1:03:52] come before us because we're walking in
[1:03:56] prophecy there's been more prophecy
[1:03:59] about you as the end time people than
[1:04:01] any other people gone before you
[1:04:04] to think about it that that you would
[1:04:05] look there in the bible and think about
[1:04:07] those great and mighty warriors that
[1:04:08] were walking in their prophecy
[1:04:10] they they're walking in their time
[1:04:13] but you are walking in a greater word of
[1:04:15] prophecy
[1:04:16] there's been more prophesied about you
[1:04:18] as the second coming of christ in a body
[1:04:23] than there ever was before but we've got
[1:04:24] to recognize
[1:04:26] where are we living in
[1:04:28] what season are we under
[1:04:30] what age are we under
[1:04:31] i'm not under the age of a man now you
[1:04:33] can say that i'm in a pentecostal age
[1:04:35] but you got me missed
[1:04:37] we're in another age
[1:04:39] this is not a pentecostal age nor is it
[1:04:42] a lutheran age nor is it a wesleyan age
[1:04:45] we are living in a bright age fulfilling
[1:04:47] a bride's word
[1:04:49] to to a prophetic class of people
[1:04:53] not us then who
[1:04:55] if not you tonight then who else is
[1:04:57] going to fulfill it but you know as well
[1:04:59] as i do there's something inside of you
[1:05:01] that tells you that you are the one that
[1:05:04] is going to fulfill it i don't have to
[1:05:06] tell you that i don't have to identify
[1:05:08] you as that but you know within yourself
[1:05:10] that there's a greater purpose within
[1:05:12] you than you can express out of these
[1:05:14] lips that you can express out of this
[1:05:16] life there's a greater purpose that's
[1:05:18] already in you you know it's there it's
[1:05:20] what brought you here tonight it's what
[1:05:23] caused you brothers over there to start
[1:05:24] driving at one o'clock in the morning
[1:05:26] come over here there's something in you
[1:05:27] that pulls you
[1:05:29] to the promise of the hour this is what
[1:05:32] we live for
[1:05:33] we do not live to go to the fair we do
[1:05:36] not live to go
[1:05:37] on a vacation so we live to fulfill the
[1:05:40] promise of the hour because that is what
[1:05:43] god placed us here to do
[1:05:46] to walk in perfect promise but
[1:05:48] recognizing that it's now is the time
[1:05:51] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:05:54] your ears
[1:05:56] if you're looking for a a revival to
[1:05:58] come you better you better open your
[1:06:00] eyes because it's already come
[1:06:03] he's already here
[1:06:05] elijah must first come elijah has
[1:06:07] already come the revival has already
[1:06:10] come it's striking the earth it's
[1:06:12] striking hearts it's it's igniting faith
[1:06:15] of the people
[1:06:17] we should be the most encouraged people
[1:06:19] on the face of the earth yet the devil
[1:06:21] sometimes gets us so beaten backwards
[1:06:24] that we end up looking like the most
[1:06:25] gloomiest people on the face of the
[1:06:26] earth
[1:06:28] but if we recognize the day that we're
[1:06:30] living in is the fulfillment of all
[1:06:33] things
[1:06:35] all things
[1:06:36] what season are you living in
[1:06:41] where where do you think we're at under
[1:06:43] this under this
[1:06:44] tree you've got to recognize it for
[1:06:47] yourself brother bran would say the time
[1:06:49] is at hand
[1:06:51] now the time was not at hand previously
[1:06:55] in the wisdom economy of the mighty
[1:06:56] revelation of god could not come forth
[1:06:59] to thus we immediately learned principle
[1:07:02] sorry i'm not great with words but
[1:07:04] the revelation of god for each age can
[1:07:07] come in that age only
[1:07:10] and at a specific time
[1:07:13] look at the history of israel the
[1:07:14] revelation of god did moses come only at
[1:07:17] a specific time of history and even more
[1:07:20] specifically it came as the people cried
[1:07:22] unto god
[1:07:24] jesus himself came at the fullness of
[1:07:25] time he being the complete revelation of
[1:07:27] the godhead in in this age
[1:07:30] the revelation of god will come in its
[1:07:33] due time
[1:07:35] it will not falter
[1:07:37] somebody say it will not falter
[1:07:40] due time
[1:07:42] neither will it be premature
[1:07:46] think on this and heed it well for we
[1:07:48] are in the end time
[1:07:50] today
[1:07:52] we have more prophecy backing us up
[1:07:58] then even when christ was here the first
[1:08:00] time walking in jews
[1:08:02] then even when he was here fulfilling
[1:08:04] those prophecies there's more prophecy
[1:08:06] about us in this age that christ is
[1:08:09] dwelling in us fulfilling that prophecy
[1:08:12] it's in due time
[1:08:14] it was not to happen 10 years ago even
[1:08:16] though we preached as hard as we could
[1:08:18] it was not to happen 10 years ago it was
[1:08:21] not to happen 30 years ago we're under
[1:08:23] another dispensation but now we are in
[1:08:26] the end time it will not be premature
[1:08:29] but it will come in its due time
[1:08:32] remember we say due time
[1:08:34] i believe we're in due time we've got to
[1:08:36] remove all hindrances all doubt that we
[1:08:39] are living in the rapture season
[1:08:42] this is not a time to be mellow or
[1:08:44] gloomy or pull back or retreat but we
[1:08:47] are living the time of going forward in
[1:08:49] the word of prophecy to take the land
[1:08:52] that's already been given to us
[1:08:54] a joshua generation fulfilling that
[1:08:56] which moses told him he would fulfill to
[1:08:59] walk forward in faith and take the land
[1:09:02] that was already given to him
[1:09:04] we're not walking a mess or taking
[1:09:06] something that's not ours but it has
[1:09:07] already told us it's yours
[1:09:10] go ahead and take it
[1:09:12] now if i if i threw this up here and i
[1:09:14] said that's yours you go ahead and take
[1:09:15] it whose fault is it that you don't have
[1:09:17] it
[1:09:20] sometimes we lack the faith to be able
[1:09:22] just to walk up here and grab this and
[1:09:24] say it's mine
[1:09:26] i take it
[1:09:27] but god's already given you everything
[1:09:29] that you have need of you just gotta
[1:09:31] walk forward in faith and say i take it
[1:09:34] i take it the reason why we have doubt
[1:09:37] circling in our camps is because people
[1:09:39] have not reached out enough in faith and
[1:09:41] taken what's already been given to them
[1:09:45] i'm not doubting whom i believed in i
[1:09:47] know who i met
[1:09:49] i didn't meet a man i didn't need a
[1:09:51] doctrine i didn't meet a pastor i met
[1:09:54] jesus christ the flesh how could i doubt
[1:09:57] who i met
[1:09:58] how could i doubt what i've received but
[1:10:01] i know
[1:10:02] i have a relationship with him
[1:10:05] though i fail him i still know
[1:10:08] though i fall away i still know though
[1:10:10] he slayed me i still know
[1:10:13] who i'm at
[1:10:14] we've got to remove all doubt out of our
[1:10:17] mind that this is the absolute truth of
[1:10:19] the hour
[1:10:20] we cannot let that demon linger any
[1:10:22] longer
[1:10:24] if i have one thing to fulfill in my
[1:10:25] life is to eradicate the demon of doubt
[1:10:28] circling in the message
[1:10:31] i don't know who you met but i met
[1:10:32] christ
[1:10:34] i don't know what season you're living
[1:10:35] under but i'm living under the season of
[1:10:37] a rapture
[1:10:38] the season of body change
[1:10:41] the season that there won't be a taste
[1:10:43] of death there won't be an experience of
[1:10:45] of a death or a pain crossing over but
[1:10:47] we'll be caught up
[1:10:50] i believe this
[1:10:53] i believe that i'll just get so caught
[1:10:55] up one day my body will get a little
[1:10:57] lighter i know we've experienced just
[1:10:59] glimpses of it here and there we get
[1:11:00] caught up for the anointing and the
[1:11:02] hours coming forth and the dispensation
[1:11:05] is getting greater we feel a little bit
[1:11:06] caught up one of these days it's going
[1:11:08] to be just like that
[1:11:12] you can then call me a pentecostal you
[1:11:14] can call me a radical you can call me
[1:11:16] fanatic but you're gonna call me bye
[1:11:19] you're gonna say hey where'd it go
[1:11:21] cause one of these days it's gonna
[1:11:23] ignite and we're gone
[1:11:30] we're not looking back all right
[1:11:32] but we've already been procrastinated to
[1:11:35] receive it in this hour
[1:11:38] i know how the devil works he'll come
[1:11:40] right there and talk to you and say yeah
[1:11:42] he's talking to the person right next to
[1:11:43] you
[1:11:44] that person right next to you they're
[1:11:46] going to go in the rapture but it's not
[1:11:47] for you
[1:11:48] we need to remove all doubt tonight
[1:11:51] we need to remove all that imagine what
[1:11:53] this meeting could be this weekend if we
[1:11:55] tonight removed all doubt that we are
[1:11:57] walking in the perfect order of god
[1:12:00] we are walking in perfect truth
[1:12:02] we got to remove the doubt
[1:12:07] we know
[1:12:09] we know the word
[1:12:10] yeah
[1:12:11] we've heard it
[1:12:12] some of our sunday school kids have
[1:12:14] heard more word than them bible scholars
[1:12:16] spent their entire lives pouring into
[1:12:18] the bible we've heard the word
[1:12:21] we've been predestinated to receive it
[1:12:24] we've been we have the resources
[1:12:26] predestinated in us for a body change
[1:12:29] every element it takes i don't know i'm
[1:12:31] not a doctor but daryl what might take
[1:12:33] to change your body but i know that you
[1:12:35] already have it in you i know that god
[1:12:37] already placed those elements within
[1:12:39] these people in this hour that can
[1:12:41] receive a body change it's predestinated
[1:12:45] you're not asking for something that's
[1:12:47] not yours but it's your time it's your
[1:12:49] season under the sun we are coming to
[1:12:52] maturity
[1:12:54] i believe the sun's up
[1:12:56] i believe we're walking under a harvest
[1:12:58] time sun we're not walking under a
[1:13:00] premature sun but this is the harvest
[1:13:03] time this is when the seed is known for
[1:13:06] the fruit that it is
[1:13:08] what fruit are you yeah
[1:13:11] you're somebody's fruit
[1:13:14] i believe we're the fruit at the top of
[1:13:15] the tree
[1:13:31] that right inspiration is the time that
[1:13:33] comes to life
[1:13:35] you know that that prophecy of isaiah
[1:13:37] had been laying there in the scripture
[1:13:39] all those years yeah 800 something years
[1:13:41] that prophecy had been laying writing
[1:13:43] that scripture but after he came off the
[1:13:46] mountain and he knew what time he was
[1:13:48] walking and he said right now is this
[1:13:51] scripture fulfilled in your ears it had
[1:13:53] been laying there waiting for the time
[1:13:55] to come when it would be manifested
[1:13:58] when he would walk in that prophecy he
[1:14:00] would say hey i'm walking in a prophecy
[1:14:01] that isaiah's talked about 800 and
[1:14:04] something years ago
[1:14:05] but you know we have more prophecy about
[1:14:07] us in this hour
[1:14:10] that we can go back through a prophetic
[1:14:11] word through a perfect vindicated
[1:14:14] prophet and recognized we are walking in
[1:14:16] the hour that he told us we were walking
[1:14:20] it's not coming
[1:14:21] it's here
[1:14:22] [Applause]
[1:14:25] but you've already been predestinated
[1:14:28] it's already in you yeah i think that's
[1:14:31] the biggest the biggest devil of out
[1:14:33] gets in there it says it's not for you
[1:14:35] it's for your neighbor
[1:14:37] turn your neighbor and say it's for me
[1:14:40] there you go
[1:14:43] that was not for your neighbor it's for
[1:14:44] you
[1:14:45] it's for me
[1:14:49] you gotta recognize you're walking under
[1:14:52] the light
[1:14:53] you can't rely on your pastor to walk
[1:14:55] into the light or your deacon or your or
[1:14:57] your preacher your favorite evangelist
[1:14:59] or your favorite televangelist or your
[1:15:02] favorite song leader you've got to
[1:15:03] recognize you're walking under the light
[1:15:06] yourself
[1:15:08] this is an individual affair
[1:15:10] to recognize i am walking under this
[1:15:13] perfect light
[1:15:14] recognizing your day and its message
[1:15:17] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:15:21] don't worry about whether you'll have it
[1:15:23] you'll have it he already put it in you
[1:15:26] don't worry about whether you'll be able
[1:15:27] to make it you'll make it he already put
[1:15:30] it in you you think about that woman
[1:15:32] that recognized christ in her hour and
[1:15:34] there she walks through the house of
[1:15:36] critics
[1:15:37] i believe as i believe you're gonna have
[1:15:38] to walk through the house of critics and
[1:15:40] she's dragging her condemnation in her
[1:15:42] weight with her and she's walking
[1:15:44] through simon's house but she's
[1:15:46] recognized christ is in that room
[1:15:49] she doesn't know what she's gonna do
[1:15:51] when she gets there all she knows is
[1:15:52] she's got to praise him
[1:15:54] she's got to fulfill brother brown said
[1:15:56] she knew she had a service to do for him
[1:15:59] but she had nothing to do it with
[1:16:01] you ever feel like that
[1:16:03] don't worry about it it'll be there when
[1:16:05] you get there now she approaches him and
[1:16:08] as she has her oil brother brown says
[1:16:11] god furnish the water and the towels
[1:16:14] don't worry about whether you have the
[1:16:16] faith it'll be there when you get there
[1:16:18] just don't doubt your source
[1:16:20] recognize your source is the perfect
[1:16:23] source
[1:16:24] not looking for something else just walk
[1:16:26] in face it'll be there when you get
[1:16:29] there
[1:16:31] she didn't know she had the water in the
[1:16:33] towel
[1:16:35] she didn't recognize it but at that
[1:16:37] moment she was walking in prophecy
[1:16:39] she was fulfilling what god had seen in
[1:16:42] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:16:44] world she was walking a perfect prophecy
[1:16:47] i believe that's us we may not feel like
[1:16:49] we have it but don't doubt where you're
[1:16:51] at in this season
[1:16:53] this is a time
[1:16:55] you can talk to an atheist agnostic you
[1:16:57] can talk to everyone they recognize this
[1:16:59] thing's coming to an end this cosmos is
[1:17:03] revolving to an end
[1:17:04] how much more we the bread of christ
[1:17:06] should know this thing is coming to an
[1:17:09] end
[1:17:10] not waiting for something don't wait for
[1:17:12] another another event to happen it could
[1:17:14] be the last event
[1:17:17] brother bam said but she went upon her
[1:17:19] inspiration
[1:17:21] she went on the inspiration of the hour
[1:17:24] what is our inspiration of the hour
[1:17:27] the message tells us
[1:17:29] that there are some standing here
[1:17:33] that shall not taste of death but shall
[1:17:36] be cut up raptured to me in the air why
[1:17:38] do we believe this if it doesn't fulfill
[1:17:40] what it says but i can testify to you
[1:17:42] that this message works
[1:17:45] this message works when it says it'll
[1:17:47] work it'll work when somebody is a good
[1:17:49] old hypocrite sitting on the pew don't
[1:17:50] come and change that life it'll work for
[1:17:53] a backward sinner or a out on the
[1:17:55] street it'll work in that life
[1:17:57] it'll work for a drunk or a secret
[1:17:59] sinner hiding in the church and work in
[1:18:01] that life the fruit of it testifies of
[1:18:04] what it is it works
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:07] it works
[1:18:10] look at this front row right here it
[1:18:11] works
[1:18:12] where'd you all come from it works the
[1:18:15] message works
[1:18:17] look at this front row over here where'd
[1:18:18] they come from it works and working a
[1:18:21] young man that recognizes this is the
[1:18:23] truth of the hour it works you have to
[1:18:26] try the message doesn't work for you
[1:18:28] just get under the leadership of the
[1:18:31] word of the hour
[1:18:32] it's not about whether you try it's
[1:18:34] about whether you recognize the
[1:18:35] authority you're placed under
[1:18:38] remove the doubt he's already done it
[1:18:41] just follow the leadership of the hour
[1:18:44] it works
[1:18:46] remember brother branham would talk
[1:18:47] about demon shakira being an oil man
[1:18:49] right
[1:18:50] and he wanted to go find some oil and he
[1:18:52] asked brother branham he said yeah i had
[1:18:54] a vision there's the main oil well down
[1:18:55] there in kentucky right
[1:18:59] and he says well would you tell us right
[1:19:00] where it says no it's not for commercial
[1:19:02] use yeah and then immediately brother
[1:19:04] bran goes into motive and objective
[1:19:06] you see you might start a church or you
[1:19:08] might start a moon you might start a
[1:19:09] following unto yourself but your motive
[1:19:12] injective has got to be correct
[1:19:15] and so they go out and and they go and
[1:19:17] search the soil they know around about
[1:19:19] where it's at right and they pack up all
[1:19:21] their all their stuff from i think he
[1:19:23] was based in albuquerque
[1:19:26] he packs about his gear and all his all
[1:19:28] his equipment he has a few partners and
[1:19:30] they get out there and they find oil
[1:19:31] right near where brother branham said
[1:19:34] notice he said right near
[1:19:36] where i said right and they begin to
[1:19:38] drill down and the first thing you know
[1:19:40] they strike oil
[1:19:41] they're going to pump it out oh we've
[1:19:42] got oil and then you get a little bit of
[1:19:44] money coming and then they begin to
[1:19:45] bicker amongst themselves and you find
[1:19:47] that their mode of injective weren't
[1:19:48] what they said it was
[1:19:50] it was to build their own kingdom so
[1:19:52] they didn't have the right objective to
[1:19:54] build the kingdom for god so god never
[1:19:57] blessed it
[1:19:58] but they got oil
[1:20:00] because they were right near where
[1:20:02] brother brennam said that oil was
[1:20:05] you see they got really close to the
[1:20:07] truth
[1:20:08] they got right up next to the truth and
[1:20:10] they drew that well and the first place
[1:20:12] they found water or oil they stopped
[1:20:18] and then they denominated
[1:20:20] and then they built a kingdom unto
[1:20:21] themselves and then see they had a
[1:20:23] little bit of life in there it was the
[1:20:24] real genuine oil that was coming up but
[1:20:27] it wasn't the main source
[1:20:29] it was the sublet it was it was a
[1:20:31] tributary off of that main source then
[1:20:33] we could drill down and begin to drill
[1:20:34] wells over here and over there and you
[1:20:36] know what after a while those wells
[1:20:38] begin to dry up
[1:20:40] how many times have we seen that
[1:20:42] a man get a little gift in his life he
[1:20:44] started working unto himself and then a
[1:20:46] little give it up just to give it a
[1:20:47] little while and that oil will begin to
[1:20:49] dry up because he's not tapped into the
[1:20:52] main source
[1:20:53] he's not tapped into that fountain that
[1:20:56] keeps flowing he's stepped into his own
[1:20:58] source
[1:20:59] and god knew it was going to happen so
[1:21:01] he allowed him to tap into part of that
[1:21:03] life
[1:21:05] but you see how the main source begins
[1:21:07] to pop
[1:21:09] those little tributaries begin to
[1:21:10] withdraw
[1:21:12] those arms or branches as it were begin
[1:21:14] to withdraw
[1:21:16] the oil that they have in them
[1:21:18] and the only place that you will find
[1:21:20] oil in those times is the main vein of
[1:21:23] where that oil is
[1:21:25] but the ramp says they went out there
[1:21:27] and they drilled themselves holes and
[1:21:28] they had holes on for the driver you're
[1:21:30] a oil worker you know you could drill a
[1:21:32] hole and also it ends up dry one day
[1:21:35] it's done cap it
[1:21:37] it's over
[1:21:38] millions lost
[1:21:40] millions lost
[1:21:41] bankrupt forsaken look at brother
[1:21:44] branham let us over here
[1:21:45] see how the devil works
[1:21:47] brother branham never let him there he
[1:21:49] said there's the main source there but
[1:21:51] they didn't follow it through they got
[1:21:53] real close and then when their oil well
[1:21:55] dried up they wanted to blame it on the
[1:21:57] prophet and say hey our oil well dried
[1:21:59] up you must be a false prophet
[1:22:01] brother brown says so the prophecy could
[1:22:03] remain true not more than a hundred
[1:22:06] yards from where they dug their first
[1:22:08] hole they found the main source
[1:22:11] that's never run dry to this day the
[1:22:13] main source of that oil you see when you
[1:22:15] recognize the main inspiration of this
[1:22:17] word is not a man it's not it's not a
[1:22:20] whim it's not a false wind it's the
[1:22:23] voice to god in our hour it's the main
[1:22:25] source
[1:22:27] i believe we tapped into it i believe
[1:22:29] we've tapped into that main source i
[1:22:31] believe that's where the oil
[1:22:33] for the wise virgin is coming from she's
[1:22:36] tapped into another source she doesn't
[1:22:38] have to go out and get it brother brown
[1:22:40] says it pumped eleven hundred barrels uh
[1:22:43] a a half day
[1:22:45] eleven hundred barrels of oil in half
[1:22:47] day showing that if you come in here
[1:22:48] tonight and your center off the street
[1:22:50] you're going to get the same pain as i
[1:22:53] get that i've been serving the lord for
[1:22:54] 20 years because it's vindication of
[1:22:57] where we're at in this time
[1:22:59] this is the end time hour
[1:23:02] i believe we're speaking to some 11th
[1:23:04] hour workers it could be your your
[1:23:06] prodigal it could be somebody you work
[1:23:07] with but we're speaking to 11th hour
[1:23:09] work
[1:23:10] 11 hour workers in this hour
[1:23:14] they'll get the same pay
[1:23:16] thank god
[1:23:18] brother random calls them little pawns
[1:23:20] little denominational ponds you see
[1:23:21] where man has stopped at the first place
[1:23:24] they found life
[1:23:26] just like lot did
[1:23:27] stop at the first place that looks good
[1:23:29] to you
[1:23:30] but that's not the main source
[1:23:33] we got to recognize we're tapped into
[1:23:35] the real thing we're tapped into the
[1:23:37] real source
[1:23:38] if we've somehow caught up dry we've got
[1:23:40] to look back at this and say we've got
[1:23:42] to tap in again we got to get back to
[1:23:44] that main source
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:48] we've got to recognize where we're at
[1:23:50] the bible says blow out the logs of
[1:23:52] tradition he said bore holes in the
[1:23:54] ground dig them out set dynamite blow
[1:23:56] down keep blowing the shafts go down
[1:23:58] till we found till we find the main vein
[1:24:02] now that's what we call prospecting
[1:24:05] and tonight we're trying to take the
[1:24:07] word of god and use it by the power of
[1:24:09] the holy spirit to blow all the
[1:24:11] indifference and doubts away from us all
[1:24:13] those little light fluffy things that
[1:24:15] just doesn't have any foundation doesn't
[1:24:18] have any weight in our life we want to
[1:24:20] blow it all away so we can find this
[1:24:23] glorious vein
[1:24:24] that vein is christ
[1:24:28] you'll find that if you actually take
[1:24:30] the word to the devil all those things
[1:24:32] that you find as mountains in your life
[1:24:35] are actually just little light fluffy
[1:24:37] things
[1:24:39] to think that a little light fluffy
[1:24:41] thing would keep you from your ultimate
[1:24:43] victory would keep you from your healing
[1:24:45] but keep you from your deliverance if
[1:24:47] you just apply the word to it you'll
[1:24:49] find out that little light fluffy thing
[1:24:54] it can't stand in the presence of this
[1:24:55] word
[1:24:56] god bless you brother mitch good to see
[1:24:58] you
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:00] finding the new friends and old friends
[1:25:03] but we're finding that we are we are
[1:25:05] promised to receive it
[1:25:08] it's ours to have
[1:25:09] it's just as easy if i said hey this is
[1:25:11] yours
[1:25:14] come and take it
[1:25:15] this is yours that healing you're
[1:25:17] looking for it's already yours
[1:25:20] right that was the first sign
[1:25:22] remember moses was given two signs he
[1:25:25] said how will you how will they believe
[1:25:26] me they know i'm just a man how will
[1:25:28] they believe that i've met the i am he
[1:25:30] said i'll give you two signs so that
[1:25:31] israel might know that you met me
[1:25:34] he didn't care about the critics he knew
[1:25:35] the critics were going to doubt him but
[1:25:37] the two signs were to prove to israel
[1:25:39] that they me that he met him
[1:25:41] but i believe we're living under another
[1:25:43] son
[1:25:44] i believe we're living under another
[1:25:46] dispensation where joshua was already
[1:25:48] given the commandments of how to take
[1:25:50] the land
[1:25:51] don't let the words of moses depart from
[1:25:53] your
[1:25:54] mouth
[1:25:56] if you say
[1:25:58] don't let the words apart from your
[1:26:01] mouth
[1:26:02] if you say
[1:26:04] and joshua finds the inspiration on the
[1:26:06] hour to take the lamp
[1:26:09] and we look at joshua in the scripture
[1:26:10] figure what a courageous man if we are
[1:26:12] not equally as brave as joshua we will
[1:26:15] never make this rapture we've got to
[1:26:17] have the faith of joshua to recognize
[1:26:19] that's my land
[1:26:21] that's my promise that's right belong
[1:26:24] i'm going to take it you see there's a
[1:26:26] big difference between a real believer
[1:26:27] and a make-believer
[1:26:29] they'll get right up to the line and
[1:26:30] that maybe believer will see giants
[1:26:33] you'll just see lots of giants over
[1:26:35] there that land but to a joshua or a
[1:26:36] caleb
[1:26:38] all i see is grapes
[1:26:40] all i see is promises all i see is
[1:26:43] vindication as i see is my family saved
[1:26:46] all i see is being filled with the holy
[1:26:48] ghost all i see is walking in victory
[1:26:51] they don't take the time to stop and
[1:26:53] look at the giants
[1:26:56] he already knew the giants were subject
[1:26:58] unto him you just walk in the land and
[1:27:00] i'll bless you
[1:27:01] see the problem is we try to walk in the
[1:27:03] land without having the fullness of the
[1:27:05] holy ghost
[1:27:07] is that right
[1:27:09] and then the devil mixes us up and then
[1:27:11] we we run back with our tail between our
[1:27:13] legs you've got to be in the land
[1:27:15] israel was never blessed till they were
[1:27:17] in their land and let me say you'll
[1:27:19] never be blessed until you make a full
[1:27:21] surrender and come under the anointing
[1:27:23] of this word and the work is done for
[1:27:25] you then
[1:27:26] it's not about how much you can crawl or
[1:27:28] wiggle or carry across you've already
[1:27:30] come subject under the word and the word
[1:27:33] is what has the power within it
[1:27:37] remember the badge
[1:27:39] that man couldn't stop a truck for that
[1:27:41] badge could because the authority was in
[1:27:44] the batch let me say the authority is in
[1:27:48] the message if we get sideways we wonder
[1:27:50] why we've got to get back to the real
[1:27:52] world we've got to get back to the pure
[1:27:54] word of god and recognize that's where
[1:27:56] the power lays
[1:27:58] it's not and if i think i can or some
[1:28:01] kind of psychological mind battle you've
[1:28:03] got to recognize the power is in the
[1:28:05] word
[1:28:07] that's what fixes problems
[1:28:10] i can't come sit down with you and talk
[1:28:12] you through a situation but by the power
[1:28:15] of the word it will fix the problem how
[1:28:18] many times have we witnessed it happen
[1:28:20] by the power of the word it fixes the
[1:28:22] problem every time
[1:28:25] don't worry it is for you you've been
[1:28:28] predestinated
[1:28:29] to receive this message in this age
[1:28:35] when it fell upon luther it manifested
[1:28:37] the promises of that hour when it fell
[1:28:39] upon wesley it manifested the promises
[1:28:41] of that hour when it falls in this day
[1:28:44] it manifests the promise of this hour
[1:28:46] when it fell upon moses it manifested
[1:28:48] the promise of that hour fell upon noah
[1:28:51] manifest the promise of that hour when
[1:28:53] it fell upon jesus it manifest the
[1:28:55] promise of that hour see
[1:28:58] it's the holy spirit coming down to
[1:29:00] quicken make alive those people that's
[1:29:03] foreordained of god
[1:29:05] to be in the rapture
[1:29:10] has a fridge
[1:29:12] take that quote print it out put it on
[1:29:14] your fridge you're for ordained to
[1:29:16] receive a rapturing word in this hour
[1:29:20] if it weren't to ask these hour if it
[1:29:22] worked in luther's hour if it worked in
[1:29:24] jesus hour it will work today it's yours
[1:29:28] to have you're predestinated
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:33] to receive it in this hour
[1:29:36] notice
[1:29:37] that is
[1:29:39] if he's a true eagle
[1:29:41] you know how you know if you're a true
[1:29:43] eagle
[1:29:44] he will understand the message of the
[1:29:46] hour
[1:29:48] if he's a true eagle
[1:29:50] now it's not by how many power points we
[1:29:53] have
[1:29:54] it's not by how much we understand the
[1:29:55] greek or the diagonal or we take it back
[1:29:58] to the 8
[1:29:59] 67 strong's concordance
[1:30:02] but it's understanding this is the
[1:30:04] vindicated word of the hour
[1:30:07] there is no else i'm not looking for
[1:30:09] another source i'm not looking for
[1:30:11] another resource i'm not looking for a
[1:30:12] backup plan they're andrew i don't have
[1:30:14] a plan b if this message is wrong i'm
[1:30:16] lost i don't have a backup plan i don't
[1:30:19] have another source but i'm all in if
[1:30:21] this message is wrong i'm going to help
[1:30:23] but i'm all in in this message i'm not
[1:30:25] looking for anything else nothing else
[1:30:28] is i recognize in my ears but we must
[1:30:31] have the pure word if you're a true evil
[1:30:33] you'll recognize that we're not walking
[1:30:35] in another age we're walking in this age
[1:30:39] [Applause]
[1:30:41] it's for you
[1:30:43] you want another prophecy about it so
[1:30:45] therefore we know that luther could not
[1:30:47] get to it wesley and so forth the
[1:30:48] reformers knox finney calvin are down so
[1:30:50] forth they didn't get it all but what
[1:30:53] they had was the gospel truth amen
[1:30:56] but now somebody say now
[1:30:58] in the last days we are given the
[1:31:00] understanding by the word
[1:31:03] somebody say by the word
[1:31:05] that we are going to understand it
[1:31:13] we are given the understanding
[1:31:15] by the word that we will understand this
[1:31:18] message and when you recognize this
[1:31:21] message to be the truth
[1:31:23] it's not just a fielded quote it means
[1:31:25] you have potential for rapture it means
[1:31:28] you recognize you have a theophany
[1:31:31] there's elements inside you that will
[1:31:33] take a body change when you recognize
[1:31:35] this would be eagle food
[1:31:39] god doesn't throw theophanies out there
[1:31:41] for everybody to have
[1:31:43] but they're all numbered in his mind
[1:31:44] they're written on the last book of life
[1:31:46] and he recorded them already and if you
[1:31:49] come in touch with your theophany
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:53] you can't lose
[1:31:54] you can't be lost you can be defeated
[1:31:56] you can't be you can get down you can
[1:31:58] get gloomy but you cannot lose
[1:32:03] god's already got a place prepared
[1:32:05] he didn't just prepare it for anybody to
[1:32:07] come but you
[1:32:08] alone cannot lose
[1:32:11] well we've got to remove the doubt that
[1:32:12] it's for somebody else or for another
[1:32:15] time or maybe this message is the truth
[1:32:17] but it's just not for me we've got to
[1:32:18] get rid of that devil
[1:32:23] we know it
[1:32:25] this harmony is to exist
[1:32:27] between the groom and his bride
[1:32:30] he shows her his word of life she
[1:32:32] receives it she never doubts it somebody
[1:32:34] say never doubts it
[1:32:36] therefore nothing
[1:32:38] nothing can harm her not even death for
[1:32:41] if the seed be planted the water will
[1:32:43] raise it up again and here is the secret
[1:32:45] of this the word is in the bride
[1:32:49] as it was in mary
[1:32:53] what did mary say when the word came to
[1:32:55] her when the word came knocking at her
[1:32:57] door
[1:32:58] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:33:01] not according to what what some
[1:33:03] so-and-so says or dr dobson says or my
[1:33:06] old pastor says be it unto me according
[1:33:10] to thy word
[1:33:12] i receive it i take it
[1:33:15] joshua came back and he said here's some
[1:33:17] grapes why don't you taste the seed why
[1:33:20] don't you eat a book why don't you have
[1:33:22] a taste of it recognize this is the
[1:33:25] gospel truth in this hour there is none
[1:33:28] other
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:29] this is it friends we're not looking for
[1:33:32] anything else this is it
[1:33:34] this is the fullness of all things
[1:33:37] it's in this word how come now in 2022
[1:33:40] we're just getting to these revolutions
[1:33:43] it's this time
[1:33:45] man in the 70s read this message just as
[1:33:47] much as i'm reading it today it wasn't
[1:33:50] time but now
[1:33:54] this day this scripture is fulfilled the
[1:33:57] bride has the mind christ for she knows
[1:34:00] what he wants done with the
[1:34:02] word and she performs the command of the
[1:34:06] word in his name for she has
[1:34:08] thus saith the lord
[1:34:12] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:34:14] it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:34:15] planted in water that comes to full
[1:34:18] harvest
[1:34:19] serving its purpose those in the bride
[1:34:21] do only his will
[1:34:23] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:34:27] what a consolation friends the bride
[1:34:29] only does his will and no one can make
[1:34:32] you do otherwise
[1:34:35] they have the sith the lord or the keep
[1:34:37] still they know that it has to be god in
[1:34:40] them doing the works
[1:34:43] fulfilling his own word god in them
[1:34:46] doing the works brother daryl if you
[1:34:48] took account of how many healings you've
[1:34:50] seen in your ministry you run out of
[1:34:52] paper
[1:34:53] it'd be too many to count
[1:34:55] come on it's god
[1:34:57] in them
[1:34:58] doing the works
[1:35:01] just in this year i've seen more
[1:35:03] miracles in my own walk than i have in
[1:35:05] my whole walk put together it's god in
[1:35:07] them doing the works it's god in her
[1:35:11] doing the quick short work she knows
[1:35:14] what he wants done with word
[1:35:16] she's gonna do something with it now
[1:35:19] you sat in here service after service
[1:35:21] listen to tape after tape you know the
[1:35:23] message in and out you probably have
[1:35:24] said oh you misquoted that or he didn't
[1:35:26] read that correctly or there's a period
[1:35:27] after that you know what you know the
[1:35:30] word
[1:35:32] but it's time to perform it
[1:35:35] it's not just time to quote it
[1:35:37] but feel good about it
[1:35:39] it's time to perform the word in which
[1:35:41] we've labored so hard to keep under with
[1:35:44] we've made sacrifices after sacrifice
[1:35:46] and we've labored to be in this building
[1:35:48] tonight i know that you sacrifice to be
[1:35:50] where you're at
[1:35:52] but for what purpose
[1:35:54] to perform
[1:35:55] the word
[1:35:56] to perform
[1:35:58] the next chapter of acts
[1:36:03] they know that it has to be god of them
[1:36:05] doing the work fulfilling his own word
[1:36:08] he did not complete all his work while
[1:36:11] he in his earthly ministry so now
[1:36:13] somebody's saying now
[1:36:15] he works in and through the bride she
[1:36:17] knows that for it was not yet time for
[1:36:20] him to do certain things that he must
[1:36:23] now somebody say now
[1:36:25] do but he will
[1:36:27] now fulfill through the bride that work
[1:36:29] which he left for this specific
[1:36:33] time
[1:36:36] god didn't misplace you
[1:36:39] god put you in the wrong age
[1:36:41] god didn't place you in a just a random
[1:36:43] time out of just
[1:36:44] there you were but god specifically
[1:36:47] placed you for this specific time to
[1:36:49] fulfill a specific word in this hour
[1:36:54] i said three specifics without messing
[1:36:56] up
[1:36:57] [Applause]
[1:37:03] you know there's something more than you
[1:37:07] you know there's greater purpose in your
[1:37:08] life
[1:37:09] you know that something's pulling you
[1:37:11] drawing you
[1:37:13] yeah you know that until you came into
[1:37:14] the contact with this word
[1:37:16] you were helpless you're a wretch
[1:37:19] looking for something
[1:37:20] and now we've come under the leadership
[1:37:22] of this word and it's given us a promise
[1:37:23] that there is another purpose to fulfill
[1:37:26] there's a finishing capstone age there's
[1:37:28] there's a finishing to this word that's
[1:37:31] what's pulling us
[1:37:32] that's what's drawing us but when the
[1:37:34] anointing has come in many fail to
[1:37:36] recognize what that anointing is
[1:37:38] bringing
[1:37:40] we're going to be sitting through here
[1:37:41] is everybody that could be here all
[1:37:42] weekend raise your hand you can be here
[1:37:44] all weekend
[1:37:45] you're going to no doubt feel the
[1:37:46] anointing of god come into this room
[1:37:49] it's going to circle past here it's
[1:37:50] going to go row by row it's going to
[1:37:52] come up it's going to go down it's going
[1:37:54] to go up there in the sound booth and
[1:37:55] it's going to come down it's going to be
[1:37:56] radiating right around this word right
[1:37:58] here
[1:38:01] when that anointing comes into this room
[1:38:03] do not miss it
[1:38:05] do not miss it and put it off for
[1:38:06] another time do not miss it you might
[1:38:09] not get next year's pawnee meetings you
[1:38:11] might not get next sunday you might not
[1:38:13] get next wedding when that anointing
[1:38:15] comes into this room do not miss it
[1:38:18] we've got to be so desperate to get
[1:38:21] where we need to be do not miss it when
[1:38:23] it comes in do not miss it when you feel
[1:38:25] the wave of god recognize you're walking
[1:38:28] in that time
[1:38:32] a friend of mine just came from us from
[1:38:34] so-called messenger church to our camp
[1:38:36] meetings he said wow
[1:38:38] he said i've never seen anything like
[1:38:39] this
[1:38:40] he said it was like we were living in
[1:38:42] brother branham's days he said this is
[1:38:44] exactly what i imagined it would be like
[1:38:46] and i kind of took a step back i said
[1:38:48] how
[1:38:49] shame on me
[1:38:51] yeah
[1:38:51] shame on me for not recognizing
[1:38:54] when that anointing comes in that room
[1:38:55] it's the same angel
[1:38:57] it's the same anointing it's the same
[1:38:59] power and many of us would say oh we
[1:39:01] could just have a conference with
[1:39:02] brother branham but the angel is the one
[1:39:04] that told brother brandon what to say
[1:39:06] and that same angel has come into our
[1:39:08] church time after time after time and we
[1:39:12] fail to recognize the presence of god in
[1:39:14] our hour this message will draw the
[1:39:16] angel into our presence
[1:39:19] this message that's preached about this
[1:39:21] pulpit we'll draw the angel of the lord
[1:39:22] to this building
[1:39:24] he accompanies his message
[1:39:27] it's the same anointing we're not
[1:39:29] looking to live back in brother
[1:39:30] branham's days i don't want to live in
[1:39:31] brother branagh's days i'm living in the
[1:39:33] days of the message of the voice
[1:39:37] it's about to be finished we're living
[1:39:40] in that hour we got to recognize when
[1:39:42] that adolescent comes in jacob knew
[1:39:44] there was an israel inside him the whole
[1:39:46] time
[1:39:48] jacob knew there's more to me i'm not
[1:39:50] just going to dive supplanted there's
[1:39:52] another me inside here when that
[1:39:54] anointing came in he didn't let it go he
[1:39:57] said i've got to have a change i've got
[1:39:59] to have a name change that anointing is
[1:40:02] what changes our name
[1:40:04] we'll never receive it the same thing
[1:40:06] happened for john when he came under
[1:40:07] that anointing on the isle of patmos
[1:40:11] caught up under that anointing he said i
[1:40:12] know there's more to john than just this
[1:40:15] then just describe
[1:40:16] they're just writing these things and
[1:40:18] being a loving kind person and a good
[1:40:20] christian there's more to john than that
[1:40:22] but when that anointing came through he
[1:40:24] said i'll not let you go till you bless
[1:40:26] me i'll not let you go until you reveal
[1:40:29] my name on the book i'll not let you go
[1:40:32] we gotta have the same
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:35] that anointing that's going to come
[1:40:37] through
[1:40:40] we're not preaching spiritualism
[1:40:42] he's here for a purpose
[1:40:44] he doesn't come in the door if he's not
[1:40:46] here to fulfill a purpose
[1:40:48] and how many times have we let him sit
[1:40:50] with it with dirty feet
[1:40:53] back in the corner
[1:40:55] i hope we didn't come into these
[1:40:57] meetings this week thinking oh it's just
[1:40:58] going to be it's going to be better than
[1:41:00] last year better than the year before
[1:41:01] this is the meeting
[1:41:06] i don't know what you have need of in

[1:41:46] stepping into right now

[1:42:10] israel was in there the whole time he
[1:42:13] had to labor under that anointing he had
[1:42:16] to physically restrain himself under
[1:42:18] that anointing
[1:42:20] to receive his blessing and yet we can't
[1:42:22] take a little bit of the word
[1:42:32] we've had more vindications
[1:42:36] than any church gone before us
[1:42:38] we've seen the vindication of this word
[1:42:41] how many times did brother venom say the
[1:42:42] light struck the lens
[1:42:44] remember he's talking about the picture
[1:42:46] the light struck the lens
[1:42:49] i believe the light struck the lens

[1:42:53] i believe we've recognized there's a
[1:42:54] there's another being in the room the
[1:42:57] light has struck the land the lens only
[1:42:58] reflects an image of what it sees the
[1:43:01] light has struck the lands in this
[1:43:03] building however the light struck the
[1:43:05] lands in your life you recognize that
[1:43:06] you're living under a greater power
[1:43:10] than the power of this age

[1:43:19] you gotta listen for that anointing to
[1:43:21] come through don't get stuck don't get
[1:43:24] stuck in the wrong age

[1:43:27] pentecostal you're going to get stuck in
[1:43:29] the lutheran age
[1:43:30] you're so busy battling that it's all
[1:43:32] about emotion you're going to get stuck
[1:43:33] in the pecostal age
[1:43:35] don't don't miss the change of the
[1:43:37] anointing
[1:43:40] but what dick takes what dictated though
[1:43:42] that it was wesley's age did you
[1:43:44] brothers know
[1:43:45] what what made wesley's age
[1:43:47] what was the way west these people acted

[1:43:54] luther's people acted what made it
[1:43:56] pentecost sage

[1:44:14] am the one who dictates what a bright
[1:44:16] age looks like i'm the one who dictates
[1:44:19] whether it's too emotional or whether
[1:44:20] it's too charismatic or whether it's too
[1:44:22] dry i'm the one that dictates because i
[1:44:25] am the bride this is my age
[1:44:29] we set the pattern the bright age is

[1:46:10] the symphony of god's great drama that
[1:46:12] he's playing it changes him
[1:46:15] his symphony at the junction the
[1:46:17] composer and those who are interested
[1:46:21] listen for the change
[1:46:25] they listen
[1:46:26] for the change
[1:46:28] in the book of luke i don't know how
[1:46:29] long we've been i'll try to cut some of
[1:46:31] this out
[1:46:32] it's a meeting right
[1:46:34] everybody okay
[1:46:36] book of luke 19 and when he was come
[1:46:38] nigh even now with the descent of the
[1:46:40] mount of olives the whole multitude of
[1:46:42] disciples began to rejoice and praise
[1:46:43] god with a loud voice for all the mighty
[1:46:46] works that they had seen saying blessed
[1:46:49] be the king that cometh in the name of
[1:46:50] the lord peace in heaven and glory in
[1:46:53] the highest and some of the pharisees
[1:46:55] from among the multitudes said unto him
[1:46:57] master rebuke thy disciples and he
[1:47:00] answered and said to them i tell you
[1:47:01] that if these could should hold their
[1:47:03] peace the stones would immediately cry
[1:47:06] out and when he was come near he beheld
[1:47:08] the city and went over saying if thou
[1:47:10] hatch known even now at least in this
[1:47:13] thy day the things which belong unto thy
[1:47:17] peace
[1:47:18] but now they are hid from thine eyes for
[1:47:20] the day shall come upon thee that thine
[1:47:23] enemies shall cast a trench about thee
[1:47:25] encompass thee round and keep thee in on
[1:47:27] every side and shall lay thee even with
[1:47:29] the ground and thy children within thee
[1:47:31] and they shall not leave in the one
[1:47:33] stone upon another because thou knew was
[1:47:36] not the time
[1:47:38] of thy visitation
[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:42] those are strong words
[1:47:44] and what provoked those words
[1:47:48] the pharisees trying to say that the
[1:47:50] disciples of jesus didn't have the right
[1:47:53] to rejoice
[1:47:55] let me just deal with this devil of
[1:47:57] doubt for a minute all right we're going
[1:47:58] to remove all doubt
[1:48:00] no doubt many of us have been to camps
[1:48:02] and many of the youths sing here they've
[1:48:03] been to kemp after camp you felt the
[1:48:04] anointing of god and you've danced and
[1:48:07] you've cried and you and you prayed and
[1:48:08] you felt that rejoice anointing and then
[1:48:10] what happens
[1:48:12] that old pharisee spirit gets back on
[1:48:14] you and says hey you're out of order
[1:48:17] were out of line you ought not to act
[1:48:18] like that
[1:48:20] you know that wasn't a real victory that
[1:48:22] was just emotion or that was just
[1:48:23] harismore that was that that was the
[1:48:25] emotion of the preacher got you caught
[1:48:27] up
[1:48:28] you ought not to act like
[1:48:30] that how jesus handled that devil of
[1:48:33] doubt to say you'll never live your seed
[1:48:36] will never live there will be no
[1:48:38] blessing done unto you because you have
[1:48:39] tried to quiet the praise of god's
[1:48:42] people
[1:48:44] you know why the pharisees were upset
[1:48:46] that jesus disciples were rejoicing we
[1:48:48] find in matthew 9 then came to him
[1:48:50] disciples of john saying why do we and
[1:48:53] the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples
[1:48:57] fast not
[1:48:58] and jesus said unto them can the
[1:49:00] children of the bride chamber mourn
[1:49:02] as long as the bridegroom is with them
[1:49:05] but the days will come when the
[1:49:06] bridegroom shall be taken from them and
[1:49:09] then they shall fast
[1:49:12] no man putteth a piece of new cloth into
[1:49:14] an old garment for that which is put in
[1:49:16] it into fill it up take it from the
[1:49:17] garment and the rent is made worse
[1:49:20] neither do men put new wine in old
[1:49:22] bottles the bottles break and the wine
[1:49:24] runneth out and the bottles perish but
[1:49:26] they put new wine into new bottles and
[1:49:29] both are preserved
[1:49:33] that old spirit's still here
[1:49:35] brother manuel your church not not to
[1:49:37] rejoice like it's rejoicing
[1:49:40] how come they're not fasting praying
[1:49:41] like us over here
[1:49:44] brother wendell why is your church
[1:49:45] always on top of the world
[1:49:47] why are they always shouting
[1:49:48] that'll be fasting and praying
[1:49:52] all right
[1:49:53] that's what the disciples of john were
[1:49:54] saying
[1:49:55] how come you're not fasting and praying
[1:49:57] like we are are you not taking this
[1:49:58] serious are you not sincere enough

[1:50:07] herald of his coming

[1:50:10] they put in there it's fast and pray
[1:50:12] fast and pray fast and pray fast and
[1:50:14] pray and you know why they do that he
[1:50:16] said because they have failed to
[1:50:18] recognize the awakening of the bride
[1:50:21] this is not a time to fast and pray
[1:50:24] friends i don't mean that if you have
[1:50:25] need or you can go fast and pray that's
[1:50:27] not a time to fast and pray in the
[1:50:29] church and to try to keep the praise of
[1:50:31] god's people quiet
[1:50:33] how can the bride keep quiet when she is
[1:50:35] with the bridegroom how can she hold
[1:50:38] back her praise which she knows she's
[1:50:40] been awakened she's come under a new
[1:50:42] handship a new authority this is her
[1:50:45] season to cry out

[1:50:49] praise brother colby how you praise the
[1:50:51] mirror is how you're going to praise him

[1:51:00] these stones will immediately cry out
[1:51:03] if she holds back her praise friends i
[1:51:06] don't want to be guilty of holding back
[1:51:08] praise to my god i don't know what he's
[1:51:10] done for you but if i can tell you what
[1:51:12] he's done for me i don't want to be
[1:51:14] guilty of holding back my praise from my
[1:51:17] god
[1:51:20] he's done so much for me i cannot tell
[1:51:23] at all
[1:51:24] i cannot tell at all
[1:51:26] he has washed
[1:51:29] all of my sins away
[1:51:32] we don't want to get to the finish line
[1:51:34] and realize he had a little bit more
[1:51:35] praise left inside us
[1:51:38] that i had a little bit more voice left
[1:51:39] to give brother andrew we want to give
[1:51:41] everything that we are
[1:51:43] he's done so much for us
[1:51:46] how can the bride keep quiet when she is
[1:51:48] walking with the bridegroom

[1:51:53] he's my hero
[1:51:55] he's done everything i exalt him i lift
[1:51:58] him i praise him i worship him he's my
[1:52:01] bridegroom
[1:52:05] that same pharisee devil is upon the
[1:52:07] church to try to keep your pace quiet
[1:52:11] ain't no god-called ministry ever tried
[1:52:13] to keep the church quiet
[1:52:15] i've never seen a wildfire in my life
[1:52:19] we were put here for one purpose and one
[1:52:21] purpose only
[1:52:22] let everything that hath breath
[1:52:25] praise ye the lord
[1:52:28] praise he the lord over here
[1:52:30] praise you the lord over here praise you
[1:52:33] the lord praise you the lord i'm not
[1:52:36] working you up i'm trying to tell you
[1:52:38] what hour you're living in
[1:52:41] destroy the demon of doubt been moving
[1:52:49] that's a giant that come into the church
[1:52:51] in the last day i say we cut his head
[1:52:53] off
[1:52:54] i say we let the praises ring in this
[1:52:56] hour
[1:52:57] i say god's worthy of it it's not how
[1:52:59] loud i am or how powerful i sing he's
[1:53:02] worthy of it
[1:53:04] [Applause]
[1:53:06] recognize the anointing that's coming to
[1:53:08] our midst
[1:53:10] this is not just some age
[1:53:12] not some word
[1:53:14] it's the greatest thing that has ever
[1:53:15] struck the face of the earth and you are
[1:53:18] privileged to be predestinated to
[1:53:20] receive it
[1:53:22] and to think that a baptist can shout
[1:53:24] louder than you
[1:53:28] he doesn't even know how many gods there
[1:53:29] is but you've been predestinated to
[1:53:32] receive a vindicated word in this age
[1:53:35] ain't no rock going to steal my praise
[1:53:39] now well i've got breath in my lungs not
[1:53:41] while i've got praise left again sister
[1:53:43] lily ain't nobody gonna steal my song
[1:53:46] not while i've got breath in my lungs
[1:53:50] not as i'm a lot longer i'm allowed to
[1:53:52] testify i'm going to praise his name
[1:53:55] we've got to recognize where we're
[1:53:56] walking
[1:53:58] to think that we're coming under that
[1:53:59] third sign it's here
[1:54:03] remember brother brown said there's been
[1:54:04] a change in my ministry did you hear the
[1:54:06] change in the octave we've stepped into
[1:54:08] another octave we're not walking in the
[1:54:10] octave of another age we're walking in
[1:54:13] the right octave we've stepped a little
[1:54:15] bit higher we're now receiving something
[1:54:17] higher
[1:54:18] than they had back there
[1:54:22] hit another spirit real quick
[1:54:25] in the seven sea message brother man
[1:54:27] will say you just live a good christian
[1:54:28] life
[1:54:30] you don't need to understand all this
[1:54:32] you just leave it
[1:54:33] you live a good life
[1:54:35] this isn't for you
[1:54:39] and men today are still preaching the
[1:54:41] same thing
[1:54:42] hey you just live a good christian life
[1:54:45] you just you just you know you you play
[1:54:46] that tape once a week
[1:54:48] you just push play when i say
[1:54:50] and you'll make it
[1:54:52] because that's not for you to understand
[1:54:53] anyway you know why the devil wants to
[1:54:55] keep the revelation of the seventh seal
[1:54:57] out of the church
[1:55:02] there's a people that it's for
[1:55:05] i've been given to understand that there
[1:55:07] will be an understanding in this age at
[1:55:10] the end time somebody will understand
[1:55:13] the words that i prophesied about
[1:55:15] somebody will take this word and they
[1:55:17] will manifest the very prophecy of what
[1:55:20] i'm preaching to you
[1:55:21] now 1963 church this is not for you but
[1:55:25] it's for another church there's another
[1:55:28] people that are going to fulfill the
[1:55:30] things that i'm speaking to you now
[1:55:33] don't let that demon of doubt come in
[1:55:34] here and try to steal you away from the
[1:55:36] victory
[1:55:37] the seven seal is not a scarecrow
[1:55:39] [Applause]
[1:55:40] that's why the devil's trying to keep
[1:55:42] the holy ghost out of nothing gets me
[1:55:43] more upset
[1:55:45] then some preacher
[1:55:47] so-called trying to keep the holy ghost
[1:55:48] out of the church
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:52] if you only knew me before i had the
[1:55:53] holy ghost
[1:55:58] nothing gets me more upset yeah is that
[1:56:01] wrong
[1:56:02] to be upset
[1:56:04] yeah i mean it makes me mad
[1:56:06] it reboils my blood
[1:56:09] trying to take the holy ghost away from
[1:56:11] the only thing that will save these
[1:56:13] young people trying to take the power of
[1:56:15] the holy oak side of the church that is
[1:56:17] the only thing that will set the captive
[1:56:19] free it's the only thing that will
[1:56:21] redeem the lost is the only thing that
[1:56:22] give liberty to them that are bruised it
[1:56:25] is the only thing that gives us peace i
[1:56:28] wonder why anxiety is an all-time high
[1:56:30] depression moving to the church of god
[1:56:32] because men have taught the power of the
[1:56:34] holy ghost out of the pulpit
[1:56:38] not on my watch
[1:56:40] i will preach the holy ghost until i run
[1:56:42] out of breath
[1:56:44] i will preach the holy ghost until i
[1:56:46] fall over and die it is the very life
[1:56:49] source
[1:56:51] without the dynamics you will never
[1:56:53] receive the mechanics you will never
[1:56:55] know what it meant you must have the
[1:56:57] dynamics working in the church
[1:57:01] we've got to remove all doubt that we
[1:57:03] are walking in the perfect light of god
[1:57:06] no question is this right is this wrong
[1:57:08] devil's got us so confused sometimes we
[1:57:10] don't know which way we're coming or
[1:57:11] going
[1:57:12] you say cut his head off
[1:57:16] i say we got to have the same faith as
[1:57:18] joshua when he crossed over into that
[1:57:21] land he was so sure that today was the
[1:57:24] day that this scripture was fulfilled he
[1:57:26] needed just a little bit more time
[1:57:30] moses had two signs joshua walking under
[1:57:32] another sign he needed just a little bit
[1:57:34] more sunlight
[1:57:36] he said son stand still
[1:57:40] now you think what if i said that
[1:57:43] i think this guy's lost his rocker
[1:57:48] but those men were so aware of what
[1:57:50] anointing that they were walking under
[1:57:53] they knew the power they saw the captain
[1:57:55] of the lord of the host going before him
[1:57:57] they knew that there was no way that
[1:57:58] they could fight that fight they
[1:58:00] recognized the anointing that they were
[1:58:02] under and when joshua spoke those words
[1:58:04] they said come on boys we got some more
[1:58:06] time to fight
[1:58:08] come on god's given us a little more
[1:58:09] grace in this power to win some more
[1:58:11] souls god's given us the more grace to
[1:58:13] bring that prodigal back in son
[1:58:16] stay still
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:19] it's a paradox right
[1:58:21] for the sun to stand still
[1:58:23] never happened
[1:58:25] who is joshua think that he can command
[1:58:27] the creation of god
[1:58:28] to stand still
[1:58:34] they were so sure that today with the
[1:58:36] day
[1:58:38] he said lord
[1:58:39] i need a little bit of help
[1:58:42] and god caused
[1:58:44] flaming stones of fire to fall from the
[1:58:46] sky and destroy giants from among them
[1:58:49] you tell me when that ever happened
[1:58:51] before
[1:58:55] those stones are created for one purpose
[1:58:57] and one purpose only
[1:58:59] to kill
[1:59:00] giants
[1:59:02] god created those stones to say giants
[1:59:06] right
[1:59:07] so then later we pick up we pick up
[1:59:09] david and walk in the same valley right
[1:59:12] he's in need of some stones
[1:59:14] and there he finds five stones
[1:59:18] right in the same valley where joshua
[1:59:20] called for stones from heaven
[1:59:22] dave's walking along that stone looks
[1:59:23] just a little bit special
[1:59:26] huh
[1:59:27] putting that in my
[1:59:29] this stone's created to kill a giant
[1:59:35] you think we're just
[1:59:37] we're just reading this message for fun
[1:59:40] because it makes us excited
[1:59:41] i think i'll put that quote in my script
[1:59:43] bag
[1:59:45] it was created to kill giants
[1:59:47] that quote was made to kill a giant
[1:59:50] that inspiration was designed to kill a
[1:59:52] giant
[1:59:53] and david's one of them stones and put
[1:59:55] in his sling
[2:00:02] but abram says
[2:00:03] those stones
[2:00:05] are confessions
[2:00:07] those great stones that fell from heaven
[2:00:10] are
[2:00:10] confessions
[2:00:12] what's in your mouth
[2:00:15] i think i'll take this quote right here
[2:00:17] i'm putting my script back
[2:00:19] i think i'll take this great stone right
[2:00:21] here i'll put in my mouth
[2:00:23] maybe i'll have a leather sling but i
[2:00:25] got a mouth out of the confession of my
[2:00:28] mouth
[2:00:30] these great stones that we've been
[2:00:32] preaching to you they're going to come
[2:00:33] forward over this pulpit these great
[2:00:35] stones don't let them just pass by but
[2:00:37] those stones were designed specifically
[2:00:41] to destroy giants those stones were
[2:00:43] created by the almighty and fell down to
[2:00:46] destroy giants and to think that we're
[2:00:48] letting giants walk around in our home
[2:00:51] to think that we're letting giants walk
[2:00:52] around in our life in in all night time
[2:00:55] our our fears and our failures to think
[2:00:58] they're letting a giant come down when
[2:01:00] we have a stone created for the purpose
[2:01:03] of destroying him
[2:01:05] the word is nigh
[2:01:07] even in thy mouth
[2:01:15] pick up a stone
[2:01:17] it's a paradox
[2:01:19] in the beginning of the message of
[2:01:20] paradox brother brandon would open a new
[2:01:22] bible right
[2:01:24] he would find a bookmark one of these
[2:01:26] silky things right he got a new bible
[2:01:27] and he says yeah i opened my new bible
[2:01:29] and the first one
[2:01:31] was on the first building of the temple
[2:01:33] and the second one was on the second
[2:01:35] building of the temple then my wife
[2:01:38] unknowingly had put a bookmark of a
[2:01:40] robin
[2:01:41] placed in there
[2:01:43] under mark 11 22.
[2:01:47] you might not mean much to you but it
[2:01:48] means a lot to me
[2:01:50] but ram said he struggled with that
[2:01:52] scripture his entire life
[2:01:54] until he came under that third sign
[2:01:56] he said i never understood
[2:01:58] if you say
[2:02:00] unto this mountain
[2:02:01] and be removed and do not doubt in your
[2:02:04] heart
[2:02:06] somebody say be removed
[2:02:09] i'm just ready for the doubt to be
[2:02:10] removed
[2:02:12] you know what's going to remove that
[2:02:14] doubt
[2:02:15] those mighty stones that we have in this
[2:02:17] word it's not going to come from emotion
[2:02:19] it's not going to come from a workup
[2:02:21] it's not going to come from tears or or
[2:02:23] crying or crawling it's going to come
[2:02:25] from a mighty stone that's already been
[2:02:27] placed within this world
[2:02:29] that you've been predestinated to
[2:02:31] receive at the right time under the
[2:02:33] right anointing under the right
[2:02:35] inspiration and at that time this day
[2:02:39] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[2:02:44] [Applause]
[2:02:46] i i i i don't think that we should be
[2:02:48] struggling for anything in this life
[2:02:51] this message has given us power over
[2:02:54] every devil in hell
[2:02:55] it's given us power over anxiety it's
[2:02:57] given us power over depression he's
[2:02:59] given his power over lust it's given us
[2:03:02] power over conflict it's given us power
[2:03:04] over reasoning it's given us power over
[2:03:06] questioning it's given us power over
[2:03:08] doubt it's given us power over the wilds
[2:03:11] of the enemy this message has given us
[2:03:13] every stone that we need to slay every
[2:03:16] giant before us
[2:03:19] we're not waiting for it to come but
[2:03:21] it's here it's already here
[2:03:25] i'm just going to read that
[2:03:26] now we already have the stones the
[2:03:29] stones gods for ordained and we've got
[2:03:31] them all the way from ephesus to
[2:03:33] laodicea we're only waiting for that
[2:03:36] headstone that the builders rejected
[2:03:38] waiting for his coming the capping stone
[2:03:41] he says those great stones are
[2:03:43] confessions
[2:03:47] mark 11
[2:03:48] and jesus answereth and say unto them
[2:03:51] have faith in god
[2:03:53] for verily i say unto you
[2:03:55] that whosoever
[2:03:58] whosoever
[2:03:59] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[2:04:01] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[2:04:04] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[2:04:06] shall believe that those things which he
[2:04:08] saith shall come to pass
[2:04:11] he shall have
[2:04:13] whatsoever he's safe
[2:04:16] i think it's time that we put a list
[2:04:19] of things that need to be
[2:04:22] all removed
[2:04:25] all right how many services we got five
[2:04:27] after this you got five
[2:04:30] i don't think there should be a giant
[2:04:31] standing by the time we walk out these
[2:04:33] doors
[2:04:35] i think it's time to make a list and say
[2:04:38] be thou removed thou demon of doubt be
[2:04:41] thou removed that question if what for
[2:04:44] this really is the truth be now removed
[2:04:46] i would i would challenge you if you're
[2:04:49] struggling with doubt tonight i would
[2:04:50] challenge you to say god i want i want
[2:04:53] your message to become vindicated to me
[2:04:55] this weekend
[2:04:57] are you willing to make that challenge
[2:04:59] but you've got to apply something if he
[2:05:01] does
[2:05:04] i want your message to become a reality
[2:05:06] to me
[2:05:07] i want it to be just words on a page i
[2:05:09] want to see a living god
[2:05:11] i believe if you'll put that on your
[2:05:13] heart and say that demon of doubt be
[2:05:15] thou removed
[2:05:18] we won't see a giant in here by the time
[2:05:19] you get done andrew
[2:05:22] there won't be a giant standing
[2:05:24] these stones were created
[2:05:27] to set his people free
[2:05:34] i don't know what you need removed out
[2:05:35] of your life
[2:05:37] but the lord put this on my heart
[2:05:39] he said they've got to remove
[2:05:42] that demon of doubt
[2:05:49] it can't stand under that anointing
[2:05:52] the reason why you feel the pull to get
[2:05:54] out from underneath that anointing is
[2:05:56] because that spirit is trying to hold
[2:05:57] you back
[2:05:58] because underneath that fountain
[2:06:01] it has no hold on you
[2:06:04] the band would say i'll pray this off of
[2:06:05] you and under my anointing
[2:06:07] it'll leave
[2:06:08] but you've got to recognize
[2:06:11] you've got to recognize
[2:06:13] what i preach to you is the absolute
[2:06:15] truth
[2:06:18] friends i can testify that if you stand
[2:06:20] for this word
[2:06:22] it'll stand for you
[2:06:24] it'll stand for you every time now right
[2:06:26] brother daryl if you stand for this word
[2:06:29] it'll stand for you
[2:06:31] mr april if you stand for this word
[2:06:34] it'll stand for you
[2:06:39] it works
[2:06:42] friends i say this week and we slay some
[2:06:43] giants
[2:06:45] i say this weekend we take some id
[2:06:47] stones we put them in the in the
[2:06:49] confession of our mouths and we let them
[2:06:52] go
[2:06:54] the word is not the even in thy mouth
[2:06:57] the music players would come sorry for
[2:06:58] the time
[2:07:02] make your confession known
[2:07:04] i'm not ashamed
[2:07:06] i'm not ashamed to confess that this is
[2:07:08] the vindicated truth in this hour
[2:07:10] i'm not ashamed to say that a kentucky
[2:07:12] hillbillion was used to bring forth the
[2:07:14] unadulterated word of god
[2:07:16] i'm not ashamed to say that i do not
[2:07:18] follow him as a god i do not baptize his
[2:07:21] name i i don't fall under that i don't
[2:07:23] just come under there and push play it's
[2:07:25] really easy to push play because i don't
[2:07:27] have to apply my name next to that but i
[2:07:29] want to stand shoulder-to-shoulder
[2:07:31] with the prophet who preached the word
[2:07:35] i'm not ashamed of that
[2:07:38] i say it's time to let that stone go
[2:07:42] it's not a shame to say that this is
[2:07:44] what i believe in
[2:07:45] this is where i'm founded this is what i
[2:07:47] trust in this is my everything
[2:07:51] jonathan what will we do without this
[2:07:52] word
[2:07:55] it's the only thing that sets us apart
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:00] to think that
[2:08:02] the devil's trying to attack our
[2:08:04] ministry saying you're being too harsh
[2:08:06] you're being too bold and yet he's
[2:08:08] coming to your house and he's taking
[2:08:10] your children he's taking your freedom
[2:08:13] he's taking your liberty
[2:08:15] and yet a man of god will stand here in
[2:08:17] position
[2:08:18] and you'll say you're being too strong
[2:08:20] [Music]
[2:08:24] you know that's the truth
[2:08:26] you feel the vindication of it in this
[2:08:28] room
[2:08:28] [Music]
[2:08:31] to think that a man of god
[2:08:33] would labor to stay under the anointing
[2:08:34] to say things that he would never want
[2:08:36] to say
[2:08:38] to say to bring direction to people that
[2:08:39] he loves
[2:08:41] to to people that he's prayed for he's
[2:08:43] cried out for
[2:08:45] and then we get the attitude that you're
[2:08:47] being too hard on me
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:52] but yeah we'll let the devil just run
[2:08:53] right over us
[2:08:56] we'll let them tell us the message isn't
[2:08:57] real the message is false
[2:08:59] you're just following a man you need to
[2:09:01] go in here and listen to so and so and
[2:09:03] follow this website link or watch this
[2:09:05] youtube video and we'll let the devil
[2:09:06] ride in our own house
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:09] and steal victories away from us
[2:09:12] more than that daddy's we'll let the
[2:09:14] devil come in our house and steal
[2:09:15] victories right out of our kids
[2:09:19] it's time for men to stand in this hour
[2:09:22] i say it's time for real sons and
[2:09:24] daughters of god to stand in this hour i
[2:09:26] am not ashamed of this truth
[2:09:28] i'm not ashamed of this gospel i'm not
[2:09:30] ashamed of this message i'll stand for
[2:09:33] it and it will stand for me
[2:09:36] [Applause]
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:56] you
