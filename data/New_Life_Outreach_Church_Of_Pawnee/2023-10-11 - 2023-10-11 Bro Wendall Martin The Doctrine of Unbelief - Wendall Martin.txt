hear the reports and testimonies of that and uh we appreciate uh God's servants appreciate brother William and uh brother Harry uh for ministering on Sunday and um amen we're just going to keep on laboring until he comes and we believe he is coming very soon amen I'd like to look here in in Deuteronomy the 16th chapter and we're going to read the first eight verses it says observe the month of abib and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God for in the month of abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt By Night Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd and in the place which the Lord shall choose to put his name there thou shal eat no leaven bread with it seven days Thou shalt eat unleavened bread therewith H even the bread of Affliction for thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life and there shall be no leaven bread seen with thee in thy Coast seven days neither uh shall there be anything of the flesh which thou sacrific the first day at evened uh remain all night until the morning thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy Gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name there Thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at even and the going at the going down of the sun until the Seas at the season that thou comest forth out of Egypt and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose Thou shalt turn in the morning and go into thy tents six days Thou shalt eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day day shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God and thou shalt do no work therein amen could we go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your love thank you for your blessings Lord as as the song was just sung my redeemer's no longer dead but he is alive we're so thankful for that we're asking gracious living savor that you would be with us tonight and that you would anoint your word to our hearts and that the presence of God would be here in such a special way God we love you with all of our heart you see brother Josh Lord as he's ministering tonight I'm asking that you would anoint him and anoint the people and may your presence follow your word those that aren't here tonight Lord we ask that you would be with them and help them Lord we love you Lord now we're gathered here tonight not in though it is a routine to come on Wednesday nights but Lord our hearts don't want it to be a routine we want to meet with you we come Lord expecting to hear from you and I'm asking God that you would be here and that you would Minister to every need in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I want to minister maybe title it amen my thoughts tonight the doctrine of unbelief and we see here as we have just read and I might go ahead and read what we just read um Deuteronomy 16 And1 but I'm going to read it in the Amplified version and and um and uh sometimes we get lost in the in in in the um the Old King James English and so I'm going to read this back to you and um and maybe it'll uh I because I want you to really catch uh this this great Passover um and the observing of it it says observe the month of abib and celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God for in the month of abib the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night you shall sacrifice the Passover Lamb to the Lord your God from the flock of the herd in the place where the Lord chooses to establish his name and his presence you shall not eat leaven bread with it instead for seven days you shall eat the Passover with unleavened bread the bread of Affliction for you left the land of of Egypt in haste do this so that all the days of your life you rem you may remember thoughtfully the day when you came out of the land of Egypt for seven days no leaven shall be seen with you in all of your territory and none of the meat which you've sacrificed the evening of the first day shall remain overnight until morning you're not allowed to sacrifice the Passover a lamb in any other of your cities which the Lord your God is giving you but as the place where the Lord your God chooses to establish his name his presence you shall sacrifice the Passover Lamb in the evening at Sunset and at the time that you came out of Egypt you shall cook and eat it in the place which the Lord your God chooses in the morning you are to return to your tents for six days you shall eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day there shall be a celebration to the Lord your God so that you shall do no work on that day can you say Amen now we see here as we are looking at this Passover that the lamb was to be slain it was the lamb being slain one time and then there was seven days of unleavened bread so the lamb was slain once but then there were seven days of unleavened bread now last Wednesday night we talked about amen the leaven of of the Holy Ghost and and Jesus uh brought that uh out there in in Matthew when he was talking about amen the mustard seed and then he also talked about the leaven and that there the Kingdom of Heaven would have a leaven in that it would be amen not a wild yeast but but it would be an anointing of God within our lives upon the word of God but tonight I want to come back and I want to I want to talk about the leaven of unbelief and and if I can uh uh talk to you this this evening the importance of keeping faith alive within our hearts that the word of God can be rich and real and that every word of God means means something to us you are to eat the unleavened bread with your lamb for seven days now this is talking about the seven Church ages amen each age would have to fight the fight of faith it would have to be amen something that they would have to strive for to keep that Faith alive in their hearts we understand that the that the scripture even was saying that uh at the end of the the uh when the Apostle Paul was fixing to leave he says Grievous wolves are going to come in men's going to rise up among you of your own selves and they're going to bring in damnable heresies even in the church and and I believe it was Amen in the New Testament there where it was it was written contend for the faith I believe it was Jude that was saying contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now now the church had only been together had only been going for 30 years but yet there is there is now a cry saying that we need to contend or go back for so we can understand that leaven is there now we understand leaven is something that man though it is very small it's the yeast and though it's a little bit and and you can put it in the lump of bread and you you you mix it in just a little bit of leavon in the bread can will will make the whole loaf to Amen to rise and to puff up can you say amen amen so I I believe I want to say this here tonight if there is ever anything that we should strive for we should not strive to be better amen to rise up uh uh uh to have a better position in the church better musician or to rise up to have a a better place and you know among the preachers or a better place among the the Saints I believe there should be one desire in our heart and that's to keep a pure word or Pure Heart amen that'll that the word of God can have an effect within amen unbelief is still sin unbelief is still ungodly unbelief will keep you from the blessings of God and it will take you away from God it'll keep you out of the Rapture amen so there is a feast amen now we understand that Christ is our Passover Lamb we understand that the word is what we are eating but you see you cannot have the word mixed with your feelings or mixed with your doubt it's got to be mixed with pure Faith or the word will have no effect within your life amen there 1 Corinthians 6 or 5 and 8 it says therefore let us keep the feast talking about this Feast here not with the old leevan neither with the leevan of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth can you say Amen so this doctrine of unbelief now now you say amen uh uh what would you why would you call it the doctrine of unbelief is because Jesus was rebuking his disciples one time as they were amen uh uh the they were they were looking among themselves they had forgot to bring uh uh bread and and uh matter of of fact let's just read it there in Matthew 16 and5 amen we'll just read the whole thing here we'll we we have a little time here amen it says and when his disciples were come to the other side that's Matthew 6 and uh 16 and5 they had forgotten to take bread and then Jesus said unto them take heed and Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they reason among themselves saying is it because we have taken no bread which when Jesus perceived he said unto them oh you of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because you have no bread do you not yet understand neither remember the Five Loaves of the of the 5,000 and how many baskets ye took up neither the seven loaves of the 4,000 and how many baskets ye took up how is it that you do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread but that you should beware of the leaven of the feres and the Sadducees and they understood then understood they how he B them to not Beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees can you say Amen so this doctrine of unbelief anything contrary to the word of God Amen is unbelief you can't mix the pure word with any man's teaching you cannot mix this message with your own ideology you have got to ex accept it the way God spoke it you have got to accept it the way the prophet brought it you have got to accept it exactly the way God ordained it for this generation you've got to accept it amen there is no other way that you can that that you are going to be able Amen to come in to this into this Perfection because what you eat is what you become Hallelujah well praise the Lord do you love him amen now my wait just a minute the devil's over here trying to shut my computer off amen it says to force quit applications we're not wanting that Hallelujah all right amen we just pray this computer stays on Amen so the the doctrine of unbelief a little bit of Leaven somebody say a little bit you can believe all but just a little bit of the word of God and it will keep you out of the things of God now a Doctrine is a belief or a set of beliefs that that is held and taught a Doctrine is preached or taught Amen to a congregation by a preacher it can be taught to a wife by a husband it can be taught to our children by mamas and daddies it can be amen but but I want to tell you you you you you don't want to be preaching the doctrine of unbelief I believe that there's a time for us to believe God for the Supernatural and get rid of unbelief it is right now if we are expecting to have a Rapture then we need to get the leaven we need to get the doctrine of the of the Pharisees and the Sadducees that just simply cannot believe what God is doing present tense out of our Lives we have got to be able to see the word and believe the word for everything that we believe everything that we are can you say amen amen now I'm sorry guys amen but there's too many Slants to one prophet's message there's been way too many Slants there are too many Doctrine there are too many churches there are too many amen opinions about this message I don't really think brother brandham brought us a message amen that was really hard to understand I believe brother brandham gave us a message that we can believe and if we'll believe it the way he said it it'll produce exactly what God intended for it to be I believe this message has all authority and has all power and will bring about a Rapture if there is somebody that is willing to stand up against all of the doctrines of the Pharisees and say I believe the word of God I refuse doubt I refuse unbelief I refuse interpretation I'm going to stand upon thus saith the Lord of what this message is all about amen amen there's too many of us there's too many out there there's amen when I came when I came into the message I thought I was the only one around you know we thought we were the only ones me and me and Sean a a a and and we we started amen from uh I mean we knew there was others uh uh you know some others around somebody had given us the adoption series and and so we'd listen to that and and and and and brother Shawn and I we would just sat and cry our wives would cry as we just sat together and listen to the messages and amen we'd pass them back and forth those five tapes and amen it was just something that was so precious to us and so we we we we we found out that Jefferson had a had a tape club and so amen we got on the tape club and they started us from the very last sermon in 1965 and and took us backwards amen and so uh H we just ate it up I we started with leadership and and and just every every month we'd get us a new a new set of tapes and we were eating it and and digesting it and amen and it was beginning to change us but then we found out after a while that amen I I got a phone call from amen from a well-meaning brother a very precious brother here a pastor here in Oklahoma that called me and said brother wend we hear that amen that you're tearing at altars and and and and we also hear that amen that that that you're a little Pentecostal now brother wend you've got to get away from Pentecost amen no altars we don't need we and and the tongues and and that kind of thing brother we're beyond that you don't need that if you're going to be in the message now you're going to and I I I looked at the brother and I said amen if this message is of God then it cannot take away from the Bible it cannot take well praise the Lord amen and I said now I just got through listening amen I I had only I I I I hadn't even got through my first box of tapes yet and I told him I said amen almost every tape or every message I have heard he has given an altar call amen he is calling people to repentance he is calling people to come back to the word of God can you say Amen then before you know it I I had somebody else come over and say now if you don't have the understanding of of the seven Thunders then you're not in the message and and so I I said well my goodness I I I I well I hadn't got that far yet I I'm trying to figure out what the Thunders were and and so I amen I said oh my we want to know what the Thunders are so I they said well you got to go to Pennsylvania so I I I I I went to Pennsylvania to the city of love and and there I I I I met Joseph Coleman and and I met some of these other brothers that were telling me now amen and while they were up there preaching they were saying amen there is none of these churches that call themselves message churches that'll make the Rapture you've got to have this and so amen I I begin to think oh my amen and and then before you know it I met this one and then I met that one and then I met this one and before you know it I found that in the message was the same kind of a mess that I had come out of because when I was in Pentecost amen we love saying that our church was going to make make the Rapture and that church will not make the rapture we love saying that we were more spiritual we love prophesying and we love all of these things and and judging ourselves by one another but you see what I have found out a little bit of laven laven effect facts the whole lump well praise the Lord amen now I I I I I know there's a lot of well-meaning Hallelujah L lot of well-meaning people amen that that that just simply amen they mean well hallelujah praise the Lord guys I'm going to wait just a minute let me see what I can do here I'm want to see if I can force quit something amen now maybe it'll leave me alone I am locked up praise the Lord hey this was going to be a good message too I'm tell telling you hallelujah hallelujah well you love him all right y'all y'all get back with me or y'all y'all just stay with hang hang tight hang tight hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord I can preach the message without that but I I wanton but I but I want Hallelujah I just I just won praise the Lord hallelujah amen so so if you cannot just sit listen and believe the whole message then we've still got some leaven in our lives amen now I want y'all to stick with me here now that's the devil trying to keep me from preaching my sermon tonight and so stay in the stay in the spirit of the what I'm trying to say here tonight the doctrine of unbelief will keep the supernatural out of your life the doctrine of unbelief will keep you from a Rapture you can not mix the pure word of God with any man's teachings and succeed can you say amen amen so amen you you you if there there are so many good well-meaning people that have that have been affected by ministers amen that are preaching uh with a slant to it until the people don't know what to believe they don't know which way to go can you say Amen but I I think that we need to be able to hear the message I believe you should be able to hear me preach and love and walk out of this church with a greater love for this message that's right I believe you should be able to walk into this church service amen and and and have a greater desire for more of God Amen I I I I I I believe that amen I I don't believe that you would amen when you listen to a message that you have to go and and and try to find somebody else's amen I I remember in the Thunders I would be asking now amen uh uh so what are the Thunders and and and um I I was I was visiting the church here in Tulsa amen and they had come you know i' had them come preach for me and I'd went and preached for them and and so and so I I I man it was constantly a seven Thunders gives faith and so amen the whole church would jump up and storm the the the uh uh the pull pit and amen that seemed to be the secret cold and so amen I you know I'd be up there preaching and wasn't getting too much accomplished you know and amen but then I'd say seven Thunders give faith and they jump up rushing I thought wow amen where where is this found at I have I have got to figure out where this is at Hallelujah but I you know what you know I what I have found I found that there was only one and maybe two places where brother Brandon had talked about it now now does that does that diminish anything no but do you want to build out of something and build your whole belief system well are y'all hearing me and on on one little quote that can't line up from the book of Genesis to the Book of Revelations and it sure didn't their interpretation of the Thunders did not line up with 1947 to 1965 so what I found was is I've got to rightly divide the word of Truth you say huh so now we're dividing what brother brandom says no we're dividing what people think about what brother brandham says I believe what brother brandham brought us was pure and true but my understanding may not be right there where brother brandham is and that's where I've got to bring my thoughts in line with thus sayth the lord well praise the Lord can you say Amen now we know the purpose of brother brandom brother Bram was to take us back to the original amen what was the original it's the same gospel that the Apostle Paul taught brother Bram brought us back to the original gospel he was to take us out of the denominationalism he was to take us out and away from what other people thought of what the Bible said what people had taught about what the Bible said brother bradam was to have the end of the Vindication of the pillar of fire the angel of God right there the same angel that gave the word to the Apostle Paul was the exact same angel that was visiting William brandham and told William brandham amen this is the way it was said at the beginning Hallelujah can you say amen amen when the when brother Brandon went on to the other side you know when he was translated to the other side and and and as he was over there and and and and and he said these are your people and and there were millions and millions and and he says oh my the these can't be brandom they amen we're all vagabonds they we we we don't have that many people and they said no these are your converts amen and and he says well where's Jesus he's he's on up a little bit further amen he says but one of them says now when when when when the Resurrection comes amen he says we we will all stand as your trophies and we will be judged by what you preach a and and you're going to have to stand before God for what you have preached and brother brandham says Oh my he says now will the Apostle Paul have to stand there too and and they said yes he will amen and he says well then I I'm going to be okay because I have preached what he preached and all of the millions all in udison said we are standing on that I just want to say I'm thankful that God sent us a prophet I'm thankful that God oh come on Church you could be out there with all of those opinions you could be out there amen with those uh doctrines of unbelief by the Pharisees and the Sadducees and and all of the denominations but God's given you a pure word he's given you a pure truth he's given you something to believe that that'll that'll anchor you and keep you in the time times of of your storms of your life if you will stand there and if you will allow the word of God to dress you then you will be everything that God's called you to be can you say Amen the scripture says that the bride is clothed with the white linen of the word of God Galatians 1 and6 it says I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that ha called you into the grace of Christ into another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than what we have preached unto you let him be what as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than what you have received let him be what for but for do I now persuade men or God which way am I going to go am I going to go after the Pharisees and their Doctrine or am I going to stand with the angel of God who has given me this word can you say amen he says do I seek to please men for if I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ so I want to say anything contrary to the faith in every word of God is sin Saints if it is in the Bible we are to believe it and embrace it can I hear an amen if God says it in that Bible we believe it and I just want to let you know right now the prophet did not take anything out of the Bible the prophet brought us back to the Bible so there are some that says you don't need your Bible anymore all you need to do it's just amen just just what what did Brother brandham say no you've got to have a basis for what you believe I am not believing this cuz William brandham said it I am believing it because he took us back to the Bible therefore because he is a word Prophet I can believe his teachings Hallelujah What can you sayen amen amen now now Beware of the 11 of the Pharisees beware beware now now these guys were just simply there these guys were just simply saying huh we ain't got enough bread and Jesus is right there and says hey beware I see some leaven in your hearts and they're going huh what he says yeah yeah he says after I've done the Miracles of the Fish and Loaves here and I've done this and I fed here and you're questioning and asking what are we going to do he says there's some leaven of unbelief and if you're not careful and you don't get the leav of unbelief out Hallelujah these guys ain't going out drinking these guys ain't going out carousing these guys are simply looking there at a situ sitation that was impossible and instead of believing God for the supernatural right there in their midst Hallelujah and Jesus is telling them amen you need to Beware of the doctrine amen the unbelief can you sayen amen I want to say here tonight I think that there should be a a a a a a a real amen a real eagles's eye on any devil that will keep keep Faith from percolating the word of God in our lives I I I think that we need to we need to zero in well praise the Lord amen I think if Israel would have been a little bit more amen apt to what watch The Border I if Israel would have been a little bit more in tune amen instead of getting so LAX the day amen you know last Saturday uh you know when they come in from this way and that way they wouldn't have have all the hostages and they wouldn't have all of the things that are people are killed over there right now but the enemy came in because they weren't guarding the Border they they they they got lack if you will amen but I'm telling you the devil is looking for a way in Praise the Lord amen they're all sitting around say we don't know how it happened we don't know what it happened it was a concerted effort amen hit us all at once they came in from the skies came in from the sea came in from uh water came in from uh the gland they were coming in from every which direction and what happened they came in and to destroy and to kill and to Ma and to take hostages amen but I and I I want to tell you in the Church of the Living God there's too much laxness among us we allow things we're not guarding that devil like we should but I want to tell you if there's ever a time to guard that heart against belief and against the sin amen of laxness and lukewarmness we should stand with that word and say God give me a heart that believes amen he said now the Apostle Paul or Paul was a prophet and taught by the Holy Ghost if Paul baptized in the name of Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ and said anyone that did different from preaching from his preaching was a cursed then it is time to wake up and see that the church is no longer controlled by the Holy Ghost but it is controlled by the nicians Acts 20 and 27 it says I have not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood for I know that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you and not sparing the flock also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them he said Paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that will come and take over with its false doctrines he knew that they would Implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part of a holy ghost Ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom of the leoty amen and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from Paul who said that when it come when all come together all had the leading of the spirit all participated in spiritual worship the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time God gives a Vindication a visitation of the Holy Spirit and people get free after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of are y'all hearing me he says when the Luther came out of Catholicism people stayed free for a while but when he died people Simply Organized uh what they thought they believe and set up their own Creeds and ideas and repudiated anyone that said anything opposite they went right back to Catholicism with a little different form now I I I want to tell you tonight amen if we are not expecting the supernatural God in all of his power and all of his Splendor and all of his glory in this last Church Amen brother we have taken on another form are you hearing me it was the Catholic church that left all of the spirituality to the preachers it was the Catholic church that said only the priest amen had What it Took and the congregation well we don't need your spiritual we don't need your this and we don't need your that but I want to tell you the Church of the Living God is a living organism we're not a denomination we are an organism where the power of the holy spirit is to flow through praise the Lord amen now I want to I I I I I I won't I I I I want to just talk to you for a moment here tonight He Man to misplace anything in God's word would simply be to Short Circuit God's power in your life to misplace anything in God's word hallelujah amen we had a dog or brother sea had a dog when we were kids amen it was a big old husky or a malamute and my goodness that dog his hair was so thick and uh man and and that he was a Houdini he could get out of the yard he was constantly digging to get out of the yard and he man Hallelujah so so Dad Dad finally put a fence amen an electric fence all around that the backyard down low and oh it kept him in for a little while and and so every time boy he'd get his nose up to it you'd hear we're going yes it's working amen but after a week or so of it Hallelujah we heard just hallelujah we're thinking yes and then we looked out the front yard and there he is on the porch Hallelujah so we found out what he done amen he found we we watched him put him back in amen he kept getting out over and over and over and so we We snuck out there and we looked and that dude would just lay down over on top of that wire ground it out to the ground and it would hurt for a few for a moment and then he found out that it quit shocking him once it hit the ground he grounded the wire out and then he would crawl underneath the fence amen and he's just sitting there just a all a Happy H tongue sticking out man just just just wanting us to brag on it Hallelujah and you know what I I I there there's too many Christians that are grounding out the power of God in their lives amen we're grounding out the power of God in our lives and brother brandham said this is how you do it he says now he says you can't take this your sincerity and all that you want to confess you just can't take it to the Methodist altar to a Baptist altar to a Pentecostal altar he says but there is an altar somewhere that he has chose to put his name in it and he would meet you at that place now when you get everything running just right it's going to run everything's set in order but if there is a short in that wire the light won't come on because it has been grounded and when you'll take one of God's word or one of his places in your own heart with stive uh selfish objectives it'll ground the power of God right there well praise the Lord you take one of God's word and you you misplace it for your own ability for your own amen for your own selfish motives and objectives well can you say amen he says if you do it amen because you want to be smart you want to be different than somebody else or something right there it's grounded it'll blow the fuse you're wrong you've got to come with sincerity with all of your heart your motives and your objectives placed right on God then search for his place find where he said and then bring it there oh Hallelujah you know what I'm what what the prophet is trying to tell us it's got to be every word of God every word of God Amen now how has it gotten I I just want to preach to you here this morning how has it gotten Among Us message Believers that we don't there is a there is there are thousands tens of thousands that don't believe in going to church anymore amen there are tens of thousands in this message that do not believe in Preachers there are tens of thousands in this message that don't believe in the nine spiritual gifts amen my word I was up preaching here a while back and somebody told me the other day they told me here a while back when I was preaching I was preaching on predestination and they say brother you got got to be careful amen now now predestinate now now listen there's not you're preaching a two Soul Doctrine I said a two Soul Doctrine amen I'm preaching predestination theet said preach it well praise the Lord amen and they said well you can't preach it here amen we don't believe in predestination I said is this not a message church I thought he was a quack but I found out there are many that don't believe in predestination in this message well praise the Lord I was somewhere one time and I was preaching on the bride age amen and I was saying amen God's called us out of this Pentecostal age into a bride age said it just like brother bradam said it Hallelujah all of a sudden I was pulled back in the office and said no no no no no we can't preach it like that you're preaching that there's there's another Revelation or there's another Prophet there's an eighth age I said no I still believe just like all message Believers that there we are living in the leoan age but the Overcomers of the age have been lifted up into the bride age does that make eight ages same age we're in the leoan age but the prophet is saying I no longer call you church I call you bride pulling us out of the pit Pentecostal system into the word age bride age bride coming word come on brother brandham said it so many different ways but I can't preach that no more in the message churches because we've got doctors of messy that is telling us what the prophet meant okay well praise the Lord I I I I I I I I just want to tell you folks if you ain't preaching every bit of this message you ain't preaching it oh can you say amen amen we don't believe in Preachers my foot we don't believe in we don't believe in church what what are we what are you what what what what what are we trying to say what is the world thinking they're calling us an a cult and they when they're calling us now they're not studying the message we're doing the studying but they think William brandom says hauh don't go over there you follow me where did William brandham ever say throw the Bible away and th and follow me come on he said follow me as I follow Christ no wonder the message has got such a bad name and it ain't William brandom that made it a bad name and I want to tell you it ain't the devil's making it a bad name it's the Pharisees that's making it a bad name it's the Pharisees that's preaching pre taking portions of it and then throwing in their own I say let's get away from the Levan of unbelief let's get away from the doctrines of unbelief and let's stand upon thus saith the Lord and believe it with everything we haveall why is there so many groups that don't believe in a move of God why why is there so many groups that believe that you've got to come and set in a church and it better be called Osco or you're not in the message where did you get that brother Bram said when the girl came up to him and told him said my goodness where a guy came up to him and said man I was doing really good until that woman in front of me started shouting and screaming man he said it gave me chills just it just messed everything I couldn't hear nothing else you said Amen brother Brandon said well that's good you're going to make a good message believer I'm so stinking proud of you you're catching everything I'm saying good for you now if the rest of those sorry Pentecostals in my church would learn to shut up no he says what brother you sure don't want to go to heaven come on huh he says there's going to be shouting and screaming and hollering all over the place in heaven then he told him this is going to be the quietest place you ever go up there there's going to be shouting and praises and down there's going to be wailing and nashing of teeth there's going to be moaning and groaning there's going to come on church I want to tell you right now let me praise God while I've got the check let the power of God be in me while I've got the chance well glory be to the Lamb of God Amen can you say amen amen it ain't brother brandham that done it it ain't brother brandom uh uh uh uh that that that ground out the power brother brandham had the power of God all the way up to the time that he left and the power of God was in his preaching and souls were being saved and admonished all the well can you say amen amen but it's the doctrine of unbelief that begins to come in how does this Doctrine how how how does a doct a doctrine spread how does a doctrine spread brother brandham taught us how it was he says in the first church age it was a it was just a little bit of a it was an action it was a little bit of a and then he says in the next Church age you become a saian and then the next Church age he says it become an official Doctrine first was just a little bit of yeah well you know amen but the devil but the devil was still a little bit scared because the power of God was there but the next Church age they begin to talk about it a little bit more because the power of God was already diminishing and then by the by by the time we got down to the Dark Ages Satan had already come in amen and it taken the very life out of the church I want to tell you tonight amen it is the taking the life of God out of the church is not God doing it it's the devil doing it and the way that it is done is because it is being preached it is being preached when you preach against the gifts when you preach against amen Miracles when you preach against the move of God what are you doing you are creating an atmosphere within the heart of those that are listening to you tell me one place where brother brandham ever took the nine spiritual gifts out of the church tell me one place where brother brandham ever said that you're not supposed to be uh we don't believe in Preachers anymore or that you need to stay home and listen to tapes come on he did correct all of those Pentecostals that were using the gifts in the wrong way he was saying there's a lot of them that are anointed because they don't have enough discernment they're anointed of evil spirits but he never took it out that's right and just because there's some rotten preachers Hallelujah doesn't mean that everyone's rotten some people say well it's easy for you to say because you're a preacher listen I've had my share I've had my share I've been wounded I've been hurt I've been kicked while on the ground by preachers I have been scarred by preachers and if it wasn't for the grace of God in my life I wouldn't be standing up here tonight but it was God's grace it was go come on Church we've all been scarred by one another and just because we hurt one another does not mean God is not using preachers well praise the Lord if you're going to use that if you're going to use that philosophy then every one of you need to break up and divorce well praise the Lord because mama ain't always been good to you and Daddy hasn't always well praise the Lord there's been times where the husband is said something to wife and the wife has said something to Mama woo Hallelujah but you know what amen does that mean that God doesn't work in marriages anymore does that mean that we're not supposed to commit to one another anymore no that means you need to both get prayed through that you're both humans and did it under the blood and walk in line with the word and God will bless the marriage well praise the Lord daddy's bad to me been been bad so I've been hurt by dad so I don't believe in dads anymore well praise the lord we don't need no preachers so we're going to skip what God says about the five-fold ministry we're going to skip what the Bible says and we're going to skip what brother Brenham says and we're going to do our own thing stay home and we're going to listen to tapes because coming out of the pure lips of the very mouth of God hallelujah if if you were listening to the very mouth of God you'd be going to church cuz that's what the that's what came out of the [Applause] lips if if you were Hallelujah push play push push play and Obey that's what I do now I put a challenge out to all the message Believers push play to every word that was brought to this generation and Obey [Applause] it but we take the power I know there's a lot of out there that's that's going in there I can't follow them I can't follow any of them but I can follow the prophet and I can ask God as a pastor to give me a pure heart before him to lead the people to help the people come on now am I subject to mistakes dear God yes have I had to stand up here and tell the church before that I'm wrong dear God yes but we're all striving and we're all pushing well praise the Lord hallelujah I'm I I I I hope I haven't already stepped on any pet doctrines here you guys are here so you got to believe in church amen that's right to say we don't believe in church is to go directly against the word of God brother bradam said amen and I've got a lot of quotes coming in all at once here but brother bradam says if you've got the Holy Ghost you cannot wait for those doors to open amen amen amen that's exactly right now now brother brandham would talk he would say now when he's talking about Martin Luther King's position as a minister and he's saying that he's not a politician that he's supposed to be a carrier of the words of life and he's asking the question what business does a preacher have out there trying to write social wrongs you said a preacher has no business doing that H H he he h how are you going to get hate out of a person who hates a black man outside of a unregenerate outside of a regeneration of the Holy Ghost you can't mix it can you say Amen now he says as I said Sunday Martin Luther King down there with them precious people leading them into a death trap oh if somebody could only talk to that man I wish I could just for a little uprising of the school proposition and and what a what a difference now or it's a it's it's it's a lot of difference my goodness if the people ain't got hard enough to associate with a man because of his color they're condemned and dead anyhow he says now he says don't fight against it what if somebody said all the Irish or somebody all the German or somebody else had a a disassociation that that would that that that would never bother Christians they'd move right on and that man's a Christian as a minister he shouldn't be leading people into a revolt against that he's going to cause Millions to die it'll start another revolutionary it's a shame to do that can you say Amen now now now he's using this he is actually this is in the indictment this is in the indictment so he is he is he is talking he is using this preacher and saying he's using his office wrongly instead of pointing them to the word are you are yall understanding where he's coming from now he says the same thing happens right here exactly the same thing again that's right the people how that' only look at the truth and see what the truth is well our church don't believe that we got some other way well it ain't the right way it ain't it ain't the thing he said repent be baptized every one of you or be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins now they won't do it oh oh then what uh what did they do amen now that's just that's just one thing up on hundreds we'll get to maybe as as fast as we can it's the second crucifixion then if a man accepts Father Son and Holy Spirit a Creed instead of the word titles instead of the name what does what does he do to the people talking about the preacher he crucifies the effects of the word to the people so a preacher standing up going against what William brandham has already taught us is crucifying the very precious power to the people because they are putting their fisical ideas in instead of letting the people believe every word how many folks here in Oklahoma what's not going to come not going to come to church well well Joseph says the word Joseph's not our Prophet now he is now I don't I I don't I'm not going to dispute whether you know whatever you know I'm not saying he's not a prophet but the word Prophet there's only one to an age folks I ain't it you ain't it and Brother Joseph isn't it and if I should lead you contrary to what the word Prophet brought then I am to be a curse that's right true there's only one message that is infallible it's not wendle Martins it's not William Smith it's not Kobe Martin it's not Joseph Branham there's only one messenger and it was Malachi the 4th chapter the 5th verse I send you Elijah and his son I send you Elijah because if we're not careful it's the same thing trying to pull us the same old devil trying to pull me said you got to believe it this way you got to believe the two Souls you can you can't preach predestination you can't pre you can't you can't you can't no no no no if anyone wants to say anything contrary to what the prophet said you say well I've got a quote well what about all the rest of them line it up forsake not the assembling of ourselves together even so much the more as you see that day approaching you see now it's easy for us to say h h yeah I'm glad you got away from that Thunder oh I'm glad but then when it comes to our own pet little peeves I am saying it can be le if we don't line it up that's right with every word of God do I fight the Thunder Brothers do I fight do I fight Brother Joseph I am not one of those guys that believe we ought to be fighting one another I believe this message is pure and true and the words of God will end up coming out the winner at the finishing line but I'm telling you as my congregation you've got to believe every bit of it can you say amen and he says he's crucified the effects of the word to the people and when he says that Mark 16 was just for that generation and God himself right there Jesus talking to them and said go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and his baptized shall be damn and he that believeth not shall not or uh shall not be let's see he that believeth and his baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them how far Every Nation every Creed every tongue every race every people the same gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe and when a man tries to cut that out of the Bible he crucifies the effects of the Gospel to that generation to or to that congregation so I indict you in the name of Jesus Christ you're guilty of murdering the Lord you see man now they asked him that the question and answers on the seals would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture he says sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour hour see the bride of Christ she consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble can you say amen he says oh I know there there many that rise up and go out and say oh I don't need to go to church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's the teacher he says when you get that idea you're just wrong for why did the Holy Ghost set the teachers in the church if he was if he was going to be the teacher there are first apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors the Holy Spirit set the teachers in the church so he could teach through that teacher it is in according to the word of God or if it isn't according to the word of God God doesn't conf conferment it isn't the right kind of teaching it must compare with the entire Bible and be just as alive today as it was then there's the real thing manifest can you say Amen in another place he says he presents his army in the form of a five five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of God each one backing one another up with a chief Captain not out there in front up here above back behind but in them that's the Army vindicating vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his Works can you say Amen now if Satan can come in now this is just a simple one I and I know we all believe that but look at how Satan has come in and has so pushed it out has so taken folks from this message so far away from the word of God till the message don't even resemble the word you have to go through some brother's interpretation The Prophet's message is to make the word clear not to take away I can't take away from the prophet's message and the prophet can't take away from the word that's why he came oh come on Church Hallelujah but you see but you see Satan comes in and and and and he and he and he and he takes you he takes me and before you know it because he has sliced a little bit out of this and sliced a little bit out of that he's taken our armor and we're no longer fighting the good fight of Faith we're just we're just taking whatever we want and letting letting the devil have the rest of the ground we're letting the devil just have all the rest of the ground can you say Amen see we don't want that amen well praise the Lord I'm I know I'm I'm I'm preaching I'm preaching better than you're Amen in right now hallelujah amen that's exactly right you see if you're preaching preach the message of the hour I don't have a little man syndrome how many knows what a little man syndrome is it's a little guy that thinks everyone else's is picking on him amen any of y'all have little man syndrome amen I think these two are because he's out growing them phe the Lord so little man syndrome is walking around make you starting fights and everything else you know because he's she's proven that he's a man Hallelujah I thought it was cute I was I was with I was with a brother one time and there was there was another man that was you know he was well he he would take it well it was be it was brother Joe it was brother Joe uh Adams you know he's short but he's buff you know and uh I was with somebody had a sort of a jacked up truck and so uh they pulled up next to brother Joe and says hey could you walk underneath the truck there and inspect things make sure everything's okay and um brother Joe was looking up there uhuh uhuh and uh but but a little a little he took it well a little man's syndrome it's one that's picking on everybody else to make himself I'm not that kind of a guy I believe that if we're in this thing I shouldn't be picking on the guy in the next Church well are y'all still here yes sir I I I shouldn't be picking on another brother that's on the same team everything that I seen of brother brandham was amen he didn't quite agree you know there there there there were a lot of those folks left left his church when he brought in uh Church order and uh so they all went down to Junior Jackson's and so they were calling them what what were they calling them what what what dead birds that what was dead birds those Dead Birds go down there and and brother BR what did he do boy I'm proud of you yeah you guys are listening into my message Hallelujah he goes as my little children I'm going to give you a spanking they believe this message like we do and we're going huh what brother brandham was not ready to kick no he says if he wants to put up with that mess down there that's his problem that's what he said maybe I'm paraphrasing it a little maybe maybe that's not wor for word but he says if he want the reason why because they wanted to keep on speaking in tongues and and and and and and having gifts and and and and just messing the service up Hallelujah and brother Brandon was trying to tell him hey I believe in the gifts I'm not taking them out but it's time to put them in order and they go we're packing our bags and we're leaving brother brandham did not get on to them for leaving he got on to the ones that were left for calling them names right I just don't see that if we're on the same team praise the Lord now you say well you just you just mentioned some names I said well yeah I am but we're still on the same team and if any man should try to take you away from this word right here you've got to say no I am not going to come under that doctrine of unbelief because the doctrine of unbelief will ground the power of life out of me I want the power of life I'm not I'm not I I don't have to go criticize somebody else to make myself look good I am here to walk with God and I believe the same holy ghost that I've got the same holy ghost that they've got and I believe at the very end of the when it's all said and done the Holy Ghost that's working on me is going to be working on them and we're all going to come in I am not looking at what they're doing and they shouldn't be looking at what I'm doing we should be looking at what the prophet said and move on well can you say amen I don't want this church to become critical or to look at people critically do I want the do I believe in the presence of God yes I do and this church has been a little bit more lively than the other message churches around our area but I cannot point a finger to them and say you're not spiritual you're a bunch of dead heads over there dead birds no if I shout more than that they shout and if you shout more than they shout it doesn't make you a bit more spiritual that's right well my mother you'll I don't know I I Can't Say Never Never Say Never but my mother you'll never see my mother up dancing around my mother just don't do that she just but I'll guarantee you my mother will sit there and cry when the Holy Ghost and you'll see her occasionally jump up out of her seat and that that is woo that's Hey listen if she does that while I'm preaching I'm going yes hallelujah amen but you see she's she you're never going to see that in her but my little mother loves this message just like I do well praise the Lord do I think we see we're not against we're not against shouting we're not against sitting we're against formality that is keeping the Holy Spirit from working in the church it's a formal spirit that keeps you bound keeps you under its thumb so it don't matter whether you're shouting whether you're whe whe whether you're sitting still it that's not what makes you spiritual it's your heart that believes this message and the life of God living its life through you now do I believe that there's too much formality yes I do we can say it in a church and the word of God's not going to move us one way or the other it's not going to make you shout and it's not going to make you smile it's not going to make you more in love with him it's not going to make you pray more than we are in formality and the life is is not where it needs to be living life lives life is real life won't allow you to be ordinary life won't allow you just to sit Amen in a in a quagmire it won't allow you just to sit in the stench of Leia life brings you out you can't be satisfied with formality well I got to go to church well I got to amen the preacher well I got to you're As Dead As Dead can be and that don't matter and I don't care if you shouted the church all night long this is this is Brother Andrew testing one two three yeah it still works Hallelujah amen yes you see now can I can I I'm I'm going to close after after these these comments here why has the spirit of the Lord why why is so many know nothing about the presence of God the spirit of the Lord moving like it should in a lot of our churches because it's either preached against with the wrong interpretation he oh we're preaching like brother Bram he was preaching against those tongues and things we don't have that problem here brother the Brenham was correcting the Pentecostals cuz he couldn't preach come on every time he tried to give an altar cuz somebody was standing up like when I'm out there but now that I'm at my church I'm going to tell you listen you were young we let it go right Let It Go with brother we just let it this is too much confusion well folks we ain't got that kind of confusion in the mess of churches sir so to preach against tongues and preach against the nine spirit your gifts would be there to pacify our unbelief and the lack of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives if brother if brother brother almost called you brother Lona if brother Ken and sister Lona been been married for how many years now 53 years then my business do I have to come over and said I'm going to tell you in order to stay together you're going to have to and and every time I talk to them I'm tell them you know you're going to have to do better because because man this this this marriage is it's going to fall apart and I just dear Lord they they've been married for 53 years all right so say something different that that has no meaning no bearing on them that's right that's well praise the Lord that's but if you guys' marriage is on the Rocks every two weeks then I am not going to use the same message them you're doing a good job man proud of you you'll be going huh no I'd be saying You' better get your act together and You' better come on right then what are we using quotes that brother brandham was speaking Pentecostals that did not want the word of God those guys didn't want the message all they wanted to do was speak in tongues and work miracles they didn't want the word of God brother can you say Amen the message has got two things Hallelujah I'm feeling my oats now you know why the devil was trying to shut my computer down amen Moses had two messages or he had he had a he had he had a two-fold purpose all right condemn Egypt and bring out the elect to sit there and condemn Israel that wasn't God's purpose he was condemning Egypt and I'm here to tell you you can't Hallelujah amen you get people that all legalistic and taking this message to beat up the people and constantly beat them up and beat them up and beat them up and beat them up amen as if their little red-headed stepchildren and treating them listen they are the Bride of Jesus Christ they are not Egyptians they are not this is God's very own bride got don't want preachers beating the church up he wants preachers keeping them clean and giving them the word of God so that they can make a Rapture and get out of here come on he's wanting men that'll that's not that doesn't mean that sometimes you don't get a spanking Hallelujah but I don't like no preachers up here constantly beating on the people making the people feel like they should dear Lord we all know we're bad we all know amen what we need is somebody to preach the promises to us and get us ready for a rapture [Applause] my wife's going through a trial I I I I've got a choice I'm going to make her feel more miserable and more bad than what she already feels or I'll tell her what she means to me let her know that I love her that I'm with her we got this and though she's looking at me cross-eyed and thinking if I could reach you I'm saying honey I just know that there's a good person deep inside Hallelujah love my girl right right I don't beat her up maybe you do someone told me here in Pony it's still legal to still on the books amen go to the courthouse every Tuesday and spank your wife praise the Lord I've never tried it I don't want to try it but I hear it's on the law don't even know if it's true but it was said so we we now listen I told somebody the other you can either criticize the bride or you can take that message that God gave us to feed the bride and the more we feed this bride Hallelujah you know how a Shepherd you know how a Shepherd leads he takes them to food a Shepherd though cheap willingly follow because he's got a track record he's got a track record of taking them into Green Pastures and feeding them now occasionally when one Strays off and there is a yeah then Mr Nice Guy has to come with his staff amen beat the snot out of the bear or whatever amen and sometimes even having to take that rebellious little lamb and break its leg but it's all in love his ministry is a Ministry of love and this message is the ministry of love to God's precious bride this is go oh God someone try to take the preciousness of what this Prophet brings us makes me mad someone takes the preciousness of what God gave us through this message so that they can build their own kingdom get their own following it's wrong it's sin give them the seven course meal are you hearing aren't you glad for the seven course meal aren't you glad don't you just love it when Mama Cooks a big old meal not you amen you Hallelujah lene says give me cereal amen I'll take seven different flavors in the cereal praise the Lord amen yes God's got a bride and this bride must only eat what God has given this bride to eat now watch this is the reason why this the reason why I said we got to keep preaching sometimes I'm preaching and I know that there is things going on in the church I've had people come up to me over the years it's funny am man I've had people come up and say you got to take that one out from underneath the blood you've got to take that kick them out no more Fellowship amen and and I just keep on preaching you know what I'm doing I've got a faith that I'm going to keep on applying that token I'm going to keep applying that token and sooner or later it's going to it's going to that those words are going around the room it's going around and sooner or later that heart will open up in faith and it'll come right down and it'll change that individual it'll change that individual but it ain't going to happen when beating them up it's going to come through that life of God can you say Amen pre preach the message preach the life keep on preaching mamas daddies you have to De it with your children don't sit there and tell them how bad they are why don't you point them what God's called them to be and how good they can be while swinging the BT am correct them with a vision in mind is that right now brother brandom says you but you can't speak with tongues unless you have the gift of tongues and no doubt at all but what there are many gifts of that in this church now there are many gifts of it over here in the Methodist Church there are many gifts of it here in the Baptist Church if it was only preached so the gift could go to operating he's saying gifts are everywhere but because it's so criticized CHR the gift can't flow that's the same way it is with your children My Philosophy is there's no bad boy or girl my thoughts are there's no such thing as a bad girl or a bad boy you all come Innocent and it's us parents that have that awesome privilege of helping them to guide when the devil's trying to pull them out pull them one way or the other right and then we want the Holy Spirit to come and fill them Hallelujah now what time is it oh it's almost nine o'clock sorry guys hallelujah what time did you get me up here hallelujah brother Brandon said now you take a tree and put it away from water the first thing you know you've got little old apples they're all naughty and worm eaten but it casts its crop and that's what's the matter with the churches today you've got away from that River you've got away from them gifts of the Spirit you've got a you've just got a natural church and they get away from the spiritual gifts and the spiritual things and they cast their fruit and what do they do they're believers they live with but they live with the world act like the world steal cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble have bunk old parties in the church pay the to pay the pastor preacher everything else soup suppers and dances they cast their fruit but it's just like the world and the believer look and say there's no difference between that person and me can you say man but there in 64 he says how many in here would like for God's provided lamb to open your eyes and I just want to ask you how many wants the bloody bleeding lamb to open your eyes I want my eyes to be wide open so that you can see him here now present he said would you raise your hands God open my blinded eyes let me have my veil took off My Heart Lord that I might understand now how will he be known how will we know him by his nature what he does his Works he said I'm the vine you're the branches and the branch Bears the fruit not the vine the vine energizes the branches and if the branch ever brings forth or a Vine ever brings forth a branch it has grapes on it the next that comes out or the branch of that vine will have grapes on it if the first church that came off that vine was a Pentecostal church with all the gifts if that ever really puts out another Branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it that's what they had in the days of the Apostles and the apostolic age never ended Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children and to them that are fall off even as many as the Lord Our God should call as long as God is still calling the apostolic age still goes on for the promise the promise like it was back then now is to you to your children now he's the one that put that in there he's reading for the promise then he says the promise like it was back then is to you your children them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call I'm going to give you one more in 9965 brother Brenham died at the end of of uh was it huh he's in December so 9 10 11 12 three months before he passes away Jesus says I am the light and you are in him how do you get into him joining him no shaking no baptism of water no by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ and in that body is nine spiritual gifts operating through that local body that local church that's Apostolic if I ever knew it that's right you see how far we can get away you see how far people can I'm I'm I'm doing just a couple of things here that are noticeable in our churches today there's a big big deal against preachers against church and against the moving of the spirit and yet brother brandham fought so hard for that to be among us I came out of denominational Pentecost lost I know what that's like but I've also experienced God in such a supernatural way and brother brandom says every generation has a right to their own revival can you say amen and I want someone say well brother W do you speak in tongues yes I do did you quit speaking in tongues the gifts of this gift of speaking in tongues left you whenever you you came into the church right because God don't speaking tongues no more no wrong no I just learned how to operate it I just learned you're either going to be a Corinthian Church or you're going to be an Ephesian church and I want to be an Ephesian church can you say amen that's right I want to be one of those that the power of the holy spirit is flowing through me I want you young people to desire I I want y'all to see I want those gifts on the inside of you we're thankful for the guitar players and my good how many enjoyed brother uh Harry's get to our playing tonight and seeing sister lenee over there playing am man I'm just I'm just happy I'm tell I'm I'm happy to see all these guys and and we're thankful for that but there's other gifts that God's laid in our lives too Supernatural gifts that's within us do you believe that do you love him how many wants to get rid of that Doctrine don't let me heed to that doctrine of unbelief and don't let this preacher ever preach unbelief to this congregation you say should I preach should I pray for the preacher you should pray for the pastor more than you really think that's right any man subject to fall we're all subject but we've got a message that God so protected because we needed Purity now if it was up to me I'd say let's just all pack the doors and let's all go let's just all press play that's not what the prophet taught so we've got to line up with every word I feel inadequate you feel inadequate but we've got a part to play in the body it's a body you all going you all Hallelujah you all just doing what y'all done over there with with the little with with the with the given uh sister Naomi a bath the other night you know I thought she smelt better tonight amen get giving her a h a shower a wedding shower now that's part of a body and we're not just and you say brother W is it my respon yes it's your responsibility to be there she needs to know that you're part of her we need each other we are a body you say give me scripture the scripture says there in the book of Acts they had all things in common went from house to house breaking bread this thing me and me only that is that's that's that's right wrong Prophet says say that the serpent worked Eve away from the body we're in this thing together you need to know that I'm with you not only in my I'm only with you when I want to be I'm with you and I'm rejoicing with you when you rejoice and I want to know that you're with me that you're rejoicing when I'm rejoicing I want you to know that I've got your back and I want to know that no matter how things go you you you're going to have my back and you're not going to be following your stinking attitudes whenever you get mad at me but you're going to say no I got an attitude but I love brother W Hallelujah right I don't want my wife to be thinking that I don't have her back I don't want her to think oh if I mess up no I've done told her you've got me until Hallelujah someone who who's so someone around here says my wife says she she going she going to pack up her bags and I said all right just wait a minute I'll get mine packed to where we going hallelujah amen because there is I want her to know that if there is a relationship between husband and wife what about the spirit that has baptized us into one body this individual thing no way we're in a body you say you love me prove it I say I love you prove it we love one another we're fighting for one another we've got well praise the Lord you say well yeah you know what brother brandom says it's a shame when you don't know what your brother's doing anymore oh look it up lots of quotes lots of quotes it's a shame that we've got so busy with our own little deal that we don't care about the next brother and the next one our neighbors praise the lord we want that well Hallelujah let's I'm I'm let's let's musicians can come to the music Hallelujah love anything where you're walking contrary to the word of God and the body of Christ here on the earth is it a Doctrine to you is it a set pattern of beliefs are you in this thing for your neighbor next to you really really are you for your brother sitting across the aisle your sis are you [Music] really H or do we think that scripture doesn't matter when one rejoices we all rejoice when one cries we all [Music] cry but that don't matter is that your Doctrine is that your [Music] Doctrine I believe more the Holy Ghost Works through us and in us and we get rid of our own doctrines and let the holy spirit so work can live in us we'll find that we need each other a little bit more than what we act like I think we'll love each other a little more than what we probably show I believe once we get those kinds of things out that wire that's carrying the PO is no longer grounded the anointing of the Holy Spirit can come back our belief system is lining back up with this our belief system is lining back [Music] up all four of the things I've mentioned tonight i' I've got lots of quotes on them you know [Music] that but it's whatever Doctrine you want it's all right choose your Doctrine but if you're going to follow the doctrine of Jesus Christ we're a body and we're all baptized and we want him more than we want anything else we want His blessings I want His blessings upon my children I want His blessings upon my wife I want His blessings upon my friends my neighbors I want His blessings upon everything that I do and by George if I am a stumbling block God give me a kick in the seat but don't let this lamb stray and let a devil and me lead others astray help me Lord help me Lord let this word become precious to me can I hear a great big amen God bless you tonight love every one of you to please the [Music] Lord be in his will oh lost in his [Music] presence found in his light just hear him [Music] say Jesus I just want to please be at his will to be lost in his [Music] presence is that your prayer tonight oh I just want to pleas the Lord be in his will in every way to be L is that your desire [Music] tonight I want to please you [Music] Lord if Jesus rebuked the disciples just because they didn't consider him first when they said we have no bread and he looked at him and he says the doctrine of the [Music] Pharisees are you are you are you calling us Fair we we're just asking about bread we're we just we we forgot the bread and and you you you calling you're putting us in the same line with the [Music] Pharisees yes we got to walk by the faith in every word we got to believe that he's present brother I want to tell you right now he's present where's he at Brothers he's in me and you now that day he was in the body of Jesus Christ but now he's in this body he's in this body of Believers he's within this body right here in Pony Oklahoma can you say m oh Jesus oh Jesus make this church a Powerhouse how about it is that your desire how many wants to the power of God to fall as it did on the day of Pentecost how many wants the power of God to be in our church like it was in the book of Acts how many want it in your own home I want it in my own home I want the presence of God to be so living so moving so oh that there is a there there there's a feeling for one another there's a feeling for his word there's a feeling that we're craving the supernatural I want to burden for my brothers and sisters that I'll go in prayer for them fast and pray for them days on in if I have to I want that feeling it's a body move do you see what I'm saying the things that I've just brought to your attention tonight it's Satan separating the [Music] body don't let that devil separate the preciousness of this word all together now as we close I just want to the Lord he is will every to be [Music] lost found in his likeness to hear him say hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah what a wonderful spirit we feel here tonight I just feel the

hearts of this congregation toward any one of your promises of this last day please forgive me I know this is a sacred responsibility forgive me for my laxness have not carried myself like I should so

building Lord that's ashamed of this message [Music] we've all had to stand for it we've been ridiculed for it we're willing to die for it I'm asking Lord that you would so line our hearts up with you that the glory of God the glory of this latter Church would be greater than the former we love you thank you Lord encourage all of our discouraged heal all of our sick fill all of our congregation
