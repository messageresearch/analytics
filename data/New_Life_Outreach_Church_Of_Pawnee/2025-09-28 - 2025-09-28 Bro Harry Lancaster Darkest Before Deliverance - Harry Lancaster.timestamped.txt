[10:41] Their chains were fast and tight
[10:47] down at the jail that night.
[10:50] Still Paul and Silas would not be
[10:55] dismayed.
[10:58] They said it's time to lift our voice,
[11:03] sing praises to our Lord.
[11:07] Let's prove that we can trust him. Come
[11:11] what may.
[11:15] God wants to hear you sing.
[11:20] When the waves are crashing around you,
[11:24] when the fiery darts around you and
[11:28] despair is all you see,
[11:32] God wants to hear your voice.
[11:36] Even though the wise man spoke
[11:40] says your circumstance is as hopeless as
[11:44] can be.
[11:47] That's what God wants to hear. You see
[11:53] verse two.
[11:55] Oh, he loves to hear our praise
[12:00] for those cheerful days
[12:04] when the pleasant times they outweigh
[12:07] the bad by far.
[12:12] But when suffering comes along
[12:16] and we still sing his song. Oh my. Oh,
[12:20] that is when we bless the father's
[12:24] heart.
[12:25] Thank you, Lord. God wants to hear you
[12:30] sing.
[12:31] When the waves are crashing around you,
[12:35] when the fiery darts surround you, and
[12:40] the spare is all you see,
[12:43] I want to hear your voice
[12:47] when the wild.
[12:53] It's as hopeless as can be.
[12:58] That's when God wants to hear from you.
[13:04] See,
[13:07] wherever I go,
[13:10] I'll praise him. Whenever I can,
[13:15] I'll praise him. For his love
[13:19] surrounds me like a sea.
[13:24] I'll praise the name
[13:27] of Jesus. Lift up that holy name of
[13:31] Jesus. For that day, the name of Jesus
[13:36] lifted me.
[13:39] Oh, wherever I go, I will praise him.
[13:44] Whenever I can, I will praise him for
[13:48] his love. It surrounds me like a sea.
[13:55] I'll praise the name
[13:58] of Jesus. Lift up that holy name of
[14:02] Jesus. For the name
[14:06] of Jesus, live with me. One more time.
[14:10] Oh, wherever I go, I will praise him
[14:15] whenever I can.
[14:19] [Music]
[14:26] I'll praise the name
[14:28] of Jesus. Lift up that holy name of
[14:32] Jesus. For the name
[14:36] of Jesus lifted me.
[14:42] Do you love him here tonight?
[14:44] Hallelujah. There ought to be a praise
[14:46] on your lips wherever you go. Amen. God
[14:49] bless you here tonight. Like to go to
[14:51] prayer and ask brother Mitch if you
[14:54] would mind coming. I don't have any
[14:56] written request. Let's remember um
[14:59] Grandpa Aunt Angie's not here with us
[15:02] tonight. Any any of the ones that will
[15:04] be traveling back um Tuesday. Let's
[15:07] remember brother Josh. I know he does
[15:10] want to be here but he has to be out
[15:12] there preaching.
[15:13] So, let's remember him that the Lord
[15:15] gives him and brother Ethan strength.
[15:17] And of course, remember Sister Loretta,
[15:19] she's only three weeks away. Uh, Sister
[15:21] Tina, and she said, "You're nine weeks.
[15:23] Let's just pray for them." My goodness,
[15:26] I can't imagine having to carry a child.
[15:29] So, let's you remember these these
[15:31] sisters in our church. And if anyone
[15:34] else has a a need upon your heart, just
[15:36] make it known by the lifting of your
[15:38] hand tonight. I'm so glad that we got a
[15:40] God that sees and cares. Amen. God bless
[15:42] you. Now,
[15:47] &gt;&gt; so good to be in the house of the Lord
[15:49] tonight.
[15:53] It's not about the speaker, but it's
[15:54] about God coming down, speaking to our
[15:57] hearts. If we can just get our hearts
[16:00] ready, prepare them, bow our heads now,
[16:04] and
[16:05] go to him in prayer. There's lots of
[16:08] needs. No requests right now, but there
[16:12] are needs.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; And if we can remember all
[16:17] that brother Kobe just had mentioned
[16:20] sisters and sister Angie and
[16:25] different ones
[16:29] like to say God's done miracle work with
[16:33] my foot.
[16:35] Um
[16:37] [Music]
[16:38] yeah. So
[16:41] bow our heads now. Dear Lord, heavenly
[16:44] father, we humble ourselves before you,
[16:47] Lord, as we walk into your presence.
[16:51] We invite you into our midst, Lord, that
[16:53] you'd speak to our hearts that you'd
[16:57] write your words on the tablets of our
[17:00] hearts. Lord,
[17:02] may you prepare to minister
[17:06] that you could speak through them. Lord,
[17:08] that it be your words that come out, not
[17:11] a man's.
[17:13] Lord, we receive it as such.
[17:17] But through the foolishness of
[17:18] preaching, you chose to save souls.
[17:22] Lord, there's ones that are missing now.
[17:24] And
[17:26] could be ones traveling right now.
[17:29] Lord, if you could just
[17:32] put your hand of protection around them,
[17:34] go by and hold them right now, Lord.
[17:40] Lord, we thank you for all that you've
[17:41] done for us, for the wonderful
[17:43] testimonies that you put on the page.
[17:45] And
[17:47] Lord, we know you're you're always
[17:49] there.
[17:52] Lord, we thank you. We ask these things
[17:54] in thy precious, holy name, Lord Jesus
[17:57] Christ. Amen.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him. Tonight, as we sing
[18:04] this song, can we just step out in the
[18:06] aisle and and greet one another? Oh, I
[18:08] came in this evening with my mind.
[18:12] Oh, stay
[18:14] on Jesus.
[18:17] I came in this evening with my mind.
[18:21] Stay on his word.

[32:36] cried day and night before thee. Let my
[32:39] prayer come before thee. Incline thine
[32:42] ear unto my cry, for my soul is full of
[32:46] troubles, and my life drawth nigh unto
[32:49] the grave. I am counted with them that
[32:51] go down into the pit. I am as a man that
[32:54] hath no strength.
[32:57] Free among the dead, like the slain that
[33:00] lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest
[33:02] no more, and they are cut off from thy
[33:04] hand. Thou hast laid me in the lowest
[33:07] pit in darkness, in the deeps. Thy wrath
[33:11] lith hard upon me, and thou hast
[33:13] afflicted me with all thy waves, sa.
[33:17] Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far
[33:19] from me. Thou hast made me an
[33:22] abomination unto them. I am shut up, and
[33:25] I cannot come forth.
[33:27] Mine mourneth by reason of affliction.
[33:30] Lord, I have called daily upon thee. I
[33:34] have stretched out my hands unto thee.
[33:36] Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?
[33:39] Shall the dead arise and praise thee,
[33:41] sailah?
[33:43] Shall thy loving kindness be declared in
[33:45] the grave? Are thy faithfulness in
[33:47] destruction?
[33:49] Shall thy wonders be known in the dark,
[33:52] and thy righteousness in the land of
[33:53] forgetfulness.
[33:55] But unto thee have I cried, O Lord, and
[33:58] in the morning shall my prayer prevent
[34:00] thee. Lord, why castst thou off my soul?
[34:04] Why hideest thou thy face from me? I am
[34:08] afflicted and ready to die. From my
[34:10] youth up, while I suffer thy terrors, I
[34:13] am distracted.
[34:15] Thy fierce wrath goeth over me. Thy
[34:18] tears have cut me off. They came round
[34:21] about me daily like water. They can pass
[34:24] me about together.
[34:26] Lover and friend hast thou put far from
[34:28] me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
[34:32] Let's bow our heads.
[34:36] Lord Jesus, we come into your presence
[34:37] this evening, Lord. And
[34:40] Lord, you know, the the thoughts that
[34:42] I've had, the things that I've been
[34:44] thinking on and and looking at, Lord,
[34:46] and Lord, I pray that you would take my
[34:49] my scattered thoughts, Lord, my the
[34:52] scriptures and quotes that I've been
[34:54] looking at. And Lord, I pray that you
[34:55] would put them together, Lord. That
[34:57] Lord, you would be the one to to take
[35:00] control of what's said this evening,
[35:01] Lord. That you would speak to the hearts
[35:03] of the people, Lord. And Lord, that you
[35:05] would minister to the needs and the the
[35:08] issues that are going on because Lord, I
[35:10] don't know what's going on in everyone's
[35:12] life, but you do. Lord, we pray that you
[35:15] would just
[35:16] receive all the glory for the service,
[35:18] Lord. And may we be able to walk away
[35:20] knowing that we've been in your
[35:21] presence. We just commit the service
[35:24] into your hands. In the name of Lord
[35:25] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. You may
[35:28] have your seats.
[35:32] Now, I know this was probably seemed
[35:34] like a very strange reading compared to
[35:39] a lot of the verses and a lot of the
[35:41] scriptures that that we will go through.
[35:44] You know, Psalm 88 is known by scholars
[35:48] as the darkest psalm.
[35:51] It seems like an odd fit in the
[35:54] scripture because the psalmist is crying
[35:56] out to God in his affliction, but the
[35:58] psalm doesn't end in some glorious touch
[36:02] from the Lord. It it doesn't end with
[36:05] praise like so many other psalms. It it
[36:08] actually ends with darkness.
[36:12] But yet, this psalm is still a part of
[36:15] the Bible. It may be a part that maybe
[36:19] we don't minister out of a lot. Maybe we
[36:21] don't talk about a whole lot, but yet
[36:23] it's still
[36:25] something that has been placed here for
[36:26] a reason.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; You know, our as you go through this
[36:33] this psalm and you look at it and I know
[36:37] that
[36:38] probably a lot of people have been in
[36:41] moments where they felt like they could
[36:42] have been praying this out. They could
[36:45] have been calling out to God in this
[36:47] same way because they felt like they
[36:49] were in that darkest moment. They felt
[36:52] like they were facing
[36:54] the worst trials. They were facing the
[36:56] worst problems. They were dealing with
[36:58] the worst loss. They were going through
[37:01] everything that they could and they
[37:03] could no longer bear it.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; And the psalmist writes this, and I
[37:07] think one of the things that I take away
[37:09] from this is that God doesn't shy away
[37:10] from the darkness. God doesn't shy away
[37:13] from the pain. God doesn't shy away from
[37:16] the struggle. If he wanted to avoid it,
[37:19] he wouldn't have allowed this to be in
[37:20] the Bible. He wouldn't have allowed this
[37:21] to still be there in the psalm. If he
[37:24] wanted us to see that,
[37:27] you know, if we wanted to have the
[37:28] feeling that every dark situation
[37:30] immediately turns around and becomes all
[37:32] glory and happiness, they could have
[37:35] written a couple more verses and
[37:37] switched it up to all right, we've had
[37:39] all darkness, but now here is the light
[37:41] is here. Everything is good, everything
[37:42] is wonderful.
[37:44] But yet God doesn't have that how it's
[37:46] written. Like I said, it actually ends
[37:49] with the word darkness. And it's not
[37:51] saying he has overcome the darkness. He
[37:53] has done this. It's just we went into
[37:56] darkness.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Period. We end the psalm.
[38:01] Can you imagine the first time that the
[38:04] psalmist comes up and
[38:07] this is a
[38:10] a song or psalm for the sons of Kora to
[38:12] the chief musician upon Mahalath Lenoeth
[38:16] mascul of Herman the Ezraite.
[38:20] So he was one of those that was in
[38:23] charge of writing worship.
[38:27] He weren't, this wasn't a psalm of
[38:29] David, but this is one of those that
[38:31] he's in the temple around the temple.
[38:34] His job is to write worship.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being the one listening
[38:41] the first time they come out
[38:44] and sing or chant or however it is that
[38:47] they performed this, you're going in
[38:50] expecting praises to our God. You're so
[38:53] powerful. You're so wonderful. you're so
[38:56] amazing.
[38:57] And it comes out and instead what you
[39:00] hear is the cry of the brokenhearted.
[39:03] Instead, what you hear is the pain of
[39:06] someone going through the struggles of
[39:08] life, someone facing the challenges.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[39:14] &gt;&gt; And you know that it's still the psalm
[39:16] of a believer because he starts out, "Oh
[39:18] Lord God of my salvation."
[39:22] &gt;&gt; He begins going, "Okay, you're the one
[39:23] who saves me. You're the one who takes
[39:25] care of everything. You're
[39:28] all of it.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; And then we go down from there.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; There is no more praise after that.
[39:37] There is no God, you're so powerful.
[39:39] There is no more God, you overcome
[39:42] everything. It's now just the anguished
[39:45] heart crying out and going, Lord,
[39:50] how can I do this?
[39:52] How can I bear
[39:54] what I'm going through?
[39:57] &gt;&gt; How can I bear the struggle
[40:01] that I'm facing?
[40:06] Psalms 139
[40:09] and verse 7.
[40:13] Whether shall I go from thy spirit or
[40:16] wither shall I free from thy flee from
[40:18] thy presence? If I ascend up into
[40:21] heaven, thou art there.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou
[40:26] art there.
[40:28] You see, the darkest psalm is seems like
[40:31] it's so outside of the realm of the
[40:33] normal scriptures, but at the same time,
[40:36] God allows it to be there because he's
[40:38] making it clear in the midst of the
[40:40] darkness, in the midst of the shadow, in
[40:42] the midst of when it seems like
[40:45] everything's wrong, everything has
[40:48] fallen apart,
[40:49] &gt;&gt; you're facing, you're about to break
[40:51] because you can no longer take
[40:53] everything you're going through.
[40:57] But yet, God isn't afraid of the
[40:59] darkness.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; God doesn't shy away from facing the
[41:03] challenges. God doesn't shy away from us
[41:05] when we're pouring out our pain to him.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; When we're sitting there in our
[41:11] struggles and we're crying out to God
[41:14] and we don't even know in that moment
[41:16] how to praise him because it hurts so
[41:19] much.
[41:21] We don't know how to praise him because
[41:23] the struggle is so painful. The the
[41:26] problems seem so vast. The the issues
[41:28] are so strong.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; But yet for the true believer, that
[41:33] doesn't chase us away from God.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; I think one of the reasons that this
[41:39] psalm can be there is because this isn't
[41:41] now the believer rejecting, walking
[41:44] away, and bad mouthing God. This is the
[41:46] believer going, "Lord, you're the only
[41:48] one I can talk to.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that I can pour out
[41:52] to. You're the only one that I can
[41:54] express this to. And in this moment,
[41:57] maybe I can't even see how to ask you to
[42:00] handle it.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; I can't even see you how
[42:05] to praise you in the moment. I can't see
[42:07] how to glorify you. All I can do is pour
[42:08] out what I'm feeling right now."
[42:12] &gt;&gt; And it seems really dark. and it seems
[42:16] really bad.
[42:20] And we hit times as Christians where
[42:22] when we're in that moment,
[42:24] Satan wants to make you feel ashamed
[42:26] that that's all you can do.
[42:30] That all you can do is cry out and go,
[42:32] "Lord, I'm hurting
[42:34] &gt;&gt; and I don't know what else to say.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know where else to go. Lord, I'm
[42:40] looking in your scripture right now.
[42:41] Those comforting words aren't providing
[42:43] a whole lot of comfort.
[42:45] Right now, I'm looking at those and
[42:48] yeah, it sounds real nice, but from
[42:50] where I'm standing, I don't feel it.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to embrace it.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; But yet, God puts a psalm like this and
[43:00] he's going, "Just talk to me. Tell me
[43:04] what you're feeling. Tell me what you're
[43:06] going through.
[43:10] And no, this isn't going to immediately
[43:12] in this moment suddenly all problems are
[43:15] gone and everything is turned to roses.
[43:19] God isn't a vending machine. God isn't
[43:22] an Amazon order that we can, okay, we've
[43:24] got next day shipping. We'll have this
[43:26] solved.
[43:30] But God is with us in the struggle. And
[43:34] God doesn't shy away from it. And all
[43:38] too often
[43:41] when we're in the middle of the trial,
[43:44] when it seems like it's at its darkest,
[43:48] we're about to get our deliverance.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; It seems like we've come to the end. It
[43:56] seems like we have nowhere else to go,
[44:00] but yet it's right around the corner
[44:02] that the Lord has something for us.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:08] Exodus chapter 12
[44:10] starting at verse 21.
[44:16] Then Moses called for all the elders of
[44:18] Israel and said unto them, "Draw out and
[44:21] take you a lamb according to your
[44:22] families and kill the Passover. And you
[44:25] shall take a bunch of hissup and dip it
[44:27] in the blood that is in the basin and
[44:29] strike the lentil and the two sideposts
[44:32] with the blood that is in the basin. And
[44:34] none of you shall go out at the door of
[44:36] his house until the morning. For the
[44:38] Lord will pass through to smite the
[44:40] Egyptians. And when he seeth the blood
[44:42] upon the lentil and on the two
[44:43] sideposts, the Lord will pass over the
[44:45] door, and will not suffer the destroyer
[44:48] to come in unto the your houses to
[44:50] smite. And you shall observe this thing
[44:52] for an ordinance to thee, and to thy
[44:54] sons forever. And it shall come to pass
[44:57] when you come to the land which the Lord
[44:58] will give you, according as he hath
[45:00] promised, then you shall keep this
[45:02] service. And it shall come to pass when
[45:04] your children say unto you, "What mean
[45:06] ye by this service?" that you shall say,
[45:08] "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's
[45:10] Passover, who passed over the house of
[45:13] the children of Israel in Egypt? When he
[45:15] smoked the Egyptians and delivered our
[45:17] houses and the people bowed the head and
[45:20] worshiped, and the children of Israel
[45:22] went away and did as the Lord had
[45:23] commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
[45:26] And it came to pass that at midnight the
[45:28] Lord smoteed all the firstborn in the
[45:30] land of Egypt, from the firstborn of
[45:32] Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the
[45:33] firstborn of the captive that was in the
[45:35] dungeon, and all the firstborn of
[45:37] cattle. And Pharaoh rose up in the
[45:40] night, he and his servants, and all the
[45:41] Egyptians. And there was a great cry in
[45:43] Egypt, for there was not a house where
[45:45] there was not one dead.
[45:49] In the sermon, Israel and the church
[45:51] number three preached in 1953, brother
[45:54] Brandham's talking about this and
[45:58] as he does so often,
[46:00] he turns it into a drama.
[46:05] Let's just give a little drama for the
[46:07] children. We We want them to catch it,
[46:09] too. Now, watch. Here they are in the
[46:11] house. It's almost that zero hour.
[46:14] Things are beginning to happen. I see
[46:16] them running home from the dance.
[46:18] They're they're getting in. They're
[46:20] they're they're coming home. The
[46:21] carriages are driving fast. The hard
[46:23] winds blowing. They can't tell where
[46:25] it's coming from. It's twisting this way
[46:26] and that way. If there isn't a time like
[46:29] that now, I don't know where it is. They
[46:32] don't know what to do this way and that
[46:33] way. The first thing you know, I hear a
[46:36] great hum and a roar coming through the
[46:37] land. I see an old priestly father
[46:40] walking up and down the floor just as
[46:41] sturdy as he could be. I hear a little
[46:44] boy say, "Daddy, I'm the oldest in this
[46:46] house. I'm kind of scared. Don't worry,
[46:49] son. The blood is on the door. Well,
[46:51] what's all? I never heard the wind sound
[46:53] like that, Daddy. That's the judgment of
[46:55] God. I can see the little fellow say,
[46:58] "Daddy, go out and take a look and be
[47:00] sure the blood's there." I can see the
[47:03] little boy and girl hold hands and go to
[47:05] the window. Say, "Daddy, come here. Look
[47:07] here." I look across Egypt. Coming
[47:10] across Egypt, two big black wings folded
[47:12] back and forth. What is it? Death. I see
[47:16] it swoop down like this. I hear a scream
[47:18] come up from the house. There was no
[47:20] blood there. Death struck the family.
[47:22] Separation.
[47:24] It's passing over tonight too, brother.
[47:26] Not physical, spiritual. As they led the
[47:29] natural, he's leading the spiritual
[47:30] today. That was an example, a shadow. I
[47:33] see that yonder and hear the woman run
[47:35] out screaming and all the family like
[47:36] that. The elder son was dead. I can hear
[47:40] the the daddy go, the little fellow go
[47:42] shake his daddy saying, "Daddy, daddy,
[47:43] go look again. Be sure. I can see the
[47:46] old father go back to the door and say,
[47:48] "Yes, son." She's there. Are you sure
[47:51] we're protected, Daddy? Yes, sir. How do
[47:54] you know? God said, "When I see the
[47:56] blood, I'll pass over you." That's
[47:57] right. Watching for the blood. Here come
[48:00] the angels moving again. I see it move
[48:02] up, swerve from place to place. I see it
[48:05] make a dive and go down over a house,
[48:06] then turn back up again. I seen the
[48:09] blood. Here it comes to this house. I
[48:12] see it coming. And the little fellow
[48:13] say, "Oh, Daddy, you sure? We're
[48:15] perfectly sure, son." And the angel
[48:18] slips down to the door, spreads its big
[48:19] wings to go in, sees the blood, and
[48:22] takes its flight away. Hallelujah.
[48:24] What's the matter? He's seen the blood.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel had been in
[48:31] affliction for so long, and
[48:34] they had seen the different plagues that
[48:36] came. And Goan had been the safe space.
[48:40] It had been the place where it didn't
[48:42] strike.
[48:44] But yet for this plague, Goan was
[48:47] included.
[48:49] God didn't just say, "Oh, there's a
[48:50] barrier around here. Anyone in this land
[48:52] is safe." He said, "You have to put up
[48:55] the blood. You have to apply the token."
[49:01] And as brother Brandham describes here,
[49:03] you have I'm sure that there were plenty
[49:06] of firstborn children that were young
[49:08] enough they had no clue what was going
[49:09] on. But any of those that were old
[49:11] enough, any of those that were old
[49:14] enough to understand,
[49:16] you can easily see that playing out
[49:18] house after house going, "Are you sure?
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Are you sure that I'm not going to die?
[49:24] Are you sure that we have done
[49:25] everything we're supposed to?
[49:30] There were probably some of those that
[49:32] they were beginning to wonder, was
[49:33] freedom really worth this? Was getting
[49:36] out of Egypt really worth
[49:39] dealing with this?
[49:43] Hearing the screams coming down from a
[49:45] few streets over,
[49:47] hearing the sobs in the morning because
[49:49] somebody hadn't applied the blood.
[49:51] Somebody hadn't done what they had been
[49:54] commanded to do.
[49:58] It was the darkest moment that they had
[50:00] faced, but yet it was also the moment
[50:03] right before they would receive their
[50:05] deliverance.
[50:08] They were holding out one more night
[50:11] before they would be told, "Get out
[50:14] before Pharaoh would say, get out. Take
[50:17] everything with you. Just leave."
[50:20] Yes,
[50:22] &gt;&gt; they had faced
[50:24] the darkest moment,
[50:27] especially
[50:29] for those oldest children, especially
[50:32] for those firstborn that they were old
[50:34] enough and but they were still under
[50:36] their parents' household.
[50:41] So, how could it be if you were the
[50:43] oldest and you were in the household
[50:44] where
[50:46] your parents didn't believe, they didn't
[50:48] want to apply the token,
[50:51] but that's where you are. That's the
[50:52] place you've been.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Or you could be the children, as brother
[50:59] Brandon would talk about in other places
[51:00] where they're going,
[51:02] "That's Johnny's mom. I recognize her
[51:05] voice. I played with Johnny.
[51:07] We were out there playing this morning
[51:09] and we were out there playing yesterday.
[51:17] We can wa we can read through the story
[51:18] and so often we read through these
[51:21] different tales and
[51:24] we don't really allow ourselves to think
[51:26] about it too much. It's like, yeah, we
[51:29] know the story of of Exodus. Yeah, we
[51:32] know the story of this.
[51:35] But yet to put yourself there and start
[51:36] to add some humanity to it and go, "What
[51:39] were they actually feeling?"
[51:42] How confident would the father truly be?
[51:48] He had put up the blood. He had done
[51:50] what he was told. But did he really
[51:53] completely believe that that was going
[51:55] to save his son?
[51:58] Or was he sitting there in some fear
[52:00] going, "I I really hope that this works.
[52:05] I really,
[52:07] Lord, I'm trying to have faith.
[52:11] Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief.
[52:14] How many of the fathers were in that
[52:16] moment? You can't tell me every one of
[52:17] the fathers in in Israel at that moment
[52:20] was going, I have complete faith. I know
[52:22] I have there's no shadow of a doubt that
[52:25] the death angel will pass over me.
[52:28] as you hear screams slowly getting
[52:31] closer and closer to your house.
[52:35] The mothers that were there that their
[52:38] father, their husband had been the one
[52:40] to to put the blood on the door,
[52:44] but she's starting to wonder now. She's
[52:46] starting to go, "Am I about to see my
[52:48] firstborn die?"
[52:52] &gt;&gt; I'm sure there were some that they had
[52:54] all the faith in Moses that they could
[52:56] have.
[52:59] There were others that
[53:02] they had faith, but they were still
[53:03] human.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; They were still people.
[53:08] And hearing the scream, seeing the pain,
[53:10] it started to get a little more real.
[53:14] This wasn't some nice Bible story that
[53:16] we tell in Sunday school. This wasn't
[53:19] the cleaned up version that we offer to
[53:20] the little kids. This was reality.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; And it was really dark.
[53:28] But yet the deliverance was right around
[53:30] the corner.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandon would talk
[53:37] about in other places talking about the
[53:41] the three Hebrew children
[53:45] and he tells the story in the sermon
[53:47] witnesses.
[53:49] And here you have Shadrach, Meshach, and
[53:52] Abednego that
[53:55] they have made their stand.
[53:59] They have refused to bow.
[54:03] And they stand before King
[54:06] Nebuchadnezzar. And
[54:08] he gives them one more chance. Bow the
[54:10] knee.
[54:12] when the trumpets blow, when all the the
[54:16] musicians sound
[54:18] and they say, "No, we will not bow the
[54:23] knee. We will not worship."
[54:27] And in our mind, when we picture this,
[54:31] we think, "Okay, he immediately decrees,
[54:33] go throw them into the into the pit. Go
[54:37] throw them into the fire. Go throw them
[54:38] into the furnace."
[54:41] But yet the scripture says he heated it
[54:44] seven times hotter. Do you know how long
[54:46] that would take?
[54:49] This is not a short process. This is not
[54:51] turn up the gas to get it going. This is
[54:55] we have to keep carting more and more
[54:57] fuel,
[54:59] more than likely wood of some sort or
[55:01] coal or something. This is and this is
[55:04] not immediately dump it in and it's
[55:05] immediately seven times hotter.
[55:08] Seven times hotter is going to take a
[55:10] while.
[55:12] Even if it was all natural gas, to get
[55:15] seven times hotter is going to take a
[55:17] while. But they didn't even have that.
[55:20] And brother Brandham as he's dramatizing
[55:22] this, he talks about they went into an
[55:24] allnight prayer meeting
[55:28] cuz it probably took them that long to
[55:30] heat the thing up.
[55:32] This wasn't a we're standing boldly for
[55:34] our faith. You immediately decree and we
[55:37] get dragged off in that moment. No, this
[55:39] was a they decree we're going to die and
[55:42] now we have to stand here and watch
[55:47] for hour after hour after hour seeing
[55:51] them haul more and more
[55:53] coal or wood or whatever it was they
[55:55] were using up to this.
[56:01] I hadn't caught that before until I was
[56:03] reading through and Brother Random
[56:06] talked about it being an all night
[56:07] prayer meeting.
[56:09] I'd never really thought about that. I
[56:12] just pictured in my head he decrees they
[56:14] drag him off and they try to throw him
[56:17] in. The guys who went to throw him in
[56:19] die. We all know this part of the story.
[56:23] But once again, let's let's run this
[56:24] into the human component.
[56:27] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego had made
[56:29] their stand.
[56:33] And now
[56:37] the devil decides that he's going to ice
[56:39] the picture.
[56:41] Let's call a timeout. We're going to
[56:43] heat this thing up seven times. And you
[56:45] just have to stand there and watch. You
[56:47] don't get to face your big moment yet.
[56:50] You have to wait.
[56:54] And you have to watch
[56:57] this get brighter and brighter from the
[56:59] flames. You have to get where more than
[57:03] likely from where they could sit, they
[57:04] could probably start feeling the heat
[57:07] building.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe they were sitting far enough that
[57:12] at first they couldn't even feel the
[57:13] heat from the furnace,
[57:16] but then they kept throwing in more fuel
[57:18] and more fuel and they start to feel the
[57:20] waves. The wind is getting hotter as it
[57:22] blows around.
[57:25] and they start getting
[57:28] more and more heat just from where
[57:31] they're sitting.
[57:34] And brother Brandham as he's
[57:36] dramatizing, he talks about the next
[57:37] morning as they're being led there,
[57:41] one asks the other, "Are you prayed up?
[57:45] Are you ready?"
[57:48] You've had all night to think about,
[57:50] "Are you going to recant?
[57:54] This isn't great in the emotion. We've
[57:56] stood up. We're strong. We're ready.
[57:59] Take us to the furnace. No, let's give
[58:01] you a day or two.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[58:05] &gt;&gt; of just sitting there.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like sometimes you'll
[58:13] come through and
[58:17] we'll have a wonderful meetings like we
[58:19] recently had. You come through the
[58:21] prayer line, you feel the spirit on you.
[58:25] You can feel God's doing something.
[58:29] And then the next day comes
[58:33] and
[58:34] that problem hasn't been dealt with yet.
[58:38] And another day comes and another day
[58:40] comes
[58:42] and that problem still hasn't been dealt
[58:44] with.
[58:46] Maybe it's even beginning to look worse
[58:48] than it was before.
[58:51] Maybe you're starting to feel more
[58:53] symptoms than you did before. Maybe
[58:55] you're starting to see debts mount up.
[58:57] Maybe you're starting to see this
[58:59] problem or that problem.
[59:02] You would thought things were bad enough
[59:06] and then the devil decides he's going to
[59:07] turn up the heat.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; To see if you really got what you said
[59:13] you did.
[59:16] You were able to take that stand. Yes.
[59:18] Yes, I know God is a healer. Yes, I know
[59:20] God is a provider. Yes, I know God can
[59:22] do whatever it is that I need.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And Satan says, "Time out. Let's ice the
[59:31] pitcher."
[59:34] He doesn't get to throw the last ball
[59:35] yet. He doesn't get to face the batter
[59:38] doesn't get to face the last pitch yet.
[59:40] He's got to wait.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; We're icing the hitter. We're icing the
[59:45] pitcher. Take your pick.
[59:47] Let's see if we can get a little more
[59:49] nerves there. Let's see if we can let
[59:50] them feel the pressure a little more.
[59:52] Let's see if we can get them to choke in
[59:54] the moment.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; What can we do to pile it on to make it
[59:58] seem even worse than it was before they
[1:00:00] went through that prayer line? Before
[1:00:02] they went up to the altar, before they
[1:00:04] were in their prayer room and they got
[1:00:05] something.
[1:00:07] Let's make it seem even worse than it
[1:00:09] was then.
[1:00:12] How can we pile a little bit more on
[1:00:13] there? How can we throw a little more
[1:00:15] fuel on the fire?
[1:00:18] How can we make it seem a little bit
[1:00:20] darker?
[1:00:23] Are they still going to hold on?
[1:00:26] Are they still going to hold on through
[1:00:28] the pain? Are they still going to hold
[1:00:30] on
[1:00:32] after they thought they had their
[1:00:35] freedom? They thought they had
[1:00:38] their release. They thought it was all
[1:00:40] over.
[1:00:42] And then they realize it's just coming.
[1:00:44] It hasn't gotten here yet. And now
[1:00:47] things are looking worse.
[1:00:49] And now the darkness
[1:00:52] is getting even darker.
[1:00:54] And we're beginning to get to the point
[1:00:56] where all I can pray
[1:01:00] is my sorrow. All I can pray is my call
[1:01:04] out to God because I don't even know
[1:01:07] what to do anymore.
[1:01:14] But yet, as brother Brandham's
[1:01:15] dramatizing it and here they are and
[1:01:18] they're going, "Are you prayed up? Are
[1:01:20] you ready?"
[1:01:22] Brother Brandham then switches
[1:01:26] viewpoints and he leaves the three
[1:01:29] Hebrew children as they're walking and
[1:01:31] being led towards the furnace and he
[1:01:33] goes up into heaven
[1:01:36] and he has
[1:01:38] here's the archangel Michael
[1:01:41] comes to God and goes, "God, have you
[1:01:43] looked down there? Do you see your three
[1:01:46] children
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; that they've made their stand and
[1:01:49] they've held on to it through all the
[1:01:51] hours of the furnace heating? They've
[1:01:54] held on through all the darkness.
[1:01:57] Let me go down there. I'll change the
[1:01:58] situation right now.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:02:03] no, Michael, you just you hang back.
[1:02:07] Then Wormwood comes up and God, have you
[1:02:10] been watching this? Have you been
[1:02:12] looking down on earth? Have you seen
[1:02:14] your three children
[1:02:17] who they've held on hour after hour as
[1:02:20] they watched the furnace get hotter?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; They held on through each time that the
[1:02:26] devil has come down and whispered in
[1:02:28] their ears. Each time the devil has come
[1:02:30] down and whispered in their mind, "Lord,
[1:02:32] let me go down. I'll flood out that
[1:02:35] furnace. I'll destroy them all. I'll
[1:02:38] change the situation.
[1:02:44] And God says, "No, Wormwood, you're a
[1:02:46] good angel,
[1:02:48] but you just wait back there
[1:02:53] because I've decided I'm going to handle
[1:02:55] this personally.
[1:02:57] This isn't something I'm going to send
[1:02:59] one of the angels to deal with.
[1:03:02] This isn't something where I'm going to
[1:03:04] send an agent.
[1:03:07] This is where I'm going to step in
[1:03:09] myself.
[1:03:11] And God didn't step in as they were
[1:03:13] walking up to the furnace.
[1:03:17] God didn't step in when they opened the
[1:03:20] doors, when they opened the great, when
[1:03:22] they did whatever.
[1:03:26] He didn't step in
[1:03:28] through every step of the way.
[1:03:33] And those three Hebrew children didn't
[1:03:34] know what kind of conversation was going
[1:03:36] on in heaven. They didn't know what was
[1:03:38] about to happen.
[1:03:40] They had come to accept, they had come
[1:03:42] to grips with the idea that the darkness
[1:03:45] is going to consume us here. We'll get
[1:03:47] light on the other side.
[1:03:50] They had come to grips with the idea
[1:03:53] that they weren't coming out of this.
[1:03:58] They knew God could,
[1:04:01] but they had accepted at that point.
[1:04:07] Let's be honest, as human beings at that
[1:04:11] point, every one of us probably would
[1:04:13] accepted, okay, God's not going to save
[1:04:15] me.
[1:04:18] I know he can.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; But in that moment,
[1:04:22] now maybe I'm only talking to myself.
[1:04:24] Maybe all of you just have so much faith
[1:04:26] that you would never have even thought
[1:04:27] about it. Be like, "No, God is going to
[1:04:28] save me the whole way through.
[1:04:32] Maybe I'm the only one who'd be like,
[1:04:33] "All right, Lord. I'll see you in heaven
[1:04:35] in a few minutes.
[1:04:39] It's we're done." If God was going to
[1:04:42] save me, he would have saved me back
[1:04:43] there. He would have changed
[1:04:44] Nebuchadnezzar's heart. He would have
[1:04:47] Daniel would have shown up and talked to
[1:04:50] Nebuchadnezzar and set us free.
[1:04:52] something would have happened.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; There is no way God would have let it go
[1:04:57] this far.
[1:04:59] There is no way God would let me go up
[1:05:02] to the point where I've only got one
[1:05:04] more step and I'm going right into the
[1:05:06] fire.
[1:05:08] One more step and the people pushing me
[1:05:10] are already dropping beside me.
[1:05:19] I would have already
[1:05:22] accepted and been like, "Okay, Lord, I'm
[1:05:25] about to see you in your throne.
[1:05:27] That's where I'm at."
[1:05:32] But in that darkest of moments
[1:05:37] was when God would come down and they
[1:05:41] would now be joined by the fourth man in
[1:05:42] the fire
[1:05:46] and they wouldn't be feeling the heat
[1:05:47] anymore. They wouldn't be feeling the
[1:05:49] flames.
[1:05:52] They were right. They were about to be
[1:05:54] in the presence of God, but they were
[1:05:55] wrong with where that presence was going
[1:05:57] to be.
[1:05:59] They thought they were going to be in
[1:06:00] his presence on the other side.
[1:06:03] And God said, "No, I'm going to bring my
[1:06:04] presence to you
[1:06:08] because
[1:06:11] you're now going to get your
[1:06:12] deliverance.
[1:06:14] It's now time for me to show my power.
[1:06:17] It's now time for me to show that you
[1:06:20] holding on this whole time has been
[1:06:22] worth it.
[1:06:28] Acts chapter 16 and verse 22.
[1:06:35] And the multitude rose up together
[1:06:37] against them. And the magistrates ran
[1:06:39] off their clothes and commanded to beat
[1:06:40] them. And when they had laid many
[1:06:43] stripes upon them, they cast them into
[1:06:44] prison, charging the jailer to keep them
[1:06:46] safely,
[1:06:49] who having received such a charge,
[1:06:51] thrust them into the inner prison, and
[1:06:53] made their feet fast in the stalks.
[1:06:56] And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed,
[1:06:58] and sang praises unto God, and the
[1:07:00] prisoners heard them. And suddenly there
[1:07:02] was a great earthquake, so that the
[1:07:04] foundation of the prison was shaken. And
[1:07:06] immediately all the doors were open, and
[1:07:08] everyone's bands were loosed. and the
[1:07:10] keeper of the prison awaking out of his
[1:07:12] sleep. And seeing the prison doors open,
[1:07:14] he drew out his sword and would have
[1:07:15] killed himself, supposing that the
[1:07:17] prisoners had fled. But Paul cried and
[1:07:20] with a loud voice, saying, "Do thyself
[1:07:21] no harm, for we are all here." Then he
[1:07:24] called for a light and sprang in and
[1:07:26] came trembling and fell down before Paul
[1:07:28] and Silas and brought them out and said,
[1:07:30] "Sers, what must I do to be saved?" And
[1:07:33] they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:07:35] Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy
[1:07:37] house." And they spoke unto him the word
[1:07:39] of the Lord, and to all that were in his
[1:07:42] house. And he took them the same hour of
[1:07:44] the night, and washed their stripes, and
[1:07:45] was baptized, he and all his, straight
[1:07:48] away.
[1:07:50] And when he had brought them into his
[1:07:51] house, he said, "Meet before them," and
[1:07:53] rejoiced, believing in God with all his
[1:07:55] house.
[1:08:06] Paul and Silas were preaching. They had
[1:08:10] Paul had just cast
[1:08:13] the spirit out of
[1:08:15] a woman that did divination and
[1:08:18] her owner because she was a slave was
[1:08:21] now ticked off because he had lost all
[1:08:23] the money that he would get from what
[1:08:26] she did and what people believed that
[1:08:28] she could do.
[1:08:31] And so
[1:08:34] Paul preaches to them.
[1:08:37] The mob assembles,
[1:08:40] grabs him and Silas,
[1:08:43] beats them, whips them,
[1:08:47] casts them into prison.
[1:08:51] They're now chained up in the prison.
[1:08:56] And the only thing you can truly expect
[1:08:58] at this point is the next thing to come
[1:09:00] is they're going to execute us in the
[1:09:03] morning.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; We've been beaten within an inch of our
[1:09:06] lives. We've been whipped. We've got
[1:09:08] stripes all over us.
[1:09:11] We've been thrown into prison. So,
[1:09:12] they're holding us for some reason,
[1:09:15] which means they're planning on doing
[1:09:17] more.
[1:09:20] If they weren't going to do any more,
[1:09:21] they wouldn't have thrown us in jail.
[1:09:22] They would have just sent us on our way.
[1:09:24] But they've put us into into jail. We're
[1:09:27] here with all the criminals around us.
[1:09:36] And the human mind at least goes, "Okay,
[1:09:39] this is our last night.
[1:09:43] Tomorrow, whichever kind of capital
[1:09:46] punishment they use
[1:09:51] is probably going to happen to us.
[1:09:57] Once again, we all know the story and so
[1:10:01] all too often we skip over the other
[1:10:03] parts because we know how it ends.
[1:10:06] We already see the ending in these
[1:10:08] stories and so we don't spend
[1:10:10] necessarily a lot of time thinking about
[1:10:12] what were they feeling in the middle?
[1:10:16] What were they going through?
[1:10:21] Okay, you can go on. Paul was a prophet.
[1:10:26] He's staying there. He's got all the
[1:10:27] faith. He's got everything. What about
[1:10:29] Silas?
[1:10:32] He was Paul's traveling companion,
[1:10:34] but he wasn't the prophet. He wasn't the
[1:10:37] messenger to that age.
[1:10:40] He didn't know what was going on.
[1:10:44] He just knows I've been beaten. I've
[1:10:47] been whipped. I've been thrown in jail.
[1:10:50] I don't know that I'm going to survive.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Let's allow some humanity in here. Silas
[1:11:00] is probably not sitting there all super
[1:11:03] high in his faith going, "Absolutely, I
[1:11:05] know the Lord is going to set us free
[1:11:07] and we're going to be preaching again
[1:11:08] tomorrow.
[1:11:10] Hey, the Lord's going to set us free and
[1:11:13] we're going to convert a whole household
[1:11:16] out of this." None of those thoughts are
[1:11:18] in his head.
[1:11:21] I'm sure he's still holding on to his
[1:11:23] faith, but maybe he's already thinking,
[1:11:25] "Okay, we're going to be the next
[1:11:26] Christian martyrs.
[1:11:28] We're going to have the witness like
[1:11:30] Stephen, or we're going to have the
[1:11:31] witness like some of the apostles that
[1:11:33] have already been executed. We're going
[1:11:36] to have that kind of witness.
[1:11:40] That's what's coming tomorrow."
[1:11:43] And he was holding on
[1:11:45] to his faith. He was holding on to his
[1:11:47] belief. All right, Lord. I'm going to
[1:11:49] come see you.
[1:11:52] Okay, Lord.
[1:11:54] I don't see any way out of this.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; He's probably having some prayer time
[1:12:01] going, "All right, Lord, if there's
[1:12:02] anything that I've said wrong, anything
[1:12:04] I've done wrong, Lord, forgive me. I
[1:12:06] want to come before you with a clear
[1:12:08] conscience. I want everything to be
[1:12:10] under the blood when I come into your
[1:12:13] presence.
[1:12:17] These were human beings.
[1:12:20] These were human beings that faced
[1:12:21] struggles. These were human beings
[1:12:24] that dealt with problems.
[1:12:27] And they were human beings that had the
[1:12:29] same kind of minds that we have.
[1:12:34] But yet in the midst of the darkness, in
[1:12:36] the midst of all the problems,
[1:12:39] they start singing. They start
[1:12:40] worshiping.
[1:12:42] Now, I don't know.
[1:12:46] Maybe it was Paul that started it.
[1:12:49] Maybe he was trying to encourage his
[1:12:51] brother that was beside him.
[1:12:54] Maybe Silas found some inner reserve of
[1:12:57] strength that God had given him that he
[1:12:59] could start singing
[1:13:02] because he would knew that he was going
[1:13:03] to be in glory the next day, that he was
[1:13:05] going to be with his savior and so he
[1:13:07] could worship in that moment.
[1:13:12] I don't know which one started it,
[1:13:18] but here here are these two singing. You
[1:13:20] know, probably at least one of them was
[1:13:22] kind of off key.
[1:13:25] I doubt they both had pitch perfect
[1:13:26] voices and things,
[1:13:29] but yet they're singing, they're
[1:13:30] worshiping, they're praising the Lord in
[1:13:32] the midst of the darkness.
[1:13:35] And then the Lord comes on the scene and
[1:13:37] sets them free.
[1:13:41] And the Lord uses that to
[1:13:44] save this family and bring them all into
[1:13:47] him.
[1:13:51] In the midst of the darkness,
[1:13:55] right around the corner was the
[1:13:56] deliverance that was coming.
[1:14:03] And I know there's I found myself all
[1:14:06] too often in life in in the situation
[1:14:08] where I can look back at some of these
[1:14:10] stories and I'll go, "Yeah, but Lord,
[1:14:12] what I'm dealing with right now is
[1:14:13] because of my stupidity. This isn't
[1:14:15] because I was doing something for you.
[1:14:17] This isn't because I was
[1:14:21] testifying and now I'm being persecuted
[1:14:23] for it. This is because of my own bad
[1:14:27] decisions or my own stupidity or my own
[1:14:29] foolishness or my own whatever.
[1:14:33] Lord, all this trouble in front of me,
[1:14:34] it's my fault.
[1:14:39] That always makes it seem a little bit
[1:14:41] darker.
[1:14:42] When you look at the situation, you're
[1:14:44] going, I brought this on myself.
[1:14:48] When you're looking at the situation and
[1:14:49] going,
[1:14:52] I can't blame anyone but me.
[1:14:54] I'm not looking at this and going, "Hey,
[1:14:56] I happen to be caught in
[1:14:59] a town where they now had a famine
[1:15:02] and so there's no food." I'm not talking
[1:15:05] about a situation where our entire race
[1:15:08] was thrown into captivity. I'm not
[1:15:10] talking about a situation where I was
[1:15:13] doing my best to take a stand for the
[1:15:15] Lord. I was doing my best to be a
[1:15:17] witness. I was doing this, that, or the
[1:15:18] other. I was being dumb.
[1:15:24] And now I'm dealing with whatever.
[1:15:28] I'm dealing with whatever problems. I'm
[1:15:30] dealing with whatever struggles and I'm
[1:15:32] not seeing a way out.
[1:15:40] Brother Brandham always talked about how
[1:15:43] he liked Jonah.
[1:15:46] You know what? Jonah was in kind of the
[1:15:48] same spot.
[1:15:52] Jonas, he's in the fish that God
[1:15:55] prepared for him. He's not sitting there
[1:15:57] going,
[1:16:00] I was on my way to where I was supposed
[1:16:02] to do and there was a shipwreck and now
[1:16:05] the the whale swallowed me and Lord,
[1:16:08] what are you doing?
[1:16:11] He was sitting there going, I was
[1:16:13] running from God. I was going the
[1:16:15] direction I wasn't supposed to. This is
[1:16:17] all my fault.
[1:16:22] Now,
[1:16:24] brother Brandham talked to taught us the
[1:16:27] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:16:28] of the Lord.
[1:16:31] That's where he was supposed to be.
[1:16:34] He was going to a people who worshiped
[1:16:36] the fish god. There was a reason for God
[1:16:39] to allow all this to happen.
[1:16:41] But Jonah didn't know that in that
[1:16:43] moment.
[1:16:45] Jonah wasn't sitting in the in the in
[1:16:47] the belly of the fish going, "All right,
[1:16:51] Lord. I know that you're ordering my
[1:16:53] steps. You had a reason for this whole
[1:16:54] thing.
[1:16:56] I'm trusting you to get me where I'm
[1:16:57] supposed to go and do what I'm supposed
[1:16:59] to do."
[1:17:02] No. In that moment, he might have been
[1:17:05] rehearsing Psalm 88. He might have been
[1:17:08] rehearsing
[1:17:11] different worship that he had heard over
[1:17:13] the years, crying out
[1:17:16] some of the different psalms where David
[1:17:17] is crying out his pain, crying out his
[1:17:19] problems.
[1:17:23] They memorized a lot of those things as
[1:17:24] part of their worship. I'm sure Jonah
[1:17:27] was praying his own words and then he
[1:17:28] was probably pulling up some of his
[1:17:29] memories.
[1:17:34] and Jonah in the darkness. Could it get
[1:17:36] any darker?
[1:17:38] He's in the middle at the bottom of the
[1:17:41] sea in the middle of a fish. There is no
[1:17:43] light.
[1:17:46] He can't see anything. There is no
[1:17:51] I He didn't have a candle. He didn't
[1:17:53] have a lantern.
[1:17:56] Somehow, I kind of doubt that God put
[1:17:57] like glow-in-the-dark plankton in there
[1:17:59] or something to try to give him some
[1:18:00] light.
[1:18:02] He's probably, "All right, let's you
[1:18:03] let's let you sit in the dark for a
[1:18:05] while.
[1:18:08] Come on, let's think about this." I see
[1:18:10] some people laughing as I'm talking
[1:18:11] about it, but
[1:18:15] this was not He wasn't sitting there in
[1:18:18] all of his fa faith thinking, "All
[1:18:20] right, Lord, you've got a reason for
[1:18:22] this. We're going somewhere. We're going
[1:18:24] to do something. I can't wait to see
[1:18:26] what you're about to do.
[1:18:31] He's sitting there going, "Lord, I'm so
[1:18:34] sorry. I messed up.
[1:18:39] It's my fault.
[1:18:43] I went the wrong way. I did the wrong
[1:18:45] thing after what you told me to do.
[1:18:48] After you gave me the instructions, I
[1:18:50] went the wrong way."
[1:18:52] And not accidentally. I did this on
[1:18:54] purpose.
[1:18:56] I went down and I bought a ticket.
[1:19:00] And they probably had on there, ticket
[1:19:03] to Nineveh.
[1:19:05] Ticket to Tarsus. I want Tarsus. Are you
[1:19:08] sure? We've got a special deal on
[1:19:09] Nineveh tickets today. I want Tarsus.
[1:19:12] Well, it's kind of full. We've got lots
[1:19:13] of lots of slots going to Nineveh. No, I
[1:19:16] want Tarsus. He had to work his way to
[1:19:19] get there.
[1:19:22] God probably gave him plenty of
[1:19:24] roadblocks where he could have made the
[1:19:25] right decision.
[1:19:26] Because God normally does that for us
[1:19:28] when we're doing the wrong things. He
[1:19:30] keeps trying to put little obstacles to
[1:19:31] go. All right, come on. You can turn
[1:19:33] around. Okay, let's try this again. You
[1:19:36] can turn around now. Okay, fine. You can
[1:19:38] turn around now. Okay, fine. I'm going
[1:19:40] to knock you down.
[1:19:44] He keeps trying to give us little speed
[1:19:47] bumps. Go, okay, you're going the wrong
[1:19:48] way.
[1:19:52] You're making the wrong decisions.
[1:19:55] I know I've seen the speed bumps in my
[1:19:57] life before and I've kept going top
[1:19:59] speed right over them.
[1:20:02] You know there I didn't even slow down.
[1:20:05] I just boom and you keep going.
[1:20:09] Probably wrecked my car, but I was I was
[1:20:12] going to keep going the way I wanted to
[1:20:13] go.
[1:20:16] And then God finally gets you to that
[1:20:18] point and he's got you in that space
[1:20:20] where
[1:20:22] you're in your darkest moment.
[1:20:25] And you know it's because of your own
[1:20:29] fault, your own decision.
[1:20:37] And Satan wants to spend a lot of time
[1:20:38] reminding you that it's your own fault.
[1:20:43] Why would God help you in this
[1:20:44] situation? You brought this on yourself.
[1:20:48] Why would God bring you out of this? You
[1:20:49] know, you made bad choice after bad
[1:20:52] choice after bad choice after bad
[1:20:54] choice.
[1:20:56] Why in the world would God want to work
[1:20:57] with you anymore?
[1:21:00] Please tell me I'm not the only one
[1:21:01] that's ever had this conversation roll
[1:21:03] out in my head.
[1:21:08] And yet, even in the middle of that
[1:21:11] darkness,
[1:21:16] God is still a present help in times of
[1:21:19] trouble. It doesn't say that he's only a
[1:21:22] present help in times of trouble if you
[1:21:24] didn't cause it yourself.
[1:21:27] It doesn't say he's a present help in
[1:21:29] times of trouble when it wasn't your own
[1:21:32] stupidity.
[1:21:37] But God will take that moment in that
[1:21:40] darkness that you brought on yourself
[1:21:44] to bring you closer to him
[1:21:47] to let you
[1:21:50] see his light brighter than you would
[1:21:51] have any other time.
[1:21:54] And he'll bring you out of that darkness
[1:21:56] into your deliverance.
[1:22:02] Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 10.
[1:22:07] The name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[1:22:11] The righteous runth into it and is safe.
[1:22:18] Joel chapter 2 and verse 32.
[1:22:25] And it shall come to pass that whosoever
[1:22:28] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[1:22:30] be delivered. For in Mount Zion and in
[1:22:32] Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the
[1:22:34] Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom
[1:22:36] the Lord shall call out.
[1:22:40] And Isaiah chapter 32
[1:22:43] starting at verse one.
[1:22:47] Behold, a king shall reign in
[1:22:48] righteousness, and princes shall rule in
[1:22:51] judgment, and a man shall be as an
[1:22:53] hiding place from the wind, and a covert
[1:22:55] from the tempest, as rivers of water in
[1:22:58] a dry place, as the shadow of a great
[1:23:00] rock in a weary land.
[1:23:09] Satan goes when we're going through
[1:23:13] trials, when we're going through
[1:23:15] temptations, when we're going through
[1:23:16] problems, when we're going through the
[1:23:18] ramifications of our own poor choices.
[1:23:23] And Satan will do his best to ramp it up
[1:23:26] even further.
[1:23:29] Satan loves to to heat the furnace seven
[1:23:32] times hotter.
[1:23:34] He loves to make you watch as bills pile
[1:23:38] upon bills or as symptoms pile upon
[1:23:40] symptoms, as problems pile upon
[1:23:43] problems.
[1:23:47] You had one of your kids acting out
[1:23:48] before. Guess what? We'll make more of
[1:23:51] them act out.
[1:23:53] You were struggling with
[1:23:56] one financial issue. Guess what? Let's
[1:23:59] throw some more at you.
[1:24:01] You thought you were dealing with one
[1:24:04] symptom or one disease. Let's have you
[1:24:07] get diagnosed with more.
[1:24:10] Let's
[1:24:12] heat the furnace.
[1:24:14] Let's make the situation darker. Let's
[1:24:16] make it seem like this is an
[1:24:19] insurmountable
[1:24:20] problem.
[1:24:24] Like there's no chance you can ever get
[1:24:25] out.
[1:24:28] You thought God was going to help you.
[1:24:31] And then it just kept getting worse and
[1:24:33] kept getting worse and kept getting
[1:24:35] worse.
[1:24:39] And now you're at the moment where
[1:24:42] those verses that we'll recite and we'll
[1:24:45] talk about, the name of the Lord is a
[1:24:48] strong tower. The righteous run into it
[1:24:50] and are safe.
[1:24:53] And there are times when that can be
[1:24:55] such a comfort.
[1:24:58] And there are other times where that
[1:25:00] begins to feel like empty words because
[1:25:02] what you're dealing with
[1:25:05] is so intense.
[1:25:07] What you're dealing with is so much.
[1:25:15] We all know those that have gone through
[1:25:18] situations of mourning or we've gone
[1:25:20] through them ourselves. And there are
[1:25:22] times when there are no words.
[1:25:25] You can't go up to a person when they're
[1:25:28] feeling the new grief or they're feeling
[1:25:31] a fresh loss and go, "Well, you know,
[1:25:33] the scriptures say this
[1:25:36] and it
[1:25:39] it won't do a bit of good."
[1:25:41] They're not going to take anything in
[1:25:43] that moment
[1:25:46] when they're dealing with that that
[1:25:48] fresh problem. They're still trying to
[1:25:50] process. They're not at a point of
[1:25:52] going, "Okay, Lord." And that's one of
[1:25:56] those when I look at the the darkest
[1:25:59] psalm, it's like this when they were
[1:26:02] writing this, they could easily been
[1:26:04] they just have experienced some type of
[1:26:07] loss.
[1:26:10] Whether it was a death, whether it was a
[1:26:13] situation like Job where everything's
[1:26:15] taken. Maybe it's this, that, or the
[1:26:17] other. Take your pick.
[1:26:19] But in that moment
[1:26:24] and they're writing out their pain,
[1:26:27] I don't think they were necessarily
[1:26:29] looking for the words of comfort. They
[1:26:31] were just trying to express what they
[1:26:32] were feeling.
[1:26:34] They were trying to express. They were
[1:26:36] trying to process. They were trying in
[1:26:38] some way to get a handle on things
[1:26:42] so that way they could move on to start
[1:26:44] looking for comfort.
[1:26:50] But in that moment
[1:26:52] when someone's going through the pain,
[1:26:58] they're not quite ready to hear it.
[1:27:02] It doesn't mean that they've lost their
[1:27:04] faith. It doesn't mean that they've lost
[1:27:07] their salvation. It doesn't mean they've
[1:27:08] lost anything. It just means they're
[1:27:10] human
[1:27:12] and they have to deal with things a
[1:27:14] little bit.
[1:27:18] But God doesn't turn away from us in
[1:27:20] those moments.
[1:27:22] God doesn't go, "Oh, until you get in a
[1:27:24] good mood, you're over there. I'm over
[1:27:27] here." Okay?
[1:27:29] When you when you get in a better mood,
[1:27:30] I'll come talk to you.
[1:27:36] And I know this is probably one a lot of
[1:27:38] moms are thankful for
[1:27:40] that just the bad mood doesn't
[1:27:42] immediately mean God went, "Okay, I'll
[1:27:45] check in on you later."
[1:27:51] But as we're going through the pain, as
[1:27:53] we're going through the struggle,
[1:27:57] God is right there even when maybe we
[1:27:59] can't recognize him in that moment.
[1:28:02] And God is asking us to keep talking to
[1:28:06] him, to keep praying, to keep the
[1:28:09] conversation going.
[1:28:12] I've been on prayer in my Sunday school
[1:28:15] class for probably four classes now,
[1:28:20] and I've just been trying to over and
[1:28:21] over go, prayer is a conversation.
[1:28:26] And when you are having a conversation
[1:28:28] with someone that is as close to us as
[1:28:30] God is, there are times all you're doing
[1:28:33] is venting.
[1:28:38] Now there are
[1:28:40] we should be praising him. We should be
[1:28:42] worshiping him. We should be telling him
[1:28:44] how wonderful he is, how powerful he is.
[1:28:46] We should be giving him all the praises
[1:28:48] and telling him everything about that.
[1:28:55] But yet the scriptures say that he's
[1:28:56] near to the brokenhearted.
[1:29:00] And in those brokenhearted moments, in
[1:29:02] those moments of darkness, when we can't
[1:29:03] see a way out, God doesn't want us to
[1:29:07] stop talking.
[1:29:11] Even if we can't utter any praise at
[1:29:13] that moment, even if we can't even bring
[1:29:16] ourselves to ask him to get us out of
[1:29:18] it, if all we can do is just express the
[1:29:21] pain, express what we're dealing with,
[1:29:26] God is still right there to hear it. He
[1:29:29] doesn't leave us in the midst of the
[1:29:31] darkness.
[1:29:34] But yet time and time again, we see
[1:29:36] through the scripture where when we're
[1:29:37] in the midst of the darkness, when we're
[1:29:39] at when it seems like it's worst, that's
[1:29:42] when God is about to step in.
[1:29:46] Which means he's not stepping in when we
[1:29:47] want him to. We didn't want it to get
[1:29:50] that dark.
[1:29:52] Like I said, the Hebrew children, they
[1:29:54] didn't expect him to step in in the
[1:29:56] furnace. They thought back there when
[1:30:00] they were having their all night prayer
[1:30:01] meeting, "Lord, change Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:30:05] heart." That was probably their prayer
[1:30:07] that night.
[1:30:10] How many of us have had that? Lord, I
[1:30:12] pray that you would change the heart of
[1:30:13] my boss. Lord, I pray that you would
[1:30:14] change the heart of my
[1:30:17] brother, my sister, my father, my
[1:30:18] mother, my what? Lord, just change their
[1:30:20] heart.
[1:30:22] And we're praying that and we're praying
[1:30:24] that and God's going, "It's not that
[1:30:26] easy.
[1:30:29] I'm not going to let you off the hook
[1:30:30] that easy.
[1:30:32] I want to see just how far you're going
[1:30:34] to take this.
[1:30:36] I want to see how far you trust us.
[1:30:43] Lord, just just touch their heart, Lord.
[1:30:45] Just deal with them,
[1:30:48] Lord. They need you.
[1:30:52] I need you, too. But Lord, they really
[1:30:53] need you.
[1:30:57] I think we've all been there in that
[1:30:58] prayer, too.
[1:31:02] But yet, the Lord allows us to go into
[1:31:04] the darkness.
[1:31:09] Psalms 34:1
[1:31:12] 17,
[1:31:14] the righteous cry, and the Lord heareth,
[1:31:16] and deliverth them out of all their
[1:31:18] troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them
[1:31:20] that are of a broken heart, and saveth
[1:31:22] such as be of a contrite spirit.
[1:31:25] Many are the afflictions of the
[1:31:26] righteous, but the Lord deliverth him
[1:31:28] out of them all.
[1:31:30] Psalms chapter 50
[1:31:33] and verse 14.
[1:31:37] Offer unto God thanksgiving,
[1:31:39] and pay thy vows unto the most high, and
[1:31:43] call upon me in the day of trouble. I
[1:31:45] will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify
[1:31:47] me.
[1:31:50] Psalm chapter 34 and verse4.
[1:31:56] I sought the Lord and he heard me and
[1:31:59] delivered me from all my fears.
[1:32:05] 2 Samuel chapter 22
[1:32:08] and verse two.
[1:32:10] And he said, "The Lord is my rock and my
[1:32:12] fortress and my deliverer. The God of my
[1:32:15] rock, in him will I trust. He is my
[1:32:17] shield and the horn of my salvation, my
[1:32:20] high tower and my refuge, my savior.
[1:32:23] Thou sest me from violence. I will call
[1:32:26] on the Lord who is worthy to be praised.
[1:32:28] So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
[1:32:32] 1 Peter 5
[1:32:36] verse 6.
[1:32:38] Humble yourselves, therefore, unto the
[1:32:40] mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
[1:32:43] you in due time, casting all your care
[1:32:46] upon him, for he carth for you.
[1:32:52] Brother Colby was preaching this morning
[1:32:54] on fear. And
[1:32:59] Satan loves to take us
[1:33:02] in those moments of darkness and try to
[1:33:05] have us focus on the fear. He tries to
[1:33:08] take us in the moments of darkness and
[1:33:10] have us focus on
[1:33:13] our faults, our shortcomings, and
[1:33:17] try to put the fear in that, okay, God's
[1:33:19] not going to deal with this situation.
[1:33:26] Not to A lot of times, he's not even
[1:33:28] he's not trying to come in and say, "Oh,
[1:33:30] God's not strong enough for it."
[1:33:33] Especially with those of us that have
[1:33:36] been believers for a long time. we go,
[1:33:38] we know God's strong enough. We've seen
[1:33:40] it time and time again.
[1:33:43] But instead, he decides to come in and
[1:33:45] go,
[1:33:46] God's not going to do it for you
[1:33:49] because
[1:33:51] you've made the mistakes or you've made
[1:33:53] the problems or you've done this or
[1:33:55] you've done that
[1:33:58] and
[1:34:00] you know what? You're just not you're
[1:34:02] not worthy.
[1:34:06] You know, it was
[1:34:10] interesting to me as I've been looking
[1:34:13] at these. We had
[1:34:16] Sister Denise
[1:34:18] posting her prayer request that pray for
[1:34:20] me. I'm getting ready to go in for my
[1:34:22] first treatment.
[1:34:25] And I know that she had been,
[1:34:28] you know, she had been been struggling a
[1:34:30] little bit with
[1:34:32] the diagnosis. She had been dealing with
[1:34:35] it. And I know some different ones that
[1:34:36] she had gone to to talk about, well, but
[1:34:39] she had talked to my wife about, okay,
[1:34:40] what kind of oils might be a help? What
[1:34:43] kind of things might we be able to do?
[1:34:45] And this, that, or the other. And
[1:34:49] man, I've got, you know, the Lord that
[1:34:51] not the Lord, you know that the devil
[1:34:53] was playing with her mind on you've got
[1:34:55] all these medications, you've got all
[1:34:57] this, you've got these other health
[1:34:58] problems, and now you've got cancer, and
[1:35:00] you've got this, that, and the other.
[1:35:01] And
[1:35:05] and this is all me surmising. I haven't
[1:35:07] I didn't talk to Sister Denise. I don't
[1:35:09] know exactly where she was. This is me
[1:35:10] going, "We're human."
[1:35:15] I just found it
[1:35:18] So interesting to me as she's going,
[1:35:21] "Okay, she's already been dealing with
[1:35:23] health problems. She's already been
[1:35:26] dealing with other stuff." Then we have
[1:35:28] Satan go, "Hey, guess what? You got
[1:35:30] cancer, too. Let's throw that on the
[1:35:32] pile. Let's heat the furnace a little
[1:35:35] hotter. Let's make it a little worse."
[1:35:41] And then she goes in to her first
[1:35:44] appointment.
[1:35:48] Oh, you're cancer free.
[1:35:55] I thought there'd be a little more
[1:35:56] reaction to that.
[1:36:00] Here she is in
[1:36:02] one of her darkest moments.
[1:36:06] I've already been struggling with
[1:36:07] health. I've already been doing this.
[1:36:08] And now the devil's thrown cancer at me.
[1:36:12] And I don't know what the cancer
[1:36:13] treatments are going to do to how my
[1:36:14] body is dealing with everything else
[1:36:17] because the cancer treatments weaken my
[1:36:19] body. So if I already been dealing with
[1:36:21] other things, are those going to get
[1:36:22] worse? Is it just going to be a spiral
[1:36:25] going down at this point? Is it just
[1:36:27] going to be this? Is it just going to be
[1:36:29] that?
[1:36:32] We all know the way the devil works in
[1:36:34] our mind, the way he throws things at.
[1:36:35] And you will already have been planning
[1:36:38] out how this will affect you years from
[1:36:40] now. and you don't even know for sure
[1:36:42] that it's affecting you. Now,
[1:36:46] we do that all the time with
[1:36:50] planning out a conversation that we're
[1:36:52] going to have with somebody
[1:36:55] and you know they're going to say this
[1:36:56] and so I'm going to be ready to respond
[1:36:57] with this and they're going to say that.
[1:36:59] I mean, you go in, you are armed to the
[1:37:01] teeth, you are ready and then the first
[1:37:03] thing you say to them, they're like,
[1:37:04] "Okay, that's fine."
[1:37:07] And you're left there holding all your
[1:37:08] weapons going, "That was it?
[1:37:12] That was the whole that was the whole
[1:37:13] conversation. I was ready for a fight.
[1:37:18] I was ready for this to be a big deal.
[1:37:22] And that's the way our human mind works.
[1:37:24] We are always we're trying to think 20
[1:37:26] steps ahead and God's going, "I only
[1:37:28] gave you light for one step. Would you
[1:37:30] just look at your one step? Would you
[1:37:32] just pay attention? You're stepping
[1:37:33] there. Okay? Just step where I showed
[1:37:36] you.
[1:37:38] Don't think 20 steps. just this is where
[1:37:41] you're going.
[1:37:44] But yet
[1:37:46] she goes in, she goes into the
[1:37:48] appointment, she's
[1:37:50] ready for the treatment to start.
[1:37:54] And instead, she gets told,
[1:37:57] "No, you're cancer-free. You're going to
[1:37:59] come off all the medication.
[1:38:02] You're going to stop taking six
[1:38:03] medications right now
[1:38:07] because it's gone.
[1:38:12] And then isn't it just like the devil
[1:38:14] though to go you're healed but here now
[1:38:17] let me make you feel sick all over again
[1:38:19] because you're coming off of six
[1:38:20] medications
[1:38:22] because now your body is trying to
[1:38:24] bounce all around from you had all this
[1:38:25] in you and now it's all gone and your
[1:38:27] whole body is trying to reset
[1:38:33] so that maybe you don't think you're
[1:38:34] healed anymore
[1:38:38] because We know that's the way the devil
[1:38:39] works.
[1:38:41] The devil's just trying
[1:38:44] to keep you in the darkness.
[1:38:48] We all go through the dark times in life
[1:38:51] and we're all going to go through the
[1:38:53] struggles. God didn't promise us a
[1:38:56] flowery bed of ease. He didn't promise
[1:38:58] that it would be easy.
[1:39:04] And yes, God promised that
[1:39:08] we would overcome. God promised that he
[1:39:11] would get us through everything.
[1:39:15] But sometimes
[1:39:17] the promise that we have to hold on to
[1:39:19] is knowing, guess what? God is still
[1:39:22] with me in the darkness. Because God
[1:39:24] isn't afraid of the darkness. God
[1:39:25] doesn't shy away from it. God doesn't
[1:39:29] run off to a different corner.
[1:39:31] God doesn't say, "Okay, I'm over here in
[1:39:33] the light." When you're ready to come
[1:39:34] out of the darkness, I'm here.
[1:39:39] As it said in Psalms, if I make my bed
[1:39:41] in hell,
[1:39:43] you are there.
[1:39:46] Can it get any darker than hell? Does
[1:39:47] anyone have any suggestions on how it
[1:39:49] gets worse?
[1:39:52] Which means that God is where it's
[1:39:53] darkest.
[1:39:55] God is in the worst place.
[1:40:00] And as we're going through the
[1:40:01] struggles, as we're going through the
[1:40:02] problems, as we're looking at what we're
[1:40:05] dealing with,
[1:40:08] whether it's spiritual, whether it's
[1:40:11] physical, whether it's financial,
[1:40:13] whether it's,
[1:40:16] take your pick.
[1:40:18] whatever the issues are and the issues
[1:40:21] that we think are insurmountable and
[1:40:22] that we are in the darkest place and we
[1:40:24] can't get out.
[1:40:27] We are at the point where we are crying
[1:40:29] out just like they did in the psalm.
[1:40:36] Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in
[1:40:38] darkness in the deeps. Thy wrath lith
[1:40:41] hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me
[1:40:43] with all thy waves.
[1:40:46] Thou hast put away mine acquaintance
[1:40:48] from me. Thou has made me an abomination
[1:40:50] unto them. I am shut up and I cannot
[1:40:53] come forth.
[1:40:56] I'm in the darkness. I'm alone. There's
[1:40:59] no one else here. There are no
[1:41:02] comforters with me. There's no one
[1:41:03] standing beside me. There's no one
[1:41:05] trying to help me get through it. It's
[1:41:06] just me and I can't do it.
[1:41:11] It's just me and I cannot face the
[1:41:13] problem.
[1:41:15] I've tried to be strong enough. I've
[1:41:18] tried to be smart enough. I've tried to
[1:41:20] be whatever. And it's failed every step
[1:41:23] of the way.
[1:41:25] I've tried with my words
[1:41:30] to try to convert my brother or sister
[1:41:33] or nephew or niece or grandmother or
[1:41:36] mother or father. I've tried to do it
[1:41:39] and they just keep getting worse and
[1:41:41] worse.
[1:41:42] I've tried to dig myself out of this
[1:41:44] problem at work. I've tried to dig
[1:41:46] myself out of this financial problem.
[1:41:48] I've tried to dig myself out of pick
[1:41:52] your issue.
[1:41:54] I've tried to eat right. I've tried to
[1:41:55] be healthy. I've tried to do everything
[1:41:57] I need to from a physical standpoint and
[1:42:00] yet it doesn't work.
[1:42:03] Everything that I've tried and now I'm
[1:42:06] in darkness and now I'm all alone and
[1:42:08] now there are no comforters with me.
[1:42:13] And yet, as we're sitting there in that
[1:42:15] darkness, as we're crying out to God,
[1:42:17] and we can't even find the words to
[1:42:20] praise, we can't even find the words to
[1:42:22] worship, we can't even find a way to
[1:42:25] speak the positive, all we can do is cry
[1:42:27] out our pain, all we can do is cry out
[1:42:29] our sorrow, all we can do is cry out
[1:42:32] what we're suffering and what we're
[1:42:34] dealing with.
[1:42:37] And yet, God is right there.
[1:42:42] He's right there putting his arm around
[1:42:44] us and he's saying, "Okay,
[1:42:47] tell me everything."
[1:42:50] And when you're ready,
[1:42:53] when you're ready to hear it,
[1:42:56] I'll start telling you some words back.
[1:43:00] When you're ready to take it,
[1:43:03] when you're ready to accept my comfort,
[1:43:06] when you're ready to accept,
[1:43:12] I'll start talking. But I didn't leave
[1:43:14] you in that moment.
[1:43:16] I'm not leaving you alone in the
[1:43:18] darkness. I'm not leaving you
[1:43:22] to fall by yourself.
[1:43:27] As the musicians come,
[1:43:34] brother Brandham says in the greatest
[1:43:35] battle ever fought, he says when this
[1:43:37] great battle started on earth, there had
[1:43:38] to be a mutual meeting place. There had
[1:43:40] to be a place settled for the battle to
[1:43:42] begin and for the battle to rage. And
[1:43:44] that battleground begins in the human
[1:43:45] mind. There is where the battle starts.
[1:43:48] The human mind was chosen for the place
[1:43:50] of battle where it was to begin. And
[1:43:52] that is because the decisions are made
[1:43:53] from the mind, the head.
[1:43:56] Now they never started it from some
[1:43:57] organization. They never started it from
[1:44:00] some mechanical affair. The grounds
[1:44:02] never started there. Therefore, that
[1:44:04] organization can never never do the work
[1:44:06] of God because the battlegrounds where
[1:44:08] you've got to meet your enemy is the
[1:44:09] mind. You've got to make your choice.
[1:44:12] It meets you.
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:17] Further on in the same sermon, Brother
[1:44:19] Brandham says, "God will heal you right
[1:44:21] in this atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:23] where he sent you. God will give it to
[1:44:25] you. Just believe it. Amen. Open up them
[1:44:28] flu of the soul and body, senses and
[1:44:30] conscious. And just let God's word
[1:44:32] penetrate first. Take that mind. There
[1:44:34] is the battleground. Not say, "Well, if
[1:44:36] I could feel it. If I'd feel the glory
[1:44:38] of God falling. Oh, that has nothing to
[1:44:40] do with it. Not a thing."
[1:44:43] Open up the mind. That's the
[1:44:44] battleground. That is where the battle
[1:44:46] sets in array. Right here in the front
[1:44:48] line, your mind. Open up and say, "Every
[1:44:51] doubt, I doubt my doubts. I'm doubting
[1:44:54] my doubts now. I'm believing God's word.
[1:44:56] Here I come. Something is going to take
[1:44:58] place. Sure it will.
[1:45:03] And in the sermon, letting off the
[1:45:05] pressure,
[1:45:08] brother Brandham says, "Notice now God's
[1:45:10] safety zone,
[1:45:12] God's place of safety. And when we are
[1:45:14] in here in this refuge, we have a right
[1:45:17] to the healing power of God. If God will
[1:45:20] forgive his enemy and take him into the
[1:45:22] refuge, how much more will he take care
[1:45:24] of him after he's got him in there? See,
[1:45:27] there's a healing power. So, when
[1:45:28] Christians get sick, there's no need of
[1:45:30] being all steamed up about it. Just
[1:45:31] remember, by his stripes, we're healed.
[1:45:34] That's the promise. He promised it, so
[1:45:36] he just can't take it back. It's a place
[1:45:39] of refuge for our sickness, for our
[1:45:41] worries. Cast all your cares upon him,
[1:45:44] for he cares for you. It's a refuge.
[1:45:47] Trust in his word, his promises. Every
[1:45:49] promise that he made belongs to you as
[1:45:51] long as you're in his kingdom. As long
[1:45:54] as you come to him for refuge, then you
[1:45:56] have a right to every promise that he
[1:45:57] made. Every Christian in here, anywhere
[1:46:00] else, has a right to anything that
[1:46:02] Christ died for. When you're in Christ,
[1:46:04] you possess the whole thing. It's all
[1:46:06] yours. It's exactly right.
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:15] Brother Colby made
[1:46:18] the comment this morning that
[1:46:22] nothing gets under Brother Harry's skin.
[1:46:25] Nothing bothers him.
[1:46:28] My wife and I were talking about it in
[1:46:30] the van after
[1:46:34] my
[1:46:35] mother's maiden name was Wy and the WY
[1:46:39] clan.
[1:46:41] W I L E Y. The WY clan. If you know any
[1:46:45] of them,
[1:46:47] pretty much all of them are really good
[1:46:50] at hiding their emotions. Pretty much
[1:46:53] all of them are really good at keeping
[1:46:54] things bottled up,
[1:46:56] keeping things on the inside
[1:46:59] until it hits a certain point
[1:47:02] and then it explodes.
[1:47:07] And there are some things where
[1:47:10] I will admit that there are some things
[1:47:14] that don't bother me compared to other
[1:47:15] people. There are some things that the
[1:47:18] Lord gave me a personality that certain
[1:47:19] things roll off my back that it's not a
[1:47:22] big deal.
[1:47:24] And there are other things that do,
[1:47:27] but you're not necessarily going to know
[1:47:28] it right away
[1:47:32] because it's something that will stew
[1:47:35] and will percolate and will
[1:47:37] keep bubbling
[1:47:40] and build up that pressure.
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:46] And yet, brother Brandham is talking
[1:47:48] about
[1:47:51] in the letting off the pressure. It's
[1:47:54] being able to surrender
[1:47:56] that problem. Being able to surrender
[1:47:59] that situation, being able to surrender
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:05] the concerns and the cares and the
[1:48:08] fears,
[1:48:09] being able to surrender those to God and
[1:48:11] walk away
[1:48:14] leaving them there at his throne
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:19] because it's his to take care of.
[1:48:25] I can go through the dark times and I
[1:48:28] can go through the times when I'm
[1:48:29] struggling mentally and I can go through
[1:48:31] the times when I'm trying to figure out
[1:48:35] how things are going to work and I'm
[1:48:37] trying to figure out how in the world
[1:48:38] even God can get me out of this
[1:48:40] situation and trying to figure out how
[1:48:43] what in the world God are you trying to
[1:48:44] get lead me to or guide me to cuz I
[1:48:47] don't understand any of it
[1:48:50] and I don't understand why you would let
[1:48:52] this person do this and I don't
[1:48:53] understand why you would let that person
[1:48:55] act that way.
[1:48:58] I don't understand why you would allow
[1:49:01] my brother and sister-in-law and nieces
[1:49:05] and nephews to leave the message. I
[1:49:07] don't understand why you would allow
[1:49:11] this pain to happen.
[1:49:14] I don't understand why you would
[1:49:17] have me lose this job and go over to
[1:49:19] this job. I don't understand why you
[1:49:21] would have this and that. Why?
[1:49:26] And you sit there
[1:49:30] and there are times
[1:49:33] [Music]
[1:49:34] when Brother Colby may think that I am
[1:49:36] super calm, gliding across the water
[1:49:38] like a duck, but he can't see the little
[1:49:41] legs that are just kicking and kicking
[1:49:42] and kicking and kicking and turning
[1:49:44] everything up. And I'm trying to figure
[1:49:45] out how to keep moving.
[1:49:50] But from the surface, it looks like it's
[1:49:53] effortless. There's no problems.
[1:49:56] There's no issues. There's no struggles.
[1:49:58] I've got it all together.
[1:50:02] [Music]
[1:50:05] But yet, in the midst
[1:50:07] of the darkness,
[1:50:10] in the midst of the trials, in the midst
[1:50:12] of the struggles,
[1:50:14] God is there with me.
[1:50:18] And just the other side of the darkness
[1:50:22] is deliverance.
[1:50:24] Let's bow our heads.
[1:50:29] Lord Jesus, we come before you this
[1:50:31] evening, Lord.
[1:50:33] Lord, I don't know
[1:50:35] who this was for other than that this
[1:50:37] was
[1:50:40] things that I've been looking at, things
[1:50:41] that I've been dealing with, thoughts
[1:50:43] that I've had.
[1:50:47] And Lord, maybe that's all this was
[1:50:49] tonight. Maybe this was just a a
[1:50:51] reminder to me. Maybe this was just a
[1:50:53] reminder to to my family, to my
[1:50:55] children,
[1:50:58] that you're there in the midst of the
[1:50:59] darkness that you you don't shy away
[1:51:02] from us when we're struggling. You don't
[1:51:04] shy away from us when
[1:51:06] all we can do is weep. You don't shy
[1:51:08] away from us when all we can do
[1:51:12] is cry.
[1:51:15] You don't shy away when all we can see
[1:51:18] is darkness and we're struggling for
[1:51:20] just
[1:51:22] a glimmer of light.
[1:51:25] But Lord, you're always there close to
[1:51:27] us. And
[1:51:28] Lord, you've promised that you would
[1:51:30] provide. Lord, you've promised that you
[1:51:32] would heal. You've promised that you
[1:51:34] would
[1:51:35] break the chains, that you would help us
[1:51:38] to overcome, Lord.
[1:51:43] And Lord, as we're in our
[1:51:47] in our moments of life that we're in,
[1:51:49] Lord, Lord, there are some that are that
[1:51:52] are walking through the valley, maybe
[1:51:54] they're they're walking through that
[1:51:55] valley of death right now as brother
[1:51:58] Kobe read the psalm this morning, Lord.
[1:52:01] Maybe they're going through that dark
[1:52:03] place.
[1:52:05] But Lord, you're still the shepherd that
[1:52:07] leads us through it.
[1:52:09] You're still the shepherd that is there
[1:52:11] with his sheep every step of the way.
[1:52:14] Lord, maybe we're standing on the
[1:52:16] mountain. Maybe we've come out of the
[1:52:17] the darkness. Maybe we've come out of
[1:52:19] our our problem. Maybe we're getting
[1:52:21] ready to to go into it. Maybe we're only
[1:52:25] in the middle ground. We haven't even
[1:52:26] hit the worst yet. Or maybe we're at our
[1:52:30] lowest point.
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:32] But Lord, through it all, you've
[1:52:34] promised that you would be there.
[1:52:36] And Lord, maybe these words, maybe this
[1:52:39] these psalms, these scriptures, maybe
[1:52:41] these would just give us the reminder we
[1:52:44] need to know that that you're there with
[1:52:46] us, Lord. That that as Satan would be
[1:52:50] trying to to throw that spirit of fear
[1:52:52] on us and trying to make us think that
[1:52:56] everything has gone wrong and it can't
[1:52:58] get worse.
[1:53:05] that Lord, even in the midst of that,
[1:53:07] you're right there with us.
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:53:13] That you're there for us to talk to,
[1:53:14] Lord. That you're the the friend that's
[1:53:16] closer to a brother that we can tell
[1:53:18] anything, Lord. Even if all we're even
[1:53:20] if all we can do is just
[1:53:23] tell you our hurts and our problems and
[1:53:25] our woes.
[1:53:30] Lord, in these moments, maybe in the
[1:53:33] middle of that darkness, we can't say
[1:53:34] it. But Lord,
[1:53:36] right now while we can, right now when
[1:53:38] we're
[1:53:41] and we're in your atmosphere, Lord, we
[1:53:43] just want to say that we love you, Lord.
[1:53:46] We just want to say that we thank you
[1:53:48] for being with us, Lord. We just want to
[1:53:50] say that,
[1:53:52] Lord. We thank you for always being with
[1:53:54] us each step of the way.
[1:53:58] Even when we didn't know how to to face
[1:54:01] it, even when we didn't know what to do
[1:54:02] next, even when when we didn't know how
[1:54:04] to handle the situation,
[1:54:07] Lord, you've still shown yourself to be
[1:54:09] faithful.
[1:54:12] And Lord, we praise you.
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:15] Lord, I pray that you would accept our
[1:54:17] worship, Lord. That you would, Lord,
[1:54:19] take this moment as we're singing your
[1:54:22] praises, Lord. May you just continue to
[1:54:24] deal with hearts, Lord. May you continue
[1:54:27] to to speak beyond anything that I may
[1:54:30] have said, Lord. May may you take this
[1:54:33] moment for your spirit, Lord, to to
[1:54:35] minister beyond what human words could
[1:54:37] say.
[1:54:40] Lord, we love you.
[1:54:42] We just thank you for all that you do
[1:54:44] for us
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; here in your
[1:54:52] mercy overflow.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; It's here that all my doubts and fear
[1:55:01] just melt away.
[1:55:05] I lay my burden down as I look upon your
[1:55:11] face.
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:17] You are my refuge.
[1:55:21] You are my sanctuary.
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:26] When I feel afraid,
[1:55:31] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:55:35] refuge.
[1:55:38] And when the storm
[1:55:41] is raging
[1:55:44] underneath your wings,
[1:55:48] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:55:56] He who dwells
[1:56:00] in the secret place
[1:56:04] of the most high God
[1:56:09] shall abide
[1:56:12] underneath
[1:56:15] the shadow.
[1:56:17] The shadow of your wings.
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] You are my refuge.
[1:56:29] You are my sanuary.
[1:56:34] When I feel afraid,
[1:56:39] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:56:43] refuge.
[1:56:46] And when the storm
[1:56:49] is raging,
[1:56:52] underneath your wings,
[1:56:56] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:57:02] Do the first verse again.
[1:57:04] I have found a place
[1:57:08] I can call my home.
[1:57:13] here in your embrace
[1:57:16] where your mercy overflows.
[1:57:22] It's here that all my doubts and fear
[1:57:26] just melts away.
[1:57:30] I lay my burden down as I look upon your
[1:57:36] face.
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:41] You are my refuge.
[1:57:44] Yes, Lord.
[1:57:46] I say you wear
[1:57:51] when I'm feeling afraid.
[1:57:55] You are my hiding place. You are my
[1:58:00] refuge.
[1:58:03] And when the storm
[1:58:05] is raing
[1:58:08] underneath your wings,
[1:58:12] I rejoice and sing. For you are my
[1:58:17] refuge.
[1:58:19] [Music]
[1:58:21] He dwells
[1:58:24] in the secret place
[1:58:28] of the most high God
[1:58:33] shall abide
[1:58:36] underneath
[1:58:39] the shadow.
[1:58:41] The shadow of your wings.
[1:58:47] [Music]
[1:58:49] You are my refuge.
[1:58:53] You are my sanctuary.
[1:58:58] When I feel afraid,
[1:59:02] you're my hiding place. You are my
[1:59:07] refuge.
[1:59:10] And when the storm is raing
[1:59:15] underneath your wings,
[1:59:19] I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge.
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:27] It's amazing when we
[1:59:30] go through the scriptures and
[1:59:33] over the years as we spend more and more
[1:59:36] time in it, we find that
[1:59:39] that God speaks to us in every
[1:59:42] place in our journey.
[1:59:46] You know, like I I haven't heard a lot
[1:59:48] of sermons preached out of Psalms 88. I
[1:59:52] haven't heard that dwelt on a whole lot,
[1:59:54] but yet God still puts it in there.
[1:59:58] So that it's there when you need it. So
[2:00:00] that when you're struggling, you can
[2:00:02] look in and go, "Hey,
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; there have been others that were in this
[2:00:05] place. There have been others that were
[2:00:07] dealing with the darkness and they
[2:00:09] couldn't even figure out how to praise
[2:00:10] God in that moment. They couldn't even
[2:00:13] figure
[2:00:15] how to bring themselves to real worship.
[2:00:20] But yet God still classifies it as
[2:00:22] worship because you're still talking to
[2:00:24] him. You're still pouring out to him.
[2:00:26] And he doesn't ask us to come to him in
[2:00:28] some edited way. He doesn't ask us to
[2:00:32] come and oh, you have to be good enough.
[2:00:34] Oh, you have to have put your life
[2:00:36] together enough. Oh, you have to be
[2:00:39] clean enough already. You have to have
[2:00:41] already washed yourself. He goes, no.
[2:00:43] Bring me your reality
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; and I'll work with it from there. I'm
[2:00:48] not going to leave you the same way you
[2:00:49] come. I'm not going to leave you in that
[2:00:52] place. But if all you can bring me is
[2:00:54] your brokenness, if all you can bring me
[2:00:57] is your struggles, if all you can bring
[2:00:59] me is your pain,
[2:01:01] I want you to come with that.
[2:01:04] I want you to bring me where you're at.
[2:01:07] I want you to bring me what you're
[2:01:09] facing. Yeah. And then you let me be the
[2:01:12] master potter that'll start to reshape
[2:01:15] and reform.
[2:01:17] I'll be the one to fix the cracks. I'll
[2:01:19] be the one to bring it all together and
[2:01:22] to make you into the vessel that I know
[2:01:24] you are.
[2:01:28] We're not looking for this. We're not
[2:01:30] looking at psalms where it's only about
[2:01:32] I praise you, God. You're so wonderful.
[2:01:35] We love those psalms and we love reading
[2:01:37] them and there'll be service after
[2:01:39] service. If we read a psalm in service,
[2:01:41] it's probably one of those psalms when
[2:01:44] we get up and we're just worshiping God.
[2:01:46] We're telling him how wonderful he is.
[2:01:50] But yet God still puts in the scriptures
[2:01:52] to go, "Hey, I take you in your
[2:01:54] brokenness.
[2:01:56] I didn't say you're not good enough to
[2:01:58] come to me.
[2:02:00] Oh, you can still come. I'll take you in
[2:02:02] any condition,
[2:02:04] but then I'm going to start changing
[2:02:06] you."
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I never leave you the way you
[2:02:10] were when you started. I never leave you
[2:02:12] in that same state.
[2:02:17] All I ask for you to do is come.
[2:02:21] And when we're hurting, when we're
[2:02:23] struggling, when we're facing that pain,
[2:02:26] God doesn't say, "Okay, come back after
[2:02:28] you've got things figured out. Come back
[2:02:30] after you've pulled yourself together.
[2:02:32] Come back after you've calmed down."
[2:02:37] But he says, "No, give me the raw, the
[2:02:40] real you.
[2:02:43] You tell me what you're facing. You tell
[2:02:46] me what you're dealing with. You tell me
[2:02:47] what you're feeling."
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] When Satan was trying to
[2:02:56] tell brother Joe, "Hey, you should
[2:02:57] commit suicide." God wasn't standing
[2:02:59] there going, "Well, you got to deal with
[2:03:00] that before you come to me." He was
[2:03:02] saying, "Hey, if that's what you're
[2:03:04] feeling, talk to me. You tell me what
[2:03:07] you're facing. You tell me what you're
[2:03:08] struggling with
[2:03:10] and we'll deal with that.
[2:03:14] God doesn't ask us to fix ourselves. God
[2:03:16] doesn't ask us to deal with the pain or
[2:03:19] the problems or the struggles ourselves.
[2:03:24] He does ask us to be honest. He does ask
[2:03:28] us
[2:03:29] to talk to him about what's real. We're
[2:03:34] not trying to put up some false front
[2:03:36] like we do so often in front of people.
[2:03:41] I'm not trying to show God my cool, calm
[2:03:44] demeanor that I may try to present to
[2:03:46] everyone else.
[2:03:48] I'm going to let God see the little legs
[2:03:50] just kicking and trying to stay above
[2:03:52] the surface
[2:03:54] [Applause]
[2:03:56] because God wants us
[2:03:59] and he wants to work with us.
[2:04:04] because that's how much he loves us. He
[2:04:08] loves us when we're in our darkest
[2:04:10] moment. He loves us we're in our worst
[2:04:12] struggle.
[2:04:14] And he will carry us through every step
[2:04:16] of the way.
[2:04:22] your name,
[2:04:26] oh God,
[2:04:30] for your name
[2:04:32] is great
[2:04:34] and greatly
[2:04:37] to be praised,

[2:06:25] dismiss yourselves. Be a prayer for all
[2:06:27] those who are traveling from home.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Lord willing to see you all.
[2:06:34] Oh Lord,
[2:06:38] for your name
[2:06:41] is faith
[2:06:43] and greatly
[2:06:45] to be praised.
[2:06:49] [Applause]
