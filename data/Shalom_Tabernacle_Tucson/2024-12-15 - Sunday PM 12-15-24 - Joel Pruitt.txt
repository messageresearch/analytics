opportunity I don't take it lightly and appreciate your pastor brother Israel he said this morning we' met in Hot Springs and I'm not to correct your pastor but we actually met in Jasper Texas and I've got a picture with brother uh brother Israel and I think my mom has it and I was about probably about about as tall as this Pulpit maybe a little sh a little little shorter and I was standing next to brother Israel in front of the old church there in Jasper out on the highway and uh I did have my suit and tie on at that time and uh but i' I've known brother Israel now I think that's been goodness 18 years ago or something like that and so I've always admired your pastor and uh want to send greetings from my pastor my brother Ben puit to the church here he he sure enjoyed being with you all year or so ago and and we just want to just put our shoulder to the wheel tonight and see if we can't be of a help to you if I can get myself out of the way then I believe the Lord can use Lord can use anybody brother George if he can use us he can use anybody so we just want to pray that the Lord will come our way tonight if you have your Bibles tonight if we could turn to Psalms chapter 85 and verse 4 Psalms 85 and 4 if I could title this thought tonight it would be the Awakening of the Bride The Awakening of the Bride Psalms 85 verse four also good to see my my buddy brother Josh Kathy here tonight and he's we've had him out a couple times there at the church and really enjoyed yall have got a lot of talent here in the church and some wonderful Ministry and we sure sure love them Psalms 85 and verse4 turn us oh god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease wil thou be angry with us forever wil thou draw out thine anger to all generations wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant us thy salvation I will hear what God the Lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his Saints but let them not turn again to Folly and the next chapter is a very familiar Malachi 4 we're going to start with the first verse in Malachi chapter 4 we all may know this one by heart but just to lay a foundation here tonight Malachi 4 and verse one say am man when you get it for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud Y and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him and for all Israel with the statues and judgments behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled amen and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the word now tonight I would just like to just to lay a background if you look all the way back to to Eden you could say that that was quite a Revival that was perfect Perfection was in Eden there was uh Adam was there and all the animals were there and then God saw that he needed someone he needed a helpmate so he sent him so he actually put him to sleep and he brought Eve from the very side of Adam which just lost this here there you want me to switch mics we're good all right so he he actually uh and I heard this said not too long ago and I thought it was good in the Garden of Eden God was creating an animal and he might take a a male monkey from the dirt and he'd take a female monkey from the dirt and yet he and he would go on so forth like that a male and female he would bring them from the dirt but then when he made man he made him in his own image and then when he made woman the bride he actually took her from the very side of himself and so we see that that was a type on down through the Bible you can find that and also if you study the message you'll find that there was a first Eve that would fall but there was a second Eve that would not fall aren't you thankful for the promises of God tonight and I'm just thankful that we are to have the promises held over us as the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ I'm not worried about falling away because I can't fall away and so tonight you may fall down you make make you're going to make mistakes you're human amen just as your pastor would preach this morning and and there's we might even be a guilty of many of those things here tonight and and the best we can do is as Christians is say Lord forgive me and and do better and get up and keep going but what we what we do is we've got to be real careful not to get down on ourselves and say well maybe I'm not bride because that's not even a thought in the Bride of Jesus Christ because this flesh may fall but the soul that is in you will never die can you say Amen tonight God has given you the authority in this age to to believe this word and to live this word somebody has got to be able to live this message or the message came in vain can you say Amen because God would not send you something and say this is the message for you to live and then say well there's nobody on the earth to live it no somebody had to be there and be created for such a time as this it is a season of blessings for the bride it is a season of Revival for the Bride of Jesus Christ it is a season it is our season it is the Bride season and so many times we may have all kinds of we may have all kinds of doubts that would come and like I was like I said Thursday night there's going to be all kinds of Mind battles and things that are going to attack us in our minds but none of those things move me why because I'm anchored by the message of the hour I'm anchored by the word that is coming my day and I don't just believe it but I'm going to stand on it I'm going to live it to the best of my ability by the seed that is on the inside of me I can't help but follow the message of the hour how about you tonight and so if we go on down brother Brandon would talk about Revival and and I was thinking about the Garden of Eden and the Garden of Eden was in one Big Revival they had everything they had they had every herb of the field they had every tree and every fruit and they could walk in peace with the animals and there was nothing there there was nothing to harm them it was Perfection it was a real Revival why because it was the original Revival it was perfect but then come along doubt and anytime there's doubt and if you let that doubt really get a hold of you it may take you farther than you thought it would and if you let that if you if you'll actually give in to that devil that tries to talk to you then that Devil's going to take you farther than you really ever thought he could well I'm a good person but there's got to be something anchoring you to more than just being a good person it's actually got to be something in this message that says I'm going to believe what a prophet said regardless of how I feel I'm going to believe what a prophet said regardless of what soul so said about a prophet I'm going to believe this message regardless of what the critics say I'm going to believe why because I'm a Believer and a Believer can't help but believe this word so I'm here tonight to not try to bring you a new message but I want to tell you look back to the message of the hour because that is the restoration message that is what is going to bring you into Revival in this day it's not a man's Revival but it is a word Revival brought on by a prophet of the hour so if you look there in Malachi 4 remember it wasn't just saying there will be another great healer coming along or there would be another great evangelist coming along or another great prophet come but it would be the Elijah that would come and restore all things and restore you back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers it is more than just an idea is more than just an opinion but it is the word of God a lot of churches are built on man's opinion a lot of churches are are built on on all kinds of different men's ideas and doctrines and and I would say it tonight that there's many of them who have got doctrines in the church church and and they've got Creeds in the church and while they're good people that is not the word that we're following today but they'll call us crazy and they'll call us Fanatics and they'll say well they'll just following a man but what we're really following is the Bible what we're really following is the message of the hour and so what they're looking at is they see a man standing there but we didn't see a man we saw prophecy fulfilled in our day and we're looking past the veil of Flesh and we can see God in a man that is coming our day amen so I'm not looking at the man you can point out mistakes you can point out whatever you want to but I'm not looking at the man I'm looking at the word that has been fulfilled in my day I love the man I love the messenger I love the prophet but more than that I see a word that is coming my day and when you get a revelation when the church when the true church get a true revelation of the message that has come nothing can shake you away from this message nothing can take you out of this message well can you just preach with me for a little bit tonight we are more than able to stand on this message because brother John it's not you standing for a message but something on the inside of you took a stand for this word because there was something that reached out to you and grabbed a hold of you you may not have been looking for the message but the message found you you may have been in a Pentecostal church or or any denominational church but the message found me in in my lowest condition the message found me I've told people this before when I was about 17 years old my dad passed away and I I I I really couldn't I didn't have a revelation of what the message really was I knew brother Brandon was a good man and I knew that he was a real Prophet because of the things he did but I was looking at the wrong thing I was looking at the signs and they said well he never missed well that's good but all these other men claimed to have this tear but I failed to see the message that followed the sign and so I started looking and I went to a UPC Church and I know that's awful to admit but I went and I heard the first service there a man got up and preached on the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost being speaking in tongues there was something on the inside of me that wouldn't accept that nonsense there was something on the inside of me said that's wrong they could outshout me they could out speak in tongues they could outrun the aisles but nothing inside nothing there would actually feed my soul and something on the inside of me said you know better than that you know that there's a real word you know there's a real message trying to don't be trying to run away from it but you can run but the message is going to bring you back so I'd say tonight if you got children that have walked away if you've got children that have left you don't you worry about them hold that Faith over them and that seed on the inside of them we'll bring them back to the message of the hour nothing can take you out if there's something on the inside to hold you can you say Amen tonight so there was a brother Brandon would go on to say this now there is Cycles to Revival there's cycles and so brother one of the Cycles is a cycle of Revival and then death amen so you'll see a church they get on fire and there's different types of revivals brother man talked about a national Revival the national Revival he said they turned it down in 1956 and it's no longer a national Revival there will be no more Revival for the nation as we see it but then there's a person Al Revival and this personal Revival is something more than just a feeling but it is a word that is growing on the inside of you and it is actually making powerhouses out of the Sons and Daughters of God it is making men live the message and women dress like they should in the message it is making people that that couldn't live it on their own but the word on the inside of them is living out through them they were they are living Epistles read of all men we can look at a message believer and there's just something different about a message believer we're not just Pentecostals coming in here to have a good time although I believe in having a good time in the house of God but that's not all there is to it we've come here to feed on the word of God we we listen to the tapes not just to hear a man but to hear the word of God for our generation it's not just something to make us different but it is something to change our bodies and take us into Rapture see this message didn't come to just make us live different on this Earth but it's going to make us all the way different all the way through listen if you're one of his you can't be lost and if you're one of his and you come up in that day if you happen to go by way of the Grave you're going to come up with those Saints why because there's a there's a general Resurrection there's a resurrection for you and then there's a Rapture for the living and I'm here to say tonight I ain't missing it I'm not going to be here when the bombs fall I believe the message and the message is inside of me so you can go ahead and call me crazy but when he calls me I'm just call me gone because I'm going to be living leaving this world I'm here to tell you tonight that I I don't want you to look at the message as just another set of rules no you can't help but live the message if it's on the inside of you the pastor don't have to get up every service and and correct the way a lady dresses If the message is on the inside of you you know the the the law is for the law Breakers amen amen but Grace is to those that'll actually they want to do right and and there's Grace for you that want to overcome there's grace to you that want to live this message I know the devil's fighting you I know the devil's in your minds and I know the devil will fight that flesh because it's an unconverted part but he can never touch the soul and me he don't even have the keys to his own house so don't let the devil tell you that you're not more than a match for him don't let the devil tell you that you're not an overcomer you are more than enough to overcome this devil more than able more than able when the devil tries to steal your joy you go ahead and tell him listen devil you ain't got no hold on me you can't hold my hands down in the house of God you can't cause me to St there and be bored with the word of God no the word is what is Reviving me in this end time it is a word Revival let's get back to my notes and see if I can get through this but tonight we're not looking for just a feel-good Revival although we ought to feel good in church there's no reason to hang our heads down in church we ought to be the most happy and blessed people on the face of the Earth to know what we know if this word ain't enough to make you happy then nothing's going to make you happy because we have the full restored word and so brother Brandon would go on and he talks about the nation not having Revival but he but he goes on down and he says this and and he says you know he said the fields has been already reaped burnover this is 1961 and he said you pick up a stock once in a while but very few so there's very few coming from a national Revival that's why you may go overseas and I I know my brother's been to Africa there as well and you'll see people still coming to the Lord and it seems like there's a little bit more of a Revival fire there than there is in America and it's I I often think it's because of the distractions we have over here because of you know we have so much access to TV and internet and we have access to money and we have access to whatever we want to but it's a distraction from the m thing in your life if anything has first place over God in your life I say lay that thing aside you say what is it that's an idol that has taken up your time that is that is a God to you well can you say Amen tonight that is that is taking if your phone is taking up more time than you spend in church or or or you spend reading your Bible or or more time than you do hearing the tapes I say lay that thing aside for a while and fall in love with Jesus again find out what it's like to be in Revival again well you say well if the church was in Revival I'd shout more you be the Revival in Shalom Tabernacle you go ahead and lay down the things that are besetting you the besetting sins and the things that are harm in you you be the Revival here tonight and watch the Revival fire spread anden you put a you put a good hot log that's got fire on it and with some other logs and the next thing you know they all catch on fire amen so that's a personal Revival and and if you're really in Revival you can't help you can't help but look around and see other people start feeding off of that Revival and but what we'll do is we sit there cold and dead it's 12:00 and like a mule looking at a new gate and we're sitting there looking at the preacher saying preach is Happy preacher and the preacher's preaching the word to you and that ought to be enough to make you happy well come on Church there's no reason to think that the preachers needs to be more on fire but I need to be on fire for the message of the hour I need a Revival your pastor said it this morning we don't want to just see a new church but he wants to see the church in Revival he wants to see the fire burning in the hearts of people again when he opens them doors on Wednesday nights he wants to see people that can't wait to get there when he opens the doors on a Sunday night he wants to see people who can't wait to walk in them doors why it's not to hear the preacher it's not to hear a tape but what it is it is to meet with God and let the Revival fires burn again well come on somebody this is not just another church but this is a church where the word is being preached and this is a church where the message is being raised up as the standard let us be the standard today and let the message live through us let us preach the word and if you preach the word I believe that it will come back amen if you cast your your bread on the water it'll come back and I I hear I I say tonight your pastor is going to preach the word regardless of your response but you might as well go ahead and let him enjoy it once in a while amen sometimes when you're standing up here and you're preaching your heart out and and you say well oh me well go ahead and make that thing right and back the preacher for a minute well come on somebody go ahead and make that thing right and say Amen to the word of God once in a while sometimes that amen is enough to drive a devil out of you sometimes that amen is enough to say I'm on this side and I'm saying Amen to the word of God look at me devil you ain't got no hold on me just because you had a hold of my mind and just because you you caused me to do things I'm ashamed of the devil has no hold on this bride there is no chains holding you the message is not a bondage to you but it is freedom in the Holy Ghost to you why because it is the message the message is not just a it's not just a quotebook and it is not just a book and a tape but the message is actually the word of God living in The Bride of Jesus Christ and your pastor standing here he he can stand here and he can read quotes and and and and he's not just reading the quotes just to just to say look who I'm following no he's reading the quotes cuz he believed the quotes and he believes this message and I I promise you a man that is gifted could go preach and make money somewhere else but he didn't sell out to money he didn't sell out to fame but he's standing here preaching to a little group in Tucson because he cares for your soul and he wants you to follow the message of the hour not because it's a man because it is Christ it is the word today I hope this is all right brother Israel but I'm just here to tell you tonight that the message still works and the message still changes lives and the message is still on fire just because you might feel cold the message ain't cold the message is still very much alive I believe there's just as much power in the word tonight that was spoken in 1947 1955 1965 all the way through I believe every one of the tapes of brother Brandon was standing there physically and he might be able to stand there and and with the gift of God tell you things but the same God is here tonight if you have need of anything thing he is still here the message is still alive so what we need tonight do we need a Revival how many needs a Revival every one of us need a Revival I need a Revival it's a personal Revival to me because the message the message is here the Revival is here but I've got to participate in the Revival that has come so I believe it's a restoration message I believe is to restore restore everything can you say amen I don't believe it was just a partial restoration I don't believe this message came to say well some people's going to shout no we had that with Pentecost some people's going to speak in tongues we had that with Pentecost and that's part of it but that wasn't all of it well can you say man amen if that if part of it was okay you could have been a Lutheran If part of it was okay you could have been a Wesley and if part of was okay you could have been a 1906 Pentecostal but there was a fullness of the restoration to come and it came to a bride that was willing to accept it can you say Amen brother brandham says it here brother bam talks about uh The Awakening of the bride and I like how he says it here he and then the third seal 1963 he says he says now that's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we have had we haven't had a real stirring no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions of of church members but not a Revival nowhere the bride hasn't had a Revival yet now the world calls building churches a revival can you say Amen the Revival would or the world would call a Revival having a a church full building a bigger Church to to hold the people the numbers is a Revival but that is not what a prophet would call a Revival a prophet never called that a Revival matter of fact he would say they've got more members than they've ever had but they are dead than they've ever been they're quieter in church and listen if they got programs for the kids it'll hold the kids if they've got if they got certain events going on it'll hold them but we're not here for that the social aspect of it we want Fellowship we want to love one another and we should we should always come together and love one another brother R talked about the Tabernacle being so in love he said that when they'd leave on Sunday night that they couldn't wait to get back on Wednesday night because because they had such fervent love for one another I think that's the way we ought to be but we ought to more than that want to come back here and meet with God on his terms you say on his terms yeah because he said that you'll come here and he said you'll sit together in Heavenly places and and you'll actually feed on the word of God where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered and and also he would say things like this and I just believe that the Bible and the message are are kind of the same Authority in my heart and I hope it is to you but the messenger would come and say if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open out yonder well can you sayen so if we can get God in the hearts of the people you don't have to beg people to show up to church but the people will come to church what we need is Revival church I believe there's Holy Ghost filled people sitting at home tonight but they need to be revived and what's already inside of need to be awakened Again by the word of God come back to the word of God live the word of God it's later than you think let's go ahead and get ready for a rapture brother Brandon would go on and he would say it like this he said' now he said we haven't had Revival the bride hasn't had Revival yet see there's been no Revival no manifestation of God to stir that bride yet we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again see I'm not preaching the thunder so don't get scared but I'll say what a prophet said is that okay you know the Thunders are are okay if you're saying what a prophet said it was a man's opinion that made the Thunder Doctrine wrong amen it it's an opinion of a man that'll that'll form a Doctrine and call it whatever they want to call it and then that's what makes it wrong but what when you're saying what a prophet said I can say Amen to it amen and so brother Brandon would go on down the exposition and in the later see in church age he would say now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the the Seven Seals well can you say amen I hope that's okay tonight so you're going to see that a prophet is coming to wake up a bride well I hope this is okay we'll go on down with some quotes and we'll lay it in there now there was still healing campaigns going on when brother bam said this there was still Revival in the land according to the nominal church when brother brandham said this there was still uh there was still men with their big tents going around and and having all kinds of numbers in there and brother Billy Graham would go and still fill up stadiums at this time there was still people showing up for Revival now it may not have been what it was 20 years prior to that but there was still uh there was still an urgency in the land for a Revival but what they missed was the word that would come with the message and so brother BR would go on down here and he's talking in 1964 recognizing your day and its message he would say everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining ministers crying and he was talking about he's reading uh The Herald of his coming ma magazine he said one of the finest papers on the field The Herald is coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads it he said you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear and these are good things the prophet is not saying not to fast and he's not saying not to pray but it's all they were looking for was just the the feeling of it or or the prayer of it or the fasting of it and they're missing something the prophet goes on and says this he says you see it all the time and he goes on down he says now he said we're going to have a great breaking of the day there is a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yes see why did they do that why did they do that they want a Great Awakening and they're crying and believing that there will be an Awakening well can the church say Amen this is a quote now and we're still in recognizing your day in this message he said now they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride so what they did they were still looking for the signs and they were still looking for something to come but they missed what God was doing right there in their midst they missed the main thing why because they're looking for an emotion and they're looking for a sensation and they're looking for something to make them feel different but the word had come and woke up the bride it was calling out the bride and restoring her back just like the prophet said he would do in Malachi 4 so brother Brandon would go on and brother Brandon would say it like this he said now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival this in a different sermon I'll have to get it down here in a second he said it's a different Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next how many's ever seen that in a message Church you'll see a man that come to the message and maybe they come out of something and they're they're on fire for God but their kids are there because they're there and their grandkids are there because they're there and and I'm not I'm not condemning third and fourth generation Believers but you've all you all have to have your Revival brother brandham said every generation has its chance at the word can you say amen and so in the third generation Embers May glow be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren well can you say amen and so salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than there is any truth to Apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they're no longer just playing Christians but they have to take it they have taken a denominational name and are now Baptist Methodist Etc and that is exactly what they are two so you'll see denominations and they'll and they'll they say look at the numbers we got but the problem is their fires have already flamed out and it is be what the grandparents had or the great grandparents had there's nothing left but a form of godliness in the grandchildren and if we're not careful in the message you'll teach your kids that God sent a prophet but them kids need the baptism of the Holy Ghost our kids need a chance at the word our kids need to know that just believing in a prophet is not enough but to follow the word and B ISM follow the word in a new birth follow the word all the way down till it'll change your body it ain't enough to say God sent a prophet but let that person have an experience for themselves it's not enough for you to have Revival I want our young people to have Revival I needed a Revival and God sent me a personal Revival I say every one of you tonight pray that God will send you a Revival pray that God will send you such a Revival that your kids can see your Revival pray that God will send you such a Revival that the people on the street can see you're in Revival pray that God will send you such a Revival till the pastor can stand here and he can't hardly preach because the fires are burning so hard in the congregation until they're standing there want more of the word more of God and the altars are filled again oh come on somebody the altar has not been done away with the altar calls need to come back in the church until some people are willing to get down there and say you know what I got to die to this party I got to die to my own ideas I got to die to my own opinions and give out to what I want and let God have his way in the church again God wants to move in you God wants to move in your family God wants to live through you more than you want God to move through you but he needs somebody that is willing and able to let the Holy Ghost move through him again listen Church we're not just here to play Church we're not just here to have church three times a week and you're not here just to hear a good sermon but you're here to grow in the word of God that has been given you I believe that the message has come and the bride has been aw awakened by the word I believe that you've been woke up by the message of the hour we're not looking for another message to come the message is here can you say Amen I'm not looking for a for a new message I'm not looking for another messenger because this is the final message to the final church can you say amen and so we believe what he said now I want to go ahead and propose to you this and I hope it's okay that if this is the final age then the the the cycle of Revival and death has ended because we are in a constant Revival until the Rapture of the church now you may not always feel like you're in Revival personally you may not always feel like the church is in Revival but what you have is a Revival in you I hope this is okay I've got a quote to back that up brother BR go on down here I just want to get to this because I forgot to start my timer on time so we'll be okay buddy won't we brother Bram said that cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do this is in the church age book uh the exposition yeah the fision church age he said uh the cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took to street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit that sounds like a good place to be again it wouldn't hurt none of us it wouldn't hurt none of us to go ahead and exercise our freedom in the house of God you know a prophet when he preached Church order he didn't come and take the moving of God out of the church he just put it in order in the church but he didn't say we got to get rid of no he was a word Prophet everything that the word taught he stood for it don't be scared of getting out of order one time I'll just tell you this I believe if you get too fanatical the pastor will tell you you're too fanatical the deacons will do their job but until then just go ahead and worship God freely the way you ought to in the way that's called heresy that's the way I worship God and I believe tonight we ought to worship Him Freer than we ever had have because a message of restoration has come a message has come not to just raise us up but to restore us all the way back to everything not just a Pentecost but all the way back to an Acts 2 church and I believe if an Acts 2 Church would stagger like drunk men it's okay for you to stagger like a drunk man I say if it's okay for them to be called drunks in the middle of the day then what about us have you ever been accused of being a drunk man in the middle of the day I'm not talking about real liquor but really have you ever been so full of the Holy Ghost to where you couldn't speak in English or Spanish or whatever you speak have you ever been so full of the Holy Ghost that you just lose yourself in your prayer closet I know a prophet put these things in order but I think what we've done is we've decided we didn't need that anymore I say our young people need a chance at the word and they need a Revival in their hearts we don't want the word didn't come to get rid of the Revival the word is the Revival this is all part of the word we you can stand up here and and and every part of this message that you read is the word to you it is to revive your soul it is to make you feed on something listen you're to grow up as calves in the stall you're to be fat on this word is that all right I preach at a home and my brother gives me a great big amen here to be fat on the here to be fat on the word all I got to get off of that before he listens and I lose all my Pulpit time at home brother man would go on down like this he said they weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old old dead churches and worshiped in homes old store buildings he didn't say Banks but we can say Banks they were we're part of his people aren't we worship in Banks soon to have a nice church and we thank the Lord for that man God is good that's air that's a miracle for you all you say God ain't doing no Miracles God worked out a miracle for this church you ought to praise him for it thank God for what he's doing for you God's moving even when you don't feel him moving he said and they they had their old store but they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they begin to get enough money to build a fine new church they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir and they organized a movement and ran it by man come on church this is a dangerous place to be when man starts taking control of the worship in the church and man starts taking control of what is said in the church let God be God and let the message be the authority over the church let the message say what is allowed in the church let the message say what we need to worship like come on somebody let the message be your absolute again make the message great in your homes again I hope that's okay it's all right it's all right to Worship in the house of God believe it or not your pastor would enjoy it if you'd say Amen once in a while see I get to go home tomorrow so I'm not worried about what you think about me but your pastor wouldn't mind that a bit I hope this is a help to you tonight I'm not trying to condemn anybody y'all are wonderful to preach to but what I'm saying is a spirit of leoa is everywhere and and the spirit of leosia is not a church on fire it is a lukewarm church so what Spirit should we be fighting against not the churches on fire but the leoan churches or the churches that have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof and so I would say like this they have a form some of them may shout some of them may speak in tongues some of them may run the aisles some of them could probably even live a good Christian life but if they miss the word that has been given in their generation then they're not raptured material I hope this is all right tonight listen I believe it takes a message to make a Rapture I believe that this message didn't come just to call you and say well be good people be good Methodist be good Baptist no the message calls you to be different in this day not just to act different don't be different just to be different but it called you from the normaly of this world to be set aside and ready for the coming of the Lord I hope this is okay tonight listen I don't want to say nothing that the messenger didn't say but I believe sometimes we get so bound up and we're so worried that we're going to be deceived you can't be deceived you're so worried about being deceived by a man in the Pulpit all right all right if the man saying what a prophet said that is the word of God to you brother Brandon would say hope this is all right you can find the quote if you want to he said in his absence we are his body and his voice what a prophet said in his absence in another place he would say under her messenger the bride would be the final voice to the final age so do you have a voice but you have to be under the messenger of the hour it's not my opinion that's going to change you it's not my thoughts that's going to change you but is the thoughts of God that would be spoken by a prophet in our in our generation and we say what a prophet said we do what a prophet said we're not hearers only but we're doers also of the word of God many will come and say have not I done these Mighty Works have not I done have not I prophet side have not I I'm just going to say this and not try to add to the word but have not I listened to every tape and have not I went to church three times a week but have you accepted the message for your generation have you accepted the Revival that God has sent to you have you been on come on somebody there's no reason listen if you can't enjoy the word here what makes you think you're going to enjoy the Rapture morning if you can't en word the if you can't enjoy the word in church what makes you think you're going to have fun in heaven where it's so noisy you may not even be able to hear yourself brother Brandon we talk about how where Jesus is there's always a lot of noise listen I know sometimes we overuse that stuff and we take it out of context because I I've seen Services where the spirit of the Lord had come in and and the people are just quiet and they're crying their eyes out and and the Holy Ghost is in the service and and people are being changed and delivered I've seen that but let me go and tell you something when you've been set free that's the time to worship when you've been set free that's the time to take your victory dance when you've crossed the Red Sea that's the time to beat the tambourine I believe we've come into our land of promise it's time to take your victory dance here tonight and let the Revival fires burn again we have overcome this message is is an overcoming message and God has went before us in battle and so when you say that you don't have Revival you're telling me the message don't work okay when you're telling me that you don't have Revival personal Revival then you're telling me you have not surrendered to the word of the hour if you surrender to the word of the hour this word will change you if you have surrendered yourself listen not part of yourself not just your mind and say well I I'm going I'm going to be the message an intellectual faith will never change you an intellectual faith is not going to cause you to take a Rapture an intellectual faith is not good enough in this bride but you've got to renew your mind as I spoke about Thursday night and get your mind right so you can accept what God has said and believe with the heart that this message is enough to overcome every giant that'll stand in your way everything that tries to keep you from your promises God's message that he sent is more than enough for you this messages are absolute can the church say Amen brother B would go on and say it like this he said they begin to get a new building and he said they they he said they let down the bars the goats came in on down a little farther on that quote he said the Cry Of Joy was gone have we ever gotten there in our own lives to where we come to the message I remember the first time I realized I was raised in the message for most some of my life and I I so I knew the message but knowing the message did not convert me knowing the message did not fill me with the Holy Ghost knowing the message was not enough to hold me but I had to get a revelation that God had sent a message for me personally not just for my dad not just just for my mom not just for my pastor but for me personally it's good to know your pastor is going in a Rapture but what about you if my pastor don't go I'm going anyway if the church ain't in Revival I'm in Revival anyway if brother George comes up here and and he plows through a service and and and and and and and maybe maybe he Don't Preach very good one time I know it never happens but but if it ever did and he's struggling you say well brother George just didn't have it tonight something he said could have changed someone's life for an eternity right there something a man said on a night when you didn't feel God moving I say it's time we come with our expectations to the house of God and say I'm going to receive whatever God would have for me in the house of God tonight if I don't feel it I'm going to be blessed anyway I'm going to sing anyway I'm going to shout anyway I'm going to raise my hands anyway why because God has given me the ability to know who I am in this generation and when the bride will recognize who she is guess what we're going to be out of here church if you can recognize who you are recognize your day recognize your Revival if I could say it that way recognize the Revival fire is here the word is changing Hearts tonight let me get on down here just a little farther brother brandham said now watch but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God now I love how he ties all that together together this is in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 paragraph 49 he says but watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman elect can you say amen for as the world Satan the deceiver who deceived the first bride is sitting against God by believing his word and now today as we see the church natural in your intellectual gospel there we go back to the intellectual faith and intellectual gospels and everything's done by with intellect anymore well if you can just believe it this way they can talk you into anything but listen if man can talk you into it another man will talk you out of it but we have not been talked into the message by an intellectual mind but we have come by Revelation to know that the opening of the word was here we see the revealing of the son of man in our time what was it a son of man revealing the son of man to the people it is time for the bride to recognize that we are awake in this generation we've seen the word come in our time we are not like those who have failed to see The Awakening but we have been awakened by the word of God yes that's why the people didn't wake up it wasn't because they didn't believe he was a prophet I was watching One Time on YouTube and I saw I saw I won't call their names but they were they were on TBN and they were saying what a great prophet brother brandham was and even walking into Portland I believe it was into the auditorium they said it was like a god man standing there see they could recognize the gift of a prophet they could recognize that God was working through a man but they could not accept the word that was given now those that could accept the word that's the bride now the church world at the time could look at it and say I see the prophet I believe that the message came or not the message I believe that the gift has come and I believe that now we're looking for a Great Awakening now we're looking for the word listen and they missed it because it was God in Simplicity in a Kentucky hillbilly that would stand there and it was God being revealed night after night what to get the attention of the people for a word that was to come and be open to them but they would stand there and they would say well we'll follow him and then they'll say well he got off on his Doctrine when the doctrine was the very thing that God was trying to get there attention for the whole time so you say I'm not I'm not following the signs I'm not following a sign I believe the signs I love to go to build my faith I believe I said it the other night to build my faith I go back and I can watch the Deep call to the deep and we played it one night there in church and just a testimony we played it there one night in church and shortly after uh we had a sister that lost her hair and if she's watching and I I hope this is okay she lost her hair and had to start wearing a hat and a and a scarf and things over her head to church and she come up for prayer uh maybe that following week and we had just played that deep call to the deep I think the previous Wednesday or two Wednesdays before and and we're stand and and and we get down and she comes up for prayer and and she gets prayed for and within I believe it was within two weeks her hair was grown all all the way back out so what was it it was building faith from from seeing what God had done listen I I listen this wasn't done in a corner God is still using God is still using the same anointing today he's still using the same word today and all we have to do is follow the prescription of the word and God can still cast out Devils come on somebody you can still Lay Your Hands on the sick why because God still uses men God still has a pro a pastor in the Pulpit God still has deacons at their post of Duty God still has somebody who's willing to work in the economy of that God has laid out so so I saw that and I saw that faith that was built listen and those are good things we we thank God for the healings and we thank God for the Miracles and we thank God for the stories and and the true stories that that people would get up out of stretchers and and Congressman Upshaw and all these things that were great testimonies it was God working through a man and and raising people up listen but that was just to get your attention for what was to come well can you say Amen now brother Brandon would not point to that and say look what I've done look at my Ministry when the other healing evangelists would say look look at my crowd and look at the people that are getting healed but there was no message to follow it but in our case oh come on somebody in our situation we were given a prophet that didn't just come to heal people but he came to get your attention for a word that would change your body is that okay tonight so we don't follow the signs but the signs follow the Believers the signs follow the Believers even today the signs follow the Believers but Believers are not just sign followers if that's all right that's we got Bible for that I'll get to it in a minute if I need to back that up brother Brandon would say it like this he said now we see the church natural and your intellectual gospel going further and further away from the word I want you to notice that in this message that brother brandham was doing in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he talks about the word so powerfully and I believe tonight that the word should have the preeminence in our churches I I believe that that should be more than the songs I believe that should be more than just the more than more than anything the word should have the preeminence because the Bible tells us that that uh that that that that Christ uh that God we we we should he should have the preeminence of all things and and and and we should never we should never look to anything else have no other gods before you and and Christ should always have the preeminence in our midst and in our services I believe he is the main attraction he is the main thing he is the theme of our services he is the theme of our life he is the main thing in all of us but I think if we're not careful we separate the word from Christ and make it two separate things but in the beginning God uh the word was with God the Word was God and God came down in flesh and dwelt Among Us and when he left and ascended then his Spirit would come and live in men and you could accept the same word that he was now how can God accept something other than himself but if you have the real spirit of God you can't accept nothing but him you can't accept nothing but the word that is Christ and so brother Bon would stand there and he would talk about he said the natural intellectual gospel going further and further away we find that the women of the world on the streets members of such as carrying themselves in the same atmosphere you can't tell them they've lost all sense of common decency the people have see and that's the way the church has and you can see it going straight to the ecumenical council just as certain as anything in the world and right into Rome as hard as it can go see cuz it's prophesied and there she is that's her behavior now I want you to notice who he's talking to but then watch again to the spiritual church who's that tonight well come on somebody where's my spiritual church at tonight but then watch again to the spiritual church how to that group of people called out the elected through every Revival in Martin Luther it happened the same way in Reformation it happened the same thing in the time of John Wesley it happened the same thing when Pentecost first started they Dro them women right back in line with the word and then they Drift Away there she goes right back over into chaos but then the time that the people are ready to line up there is a message comes forth and they line with it so for the message to come somebody had to be ready to accept the message somebody had to be willing to dress like a lady in this message some man had to put off their their their cissified ways and had to start dressing like men again well come on somebody somebody had to start acting like uh men men again and women had to start acting like women again listen that is a perversion in the world that we see that is creeping into the message circles and start causing men to start dressing like sissies and saying well it's okay for our boys to wear shorts again well come on somebody you say well that's just a prophet's opinion I'll take his opinion over your opinion I'll take his opinion over my opinion I'll take his opinion over any preacher's opinion why because I believe it's a spirit that gets on the people that causes them to disbelieve one word if you want Revival line up with the word if you want a Revival in your church quit pushing the envelope and saying well I can watch more TV in the home and I'm not going to go to hell for listen you may not but you may have a cold house of God to set in and you may have a hard time living in this world with all the spirits that are coming off of that television and coming out of that screen and and twisting your mind to think different ways and start acting like the world and and you see some naked women on the TV and and pretty soon you you grow so accustomed to it that it doesn't bother you anymore but get back to the house of God and line up with the word of God and those filthy things won't be in your home no more those filthy magazines will will be gone that filthy TV program will be turned off well come on somebody it's time for the house of God and the people in the Church of God to start acting like Christians again well what about your phone brother Joel what about your phone I tell you our phones are a problem our phones are a problem our phones have come in listen these are all distractions from the Revival that is going on the Revival's here but we're not participating because we're distracted did by the world so brother B would go on like this and this is in I believe this is the anointing ones at end time and brother BR would say it like this he said now friends go back with me where's the first Revival come after the death the days when the grain of wheat had fallen to the ground the body the bride of Christ Christ organized his bride excuse me he said his church he never organized it he just said Apostles prophets and so forth in the church to keep it clean but at Nia Rome 306 years later they organized it and made an organization out of it is that right and he he said and it died everything that didn't agree with that church was put to death and it laid still for hundreds of years in the dirt but after a while up she come in Luther the first little sprigs of corn come up the second it budded out from there and then they went they had swingly and so forth and and other organizations and so forth then after a while come the Anglican along and then what happened here comes Wesley along with the new Revival the tossel that looks a little more like like the wheat then what happened he said to that it or it organized and dried up and died the life went right into the Shu and the Shu come forth almost perfectly like the wheat but finally its Folly was made manifest now if you remember in the scripture we we read at the beginning it said return not again to Folly and in the Book of Psalms there he said he said will not wil thou not revive us again but he goes on at the very end of that the scripture we read and he says return not again to Folly so he said what is it they he said they they they turned again and and they went along with a new uh what happened he organized dried up and died the life went back in the shuck and the shuck come forth almost perfectly like the wheat but finally its Folly was made manifest in the last eight or 10 years especially in the last three years now what does it do pull away from the wheat now why hasn't there been an organization start up in these last 20 years of this great Revival it's anointed prophets anointed teachers and so forth but why ain't there there is nothing Beyond The Grain see it's black without an organization oh my a blind man could see that it cannot organize it is so firmly against it it's the grain of wheat itself the son of man will be made manifest how many knows that it has amen the son of man will be made manifest in the last excuse me the son of man will be made uh manifest and he said uh let me get on back here to where I was at I'm sorry I I I apologize I get so caught up in this stuff and I've got so many quotes here that I might just I might be all over the place but the son of man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again the son of man in the last days and there will come false impersonations of it in the last days that'll almost deceive the elected if possible look at their organizational Shucks pulling away now it only lets the wheat be known to the elected which are part of it notice now how beautiful this is brought in here now only he said notice the anointed ones and he goes on down he said notice the anointed prophets will be false and there among it will be true anointed how are you going to tell it by the word many will come and say have not I done this have not I done this have not I prophesied have not I spoken tongues have not I shouted have not I've done all these things but what about the word that comes what about the word that is being made manifest in their lives they can shout and they can go out and cuss right outside the door they can shout and they can turn right around and cut their hair they can shout and then they can go out and act like Hypocrites remember there was two men that brother Brandon went to in that meeting and both of them would speak in tongues and he said one of them was a real Christian and one of them was the biggest hypocrite he'd ever met what was it it was just an anointing on the individuals but when the word comes and changes lives it's not just an anointing that comes but it is a change from the inside out when you go out there and you do make mistakes listen you're going to make mistakes you're going to fall down but something on the inside is going to get you back up again and keep marching on in the house of God and if you miss a Wednesday night you're not going to get used to missing a Wednesday night you're going to get out on Sunday morning and and say Lord forgive me give me the strength and change my job situation change my mind change my heart and let me get back in the house of God again you say staying home's cool no staying home ain't cool that's what the world calls good but the Bible has told us to assemble together and the prophet has told us to assemble together and and I say we need to get back in line with the word if we're going to call oursel bride I hope that's all right you know the prophet laid it out pretty plain but we've watered it down to such a point now that everybody's okay listen Church everybody might be fine in your opinion listen I you want to thank good of people and that's fine but I want to just say this for me and my house I want to line up with the word and every man in this building that has a family sitting here tonight you need to make that a challenge to yourself I want to line my house up with the word of God I want my wife to be a real Christian lady I want my kids to be in the house of God I'm not going to send him to Sunday school I'm going to take him to Sunday school I'm not going to send my wife to church because I'm tired I'm going to go with her to the house of God listen Church I'd rather you be in the will of God and be sitting there tired as you can be but fulfilling the word for your day listen it there's no reason for us to sit at home God has given us the ability to not be like they are overseas where when they don't have transportation and they walk hours what is it is a desire on the inside of somebody I say let the Revival fires come in your heart and you can't stay away from the church anymore is that all right tonight I say let the Revival fire start let the word come in your heart God will move for you this is on my heart tonight church it's not because your pastor said he want a Revival I need Revival our church needs Revival my family needs a Revival how many can say that for your house my family needs a Revival we've drifted I need a Revival we we we don't turn on the tapes like we used to I need a Revival it's one thing for a preacher to sit there and study it's another thing for him to take his family in there and sit him around around a table and say we're going to hear the message tonight it's one thing for a preacher to sit there and study and say well I got a pretty good word from the Lord but what about your family that's sitting there what about the TV that's on the other room with all kind of filthy garbage well come on somebody the preachers are got to be held accountable too it's not just the it's not just the people that we preaching there listen when I'm pointing my finger at you I don't mean to be pointing at anybody but I'm pointing them back at myself as well because I've got to line up to the same message that I'm preaching to you tonight I need Revival we all need a Revival brother brandham said when the when the Revival come to the ocean it wasn't to there was no more water in it than there ever was before it's not about building numbers it's not about when when when you get the new church don't say well we want to fill this place up no what about Reviving yourselves first revive ourselves Lord create in me a Revival let me be the Revival let me be the Revival to Tucson you say well it's just a desert and there listen you see these Cactus out here if they had some water they might turn into a flower but I believe we' we we've become so we've become so sticky with one another and we've started picking on this church because they don't see it our way well I hope this is okay tonight it's on my heart your pastor may be going away for a while but when he gets back he'll take notes and clean all this up but I but did the prophet not say that when you get dry you start picking at one another what a prophet taught so what do we need we need the Revival to be in us again we need we need the water to come back in the services again I I don't want to go to church and just and just participate in the service by showing up and sitting on the Pew but I want to go and be the joy of the Lord in that service I I want to go and if nobody else says amen I want to say Amen to the word if nobody else can pull on the word of God I want to pull on the word of God if nobody else feels like worshiping let me worship anyway if the church feels cold let me be on fire hey no reason to point at everybody else say look at them they're dead what about me well come on church I I I know this is simple but I believe the word has come in this day to wake up a bride I believe that she is now seeing the word and becoming the word today listen when the prophet came and Revelations tells you there was a little book open and that little book had contents in it that were good for you and that little book maybe to the world has still got the seals on it because it has not been revealed to them why because they would not accept it as a revealed word but we have seen the revealed word in action we know that God's still alive we've seen a Prophet come and do the works that Jesus did we've seen a man stand there night after night we've seen the works and it got our attention for the word that was would come and restore the bride again he's not restoring it's just a Pentecost but he wants restored powerhouses this is the final Revival this is not just a Revival it is the Revival it is the bride's Revival brother brandham and I love the quote and I I I believe I've got it in here somewhere if you need it I'll find it he said every chance every generation has a chance at its Revival every generation has its chance at the word and so I believe tonight that it's not just you know you know we may have found the word and I'm thank I thank the Lord that I found this message but I've got to make it accessible for my children so that they can find it too you say well I'm on fire for God if you'll get back in the house of God your children will come back to the house of God you know we want to tell our kids to go to church and line up to the word and they look at us and they're like well what about you what about you Dad you're always on your phone or you're always watching TV well help me Lord my kids are looking at me and I'm telling them be in church every service and and I go to church every service but listen church that ain't enough I need to set my example at home too so that think can no I'm not just a hypocrite in the house of God but I believe what I'm talking about brother Israel can stand here and preach the message to you but his kids are sitting there home and he knows you know your kids are your worst critics I've got a daughter who I I I don't even crack the top 10 favorite preachers in her mind George ain't there either don't worry but she'll sit there and start naming off all these preachers she heard and she's got names that I don't even know people that I wouldn't never listen to but she heard him somewhere and I'm sitting there thinking what about me but you know what you know kids are impressionable and when you raise him in the fear and I know my time's almost up I'm looking at the clock George said he pulled for an hour and it must have been a long time ago since that hour was up but you know kids are impressionable we can tell them things and that's good but what they see you doing is a lot more powerful to your kids when when you tell them hey you need to be free to Worship in church and you're sitting there like a bump on a pickle come on somebody it's good to Worship in church we need to go worship today we're going to we're going to church to worship why didn't you worship dad all right we'll get off of that y'all are getting scared to death that I'm a Pentecost preacher listen I Pentecost never left the church the message came to restore everything back to the church there's no reason for the bride to feel like we're lower class people we are the class of people that God wanted for this generation we are the people that God has called to overcome in this generation God didn't call somebody else he called you brother George he didn't call somebody else to pastor this church brother Israel but he called you why because you're the man for the hour you're the man that God saw fit to put confidence in you are the people that God saw fit to place the seed of the message in because he knew you could live this message you say well I'm not I'm struggling with it brother Joel I'm struggling to overcome listen you're going to struggle until the day you lay down this Garment of flesh but I'm here to say we're going to keep on fighting until we're laying down this garment I'm here to keep fighting until some morning between 6:00 and 9ine I can take my final step into a body change I'm looking forward to it and I believe the word that has come will will change my body me get on down here where I can find a place to close I like this part do you believe the move is on for the bride brother Brandon would say it's thus sayith the Lord he would say some of you people that really believe this to be the truth how many is that everybody in the building ought to have their hand up you people that really believe this to be the truth this is the invisible Union 1965 one of the last sermons brother brand would preach he said we're entering another age we're entering the raptured age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse he's talking about the church how many knows that he said Say Amen brother Bram didn't pull for amens well he did there I like to leave them amens in my quotes that way I can pull for amens too it's got to get worse and it can't go like this see it's got to be something and it's moving right now is that okay he said friends it's on the move is on for the bride that's thus he said that's the truth that's thus saith the Lord how many believes that to be true tonight if the move is on for the bride we need to be in the move that the bride is in we need to be in the Revival that the bride is in I believe that the move is on for the bride I believe the Revival is the word that has come and it is moving the bride to a Rapture we're not just here to talk about it we're here to participate in it he man how many knows the story about the little the little police I'm about to close I promise I'm I'm get worried when my clock starts to run out but that little policeman standing there and he's waving his baton there on the street corner and these men walk up and they asked him they said where is the wel Revival you know this man must have really had Revival because he was happy at work he was smiling on the job and you know what he says I love his answer you all know the answer you're you're you're tape listeners in here your message people buddy I am the Revival so when somebody comes and tells you there's no Revival for the bride what do you say I am the Revival I've accepted the word in my heart I am the bride's Revival you might be looking for a Revival to come I am the bride's Revival if you're looking for something greater I'm telling you the message is the greatest thing God could give you and it is here and it is living through the Believers here tonight I hope you all believe that tonight listen I I love this prayer and as the musicians would come I want to say this brother Brandon would say it like this this is in recognizing your day in this message and I love uh paragraph 237 I love this prayer brother Brandon said God created me a Revival let me be the Revival I wonder how many in here tonight want to be that Revival Let each one of us be the Revival the Revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more Kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press towards the mark of the High Calling of Christ I say that ought to be our prayer tonight let me be the Revival in Shalom Tabernacle let me be the Revival in my part of the country let me be the Revival in the house of God let me be the Revival in the message of the hour church I say that's what we need to do tonight if that's your desire can you stand to your feet and say let me be the Revival create in me a fervent desire to serve God created me a fervent desire to go to church created me a fervent desire to live for this message created in me a fervent desire to be an overcomer in this day create in me a fervent desire to have the Revival fires in me I'm here tonight to tell you Church you are not downtrodden you are not forsaken you are not forgotten but you are the Royal Seed of Abraham you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you're more than enough for the devil you're more than a match for that devil that's in your mind tonight you're more than an overcomer you are God's chosen generation you're the ones that God saw fit to place his word you are an overcomer I say keep the promises over the people I say keep the promises in the hearts of the people and let the people know we are in the land of promise and possessing our god-given rights tonight we are the Revival I wonder if we could just pray together if you'd play something there tonight if you have a desire in your heart tonight if you feel cold on God I say don't let tonight pass before you get down to that alar and say Lord let me be the Revival if you need hands laid on you we'll be happy to lay hands on you tonight listen church I'm not here to just just to have a Pulpit to preach in but I'm here to try to help somebody tonight Lord let me be the Revival let me be the person that is on fire with this message message let me be the one that'll stand on that street corner and say come and hear what God has done in this generation come see what God's doing in the hearts of his children I don't want just a new church but I want to be the Revival I don't want just some new seats to sit in I want to be the Revival I don't want my pastor to come back to the same people that he left when he went to Africa but I want him to come back and see a church on fire I want him to come back and see a church that is in Revival I say God send Revival in my heart tonight God send Revival in the hearts of the preachers tonight God send a heart in the in the hearts of the deacon Revival in the hearts of the deacon God send a heart a Revival in the hearts of every musician and and every lay member and every from the youngest to the oldest God send a Revival in our hearts to wake up that word that is planted in us tonight how many believes it's possible you say is it possible for Revival it is possible because he's here and where he is where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty I say chains can break tonight tonight chains are falling on the people tonight why because God is here and he's promised to set his children free God created me a Revival let me be the Revival Let each one of us be the [Music] Revival he said make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst I wonder if you just bow your heads from moment I want you to pray this just as a prophet did God created me a Revival let me be the Revival Let each one of us be the Revival the Revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me Lord that what is needed in me every one of us listen church every one of us have shortcomings every one of us get cold at times but let me be the Revival tonight when you come back to Shalom Tabernacle don't come back looking for people's faults come back saying I'm I'm going to be on I'm going to be on fire with a message and I'm going to come and if I'm the only person that gets anything out of this service let it be me tonight let me be the Revival brother BR would go on to say let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant I say every preacher in the building ought to say that every person in the building ought to say that let me be a consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humble how many needs more humble and humility here tonight more kind more willing to work yes you say well I'm just too busy to work for the house of God put God first put God first church listen I know it's it's cliche we say put God first but tonight I believe it's time for the people of God to put God first amen I believe it's time for the people of God to wake up and see the word has come not to just make you happy but to change you and to make you line up with this word of this hour glory and I love this part more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things in the past there's a lot of negatives in my past but I want to forget about them there's a lot of negatives in your past but I want to forget about your negatives I'm looking at a promised son and a promised daughter of God I'm not looking at what you were I see Overcomers in the house of God tonight amen I want to see the things that are positive I'm not going to look at the negatives somebody say that with me I'm not going to look at the negatives I'm going to see the positive in my pastor I'm going to see the positive in my brother I'm G to see the positive of the musicians I say let that critical spirit die let the word of God strengthen you tonight let the word of God water you tonight and let it change us here tonight amen I wish somebody just find your freedom in the house of God one time I say it's okay to shout a little bit it's okay to cry out to God and say change my heartj change me tonight make me different here in the house of God somebody ought to just say Lord you're worthy of it all you're worthy of it all you sense your word and you healed my disease you sense your word you change my heart you're worthy of my praise tonight I'm not here just to get blessed but I'm here to be a blessing I'm not just here to get something from God but I'm here to get back to God because he's given me more than I deserve yes let me press towards some Mark of the High Calling what if you just worship him here tonight church just worship him and say I know I know the time's up is he worthy of your worship did he send his word if he sent his word he's worthy if he sent his his word and changed you he's worthy if he brought you to the house of God tonight he's worthy of every praise you can give him I'm not trying to work you up here tonight but I think it's time somebody felt those chains fall one time and worship God one night they were in prison down there in the jail and Paul and Silas decided just to sing a little bit and worship God and guess what those chains started falling and I say here tonight if you can just worship over the word that has been preached the chains will fall in your situation those Chains Don't Have You bound they just seem to have you bound let go of them tonight God has Set You Free by the liberty of his word that has come this message is more than enough for me this message is more than enough for you let it change me tonight you young people I say let the message be the preeminence in your life let the message have the preeminence over your phone time let the message have the preeminence in your church let the message change you for who you are to what you want to be what do I want to be I want to be in the bride I want to be a part of that bride that is lining up with the word of God and I wanted to say tonight by confession I am the bride where's the Revival it's in me I am the bride's Revival I'm living this message now and I'm going to stay in this [Music] word if there's one of you that need prayer tonight I say the altar is open I hope that's okay in another church never been here before but I just feel the the presence of the Lord right here tonight I believe if you need something from God don't wait till Wednesday night don't wait till Sunday morning make this your night if you've got cold on God and you can't worship the way you want to I say surrender yourself here tonight Just Surrender it all you're worthy Lord you're
