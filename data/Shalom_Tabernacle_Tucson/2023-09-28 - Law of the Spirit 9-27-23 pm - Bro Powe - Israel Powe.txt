today and this evening Lord remembering those that would want to be here we ask your blessings upon those Lord the little group in Phoenix There Brother Art Brother Stevie we pray you bless them and those that are at home streaming and those that are gathered here may each one receive their portion tonight is our prayer we love you and we thank you we ask in jesus' name amen God bless you we'll take our Bibles and turn turn in scripture just a few things we want to speak on tonight um before we go to the Lord in prayer in Romans chapter 8 and then also we'll take of Psalms 51 Romans chapter 8 verses number one and two when you have that you can say amen amen therefore there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death amen thank God for that we take one more scripture in Psalms 51 this is a prayer of Psalm a Psalm of David he's crying out in this Psalm he says have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me against thee the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speaketh and be clear when thou judgest behold I was shapen in iniquity and in send that my mother conceive me behold thou desireth truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shal make me to know wisdom Purge me with his up and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow amen we like to take a little uh subject this evening on the uh law of the spirit and I trust it to be a blessing to you you can be seated law of the spirit and we're going to go a little bit further into this Jacob's Latter that we spoke on uh Sunday morning we thank the Lord that he has given us his word to live by amen and there's laws there's laws of the land there's laws in science there's the laws of electricity and gravitation and you have to respect those laws and then God has laws too they're laws in the spirit and we believe those laws that we just don't make them up as we go they're actually principles that God will honor that's his in his word and so we we take these keys from the word as we try to na navigate through this life I'm going to take and read a quote here in the message show us the father and it shall satisfy 1956 paragraph number 31 brother random says this now listen at this let me give you a little illustration here's a crop over on this hill and it's burning up for water can you hear me a crop on this hill are burning up for water and over on this hill you own both Hills and over on here's an artisian well just spurting up water going to waste now what if you stand out there and say I want this water to come over on my crops water I command you to go over there on my crops water I command you to go over there on my crops it'll never go over certainly not but there is a law of gravitation sure now if you can get the water over here if you'll work it the right way if you work according to the laws of gravitation you can bring that water around the mountain and throw it right on this side and irrigate that whole crop is that right you stand out there screaming water come over here water come over here it won't do it but if you work according to the laws of gravitation you get your water over there but you've got to work according to the laws of gravitation I mean I can imagine some of our prayers are like that we're screaming for things to happen happen or for God to do things or changes to be made in our life but there's a law that that of the spirit we got to work according to the the laws of the spirit just as we would in gravitation now Ben Franklin once said that there's enough electricity in a room to blow it up if the heat and so forth was separated the heat from the heat from the cold making the lightning or the electric now what if I stood out in the middle of one of these Great Big Woods night out here on the mountain you were saying oh electricity I'm lost out here I can't see a thing there you're here electricity I know you're here so all you electricity come on and light up the way and make me a way out the the electricity is there that's true but you don't get it that way you have to work according to the laws of electricity is that right if that electricity is brought down run through a generator out to a light it'll light the way to show you out yes but you got to work according to the laws of electricity the same way it is by God here's a sick man dying the doctor can do no more for him but he can he can't just holler hey Jesus I want you to come and heal me say I'm going to do this that won't work you got to work according to the laws of the spirit that's right see you got to work according to God's laws amen how many you know God has laws and those laws are his word and those laws are put in his word and they're there for a purpose they're not there just for us to memorize or hear them spoken to us that's good to memorize them that's good to hear them spoken but they're there to put in practice in our life we come to church and we come not to just hear a sermon but we come to hear words that we can put in practice for our Liv amen amen that's right I mean doable workable manageable pieces from the word that you can apply to your life maybe you know it or you heard it before but this time you hear it you're leaving out to find where can I actually make this work in my life how can I change my behavior based on what I just heard based on the word that I just heard and we know what A good sermon sounds like we know what an anointed Ministry sounds like and things that are said that can maybe tickle our ears and our desires and we'll know that it's good and we say that was a tremendous service God spoke to us but then we'll leave out and not even really put it into practice and I think that's a danger I think that that the reason why the word was spoken to you so you can grab it amen and then apply it in your life amen and so these are these are laws so Genesis 28:12 I read a scripture there Old Testament scripture about Jacob how many remember it that he was fell into this dream and then the dream he saw a a ladder going up to heaven and above the ladder God stood up there and then and he saw angels coming up and down that ladder we fast forward it and saw that in St John chapter 1 our lord Jesus is now speaking to a man had just come to him he showed him some things in his life and that really excited him about the things of the Lord that this man could know him he said that excited you he said from here forth you'll see Angels ascending and descend descending upon the son of man now uh we read some quotes we went One Direction there for you on Sunday and this evening I want to take a few quotes here in what brother random says about this Jacob's Ladder all right and this is in the message um the faith of Abraham paragraph number 53 he says this here I trust this to bless you I trust that you would look at that scripture differently I don't think you know those scriptures Genesis 28 and John 1 are not just Parables so as to talk about it's something that I can actually oh that's what that means and so today this is what I'm going to do based on what that scripture said there all right I was baptized by the Holy Spirit same one was upon Abraham baptized me in the same body I'm heir of every one of the promises if something looks just a little bit bit High I go get me a step ladder and get on it and examine it see what it looks like that's the way if Divine Healing seems to be a little out of my reach I got to get on my knees that's Jacob's Ladder and climb right on up in prayer till I find out what it's all about see see what I own it's mine it's yours it's all of youed if you believe it you was baptized by the grace of God into this great big arcade that got every Redemptive blessing in it everything Jesus died for is right here in the body of Christ healing salvation joy peace all these things belongs to you it's yours let the devil say oh don't you do it don't you do it that's that old nasty Porter at the door don't you believe in that walk right on in it's yours you got a pass you got an abstract Deed on the place if sickness dwells in there you got an abstract deed if you went home tonight and what if there's an enemy sitting in your house and the enemy said now wait a minute this house is built for human beings it's mine's just as much as it is yours I'm as much a human as you are you are right down to the court you get an abstract deed and you show him this is my property it belongs to me he say well yes but I'm as much as human as you are if he won't listen you can go get the law and the law will throw him out when you serve warning on the devil that he's got his nasty self camped on God's Property woo see yes if you don't want to get out just call on the authorities on Heaven amen God's law agent the Holy Ghost he will throw him out yes sir it's your property every Divine promise in the Bible belongs to every Christian when you're saved God gives you a checkbook at the bottom of it got Jesus name sign on every check and any Redemptive blessing belongs to you that's right are you afraid to fill it out in Abraham's children are you afraid he won't recognize the name of Jesus whatever you ask the father in my name that I'll do that's the promise you're Abraham's children you're not afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize the name of Jesus on any Redemptive blessing that his bodies sitting at the right hand of God making intercessions for that's what he died for Amen brother brother bam continues on says this here in the message Jehovah Gyra paragraph number 42 now you Baptists methodists and Presbyterians if you don't believe the Holy Ghost is right if you don't believe Divine Healing is right why don't you look through the arcade just look around pull out this drawer if somebody give me a big house I'd go around and see what the drawer if if somebody give me a house I'll go around and see what I own I'm nosy I like to get around and see what belongs to me yes sir so we need to be nosy well when I come into Christ I wanted to find out what I had amen I found out Divine Healing was mine Joy was mine Rivers flowing of life eternal power eternal life Grace all these things belong to me something looked a little high I got me a ladder and climbed up and pulled up and looked at it that's right if you see something something that I can't reach if I see something that I can't reach I just keep on praying on Jacob's Ladder till I get up there and look at it yes Lord I see where you give Visions The Works that I do shall you do also these things that I do shall you do also amen prophet of God says in the message forsaking all 1962 my last one on this he says this here paragraph number 995 that's what's the matter with Christians tonight God gives it to us but we're afraid to investigate it when you become a Christian you're air to every promise in the Bible now can I say that tonight that if we're Christians we're air to every promise in the message we believe the message don't we so every promise in the message belongs to the believer now the next guy might say we don't believe in that day or that day is pass but as a Believer the message becomes yours the Bible becomes yours and if there's something in the message or in the Bible that's a little too high that it's not in your realm then what do you do you don't complain about it you don't you know say it doesn't uh uh it doesn't work anymore you don't disbel know you get down on your knees and getting down on your knees it's for the purpose of climbing up higher so your faith can reach the point that that is mine and it's mine now I believe it I receive it brother bam calls that Jacob's Ladder so tonight we're about to get on Jacob's Ladder those of us that believe that these things Bel belong to us everything that God promis is yours it's just like a great big arcade by one spirit all baptized into this arcade which is Christ if somebody give me something I'm going to look around and find out what I own I think that's what Christians ought to do tonight find out what you've got if something gets a little high up that I can't reach it I'll get me a step ladder and climb up to it and if it seems a little Out Of Reach in the Bible that God has promised I'll stay on my knees and climb Jacob's Ladder till I reach it because it's mine God gave it to me if Divine Healing is Promised in the Bible and I'm sick I'll stay there till God gives it to me cuz it's a promise God promis I forsake the world he'll give me the Holy Ghost I'll stay right there till he gives it to me because he promised it if God promised to give me the desire of my heart and the desire of my heart is the right thing I'll stay there till God gives it because it's a promise and I forsaken all the world I want to walk after him and if he'll pay I know that to be the truth it's exactly right what did he do he forsook his land his country God give him the entire Province the whole continent of Palestine amen so this law one of these laws of the spirit is a life of prayer it's this is a prayer life it's not new news but it's very valuable news it's not a new thing that we never heard before as a Christian a Christian reads his Bible and prays every day but prayer isn't just you know it isn't just us uh spending time on our knees and saying a few words prayer is getting into an atmosphere when Jacob got out of that presence from that dream he said surely the Lord is in this place and this is the place that a Believer you can never pray too much I can actually preach too much and what I can be saying can be right out of the Bible I can sing too much and the songs that I would be singing will be correctly with the word I can talk too much I can do a lot of things too much in our service here but there's one thing we can't do too much and it's the law of God and it's part of who we are and that's praying because when we're praying that's bringing us to the level where God can give us the things that we have need of first we see it in the word as a promise and then we know that that promise is is it belongs to us and then we say okay I see this believer have it I see it in the Bible I see it in you know brother brandom's Ministry maybe then I'll see a brother or sister in our church that has it then I say well maybe I can have that too you know and then I can hope for it I can think and wishful thinking all of that that's good but I got to get down on my knees and actually pray for it and believe God for it even for the simple things I go brother random says here in um 1953 take a few quotations here and he's talking about prayer and he says uh in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 53 now the thing that thing creeped down until another age and finally it come out then we notice as the church become out into the Reformation it pulled off and pulled off from that time and got away from the spirit got away away from the spirit right on down until this last age when it's ready to consolidate itself and make an image unto the beast but that little Spirit shall live in the hearts of people until Jesus comes it's got to be bear that in mind we'll draw it out on the maps take the history and everything and show you that's it exactly that way let you take the history yourself and read it see what the Bible said and then what the history said see how it meets just exactly I like that oh may we all now just take may we all not just take this as a lecture but may we solemnly solemnly take the warnings of the Holy Spirit and pray day and night don't let nothing stop you from praying that's that's a solemn warning yes sir it's a simple warning but a powerful one it's a simple warning but it's very clear it's actually a warning we'd heard before it's a warning that Jesus told us he said the don't let that day come upon you unawares like a trap will ens snare you and then you know the eating and the drinking and the cares of this life will catch you like a trap you know what a trap is don't you a trap is set there's bait there there's a familiarity whatever you're trying to trap it makes it he feels comfortable that squirrel or that bird or the deer or a pig whatever you're trying to trap it's it gets to where you know it's a little and then you got the bait out there and then you and then you set it up to where he gets into an environment where he doesn't even know doesn't even know until bam the cage door closes and Jesus talk talked about the day that we lived in and he told us to watch and pray and it's true it's probably one of the hardest things that we can do to keep up on is our prayer life am I talking to myself yes sir yes sir how many know what I'm talking about to pray day and night so you're not caught so you're not caught with with with with your guards down yeah we're not talking about sinful things we're not talking about you know drinking in the things of the world of course we don't do those things we're just talking about not being caught up in your prayer life a warning it is a law of the spirit I can't I can't move up in God if I don't have a prayer life I'm not going to be sealed by the Holy Ghost I'm not going in the rapture without a prayer life I can't receive the Holy Ghost if I don't have a prayer life what's the next great thing you need in your life I guarantee you it will be acquired through your prayer life it's a law and many of us break it I break it we break that law but it's a law that God's not going to break we get in it it'll dig up our Liv Liv we get in it it'll it'll dig up the lives of those great men back there how they sacrifice you'll see how little you've done makes me feel ashamed of myself sometimes how we have to everything is so easy and they had everything so hard wondered about Paul said in Hebrews 11 sheep skins goatskins tormented Afflicted destitute what will our testimony stand bes besides theirs how will it be up besides of that and we have to have everything so nice here the prophet of God goes into the message the way of the true prophet he says this here this will come to our Psalms 53 scripture he says I do believe in a Purgatory Purgatory but I believe it's right now you purge your own soul Purgatory means to to purge when you see you done something wrong get out there and clean it out of You by confession and crying and fasting and praying someone even laughed at me when the Lord came here not long ago and give me a vision I've always wanted to see about binding that serpent I've always wondered how to I should step out like that when that's what I've wanted all my life then and I began to fast and pray he said what do you do that for I said in there he said I was not sincere enough after he come then I wanted to purge myself not wait till you die let some priest try to purge you purge your soul Amen brother random continues in the message the um testimony on the sea paragraph 127 brother random was talking he's talking about zachus and Rebecca his wife how she was praying for him to be saved the Lord was coming his way for dinner and he kind of gives a drama on it and he says this here paragraph 127 so the morning that he was to appear Rebecca must have prayed all night for her husband she wanted him to be saved that's the way you got to pray for people Prayer Changes Things so she must have prayed all night along about daylight little old zakus got up and put on his best clothes that he had you know and stepped out just told Rebecca he was going to get a fresh breath of air but that night maybe the Lord had been dealing with him according to Rebecca's thoughts and prayer now if you want God to save your husband or your wife just keep praying for them just keep praying that's all you have to do just keep praying and believing if there's any spark of Life there at all God will P put something across their path that they'll see it then if they reject it then that's up to them so we just keep praying don't we want to see a loved one saved you want to fight with them you want to argue with them you want to force them you want to dialogue with them and bring up things you know they disagree about no no pray for them it's a tremendous weapon it actually changes things you pray for your son your daughter pray for your brother and your sisters and those nieces and nephews and those family members that are not safe pray for them believe God it's the best thing you can do for him is call on God the law of the spirit is that when we pray he will hear us the scripture says that we know that if we pray that he will hear us and answer us amen you believe that tonight amen is this a prayer meeting yes it is a prayer meeting praise God Amen the message in indictment paragraph 265 prophet of God says this here now what did they do they didn't know it today men walk ignorantly they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough uhhuh let me read two more quotations for you all right and this is in the law of the spirit here brother brandom is taking this out of questions and answers paragraph 105 just about done here Paul said My Flesh wants always to yield to that your flesh does too see but the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do hallelujah look then if it will do that for a sinner then won't that work for sickness too the law of the spirit of God in the heart that knows that by his stripes we're healed they stand with their their power and make that sickness in that body obey them because it's a devil there you are whool that's got cream on it that deep I tell you that's it see now the law of sin and death works in your flesh but the law of the spirit of Life Works in your heart so your heart your your so your heart your spirit in your heart will make your body obey what it says do that's exactly right and that's what Paul said always the flesh I'm too tired I'm unable I'm not sufficient I cannot do it I said to Lois or Dolores or somebody that's been talking to me about the Holy Ghost about something or other like that I said the Lord said what made me feel that way just the time I should have felt good I said the Devil he's seen you just ready to receive it he said I'll put a little damper on her pH fan her a little bit you know kind of cool down a little see but oh my that's when you rise and claim your god-given rights that's what Paul was meaning see always when he said when I would do good evil is pre present so brother vom is talking about how the law works in your flesh but the law of the spirit is what's in your heart and the law of the spirit in your heart will overcome the law of your flesh and the law of your flesh is lazy doesn't want to pray it's too tired doesn't want to struggle doesn't want to fight for it wants everything instant instant instant but the law that's in your heart will stay there until you start to rise up that ladder rise up into the spirit and start claiming your God given privileges amen the restoration of the Bride tree the prophet says this paragraph 89 the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon him now that's a law in the spirit can we can we see it that way can we receive it that way it's a law in the spirit to take what God has rightfully given to you and claim it and enforce it to take place and how long should we do that we do that until God calls us off the Earth we do that until we receive what we're asking for we don't let up on that because God is in control he gives us the promise he reveal he he re uh reveals that word to us that promise to us and then we take that to the Lord in prayer and we can't have a selfish motive or selfish um um objective in our hearts it's got to be hum humility it's got to be God's perfect will for our life James 4 speaks very clearly of this in James chapter 4 it's really talking of prayer if you take a portion of that uh uh James chapter 4 and one and you bring it all the way down he says from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your own lust that war in your members you lust and you have not you killed and Des desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet you have not because see you cannot pretend you fight you War yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lust you adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God do you think that the scripture saith in vain that the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble that's a law in God did you know that the arival spirit that's what got Satan kicked out of heaven right that Pride was lifted up in his heart he had everything it looks like he should have been happy God had given him the right hand man he was a right hand to God and pride had got so that he did everything but he couldn't create and he couldn't receive worship like God but he wanted people to he wanted the angels to worship him remember in I think it's Revelations 12 when he was kicked out of heaven and the the Bible says Satan and his angels now Satan didn't have any angels of his own that he created he created nothing but he took angels He deceived angels and those angels came on his bandwagon with his agenda and that Spirit you'll see it it rose up in W with with with with Moses in Kora Kora still up says why Moses you're the only one you're the only holy one see with Judas that spirit rose up and you see that spirit and that Spirit wants to get on us too this why we God resists the proud proud heart you know you can be saying the right things and you could be Desiring something that is Honorable but if your heart has pride in it God resists that and James 4 makes it very clear he says wherefore he said God resist the proud but he giveth Grace unto the humble and then what does he say verse seven submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to you cleanse your hands that's purging again you Sinners and purify your hearts you double minded be afflicted mourn weep let your after be turned to morning your joy to heaviness humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and he'll do what and he will lift you up you know this prayer in our prayer should be the Lord allowing the Lord to purge US during this time lord Purge me with hisp and I'll be clean wash me and I'll be wider than snow this was a cry of David's heart after he made a tremendous mistake in his life and he got down in prayer and he asked the Lord to purge him and this is scripture the the the Purgatory you know the Catholicism I'm not very clear on what they believe on that some things I do know but on the Purgatory I get the understanding that that Purgatory is the place that dead the people that lived in they died there's still a chance for them to be saved through purgatory and the people that are alive can pay so much money as they're being purged through this Purgatory time something like that something I'm not real clear on it but of course you got to be dead in order for this cleansing to take place and brother Bron makes that very clear he believes in purgatory but it's right now it's like Wednesday night it's Purgatory it's where we per Purge our hearts from worldly desires and even the things you know before you speak a word it's a thought first we want the Lord to purge our thoughts you know the words are what we said and somebody maybe caught us cuz we said it but if we thought something that ain't right don't you want God to purge my thinking Purge it before it becomes a word Purge me with his up Purge me with the blood Purge me Lord with your word that I can be cleansed wash me that I can be wider than snow it's interesting how the James 4 is talking to Believers he's talking about the wars that's amongst them and this envy and fighting and only through contention through pride is contention comes through the pride I think brother Joel brought that out to the men yeah I think proverbs 10 I believe it is that it's through Pride that we start flexing against one another that's a heart problem that's something wrong in your heart because you desire more than what you're supposed to have or you think that you should be you know more respected better or more acknowledged or you know more whatever it is whatever the contention is coming where does it come from from your own heart he tells us from whence come the wars and fighting among you why are you fighting among yourself come they not hint of the own lust that wore inside of you so where's the purgey need to be we look good we look clean but some of us need the inside cleansed out amen Purge Me Lord Purge my thoughts Purge what I really want let it be about you purge my desires let it be about you purge my reputation let it be about you purge my Ministry let it be about you my Praise My Worship whatever I'm doing in the name of the Lord Purge me Lord that it would be pure that it will be clean that it will be right and then I can come to you with a humble heart you know when Satan made his great move against God and I have to close now when Satan made his great move against God the Bible says that iniquity was found in his heart he operated with with this great power he's beautiful actually the most beautiful you think he would have been happy to be the most beautiful the most talented the closest to God all of these pluses all the jewels in the Carles that that Ezekiel 28 explains all the beauty that was found in his being he was an anointed cherub he led to worship he had the best position of all the angels and it wasn't n't enough because his heart wasn't right and if your heart ain't right doesn't matter what position you get it doesn't matter what anybody throws at you or gives you if your heart ain't right you ain't right and until your heart gets right you'll never be right Purge My Heart Lord Purge my motives Pur my desires Purge the innermost underlining under lining being of who I am my Essence Purge that Lord and let it be clean and Satan had all of this and if the individual's heart ain't right they'll gripe and complain you give it to them wait a few minutes a week or two they'll be griping and complaining about something else why it's a heart problem Paul said whatever state I find myself let me be what let me be content this man's in a prison this man got the greatest Ministry outside of the Apostles and he's talking like in a prison he should be he should have his own church all bills paid Paul we talking about Paul who went to the third heaven Paul who was visited by the Lord himself and here he is in the prison broke about he got beaten twice 39 Stripes his life he was stoned he's in the prison broke nothing no Fanfare nothing people trying to take his life and here he's talking about that whatever state I find myself I'll be content that's a man of God that's a servant of God that's an example of a true servant thank God for him I was reading the other day something that the historians say and mostly all of them agree that Jesus is the people that went to hear Jesus 90% of them were illiterate dumb people people that couldn't read I mean the known world it was not the known world wasn't real literate you had to you educated people that are liter but most of his disciples were ignorant and unar unlearned they didn't know how to argue laws of Moses fighting with people arguing but they had the spirit of God in them and they had a revelation of who Jesus was and they knew who they were in God they had a revel isn't that what we want isn't that what we desire it's not what we know what we know sometimes lifts us up in Pride because we know more than you or them so we get lifted up and Paul was the only really smart one among them and God had G him so many Revelations that he had to drop this sickness in his body he said because of the abundance of the Revelation the Lord had to and the Revelation and the sickness in his body kept him humble didn't it amen Lord keep us humble purging with hisp it's a law of the spirit and we're going to call on God tonight in this law of prayer if you don't have it you can receive it through getting on your knees in Jacob's Ladder God bless you God bless you tonight amen we'll close in prayer just the sermon part Father in heaven we thank you for the word spoken here tonight a few words I pray that encourage the hearts of your people may each one receive the portion that they need oh God as we come to this tremendous part of the service the enemy wants to bring up how much sleep we need to get and how late it is every time we start to think of this getting in contact with you this anointed ladder where the spirit of the Lord is seems how the Satan comes in the member of our bodies and tell us how tired we are and what tomorrow and it's late and oh God I just pray that the law of the spirit would rise up in our hearts to really get in focus to get on in the position to be raised up to the level that we need for the things that the word has told us are that belong to us these great promises that the law of the spirit is to enforce those promises to come back to us Satan take your hands off of my praise my joy my family my life take your hands off I belong to Jesus Lord we know that's the law of the spirit I pray that we let that law operate in us tonight let it start working even simply from tonight forward we would start to really meditate on this portion of the word that these are laws that you respect you place them in there and that are tomorrow will be like no other Thursday before because we'll be applying your word in our life let that be that way even right now Lord we bring these requests to you we pray we ask in Jesus name amen amen praise the lord we have
