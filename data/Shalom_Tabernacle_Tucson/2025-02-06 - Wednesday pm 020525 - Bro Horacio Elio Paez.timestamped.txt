[39:04] espíritu un espíritu receptivo en esta
[39:08] tarde que seguro que desea la
[39:12] palabra desea llevarse algo en su
[39:18] corazón Mi nombre es Horacio
[39:21] Páez Yo soy de
[39:24] Argentina una ciudad llamada Mendoza
[39:29] una ciudad viñera donde se produce el
[39:32] vino que prácticamente se le vende al
[39:37] mundo pero ahora estoy radicado en el
[39:42] Ecuador mi esposa es
[39:45] ecuatoriana nos casamos en
[39:49] Ecuador en
[39:51] 2011 y nos fuimos a vivir a Argentina
[39:57] unas algunas cosas que sucedieron en el
[40:02] tabernáculo problemas de
[40:06] adulterios y son esos momentos que uno
[40:09] tiene que ver si se para por la palabra
[40:11] o
[40:15] no y al pararnos por la
[40:19] palabra nos cerraron la
[40:23] iglesia quedamos más de 120 hermanos en
[40:26] la calle
[40:29] pero no nos afligía
[40:33] morir ya conocíamos que teníamos un Dios
[40:37] poderoso y seguimos caminando
[40:41] hermanos el pueblo me pidió que mi idea
[40:45] era volverme al
[40:48] Ecuador pero el pueblo me pidió que me
[40:51] quedara y les
[40:54] ayudara el Señor me llamó en el 2000
[40:58] al trabajo
[41:01] evangelístico yo no quería saber nada de
[41:03] un
[41:06] pastorado Yo sé que no fui llamado a ser
[41:10] pastor Necesito un carácter especial
[41:12] para ser
[41:15] pastor se necesitan las fuerzas de Dios
[41:18] para llevar a cargo una
[41:21] iglesia quería escaparle ese
[41:25] trabajo her si los dejaba solo todo se
[41:29] se disipaba
[41:33] así que me quedé con
[41:36] ellos y comenzamos a edificar un nuevo
[41:39] un nuevo
[41:40] templo y a tratar de mantener el
[41:43] grupo para que siguieran
[41:46] adelante encaminar algún varón para que
[41:49] se quede al
[41:52] frente y por la gracia del señor se
[41:54] logró después de 12 años
[41:58] Y entregué la la
[42:02] obra quedó allí al frente un
[42:06] varón y con mi familia decidimos
[42:10] entonces venir a vivirnos al
[42:14] Ecuador y retomar el llamado que el
[42:17] Señor me
[42:20] dio Así que
[42:22] desde desde hace un año
[42:28] estoy nuevamente en el campo
[42:31] evangelístico e no soy un Evangelista de
[42:35] gritos y de de poner al pueblo a
[42:40] bailar mi predicación es un poco más

[45:43] señor
[45:46] Jesucristo en el año que murió el rey
[45:48] ías vó al Señor sentado sobre un trono
[45:51] alto y sublime y sus faldas llenaban el
[45:54] templo

[46:06] rostros con dos cubrían sus pies y con
[46:08] dos

[46:20] diciendo santo santo santo Jehová de los
[46:23] ejércitos toda la tierra está llena de
[46:25] su gloria
[46:33] y los quiciales de las puertas se
[46:35] estremecieron con la voz del que clamaba
[46:37] y la casa se llenó de
[46:43] humo entonces dije Ay de mí que soy
[46:46] muerto Porque siendo hombre inmundo de
[46:48] labios y habitando en medio del pueblo
[46:50] que tiene labios inmundos han visto mis
[46:53] ojos al rey Jehová de los ejércitos
[47:06] y voló hacia mí uno de los serafines

[47:10] tomado del altar con unas
[47:20] tenazas y tocando con él sobre m sobre
[47:23] mi boca dijo he aquí que esto tocó tus

[50:05] señor
[50:07] Jesucristo Amén pueden sentarse mis
[50:13] hermanos vamos a como tema en esta
[50:18] noche ataduras
[50:22] desatadas ataduras desatadas
[50:27] y un
[50:29] subtítulo el señor lo
[50:33] necesita Entonces vamos a tomar otra
[50:36] escritura pero vamos a primero a poner
[50:38] una pequeña base en la vida de
[50:44] Isaías Dios lo había llamado a Isaías a
[50:47] ser un
[50:49] profeta sabemos que los profetas no se
[50:51] hacen ellos
[50:53] nacen él había nacido profeta
[50:57] pero dice el profeta cuenta la historia
[51:00] de de
[51:03] Isaías y que él creció junto con
[51:07] ías el cual era el Rey de Israel de
[51:13] Jerusalén y ellos eran muy
[51:16] amigos y el rey comprendió El
[51:18] llamamiento que Isaías
[51:21] tenía Y entonces vio que estando con
[51:24] Isaías él tenía bendicion
[51:29] jnt con alguien espiritual y usted
[51:31] tendrá
[51:33] bendiciones juntese con un mundano Y
[51:35] usted va a terminar
[51:38] pecando Depende depende con quien usted
[51:42] ande Esa será la clase de vida que
[51:46] llevará Josafat por andar en malas
[51:50] compañías se metió en muchos
[51:53] problemas y a veces yo creo nosotros
[51:57] como
[51:59] cristianos andamos en muchas malas
[52:01] compañías
[52:03] hermano y por eso tenemos muchos
[52:05] problemas también
[52:07] hermano nosotros tenemos la gracia de
[52:09] Dios que vino a nuestras
[52:12] vidas porque nosotros estábamos atados a
[52:14] un mundo
[52:16] pecador estábamos atados a la muerte y a
[52:18] los
[52:20] delitos doblemente muerto dice la
[52:23] escritura estábamos atados a muchas
[52:25] cosas del mundo
[52:28] aú muchos de nosotros estábamos atados a
[52:30] la religión
[52:33] católica Yo era uno de
[52:35] ellos hab me habían atado con el
[52:37] bautismo
[52:39] católico me habían atado con la comunión
[52:42] católica me habían atado con la
[52:44] confirmación
[52:46] católica no sé A cuántos Santos estaba
[52:49] yo atado encomendado
[52:51] hermano pero Dios me
[52:54] necesitaba ent tuvo que venir a mi
[52:58] y desatar esas
[52:59] ataduras hacerme plenamente libre
[53:02] hermano para que yo pudiera servirle a
[53:05] él
[53:05] hermano y eso es lo que hizo Dios en
[53:08] este tiempo a través de un
[53:10] profeta él envió un mensaje
[53:13] libertador para liberarnos a todos
[53:16] nosotros de los credos de los
[53:19] dogmas de las doctrinas hechas por los
[53:22] hombres cuando llegó esta luz a nuestras
[53:24] vidas
[53:26] cuando esta palabra amaneció en nuestros
[53:29] corazones nosotros fuimos desatados de
[53:31] todas
[53:32] ataduras caminamos libre durante un
[53:35] tiempo y con el pensamiento que el señor
[53:38] ya
[53:39] venía que el rapto ya iba a
[53:42] acontecer Oh Cómo fuimos despojados de
[53:44] todas cosas del mundo
[53:47] hermano de todo peso de todo pecado que
[53:50] fácilmente nos
[53:54] asediaba y muchos esperaron el 77 con
[53:57] grande
[54:00] expectativa y otros esperamos el 2000
[54:02] con grandes
[54:05] expectativas aquellos que esperaron el
[54:07] 77 con Grand
[54:10] expectativa al no suceder nada se
[54:14] desilusionaron y se ataron de vuelta al
[54:17] mundo los que esperaron con grande
[54:19] expectativa el
[54:22] 2000 y no sucedió nada se disolucion
[54:27] Se volvieron a atar al
[54:29] mundo y así vamos cada vez como el señor
[54:32] como que tarda su
[54:35] venida nos olvidamos que Dios nos hizo
[54:37] libr de todas esas
[54:39] cosas y estamos volviéndonos otra vez
[54:43] atar él vino para desatar noos y al que
[54:47] él
[54:48] desate verdaderamente desatado
[54:51] quedará Porque el Señor nos necesita
[54:53] hermanos
[54:59] pero Isaías se había atado al rey
[55:02] usas él estaba muy cómodo con el rey
[55:05] ías él no tenía miedo a
[55:08] nada porque estaba protegido por el rey
[55:11] ías se transformó en un hombre
[55:16] legalista no le estaba sirviendo el
[55:18] propósito al propósito de
[55:22] Dios si usted lee el capítulo 5
[55:26] usted va a encontrar muchos alles para
[55:28] para todos los
[55:30] demás eh si usted lee el capítulo
[55:33] TR usted verá cuán legalista es
[55:37] Isaías Oh pero Dios tuvo que sacarle
[55:40] Dios tuvo que desatarlo del Rey
[55:43] ías Dios tuvo que sacarle al rey usias
[55:46] de
[55:47] lado Dios tuvo que sacarle la muleta en
[55:50] la que él se
[55:52] apoyaba Y entonces dice la escritura
[55:56] en el año en que murió el rey
[55:59] ías no en el momento que él
[56:02] murió sino en el año que
[56:04] murió quiere decir que había pasado un
[56:07] tiempo Y a Isaías no lo estaban tratando
[56:11] igual mientras él estaba bajo la
[56:13] protección de
[56:15] osías Isaías era
[56:18] Intocable nadie podía hacerle
[56:20] nada porque el rey le caía
[56:23] encima Pero ahora no tenía quien lo
[56:25] ayudara
[56:27] ahora no tenía quien lo
[56:28] defendiera si él daba una profecía
[56:31] fuerte él era rechazado él era
[56:35] amenazado él comenzó a sufrir algo que
[56:39] lo que antes no
[56:40] sufría entonces en el año en que murió
[56:42] el rey
[56:44] ías fui yo al
[56:46] templo ahí se acordó que había un
[56:49] Dios que había que
[56:51] buscar que había que pedir
[56:53] ayuda que había que unirse con ese dios
[56:57] si Dios es con
[56:58] nosotros quién contra
[57:00] nosotros con Jehová somos mayoría
[57:03] Amén pero tenemos que ir a buscarlo
[57:06] hermano Amén y no lo vamos a encontrar
[57:08] en un
[57:10] sistema lo vamos a encontrar en la
[57:12] palabra
[57:13] hermano Cuántos lo entienden hermano am
[57:16] Bendito sea el nombre del
[57:18] señor y él llegó allí al
[57:20] altar y él se derramó delante el altar
[57:23] del
[57:24] señor comz a a
[57:27] clamar Oh él hizo como hizo
[57:30] Jacob cuando la escritura dice que Jacob
[57:32] peleó con Dios
[57:34] verdad no es que se agarró a
[57:38] puñetes fue una noche de
[57:40] confesión de contarle a Dios lo que no
[57:43] quería
[57:44] contarle de confesar lo que él no quería
[57:48] confesar de reconocer lo que no quería
[57:51] reconocer Oh el hombre a veces no se
[57:54] quiere humillar
[57:56] pero Dios Dios tiene una manera para
[57:58] humillarnos
[58:00] porque él nos necesita hermano cuánto lo
[58:03] entiende
[58:04] hermano y él se derramó delante del
[58:07] señor y cuando él comenzó cuando é él
[58:11] comenzó a reconocer su
[58:14] condición una visión se le abrió Oh él
[58:18] vio el gran trono de
[58:21] Dios alto y
[58:24] sublime no estaba mirando este trono
[58:26] aquí
[58:29] Terrenal la visión lo llevó a la
[58:33] gloria y allá vio Vio la santidad en ese
[58:38] trono la santidad de
[58:40] Dios vio la alabanza verdadera de
[58:44] Dios vio esos querubines alabando al
[58:47] señor y ellos no estaban cantando en
[58:51] secretos ellos no estaban cantando a voz
[58:53] baja
[58:56] oficiales del templo se
[58:58] estremecieron ese templo tembló hermano
[59:01] Amén Oh ese templo en la gloria tembló
[59:04] hermano Amén Se movió todo todo fue
[59:07] sacudido hermano Amén y vio aquellos
[59:10] ángeles que con dos alas cubrían su
[59:12] rostro con dos cubrían sus pies con dos
[59:16] con dos volaban verdad Oh y él
[59:20] comprendió
[59:21] hermano que para una vida con
[59:25] éxito necesita vivir en reverencia
[59:27] delante de
[59:28] Dios se necesita ser humilde delante de
[59:32] Dios y permanecer en
[59:35] acción qué Qué es permanecer en acción
[59:38] hermano porque Ed usted puede estar
[59:40] reverente delante de Dios usted puede
[59:43] estar humilde delante de
[59:45] Dios pero pero si no está en
[59:48] acción tu obra está en
[59:51] completa cuando la la manera de
[59:53] permanecer en acción delante de Dios
[59:57] es que vivamos Por
[59:59] fe y por la fe hermano que pongamos por
[1:00:03] obra esa fe que una vez le fue dada a
[1:00:05] los
[1:00:07] santos y que hoy fue restaurada por
[1:00:10] malaquías 4 en nuestras
[1:00:12] vidas gloria sea al
[1:00:15] señor y y y entonces el templo se llenó
[1:00:19] de
[1:00:22] humo él vio que había juicio hermano
[1:00:27] él sabía que era
[1:00:28] profeta y él no había cumplido el papel
[1:00:31] de
[1:00:32] profeta como Dios lo
[1:00:34] quería él era era el hombre que tenía
[1:00:36] que anunciar del
[1:00:39] mesías era el que tenía que decir por
[1:00:42] por qué medio iba a venir El
[1:00:45] Mesías qué es lo que iba a hacer ese
[1:00:47] Mesías en la
[1:00:49] tierra Pero él estaba preocupado en
[1:00:51] otras
[1:00:52] cosas Entonces entonces vio que había
[1:00:56] juicio sobre el
[1:00:57] altar y entonces es donde clamó aún con
[1:01:02] todo su
[1:01:03] corazón él él él había dado muchos
[1:01:06] halles para mucha
[1:01:08] gente muchos halles para muchas
[1:01:11] naciones pero ahora dijo Ay de
[1:01:14] mí ahora vio que había un hay hacia
[1:01:17] él porque era un hombre de laios
[1:01:21] inmundos nunca había alabado al Señor
[1:01:24] nunca le había cantado una alabanza
[1:01:26] oh Dios nos ayude
[1:01:28] hermanos cómo están sus labios
[1:01:31] hermanos Cuántas alabanzas puede usted
[1:01:33] cantarle al
[1:01:34] Señor usted no puede esperar venir aquí
[1:01:37] a cantarle una alabanza al
[1:01:39] Señor usted en su casa en su trabajo en
[1:01:42] la calle tiene que ir susurrando una
[1:01:44] alabanza al
[1:01:45] Señor para asegurarse que el señor vaya
[1:01:48] a su
[1:01:49] lado si no de otra manera andamos
[1:01:51] caminando solos
[1:01:53] hermano confiados tal vez en el pastor
[1:01:56] local él está orando por usted o
[1:01:59] confiado que tiene una iglesia muy
[1:02:01] bonita o somos uno somos un un Isaías
[1:02:05] con un ías nada
[1:02:07] más pero Dios nos ayuda en esta noche
[1:02:10] hermano a que esos bastones salgan de
[1:02:13] nuestras vidas am
[1:02:14] muletas Oh y y y caminemos con él
[1:02:18] hermano y lo busquemos a él hermano Amén
[1:02:21] Gloria sea al Señor Entonces cuando él
[1:02:24] vio que había juicio hermano Amén
[1:02:26] Entonces él clamó Ay de mí Amén y
[1:02:29] terminó de reconocer lo que le faltaba
[1:02:31] hermano Oh gloria sea el señor como
[1:02:35] David una vez que también confesó sus
[1:02:38] pecados sus
[1:02:40] faltas también confesó sus
[1:02:43] fallas pero después dijo líbrame de
[1:02:46] aquellos que me son
[1:02:48] ocultos siempre queda algo
[1:02:51] hermano gloria sea al Señor oh Dios nos
[1:02:55] ayud
[1:02:57] entonces él le había quedado algo
[1:02:59] todavía hermano era reconocer que era un
[1:03:02] hombre de labios y el mundo no era que
[1:03:05] él decía malas
[1:03:06] palabras no era que él andaba diciendo
[1:03:09] cosas
[1:03:11] irreverentes Oh solo le faltaba que esos
[1:03:13] labios fueran endulzados más con la
[1:03:18] palabra con una alabanza al
[1:03:20] Señor Amén y entonces cuando él
[1:03:23] reconoció eso y que vivía en medio de un
[1:03:25] pueblo con labios
[1:03:29] inmundos la gracia del señor descendió
[1:03:32] Amén Oh y uno de esos querubines
[1:03:35] hermanos Amén como una tenaza y con ella
[1:03:39] agarró un carbón
[1:03:41] encendido y y tocó los labios del
[1:03:44] profeta y le dijo ahora es quitada tu
[1:03:48] culpa ahora es purificado tu
[1:03:51] pecado ahora está ahora eres
[1:03:54] desatado ahora estás
[1:03:57] libre Ahora el Señor te puede
[1:03:59] usar todo este tiempo el Señor te ha
[1:04:02] estado
[1:04:03] necesitando y tú no estabas cumpliendo
[1:04:06] el propósito del
[1:04:08] señor él fue desatado en ese momento
[1:04:11] am él tenía atados sus
[1:04:15] labios él tenía atados sus ojos él nunca
[1:04:18] había visto La gloria de
[1:04:20] Dios solo había visto la gloria de
[1:04:23] ías es muy bueno a él Oh hermano toda
[1:04:28] Gloria terrenal puede ser
[1:04:30] buena pero aquella Gloria es la que
[1:04:33] necesitamos hermano porque está
[1:04:36] prometido que esa Gloria va a venir a
[1:04:37] morar dentro de
[1:04:39] nosotros Porque toda la Tierra tiene que
[1:04:42] ser llena de su
[1:04:44] gloria y esa Gloria tiene que estar en
[1:04:47] nosotros Esa es la gloria que tenemos
[1:04:49] que
[1:04:50] ver la gloria de Dios en nuestras vidas
[1:04:53] reflejada en simplicidad
[1:04:55] reflejada en sencillez en un espíritu
[1:05:00] amable
[1:05:01] apacible
[1:05:03] afable Oh gloria sea al
[1:05:07] Señor
[1:05:09] Entonces él fue
[1:05:11] desatado
[1:05:13] eh de sus
[1:05:15] ojos para que pudiera ver esa
[1:05:18] Gloria y aún desatado de las ataduras de
[1:05:21] sus
[1:05:23] oídos a mí me gusta la parte de el
[1:05:25] versículo
[1:05:27] 8
[1:05:30] después O sea después oí la voz del
[1:05:35] Señor una vez que fue desatado de sus
[1:05:39] oídos Cuántas veces el señor lo habrá
[1:05:42] estado
[1:05:43] llamando como como llamó a Adán allá en
[1:05:46] el jardín del
[1:05:48] Ed Adán
[1:05:50] Adán dónde estás tú y y Adán no podía
[1:05:54] responder
[1:05:57] porque él estaba en
[1:05:58] pecado ve y cuántas veces Dios habrá
[1:06:01] estado llamando a
[1:06:04] Isaías Isaías no podía no podía oír la
[1:06:07] voz de
[1:06:09] Dios porque solo él oía la voz de
[1:06:12] usas Qué diferencia con
[1:06:15] Samuel como Samuel pudo oír la voz de
[1:06:17] Dios en el primer momento que Dios lo
[1:06:21] llamó aunque él no la reconocía
[1:06:25] pero oyó la voz de Dios él no andaba con
[1:06:28] las orejas tapadas los oídos
[1:06:31] tapados mire como como el los ha
[1:06:33] atado hoy día
[1:06:34] hermano poniéndole esos auriculares ahí
[1:06:37] metidos en las
[1:06:38] orejas para arriba y para abajo con esas
[1:06:41] cosas ahí en sus
[1:06:43] orejas Cómo cómo van a oír la voz del
[1:06:46] señor si están oyendo otras cosas sus
[1:06:50] oídos tapados con el Modernismo del
[1:06:53] mundo necesitamos ser desatados
[1:06:56] Hermano Dios hizo estos oídos
[1:06:58] hermano para oír la voz de Dios pero
[1:07:02] estamos oyendo cualquier otras voces
[1:07:04] hermano y eso quiere decir que estamos
[1:07:06] atados y necesitamos ser desatados
[1:07:09] hermano el Modernismo no tiene por qué
[1:07:13] tomarnos Isaías
[1:07:15] 54 dice que Ninguna arma
[1:07:19] forjada prosperará contra
[1:07:22] ti y esos auriculares metidos ahí

[1:08:19] si entonces después oí la voz del señor
[1:08:25] después que fue
[1:08:27] desatado entonces pudo oír la voz del
[1:08:32] señor Isaías era un
[1:08:35] pequeño Jeremías era un
[1:08:38] pequeño se años y él Pudo ir la voz de
[1:08:43] Dios Amén Qué nos está pasando a
[1:08:47] nosotros por la por qué la la así
[1:08:50] llamada iglesia del
[1:08:53] mensaje se está atando a las cosas
[1:08:58] a
[1:08:59] modas a ropas
[1:09:03] viles al modernismo de
[1:09:07] hoy Dios nos
[1:09:09] ayude nos hemos atados a
[1:09:12] tradiciones estamos siendo atados por
[1:09:16] por dogmas que se están
[1:09:19] levantando Dios nos ayude porque él
[1:09:22] necesita esta novia
[1:09:26] gloria sea
[1:09:28] Señor Jeremías
[1:09:31] 175 dice Así ha dicho
[1:09:42] Jehová Maldito el varón que confía en el
[1:09:47] hombre y pone carne por su
[1:09:50] brazo y su corazón se aparta de Jehová
[1:09:56] Dios tenía que hacer algo con
[1:09:58] Isaías porque si no iba a caer en este
[1:10:00] pensamiento del
[1:10:03] señor Maldito el varón que confía en el
[1:10:09] hombre Dios tenía dos
[1:10:13] hombres uno se llamaba
[1:10:15] Isaías el otro
[1:10:17] ías pero Isaías era el
[1:10:21] profeta era El Vocero de Dios
[1:10:25] eran los ojos de Dios en la
[1:10:28] tierra eran los oídos de Dios en la
[1:10:31] tierra eran las manos de Dios en la
[1:10:35] tierra ías era el
[1:10:37] rey de su
[1:10:39] pueblo y Dios tuvo que sacrificar su
[1:10:43] Rey para poder rescatar a su
[1:10:47] profeta oh Dios nos
[1:10:49] ayude porque él sacrificará todo lo que
[1:10:51] está a nuestro alrededor
[1:10:55] su novia esté
[1:10:56] libre para que ella cumpla el propósito
[1:10:59] por el cual fue
[1:11:01] llamada No había necesidad que Dios
[1:11:03] hiciera eso
[1:11:06] con pero Isaías se le estaba escapando
[1:11:09] de las
[1:11:11] manos Dios tendrá que hacer algo con
[1:11:14] nosotros Porque nos estamos escapando de
[1:11:16] las manos del
[1:11:17] Señor Lucas
[1:11:21] 19 versículo 29
[1:11:25] y aconteció que llegando cerca de
[1:11:27] betfagué y de betania al monte que se
[1:11:30] llamaba de Los Olivos envió dos de sus
[1:11:40] discípulos diciendo ID a la aldea de
[1:11:43] enfrente y al entrar en ella hallaréis
[1:11:46] un pollino atado en el cual ningún
[1:11:49] hombre ha montado jamás desatarlo y
[1:11:52] traerlo
[1:12:04] Y si alguien os preguntare por qué lo
[1:12:06] desat le responderé así porque el señor
[1:12:10] lo
[1:12:16] necesita qué tremenda escritura
[1:12:20] hermano Qué hermosa
[1:12:23] descripción cuando unimos esto con la
[1:12:25] escritura de allá de Zacarías
[1:12:31] 9 donde está la profecía de
[1:12:35] esto de este
[1:12:38] acontecimiento el profeta aú aclara más
[1:12:40] todavía
[1:12:42] allí el señor vendrá manso y
[1:12:46] humilde Cabalgando en un
[1:12:49] pollino hijo de
[1:12:53] asna Qué necesidad había
[1:12:56] de que el señor
[1:12:57] dijera o
[1:12:59] aclarara que el pollino era hijo de
[1:13:03] asna Simplemente que me diga que es un
[1:13:07] pollino Yo entiendo que es hijo de un
[1:13:12] asna Si me hubiera dicho un
[1:13:15] potrillo yo s que es hijo de un
[1:13:18] caballo si me dice un
[1:13:21] ternero yo hijo de una
[1:13:24] vaca en pero el Señor por algo dejó
[1:13:27] especificado eso
[1:13:30] ahí que ese pollino era hijo de una
[1:13:33] asna y cuando se cumplió Esta
[1:13:37] profecía vemos que
[1:13:40] realmente estaba
[1:13:42] allí el
[1:13:44] asna y también el
[1:13:46] pollino ahora esa
[1:13:49] asna ya tenía experiencia en la vida
[1:13:55] ya conocía
[1:13:57] caminos ya había
[1:13:59] trabajado ya tenía
[1:14:01] experiencia Ya había recibido muchas
[1:14:05] [Música]
[1:14:06] mañas ya tenía demasiadas malas
[1:14:10] costumbres el señor quería algo que no
[1:14:12] tuviera malas
[1:14:14] costumbres el señor quería algo algo
[1:14:18] nuevo porque la escritura nos
[1:14:22] declara que sobre este pollino
[1:14:25] nunca nadie había
[1:14:27] montado la Anna ya estaba
[1:14:30] manzada pero al maestro no le
[1:14:33] servía por eso el profeta
[1:14:36] dijo hay una iglesia que sale de una
[1:14:40] iglesia la novia sale de la
[1:14:43] iglesia la iglesia tiene malas
[1:14:45] costumbres la iglesia tiene viejas
[1:14:48] costumbres ella se torna
[1:14:51] mañosa Ella se cree que las sabe todas
[1:14:53] hermano
[1:14:55] pero la
[1:14:56] novia es diferente Amén el pollino era
[1:15:01] diferente Que obra más maravillosa hizo
[1:15:03] Dios
[1:15:04] allí porque ese pollino era Era una
[1:15:08] bestia era Era un animal como todos los
[1:15:11] demás
[1:15:12] animales nunca había sido
[1:15:15] montado en cuanto Jesús se subiera
[1:15:18] Arriba ese animal iba a
[1:15:21] corcovear ese se iba a parar en sus dos
[1:15:23] patas delanteras
[1:15:26] él iba a levantar sus patas
[1:15:28] traseras él iba a tirar la carga que en
[1:15:31] este caso Era
[1:15:32] Jesús porque estaba él no estaba
[1:15:35] acostumbrado a llevar carga
[1:15:38] hermano ve Pero qué pasó Ahí
[1:15:42] hermano Yo creo que esa mano cariñosa
[1:15:46] del
[1:15:48] maestro ese espíritu dulce del
[1:15:51] maestro cuando él puso la mano sobre el
[1:15:53] pollino
[1:15:55] poder sentarse montarse en
[1:15:57] é la naturaleza del pollino fue
[1:16:01] cambiado cuá lo entiendo
[1:16:04] hermano es una obra sobrenatural que
[1:16:06] sucedió
[1:16:08] allí había que ir a
[1:16:11] Jerusalén había que ir a morir por
[1:16:13] nuestros
[1:16:14] pecados había que salvar a la
[1:16:17] humanidad no había tiempo que
[1:16:19] perder pudiera haber dicho él
[1:16:22] Entonces no vamos a perder tiempo
[1:16:24] adestrando este
[1:16:26] asno mejor cabalgo en el
[1:16:31] asna Pero él sabía que una obra corta y
[1:16:35] rápida se podía hacer hermano Amén cuá
[1:16:39] lo entiende hermano una obra corta y
[1:16:41] rápida rodeará la tierra
[1:16:44] hermano Oh ese asno Y esa y ese
[1:16:48] pollino ambos estaban
[1:16:52] atados pero Dios u pollino
[1:16:56] hermano fueron desatados los dos pero
[1:16:59] Dios usó al
[1:17:01] pollino él estaba ordenado hermano para
[1:17:04] cargar la palabra para llevar la palabra
[1:17:07] hermano cuán lo entiende
[1:17:10] hermano Él dijo ve y
[1:17:14] desatarlo porque Y si alguien te
[1:17:18] pregunta d El Señor lo necesita
[1:17:25] iglesia a que van a ese tabernáculo
[1:17:28] shalom a ser desatados por la
[1:17:31] palabra porque el Señor nos necesita
[1:17:34] hermano hay una obra que llevar a cabo
[1:17:37] hermano el el El tercer jalón está a la
[1:17:40] puerta
[1:17:41] hermano Oh la palabra hablada se tiene
[1:17:44] que
[1:17:45] manifestar los hijos de Dios tienen que
[1:17:47] darse a
[1:17:49] conocer necesitamos ser
[1:17:51] desatados y que la mano del maestro
[1:17:55] o haga la obra en nuestras
[1:17:56] vidas el profeta cuenta la
[1:17:59] historia de de ese violín que estaba
[1:18:02] todo
[1:18:03] viejo y lo iban a subastar
[1:18:06] verdad Y él lo levantó a ese violín que
[1:18:09] todo lo
[1:18:11] vieran y dijo quién da algo por
[1:18:15] esto y alguien dijo
[1:18:17] un y él dijo alguien da
[1:18:20] más alguien da
[1:18:23] más a la
[1:18:26] y alguien se levantó de allí
[1:18:28] atrás y caminó hasta donde estaba el
[1:18:31] varón que estaba haciendo la
[1:18:33] oferta le pidió el
[1:18:36] violín tomó el arco se lo
[1:18:40] acomodó y empezó a
[1:18:42] tocar digamos solo creer todo es
[1:18:47] posible Sublime gracia del
[1:18:50] señor y dejó de tocar
[1:18:55] preguntó quién da
[1:18:58] más y alguien dijo
[1:19:01] 000 otro
[1:19:03] 10000 Y así fue elevando el
[1:19:06] precio Hasta que se vendió en un precio
[1:19:08] bien
[1:19:10] elevado alguien preguntó y dijo qué hizo
[1:19:13] la
[1:19:15] diferencia la mano del
[1:19:18] maestro am eso hizo la diferencia con
[1:19:23] aquit una bestia igual que
[1:19:26] cualquiera no estaba acostumbrado a
[1:19:28] llevar
[1:19:30] carga Pero cuando el maestro se subió
[1:19:33] arriba de
[1:19:34] él cuando la palabra lo montó
[1:19:37] hermano gloria sea al
[1:19:40] señor este anito había venido al mundo
[1:19:42] con un
[1:19:44] propósito todos venimos al mundo con un
[1:19:48] propósito era
[1:19:50] llevar o mejor dicho cargar la palabra
[1:19:58] quiero marcarle la diferencia en dos
[1:19:59] palabras
[1:20:01] aquí no es lo mismo llevar que
[1:20:05] cargar usted puede llevar llevar a Dios
[1:20:08] de la
[1:20:09] mano usted puede llevar la palabra en el
[1:20:13] intelecto Pero cuando ella va en el
[1:20:16] corazón usted ha cargado la
[1:20:19] palabra la palabra va allá
[1:20:21] adentro gloria sea al Señor cuánto lo
[1:20:24] entienden
[1:20:28] nació este este pollino nació en una
[1:20:31] granja nació en un
[1:20:34] sistema algo hecho por el
[1:20:37] hombre por lo tanto estaba
[1:20:40] denominado y toda cosa
[1:20:43] denominada
[1:20:45] organizada está
[1:20:47] atada y sin hacer la voluntad del
[1:20:51] señor Dios necesitaba al pollino
[1:20:55] la voluntad del señor era que llevara la
[1:20:59] palabra trasladara la
[1:21:01] palabra de un lugar a otro en medio del
[1:21:06] vecindario en medio del
[1:21:08] trabajo por donde usted anda por donde
[1:21:10] usted
[1:21:11] va ese es el propósito de Dios gloria
[1:21:15] sea al
[1:21:16] señor pero mientras uno te
[1:21:19] atado no puede cumplir el propósito por
[1:21:22] el cual vino
[1:21:25] gloria sea al
[1:21:27] Señor podemos ver a
[1:21:29] Jacob otro hombre
[1:21:32] atado atado por la mentira
[1:21:34] hermano ust sabe que la Biblia habla de
[1:21:37] eso están los que aman la
[1:21:39] mentira están los que hacen
[1:21:42] mentira aquellos que la hacen son los
[1:21:44] que dicen esta mentirita blanca para
[1:21:49] que el señor entiende el señor
[1:21:52] sabe Pero cuando fue predicador a la
[1:21:55] presencia del Señor noer el
[1:21:59] nombre el señor le dijo has
[1:22:01] mentido y cuando él iba a decir que
[1:22:04] no ahí apareció una pequeña mentirita
[1:22:10] chiquitita y delante la presencia del
[1:22:13] Señor vino a ser una mentirota

[1:24:00] huir su suegro labán representaba la
[1:24:04] muerte tuvo que cruzarse Dios en el
[1:24:07] camino y cuidado con

[1:24:16] tercer

[1:32:54] gloria sea al Señor tenemos que
[1:32:56] actualizar la
[1:32:58] palabra vemos la creación misma
[1:33:01] gimiendo clamando porque ella está
[1:33:05] atada está
[1:33:07] sujetada está
[1:33:10] esclavizada romanos
[1:33:12] 8:20 porque la creación fue sujetada a
[1:33:15] vanidad no por su propia voluntad sino
[1:33:18] por causa del que la sujetó en Esperanza
[1:33:27] porque también la creación misma será
[1:33:29] libertada de la esclavitud de
[1:33:36] corrupción a la libertad gloriosa de los
[1:33:38] hijos de
[1:33:41] Dios los hijos de Dios son primero
[1:33:45] desatados los hijos de Dios son
[1:33:47] primeramente
[1:33:49] libres y cuando la naturaleza ve a los
[1:33:52] hijos de Dios
[1:33:55] caminando
[1:33:56] libres dando testimonio de la
[1:34:00] palabra cargando la palabra en su
[1:34:03] corazón entonces ella comienza a
[1:34:06] clamar a extenderle a usted los
[1:34:09] brazos pidiéndole
[1:34:11] ayuda pidiéndole
[1:34:14] auxilio pidiéndole
[1:34:16] Socorro que ella quiere ser desatada
[1:34:20] también y ella sabe que allá en el
[1:34:23] principio
[1:34:25] ella fue sujetada al hombre a
[1:34:29] Adán y el mismo
[1:34:31] Adán la ató
[1:34:34] hermano a muerte a
[1:34:36] perdición pero ella sabe que vendrán los
[1:34:39] hijos de Dios
[1:34:41] nuevamente y que por los hijos de Dios
[1:34:44] Ella será liberada
[1:34:46] nuevamente gloria sea al señor
[1:34:56] Dios envió a malaquías
[1:34:58] 4 para que desatara del sistema
[1:35:01] organizado a la
[1:35:05] iglesia y ella se ató aún más en el
[1:35:09] mismo tiempo del
[1:35:12] profeta gloria sea al Señor ella no
[1:35:16] quería ella no quería ser desatada
[1:35:19] hermano ella no quería esa libertad
[1:35:21] gloriosa hermano
[1:35:24] prefirió seguir atada y aún se ató más
[1:35:26] con sus credos sus
[1:35:29] dogmas Aún se ató más fuertemente con un
[1:35:32] cordón de tres
[1:35:35] dobleces con el con la doctrina de la
[1:35:39] Trinidad oh Dios nos ayude
[1:35:42] hermanos y nosotros estábamos ahí verdad
[1:35:45] pero Dios nos desató de eso
[1:35:48] herman ahora veamos esto hermano el
[1:35:52] Espíritu Santo
[1:35:54] atado hermano lo dice el profeta
[1:35:58] hermano pero el Señor lo
[1:36:01] necesitaba era tiempo de que su hijo
[1:36:04] Jesús Por así
[1:36:07] decirlo no estoy dividiendo y tratando
[1:36:09] de decir dos personas yo sé que hay una
[1:36:11] sola
[1:36:14] persona pero él dijo No es bueno que el
[1:36:16] hombre esté
[1:36:17] solo ha llegado la hora de que su hijo
[1:36:20] se casece
[1:36:23] que su esposa se ha
[1:36:26] aparejado y y ese trabajo de
[1:36:28] aparejamiento
[1:36:30] solo lo puede hacer el espíritu
[1:36:33] santo Entonces él necesitaba el espíritu
[1:36:37] santo pero el espíritu santo fue atado a
[1:36:40] través de las
[1:36:42] edades y el señor lo
[1:36:44] necesitaba Pero él estaba atado entonces
[1:36:48] había que
[1:36:49] desatarlo y en los días de la voz del
[1:36:51] Séptimo Ángel
[1:36:53] Oh Eso fue para desatar al Espíritu
[1:36:56] Santo el título de redención estaba
[1:36:59] atado o el gran misterio de Dios Estaba
[1:37:03] atado aquello que iba a traer fe de
[1:37:05] rapto a la
[1:37:06] novia Estaba atado con siete sellos
[1:37:09] verdad gloria sea al Señor Oh pero eso
[1:37:13] fue desatado hermano en este tiempo
[1:37:16] hermano Amén porque el señor necesitaba
[1:37:20] hermano que todo el misterio estuviera
[1:37:22] desatado
[1:37:24] que el libro de redención estuviera
[1:37:26] desatado que el título de propiedad
[1:37:28] estuviera
[1:37:30] abierto ya no
[1:37:32] enrollado sino
[1:37:33] abierto habitando en el corazón del
[1:37:36] hombre y para para ese trabajo hermano
[1:37:40] se necesitaba el espíritu
[1:37:42] santo había que
[1:37:45] desatarlo dice
[1:37:47] profeta fíjese aquí hay algo
[1:37:51] grande miren
[1:37:54] Oh
[1:37:54] hermano el espíritu santo ha estado
[1:37:57] atado por las
[1:38:00] denominaciones todos estos 2000
[1:38:04] años Aleluya Oh hermano dice ve el
[1:38:09] espíritu santo ha estado atado por estos
[1:38:12] Ríos
[1:38:15] denominacionales por casi 2000
[1:38:19] años pero ha de ser desatado en el
[1:38:21] tiempo del Atardecer
[1:38:25] por el mensaje del tiempo del
[1:38:29] atardecer el espíritu
[1:38:32] santo de regreso en la iglesia
[1:38:36] nuevamente Cristo
[1:38:38] mismo revelado en carne
[1:38:41] humana en el tiempo del
[1:38:44] atardecer él lo dijo él lo
[1:38:48] prometió lo entiende hermano Qué gran
[1:38:51] obra ataduras
[1:38:55] estamos hablando de todo esto
[1:38:58] atado y siendo
[1:39:00] desatado por un solo
[1:39:03] propósito que el señor lo
[1:39:07] necesitaba Dios necesita el Espíritu
[1:39:09] Santo
[1:39:11] desatado para que fuera en el Ministerio
[1:39:14] del hijo del
[1:39:16] hombre a desatar a a los hijos de la
[1:39:19] Simiente
[1:39:22] real de las ataduras
[1:39:25] dogmáticas ataduras eclesiásticas de
[1:39:29] tradiciones hechas por los
[1:39:31] hombres y ese espíritu santo
[1:39:35] libre se ha metido en un ministerio
[1:39:39] quíntuple Apóstoles profetas
[1:39:43] evangelistas pastores
[1:39:46] maestros para que ellos

[1:40:02] ataduras o que nos quieren atar en este
[1:40:05] tiempo para que cumplamos el propósito

[1:40:12] profeta fíjese Allí está
[1:40:16] ahora ella ha sido
[1:40:20] desatada para llamar todos estos Cabos
[1:40:22] sueltos
[1:40:25] gloria sea al
[1:40:27] Señor mire hermano estoy

[1:40:36] ejército de 200 millones de
[1:40:42] demonios Cristo los encerró en su propio
[1:40:46] muladar pero luego fue
[1:40:49] desatado porque el señor lo necesita
[1:40:53] hermano el señor necesita el
[1:40:55] el señor necesita al
[1:40:58] él hizo al malo para el día
[1:41:02] malo oh Dios nos ayude pudiera entrar en

[1:41:10] Trump está en el
[1:41:13] poder y ahora salen a decir que es un
[1:41:16] hombre
[1:41:17] malo hermano es profecía
[1:41:22] cumpliéndose si el profeta dijo que esta
[1:41:24] nación está
[1:41:26] quebrada y yo yo como visitante vengo a
[1:41:29] esta
[1:41:31] nación y yo no la veo que esté
[1:41:34] quebrada y muchos saben que no aparenta

[1:41:41] quebrada pero la palabra ya
[1:41:44] habló yo no lo voy a

[1:42:13] Señor Apocalipsis 9 versículo
[1:42:18] 1 El quinto Ángel tocó la
[1:42:21] trompeta y una estrella que cayó del
[1:42:24] cielo a la Tierra y se le dio la llave
[1:42:26] del Pozo del
[1:42:33] Abismo y abrió el pozo del Abismo Y
[1:42:36] subió del pozo como humo de un gran
[1:42:39] horno y se oscureció el sol y el aire
[1:42:41] por el humo del pozo
[1:42:53] humo salieron langostas sobre la Tierra
[1:42:55] y se le dio poder como tienen poder los
[1:42:57] escorpiones de la
[1:43:04] tierra versículo

[1:43:09] jinetes era 200 millones yo oí su
[1:43:18] número el profeta en el mensaje la

[1:44:06] trompeta ahora no hay 200000 el profeta

[1:44:14] millones ahora no hay 200000 Jinetes en

[1:45:01] guerra que habían estado atados en el
[1:45:04] éufrates por todos estos
[1:45:08] años diablos
[1:45:11] sobrenaturales que es el viejo Imperio
[1:45:14] Romano siendo
[1:45:17] revivido la persecución de los judíos
[1:45:23] casi 2 años en el río
[1:45:28] eufrates no podían cruzar hacia la

[1:46:43] parecido a lo
[1:46:45] verdadero que engañaría los Escogidos si
[1:46:48] fuera
[1:46:50] posible pero él prometió tener algo aquí
[1:46:52] para
[1:46:54] nosotros en ese día para que no fuéramos
[1:46:58] engañados Y eso es la
[1:47:01] palabra y a

[1:47:11] ojo pero uno puede ver lo que ellos
[1:47:14] están
[1:47:15] haciendo Dios necesitaba estos
[1:47:19] diablos Dios necesitaba estos
[1:47:21] demonios para traer el juicio sobre la
[1:47:24] tierra para castigar al
[1:47:27] incrédulo para castigar al
[1:47:29] burlador para castigar al impío
[1:47:32] hermano pero para preparar a la novia y
[1:47:35] para librar a la novia Ella él
[1:47:38] necesitaba al Espíritu
[1:47:40] Santo Así que él desató al Espíritu
