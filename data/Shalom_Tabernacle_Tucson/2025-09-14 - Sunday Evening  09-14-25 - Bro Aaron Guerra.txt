It's always nice to see you fine folks. I wish some of you can come up and stand up here and just look at the beautiful crowd sometimes. So, God bless you. Welcome you to the house of the Lord. We have a friend of the ministry here, Brother Aaron Gara. He's a good brother to us. He's minister us to for us a number of times and we're so happy to have him with us. His wife's there in the back. God bless her. and um he is um one of us, Tucson, Arizona. &gt;&gt; And so we're uh happy to have him with us. This is his first time with us in this uh in this building or tabernacle. So we were testifying back there a little bit. So as he prepares, this wasn't planned. So I didn't announce it this morning because I didn't know. I had a little thought that I had been working on. And then of course there's a nice tape that I was thinking of and then I got this headache after lunch and I was going to push my way through it and then I got a text from brother Joe that some of the tabernacle folks um what are you all doing? Working on that thing keep working on it. Keep cancelling keep cancing services. So, I'm so glad uh I got one of my friends to come and help me sling the sword of the Lord. Amen. So, I get to hear some good preaching tonight. And so, let's stand to our feet and welcome our brother and we'll sing the old hymn of the church, Amazing Grace. Amen. Grace, how sweet the sound that says like [Music] I once was lost, but now I'm found. was fly now. I see. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. One more time. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads and just continue playing that. &gt;&gt; Lord, what more could we do but to give you all honor, &gt;&gt; all glory? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Cuz me in my best, I could do nothing to get myself to heaven. But you knew that. and you said, "I'll go into his place and I'll take all his sin. I'll take all his iniquity. I'll take all his wrong and I will bear it to Calvary and I'll give my life for him." And we just want to tell you, you're worthy of all honor, all glory, and all praise, Lord. Thank you for your goodness, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. [Music] Show I knew about maybe an hour ago that we would be ministering, but we had intended to come and um kind of uh pretty well all my friends here. I hope they're all my friends. Thank you. I've always appreciated your pastor, brother Israel. I've always appreciated his spirit, his and as we've aged a little bit. He's still chasing me. But you grow, you learn. If you're not learning, uh, that's not a good thing. So, but, uh, something that I ministered here recently, I'm I love to be able to help someone. Can I give you something that will help you? Um, you know, I just recently retired. Uh, just shy of 50 years of work and probably forgot more than I learned. But there are some things you can still reach out and help somebody with, you know, experiences you've gone in life. And that's what the what the elders are here for, to encourage the younger ones &gt;&gt; to say, "You can make it. You can do it. &gt;&gt; It's doable. I'm here by the grace of God, by his mercy. So, the thought is something I heard and and I'll read it to you. I read and heard and and you guys stay up on the don't they don't let you sit down? Well, is it okay if they you may go and sit? I'm not going to sing no more. Not when you have brother John and some good singers here. No, I don't. But um just something I read and it starts a thought if if you've ministered before. Um sometimes it's just something you read. See &gt;&gt; and it starts out brother Brandham is walking and there's a a cigarette package there. &gt;&gt; Most of us would have gone a long ways around it &gt;&gt; so that nobody would even think in any way that we had any association with that. But it caught his attention, picks it up and he read a thinking man's filter comes out from that sermon, from that thing. And you and I would never look at something like that. So sometimes God talks to you in a way that you wouldn't expect, &gt;&gt; but you just you learn to know how he talks to you. You know, I have six daughters and they were all at times treated as a group of six daughters, but they were also individually spoken to. My oldest one being 10 years older than her youngest sister. There was a time that she was uh she was a teenager before her youngest sister. So, her youngest sister didn't get to do what she did because she hadn't got there. But then her younger sister got to that age and she got included. As you grow in Christ, there are things that God does with you because you've matured in Christ. &gt;&gt; You've grown in Christ and he's willing to share more with you, &gt;&gt; you know, and so, but those of us that have have gone, we've learned, we've made more mistakes than you have because we've lived longer. &gt;&gt; But we've also learned more because we made more mistakes. And sometimes God has to reach just like a father or a mother has to get your attention and say that's not right. That's not good. And I'm glad he does. &gt;&gt; I would like I want to get there on that day and find out that I made so many mistakes I can't go in. &gt;&gt; But he he said look and then I was able to repent. &gt;&gt; And then when the slate and when it's open it doesn't there's no nothing wrong. He said there's nothing. It's all covered by the blood &gt;&gt; and every one of us is welcome. And we must come to a place in our lives that there's no one that we would put outside. &gt;&gt; No one. Because I didn't do anything to deserve it, but the the the the amazing grace of God. So, just like to read you this, and this is what brought the thought. It's you're holding a cup of coffee when someone comes along and bumps you or shakes your arm, making you spill the coffee everywhere. So why did you spill the coffee? Well, cuz somebody bumped me. I mean, he says, "No, because you had coffee in your cup. If you didn't have anything in your cup when they bumped you, you wouldn't have spilled anything." So that started what comes out of me when I get bumped, when I trip, when I make a mistake. What what comes out of me is what's inside of me. You spill coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea. Whatever is inside the cup is what spills out. Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you, which it will happen, &gt;&gt; if you lived a little bit of time, you've been shook. You've been troubled. Whatever is inside you will come out. It's easy to fake it until you get rattled. I don't know about you, but I there's this mirror in our bathroom, and I don't like that guy in there. &gt;&gt; And my wife comes in, she says, "I put it up because it's beautiful. How come when I stand in front of it, it doesn't look like that?" Sometimes when we compare ourselves to somebody else, &gt;&gt; oh, look at they're good Christians. They're wonderful Christians. They've got it made &gt;&gt; and they're looking at you. You're a wonderful Christian. You've got it made. &gt;&gt; But it's when you look in the mirror &gt;&gt; that's when you have to look at yourself. &gt;&gt; We have to ask ourselves then, what's in my cup? When life gets tough, what spills out? Joy, gratitude, peace, humility, or anger, bitterness, victim mentality, and quitting tendencies. This is the 10th time I've done this week. I give up. &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Life provides a cup. You choose how to fill it. &gt;&gt; You make the choice. What is going in my cup? Today, let's work toward filling our cups with gratitude, forgiveness, joy, words of affirmation, resolence, positivity, and kindness, gentleness, and love for others. &gt;&gt; If God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, &gt;&gt; while we were yet sinners, &gt;&gt; he said, "I'll go and I'll die for them." &gt;&gt; How could you not love a God like that? You know, brother Brandham, and let me let me get this quote here in the message, go tell my disciples in 53. He says, I used to say about speaking down here about the old spring I used to drink from. It was bubbling and jumping and jumping and jumping down around Miltown. I used to wonder why that spring jumped. So one day I sat down and I was talking to it. Imagine a man talking to a spring. Yeah, we we we talk a lot all the time just going down the road saying, "No, I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done this." You know, he said, "Can you imagine?" But I was talking to nature who made the spring and I wondered what makes you so bubbly, so jumpy. Is it because that the children come here and drink from you or I drink from you or something? Then he says this. If the spring could have spoke back, he would have said, "No, Billy. It isn't because you drink from it. It isn't because anybody drinks from me. It's something down beneath me here pushing me and making me bubble and jump and carry on like this." &gt;&gt; So when it comes bubbling up and something you don't like comes out, that's God's mercy saying, "Hey, we need to work on something." Because if everything looks good and you think it's every right, but you get there on that day and then all a sudden it says you knock on the door and say, "I don't know you. &gt;&gt; I've never had to work with you. I never had to deal with you. I &gt;&gt; But Lord, every day, let us say, Lord, search me, oh God. &gt;&gt; Look at my heart. Look at my attitude." And and help me to be willing to say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; It's hard for human for human just to say, "I'm sorry. I was at fault." and and he took all my fault &gt;&gt; when he was not guilty. &gt;&gt; Let's see. There was there was I don't know if I brought the other was another one, but it was kind of the same thing. So I I look at it this way and we go to um in in Acts and I put these in order and then I scrambled them. So, oh, here's the other one I was looking for. And it's similar, but it's he goes, "At a high school reunion, a group of successful alumni, now doctors, lawyers, business owners. I've been in the message for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years. I've got my degrees in the message. I've learned." &gt;&gt; No, we don't do that, do we? just when we're awake decided to visit their favorite teacher and they chatted about their careers and families. But soon the conversation shifted to life's pressure, stress, constant chasing after more. We to wonder sometimes why we're tired. &gt;&gt; You know, in God there's rest &gt;&gt; and everything else is a struggle, &gt;&gt; but sometimes we'll struggle for it. After listening a while, the teacher smiled and said, "Hold on a minute. I'll go make us some coffee." He came back with a large pot and a tray full of cups, and none of them matching. Some of them fine porcelain, others were plain ceramic, a few were chipped glass mugs, and one even looked like it came from a old diner. Everyone reached for a cup. The professor watched in silence. Once they all had coffee in hand, he said, "Notice just what happened. Most of you instinctively reach reach for the nicest cups." Leaving behind the simpler ones. It's normal to want the best for ourselves, but that's often where the stress begins. He gestured toward the cups. The cup doesn't make coffee taste any better. What you really wanted was the coffee, but you were still focused on the cup. And that's one reason why we ask Christ to clean us, to wash us so we don't give a wrong testimony. But we are not leading someone to ourselves. &gt;&gt; We are leading them to Christ. That that's what we're trying to do. Life is a copy. Coffee. Your job, your house, your income, your status. All those things are just cups. They help contain life, but they don't define it. And the trouble is the more we focus on the cup, the more we miss out on the coffee. &gt;&gt; Lord, I would have got a good good blessing today if I hadn't made a mistake today. Because that's all that was on my mind during church. I messed up today. I messed up today. I messed up today. or brother so and so is here in church and I know he's got a problem and that's all you got at the church service. If God would allow us to see what he sees when he looks sometimes I think we would all be embarrassed at times. He says remember happy people don't always have the best of everything but they know how to make the best of what they have. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, my car is not brand new, but it got me here. Didn't have to push it either, but some days you do have to push the car, and you tell thank God for that, you know. So there's so many things you could say, but just just to forgive is to liberate a prisoner and to discover that the prisoner was you. You were bound by what you were going through &gt;&gt; while you're looking at others and judging them by what you're going through. But the prisoner is you. And until you realize, you have to reach out and say, "God, have mercy on me. Let my light shine. Let Christ be the one that has seen in me." Okay. So, what will you do with the issues, the struggles, the problems, the temptations that come your way? And everyone has temptations. And maybe what's your temptation is not my temptation. And I look at you and say,"Wh are you struggling with that?" And you're looking at me and saying, "Why are you struggling with that?" But that's how we help one another. &gt;&gt; You know, I sometimes I think back of as raising our our daughters, you know, some of the things we did and we wish we could do them over. We had not done them that way. We had done this. I I we were just moving into where we live now and um I needed a tool and we had just met the neighbors and they had three daughters and somebody across there were so many kids in our yard all the time. Everybody came to play in our yard and um which was okay. I'd rather have them in my yard than maybe my kids in their yard. I don't know what's going on over there. But I wanted to know if the neighbor had a rake I could borrow. So I sent one of my daughters. can you go over there with the neighbors because you know the kids there and she turned around and sent her little sister and that's what brothers and sisters do to each other. Okay. Well, my younger daughter ran out right in front of a car. She didn't look. Fortunately, the car was going slow enough it hit its brakes and stopped. There was nothing happened. But my oldest daughter got in a lot of trouble for that. Daddy was mad so he took it on the the eldest daughter when really dad should have gone across the street and God asked first place. Okay, we got to we just got to be careful. Just got to stop for a minute and look at at this. Yeah. So So you find out you are the prisoner, the one that needed to be set free. What will you do with the issues, struggles, problems, temptations that come your way? And they will. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that doesn't have to struggle with problems sometime? Man, you're excused. You can go home now. You've passed the test already. But no, it's a daily thing. &gt;&gt; We are being observed by those around us at home, at work, at church, at school, and when we're out and about. &gt;&gt; That's right. and our sisters and I appreciate that the way they dress and they go out and I appreciate that they do it because they want to. &gt;&gt; Okay. When you're forced to, that's a different because when you're forced to, the attitude comes out. I'm wearing this but not because I want to. I have to. But when when you're a sister and even the brothers dressing like gentlemen and all, when it's part of you, it's part of you, you know, and and that's a good thing. So again, when we're out and about, there are people looking at us. And what's in your cup is going to be made known. &gt;&gt; And for we know it's Christ in us, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory &gt;&gt; for me and maybe my neighbor and the stranger that I meet. How do I know that's not a child of God? &gt;&gt; Everyone should be looking at someone. Everyone is they could possibly be a child of God. I should offer them what I have. That's where Peter says in let me get that scripture real quick here. Acts chapter 3 verses 3-6. They had just come out from that experience up up in in the day of Pentecost where it's Christ in us now the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; All that God had wanted to do. It wasn't just to bring Jesus Christ and have him. If I could say it this, it was paraded in front of everybody to see how great God is, but rather God wanting to be with his family. &gt;&gt; He would come every day to visit with Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; And do you think he didn't know what happened on that day? &gt;&gt; He still came down and said, "Adam, Adam, Adam." As he knew exactly what had happened, but he still went calling them. He didn't turn his back on them. Because inside of him was a redeemer, &gt;&gt; was a savior. Everything that God was was going to come out of that cup. And the same thing in you, everything in you is going to come out of that cup. Peter says, and we know we he's coming out. They've come they've received the Holy Ghost. They're going and they're they didn't stop going to church. They were on their way to church service that morning. It says who serving Peter and John about to go into the temple asked of alms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us and it says he gave them heed expecting to receive something of them. Now you and I when we interpret that we say he was expecting some money something to help. But look, there are people walking down on this earth right now that need something &gt;&gt; that you have. &gt;&gt; And when they look to you and they say, "Do you have a dollar?" Maybe that's not what they're really wanting. They're wanting some hope. They're wanting something in their heart and they're seeing something you being reflected out of you. And you go like this and they get disappointed. Sure, there are those that just want money. I understand that but that which is in you is going to come out. So he gave heed expecting something of them. Then Peter had said silver and gold have I none. Just because I'm a Christian and I believe this message didn't make me rich didn't give me money. But that's not what it's for. &gt;&gt; God said I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world and I will meet your needs. &gt;&gt; And we just trust him that. Now, sometimes we try to tell them how to do it. I don't think any of your boy, your son or your daughters ever tried to tell you how to manage your money as long as you gave them some. It was uh going back a few years now and um a quarter bought a lot. This was in the 60s when I was a kid. You could go to the store and get three big candy bars and five little candy bars for 25 cents. And that was for good for about a whole hour maybe. You know, today a quarter you'll walk by it, not even pick it up anymore. But you know the value of what you place on something, is it worth eternal life? Then you'll give your all for it. Peter says, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have." Peter could not have given it if Peter didn't have it. &gt;&gt; It's not my job to run to your pastor or your job to go to your pastor to give to somebody you. It's his to give it to let you know that you can have it &gt;&gt; that it can be part of your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's not based on on brother Israel building a big congregation so they no if his heart is right. He is desirous for you to get to know this God &gt;&gt; that it's personal with you &gt;&gt; that if you're by yourself it's no different than you being with the whole congregation. &gt;&gt; Remember they came up to him and said this whole group of people is hungry. And Jesus said, "You know, ah, go down to that warehouse. They have 6,000 fish in there. Go over." No. He said, "What do you got?" &gt;&gt; I got three fish and I got this. He go, "Wow, way more than enough." &gt;&gt; And he just began to give out what was in him. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, brother. I've got to go pray for an hour before I can help you. No, we should be at a place where we can give. where we can give. Such as I have, I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Rise up and walk. Wow. I never realized it had Christ in him till I just read that scripture. Read the Bible. You'll find so many things that God is telling you. I asked him one day because when my daughters were were growing up and getting their cars and getting insurance and all and um I called the insurance agent and I said uh cuz they girls got a car when they could afford it and we couldn't buy insurance because when you have six daughters, you can't afford six daughters that way. But I called him up and um I talked to him a bit. I said, "How are my girls on the insurance on their cars?" I think three of the girls were had their own cars then. And this were his words. He said, "Aaron, if all the parents were like you, we wouldn't have the problems we have." Wow. What do you mean? He said, "You've brought your daughters up, right? They come and they pay for their insurance or they send it to me and if they're going to be a day late, they know. They let me know." And he goes,"I have a lot of parents that come in and pay the insurance for them because the kids won't do it." And I thought to myself,"Wonderful. I can drive down the road a lot happier and a lot more peace that way." But as I was driving the road after that heading on to work, it just came to me. I Lord, I said, "But what about my daughters? Is there a a insurance between them and you?" Man, he took me right to the scripture where Job laid a sacrifice every morning in case his children had sinned. &gt;&gt; I don't know if God ever opens the Bible to you like that, but he does for me sometimes. He'll just say, "There it is." I just said, and he goes, "And just as Job did it, I will honor your prayers for your daughters." &gt;&gt; I was one happy I stayed on the road honest. &gt;&gt; I was one happy dad. I mean, I was rejoicing. So, just a few days after that, I'm I'm reading through a message and brother Brandham and and you know, sometimes if I'm I'm looking for something, maybe brother Bam said organ and I'm going through it and I I went up five four or five paragraphs and and started reading down and he says like any good father would do. He said just like Job's father laid a sacrifice every morning. I said, "Man, double confirmation. What more do I want?" &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; you still worry about him. &gt;&gt; You're still troubled about him. You know, but I have a God and he's the same God you have. &gt;&gt; They can watch over them all. &gt;&gt; Every once in a while, they would come home and say, "Dad, can I talk to you?" You remember the other day, um, I got a little upset with you and I said this and this. It was one of my daughters and I said, "Yeah." She said, "I just want to tell you I'm sorry cuz I I said this and this. It wasn't mean, but she just she was one of the younger ones. She wanted to do what her older sisters could do." And you know, and I let her and she says, "Uh, you know, when I did this and I was driving, well, I got pulled over by a policeman and I got a ticket and I'm sorry. I did I didn't respect you as my father." He goes, "I know that that's why I got stopped because of the attitude I had towards you. I wanted to get the same privileges of my older sisters. You know how happy that makes a father &gt;&gt; and you just thank you Lord because you did it. I didn't do it. &gt;&gt; It wasn't forced on him. That's what Peter said. Such as I have I give unto you. He didn't turn around and say, "Hey, James, you got any extra? You got any you got any cash in your pocket?" &gt;&gt; No, he said, "Such as I have. Now watch this. In Luke 8:37-39, we know this was the man that Jesus had come up and found him, that the demon-possessed man. Then the whole multitude of the country of the gatherings around besought him to depart from them, for they were taken with great fear and went into the ship, and returned and looked back in. Now the man of whom the devils had departed besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, I like this part, return to thine own house, and show thee how great things God has done unto thee. And he went his way, published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. Because now in his cup that could be given out or spilled was the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He had had been received redemption. He had received healing. He had received so much he said such as I have now I can give. And and so again here is what's in your cup because that's what's going to come out. Okay. If we look at Psalms 16:2, "Oh my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, thou art my Lord. My goodness extendeth not to thee." Or, "Oh my soul, you have said to the Lord, you are my Lord, I have no good but you." in my best efforts in all that I do. And we should give our best efforts and do everything as good as we can. &gt;&gt; But that will never save you. &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; The goodness of God. And we have to understand it's the goodness of God that we are where we are. &gt;&gt; And I don't know that I would have chosen me if I was God. But that's why I'm not God. &gt;&gt; Because he's perfect. because he's perfect. Proverbs 18:4 and I'll read the the I I used a couple of different word. Wise words are like deep water. Wisdom flows from the wise like a bubbling brook. What's coming out? What's coming? What is wisdom? Because you're smarter than everybody else. To me, wisdom is learning from your experience. and being able to apply it and give it to somebody else. Not because I read it in the book. I know more scriptures than you. I No, no. My life shows that I have experienced what God has said. And that's what's coming out. Grace, grace, God's grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. And And if it's the grace of God, shouldn't we be giving the grace to someone else? Because sometimes uh God has been merciful to us. He's brought us up in a way. He's we've had some hard times and he's been merciful. And you know, you didn't deserve that, but he did it for you anyways. &gt;&gt; Okay? And then you should then turn around, there's mercy in my cup. There's grace in my cup. There's love in my cup. You know, so he says then Psalms 30 uh verse 5, for his anger endureth but a moment in his favor is life. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. Sometimes a night is long, sometimes a night is hard. sometimes the fact that you had to pay or bear what you went through but it's a lesson learned and that morning will come you know I worked um 20ome years in working in cabinetry and countertops and uh they were there was a young man that they brought in and they asked me to began to train him and he was like 18 19 years old and so I asked him I said uh um I just want to know what experience he had. And I said, "What experience do you have with in countertop cabinet or anything like that?" And he said, "Well, my grandpa owned a cabinet shop and my dad worked with him all the time." I said, "Well, good. What did you do?" Well, you know, my grandpa used to build this and my dad used to help him and he just kept going down the line. Well, that's not what I want to know. I want to know what you did. So, then I realized what he was afraid I was going to say. Well, you have no experience. I can't use you. And I remembered when I was a kid and just dad used to take us out was part of the LA airport was Ontario International. My dad would take me and my younger brother and we'd sit over one side to buy us an ice cream cone and we'd watch the National Guard jets taking off and uh ice cream cones were 10 cents back then. So it didn't cost dad a whole lot, but it was neat. We would go over to the airport to see that. It was close by. I moved to Tucson. I uh I got my first uh camera and I used to go out and take pictures. I worked at the airport. I even cleaned the owner's lair jet one time and I sat inside and took a picture of it. And I'm telling them all this. I said, "I think I can fly. You want to go flying with me this weekend? I've been all around them. I've cleaned them. I've actually sat inside of them." And finally goes, "I've never done this before." I said, "Thank you. Now I know where to start you. just being honest. What's in your cup? You don't have that training, but that training can come &gt;&gt; if we'll be willing to do that. And then I I unto Timothy, Paul says, Timothy says this in in 1 Timothy 4 4:12, he said, "Let no man despise thy youth or or somebody new in the gospel." Now, I I took the liberty to interpret it that way. Somebody new. Somebody don't have the experience that you have, don't have the time that you have, uh, fallen down and got up as many times as you have and you've learned from the from that. He's telling you, "But be thou an example to the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith and in purity, in conversation." Not how you talk, but how you live. &gt;&gt; That's when the word conversation is used in the Bible. Muslim is talking about how you live, how your actions are, because that speaks louder than words a lot of times. I look like a Christian, but I don't act like a Christian. And I'd rather be acting like a Christian and getting accused of being a Christian that way than dressing like a Christian and saying, "No, he's not a Christian." &gt;&gt; Because it's not really about me. I I really make my father look bad. You're the son of Oh, what does that say about your dad? We got to be careful with that. And again, another way they said, "Let no man make little of you because you are young, but be an example to the church in word and behavior and love and faith and in holy living." When I say young, not necessarily an age, but also a newcomer. If if somebody comes in and and they're made to sit in the back seat and said, "Until you're as good at us, you can't participate." &gt;&gt; No. They don't have a first string, second string, third string. And they do in football, but not in Christianity. You're my brother, you're my sister. We're all part of the family of God. Ephesians 6:4. Now this just just some thoughts because we're talking about about coming into a place of what's in our cup. Okay. He says, "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them." No. Rather bring them up in the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord. And sometimes I find myself acting like my father, getting angry and spanking. And um we all done that I'm sure &gt;&gt; in our anger in our in our and a moment of but I found out if I was angry enough and you my wife's not here but she she was I got angry over something I would if I wasn't dressed to go outside to have my tennis shoes. I took my and I went for a long walk and I burned out all that frustration. Sometimes it wasn't that long. Sometimes it was a long walk. Sometimes it was from here in New Mexico and back. No, not that far. But just went out until I no longer was frustrated because now I could handle the situation in a calm manner. because if I would have handled it and you can ask one of my daughters, I took her by the head one time for a second and realized what I was doing. And I ran out the door crying that I had reacted that way. So after that, I learned just go away for a little while. They're going to be in the room terrorized and dad's coming to to But then they learn, oh, when dad comes back, he's going to talk to us. He's going to make it easier on us. We're not going to die through this situation. &gt;&gt; Because I had to learn that myself. And you know that's why he came on the cross and he lived a life here on earth so he could be touched by the filling of our infirmities so he could understand because as God as he would not know. He's never had sin. He's never had a problem. He's never had a bad thought. He never had a temptation until he came in flesh and he was tempted and tried like you and I. &gt;&gt; But he overcame &gt;&gt; and Christ in you is your overcomer. Amen. Or or or another way to say, "Let no man um I I'm sorry, read that one." Do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord. When I would be instructing my children with a hard attitude, God would say, "Is that the way you want me to treat you? No. Then why are you doing that? Sit down. Walk away for a little while. Calm down a little bit. &gt;&gt; And you know, there'll still be love flowing through there for a little while. There won't be And my wife gets mad when I say it won't cost you as much. You won't have to take her to dinner. You won't have to buy her a new dress. And she says, "You're going to make everybody think that you have to do that to me." And I don't. But you know, sometimes just a little bit of quiet peace. Settle down. get him sometimes getting before the Lord for a little while. Lord, I know I've sinned. I know I've done wrong. I know I've failed. And God says, "That's exactly what I want to hear from you because now I can come in my sweetness, in my presence, and minister to you." When you're angry, when you're frustrated, when you're mad, when you're yelling and screaming, he's sitting on the side. And brother Brandham says the Holy Spirit sometimes will flee off a little bit to the side and wait till you calm down a little bit &gt;&gt; because maybe you know Jesus took a whip and he chased them all out of the temple. I I don't want that to happen to me with him if I have to say Lord I'm sorry let me humble my spirit my attitude. Matthew chapter 25 34 to 40 watch this. Then the king shall say unto them on his right hand, "Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. It's prepared for you." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I prepared this and I don't know what to do with it." No, he had you in mind while he was doing all of this &gt;&gt; and he knows you by name. &gt;&gt; I think I've shared this with you before. I asked the Lord if he knew my name. I walked into the house and I was frustrated over someone. I just went over to the room and I said, "Lord, do you even know where I live and I know my name and I opened the Bible and it falls into Psalms 115 and it says, "Oh house of Aaron, I have blessed you, kept you." It says it three times in a row. Knows my name and where I live. But you know what? I asked him again. And then I asked him again. Then I asked him again. I wish we would learn. But you know what? He never said, "That's enough. Don't ever ask me again. If you do that again, no." He said, "Call on me. I'll talk to you. I'll share with you. &gt;&gt; He's never told me that I can't talk to him about the same thing again. And when you get my age, you repeat the same things a lot more than I ever used to. Dad, we've heard that story. That's the 337th time. One of the girls that keep records, I'm sure you laugh, but it's true. when they can tell you the same story back because you've said it so many times and maybe it's changed the story time. Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand, "Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world prepared for you." He wasn't like, "Oh, I've prepared it because I know you're going to be there. You're going to go through troubles. You're going to have hard times. You're going, "But I know you will be there. I have prepared it for you. It's got your name on it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wonder if we can erase your name. No, you can't. &gt;&gt; You might get a little bit of um help from him. Um the kind that's swiftly applied, the kind that you know gets you going, but he cares. That's why if I didn't care what my children would do, and that's what you're seeing and happening in the world right now. You're old enough. you're on your own. You know, hey, you grew up. Goodbye. No, they're still my children. I'm still his. And he still watches over me. &gt;&gt; He says, "For when I hunger was hungry, you gave me meat. When I was thirsty, you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. And because of this, I've inherited the kingdom of God. The things that we should be doing daily should be part of our life. Should be part of our nature and our character. The same thing he did. Uh Jesus, they're hungry. What do we have? We have two fish and a couple of those. We got more than enough. He's still the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's more than able. Naked and you clothe me. I was sick and you visit me. I was in prison and you came to me and I I could hear them when when were you in the hospital? I don't remember you being sick. I don't ever. And he goes, "Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee, and thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee as a stranger, and took thee in, and naked, and clothe thee? or when saw we thee sick or in a prison and came unto thee? And the king shall answer and say unto them, verily I say unto you, in as much as you have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me. So we are being measured how we treat one another. &gt;&gt; That's one of God's main measuring sticks, &gt;&gt; you know, and and Yeah. And and we know we do fail. We do make mistakes. &gt;&gt; And all God wants to see if you have the same attitude that he did and he said, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing." &gt;&gt; See if we're going to take that same attitude. &gt;&gt; Lord, have mercy on them. Forgive them. &gt;&gt; Rather than Lord, they need to be taken care of. They need to be straightened out. You need to take care of them until I'm happy. We won't say it in words, but that's really what we're saying. &gt;&gt; I want to be made happy by you taking care of them. &gt;&gt; Yes. When your children are little, there are times that they disappoint you. They misbehave. They're children. Now, when they're 16, 18, 20 years old, that's a little bit different. But when they were little kids, the there's six girls. There's 10 years apart them between uh my wife had taken them to the library and um when she came out of the library, they were all kind of following her and some man saw them and he starts going quack quack quack quack quack quack and the girls thought it was hilarious. My wife didn't think so. So she takes them shopping and they purposely line up behind her smallest to the tallest and followed her around the shopping center going quack quack quack quack quack quack. They're still alive. Children are children. They're your children. God gave them to you. But today they all they're not all all at home there. But sometimes we're all sitting around the dinner table and we're I'm a happy dad. They love the Lord Jesus. They respect their parents. All of them have a good testimony. Not because dad did it, because all I did was get them. Lord, let you be their example. They make mistakes. Yes, they make mistakes. Do they have to come back and say, "I'm sorry." Yes, they have to come back. Sometimes, John, did you take care of this? You were supposed to do this on your car. No, Dad. I forgot. I said, "Well, it would have been a $50 problem. Now it's a $500 problem. See, something taken care of quickly, it's usually like this. Something that goes six months and not like this. &gt;&gt; And if we just be willing to say, "Lord, I'm sorry." So again, what's in your cup? What's in your cup? What's in your cup is what you put in it. I know I have the paper here. Remember, such as I have is what Peter said as as we finish up with this. You probably come up to your the instruments now. [Music] Such as I have, the woman at the blood issue, she drew from God. She drew from him. Why? Because she went and touched him. But in him was what she needed. And you know who God on earth is today? He's in me and you. That's he sends you down that way. And somebody reaches out. Hey, what is it about you? There's a peaceful spirit around you. There's something about you. How where do I get that from? Such as I have, I give unto you. What is drawn from me? What is drawn from you? Is there something that somebody would want, somebody would desire? Or is it uh he calls himself a Christian and he acts like that? &gt;&gt; Then I don't want Christianity. &gt;&gt; Okay. Eden was not just a place where you like where you live, you work, you fellowship. It was an atmosphere. It wasn't just a literal place. There was an atmosphere, an environment to where growth can be achieved. Okay? It in other words, there's something there to to draw out of you so someone can receive from it. That's what Eden was for them. It was a place where God let everything grow. There were trees, there were plants, there was everything was there. It wasn't just a mark, a literal place, a place where God was dwelling. It says when a star leaves the atmosphere it was created for, it destroys itself. So what atmosphere do we keep around us? And really we have to watch that. What atmosphere do we keep around us? What house will you build me? He says, "A beautiful home, a temple, a mansion." No, what he wants is you. You're his dwelling place. Sure, he'll come and meet with us in here. But if he's just here when we leave, he doesn't go with us. But if we bring him, we take him. He's with us all the time. &gt;&gt; I think I think brother Israel, if you didn't come, Brother Israel would stand here and say, "Who do I preach to? What do I do?" There's somebody willing to receive. And and it's it's it's something that in God is placing brother Israel to give. It's something God has placed in you to give at school, at work, in the neighborhood, right in the same house that you live in with your family to give one another. The Bible even says the right hand doesn't say the left hand, I'm better than you. I don't need you. It's all part of the body. He says, so so he says if his dwelling place is a church, a temple or in special meetings, then our only time with him is when we are in those places. And we know it's good together with the saints in church. It's good for the meetings. We look forward to them. But it should be an everyday experience. It should be just as welcome in your home, in your car, at your work, wherever you are at. We don't leave him in church. We don't leave him in our prayer go. We We take him everywhere we go. Such as I have, I give unto you. It's Christ in us, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Then his glory should be with in us to be able to give to others such as I have. You don't have to run to the brother to to the pastor. Can I borrow some of your grace? I need some. Can I borrow some of your peace? No. Because when when they did that, he says, "No, go and look for yourself, lest you take ours." &gt;&gt; But the Christ in you is the hope of glory for you and maybe your neighbor and maybe your coworker. What is it that you have that's so so good and so rich? I want it also. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. How many would say that today? Yeah. Feel my cup. I left [Music] this my soul. Bread of heaven. Free me till I come. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here's my cup. I lift it up. I put it before you. Fill it up. &gt;&gt; Fill it up and make me whole. Make me complete. Make me everything you want me to be. And that's what would come out of you. No matter where you're at. No matter where you're at. We should not be embarrassed to be a Christian wherever we're at. A Christian doesn't mean you have to stand there and preach to everybody. It doesn't mean that you have to tell them how wrong they are and how right you are. In fact, it shouldn't mean that at all. That should be a life lived that speaks louder than any words. That you'd be willing to go help somebody that's hurting like the wounded man and they were coming out and the priest went this way and the other one that way.
