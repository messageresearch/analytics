[7:29] [music]
[7:58] Amen. Good morning, saints.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; How many is happy to be here today?
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Everyone looks so nice. look like
[8:09] you come expecting [music]
[8:11] to hear from the word of the Lord. Amen.
[8:14] Normally our Sunday morning [music]
[8:16] service, we have an adult Sunday school.
[8:19] Um, and that's about 15 minutes and we
[8:21] usually play a series of the prophet.
[8:24] [music] And this morning with the
[8:26] special meetings, we've just going to
[8:28] move that Sunday school to right [music]
[8:30] now. And there's a few quotations that I
[8:32] wanted to play for you um
[8:37] in line up with our theme, the sons and
[8:41] daughters of God. Amen. So, I trust
[8:44] it'll be a blessing to you. It's on my t
[8:46] on my phone here. It's kind of old
[8:47] school the way I'm going to do this. And
[8:49] so, you won't be able to look at the
[8:51] screen,
[8:53] but
[8:54] but you can hear the voice. All right.
[8:58] How many love the Lord?
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing a portion of only
[9:02] believe as we [music]
[9:05] Oh,
[9:07] believe
[9:10] on
[9:12] [singing]
[9:16] [music] that all things are possible
[9:22] only. [singing]
[9:28] Only
[9:30] believe.
[9:34] Only
[9:36] believe.
[9:39] All things are possible.
[9:45] All
[9:48] [music] living.
[9:50] God bless you.
[9:58] What a miserable thing that poor bird
[10:01] is. For he was built, made to be a
[10:06] heaven flying bird.
[10:09] And you're trapped for the rest of his
[10:12] life
[10:14] in a little cave.
[10:17] and to know that he could look
[10:20] and see the things that and the places
[10:23] where he longed [screaming] to be
[10:26] but he could not get out of this cave.
[10:30] I thought what a miserable [screaming]
[10:32] thirsty
[10:33] or bird he must be. I thought that's
[10:37] about one of the most saddest sightes I
[10:39] ever seen.
[10:41] But then as turning [screaming] around
[10:44] I see the sadder side
[10:48] that is the [screaming] sons of Adam
[10:53] who were made to be the sons of God
[10:55] [screaming]
[10:57] beating their brains out [groaning]
[11:00] trying to find treasures
[11:03] to satisfy in this life and knowing that
[11:06] they were born to be sons of the living
[11:12] And they just simply beat themselves to
[11:15] death. Running here and running there
[11:18] and shooting each other and gambling and
[11:21] stealing and robbing from one another
[11:24] when they're really born to these sons
[11:26] of God.
[11:28] That's the saddest part I ever seen is
[11:31] man imprisoned [screaming] by sin.
[11:36] But there's one thing about it.
[11:39] There could be such a thing as some kind
[11:42] of hearted person. [screaming]
[11:43] Let that eagle out of it.
[11:47] And I'm so happy to say to the sons of
[11:50] Adam this afternoon that there has been
[11:53] a kind-hearted person coming to the sons
[11:55] of Adam,
[11:57] the Lord Jesus,
[11:59] who will let everyone go free that wants
[12:02] to go.
[12:04] It's up to you. Christian people who
[12:06] read the Bible when that child become a
[12:09] certain age and if he was a if he was a
[12:12] bad boy now he never could be denied
[12:15] being a son no also because he was born
[12:19] I'm just a little enough Calvinist to
[12:20] believe that that when a man is born a
[12:23] son of God he's the son of God that's
[12:25] right and God putting savior here
[12:28] knowing he's going to lose you now you
[12:29] might be worked up and think you're
[12:30] saved here that might be true but let me
[12:33] tell you something when you're really
[12:35] saved God don't save you here and know
[12:36] he's going to lose you there. If he did,
[12:38] he's not the infant God. He's defeating
[12:39] his own purpose. You can't do that. If
[12:42] you're saved, you're saved. If you're
[12:44] not, you're not. IF YOU'RE SAVED, YOU
[12:47] LIVE LIKE YOU'RE SAVED.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; I don't act quit drinking, quit smoking,
[12:51] quit gambling because I know it's wrong.
[12:53] There's something in me. God loves me so
[12:55] much and I love God, so I wouldn't do it
[12:56] anyhow.
[12:58] Not a law, but a love.
[13:02] It isn't law that SAVES US. IT'S LOVE
[13:04] THAT SAVES US. God so loved the world.
[13:08] It isn't evidence. It's the signs that
[13:10] saved us. It's love that saved us.
[13:14] Certainly.
[13:15] Now notice this father. He was so happy
[13:19] of his son. Then when that son became of
[13:21] age, that father took him out into the
[13:24] street into a public place. And notice
[13:27] the father put a royal robe on him.
[13:31] And he set that son up before the public
[13:34] and he had a ceremony and he adopted
[13:38] that same son that was born in his house
[13:42] into his family.
[13:44] Did you know that? Read the old test.
[13:47] Take Ephesians first chapter 5th verse
[13:49] and run your reference on that simply.
[13:50] Don't go back to your adoption and
[13:52] placing a son. God is predestinated to
[13:54] be the sons of God by Jesus Christ.
[13:57] predestinated us unto the adoption
[14:02] predestinated our fornowledge by
[14:05] adopting us into the sons of God. Now
[14:09] when it become a son when he was adopted
[14:12] into the same family he was born in. Now
[14:14] listen Presbyterian friend Methodist and
[14:17] Baptist and Pentecostal when you're born
[14:19] again that only puts you in the family.
[14:23] It's your character, your conduct that
[14:25] gives God confidence in you. The reason
[14:28] that we haven't got the great church
[14:29] marching on today is because God can't
[14:33] find people THAT PUT HIS CONFIDENCE IN.
[14:35] The Holy Spirit keeps saying they're
[14:37] tearing UP. THEY'RE BREAKING UP. THEY'RE
[14:39] DOING THIS. They're all on the lines.
[14:41] Stay with God's word.
[14:44] That's God's truth. That's the pattern.
[14:46] That's the blueprint. That's the reason
[14:48] the church today's got all kinds of isms
[14:49] and everything in it is because they
[14:51] DON'T STAY WITH THE WORD. THEY WON'T
[14:53] LISTEN TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. The Holy
[14:56] Spirit won't testify of one other thing
[14:58] but God's word. It's exactly right.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Creation, the creation is waiting for
[15:04] the manifestations of the sons of God.
[15:08] What's everything waiting on?
[15:11] &gt;&gt; What's the whole creation waiting for?
[15:14] the manifestations of the sons of God.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; It's waiting for the church to become
[15:19] into its position.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Who was the son of God when Adam where
[15:24] was his domain? The earth.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; He he had domain over earth. Is that
[15:30] right?
[15:31] &gt;&gt; He wasn't ly Elohim man. He was Jehovah.
[15:35] See that is I am God and I've made some
[15:38] lesser ones under me and I'll give them
[15:41] a dominion
[15:42] &gt;&gt; and in their domain the dominion under
[15:45] them is the earth. Man had dominion over
[15:47] the earth and all the whole creation is
[15:50] waiting for the sons of God to be
[15:52] manifested.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; We're watching for the coming of that
[16:01] glad millennium day
[16:03] &gt;&gt; when our blessed Lord Come and catch his
[16:06] waiting right away. Oh, the earth is
[16:10] groaning, crying for that day of sweet
[16:12] release when our savior shall come back
[16:16] to earth again.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Waiting God trying to place his church
[16:21] in position to manifest himself. Getting
[16:24] one that he can work through like this.
[16:25] Say, "There's my spirit flowing freely.
[16:27] There it is. I I can work here. Get
[16:30] another one over here and place him. I
[16:31] can place him." Adoption. place him,
[16:34] manifest him, take him out of here and
[16:36] put a ceremony on him, visit him with an
[16:38] angel, tell him something. If he's told
[16:40] the truth, now if he's just making up
[16:42] something, it won't work.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; No, no, that won't work. We've had a lot
[16:46] of that. But I mean, but I mean,
[16:48] manifestations of sons of God, when God
[16:51] manifests himself and he sends him out
[16:53] and then he goes forth and what he says
[16:55] is truth.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; What he does is the truth. What he does,
[16:58] he manifests Christ.
[17:03] He said he made known to us the mystery.
[17:08] Get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and
[17:10] start running that and just watch how it
[17:12] goes. This afternoon I had oh about 30
[17:16] minutes to study just to look the lesson
[17:19] over. Maybe not I I'll say half of that
[17:21] 15 minutes between the times.
[17:26] And I got to running and I thought the
[17:29] mystery, how mysterious.
[17:33] And the scripture packed me back into
[17:35] the Old Testament. Then back over into
[17:39] the New Testament, tied something
[17:41] together. See the mystery of his coming,
[17:44] the mystery of his will, the mystery of
[17:47] the setting together. Remember, it
[17:50] cannot be taught in any seminary.
[17:55] It's a mystery.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; You cannot know it by education, by
[18:00] theology. It's a mystery that's been
[18:03] hidden since the foundation of the
[18:05] world.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the manifestations
[18:10] of the sons of God. Tell me, my brother,
[18:15] tell me, my sister, when was the time
[18:18] that the sons of God was ever to be
[18:20] manifested outside of this time? Now
[18:24] &gt;&gt; when was there ever a time in the
[18:27] history there's a manifest a time to
[18:30] deliver all nature
[18:32] nature the nature itself is groaning
[18:35] waiting for the time of the
[18:36] manifestation
[18:38] why before the atonement was made before
[18:41] the holy ghost was ever poured out
[18:43] before all the all the old testament on
[18:45] down there there couldn't have been
[18:47] manifestations
[18:49] &gt;&gt; it had to wait till this time
[18:51] &gt;&gt; now All things has been brought coming
[18:55] shaping up to a headstone
[18:58] to the manifestations of sons of God
[19:02] coming back and the spirit of God coming
[19:05] into these men so perfectly until their
[19:10] ministry will be so close like Christ
[19:13] will join him and his church together.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; TO BE WHAT? WHAT INHERITANCE? The
[19:19] sunship.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. TO BE A SON OF GOD.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; And now this may just choke you to
[19:27] death,
[19:29] &gt;&gt; but did you know that men that are sons
[19:31] of God are amateur gods?
[19:35] &gt;&gt; How many ever know that?
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; How many knows that Jesus said so?
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible Jesus said, "Did not your law
[19:44] say itself that you are gods?
[19:47] And if you call them gods, which God
[19:50] said in Genesis 2, that they were gods
[19:54] because they were aired full domain over
[19:57] the dominion of the world. He gave him
[20:00] dominion over all things and he lost his
[20:03] godship.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; He lost his sunship. He lost his domain.
[20:08] And Satan took it over. Amen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; THE
[20:14] &gt;&gt; WE'RE waiting for the manifestations
[20:20] &gt;&gt; of the sons OF GOD TO COME BACK AND take
[20:23] over again.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the fullness of time WHEN
[20:30] THE PY GETS UP to the top when the full
[20:33] sons of God will be manifested.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; When the power of God will walk out.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:40] I will take over POWER THAT SATAN'S GOT
[20:42] AWAY FROM ME.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Belongs to me
[20:48] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; And as we overcome by the Holy Spirit
[20:53] like he had, we will set with him as he
[20:55] takes the earthly throne of David to sit
[20:58] and rule with him just like he did up
[21:00] there. Amen. Power and authority over
[21:03] all the earth. The earth is groaning,
[21:06] waiting for the manifestations of the
[21:08] sons of God to be manifested, God's son.
[21:11] Because as earth, this world was not
[21:14] given for God to control.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; WHO IS THE GOD OF THE EARTH? MAN.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; That's his domain. All everything in the
[21:25] earth is subject to the man. Through
[21:27] sin, he fell. Through Christ redeeming
[21:29] power, he comes back again.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the earth belongs
[21:34] to man. It was given to him and he was
[21:36] ruler over everything.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; And all nature's groaning, waiting for
[21:41] that time that when the sons of God will
[21:44] be manifested again,
[21:47] &gt;&gt; manifestations for the sons of God.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to leave that right
[21:51] now. But
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] And everyone can say
[21:56] amen. Uh God bless you. Amen. [applause]
[22:04] Amen. God bless you this morning. Let's
[22:06] all stand.

[39:03] my sins are washed [singing]

[39:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; No one knew how alone
[39:13] [singing and music]
[39:14] I was feeling.
[39:17] for the emptiness [singing]
[39:19] I tried so hard [music] to hide.
[39:24] Though [singing] I laughed and said
[39:26] [music] my life was fine without you.
[39:31] I was covering up the secret tears I
[39:35] [singing and music]
[39:36] cried.
[39:38] Then one day someone told me of
[39:42] [singing] your mercy.
[39:46] and the love you showed on [singing] a
[39:48] hill called Calary. [music]
[39:52] There you
[39:55] purchase [singing]
[39:56] my redemption [music]
[40:00] when you broke sin's power and [singing]

[40:37] [singing and music]
[40:38] are washed away.
[40:43] Yes, it's true. [singing]
[40:45] There have been days [music]
[40:46] when I failed you.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, you know the [singing] many times
[40:53] [music]
[40:53] I've gone astray.
[40:57] [singing]
[40:57] &gt;&gt; But I've learned your love is stronger
[41:00] [music] than my weakness.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; And your ear [singing] is open [music]
[41:07] every time I pray.
[41:11] No one else ever cared [singing] for me
[41:16] like you, Lord.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Other [singing] friends could never be
[41:22] so close to me.
[41:26] I'm [music] not afraid to face the
[41:29] problems [singing] of tomorrow.
[41:33] Knowing [music] you are everything I'll
[41:37] ever need.
[41:40] I'm amazed. [singing]

[41:58] &gt;&gt; I found [singing] pardon
[42:02] and my sins. [music]
[42:06] &gt;&gt; They're [singing] all washed away.

[42:15] [singing and music]
[42:17] I'm amazed.
[42:20] Oh, how you love [singing] me.
[42:23] Lord, I'm amazed
[42:27] how [music and singing] you care.
[42:31] Preious
[42:33] blood I found pardon [singing and music]
[42:38] and my sins are washed. [music] They're
[42:42] all washed away. All [singing] my sins
[42:47] are washed away. If your sins are gone,
[42:51] proclaim that my [singing and music]
[42:53] sins are washed. They're all washed
[42:58] away. [music]

[43:06] Praise his name, Lord Jesus. If the
[43:08] brothers will come this morning.
[43:09] [applause]
[43:16] &gt;&gt; And after this, we'll have the adult
[43:18] choir if you want to go ahead and start
[43:19] making ready as well.
[43:26] Good morning. It's sure good to be in
[43:28] church with each one of you this
[43:30] morning. Are you hungry? Are you ready
[43:32] to be fed?
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to be feasting during
[43:35] this service and then after and then
[43:38] [music] a little later another service
[43:39] and some more food. So, we just hope
[43:41] that you came ready and willing to eat.
[43:44] And brother Brandham taught us now if
[43:45] you see a or hit a seed, just keep
[43:48] feasting. You don't necessarily have to
[43:50] eat that seed, but you maybe swallow it
[43:52] or make sure it's a seed. All right. God
[43:54] bless you. Sure been good to be in
[43:56] service with you. Dear saints, a request
[43:58] from Sister Tila, as I continue to
[44:00] undergo treatment on my back injury. The
[44:02] pain is unbearable. I'm unable to stand
[44:04] sit up for a long time has caused me to
[44:06] be missing church services. And we miss
[44:08] our sister Tila. So let's hold her up in
[44:10] prayer. The Lord will deliver her in his
[44:13] good time. From brother Jonathan
[44:15] Gonzalez [music] here. God bless you,
[44:17] brother and sisters. I would like to
[44:19] pray for brother Lazy, our elder in the
[44:21] back corner. We love him very much. May
[44:23] God touch his body. And we certainly
[44:25] want to remember our pastor. Thank you
[44:26] for the reminders, brother Jonathan, the
[44:29] pastor, their family, and each of the
[44:31] ministers are traveling, all that's done
[44:32] for the glory of the living God this
[44:34] morning. Amen. And as God's children, he
[44:36] wants to do more than we probably
[44:38] [music] know or want or desire. So just
[44:40] hold that need before him and faith
[44:41] believing. Won't you lift up a hand for
[44:43] that loved one, for that financial,
[44:44] spiritual, physical, whatever it is.
[44:47] Dear God, we're so thankful to be in
[44:48] church again this morning. We just lift
[44:50] up a sacrifice of praise. We appreciate
[44:52] the leadership, Lord, Brother Israel.
[44:54] Just desiring more souls to be one and
[44:57] the leadership, Lord, the board, and the
[44:59] song leaders, Brother John,
[45:02] Brother Craig, Brother Scott, Lord,
[45:04] anoint them, and the ministry, Lord. We
[45:06] we know there'll be a man up here, but
[45:09] we know you'll be speaking to us, Lord.
[45:11] And so, want to be receptive, Father,
[45:13] and just humble hearts to hear what
[45:16] you'd have in store for us this morning.
[45:18] We love brother McGary, Lord, and his
[45:20] family, Sister Leslie here, and we just
[45:23] tried to stuff everybody [music] in
[45:24] every corner that we possibly could do.
[45:26] And so, just help us. May we be
[45:29] comfortable, Lord, as we hear the word
[45:30] and just hear from heaven. We bring a
[45:34] just a meager tithes and offerings,
[45:35] Lord, knowing that you'll magnify it and
[45:38] bring that last soul in because we know
[45:40] your coming is real soon, real soon. And
[45:42] we want to be ready. Dear God, we commit
[45:44] all things to your mighty hands in the
[45:46] name of the wonderful Lord and Savior,
[45:47] the Lord Jesus Christ. [music] And all
[45:49] the church says,
[45:53] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And also, just a quick update, I
[45:57] got a text from [music] my stepmother
[46:00] this morning, the little baby Grady.
[46:02] They're moving him out of the ICU down
[46:04] to a regular floor. So, she just wanted
[46:06] to thank the Lord for all the prayers
[46:07] that have been going up for him. So, we
[46:09] just say, "Thank you, Lord." Oh, amen.
[46:12] We'll sing that. I need
[46:16] thee every [singing]
[46:18] hour

[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; God bless each of you today. We're so

[1:09:15] as well. and we wanted to thank you for
[1:09:19] the sacrifices and the efforts you made
[1:09:21] to be here with us. Amen.
[1:09:24] And so um
[1:09:26] we have come to this portion of the
[1:09:29] service of the just before we go to the
[1:09:32] preaching of the word, we wanted to
[1:09:33] share just uh testimony on how we got
[1:09:38] the building and maybe show a slideshow
[1:09:42] uh from the beginnings to where we are
[1:09:44] at this moment. 2025,
[1:09:47] we really counter the privilege that the
[1:09:50] Lord Jesus has given us the opportunity
[1:09:52] to serve him in the little way that we
[1:09:56] can. Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I get a smile from everybody?
[1:10:00] Let me see your
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Let me see your teeth.
[1:10:04] God bless you, richly. God bless you
[1:10:06] richly. I was so uh overjoyed. I saw in
[1:10:10] the back there our good friend from uh
[1:10:14] Bogota, Colombia. Brother Fabio Bernal
[1:10:16] is here with his dear wife. I want them
[1:10:19] to stand up. They came. It surprised me.
[1:10:23] Yes. God bless you. [applause] Y
[1:10:26] Mandiga. Amen. He had his 50y year
[1:10:30] anniversary just earlier this year and
[1:10:32] it was our first time to go Sharon and I
[1:10:35] to Colombia. You didn't know he was
[1:10:36] coming? Yeah, I didn't either. and I was
[1:10:39] so surprised to see him. What an honor
[1:10:41] to have him here with us. Amen. And uh
[1:10:44] so um just a little history back in
[1:10:48] 2016,
[1:10:50] June of 2016, I was on my way to church.
[1:10:54] Um, I lived in Savarita at the time and
[1:10:58] the Lord had it spoke to my heart that
[1:11:00] um that that would be my the last
[1:11:03] service that I would have uh where I was
[1:11:05] fellowshipping at the assembly there
[1:11:08] with uh with brother Doug Mccuse.
[1:11:13] He was my pastor for 14 plus years.
[1:11:17] And he did a fine job standing for the
[1:11:20] word of God. And it was an honor and a
[1:11:23] privilege to to work with him to sit
[1:11:26] under his ministry here. And the Lord
[1:11:29] spoke to my heart there um on my way to
[1:11:32] church. And so I um didn't know exactly
[1:11:36] what we would do. So we went to the
[1:11:39] Hotel Tucant. It was you formerly the
[1:11:42] Ramada Inn and we um had rented out a
[1:11:47] little room there and a few saints
[1:11:50] joined us in that um meeting spot. Um
[1:11:55] they rented us the room Sunday morning,
[1:11:57] Sunday afternoon and we rented on on
[1:11:59] Wednesday. And so uh we did that from
[1:12:02] June until November, October or
[1:12:06] November. And the Lord blessed us to go
[1:12:08] into a little it was a formerly a bank
[1:12:11] and then it turned into a church that
[1:12:13] they had us to come in. And that's th
[1:12:15] those are the beginning of the slideshow
[1:12:17] that you'll see of when we were in this
[1:12:20] bank. It had a safe in it and it was how
[1:12:23] many's been to the old church. He had
[1:12:26] that big old safe. It it looked nice
[1:12:27] with a curtain and everybody would ask
[1:12:29] what's behind that curtain.
[1:12:31] It was a big vault. We couldn't do
[1:12:34] anything with the doors were this thick.
[1:12:37] Couldn't do anything with it. And so we
[1:12:39] would use that for storage and marriage
[1:12:42] counseling.
[1:12:43] No, no,
[1:12:46] no. But it was big thick building, big
[1:12:50] storage building there. And so we um you
[1:12:54] know while we were there we you know we
[1:12:56] had the cars broken into a couple times
[1:13:00] and um we had our air conditioning
[1:13:02] stolen
[1:13:03] um once but the Lord upgraded that and
[1:13:06] gave us a better system. So, you kind of
[1:13:09] get mad at the thief, but then you say,
[1:13:11] "Well, thank the Lord for the thief
[1:13:12] because the school we were renting from
[1:13:15] the TUSD, they allowed us to purchase an
[1:13:19] AC units that we actually needed and
[1:13:22] they didn't charge us for it."
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And so, I did not complain. I
[1:13:28] purposefully did not complain
[1:13:30] uh while we were on Broadway
[1:13:35] uh because I know it was a blessing for
[1:13:36] us to be there and uh I didn't know how
[1:13:39] much of a blessing it was until it was
[1:13:42] time for us to move after 8 years of
[1:13:46] being there. 8 and 1/2 years
[1:13:50] at that location. Yeah, it'll be 10 now.
[1:13:53] Eight and a half, nine years. our lease
[1:13:55] had we were warned that our lease that
[1:13:58] they were going to sell that building
[1:14:00] and demolish it and we had um 6 months
[1:14:04] um that we needed to to vacate. They
[1:14:06] would just renew it every year. They
[1:14:08] raised our rent one time. That was the
[1:14:11] first year. After that, they never
[1:14:13] bothered us. Our our rent was very very
[1:14:16] low. And um so we continued to do that
[1:14:21] and until we were on this deadline of
[1:14:24] time crunch. So
[1:14:26] the year had ticked away and then we got
[1:14:29] to the six month mark where we had to
[1:14:31] find another building and uh no one
[1:14:34] knows the stress that's associated with
[1:14:37] that. trying to find a location that
[1:14:41] everybody will be happy, that'll be
[1:14:43] safe, that's affordable, that's that's
[1:14:46] in an appropriate place. And so I
[1:14:49] really, it bothered me. It stressed me
[1:14:51] out quite a bit. I was praying about it
[1:14:54] uh quite a bit. And we had uh November
[1:14:57] services every year. We would have those
[1:15:00] special meetings. And so
[1:15:02] last year or 2024 or March, brother
[1:15:07] Robert Figueroa had invited me to come
[1:15:11] with him to some meetings down in Warz.
[1:15:13] Brother Tito
[1:15:15] um I forget his last name. Perez no T
[1:15:19] Perez. Tito Perez. Yes. invited us uh to
[1:15:23] be a part of his meetings and I've
[1:15:25] gotten invitations many times you know
[1:15:28] in Ngalas in different parts of Mexico
[1:15:30] and so forth and I used to go and I just
[1:15:33] kind of had stopped going for whatever
[1:15:34] reason and this invitation came through
[1:15:38] Robert Figureroa and he kept asking me
[1:15:40] and I didn't get back to him then
[1:15:42] finally he told me brother Israel if you
[1:15:44] don't go I'm not going because I'm not
[1:15:47] going to drive down by myself so I said
[1:15:50] okay I'll
[1:15:51] And so me and brother Robert um we got
[1:15:54] together. We drove down to Wararez, 5
[1:15:57] hours down Friday afternoon, we got in a
[1:16:01] bit late. We crossed the border into
[1:16:04] Mexico Friday night. Get into the
[1:16:08] service and brother um Guadalupe Lopez
[1:16:11] is preaching. No interpreter. I'm
[1:16:15] sitting there in Mexico. I can't speak a
[1:16:18] lick of Spanish, just a little bit. I
[1:16:21] can understand, but I just can
[1:16:22] understand. So, I prayed in my heart. I
[1:16:24] says, "Lord, open my understanding so I
[1:16:27] can understand what they're preaching."
[1:16:29] And I wanted this great miracle to
[1:16:31] happen. And then two minutes later, a
[1:16:33] brother tapped me on the shoulder says,
[1:16:35] "Do you need an interpreter?"
[1:16:39] And so, [laughter]
[1:16:41] so I said, "Yes, I do." And he began to
[1:16:44] interpret for me. And I was sitting in
[1:16:46] that meeting just looking at the people
[1:16:48] worship and the Lord uh began to deal
[1:16:51] with my mind and my heart about
[1:16:53] missionary work and how I needed to be
[1:16:56] giving more in the missionary work more
[1:16:59] actively starting with my brothers right
[1:17:02] there in Mexico, our neighbors.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, Lord, we're the ones
[1:17:07] that need a building and you want me to
[1:17:10] give more?" Um, and so [snorts]
[1:17:14] before that trip, we had went on the
[1:17:17] market. We're looking, Brother John
[1:17:19] Yarl. Where's Brother John at? Stand up,
[1:17:21] brother John. He's a realtor. And we
[1:17:25] went through uh looking through the
[1:17:26] market, looking at properties and so
[1:17:28] forth. And I think it's sister uh um
[1:17:32] Smith, Sister Carlina, saw this
[1:17:35] property. and her and my wife and
[1:17:38] different ones are always looking and
[1:17:40] they shot this out to us. And then so me
[1:17:42] and brother um brother John came and saw
[1:17:46] this building during the week and to be
[1:17:49] honest I wasn't really really thrilled
[1:17:51] when I first saw the property and
[1:17:53] everything and um but it it was you know
[1:17:57] we didn't have we had to leave and so we
[1:18:00] looked and it was on the pro it was on
[1:18:02] the market for $900,000.
[1:18:06] this, the house, the whole property,
[1:18:08] acre plus. And so we looked at that and
[1:18:12] and John and I went to church on
[1:18:16] Wednesday
[1:18:17] and then notified had a a business
[1:18:20] meeting with the some of the saints
[1:18:21] after the service and was thinking of
[1:18:25] crafting an offer for $800,000
[1:18:30] and just to tie the building up, ask for
[1:18:32] more time and so forth. So we discussed
[1:18:34] that and so that was the Wednesday. Then
[1:18:38] the Thursday
[1:18:40] passed the church came to see it and
[1:18:42] then Friday is when I went to Warz.
[1:18:45] That's when the Lord spoke to my heart
[1:18:47] that uh we need to be giving more. I
[1:18:50] said yes Lord that's what we'll do. We
[1:18:53] come back across the border on our way
[1:18:56] to Tucson and I get an email from the
[1:19:00] school telling us that we had an
[1:19:04] additional six months. So the Lord gave
[1:19:07] us a little bit more time.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; So I said, "Thank you, Lord. We have a
[1:19:11] little more time. The pressure is off a
[1:19:14] little bit." And so we came back and
[1:19:17] while looking we realized the rents that
[1:19:20] we was paying was probably a third of
[1:19:23] what most any other property people were
[1:19:26] paying. And that's when I realized how
[1:19:29] much of a blessing it was where we were.
[1:19:32] So we had another year. We had six,
[1:19:33] seven months or or so to to to get uh a
[1:19:37] little bit more time. And so our
[1:19:40] meetings come up in November. So that
[1:19:42] was in March. We made our commitment to
[1:19:45] give more in the missionary field and
[1:19:47] works and so forth like that, mission
[1:19:49] works. And um
[1:19:53] our meetings come up in November and we
[1:19:55] had the the theme was divine love and um
[1:20:00] before the meetings um we started
[1:20:03] looking again because we had taken this
[1:20:06] property off of our mind because we had
[1:20:09] more time and we'll look for something
[1:20:10] better or look for something affordable.
[1:20:13] And so what we did was um we kept
[1:20:16] looking and then at the beginning of our
[1:20:19] meetings we looked and on the market
[1:20:21] this property was still there.
[1:20:25] So brother John approached them again
[1:20:27] and saw what they were asking and what
[1:20:30] was going on. Well this time they came
[1:20:31] to us and said that we will carry you
[1:20:35] for $750,000.
[1:20:38] We'll carry you. You don't have to go to
[1:20:40] the bank have to get a loan and all
[1:20:41] that. So I said, 'W whoa, that's great.
[1:20:44] We'll take that, Brother Bill. We'll
[1:20:46] take that. So let's talk about it after
[1:20:48] our meeting's over. We go through our
[1:20:50] meetings. Uh Veterans Day weekend, I was
[1:20:54] out um having breakfast with brother
[1:20:57] brother John um Jesse Lynn's brother's
[1:21:01] last name's not coming to me. John
[1:21:03] Davis, Jonathan Davis. And um they con
[1:21:09] the owners of this property contacted
[1:21:11] brother John again after our meetings
[1:21:14] came to us and said you know the owners
[1:21:17] want to offer this to you all and maybe
[1:21:19] one other group and this is not going to
[1:21:22] be on the market but we will sell you
[1:21:25] this building and property for $450,000.
[1:21:30] Wow.
[1:21:32] [applause]
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:39] [applause]
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; So, the Lord cut that building price in
[1:21:42] half.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Gave us a year to save up a little bit
[1:21:46] more.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And then just Well, then you asked me if
[1:21:50] I like it now. [laughter] I said, "Yes,
[1:21:53] I think I like the property. Yes, I love
[1:21:56] it.
[1:22:00] you know, the Lord can cut whatever
[1:22:02] expense, whatever it is, he can cut it
[1:22:04] in half. He'll do it for you. So, it's
[1:22:07] just a tremendous miracle that we're
[1:22:09] here uh in this place, in this little
[1:22:12] location. We had a lot of renovations
[1:22:14] and stuff we had to do to get to this
[1:22:17] point. I want to thank the trustees
[1:22:21] um and the different teams that came
[1:22:24] together for the designing and the
[1:22:26] cleaning and the all of the stuff that
[1:22:29] we had to do. Uh we we had brother V he
[1:22:33] was uh uh coming through brother Kim
[1:22:36] Dingwall which was a friend of brother
[1:22:38] Randy Snow and they kind of got together
[1:22:41] and they just um the Lord really used
[1:22:44] them to help us in this uh in our
[1:22:48] building endeavors. Brother Ike La
[1:22:51] Fontaine came with the music helped us
[1:22:53] out the the local brothers here. I can't
[1:22:57] express enough all of the members and
[1:23:00] the families and even outside brothers
[1:23:03] from other assemblies would just show up
[1:23:05] looking to work and help us out here.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; A pastor that I didn't know very
[1:23:11] closely, a elder in the city of Phoenix
[1:23:15] called us just out of the blue and
[1:23:17] wanted to have lunch with me and my
[1:23:18] wife. And we did and the Lord placed it
[1:23:22] on his heart to give us a substantial
[1:23:25] offering just to give it to us just like
[1:23:28] that.
[1:23:29] Yes, [applause]
[1:23:33] that was [applause]
[1:23:35] that was brother Ron Peterson
[1:23:38] and his assembly there in Phoenix. And
[1:23:41] then we had anonymous donors that come
[1:23:43] through. Um, brother um,
[1:23:48] uh, Chris Dooall, he wanted to supply
[1:23:51] all the paint for the work. Joel Jensen,
[1:23:56] brother Yarborough, and all of the
[1:23:57] saints. Brother Caleb Duran, one of the
[1:23:59] sister pastors here. Uh, brother
[1:24:02] Carpenters family, the Carpenters from
[1:24:05] Mesa, big tremendous help to us. Brother
[1:24:08] Miguel Para, Chuck King, and um of
[1:24:13] course um the um the Smiths, Chris
[1:24:17] Smith, and the families, all the
[1:24:18] trustees and deacons, Brother Joel
[1:24:21] Robson and his dear wife, Sister Aaron.
[1:24:23] Just a tremendous tremendous
[1:24:26] uh Yes. [applause]
[1:24:34] And all of the families pulled together.
[1:24:37] I know I I'm not mentioning all of the
[1:24:39] names. I can't I could but we won't. But
[1:24:44] it's just been a real real blessing. And
[1:24:48] um you know it's not wasn't easy. Still
[1:24:52] not easy. And what you see today, many
[1:24:55] of the saints didn't even see the
[1:24:57] finished product up even last week. That
[1:25:00] house didn't even look like that. What
[1:25:02] they did over there, I was shocked and
[1:25:05] amazed. And so we're just we're
[1:25:07] thankful. We really are grateful. Amen.
[1:25:11] [applause]
[1:25:17] So we certainly appreciate our board um
[1:25:20] over the years.
[1:25:22] The two main deacons that have really
[1:25:24] been real uh pillars to me to help me as
[1:25:29] all of the brothers is brother Joe
[1:25:31] Robson and brother Art Salceo.
[1:25:34] and they're they've been uh standing
[1:25:36] with me very very uh faithfully.
[1:25:39] Amen. [applause]
[1:25:46] Um there's a small group that we started
[1:25:49] to go to minister to in Mesa which is
[1:25:52] connected to brother Carpenters's family
[1:25:56] but really is brother Art and his
[1:25:58] family. Brother Art, Sister Annabel, and
[1:26:01] his two daughters um drove down from
[1:26:05] Phoenix just about every service for
[1:26:08] five and a half years, including the
[1:26:10] week day, just solid solid believers.
[1:26:13] And then some things changed with their
[1:26:16] um jobs and so forth. And so we um they
[1:26:22] they wasn't able to travel and they
[1:26:23] would stream. And so the carpenters
[1:26:26] opened up their sanctuary just on
[1:26:28] Thursday. So it's just a little
[1:26:30] fellowship that we have um started to go
[1:26:34] to there to minister to them. Some of
[1:26:37] brother Art's family are through this
[1:26:40] tragedy and so forth are wanting Bible
[1:26:43] study. We had a Bible study with them
[1:26:45] and we love to see the Lord prosper that
[1:26:47] and let that grow as well.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um, I'd like to go right
[1:26:53] into the slideshow. I didn't see it all.
[1:26:55] I saw part of it, but if if you'll be
[1:26:58] patient with us, and this is kind of
[1:27:02] from our beginnings to 2025. Let's give
[1:27:06] the Lord a hand of praise. Thank you.

[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; With his word. And so let's stand to our
[1:39:27] feet as we invite him to [music] the

[1:39:33] Amazing

[1:39:39] how sweet
[1:39:42] the sound
[1:39:45] as
[1:39:48] rich

[1:39:53] [music]
[1:39:56] I

[1:40:02] but [music]
[1:40:03] now

[1:40:20] was grace [music]
[1:40:22] that [singing]
[1:40:25] my all
[1:40:28] to fear [music]
[1:40:31] and grace
[1:40:34] my [singing] fears.
[1:40:37] [music]
[1:40:43] How precious [music and singing]
[1:40:47] did
[1:40:49] that grace grace [music]
[1:40:52] appear.
[1:40:55] May the hour
[1:41:00] [music and singing] be when we've been
[1:41:02] there 10,000 years. Oh, when we
[1:41:07] [singing]
[1:41:09] been there
[1:41:12] 10,000 [singing and music]
[1:41:16] years,

[1:41:28] Hallelujah. [singing]

[1:42:35] [music]
[1:42:40] Let's just bow our heads.
[1:42:42] Our gracious
[1:42:44] father.
[1:42:47] Lord,
[1:42:50] as I [music] watch the
[1:42:54] slideshow, Father, my heart just
[1:42:58] leapt for joy and
[1:43:03] to see all that you've done.
[1:43:08] And Lord, how [music] precious these
[1:43:10] times are
[1:43:14] and how fleeting that time is.
[1:43:19] And Lord, we're approaching your soon
[1:43:21] coming.
[1:43:24] [music]
[1:43:25] And Lord, our whole heart's desire is
[1:43:28] that we be ready to meet the [music]
[1:43:30] challenge of that hour.
[1:43:33] We ask you to bless us this morning,
[1:43:35] Father, in the word that you've given
[1:43:37] us.
[1:43:39] That you so preserved all these years to
[1:43:42] be true and faithful.
[1:43:46] Lord, we [music] ask that the
[1:43:47] brokenhearted would be lifted this
[1:43:49] morning and that we could walk from this
[1:43:52] place [music] strengthened by your grace
[1:43:54] and your mercy. Father, forgive us our
[1:43:57] trespasses and
[1:44:00] let us love one another with an undying
[1:44:03] love. We ask [music] you to be with us
[1:44:05] this morning. In Jesus precious name we
[1:44:08] pray. Amen. And amen. [music]
[1:44:12] Hallelujah. You love the Lord this
[1:44:15] morning. Nice to be here this [music]
[1:44:17] morning. I haven't been in Tucson for
[1:44:20] almost 10 years and has been since the
[1:44:24] passing of my good friend, Brother Doug,
[1:44:26] and his wife, Sister Imma Jean. And
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; but God's always got a perfect time for
[1:44:33] everything, doesn't he?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; That's the one thing that you can rest
[1:44:36] in. It's good to see my friends Bill and
[1:44:38] Marcy here. Brother Bill came out of
[1:44:41] California with me, I don't know, 50
[1:44:45] plus years ago.
[1:44:47] Eli Kendall, each one of you
[1:44:51] were united together because of God's
[1:44:53] word. That's right.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Because of his love for us, and he knew
[1:44:59] we'd be here. And that's what we just
[1:45:01] want to help fortify us uh this morning.
[1:45:06] So, if you turn with me in your Bibles
[1:45:10] and
[1:45:12] and uh
[1:45:17] and turn with me to Mark the 13th
[1:45:20] chapter,
[1:45:23] I'm sorry. Let's start with Matthew the
[1:45:26] 13th chapter
[1:45:29] and the 11th verse
[1:45:33] and then we'll turn to Mark the fourth
[1:45:36] chapter and the 11th verse.
[1:45:42] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:45:46] "Because it is given unto you to know
[1:45:50] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
[1:45:55] but unto them it is not given." That's
[1:45:59] right.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath, to him shall be
[1:46:05] given, and he shall have more
[1:46:08] abundantly.
[1:46:10] But whosoever hath not, from him shall
[1:46:14] be taken away, even that he hath.
[1:46:19] Amen. Let us also turn over to Mark
[1:46:29] and read the basically the same thought
[1:46:35] but Mark puts it
[1:46:38] in this context also and he says
[1:46:44] uh in uh Mark uh I think it's 4
[1:46:51] and 11 he speaks these words.
[1:46:55] He and he said unto them, unto you it is
[1:46:59] given to know the mysteries of the
[1:47:02] kingdom of God, but unto them that are
[1:47:06] without.
[1:47:08] All these things are done in parables.
[1:47:12] Seeing they may see and not perceive,
[1:47:17] and hearing they may hear and not
[1:47:20] understand,
[1:47:22] lest at any time they should be
[1:47:24] converted,
[1:47:26] and their sins should be forgiven
[1:47:30] a them. Our father, we ask you to bless
[1:47:33] your word to us. In your precious name
[1:47:35] we pray. Amen. God bless you. You may
[1:47:38] [snorts] be seated. I'll I'll try to
[1:47:40] move right along this morning.
[1:47:42] You know, this is my favorite setting
[1:47:45] right here. I like just uh a small group
[1:47:49] of people and and where you can see one
[1:47:52] another. I tell you, you don't know how
[1:47:55] precious it is when you start. I I I
[1:47:59] know what it's like to have a meeting
[1:48:01] and I know what it's like to build a
[1:48:03] building and I know what it's like to
[1:48:06] start in just a little teeny place. We
[1:48:10] when we started, we had to sweep up
[1:48:12] cigarettes the night before because they
[1:48:15] had the dance. And then we got we moved
[1:48:18] to a little church. Our first little
[1:48:19] church building was on a street called
[1:48:22] Broadway in Halam City. That's where
[1:48:25] brother George came to visit me for the
[1:48:28] first time. And then from there we moved
[1:48:30] to another place and another place and
[1:48:34] and all along the way it was labor of
[1:48:38] love. Each people putting in their labor
[1:48:42] and their time together. And that's what
[1:48:45] makes us a body. You know, we're not a
[1:48:48] religion.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; We're a people.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; You know, culture is taught. It's not
[1:48:57] inherited.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. You you learn because
[1:49:00] you're taught things. You're taught the
[1:49:02] way to think, the way to act, the way to
[1:49:04] perceive, where to go, where not to go.
[1:49:07] And and and so, but we have a culture.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Our culture is the word of God.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; We're we're not we're not we're not a
[1:49:17] religious. We don't have something that
[1:49:19] we believe. We have something that we
[1:49:22] are.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; And I want to say that again. It's not
[1:49:26] something that we believe. It's
[1:49:28] something that we are.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And and it it was planned that way by
[1:49:36] God. He he he we trust. He knows all
[1:49:40] things. Uh when he dealt with brother
[1:49:43] Israel, he knew this place would be
[1:49:45] here. And it wasn't only for you. It's
[1:49:49] for those maybe that we haven't met yet,
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; we haven't seen yet. that that are
[1:49:56] hungering and thirsting after
[1:49:59] righteousness.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; And he he's made us different and he's
[1:50:04] done these things for a purpose and for
[1:50:07] a cause and and it's for his glory.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; You know, I just thought of uh coming
[1:50:15] here this morning, I thought when I
[1:50:17] first came into the message, you know,
[1:50:19] the only thing we knew was Malachi 4:5.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; It's all we knew. God sent a prophet.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; I just knew God sent a prophet. You
[1:50:28] know, Malachi 4:5 and great and dreadful
[1:50:31] day of the Lord.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet. He's Malachi 45. His
[1:50:35] name is William Brandom.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I didn't even know what he taught.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what he taught. I didn't
[1:50:42] know what he believed. I just knew he
[1:50:44] was a prophet.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; And and that revelation opened the door
[1:50:49] for me to to hear what he had to say.
[1:50:52] And so, you know, we we didn't know
[1:50:55] anything. And and what did we do? All of
[1:50:58] a sudden, we found out what he taught. I
[1:51:00] found out about long hair,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; you know. And I I had to cut my hair. We
[1:51:06] found out about dress. We found out
[1:51:08] about clothing. The first few years I
[1:51:11] was in the message, I listened to tape,
[1:51:13] alls I heard was hair, pants, makeup.
[1:51:19] You You know what I mean? I don't care
[1:51:21] what tape I could have put on. I could
[1:51:23] have put on the seventh seal and that's
[1:51:26] all I heard.
[1:51:28] You You know what I mean? No music, no
[1:51:31] this, no that. You know, it was just I I
[1:51:34] don't know. God has a knows how to feed
[1:51:36] you.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; And when to feed you. It's all stored
[1:51:39] up.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; But it takes the spirit of God to take
[1:51:42] it out in season. You know, it was
[1:51:45] spiritual food for the due season. and
[1:51:48] and and that's all we knew, you know,
[1:51:51] and and uh and and then we moved on a
[1:51:54] little farther, you know, and and uh we
[1:51:58] we we found out about church order. I
[1:52:01] mean, alls I heard for the next two
[1:52:03] years was church order. be at church at
[1:52:07] 9:30, pay your tithes, pay your
[1:52:09] offerings, you know that you got to have
[1:52:12] pastors, you got to have someone over,
[1:52:15] you know, and and but if he said it, I
[1:52:20] believed it.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; You know, so I had moved in from ABC's
[1:52:26] found out about church order and then we
[1:52:29] moved in and found out about this
[1:52:31] opening of the seals
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; and the the church hes you know and saw
[1:52:36] the history of the church coming down.
[1:52:39] Saw the horse riders sitting within the
[1:52:41] framework of the history of the church.
[1:52:44] Saw the seed going to the ground and and
[1:52:47] come up again. And and we saw all those
[1:52:50] things, things we didn't know, things I
[1:52:52] didn't. It was right in God's word.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; All the time, you know, and but God knew
[1:52:57] his season. He he he was growing us. He
[1:53:00] was ripening us. He was he was drawing
[1:53:04] us through the filter of his word that
[1:53:07] all the impurities would go out of his
[1:53:10] life because he had something for us.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; You know, he's got something for us. And
[1:53:16] and so, you know, and then we, you know,
[1:53:20] we we saw the seals. We we saw these
[1:53:23] things. I'm just talking about myself.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; You know, I didn't come into the message
[1:53:27] on Tuesday and know everything he said
[1:53:29] on Wednesday.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; You You know what I mean? And I I'll be
[1:53:37] honest with you, there's still things
[1:53:38] that he says that I I don't know yet.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know everything that's in there.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:46] In fact, I feel there's more in there
[1:53:49] than what I know.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm hungry for it.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I'm in anticipation for it.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want to set up camp.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to believe that that
[1:54:04] he he'll feed me till the day he changes
[1:54:08] me.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; And you know, then we we Our eyes begin
[1:54:16] to open and we saw that it just wasn't a
[1:54:21] man there.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; A preacher,
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; you understand? But that by the great
[1:54:27] wisdom of God, God had veiled himself.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; And now he was unveiling himself. And we
[1:54:34] begin to see and understand the ministry
[1:54:37] of the son of man. how that God came in
[1:54:41] the and if I could say that and veiled
[1:54:44] himself in a prophetic ministry
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; and it it just wasn't him standing there
[1:54:50] as William Brandon but that the the the
[1:54:54] Lord himself had veiled himself in there
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; and we saw that it was that that deity
[1:55:02] was amongst us
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; though he was just such a yielded vessel
[1:55:08] And we could feel an anointing and a
[1:55:12] presence that that came when we
[1:55:15] listened, you know,
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; to him. And there was nothing like when
[1:55:19] you start to listen and understand.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; And and as your revelation grew, the
[1:55:25] more you wanted to hear.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; And the more you understood the that it
[1:55:32] this wasn't an uneducated man. This was
[1:55:35] the divinely educated man. He he he
[1:55:39] didn't come from a university.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And and I I'll
[1:55:44] just say this and and sure that if
[1:55:47] corrected, but I believe he grew
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; as God opened the word to him. I I
[1:55:54] believe he prayed for revelation just
[1:55:58] like he asked us to pray to revelation
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; and and as and as our brother said as it
[1:56:04] was revealed to him he'd come back and
[1:56:06] reveal it to us
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; and and so we grew and and so you know
[1:56:13] we we we understood the son of man and
[1:56:16] and then you know then it seemed like
[1:56:18] there was a great shift away to who we
[1:56:22] are.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. All of a sudden, all the people
[1:56:25] were saying, "Who you are? Who you are?
[1:56:28] Who you are?" You know, that was we all
[1:56:31] wanted to know who we were, where that
[1:56:33] we fit.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And and so I come to this place this
[1:56:36] morning and I I I say, "Well, what's our
[1:56:40] path forward?"
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; And so I I'm I told brother Israel, all
[1:56:47] what I really want to preach to you this
[1:56:49] morning is his congregation.
[1:56:52] Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; You know what I can do to help
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; his congregation and your path forward
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; because I want you to be successful
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; and there's a way to be successful
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; and the way to success is always in
[1:57:11] God's word.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:13] Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And so I have a little thought this
[1:57:17] morning if you'd bear with me. And I
[1:57:19] would like to call it the children of
[1:57:23] prophecy.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; You are the children
[1:57:29] of prophecy.
[1:57:31] And if I could say that that a a a
[1:57:35] prophecy is a message
[1:57:39] containing divine will and fornowledge
[1:57:44] of future events.
[1:57:47] That's what prophecy is.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And prophecy has a child
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; or it birthed something. If I could say
[1:57:57] it this way, the Lord said, "In the
[1:58:00] beginning was God and God created the
[1:58:04] heavens and the earth." And you go and
[1:58:08] read in the first uh first chapter, the
[1:58:11] third verse of the book of Genesis, he
[1:58:14] says, "Let there be light."
[1:58:17] And there was light.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Now, let there be light was the
[1:58:21] prophecy. And then light was the child
[1:58:26] of that prophecy.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; So God doesn't do anything until he
[1:58:32] speaks it first.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; So he he said, "Let there be and and and
[1:58:38] there was light." And so that prophecy
[1:58:41] gave birth to light.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; You know, in the scripture, the
[1:58:46] scripture says, "A virgin shall
[1:58:48] conceive."
[1:58:50] And and Mary was the child of that
[1:58:55] prophecy.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That what what it was. She was the
[1:59:00] child of that prophecy. It was spoken.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; But if the the word of God never just
[1:59:06] remains spoken. It's always manifested
[1:59:10] because if it's not manifested, it's not
[1:59:13] interpreted. God interprets his word by
[1:59:16] bringing it to pass. So we he doesn't
[1:59:20] need interpretation. He said let there
[1:59:23] be light. The the and that was the what
[1:59:26] he prophesied. He said let there be
[1:59:28] light. That was spoken. That was the
[1:59:30] prophecy. The light was what was
[1:59:33] manifested and that became the
[1:59:35] interpretation of that. Now remember
[1:59:39] this morning we're talking about you
[1:59:41] being the children of prophecy.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:46] So that virgin conceived and then the
[1:59:49] scripture said there will be he'll there
[1:59:51] will be one born unto us a a child and
[1:59:54] he shall be called counselor prince of
[1:59:56] peace mighty God. The scripture spoke
[2:00:00] the old testament spoke out it was what?
[2:00:04] Prophesying in sundried times and
[2:00:07] diverse manners. God spoke by his
[2:00:09] prophets and the word of God was spoken
[2:00:13] out
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; and and that word would not return void.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; It had to produce a child.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; You understand? There had to be
[2:00:23] something that came into existence by
[2:00:27] the word that was spoken.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Else not, it's intellect.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; It just sits back intellectual. it it
[2:00:37] has no reality
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; to it.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And and that's the one thing that we
[2:00:43] want. We don't want to worship history.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; We we want to find him in his living
[2:00:50] reality in the moment that we're living
[2:00:53] and know that he's here.
[2:00:56] Oh yes. [screaming]
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; So we we find out that there was so many
[2:01:06] prophecies spoken of him. He said,
[2:01:08] "Search the scriptures."
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; In them, you think you have life.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; So obviously they were searching the
[2:01:19] scriptures, but they weren't catching
[2:01:21] the life of it.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. because they weren't catching the
[2:01:25] child that the prophecy birth.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; They they didn't understand why it was
[2:01:32] spoken.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Just this message itself, it's got a
[2:01:37] reason it was spoken.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; It wasn't spoken so we could look back
[2:01:42] and say it's the truth.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; But it's spoken that we might understand
[2:01:47] that we're the children
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; of what was spoken.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:55] You're the children of prophecy.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:03] If I could just
[2:02:05] turn, our our brother spoke of of uh the
[2:02:10] uniting time and sign and I it just
[2:02:13] moved me so much to uh uh
[2:02:20] the word of God that was uh uh spoken in
[2:02:24] uh let me see if I I brought my message
[2:02:27] with me. I might have left it on the
[2:02:29] desk in there. Um,
[2:02:35] would you go see and and and see if I
[2:02:38] have that my the book in there? It's
[2:02:42] it's my book. I I'm I don't use
[2:02:45] computers.
[2:02:47] [laughter]
[2:02:49] You you you you
[2:02:52] have to understand
[2:02:54] uh that the only reason that I'm here is
[2:02:57] because I'm old. Uh that that was uh uh
[2:03:04] well, it it could be right up here on
[2:03:06] the platform with me and me not find it.
[2:03:09] So, let me see. Oh, I found it, brother.
[2:03:12] I told you [laughter] I'm old. So, there
[2:03:14] we go. And
[2:03:17] you know, and uh so that's why I'm here.
[2:03:21] So I don't use computers. I I still use
[2:03:24] books
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; and uh because I you know, I read a a
[2:03:28] statement where brother Bram said he
[2:03:30] said I hope you get it. He said read and
[2:03:33] listen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Read and listen. So I think that's a
[2:03:36] great point. But the I want to just take
[2:03:39] us just for a moment if you would bear
[2:03:43] with me because you are
[2:03:48] the children
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; of prophecy
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; that that if if if I if this could sink
[2:03:59] in this morning
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; for you here at Shalom
[2:04:04] Tabernacle
[2:04:06] that you could understand that
[2:04:10] that is the whole
[2:04:14] reason
[2:04:17] that you're here
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; is to fulfill what he's spoken
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; and I want us to just settle just for a
[2:04:28] moment as I read these things. The
[2:04:31] things I'm going to read this morning
[2:04:33] are from the message called the
[2:04:37] invisible union
[2:04:39] of Christ
[2:04:42] and the invisible union of the bride of
[2:04:45] Christ. You know, also referred to as
[2:04:48] the invisible union of the heavenly
[2:04:51] bridegroom
[2:04:53] and the earthly bride. This this is a a
[2:04:57] union
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; that is is so special
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; and it's so unique
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; and it is is so uh set aside.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; You know when we we understand that the
[2:05:15] unity that we're talking about isn't all
[2:05:18] of us being
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; buddies.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; You You know what I mean? Jesus said, "I
[2:05:26] I' I've not come to bring everybody.
[2:05:28] I've come to divide."
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; I've come to separate father against
[2:05:33] mother. God God's a separator.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; We know that
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; the the word of God tells us just like
[2:05:42] it's a prophecy. He He said, "Let there
[2:05:45] be light and there was light." Yeah.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; And we know that God's word calls for
[2:05:51] total separation from unbelief.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; It it's it's not a suggestion.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's not something
[2:06:01] that you say, "Well, I suggest that you
[2:06:05] separate yourself
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; from unbelief."
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; No. God's word called for it. In other
[2:06:12] words, he said there is going to be a
[2:06:15] separation from unbelief.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; There is that is a prophecy
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; in other words that there's there is
[2:06:24] going to be
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; a people
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; that are separated from unbelief cuz God
[2:06:32] called for it.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, if he called for it,
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; then there's got to be somebody there
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; that's the child of that call.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a people
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; that that he knew
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; when he spoke it.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; He knew that that was going to produce a
[2:06:58] child.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. that there would be a people that
[2:07:02] would separate themselves all from
[2:07:04] unbelief by their doing.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; No, not by their doing, but because they
[2:07:10] were the child of the prophecy.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; When God's word calls for total
[2:07:18] separation from unbelief,
[2:07:22] that's me.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; You understand? We begin to look at the
[2:07:29] word of God as the yearum thundum.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; It's the mirror.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to look at that
[2:07:37] mirror and then turn and say, "That's
[2:07:39] me."
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; That's me. That that that
[2:07:44] speaks of me.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; It's like healing.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; We believe God's a healer. But he told
[2:07:52] us what to do. Healing's a prophecy.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. By your stripes you are healed.
[2:07:59] Well, you find yourself sick.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Does everybody that get sick get healed?
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:08:11] But it's given to some.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; It's given to some to know the mystery
[2:08:19] of word of God.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; It's given to some. And he said, "What
[2:08:23] you do is you you you become the child
[2:08:27] of that prophecy and you look at a well
[2:08:30] man
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; and then you walk into it."
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, you walk into what's
[2:08:37] been spoken of you.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; You walk into you're not you're you're
[2:08:41] not instantly there, but you ripen into
[2:08:45] it. You grow into it. You move into it.
[2:08:50] And as the body of believers here,
[2:08:52] you've got to understand that God knew
[2:08:55] you would be here. He understood it was
[2:08:57] his will. And he's got something in his
[2:09:00] mind that he wants you to grow into.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; If you would just listen closely as I
[2:09:16] read, we know that
[2:09:19] there's a union
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; and there's a bride that's going to come
[2:09:23] together
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; because it's spoken
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; and there will be people that are a part
[2:09:31] of it And there will be people that
[2:09:33] won't be a part of it.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; We know there's an anointing
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; and and a baptism of the spirit.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; And that's what the mystery of of
[2:09:48] anointing the ones at the end time was.
[2:09:51] That here's brother George. I'll use
[2:09:53] brother George. Brother George. He has
[2:09:56] the anointing on him.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; He's anointed and I'm anointed.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing's the same.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; No difference in the anointing. But what
[2:10:08] the difference is is one has an elected
[2:10:11] seed in them and the other one doesn't.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; And that's why he said you never judged
[2:10:20] it by the anointing. He said you judged
[2:10:23] it by their belief and acceptance of the
[2:10:26] word of God. How they deviate
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; from the word of God is the only way you
[2:10:34] know it. You don't know it by the
[2:10:36] anointing. You know it by the deviation
[2:10:39] from the word of God
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; now. I want to find security in that.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Because I'm a child of the prophecy.
[2:10:54] I'm a child of what's been spoken
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; and I don't want to put it in my hands.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; I want to put it in his hands.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Let's read what he says.
[2:11:08] You think that's a good idea?
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; I I think that's a real good idea
[2:11:15] because with that we're always safe.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't you believe that?
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; Now we're believers. We know that we're
[2:11:24] that uh just here in this great place
[2:11:28] that
[2:11:30] on a mountaintop
[2:11:34] in a canyon a sword
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; came in hand. We know that history.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; You understand that? We know not far
[2:11:42] from here a cloud appeared.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; And seven angels
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; appeared.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; We know that.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. We know that William Brandham
[2:11:54] fulfilled Malachi 4:5,
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30,
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:7,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; and this may sound
[2:12:07] uh
[2:12:09] maybe
[2:12:10] I hope you don't misunderstand that, but
[2:12:13] you can't base your faith on what he
[2:12:17] fulfilled.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:20] You've got to base your faith on what he
[2:12:23] prophesied.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, your faith anchor place
[2:12:33] is the word of God.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; George Washington crossed the Delaware.
[2:12:40] I guess that's a fact.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:12:48] It just but we based our whole country
[2:12:51] on it.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; So
[2:12:56] we this morning
[2:12:59] can absolutely
[2:13:02] 100%
[2:13:04] base our faith on what he spoke.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:13] because it's given unto you to
[2:13:16] understand the mysteries of God.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; There's many people I live in Dallas
[2:13:22] Fort Worth. I went to WV Grant's church
[2:13:26] to meet WV Grant. Were Grant reached out
[2:13:30] and he grabbed me by my collar just like
[2:13:33] this just as right to my face. He put
[2:13:37] his face up in my face. His son was
[2:13:39] preaching on the platform. He grabbed me
[2:13:42] and he said, "David, you see all these
[2:13:44] wheelchairs and all these crutches?" His
[2:13:48] lobby was full of them. He said, "9 and
[2:13:51] 9/10 of them came from William Brandom's
[2:13:54] meetings."
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; And he never believed.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; He He actually looked me in the eye. He
[2:14:05] said, "David, whatever you do, you stay
[2:14:08] with William Brandom." He was the only
[2:14:12] true prophet I ever knew.
[2:14:16] [applause and cheering]
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; I I that was a soul's harbor.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; We walked away from that place and two
[2:14:31] weeks later WB Grant passed away.
[2:14:35] I'm so glad,
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; he had that testimony
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; on his lips
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; to when he went to meet the Lord.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Follow me just a moment. Children of
[2:14:50] prophecy.
[2:14:56] He's talking about sers as this the time
[2:14:59] and how that he prophesied about it and
[2:15:02] spoke what he saw in the vision and how
[2:15:04] that we know it came to pass.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; So it birthed
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; the seven seals. Yeah.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then we've got the revelation
[2:15:14] in this last days for the message of of
[2:15:19] the Lord God to gather his bride
[2:15:22] together."
[2:15:24] We've got the message to gather the
[2:15:26] bride together. No other age has it been
[2:15:30] promised. It's been promised for this
[2:15:35] age.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, John 14:12,
[2:15:41] Joel 2:38. Those promises is just
[2:15:44] exactly like John the Baptist identified
[2:15:47] himself in the scriptures.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, he was identified
[2:15:53] in the scriptures. He was the child
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; of those prophecies coming to pass.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; They didn't come to pass in any other
[2:16:04] man. They didn't come to pass in any
[2:16:06] other ministry. There were there was no
[2:16:09] other messengers, no other age. They
[2:16:12] were it was totally the scriptures, the
[2:16:17] prophesied
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; prophecies of Malachi 4:5. William
[2:16:21] Brandham was the child of the prophecy
[2:16:25] of Malachi 4.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Can you can you understand that? because
[2:16:32] uh but you're a child of prophecy, too.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's that's not the day that we're
[2:16:42] living in.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; That's the day that produced us.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; But it's not the time. And if you try to
[2:16:53] live there
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; and not live in the prophecy,
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; you'll find that the prophecy will pass
[2:17:01] you by.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; We want to go forward, don't we?
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; We want to have victory. I I'll read and
[2:17:12] just read these statements and close
[2:17:14] quickly.
[2:17:22] You know, he makes this statement. He
[2:17:25] says Jesus identified himself.
[2:17:29] What do they say? Away with such a
[2:17:32] person. John's a wild man. The church
[2:17:36] wasn't able to receive it. It's the
[2:17:39] pattern.
[2:17:40] Neither will the church receive it
[2:17:42] today.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; It's the pattern.
[2:17:46] It's given unto you to know the
[2:17:48] mysteries of God, but to others it is
[2:17:51] not.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Even to the point that
[2:17:57] lest they repent,
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; it wasn't given to them.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; That wasn't who they were.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; But he says this. He says, "But to the
[2:18:11] elect." God is calling to the elect.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; God is calling
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; to the elect.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. When the disciples
[2:18:26] went away and they went out and they
[2:18:28] they done all these great miracles and
[2:18:30] all these these great works and they
[2:18:33] came back and they were rejoicing. He
[2:18:35] said, "I saw Satan falling from the sky
[2:18:39] and and they were so excited." But you
[2:18:40] know what he told them? He said, "Don't
[2:18:44] rejoice
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; because these spirits were subject to
[2:18:47] you, but rather rejoice because your
[2:18:50] name was written on the book of life.
[2:18:53] Amen.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; He He's trying to identify you.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring us to the place
[2:19:05] that we understand we are the
[2:19:08] manifestation
[2:19:10] of what that he spoke. [cheering]
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; It's not something that we believe out
[2:19:19] here. Amen.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; It's something that we actually are.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; I am.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; The elect,
[2:19:41] they know it.
[2:19:44] calling a virtuous bride, the word, the
[2:19:49] last day church, the elected lady of our
[2:19:53] Lord
[2:19:55] Jesus Christ.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; The elected
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; lady,
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; the chosen lady.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Just follow me for a few quotes if you
[2:20:06] would.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[2:20:18] Do we believe
[2:20:20] the prophecy?
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Not the history,
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; but what's spoken
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; then the bride is always part of the
[2:20:40] bridegroom.
[2:20:42] So, the bride will not be a
[2:20:44] denomination.
[2:20:45] It'll have to be the word manifested
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; to be the bride of Christ.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; It'll have to be the prophecy
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; birthed.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; And come into existence
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; to be the bride of Christ.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? If it wasn't spoken, if
[2:21:06] it was never spoken that there would be
[2:21:08] a bride, there was no way that we could
[2:21:11] decide that we were the bride.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God even says there's
[2:21:17] been brides and brides and brides and
[2:21:19] churches and churches.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody can make the claim. I don't
[2:21:24] care about the claims. I care about the
[2:21:27] reality of the prophecy coming to pass.
[2:21:31] Amen.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; That's what I care about. I want to be
[2:21:35] able to look into THE MIRROR OF GOD'S
[2:21:37] WORD AND SAY, "THAT'S ME.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; I'm what he was speaking about.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; And walk away
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; confident
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; that I was more than a man that spoke
[2:21:56] it.
[2:22:03] Listen,
[2:22:04] he promised
[2:22:06] to do it.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; He promised to call out and elect
[2:22:11] people.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; He promised to do it. Can I put another
[2:22:15] word there? He prophesied
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; to do it.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; It will be.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:23] He said how he did never
[2:22:28] loses his pattern.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; He always did it by the pattern.
[2:22:35] He does it every time by the pattern.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; He does it again. Calls out his virtuous
[2:22:42] bride in the last day.
[2:22:46] The lovely Rebecca waiting for Isaac.
[2:22:50] What a beautiful time. What does he do?
[2:22:52] He always does it.
[2:22:55] Isn't that right?
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; He always does it the same way. He never
[2:23:01] changes his method.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says now. You're the
[2:23:06] So what I'm what I You understand what
[2:23:08] I'm trying to say? I'm reading to you
[2:23:10] what brother Brandham said,
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; but this is in 1965.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; So what he said then is prophecy today.
[2:23:23] That's correct.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; He spoke it,
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; but what he spoke had to become flesh.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; And there's got to be somebody somewhere
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; that says, "This is me.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; I'm the child of this prophecy.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm who he spoke of. [cheering]
[2:23:50] Can you imagine as a body believers
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; shalom tabernacle if you could walk out
[2:23:57] in this Tucson with a burning light in
[2:24:00] you knowing you're the CHILDREN OF GOD
[2:24:03] KNOWING YOU WERE CALLED FOR A PURPOSE.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; You would change
[2:24:14] the atmosphere
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; around you.
[2:24:21] Now I want you to notice
[2:24:24] he does it
[2:24:27] in that way in every age. He does it
[2:24:32] every time by the same method.
[2:24:37] He has to take believers.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; And then in order to have believers to
[2:24:46] meet the word,
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; he's got to predestinate it to that age.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; You see it?
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; He had to predestinate.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; He had to prophesy.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; He had to say, "There's going to be
[2:25:02] believers there. There's going to be
[2:25:04] somebody there that will receive the
[2:25:06] word. There's there's go they're they're
[2:25:09] going to be there. I'm going to have
[2:25:11] them be there.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of that prophecy. Yes, you
[2:25:29] are.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that he spoke of
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; when he said he'd have a believer there.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter that I was in
[2:25:37] California. It didn't matter. I was
[2:25:39] selling drugs with the Hell's Angel
[2:25:41] motorcycle gang. It didn't matter I had
[2:25:44] long hair. It didn't matter how de
[2:25:47] wretched I was.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; He spoke it.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; He planted it.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; He prophesied it. He was going to get me
[2:25:57] from where I was TO WHERE HE PROPHESIED
[2:26:00] THAT I would be
[2:26:03] [cheering]
[2:26:04] [applause]
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; and nothing was going to stop it.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; He's speaking of you here.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; This is this is
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; this is shalom.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:26:27] Amen.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; He's got to predestinate it to that age.
[2:26:30] You see it? He's got to predestinate
[2:26:33] this thing to be there in order to meet
[2:26:36] the challenge of the age.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Do you feel it?
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Do you see it?
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Do you understand it?
[2:26:53] That's what's happening today.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; He predestinated it to this by
[2:26:59] fornowledge.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; He predestinated in Malachi 4, it's got
[2:27:05] to happen.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; And when he come over and predestinated
[2:27:09] anything to happen in his word, he had
[2:27:13] to prove his word to be so.
[2:27:16] And when he predestinates anything to
[2:27:19] happen and says it will happen, he knows
[2:27:24] that seed will be there just at that
[2:27:27] time. He predestinated a bride. She's
[2:27:31] going to be there.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Going to be a rapture. She's going to be
[2:27:42] there. He predestinates it by
[2:27:45] fornowledge. See, there's nothing going
[2:27:48] to stop it.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you to believe that this
[2:27:54] morning.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; You automatically believe it because
[2:27:58] Brother Brandham said it.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; But I'm asking you to take possession of
[2:28:02] it.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; I I want you to hear when he says
[2:28:09] there's going to BE A BRIDE. SHE has to
[2:28:11] be there. I want you to say, I'M THE
[2:28:14] CHILD OF THAT PROPHECY.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; I think that you're that you're getting
[2:28:30] the point
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; there. It's just so so beautiful
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; that the things that he said, the things
[2:28:50] that he told us that we were
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; we believe those things.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; We we we understand those things. Amen.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, just think
[2:29:08] you you don't you don't think this is
[2:29:10] different.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; I I got so many quotes written down
[2:29:14] here. I'm just I I I just get into this
[2:29:16] and it thrills my soul.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; I know there's anointed ones at the end
[2:29:24] time.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; I know there's people I don't agree
[2:29:28] with.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; I have good friends. I mean, they're my
[2:29:33] friends. I love them.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to hate them.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; I have friends that only play tapes.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; I I I play tapes.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; I I told Brother Israel, I said, "I you
[2:29:49] got me in the worst place in the world.
[2:29:51] I got to preach after brother George. I
[2:29:54] got to preach after brother Ferguson.
[2:29:57] And now I have to preach after the plane
[2:29:59] of the tape. [laughter]
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; I didn't want him to turn the tape off.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; But you know why I I love him?
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; It's because it's not there. It's in
[2:30:21] here. Amen.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; He took this stony heart
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; and replaced it
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; with a heart of flesh.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; And I know God doesn't change.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; I know he can change.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; We don't change the word. The word
[2:30:41] changes us.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; It comes to all of us in season.
[2:30:50] There's people that don't believe in
[2:30:52] preachers. I love them.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; The love doesn't come from doctrine.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; It comes from me being a sinner.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. You say the
[2:31:09] love of God comes from you being a
[2:31:11] sinner. Yeah.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Because I know where I come from.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; If I look back,
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; I'd never come into this pulpit.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; But I want to cover that now. I'm going
[2:31:29] to skip all the things I got wrote wrote
[2:31:31] here to read.
[2:31:34] You know, the things that he said. I'll
[2:31:38] just read a few of them. Amen.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "The anointed word of God being
[2:31:43] vindicated before any man that's born to
[2:31:47] be a son of God with the predestinated
[2:31:51] germ
[2:31:52] into him
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; for this hour,
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; he'll see God's message as sure as there
[2:31:59] is a God in heaven."
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that?
[2:32:12] He said here he said
[2:32:16] he the bridegroom took away your shame.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; And put in the sea of God's
[2:32:21] forgetfulness.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Washed by the
[2:32:25] water of the word and the blood of life.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. your first
[2:32:33] husband that you were married to the
[2:32:36] world, the anointed bridegroom which
[2:32:40] forained
[2:32:42] you.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; I I I I want to keep laying this down.
[2:32:48] You're predestinated.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; You're forordained.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; He put the seed in you
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; You were with him in his thinking. If
[2:33:01] you ever had eternal life, you always
[2:33:05] had eternal life.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; We're not used to thinking that way.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; That's shuck thinking.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; But he's prophesying.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; There's a seed.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; There's a predestinated seed.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; It was in his thinking. He wrote your
[2:33:26] name on the lamb's book of life
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. If
[2:33:32] it wasn't there, you won't be there.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; But if it's there, nothing can put it
[2:33:38] on. Nothing can take it off.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; You understand? You are. Those were
[2:33:46] prophecies.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Those were things that he spoke. Those
[2:33:50] were things that there were. And there's
[2:33:52] a predestinated people that God put here
[2:33:56] that would see that, believe that,
[2:33:59] accept that, and understand that was
[2:34:02] their identification.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; See, what breaks my heart
[2:34:12] is I see the heaviness
[2:34:16] of our past.
[2:34:21] and what we are in the flesh
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; weighing on us.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; We just can't seem to wrap our
[2:34:34] minds
[2:34:37] around
[2:34:39] what he's done for us.
[2:34:42] We just can't seem to bring ourselves
[2:34:46] to the realization
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; of of what that he says.
[2:34:53] He said
[2:34:54] you were fore orained to it.
[2:34:59] He goes here says you are standing
[2:35:02] completely justified
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; as though you never did it at the
[2:35:07] beginning.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:12] That
[2:35:14] is my message
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; He talks about as we go off the air, he
[2:35:28] says you are standing if you're standing
[2:35:31] on God's word.
[2:35:34] Because if you're standing on what he
[2:35:36] said,
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; if you're standing on what he
[2:35:40] prophesied, if you're standing on the
[2:35:43] word, the word for this age, the word
[2:35:46] for this hour, if you're standing on
[2:35:48] that and you believe what he said, you
[2:35:51] believe what he said about you,
[2:35:54] he said, and you're and you're you're on
[2:35:58] God's word and with God's word, every
[2:36:01] amen, every jot, every tit
[2:36:04] Where are you standing? I'm trying to
[2:36:06] get you to pull away from them chucks
[2:36:10] [cough]
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; from that old thinking.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Quit looking in your mirror and look in
[2:36:18] what God's mirror says of you.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; he says, "Come out into the wheat where
[2:36:27] you can get right before the sun. I hear
[2:36:30] the combines coming. You're standing
[2:36:33] completely justified.
[2:36:36] You never did it in the first place.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; What did he he he he say over here? But
[2:36:49] the word justified is as though you
[2:36:52] never done it.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; It's not even regarded at all. Amen.
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; How is it done in God's book of the sea
[2:37:02] of God's forgetfulness? Your old book
[2:37:05] and marriage is divorced is dead. Even
[2:37:09] even in the memory of God.
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; You say he knows all things. No, he
[2:37:22] don't.
[2:37:25] Oh, that's a little tough.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; I'll read you. I can read you it
[2:37:34] straight out of the book where he says
[2:37:36] God doesn't even know it.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:37:46] Because that's not where we were in the
[2:37:49] beginning.
[2:37:54] That's not where we were in the
[2:37:56] beginning.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; You know this.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; You knew you were in his thinking,
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; right? How long you been in this
[2:38:08] message?
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; How many go listen to rising of the sun?
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; Go listen to the Easter Seal.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Go listen to Invisible Union of the
[2:38:20] bride.
[2:38:22] That that's the prophecy.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; Go read Satan's Eden,
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; God of this evil age.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; The indictment.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; God hasn't lost control.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; There's two powers.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Satan's power lying and God's power
[2:38:40] telling the truth to his elected lady.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; It's not a great mystery.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; It's very simple.
[2:38:50] We believe what he said,
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; not the history of it,
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; but the unfolding of it
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; God can only reveal himself to the you
[2:39:09] that you were in the beginning.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? You were with him in
[2:39:16] the beginning.
[2:39:19] Has that has that settled in?
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; He he goes he
[2:39:30] like I'll just you guys can go back and
[2:39:32] read it. You never you you just never
[2:39:35] did it in in the f in the first place.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; It was thrown. He accused you
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; but you never done it in the first
[2:39:45] place. The old union is in the sea of
[2:39:48] God's forgetfulness.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; You wasn't married to it to what?
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; Begin with
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; he, the bridegroom, bore your shame
[2:39:59] himself.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; For you were for you were in your place.
[2:40:04] He took your place. For you were
[2:40:07] predestinated
[2:40:09] for him to be his bride before the
[2:40:14] foundation of the world. The Bible said
[2:40:17] so. You are predestinated
[2:40:20] seed.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; I hope that shalom tabernacle
[2:40:26] will walk from this place saying I am
[2:40:29] predestinated.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; I am the bride of Christ.
[2:40:35] or we are we were elected
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; for this hour
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; our path forward
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; is to walk in the prophecy that was
[2:40:50] spoke of us.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; I love this message with all my heart.
[2:40:58] I was on the earth when my prophet left.
[2:41:05] I didn't sit in the meetings.
[2:41:08] I knew the men that did.
[2:41:11] And how when he walked in a room
[2:41:14] that he sucked the life
[2:41:18] out of that room and presented the
[2:41:20] presence and the glory of God. Amen.
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; I've talked to people that have stood at
[2:41:25] him when he would look them in the eyes.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; That wasn't given to me.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Do I wish it was?
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:41:38] I knew the men that knew him.
[2:41:42] I've watched them cross the portal one
[2:41:45] by one.
[2:41:46] But there's one thing I've ever
[2:41:49] understood from everybody that knew him.
[2:41:52] I saw the change
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; in their life.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; I saw the humility.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; I saw the reverence.
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; I I I I I just I I saw the nature that
[2:42:05] they knew it was bigger than they were.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; All their doctrines, all their
[2:42:10] knowledge, all their thinking
[2:42:13] that this man possessed something that
[2:42:15] was bigger.
[2:42:17] I wasn't privileged to that. But what I
[2:42:20] am privileged to is what he stored up
[2:42:23] for me to eat.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; The past didn't blind me.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; I was a child of what he spoke.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the prophecy. Yes.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; On the child of when he spoke that there
[2:42:48] would be a bride,
[2:42:49] &gt;&gt; that there would be an elect lady,
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; that there was a seed and the seed had
[2:42:54] that power to transform itself.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Those are the things that we are.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; The people that listen to him,
[2:43:05] it passed them by like like you couldn't
[2:43:08] understand it. You go up and you said,
[2:43:10] "How can he sit there and raise the dead
[2:43:13] and do all the miracles and all those
[2:43:15] things and and not see it?" And yet they
[2:43:18] had the same anointing on them
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; that every other believer had on them.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; They love the Lord.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. It wasn't given to them,
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; but it was given
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; to you.
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; You're the child
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; of that prophet.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; You're the one he knew in the beginning.
[2:43:55] You are the one
[2:43:58] that he said stand perfectly
[2:44:02] without spot,
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; without wrinkle.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; That you never did it in the first
[2:44:08] place.
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, the spiritual union of Christ and
[2:44:12] his church. Now, when the flesh is
[2:44:16] becoming word,
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; that's me.
[2:44:25] You say, "Oh, it just can't be. You're a
[2:44:27] sinner."
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "I never did it
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; in the beginning."
[2:44:43] And the and the
[2:44:48] when the flesh is becoming word and the
[2:44:51] word is becoming flesh, manifested,
[2:44:54] vindicated, just what the Bible said
[2:44:57] would happen in this day is happening.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, you're standing
[2:45:05] completely.
[2:45:07] You never sinned at the first place. God
[2:45:11] don't even know.
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; Just think of how our spirits when you
[2:45:20] heard me say that that little thing
[2:45:24] you start putting it through your
[2:45:25] filter.
[2:45:29] Let this message filter your thoughts.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You
[2:45:36] never did it. You were accused of it by
[2:45:40] the accuser, but really
[2:45:44] from the beginning, you were
[2:45:46] predestinated to be sons and daughters
[2:45:49] of God.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; You're standing there washed and your
[2:45:54] old book of divorcement is put away, is
[2:45:57] dead, absolutely
[2:46:00] out of existence, even in the mind of
[2:46:05] God.
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:46:11] I'm going to close with this statement
[2:46:14] if you would.
[2:46:16] I trust that
[2:46:20] it means to you what it means to me.
[2:46:25] There is somebody
[2:46:29] who is perfectly spotless.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:36] Look at the prophecy
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; look at what he said. [snorts]
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; And walk into it.
[2:46:50] [snorts]
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; He said I would be spotless.
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; He said he made me spotless.
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; He said that's not what I was in the
[2:46:57] beginning. Amen.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; He you you he not only did he do that,
[2:47:03] but he he even he even went further than
[2:47:08] that. And just think of of how far that
[2:47:13] he takes me back. He says, "Hallelujah."
[2:47:17] You notice you're not only that, but
[2:47:21] you're going to the wedding in the sky.
[2:47:23] You are wearing the wedding band of
[2:47:26] predestination.
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; Unmmerited grace,
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; a wedding band of grace unmmerited of
[2:47:36] your own.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; God did it himself.
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the
[2:47:43] world. So he slipped the wedding band on
[2:47:47] you there and put your name on the book.
[2:47:51] What? Thanksgiving. Hallelujah. Praise
[2:47:55] God. [cheering]
[2:47:57] [applause]
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; You You know what he said? He said, "I
[2:48:00] love that revelation more than anything
[2:48:03] else."
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; No, but do we believe it?
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Or when you look at yourself,
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; do you still see that sinful man?
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; Do you still see that flesh? You the you
[2:48:19] see the flesh that wars against the
[2:48:21] spirit
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; and these two are contrary.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; God don't even like your flesh.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; That's why he's going to give you a new
[2:48:30] body. [applause and cheering]
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; You we know why we're here.
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he wanted to reveal
[2:48:41] himself. He let us drop down here
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; so he could prove he's a savior,
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; a deliverer,
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; a healer.
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; That's not my existence.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; That's not God. That's not the real me.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; The real me was what I was in him.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; He looks at what he predestinated.
[2:49:07] Praise the Lord.
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; He looks at what he spoke.
[2:49:14] &gt;&gt; He looks at what he wrote.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; He looks at what he created
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; for you
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; in the beginning
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; and that's what he sees.
[2:49:31] But can we look at that
[2:49:34] this morning and not start looking at
[2:49:37] ourselves?
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; Not start looking at all our failures.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; Do I have failures? Yeah. But you know
[2:49:44] what also I have? I have a prophecy
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; that he became me
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; so I'll become him.
[2:49:54] That's right.
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to look at it
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to walk in it.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let God's word filter me.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; But I know what I am. I know where I'm
[2:50:05] going.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; I can look at you and say, "I come from
[2:50:09] God.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; I go to God.
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; You may doubt it, but he said it and I
[2:50:14] believe it. [cheering]
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of this prophecy.
[2:50:19] [applause]
[2:50:22] This ain't an old message.
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; This is something new.
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; This isn't Pentecost.
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; This was new.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; This was the eternal return.
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; To what you were in the beginning.
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; And you can look at this flesh and say,
[2:50:42] "Oh flesh,
[2:50:44] oh grave, where's your sting?
[2:50:47] Yeah,
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; I have a crown of life
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; predestinated for me to wear.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; My name's written in a book.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; He said he'd have a bride. He's going to
[2:50:57] have a bride.
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; And either you're going to put yourself
[2:51:00] in this morning or you're going to put
[2:51:03] yourself out.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:51:11] You're either you're going to take the
[2:51:13] prophecy,
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; Despite where you're at,
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; and know that it's got to come to pass,
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; and it's going to come to pass in me.
[2:51:27] &gt;&gt; Mary said, "Let it be done
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; according to thy will.
[2:51:48] Jesus looked at Peter
[2:51:51] and to said, "Who do men say that I am?"
[2:51:57] He said, "Thou art the Christ,
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[2:52:06] He said, "Blessed art thou, see
[2:52:10] Simon of Jonah, flesh and blood never
[2:52:13] revealed this to you,
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; but my father which in heaven has
[2:52:17] revealed it."
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't reveal to me my
[2:52:22] name was on the lamb book.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't reveal to me that
[2:52:29] I was going to a wedding supper.
[2:52:34] How many wants to go to the wedding
[2:52:37] supper?
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; You're going to see me there.
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; I'm there.
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied.
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just so hard to believe, isn't
[2:52:58] it?
[2:53:03] You're looking at me.
[2:53:07] &gt;&gt; Your minds are going a mile a minute.
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; You just can't see how it's possible.
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; You know why it's possible? He
[2:53:18] prophesied it.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; He told Noah, "It's going to rain." Yes.
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody went
[2:53:27] [laughter]
[2:53:29] right. What's that?
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; Rapture. What's that?
[2:53:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; Election.
[2:53:39] What's that?
[2:53:41] Predestination.
[2:53:42] What's that?
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; I didn't choose him.
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; He chose me. [cheering]
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; I didn't start the work.
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; He started it. [cheering]
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; I can't finish the work.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; He'll finish it.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; I just know one thing.
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; I was predestinated.
[2:54:19] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[2:54:21] &gt;&gt; I've been reunited
[2:54:26] &gt;&gt; with the nature
[2:54:28] &gt;&gt; I had in him
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; in the beginning.
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't see that." It
[2:54:37] don't matter if you see it. But if you
[2:54:40] believe it's prophesied of you,
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; and you know you're a child of that
[2:54:46] prophecy,
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; then you know it'll come to pass.
[2:54:55] &gt;&gt; Mary, not knowing a man.
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:54:59] &gt;&gt; Believed it was going to happen. Amen.
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; see no evidence whatsoever
[2:55:08] believed.
[2:55:10] Children of Abraham,
[2:55:12] &gt;&gt; children of prophecy,
[2:55:14] &gt;&gt; believe that the God that made the
[2:55:17] promise was able to bring it to pass.
[2:55:21] &gt;&gt; The God that said I was predestinated to
[2:55:24] be THE BRIDE. THE GOD THAT SAID MY NAME
[2:55:27] was put on the Lamb's book of life. The
[2:55:29] God that said there was a germ SEED THAT
[2:55:31] FOUND ME. That God is able to bring THIS
[2:55:35] PROPHECY TO PASS.
[2:55:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of that prophecy.
[2:55:52] In closing,
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; oh my goodness, I got lost. I I've
[2:56:00] redeemed you, brother. You'll never be a
[2:56:01] long- winded preacher again. I just I
[2:56:04] just took that over from you.
[2:56:08] He said, he said this,
[2:56:11] if it was flesh in the days of the son,
[2:56:14] the groom, it'll be flesh today by the
[2:56:17] bride.
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; Whosoever sins you remit,
[2:56:24] to them they are remitted.
[2:56:26] Whoseever sins you retain, to them they
[2:56:30] are retained.
[2:56:33] That's what he said. He says, "Now
[2:56:34] that's made flesh
[2:56:37] in the bride.
[2:56:40] Your ability
[2:56:43] to retain
[2:56:47] and remit sin."
[2:56:52] But listen
[2:56:54] now, the Catholic Church picked that up
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; and takes it to their priest.
[2:57:00] But that's carnal.
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:57:03] See, they picked it up. Would you
[2:57:05] forgive me? Would you forgive me? Would
[2:57:09] you forgive me? But that's not what he
[2:57:11] said.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Forgive me.
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; You can't forgive me
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; cuz I never did it in the first place."
[2:57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; This guy did it.
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:32] But that ain't the real me.
[2:57:36] [applause]
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; Who can lay anything to the charge of
[2:57:40] God's elect?
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; The seed of God remains in them.
[2:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; Romans, I think it's nine.
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; He says, "Jacob I loved, Esau I hated.
[2:57:53] &gt;&gt; The children not yet being born, neither
[2:57:56] have done any good nor evil.
[2:58:01] that the law of predestination and
[2:58:04] election might stand not of the flesh
[2:58:08] but of the call.
[2:58:16] &gt;&gt; You don't think we have a path forward?
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. We're not
[2:58:21] near as far down the road as we think we
[2:58:24] are.
[2:58:29] We're continually labeling ourselves
[2:58:31] sinners.
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; We're continually walking in doubt of
[2:58:36] ourselves.
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; We let our flesh
[2:58:41] have preeminence over us.
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; And we very rarely
[2:58:48] flee to the prophecy.
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:58:56] Good.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; he put us here
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[2:59:09] The Catholics took that.
[2:59:12] Now, we're talking about your sins being
[2:59:15] remitted,
[2:59:16] your sins
[2:59:19] being totally put in the sea of God,
[2:59:21] forgetfulness to be remembered. no more.
[2:59:24] Your sins not being laid to your charge.
[2:59:27] You know everything you did,
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:59:30] &gt;&gt; But he wants to bring you past that.
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; He wants you to bring you to the place
[2:59:39] where you absolutely know that's not on
[2:59:43] you anymore.
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:59:47] &gt;&gt; Because you'll never gain power
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; over Satan
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; with you packing that baggage.
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:59:59] &gt;&gt; He'll always be able to stand up and
[3:00:02] point to your past
[3:00:04] &gt;&gt; and accuse you.
[3:00:08] But when you know
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; that the God of heaven
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; does not have that in his mind.
[3:00:16] &gt;&gt; He doesn't recall it.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's not how he sees me. When I stand
[3:00:21] there to pray for you,
[3:00:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not packing David McGary.
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; That's not him who's praying. It's what
[3:00:29] he had in his mind.
[3:00:33] I'm just doing what he said to do.
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; But listen what he said. What brings
[3:00:42] the remission of sin in your life?
[3:00:48] What brings it? You don't have to think
[3:00:50] what you did yesterday. He knows what
[3:00:52] you did yesterday. Well, you were yet a
[3:00:54] sinner. He died for you.
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid from him.
[3:01:02] He knows it.
[3:01:06] &gt;&gt; It's why he came down.
[3:01:10] &gt;&gt; Paid the price so you wouldn't.
[3:01:13] But what remits our sin?
[3:01:20] Many of us would say, "Well, Calvary.
[3:01:22] Calvary paid the price for it."
[3:01:29] But if you don't accept it,
[3:01:31] &gt;&gt; right,
[3:01:32] &gt;&gt; he died for everybody.
[3:01:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; Thousands of people in this town got the
[3:01:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[3:01:43] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't given to them.
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[3:01:46] &gt;&gt; To know the mystery of God.
[3:01:50] &gt;&gt; There's anointed ones at the end time
[3:01:52] everywhere.
[3:01:57] Is there differences in the message?
[3:01:59] Fine.
[3:02:01] Nothing. He didn't know.
[3:02:05] &gt;&gt; But the one thing I know,
[3:02:10] he said this,
[3:02:12] the Catholic Church picked that up and
[3:02:16] takes it to their priest. But that's
[3:02:18] carnal.
[3:02:20] Watch.
[3:02:22] It's the spiritual revealed word that
[3:02:26] did it.
[3:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; What remitted your sins?
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; The spiritual revealed word that you
[3:02:37] never did it
[3:02:39] &gt;&gt; in the first place.
[3:02:43] &gt;&gt; That's what remits your sins. You think
[3:02:46] you're going to go out there and redo
[3:02:49] it?
[3:02:50] &gt;&gt; No. Accept the prophecy.
[3:02:54] &gt;&gt; Believe it and walk in it.
[3:02:57] &gt;&gt; That's what gives you power over the
[3:03:00] enemy is what he said.
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; He said the spiritual revealed word is
[3:03:07] what remitted your sins. I read it. He
[3:03:10] said you never did it in the first
[3:03:13] place. You were predestinated for the
[3:03:16] beginning. It's not laid to your charge.
[3:03:18] God don't even remember it. He It's out
[3:03:21] of his throne in the sea of forgiveness.
[3:03:23] You stand perfectly
[3:03:26] &gt;&gt; justified.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; Virtuous pride.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; That revelation
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; is what remits us
[3:03:37] from our sins.
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go into all the world and
[3:03:44] preach the gospel.
[3:03:46] Them that believe shall be saved.
[3:03:50] Them that believe not
[3:03:53] shall be lost.
[3:03:57] If you believe this morning,
[3:04:00] your sins are remitted. They're
[3:04:03] remitted.
[3:04:05] &gt;&gt; But you can choose
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; to retain them.
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; You can choose to pack the baggage
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; of your flesh.
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; But I'm not a child of the flesh.
[3:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the prophecy.
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know how he's going to do it,
[3:04:34] &gt;&gt; but he said he would.
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:37] &gt;&gt; And alls I know
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; is that I stand this morning
[3:04:42] &gt;&gt; as if I never
[3:04:43] &gt;&gt; did it.
[3:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the first place.
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04:52] &gt;&gt; Shalom, if you would bring that message.
[3:04:56] Every miracle,
[3:04:58] every gift in the Bible,
[3:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:02] &gt;&gt; was attached
[3:05:04] to the great commission.
[3:05:08] Go into all the world.
[3:05:12] These signs will follow.
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; It's always attached.
[3:05:19] It's freely given.
[3:05:21] Freely give.
[3:05:25] Our message is far
[3:05:28] beyond.
[3:05:30] And I hope you don't take offense in
[3:05:32] this is far beyond the fulfillment of
[3:05:36] Malachi 4:5,
[3:05:38] Luke 17:30
[3:05:40] and Revelations 10:7.
[3:05:43] It was an exodus into the eternal
[3:05:46] thinking.
[3:05:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; Of almighty God
[3:05:50] where you were
[3:05:53] &gt;&gt; in the beginning.
[3:05:55] You share the message.
[3:05:57] You watch the results.
[3:06:01] You didn't build this place big enough
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; for this gospel.
[3:06:07] [applause]
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; The world's hungering
[3:06:14] for this gospel.
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; That's my message to you.
[3:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; You've never done it in the first place.
[3:06:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. This is my message
[3:06:28] to the church now. You've never done it
[3:06:32] in the first place.
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:06:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you, children.
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; Of the prophecy. [applause]
[3:06:47] [applause]
[3:06:48] [cheering]
[3:06:51] [clears throat]
[3:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful word. Amen.
[3:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say amen to that?
[3:07:01] &gt;&gt; My my. That's the best news I heard all
[3:07:03] day.
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; I never done it in the first place.
[3:07:08] So, God bless you. We're going to
[3:07:10] dedicate this tabernacle and the the
[3:07:13] place and the people and the little
[3:07:17] ministry. Once again,
[3:07:20] um I'm ask brother Ferguson to do that
[3:07:23] as he prepares uh to come.
[3:07:27] And as he does that, I'd like him to uh
[3:07:31] rededicate my family. I'm going to have
[3:07:33] my family come up to the front, Karesa,
[3:07:36] Levi, Aaliyah, my wife, and just to pray
[3:07:40] for us. And brothers can pray as well.
[3:08:29] Let it be a place where we could come
[3:08:31] and worship the Lord. So it's set aside
[3:08:34] like if you said I dedicate this, it's
[3:08:36] set aside for a particular purpose.
[3:08:40] No,
[3:08:45] in the Psalms.
[3:08:47] I'll take just two.
[3:08:51] It's all right. You all can hear. Okay.
[3:08:55] We'll just take just as we go into the
[3:08:58] dedication. Just
[3:09:02] &gt;&gt; this one is all right. This is okay. All
[3:09:05] right. Good.
[3:09:07] All right.
[3:09:13] I'd like for us to
[3:09:20] just one second.
[3:09:28] Yeah.
[3:09:35] We want to take a little scripture that
[3:09:37] I think we all know it by heart
[3:09:40] and to dedicate this house of the Lord.
[3:09:44] This place is a place of worship
[3:09:47] where we are dedicating it for the word
[3:09:49] of the Lord and to the honor and praise
[3:09:51] and glory of God. So we want to look at
[3:09:53] Psalm 122
[3:09:57] and we will read just one verse out of
[3:09:59] this.
[3:10:01] I was glad. [clears throat] I was glad
[3:10:04] when they let's let's read it together.
[3:10:07] I was glad when they said unto me, let
[3:10:11] us go into the house of the Lord.
[3:10:16] [clears throat] Then we'll take another
[3:10:18] from the psalm
[3:10:20] today. Some people think it's sad. It's
[3:10:22] sad when you tell them come into the
[3:10:25] house of the Lord. You've met people
[3:10:28] George Church that when you say come to
[3:10:30] the house of the Lord, they're sad to
[3:10:32] hear that. But we're glad when they said
[3:10:35] unto us,
[3:10:37] &gt;&gt; how many is glad when they
[3:10:38] &gt;&gt; to know that you could come into the
[3:10:40] house of the Lord? Let's lift our hands
[3:10:42] and give him praise for it.
[3:10:45] &gt;&gt; Then we will read. Now, I'm not going to
[3:10:47] preach, brother David. The Lord used
[3:10:49] him. I'm just going to read another
[3:10:52] psalm here, another scripture here just
[3:10:54] before we do the dedicational prayer.
[3:10:58] We will read here Psalm 133. It's a very
[3:11:04] short psalm, just three verses. We will
[3:11:07] read that and then we will go into the
[3:11:09] dedicational prayer.
[3:11:12] Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
[3:11:17] for brethren to dwell together in unity.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a what a scripture. Amen.
[3:11:24] &gt;&gt; What a scripture.
[3:11:27] It is like the precious ointment upon
[3:11:29] the head that ran down upon the beard
[3:11:33] even Aaron's beard that went down to the
[3:11:35] skirts of his garments as the dew of
[3:11:39] Herman and as the Judith descended upon
[3:11:42] the mountain of Zion for there the Lord
[3:11:45] commanded the blessing even life forever
[3:11:48] more. So, as you see, brethren, as we
[3:11:51] get together here in the house of the
[3:11:53] Lord, it was glad for us when he said,
[3:11:55] "Let us come into the house of the
[3:11:57] Lord." We come into the house of the
[3:11:59] Lord in the spirit of unity.
[3:12:02] Now, I
[3:12:04] I'd like to for us to sing a little song
[3:12:09] if we could just as a dedicational song
[3:12:12] and we will sing it if the musicians and
[3:12:15] our song leader will come. Amazing
[3:12:18] grace. Amazing grace. We will sing that
[3:12:21] and [music] then right after I would
[3:12:23] like for the ministers to come. If all
[3:12:25] the ministers could come to the platform
[3:12:27] [music]
[3:12:28] and then we will all join hands together
[3:12:30] to dedicate. Now first Israel wants to
[3:12:33] dedicate. You want me to do the
[3:12:34] dedication of the family or the church
[3:12:36] first? The family. Okay. Let's sing
[3:12:38] Amazing Grace and then we will [music]
[3:12:39] have the dedication of Israel and Sharon
[3:12:44] and the family. [music]
[3:12:46] could you come up
[3:12:48] &gt;&gt; and after we sing this you overcome
[3:12:50] [music] let's sing that together amen
[3:12:55] [singing]
[3:13:05] like [singing] me
[3:13:11] &gt;&gt; I once
[3:13:13] was lost
[3:13:16] Oh, but now
[3:13:20] I'm found.
[3:13:22] &gt;&gt; I was blind, [singing]
[3:13:25] but now
[3:13:28] I [music] see.
[3:13:34] It was grace
[3:13:37] that [singing and music] taught
[3:13:40] my heart
[3:13:43] to fear.
[3:13:46] And grace
[3:13:49] my [singing] fears
[3:13:52] really.
[3:13:56] [singing]
[3:13:57] How precious
[3:14:00] [music]
[3:14:01] did
[3:14:03] that [singing]
[3:14:04] grace
[3:14:06] appear
[3:14:09] beyond [singing]
[3:14:11] [music]
[3:14:11] our first.
[3:14:15] [singing]
[3:14:20] I'd like for the ministers to come to
[3:14:22] the platform at this time to brother
[3:14:25] David. Um that all you ministers just
[3:14:28] get a place on [music] the platform.
[3:14:30] We'll all come together for the
[3:14:31] dedication of the church of the building
[3:14:35] and we want to I want you all to join
[3:14:38] your faith with me, your heart with me
[3:14:40] and we will all pray together for Israel
[3:14:43] and Sharon and for this family. We want
[3:14:46] to dedicate it. I'll just move this
[3:14:47] platform a little bit back.
[3:14:50] If we could take it back a little bit.
[3:14:53] Thank you.
[3:14:57] Now, a few ministers could just stand
[3:14:59] with me. [clears throat] And Sharon,
[3:15:02] could you come? Uh, Karisha, could you
[3:15:05] come? Levi and Aaliyah. We will just
[3:15:09] have them come right here.
[3:15:12] Come, Levi, come. Um, I'm going to do a
[3:15:16] little funny thing. I'm going to put
[3:15:18] Sharon to the end here. I don't want you
[3:15:21] you could just slip right in there. Your
[3:15:24] dad Levi. Sharon, I want you to go to
[3:15:26] the end. Levi, you just stand right
[3:15:28] here. And Lee, you just stand right
[3:15:30] here. Okay. Excuse me. See, it makes it
[3:15:33] a
[3:15:35] Okay, [laughter]
[3:15:36] excuse me if you see me doing this. It's
[3:15:39] true that the Lord in his love and mercy
[3:15:42] brought Israel and Sharon together.
[3:15:45] And during the years I I remember when
[3:15:48] Israel spoke to me about Sharon. I told
[3:15:50] him Sharon was my is my first daughter
[3:15:53] and she was always a daddy's girl.
[3:15:56] &gt;&gt; And she loved mommy. She loved mommy but
[3:15:58] just a little you know how it is you
[3:16:00] [laughter] know
[3:16:02] and someone said to me when they got
[3:16:05] married said would you cry? And I said
[3:16:08] well am I going to cry when you know
[3:16:11] when when they get married? Because it
[3:16:13] was hard for me because I was Sharon's
[3:16:14] pastor. I was her father and I was also
[3:16:17] her boss. She worked for me. She worked
[3:16:20] at Voice of God office. So poor Sharon.
[3:16:22] That was hard on her. She had she had to
[3:16:24] have me as a dad, her pastor, and also
[3:16:29] her boss. So that was three persons in
[3:16:32] one to her. So it was kind of when I had
[3:16:36] to take her hand and trick her over to
[3:16:40] Israel's headship.
[3:16:42] &gt;&gt; It was really something for me in
[3:16:43] Sacramento. I didn't cry natural tears
[3:16:46] to my eyes, but in my heart I cried to
[3:16:50] see Sharon go in and I know that, you
[3:16:52] know, she'd go for the best. And I
[3:16:54] really am happy to see what the Lord did
[3:16:56] because in the call of the ministry when
[3:16:59] God calls a man, he calls his wife also.
[3:17:02] And a lot of people don't realize what a
[3:17:04] pastor's wife has to go through. And
[3:17:06] they have to go through a lot. Amen. And
[3:17:08] it was hard sometimes for them. And
[3:17:10] Sharon growing up and I remember Sharon
[3:17:12] telling me, she says, "Daddy, I will not
[3:17:14] be the p the the wife of a of a a pastor
[3:17:20] because I don't want she didn't want it.
[3:17:22] She did not want it. She did not want it
[3:17:24] to be because she saw all what they had
[3:17:27] to go through as little girls. I'll be
[3:17:29] gone for weeks in the mission fields in
[3:17:30] Africa. When we were building the work
[3:17:32] in Africa, I had to go and it was hard
[3:17:34] on them. But it's through it all. I
[3:17:37] could certainly thank the Lord because
[3:17:39] he fitted her. He he he shaped Sharon
[3:17:43] for this role. Amen. And I'm certainly
[3:17:45] happy to see what he did.
[3:17:47] &gt;&gt; And now I want to just come Sharon a
[3:17:50] little closer. I'll lay my hands and you
[3:17:52] all just lay hands on each other.
[3:17:55] Just hold. Yes. Just just yes, that's
[3:17:58] correct. Just hold hands with each other
[3:18:00] and Lord God of heaven,
[3:18:05] you've as our brother spoke this
[3:18:07] morning, you predestinated things. You
[3:18:11] brought things in ways that we could
[3:18:14] never understand.
[3:18:16] Our minds are too limited as human
[3:18:18] beings to be able to figure it all out.
[3:18:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But somehow the other you
[3:18:23] know exactly how to put the pieces
[3:18:25] together in your divine plan. And
[3:18:29] knowing Lord that you were you were
[3:18:31] going to take brother Doug Mchuse that
[3:18:34] was here and brother Perry knowing that
[3:18:36] there had to be others to follow and to
[3:18:38] keep the light burning in the city of
[3:18:40] Tucson where you sent brother Brandon to
[3:18:42] this place for purpose for many purposes
[3:18:45] Lord. And father, as you have Israel
[3:18:48] here and I remember Lord when he was
[3:18:51] moving to Tucson, I I was in doubts in
[3:18:54] my mind. I wondered what would happen.
[3:18:56] Listen, I we we weren't sure. But father
[3:18:59] in heaven, even if we did not
[3:19:01] understand, you knew exactly what you
[3:19:04] were doing. This was part of your plan.
[3:19:07] This is part of what you wanted to
[3:19:09] achieve. And Lord God, I as in my hands
[3:19:13] in Israel and he's like my son and
[3:19:16] Sharon my daughter and the love that
[3:19:18] you've placed in our hearts for each
[3:19:20] other and not only a love but a spirit
[3:19:23] of understanding that you've placed
[3:19:25] between us Lord and I thank you for it
[3:19:28] and it is something that you could bless
[3:19:29] us. You said what God has joined
[3:19:32] together let no man put us under. and
[3:19:34] you could bless us with a spirit of love
[3:19:36] and understanding that we could
[3:19:38] understand each other, understand our
[3:19:40] motives, our objectives, why we do
[3:19:43] certain things, why we don't do certain
[3:19:45] things. And oh God of heaven, because we
[3:19:47] know that we are under one leadership,
[3:19:49] and that is you. And Lord, from this
[3:19:52] union, you've given Karisha, you've
[3:19:54] given Levi, you've given Ayah, and oh
[3:19:57] God, how happy am I for my grandchildren
[3:20:00] here, Father. I pray that your mighty
[3:20:04] spirit your hand will be upon them to
[3:20:06] help Karishia to help Levi to help
[3:20:10] Aaliyah. Lord, oh God, if there is a
[3:20:12] tomorrow, they will be the children of
[3:20:15] tomorrow to continue to be a light to
[3:20:18] this message, an example and a witness
[3:20:20] to the things that has been committed
[3:20:23] into our hands. And Lord, it is such a
[3:20:26] joy for us to see our children and our
[3:20:29] grandchildren and coming Lord all down
[3:20:32] the and we know see them holding to you
[3:20:34] and staying with your word and oh God
[3:20:37] they can't do it without your help. I
[3:20:40] just pray that the Holy Spirit will keep
[3:20:42] this family united together in a spirit
[3:20:45] of love and understanding. Lord, we love
[3:20:48] you. We thank you. And I commit them now
[3:20:50] into your hands. not just praying for
[3:20:53] Israel and his family, but for the
[3:20:55] ministry that you've committed in his
[3:20:56] hands. And to know that his family is
[3:20:59] also a part of that ministry. We give
[3:21:02] you honor. We give you thanks. We
[3:21:05] glorify you for everything knowing that
[3:21:07] all the praise and the glory and the
[3:21:10] honor and the trust and the confidence
[3:21:13] is all towards you, Lord. And today in
[3:21:16] the presence of this whole congregation
[3:21:18] and in the ministers that are all here
[3:21:20] that have united their hearts with us in
[3:21:22] the presence of the Holy Spirit and in
[3:21:24] the presence of the angels of God that
[3:21:26] are here Lord God of heaven. We pray
[3:21:30] Lord God and under the authority of your
[3:21:32] word. We command a blessing upon our

[3:21:43] thanks in Jesus precious holy wonderful
[3:21:47] name.

[3:22:03] Sure.
[3:22:20] Come on up.
[3:22:23] You minister just just come right up on
[3:22:24] the platform if you could find a little
[3:22:26] spot on the platform. There's room over
[3:22:28] here.
[3:22:30] Just come right on up. All you brothers,
[3:22:32] I'm so happy to see brother Fabi here.
[3:22:35] Brother Fab, I wish I could speak Jews
[3:22:37] to be [laughter]
[3:22:40] Oh
[3:22:42] my.
[3:22:44] &gt;&gt; We
[3:22:46] We would
[3:22:50] Now I'd like for the whole congregation
[3:22:52] to stand at this time.
[3:22:54] &gt;&gt; All of us to stand.
[3:22:57] Now we have put all our efforts into the
[3:23:00] building. We believe that the Holy
[3:23:02] Spirit has guided you. Now we want to do
[3:23:06] this today. We want to dedicate this
[3:23:08] sanctuary as a place of prayer as a
[3:23:11] place where the Holy You can come and be
[3:23:13] blessed where you can receive
[3:23:15] deliverance. We dedicating it. We
[3:23:18] setting aside for that purpose. And as
[3:23:21] we dedicate it, we dedicate our lives
[3:23:23] with it. So it's not just the building
[3:23:25] we are dedicating because the the real
[3:23:26] the sanctuary is not really the
[3:23:28] physical, you know, the brick and stuff.
[3:23:30] It's really you. So you as we read it,
[3:23:33] it was glad. I was glad when they said
[3:23:35] unto me, come into the house of the Lord
[3:23:37] and to see brethren here in the spirit
[3:23:39] of unity. God bless you all. Let us bow
[3:23:42] our heads.
[3:23:44] Father,
[3:23:47] &gt;&gt; father,
[3:23:48] &gt;&gt; here are all the brothers.
[3:23:51] &gt;&gt; And your prophet told us that when your
[3:23:53] anointing comes,
[3:23:55] when your spirit comes,
[3:23:58] it welcomes the people, it's a welcoming
[3:24:02] feeling. And father, as we gather here
[3:24:05] and knowing that you are here, knowing
[3:24:09] that your presence is here with us, uh
[3:24:12] Lord, we we don't have to just say that
[3:24:16] brother Israel welcome us. We don't have
[3:24:19] to say that the church members welcome
[3:24:22] us. We know in our hearts that the Holy
[3:24:25] Spirit also welcomes us here in this
[3:24:29] building, in this meeting. And father,
[3:24:32] as we bow our heads to give you honor
[3:24:36] that you made it possible to purchase
[3:24:39] for this group of believers here to
[3:24:41] purchase this building. There's much
[3:24:44] prayer went into it, much hope, much
[3:24:47] faith, much searching, praying. Oh God
[3:24:52] of heaven, the sacrifices, the people
[3:24:54] that have contributed financially,
[3:24:56] giving whatever they could to help. Oh
[3:24:58] God of heaven, how we honor you for
[3:25:01] them. And then we pray that the
[3:25:03] anointing as you came down in the
[3:25:05] tabernacle of Solomon, oh God of heaven,
[3:25:08] and the ministers are had the priests
[3:25:11] can hardly minister. And as we see
[3:25:13] brother David this morning standing
[3:25:15] there ministering having a hard time to
[3:25:18] even stop Lord because of the presence
[3:25:21] and the anointing of your presence Lord
[3:25:24] how we honor you as you bring us
[3:25:27] together in a spirit of unity that we
[3:25:30] could understand the motives and the
[3:25:32] objectives of each other that we could
[3:25:34] Lord say that we all have the same
[3:25:36] motive is to glorify you to praise you
[3:25:40] to honor you and Oh God of heaven,
[3:25:43] knowing that you are here, we thank you
[3:25:46] as we dedicate this building and every
[3:25:49] one of us dedicate our entire lives and
[3:25:53] all that we are to you. And we thank you
[3:25:58] in the lovely name of the Lord and Jesus
[3:26:02] Christ. Amen.
[3:26:07] [applause]
[3:26:07] &gt;&gt; We could sing that chorus.

[3:26:18] song the guy here. And that song leader
