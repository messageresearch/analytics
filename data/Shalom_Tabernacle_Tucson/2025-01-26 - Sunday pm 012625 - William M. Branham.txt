to this weather I'm not it's just about kill me Leo one of my recording boys sick old Vol je the same way Billy the same way be the same way so oh this weather I believe I'd have to come down and stay uh sometime in the summertime to uh or winter time to get used to it for summer but I imagine if you come up to my house when it's about 28 below zero you PR want to stay in the house that's when we all want to go R about 28 below zero it's just what part of the country we get customed to and sometimes a different part Mr Mo believe was tell me today that David in the army camp over somewhere in Texas and him being used to this weather here he said he got so sick last year he couldn't even drive his car home Hardy the weather being so hot and it may seem like it's awful nice and cool to you all but you're the US well there's one thing it's a good time to preach repentance isn't when you got we like that es so we're happy tonight to know that we're on the grounds of the Forgiveness of our sins and on the grounds of Eternal salvation looking for the coming of the Lord Jesus so happy to know that someday he'll be here and all the troubles will be over that's right you see in Chicago after even all their salt vaccines and everything the cases of PO on the rageed to my my worst It Ever Was and seems like about time one thing gets started common while another thing starts up and they give some sort of medicine for something and looks like it'll take care of that in a few years here turns up and gives a great thing that nearly kills a patient man so only thing we can hope for is the coming of the Lord that's when all troubles to be over they looking back over my shoulder at sister Anna I thought hard all right I want a frog in my throat like he's playing the piano and letting down a little bit and Don standing back he left I think today didn't for overseas and uh down South America and so forth and I know how she feels I just imagine I know from my wife phone will ring you know when I'm home I she'll I'll answer the phone say brother BR there yes I get a hold of pH somebody say brother br will you come just for two nights I said I'd like to brother but I just see something just I'm going to [Music] say so I know feel but there's one good thing I read a little Talmer girl here her husband left also yesterday or somewhere way away so bless these young women and just remember this Jesus said that he will not forsake his father his mother wife daughter children and whatever it is and clean to me is not worthy of to be my disciples right so Peter said we have taken all our wives our children our homes to allity what shall we receive in the Kingdom he said verely verely I say unto you that you'll set on 12 Thrones Jud in the 12 times of it oh my now you know I don't want to do that and really from the bottom of my heart I don't want nothing great classical you know what I want I just want to look at it I I just want to see old colored man here's some time ago he got saved at an old camp meeting and so he went back nor where the old colored folks down in the South used to go around have a himn singings at night so next morning he was telling all the slaves that he was free yeah so the boss heard him say that so he said what's this sandle you said you just for said come on over the office I'll talk to you a while they went over to the office and he said Sam I heard you said that you was free he said you know you're my slave he said yes I but said last night the Lord Jesus Set Me Free from the penalty of sin and death he said I'm free B the Lord save me he said you really mean that he said yes I do and he said what if you was a slave what would you do said I'd spend the rest of my time telling my bre said all right you go with me down to the court this morning I'm going to sign the ticket Proclamation I'm going to set you free to preach the gospel to your bre after he preached for many years his death come to him he was laying sick to die and a lot of his white breth come in to look at him so they looked at him and he was laying like he's in a coma after a while he woke up looked around seen them all said haven't I went over yet he said I I was dreaming or something I just got in the door they said to me nowan come on I want you to put on your robe and your Crown said don't talk to me about robes and crowns just let me stand and look at him a thousand years I think that's just about the way we all feel is it we don't want no crowns no no great things the only thing I want to do is just look at him I just look at his face that would pay me forever eff just to look up on him and see so I I'm trusting believing hoping trying my best that someday I'll get to see and I always thought how I would just love to just kneel down at the at his feet and kind Patty do Patty feet in this Wonder this one same feet that woman washed with her tears and wiping with the hairs of her head how how I'd feel just to stand there and Pat those feet a little bit I believe I'd preach a 100 years get but you that's going spend a lifetime now being it's warm tonight and we don't this beginning of the week now and tomorrow night if there is someone here to be prayed for or we'll pray for the sick tomorrow night the Lord with us and now I don't blame the people not coming our church Vis my how hot and so and Romans the 8th chapter and the first verse we want to consider this just for a little while Romans 8 and 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen now our heavenly father we pray now that you will get our minds centered on the spirit of God and may He lead us not knowing what to say but thou will provide the words and I pray that you'll lead us to a a great meeting Lord where the seat of God will fall deep into the heart of every person the unsaved be saved and The Sinner backslider be called back to God again and the sick be healed for this we ask in Christ's name amen led by the spirit of God do you believe in man of God are led by the spirit of God that's right now Paul speaking here to the Romans said there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus now that walk not after if you're in Christ Jesus and you walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now you know it's a it's a danger thing when we go to Fain that many times the Christians who are filled with the holy spirit will still walk after the flesh did you know that they'll do it and then the Holy Spirit gets away from them as we've been saying I you see people sometimes someone rais up and speak in tongues which will be God and maybe someone say glory to God I can do that too that's flesh see you have to be led by the spirit Lord and I was just telling the other day while brother Jack and I were out visiting a a Lutheran Seminary and they were asking about these Divine gifts I told them how I did it at my church I see it many times that I feel that Full Gospel people who believe in those gifts not only that but there's many Baptist churches and many of them speak with tongues certainly Charles Fuller has speaking in tongues at Long Beach but he an interpretation spoke up on the radio just recently tell them about how they spoke in Tong interpreted said but if there was no interpreter what was the flesh but said if anyone spoke they all kept real quiet so and see what the interpretation is I here's the way we did it at home when I received the Holy Spirit seeing these things was for the church we found if somebody spoke in tongues then if there was no interpreter we had them to keep hold their feet that's right they're not supposed to speak in public like that but then when they become an interpreter some one could interpret how we didn't want just a bunch of foolishness we had to be genuine so we had all those people to meet all the gifted people those who had Revelations those who had the word of Prophecy and those who had the interpretation and speaking of tongues and they gathered at the church about an hour before the church ever started they come in for their own Ministry and they set in the church kept quiet and the Lord speak a message now before that message could be received and give to the church there had to be three there with the spirit of discernment and two of that three had to witness it was of God if it was they never even counted it at all but now it couldn't be according to scripture because God told us not use vain repetition it had to be some message directed to some person in the church or it wasn't received then say for instance like this somebody raise up and say thus sayth the Lord tonight at the service there will be a lady coming in with her bandage around her head she was in an automobile accent 5 years ago and she can't be healed and they bring her from a certain place have brothers so and so as soon as she comes in they'll be coming from Michigan to lay his hands up on her for thus sayth the Lord she's going to be healed now everybody kept quiet after a while one of them with the spirit of ger say I believe that was the Lord another now well remember your words of State other say I believe it was of the Lord all right it's put out that's put on my desk I'm in the room praying all the time all right then the next thing you know somebody spok in tongues and give a message said thus sayth the Lord have brother Henry Jones to move away from the place where he's at because there some large trees stand there for thus sayith the Lord tomorrow afternoon by 2:00 there's coming a hurricane go blow all those trees down having to be out of the way thus sayith the Lord it had to be to someone a message to the church now theny one of the interpreters or one of the man with the discernment said I believe it's of the Lord they say I believe it's of the lord well if they do that then they put it down put it on the desk and when I come out just before the service started I read these messages off to the church that already had their name signed for the discernment to say that they was from the Lord Brother Henry Jones got away as quick as he could we watched for the woman if she didn't come or the storm didn't come then I made him everyone get to the Altar and get that evil spirit away from him right not right God don't speak lies he tells the truth God tells the truth so that's what I found amongst the people so much of it here in California not long ago I was fixing to make an alar call and a lady raised up and began speaking in Tong just broke the alar called the pie now I don't say that but the well then some woman got way back over there and give some kind of a sign all of you be ready the Lord to coming so forth we know that that wasn't nothing directed so then I never s was my meting so when the next couple days after that she met Billy Paul out there she said tell your daddy get ready when he goes to give his life story call I've got another message I got to give now that won't work now that's flesh I don't condemn the person but I condemn the the way they're using the gifts of God if they're used correctly they're the most marvelous things there is but if you don't use them right it'll bring a disgrace to the church so we must be led of the spirit and when we're LED of of the spirit then God makes everything work just exactly in harmony now if they give this message and I give it out and the lady comes in here she is everybody's wondering where she's at every while here she comes in pack her in on a stretcher I know exactly what to do the Holy Spirit done spoke go lay hands on her she's going to be healed that's exactly what happens and the next thing next day brother Henry Jones gets away from those big trees or waiting the railroad track where they going to have a wreck or he doesn't go down to this corner for a certain thing or whatever it is and the next thing we see that happen perfectly that way then we say thank you Lord Jesus for warning us we love you because you're with us and you're showing your signs and wonders and we love you and we adore you and we just pour out to you the whole Adoration of our heart for being so good to us see now if those gifts are used right they're to edify the church and you let one come in un learn and watch and see what happens that way you'll find out he Shivers run up his back and he get right with God but when they're just misconstrued and show out if that anyway I believe there are gifts but they don't know how to use them that's what we need is a teaching on how to use the gifts of God that's the reason they begin to dwindle out because the people don't use them rightly and we must do that Paul said he set the church in order telling just how and how to do it we try to put our church just exactly that way course and now since I've left wife it's been there's a Methodist Pastor there now was a Baptist just before me and or right after me brother now a Methodist brother has it and they don't teach those things they just let go ahead and preach the gospel and make all call go home but what the church needs tonight is know how to control these gifts see for evil spirits can come in and speak just the same as good spirits can speak you know that and you must have the spirit of discernment to know that they had it in the Bible time why if they didn't do it then why did Paul say Let One judge and the people judge and so forth those Gifts of Prophecy everything is supposed to be correctly put in order for Satan can imitate every gift that God's got every gift he can imitate it and you must know the right and wrong and by its fruits you know it watch where it comes to pass and whether it's truth or not and that's what you know the spirit now but sons of God we are led by the spirit of God there is therefore now no condemnation you don't have to worry about those things to those that are in Christ Jesus B walk not after the flesh say oh Hallelujah I a't speaking T glory to God I can do this no no that's wrong attitude that's the wrong attitude that's right don't do that see but here's what it is to those no condemnation to them that are in Christ that want not as the flesh but as the spirit now the next thing is how do you get into these spiritual gifts the Bible said by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and that body is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ now this is a great thing for a ree Baptist preacher to say but I believe there's one Lord one baptism and and one calling and I believe that one baptism is not water I believe it's Holy Spirit baptism that we're baptized into the body of Christ not by water but by Spirit 1 Corinthians 12 and we are Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God after they've been baptized into the body of Believers oh how marvelous how sin opened the heart of the Lord Jesus and given us a issue of blood coming forth from him and through the life in that blood we go back by Holy Ghost baptism into the body of Christ the Lord oh my that make you forget the hot weather notice and while you're in that body you are just as free from condemnation as he is Lord you'll never have to stand any judgments God calls judgments to be struck upon his body and if you're in him God cannot judge you he's already judged you when he judged Christ amen and you can't be under judgment no more Christ took your judgment and when you're baptized into that body of Christ you are free from God's judgment the wrath of God will pass over you that's why he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you that's right that was the sacrificial lamb the blood was in the shape of the cross on the Lin and the door poost and was a sign that death can not come to that house and when death tries to strike us that separation from God then the blood is applied by the Lord Jesus Christ and the death cannot take it no sir for we are free then we are in Christ and led by the spirit of Christ L many man and nearly all man I say all man that's ever mounted to very much in this life has been man and women who have been led to do the gallent things they've done by the spirit of God I think tonight one of the greatest generals that America has ever had with Stonewall Jackson I believe there's never been a general like him since Joshua why was he done that he was a gallant man he was a man of prayer he he closed up everything even make all these generals and everything don't even eat breakfast or nothing and lay on their face and seek God yes sir General Grant um I'm Stonewall Jackson I'm thinking him instead of Grant General Grant was a drunk alcoholic but Stonewall Jackson was a Christian Christian gentleman and he loved the Book of Joshua and he wanted to be like Joshua and God gave him the desires of his heart and one day he was asked why is it Mr Jackson that you can stand in such opposition so many man against you and you take a little handful and stand he's a very timid sort of a fell little sharp fell kind of blueeyed and dark hair he kicked his boots on the Dust and he said I never put a glass of water to my mouth without thanking almighty God that's where it comes from right there where the secret lays trusting God being led by the spirit of God God speaks to man man hears his voice Noah in the early beginning at the end of Luan destruction when he was a man who feared God a farmer lived out on the farms and God spoke to him one day and he was led by the spirit of God to build an ark for the saving of his household and now God has spoke to Noah is the same God that speaks tonight and he speaks to Noah to make a way for the saving of his household he speaks to every man and the Way's already been made for the saving of your household the Lord Jesus Christ is vicarious suffering and death at Calvary and how that Noah now there was no sign of rain never had rained out of the heavens it always God watered through the Earth up through the streams irrigation life never rained out of the heavens but God told Noah that his judgments was coming yeah and he said as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man your judgment is bound to Strife for man had continually to get Evil all the thoughts was evil they are all kinds of devices it's like we got today really a smarter people than we are today they built the Pyramid and the Sphinx and many of those things there that our Modern Machinery couldn't touch we couldn't no long us touch it they must have had a control of atom power gasoline power electrical power would never lift those Boulders and build such as the pyramid they weigh hundreds of tons and Ste away in the air about a city block High mostly and how do they ever get him up there that's the Myster and so perfect Masons till a razor blade couldn't go between them hone down his Masterpiece his Mastermind and they got so smart and so shrew and the Bible said they become workers of wood workers of brass a great day of uh science and they got so smart till they figured they just outsmarted God and didn't need him any longer and then God not willing that any should perish talk to a man out in a field one day Noah and told him to erect an ark to protect him from the judgments God let him to do it and Noah R away took his old crude tools and so forth and begin to build away on the ark and as he built away and God told him how to fix it I've often wondered that type of wood that he said to build it out of what kind of wood was that to be a cheddam wood I wondered what kind that was and reading up on it once I find out that it was a b goer wood is what he said to build it out of goer wood and uh the reading up on this goer wood it was the most lightest wood that there is in the world like bossom just real light and if you'd put that in the water it would sink immediately if you had water log and sink right down and then when we find out that God told him to pitch it on the inside and out and how they pitched it they tuck and beat the rosin out of another tree and Bor it and poured into these pores that was so loose and emptied up and that rosm filled up the pores and tasted it over so hard till it be as hard as steel is now what a beautiful type of the church today it's all empted out the things of the world is gone the heart's all empted up and God beat one man of Our Kind Christ and he stood our judgment and by the blood of the Lord Jesus to the Holy Ghost he pours it in it fills every Tab and every place where the world has been Ed out the Holy Ghost fills it up and chases it and seals it amen until that day the fiery judgments of God brother sisters so many people laugh about the baptism of the holy spirit it's the only thing that will save you not another thing God has no other way provided but for men and women to be filled with the Holy Spirit and led by the Holy Spirit correctly thank God God get his church all cased up you remember that pitch that they put in that rosin that was on the inside and outside of that ship soaked that thing to it made it just as tight as it could be and it kept out the Judgment hallelujah amen oh my the water was God's judgment right and the only thing that kept it out was the pitch that's right and the only way that we're going to escape the wrath and Damnation of God's judgment is to empty up ourselves and let the Holy Spirit chug us so fool of the baptism of the spirit and that day remember the very thing that they laughed at Noah making pouring pitch into it the very thing that they laughed that but the very thing that God led him to do they laughed at it and the very thing that spirit filled man and women are led to do today the world last C of nonsense but it was was the only thing Hallelujah that's right it was the only thingl that separated Noah from judgment the blood of Christ to the Holy Ghost is the only thing that will separate the church from the world denominations and barriers and so forth and education will never do it it'll take the baptism of the holy spirit in our heart has poured itself out before God and EMP us God has has filled up that person then they are led by the Holy Ghost amen I like that now he's made a preparation for us he beat the life out of Christ sin did it at the cross and that life that was beat out of a man that lived and eat like you and I do is poured into us when we're empted up and made life did you ever get down and pray until he come to a place do you felt like is walking on cloud hallu that's when you're getting light the Bible said in Hebrews the 11th chapter the 12th chapter seeing that we are Compass about such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight empty up Hallelujah and the sin that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race the set before us looking to the author and finisher of our faith the Lord Jesus think of it how God has made a way and beating from his body he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity look at the Life coming out of him you took the tree and laid it down and would beat it and when they beat it the r would fly out of it and they cut that same Ross and they come out of one tree and poured it into this one to make an atoma make a separation of something that would float and the only way that no knew to do it it could not be scientifically proved but Noah was led by God to do it that's the way men and women are today that's born again the spirit of God is led by the spirit of God to live like Christians and act like Christian and believe in the Full Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallu it's a leading it's all nonsense to the unbeliever I can prove to you tonight by the Bible that the church of the Living God is built upon spiritual revealed truth when Cain and Abel was in the Garden of Eden to begin with it te was just as religious as Abel was but who told Abel to TU a lamb who told Cain and talk a ni something that catch the eye of God and Cain worshiped just the same as Abel worship Cain made an offering as same as Abel did came was just as sincere as Abel of so sincerely don't save you God has a way a program you got to walk into that and King come and worship if God only requires a man to join Church bow at the altar and worship God and give him his his tent to the church or or whatever it is and all the good deeds and things he could do would testify for him in glory then God would be unjust to condemn King but able not by works not by building some great organization but doing something else making great churches and flowerly alers and flowerly speeches but somehow he was led by the spirit of God and he goes over he gets a little lamb and wraps a piece of Great Vine around his neck and offered him on the Altar and died on the same altar his lamb died on that's a revelation every man that comes to God and free from the judgments has got to die on the same altar the lamb did empty up everything of self that God might pour in the Holy Spirit right notice Jesus come down off the mount one day this is over the New Testament coming down off of them m one day he saw some people and he was talking to them and he asked them he said who does man say I the son of man am some said you're Moses the Elias and the prophet and so forth he said but who do you say that I am yeah I don't care what someone else says what's your personal opinion of me Peter being led by the Holy Spirit not taking what somebody else said he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God listen at him he turns around and said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah or by Jonah far flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learned this out of a book you never learned this out of a seminary you wasn't taught this in some church Papa and Mama never told you this some preacher didn't tell you this all is good as it may be but that's not it yet he said My Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and you've been LED in other words so many words you've been led to make this confession and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it upon spiritual revealed truth how the Living God so if many Full Gospel Doctrine seems hard to you just get down and pray till the Holy Ghost gets in you lead you to the P I'm here if you just get down to the Fountain empty up so God can fill you up led by the spirit Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God Abraham the old patriarch 75 years old Sarah 65 God met him one day down in the valley of the Shire there city of and he said Abraham I'm going to bless you and I'm going to give you a son B Sarah so out order to do this if you stay around all this unbelief around here you'll get the doub but I want you to separate yourself usually if a man's going to be a believer he's got to separate himself from his worly friend all the the people yoke yourself out up amongst unbelievers they'll only call you back into the world again environment has a lot to do with it do you know that your environment sure is is brother bar you say you put a hen egg under a puppy and time down it would hatch the eggs the puppy would hatch out the chicken man see it's because the puppy keeps the egg warm and it's the environment that counts and when you a Christian you associate with Christians and go with Christians and be a Christian you got to have the right kind of an environment around you you get out in the pool rooms and dance halls and shind digs and everything else and call yourself a Christian the first thing you know you will be believing it's all right to do it that's what's matter the Pentecostal Char that's what's matter all the Pentecostal women cutting their hair and putting makeup on and and man doing the way they're doing is because begin to associate you ought to bring yourselves together forsaking not to assemble yourselves together as you see the time coming and you lay down the bar that's the reason you don't hear the oldfashioned Backwoods hell bar Brin Stone preached anymore men are scared to preach it preachers are say scared to say so because their wives act the same way and they're afraid to say it here not long ago a certain man taking me out I had a man working for me driving a truck a man smoked a good man but he smoked he didn't profess to be a Christian but he's a good man I had him as a hand this man said we can't do this we're Full Gospel people that would absolutely upset our people to know that you had a man with you that smoked cigarett I said then I'll lay him off get somebody else said all right I said I tried two a three on it and you can't put no confidence when you're ready to go they've gone somewhere else and I said that's reason I put him on said well we are full gospel people it'll be a stumbling about before us this Minister said I said all right then I'll just tell a man the good way and lay him off I did the very next meeting we went to I went down to a big tent three four five times this size I guess field up full of people I walked up on the platform with this Minister and he said uh this is the state superintendent what it is General overseer of the certain big denominational church I said how do you do sir and I shook his hand he said Mr brandom I want you to meet my wife and there she stood there I never seen such a looking thing in my life she had her hair all cut real short on a boy Bob and curled up on the outside she had makeup so thick on her mouth and a dress that she could have poured in I never seen such an outfit in mine and there she was standing there and big long fingernails out like that looks like she'd been bleeding in her fingers I never seen such a looking thing in my life and I said is your wife a Christian he saidoh yeah she's a saint I said she looks to me like she's a Han I said from the way she all that blue and stuff under her eyes and what's the matter you got away from the old Landmark you got away from the Bible you got away from leading of the Holy Ghost and went out like the rest of them did that's exactly what's the matter Hallelujah are you think that preacher could have preached against it the other ministers with me not the one that told me this but the other man another man was with me which is his brother-in-law his wife jumped all over when we went up to an's hotel to grow up there to eat she said listen brother random you will ruin your ministry I said I want to ask you something lady when I my ministry will be ruined by preaching the gospel Let It Be rued that's what I said about an old colored man one time they said now look here s boy want to tell you you don't you preach that old hell fire and brimstone and baptism the Holy Ghost said it'll sure room your church if you do it he said listen boss any church is ever ruined by preaching hell far Brimstone and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you let me know where that church is won't you boss so I tell you what I want to do I want to climb up on the outside and lay my big black hand up on his Tower and say blessed is the dead that die in the that's righty you never afay go to hurt anything you might hurt sin but you'll never hurt righteousness by preaching righteousness led by the Holy Spirit Sons and Daughters of God led by the spirit of God Abraham didn't care what anybody else said he said now you separate yourself so he got his little group together in his wife and went out not knowing where he was going why you care where you're going just keep going brother Ram well where does it lead you just keep on walking the Lord he was led by the spirit of God and man great man are always you don't have to question God what's it all about and sit down and figure it all out in science and how does a spirit of Supernatural being come and get into us well that's like the hot hop Down in Africa they call the word the Unseen the the Amaya the wind said you worship the god which is a force that you don't see they've got to see something before they worship it that's idolatry God is a spirit they that worship Him worship Him in spirit and truth and are led by The Same Spirit Hallelujah Abraham Moses Moses was a man of God led by the spirit of God oh he want to lead himself one time he got all the mathematics and militarism all in his mind he know what a great man he was so he thought he could go right out and do it himself but he found himself a failure every technique he started was wrong he slew a man that's the first thing the military treats you kill somebody teach it go kill somebody else all right that was his tactic so he went out on his military education and he slew a man and was a stranger among his brethren for 40 years but one day old sheep heard her walking around on the backside of the desert and the first thing you know he come into the presence of God and when he did the Holy Ghost got a fire in the bush there and he told Moses more about his leading and five minutes and all he had take the military out of him and put the real genuine Holy Spirit in him so he could be led by the spirit I want you to notice Moses was a coward with all his military training with all his theology with all of his understanding of the Bible his mother had taught him from a child how what was going to take place how he was to be the emancipator of that great nation Israel all these things she had taught him but yet in his own mind he was unable to accomplish the purpose and every man I don't care how much education you got how well you know the Bible how much theology you've learned you're unqualified till you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be led by the spirit of God 120 I went up in the upper room these Apostles and and M mark 11:24 I believe it's Luke 24:49 and Luke 24:49 Jesus told them Apostles after they had been with him and preached and everything he said but you're my Witnesses but first I want you to go to the city of Jerusalem and wait there until you're endued with power from on high right no matter they had been associat with him for three and a half years they' had seen his miracles they know what his teaching but they had to have the Holy Ghost to leave them our schools are fine but we need the whole Holy Ghost to lead him that's right now when Moses when you get the Holy Ghost to leading you the Holy Ghost will lead you into some of the most ridiculous things that the world ever looked at and make you do the most ridiculous things that the world ever thought about you're going to be counted a little bit off in the upper story just remember if they persecute the prophets wh before you they'll persecute you Jesus said blessed are you rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven that's right yeah notice hallelujah how wonderful persecuted how that he'll do it because of your peculiar action now let's take a minute here's a man that's got all the military training he's got all the Seminary uh theology in him he knows the Bible but he's a coward he's standing out on the backside of the desert scared to go down in Egypt scared of his own neck he's a afraid to go down even afraid to visit his loved ones and when God met him up there and he got a revelation from God when God began to lead him he done the most ridiculous thing that any man could do run over and kissed his father-in-law goodbye and set his wife a straddle of a mule with a young on each hip got an old crooked stick in his hand and started down the whiskers of BL leing a little old mule hallelujah we're going down to Egypt to take over if that wasn't a ridiculous looking sign going down there to m ions of trained men where you going Moses we're going to Egypt to take over how you know you are God's leading me something on the inside of me pushing me and a good thing he done it too he went out and Tuck over because he was led by the spirit of God you shouts you cry you jump up and down you don't know what takes place one time when I go hunting up in the mountain I usually go to a big old place there the best water I've ever drink just go there and lay down how I could drink it tonight and I lay down there and drink and that's the happiest stream of water I ever seen in my life it's bubble bubble bubble all the time well one time I sat down and talk to that street I said now what makes you so happy perhaps maybe deers drink from you nope that's not it maybe bears drink from you nope that's not it maybe you're happy because of what's making you bubble is because I drink from you you just keep bubbling all the time so I can drink from you no that's not it if he could talk you know what he tell me why he say it isn't me bubbling it's something behind me pushing me making me bubble and that's the way every man is formed of the spirit of God he don't go himself no more but there's something behind him when he's led by the Holy Ghost makes him do things that he thought he wouldn't do thought you a bubbling something in your bubbling it ain't you shouting something and you screaming ain't you crying and something got in your tear du hey that's it led by the spirit of God went down there with this wife on a mule and two little babies with a stick in his hand an old Dead stick in his hand hobbling along with the Whiskers hanging down like this perhaps baldheaded going down whiskering along like that his back all been over nearly 100 years old 80 years going on his road down to Egypt to take over that big nation go to sure no matter how much in a minority you are as long as you're led by the Holy Ghost one is the majority make what your neighbor says she said you know what sad I don't know what's become of her she used to go downtown with me we used to shop and buy all kinds of clothes but you know she doesn't wear them anymore there's something wrong with s sure there is God got a hold of her exactly you know what every time the church bell rings your go sadly the church well praise God that's good what made the difference Sally she got something in her pushing her leading her shoving her that's right I used to watch I study nature used to be an old Nightingale in my home there's these Becka mocking birds that we I live on Mocking Bird Hill all night long keep my windows up that's what they call it moing bird Dr and in there in those bushes there's dozens of moing birds I keep cats shoot away all the time with a 22 rifle I hope I'm not hurting the cat lover but I sure C you got one my birds so uh they out there they come there and raise every year because we try to protect them raise up the window and sit there and I'm telling you they'll sit in those bushes and sing all night long I got to reading about them one time and you know what they do they cast their eye right on the star and right on the Moonlight if the moon's are shining and they'll sing a real dark night they'll let up but then the clouds will pull through and they'll see little SP and of light that they'll start singing as long as they can see light in the heavens they know there's a light somewhere the sun is shining against it and the sun will shine again on Earth and that's the way we feel about an old time Holy Ghost meeting you don't have to be all the time down in the dumps but when you get to a place you can feel the first little tickle of God coming down from heaven into your heart it makes a child of [Music] God don't matter how churches or anything about it it could be in the middle of the Cathedral of Rome and you holled Hallelujah you're not Longo up in my country hope y'all hav't got touch down here a boy got saved or got uh converted went to join a certain denomination church was a Methodist so he and his wife so they U moved from the country and went into the City and they took their membership out of the country Methodist Church where they had salvation and went down into the Big City Church where they they got a lot of theology oh everything just as starch as it could be so after a couple years the old man of the boy kept writing to him and said honey you all still go to church yes said we still going to church me and Molly goes all the time said well I'm going to come down and visit you so she's way up there in the mountains of Kentucky and when she come down she wore Kentucky clothes way high that great big puffed out shoulders and and little old shoes on real long down and when she started to Church somebody said what antique shop do this come out of now the Father the boy and his his his wife didn't want to take her to church because they know she was noisy she come out of the noisy church so this prid to being Bears so that morning she walked in and she said well praise the Lord to the Usher at the door he said oh my there you good that's your theology so she got her seat and sit down the little lady her daughter-in-law bowed her head and her face red and her ears could have L A match her son looks sideway see the done got in the WR CR that's all that's way you get too when you get in the wrong CR oh it's so Sly it comes in so CNY but you just get in the wrong place after while the preacher said dear friends he said we have one Redeemer and that is the Lord Jesus he said amen he said she said and he came to Earth to save the Lord she said Hallelujah that's right so he nodded over to his Deacon the Deacon went over over and told her said now Madam we like for you to come to church but you're interrupting the pastor if you don't keep still we'll have to lead you out the she said you might as well take me because I just can't St still amen that's it and you're led by the spirit of God you goow up if you didn't say something amen led by the spirit of God now look she might have not had her name written in who's who but I imagine it was written on the Lamb's Book of Life I'd rather have it there anyhow she might not have M so much here on Earth but in heaven she was the same amen led by the spirit of God Moses went out into Egypt he delivered the children because he was led by the spirit of God all the things that they did in the Old Testament the Saints the prophets Elijah follow a great man Elijah was and how he went up there bled by the spirit of God and challenged they had to bring up all your priest down there and let's see who's God that's a way let's put it to The Showdown see who's God and they got all the priests out there they killed their sacrific and L themselves and jumped up on the altar screaming with all the sincerity in the world oh bam answer bam answer Elijah walked around said maybe he's gone aishan trip or something hard just a little louder you know he was no God in the beginning but then just about the time the evening sacrifices du Elijah killed the bulock and laid up on the altar walked out there led by the spirit of God and said God I've done all of this at your being amen I tell you devils are tremble and sinners awake when men and women submit themselves to God and are led by the holy go that's right amen what a difference it is that's right now so he made the offering and he said God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob hear me about that time the fire god be to fall because he was led by the spirit of God man and women that those that are are led by the spirit of God no condemnation to them they're in Christ walk not as the flesh but after the spirit look at little old Mary one day she was a little little old girl about 18 years old living down a real mean City but she was a virgin she lived right she did right acted right and God was looking all over the world to find a woman that he could put trust in and he found all the women setting up singing the great hymns up there at the church and their big plumes in their hats or whatever they wore in them days but a little old poor girl coming up from the well with a bucket of water sitting on her head Lord God said I'll just take her and the Lord spoke to her and told her what she was going to do she's going to have a baby knowing no man she said behold the hands made of a lord be it unto me according to your will other words what don't know Lord how you're going to do it I don't know M I don't know man after the nature of human life I don't know how you going to do it I couldn't prove it scientifically and I'm not going to the doctor to ask him anything about it I don't know how it's going to be done and I don't care what anybody else says about it if you said that it's so it's so and she tck God at his word and if you're going to be led by the spirit of God you can't P this Bible says days Amica pass no such thing as divine meing all these other things and then want by the spirit of God to be led by God's spirit will testify every word to be the TRU amen God will speak of his own yes sir so you know what she never wait just you felt L she never wait just she was positive she didn't wait any longer and no more than Angel told her she started rejoice and say I'm going to have a baby amen she took God every word she was led in the spirit of God she become the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ she took God a for little Martha she was a kind of gitary little child and so she always wanted to make the house look clean she had to clean up everything make everything so spotless while Mary listen to the words of life but I imagine Mara was Ling too because she proved it one day one day when her brother was dead had been dead four days thinking nose of done felly and skin worm crawling in and out of him him up in the grave she heard that Jesus was coming that's a good message she heard Jesus was coming and she know she ever get in contact with Jesus her worries would be over I think that's a good way to feel today and while she was thinking on those things the Holy Spirit got over her and led her right out to him she was led by the Holy Ghost and she said Lord if th would have been here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will do it amen said thy brother shall rise again how could he say anything else said Do you believe I'm able to do this dear Lord I believe in my heart something tells me I'm LED of the spirit to say this Thou Art the Christ the son of the Liv that where have you bu come and see you you the grave weeping when he got out the grave he was always led by the spirit of God because God was in without me he was God was on the inside of him he said father I thank thee that thou hear me always but I say this I'm praying this prayer in other words so these are just an example of these who stand around so he said take away the stone they got away the stone he said Lazarus come forth and a man that was dead stood on his feet live amen a little old woman one time was led by the spirit of God she had a blood issue I can just look at her s up on the hill oh she spent all her money her husband probably was gone and she had some a farm she sold it pay off the doctor bill maybe she sold her the teens all the harness pay off the doctor bill all of her money had been spent and it wasn't nothing else left and she continually got worse many years she' had this Blood issue and one day I see her look out the window real pale and look down there said I wonder who that is down there it's such a commotion you know usually where Jesus is there's a lot of noise and it's commotion Str but it works that way and you know a lot of commotion that day when he come riding into Jerusalem on the back of the new I tell you he said if they hold their peace when they screaming and crying little rocks will cry out the SK a lot of emotion where he's at always find a lot of noise but I like to get around anything I hate that real still time go around some of these old Mars around here you got them in Street for too F The Undertaker part you take a dead man in there and bomb him so he can't come keep him there that's about the way teaching old theology that's just as dead as it can be back there and never tell about the holy ghost killing him giving him new life that's right all right what happened this little woman she said you know what I feel very strangely LED if I can only get down and touch this da I believe i' be made whole she said now the doctor didn't tell me that and when my pastor sees me going down there oh I'm going to be excommunicated right there that's going to S now there's one thing I got to do is listen what the doctor says what the pastor says cuz they both say he's a it and there's nothing to it the only thing he's doing is condemning other churches and things so I better not go down there and the Holy Spirit said my daughter if you want to get heal you better go so she listened to the Holy Spirit and was led out the Holy Spirit and she got down there where he was there's so many different bring Youngs and everything around him so he couldn't even she couldn't get near so you know what she did she sit down and crawl beneath her feet so she got over and touched the Garment for the Holy Spirit had told her she had Faith to believe and nothing can produce Faith but the Holy Ghost even Faith to be saved no man can come to me except my father draws me first and that is the Holy Ghost and no man can be saved without that Faith first acting in your sin acting in you and she had Faith the Holy Spirit Led her down there now when you get on there the devil said I look all around how you going to get in there well you're so pale you you stepp in there you get mashed to Pieces well I gu you say Lord I'm going to go to get the holy spirit said get down on your knees that's what he'll always do get down on your knees and then you startop and down to the crowd she went till she touched his gar led by the Holy Spirit and craw back through the crowd stood on the outside Jesus said somebody touch me amen that's the only way to do tonight is get out on your knees and stay touch amen he C him of His Garment and was made made completely whole because she was led of the Holy Spirit a little old fellow down there laying down that pool of theth been laying there for 38 years with an infirmity in his body praying with all his heart and Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit right down to where he was and heal the rest of us think about their diseases and things he went away from never said a word you want you want God to send the power up on you go to praying and believing the Holy Ghost will bring it to you healing salvation whatever you have e of God will bring it to you I can see a bunch of people that was coward 120 oh little old cowardly people and there they was they went up a little old step on time because God said I don't you preach anymore and don't you sing anymore don't you testify anymore until you've been filled with the Holy Spirit then he's going to lead you to All Nations to preach this gospel and they climbed up in the upper room and stayed there Cly the doors locked the windows locked praying Realo to themselves and hiding out from the Jews until the Holy Ghost fell on there came from Heaven a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind fill all the house where there setting cold and tongue set upon them like fire and Outdoors and windows both they went into the street led by the Holy Ghost and that fire that was kindled on the day of Pentecost is still Str H heart from that day
