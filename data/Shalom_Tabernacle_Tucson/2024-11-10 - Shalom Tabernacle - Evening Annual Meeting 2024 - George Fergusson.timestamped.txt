[58:15] somewhere brother Ted huh oh he didn't
[58:18] come back all right um we probably met
[58:21] him I would say about maybe 40 years ago
[58:26] he came to men and M we had a wonderful
[58:28] time together and we always cherish
[58:30] those
[58:31] moments and you know I
[58:34] was just I think it was probably one
[58:37] year after we got married Sharon was
[58:39] just a little baby at the time and
[58:41] brother Ted brother Ted cman what a
[58:43] wonderful time we had and my I was so
[58:46] blessed to hear him last night I this my
[58:49] he's just a different kind of
[58:51] preacher but we all enjoyed it we oh
[58:55] what a blessing i Bill brother Paul what
[58:57] a blessing amen and my I sat there and I
[59:01] I took several notes from some of the
[59:03] stuff he was saying you know he just
[59:04] went from here and he was able to P all
[59:06] of that together my what a preacher you
[59:09] know I I just pull me you know get it up
[59:11] at the
[59:13] pit and I've always told the church back
[59:15] home and says you know I don't have a
[59:17] gift to speak like some of the brothers
[59:19] you know I I have to realize so much on
[59:21] the anointing I have to pray and beg the
[59:24] Lord and if the anointing is not that
[59:26] just makes it so hard and it's true
[59:28] because I remember I was I came out of
[59:30] Africa you know you go into different
[59:32] types of anointings you brothers who
[59:33] travel know what I'm talking about you
[59:36] know you get into a missionary type
[59:37] anointing and you come back and you know
[59:40] to move from one anointing to the other
[59:42] is kind of hard but brother Brandon told
[59:44] us about that and do you Believers that
[59:47] are here you know all of us as
[59:49] Christians we understand as we move into
[59:51] the supernatural we understand these
[59:52] different things and tonight I'm not
[59:54] going to be talking about that though
[59:56] but I came back I was kind of pulling
[59:57] out of the I was pulling out of trying
[59:59] to get out from the missionary type
[1:00:01] anointing to get back into the pastor or
[1:00:04] take you of to work back home and it
[1:00:07] looked like I just had a hard time to
[1:00:09] get my mind off Africa I remember when I
[1:00:11] went the first times you know I'd come
[1:00:13] home and Shan was a little girl at the
[1:00:16] time and marinata and Gracie and I'd
[1:00:19] been gone for weeks cuz it was so much
[1:00:22] was during the time of the war and I was
[1:00:25] kind of talking to
[1:00:26] Bill
[1:00:27] lingar and brother de perbly let him
[1:00:30] know how the Lord kind of trained me in
[1:00:33] cuz I passed I I passed a part of my
[1:00:36] life in the tropical forest to kind of
[1:00:38] prepare me for that when I went into
[1:00:40] those times you and some of the most
[1:00:42] brutal Wars I was in Angola during the
[1:00:45] most one of the most brutal wars in the
[1:00:48] Congo I was there during the time of the
[1:00:50] war and it was really something that the
[1:00:53] Lord just helped me to be able to go and
[1:00:54] sometimes when I get back out
[1:00:56] my mind is just so much on it you know
[1:00:58] and you know elizel come and she says
[1:01:00] you know Fergie and you want to talk
[1:01:01] about the children and and I would s
[1:01:05] just you know I can't I can't my mind is
[1:01:07] just so much H my spirit is still in
[1:01:10] Africa if you understand it in the
[1:01:12] spiritual sense of it you know I go to
[1:01:14] Jeffersonville and give the whole
[1:01:16] reports some what's going on and you
[1:01:18] know we need this amount of messages to
[1:01:20] be sent here and how we could send the
[1:01:22] tapes here and how we could send there
[1:01:24] and all the things what the Lord has
[1:01:26] done and God is just working a mighty
[1:01:28] way and you know to see what he has done
[1:01:30] is just amazing amen and I've I've often
[1:01:33] stop sometimes to share few testimonies
[1:01:35] with you just before going before the
[1:01:37] message but tonight I think I'm going to
[1:01:39] you know I'm going to go almost direct
[1:01:41] to the message but I I'm kind of tempted
[1:01:43] to share one with you I think I did
[1:01:45] before and maybe some of you that I hear
[1:01:48] probably never heard this testimony
[1:01:49] before what I I think I'll just share it
[1:01:51] again with you all but it concerned a a
[1:01:54] Swedish a Swedish
[1:01:57] missionary that traveled into Africa and
[1:02:00] he thought you know he would go there
[1:02:02] and evangelize or missionary the
[1:02:04] Africans so he thought the best way to
[1:02:06] do it was to buy some land and build a
[1:02:10] house and employ the natives to cult
[1:02:15] make some cultivation and cultivate some
[1:02:17] crops and stuff so he built a big house
[1:02:20] with enough room you know brother George
[1:02:22] so he could the people the natives the
[1:02:23] people who work on the farm could sleep
[1:02:25] there and stuff build a very big house
[1:02:28] and then he employed these people but he
[1:02:29] noticed among the workers there was a
[1:02:32] one worker that was different to all the
[1:02:34] rest so he called this this worker in
[1:02:37] and he says I notice you're different to
[1:02:40] all the rest you're honest I could trust
[1:02:42] you you know you're such a hard worker
[1:02:45] uh what makes you so different and then
[1:02:48] the little worker said he said you know
[1:02:51] I read the books of a man called William
[1:02:54] Maran Brandon and it changed my life
[1:02:56] well the missionary didn't like to hear
[1:02:58] that thing William brandom say he says
[1:03:02] brandom so the missionary said it
[1:03:04] changed the little brother said it
[1:03:05] changed all my life so one day the
[1:03:08] missionary the Swedish missionary called
[1:03:09] his brother in and he said to him he
[1:03:12] said listen he
[1:03:13] says he says you're my best
[1:03:16] worker and he says if you will burn
[1:03:18] these books of brandham these brandham
[1:03:21] books he said I'll pay you more money
[1:03:24] and the little brother said said he said
[1:03:26] listen sir he says I can't burn those
[1:03:29] books he said I read those books and my
[1:03:31] whole life was changed so he said you're
[1:03:34] my boss he said you can do whatever you
[1:03:36] want if you want to find me whatever he
[1:03:38] says you're my boss he said I can't burn
[1:03:41] those
[1:03:41] books so this kind of you know irritated
[1:03:45] the Swedish missionary little B he
[1:03:46] wasn't happy so one day when the workers
[1:03:49] was out in the
[1:03:51] fields the Swedish missionary went into
[1:03:53] the room where this brother was staying
[1:03:55] he took all the books of brother brandom
[1:03:58] and he put it
[1:03:59] outside he poured a little bit of
[1:04:01] gasoline he pour some gasoline on that
[1:04:04] those books and he LD the books of fire
[1:04:07] and while the books were burning a wind
[1:04:10] came and blew the fire on his house and
[1:04:13] burned the whole house
[1:04:16] down and then this beish missionary saw
[1:04:20] that he smacked up everything he had
[1:04:24] left Africa and we never heard about
[1:04:26] this man
[1:04:27] again touch not man on be careful what
[1:04:31] you do with the word of the Lord see
[1:04:34] that God has done wonderful things
[1:04:37] amen I there was a little testimony I
[1:04:40] think maybe brother Paul you probably
[1:04:42] heard me say it because I shared it on a
[1:04:44] lot of the cat Division and maybe I'll
[1:04:46] just share that one with you and then be
[1:04:47] go to the word and of course just before
[1:04:49] wife for got I'm so happy my wife came
[1:04:51] with me and she wasn't feeling well and
[1:04:53] we prayed for her and tonight she feels
[1:04:54] much better and there's brother Luke and
[1:04:57] sister Stephanie with me and brother
[1:04:59] Luke has started to minister he's
[1:05:01] president of our trusty board and he
[1:05:03] started to minister so we simply honored
[1:05:05] to have him anybody share with you one R
[1:05:08] this is a testimony that has already
[1:05:09] trilled the hearts of people in
[1:05:11] different countries of the world where
[1:05:12] we had the cast Division I remember when
[1:05:15] we were in guara
[1:05:18] Andy in in in in Mexico when we were in
[1:05:22] St
[1:05:23] Petersburg on the last flag of the C
[1:05:25] division tour and also in Belgium and in
[1:05:28] uh in England when we had the cash
[1:05:30] division tour I shared this testimonies
[1:05:32] this testimony in different places and
[1:05:34] it was always a blessing but what it was
[1:05:37] is that we had sent voice of God had
[1:05:39] sent a huge shipment it was one of the
[1:05:42] largest shipment at the time that we
[1:05:44] ever sent to Africa and we sent it to
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:46] Cameroon so when the shipment got in I
[1:05:49] think we had about
[1:05:52] 28,000
[1:05:54] tapes on that
[1:05:56] shipment uh different tapes if I
[1:05:58] remember right maybe it could have been
[1:06:00] less than that and about 72 or 75,000
[1:06:04] booket messages that we sent it was huge
[1:06:06] it was not just for Cameroon we included
[1:06:08] Cameroon the country of Chad and also
[1:06:11] central Africa Republic so and also
[1:06:14] goria so the shipment went through the
[1:06:18] so when it got in
[1:06:19] Cameroon the head of the Customs called
[1:06:22] our our local representative
[1:06:25] and he told him he said hey he says you
[1:06:27] know uh the charge if I remember right I
[1:06:30] don't remember the exact amount I think
[1:06:32] it was something like
[1:06:35] uh 28% of all the the day evaluation of
[1:06:39] the books and I think if I remember
[1:06:42] right it was probably about
[1:06:43] 70 75% of their evaluation of the tipes
[1:06:48] so the evaluation came up at the time to
[1:06:50] over
[1:06:52] $50,000 so I called that I talked about
[1:06:55] for Joseph and I said Brother Joseph he
[1:06:57] said brother F what are we going to do I
[1:06:58] said we pray I says God do promise to
[1:07:01] answer
[1:07:02] prayer so we
[1:07:04] prayed and what happened brother George
[1:07:07] is that when the the shipment arriv and
[1:07:10] the Customs official because our local
[1:07:12] Representatives say well you know what
[1:07:14] can we do you know to get the exemption
[1:07:16] because this is this is religious
[1:07:17] materials so he said well the only thing
[1:07:20] I can tell you is go to the ministry of
[1:07:21] Justice the ministry of justice is in
[1:07:23] another city called Yi between between
[1:07:25] you and the is about two hours drive and
[1:07:28] the mission the local representative
[1:07:30] said so you know how it works here it
[1:07:32] will take months he said that's not our
[1:07:34] problem he says if you want he said you
[1:07:35] either pay pay the duties or you go to
[1:07:38] the ministry of
[1:07:40] justice so while we were praying a
[1:07:43] strange thing happened the Vatican
[1:07:45] Center container to
[1:07:48] Cameroon and the papers for the
[1:07:50] container from the Vatican got mixed up
[1:07:53] with our papers
[1:07:55] now now there's no sometime things get
[1:07:57] mixed up and you think it's wrong but
[1:07:59] sometime it's a blessing God knows
[1:08:01] exactly how we work things out so the
[1:08:03] Catholic priest went to the custom
[1:08:06] official he said official representative
[1:08:08] of the Vatican he says we want our
[1:08:10] container to be released so the the head
[1:08:13] of the custom official says he says well
[1:08:15] I don't have the authority to release it
[1:08:18] taxfree he says you need to take these
[1:08:21] documents to the ministry of Justice in
[1:08:24] onlyi so the Catholic priest now didn't
[1:08:27] check the documents to see what it was
[1:08:29] all about all what was in there he took
[1:08:32] the file from the custom official jumped
[1:08:34] in his car and rushed off the Y because
[1:08:37] they had to get that container that
[1:08:39] Vatican City Senter out quickly he went
[1:08:42] into the Customs officials and Y the
[1:08:45] ministry of Justice he said official
[1:08:48] representative of the Vatican he said we
[1:08:50] request that our container be Exempted
[1:08:53] from all taxes duties fees of the
[1:08:56] government of
[1:08:57] Cameroon been a Rome spee you know what
[1:09:01] happened I S Ministry of Justice because
[1:09:05] was urgent but but he didn't check all
[1:09:07] the papers to see what it was he put on
[1:09:09] the stamp Exempted Exempted Exempted
[1:09:13] Exempted from all the taxes duties fees
[1:09:16] of the government of Cameroon and he
[1:09:18] handed the papers back to the Catholic
[1:09:20] priest the Catholic priest didn't check
[1:09:23] it because he knew that the ministry of
[1:09:24] Justice given he jumped in his Sky and
[1:09:26] rush back TOA and he handed it to the
[1:09:29] Customs officials when the custom
[1:09:31] official opened it there was all the
[1:09:34] documents of voice of God for all those
[1:09:37] States thousands of States thousands of
[1:09:40] books tax Exempted tax Exempted so he
[1:09:43] called them our local official said come
[1:09:46] and get your stuff so God knows exactly
[1:09:49] what he does Amen to get his word all
[1:09:52] over and how happy we are amen you know
[1:09:56] these are testimonies I could you know
[1:09:58] share many of them with you there so
[1:10:00] many testimonies of the things that God
[1:10:02] has done and we know that it's not us
[1:10:05] it's what he has done for us and we're
[1:10:07] grateful to him now tonight I have a
[1:10:10] little message on my
[1:10:13] heart and you know sometimes you travel
[1:10:16] in places and you get a you think in
[1:10:18] your heart you're going to speak on a
[1:10:20] subject that will be a blessing to
[1:10:22] everyone and then to your surprise some
[1:10:24] people get a little IR
[1:10:26] irritable and they say well one brother
[1:10:28] tell me Well you not placing the quotes
[1:10:30] right I said brother I don't know I says
[1:10:32] all I could all I know to do is read the
[1:10:34] quotes and say Lord you you place it
[1:10:37] right I don't know he is he said it's
[1:10:40] the quotes truth the quot but you're not
[1:10:42] BL I said but please I don't know I said
[1:10:46] tonight I'm going to read for you and
[1:10:48] share with you some scriptures and some
[1:10:50] quotes
[1:10:51] and I trust that you love me after I
[1:10:54] trust that it'll be a Revival and a
[1:10:56] blessing for you I sat in the meeting
[1:10:57] and I I heard brother Paul speak and
[1:11:00] brother I say Paul me you know I kind of
[1:11:03] felt a little sorry for myself coming up
[1:11:05] after these brothers because really it
[1:11:07] was a tremendous message that you know
[1:11:09] I've heard brother Paul speak many times
[1:11:11] I think that was one of the best I've
[1:11:12] ever heard him and it was really it was
[1:11:15] not him I think it was really the Lord
[1:11:17] to Jes our brother and certainly we do
[1:11:20] appreciate it we can really one of the
[1:11:21] things we can do we can truly appreciate
[1:11:23] it when we see the hand of the Lord
[1:11:25] using a brother to to bring something
[1:11:29] that is a blessing to the people now
[1:11:31] tonight um I know that the theme is love
[1:11:34] and stuff and I I'll probably talk a
[1:11:36] little bit about it but I'll go into it
[1:11:38] in a slightly different direction
[1:11:40] tonight the direction is going to be
[1:11:42] different to brother Paul different to
[1:11:43] brother Ted last night and just stress
[1:11:47] it will be a blessing to you this
[1:11:50] subject I want to share with you has a
[1:11:53] personal appeal to me
[1:11:57] because since I've been around this
[1:12:01] message I've heard people talk about you
[1:12:04] know I've heard them say well the Lord
[1:12:05] revealed to me and the Lord revealed to
[1:12:09] me and the Lord reveal and sometimes
[1:12:11] I've seen people that tell me said
[1:12:13] brother you know why do you believe this
[1:12:15] this this this this and then they say
[1:12:17] well it's a revelation brother and then
[1:12:20] I some of it I can see it's the truth
[1:12:22] and then some of it I was puzzled and I
[1:12:25] remember when I came in into this
[1:12:26] message from the Jesus name Pentecostals
[1:12:28] I was just 21 years old at the time and
[1:12:32] I wasn't married at the time
[1:12:34] and um I was an evangelist working for
[1:12:37] the several Pentecostal moves if I were
[1:12:41] call it the Jesus name Pentecostals at
[1:12:43] the time and even trinitarian
[1:12:45] Pentecostals uh preached in many in some
[1:12:48] of the conventions among them I remember
[1:12:51] I preached in the convention with Bishop
[1:12:53] Johnson who was the Bish Bishop of the
[1:12:56] Church of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:12:58] Bishop Lawson who was a a bishop of the
[1:13:01] Church of our Lord Jesus Christ Bible
[1:13:03] Way and some of the Bishops of the
[1:13:06] Church of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:08] Apostolic Faith we had meetings and I
[1:13:11] spoke in their conventions and we had
[1:13:14] campaigns to speak and stuff and I
[1:13:17] wasn't in the message and when I came to
[1:13:18] the message in you years they still
[1:13:20] invited me to come so I had open doors
[1:13:22] to go to several denominations but this
[1:13:24] word when I begin to read the message
[1:13:26] and hear the tapes of brother
[1:13:28] bam this word revelation has always been
[1:13:31] a something that kind of if I would
[1:13:34] bring a personal confession something
[1:13:36] that kind of puzzled me a little bit I
[1:13:40] said Lord this maybe there's something
[1:13:42] about it that
[1:13:43] um I just don't seem true the hears this
[1:13:46] might sound strange of me telling you
[1:13:48] this in this way I just don't seem to be
[1:13:51] in the H it looked like I've looked at
[1:13:54] it I've heard many we just talk about it
[1:13:56] I've heard people in the message say
[1:13:58] that the Lord revealed this to them and
[1:13:59] revealed that to them and I've even felt
[1:14:02] like that in my own self Lord you know
[1:14:04] you you know I know you revealed it to
[1:14:06] me I know that but then there was always
[1:14:08] just a little element there that I I
[1:14:11] didn't seem to be able to really put my
[1:14:13] finger on to really be able to until a
[1:14:15] couple of weeks ago that the Lord
[1:14:16] already dealt with me and I saw some
[1:14:18] things and I really feel in my heart
[1:14:20] that for the first time I'm able to
[1:14:22] stand at the puppet and to be able to
[1:14:25] speak to you all in a way that I wasn't
[1:14:27] probably was not able to before because
[1:14:29] I saw some things concerning Revelation
[1:14:31] that really changeed my whole concept
[1:14:35] and one of the things that we do thank
[1:14:38] the Lord for as I go into the word is
[1:14:41] that as Christians that those Junctions
[1:14:44] and changes in our lives means a lot to
[1:14:47] us that there are times that we going in
[1:14:49] a certain direction and the Holy Spirit
[1:14:50] seem the changes and we know in our
[1:14:53] hearts it's not us it's not something
[1:14:55] something we imagine but it's really
[1:14:56] that the lord it's what the Lord does
[1:14:59] because to me you know we can do
[1:15:00] whatever we want I can do like I've
[1:15:02] always thr the church back home I can
[1:15:04] pray and pray and pray and pray you can
[1:15:06] pray and pray and pray and the most
[1:15:08] important part of a prayer is not you
[1:15:10] saying it and not me saying it but it's
[1:15:12] when God answers it's what God does so
[1:15:14] the emphasis shifts from us to him and
[1:15:17] uh I kind of like the emphasis brother
[1:15:19] Paul put on that and I really certainly
[1:15:21] thank the Lord and tonight I'm going to
[1:15:23] go in a certain direction
[1:15:25] and uh I trust I really trust with all
[1:15:27] my heart it will be a blessing to you
[1:15:31] and I'll try my best as I used to say in
[1:15:34] a funny way I'll try my best to take my
[1:15:36] time and hurry up so I won't hold you
[1:15:38] all too too long so I trust the Lord
[1:15:40] that he will help me with that now I got
[1:15:44] SCS of scriptures and I do not believe
[1:15:46] that we'll be able to finish this
[1:15:47] subject tonight it's just too much I got
[1:15:50] many many scriptures and I trust that it
[1:15:52] will be a blessing
[1:15:55] to you okay now I I pray the Lord that
[1:16:00] he would help me to make it as simple as
[1:16:03] possible to you because I
[1:16:06] I you know I'm not here to criticize
[1:16:10] complicated preaching I've heard
[1:16:12] preachers preach and when they preach
[1:16:14] you scratch your head after because it's
[1:16:16] so complicated one brother was in Europe
[1:16:20] and he preached at a convention and
[1:16:21] nobody was able to catch anything what
[1:16:22] he said and some of the people said said
[1:16:25] well he preached so deep yeah that
[1:16:27] nobody was able to but to me that's not
[1:16:29] deep preaching you know the prophet tell
[1:16:32] us that the deeper you go in God the
[1:16:34] simple it gets and what caused people to
[1:16:38] think it's complicated because brother
[1:16:39] Brandon said that even the scribes and
[1:16:40] far as these made it complicated man
[1:16:43] loves to make because man knows as the
[1:16:45] prophet says man knows that God is so
[1:16:47] great that you think it's complicated
[1:16:48] it's not complicated it is simple but
[1:16:52] hidden you see God hides it and then
[1:16:55] when he when he when he opens your eyes
[1:16:57] and you see it wow it's so simple he
[1:17:00] says wow that is so simple amen and we
[1:17:02] are certainly grateful to God for it so
[1:17:05] tonight I my prayer is that he would
[1:17:07] help me to be able to bring it to you in
[1:17:10] a simple way and trust the Lord that at
[1:17:12] the end of this service when you leave
[1:17:14] you're going to leave with something not
[1:17:16] from me but something from him you see
[1:17:18] and that's the most important thing is
[1:17:20] what you receive from him because what
[1:17:22] do what do we have to give you nothing
[1:17:24] what say he have to give you everything
[1:17:27] and if we can bring something it's not
[1:17:28] us it's he using us and that's what we
[1:17:30] want to do it's him to use us to be able
[1:17:32] to be a blessing to you here tonight
[1:17:35] amen God bless you all now we will take
[1:17:38] a scripture and I want to show you a
[1:17:40] pattern running through the entire
[1:17:42] scriptures and we would look at that and
[1:17:46] talk a little bit about it and we will
[1:17:48] stand at this time and we will look at
[1:17:51] the book of the the the the um the book
[1:17:54] of of Isaiah Isaiah chapter
[1:17:58] 550 I'm
[1:18:00] sorry not F
[1:18:03] yeah yeah Isaiah chapter
[1:18:06] 55 from verse
[1:18:09] 10 for as the rain cometh down and the
[1:18:12] snow from heaven and return it not th
[1:18:15] but water it the Earth and make it bring
[1:18:17] forth in blood that it may give seed to
[1:18:19] the SE and bread to the eater so shall
[1:18:23] my word be that goeth forth out of my
[1:18:25] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[1:18:29] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:18:31] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:18:35] where unto I sent
[1:18:37] it and then I'd like to take a little
[1:18:42] other scripture here which is Matthew
[1:18:46] chap 23 and verse
[1:18:48] 37 oh
[1:18:51] Jerusalem Matthew 23 and verse 37
[1:18:56] oh Jerusalem
[1:18:58] Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets
[1:19:01] and stonest them which have sent unto
[1:19:03] thee how often will I have gather thy
[1:19:06] children together even as a hen
[1:19:08] gathereth her chickens under her wings
[1:19:11] and ye would
[1:19:13] not and then another little scripture
[1:19:16] found in Luke chapter 18 that's for our
[1:19:18] Day verse 7 and 8 Luke 18: 7 and 8 and
[1:19:23] shall not God avenge his own elect which
[1:19:25] CED day and night unto him though he be
[1:19:27] along with them I tell you that he will
[1:19:30] avenge them speedily nevertheless when
[1:19:33] the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:19:35] faith on the earth that's right oh god
[1:19:38] of Heaven may you bless your
[1:19:40] word may you help us Lord as we look at
[1:19:43] the Simplicity of this message tonight
[1:19:45] we thank you and we glorify you in Jesus
[1:19:49] name amen God bless you you can be
[1:19:53] seated now now all of us I believe that
[1:19:57] almost all of us here if not all of us
[1:19:59] here tonight you know we say that we are
[1:20:01] message
[1:20:04] Believers and even me to I I am a
[1:20:06] message believer but what is the
[1:20:12] message what is the
[1:20:16] message because if we tell someone if
[1:20:19] you go up to someone and say he's a
[1:20:20] Baptist or he's a Catholic and say I'm a
[1:20:23] message believer
[1:20:26] I would think the mind would look at you
[1:20:27] and he he doesn't understand what he's
[1:20:28] trying to say and to him what are you
[1:20:31] trying to tell me what are you trying to
[1:20:33] say you're a message believer what does
[1:20:35] that mean but if we look at what that
[1:20:39] does that mean when we say that we a
[1:20:40] message
[1:20:41] Believers we know that this Bible that
[1:20:44] we've got
[1:20:45] here I've got in my hands
[1:20:48] here this Bible
[1:20:51] here it's got two important phases to
[1:20:54] this Bible
[1:20:56] god
[1:20:59] promise and God
[1:21:02] fulfill before he fulfills it he
[1:21:06] promis and when he promises it he
[1:21:10] fulfills it he fulfills what he has
[1:21:13] promised well we see a pattern running
[1:21:16] through the entire scriptures that
[1:21:19] touches Us in this day and that is this
[1:21:24] people when they see God make a promise
[1:21:28] hold to the promise and reject the
[1:21:31] manifestation of the
[1:21:33] promise now which is
[1:21:36] strange because life comes by when the
[1:21:40] word of God is manifested that's what
[1:21:43] the prophet tell us in the message turn
[1:21:44] on the light but before we look into all
[1:21:47] of that I want to go back and look at
[1:21:49] the pattern running through the
[1:21:52] scriptures now when we we all know that
[1:21:56] Moses and brother bam told us this Moses
[1:21:59] had the Scrolls and the children of
[1:22:01] Israel had the Scrolls so Israel knew
[1:22:04] that God was going to deliver them right
[1:22:07] they knew that God was going to deliver
[1:22:09] them and then God came down filled in a
[1:22:13] pillar of fire and Called Moses now
[1:22:16] Moses had the Scrolls and he knew that
[1:22:19] he was the deliverer that's he also knew
[1:22:22] that God had raised him up to deliver
[1:22:24] the children of of Israel of course all
[1:22:25] of us here tonight we're aware of that
[1:22:28] but when Moses met God in Exodus 4
[1:22:33] listen close now because we're going to
[1:22:34] go deep into this in Exodus chapter 4
[1:22:38] and Moses answer because God says I
[1:22:39] heard the the cries of my people and I
[1:22:42] come now to deliver them God had given
[1:22:45] them a promise of Deliverance and God
[1:22:47] was going to honor his promise because
[1:22:49] God will always keep his word God always
[1:22:52] keeps his word amen now and when uh God
[1:22:57] came down and spoke to Moses in Exodus 4
[1:23:00] and Moses answered and said but behold
[1:23:02] they will not believe me nor hearken un
[1:23:06] my voice for they will say the Lord had
[1:23:07] not appeared unto thee so what Moses
[1:23:11] told God God didn't tell Moses Moses
[1:23:13] you're
[1:23:13] wrong because Moses has already went to
[1:23:16] the children of Israel 40 years before
[1:23:19] that and what happened they had rejected
[1:23:21] him and then Moses spread into the
[1:23:24] wilderness we all know that we all we're
[1:23:26] aware of that we know that that is the
[1:23:28] scripture so when God when Moses told
[1:23:31] that to God in Exodus 4:2 and the Lord
[1:23:34] said unto him what is that in thine hand
[1:23:36] and he said
[1:23:38] a and he said cast it on the ground and
[1:23:41] he cast it on the ground and become a
[1:23:42] serpent and Moses fled from before
[1:23:47] it and then God spoke back and God says
[1:23:49] it shall come to pass in verse 8 if they
[1:23:53] will not believe the the neither hearken
[1:23:55] to the voice of the first sign that they
[1:23:57] will believe the voice of the latter
[1:23:59] sign so God gave Moses two signs to the
[1:24:03] children of Israel to prove that his
[1:24:06] Commission because Moses had met the of
[1:24:09] fire now and Moses was God had
[1:24:11] commissioned him to go God was
[1:24:12] commissioning him God says go do it
[1:24:14] Moses and Moses was already excused he
[1:24:16] said no they believe me so God says I'm
[1:24:18] giving you the
[1:24:19] signs and these scientists identified
[1:24:22] that I sent you now when Moses went down
[1:24:25] to Egypt I mean to Egypt in Exodus
[1:24:29] chapter if you look at it here Exodus
[1:24:32] chapter 4 verse 30 and
[1:24:36] 31 and Aaron this is what happened and
[1:24:40] Aaron spake all the words I'm going to
[1:24:42] go back to Exodus chapter 4 I'm sorry in
[1:24:44] my
[1:24:45] Bible because I got from verse 30 here
[1:24:48] on my notes but I'll go back a little
[1:24:49] further on it and um we will read a
[1:24:53] little a little further up okay are you
[1:24:56] with me tonight now I love to hear amen
[1:25:00] sir could you give me an amen that
[1:25:03] sounds good all right now let's go to
[1:25:05] now don't say Amen if you don't
[1:25:09] agree but if you really agree and you
[1:25:12] being blessed you can say Amen all right
[1:25:13] we get into that a little while I know
[1:25:15] that on some of the things I might say
[1:25:17] tonight I might probably not have much
[1:25:19] amens but that's all right all right
[1:25:21] let's see here now Exodus 4 and we go to
[1:25:24] verse 30 verse
[1:25:27] 29 and Moses and Aaron went and gathered
[1:25:30] together all the Elders of the children
[1:25:32] of
[1:25:36] Israel and Aaron spake all the words
[1:25:40] which the Lord had spoken un Moses and
[1:25:41] did the signs in the sight of the
[1:25:44] people and the people
[1:25:48] believed and when they heard that the
[1:25:50] Lord had visited the children of Israel
[1:25:52] and that he had looked upon their
[1:25:53] affliction
[1:25:54] then they bow their heads and
[1:25:57] worshiped did Israel
[1:26:04] believe did Israel
[1:26:10] believe I'm you
[1:26:13] hesitation the Bible said they
[1:26:17] believe that Israel
[1:26:19] believe yeah they believe did Israel
[1:26:22] believe no sir
[1:26:26] you said brother person you're
[1:26:28] contradicting the Bible all
[1:26:33] right all right let's go to the
[1:26:37] Bible let's go to Hebrews chapter
[1:26:48] 3 you says I'm not go I'm not going to
[1:26:51] listen to you brother Ferguson you
[1:26:52] contradicting the Bible all
[1:26:55] right good let's see what Paul
[1:27:00] says Hebrews chapter 3 from verse
[1:27:06] 17 but with whom was he grieved 40 years
[1:27:10] was it not with them that had sinned
[1:27:12] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:27:15] and to whom sway that they should not
[1:27:17] enter into his rest but to them that
[1:27:22] believed that believed
[1:27:25] I'm not hearing that I'm not hearing I'm
[1:27:26] not hearing the voice I'm not hearing
[1:27:28] you say nothing to me but to those who
[1:27:30] believe
[1:27:32] not let's go
[1:27:37] further let us therefore fear L A
[1:27:41] Promise left us of entering into his
[1:27:43] rest any of you should seem to come
[1:27:45] short of it for unto us was the Gospel
[1:27:47] preached as well as unto them but the
[1:27:50] word preached did not profit them not
[1:27:53] being mixed with faith in them that
[1:27:54] heard it so did Israel
[1:27:57] believe now you don't know what the
[1:28:00] answer did Israel
[1:28:03] believe
[1:28:05] no what happened how come Exodus said
[1:28:08] they believe here is what the prophet of
[1:28:10] God tell us and we're going to quote
[1:28:13] another scripture to prove it the
[1:28:15] scripture is in
[1:28:17] Jude Israel started off as
[1:28:21] believers they started off this is the
[1:28:24] danger they started off as Believers two
[1:28:27] million
[1:28:30] strong
[1:28:32] now I'm going to read for
[1:28:35] you what happened to
[1:28:38] Israel and we'll show you a pattern
[1:28:41] running through the entire scriptures on
[1:28:44] that okay so that everybody will begin
[1:28:47] to see and trust it will be a
[1:28:51] blessing to you
[1:28:55] amen amen I'm not hearing a big amen
[1:28:59] there what's the matter
[1:29:03] amen
[1:29:04] amen did Israel believe
[1:29:08] yes that Israel believe
[1:29:12] no let's see what the prophet says what
[1:29:15] it
[1:29:17] happened I'll read it for
[1:29:19] you ain't he wonderful to us yes sir yes
[1:29:23] sir now you're not saying
[1:29:24] amen all right we're going to you're
[1:29:26] going to be saying amen just now we're
[1:29:29] going to we're going to get a few amens
[1:29:30] out of you just now and you'll see it as
[1:29:32] we go further then then you're going to
[1:29:34] see really what we're trying to say
[1:29:37] okay ever present water from the
[1:29:40] Rock brother bam says then what kind of
[1:29:42] people ought we to be having faith in
[1:29:44] this great redeeming Christ that lives
[1:29:47] in US amen the smitten rock that never
[1:29:49] leaves the church I'm with you always
[1:29:51] even to the end of the world the ever
[1:29:52] presence of the Great gusher of
[1:29:54] Salvation and power that poured forth
[1:29:56] from Calvary into the church amen the
[1:29:59] ever presence of the Living God the
[1:30:01] great fluence smitten rock that goes
[1:30:02] with us in our journey and brother bam
[1:30:05] talks about Israel
[1:30:08] now Israel lost their
[1:30:12] faith they got off the path they begin
[1:30:16] to last for the flesh Parts if they had
[1:30:19] stayed with faith and believing that God
[1:30:21] was going to take them to the land they
[1:30:24] would have been nothing hinder them they
[1:30:26] had already opened up Seas they had
[1:30:29] smoked plagues upon the enemies they had
[1:30:32] crucified the enemies behind them and
[1:30:34] had walked over into the land and still
[1:30:36] couldn't have faith to go into the
[1:30:40] promise then brother bam says he quoted
[1:30:43] the scripture here in Jude if you want
[1:30:46] I'm going to just read the quote for you
[1:30:48] quick I don't want to spend too much
[1:30:49] time on
[1:30:51] it because what we see Happening Here
[1:30:54] Exodus is a pattern running through the
[1:30:55] entire
[1:30:58] scriptures um over
[1:31:00] in in the message those that are in
[1:31:03] prison
[1:31:05] now brother Bram says here now let's
[1:31:08] read over in the book of Jude first I
[1:31:10] believe I have marked on here for the
[1:31:12] first place in Jude and then over in
[1:31:14] second Peter then brother brandham goes
[1:31:16] on I'm going to skip a little bit he
[1:31:19] quotes Jude where Jude says I will
[1:31:22] therefore put you in remembrance though
[1:31:24] you once knew this how that the Lord
[1:31:26] having saved the people out of the land
[1:31:29] of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that
[1:31:32] believe not so God saved them so the
[1:31:36] people says did God save me yes I was
[1:31:40] saved and then God turned around around
[1:31:43] and destroyed them who he saved because
[1:31:47] of unbelief let me continue let me
[1:31:49] continue here with you because see God
[1:31:52] had made the promise and here God
[1:31:54] fulfilled the promise before
[1:31:57] them and when God fulfilled the promise
[1:32:00] before Israel instead of Israel
[1:32:02] accepting the Fulfillment because when
[1:32:04] Moses appeared on the scene that was the
[1:32:06] Fulfillment of the promise that's
[1:32:11] right that's right and life comes by the
[1:32:14] word of God made
[1:32:17] manifest now let me read it for you he
[1:32:20] said saved them first brought them out
[1:32:23] of Egypt and then have to destroy them
[1:32:26] because they didn't continue with their
[1:32:29] message you see it you see they didn't
[1:32:32] continue on with their message Israel
[1:32:36] lost their faith yes now this is
[1:32:39] something we see throughout the
[1:32:40] scriptures all we see it with
[1:32:44] Moses we see we see what happened with
[1:32:48] uh in the time of of of Samuel when
[1:32:51] Samuel came all right when Israel
[1:32:53] rejected
[1:32:56] Samuel we saw what happened one of the
[1:32:58] things that really touched my heart and
[1:33:00] almost brought tears to my eyes is what
[1:33:03] I read Daniel chapter
[1:33:06] 9 we saw it happen with
[1:33:09] Jeremiah let me just take a little bit
[1:33:12] before I go further into Revelation
[1:33:14] let's take a minute and just look at
[1:33:15] this because it's a pattern where we see
[1:33:17] people start off as
[1:33:19] Believers and ended up unbelievers
[1:33:24] this happened in the ministry of Our
[1:33:27] Lord when Jesus was here on Earth
[1:33:30] multitudes followed his ministry
[1:33:34] multitudes and then when he made that
[1:33:36] statement if you if you don't eat my
[1:33:38] flesh and drink my blood then those
[1:33:40] multitudes left him and at the end of
[1:33:44] his ministry there was only 120 that
[1:33:47] went up to the upper room all of them
[1:33:50] left which we see in the scriptures and
[1:33:52] we can show you a little bit in the
[1:33:54] scriptures the pattern and Paul wanders
[1:33:57] he said let us fear this this happened
[1:33:59] to us yeah because we see the people
[1:34:02] start off as Believers believe in the
[1:34:04] prophet and then they deviate into all
[1:34:06] kinds of
[1:34:07] confusion now let's let's look at it a
[1:34:11] little bit I'll just read for you a
[1:34:12] little bit so you can see for yourself
[1:34:15] what
[1:34:15] happens now Moses warned
[1:34:21] people as Paul also did
[1:34:24] and in Deuteronomy
[1:34:27] 4:2 Moses told the people he shall not
[1:34:31] add unto the word which I command you
[1:34:34] neither shall he diminish ought from it
[1:34:37] that he may keep the Commandments of the
[1:34:39] Lord your God which I commanded you so
[1:34:41] it was very important to Israel to stay
[1:34:45] exactly with what Moses brought and then
[1:34:48] this is why God told the same thing to
[1:34:50] Joshua because the people deviate and as
[1:34:53] the people deviate they don't realize it
[1:34:55] it's so easy to deviate see to get away
[1:34:58] from it and Israel deviated until 2
[1:35:01] million left Egypt and only two out of 2
[1:35:04] million entered into the promised land
[1:35:06] we are all aware of that and it stands
[1:35:08] as an example to all of us
[1:35:11] tonight amen now God warned
[1:35:16] Joshua and what God told Joshua is this
[1:35:20] in Joshua chapter 1 and verse 7 God
[1:35:23] speaking to Joshua he said only be thou
[1:35:26] strong and very courageous that thou
[1:35:28] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:35:31] the
[1:35:32] law which Moses my servant commanded
[1:35:37] thee turn not not from it to the right
[1:35:40] hand or the left that thou mayest
[1:35:43] Prosper wheresoever thou
[1:35:45] goest this book of the Lord shall not
[1:35:48] depart out of thy mouth but thou shall
[1:35:51] meditate there in day and night
[1:35:54] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:35:56] to all that is written therein okay for
[1:36:00] then thou sh make thy way prosperous and
[1:36:03] then thou shallal have good success have
[1:36:06] not I commanded thee be strong enough
[1:36:08] good courage Be not Afraid neither be
[1:36:11] thou
[1:36:15] dismayed but say that word dismayed
[1:36:18] means to be discouraged that's what he
[1:36:19] says for the Lord thy God is with thee
[1:36:22] wheresoever thou goest
[1:36:24] amen now God tell Moses and Moses told
[1:36:27] the people do not add do not take away
[1:36:30] told Joshua stay exactly with
[1:36:35] it because the people deviate to the
[1:36:38] left to the right they're bringing all
[1:36:40] kinds of stuff into
[1:36:42] it which of course but Paul was talking
[1:36:44] about ulry this morning now we have
[1:36:48] Joshua here doing exactly what God told
[1:36:51] him and we have something very very
[1:36:54] I love this what Joshua did so we look
[1:36:58] at Joshua 8 from verse 33 I'm just got
[1:37:01] to hurry now because I haven't really
[1:37:04] gotten into the main part of my message
[1:37:05] yet but if not I'm just going to cut
[1:37:06] because I'm I'm not going to hold you
[1:37:07] too long but Joshua chapter 8:
[1:37:11] 33-35 and all
[1:37:14] Israel and their
[1:37:16] elders and officers and their judges
[1:37:20] stood on this side of the Ark and on
[1:37:23] that side side besides the priests the
[1:37:25] Levites which bear the Ark of the
[1:37:27] Covenant of the Lord as well as the
[1:37:29] stranger now even the stranger was there
[1:37:32] okay that's what as the stranger as he
[1:37:35] that was born among them half of them
[1:37:38] over against M Mount gim and half of
[1:37:41] them over over against Mount
[1:37:45] ebal as Moses the servant of the Lord
[1:37:48] had commanded before that the people
[1:37:49] should bless that they should Bless the
[1:37:52] people of Israel
[1:37:54] and afterwards he read all the words of
[1:37:58] the law the blessings and the
[1:38:02] chrs according to all that is written in
[1:38:05] the book in The Book of the law there
[1:38:08] was not a word of all that Moses
[1:38:11] commanded which Joshua read not before
[1:38:14] all the congregation of Israel with the
[1:38:17] women and the little ones even the
[1:38:19] little bitty ones you said when he's too
[1:38:22] little to hear the message let him hear
[1:38:24] it yes sir you says the The Strangers in
[1:38:29] our midst if they hear us are reading
[1:38:31] the message you're quoting Moses if they
[1:38:33] hear us talking about Moses they will
[1:38:34] get offended forget about the strangers
[1:38:36] read
[1:38:38] it let God take care of
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:44] that Hallelujah I told you everybody
[1:38:46] going to me because this there is this
[1:38:48] idea among the people you know you know
[1:38:50] we can't bring this to the people we
[1:38:52] can't bring that people what is this
[1:38:55] thing I remember I went among the
[1:38:57] menites in in MOBA now you might
[1:38:59] disagree that's all right you got to
[1:39:01] right too no problem if somebody want to
[1:39:03] disagree and theit came in there
[1:39:05] probably would we had some meetings here
[1:39:07] at the beginning when I wor to to
[1:39:08] Manitoba there probably about 300 of
[1:39:10] those menites was there at the meeting
[1:39:12] the school was we we had it in the
[1:39:14] school auditor it was packed and I got a
[1:39:16] whole bunch of B books like
[1:39:18] this and I put it on the
[1:39:21] paper I told those people I said listen
[1:39:25] I said I don't want to stand here and
[1:39:26] pretend that I believe something I don't
[1:39:28] believe it I says I want to be honest
[1:39:31] with all of you I believe what this man
[1:39:34] preached and those menites stood there
[1:39:36] and they
[1:39:37] looked and they said the nervous this
[1:39:40] guy but then they say well at least he's
[1:39:42] being honest you know what I baptized
[1:39:44] menite families I baptized the
[1:39:47] freezin the weees the dakes large
[1:39:51] families came to the message and was
[1:39:54] baptized and accepted the message
[1:39:57] because the people knew what they were
[1:39:58] coming to not something that we try to
[1:40:00] falsify no let them hear it Joshua read
[1:40:04] it you're a stranger hear it you're a
[1:40:07] little B kid hear it you're an adult
[1:40:10] hear it the woman hear it to the women
[1:40:12] the men everybody hear
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:17] it
[1:40:20] amen am
[1:40:24] amen you know there's all kinds of
[1:40:28] nonsense people say and sometime I shake
[1:40:30] my head when I hear it you know they
[1:40:33] said that we we we uplifting brother bam
[1:40:36] if we call his
[1:40:38] name that's one of the excuse my
[1:40:42] expression one of the biggest lies being
[1:40:45] told amen because if God in a man's name
[1:40:48] is uplifting the man okay then we should
[1:40:51] take our Bibles and TR it to the track
[1:40:53] that's because my Bible your Bible that
[1:40:55] you got in your hand mentions the name
[1:40:58] Moses
[1:41:00] 854 times right amen I know that people
[1:41:05] AR going to say Amen go to your computer
[1:41:07] and check that's
[1:41:09] right
[1:41:10] 800 imagine if I have to stand at the
[1:41:13] puet and mention Moses name 854 times in
[1:41:17] an age like this what are they going to
[1:41:18] say of me what they going to say mother
[1:41:20] Ferguson what are you trying to do with
[1:41:21] Moses call it up person's name is not
[1:41:24] lifting them
[1:41:26] up where do we find it in the
[1:41:29] Bible do you know how many times the
[1:41:32] Bible mentions the word
[1:41:34] David do you know how many times the the
[1:41:36] Bible mentions the word Paul you take
[1:41:38] your Bible and look at the book of Acts
[1:41:40] Paul Paul did this Paul said that Paul
[1:41:43] Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul is that
[1:41:46] lifting up a
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:49] man listen Church the hour has come
[1:41:52] where we have to St stop listening to
[1:41:54] all kinds of nonsense and come back to
[1:41:56] the truth of the word of
[1:41:59] God thank you Lord amen and Min got the
[1:42:03] pre not the congregation Amen
[1:42:08] brother and they claim to be Believers
[1:42:11] of what they claim to believe the Bible
[1:42:13] excuse me if I say it but I could to say
[1:42:14] it because too much nonsense is going
[1:42:17] around amen true amen and it need to be
[1:42:20] it need to be told amen and then the
[1:42:23] blame falls on us but Joshua didn't
[1:42:26] listen to that he at all what Moses
[1:42:29] said no let's move a little bit from
[1:42:32] Moses from
[1:42:34] Joshua let's go a little
[1:42:37] further let's go
[1:42:39] to to
[1:42:42] Isaiah and Isaiah in Isaiah
[1:42:45] 53 verse
[1:42:47] one he said Isaiah said who would
[1:42:49] believe our
[1:42:51] report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:42:53] Lord revealed is all right thank you my
[1:42:58] brother who believed our
[1:43:01] report Isaiah
[1:43:04] speaking then if we go
[1:43:06] to before we go on to
[1:43:10] Isaiah let's look a little bit and see
[1:43:12] what happened with Samuel you think you
[1:43:14] think that God's prophets when God sent
[1:43:16] a message and S of prophet you think
[1:43:18] everybody opens their hearts and says
[1:43:20] hey we we believe no
[1:43:23] here's what the people said to Samuel St
[1:43:25] to hurry now Lord help me to hurry 1
[1:43:29] Samuel 8 verse
[1:43:31] 7 and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken
[1:43:35] unto the voice of the people in all that
[1:43:37] they say unto thee for they have not
[1:43:39] rejected thee but they have rejected me
[1:43:42] that I should not Reign Over them you
[1:43:45] see the thing that they rejected in
[1:43:47] Samuel they thought they were rejecting
[1:43:51] Samuel but he was not Samuel they were
[1:43:54] rejecting that's right it was God Amen
[1:43:58] Let Me Go On
[1:43:59] Again H REO the people in all that they
[1:44:02] say unto thee for they have not rejected
[1:44:04] me thee but they have rejected me that I
[1:44:06] should not Reign Over them according to
[1:44:08] all the work The Works which they have
[1:44:11] done excuse
[1:44:14] me just drink a bit of
[1:44:17] water here in Arizona it's a little bit
[1:44:22] more the temperature is pretty dry for
[1:44:24] us and we used to a more humid climate
[1:44:26] now brother
[1:44:32] Paul excuse
[1:44:35] me and the Lord said unto Samuel hearken
[1:44:38] unto the voice of the people in all that
[1:44:39] they say unto thee for they have not
[1:44:41] rejected thee but they have rejected me
[1:44:43] that I should not Reign Over them
[1:44:45] according to all the works which they
[1:44:47] have done since they did I brought them
[1:44:49] out of the out of Egypt unto this
[1:44:52] day where it they have forsaken me and
[1:44:54] serve other gods so do so do they also
[1:44:57] unto
[1:44:59] thee excuse
[1:45:01] me now therefore hacken unto their voice
[1:45:05] how be it yet protest solemnly unto them
[1:45:09] and show them the manner of the king
[1:45:10] that shall reign unto them and Samuel
[1:45:13] told all the words of the Lord unto the
[1:45:15] people that asked of him a king
[1:45:18] nevertheless the people refused to obey
[1:45:21] the voice of Samuel and they said
[1:45:23] but we will have a king over
[1:45:26] us
[1:45:29] am you want to
[1:45:32] listen now we want to we want to go and
[1:45:36] see what they did in the time of Samuel
[1:45:39] in the S of now this song is a little
[1:45:40] negative but we'll get to the positives
[1:45:41] in a little bit some things that will
[1:45:43] really be blessing to you
[1:45:48] now Isaiah when Isaiah came he said who
[1:45:51] would believe our report of course we
[1:45:52] all know the job faced the same
[1:45:53] rejection too the prophet of God tell us
[1:45:56] that job's three deacons turned against
[1:45:58] him they were what you call his
[1:46:01] comforters they came to miserable
[1:46:05] com and not only the job's deacons
[1:46:09] turned against him but job entire
[1:46:10] congregation turned against him we know
[1:46:12] that Noah was rejected in his day with
[1:46:14] the message he brought and out of that
[1:46:16] whole generation how many came out of
[1:46:18] all that generation only eight people
[1:46:20] and there is something I want to share
[1:46:22] with you as I go forward in all of this
[1:46:24] and trust it will be a blessing so
[1:46:26] Jeremiah said um Isaiah said that in the
[1:46:28] case of Jeremiah chapter
[1:46:31] 44 the people told Jeremiah to said
[1:46:34] Jeremiah go and ask the Lord go inquire
[1:46:36] of the Lord for us Jeremiah went and the
[1:46:39] inquired of the Lord and brought back
[1:46:40] the word of the Lord and here's what the
[1:46:42] Bible says when Jeremiah came back with
[1:46:44] the word of the Lord then all the men
[1:46:47] which knew that their wives had burned
[1:46:48] incense and other gods and all the wom
[1:46:51] that stood by a great multitude even all
[1:46:53] the people that dwelt in the land of
[1:46:54] Egypt in patros answered Jeremiah saying
[1:46:58] ask for the word that thou has spoken un
[1:47:00] Us in the name of the Lord we will not
[1:47:03] hearken unto thee now brother bam says
[1:47:05] in this particular age the people are
[1:47:07] not saying that right I'll show you what
[1:47:10] the attitude of the people
[1:47:13] is they're not saying of the message we
[1:47:15] don't
[1:47:18] believe many of them say they believe it
[1:47:20] but I'll show you what the prophet of
[1:47:22] God said is the problem with this
[1:47:23] particular age that we are live in and
[1:47:25] this is hindering Revelation because a
[1:47:27] lot of people say well God revealed to
[1:47:28] me and God revealed to me we get to that
[1:47:30] in a little bit and show you what the
[1:47:31] true Revelation is because I'm the I
[1:47:33] don't want to stand there and say this
[1:47:35] is wrong this is wrong I not show the
[1:47:36] truth amen I want to be able to show you
[1:47:39] exactly what the truth is what is the
[1:47:41] true Revelation what it is and how God
[1:47:43] does it so that when you leave here you
[1:47:45] can have an idea in your mind you can
[1:47:46] have a mighty in your mind you know
[1:47:47] exactly what it is is that is that is
[1:47:51] that fair is that good could everybody
[1:47:53] say Amen to that all right so when you
[1:47:56] leave now let me hurry here I don't want
[1:47:58] to spend too much time on
[1:48:00] Jeremiah but let's go to the prayer of
[1:48:02] Daniel and then we will move we'll move
[1:48:04] quickly now this prayer of Daniel
[1:48:06] brought tears almost brought tears to my
[1:48:09] eyes because I didn't read for you in
[1:48:10] Jeremiah but Jeremiah made the same
[1:48:12] prayer when he was praying concerning
[1:48:14] the prophets and how the people rejected
[1:48:16] every time God sent prophets now here in
[1:48:19] Daniel chapter 9 from verse 3 Daniel
[1:48:22] said and I set my face unto the Lord God
[1:48:25] to seek by prayer and supplications with
[1:48:27] fasting and sa and Ashes and I prayed
[1:48:29] unto the Lord my God and made my
[1:48:31] confession and said oh Lord the great
[1:48:33] and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant
[1:48:36] and mercy to them that love him and to
[1:48:38] them that keep his Commandments we have
[1:48:40] sinned and have committed iniquity and
[1:48:43] have done wickedly and have rebelled
[1:48:45] even by departing from thy principls and
[1:48:48] from thy judgments what is these princip
[1:48:50] and these judgments Moses said don't add
[1:48:54] don't take away stay with it exactly why
[1:48:57] because Moses knew it was not him he
[1:48:59] knew that what he receed came from
[1:49:02] God Amen and as the people deviated to
[1:49:06] displease God exactly what happened to
[1:49:08] Eve in the Garden of Eden when God gave
[1:49:10] her the word to deviate a little bit
[1:49:12] from that brought death and destruction
[1:49:15] you see it has to be exactly that word
[1:49:18] which we'll get to in a little
[1:49:20] bit see now now we continue here uh
[1:49:26] Daniel prayer he says and I prayed unto
[1:49:28] the Lord my God and made my confession
[1:49:30] and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful
[1:49:32] God keeping the Covenant and mercy to
[1:49:35] them that love him and to them that keep
[1:49:37] his Commandments we have sinned and have
[1:49:39] committed iniquity and have done
[1:49:40] wickedly and have rebelled even by
[1:49:42] departing from thy principes and from
[1:49:44] thy judgments neither have we hearkened
[1:49:47] unto thy servants the prophets which
[1:49:50] spoke in thy name to our Kings our Prin
[1:49:52] princesses and our fathers and to all
[1:49:54] the people of the land oh Lord
[1:49:57] righteousness belong unto thee but unto
[1:49:59] us confusion of
[1:50:01] faces as at this day to the men of Judah
[1:50:04] and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and
[1:50:06] to all Israel that are near and that are
[1:50:08] a far throughout all the countries
[1:50:11] wherein thou has driven them because of
[1:50:13] their trespasses that they have
[1:50:14] trespassed against thee Oh Lord to us
[1:50:17] belong confusion of Faith to our Kings
[1:50:21] to our princesses and to our fathers
[1:50:23] because we have sinned against thee to
[1:50:25] the Lord Our God belong mercies and
[1:50:27] forgiveness though we have rebelled
[1:50:29] against him neither have we obeyed the
[1:50:32] voice of Our Lord God to walk in his
[1:50:35] laws which he set before us by his
[1:50:37] servants the
[1:50:38] prophets yeah all Israel have
[1:50:41] transgressed thy law even by departing
[1:50:43] that they might not obey thy voice
[1:50:46] therefore the curse is poured upon us
[1:50:48] and the oath that is written in the law
[1:50:50] of Moses the servant of God because we
[1:50:52] have sinned against thee what how did
[1:50:54] Israel sin brother said there's only one
[1:50:57] way to gain God's favor back to the word
[1:50:59] there's only one way that displeases God
[1:51:02] is when we deviate from that
[1:51:07] word when Jesus
[1:51:09] came we had the same
[1:51:12] situation and I want to read for
[1:51:16] you
[1:51:17] in John was the same thing when John
[1:51:20] came preaching
[1:51:22] I won't have time to go into all of it
[1:51:24] in Mark chapter one The Bible says all
[1:51:26] of Judy and all of them came out and
[1:51:28] baptized and got baptized the people
[1:51:30] started off good they all came out to
[1:51:31] hear John and they got
[1:51:32] baptized out of all those multitudes
[1:51:35] that follow John do you know how many
[1:51:36] that John presented to the because he
[1:51:39] was sent to prepared away do you know
[1:51:40] how many of those people that he was
[1:51:42] able to present to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:43] butam said it was just a handful of them
[1:51:46] just a few of them because all of them
[1:51:49] came and got baptized but did they
[1:51:51] continue did they continue with the word
[1:51:53] did they continue with their message
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:57] no so we have the same thing here
[1:51:59] happening with
[1:52:01] Jesus now if we look at John chapter 1
[1:52:04] and verse 11 verse 10 rather he was in
[1:52:08] the world and the world was made by him
[1:52:10] and the world knew him not he came under
[1:52:11] his own and his own receed him not but
[1:52:13] as many as receive him to them gave he
[1:52:16] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:52:17] them that believe on his name if you
[1:52:19] want to I'm trying to hurry
[1:52:21] now and um let me just hurry a little
[1:52:24] bit
[1:52:25] here
[1:52:27] uh in John
[1:52:29] 12:37 and though he had done so many
[1:52:32] miracles before them yet they believe
[1:52:33] not on
[1:52:34] him you see when the word was manifested
[1:52:37] before their
[1:52:38] eyes you see to recognize the
[1:52:41] manifestation of that word is life amen
[1:52:44] you see when you see that word
[1:52:46] manifested that's the word God made the
[1:52:48] promise in the Bible here it is it's
[1:52:50] being manifested before your eyes amen
[1:52:52] amen amen amen you see it's like when
[1:52:55] when the angel came to Mary and
[1:52:58] Elizabeth was able to recognize that
[1:53:00] that was Isaiah 9 and verse 6 being
[1:53:03] fulfilled she was able to see the
[1:53:04] scriptures being
[1:53:07] fulfilled when John came on the scene he
[1:53:10] was the scriptures being fulfilled and
[1:53:12] the scribes and Pharisees missed the
[1:53:14] Fulfillment they knew that Elijah truly
[1:53:17] has to come first they knew all those
[1:53:19] scriptures but when Elijah appeared on
[1:53:22] this seen they held on to the promise
[1:53:24] Elijah is supposed to come and rejected
[1:53:27] the Fulfillment of the same
[1:53:30] promise I'm not hearing much amen
[1:53:36] here isn't that the truth yes sir all
[1:53:40] right let's go quickly
[1:53:46] Paul and Paul here in Galatians chap 1
[1:53:50] and verse 6 he he said I
[1:53:53] Marvel that he is so soon removed from
[1:53:56] him that called you onto the grace of
[1:53:58] Christ onto another
[1:54:01] gospel which is not another but there be
[1:54:04] some that troubles you and would prefert
[1:54:05] the gospel of Christ but though we or an
[1:54:08] angel from heaven preach only other
[1:54:09] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:54:11] preached unto you let him be a
[1:54:13] curse as we said before so I again if
[1:54:16] any man preach and hear the gospel unto
[1:54:18] you then he have receiv received let him
[1:54:19] be a curse for do I now persuade men or
[1:54:22] God do I seek to please
[1:54:24] men if I yet pleased men I should not be
[1:54:27] the servant of Christ but I certify you
[1:54:30] Brethren that the gospel which is
[1:54:31] preached of me is not after man for I
[1:54:34] neither receive it of men neither was I
[1:54:37] taught it but by the revelation of Jesus
[1:54:39] Christ so Paul is telling that first age
[1:54:42] it was God that revealed it to
[1:54:46] him and warning the first stage about
[1:54:50] that now we have the same repeat in this
[1:54:53] age
[1:54:56] sir amen amen
[1:55:06] okay I hope I can find it for you
[1:55:10] quick are you being
[1:55:12] blessed what a poor
[1:55:16] amen what a poor amen I think we can do
[1:55:19] a little better amen than that
[1:55:24] oh I didn't write
[1:55:26] the the
[1:55:28] um maybe I'll find it
[1:55:31] quick Lord help me
[1:55:35] here
[1:55:38] yep um it's where he said oh I I wrote
[1:55:44] it down and didn't write the reference
[1:55:46] I've got it in here but I didn't write
[1:55:48] the exact page it's where he says he was
[1:55:52] talking about the Revelation that he had
[1:55:55] and he said you might disagree with me
[1:55:57] he said that's all
[1:55:58] right he said but if you search it out
[1:56:01] quite right you would find out that
[1:56:04] first the angel of the Lord showed it to
[1:56:08] me and then he showed me to find it in
[1:56:11] the Bible now brother Bram claimed that
[1:56:13] it was the angel of the Lord that gave
[1:56:15] him the Revelation that he preached
[1:56:18] here's the danger preacher see brother
[1:56:20] bam standed to pet and EXP explain the
[1:56:24] Bible they think they can do the
[1:56:27] same so they get up behind the and they
[1:56:29] preach could they said at the angel of
[1:56:30] the Lord told him
[1:56:32] that now let me get let me let me read
[1:56:35] something for you I told you what I'm
[1:56:36] going to be saying I'm not going to get
[1:56:38] many
[1:56:39] amens I'm going to get a lot of amens
[1:56:41] here that's all right but let's go to
[1:56:44] Revelation now
[1:56:47] okay let's go to
[1:56:50] the let's go to the revelation right
[1:56:53] now are you being
[1:56:56] blessed all right this is so so so good
[1:57:02] we love him with all our hearts don't we
[1:57:06] I I'm getting a little problem to get it

[1:57:20] me tonight that the Lord would help me

[1:57:24] yeah I'm not getting it the way the way
[1:57:27] I should but it's where brother Brandon
[1:57:29] mentions oh Lord I got to get
[1:57:32] that
[1:57:35] uh it's he mentions here and I there's
[1:57:38] some was some of my notes I could have
[1:57:40] probably left back at my hotel room I
[1:57:42] think the devil just kind of tie me up
[1:57:45] on that yeah okay I got it thank the
[1:57:48] Lord I got it thank you for your prayer
[1:57:50] amen that's wonderful I remember brother
[1:57:53] Billy Paul used to tell me he said watch
[1:57:54] him when he begin to get his notes mixed
[1:57:56] up brother Billy Paul used to tease me
[1:57:58] on that one okay let's see here now in
[1:58:02] the church ages brother Brandon made
[1:58:04] this
[1:58:05] statement and of course many of us
[1:58:07] sitting here probably aware of it he
[1:58:09] said notice here that Jesus by the
[1:58:11] spirit in every age addresses himself
[1:58:13] only to one person relative the word for
[1:58:15] that age we all know that only one
[1:58:19] messenger for each
[1:58:20] age receives what the spirit has to say
[1:58:23] to our age many people don't believe
[1:58:24] that because they're looking for
[1:58:25] something else to tell them amen why I
[1:58:28] don't understand the people on here God
[1:58:30] sent Moses why to something else listen
[1:58:32] to go cor listen to D listen to this one
[1:58:34] listen to that God sent Moses pill of
[1:58:36] fire confirm him to have to
[1:58:38] truth God sent Isaiah he had the truth
[1:58:41] God sent s Samuel he had the truth God
[1:58:44] said Jeremiah he had the truth it's just
[1:58:46] the nature of man to Rebel that's right
[1:58:50] and in this particular age we have to
[1:58:52] the same problem amen only one there's
[1:58:54] not 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 doesn't it exist only
[1:58:59] one we can't listen to everybody amen so
[1:59:04] only one messenger receives what God has
[1:59:06] to say 40 age excuse
[1:59:11] me I'm sorry here got to get this now
[1:59:16] I'm getting into my message now trying
[1:59:18] to hurry yeah only one messenger for
[1:59:21] each age
[1:59:22] receives what the spirit has to say to
[1:59:24] our age and that one messenger is the
[1:59:26] messenger to the true church he speaks
[1:59:29] for God by Revelation to the churches
[1:59:31] both true and false the message is then
[1:59:33] broadcast to all but though it is
[1:59:35] broadcast to all who come within range
[1:59:38] of that
[1:59:39] message that message is received
[1:59:42] individually by only a certain qualified
[1:59:45] group Hallelujah in a certain
[1:59:50] way now I'll share with
[1:59:53] you that in a certain way so God sends
[1:59:58] his Revelation to us in a certain way
[2:00:03] which we will look at in a little bit in
[2:00:05] a certain way each individual of that
[2:00:09] group let me read that for you but it is
[2:00:12] Rec but all who come within range of the
[2:00:14] message that message is received
[2:00:16] individual individually by only a
[2:00:19] certain
[2:00:24] qualified
[2:00:26] group not everybody because the angel of
[2:00:28] the Lord told Brother Bram he says many
[2:00:31] would not believe you but many will so
[2:00:34] if the angel of the Lord said that we
[2:00:36] expect that there'll be many who will
[2:00:38] not believe so don't don't be don't
[2:00:40] don't don't don't be be stumbled when
[2:00:42] you see people turning your backs on the
[2:00:44] word it happened in every age it
[2:00:46] happened in the time of Moses it
[2:00:48] happened in the time of Jeremiah it
[2:00:50] happened in the time of Samuel it
[2:00:51] happened time of Jesus don't be don't be
[2:00:54] amazed amen it has to happen to fulfill
[2:00:56] the
[2:00:59] scriptures amen let's continue
[2:01:02] here uh he
[2:01:06] says he okay the message is in broadcast
[2:01:10] to all but though it is broadcast to all
[2:01:12] who come within range of the message
[2:01:14] that message is receive individually
[2:01:16] individually by only a certain qualified
[2:01:19] group in a certain way each individual
[2:01:21] of that group group is one who has the
[2:01:23] ability to hear what the spirit is
[2:01:25] saying by way of the messenger let me
[2:01:28] hear the whole church say that by way of
[2:01:30] the M messenger so they were able to
[2:01:33] hear what the spirit was saying by way
[2:01:34] of Moses they were able to hear the true
[2:01:37] the true believers what the spirit was
[2:01:39] saying by way of Noah they were able to
[2:01:41] hear what the spirit was saying by way
[2:01:42] of Jeremiah by way of Isaiah but the
[2:01:45] majority of them rebelled some started
[2:01:48] but they didn't continue many started
[2:01:50] but they didn't continue you true
[2:01:53] because they deviated here let me read
[2:01:55] for you a little bit as we go forward
[2:01:58] now okay so it's is a certain way that
[2:02:02] God s that that that that God sends it
[2:02:04] to us we'll get into that in a little
[2:02:06] bit so each individual of that group is
[2:02:07] one who has the ability to hear what the
[2:02:09] spirit is saying by way of the messenger
[2:02:11] those who hear are not getting their own
[2:02:15] private re
[2:02:18] Revelation me got a little Revelation
[2:02:21] boy you don't see it brother George but
[2:02:23] I got my little Revelation you know what
[2:02:25] brother George it's a revelation brother
[2:02:27] listen anybody could say anything and
[2:02:29] call it our
[2:02:31] Revelation and that's what we seeing
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:36] today somebody can say I got a
[2:02:39] revelation that I don't have to pray a
[2:02:40] lot is that scripture when Jesus says
[2:02:44] pray without without ceasing somebody
[2:02:46] got a revelation he shouldn't come to
[2:02:48] church is that scripture it's exactly
[2:02:50] the opposite of what the prophet said
[2:02:53] but they call all this stuff
[2:02:59] Revelation and they blame God that's
[2:03:02] right God is getting a lot of blame for
[2:03:04] things he's not guilty of the devil does
[2:03:06] what he want to do and God gets blame
[2:03:08] for it so they put it on God that's what
[2:03:10] the devil has done the devil is not
[2:03:12] going to tell the people it's me Satan
[2:03:13] telling you that he's saying it's me God
[2:03:15] telling you that right and we all aware
[2:03:18] of this problem now let's continue here
[2:03:20] quickly I'm just have to hurry Lord help
[2:03:22] me to hurry help me all right now let's
[2:03:25] see so each individual of that group
[2:03:27] okay we read that those who here are not
[2:03:30] getting their own private Revelation
[2:03:32] that's right man I got a little
[2:03:33] Revelation you know there nothing about
[2:03:35] it but brother Ferguson what is it you
[2:03:37] pray maybe the Lord will give you the
[2:03:39] same Revelation as
[2:03:43] me what's the next verse have you heard
[2:03:46] that listen have you heard that then
[2:03:49] join the rest of us we have heard that
[2:03:51] many
[2:03:55] it's a revelation it
[2:03:58] is what is this mysterious Revelation
[2:04:01] brother where is it in the scriptures
[2:04:03] where is it in the word of God well I
[2:04:04] can't tell you because it's a
[2:04:08] revelation that's
[2:04:10] true a revelation that cannot be told is
[2:04:13] that a revelation that's right there you
[2:04:16] go yes sir
[2:04:19] amen where in the word of God do we have
[2:04:22] a revelation that cannot be
[2:04:24] told now Church listen the hour has come
[2:04:27] for us to wake up and realize what's
[2:04:29] happening too many people are asleep
[2:04:31] it's to the realities of what's going
[2:04:33] on true
[2:04:39] amen amen am let's
[2:04:44] continue
[2:04:46] so those who here not getting their own
[2:04:49] private Revelation nor is a group
[2:04:51] getting their own Collective Revelation
[2:04:53] so you know it's me us four and no more
[2:04:59] it's me and my old church we got a
[2:05:00] revelation brother you know what brother
[2:05:03] my pastor brought a mighty Revelation
[2:05:05] from God but nobody else got
[2:05:12] it now we're talking like this but we
[2:05:14] got to get back to see what the true
[2:05:15] Revelation is yeah okay we don't want to
[2:05:17] dwell too much on the negatives but
[2:05:18] let's look at we have to look at the
[2:05:19] negatives for you to to you to see it
[2:05:21] see because God always God always
[2:05:24] projects it in a contrast you see day
[2:05:26] and night you know he projects
[2:05:28] everything so you all understand all
[2:05:30] right we won't spend much time on that
[2:05:31] so he said those okay they're not
[2:05:33] getting their own private Revelation or
[2:05:35] is a group getting their own Collective
[2:05:37] Revelation but each
[2:05:39] person is hearing and
[2:05:43] receiving what the messenger has
[2:05:47] already received from God am now if
[2:05:54] these individuals are getting their
[2:05:56] little Revelations it didn't come true
[2:06:00] the messenger then where are they
[2:06:02] getting it from you know in the time of
[2:06:04] Noah instead of lining up with Noah they
[2:06:06] want to build their own arck and by then
[2:06:08] when the rains come you know that
[2:06:09] brother B tell us that when the rains
[2:06:11] came all those ARS that Noah didn't
[2:06:12] build went down the only one AR Flo it
[2:06:14] was Noah you see so that's what we have
[2:06:18] now brother brandham goes on he says now
[2:06:20] think it not St that this is the case
[2:06:23] for Paul set this pattern under the hand
[2:06:25] of God Paul alone had the full
[2:06:27] Revelation for his day as evidenced by
[2:06:29] his confrontation of the other
[2:06:32] apostles who admitted that Paul was the
[2:06:34] prophet Messenger to the Gentiles for
[2:06:36] that day and also note by actual
[2:06:38] illustration in the word and when Paul
[2:06:40] desired to go to Asia butam continu see
[2:06:43] I'm going to try to skip some of
[2:06:45] this to continue and then he says here
[2:06:48] in every age we have exactly the same
[2:06:50] pattern so there's no without this
[2:06:52] pattern uh that is why the light comes
[2:06:54] through some god-given messenger in a
[2:06:56] certain
[2:06:57] area and then from that messenger there
[2:07:00] spreads the light through the ministry
[2:07:02] of
[2:07:04] others the
[2:07:07] what the what amen the ministry of who
[2:07:12] of only one sir all right the light
[2:07:16] comes through the minist through one and
[2:07:18] then it spreads through the ministry of
[2:07:20] others who have been Faithfully taught
[2:07:23] the problem is not how is spreading the
[2:07:25] light right we see what the problem is
[2:07:29] the problem is that ministers preaching
[2:07:31] is what they're
[2:07:35] preaching bam gift but said was God his
[2:07:38] teaching was the
[2:07:41] devil amen
[2:07:44] that's this church is be on fire Ste
[2:07:48] Amen brother
[2:07:51] let's continue we continue here I'm
[2:07:53] going try try to
[2:07:55] hurry all
[2:07:57] right but of course all those who go out
[2:08:01] don't only always learn how necessary it
[2:08:04] is to speak only what the messenger has
[2:08:06] spoken am remember Paul warned the
[2:08:09] people to say only what he said 1
[2:08:11] Corinthians 14:37 If any man think
[2:08:13] himself to be a prophet or spiritual
[2:08:16] Amen Let Them acknowledge that the
[2:08:17] things that I WR unto you are the
[2:08:19] Commandments of God Amen amen amen
[2:08:24] amen amen and then Paul goes on but if
[2:08:27] you want to be ignorant let him ignorant
[2:08:30] still what Paul brought was the
[2:08:32] Commandments of God that's right because
[2:08:34] the angel of the Lord God revealed it to
[2:08:36] him what brother Bram brought was the
[2:08:38] same thing God came down and revealed it
[2:08:40] to brother Bram the angel of the lord
[2:08:42] gave it to him and show him where to
[2:08:43] find it in the word so when we hear in
[2:08:45] brother Brandon we know for sure that
[2:08:47] his message came from God Amen am yes
[2:08:52] sir
[2:08:54] now let's go a little step further
[2:08:58] now let's go on Paul warned
[2:09:03] them let's go on the adol here will take
[2:09:07] away there and soon the message is no
[2:09:09] longer pure and the Revival dies
[2:09:13] down
[2:09:15] now brother bam thought of something
[2:09:17] here that I
[2:09:20] love and read it for
[2:09:22] you that a lot of
[2:09:24] people don't
[2:09:27] believe these are the quotes of
[2:09:33] our no
[2:09:36] amen all
[2:09:37] right
[2:09:41] perseverance says you know when Jesus
[2:09:44] preached there wasn't one 1% of the the
[2:09:46] one millionth of the people on Earth
[2:09:48] ever heard him look what heard John to
[2:09:51] make preparation see it's the elected
[2:09:53] hears it that's all that's right no man
[2:09:55] can come to me except my father draws
[2:09:57] him first and all the father had given
[2:09:59] me will come that's right now I believe
[2:10:03] that there's a church coming into that
[2:10:06] Perfection that Ministry of perfection
[2:10:09] where the officers where
[2:10:12] Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[2:10:16] evangelists for the Perfection of the
[2:10:19] church I'm not explaining anything
[2:10:22] for the
[2:10:24] what for the
[2:10:27] what who said that not only B said Paul
[2:10:31] said it too for the Perfection of the
[2:10:34] church them pastors and teachers and so
[2:10:38] forth will be so with the
[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:45] word until the whole thing would work
[2:10:47] right up into the coming of the Lord I
[2:10:50] believe that and I believe we are
[2:10:53] nearing that time now I believe it is so
[2:10:58] do we all believe it is so could we lift
[2:11:01] our hand and give God praise for that
[2:11:05] hallelujah amen amen amen
[2:11:10] now let's continue on God has a way that
[2:11:15] he gives you and I
[2:11:17] Revelation and the revelation we receive
[2:11:20] is what he has already already given
[2:11:22] that's right to the prophet that's right
[2:11:24] now this Bible I have in my hand here
[2:11:27] the prophet that God tell us and I'm not
[2:11:29] going to go back and read the course I
[2:11:30] got all the course on it this Bible I
[2:11:32] have in my hand here is the revelation
[2:11:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen this
[2:11:37] book we have in our hands here this book
[2:11:39] is already brother said the word is
[2:11:41] already revealed here right amen okay
[2:11:45] sir now when I read my Bible I'm reading
[2:11:50] the revelation of the word of
[2:11:52] God that does not mean I have the
[2:11:56] Revelation I'm reading the Revelation if
[2:12:00] I listen to a tape I'm hearing the
[2:12:03] Revelation it does not mean I have the
[2:12:11] Revelation there is a process that God
[2:12:14] goes through to give me the Revelation
[2:12:16] and give you the revelation of what he
[2:12:19] has already revealed
[2:12:22] so we're not getting a private
[2:12:25] revelation we getting a revelation that
[2:12:28] is already
[2:12:29] revealed all right this might sound a
[2:12:32] little strange to
[2:12:34] you but I'll read it from the message
[2:12:37] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:12:39] for
[2:12:39] you it's why the prophet of God when you
[2:12:42] talk about Revelation it's so vast we
[2:12:45] talk about love and brother brandom says
[2:12:46] the revelation of divine love when God
[2:12:49] give you a revelation of divine love
[2:12:51] what is that the revelation of divine
[2:12:54] love is a revelation that God has
[2:12:56] already given in the Bible already given
[2:13:00] it's nothing new it's not you and I
[2:13:02] getting a new revelation it's you and I
[2:13:05] getting a revelation from God okay we'll
[2:13:08] get to that in a little bit I'll share
[2:13:10] that with you a little bit to see how
[2:13:11] God does it okay I'm going to try to
[2:13:13] hurry is that all right now let me read
[2:13:16] it for you so everybody can see what we
[2:13:19] are
[2:13:21] saying yeah all right aren't you being
[2:13:24] blessed
[2:13:26] am all right let me see here I got a
[2:13:28] little quote here yeah we read that
[2:13:31] already the Bible is the complete
[2:13:32] revelation of Jesus Christ okay and of
[2:13:36] course there's one I think I should read
[2:13:38] for you just the same so you will see
[2:13:40] the importance of the message and when
[2:13:42] we talk about you know people deviating
[2:13:44] from the message they got to it has to
[2:13:46] happen it happened in Moses it happened
[2:13:48] in in in Jesus time it has to be it's
[2:13:51] not it's not a well you know we
[2:13:53] surprised to see this Paul said I'm
[2:13:55] marveled but it happened even Paul
[2:13:56] marveled but it happened what are you
[2:13:58] going to
[2:13:59] do
[2:14:06] amen
[2:14:07] now
[2:14:11] um I need to read something for you here
[2:14:15] I think you probably noed but I think
[2:14:16] I'm going to deviate a little bit from
[2:14:17] where I'm going and just read this one
[2:14:19] for you so that you can see little what
[2:14:21] brother PanAm says as we come into the
[2:14:23] revelation of this here's what he
[2:14:25] says um this is in Gabriel's
[2:14:28] instructions to Daniel he said now the
[2:14:30] closeth he said now the close is a fact
[2:14:32] that God deals with Israel only when
[2:14:34] she's in her homeland of course brother
[2:14:36] Ted Teddy spoke a little bit about that
[2:14:38] that's when God Abraham left the
[2:14:39] Homeland and went down into Egypt what
[2:14:41] happened he walked away from the will of
[2:14:43] God and never was blessed till he
[2:14:45] returned back to the Homeland God never
[2:14:48] dealt with him not One Vision not
[2:14:50] nothing else did he come back to the
[2:14:51] Homeland look at Israel when they was
[2:14:54] they were sent down in Egypt for 400
[2:14:56] years not one Miracle not one sign not
[2:14:59] one thing happened among them not
[2:15:01] recorded in the history of the book the
[2:15:03] same old 99 go to church offer the lamb
[2:15:07] say he Mary or whatever it was back then
[2:15:09] next year same thing the priest will
[2:15:11] argue Rabbi so and so we elect Rabbi so
[2:15:14] and so he's got a better scholarship he
[2:15:15] knows more than the Egyptians first
[2:15:17] thing you know the Egyptians and all of
[2:15:18] them was the same thing it's the same
[2:15:21] it's the same way it was in Egypt and
[2:15:23] God never did deal with Israel till she
[2:15:24] come back to her Homeland are you ready
[2:15:29] now now sit still we're going to bring
[2:15:31] the power no we got the punch coming
[2:15:33] out heam says he said hear
[2:15:37] me thus sayith the
[2:15:41] Lord God will not deal with his church
[2:15:44] till she comes back to the Homeland the
[2:15:47] message of the hour amen
[2:15:52] it's just sayth the
[2:15:56] Lord come back to the original get away
[2:15:59] from your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[2:16:01] ideas your Pentecostal assemblies
[2:16:03] Oneness tress Fess whatever it is Church
[2:16:05] of God Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Church
[2:16:07] of Christ all Antichrist movements and I
[2:16:11] realize this strikes the word all wrong
[2:16:13] all of the devil High there Godly men in
[2:16:15] every one of them there's godly people
[2:16:17] in every one of them but the
[2:16:18] organization itself is not of God and
[2:16:20] God will never bless them amen he never
[2:16:21] has done it amen it's thus sayith the
[2:16:26] Lord all right let's go back to the way
[2:16:28] that God gives us
[2:16:32] Revelation okay there's a way that he
[2:16:34] gives you the Revelation this Bible is a
[2:16:37] revelation let me read something for you
[2:16:41] that you could see I'm going to dwell on
[2:16:43] that just a little bitty bit so
[2:16:47] that everyone could see and
[2:16:52] what we're talking about is that all
[2:16:53] right because now we're going to go into
[2:16:55] how God gives
[2:16:58] us the
[2:17:00] Revelation yeah here I got it the angel
[2:17:02] give it to me let me read that for you
[2:17:04] I'm sorry I taken so much time but I'll
[2:17:06] read
[2:17:07] it is that all
[2:17:09] right it's in the message be not afraid
[2:17:13] he says now I regard you all as my
[2:17:15] friends and my brothers and sisters I I
[2:17:17] expect to spend eternity with within
[2:17:19] glory and if if you disagree with me on
[2:17:21] my teaching that's perfectly all
[2:17:25] right he didn't stop there right but I
[2:17:28] believe if you search your Bible real
[2:17:30] good you'll find out it's on the mark
[2:17:32] Cuz first the angel of the Lord came to
[2:17:33] me and taught it to me then he showed me
[2:17:36] in the Bible we to find it I've got to
[2:17:38] find the first man that get down it and
[2:17:40] that's been for years it's the truth yes
[2:17:43] sir what you minister in this age could
[2:17:46] stand before the people and say the
[2:17:47] angel of the Lord came to me and give me
[2:17:49] this this this this this and and then
[2:17:51] then the purifier come and confirm it
[2:17:53] listen Church the entire Revelation came
[2:17:56] to one man Elijah truly shall first come
[2:18:01] and restore what restore it many people
[2:18:06] don't believe that I remember I was in a
[2:18:08] church in Ean buul in
[2:18:11] Turkey I was preaching a message on the
[2:18:13] restoration of all
[2:18:15] things the pastor of course let me
[2:18:18] preach and he told me said brother fuson
[2:18:20] go ahead whatever is on your heart
[2:18:21] preach you want to talk about whatever
[2:18:23] preach I took my
[2:18:27] Bible I said the Bible says Elijah truly
[2:18:29] shall first come and restore all things
[2:18:31] and then I look at the congregation I
[2:18:33] said who is going to restore all
[2:18:35] things a congregation said
[2:18:38] Jesus I says Jesus said Elijah shall
[2:18:41] first come and restore all things who is
[2:18:43] going to restore all things they said
[2:18:47] Jesus I called the Pastor said pastor
[2:18:50] come
[2:18:52] he came I said read it out of your Bible
[2:18:54] for the congregation he read it out of
[2:18:56] his Bible for the congregation and the
[2:18:58] congregation will not accept it if Jesus
[2:19:02] said Elijah truely shall first come and
[2:19:04] restore all things that word from the
[2:19:06] mouth of Jesus is D yet the Lord and he
[2:19:08] is not coming to restore some
[2:19:12] things and it's not going to be Elijah
[2:19:14] bless somebody else amen get that thing
[2:19:17] out of your mind amen it's Elijah and
[2:19:20] Elijah alone el If he if he restore
[2:19:24] 99.9% and somebody restore
[2:19:28] .00% then the CH of the Bible is wrong
[2:19:30] he got to restore
[2:19:33] all all means all we don't have to
[2:19:36] interpret it or explain it all means
[2:19:40] all but that doesn't mean that say
[2:19:43] that's what they do to try to get WR it
[2:19:44] but it doesn't mean that it means
[2:19:46] exactly what it says and it says what it
[2:19:48] means Elijah will rest and we believe
[2:19:51] that oh
[2:19:53] we no we won't go into out of that the
[2:19:55] restoration of all
[2:19:58] things but let's get back to what we
[2:20:00] seeing here and how God reveals it to
[2:20:02] you because we need Revelation
[2:20:05] amen all
[2:20:07] right
[2:20:09] um oh oh this is so wonderful are you
[2:20:13] being
[2:20:15] blessed all right we
[2:20:18] need now let me read something for you
[2:20:21] here
[2:20:22] quickly um that's all right I think you
[2:20:25] you being blessed aren't
[2:20:27] you huh could you say Amen to that we're
[2:20:32] being blessed thank the Lord for that
[2:20:34] now brother man goes on he said the
[2:20:35] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[2:20:37] today is just the same as it was back in
[2:20:38] the day for Lord it is receiving the
[2:20:40] word of Truth for the day in which you
[2:20:42] live now we get back to that and
[2:20:44] receiving the word in a little bit Jesus
[2:20:45] never did stress the importance of the
[2:20:47] works as he did the word he knew that if
[2:20:50] the people got the word The Works would
[2:20:52] follow that is Bible you get the word I
[2:20:54] get the word The Works would follow wor
[2:20:56] with
[2:20:57] works I don't have to worry about God
[2:21:00] blessing me if I walk in his way and I
[2:21:04] stay with his truth he's got to bless me
[2:21:06] he's under obligation to bless the man
[2:21:08] that will stay with his word he's got to
[2:21:09] keep his word
[2:21:12] amen he's got to keep it he can't do
[2:21:15] anything else I wish I had more time to
[2:21:17] get into that go
[2:21:19] ahead some that I'm thinking in My Heart
[2:21:22] Lord should I really ask God for this
[2:21:23] should I really ask God for that because
[2:21:25] I believe if I ask him for it how you
[2:21:27] give it to
[2:21:29] me he gives it to even if it's against
[2:21:31] his own perfect
[2:21:33] will look let's not going into all of
[2:21:36] that it's all right you know that you
[2:21:38] know that the truth look at Hezekiah so
[2:21:40] put your house in order because you're
[2:21:42] going to die what did Hezekiah do
[2:21:44] imagine a major prophet came to Hezekiah
[2:21:46] what would you do if you were in that
[2:21:47] condition and he told him put your house
[2:21:49] in order you're going to die
[2:21:51] you're going to fall in your knees Lord
[2:21:52] help me you know Lord help me but look
[2:21:55] at Hezekiah pray said Lord you know that
[2:21:56] I have served
[2:22:00] you what a perfect heart I've done what
[2:22:03] you want me to do and God didn't say you
[2:22:06] didn't do it God said to to Isaiah go
[2:22:08] back and tell him at 15 years so he
[2:22:10] could put he could put everything when
[2:22:11] he need to put in in
[2:22:14] order see now this might sound a little
[2:22:16] strange but that's the Bible That's the
[2:22:18] Way of God and we can go before the Lord
[2:22:20] father I know I believe your word that's
[2:22:22] not boasting that's telling the truth
[2:22:24] that's right that's why Elijah could
[2:22:26] stand said and said Lord I have done
[2:22:27] this at your command you see if you
[2:22:29] could stand and say Lord I know I've
[2:22:31] stood in your word Lord God I know Lord
[2:22:33] I've made many mistakes but I know I
[2:22:35] believe your
[2:22:37] word hallelujah can we feel that way can
[2:22:39] we give our hand give our hand give God
[2:22:41] praise for that Hallelujah isn't he
[2:22:43] worthy of
[2:22:45] praise praise His wonderful
[2:22:48] name now now let me read this for you
[2:22:51] here as we go on to show you where the
[2:22:54] Revelation is is lacking where we need
[2:22:57] to come back to it all right
[2:23:01] amen I got so much
[2:23:04] here oh this is a strange hour that we
[2:23:08] are living in but let me see here maybe
[2:23:09] the Lord can help me
[2:23:11] here uh yeah I got it
[2:23:15] here
[2:23:17] MH all right let's see yeah are you
[2:23:21] ready amen all right now
[2:23:26] listen but Adam says
[2:23:29] here now we're going to see how God
[2:23:31] gives us
[2:23:32] Revelation now no man knows the things
[2:23:34] of God say the spirit of God unto whom
[2:23:36] the spirit of God reviews them we need
[2:23:38] to call on God for Revelation more than
[2:23:41] anything else in the
[2:23:43] world we
[2:23:46] have accepted the Bible
[2:23:51] we have now that's the first step we
[2:23:53] which we'll get to in a little while we
[2:23:55] have accepted the great truths of
[2:23:57] it but it still is not real to most
[2:24:01] people because the Revelation by the
[2:24:03] spirit is not there the word has not
[2:24:05] been quickened amen but Ram gives an
[2:24:08] example he said the Bible says in 2
[2:24:09] Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the
[2:24:11] righteousness of God by our Union with
[2:24:13] Jesus Christ do you get it it says that
[2:24:16] we are the very righteousness of God
[2:24:19] himself by being in Christ it says that
[2:24:21] he Jesus became sin for us it does not
[2:24:24] say he became sinful but became sin for
[2:24:26] us that by our Union with him we might
[2:24:28] become the righteousness of God for if
[2:24:30] we accept the fact and we must that he
[2:24:32] literally became sin for us by his
[2:24:34] substitution for us then we must also
[2:24:37] accept the fact that we by our Union
[2:24:40] with him have become the very
[2:24:41] righteousness of God Amen to reject one
[2:24:44] is to reject the other to accept the one
[2:24:46] is to accept the other now we know the
[2:24:49] Bible says that it can be denied but the
[2:24:51] revelation of it is missing it is not
[2:24:54] real to the majority of God's children
[2:24:55] it is just a good verse in the Bible but
[2:24:57] we need to have it made alive to us this
[2:24:59] will take Revelation now let me read for
[2:25:01] you a little
[2:25:02] bit here is the word of God
[2:25:06] revealed but there comes a time when God
[2:25:10] gives you the Revelation yes amen now
[2:25:14] when God gives you the Revelation
[2:25:18] something happens because the first
[2:25:21] thing is you you accept the Revelation
[2:25:24] just what God
[2:25:26] says I'm going to skip now because I'm
[2:25:28] if I stop here to read all the qu going
[2:25:30] to take me a lot of time so I'm going to
[2:25:31] just try to hurry as I as I go along
[2:25:34] let's say you hear the
[2:25:36] Revelation you push aside everything
[2:25:38] contrary to that Revelation you realize
[2:25:41] that you cannot get a revelation that
[2:25:43] God has not
[2:25:48] spoken we not talking about prophecy now
[2:25:51] like I could probably get a prophecy you
[2:25:52] can get a prophecy to do certain things
[2:25:54] we're talking about the gift of Prophecy
[2:25:56] here okay an anointing fall on somebody
[2:25:59] and say brother George you need to leave
[2:26:01] tomorrow and go to Texas we're not
[2:26:03] talking about in that sense we're
[2:26:05] talking about the revelation of the word
[2:26:07] we're talking about you having a
[2:26:09] revelation in the in in the word of God
[2:26:12] in the message in the things of God that
[2:26:14] the Bible says we're talking in that
[2:26:16] sense you understand okay now when God
[2:26:19] takes his Revelation to give you the
[2:26:21] Revelation now let
[2:26:23] me um this is something that sounds a
[2:26:26] little strange to you and I need to read
[2:26:28] a quote or two I have to take some time
[2:26:30] and just read a little bit of quote or
[2:26:31] two to you on that okay
[2:26:40] yes oh but the devil's really fighting
[2:26:44] me tonight I I had it written out here
[2:26:51] it's I should have it I'm sorry Church
[2:26:54] please just pray for me that the
[2:26:57] Lord yes I got it
[2:27:00] now the devil is really trying to get me
[2:27:03] a little upset here on that but that's
[2:27:04] all right I got it are you ready now
[2:27:09] amen okay when the truth of a promised
[2:27:12] word of God has been truly revealed to
[2:27:14] his Saints that's filled with oil they
[2:27:16] all
[2:27:18] get they all get
[2:27:41] stimulated give me a
[2:27:43] revelation is that true
[2:27:52] when the truth of a promised word of God
[2:27:53] has been truly revealed to his Saints
[2:27:56] that's filled with oil they all
[2:28:00] get they all
[2:28:03] get Hallelujah let me see the hands of
[2:28:06] all those who got a stimulation
[2:28:09] Hallelujah glory to
[2:28:11] God Jesus what do you do when you got a
[2:28:14] stimulation on Hallelujah you get like
[2:28:16] David my cup is pull and running over
[2:28:19] running oh brother god let's continue
[2:28:23] here see stimulated with joy shout see
[2:28:27] and what it what it does it has the same
[2:28:29] effect upon them that wine upon a
[2:28:32] natural man you ever see a man with have
[2:28:34] you ever seen a man with a lot of wine
[2:28:36] in him and he's standing like this
[2:28:39] listen my father was a drunk and I'll
[2:28:41] tell you the truth when you meet a drunk
[2:28:43] the drunk doesn't have to tell you I am
[2:28:44] drunk you see all the signs in him off a
[2:28:48] drunk come on church we all know that
[2:28:51] he's staggering he can't walk right he
[2:28:53] go like this he goes like
[2:28:56] that and you know the reason he's doing
[2:28:59] it is because he had too much wine or
[2:29:01] too much bear to this bears with they
[2:29:03] drink or too much alcohol whatever it is
[2:29:05] like I remember I was in grenado once in
[2:29:07] a missionary trip and I saw little a
[2:29:09] little place there brother I saw a place
[2:29:12] there and it's my cane juice so I got a
[2:29:14] little curious I said let something
[2:29:16] sweet here maybe some kind of a drink
[2:29:17] they selling I walked into that place
[2:29:19] and I said what is the can juice and he
[2:29:21] showed me all those bottles of alcohol
[2:29:24] there boy I got out of that place as
[2:29:26] fast as I
[2:29:29] could all right so brother Bram says
[2:29:32] here he continues he said because when
[2:29:37] the Revelation has been given of a truth
[2:29:39] of God and the True Believer filled with
[2:29:42] oil come on and listen to this now and
[2:29:47] the
[2:29:48] Revelation is is revealed yes Lord
[2:29:56] amen the stimulation becomes so great
[2:29:59] that he makes him behave himself
[2:30:05] unnormal come on Church you know I think
[2:30:08] some of us when we get to Revelation
[2:30:09] tonight some of us is going to begin to
[2:30:11] believe a little a little
[2:30:12] different than how we came in come on
[2:30:15] Amen
[2:30:17] see because
[2:30:20] and the Revelation is revealed the
[2:30:21] simulation becomes so great that he
[2:30:23] makes him behave himself un normally
[2:30:24] right Glory see that's what's the matter
[2:30:26] with them now that's right makes them be
[2:30:28] behave themselves unseemingly now let me
[2:30:30] get to something here and how he gets
[2:30:31] the Revelation I want to try to finish
[2:30:33] up with this I'm going to read it for
[2:30:35] you are you
[2:30:39] ready are you do you want me to stop
[2:30:44] here keep going sir all right now
[2:30:48] here he's talking about Brother P giv
[2:30:51] the illustration of when Jesus was on
[2:30:53] met the disciples on the road to
[2:30:56] EMAs okay and he read the scripture we
[2:30:58] won't go back and read the scripture one
[2:30:59] have more time and it says
[2:31:01] here he says they walked on the road
[2:31:04] down to the little city IM just a few
[2:31:07] mile or two down there a Sabbath's day
[2:31:09] Journey or something the first he
[2:31:11] revealed the promised scripture of
[2:31:14] himself to them for that day now notice
[2:31:18] when Jesus comes on the scene
[2:31:20] if we want to see him and talk with him
[2:31:24] after his resurrection like they did
[2:31:26] like they saw him the first thing he did
[2:31:29] to them was reveal himself to them by
[2:31:33] the scriptures that's right
[2:31:35] amen
[2:31:41] amen then he goes on he said always the
[2:31:45] churches gets that all scrupled
[2:31:46] up and they all get out and man has
[2:31:50] inject what they believe about it you
[2:31:51] have some people this is what I believe
[2:31:54] Lord help me Lord help
[2:31:56] us I don't want to know what you think
[2:31:58] and what you believe it means nothing to
[2:31:59] me I want to know what God say man shall
[2:32:01] not live by what he thinks and what he
[2:32:03] thinks man shall live by every word and
[2:32:05] come out
[2:32:10] [Music]
[2:32:13] God you said brother BR make statements
[2:32:15] like that the angel of the Lord was with
[2:32:17] brother Bram to give him the revelation
[2:32:23] to me what I believe has to be what the
[2:32:25] Bible say has to be what the prophet say
[2:32:27] to me I deny myself I deny my thoughts I
[2:32:31] deny my reasoning I deny what I think
[2:32:34] the first thing he does when he comes to
[2:32:36] you is to reveal to you his word give
[2:32:40] you the make give you the revelation of
[2:32:42] himself by the scriptures amen now that
[2:32:44] doesn't stop there that's right let's
[2:32:46] continue
[2:32:48] here he says always the churches get at
[2:32:51] all scrupled up and they get out and man
[2:32:53] has to inject what they believe about it
[2:32:56] and this one says well I believe a
[2:32:58] little different from that and he makes
[2:33:00] him something and this one has got to do
[2:33:02] something and each one has a tower
[2:33:05] excuse
[2:33:06] me excuse me Church
[2:33:09] Hallelujah now why did we come out of
[2:33:11] the denomination it's because of this
[2:33:13] uhhuh go
[2:33:15] ahead we came out of the denomination to
[2:33:18] escape man's ideas yes that's right I'll
[2:33:20] we denomination to escape man's ideas to
[2:33:23] go back into man's ideas we have a
[2:33:25] message came down and confir the truth
[2:33:29] just like Moses if you were in the time
[2:33:31] of Moses you have to come out of all
[2:33:32] that Egypt and all of that come
[2:33:34] out amen amen prise the
[2:33:42] Lord and oh something that they got to
[2:33:44] build always trying to add something to
[2:33:47] do something and say that we did this or
[2:33:49] that's the way you that is the way you
[2:33:51] got confused then you sit in the meeting
[2:33:53] and wonder in your mind well how come
[2:33:55] this and how come that and I don't
[2:33:57] understand this and I don't see that and
[2:33:59] I and I don't blame you because I have
[2:34:01] sit in meetings already and I heard
[2:34:02] people people explain stuff and say
[2:34:04] stuff and I wondering I just going to
[2:34:06] condemn the brother but the real truth
[2:34:08] of it is it's not the message the
[2:34:10] prophet did not bring it that's it's not
[2:34:13] in the Bible amen amen amen amen amen we
[2:34:19] can go to many illustrations but I won't
[2:34:21] take time on that but goes on here he
[2:34:23] says and we found out that he revealed
[2:34:25] himself to cleopas and his friend here
[2:34:28] it's Unknown by name the other party but
[2:34:30] it was clear P we know that and he
[2:34:32] revealed himself to them by the
[2:34:34] scriptures notice how he said amen
[2:34:37] notice they called him a prophet you
[2:34:39] know and these things in Jesus of
[2:34:41] Nazareth where B goes on and then they
[2:34:43] had recognized the one they were talking
[2:34:45] about of being a prophet so when they he
[2:34:47] was there they said that Jesus of
[2:34:48] Nazareth who was a proph Mighty in work
[2:34:50] and deeds then but they didn't recognize
[2:34:53] here he was among them he's sending them
[2:34:54] the scriptures he's showing them now
[2:34:57] what man goes on which he was the word
[2:35:00] and was revealing him by mouth the word
[2:35:02] that was written of him and he begin and
[2:35:04] he started from Moses and explained to
[2:35:07] them all that the prophets had said
[2:35:09] about him oh my how he made it known for
[2:35:12] that age fools slow of
[2:35:15] heart knowing that Moses and all the
[2:35:17] prophets said that Christ m and enter
[2:35:20] into his glory see and for that age that
[2:35:22] was was supposed to take place see
[2:35:24] revealing the written word for them
[2:35:26] taking the Bible showing them here it's
[2:35:28] written in the Bible this is what and
[2:35:30] look it happened David said that this is
[2:35:33] what supposed to be they Fierce my hands
[2:35:35] and my feet here this this is what the
[2:35:37] Bible says this is what happened this is
[2:35:39] what the Bible says this is what
[2:35:40] happened this is where the word of God
[2:35:42] says this is what happened it's the same
[2:35:44] thing he did in this age look here is
[2:35:45] where the Bible says the seeds are
[2:35:47] supposed to open they are open amen has
[2:35:50] to restore the F of the fathers he did
[2:35:53] restore the F of the fathers the
[2:35:55] ministry in the day that the son of man
[2:35:56] is being revealed son Man Came long and
[2:35:59] is revealed himself here it is said here
[2:36:01] it is being
[2:36:04] done
[2:36:05] hallelujah Glory let's
[2:36:08] continue than you Jesus oh I don't think
[2:36:11] I'll be able to finish oh Lord help
[2:36:15] us it it's happening before them and you
[2:36:17] know what they do they hold on to the
[2:36:19] promise reject
[2:36:21] reject
[2:36:23] wow the
[2:36:25] manifestation and when they do
[2:36:28] that
[2:36:30] look oh Lord they claimed that they had
[2:36:34] believed and that they were his
[2:36:36] disciples they loved him they believed
[2:36:37] it and he was standing right among them
[2:36:39] interpreting the word what he was and
[2:36:41] still didn't know it just think of that
[2:36:44] they didn't know it and him standing
[2:36:45] there himself written in written in the
[2:36:47] scripture and goes back and picks up the
[2:36:49] scripture have been written for hundreds
[2:36:50] of years concerning him and telling how
[2:36:53] he must do and these things and walked
[2:36:56] around and say they didn't see it what a
[2:36:59] picture of this they same now they
[2:37:01] claimed they believe that he had raised
[2:37:03] from the dead but when he appears to
[2:37:05] show himself they didn't believe it see
[2:37:08] yet they claimed they believe it oh yes
[2:37:10] we believe he rose the third day let him
[2:37:12] do something to show he raised the third
[2:37:15] day oh I don't believe in that see there
[2:37:17] you are the same thing
[2:37:20] amen but B
[2:37:23] continues he said now
[2:37:26] notice he said they didn't see it even
[2:37:31] when he explained to them they sit right
[2:37:32] there they heard a six- hour message and
[2:37:34] prophecy being fulfilled but B said
[2:37:36] still didn't see it here what he says he
[2:37:38] says he couldn't do it by preaching them
[2:37:40] the
[2:37:41] word it went over the top of their
[2:37:44] head people think that if they sit in a
[2:37:48] meeting oh my
[2:37:50] and they hear a preacher
[2:37:52] preaching telling them all the
[2:37:54] scriptures that are
[2:37:56] fulfilled it will be enough it's not
[2:37:58] enough amen people
[2:38:01] think that's how the people think today
[2:38:04] that's they miss an important element of
[2:38:07] Revelation that's why when the
[2:38:09] difficulties hit them they go back am
[2:38:12] because they heard the Revelation but
[2:38:14] they didn't receive the revelation
[2:38:20] you see which we'll get to in a little
[2:38:22] bit I'm I'm trying to hurry now brother
[2:38:24] Bram says here he couldn't do it by
[2:38:26] preaching them the word it went over
[2:38:28] their head him walking on there saying
[2:38:31] well you ought to know there and you
[2:38:32] fool slow of heart the Bible said these
[2:38:34] things that Christ must do these things
[2:38:36] and so forth walking along there well
[2:38:38] look like they they would have seen who
[2:38:40] it who he was they didn't but mam goes
[2:38:44] on to say he says we found out that the
[2:38:46] only way he can reveal is to come
[2:38:50] into
[2:38:51] you thank you Lord how does he come into
[2:38:58] you how does he get into
[2:39:01] you then he can reveal
[2:39:03] himself brother goes on he is he can
[2:39:08] he's the word amen and the word in you
[2:39:12] then the Holy Spirit reveals Christ
[2:39:14] through the word after he gets in you he
[2:39:17] is in you you must take his word so the
[2:39:22] first thing is you open up and invite
[2:39:25] him abide with
[2:39:28] us abide with us we need you
[2:39:32] Lord amen now as you open up what are
[2:39:36] you doing you're crying you're begging
[2:39:38] him you're pleading with him to abide
[2:39:41] with you Lord Jesus come in me how do
[2:39:44] you accept him in in you but bam says
[2:39:47] you open your heart for the Word of
[2:39:51] Promise for your day and you accept it
[2:39:55] so you accept the Revelation amen when
[2:39:58] you accept the Revelation it does not
[2:40:01] mean that it is revealed to you it just
[2:40:04] means you have accepted the Revelation
[2:40:06] this is the manner that God
[2:40:09] works you have accepted it I have
[2:40:13] accepted the Revelation I believe what
[2:40:16] the prophets say amen I believe what the
[2:40:20] Bible say I believe I have recognized it
[2:40:23] to be the truth and I believe it that is
[2:40:27] not enough amen I'm not hearing any amen
[2:40:31] and that's fine
[2:40:36] amen this as far as many people go but
[2:40:40] I'm happy because I believe the
[2:40:46] message the devil believe to
[2:40:49] that's right what he have no
[2:40:52] Revelation the prophet said he has a
[2:40:54] knowledge but no Revelation that's right
[2:40:56] yes amen yes amen that's why when the
[2:41:00] Trials come and problems come you see
[2:41:02] them drift back they didn't have no
[2:41:04] Revelation what is this Revelation
[2:41:05] you're talking about brother
[2:41:07] Ferguson you see there is only one way
[2:41:11] you and I could get the
[2:41:15] revelation God God had to meet Moses
[2:41:19] Moses had the
[2:41:21] Scrolls Moses believed he was to be the
[2:41:23] deliverer Moses believed all of
[2:41:27] that but there was something lacking in
[2:41:29] Moses what Moses lacked the pillar of
[2:41:32] fire had and then Moses met that Pillar
[2:41:34] of Fire that pill of fire gave Moses
[2:41:37] what he La when you meet God God gives
[2:41:41] you you can say I've accepted the Bible
[2:41:43] I've accepted all the truths of the
[2:41:45] Bible I believe the Bible I believe it
[2:41:48] I've accepted all the truth that is not
[2:41:51] enough the Revelation has to come and
[2:41:53] when the Revelation comes Oh Glory to
[2:41:57] God when God steps in when you begin to
[2:42:00] realize with all your heart that this
[2:42:03] Revelation is what God saying is what
[2:42:06] the Bible says it's what the messenger
[2:42:08] say it's not somebody saying I have a
[2:42:11] little private Revelation all of that
[2:42:13] has to be cast out of the
[2:42:16] window and there little explanations and
[2:42:18] all the stuff I believe this and I think
[2:42:20] that all of that you know what church
[2:42:23] all of those things should be dead Among
[2:42:25] [Music]
[2:42:25] [Applause]

[2:42:32] unbelief and we got our an ideas and we
[2:42:34] got this and we got that and we call in
[2:42:36] our idea Revelation and we call it
[2:42:38] somebody preached something from the
[2:42:39] hand of pet and we never heard of in our
[2:42:41] life and we call it a
[2:42:43] revelation one brother told his

[2:43:05] age amen
[2:43:07] now when you open your
[2:43:09] heart and you accept
[2:43:12] him just like brother Brandon says the
[2:43:15] woman at the
[2:43:16] well when Jesus stood there
[2:43:21] and he told her you had five husbands
[2:43:24] she looked at him and she recognized
[2:43:26] right then that he was a prophet she saw
[2:43:30] the word
[2:43:32] fulfilled and when she accepted that
[2:43:35] then he gave it a revelation he said I
[2:43:38] who am speaking to you I am he I am he
[2:43:41] glory to God she what did she do she
[2:43:44] accepted it and when she accepted it
[2:43:46] brother bam says he was already in the
[2:43:48] inside he got in how does he get in you

[3:00:16] SC I know you wouldn't do it but that's
[3:00:19] all right anyway there was a a patch of
[3:00:22] ginger in the forest here I don't know
[3:00:24] why but scorpions love you know Ginger
[3:00:27] batches those gingers is in the grass
[3:00:29] family I went there with my machete
[3:00:31] craft until I get a be of Scorpion I
[3:00:33] took a while ran in his back cut this
[3:00:35] thing out with a p had all those blood
[3:00:37] but the poisonous cut the little thing
[3:00:41] in the front that that little
[3:00:43] uh in the front cut his feet off put
[3:00:46] some butter on him and I roast him in
[3:00:47] the fire I eat him so I told it to the
[3:00:49] people in
[3:00:52] Africa would you eat cion with me I will
[3:00:56] not invite you to that you know why I
[3:00:58] can't invite you because I told that
[3:01:01] story about you and there was a little
[3:01:03] brother I didn't know as a little kid he
[3:01:06] was probably eight or nine years old so
[3:01:07] you heard me after the meeting I told
[3:01:09] him I says would you want to eat this
[3:01:11] cop un P Ferguson the port little guy
[3:01:13] you know being his Pastor he loved me a
[3:01:15] lot you know he didn't want to say no to
[3:01:16] me so the PO kid didn't know what to
[3:01:18] answer and then his father standing
[3:01:20] there and his father accorded the
[3:01:21] scripture he says Jesus said if one of
[3:01:24] your sons asked you for a bread would
[3:01:26] you give him a
[3:01:27] scorpion and that cured me sister hary I
[3:01:30] will not ask no kid to eat scorpion with
[3:01:33] me anyway I told that
[3:01:35] story so after I told that story Ingo my
[3:01:38] friend and
[3:01:40] Buddy and now this doesn't mean that all
[3:01:42] Africa eat snakes there are some tribes
[3:01:44] eat snakes and some doesn't but he was
[3:01:46] from one of those tribes that atat snake
[3:01:49] so he took me to a restaurant now and he
[3:01:52] was my buddy but my bosom friend and so
[3:01:56] he ordered the meal because he was a
[3:01:57] wealthy man and uh so he told me he said
[3:02:00] you eat a scorpion I said yeah he said
[3:02:02] what if you eat a scorpion he say you
[3:02:04] can eat snake I says well I don't think
[3:02:06] so I says and I says I rather a scorpion
[3:02:09] than the snake so he said to me he says
[3:02:13] but brother Ferguson you becoming an
[3:02:15] African now so you have to become one of
[3:02:17] us he said the he said the python steak
[3:02:20] is the most tender meat you can eat he
[3:02:23] said it's more tender than any other
[3:02:24] meat you can eat
[3:02:26] I I said I said I understand you said
[3:02:29] but I rather not because not anything
[3:02:31] but you know I don't like I don't like
[3:02:33] snake that's just me so anyway he said
[3:02:36] you know what he says I'm going to
[3:02:37] purchase it he says taste it he said if
[3:02:39] you don't like it he said I'll eat it so
[3:02:41] I said boy he's going to finish he's
[3:02:42] going to finally convince me to eat
[3:02:45] snakes I said I know what I got to do
[3:02:47] something to stop this I said brought
[3:02:48] anyway he said yes I said could be
[3:02:50] blessed what God has
[3:02:55] cursed I said didn't God curse the SN
[3:02:58] curse the snake he said yes I said well
[3:03:01] how could we bless that he said I never
[3:03:04] thought of that now listen close now
[3:03:08] listen to this he says I said yeah I
[3:03:11] said and you're trying to say and I'm
[3:03:12] your buddy and friend and you're trying
[3:03:14] to encourage me to eat something that
[3:03:15] God curs he said please brother Ferguson
[3:03:18] forgive me for it and when he said that
[3:03:21] I realized that he was going to make a
[3:03:23] dotion out of that and I
[3:03:26] says but ain't
[3:03:28] I I said that is not the message that's
[3:03:31] not the Bible that's me that's brother
[3:03:34] Ferguson saying that he says what do you
[3:03:36] mean I saids brother the message doesn't
[3:03:38] say that you can't eat snake the Bible
[3:03:41] doesn't say
[3:03:42] that I says you pray over it and you
[3:03:45] want to eat it he says I can't condemn
[3:03:47] you I said you reason why I say that to
[3:03:48] you said but ain't going to keep your
[3:03:50] balance in the word when you hear things
[3:03:52] that's not in the message don't accept
[3:03:54] it it sounds look at how reasonable that
[3:03:58] sounds look at how reasonable I go to a
[3:04:00] congregation and I explain that oh
[3:04:02] brother I can easily form a
[3:04:04] Doctrine like what brother Paul was
[3:04:06] warning us about this morning I can
[3:04:08] easily but when you do things like that
[3:04:10] what do you do you displease God because
[3:04:13] you have formed in a doctrine that
[3:04:15] didn't come from the M of God I told him
[3:04:17] I said listen I says God cursed the
[3:04:19] whole earth because of Adam I said
[3:04:22] should me we should need from the
[3:04:24] earth here's where Church some of the
[3:04:27] stuff sounds so reasonable but if a
[3:04:29] prophet didn't bring it God didn't send
[3:04:32] it Malachi Force to restore all
[3:04:36] things amen I know I'm not popular with
[3:04:39] this kind of preaching right I know that
[3:04:43] that's fine that's fine doing good
[3:04:45] brother
[3:04:47] am could you say amen amen could you
[3:04:51] leave this meeting
[3:04:53] tonight and begin to do what the word of
[3:04:56] God says yes no man know it the father
[3:05:00] say the son reveal it to
[3:05:03] him who rals it to
[3:05:06] you it's not me that's
[3:05:09] right it's not your pastor sir it's not
[3:05:14] your
[3:05:14] brother he says no man the the the
[3:05:17] father
[3:05:19] safe and as the
[3:05:23] son reveals
[3:05:25] him amen we got to take these statements
[3:05:29] serious
[3:05:34] amen and come before the
[3:05:36] son and wait for him to give us the
[3:05:39] Revelation that's why he could tell
[3:05:41] Peter he said fresh and blood didn't
[3:05:43] reveal it to you but my father was just
[3:05:45] in heaven yes amen let's bow
[3:05:49] heads oh God in
[3:05:53] heaven the hour is here
[3:05:57] now we've heard the
[3:06:01] truths we have accepted the
[3:06:05] truths we've confessed to each other
[3:06:07] that we believe what you
[3:06:10] said but now we need to take a step
[3:06:15] further we need to invite you
[3:06:18] to give us the
[3:06:20] Revelation it's true that when we open
[3:06:22] our hearts and receive your word your
[3:06:24] Prophet tell us we have invited you
[3:06:27] in as you said if my word abide in
[3:06:32] you then father we have accepted your
[3:06:35] word just like the woman at the well
[3:06:37] when she says I received that thou art a
[3:06:40] prophet she accepted
[3:06:42] it but father you made that set that
[3:06:45] other step and the other step was to
[3:06:48] give her a
[3:06:50] revelation that rivers of living water
[3:06:53] could flow from her then down into the
[3:06:56] city she went as Moses went looking to
[3:06:59] Egypt she went into the city testifying
[3:07:03] yes as your Prophet said she was a house
[3:07:05] she was like a house on fire on a windy
[3:07:08] day Lord oh God
[3:07:12] Heaven the church has just got into a
[3:07:15] time of slumber
[3:07:17] feasting only in what they have
[3:07:20] heard not waiting for the Revelation the
[3:07:24] stimulation the quickening of your word
[3:07:26] as Moses when he met the pillar of fire
[3:07:29] as Paul when he met the pillar of
[3:07:31] fire oh God let it be
[3:07:34] tonight that there be a burden come upon
[3:07:37] the hearts of all of us here tonight to
[3:07:39] scream more than ever for Revelation not
[3:07:43] just one Revelation but for Revelation
[3:07:45] upon Revelation as we realize the
[3:07:48] importance of the word being revealed to
[3:07:51] us we thank you with all our
[3:07:54] hearts in Jesus name
[3:07:58] amen God bless every one of you I love
[3:08:01] you all with all my
[3:08:03] heart and if I said anything tonight
