[39:33] um we pray the Lord to bless our
[39:39] brother and the scripture I'd like to
[39:41] take is in 1 John chapter
[39:46] 5 the
[39:48] epistle John 5
[40:01] and the scripture says whosoever
[40:03] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[40:06] born of God and everyone that loveth him
[40:10] that begot loveth him also that is
[40:13] begotten of him by this we know that we
[40:16] love the children of God when we love
[40:19] God and keep his
[40:21] Commandments for this is the love of God
[40:24] that we keep his
[40:25] Commandments and his his Commandments
[40:28] are not
[40:29] Grievious for whatsoever is born of God
[40:33] does what overcometh the world and this
[40:38] is the victory that overcometh the world
[40:42] even our faith how many Believers here
[40:46] tonight how many has
[40:49] Faith it's your faith that overcomes the
[40:52] world Amen Hebrews 11 check one more
[40:56] scripture
[40:59] now Faith is the substance of things
[41:02] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[41:04] Seen for by it the elders obtain a good
[41:08] report through faith we understand that
[41:11] the worlds were framed by the word of
[41:14] God so that the things which are seen
[41:17] were not made of things which do
[41:19] appear by faith Abel offered unto God a
[41:23] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[41:26] which he obtained witnessed that he was
[41:29] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[41:33] and by it he being dead yet
[41:36] speaketh let's drop down to
[41:39] verse yes our brother quoted this this
[41:42] morning by faith Enoch was translated
[41:45] that he should not see death and was not
[41:48] found because God had translated him for
[41:51] before his translation he had this
[41:53] testimony that he pleased God but
[41:56] without faith fa that is impossible to
[41:58] please him for he that cometh to God
[42:01] must
[42:03] believe that he
[42:05] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[42:12] that diligently seek him let's all read
[42:15] that together verse six but without
[42:17] faith it is impossible to please him for
[42:22] he that cometh to God must believe that
[42:26] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[42:30] that
[42:31] diligently amen that's our desire
[42:34] tonight to diligently seek Him may God
[42:37] add a blessing to the reading of his
[42:38] word you may be
[42:41] seated I will speak to you just for a
[42:44] moment maybe 15 minutes if that's okay
[42:49] on just to encourage your faith a little
[42:52] bit right along with our brother's
[42:54] testimony this morning and along with
[42:57] all of the messages that we've been
[42:59] hearing um we asked you to listen to a
[43:03] portion of the restoration of the brid
[43:05] tree to claim what God has
[43:10] restored to the church the brid tree and
[43:14] what is so nice is that brother Joel is
[43:17] that we are the bride
[43:20] tree and we might lose some things
[43:24] through the cankerworm the caterpillar
[43:26] the Locust but what's beautiful is that
[43:28] we are a brid tree and there was a
[43:31] promise that restoration would come I
[43:35] will
[43:36] restore not sayth the church not sayith
[43:40] you but saith the Lord the Lord will
[43:44] restore the church the good things amen

[43:57] several places that he's dealing with
[44:00] this how he has um the demons are
[44:05] calling out for help for one
[44:07] another and uh there's pages and pages
[44:10] of it several places I should say and I
[44:13] had noted this uh some years ago when I
[44:16] went back to look at it again and did a
[44:19] a different search it even gets even
[44:22] deeper but I have one two three one two
[44:27] three four or five quotes on that that I
[44:30] want to read for you just for a moment
[44:33] and this kind of gives us an opening
[44:36] into how Satan

[48:45] it has to leave here it's defeated out
[48:48] there too have faith dust thou believe
[48:55] amen tremendous isn't it to see how
[48:57] these demons and Devils we can't hear it
[49:01] in the natural but in the spiritual
[49:03] world they're calling for help they're
[49:06] calling to to continue to keep you or
[49:11] the individual bound but God has given
[49:14] us Faith to overcome the
[49:18] enemy and brother randam says it here in
[49:21] this message
[49:24] 1952 early spiritual experiences say he
[49:27] says this here paragraph 27 I want to
[49:30] encourage your heart on the faith that
[49:32] God has given us he says don't think I'm
[49:36] excited now it's got to be a place till
[49:39] you can't listen to
[49:41] nobody you got to listen to God let
[49:45] every man's word be a lie I know more
[49:48] about that now than I ever noted in my
[49:51] life I don't make any difference what
[49:54] people say it's what God say says if it
[49:58] Compares with the word then it's so if
[50:02] the goods is there to produce it because
[50:05] God testifies of his gifts you listen to
[50:08] the preacher sometime you get yourself
[50:10] in trouble some of them anyhow notice
[50:14] they were all muddled up in their
[50:16] Doctrine and Devils out here fortune
[50:19] tellers was the only ones them was out
[50:23] there was the ones that was recognizing
[50:25] him to be what he was and recognizing
[50:29] the apostles to be what they were men of
[50:31] God fortune tellers and Devils so Paul
[50:35] turned around and rebuked that Spirit of
[50:37] divination from the woman she couldn't
[50:40] tell no more fortunes he didn't need the
[50:43] devil to testify who he was he knowed
[50:47] who he was he was God's Saint he didn't
[50:51] need the devil's help but the devil was
[50:54] telling the truth about him anyhow
[50:57] Jesus told that devil said hold your
[50:59] peace but come out of him yes sir he
[51:02] didn't need the devil's help but the
[51:05] devil was screaming so many people
[51:08] talking about now one of these days
[51:11] before I leave now I'm going to preach
[51:12] to you
[51:14] demonology and let you know what demons
[51:17] are you don't realize how they come
[51:20] right face to face with God and plead to
[51:24] come down and do something about it now
[51:27] that's scriptural besides knowing
[51:29] otherwise how right here in the meeting
[51:33] at night when one comes to the platform
[51:37] with an ounce of Faith you hear another
[51:41] one out there screaming for
[51:43] help the one standing here on the
[51:46] platform maybe is dying with cancer
[51:49] another one sitting over there with
[51:51] cancer and this cancer knowing that he's
[51:54] facing knowing that he's facing down
[51:57] here if that woman would only believe
[52:00] what I'm telling and believe Jesus
[52:03] Christ she'll be healed as sure as the
[52:06] world then to throw that woman's Faith
[52:09] off that other demon screams down to her
[52:14] and I catch between them and say there
[52:17] you are both of you
[52:19] believe amen so brother brandom says
[52:22] just one ounce of
[52:25] faith when when Satan sees one ounce of
[52:28] faith those demons start screaming for
[52:31] help now do you have an ounce tonight do
[52:35] you just have a mustard
[52:36] seed sometimes our faith gets a little
[52:39] bit low but we're always
[52:42] Believers we're not more Believers today
[52:44] than we were yesterday we were Believers
[52:47] by God's grace through faith in the
[52:51] purchase one of Calvary the Lamb of
[52:54] Calvary but our faith gets low doesn't
[52:56] it in it we get discouraged sometimes
[52:59] but we're still Believers and if we
[53:01] still got an ounce of faith our faith is
[53:04] what we overcome the world with our
[53:07] faith is what Rises us out of Despair I
[53:11] was thinking of job how the Lord had
[53:14] confidence in job and I thought that was
[53:17] really nice how the Lord can look upon
[53:19] job and say to Satan have you considered
[53:23] him that there's none like him have you
[53:26] considered my servant he asseth evil and
[53:32] he is truly my servant and brother Ram
[53:36] goes on to say how God had confidence in
[53:40] job and I love that I love for the Lord
[53:42] to have confidence in me and then I
[53:45] started to think a little bit more how
[53:47] we should have confidence in one
[53:49] another I should believe the best about
[53:53] you that even if you're doing something
[53:55] in the negative that I have confidence
[53:58] that you're going to come out of it cuz
[54:00] you're a Believer you're my brother
[54:03] you're my sister and we will overcome
[54:08] the world in any tactics of the devil
[54:11] how many believe that this evening uh we
[54:14] do things to hurt one another don't we
[54:17] we do do things against one another and
[54:19] sometimes we say things and we brush
[54:22] against one another but let's have
[54:25] confidence in one another
[54:26] and believe that the good is going to
[54:29] come out
[54:30] anyhow it'll be made right if there's
[54:33] any wrongs
[54:34] amen so have confidence in one another
[54:39] now just before we go to the to the to
[54:42] the Lord's table I wanted to read this
[54:44] this little quote here
[54:46] because that that little um ounce of
[54:50] faith that quote there when the devil
[54:53] recognizes that the platform the an
[54:56] ounce of Faith then he goes and so then
[55:01] we start to think of what is our faith
[55:03] how can I increase that how can I build
[55:06] my faith muscles how can I be stronger
[55:09] and we want to a mechanism tell us
[55:13] listen to this tape and I'll get more
[55:15] faith or read this scripture or come to
[55:18] church three times out of the week and
[55:20] you'll get more faith but I like the way
[55:22] brother randos says this in the message
[55:23] the Queen of Sheba paragraph 115 he says
[55:26] says how many's been in the meetings
[55:28] raise your hands now and see that done
[55:31] raise your hands everywhere certainly it
[55:33] will it's perfect it's
[55:37] God sometimes people have more faith
[55:41] than they think they have you try to
[55:44] make yourself have faith don't do that
[55:47] just humble
[55:49] yourself a man sitting right there the
[55:52] light still around him right there
[55:55] didn't even it's surprised him he had
[55:58] that much Faith that's right but he had
[56:01] it amen isn't that right sir if that's
[56:04] right raise up your hand the man's
[56:06] healed right there that's right it's
[56:07] just surprised
[56:09] you you didn't think you have it it's
[56:13] just simple just believe it
[56:18] amen um I like good surprises and that's
[56:22] a good
[56:23] one I like to think I have more faith
[56:26] and perhaps my mind tells me or my past
[56:30] experiences tell me but sometimes we try
[56:33] to work ourself to Faith and brother man
[56:35] says don't do that just do what humble
[56:39] yourself humble
[56:41] yourself get out of the
[56:43] way amen I got
[56:45] my pug preacher there back again
[56:50] tonight brother Rick the Lord's did a
[56:52] wonderful work in his life and he's
[56:55] excited about it
[56:57] amen if everybody was saying amen he
[56:59] wouldn't bother
[57:01] us we wouldn't even hear
[57:03] him praise the Lord God bless you you're
[57:06] not bothering me now anyway so God bless
[57:09] [Laughter]
[57:11] you all right now he's blushing all
[57:14] right but don't look at him he started
[57:16] it he called himself out so God bless
[57:20] brother Rick I love him so let's let's
[57:23] take this last portion on this message
[57:25] about about Jesus this is in our
[57:29] scriptures in Matthew chapter 4 and also
[57:33] in Luke chapter
[57:36] 4
[57:40] that Jesus in conversation with the
[57:46] devil brother Brandon brings down those
[57:50] tactics that he used in the message
[57:53] Harvest time that we brought to you here
[57:55] before how he tried to uh get him to eat
[57:58] something besides the word that was his
[58:01] first Temptation the second was to offer
[58:05] him uh the second was to offer him
[58:08] something Supernatural and the third
[58:10] tactic that he used if the others fail
[58:13] this one won't fail that was to offer
[58:15] him a position in the
[58:17] church but brother random says this in
[58:20] the message Ministry
[58:23] explain and he says this here paragraph
[58:27] 16
[58:30] 1950 Jesus we all believe he was the son
[58:33] of God is that right we accept him as
[58:35] the Son of God and he was more than a
[58:38] man God was in Jesus God was in Christ
[58:42] reconciling the world to himself and he
[58:45] was a a God man God working through him
[58:49] now but when he met Satan or Satan met
[58:52] him he did not use any of his fine gifts
[58:58] which I believe that in him dwelt all
[59:00] the powers of heaven was in him but he
[59:03] never used any of them to defeat the
[59:05] enemy when he met Satan Satan tempted
[59:09] him he said it's written man shall not
[59:12] live by bread alone then upon the
[59:15] Pinnacle of the temple he met him again
[59:16] with the word of God when he taken him
[59:19] up into the mountain he met him again
[59:21] with the word of God so showing to us as
[59:26] our example that the word of God will
[59:31] defeat the enemy any place anywhere
[59:37] anytime it is written amen prophet of
[59:43] God says it again and my angels shall go
[59:45] before thee
[59:46] 1953 he says this here paragraph number
[59:50] 8 God's word will defeat Satan
[59:53] anywhere any place any time time now
[59:57] when Jesus was here on Earth I believe
[59:59] he was well he was Emmanuel God was in
[1:00:03] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:00:06] so all the great qualities of the father
[1:00:09] was in Christ Jesus the son when he was
[1:00:12] here on Earth all that the father
[1:00:16] was his and all the fine gifts that
[1:00:20] that's in God and all that was in
[1:00:24] Christ par me see all the fine gifts
[1:00:28] that's in God and all that was in Christ
[1:00:31] but when he met Satan he never used any
[1:00:35] of those
[1:00:36] gifts he just to be your example he
[1:00:41] brought it to where the very weakest of
[1:00:43] Christians he said he had the power
[1:00:47] right then to rebuke Satan and send him
[1:00:49] away but what he did he never referred
[1:00:52] to any of his power Satan said if thou
[1:00:55] be the Son of God there's always a
[1:00:58] question mark across God's word by Satan
[1:01:01] so he said if thou be the Son of God
[1:01:03] command these stones to be made bread
[1:01:07] now Jesus said it's written in the
[1:01:09] father's word man shall not live by
[1:01:11] bread alone he taken him up to the top
[1:01:14] of the temple told him to cast himself
[1:01:16] down Jesus said it's written right back
[1:01:19] to the scripture then he taken him up to
[1:01:22] a mountain showed him all the kingdoms
[1:01:24] of the world and said I'll give you it
[1:01:26] if you'll Bow Down and Worship me Jesus
[1:01:29] said it is written see constantly it's
[1:01:33] written it's
[1:01:36] written and then when you can hit Satan
[1:01:39] with the
[1:01:41] scripture he's just as powerless as he
[1:01:44] can be see well if anything I don't care
[1:01:48] what it is now if it isn't within me or
[1:01:51] now it isn't within me or your pastor to
[1:01:54] pray it's for us to pray with you but
[1:01:58] it'll have to be your own individual
[1:02:02] faith that does the
[1:02:04] healing now the UNT Jesus never healed
[1:02:07] anyone without first the father showed
[1:02:10] him about it now he said that that he
[1:02:13] had it last night in John the 5th
[1:02:15] chapter and the 19th verse verily verily
[1:02:17] I say unto you the son can do nothing in
[1:02:19] himself but what he sees the father
[1:02:22] doing watch two Blind Men following him
[1:02:25] one day in the street they were blind
[1:02:26] crying have mercy on us have mercy on us
[1:02:29] he just walked right on he come into the
[1:02:31] house they brought the blind man to him
[1:02:34] the blind man said have mercy on us he
[1:02:36] says do you believe he said yes he
[1:02:39] touched their eyes and said according to
[1:02:42] your faith is that right according to
[1:02:45] your faith be it unto you see and they
[1:02:50] had the faith the woman touched the him
[1:02:52] of His Garment he said thy faith not my
[1:02:56] power thy faith has made thee whole see
[1:03:00] thy faith what but he went and did just
[1:03:04] what the father showed
[1:03:06] him amen so it's your faith tonight it's
[1:03:11] your faith that you overcome by it's
[1:03:14] your faith that's in you now that God
[1:03:16] give you that can sustain you if you
[1:03:20] have to walk all by yourself you can do
[1:03:24] it but look what he's done he's given us
[1:03:27] friends he's given us acquaintances
[1:03:30] brothers and sisters that can shoulder
[1:03:33] some of the burden with us isn't that
[1:03:36] nice that I can shake hands with a
[1:03:38] brother or a sister that's in the same
[1:03:41] battle that I'm in and when I'm
[1:03:44] discouraged they can encourage me and I
[1:03:47] can do the same for them but our faith
[1:03:50] really has the power to overcome all the
[1:03:54] Ws of the devil God give us that faith
[1:03:57] and we thank God for it this is my last
[1:03:59] quote here in Jesus Christ the same
[1:04:01] yesterday today and forever paragraph
[1:04:04] number six he says but when he met Satan
[1:04:08] to let you know that you have this
[1:04:10] Authority he never used one of his gifts
[1:04:14] or any of his power Satan said if thou
[1:04:17] be the Son of God do a miracle here
[1:04:20] before me let me see you he said it's
[1:04:23] written man shall not live by bread
[1:04:24] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:04:27] out of the mouth of God he took him to
[1:04:30] the Pinnacle of the temple and said he
[1:04:32] quoted some scriptures coded it some
[1:04:35] scripture and said Angels bear thee up
[1:04:37] less at any time Dash your foot against
[1:04:40] a stone he said and it's also written
[1:04:45] and he took him upon the mountain and
[1:04:46] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[1:04:48] and said these are mine I'll give them
[1:04:51] to you if you'll worship me
[1:04:55] Jesus said it is written every time he
[1:04:59] Satan comes in he said it is written my
[1:05:04] father said thus my father has said thus
[1:05:08] he defeated Satan on the word of

[1:06:17] tonight I'm going to move over to
[1:06:20] this other mices
[1:06:32] as we can turn into scriptures
[1:06:35] to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:06:38] 11 we stand to our
[1:06:51] feet before we read let's just bow our
[1:06:53] heads just on those few words that we
[1:06:55] spoke here on faith just an ounce of
[1:06:59] Faith you say
[1:07:02] Lord help me to recognize the the ounce
[1:07:05] of Faith the faith that you put in me
[1:07:08] that it will defeat Satan anywhere any
[1:07:11] place any time if I apply that Faith to
[1:07:15] the word of
[1:07:17] God I want you to meditate on think
[1:07:19] about that just for a moment and if
[1:07:22] that's your desire that's your prayer
[1:07:24] why don't you raise your hand to him him
[1:07:26] and say Lord grant that to
[1:07:30] me to raise me out of whatever the
[1:07:34] circumstance is it'll be by faith that
[1:07:38] we
[1:07:39] overcome father in the name of Jesus
[1:07:42] Christ not for a form or fashion but
[1:07:46] it's a declaration of
[1:07:48] believers who claim a Divine promise
[1:07:52] that was just read out of your word
[1:07:54] through an unworthy vessel here but your
[1:07:59] word is worthy and it demands and it
[1:08:03] commands the authority over heavens and
[1:08:06] earth it's your word nothing greater
[1:08:09] nothing more powerful nothing more true
[1:08:12] nothing more real than your word and
[1:08:15] Lord we claim these promises on our life
[1:08:19] Lord we claim the healing that we need
[1:08:21] not just in our bodies but in our minds
[1:08:25] in our souls Lord in our spirits to be
[1:08:30] healed to be risen up oh God we thank
[1:08:35] you that we have a pure word to stand
[1:08:38] upon we're not hoping we're not guessing
[1:08:42] as we come to the table we're not hoping
[1:08:46] but we know that we have the correct
[1:08:49] interpretation of your word because you
[1:08:51] revealed it to us it is not a boast Lord
[1:08:54] we're not bragging it's just what it is
[1:08:57] you you have you have you have saved us
[1:09:02] and you have made us
[1:09:04] glad you given us the joy of the word
[1:09:09] and we know Lord in this life we have
[1:09:11] our disappointments and
[1:09:14] discouragements
[1:09:16] misunderstandings but Lord you give us
[1:09:18] something more
[1:09:19] valuable than gold or silver you give us
[1:09:23] faith and a predes at seed to recognize
[1:09:27] your word Lord I pray you'll raise up
[1:09:30] our young people out of whatever
[1:09:34] discouragement the young men young
[1:09:37] Brothers the elders the board members
[1:09:40] even the pastor of the church that
[1:09:43] you'll raise them out of their
[1:09:45] discouragement and
[1:09:47] despair even through our faith which is
[1:09:50] our victory that overcomes the world and
[1:09:53] Lord I pray that you'll cleanse us us
[1:09:55] right now from all
[1:09:58] unrighteousness as we do this great
[1:10:00] command of your word Lord we believe you
[1:10:03] Lord there's nobody like you and we take
[1:10:06] your word over anybody else's word today
[1:10:10] and Lord we've been put to the test but
[1:10:13] Lord there's nobody like you and we want
[1:10:16] to pass every test Lord for the rest of
[1:10:19] our life Lord whatever would come our
[1:10:21] way as our brother spoke this morning
[1:10:24] Jonah and Abraham and we've been both
[1:10:28] Lord we've been both but Lord we're
[1:10:31] still here because you give us Faith the
[1:10:34] most valuable thing and when Satan sees
[1:10:38] an ounce of Faith he cries for help but
[1:10:43] Lord we show him no pity we rebuke him
[1:10:47] we claim the victory we tread over him
[1:10:52] we defeat him on every territory any
[1:10:55] place
[1:10:56] any time under any circumstance Lord
[1:10:59] give us the grace give us your mercy we
[1:11:03] pray and ask in Jesus
[1:11:05] name we claim it
[1:11:07] now
[1:11:09] amen praise the Lord
[1:11:12] amen amen we'll start with verse number
[1:11:19] 23 I've received of the Lord that which
[1:11:21] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:11:24] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:11:26] betrayed he took bread when he had given
[1:11:29] thanks he break it and said take eat

[1:11:33] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:11:36] me after the same manner also he took

[1:11:52] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:11:54] show the the Lord's death till he come
[1:11:58] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:12:00] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:12:03] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:12:05] and blood of the Lord but let a man

[1:12:50] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:12:52] world wherefore my brethren when you

[1:25:16] take our Bibles and turn to St John
[1:25:20] chapter 13
[1:25:34] this is foot washing part of the
[1:25:43] word we try to take the Lord's Supper
[1:25:46] every 30 days when we
[1:25:49] can and um
[1:25:56] I believe that's the example brother
[1:25:57] random gave
[1:26:02] us but Jesus said as often as you do
[1:26:06] it and along with the Lord's Supper is
[1:26:09] the foot
[1:26:10] washing we'll find that in the
[1:26:12] scriptures here supper being ended the
[1:26:16] devil having now put into the heart of
[1:26:18] Judas scariot Simon's son to betray him
[1:26:22] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:26:24] all all things into his hand that he was
[1:26:26] come from God and he went to God he
[1:26:30] rised from supper he laid aside his
[1:26:33] garments and he took a towel and GED
[1:26:35] himself after that he poured water into
[1:26:38] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:26:41] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:26:44] wherewith he was girded then cometh he
[1:26:46] to Simon
[1:26:48] Peter Peter said unto him Lord does thou
[1:26:51] wash my feet Jesus answered and said
[1:26:53] unto him to him what I do thou knowest
[1:26:56] not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter
[1:26:59] Peter said unto him Thou shalt never
[1:27:01] wash my
[1:27:03] feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:27:06] not thou H has no part with me Simon
[1:27:10] Peter said unto him Lord not my feet
[1:27:13] only but also my hands and my head and
[1:27:16] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:27:19] needeth not safe to wash his feet but is
[1:27:22] clean every wit and ye are clean but not
[1:27:24] all for he knew who should betray him
[1:27:27] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:27:30] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:27:32] had taken his garments and was sat down
[1:27:35] again he said unto them know ye what
[1:27:37] I've done to you you call me master and
[1:27:41] Lord and ye say well for so I am if I
[1:27:45] then your Lord and Master have washed

[1:27:51] another's feet for I've given you an
[1:27:55] example that ye should do as I've done
[1:27:57] to you verily verily I say unto you the
[1:28:01] servant is not greater than his Lord

[1:54:44] five days they don't know what's wrong
[1:54:47] she's at the hospital again
[1:54:49] now and maybe our brother Israel could
[1:54:52] just take this to the Lord before we go
[1:54:55] but just to want to share a testimony
[1:54:58] with you so we've had prayer for my
[1:55:00] mother a few times she's been in the
[1:55:02] hospital um first time that she's had
[1:55:04] covid and so she's been very weak with
[1:55:08] that we went to visit her last night
[1:55:13] and that part of the message restoration
[1:55:18] of the brid tree that our pastor had ask
[1:55:21] us to listen to joy and I had listened
[1:55:23] to that we're just talking about sending
[1:55:25] the enforcer out and and that's been
[1:55:28] such an encouragement such a help to us
[1:55:30] and just today we were listening to a
[1:55:33] song and it was that our God is
[1:55:38] tremendous and the little ailia sung
[1:55:40] here with the choir and and just said in
[1:55:43] that one he's our enforcer and then
[1:55:45] started going through the different
[1:55:47] names of Jehovah he's Jehovah nii and I
[1:55:50] thought you know it's just spot on with
[1:55:52] what we've been hearing here and we live
[1:55:54] so far below our Privileges and so just
[1:55:57] we we just Joy felt to have a little
[1:56:00] prayer with my mom last night and you

[1:56:12] so that that uh we hear that on the tape
[1:56:16] and it was somebody something that was
[1:56:18] stolen from somebody it was their car
[1:56:20] that was stolen and I think we all all

[1:56:24] State Satan has tried to steal my joy
[1:56:26] he's tried to seal my family members my
[1:56:29] son my daughter and let's just believe
[1:56:31] with that here he's trying to steal
[1:56:33] somebody's Health there a high fevers

[1:56:42] call on that enforcer for whatever we
[1:56:44] have need of there's healing in the cup

[1:56:54] come and take these needs to the Lord

[1:56:59] and then we'll just sing a couple more
[1:57:02] songs of of worship let's pray for our
[1:57:05] pastor I me just see Satan's tactics
[1:57:07] he's predictable he's persistent but
[1:57:10] here with special meetings come up
[1:57:12] trying to take his voice away knowing
[1:57:14] the burden The Strain just how nice that
[1:57:19] we want things to be as a church for
[1:57:21] those that are coming out here and it's
[1:57:24] difficult when
[1:57:25] you're want to talk and want to visit
[1:57:28] and want to want to fellowship and you
[1:57:30] don't have the voice to do it so we just
[1:57:32] want to claim a a touch in body for
[1:57:36] brother Israel tonight and amen guys
[1:57:38] good brother Caleb come up if you
[1:57:44] would so we shared the testimony and Mom
[1:57:47] called today and she sounded like a
[1:57:50] different person she had energy
[1:57:52] and um so expect probably tomorrow that
[1:57:56] she'll be released from the hospital and
[1:57:59] so we said she was doing much better she
[1:58:00] was doing much better and we just felt
[1:58:02] the presence of the Lord come in that
[1:58:03] room last night knew that God heard the
[1:58:06] prayer he sent the enforcer and and we

[2:03:29] you would brother Jensen has a testimony
[2:03:32] that he wanted to share with us here
[2:03:33] this
[2:03:44] evening you know I think we all
[2:03:47] appreciated what brother John preached
[2:03:49] this morning
[2:03:52] and U you know I was thinking you know
[2:03:55] brother bam made a statement about Jonah
[2:03:58] and it's one of those little nuggets or
[2:04:02] Jewels but you know
[2:04:05] Nineveh was a very Wicked
[2:04:10] City and I'm a student of revivals for
[2:04:13] the last 40 years or
[2:04:15] more and the Book of
[2:04:19] Jonah is one of the greatest Revival in
[2:04:22] the Old Testament and somewhat in the
[2:04:25] new because when Jonah walked through
[2:04:27] that city the whole city
[2:04:30] repented over 60,000
[2:04:33] people they felt
[2:04:37] conviction and and the whole
[2:04:40] city went to sackcloth and Ashes and
[2:04:43] they even put sackcloth on the animals
[2:04:45] because they were in
[2:04:47] beastiality it's a very Wicked place
[2:04:52] but one thing that's interesting about
[2:04:54] Nineveh is they worship the god
[2:04:58] Deon the fish
[2:05:00] God they live right by the
[2:05:03] Tigers and so picture that in your
[2:05:06] mind if you go back in history in the
[2:05:10] that culture the
[2:05:11] priest was in a garment that looked like
[2:05:14] a fish and they had the little headdress
[2:05:17] that looked like what the pope
[2:05:19] wears fish gun
[2:05:23] and they're out there on the bank of the
[2:05:25] Tigris
[2:05:26] River and they're worshiping their fish
[2:05:29] God
[2:05:30] ding everybody got that in their mind
[2:05:33] and no doubt there was quite a few
[2:05:36] people standing around as they were
[2:05:37] worshiping their fish God and all of a
[2:05:39] sudden this
[2:05:40] fish this specially prepared fish now
[2:05:43] the prophet deals with this on with the
[2:05:47] tapes it swims up to where they're
[2:05:50] worshiping their fish God and the fish
[2:05:53] kind of goes up on the shore and throws
[2:05:56] up a
[2:05:57] prophet and
[2:05:59] [Music]
[2:06:01] he's he's got seaweed all over
[2:06:05] him and he picks himself up and the
[2:06:09] people are
[2:06:13] just a prophet
[2:06:15] just was spit out of their God the
[2:06:19] prophet said no wonder they repented
[2:06:22] cuz Jo Jonah stood up and he kind of
[2:06:24] wiped some off
[2:06:25] and he looks around and
[2:06:29] revent
[2:06:30] repent for God's going to destroy this
[2:06:33] city in 40
[2:06:35] days and he walks through the
[2:06:37] city and I mean people
[2:06:40] repented cuz this God is delivering a
[2:06:42] mouthpiece
[2:06:44] now look that quote
[2:06:46] up I've I've I've studied a lot of
[2:06:49] preachers through history no one came up
[2:06:51] with that
[2:06:52] thought but you know there was something
[2:06:55] Supernatural about
[2:06:58] that cuz God has a
[2:07:01] purpose
[2:07:03] huh and there's a reason they
[2:07:06] repented there's a reason that shook
[2:07:08] that whole
[2:07:10] city because God did something
[2:07:13] unusual very
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:17] unusual a prophet comes out of a fish
[2:07:23] I just had to share that I don't know it
[2:07:24] just you know sometimes things burn in
[2:07:26] your heart and you think God does
[2:07:29] something more he likes to do something
[2:07:31] that's not natural that's right he likes
[2:07:34] to do something that's extraordinary
[2:07:36] because we serve an extraordinary
[2:07:39] God when he comes
[2:07:42] present he can shake a church he can
[2:07:44] shake a family he can shake a city he
[2:07:46] can shake a nation you never know what
[2:07:48] he's going to do
[2:07:51] I know sometimes in this message we hear
[2:07:54] what the prophet said but don't give up
[2:07:56] on this nation
[2:07:57] completely cuz there's little pockets
[2:07:59] and groups of
[2:08:01] people you know I was talking to a man
[2:08:04] that brother Israel wants me to do some
[2:08:06] touchup pain in his house and brother
[2:08:07] Israel I talked to
[2:08:09] him he started talking I told him
[2:08:12] brother Israel is a pastor he says
[2:08:15] really I said yeah I've known him for 20
[2:08:18] years and we started talking about the
[2:08:20] Lord and He said he was he's in his 80s
[2:08:23] early 80s and
[2:08:25] he he uh had been a presbyterian and a
[2:08:28] Methodist and and uh his wife died four
[2:08:33] years ago and you know one thing I love
[2:08:35] to do I like to talk to people that have
[2:08:37] never heard
[2:08:38] nothing
[2:08:40] amen I mean we have such a privilege
[2:08:42] being in the greatest message that's
[2:08:44] ever been upon the face of the Earth
[2:08:46] shame on us if we don't share
[2:08:48] it hello shame on us
[2:08:53] and uh he said you know he said I was in
[2:08:57] church all my
[2:08:59] life but two years ago a
[2:09:01] pastor I was going to a church and the
[2:09:04] Pastor
[2:09:05] said do you know if you died you'd go to
[2:09:08] heaven and it shocked him he couldn't
[2:09:12] answer yes yet been in church
[2:09:13] Presbyterian Methodist and that Pastor
[2:09:18] led him to Christ and he said brother
[2:09:20] Joe I was born again
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:22] and I thought
[2:09:24] wow
[2:09:26] wow and so I shared with him my card so
[2:09:29] he can listen to my our our family's
[2:09:32] testimony but I thought you know maybe
[2:09:35] he'll come here one day and sitting here
[2:09:38] something way different than what he's
[2:09:40] used to how many knows when you come to
[2:09:43] the message sometimes you're in shock
[2:09:45] therapy hello it's shock
[2:09:48] therapy but all of a sudden you realize
[2:09:51] everything I learned on my life I got to
[2:09:53] discard CU
[2:09:54] there's there's something new there's
[2:09:56] something fresh these people have their
[2:09:58] eyes on
[2:10:00] Christ not a building or a
[2:10:03] preacher but you pray for him his his
[2:10:08] name is brother
