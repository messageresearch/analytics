Jesus set [singing and music] me free. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh my. And we've had a wonderful weekend, a wonderful time in the Lord. &gt;&gt; From Friday night, Brother George Smith spoke on keeping a balance and staying with the word. He didn't bring anything new. It was solid. It was sane. It was something you could hold on to. And then Friday uh Saturday morning, brother Trevor Eman spoke on a tremendous message on grace in Romans 7, Romans chapter 8 and bringing the truth of who we are in Christ. Saturday night, brother Ferguson brought that God can't change. His word doesn't change. No matter where you find it, it's the same God. Amen. And then this morning we heard a powerful message on the prophecy that we are that prophecy made manifested. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [applause] Amen. And so we had to deny some of the song specials during the meetings and we culminated it to this [music] last evening service here for this. But before we do, we have the word of the Lord that we want to hear just one more time &gt;&gt; around our faithful brother, uh, Pastor Malcolm Webster. He's from Montreal, Canada. That's where he [music] pastors the church there. He's worked many years with brother Ferguson. He's been a tremendous example to me when I lived up there for two years and beyond. He has just been a real witness and a testimony. His wife is with us, I believe. Sister Elma, if she would raise her hand. There she is right there. We thank the Lord for her. Let's make her feel welcome. Amen. [applause] Praise the Lord. And so, uh, we kind of reversed the service here just so we're going to go to the word first and then we'll go worship afterwards. And so as we prepare to do that, let's sing Amazing Grace as our [music] brother comes. Amen. Amazing [singing] grace, [music and singing] sweet sound that say [singing] like me. like me. I was [music] lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but [singing] now I see. Amen. Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in house of the Lord another time. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling a little lonely up here. But Frank, where are you? Because usually we preach with my translator. So, if you catch, if I if you see me hesitating, it's because I'm waiting for him to translate. But after a while, I'll get used to it. It's good to be with you. The last time we were here was two years ago, and we had a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we enjoyed the hospitalities of the believers, and we thank God it had a great impression upon us. and coming again. I wouldn't mind I've come to listen to brother Israel. &gt;&gt; The last time this last month he was up with us. We had some young people meeting and he preached a wonderful message about Rebecca &gt;&gt; and every time he preach it's sometime I say I could preach like him. But you know, God has his people everywhere. &gt;&gt; It's good to be with you as we listen to the different ministers. And uh you know like in Jesus day, [snorts] the Bible say it was the last day of the feast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Jesus cried and said, "He that is thirsty, let him come." &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something about the last day of the fellowship, you know, it's like in a really you have your first man to start running, the second, but that last man, I don't know. I mean, if you make a wrong move, the whole thing flop [laughter] with all the the great services we had. On Wednesday, we had a wonderful service with Brother Ferguson at our brother's church in Phoenix, and he said, "Come on by." He said, "Uh, your clock isn't turn. Is it? It's It's thinking already. All right. He asked if you can buy the Holy Ghost. And we were wondering where is he getting at? But the scripture said, "Come and buy with money and with a price." &gt;&gt; And he told us we have the purchasing power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which is faith. And then we come and we listen I listen listen to the songs. I listen to the ministers as a minister and then we had the minister's meeting and that was wonderful because you see you see her standing here and minister but you never know what a minister go through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He have his battles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he have to be all things for all men. Amen. &gt;&gt; And many times he can't even tell his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they too have to fight the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know at the last day of the feast with only 27 minutes left and you know uh it kind of a create an anxiety [laughter] not so much for me for me too but at the last day of the feat we began to think our mind began to think of tomorrow &gt;&gt; catching the plane doing this and the other summer saying Lord in a few hours will will be gone and I didn't get the blessing I needed the way I wanted it. All right. &gt;&gt; So it creates something. &gt;&gt; But the Lord know that the brother was going to give me the bottom of the last. God knew everything. But just before our mind turned completely to tomorrow, let us go to Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jeremiah the 18th chapter. Let us all stand. the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words." Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheel, &gt;&gt; and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. So he make it again another vessel that seemed good to the potter to make it. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we thank you for this weekend. You knew everything. You know what we needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you have a purpose in us being here. &gt;&gt; In ourself, we are nothing. &gt;&gt; We as ministers know Lord that whatever we prepare, no matter how much we study to us is like a little child's lunch. But we know if we give it to you, you will take it &gt;&gt; and divide it to your people as you seem fit. &gt;&gt; Into your hands we commit the rest of the service &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So I want you to go with me down to the potter's house. And in there we will see many great wonderful works and also many hearts stopping works. And when we look at it we will realize we are what we are by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the blessings we had for the past week, it was not given to us because of our ability. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans the 9th chapter. As it written, Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So here he spoke about this scripture there. When you look at it, you realize you are what you are by the grace of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; All the blessings you have, all the great sermons we listened to the past weekend, we know it's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It's nothing we done. &gt;&gt; Like you remember, brother Brandham said one time, Abraham as the Lord, he said, I want to see how you're going to save man against his own will. And that man who had as the prophet said an excuse for sin because he will go to the temple with his offering [snorts] and he will leave with the desire to do the same thing. So he said he had an excuse because the bloods of bull and goat could not take away sin. But he says in Calvary, &gt;&gt; you and I can sit here, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; without the desire to sin. &gt;&gt; Now we going down to the bot's house and he put us on that wheel &gt;&gt; so that we will find out, Lord, all that you've done, the effort, was it worthwhile? All the preaching you to listen to the ministers, they were trying to get us to a place so we could be ready for that rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we go down there, the Lord will take you, put you on that wheel. &gt;&gt; And all that's not was in his mind, he's going to remove it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And sometime the preaching seems to be hard, but God is working out something. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as you sit and listen to the minister, sometime you may see a man. But if you take a second look, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's more than just the man there. &gt;&gt; It's God doing something. God getting a people ready. &gt;&gt; So, we had a great some great messages this morning. There was a quote I wanted to bring. I thought I brought it. But somehow I searched for it and I couldn't. And when brother David was preaching, David was his name, right? &gt;&gt; And he quote the exact thing. You see, because God knew &gt;&gt; he knew you were going to be here. It's not a coincidence. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He knew you were going to be there. Let me read something for you from the prophet &gt;&gt; to show you that he knew each and every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to be sitting here. listening to this message. &gt;&gt; He knew I was going to be here. &gt;&gt; We didn't plan that because that's a message we believe. That's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; In a message power of transformation, he said Satan tried to spray it like he did Eve. He tried to spray it, but he failed with his repellent on here. He was a predestinated seed. They couldn't take him into make him a Pharisee or Sadducee. They couldn't make him belong to any organization. He was God's predestinated spoken word. &gt;&gt; Satan couldn't throw his unbelief on him. He has a repellent on him. God spray us with a repellent is my prayer. Then the spirit moved on him and sent him to Calvary to the cross &gt;&gt; to bring light in this day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The light to all the predestinated seed to the church of this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Transforming sons and daughters of God into his presence. Don't stumble that word. &gt;&gt; Predestination. As our brother was preaching this morning about predestination, God chose you. It was not you that chose this message. Look as the prophet told us [snorts] when a baby is born just before that baby is born he said there's a sweetness that gather around the mother &gt;&gt; now when that baby born there is a spirit waiting to get into that baby now did you make a choice of what spirit get into that baby no some people had a great intelligent spirit some don't some have that spirit that are able to accept the word of God for this day. &gt;&gt; It is God's by his mercy, God by his grace that called you. But listen to this here. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't stumble at that word predestination. I've went through that." You see, I want to show you Ephesians 15. You see Jesus, look just as you were in your father. As I said here tonight, just as you were in your father at the beginning, if you wasn't, you wouldn't be here. But you see, it has to go to a bedding ground in order to bring you forth. And now you're his son, you're his daughter. See, it's a seed. If you're a Christian now, a genuine predestinated seed, you were in God before. You always were in God. The germ of your life, which is an attribute of God, which was his thought. He says, so for instance, this pretty little lady sitting here, see, God said, in the day there will be a girl, her name will be so and so. She'll be this thus this and even know the very hour she'll sit and listen at this message dress in a red dress. See that was his thought. Whoever your husband is, whoever he is. And he'll bring this together and you'll sit here in this city at this day. There could be no way for you to fail it because you are growing and as long as your seeds inside growing, you have to produce exactly what the seed said you will do. &gt;&gt; That's exactly it's his word. He keeps his word. He watches over it. You were in your father as a gem and you come forth as a daughter. You, you, you, everyone, brother and sister, you come forth and if you wasn't in your father, you wouldn't have been here. &gt;&gt; You know, it's like um if you and your wife, the brothers, you and your wife walking down the street and this random person come and say, "Daddy," your wife's going to say, "Honey, what's going on?" And then you have to tell him look I don't know him. But then the question remain and she said no no no we have to get a blood test and in this day many people are calling God father &gt;&gt; but the prophet said it's that blood test. &gt;&gt; He said if you wasn't in God as a thought &gt;&gt; you wouldn't be here now &gt;&gt; and there is no way you will be able to get there. So your life, my life, &gt;&gt; we are what we are by the grace of God. As Paul said unto us, and he said unto Pharaoh, this very cause have I raised you up. As the Bible said, in a good man house there are many vessels, vessel of honor, vessel of dishonor. So if you by the grace of God know that you're a vessel of honor, cherish it. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, if you have just a shadow of God, cherish it with all your heart because it was God who decided that. &gt;&gt; Listen as we go on. If you wasn't in God, if you believe the message of the Bible and the present message of the day, a vindication of it, the reason you're sitting here because you were predestinated to sit here. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have been here otherwise. You have been on the street, maybe drunk. Some of you, some of you here running around with some other man's wife &gt;&gt; and you woman out will marry and run around with some other woman's husband or something like that. But you are predestinated to be here. See, you can't help it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a father. &gt;&gt; He is God and you were a seed. [applause] &gt;&gt; So if we hear [cheering] believe in this message, &gt;&gt; you have that ability to receive it the way the messenger receive it from God. Now, that's important. You see, especially for the ministers because the prophet warn us, he said those that go out don't know how necessary it is to say only what the messenger said. They add here, they take away here &gt;&gt; and before long the message is no longer pure &gt;&gt; and they may not realize what it is. &gt;&gt; They might not realize the danger because you see we all looking to go. We looking for rapture. That's our point. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we serve God. &gt;&gt; There is a point in the future when you'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye. But as he said, a church will seldom live higher &gt;&gt; than the pastor preaches. &gt;&gt; He said because that's the pastor you feed offer. And he said the body you're looking for will materialize around the word that's within you. So if we preach that which is not written, then we'll be waiting for rapture that will never take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we travel through time, we see how easy it is for us minister to slip in our own idea &gt;&gt; and that is dangerous. &gt;&gt; But as I listen to the services this past week, we give God thanks. &gt;&gt; You that have ministered that can stay with the word, cherish it. cherish it because the prophet told us the day you take in your heart one word that's not the word of God. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT'S THE day you separate yourself &gt;&gt; from God. Like I told our church, look, if anytime you find us preaching or saying something that's not what that prophecy say, you have the right to come to us because ministers are not the Lord. They are the servant. &gt;&gt; And if you're servant, you serve the people. &gt;&gt; And we must be able to humble ourselves and listen to what they say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the word of the Lord, the word of a prophet take preeminence over everything. &gt;&gt; So I tell them, look, when that time come to make the rapture, you can't blame your pastor &gt;&gt; because God gave you a prophet. So you wouldn't have to hear &gt;&gt; from God second hand. &gt;&gt; You can hear exactly what he said. &gt;&gt; And you, as he said, you're not going to go to restaurant and buy a bowl of soup with a spider. No, you will sue them. But sometime we sit and listen to the minister say any kind of a thing and we say, "Oh, he's a servant of God." The day you put in your heart one word, &gt;&gt; that's not the word of God. Yes, &gt;&gt; you separate yourself from God. &gt;&gt; And as the prophet told us, if you want the truth, God will send someone at the pulpit that will preach the exact truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if I'm looking for a change, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that change will materialize around the words THAT'S WITHIN ME, I MUST be careful in what I receive. We have access to his word &gt;&gt; and did the prophet say we've lost many friends because we try to stay with what that prophet said. But you see [snorts] those of the elect they have the ability to receive what the messenger have already received from God. So when you listen to the brothers preaching, the ministers preaching, we look at a man but the prophet said there is something more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to this. In [snorts] putting on the whole armor of God, preached 1962, the sixth month and the seventh day, paragraph 75. [snorts] He said, "Oh, God make himself present in his army." Then do you believe that? Now God said, "I send them the word. Eve just walk right over the top of it." Disbelieve it. I made it manifest and they're crucified. I'm just getting tired. I'm coming myself. So here he come. God in you. God above us the pill of fire. God with us. Jesus Christ. God in us the Holy Spirit. What is it? Is the same word, the same God. &gt;&gt; No more trusting in anything else. God comes himself. This was a mansized job. So he just brought it down. He come down himself. They won't have to do nothing about it. Just let them surrender to me and I'll walk in them. &gt;&gt; Talk in them. Speak in them. Walk in them. Oh my. That's it. I'll do the do. I'll do the work. Just let them just humble themsel. Let them just empty out and I'll just beat the enemy out there through them. &gt;&gt; That's it. You can't do Joseph now. You're no match for him. But if you'll just let God do it, get the word in you, &gt;&gt; then it'll all be taken care of. That's why we going down to the part of he's going to take us, put us in that wheel and bring back to our memory the things that was said and remember something. When we come across something in the word, in this message &gt;&gt; that stump us, we can't go forward. &gt;&gt; We stop right there. Many people, they disagree with this. They question this and they think they're going on. But no, you stop right there until that is taken care of. He said, "But if they will surrender to me, I will come in &gt;&gt; and I will do the do." &gt;&gt; So as we listen to him, you go back through our mind. Father, did I believe all that was there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did it have an impact on me? &gt;&gt; You see, because the preacher can preach, &gt;&gt; but it's the Holy Spirit that takes the word, place it into the heart of the people. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We just come, we have a listening ear, and he is there. Look at the prophet said it's the veil that keep us from seeing the angel of the Lord at the post of duty. He said it's this veil that keeps the flesh that keep us from seeing Jesus right here right around you. The angels are there. He told us that. We believe that but is this veil. So they are watching over the world. Take that word place it in our heart. But what have we done with it? Here it is. Now God fortify his army. What with himself? In the form of prophets, apostles, teachers, pastors. What did he do? What was God doing? Listen. Did you ever think what that office of the church is? It's God's dress. Inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a seer foresee. Before Satan ever get there, it's done told. What is it? God dressed up in his church. These offices is God's dress wear. When you see these offices, pastors, teachers, evangelists, what it is, that's God's dressear, &gt;&gt; God's presence, God's spirit, and it's working through man. And if that office deny any of the word, then it's not God's dress. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, not that. That's a wolf in sheep clothing. &gt;&gt; Watch that fellow. &gt;&gt; Beware of him. &gt;&gt; What is it? Death is looking here. Satan is trying to destroy the because it's you that's going in the rapture. And you know, one word could change the whole picture. As the prophet said, watch when people come to the Lord, watch the spirit working there. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of a person he will grow up. And in the meeting, we saw the spirit of God as we watch. You see, because you choose a church that will help guide you to your eternal destination. &gt;&gt; So, we're not here by chance. &gt;&gt; God permitted us to be here and we enjoy the service. We enjoy the fellowship. Especially the ministers meeting it was great. As the ministers express themselves realize human being are the same. The only difference is that God gives some people greater responsibility and in this end time if he call you to be a minister is because there's something in you that great otherwise he was going to choose a lesser person but the battle is there. But he promised to give grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometime as the prophet said, we find trials and it seem like we go through trials that we never had when we were out there. &gt;&gt; He said, but God is doing that for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He want a certain dean out of your testimony. He says like this molders molding a special certain bear. He won't put all brass. There's different earth that he put in there because he want a certain ring and trials come, persecution come. Sometime you have to stand alone. But is God testing you? &gt;&gt; He brought you here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; As you listen to the word, it fortifies you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our goal is to make that rapture. &gt;&gt; We'll go through trials. We'll go through persecution. You may have to stand alone. for that which you believe. &gt;&gt; But first of all, believe your prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People question that. &gt;&gt; And but let me ask you something. If they reject this prophet and say he make mistake here, then what kind of a gospel they going to preach? They have to find their own baptism. &gt;&gt; They can't preach sen. They can't preach deity. What are they preaching? They preaching the Bible. The Bible was a closed book. &gt;&gt; But Jude said some men were ordained for this destruction. You can't help it. It's like Balam's donkey. Bam's donkey was a dain for that. That's all we heard of it. After [snorts] Balam, we didn't hear anything about the donkey. You don't know where he came from, but the donkey had to be there to say, "Baum, what have I done? I'm not your donkey. Did I ever act like that before?" It's like that donkey that when Samson needed a weapon. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; That donkey had to be there. You see your purpose of existence, &gt;&gt; you and I, we have a purpose of existence. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that is we have a sacred trust. And that is this message that's given to us that we should not compromise it. &gt;&gt; We must keep it pure. &gt;&gt; But to do that, something must have got a hold of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, there is a power walking beyond the scene. &gt;&gt; All we can see is our lives. But what gives you the power? Look at He said, look, it's like a lid been removed over hell. Demon power streaming everywhere. Conquer the nation. Conquer the churches. But every now and then he said there's a little light. That's the born again. What is it that keep you in this evil day that can sit here &gt;&gt; without the desire of sin? The only reason you can do that is because the supernatural got a hold of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may go through trial, may go through persecution. &gt;&gt; But if God change your life, like he said, you look back to the pit where he called you. You're not that no more. &gt;&gt; Something got a hold &gt;&gt; of you. &gt;&gt; Stay with God. &gt;&gt; Stay with the message &gt;&gt; because we only have a few years in the sun. &gt;&gt; Like you meet sometime the age people walk in the street and people despise them. What they don't realize in that day there was the stars of the day. And one of these days if we t people have to look after us. But while we here let's serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at the end we want him to say well done thou good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And faithful server. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And there was a little song that sum it all up. I don't know if I can talk. It's just a sharing you maybe. In shady green pasture, &gt;&gt; so rich and so sweet, God leades their children alone. Where the water cold flow bases, the weary ones feet, godly is their children long. Some through the water, some through the flood, &gt;&gt; some through the fire. [singing] But all true divine [music] some true great [singing] sorrow. But God give us all [music and singing] in the night [singing] season [music] and all. Sometimes on the mountain where the sun [music and singing] shines so bright, God lead his dead children [singing and music] alone. Yes. [music and singing] I'm tired in the valley. The darkest of night [singing and music] sound true. [singing and music] Sound true of love. Sound [singing] true your fire. But all true [music] sound true [singing] sorrow but God give us all in [music] the [singing] night season and all. So go sorrow [music] before [singing] us and say [music] [singing] children our Lord [music] and true grace [singing] we can conery [music] glory anymore. [music] Sound true to your water.

The light he could not see. He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows. Then Jesus came and made his darkness flee from home and friends. The evil spirits drove him among the tombs. He [music] dwelt in misery. [singing] He caught himself as [music] demon [singing] powers possessed him. Then [music] Jesus came and set the captive free. When Jesus [singing] comes, the temptor's power is broken. [singing] When [music] Jesus comes, our fiercy wipes away. He takes [music] the [singing] gloom and fills the life with glory.

[singing] They could not [music] coner passion lust and sin. Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely. Then [singing] Jesus came [music] and dwelt himself within. When Jesus comes, [singing and music] the ttor's power is broken. When Jesus comes, [music and singing] the tears are wiped away. He takes [music] the gloom and fills the life with glory. for all is changed when Jesus comes to stay. Their hearts were [music] sad as in the tomb they laid him for [singing] death had come and taken him away. Their night was dark and bitter tears were falling. Then [music and singing] Jesus came and night was [singing] turned to day. [music] When Jesus comes, [singing] the temptor's power is broken. When [singing] Jesus comes our tears, [music] he wipes away. He takes [singing] the gloom and fills the life with glory. [singing] For all is changed. For all is changed. Your whole is changed [music] when Jesus [singing] comes to stay. is called when someone dies where they've been before. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Bango [singing] [music] [singing] right there &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; That's the &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Let me say [music and singing] for [music and singing] He said [music] [singing] B for your [singing] Oh, come [singing] [music] every single [music] [singing] Don't for [singing] [music] [singing] [music] Fore [singing] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Thank Thank Confian [music] West.

We're sorry. We'll get you next week or when we can. Praise the Lord. So, Brother Art, where are you? Come and help us, my brother. &gt;&gt; Okay. If you would also remember in prayer um I think it was mentioned earlier but uh behind every good man there's a good woman. &gt;&gt; I think we heard that before but also you know brother Israel mentioned it and so you know as a saying goes there's a shepherd. The goal is to get the shepherd but in order to get the shepherd if he can't he's going to go to the next step down &gt;&gt; if it's not from his wife he's going to go to his family. So &gt;&gt; K brothers was family in prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Call him out by name, &gt;&gt; right? Because even though it takes a burden for a man, but it takes a family to stand behind him. So, as we go in prayer, let's remember that as well. Let's all bow our heads.
