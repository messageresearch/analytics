========================================

[Music] good morning Saints let's all stand to our feet we'd like to go into our adult Sunday School portion of the service we're in the seven seal S Series and we are on the second seal this morning we like to reading the scripture it's just two scriptures in Revelations chapter 6 if we can turn there thank the Lord for his goodness and mercy to all of us Revelations chapter 6 vers number three and four when you have that you can say amen amen and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword amen so well ask God's blessing on this service and the other classes as well let us pray Heavenly Father we just thank you for bringing us together once again father we pray that you'll bless us Lord as we come gathered in your name you promise that you would be in our midst we believe that this morning Lord we claim that you will meet every need here oh God bless the classes the younger classes uh this morning as well father we just commit the service Into Your Divine care in Jesus name we pray amen only believe only believe that all things possible only be only believe only believe all things are possible only God bless you you may be seated brother brandom now remember don't and don't forget now that he does nothing until he reveals it and don't forget also that he does it in such a simple way that the wise and The Prudent miss it now if you want to mark that down that's Matthew 11:25-26 and remember he does nothing till he reveals it and he reveals it in such a way that the smart educated people miss it remember it was wisdom that the world desired instead of the word when the first sin did what it did amen don't forget that now oh how grateful we should be to think that now just look at the things that happens look at the things that he's told us look that you're in this Tabernacle you people that we've been raised up here with now I'm I'm going to ask to tap or go ahead take it but look I'm just going to say this to the Tabernacle people you it's been here I charge any of you in the name of the Lord Jesus the ever to put your finger on one thing of the hundreds of things that's been told before they come to pass and say they did not come to pass amen tell me one time that on the platform out there wherever it was that he ever spoke anything that wasn't perfectly just exactly that way amen prise God how could a human mind be that way certainly not when he appeared down down on the river 33 years ago this coming June in the form of a light you old timers remember that I told you since a little boy that voice and that light and people thought is kind of a little bit off of the head part I would have probably thought the same thing somebody said it but now you don't have to wonder about it now and the church has been wondered since 1933 down the river that day where I was baptized in hundreds of people I remember that may boy told me said you're going down to duck those people Billy Little Jim Mar down here I think he's dead now I think he got killed out there some woman shot him but he he asked me you going down to duck those people I said no sir I'm going to baptize them in the name of our Lord [Music] Jesus and there was a woman going along in the group she said to another woman she said um uh made a remark something about it she said well I wouldn't mind to be duck said that's all right I don't care I said go back and repent you're not fit to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ This is not nothing to play with it's the gospel of Christ revealed by a commission the word just now if you saying nonsense and foolishness you could have plac it somewhere else but remember it's promised in the word that this would happen and just exact what it would be and here it is then down there that day when it was standing at the river and the angel of the Lord that I told you that it looked like a a star or something in a distance then it got close and told you how the Ember light look and there it come right down on the River where was baptizing when businessman down here in the city said what did that mean I said that wasn't for me that was for you you I believe that was for your sake that God did that to let you know that I'm telling you the truth by being a kid a boy like about 21 years old they they wouldn't believe that you see because it's too much for a kid and then I was thinking brother Roberson here one of our trustees I se here a few minutes ago he was telling me the other day about being in Houston when the picture there was taken that you see and I was uh on that debate I was starting to say something about the other night brother Roy was the only with one more man was the only person in the group that had a recorder one of the oldfashioned wire recorders I see brother Roberson now in his wife so and this Miss Roberson was sick brother Roy was a veteran his legs blowed and Lady mouth were dead he was an officer in the in the Army and a a German 88 hit this tank that he was with and then just killed the man and blo him to pieces and laid him out for dead for a long time and they said he never would walk because both legs was severed the nerves in them and things my he can almost out walk me but what was it there was something that he seen and he went to Houston and he was telling me about his wife and he's got the he's got the wire he's going to fix on a tape and if the services is over here while he's going to play it for you all I hope and on the Old Wire tape there he's got my services H in Houston and then uh his wife he said got her on there and he never noticed it till the other day she was U oh she was so sad she was sick and she wanted to get into the prayer line they never knew me I never seen them in my life so she was sitting at a a window that day looking out and so dreary you know and upset and wishing she could get a prayer carard to get in the line and happen to be that night she got in the line or night after or something I believe the same night and she got in the line and when she got up on the platform the Holy Spirit told her so now you're not from here you're from a city called New Albany and said you were sitting at a window today looking out and all worried about getting a prayer card there it is on the tapee years ago and then at the beginning of the meeting when the Holy Spirit was there that's the first of the meeting was was only having about 3,000 people then we went to 8,000 then to about 30,000 so then in the um while I was speaking at the one of the very first meetings I said I don't know why that I'm saying this that's on the tape but it's we are this is going to be one of the highlights of my time something is going to happen during this meeting is going to be greater than anybody's seen yet and it was just about eight or n 10 nights after that when the angel of the Lord appeared before around 30,000 people and cut down the picture was taken there it is right now which is copyrighted in Washington DC as the only supernatural being that was ever photographed in the world Amen and I talked about you know saying sometime under the discernment say a person is shadowed to death there's a dark hood of a shadow they're fixing the D and up here at East Pines or Southern Pines I believe it is just when I was there in the last meeting a little lady sitting there and Something Told her take that picture right quick when I speaking to the lady and there it was I think it'll be on the bullet board has been for quite a while there's that dark Hood hanging right over the lady she showed another picture as soon as the Holy Spirit announced it it was gone said you're going to be healed the Lord healed you the cancer is gone there it was and she was healed amen there you are see it just goes to show that God knows what's the time of day it is we don't we just have to obey now we can just keep on talking but let's get down here now just a minute and touch this back seal so we can blend this one in with it now just to review for a few few moments the the other the first seal we noticed in the breaking of the first seal Satan uh has uh a super religious man did you notice that white horsh Rider which they it was thought to be that that was a their early church going for oh my that's been taught through the years but it couldn't be you just watch when the rest of them when they get them all tied together then the supps that now and I don't know what the rest of them's going to be as yet but I know it's got to come just perfectly in there because it's the truth it's the truth that was the hierarchy Church of Rome exactly these people who think that the Jews are the Antichrist there are certainly a million miles off the line you never think the Jews are an antichrist they're were blinded purposely that we might have a way to get in giving us a time of repentance but the Antichrist is a gentile amen certainly is an impersonator amen of the truth anti against now this great Superman oh how uh he become a great man and and then finally was throned and then after Throne he was crowned and now he after that he was worshiped in the Ste of God Amen now look before that ever come I want to ask you something who was that what was that on Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 that said that man would come why did that man look down through the and see it he was God's Prophet certainly why was he said the spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times that they depart from the faith and would give heed to seducing you know what seduce is a seducing spirit in the church that is clergy amen seducing clergy Spirit workings of devils hypocrisies in the church heavy High minded wisdom you see smart intelligent having a f of godliness just go say well we're Christians we should go to church having a form of godliness but denying the revelations the power and the working of the spirit from such turn away now notice he said for this is the sort that will go from house to house and will lead silly women I don't mean Holy Ghost women silly women that's LED away with divers lust divers lust they just like to get in every little thing that they can get into in all kinds of societies and live any way they want to and still we go to church we're just as good as anybody dances parties cut their hair paint dress anything we want to still we're we're Pentecostals we're we're just as good as anybody oh your own Works identify you notice but he said man of reprobate mind concerning truth what is the truth the word is Christ concerning the truth oh you make you you're a woman driver you're a woman hater you do this that no sir that's not right that's a falsehood I do not hate women no sir they're my sisters if they are sisters but the thing uh uh love is corrective if it isn't corrective It Isn't Love if it is then if it's love it's it's a felio love and not AG goppel I tell you that they might have a little felio love for some nice looking lady but a goo love is a different thing that's a love that straightens a thing out and meet God y or somewhere we can live eternally see amen I didn't mean that maybe in the way it sounded but I you know what I hope you understand all right now but remember he said as jambis and jambis with stood Moses so will they amen amen but their Folly was soon made manifest why when Moses was commissioned to do something that seemed radical but he went down there just as honest as he could be and God told him to take this uh step and to throw it down and it would turn to serent and then he did it to show him what it would take place and before Pharaoh he stood out there just as God had commissioned him and throw down his stick and it turned to a serpent and no doubt Pharaoh said a cheap magician trick so he goes and gets his his jambers and jambers said we can do those things too and he threw down the sticks and they become serpents now what could Moses do what was it it was a showing that every genuine thing of God the devil's got an impersonator for they impersonate to throw the people off the track what did Moses do say well I guess I made a mistake I better go back he just stood still for he carried out his commission to the letter then the first thing you know Moses serpent eat up the other one see did you ever think what become of that other serpent where did he go to Moses picked up the stick and went on out with it he worked miracles with it and that serpent was on the inside of this other amen that's wonderful isn't yes sir now Antichrist comes into light gradually I want you to no now when you hear now to my Catholic friends just sit still just a minute and now and then we're going to see where the Protestants where we all are see notice the first church when the Catholic Church says that they were the first original Church they're exactly right they were they began at Pentecost that's where the Catholic Church began now I once didn't hardly believe that I read history and I found out it's right they begin at Pentecost but they begin to drift and you see where they're at and if Pentecost drifts with the speed it's drifting now they won't have to go 2,000 years in a hundred years from now they'll be farther away than the Catholic church is that's right but notice how this white horsh Rider now we just backgrounding a little till he hit this seal now notice the white horse rider when he went out he he serves in three stages the Devil is a appr here the night is in a trinity just like God but it's the same devil all the time Amen in three stages notice the stages in the first stage he come in the Holy Ghost fell and people had everything in common and the spirit of God was upon them and the Apostles uh went from house to house breaking bread with the people and there was great signs and wonders wrought and and then the first thing you know Satan begin to cause a murmur to come up then after a while these slaves and the poor of the land what receed the Holy Ghost they went out into different places testifying they testified to their masters and after a while they begin to come all like Army captains and um and different people people of celebrity begin to see the galloper and the Miracles and signs that these men done so they accepted Christianity well then you see when he embraced Christianity and go down there to a place where they're meeting in a little old dark Dungy Hall and clapping their hands and shouting speaking in tongues and getting messages well he can ever take that to his his uh competitor or whatever it is in his business he never believe it like that certainly not so he's got the to dress it up so they begin to get together and begin to think now we'll Farm something a little different and the Jesus right immediately at the first church age he told him in the second chapter of uh Revelation here I have somewhat against you because these Deeds of the nians nickel conquer the Ley in other words they want to make instead of everybody be one they want to make some holy fell they want to make some kind of a they wanted to pattern and paganism from where they come out and they finally done it now watch first nicadan the nicadan was called in the Bible Antichrist because it was against the original doctrine of Christ and the apostles I don't want to call this man's name he's a great man but I was at his meeting here a few years ago and he knew I was there cuz it shook his hand and he said oh you know we have such today that they call Pentecostals and he said U they they rely upon the book of Acts and he said you see the acts was only scaff work for the church would you imagine a man that studyed the Bible a gallant old man and was study the Bible Way that fellow has and then would make a remark like that it sound it even doesn't sound like the holy spirit is around it's got not to be nowhere because anybody with common understanding would know that the Acts of the Apostles was not Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles don't you know how we pattered out in the church ages a them Beast sitting there watching that AR Matthew Mark Luke and John standing there watching that and in there's what happened are the results of the writing of Matthew Mark Luke and [Music] John [Music] h

verse number see 13 yes verses number three through 13 I'll read the first verse verse three and you all read together uh verse number four and we'll do it like that read it with all your heart all right don't whisper it I want to hear you all right and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them deceive for many sh for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many many R not all to end yet for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these the beginning of then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and Offray another another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many verse Alto together but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved amen verses 1 and two of the same chapter I'll read and Jesus went out and departed from the temple his disciples came to him for to show him the building of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon an another that shall not be thrown down amen let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word bless your people we pray in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated we're just going to speak a little bit on the the ending of the Gentile dispensation we've been talking on it the last couple of services on the idolatry in the last days that there will be this uh idol worship and the forced worship and there's always been our lord Jesus has given us the warnings before as the word of God always warns us before the people of God are not waiting to get ready she's getting ready she's not waiting for the new whatever regime the new president to come in and then find out how things are going to be better this way or that way that's not what the believer looks to it's there it's part of it we go through the motions but we know really what's going to take place because the word of God warned us of this and we are here because we're supposed to be here and it's supposed to be exactly what you see going on nobody is surprising our Lord he knew these things would be here just exactly and there there are some perilous times I got to be honest with you we're seeing things that we've never seen before things that will shake oldtimers Shake any newcomer it's a wonder that anybody would be saved but Jesus said for the elect's sake he um he would not be deceived so the elect cannot be deceived but it's going to be so bad and so cold and so harsh and so challenging je that if you were if you were not elected you would be deceived too and it's just that simple we think we got it all together well he has it all together and he included Us in his plan and so we thank the Lord for that aren't you glad he thought of you without the Lord we could we could do nothing we couldn't amen and so we certainly couldn't believe him we certainly couldn't love him except he showed us grace and mercy and so we want to go through a couple of uh things here this morning and I want to First identify to you from the scriptures and the message who the enemy is who is our great enemy what is his plan and tactics what is he doing and then how are we supposed to prepare ourselves knowing these things Jesus told us many times in the scripture I'll just go there right now where he is talking about how time is at hand and in Revelations chap 1 verses 1 through3 it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy so you're there's a blessing just right there and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand Revelations 22: 6 and 7 says he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord god of the Holy prophets sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book so here our Lord is telling us that the time is at hand behold I come quickly Revelations 2210 says and he said unto me seal not the Saints of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so we see this time and the doors of the Gentile dispensation closing we see there's a Time window there you know you have the beginning of the day you have the middle of the day and you have the ending of the day you'll see 5:00 twice 4:00 twice and it's good to know which five o'l it is is it am or p.m. you sleep so deep you'll wake up you don't know what time it is you know how deep you sleep the only time you know what time it is someone like a clock or a watch or calendar has to tell you what time it is because we've been sleeping so deep and some sometimes I think we get our time switched up we we think that this is the time to be building a name for ourselves or a career and we've drilled that into our children their careers and the love of money and success and in this nation in this country we do it all the time don't worry we know the balance we got the balance but really where we all going we put all of our energy into success and and reading and and uh all of the things that the world calls important but one of these days the time is going to be at hand and the time will be over remember brother Billy Paul's dream we shared it with you throughout the message here a number of times in the message what message is it in thank you I've been asking that and so everybody knows it there's a man that can turn on the light and in this dream brother Billy Paul says his dad eyes of fire and he says that before now in daylight Jesus will be here prise God the time is over there's not too many people can make those claims but a prophet can amen Revelations 10 1-7 the angel came down and says there'll be what no more time no more amen now we don't know the time I don't know Reverend so and so doesn't know Pastor Elder so and so doesn't know even Jesus didn't tell the disciples he just gives them prophecies and promises that were to be fulfilled and it's our job to get ready it's our job to take it seriously this is a drunken age they drunk on whatever it is pleasure and whatever you think feels good to you you can change the rules of the game they're changing it all the time and the world will tell tell you what's important and your family members will tell you what's important but God's word really is the one that tells us what is important amen and as we look into the word of God the word of God identifies who our enemy is and I'm I'm just a small fry here as a small little voice to encourage you to stay ready for the coming of the Lord amen things that we see going on is not just um it's not just um you know things as usual I mean the politics and all of the different pressures and Powers that's trying to get you involved in whatever they're talking about out there and get you all caught up on your job and sign up for this and you know resist this and you know stand to get this where you know they want you to put this bumper sticker on your vehicle or wear some t-shirt or some hat of what they talking about out there this is what we talking about right here the message of the hour has come and God's not sending this message so we can play games with it no sir no sir so let's identify who this enemy is this morning just for a few moments and then we will let you go is all right and paragraph 181 in the Feast of the trumpets brother brandom says this I hope that God opens your eyes to this now cuz I realize this is just not speaking to this church here this tape goes worldwide and I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but just to tell you the truth now the ecclesiastical realm has been open from the natural Revival of the old Pagan Rome went forth on those Jews which has always been their enemy the lion with teeth and everything it stomped down and broke out the people Rome has always been God's enemy and it was turned loose In The Same Spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed so here brother banam is telling us that Rome has always been God's enemy amen another place he says that the Rome has always been the enemy of the church you say Rome the Roman Kingdom and that's politics they don't bother you know they had power they don't really bother anyone it's you know these other things but we'll see that they're all connected brother bam continues in that same message just up a little bit further in paragraph 161 he says this and notice what happens under the six trumpet they were turned loose on the Jews the persecution of Jews Supernatural Devils nearly 2,000 years then loosed by Stalin Hitler upon the Jews you say well that isn't Roman it's the same spirit amen they done the same things they did to the Christians in the old Pagan Roman days now watch the natural Israel and the spiritual church now as we separated here turn loose on the Jews you say well the Jews ain't my problem the Jews we watch the Jews the True Believer does we know the Jews are God's people they're God's time piece and if people have a problem with the Jews they got a problem with God it's like if you have a problem with my children me and you got issues too right those are his children amen and you know this these little political things that come up and they rise up and what's going on and this group and that group and we see this what the spirit has done when it was released upon them in a political realm is this little old man a little man at off Hitler a German um had was wanted to build a superior race and he went after them Jews and persecuted and the entire world saw it and they act like they didn't see it they laid quiet and we continued on as usual and then he started moving and taking more property and more land then the rest of the world got interested same thing with um this other uh Stalin brother random says that that Spirit was released upon the Jews you go into a holocaust museum you see the hatred that was one man that put upon another man it's it just break your heart to see the the maliciousness and the pure hatred one man against another but that spirit is connected with the same enemy that the church has as an enemy our enemy has always been wrong the prophet identified it for us amen let's go a little bit further in the message conference paragraph 62 1960 brother bham says this here all right now did you notice do you know what the name kof means in Russia dirt or clay he was heading up them kingdoms you know what eisenh har means the head of this iron iron and Clay they couldn't mix together took his shoe beat it there's no mixing together they can't mix they wouldn't cleave one to another do you see friends the next thing left is the stone to be cut out the coming of the Lord to roll into this image and mash it to pieces and all these kingdoms will be ground and blowed away like the Sha on The Summer's thrashing floor we're at the end time brother sister can't you see where we're at listen thus saith the Lord repent I predict three curtains in the name of the Lord there's one called the Iron Curtain which will be Russia watch Red China that'll be the bamboo curtain they're horrible but watch the purple curtain that's rising in the United States amen and over the world the Roman Empire the cruelest of all of them remember in the name of the Lord get away from it come away from anything that's attached to it flee to the Rock the coming of the Lord is at hand we need a conference I need a conference to talk these things over with God the church is at the end of her word end of her road let us pray now here's a Vindicated Prophet crying out from his heart to get away from it get away from what how do you know what to get away from it's the spirit that Roman Spirit the denom denominational Spirit a hat hatred Spirit a political Spirit they're all connected and so we have to know who our enemy is so that we can know how to stand and what to stand against let's go a little bit further we remember Daniel's um interpretation of the dream in Daniel chapter 2 remember the king had this great he had an image of of gold it was bright and shiny it it lit everything up and this dream that he had was of the future kingdoms of the Gentile world and when he woke up from this dream it troubled him so much that he needed an interpretation but he couldn't remember the dream it wouldn't retain to him it just troubled him so he called his men they couldn't do it and then he promised to put them to death if they couldn't do it so it was an element that needed to be interpreted it and when you don't know and then somebody else knows the person that does know it raises the value of that person we don't know what's going on everybody's going to die what's going on but now God sends the answer and he sends it to his Prophet Daniel and Daniel Comes To The King and he says I'm no better than anyone else but the god of heaven will now reveal to the king what the future will be I want you to notice about this great King Nebuchadnezzar you know God put him in his place and God allowed him to rise in great Authority and power the Bible said so God gave him this great great Kingdom and all the other nations were under him God gave it to him he wasn't a Jew but he had several dreams that wasn't the only only dream he had other dreams that God had give him and Daniel would interpret and you see this you know the this relationship that God has with other people sometimes and we don't fully understand it you know like like we told you before aimc with with with when he took Sarah when God prevented him from sinning against him he says Lord you know the Integrity of my heart in a dream you know that I was and the Lord says yeah I know the Integrity of your heart that's why I'm revealing to you what you need to do so you won't sin against me why is God interested in a foreign King sinning against him well that's God's business it's not your business we don't know what God is doing and you know what when the king come out of all of that he went to Abraham he says man what you doing he told me that was your sister I asked you you lied to me you know what Abraham said we knew that you didn't fear God like how did you know that how did you know God didn't speak to me by dreams you didn't even ask me and so we do the same don't we but God has these covenants and relationships with other people we don't fully understand it but he's got a purpose and a plan he gives Nebuchadnezzar these series of dreams and in this dream he sees the kingdoms of the Gentile Kingdom gold and and then the second kingdom was silver me and Persians Darius and then the brass under the Greek Alexander the Great and then the last Kingdom would be the Roman Kingdom in the dream he SS a Stone come out that was cut out of the mountain without hands and it smashed the entire Gentile Kingdom to powder the dust went through and blew it like the shaft and there was a mountain that rose that rain for Everlasting all of time we know that that was Christ brother bam tells us so this King sees the beginning and ending of the Gentile Kingdom now here what the prophet of God says here we'll go right here for a moment all right in the message Mark of the Beast 1954 paragraph 125 he says we got two things under consideration now watch this Beast it had four different characters in it and if you you'll take Daniel 7 you who are marking it down Daniel 7 Daniel saw the same vision 800 years before this saw the vision he saw those beasts separate one from another in the beginning of the Gentile ruling and here they are John seeing it and the end of the Gentile ruling so here brother bam is telling us that Daniel and John see the same thing when d Daniel sees it these beasts are separated when John sees it it's a horrible Beast that took control and power over everyone but it's still the same Beast we just read it for you send this message here let me quote it for you again the mark of the beast 1954 he said if you'll take Daniel 7 and um he saw the same vision 800 years before this and saw the vision dropped down he says and here they are John seeing it and the end of the Gentile ruling all four of those beasts represented in one them same old Devils demons that possessed each kingdom of the Romans down through and the Greeks and so forth on down through the Gentile dispensation has come right down and all met up in one Beast we'll find him directly and see who he is all those the leper the lion and the the dragon how many knows what the dragon is the dragon represents Rome all right so we know who our enemy is right Saints our enemy is Rome romanism denominationalism uhhuh all right so this Beast now is gathering together his subjects and you see this Gathering take place with all of the darkness that we've never seen before it's like everybody now is Under The Same Spirit you know it used to be on the streets there you hear certain music and you can know or I know what the kind of people just listen to this music y'all ain't going to say nothing but it's true you know that kind of music it was a strong guitar be a punk rocker all right it was rap music it's one of the homies right but now they all playing the same music and they all look the same amen and they all dressed the same they wear their clothes the same and you see this Darkness gathering together you see it a a TR tremendous coldness on the hearts of the people out on the streets there people are just so mean now they're gotten harder and harder I mean if you can break the ice with them then they they'll get to like you a little bit but it's harder and harder to break the ice you know people look at you and they look at you and they're ready to go I mean we're just buying something at Walmart are you ready to go in the Walmart we don't even know each other what you so mad about but that's what the age is is just produces this because of what the the stuff that they're feeding on Hollywood is not producing a love for God in righteousness Hollywood is not producing you to desire to be at a prayer meeting amen the Hollywood is not going to encourage you to pick up your Bible Hollywood is not going to show you what time it is really what time it is it's a tremendous agenda and we can say it like this every law that's being passed today Satan is the king he's the prince of every government brother bam tells us and every law being passed today and every single trouble you hear going out there is all leading to these prophecies to be fulfilled amen we can argue all we want to and get red or get all steamed up it's going to happen just exactly the way the word said it's going to happen is that right Saints all right now brother brandom says in this message here beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation he says this here we'll take paragraph number 38 he says and the Bible said in the last days that Satan would go about like a roaring lion he's gathering together all of his enemies all of his friends are enemies and congregating them together heaping up under a big head the mark of the beast in the ecclesiastical realm the confederation of churches all in uniting and making themselves a great organization the same as Catholicism and the world Empires are uniting themselves together and forming up a big head over there in the political Realms called communism and the life of God is pressing on what's Happening the same time to make it the Christian Church the Church of the Living God is being anointed power is coming to her she's receiving the holy spirit says last year the Full Gospel Realms was a mil 500,000 conversion the greatest that swept the land for years after years we're not in an alley no more we're on Hallelujah Boulevard we're not in the Shell no more 1,500,000 conversions in the Full Gospel ranks last year succeeded Catholicism and everything else oh my what is it lights a gathering great healing service has combed the globe Hallelujah way down in Formosa healing campaigns are going on way down in Japan healing campaigns are going on up in the Frozen regions of the North Healing campaigns are going on around the world healing campaigns Hallelujah and are receiving the Holy Ghost so we see that both the enemy our enemy and we the church are both receiving Powers amen Satan is gathering his dark Forces and it's going to get darker and darker and darker amen we the true church have received the greatest message that ever hit the earth don't let the devil fool you or discourage you that nothing's going on it's going on all the time amen if you're in this word today you ought to be the most happy and grateful person because God is open your eyes to what the truth is we know just one prophecy we want we know that just any kind of gift don't have the authority of the word we've seen that we've seen signs and wonders and miracles take place among denominations and people who believe and partly believe but for us who are the bride it doesn't move us us why because we have received this great end time message you know he's preaching this in 19 in the 50s the early 50s 1955 and this great tremendous gift that never failed it brought an energy to all of the Full Gospel churches and they grew in numbers and some of them was our great great grandparents or great grandparents and some family member and somebody got it somebody caught it somebody that first generation of pastors that caught a revelation where there were no message churches but they had a revelation they didn't have all the tapes they had one or two or some but it was enough and then the tape Ministry grew greater and then they got more and then they were able to establish churches and now you can go all over the world and find what we call a message church thank God for it how many you know it hasn't always been that way it had to grow up into that but the church has received a tremendous message of this day and Satan has gathered his forces his Darkness because light now is pushing it it gets darkest just before the day break amen Jesus said the day is at hand the time is at hand even at the door we're not in the beginning of the Gentile age we're right at the closing of that age the door is closing like in the days of Noah get into the ark very simple message didn't need to know geometry but geometry was involved you didn't know how to build but building was involved you didn't need to know all the particulars of the species of the wood that was the prophet's job your job was to follow him amen and the door was getting closer to closing and as he preached Faithfully his message his ministry maybe was in a great ministry as others out there but it was very unique he's building a boat because it's going to rain like it's never rained before and he's preaching this with conviction and he preached it for 10 years and then 20 years and then 30 years he's out on the plane there somewhere where God told him to build it 40 years later the old man still taking his same text every Sunday morning but he was faithful to the message yes what was the message not look at me what was the message he was like get into the ark it's going to rain and he preached it Faithfully didn't he how he's going to give him high five when you see him I'mma give Noah a high five and Noah I've been preaching on you brother God bless you he stayed faithful and look at his ministry considered a a fair look at his ministry who got who were the new converts his family that's what God gave him he gave him his family but he stayed faithful when the numbers grew around the ark he stayed faithful when it got unpopular and they left around the ark he stayed faithful he stayed faithful and the Animals started coming in and hearing it yeah I remember the testimony I shared this with the group in Phoenix God bless brother Ard and the Saints there in Phoenix I remember this testimony from Brother Chango up in he's in the um from the Congo there he gave this testimony at brother Ferguson's dedication and he was responsible for baptizing thousands of Believers hundreds of churches this precious little brother he came out there and he he gave one of his testimony he said that one Village he went into he wanted to go preach and they wouldn't let him into the village and so they told him he couldn't come so they kept him outside of the village so what did he do he went outside of the village and he started preaching to the trees and he told the trees to repent it's coming the Judgment of God is coming he says he says when he pre started preaching conviction to the trees his voice hit from the trees and went over into the village and the people heard the message and they came out of the village and got saved so if they won't hear you go preach to a tree somewhere preach it to your animals preaching to the hippopotamus and the giraffe they heard it didn't they there's a lot of hippopotamus but there was one that was doing his thing whatever hippopotamuses do and they saw Noah's arguing he like H let's move on over here break that down for me what you where you going we all doing this over here another little pig he oink oink like what are he doing getting over close to the ark and then finally two by two they started coming in amen that's right where the carcass is Heen the Eagles will come where the word is preached where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered and he stayed with his message until finally Noah didn't have anything to do with it his family didn't have anything to do with it but finally one day God closed the door sealed them up inside nothing can get out nothing can get in and that's the do that's where we're at Saints I I don't have anything else to tell you I can't cry it out hard enough I can't remind you more enough I can't tell it you know strong enough of the last days that we're living in amen if it ever was a time for us to be getting our hearts right before God now is that time amen and so the Christian church has received this glorious message hasn't she and this message has gathered us and given to us a power right it's brought us together it's the strength that we have received as Darkness has gathered the light has also gathered can you say praise the Lord now brother brandom continues on he says he says that that that uh um that the Bible says the last days Satan would go about like a roaring lion he's gathering together all his enemies all of his friends our enemies and congregating them together heaping up under a big head the mark of the beast so brother Adam continues on I go a little bit further in the spoken word is the Original Seed he says this like this here he says now he's talking about Billy Graham and the three seeds that were planted he says Billy Graham May preach everywhere Oral Roberts them Godly men may preach everywhere the Lord may send me to seow some seeds somewhere else some feeli but I believe our nation is sold down and I believe she's ready for the Harvest now when the spirit Falls and there becomes a move amongst the people them denominations will swing together just as certain as I'm standing in the pulpit and the Church of God will be ousted and they will make it such a racket until they'll Confederate it and put a boycott on anybody that doesn't belong to them Rome will rule the world for just an hour she'll rule for a little pce not communism romanism will rule the world with the cooperation of the protestantism in a denominational form of church which God has rejected that's as close as I know the word of God how many can hear that warning this morning there will be there will be a move and there's moves happening all the time and now the churches they all look the same you used to be able to know what a Baptist was but they're all non- denominational now they all praise and worship is all the same they've all Blended together they have a praise team black SE a black ceiling with strobe lights it's like a band the song leader has a long ponytail open chirt shirt open like that the preacher Pastor Don't Wear Ties anymore deacons trust these leaders they don't come to church dress like they're going to church they look like they're going to go golfing or somewhere after the service I'm so glad we have an example in this day yes sir you don't let the denominations uh give you what you what our example should be right amen amen I know that kind of tightens up here in Arizona cuz we if we could would come here in some flipflops if we could and some sandals some of us Brothers like we going to some kind of wherever we're going but you know you got a job if it required you to wear a tie I guess you'll wear it I bet you would how many days a week is that got to get that paper got to pay them bills right certainly God gave me this job that's why I can't make it to church on Sunday I'm too blessed I'm too blessed brother Warren I'm too blessed to make it to church y'all got me on something else now yeah tighten up roll your eyes don't roll them at me I'm talking about the word don't get mad at me tell me the prophet didn't preach that tell me he didn't live it not only did he preach it he lived it right before for you praise God and I think it's high time we take these things very serious I think we need to relook our service in worship to him amen amen the church has received this great power that's this message my job is to highlight the message to you that is so beautiful it's the Mana from on high this is why we can sustain in such a dark time this is why we're still alive because we got food to eat in the time of the famine this is why we're still here because we reive this great message now that we've got this great message it's our responsibility to lay in the presence of it and that's my final Point here this morning I want to land on that right right there before you can lay in the presence you need to receive that presence which is called the baptism of the Holy Ghost every member every brother every sister must have it in so much that it would change your ways I'm not talking about the Holy Ghost that just makes you feel good to dance and to shout I'm talking about the Holy Ghost that will change your ways change your behavior change your thinking and the way you think and process things amen he said the Holy Spirit fell down in the meeting but if no one was changed then Lord help us the true baptism of the Holy Ghost will lead you to believe every word is that right Saints the word of your day that Holy Spirit comes to lead you to that word and in that word is the preparation for the day we know we're at the end time we know we're right at the door and the door of the Gentile age is closing as Jesus says it's even at hand in that great warning in MA in Matthew chapter 24 he says let no man deceive you for many will come and say this is Christ or go over here in the desert or move go do he says believe it not remember I told you before Jesus said so he gives us this warning before and then the the prophet delivers this message remember and we brought it here a couple of times that that great persecution part of it was forced worship and coming against us in these doors will be closed you know it's it's a quote now it's a prophecy now but when it starts to be fulfilled we don't even know what that looks like I mean we don't know what it looks like for the government to switch and change on us but they've done it before you know the the the the Shadrach meach and ab bedo had gain um a great prestige in that Kingdom they're in a foreign land but God raised them up in their careers but they kept their testimony until one day they wanted those boys to bow down in worship an image they had already been in good graces with the King they had moved up because Daniel promoted them as God blessed Daniel Daniel blessed his boys as we would say his followers they had prayer meetings together and Daniel was promoted he promoted them too and made them princes and then the laws change strange they change remember this nation it used to be in God we trust liberty and justice for all how many remember that except for you and you and you and liberty and justice for all except for that group and that group and that group freedom of religion remember that remember we can we can put our thumbs in our lapel and say at least we're a Godly Nation but you see they turned didn't they they turned on God and this quote that we read for you that the Beast is rising in this country and we think it's not associated all of these little conflicts and uprisings you know the the hoodlums and then the the the people that want rights for every single thing that's out there they're ready to fight over everything and some of us even get involved in that they're all connected all of them it's all part of the same grand scheme to unite all the dark Forces to come against the True Believer the laws are going to change on us they're going to close these doors one day and then those of us who really enjoy to be here we'll really know what it means the benefit and the power of coming together Jesus said forsake not that's right the assembling of yourself together don't forsake it and then we love that scripture my Ox is in the ditch like wait a minute that's an exception to a rule you can't make that your rule that can't be your first response my Ox is in the ditch right Jesus gave that example didn't he and Luke I was talking with the young people about this and Luke he says which of you if you had an ox on the Sabbath day he fall or an ass he fall into a ditch which of you wouldn't go straightway deliver him and many of us like Bingo got it Ox in the ditch man can't make it Ox in the ditch well you put them in the ditch the age put put them in the ditch the age opened everything up on Sunday first was Monday through Friday then they start squeezing out Saturday then took Saturday and then they took over Sunday too y'all coming back tonight brother Ike's gonna be speaking tonight we look forward to him so you get me out of here we have I come I this is the truth I think I believe with all my heart there's a tremendous warning I can't put my finger on it completely but I'm still heartbreak heartbroke over what happened during covid in those years in politics and I saw Believers change yes I heard it from some pulpits in this message and and me too I failed it hurt me and looking back at what happened and you think what's coming is is going to be worse than what already happened put it together Saints amen put it together amen it's the time now to make ready the door is closing but what is our job now is to lay in the presence of the son brother Branham after laboring his whole life in delivering this message 1,200 plus sermons from the Tabernacle all across the United States and even other countries it was recorded now he's coming look like on the the decline of his ministry his tape Ministry to the people and you'll look at those last few years of his message he's not really bringing a lot of new material he's just bringing you into fullness of what God has already done he'd already preached the great tremendous do serpent seed and the original sin and you know the mystery of iniquity and denominationalism and he preached all that and here he is now tying up this final visions and bringing those things in here from 1964 until God calls him off the scene he starts making this statement about laying in the presence of the son that's the 11th Hour worker message that's the message to us the believer it's for us we have the message it's been gathered it's given to us now we got to lay in the presence of that message can we look at it just for a moment 1965 paragraph 89 so when you watch nature now we see where every age and directly designated out there where in the the last age the shuck has pulled away we've had 15 years nearly 20 now years of the message sweeping across from Nation to nation and this morning hooked up across this nation see no organization it can't organize there's nothing ever been like it or will be after see the thing that's to matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their heart Hearts must lay in the presence of the son to get ripened see you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you making matured Christians see what I mean God is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of Christians for him to receive the wheat has got to get ripe look at your neighbor and say get ripe I didn't say get right I said get ripe get ripe get ripe get ripe lay in the presence of the sun invisible Union paragraph 190 and the life comes out of denomination goes into the grain then what happens when the grain begins to grow to get bigger so it can cover over something the denomination pulls away from it why ain't we got a denomination out of this there never will be it's the grain it can't go no further farther we're at the end time so what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the son to be ripened that's exact the word to be ripened into our your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about amen trying to do God a service without it being his will paragraph 258 the very word Prophet means he is a revealer of the word of God the interpretation only comes to that that's why today we're in such a need of this great person that's supposed to be sent to us in the form of the Prophet Elijah because it will be the revelation of God made known to us by Vindication showing that it's the day and the hour and that's been always will be rejected just like the shuck will first you'll be accepted because the Shu only holds the wheat until it's able to get forth to the sun Pentecost will only shelter the message given an open door until it gets scattered and then the shuck will pull away and the wheat will lay in the presence of the sun see to ripen it won't be any denomination just remember brother Jack here is a historian many of you here there's never been a Revival about 3 years after Revival they start denomination is that right and this last great miracle move of God in the last days it went 20 years and it's a million miles from a denomination going further away all the time the Shuck's pulling away no cooperation no nothing with it always it pulls away from it there can't be no more it's a wheat now but we're plenty green that's right have to lay in the presence of the son to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst to know that the spirit of the Living God moving in his word and showing us the things yet let me move back to one quote that I missed back here I want to read this for you and brother banam says about the time that this messenger comes when he comes that will be the time that the door should be closing prophet of God makes this statement here I want to read it for you all right how many love the Lord all right of course we thank the Lord for his goodness to us you see I got this here this just shows us the time that we're in oh my Lord help me is see I want to get this one to you maybe it's here yes the spoken word is the Original Seed he says this here God is Promised be careful God has promised Malachi 4 for this last day and Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but it must be F fulfilled for it is a gerti word of God spoken through Malachi the prophet Jesus referred to it it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second time listen close now all scripture that has not been fulfilled must be before that time the Bible is to be finished to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he'll plant the seed of the entire Bible excuse me from the serpent seed to the messenger in the former Reign then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefather John and Elijah as was spoken of Our Lord but here the prophet is showing us how close the time is that the age should be complete and finish when this messenger has has arrived has he come sure he has come it shows us that we're right at the ending the closing of time the darkness Gathering and yet light Gathering and I believe that this it should encourage us Brothers really to take our position in the word of God we sisters to really take our position in the word of God a young man a young woman take your position in the word of God this is the time we've been warned by Jesus the signs the Wonders the Miracles and now it's the prophet telling us that we need to lay in the presence of the son let me read two more quotes two three more quotes and we will close God's only provided place of worship paragraph number 40 this is November of 65 say I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and begin to understand but friends listen we've got to lay in the presence of the sun we got to be ripened our faith isn't right intellectually we're hearing the message that God has give us seeing the signs that he showed us and proving it by the Bible by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and get sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe down sometime in speaking the message you get harsh have to break it in like that because you got to clinch your nail to make it hold brother R continues in the same message paragraph 285 now Church we're teaching now drop down to 286 the thing of it is just tell the people to come seek the Lord Jesus then you yourself lay right in his presence just make love to him oh Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender My Heart Lord take away all the filth and the love of the world and let me live holy in this present world before you now the word of God is so rich it's so deep and compressed and there's many great truths in there doctrines timelines his historical points and I I can't understand it all and I don't believe no man understands it all but the portion that we do understand I believe we all understand this the importance of laying in the presence of the son the s o n laying in the presence of this ministry the message of the hour lay there and let it mature you lay there and let it change your behaviors and change your attitude God doesn't expect us to memorize the whole Bible or even know everything even what I spoke this morning there's portions of it that some will get we'll get more we'll get other portions of it the prophet preached it the Bible predicts that these things would be here but it all wraps up into laying in the presence of the son because this is where our maturity will begin to ripen and It prepares us for the things that are to come darker days are out there but greater lighter days are in here for the believer we get stronger that gets more wicked they'll finally turn against us and the love of many will wax cold brother will betray one another you can't find trust faithfulness nowhere Jesus warned of us us of that and we see it today we see it in small forms friends you had for many many years sometimes that's gone the Lord allows all of that but he that endures to the end the same shall be saved be encouraged Saints take the word of the Lord stay in the presence of that word in so much that it changes your behavior amen God bless you God bless you richly let me take one more modern events made clear by by prophecy oh he says the Shu held it but now the Shu pulls away and has to and remember 20 years has passed by and no denomination has come out of it and it won't we are at the end of denomination the wheat's taking shape but what's the matter with the wheat now you can't it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen before the come time picks it up thank God for it that we can lay in the presence of the word I can study the message in a way like I've never studied it before because we have it all on the tapes it's in our phones and we can ripen in his presence amen God bless you let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for bringing us into a recognition as to what's going on Lord the hour the time we see the Fig Tree we see the other trees putting forth their buds we see nationalism and hatred we see great organizations being formed like every season it seems a new organ ization a new um something to join it's victory all it's very harsh there sharp differences in in in it's all darkness is trying to pull us aside
