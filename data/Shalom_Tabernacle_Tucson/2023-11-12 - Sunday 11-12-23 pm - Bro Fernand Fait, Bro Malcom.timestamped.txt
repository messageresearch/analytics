[57:18] him yeah put those hands together
[57:23] amen
[57:29] God bless you
[57:30] friends bless you I can say God bless
[57:33] you Saints because you are
[57:36] Saints can say God bless you brothers
[57:39] and sisters because you are my brothers
[57:42] and sisters we are in the same family of
[57:45] God but I do prefer to greet you God
[57:49] bless you friends because the Bible says
[57:52] there is some friend of a greater value
[57:55] than a brother we are more than brothers
[57:58] and sister we are friends we love one
[58:02] another I am just a little bit nervous
[58:06] now for three reasons the first one is
[58:10] because of my so bad and broken
[58:15] English because uh I am a Frenchman I
[58:19] remember just um in July last July I was
[58:24] in a
[58:25] convention in new Week Canada and
[58:29] Minister was preaching and he was a very
[58:34] good friend of mine and when uh he has
[58:37] heard that I will be in the meeting when
[58:39] he arrived at the pulpit he said where
[58:41] are you brother F and so I just raised
[58:44] my hand and he said you know uh you know
[58:48] when I I see brother in a meeting I am
[58:52] really amazed that God is able to save
[58:59] even a French
[59:01] man because you know the French people
[59:04] they are not too much Godly but you know
[59:07] I am
[59:09] saved yeah I am
[59:15] Sanctified I am baptized in the Holy
[59:19] Ghost born
[59:21] again and I'm going to my adoption am we
[59:26] have so much great Ministries here so
[59:29] the first reason was my language second
[59:32] reason I have uh my time very limited
[59:36] and I I I don't want to take the time of
[59:39] my precious uh brother and friend Pastor
[59:43] malcol he will come after me so uh I I
[59:48] have to leave him all the time to to
[59:52] share what God has put on his heart
[59:55] and also
[59:57] F third reason is because after all the
[1:00:02] preaching the mighty preaching I heard
[1:00:05] and all these season ministers bringing
[1:00:08] the gospel I feel so little little
[1:00:11] little but I said I need your prayer and
[1:00:14] I need the help of God Amen and I I do
[1:00:18] believe that it will help me yes and if
[1:00:21] my English is not very um good English
[1:00:25] that you can understand the holy spirit
[1:00:27] will give you the the revelation of that
[1:00:30] the thought that I try to just share
[1:00:33] with you but before preaching I I will
[1:00:37] um you know uh really thank uh this uh
[1:00:42] the pasture brother
[1:00:44] Israel uh for opening the the pulpit to
[1:00:48] me and also for for you know here I said
[1:00:52] well wonderful welcome come wonderful
[1:00:56] singing wonderful preaching wonderful
[1:00:59] where when I let uh Canada it was
[1:01:03] snowing there arriving here sun and very
[1:01:08] nice Sun very dry and very nice place so
[1:01:13] when I arve at my room last night I just
[1:01:16] have this thinking oh I feel so very
[1:01:19] well so Lord maybe I can come here move
[1:01:23] here just uh be in uh in uh among the
[1:01:27] the the Believers and just be uh
[1:01:30] relaxing here but I remember that on the
[1:01:33] Mount of transfiguration Peter has the
[1:01:36] same idea oh it's so good here Lord is
[1:01:39] so good here so we will make free
[1:01:41] Tabernacle you know the things you know
[1:01:44] but no I said tomorrow I have to go back
[1:01:48] to serve God in the field and I will do
[1:01:51] that because I know that uh all the
[1:01:55] things that the Lord has done in my life
[1:01:57] it's so much it deserve to be the first
[1:02:02] one he has not asked for that if you
[1:02:07] brother said if you uh receive Jesus
[1:02:10] Christ at the third place fourth place
[1:02:13] seventh he will come he will always come
[1:02:17] but it deserves the first
[1:02:21] place so it must be the of a preeminence
[1:02:25] in his bride so that's all for now I
[1:02:29] don't think if I ask a brother to put
[1:02:33] for me because I am not too much on
[1:02:36] techniques uh my uh quotes on PowerPoint
[1:02:41] uh presentation is it okay
[1:02:44] or I don't
[1:02:47] know if if it's it's okay okay good
[1:02:51] thank you so I think I will go very
[1:02:55] quickly now uh you know it's time to get
[1:03:00] serious with the coming of the Lord
[1:03:03] because you know um week after week week
[1:03:07] we are coming to church we are singing
[1:03:09] HS we are hearing the word and it seems
[1:03:12] that you
[1:03:14] know maybe we are not too uh too much
[1:03:19] about
[1:03:20] that the the Lord can can wait a little
[1:03:23] bit it seems
[1:03:25] but you know it's not the Lord uh it's
[1:03:28] not us waiting on the Lord It's the Lord
[1:03:30] waiting on us said brother he
[1:03:33] said the coming of La is already past
[1:03:37] due for a long time it's because of us
[1:03:40] because we have not taken our place
[1:03:42] because we have not given the message
[1:03:45] around us spread the gospel enough and
[1:03:48] he said so so it's time brothers and
[1:03:51] sister and when we saw all the things
[1:03:53] arriving around it it's time to get
[1:03:56] serious with the coming of the
[1:03:59] lord we we must wait now we if Jesus
[1:04:03] will come tonight I don't know he can
[1:04:05] come in 5 minutes he can come in 5 years
[1:04:07] I don't know when he will come he will
[1:04:10] come and we must be serious but the
[1:04:13] problem is do we know in what season of
[1:04:17] a time of the end we are or where are we
[1:04:23] at because in the scriptures he said
[1:04:26] there are several days at the son uh
[1:04:30] days of the son of man uh the scripture
[1:04:33] is Luke 17 verse
[1:04:38] 22 and he said unto the disciples the
[1:04:42] days will come when you shall desire to
[1:04:44] see one one of the days of a son of man
[1:04:49] there is many days of a son of
[1:04:53] man uh you know it was not the same day
[1:04:56] of a son of man when the disciples lived
[1:05:00] and fellowship with him before the cross
[1:05:03] and when Jesus after when Jesus appeared
[1:05:07] to them on the shores of the Sea of
[1:05:10] galileia after his resurrection
[1:05:13] different death always the same son of
[1:05:16] man but different death of the son of
[1:05:18] man and there are several days of the
[1:05:22] voice of a seventh Angel to Revelation
[1:05:27] 107 but in the days plural in the days
[1:05:32] of a voice of a seventh angel there are
[1:05:36] several death of a voice of a seventh
[1:05:39] Angels even spoke about the seven seven
[1:05:43] mountain peaks near Lima Montana which
[1:05:47] are symbols of his life story we have
[1:05:51] heard him telling about the three pools
[1:05:54] of his ministry several days of the
[1:05:58] voice of
[1:06:00] the seventh angel so in what day of the
[1:06:05] voice of the seventh angel are we living
[1:06:08] in it matters a lot if we don't want to
[1:06:12] miss what God is doing here and
[1:06:17] now I can remember the great things that
[1:06:21] God made has made for us throughout the
[1:06:25] years and even in the ministry of ofam
[1:06:28] when he was here on Earth that's days of
[1:06:31] the voice of the seventh angel but now
[1:06:36] in what day of the voice are
[1:06:42] we it's very
[1:06:44] important we must know what he's doing
[1:06:46] right
[1:06:47] now and we must look to another fact in
[1:06:51] the natural life we start as newborn
[1:06:55] babies we have seen last night the
[1:06:59] presentation of our precious brother and
[1:07:02] we we start a newborn babies to grow up
[1:07:06] in children then in teenagers until we
[1:07:08] are
[1:07:09] adults as a as and as single adults we
[1:07:14] found a wife or husband and then we be
[1:07:17] we became parents and even more
[1:07:20] grandparents life is not static but
[1:07:22] dynamic
[1:07:24] yeah I was so nervous I said I I will
[1:07:27] give thanks to the pastor and really uh
[1:07:32] always is warmly welcome that's very
[1:07:35] nice to me and you know not only to him
[1:07:40] I will really thanks you my precious
[1:07:44] friends from Shalom Tabernacle in

[1:07:52] many many me conventions and you know
[1:07:55] it's a lot of work a lot of Oh My My My
[1:08:00] in and when I arrive here and when I see
[1:08:04] that church in such an order everything

[1:08:15] pastor and your church you church if you
[1:08:19] are such a good church you can be proud
[1:08:21] of your pastor too because it's on on
[1:08:25] the both
[1:08:27] sides and so thank you s and specially
[1:08:32] also uh I would like to um give my
[1:08:35] thanks to a brother here brother Joshua
[1:08:38] Kate he was the one who take me pick me
[1:08:41] at the airport and from arriving in a in
[1:08:45] a count in a in a place in a city um
[1:08:49] last time I came here it was in
[1:08:52] 1978 so it's a long time ago and so uh I
[1:08:57] was with my precious brother brother per
[1:09:00] green and so uh when we you arrive there
[1:09:04] is somebody and he said okay we have a
[1:09:07] contact by phone and he came and we have
[1:09:10] just a good fellowship and after that uh
[1:09:14] yesterday I saw his precious wife two
[1:09:18] children uh his dad Etc all the family
[1:09:22] that's blessed my thank you brother
[1:09:24] Joshua for what you have done for me and
[1:09:26] so uh also uh because I am arriving here
[1:09:32] children children you know uh there is a
[1:09:35] special sister in that church that's the
[1:09:38] pastor's wife sister Sharon sister
[1:09:41] Sharon I don't know where she is uh
[1:09:44] right now but sister Sharon you know I
[1:09:47] remember her as a uh not as baby but I
[1:09:52] see I would say little girl very little
[1:09:57] girl and uh years passed and now when I
[1:10:01] I'm arriving you see not only she she is
[1:10:06] the wife of a pastor but she has three
[1:10:10] very nice children so that's something
[1:10:15] when I saw her at that time a little
[1:10:19] very little girl maybe two years I think
[1:10:22] maybe not even two years
[1:10:24] old she she was living she was very nice
[1:10:28] you know I saw somebody with babies
[1:10:30] babies everybody they they they love
[1:10:34] babies you know you know and they just
[1:10:37] said make us smile and Etc but a baby
[1:10:41] cannot do nothing for
[1:10:43] nobody you have to take care of him or
[1:10:47] her in all
[1:10:49] ways and remember Jesus Christ are all
[1:10:53] Lord when he came in half he was a baby
[1:10:57] and when he was the baby he cannot save
[1:11:01] you as a baby he cannot make anything
[1:11:04] for you as a baby he was just a baby
[1:11:07] even in Greek we have different
[1:11:10] different terms I don't want to to to
[1:11:12] give my G to Greek tonight it's enough
[1:11:15] to to to speak in English not even to
[1:11:18] translate and give in in in in French I
[1:11:22] can I can go there but you know we have
[1:11:24] term to say U baby in Greek we have term
[1:11:28] to say pretty little child we have term
[1:11:31] to say child we have term to say young
[1:11:35] boy we have term you know we have words
[1:11:37] for that and even in the scriptures if
[1:11:40] you are looking in your Bible in the
[1:11:43] Book of Luke you have all these kind of
[1:11:46] of terms apply to our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:50] when he was 12 years old at the
[1:11:53] Jerusalem Temple he cannot be your
[1:11:56] savior there no he cannot be because he
[1:12:00] was not uh in in the in the statute to
[1:12:04] to give his life for you and me even he
[1:12:07] is the Son of God no he has to go a
[1:12:11] ground up and even at the age of 30
[1:12:15] years old when he was baptized by John
[1:12:18] the Baptist in um um in the Jordan River
[1:12:22] you know the
[1:12:24] the the father says something great
[1:12:27] about him this is my beloved Son but
[1:12:31] stop there yes sir he was the beloved
[1:12:34] Son of God but you know he has to go up
[1:12:38] ground up until he arrive on the on the
[1:12:43] Mount of transfiguration and when he
[1:12:45] arrive at the Mount of
[1:12:47] transfiguration when I'm said that's the
[1:12:49] day of adoption of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:53] amen he has follow exactly the same way
[1:12:56] that we have to
[1:12:58] follow so when he was adopted on the
[1:13:03] Mount of
[1:13:05] transfiguration after not too long time
[1:13:08] he he gave his life for us on the cross
[1:13:11] of golat he was prepared now that's the
[1:13:14] time so you see the same in Christian
[1:13:18] Life we are babies when little children
[1:13:21] when children when young men are finally
[1:13:24] even fathers in John first epistle words
[1:13:27] things change things improve as a day
[1:13:30] follow another day in an
[1:13:33] onward unseizing constant Rhythm we must
[1:13:38] be always on the move as the brother
[1:13:42] sung uh I think U last night we must be
[1:13:47] always on the Move bam said that we are
[1:13:50] not born as adult but as baby I speak
[1:13:54] about spiritual birth New Birth but he
[1:13:59] also said that this message is not for
[1:14:02] babies and it's easy to understand it's
[1:14:06] for the bride and a baby girl or little
[1:14:10] 10 years old girl they are not in the
[1:14:12] right condition to be a bride
[1:14:17] potentially potentially this little girl
[1:14:20] she is or one day she will will be a
[1:14:23] bride she will be a mother potentially
[1:14:27] but at the age of 10 impossible for her
[1:14:30] to be the bride so you see we have to
[1:14:34] move on we have to grow uh and thanks be
[1:14:38] to God for all the his anointing
[1:14:41] throughout the decades past but here and
[1:14:45] now we need a new a special
[1:14:50] anointing you see um 50 27 years ago
[1:14:54] when I was a just a young Pentecostal
[1:14:58] evangelist when I received the message I
[1:15:01] was 17 years old I began to preach uh
[1:15:05] just after um about uh just two months
[1:15:10] after
[1:15:11] uh when I was uh 15 years old so another
[1:15:15] story that's the grace of God if I am
[1:15:18] here here it's the grace of God if you
[1:15:21] are here that's the grace of God and if
[1:15:24] the things have been improved during the
[1:15:27] day that's the grace of God as we heard
[1:15:29] this the first message the grace of God
[1:15:31] it's all grace of God it's not even my
[1:15:34] faith it's the faith of Jesus in me I
[1:15:37] have no Holiness it's his Holiness all
[1:15:40] the things that we have comes from the
[1:15:43] Lord so 57 years ago when I receive this
[1:15:48] message and believe it after a personal
[1:15:51] spiritual experience almost my all my
[1:15:56] preaching preaching was about brother
[1:15:58] Bram Ministry to show the fulfill
[1:16:02] fulfilling of fulfillment of Malachi 45
[1:16:07] Luke
[1:16:08] 17:30 uh Revelation
[1:16:11] 10:7 it was just that I went from City
[1:16:15] to City uh to this all to another
[1:16:19] meeting all and uh we have received from
[1:16:22] Brother per green the the movies of Bram
[1:16:26] the two movies you know so I just um
[1:16:31] play the the movies at that time it's a
[1:16:33] big uh it's not now as we are very DVDs
[1:16:38] and all the things that we have and to
[1:16:41] make the
[1:16:42] translation we are we we are not enough
[1:16:46] Rich to pay to to put that on the on the
[1:16:49] uh on the tape so uh we have recorded on
[1:16:53] a little um record tape tape recorder
[1:16:58] and uh we just try to um adjust the
[1:17:03] speed of of the tape in order that what
[1:17:06] Ram says we will be in French really
[1:17:09] translate you know just speeding a
[1:17:11] little bit or just increasing or just
[1:17:14] limiting Etc it does veryy and first of
[1:17:17] all I I just myself each time I just say
[1:17:22] the word
[1:17:30] it's from fren translation of
[1:17:33] a a movie of a film and so so much
[1:17:37] things so much time and we we just try I
[1:17:41] preach always the same the same message
[1:17:43] the sign of the
[1:17:45] Messiah that's what we preach at that
[1:17:48] time but we have really a very good
[1:17:51] time you know
[1:17:54] but uh after that you know we began to
[1:17:59] translate in French
[1:18:01] um books and tapes in French and send
[1:18:04] them to french- speaking countries
[1:18:06] everywhere the fire was lit of wind of
[1:18:09] the spirit was fueling it it was another
[1:18:13] day very good day but then we went
[1:18:17] deeper in all the treasures that God
[1:18:19] gave us gave to us in this precious
[1:18:21] message and it was no more for us at
[1:18:24] that time brother Ram's message but our
[1:18:27] lord Jesus Christ's message to his bride
[1:18:32] that he brought To Us by Brother
[1:18:35] Bram the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:18:39] Whispering sweet love words to his
[1:18:43] Earthly bride and we lunch out into the
[1:18:46] deep of rapture adoption stature of a
[1:18:50] perfect man manifested sons of God pool
[1:18:53] an over deep things of God it was still
[1:18:56] an over day of the voice of a seventh
[1:18:59] angel you know we are always in the
[1:19:02] death of the voice of a seventh angel we
[1:19:06] don't need a new message we don't need a
[1:19:08] new revelation we don't need a new
[1:19:10] messenger or new something we have the
[1:19:12] message of the hour this message is
[1:19:16] still the same
[1:19:18] message and God will never change the
[1:19:21] things because he has made everything
[1:19:24] this Elijah came and this Elijah restore
[1:19:29] all
[1:19:31] things all things have been restored but
[1:19:34] the question is is are all things
[1:19:38] restored in my life and in your life my
[1:19:41] brother or sister that's the thing
[1:19:44] everything is rest restored but this
[1:19:47] restoration must take place in each one
[1:19:50] of
[1:19:51] us
[1:19:53] so this is the same message but we are
[1:19:57] going going going more
[1:20:01] so uh very good and impressive not
[1:20:04] worthy day but now we are no more
[1:20:07] spiritual babies neither spiritual young
[1:20:10] people spiritually
[1:20:12] speaking we are no more in the same day
[1:20:15] of a voice in which we were years ago if
[1:20:19] we have stopped in our growth in our
[1:20:22] progress there is something
[1:20:25] wrong
[1:20:27] yes you are coming in a church and you
[1:20:29] have babies maybe there are 20 years in
[1:20:33] the message 20 years in the church very
[1:20:36] good members but babies if there is just
[1:20:40] a little putting thing little little
[1:20:43] things that disturb them oh my it's a
[1:20:46] big problem and you have to take the
[1:20:49] deacons the pastor and everybody to
[1:20:52] because a baby is a baby that's
[1:20:56] right but this message is not for
[1:21:00] babies we will not
[1:21:03] have a special meeting with a uh girl of
[1:21:09] 10 years old to speak about marage
[1:21:13] no you understand me so if you are
[1:21:17] talking about what uh God what want to
[1:21:21] the bride
[1:21:23] we must be more than babies more than
[1:21:27] young people more we must be mature it's
[1:21:33] very
[1:21:33] important very important
[1:21:38] so we must have growth to reach maturity
[1:21:44] so the spirit of the Lord stimulate us
[1:21:47] to go ahead to launch out into the deep
[1:21:52] and to build believe and see there is
[1:21:54] now an un of day of the voice of the
[1:21:58] same seventh angel one glorious day a
[1:22:02] day now when God is fulfilling all his
[1:22:07] precious promises to his bride and make
[1:22:09] her a word bride A Perfect Bride a pure
[1:22:14] vergin bride
[1:22:19] amen we have heard all the things
[1:22:21] happening uh especially
[1:22:25] um um from uh uh
[1:22:29] 2023 uh no 20 uh 20 uh uh 20 15 2015 we
[1:22:36] are people for decades in the message be
[1:22:41] they began to to deny that message to
[1:22:44] say so much things about bam Etc even
[1:22:48] trying to find the price of the candies
[1:22:52] ET Etc to prove that brother bam said
[1:22:55] things that are not right Etc and they
[1:22:59] said about the the cloud so many things
[1:23:02] you know Etc and many we we are so many
[1:23:08] many many things so in the message the
[1:23:12] evening
[1:23:13] messenger said something very
[1:23:18] great the evening
[1:23:20] messenger uh 65
[1:23:23] uh January
[1:23:25] 16 notice when the message is rejected
[1:23:31] and the messenger seems to be
[1:23:35] defeated seems not is
[1:23:39] defeated seems seems to be defeated
[1:23:43] that's when God stepped on the
[1:23:47] scene his message is over God step
[1:23:53] on the scene Hallelujah that's I believe
[1:23:57] from deep within my heart the time has
[1:23:59] come this sees the day this sees the
[1:24:02] hour when God is stepping on the scene
[1:24:05] hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[1:24:08] Lord in this perilous times after this
[1:24:12] pandemic virus circumstances in this
[1:24:14] trouble moment we have to Proclaim that
[1:24:17] we are not defeated but we are more than
[1:24:21] over fromers more than conquerors
[1:24:25] winners not
[1:24:27] losers but but I will I will add through
[1:24:32] through our great God and savior our
[1:24:36] Lord Jesus Christ not by our own power
[1:24:40] no even in the in
[1:24:43] the uh in the zerob uh uh commission it
[1:24:49] he said not by your might not by by m my
[1:24:52] spirit say the Lord that's the spirit of
[1:24:56] God doing the things and so uh why why
[1:25:02] God is acting actually in in our lives
[1:25:08] it's because he will give us a fresh and
[1:25:12] renewed anointing for what to reach the
[1:25:16] goal and the goal is to come unto the
[1:25:20] stature of a perfect man to be totally
[1:25:24] transformed in the likeness of Jesus
[1:25:27] Christ to receive the fullness of the
[1:25:30] adoption to live the great Oneness God
[1:25:35] and man becoming one one
[1:25:40] forever demonstrating Mighty glorious
[1:25:43] wonders just before our going up in the
[1:25:46] Rapture and it's all the Amazing Grace
[1:25:50] of the Lord the special rapturing Grace
[1:25:53] only for his bride that we have to
[1:25:56] preach now in such a day we don't just
[1:25:59] preach Grace we preach rapturing Grace
[1:26:03] because we are in the time of a Rapture
[1:26:07] am
[1:26:08] amen you know many message Believers are
[1:26:13] not aware about the difference between
[1:26:16] the appearing and the coming of Our
[1:26:21] Lord they they do not know that we are
[1:26:24] living in the time of the appearing of
[1:26:27] Jesus Christ waiting for his coming
[1:26:33] because he will come literally said
[1:26:36] brother we are waiting is coming but
[1:26:40] already he has appeared Among
[1:26:44] Us they do not know that our bridegroom
[1:26:48] is Among Us that his presence is here
[1:26:53] and now to bring us into
[1:26:58] Perfection is ear I have not the the
[1:27:03] quote but the
[1:27:04] quote comes to my mind where said my
[1:27:09] Ministry is to declare him that he is
[1:27:14] here
[1:27:15] am he is
[1:27:17] here not simply said the Holy Spirit Etc
[1:27:21] no he is here the person of the Lord
[1:27:25] Jesus Christ is in his bride to prepare
[1:27:29] the bride to make that bride a pure word
[1:27:33] bride because he is the word and when he
[1:27:36] will be uh at the great uh super uh
[1:27:41] wedding supper uh he will unite he is
[1:27:44] already unit with us because the
[1:27:47] marriage is on this Earth but it has
[1:27:51] taken place marage is always taken place
[1:27:54] marage is the promises you know but we
[1:27:56] are going to a wedding brother said we
[1:27:58] are not going to a marage we are going
[1:28:00] to a wedding that's the
[1:28:02] difference before you are going to the
[1:28:04] wedding there is a you know uh a
[1:28:08] covenant be between the that that that
[1:28:11] brother and that sister their promises
[1:28:14] and their promises that's their marriage
[1:28:16] but after that they have to come before
[1:28:19] everybody and they they have a wedding
[1:28:22] and the wedding from that wedding they
[1:28:23] can live together uh and other family so
[1:28:29] uh most of the people they don't know
[1:28:32] that in the message I went somewhere and
[1:28:36] there are people saying oh he has come
[1:28:39] yes he has come he brother bam said so
[1:28:41] he has come but he has come in the sense
[1:28:44] he he has appeared his ear in the in the
[1:28:48] form of a anointed word his ear amen but
[1:28:53] he will come physically literally he
[1:28:56] will come and so there are some so no no
[1:28:59] it's all finish it's now no and the
[1:29:02] overs they tried to say we will stay
[1:29:05] with the Bible and they took the uh what
[1:29:08] the evangelicals believe for for most
[1:29:11] than two centuries but was said no there
[1:29:15] is no Jesus actually he will come and
[1:29:19] they don't know but appearing and coming
[1:29:21] are to things completely
[1:29:24] different just link together but uh you
[1:29:27] see there is a a scripture 1 John
[1:29:31] chapter 2 verse 28 1 John chap chapter 2
[1:29:35] ver 28 and now little children abide in
[1:29:40] him that when he shall appear we may
[1:29:44] have confidence and not be ashamed
[1:29:48] before him at his coming appearing and
[1:29:53] coming and after that he said now we are
[1:29:56] children of God yes we are children of
[1:29:59] God but what we will be is not actually
[1:30:04] revealed but when it will be revealed we
[1:30:07] will know him exactly as he know us
[1:30:11] because that's the manifestation of the
[1:30:14] sons of
[1:30:16] God and you know when we are speaking
[1:30:20] about adoption adoption I will take some
[1:30:23] Greek adoption it's in Greek Yia Yia
[1:30:27] it's adoption a son excuse me excuse me
[1:30:32] f i preach in fres Sons son is Yos on is
[1:30:39] techon you know
[1:30:41] techon children techon children is not
[1:30:45] with adoption no you have the Life of
[1:30:48] Christ you have been born again that's
[1:30:51] okay but when you are yours that's your
[1:30:55] son and Os means otes adoption that's
[1:31:01] the thing so I have many quotes but we
[1:31:04] will just going through this
[1:31:07] quote this is the close of a royal seeds
[1:31:10] waiting is here is here the appearing of
[1:31:14] Christ there's a place in the Bible you
[1:31:16] know I didn't got time to go into it
[1:31:18] says the appearing of Christ and then
[1:31:20] the coming of Christ that's two
[1:31:22] different things Al together the
[1:31:23] appearing and the coming is appearing
[1:31:25] now Etc next
[1:31:28] quote it says the same thing in all
[1:31:32] these quotes here the appearing of the
[1:31:34] Lord and the coming of the Lord he said
[1:31:38] here
[1:31:40] um now uh 76 now the appearing of the
[1:31:45] Lord is now now when he is appearing in
[1:31:47] his people his Spirit working among them
[1:31:49] proving that it's him with them getting
[1:31:52] them ready for RT the Rapture for the
[1:31:54] coming of the Lord to catch away the
[1:31:56] bride see the appearing and the coming
[1:32:00] two things you can uh just go uh so let
[1:32:06] me say to you if we are no more than
[1:32:09] another religious group with its
[1:32:12] Doctrine and Customs we have not
[1:32:14] understood the purpose of God with the
[1:32:17] great message he has sent to us for
[1:32:19] brother bam going to church to be a good
[1:32:23] member of what we call now a message
[1:32:26] Church giving respect to the pastor
[1:32:28] paying time offering sharing some
[1:32:31] responsibilities in the congregation and
[1:32:33] trying to live the best good life we can
[1:32:36] even if all these thing are right that
[1:32:40] does not make us real message
[1:32:45] Believers because Jesus said to the
[1:32:47] religious scholars in his time and they
[1:32:50] know the scriptures so much Matthew
[1:32:55] 22:29 ye do not knowing the scriptures
[1:33:00] nor the power of
[1:33:02] God I remember the testimony of our
[1:33:05] precious brother uh last uh morning uh
[1:33:10] yesterday morning when he said I was in
[1:33:13] the church I you know but I was not born
[1:33:16] again that's terrible and many people in
[1:33:19] many message churches they are message
[1:33:22] there are in the church there are real
[1:33:24] believers they believe we had they know
[1:33:27] yes brother bam was a prophet of God we
[1:33:29] I believe the message I believe
[1:33:31] everything but they are not born again
[1:33:34] and that's the problem and if we have
[1:33:37] not be born again as we our precious
[1:33:39] brother whisper say last night we we
[1:33:42] have not begin the things we must be
[1:33:45] born again it's the
[1:33:48] foundation so to be real message
[1:33:51] Believers to have been revived through
[1:33:53] the shout the message of yah is much
[1:33:56] much much more that to know so well this
[1:34:00] message that we are able to quote
[1:34:02] brother bam on all issues uh it is much
[1:34:07] much more than to tell all the details
[1:34:10] of his so special ministry as so
[1:34:13] peculiar life we have a letter of a
[1:34:16] message but that not enough that does
[1:34:19] not mean that we got the spirit of
[1:34:21] message God has sent a prophet messenger
[1:34:25] with a so powerful message to make us
[1:34:27] member of his body of his bride ready
[1:34:31] for the rapture we have a high calling
[1:34:34] we have a Heavenly calling we are

[1:41:18] things the world needs this morning is
[1:41:21] the power of the god of Elijah you might
[1:41:24] have spoke with tongues and shouted and
[1:41:27] run off the floor but what we need is
[1:41:30] the power of the god of Pentecost to
[1:41:33] produce to produce what the lives and
[1:41:36] thing that was living that day in the
[1:41:38] apostolic power a second handed Rob was

[1:42:04] brother don't you be afraid to ask God
[1:42:07] anything you must demand God or ask God
[1:42:10] for anything that he has promised for if
[1:42:13] I am introducing a God that's omnipotent
[1:42:16] and all powerful and if I be a servant
[1:42:19] of God I must do the works of God and if
[1:42:23] I do the work of God I must demand of
[1:42:26] God to bring these things to pass just
[1:42:31] listen very closely now because he the
[1:42:34] Lord is demanding of me to
[1:42:37] produce the
[1:42:40] impossible to produce the impossible we

[1:43:55] Ghost take complete control on each on
[1:43:57] us on us and get ready for the going up
[1:43:59] of rupture so the prayer of of of
[1:44:02] brother bam if I had the privilege of
[1:44:06] speaking to some people Lord it was not
[1:44:10] to glorify nothing but this person who
[1:44:14] the peoples wondering who it is they
[1:44:18] know that man cannot do this they know
[1:44:21] it's beyond man to know these things but
[1:44:24] the people says what is it Lord we know
[1:44:29] it's you it's Jesus Christ in the person
[1:44:33] of the Holy Ghost he is the Holy Ghost I
[1:44:37] come from God I go to God and we see the
[1:44:41] great Pillar of Fire Fire Among Us Lord

[1:44:46] of the Bible with Moses we seen it in

[1:44:59] confirmation it's been the message each
[1:45:03] time God made man and woman no longer

[1:45:11] they come out of that thing give their
[1:45:13] lives completely to God and believe not
[1:45:18] trust just upon Terror and things of man
[1:45:21] but trust in the Living God while these
[1:45:24] holid days are going on the cry still is
[1:45:28] who is this what is it what is it all

[1:49:41] the first time coming this
[1:49:43] way and we want to say thank you for all
[1:49:47] your love and kindness
[1:49:51] it kind of a make me wants to come
[1:49:56] back
[1:49:57] and our pastor
[1:50:01] there from Phoenix is it right brother
[1:50:05] Amanda yeah he came by
[1:50:08] us sometime ago and he preached for us
[1:50:12] it was a wonderful zice he preach about
[1:50:15] the mind of man how the human mind could
[1:50:18] kind of play tricks in them it was
[1:50:20] wonderful we always remember him and we
[1:50:23] really had some wonderful time here and
[1:50:26] I believe it's time for us to stop
[1:50:27] because uh all the great
[1:50:31] preaching the Wednesday night in
[1:50:35] Phoenix Thursday night in Phoenix and
[1:50:38] Friday night with our
[1:50:40] brother and Saturday with about a Paul
[1:50:45] it was
[1:50:46] wonderful and then Saturday night again
[1:50:49] with brother whisper you know my girl
[1:50:52] she was telling brother whisper brother
[1:50:54] whisper brother whisper who is Brother
[1:50:56] whisper and then when he came into
[1:50:59] church I didn't know who he was but
[1:51:01] something said he looks
[1:51:04] special and he really was special we
[1:51:06] give God thanks for that and then with
[1:51:08] brother Ferguson's message it was
[1:51:12] wonderful and brother F where is he had
[1:51:15] yeah you know I've known by face since
[1:51:18] 85 and I think as you get older you
[1:51:21] get more powerful in the
[1:51:25] Lord I pray the Lord will bless him and
[1:51:27] keep him always in the straight and
[1:51:28] narrow
[1:51:29] path you know with all the preaching
[1:51:32] that we've had over the past
[1:51:34] week the purpose of the message was
[1:51:38] to kind of
[1:51:40] uh let the word live in you amen I
[1:51:45] because that's the most important thing
[1:51:48] is that your faith could grow I wouldn't
[1:51:51] Minister because we wouldn't have the
[1:51:53] time maybe brother Israel the next time
[1:51:55] going to come back but just to let you
[1:51:58] know the purpose of the minister you see
[1:52:00] they did the job they deliver you the
[1:52:04] word of
[1:52:05] God and I've noticed the
[1:52:08] um in these meetings there was no
[1:52:12] competition like Minister competing each
[1:52:14] other they compliment each other amen
[1:52:18] they were led by the spirit this one
[1:52:19] bring a message not knowing the other
[1:52:21] one and the Lord would come down and
[1:52:24] just show you he's trying to do
[1:52:26] something he's trying to stir our faith
[1:52:28] because the prophet told us the bride
[1:52:31] will be waiting for the revelation of
[1:52:32] that Rapture and you said that
[1:52:34] Revelation is Faith and you know he say
[1:52:37] fate is like a little whip that standed
[1:52:39] close to you that can give you whatever
[1:52:42] you want it's in you the message there
[1:52:46] you see the Fate is there you receiving
[1:52:48] the word now it's for that Faith to come
[1:52:52] alive that the word that we've been
[1:52:55] listening to the message take flesh not
[1:52:58] like with Mary when Joseph was reading
[1:53:01] the scripture she said read it again
[1:53:04] something happened she began to meditate
[1:53:07] on it maybe she heard it before but that
[1:53:10] was the time that that word came alive
[1:53:13] amen you see because the desire of every
[1:53:16] minister right is to see the people get
[1:53:19] ready for the
[1:53:20] Rapture that's good and that Rapture the
[1:53:23] prophet said it's in
[1:53:26] you he said all you need for this
[1:53:29] journey even the Rapture he said it in
[1:53:31] you when you receive the Holy Ghost so
[1:53:34] the word is there but now you and I must
[1:53:37] bring it
[1:53:38] alive and the important thing is to stay
[1:53:42] with only you and I that because he told
[1:53:46] us the day you're take into your heart
[1:53:47] one
[1:53:48] word that's not the word of God that's
[1:53:52] the you separate yourself from God he
[1:53:54] said when you question when a question
[1:53:57] come from the word of God in your heart
[1:54:00] he say you stop you can't go further
[1:54:05] people may think they going further but
[1:54:07] anytime you question God you stop right
[1:54:11] there and you had to go back and made it
[1:54:14] right so it's important that you stay
[1:54:18] with the word you've been taught
[1:54:20] and you have access to this message
[1:54:23] behold I send you Elijah the prophet you
[1:54:27] know one of the reason why it's
[1:54:28] important that you receive only what I
[1:54:31] Prophet said am he said because that
[1:54:34] body that we looking for that translated
[1:54:38] body to be change in a moment he said it
[1:54:41] will
[1:54:43] materialize around the word that's in
[1:54:46] you the word you've been receiving Maybe
[1:54:49] the devil say you forget it but he say
[1:54:51] they will
[1:54:52] materialize around that word so if we
[1:54:56] receive
[1:54:57] something that's not the word of
[1:55:00] God we just can't
[1:55:02] go because only that
[1:55:05] word he will change so stay with the
[1:55:10] word stay with that which the prophet
[1:55:13] said because that's what God
[1:55:16] will anoint amen and good better
[1:55:21] whisper P better f
[1:55:25] f the word of the Lord came to us always
[1:55:29] are
[1:55:30] wonderful but now it's us to let that
[1:55:34] word live the faith is in
[1:55:38] us he told us we have faith Paul said we
[1:55:40] have faith you see Peter said there's a
[1:55:42] fast T
[1:55:43] coming and we have to get over get away
[1:55:46] from
[1:55:47] that Noah wrote over his storm but there
[1:55:51] Firestorm you have to be changed in a
[1:55:55] moment so each and every one of
[1:55:58] us got to get to the
[1:56:00] place where the fth within us something
[1:56:05] happened that in that moment in
[1:56:08] time you'll be changed so it's in there
[1:56:13] you received the word you've been
[1:56:15] receiving the word but now the word must
[1:56:18] live and your faith must grow to that
[1:56:21] place where in a moment in a twinkle of
[1:56:23] an eye it'll be changed but it's not
[1:56:26] only
[1:56:28] congregation because I always said the
[1:56:31] nightmare of every
[1:56:33] minister is that his people going to
[1:56:36] Rapture and he had left
[1:56:40] behind I mean it's a
[1:56:43] nightmare you come to church and this
[1:56:45] one is gone and this one is gone you
[1:56:48] know one day my wife played a tree
[1:56:49] freaking
[1:56:51] me and it stayed with me it kind of
[1:56:55] a I know she was in the house I call her
[1:56:59] she's not there I look in every room
[1:57:02] she's not there my heart be to beat
[1:57:04] what's going
[1:57:05] on she thought it was a joke she was
[1:57:08] hiding from
[1:57:10] me
[1:57:14] imagine the congregation gone and the
[1:57:17] ministers Left Behind it's a nightmare
[1:57:20] but that's why we got to know
[1:57:25] now you you see you have that Assurance
[1:57:28] of the
[1:57:29] Rapture and is that word that you
[1:57:32] receive that take flesh in US amen Elias
[1:57:37] truly shall first come and restore all
[1:57:39] things the prophet did his
[1:57:40] part but that one must be manifested in
[1:57:44] US amen so I pray the Lord will help us
[1:57:47] as we leave these meetings
[1:57:51] we will live the
[1:57:52] way he want us to live because these
[1:57:56] minister they didn't just preach just
[1:57:59] having a good
[1:58:01] sermon I stood of God as the Watchman in
[1:58:04] the
[1:58:06] wall they wanted you to know that this
[1:58:09] message is real and this
[1:58:12] message is alive
[1:58:15] amen I never questioned the word of God
[1:58:19] he said that's the day you stop taking
[1:58:21] from the tree of life and you said death
[1:58:26] steading and let no one regardless of
[1:58:29] who they are as one of the I think it's
[1:58:33] brother Paul said I thought I was the
[1:58:35] only one that's saying that but I heard
[1:58:37] him said it I I told some my people he
[1:58:39] said look if you come in
[1:58:41] here and you're not 100%
[1:58:44] convinced that you can make the
[1:58:47] Rapture with what we teach you here you
[1:58:50] better find a
[1:58:52] place because at that day there should
[1:58:56] be no question in your
[1:58:58] mind not one question you should be
[1:59:01] certain you see because we choose a
[1:59:02] church to help guide us to Eternal
[1:59:05] destination so you should be certain
[1:59:08] that what you're receiving is
[1:59:11] enough to take you
[1:59:14] there there's a little song sister
[1:59:18] sh I'm going to

[2:00:08] loving brought
[2:00:11] pain and that

[2:01:41] nothing to

[2:02:52] message that which You' been hearding
[2:02:54] for the past week will come alive in our
[2:02:58] heart cuz we'll be going the Rapture
[2:03:00] will be coming but Ram said that he said
[2:03:03] when the bride recognize who she is he
[2:03:06] said then the Rapture will go because
[2:03:09] the Rapture is in us he said it's there
[2:03:11] recogn I he said
[2:03:14] look if you have just a shadow of God in
[2:03:18] you that's he said you're able to create
[2:03:22] a world yes and go living it amen he
[2:03:26] said but it's he said there's no weak
[2:03:28] part and strong part in God it's all
[2:03:29] strong he said be controlled by a law
[2:03:32] and that law is Faith as much faith that
[2:03:35] he will permit you to release he said
[2:03:38] but when the scriptures
[2:03:41] fulfilled then they'll be
[2:03:44] gone so as Str of God as the brothers
[2:03:47] were telling you
[2:03:50] you have what it
[2:03:51] takes to go he said you have power to
[2:03:54] raise yourself
[2:03:55] up but now we must believe
[2:04:01] that somehow believe it I'm going into
[2:04:05] the
[2:04:06] Rapture I'm going into the
[2:04:08] Rapture I'm going into the

[2:04:31] anchored down and you recognize who I
[2:04:33] am what am I doing
[2:04:36] here if in me lays the power to create
[2:04:40] Heaven and
[2:04:41] Earth yeah he
[2:04:44] said he said our teopan is right here to
[2:04:48] give us a charge like a charge going
[2:04:50] through a battery so it's here right
[2:04:52] around
