[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you good morning the reading of God's word go into the adult Sunday School portion of the service we're in the message God hiding in Simplicity we'd like to welcome each of you to the house of the Lord and um we're going to read in Isaiah chapter 53 for scripture reading verses one and two and the scripture says who hath believed our report and to whom is the armor of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he had no form nor calmliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he's despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not amen we're going to be taking 20 minutes of this tape paragraph 252 to 308 in the message God's hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same amen as we prepare to go there let us sing only believe before we do as we play softly let's bow our heads for word of Prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us together once again we thank you Lord for the opportunity to hear your word here this morning to start our day off Lord oh God reading the Bible praying to you Lord hearing the word of the day oh God just prepare our hearts bless the Sunday School classes the other the other classes Lord and then those that are on their way here today speak to our hearts we pray we love you we ask these blessings in Jesus name amen believe only believe that all things are possible only [Music] oh [Music] only believe that all things are possible only me I bless you may be seated amen now oh I got to skip some of this from Eden from Eden it as uh uh Khan been prophesied that there was coming a messiah all the way from ease now I'm going to skip over a few of my scriptures I got wrote down here in notes just to get the message off in time if I can God hiding in humility now talk fast but yet I want you to catch this okay since Eden it had been prophesying that there would come a messiah it was foretold what kind of a person he would be we could linger a long time you know the Bible what he would be what kind of a person he'd be Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like me they know that that Messiah was to be a prophet the kind of a Ministry he would have with him all the prophet spoke of what he would do they spoke of it as symbols and it went Plum over the top of the head and Plumb under their estwency one under one over the other one see by the time that he arrived on the scene of time the people to whom he was sent had their own interpretation of what that he was to be in their own imaginary interpretation the Bible never changed the Bible is always the same that's the reason I say the scripture says and I stay with that the Bible is of no private interpretation so Methodist Baptist Pentecostals don't try to put your interpretation you could have said it don't mean that it means this it means just what it says just exactly someone said how can I don't know how that's not me to say that it's God to take care of that he's the one who said it not me and he'll take care of his own but now look this Messiah being prophesied the prophets told just exactly how he would come what he would do when he comes but the own private interpretation of it amongst the people and what he calm he was in such a simple way in Simplicity until the whole church group stumbled over is that right amen they're those man who had been taught a man could not be a teacher a priest until he was born in a certain lineage that's Levi and this thing he is great great great great great great great grandfather was a priest laying right in that word in the temple day and night like the Catholic priests or the minister that's a handed down Minister from generation to the certain churches and so forth my great-great-grandfather was a Methodist Bishop my grandfather was a bishop and so forth see all that lived right in the word but they had formed their own way of it and their children had accepted it in such a way that the fathers had taught it until the fathers had taught her off of the real way and they've made such an organization out of it when the spirit controversent truth they couldn't receive it and that's the same thing today I don't mean to be rude but that's right it's the same thing today they make it so so complicated and some other way they teach her it's like it's been said God don't have any Grand children you know that God has sons and he has daughters but no grandsons and granddaughters every man must pay the same price and come the same way just as your father did so much you now so he was so simple when this Messiah for four thousand years every Prophet spoke of him David sung of him and all down through and when he come the people had their own idea built up what he must do I was going to do how was all explained brought out on church and everything until when he come in that real simple way it just it just ruined their theology see they didn't know it become according to the word now do you believe that God spoke to the prophets that that Messiah would come in a certain way it's too bad we haven't got about another hour we could go up here and explain how it was we all know how it was or most of us how God said he would come and how thou Bethlehem of Judy are that the least amongst them all down through there and I would do and what he would do see and yet he was so simple to those great Scholars had got it so mixed up till they missed it but you know Jesus didn't come contrary to the word he come according to the word but contrary to their interpretation see um he taught things that was against their ecclesiastical training about him now they said now for instance when Messiah comes certainly he'll come up to the templates that campuses or ever who's high priest I have arrived he'll come with a 10 million Angel salute that God will say all right fellows down there you're already a ramadi church or my people I'm going to turn the pranker and let the Carters of Heaven down I'm sending him aside to you this morning I'll let it land right out there in the yard and all the people get around say doctor so and so you and doctor so and so you all can stand at the head to greet him first you see that's perhaps something might be thinking today it sounds a little rational but I don't I'm trying to make a point and and there is that's the way it's going to be and if it don't come that way it's not right it's an antichrist if it don't come this that way it's an antichrist you see so it won't be and so then there'll be a then the next thing comes down will be about a 10 million Angel salute with their bands and they'll land out there in the yard where Solomon built the temple and all all up and down through here with this holy place where Saints and sages had died and so forth yes Jesus said you Hypocrites you sons of the devil he said you garnish the tombs of the prophets and your fathers put them in there that's right right how many righteous men and Prophets are sent to you and still you swayed every one of them see but what would he call Righteous then what they call Fanatics and cranks yes there they thought it would come that way but when he come in a stable bored of a a virgin we're just a common Carpenter for a foster father and a little unknown girl see not the high priest daughter or what more he he come as uh from a little lady that lived down in the in a little old mean country called Nazareth and just a common witterer his wife is dead he had some children Joseph and um and she was engaged and then he come with a black name to begin with they said he was illegitimately born oh my that hit their polish too hard amen their educational ethics cannot swallow that their interpretation of the scriptures know nothing about that but yet it was though thus saith the Lord [Music] Shivers me to think it and to see the same thing reoccurring again God cannot change that's already 12. yes if Charlotte stopper just oh thank you assistant still just a little bit still now this is I'm basing something here for a message coming see and I'll try to let you out just quickly maybe next 10 to 15 minutes if we can God bless you notice now you're so simple that it it it just missed the mark for them but it hit God's mark see it hit the word he come just exactly the way he said but they their interpretation of it was wrong the interpretation of the liver and Moses time was wrong the interpretation of time of Noah was wrong see but God comes according to his word and then Jesus came in and he taught things that was contrary if thou be the Messiah do such and such as if thou be come off the cross and show it to us now see but God don't clown for people God just does the things that's pleasing and right they thought such a one or certainly have to come with a great salute of angels but he come by stable and to their own polished ethics it was ridiculous for an ordinary human being to think that almighty God the Great Mighty Jehovah who owned the Earth and Creed the whole thing couldn't fix a place for his own child to be born better than some cow barn over a manure pile how could there see what was it God in some Simplicity that's what made him so great uh see the ethics of Education cannot belittle itself like that see it cannot stand it but God is so great that he brought himself down to that not even of clothes to put on his own child think of it and the world there was no room in the end and he went into cow stable a little a little ledge a little cave-like back in the side of a hill and there upon a straw bed Supreme the son of God oh that was a lot different from meeting up there and his mother was uh to be mother she was found to be mother all months before they was even engaged to be married or even married she was to be mother and the people saw it and they know that it was this the way and Mary in her own heart she knowed what was going on and Joseph didn't understand but the angel of the Lord came to him tonight saying Joseph you're a son of David don't fear and take unto you marry your wife or that's not nothing bad but that is of the Holy Ghost let's settled it the man Joseph with such connection with God that God could speak to him but the day we get our ecclesiastical jacket so drawn around us so nothing can speak to us outside of the ecclesiastical group that we belong to I don't want to get harsh or a rat going to go out leave that alone right there notice but you understand what I mean notice the stable was ridiculous for them the Polish we don't even have a uh no record where he ever candid one day of school and yet at the age of 12 years old or a simple boy confounded the priest amen oh my why is it God hiding himself I feel pretty religious God hiding himself in a barn God priding himself in a little child see let's just go to display after a while though he had where he went on the streets the parents no doubt would talk and say don't play with that kid don't have nothing to do with him his mother is nothing but a common prostitute see the father and mother the baby was born before they were actually married she was to be mother have nothing to do with it what Mary thought but all together no matter what the outside thought she pondered all these things they hid it in their heart they know they couldn't say nothing about against it God speaks to his man sometimes say hold your peace don't say nothing about it I've had people in my meeting say well if you'd be a servant of Christ you know this is going on there sure I knew it was going on but what are you going to do when he says hold your peace don't say nothing about it talks Amanda and show them on a book something spoke years ago I said said well I couldn't understand I said you see there here it was back here got it dated and everything what happened back there but many people seen it on the book there I said it'll come to pass it this will do it this way and that way I said well why didn't you say something about that it had to be that way and Joseph no different he knows who that baby belonged to Mary known who it belonged to Jesus knowed who his father was what did he say I must be about my father's business not sawing wood and uh and making a door but about his fathers said that to his mother since you understand that I it's time for me to be about my father's business now I thought this little cracked up child any illegitimate child is kind of an odd cure saying anyhow and there you are see but God hiding himself listen God hiding himself and what was thought of the world as filth corruption illegitimate look God hides himself in the corruption of a dead seed to bring forth life amen do you get it God hides himself in a simple little warsh woman an ordinary man with his dinner under his arm kissed his wife and children goodbye and go out there and maybe hide himself in that man to do something to Archbishop but know nothing about no you're in blow no horns and send it out here God just gets Glory that's all the simple hear it in her glad now God was hiding himself in the Simplicity of a baby hiding himself in the Simplicity of a a common family God and the ecclesiastics and the great man the mind the genius and all of them the herods and so forth of that day and the neroes and they all overlooked it God how to use the place not quickly John the Baptist and Isaiah 40 we could get it if you want to Malachi 3 oh well yeah you mark it down it's going to Isaiah 40 all you know um uh speaking peace to the as it is maybe it might be good I I would read it right here if you got if you got that much time yeah just for a minute we'll turn over here in the book of Isaiah the 40th chapter and and read Jerry it's just see what he says about this now look here Comfort G Comfort G my people now remember this is 712 years look at the heading on there see 712 years before he's born here's a prophet speaking of him Comfort he Comfort ye my people saith the Lord speaky comfortable words to Jerusalem and cry under her better Warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardon for she has received the Lord's hands devil for all of her sins the voice of him crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight his path in the desert a highway for a heart God in every Valley shall be exalted in every mountain and Hills shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rest shall be made plain amen what a man that was to be see now turn over to Malachi with me the last book of the last of the prophets in the Old Testament ah in America listen here Malachi picks it up just to the end time story be sure not to forget it Malachi the third chapter behold I'll send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant of Who You Delight in behold he shall come and saith the Lord of hosts still speaking of John it's been my messenger before me to prepare the way Jesus spoke up in Matthew 11 10. so if you can receive it that's who was spoken of behold I say My Messenger before my face see that's right how how let's suppose when it's been for 700 years there was to be a forerunner come before the Messiah but when he came on the scene in such simplicity they missed him they missed him remember he was a priest's son well look how ridiculous that was for him not to follow the office of his father go back to the Seminary but his job was too important and nine years old he went into the wilderness and he came out preaching they missed it he was so simple too simple for their uh High polished education to believe such a one they thought when this man come how about all the high places will be made low all the Low Places be made High all the rough places be made plain uh David saw instead of the mountains skipped like little Rams and the leaves cut their hands amen what did it happen oh no whiskered God like that with no education at all with a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him came stumbling out of the Wilderness of Judaism repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and you bunch of snakes don't you think to say I belong to a certain organization God's name of these stones to rise to our neighbors well that's not him man we know that's not him but it was him is making the path clean amen see there's one of the rough places is made plain there's where the high places is brought down don't you think you got Abraham to your father don't begin to tell me that kind stuff because God's able these Stones arise the high places are brought down that's it yes see the difference he said that's what would take place and when they come they thought oh my this gets ready to receive him if he come to their own organization but because he come like that in such a simple way yet it interprets in the scriptures the places was made low they didn't want to accept it but they was amen boy he shaved them all he shut the hide right off of him said you bunch of vipers you Snakes in the Grass I'll tell you the action laid to the root of the prince never a tree that won't bring forth the fruits just cut down and cast amen [Music] [Music] that was one of the rough places that made planes I think but the people didn't get it but it's just exactly with the word man that's exactly the way the word said it so simple that they missed it they miss him don't you be that blind [Music] thank you [Music]

heard folks whisper there's no place here for her kind still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until at last she nailed before his feet and though she spoke no words everything she said was heard as she poured her love for the master from her books of alabaster and I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's Alabaster Box don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and dry them with my hair [Music] you weren't there the night he found me you did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me and you don't know the cost of the oil in my

of scripture in Matthew chapter 16. and you get that you can say Amen and um we'll read chapter 16 over to verse 17. Matthew 16 verse 28. our lord Jesus speaking to the disciples remember Peter had got the Revelation that thou art the Christ and then they go to uh a little further in and the Lord has to rebuke him or the spirit that was in him saying that he would not need to be taken away he didn't have to die on the cross and the Lord rebuked Satan off of him and in verse number 28 our Lord is continuing he says verily I say unto you there'd be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and after six days Jesus Take It Peter James and John his brother bringing them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raim it was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou will let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias quality yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen that's what we want to do today Revelations 19 verses number seven let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready this morning we're going to take a little message this morning on the Mount Zion Showdown the Rapture Mount Zion Showdown the Rapture let's pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon your word this morning bless every heart Lord the stranger that may be in our gates Lord may you speak to them and help them and let each one receive a portion of the word for for their life we pray and ask in Jesus name amen I bless you you may be seated amen we've been talking on the Rapture the last two services and bringing it in with the um uh with this great third pool and we were showing to the church how sister Hattie Wright took that uh uh the Lord used the Widow and cause great blessings to come to her home by simply saying the right thing she was it was in humility how God used her and blessed her amen all right and he still uses that humility today God actually hides himself in humility he likes to find humble things little things that insignificant things and then he hides in there and then he comes forth and he reveals himself um through the very thing he was hiding in and this this great happening with sister Hattie Wright was um it brought about some questions to the Believers because this this was um the early 50s that brother Branham had give this story of the squirrels coming into creation and he's there now sharing this with the people in just a little humble setting after a hunting trip or after being around the Saints to pick up the communion wine for these little mountain people just humble people and then God is going to use this this little widow woman to to bring out something great for all of us she's famous today sister Hattie Wright amongst those that believe she I'm gonna shake her hand I really do she was something else and now out in the world now they wouldn't publish it the great Christian magazines and the great organizations out there they don't know who she is but we know who she is and was she trying to make herself famous or did God make her famous God made her who she was and she was just being who she was not trying to push into something not trying to make herself known not trying to get more than she deserves she was just being what God called her to be and that's what we want to be today now in in questions and answers there's a tremendous question that was asked brother Branham and it's in questions and answers 1964. I want you to get a load it's a loaded question now it's pretty strong for those of you that know the word this is paragraph 158 question 248 and questions and answers so remember that he's had a few years now of bringing this testimony of sister Hattie and her two boys that received salvation and then um these boys were there evident taking of being baptized in water they were actively in the church washing the Saints feet I think there's one quote where brother random says one of the boys had his hands laid on brother Neville's head praying for him so you went from a teenager that didn't know the Lord and now you're worshiping with the Saints this was his mother that brought him into this to the presence of the The Fellowship Of God but look at this question here it's in questions and answers 1964. I gave you the first message to go tell but I want to take this one first says if we can get that up thank you now listen to this question this third pool and is speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection The Son of Man this is so or is it not and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not Escape all these things and stand before the son of man so the scripture there is in Luke Chapter 21. so let's take our Bibles and read that script that scripture just for a moment Luke 21 pretty heavy question though questions come from somewhere they come from somewhere and we thank God when you have a scripture or Godly question God has an answer for you if you need it if you don't need it he won't give it to you you think you need answers to everything but he doesn't give you answers to everything he tells you what you need to know I mean you know that's true amen amen can we be patient enough to say Lord just reveal to me what I need to know amen take each of yourselves verse 34 unless at any time your hearts be overcharged with Serpentine that's overeating and drunkenness and the cares of this life and so that that day come upon you unaware for as a snare or a trap okay shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray what they say always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man so this person takes this scripture Luke 21 and ask this question to brother Branham that the third pulse speaking the word so what happened with sister Hattie's two boys sister Hattie Wright was a Believer her two boys were the teenagers that weren't Believers at the time and they were having a conversation around this great miracle that took place in brother random's life she simply said that's nothing but the truth brother Branham and and God came down and overshadowed the room touch brother Branham The Voice told him to give her what she wants whatever it is I give it to you to give to her and and it will happen right now it was a super anointing brother banham says so this widow woman she didn't even know what to ask for and she brother Banner what should I ask for what's your greatest desire what is your greatest desire well her greatest desire was to see the salvation of her two boys something Eternal something great and when she gave that request brother random says this now this is very strong he says I give you your two boys in the name of Jesus Christ I give them to you and they fell over right there received the Lord Jesus and the Holy Ghost changed their lives amen now this happening at spread throughout the message Community or those that believe brother random says that it happened with brother Ed Dalton was the second time it happened to a man it was brother Ed Dalton that the lord gave him his entire house and so now here is someone told me who this was that asked this question a great Minister but I can't repeat it because I don't know if it's true or not but it sounds true sounds like a minister would ask a question like this that this third pool speaking the word it seems entirely possible that you could speak the word and one would be completely restored fully restored and ready for the Rapture isn't that what we all desire isn't that the goal to make the Rapture how many here want to go into the tribulation how many here want to go on the rapture so our goal here if I was going to go into tribulation I could stay it in the denomination I could have stayed in a Baptist Church somewhere but I'm in the message so I can make the Rapture because this this message is a Rapture message we're not talking about salvation there's salvation on all kind of covenants out there there's all kind of people under this Covenant under that denomination that organization and they've accepted the Lord Jesus and they have salvation we appreciate that we don't look down on that when we make it to the other side and you have eternal life and someone else is in the bride nobody's going to be over there upset like I wasn't in the bride and you got an attitude because you didn't go in the Rapture I was only saved what you mean only say it's called eternal life won't you just be glad to be there absolutely it's eternal life and so we don't want to we don't want to minimize eternal life you meet a man on the job or a man out there on the streets and they tell you that Jesus saved him you should Rejoice with them you should be glad with them you should shake their hand and say God bless you thank God you're reading the Bible thank God you're on your way to heaven I mean there's something to frown upon that's something to Rejoice about because you can't be something that God didn't make you amen and so this third pool now um it seems entirely possible brother random that one could stand before you this great gift of the son of man could stand before you and you can speak the word to them and they would be ready for the Rapture now look at how brother Branham answers this question or should I close all right look at how the prophet answers his question see y'all can told me to keep going so program 148 he says this 158 says now dear friend see I think here that you you gotta you got a good statement yes sir yes sir now that would be so you said brother banham in other words here's what I don't think I believe it not polishing up what you said but I believe I can make it a little clearer to the people you are believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here witnessed the squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things in like that do these things that I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down into Egypt but was God that sent him down to Egypt now I believe that the Holy Spirit would come to me and say in a vision go tell certain certain person that they are trying to overcome a certain thing and they cannot do it and they're smoking they're drinking they're lying stealing or committing adultery whatever it might be or they got a lustful spirit and you just go where they are and say thou Spirit come out of there I set this captives free would it take place absolutely yes indeed that absolutely would it would take place but now upon my own presuming now presume means to Adventure without Authority see I go down to help this person I'm just presuming that it'll be all right then I don't know I can call the name of the Lord over them I can pray for them do whatever I wish to but I have my own way this morning brother better continues on paragraph 161 what would I do if it was in my power it is in I have the authority to do it but I have to wait for orders to do it see I have the authority from God to do it but now when he gives the orders she'd go back home well see I know that it's truth I just be willing to die this morning on that as I'd be in anything see that's the truth but first you see no one else Jesus himself said the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father do that doeth the son likewise we know that that's I really like that having the power to do it or having the authority to do it but waiting for the orders and there's things that God gives us the authority over over all unclean spirits and authority over circumstances in our home and even in our job and he gives us the authority we are Miniature creators and God made us in the image of himself we are Sons and Daughters of God and he's given us the power he's given us the authority but sometimes we have to wait in order for that to take place now our attitude is uh very very instrumental towards any of these promises it really comes back to our attitude you know in the Statue of the perfect man brother banham brings those Faith virtue knowledge Temperance brotherly kindness all the way up to love one of the virtues there is brotherly kindness brotherly kindness is put yourself in your brother's shoes on the matter it's empathy so like you know you put yourself in my shoes or I put myself in your shoes or the little sister or the brother that gets up here to sing for the first time and we we're looking at them with a real well put yourself in their shoes and then you would treat them better so we put ourselves in one another's shoes then we'll handle each other with better respect right put yourself if you're up talking and you're speaking and then you know or you're up singing and then you look out and people look like they upset at you yeah and then put yourself in those shoes and you wouldn't want that with you so why do we do it or why do some people do it huh you put yourself in your in your brother's shoes in the matter and this is what this is what brotherly Khan is these are what the virtues do and so this this Authority and being able to do something and then waiting for the opportunity to do it to be for God to call on you to do it you know there's an attitude there something to do with your attitude I want to read a quote for you here and brother random goes a little bit deeper about sister Hattie here just for a moment and then we'll get into this the Rapture because this person is very fully aware that uh you have to be ready for the Rapture you have to be dressed in the garments for the Rapture and we know that the Rapture is at hand we read the scripture that the bride has made herself ready is that right but here is a question that they're asking brother banham you could speak the word and someone would be entirely restored ready for the Rapture all right now in the message go tell he says talking about sister Hattie and those two boys they're the two little boys are probably sitting here in a meeting somewhere this morning are they Hattie are they here with you sister Hattie says they're in the back there and back in the back where are you boys raise up your hands where's the two boys there they are standing back in the back God bless you now what happened the same thing no matter what she'd have happened what she should have asked she could have had it she could have she could have it now I'm wanting to see that happen it's going to be the attitude of the people towards the message see how she said it she said just the right thing is what you say that does it what you say look at the sheer Felician woman when she come to Jesus Lord my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil thou son of David come heal her he said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to you dogs what if we would have what if he would have said that to some of us we say call me a dog wasn't nothing to him anyhow the big church is right he ain't nothing but a Holy Roller another Mother we'd have we'd have that attitude but not her she said it's true Lord you're exactly right but the dogs are willing to eat the scraps under the children's table that got him he said for this saying the devil has left your daughter for this saying it's your attitude friends did not he say you've got to believe it friends you don't believe me I'm a man but you believe what I'm telling you believe the message if you don't believe the messenger believe the message if a man walked in the room there with a telegram no matter who what the man looked like or what he was big or little you believe what's on the telegram not the man God sent me to tell you I have a message now how many of you could take someone calling you a dog well scripturally we can take it because it happened to that woman we know that she had great faith but could you take someone in this church calling you a dog and not carpet attitude with it huh it's your attitude and you know this these are these are the deeper things that you know we can know the seals and we can know the first second in Messengers and the last day that we're in but you know and still our attitude not be the right attitude he uses this widow woman on purpose he uses her situation in life on purpose because she had an attitude that she uh as a Believer she was connected with the ministry of Elijah and she believed him and that's that's our attitude today that should be our attitude this morning to believe the word that come to us this this day amen now this this getting yourself ready Revelations 19 7 we read there that the bride has made herself ready the question was with the spoken word could the spoken word speak to us and we be made ready I've seen two pitfalls or a couple pitfalls surrounding that quotation that I read for you that questionnaire you know there's some highlights in there in that question where brother Brandon answers and says yes that is so it's entirely possible brother random didn't openly dispute the Luke 21 reference either standing before the son of man and ministers today will openly refute that or stand against that and then the ability for one man a prophet to have a word of the Lord to actually change a sinner to a saint by speaking the word over them and it's pretty strong it's pretty powerful but I've seen that Pitfall I've seen it go to where you have some folks that will follow this this message this word you know see the quotes they'll see the scriptures and they won't do anything because they're waiting for a one-time spoken word event to change this now is it possible yes it's possible absolutely possible but can you step over God's word and him not be offended by it he puts it in your power to make it happen in your life and you cannot you cannot discount his word you can't say it doesn't work you can't say he didn't mean it and because we're looking for a one-time event a get quick rich a one-time event to change us when it's actually he's birthing things in us as we walk daily we're adding more like a child growing like eating right like exercising you can't run a marathon after one day of exercise but if you keep exercising then we can talk to you about running a marathon if somebody wanted to take a diet pill they want to read a one-time video and it's the way it just falls off drink this drink it melt the fat away this just sheds the fat away and we run after those little quick get rich quick their schemes their scams but if you got hit with cancer or real terminal disease you're probably losing weight real quick too but is that what you want thank you okay look at what the prophet of God says here in the message God keeps his word paragraph number 78. but God was determined God was determined that his word would not return to him he was going to keep his word he has to keep his word he must do it in order to be God if he has to make a change of everything and by Grace he'll do it that's the reason I say if the church does not get herself ready that's your duty to get ready the bride has made herself ready the garments is paid for they're ready but you must be ready to wear those garments the church hath made herself ready now Brethren listen if the church doesn't get ready listen God is able of these stones to rise children unto Abraham if the Holiness people don't straighten themselves up and get back into the harness again get back to the gospel God will raise up he can bring Catholics Presbyterians whatever he wishes to he will do it few weeks ago Lima Ohio many of you some here sitting here know that was present among the Presbyterian Baptist and methodists they streamed to the altar they received and responded to the gospel much better much better than many times the Holiness people does we just got it in our mind that we are called by His holy name and Let It Go like that it means more than to be called by his name it means to live for him who died for you it's a life a consecrated life to God oh how we need back to the Bible amen and the message the marriage of the Lamb paragraph 53 we know that there's going to be a bride there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkles they have the material and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice it said she hath made herself ready so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you got to do something they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcoming you had nothing to overcome you just pushed you through he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain his promise for 25 years the ups and the Downs that he had and the Temptation in those 25 years but he held to the Word of Promise Israel was promised a Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of it wherever The Souls of your feet Treads upon that have I given you God said to Joshua it was all there the land was there and God gave it to them but they must fight for it the same way it is about Divine Healing God has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it but you'll fight every inch of the way how many know it's a fight how many know it's a fight you know some people come into church and they look at Christians and they think well it's easy for you because you come from a two-parent home or it's easy for you because you was raised in church or just easy for you because you were never on welfare or it's easy for you because you live in this neighborhood or that or it's easy for no no no no no no everybody in here any believer any Christian I ever met that really has an experience they got a fight on their hand we look good but we fighting many times battles scars demons and Devils just to make it to church sometime just to make it to church it's a battle sometimes and we get in here we start to praise the Lord it looks easy but it's not easy it's a battle amen Brethren listen he says uh paragraph 60 God has got Amazing Grace to save you he'll do it but you'll fight every inch of the Wayne I've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has but we must fight if we must Reign so we find out that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us we must lay them aside ourselves we can't say God you come lay them aside for us we got to do that ourselves no do you have anything that you need to lay aside today huh you got to do that Lord take this from me the Lord said won't you give it to me Lord take this over force me Lord break me down and make me do it yeah he'll make you willing to accept him and you know you you got to be willing to lay it down it's true you can't do it in your own power but he told you to come unto you unto me all you that labor and heavy lady and I'll give you rest take my yoke and learn of me but my yoke is easy and my burdens are light give it to me and I'll take care of it but he's not going to take it from you and you don't want him to take it from you you have to desire him to take it from you and God has made it possible for you to get ready for the Rapture how many believe that the materials for the Rapture are here on the Earth what are those materials to get ready well I just read the quote for you that the materials are on the earth for her to get ready what are those materials it's God's word it's a simple service a simple prayer meeting it's one or two scriptures every day it's praying to him it's asking him to change you uh every day of your life step by step this is what these what these materials are it's the word of the Lord is what we dress ourselves with to make ourselves ready we don't dress ourselves with our own righteousness we don't dress ourselves with our own goodness we don't dress ourselves with our own ideas we take the word and then we dress ourselves with the word meaning where the word tells us to do things or not to do things we simply obey obey those things and that's how you dress yourself with the word now this these tools have been given to us now this this great truth of getting yourself ready making yourself ready for the rapture brother Banner preaches the message spoken word is the Original Seed and in that message I didn't give this to you sis but if you can find it for me he's talking about where the spirit told him to pick up his pen and write and he starts to bring in uh it's him riding by the spirit as he's writing this I forget it's like 20 minutes or so if you were listening to it red it's also repeated again in the uh pergamist Church age pergamian Church age and the church age book a couple words are a little bit different or a little bit uh edited just a little bit but it's still where the spirit told him to pick up the pen and write and one of the things that he he brings out there is this here I'll get this for you here all right he brings in this these three great showdowns mount uh um Transfiguration was one of them Mount Carmel was the other one and then Mount Zion and he says this in paragraph 432 and spoken words of the Original Seed it might be a different number but if I just give you the first part of it it says so it's at this time in this country so it's at this time in this country so what is these what he's doing now he's he he's taking a scriptural reference in First Kings um chapter 17. and he's dealing with the Elijah on Mount Carmel so these three mountains we'll talk about just briefly for a moment and it will just finish up on this Mount Transfiguration and then Mount Zion so these three mountains in in the spirit he was studying the word for the sermon this sermon spoken word is the Original Seed is the five-hour sermon he got so caught up in the spirit he says that the word that the spirit told him to pick up his pen and he began to write he began to write as he's writing one of the references he gives was to go hear Jezebel religion and so you have a chance to get that it'd be nice for you to hear this portion of pick up your pen he goes through the beginning and and how the the seeds had to be planted it goes into the Garden of Eden then he's bringing it up to a type for our day now this is what the spirit had had told him to write and he says so it's at this time in this country that that person will appear for it's in the scripture and it's thus saith the Lord then in the latter rain there will come forth a Mount Carmel a showdown Bible fulfilled to the letter John the Baptist his messenger before his face in Malachi 3. planted a former rain and was rejected by the churches the denominations the Pharisees and Sadducees in this day Jesus came and had the mount Transfiguration Showdown so we'll wait for the sis to get it Mount Transfiguration Showdown it should come up in the spoken words of the Original Seed I want you to hear this or get this Mount Transfiguration Showdown this Forerunner of the last days will sow for the former reign Jesus will be the showdown between denomination and Creeds which is his word when he comes a showdown the Rapture of his bride the first was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration the third will be Mount Zion Glory so brother banham is now bringing in these three mountains of in the scriptures the Mount Carmel Showdown the mount Transfiguration Showdown and the Mount Zion Showdown now this Mount Zion Showdown is preparing us for the Rapture it's the it's the final showdown so I want you to look at the Rapture as a showdown it's a it's a it's an event to come it's a happening it's event that we're looking forward to now in this pick up your PIN brother random says this here he says here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its kind according to Genesis 1 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass in the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree uni fruit after its kind in itself upon the Earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into Fruit the very same law applies to the church today so the very same laws of Genesis 1 11 that every seed must bring forth of his kind applies to the church today now we're in a time we're in an age that we're looking for a rapture the Rapture of the church and the prophet of God is caught up in the spirit and he's told to pick up his pen he brings the law of reproduction he talks about Adam is the first man that his bride fell Jesus was the second Adam his bride fell but then the third bride in the last days he calls her beloved bride she won't fail she'll be ready for the Rapture I want you to take a scripture in Saint John chapter 5 just for a moment in verse 19. then after Jesus and said unto them verily verily I said to you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son assured him all things that himself doeth and he's he will show him Greater Works than these that ye may Marvel so brother random takes this scripture in um uh uh uh Saint John chapter 5 verse 19 and he's bringing out the harmony between the Father and Jesus and brother Branham brings that Harmony through and says that this harmony must be with the father and the son but also the bridegroom and the bride what was the harmony the harmony was that the father gave the son the instructions of what to do Jesus said I do nothing except I see my father do it so this is the harmony that you and I are looking for this is the harmony that God is looking for with us notice the harmony I'm reading out of the church age book The programian Church age under the pick up your pen portions is notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father John 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride can you say Amen so this harmony is to exist between the groom and his bride amen he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death you help her out Scott in the back please I need that up please for it is the seed if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here's the secret of this the word is in the bride so this harmony between the father and the son is the harmony that the bride needs with her bridegroom we are the bride and we're trying to get in harmony with the great headstone for the rapture this harmony is our garments that we're wearing our attitude towards the word our attitude towards you know these hard sayings our attitude you know that woman that was called a dog and look at her attitude yes Lord but even the dogs eat from the crumbs of the master's table you know it's our attitude that the Lord is trying to work on this morning sometimes we come to church with the wrong attitude we have the Bible with a bad attitude maybe even try to listen to a tape with a bad attitude but if you're listening to it and it's settling down in your heart your attitude will change right God will begin to give you the right attitude his thoughts his his his desires his motives his objectives will begin to influence you and brother Banner says notice the harmony of the father and the son it's noticing the harmony between the father and the son and that same Harmony must exist between the church and the bridegroom the bride and the bridegroom so are you in harmony with the word this morning are you in harmony with the message of the hour this great Rapture to come foreign looking for this great Rapture to take place the great Harmony is between you and the word that the Lord give you has given us brother Branham continues okay habit there there right notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death now if you can think about the fear of death and that not being a fear to you if you ever run across a person that's not afraid to die then then uh you better leave them alone uh because because they probably lost it all anyways there's nothing to gain uh there's they've already lost and so it's like it's like the the team that's going in uh and they're a tremendous underdog I mean they already know they're going to lose all of the professionals know they're going to lose if it's a fight if it's a basketball game baseball game football game and you know you got this great professional team that's going to beat on this other team and the other team they know they're underdogs so they typically they'll come in there knowing they're going to lose anyways and so they have a freedom or looseness about them they don't you know they're not they're not trying to save their name or their they've already lost there's a scripture that's always stood out to me I think it's in um uh uh Deuteronomy 26 here if I can find it here quickly Deuteronomy 26 yeah I wrote it down actually verse number five and this is speaking about Abraham doesn't mention his name but we know speaking of him in verse 5 it says of course this is Israel coming out of the land and God is speaking to them when you come into the land these things will take place it says and thou shall speak and say before the Lord thy God a Syrian ready to perish was my father and he went down into Egypt in surgery on there with a few and became there a nation Great Mighty and populist so he he was ready to perish Assyrian he was ready to perish and now he's a great nation he he's great he's Mighty and the Lord has increased his numbers you know in when when you're ready to die that's when you're really ready to live when you're really sold out everything for the cause then you're valuable now like if you're you're trying to serve the Lord but yet keep your prestige or keep your name or keep your credit on what you had before you came to the Lord and all of that well the Lord can't use that but when all of that is dead and and when when a man really sells out and when he knows let's say he's got three years to live like Jesus did you know after he come through there he knew Calvary was in his way he reached the age of 30. he got three more years to live do you think Jesus is going to get upset about a business deal that didn't go right or get all caught up in the politics of the day no his days are numbered he's got he's got three years if you if you knew you only had a week or two weeks to live how would you live your life if you knew that your future you knew that it was limited then you're probably Shed off all of the other little things that are not that important and really focus in on what really is important and when he when the Lord now is calling Israel out and bringing Joshua into the land they had this fearlessness about them and I'm thinking about when this when this word to the church came it says that nothing can harm her not even death when you don't fear death and you don't fear your own Prestige and you don't feel your name of being embarrassed you don't have a problem witnessing the people the reason why we don't witness the people because we're a little embarrassed about it or they might say no well they told Jesus no the reason why we don't go is because there's a fear that we might we might look you know we might look like a fanatic and of course we don't want to look like that you know we want to keep ourselves reserved we want to look decent we're going to look like we got our head on our shoulders we're gonna look we want to keep our our sanity we don't want to look crazy but if the reality of the day ever really struck us then we would probably hit the streets running telling people about the hour that we live in like with Noah the days of Noah and the time approaching us for the rapture and so brother Madam goes into Joshua a little bit in this in this word of picking up your pit he says let us stand like Joshua let us stand like Caleb how did Joshua stand what did Joshua do look at the message here um as I was with Moses he says this here September 1960 paragraph number 49 he says now Joshua and all of this knowing that the command was great but having the Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as we call it Reckless as long as he was pointed in the right way he might break up against the hill that would knock him backwards but he was carried the right way so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you nor forsake you he never forsaken Moses he never felt Moses he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us he will be with us and we find Joshua to take this commission knowing that the responsibility was leading them through the lands now they had uh he'd have to go over into the other land he'd have to set up their Kingdom he'd have to divide the inheritance among them he know the commission was tremendous far more than what Moses had done Joshua had more to do than Moses had to do another thing he was to lead them along the border amongst their brethren and they already tasted blood he had to conquer them he had to keep them quiet as they marched on so it is today with this new Pentecostal group that's Rising now they've tasted denominationalism it's so hard to keep them down my brother random is bringing this Joshua and then at the church can be Reckless and fearless in faith amen we can be Fearless in faith because as he stood with Moses he's going to stand with us as he was with Christ he'll stand with the church and notice the harmony between God and his son the Lord Jesus that Harmony should be between the bridegroom and the bride this is where we're walking to Saints we're walking in harmony with the word for the rapture you know in that law of reproduction brother random says the same law applies to the church he says that there that through this word coming to the church will produce a super Church a super race as we journey to the headstone we will be it is very image I want you to think of that coming into his very image you see the super church and the super race how many has heard of this artificial intelligence today AI they call it and even the great creators of it are telling them they're going too fast they're going too far it's scary it's it's crazy what they're capable of doing what the technology is doing and I was thinking that you know no one can hide no one can run they know who you are they know where you are and but there's no intelligence higher than the intelligence of God and the AI I don't care if it's a computer or whatever it is can never compete against the gifts of the Spirit or a gift of God you see the Lord is placed in the church these protections to keep us clean to keep the word presented before us because the word is with the image that we're coming into and we he's going to Rapture a church that has no spot no blemish or no wrinkle it's the word that makes us fully restored and redeemed and ready for the rapture it's the word that we're dressing ourselves with now in the exposition of the seven Church ages brother banham says this here right down to the time he's cast to the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he's talking about Revelation to the believer he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her how many thank God for that that that there is there is an invincible Army rising up that's in The Believer that's the fearlessness that's the recklessness when you're pointed in the right direction that's the no man will be able to stand before you Joshua all the days of your life could you imagine going into battle knowing that no man can stand before you all the days of your life that put courage there that pushing them forward into this great ministry and where are we headed to now we're headed to this great rapture the Rapture is the great Showdown can I get a witness hey man can I help you help me finish this sermon here this morning oh my God I need a little help okay but Jesus is my helper if you ever get any help it comes from the Lord remember that now what happened at this Mount Transfiguration so we're going to close here just in a moment Mount Transfiguration going into my 17. Jesus tells these all of his disciples now some of you are standing here that will not taste death now it doesn't interpret to them what he's going to do he doesn't show them there's just three of you it doesn't tell them it's tomorrow or next week but six days later he pulls these three aside Peter James and John and then pulling them the side he takes them up on a high mountain and this mountain is called Mount Transfiguration now Mount Transfiguration is a literal place yes also it is an experience that's about to happen and it's going to show and type you know where does it type out today for us just like Elijah in the Old Testament with the Widow just like like what Joshua with Caleb in the Old Testament it had a spiritual background brother Adam said he told us to stand like them here we are today but he's referencing us to go back like Joshua and Caleb and stand like Joshua and Caleb as you see the promised land approaching that's what he tells him this is in the word to the church he tells the people stand like Joshua and Caleb as you see the promised land approaching that's the word to you and I now he brings up Dayton and Korah and Nathan and Cora will try to get the people sidetracked to something else to believe something else and that same thing is repeating today you're supposed to repeat today but in Matthew chapter 17 Jesus transfigures himself before them here stands Moses from the Old Testament here's Elijah from the Old Testament and Peter James and John three Witnesses brother Vamp tells us this is our lord Jesus now being adopted and placed he now his name on the check is as good as the father just Moses the law and the righteousness of the prophets but here he him now Jesus is receiving his full Authority in the spoken word is the Original Seed and in the message that we were reading out of for you in the pergame church age he brings this Transfiguration Mountain into view and here's what he says in the message the Easter cereal seal uh 1965 paragraph 246. look now at Transfiguration just before we close transfigure Transfiguration we are all represented there in Transfiguration look what we are seeing today notice just what we're seeing today the quickening power of God we was all there there was the dead Saints represented in Moses there was the resurrection in Jesus Christ glorified Elijah Moses Elijah and Jesus all standing on the mountain the dead Saints the raptured Saints in Jesus glorified oh mine well you say I heard a guy say they'll say you people well if you had this kind of a power you ought to go and tell people what you can do far be it from a real Christian saying a thing like that see surely we don't claim no power but we do one thing when they look around with all the power upon them they saw Jesus only and the real True Believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see that glorify Christ makes a difference a real true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify Moses it didn't glorify Elijah didn't glorify themselves didn't glorify nothing else but they sing the glorified Christ and any True Believer that's what's in his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's trying to get to the people to see now we all need this Transfiguration experience the mount Transfiguration experience is when you can't see this that or yourself you see Jesus only now what took place in this Mount Transfiguration experience this was Moses typed the saints that would taste death Elijah typed the saints that would not taste death can I get a witness now there's some of us here that are going to taste death no doubt if time continues is that right all of our loved ones have tasted death those of us that have Believers that have gone on just look back the age of the Believers you know the brother Neville's uh brother brother brother Branham himself and all of the fine saints that we've known in this age that have tasted death they were represented under Moses this is Moses now these are the True Believers that would taste death now I don't know if I'm going to taste death do you know if you're going to taste death we don't know but there is another group there that's the the Elijah group they're represented and those that do not taste death that will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye for to be made ready for the Rapture you know Adam in the Garden of Eden he didn't he wasn't born in a body like this brother random says that when he was put into flesh Genesis 1 22 or Genesis 2 that's when this his senses came into him in the flesh man see taste feels smell in here but he wasn't born in sin right he he didn't come to the world speaking lies he was a spoken word creation and he was a real man a son of God and he had the power of Creation in his hands and God used him to name the animal kingdom from his side comes his bride Eve that God give her as a byproduct but he left All That Glory his glorified condition never lied never sinned never did anything wrong he left all of that when he saw his wife contaminated with sin did he do he he put aside his glory and he took her in and partook of the fruit and now God made a way of redemption for his bride Eve to come in tremendous love story wouldn't you say he could have started a new he could have took another rib if he needed to and make him another Eve part two or Eve 2.0 but no that's not what he did he took he fell and he goes in and he redeems Eve because it was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh amen what about Moses what about Moses remember when the people they tempted the Lord ten times they brought him through the Red Sea complained the water ain't sweet enough complain ain't got no meat complaining ain't got no guard complain complain complain complain complain until God says you know what I'm gonna cancel all these people and Moses with you I'll start a new people and I'll make them popular I'll make them great I'll make them famous and what did Moses do he threw himself in the breach he threw himself in the Gap he says no Lord but the people will say he wasn't able to bring them out you brought them out but you wasn't able to take them all the way in the Lord listened to Moses and brought Redemption to all of Israel aren't you thankful for that and what about us today think of it think of the grace that God has shown Upon Us in this last days to think we were so holy or so right or we deserve the revelation of the Rapture oh my that's just the wrong attitude it's not the right attitude at all we didn't deserve no rap the revelation of the rapture we didn't deserve to live today but his grace overshadowed us our names are written in him before the foundation of the world and he called our names forward and even in our mistakes Even in our faults Even in our failures he still claimed his blood over us and here we are today a part of his bride oh we thank God for it don't we and this Transfiguration experience expresses to the people it's it we're all represented there Moses the sleeping Saints Elijah the slang the saints that don't taste death some of us may be here today will never taste that there's a group it's possible Right it's possible that some of us or all of us could taste death within the next hour or so we don't know but the point of it is am I ready to go if I do taste the death so we're all represented in there and what's that representation is not this one not that one not the past not the future not this holy man not that one it's all about Jesus amen God's provided place of worship this is my last quote he says we claim no glory of our own paragraph 214. We claim no glory of our own like on Mount Transfiguration where every one of us is represented there there was Moses the one that died and raised again there was Elijah the quickening Saints that'll be caught up at the last day oh they sing then when they look back they sing Jesus Only We Know Lord we don't want people to see us we're not here for that purpose far be it but Lord it does delight our hearts when we see Jesus glorified Among Us when we see him glorify when we see his word which he is the word when we see we can read it here in the Bible where he promised he would do it to see him work it right in us oh God how it makes us feel humble that we know that his living presence brother banham continues on oh my thank God for this Mount Transfiguration experience how many knows it's all about Jesus it's not about our church our group our pastor you know what we believe we know more than them we're more holy than them but it is it is comforting to know that death can't even touch us death has no power over us and it's in these things that we make ourselves ready I apologize I couldn't move into that pick up your pen even more but it's a really rich good things in there how the prophet brings that up to us that our attitude today we have to see that attitude through the scripture Joshua Moses Elijah and the widow woman and that we would watch and pray and that we'd be worthy to escape these things and stand before the son of man take heed over the overeating and the drunkenness and the cares of this life the busyness of this age that will come upon you unawares as a trap a snare you know what a trap is a trap gets you in but it doesn't let you get out a trap doesn't have an exit point catches you and then you're caught into it and this age is the greatest trap that I can think of is the worldliness and the pump and the thing of the day and what everybody else is doing and then not be aware that the Rapture is at hand God bless you Lord help us Lord help us let us let us watch and pray God bless you let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for the people that have gathered here oh God we know that there's
