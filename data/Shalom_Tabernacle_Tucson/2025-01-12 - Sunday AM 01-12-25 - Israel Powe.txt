good morning everyone can we all stand we're going to be continuing with the Ephesian Church age this morning we'll be starting at paragraph 110 and ending through number 148 be about 20 minutes long let's all bow our heads and we'll open up in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're grateful this morning to be here father and to hear the things that we will hear today Lord for truly you do nourish us with the word of God lord we hear things others are don't have the privilege to hear father it's truly a place where your sheep are being fed Lord we just want to bless your name today Lord as we

and the glory for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen only believe [Music] only [Music] be only be all things are possible only believe only be oh da things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brena we see today that our Protestants when we get down in here just went right minut just like Billy Grim said Sunday the people's been in wrong so much so they think they're all right while they're wrong that's right it's the truth I'm glad that on course the no Billy Graham received the Holy Ghost under George jeffes over there but some of these days he'll come out of that God's using him right there now because he can shake that Kingdom and nobody else car could get into but you can see he's preaching that the something behind that because some these your shaking hand Baptist yes sir am now I Know Thy works not patience how that thou cannot uh let's see now I got the I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience how th cannot bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say that they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars you found them to be Liars how' they know that they wasn't coping with the word now if a man says if this Bible says in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and pray man said oh the days of Miracles just passed then that man's a liar if the Bible said repent and be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and every place in the Bible says the same thing and everybody was ever baptized in a in a Bible time was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he commissions them to be baptized sprinkled or something else like that that man is a liar found out a false prophet I hope I ain't hurting feelings but brother you you can't baby this is take the gloves off and now show me something different show me where one person ever baptized any other way than in the name of Jesus outside of the Catholic church so if you're baptized that way you're not in the Christian church you're in the Catholic Church they baptized their own Sunday visitor their catechism said the question will any Protestants be saved said many of them because they have our baptism and many things like that so they claim about the Bible and the Bible say baptize the name of Jesus Christ and we take it from there and put it father son Holy Ghost and they knock down to it right serving not a not it's not a it's not a Christian baptism it's a Catholic baptism you hear me other night have you ever been baptized in Christian baptism Christian baptism Christ Jesus Christ not some title now the third verse now all right second and third verse now the third verse and is born and had patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted for my name did you know what they had patience labored for what his name see that name holding in that church I watch it when we get down through the week how that Fades out and goes into another name see has had patience labored and so forth and for my name's sake he they labored for his name to keep the name of Jesus Christ above any church above anything else let it be first and whatever the Bible said whatever you do in word are indeed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ is that right whatever you do in word are in deed if you marry marry a person if you can't if they're all scrupled up in their marriage don't marry them at all amen if you can't freely say I pronounce you husband and wife in the in the name of Jesus Christ let them go all right you want to baptize them baptize them in Jesus name amen if you have to do something that you can't do in jesus' name let it alone somebody said take a little drink you can't do that in jesus' name so let it alone somebody said play a little card you can't do that in jesus' name so let it alone amen a little dirty smutty joke at your Bridge party you can't tell that in jesus' name so let it alone see you can't wear shorts in Jesus name so let it alone [Applause] I could go on but we you know what I'm talking about all right he can't do that what you can't do in his name leave it alone because he said whatever you do in word and deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ all right now now we're going to that's the he commanded them for that now I'm going to talk about the complaint now in the fourth chapter a fourth verse rather nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left God first [Applause] love oh I have something against you you've been patient you've held up for my name wouldn't that be just a good thing of this Tabernacle today yes you've been all right you've had a lot of patience and for a long time but the thing of it is you've held up for my name I appreciate all right I I command you for that it's all right now see that you tried them who say they're Apostles and so go forth and sound their Liars they don't cope with the word I I appreciate all that but there's something I got against you and that is that you've left your first love you left that love that you once had for them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost need and you'll begin to kind of slide backwards into that farm will come in with a father and nonsense see all this your society and someone has to come out with the Big R you know to sang in the choir you know and the manicured all over their hair and everything and lot of makeup around their face they sing like I don't know why you're not long ago if it had been old Roberts meeting I sure would have called a bunch out at the businessman's convention and his help we didn't have that night go to speak they couldn't hold it over there in the hotel they Tau me to Old Roberts Building and when I was sitting an oral study there was a bunch of Pentecostal children all young men women 16 17 years old 18 all stand out there about 30 or 40 of them go to sing some kind of a look s me like some kind of an overture by some like Becky talks about Kashi or some of them kind of things like that I don't know some of them kind of songs classical songs and here it was the Brethren was going to take up an offering out in the meeting and each one of these went along had them a little cup act like they were blind and all the jokes and caring on your here between them boys and girls and talking like everything in them girls with enough paint on could have painted or's building almost and there it was like that and calling themselves Pentecostal Jesus they lost their first love amen I sure go with DAV duplic God has no grandchildren no sir we got Methodist grandchildren we got Baptist grandchildren we got Pentecostal grandchildren but God don't Hallelujah your sons and daughters Hallelujah you can't come in on your mommy or your daddy because they were good man and women you've got to pay the same price they did you got to be born just like they was God don't have no grandchildren at all you're a son or daughter or you're not a grandson that's one thing sure have your way Jesus went to a meeting there and they to a fine Pentecostal Assembly Church boy you see them women scatter when they see me coming in that short bobbed hair and that little old half dressed like a wiener all motional skin down those dresses like that Pentecostal women dressed so sexy you're going to have to answer for it to day of judgment you're going to be guilty of committing adultery Jesus said whosoever look up on a woman a lust after has committed adultery with her already in his heart and if you present yourself to a man like that who's guilty you're the man be right sh the very appearance of evil there you are what you lost their first love oh you couldn't get them on a corner with a tambourine to Pat their hands and praise God oh no they' sing some kind of a classical something with a bunch of robes around them see they lost their first love that's why at the first church see they just have to act like the world they have to dress like the world look like the world act like the world and have their favorite television star you know they just can't keep from s it we love Susi or something you know they just have to see it they'll stay home from prayer meeting and everything else to sit if they don't they give their Pastor a good ball and Outlet them out in time till that program comes on say get home to sit the love of the world more than the love of B oh too far you can't say Amen no more my goodness it break some of the makeup see they don't have it no that's Pentecost that ain't badst they never had it to begin with talk about Pentecost yes I know it's awful sickening brother but we want to have birth out of this thing got to bring death before you have birth it's the truth but there you are left your first love I if God had that against this church he's got it against that one too because you left your first love I've got it against you I have something against you that's my complaint you once had a great time but you begin let the word world begin to creep in and you got to act a little FAL you still holding my name and you're still doing things that's right you got a lot of patience and so forth and you labor you're like a mule just labor and work uh my my my see you've left Grace and Faith and power to swap it for labor and works well I tell you brother brand I I help every with a woman I well that's a good thing I command you for that but where's that first love you once had where's that Joy he used to have has David once cried oh Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation where is them all night prayer meetings and tears on your cheeks my goodness the Bible's even dusting got Cog webs on it you read over love stories and news things and things that ought you be allowed to be published and put out for a trash can and we Pentecostal people pick them up and just Lo over them like a bunch of flies on a garbage can that's right Mercy what we need is back to our first love back to Pentecost Hall I better get away from there all right but you understand leaving that first love the fourth verse fifth verse now a warning the fifth verse a warning remember and repent see remember therefore from when thou art Fallen where did you come from from Pentecost you fell down to where you are now backsliding and repent and do thy first Works go back to Pentecost again or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove the Candlestick out of H see who it is don't you he is place except thou repent other words if you got a god-filled pasture filled with the Holy Ghost and you try to hold him under your fingers but if he says anything about us having a Rob car if he says anything about us wearing makeup we is excommunicating don't you worry God will do it before you get a chance to he'll go out and preach the stones on the street before you compromise with that kind of stuff you got a pastor that really tells you the truth you ought to honor God worship God realize that you're going to be lost if you don't see but people live today like this go this is the only thing there was live you're on Earth that's all you don't realize you got a sword it's go to leave here and go somewhere and you seal your destination right here the way you live and the way you do out holding grudges and mean and everything then run to church oh mercy shame on you you bring a reproach up upon the cause of Christ isn't that right don't we do it the Bootleggers ain't hurting the church it isn't that it is the prostitutes hurting the church it's the people who profess to be Christians that's hurting the church we know what the bootlegger is or what the prostitute is when our sister's dress like a prostitute that's different that's what hurts the church amen when the man drinks like The Bootlegger well then that's what hurts the church it profess to be a Christian and it do that the people look for you name let him that even names the name of Jesus Christ depart amen get away from it oh we're so short Brethren me you all of us we're we're short of what Christ wants us to beight here in this day it's time to lay aside every sin that's easy beset us and run with patience the race is set before us preachers that's right brother exactly right remember and repent or I will remove the light of the star out of his place what's his place in the church but if you don't repent and go back to where he was in the first place I'll take your pastor out away from you move him out of this place uh but somewhere else where he where I reflect my light that'll Shine That's Sol it's time for the churches to repent it's time for Pentecost to get a lot of these little polished Scholars out of the pulpits and get the oldfashioned preacher in there they tell you the truth not Pat around and use a church for a meal ticket big wages and something like that and psychology and a few horse races and uh soup suppers and everything else is it's time to get back to the gospel care how little you are we're two or three are gaed I'll be in their midst repent left I come and remove the Candlestick send him away else is shine his light now the sixth verse now here's the one we're going to have trouble [Applause] with oh except you repent you come and move the pasture away but this thou has now remember oh don't miss this now this is going to lock the rest of it together come on down to this rage we're in now everybody feeling good first are you in a hurry no all right all right bear just a little bit then right amen now thank youen but this thou has they had something in didn't now what did they have that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicadan which I also hate you hate those deeds of the nicolan sitting in the study today up there I wrote something here on that I want you to listen closely now in a couple Pages here the sixth verse praises and agreed that God and the church agreed upon one thing that they hated the Deeds of the nickan the True Vine the True Vine the true church that was in this Ephesian church I remember each church has its formals and each church has its spirituals that's the twins it's borned in every Revival and lives in every church this started right in this age and ends up in this age and finally the fals took it over in the SAA age and Luther pulled it back out again and swinging right back in again can you see that formal religion there's no difference between that Catholicism it's all the same thing ever organizations butchered right into it God never did organize these church that's exactly what they're trying to do here and you watch the see now that isn't right just show you how cursed an organization is it was it was foreign to the new church the New Testament Church see but but thou but this thou H thou hatest the Deeds of the nians which I also hate the True Vine hated the formal Deeds of the nickan so did God what was deeds in the Ephesian Church in the Church of Ephesians became a Doctrine in the pgus church in Ephesus the first church it was a de in the next Church it become a Doctrine can you hear it do you understand it now it was a deed in Ephesus and watch over here in perus it became a Doctrine it just started here in a little baby form on a minute we're going to find out what that was here is Paul's woles these are the nickan now what let's break that word down find out what we got before we go any further the word nicadan is kind of a foreign thing to me I got every Greek election that I could find nickol Adan come from the word of Nick n i c k o wait I believe I wrote it down here n i c KO Nicko which means to conquer or to overthrow nickel leans overthrow or conquer the Ley what they were trying to do here was trying to take the church God had pastors and the spirit of God moving by gifts in the Church of the Living God and they were having a Doctrine start that they were going to have some priests and Bishops and popes and so forth that God said he hated Hallelujah he hates it yet today amen amen Nick oans Nick o over over come or overthrow the Ley the Ley is the church how many knows that Ley is the church all right overthrow or conquer or take place of Ley in other words take all of the sacredness all of the power from the church and put it over on the uh priest let the congregation live the way it wants to but the priest is the Holy One taking a holy ghost away from the people with signs and wonders fallen in and take that away and give them a holy priesthood taking away the Holy Ghost and swapped it for a priesthood you see what it was it was a it finally became in this church here it was a deed and this place it become a Doctrine and thar took over and when Luther came out couldn't stay that way it went right back to took over again Bishops paral archbishops who in the world ahead of God's church but him himself amen now I feel religious the Holy Ghost was sent to rule the church Hallelujah not just the preacher the whole congregation amen yes the preacher be holy it's all the church have the Holy Ghost oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] h [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] he [Music] h oh [Music] oh [Music]

appreciate them and our scripture this morning we will take again we'll go into the Book of Joshua in chapter 1 I'm sorry that's Joshua chapter 14 is what we want Joshua chapter 14 get my fingertips warm here a little cool for us but you know we can't really complain about the cold weather some places are burning up with fire other places are freezing cold and we have the nerve to complain about it's too cold but how many knows it's not really that cold right we thank the Lord for our beautiful weather here amen Joshua chapter 14 is where we want to take our scripture reading this morning yes this is it then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and gilgal KB the son of jeffa the kenite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh Baria 40 years old was I when I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Baria to Espy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt mhm but I wholly follow the Lord my God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land wherein thy feet have trotten shall be thy inheritance and thy children's forever because thou H has wholly followed the Lord my God and now be behold the Lord have kept me alive isn't that nice amen the Lord kept me alive as he said these 40 and5 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and5 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for War both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where of the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakins were there and the cities were great and Fen if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out say it with me as the Lord so who is Caleb quoting here he's quoting the Lord am the Lord said these things about me and he's coming to Joshua for his inheritance amen amen we will take a a title this morning stand like Joshua stand like Caleb with Joshua stand like Caleb with Joshua let us pray again Lord Jesus bless your word bless the reading of the word this time of the service Lord bless us Lord a clear thought and place it into the hearts of your people the good things that they need that they can get favor from you which is Faith Lord Faith cometh by hearing and as we believe you Lord then you have favor upon that and Lord we want to be favorable in your sight amen we might not be the most gifted or talented but but Lord we want your favor amen that above everything and we know when we have faith it pleases you amen so help us not to be critic or upset but help us to have faith that we can be pleasing to you in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated stand like Caleb with Joshua amen of course we're bringing this title out of the portion of the message pick up your pen brother brandham had brought to us the message of spoken word is the Original Seed 5H hour sermon that he's bringing and then as he is closing up you know the Lord is closing up his ministry here on the earth um in December of of 65 he's called off of the scene really that's when the accident happened and so forth but those latter years he was able to finish his book The Seven Church age book The you know the church a book the um the exposition of the church A's book and I talked to a minister who was around been around for many many years and one of the early ministerial meetings that was had um was around this subject on Whose book is it the church H book whose book is it and some had said that it was Lee B's book and some had said this and that and I heard that as a young Minister coming in and it always kind of I've kind of put the church age book as a second class book or secondary book until I began to read what brother brandom said about his book and he was alive when it was issued out even I believe there's a a a a one of the precious Saints here has a a copy that brother Ram autographed so if he was against the book I don't think he' put his name on it that's right uh no and so now I had the Lord had to help me to go pick that book back up and uh embrace it as part of the message and so in the church age book brother randam takes that same pick up your PIN portion uh that was given to him and he includes that in this exposition of the seven Church Ages which was not given when he actually preached the series and there's a number of things like that that he brings in the church AG book that is not in the series so um so I embrace it I thank the Lord for it and this is where I'm getting that from and I'll read a quote here on this pick up your pen the prophet of God says this here I trust it'll be a blessing to you today now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua so there's two things we want to look at here there is standing like someone and then standing with something or someone standing like an individual and then standing with an individual and that's the commission for the Caleb group stand like Caleb stand with Joshua now this Joshua is as brother Brandon brings the type of it and I'll read it for you it isn't just the type of the um of the last day leader he typed ypes it in other ways too he types it as the Holy Spirit as our Joshua he also types it as the true Ministry or true true Minister but we know that this uh uh this uh portion of the word that he says to stand like Caleb stand with Joshua he's referring to this last day messenger the last day leader and let me let me um just share with you you this this timing element that has to be involved so as a Believer when we read this as a Believer when I read this and we hear this uh proclamation in the pick up your pen then you know it should interest us to find out who this character Caleb is and go through the word of the Lord and read his life again and see who he is and see what he had to stand against you know I I I make the statement all the time we should internalizes of quoting what I'm meaning is let's let's uh take on the person of Caleb or you know role play as if you were Caleb and would you take the same stand he would have wasn't wasn't very easy to do he was a very rare individual when you look at the grand scheme of all the people that came out out of the millions you only got two people that's ready to cross over are you serious are you kidding me are these people that never saw a miracle are these people never seen the pillar of fire are these people don't have a witness and you and you are coming up to the very border of gaining it all and and you can't get your act together you still got a problem huh yes that's in your Bible That's people greater than you and I these were 12 men chosen out of each tribe these are aren't halfway Believers these aren't second class you know people that only come on Sundays we all going to let me preach this morning these are people that take the communion right wash the Saints feet that come to the service these are men amongst men that were chosen to go spy out the land and in spying out the land we don't see that there's two groups of people in this one group that's going over we don't see that we don't see that coming back you know we all sat and listened to the same tape together we all say saw the same fruits in the land we all saw the same thing you was right with me when I saw the fruit of the land so how is it we come back with a different report something is wrong my mind can't process that we we heard the same quotes we were in the same service and then we come back with a different report put that together for me how did that happen and this had to be working in Caleb's mind to think of this but now the prophet of God by the Holy Spirit warns us of this day that should happen of this time element that would causes separation now as we speak of this the timing uh elements and so forth brother brandom says this is this the sign of the ins sir 1962 this is what he says in paragraph number 66 it says this here we all know that we are living in a glorious time for the church but a horrible time for the unbeliever and we're living in one of the most dangerous times of all yes sir all that ever was since the world began no Prophet no Apostle never in no time ever lived in such a time as we live now this is the end does that help you to see what's going on none of the prophets lived in a time like this before all right look at what he says in Satan's Eden similar about this he says this here I tell you what this is ain't the time to to start playing games with this message and playing games and getting offended about people this you better we better get our act together on who we are we better take it seriously I don't have time to lose out because somebody don't like me please I have enough time to believe God's word though and I want to be faithful to do that all the way to the end brother random says this in Satan's eating paragraph 64 said there is the God of this world that I preached to you about last Sunday here he is today in deceit that treacherous hour that tremendous time that we're living it's the most glorious time of all the ages because we are facing the Great Millennium again we're facing the Eden again but right at this age all the deceit and every tactic that he's ever used and been able to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforce himself and come down like God and has put himself in place of God religious and can quote the scriptures and can tell you the scriptures just as Satan did to Eve in the Garden of Eden but leave one spot of it is all he has to do is make that Gap where the poison doctrine of the devil can pour through like the thinking man's filter we was talking about the other night now he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend the clouds and stars and he would sit there like God and be above the most high he has succeeded and carrying out his threats so Satan made this threat and he has succeeded in it it's in Thessalonians he made the threat I will I will do all of those things he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promise word to that age that's exactly how he's done it in every age he explains it away in the days of Noah he explained that it was impossible for it to rain from Heaven There is no rain up there his great scientific gospel he preached in the Garden of Eden he could shoot the instruments to the moon and prove there's no moisture up there but God said there would come a rain but Satan succeeded and poisoned the mind of the People by scientific research or Internet research or going online research or proving it themselves or trying to find a fault or a flaw in their research that it could not be done but it was done God said it would be done and it was done he did now in the days of Jesus he did the same thing he poisoned their minds again amen by deceit misinterpreting the word so and brother randam continues on so we see there's a PO poisoning in the mind the way people think he has succeeded in poisoning that now if we go back to the pickup your pen brother brandham makes this a statement here talking about um well he goes on I I won't get it all but he did he did talk about there would be a great a number of people that would begin to fall away there' be a great number I want you to go get that pick up your pen that the Holy Spirit told Brother bandam there'd be a number of people that would walk away but he says he continues on and in that same Little Portion if you're listening to it on the tape is about 22 minutes or 24 minutes of pick up your pen in the um uh spoken words The Original Seed and if you take the church age book he reads pretty much he there's a few things that are cleaned up but it's the same message of pick up your pen and it's to the people and this is one other thing that he says here and he says I believe according to Revelations 13:16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the Beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach be granted denominations will take the Mark or be forced to quit preaching she so what spirit is trying to stop anybody from preaching call it what you want to the spirit wants to stop the preaching of the word and the bride will be forced I believe according to Revelations 13:16 that the bride would have to stop preaching for the Beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach be granted denominations will take the Mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great Harlot amen so we see it's a treacherous time it's a tremendous hour the minds of people are being poisoned and we have been given a command to stand like Joshua and Caleb stand like Caleb stand with Joshua so who is Joshua Joshua in in type as I read did I read it for you let me read it for you he's a type of the last day uh uh Ministry he also a type of the holy spirit this is in the adoption number four so we can bring the full type of who Joshua is paragraph 114 brother brandham says Moses being a type of Christ led the children of Israel up to the promised land then Moses did not take the children in the promised land Joshua took the people in and divided the land Jesus Paid the price LED them up to the Holy Spirit God sent the Holy Spirit down and he positionally put the church in order each man filling him with the presence of his being you see what I mean all in Christ Jesus how God predestinated this to the calling of this gospel amen he says it again in the message blind bartmus the prophet of God speaking he says paragraph 163 and he sat there he began to think yes and I remember the great warrior Joshua how my mother used to say honey just across there just as just at the Ford right down there below the city Joshua the Great Mighty Warrior took Moses's place a type of the Holy Spirit now taking see Moses didn't bring the children into the promised land he was the lawgiver but he didn't bring the children into the promised land Joshua took them over see and the Holy Spirit is the one that's taking them over now Christ made the way and the plans as was The Giver of the law and so forth but the Holy Spirit takes the church to the promised land and the Rapture taking it up the Holy Spirit In The Rapture amen so who is Joshua Joshua is the holy spirit right come on somebody he tells us also in the message as I was with Moses this is what he says about who Joshua is all right he says paragraph 37 now Joshua the new Warrior only two left now that ever left the promised land that was Joshua and Caleb Joshua the new Commander to lead an army to step into the place where a great man like Moses stood it was no little task and I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand and in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister is called to stand where he did the works that I do shall you do also each minister is ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command and how it must have felt when Joshua was standing there that morning talking to God I'll not fail thee as I was with Moses so I'll be with you no ma no man shall stand before you all the days of your life I'll destroy and devour I'll make the way clear only be strong and very courageous be not dismayed that's worry don't be afraid I'm with you I'll see you through what a commission to be given to this new man called Joshua how many needs to be encouraged like that that's right don't be dismayed I'll be with you it is a great command to stand where Jesus stood who can do it who is worthy who is able no man but he said I'll be with you and I will stand with you and the works that I do you will do also who said that and who did he say say it too amen amen it's a tall order it's a tremendous task it's a a life it's not something you can do on the side it's a life focus it requires your all of your attention at all times to walk in the tracks of our Lord Jesus to Walk as Joshua walk walked amen and so we see that those are some of the types the type of the Holy Spirit a minister can look at that and take those types and apply to his own life and his own Ministry but we see that in the pickup your pen it is a type of the last day Ministry Joshua is a type of the last day leader how many believe that right if we believe those other ones got to believe this one too that's right so he's the last day leader which leader are we talking about we're talking about the three main scriptures that identify him that's uh uh Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 as we have shared with you many times that you can't replace those with the group of people this is the ministry of Elijah the ministry of the son of man the ministry of the seventh angel let us stand with all three of those and of the three the one that seems to be the most complicated one as we brought last Sunday night is this ministry of the son of man and being um impersonated Again by a son of man so the Elijah Ministry not I mean takes a lot to receive that but Elijah spoke of restoration uh bringing uh the orders back and God used that his Justice and then the seventh angel bringing out those Mysteries that's beautiful thing and a lot of people can Embrace that but this you know the the the the Elijah Ministry is one out of five men of the O of the whole Plan of Redemption of God dealing with human beings sir one man out of five it's not a large group of people to compare yourself with and against it was Elijah Elisha John the Baptist brother brandham and then the Elijah to come in Revelations 11 very small group you got five men representing to the entire I like all of all of human history one out of five and then you take the seventh angel It's one out of seven seven men that ever hit the globe as it pertains to Redemption and the planet of redemption we got seven men that God chose huh and then with the son of man how many of those do we have brother rand's Ministry was the only one that we have ever seen to manifest the son of man to a people that was reserved for this day so he came to the Samaritan he came to the Jew as the son of man but he never came to the Gentile till our day but yet he made mistakes and yet this is not it's flawed word and yet we can criticize it that's on you yes sir all right you ain't never seen a Ministry like this there is no other example of a son of man representing the son of man like this ministry show me one that's right all right of course Paul was a son of man Jeremiah was a son of man but none of them had to represent the sign of the Messiah to a generation of people to a race of people you see the exclusivity of it you see why there's a challenge there you see where the conflict can arise yes and so we share with you these scriptures in Revelations chapter 19 verse number 10 where this office even confused John and who was John some guy off the streets who was John John bowed down to worship this angel yes it's like John what you doing man what are you doing John what you doing don't you know Jesus is and John got confused Revelations 19 was turned there quickly twice he did can I take my time this morning Revelations 19 so in verse number 10 and I fell at feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of pro prophecy so John bows down to worship the Angel that's showing him these things and the angel prevented him now in chapter 20 he does it again but the scriptures opened up even more to us on who this Angel was what verse do I want Saints huh we want 22 yes that's what we want what did I call 21 20 what scripture do I want are you sure yes 22 you got your Bible out or you waiting for it to come on the screen here you don't got your own Bible I don't need to bring a Bible to my church they just we're just as lazy as we can be I don't have to find I don't even know where job is I don't know where habca is but they am in the back they know how to get it they put it up there on the screen for me you better get your own Bible Saints amen I was telling the Saints in Mesa on Thursday and traveling on that plane 6 hours in a 9-h hour flight and those long flights I first thing I do in traveling I take that one of the first things I do I take my Bible it out I put it right on that table right there and that just sets the tone for everything else people set next to me they know what I'm about people walking up and down like leave brother man alone yeah if I'm reading an iPad I could be doing whatever but this right here speaks for itself it commands a presence and then other of like Faith they'll be talking to you they'll say oh I love that Bible that's a great book and then it opens up Fellowship amen there's no book like this one Revelations 22 and verse number 8 and I John saw these things and heard them when I heard them and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which show me these things then Sith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the what Propet prophets and of them which keep the Saints of this book worship God very nice amen Lord so they asked brother bradam that question in the message 1964 questions and answers paragraph number 59 if you just take Revelations 19 it shows you that it was a fellow servant an angel but Revelations 228 shows that it was actually a prophet and he ask brother Brandon this question question 382 dear brother brandham would Jesus not accept worship and Revelation by John when he fa to why would not Jesus receive Worship in Revelation by John when he allowed worship before him why wouldn't Jesus receive worship when John wanted to worship him my dear brother or sister whoever it is it was not Jesus that would not receive Worship in Revelations 228 you'll read it was the prophet Angel who would not receive worship when John fell down to worship the angel that it showed him these things he said see that you do it not for I am of thy fellow Brethren I am one of the prophets see I am thy fellow brother thy fellow servants one of the prophets give worship to God it wasn't Jesus didn't accept it it was the prophet that wouldn't accept it now you can go through and crack your head to find out which prophet he's talking about but I believe I know who it is right all right and we see that is absolutely one of those elements that follow the ministry of brother brandham it's part of it that's right it's part of it so just because that's part of it that doesn't me mean I need to shy away from everything that he said see I have to stand like Caleb and then I have to stand with Joshua and all of the scriptures that pertain to Joshua Elijah Revelations 10 um Luke 17:30 everything that applies to Joshua all the scriptures I have to stand with that and that sometimes is the only witness that I will have it's nice to have a witness with you Jesus sent out the disciples to by two and Proverbs tell us a two cord uhh uh two are better than one if one Falls one can help the other and your work is more satisfied or gratified when you have two and even three can even be greater than just one but sometimes you can't even find a witness to stand with you but the word is always a witness so when you stand you're not standing by yourself or standing by Theory you're standing with with something and what are you standing with we're standing with the word of the Lord and that's the only witness that's the only support that we need sometimes that's the only support that we have and this many times will shrink your friendship crowd it shrinks the numbers but then it'll expand in numbers with another crowd of people that believe like you amen but you're not looking for the crowd you're looking for the right stand you're looking for the position you're supposed to take and that position will always be in the word of the Lord Caleb was standing with the word of the Lord and it just so happened Joshua was twoo Moses was twoo and so let us stand like Caleb you know it it to me a another great miracle is that scripture that we read there in in Joshua 14 where Caleb says the Lord kept me alive I mean like of all of the men my age that is walking through and saw what we saw 40 years later I'm still got the strength that I had when I was 20 or when I was 40 I got this I'm 80 years old I still got the same to me that's the miracle find me a friendship 40 years old find me somebody that will be with you in 40 years from today and you still got the same strength you always had your peers have fallen aside this group has changed his ways the church Dynamics have changed from what I came in 30 years ago it has changed the people have changed the churches have changed pastors Ministries have changed but Cale love the he said the Lord kept me alive and the strength I got today is the same strength that I had back then praise the name of the Lord tell me that ain't a miracle all right you know I'm not I'm not just Al liive but I'm living amen he's not just alive just like breathing no I got strength to go out strength to come back in the Lord promis me and I remember his promises yeah let's stand like that what kind of church member are you anyways huh you know Caleb had some friends he had his he he had his associates and the Bible names these fellows yes they're named each tribe had a leader that was chosen to go and spy out the land and bring back a report who didn't know how powerful k was until this time arised until this treacherous hour it's a tremendous hour of unbelief but we starting to see who we can say high five to and shake hands with we're starting to find out real quick Which pull pits we're welcomeing which assemblies I can feel comfortable in who I can walk with with finding out more and more aren't we because that crowd it kind of shrinks down you know I remember as I said we we we I I played football most of my life my teenage years in high school I was pretty good but the team I was on was very sorry and we were sorry and I knew it but we had some good players on there and we would go play these other school they looked sharp they looked nice they had the support I mean all of their equipment matched our helmets didn't even match our equipment looked like was this donated like what was the budget at when we was going to put this together and it's like we just scrap whatever we go out there and play play our heart out had a great time but when we saw a team that was really wellb built where their socks and the wrist bands all matched and the headbands and all the little towel it all matched we be like we couldn't say it out loud but we be like we going to get it today they look nice we can't say it out loud because we got we about to battle these guys but you go back and you look at the support and so you look at in the military military they have these levels of of of of of Warriors and everybody in the military is not the same just like Israel they're not all the same and you take you take the military you take the budget that they would take for maybe 10,000 men and now they take that same budget and put it towards 500 men you have more money per man what kind of a man you think you're going to build he'll be highly skilled highly intelligent all the tools that he needs to succeed all right because somebody invested in him what about God's word God gave us everything to succeed as a strong Soldier Hallelujah he spared nothing and making sure I had the equipment making sure I knew what the quotes were yes sir making sure I got the full message making sure I can search it and find out what the prophet said about it then when I find out what he said then I can stand with that stand with it stand with Joshua amen amen yes sir I got something to stand with I got somebody to stand like yes sir praise the Lord yes sir we got all the quotes to make you a better Soldier a better Mama a better young person a better Pastor a better believer we got the word of the Lord to make you a better you yes sir bless this wonderful name did he give you what you had need of all right yes he did so this Caleb in numbers 13 the Bible says let's look at them for a minute all right numbers 13 Lord help us now the prophet gave us somebody to stand like huh have some you studied Caleb huh no I didn't study my pastor studied it for me we'll find out about it on Sunday no no no no he's talking about you Saints all the unbelief in this hour all of the tactics of the devil all of of the treacherous and the unbelief being spew out there what kind of man can stand how can the Lord keep you alive if you're not using what he gave you to keep you alive amen look at numbers Numbers Chapter 13 Verse number what verse do I want Saints who said 30 thank you we start giving out some Stars they maybe participate a little bit more numbers 1330 that's what I want yes and Caleb stealed the people there's one quote where brother bam says Joshua told the people to shut up has anybody ever told you to shut [Music] up yes like zip it up we're done here hearing from you like shut up that's kind of rude isn't it but it's required because I need to say something and everybody's talking stop talking all right because I need to say something and and and and when Caleb stealed the people he had something to say and and notice Caleb he didn't ask he Moses can I speak or Joshua is this the right thing to say no it was in my heart he said it was in my heart I saw the fruit I saw the land I even have a house built I knew where my property line was going to be I came back prepared I'm ready to take the land God said we can have the [Applause] land prise the Lord amen yes sir Caleb Still The People before Moses and said what' he say let us go up at once and possess it for we are what you know these are the kind of friends I want brother George this the kind of people I want talking to me talk like this this crazy talk right this kind of the talk the people that I want to hear talking this kind of yeah we can do it we got this we're more than conquerors we're Overcomers don't worry about it God's got your back he's got you taken care of it's already done he already promising I need a man I need a friend that can remind me of the scripture remind me of the promises remind me something that the Holy Ghost has said already to inspire me to Quicken me in its omnipotent speaking but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report you know this doesn't change this evil report is still being brought up today now here what the prophet of God says here in the message spiritual food in due season all right here what the prophet says when Jesus was on Earth paragraph 58 when Jesus was on Earth he had as much unbelief to contend with that we have today and maybe more but it didn't stop him he went right on performing and carrying out his duty and God confirming everything think he done he said I'm not by myself my father and I are one he dwells in me drop down to paragraph number 126 he says this here we notice here again if the word is in us and has come to us as it did Elijah in that day it'll do the same thing that he did he would feed on the secret things of God which is hid from the the world oh again it makes the message and the messenger as one spiritual food is ready and it's in season now and each one of you can have this food amen if you wish it if you are willing to steal away from all the unbelief of this hour if you're ready to come into Christ come into His promise so we see there's a this is a tremendous hour of unbelief if you listen to enough people talk they're going to influence you one way or the other and you need to steal those voices in your hearing unplug them disconnect them unsubscribe them get rid of them move them out of your hearing space because we have enough to hear that is positive we have what we need to hear to get ready for the Rapture and the unbelief in the this hour is so great Lord help us stand like Caleb stand with Joshua who is Joshua Joshua is the word who is Joshua Malachi 4 who is Joshua Luke 17:30 revealed who is Joshua Revelations 10:7 Revelations 18 Genesis 24 elizer all of it Glory all of it take one more here 1965 I've heard but now I see the prophet of God says this here paragraph 110 he said I'll give them a sign an everlasting sign a virgin shall conceive an everlasting sign now we find that in those hours of real stress that's usually when the spirit of God moves in he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved a hand but when he moved he moves so it's an unbelievable hour of stress brother bam called it a tremendous hour a hour that Satan has threatened and he's carried out his threat threat he's poisoned the minds of the people and all the the deceit and every tactic that he ever use has been poured out in this age but we have been given a command to stand like someone and then stand with someone who are you standing with today who are you standing like today I want to be a general in God's Army not just a private not just here not just getting by I want to be a Caleb a man living off of a conviction amen a man that knows how to cry and weep for the burden of the word to be manifested in his life a man that can be honest and say I don't have what I should have so Lord please help me don't let me move on until this gets fixed in my life I want to be an honest man that's the kind of man that God sent to us a weeping prophet a blushing Prophet told on himself open up the Deep the depth of his heart to us it's been recorded what kind of man I want to stand like that's the kind of man I want to be like like a Caleb we don't know who he is yet we didn't know who he was until Cades barer came and we didn't know this treacherous hour would come it was prophesied to come and actually the prophecy says that we will be forced to stop preaching some of them already stopped preaching all right yes they don't preach on the Holy Ghost They Don't Preach on the third pool They Don't Preach on the blessings of God they don't preach on who the son of man is they already stop preaching it's just a jelly donut service yes lollipops and candy and popcorn it's like some social Affair ain't nobody going to the altar we might as well take it out and we ain't using it no more but there's some Joshua in there there's some calebs out there somewhere that ain't going to play Church like that they'll pick up the quotations they'll pick up the word and not point it at other people but they'll point it at themselves and they'll run to the altar and say Lord make my church what I'm reading about in the Bible make my life what I'm hearing on them tapes make me a Caleb Lord Not Just One of Israel one of many playing around God help us I pray Lord help us amen this is a time brother bandam talks about the two omnipotence me oh my what if we had a church that had two calebs you think our song service well we had a good one this morning Our Song service would be like that all we get two or three calebs man the rest of y'all can go home I got I got three calebs in the service we're going to have church that's all there is to it give us a couple couple calebs drop a few Lord in the in the congregations in tucon sprinkle a few over here and there I want one Lord I want to be one I want to be like Caleb one out of two million that had a testimony to stand on and then God look down and says you know what I'm going to keep you alive everybody else will die you're going to stand alive and you will possess the ground that your feet was upon your soul brought you to it and now I'm going to give you what your soul had longed for and that's what I want don't you isn't that what you want oh Jesus help us look at this quotation here as I close here paragraph 14 prophet of God says this here paragraph 14 in the message hear ye him he says now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word the two Inspirations together gives a result no matter how well you study the word it will never do you no good to you're inspired yourself it takes your inspiration the words already inspired so what we need today is an inspiration over us God sweeping down with a new inspiration breathing over us his power and his love in himself that it might Inspire us to Quicken us to his word amen bless this wonderful name there's one more I wanted to get to you I don't have it up here where brother B talked about 150 votes it's going this way and then Jesus his word says 150 votes going this way then another 150 votes going the other way when those two meet it's 150 votes going the same direction the word that we have received is a powerful word Saints it it it it's not in every it's not in every place that's called a church you know this message that we have huh you know a tape service you get to come to a tape service man that's an explosion waiting to happen it's how you're looking at it is that right huh okay I said that was my last quote it's not my last quote I I got another little portion here can I get it to it all right God bless you you ain't preaching tonight I'm not preaching tonight that's right what time is it anyways so let let let me let me take this a little bit further all right bless Lord I trust the Lord will bless you richly now the prophet talking about this Joshua and Caleb paragraph number 17 in the message stand still he says this here it's a nervous age what it is that's right then I give this solemn warning to the church stand still God always commands to stand still before he does anything if the churches in this neurotic age every church is appr procel liting and pulling and fussing and stewing it's a neurotic age but stand still now that's the message this Caleb here the people had just come back the spies from over in the promised land that was kades barnea they had been brought through many trials and had seen the hand of God very beautiful picture of the Full Gospel Church and many of them had become discouraged discouraged and upset because so many different isms and things has happen in the church but that don't take away the real thing God's calling his church to Halt stand still don't be jumping and running not knowing what you're doing come back to the word come back to Christ Caleb there was 10 spies that come back and said oh it's impossible for us to do it why I said there great places Are Walled and there are giants in the land we nearly look like grasshoppers to the side of them oh we are a failure we can't do it and of course 10 against two they were outnumbered but Joshua and Caleb took their stand and said we are more than able to do it but before Caleb or Joshua could speak Caleb had to steal the people first get them quiet stand still don't be running here and running there and jumping at this and jumping at that now what made Caleb so sure of it when the opposition was so great it's according to what you're looking at Caleb was looking at the promise of God the other 10 was looking at circumstances if you go to look in at circumstance or to look what's around you you're sure to fail but you must never look at what's around you how many say praise the Lord to that think of that think of that Saints be encouraged don't be discouraged be encourage look at what the word of God has said about you not only is this ministry today one of seven and then one of five and then one of only the Lord Jesus himself but you yourself are one of a million out of a million the True Believer that has taken a stand is a very small number and that's how God made it that way True Believers have to be able to follow the conviction of the Lord and that might change the Dynamics of your friends and the way people view you you might lose a job opportunity you might lose you know a lot of social things but but but you're living by a conviction and so that crowd of friends might shrink I've seen it happen over the years but it's amazing how you lose friends because you took a stand on the word and then there's another opening of friends that you didn't even know existed a whole another world exists outside of the unbelief of the hour remember brother bram's Ministry was rejected totally rejected they had them lots of people loved them then his crowd shrunk down and nobody wanted nobody but then a prophecy came said a huge portion of Heaven awaits you he didn't have a much down here but a huge portion of Heaven awaits you man what about that you take a position on God's word by conviction you have it in your heart not quoting other people but it's in your heart it's in the word of the Lord it might cost you some friends might cost you a little bit but the big picture of the Lord will give you everything you think you lost all right and so much more how many lived long enough to know what I'm talking about how many's been in the word long enough to know what I'm talking about that that's true yes yes yes yes you can't be serving the lord yes yes take this last one here all right and if there ever was an hour this is in the message God keeps his word musicians come please thank you paragraph 37 now they sent out 10 spies and they cross over come back with the report when they come back all but two said it's impossible paragraph 37 and God keeps his word 1957 they cross over they come back with a report all but two said it's impossible for us to take the land we just can't do it said our oppositions too great their walls are high we look like grasshoppers up beside them they are Men of War and they're well trained and we have no way of doing it but there was two one Joshua and one Caleb who stood and quieted the people and if there ever was an hour oh listen to this if there ever was an hour that the Church of the Living God needs of Joshua and Caleb it's now that we can quiet the people before the holy spirit all of our little frantics and denominations and running this and this has got it that has got it stand still a minute God has got it that's the idea the Bible is the answer to every problem that ever come up God has got the answer you sit still now of course these ministers who said that we cannot do this it's impossible for us to do this there were 10 against two so it was hard and they looked at what they could see that's the way it is today depends on what you're looking at if you're looking at the opposition we can't do it we can't do it but I'm not looking at the opposition I'm looking to what God Said God said it could be done and it will be done if you're just looking what not farther than the end of your nose as the expression is it'll never be done but I'm looking at the word of the Lord looking at what God Said Caleb had another Spirit on him the Bible says that Caleb had another spirit with him is what the scripture says so he wasn't standing by himself was he but it appears like you do have to be willing to stand by yourself but God always has a witness and sometimes the only witness you can find to agree with you is the word itself you and the word but it's so nice to have Brethren friends Saints of the most high God that you can connect with and share the word of the Lord with and then when I'm weak that friend can help strengthen me and then when he's weak I can help strengthen him the military does such a fine job of that they s them out too in those Seals training and the special ops they train them you know in groups you learn how to lean and depend on one another you got to have a friend and God has a friend for you and it's found in the word how many friends do you need well just one just one Jesus is that friend and he'll bring others into your into your world into your circle that you have made the decision to follow so God bless you be like Caleb stand with Joshua let's let us pray amen God bless each of you this morning pray the Lord Jesus bless you richly if you like to be included in this prayer to commit your heart to this Caleb character why don't you raise your hand and yes Lord Jesus that you want to be like Caleb and then you want to stand with something we're all standing with something we want to stand with Joshua and all of the scriptures pertaining to who Joshua is oh God you see those hands that are raised True Believers Lord Desiring this in their life as the word was preach Lord and the word of the Lord is true we have no word of our own your word is true and father we align oursel with that and those hands that are raised those hearts may you bless them may you hear the prayer oh God that they would begin to pick up this Caleb anointing go through the scriptures and find that he didn't have a support of a lot of of his peers he didn't have a lot of people that was doing what he was doing but the spirit was with him and we're still talking about him today Lord and all the other 10 their names have been written and we don't even know who they are they've disappeared in our memories they've Fallen aside but Caleb and Joshua we remember them cuz you kept them alive to fulfill your promise and here in the last day a humble little man was studying the word and you inspired him by the Holy Spirit to pick up his pen and he began to write down precious things that I have recorded in my own personal study and Lord I read those things and we have read those things the Holy Spirit told him to write it down said to stand like Joshua stand like Caleb oh God I pray you help us to put our life in role to role play who Caleb was and that will do that starting from today oh God to make it more meaningful to us to make it more oh God personal to us that's my cry that's my prayer today it's in the mighty name of Jesus Christ I ask these Blessings Now bless your Saints bless Believers here bless the service tonight Lord send your anointing Upon Us Quicken us with the words that we need for our souls Lord from The Young Ones to the
