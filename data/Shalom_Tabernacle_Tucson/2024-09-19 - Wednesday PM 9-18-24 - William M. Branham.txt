places in the scripture we're going to finish up the message we listened to two week two Wednesdays ago the way back there's a second half to that kind of the prayer line portion will go right well with our our prayer meeting amen second Kings chapter 1 and then also in Jeremiah chapter 8 Second Kings one and verse is number one two and amen it's always good to be in the house of the Lord amen then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death after the death of Ahab andai fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick and he sent Messengers and said unto them go inquire of babove the god of eon whether I shall recover of this disease but the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the tishbite rise go up to meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them is it not because there is no God in Israel that you go to inquire of be elove the god of eon brother bam takes Jeremiah chapter 8 vers number 22 and the word says is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered amen we'll go to that message the way back amen sing only believe want to bring you greetings from the good speeds they always send a little note with their offering every month or every couple of weeks and I just want to greet the Saints on their behalf they always they put in their trust all is well we find here in Iowa sure appreciate the online services God bless amen so we'll remember them and extend our blessing to them amen only be only all things are possible only believe only believe only we all things are possible God bless you may be seated brother brand do you believe do you believe I want your undivided attention for just a few moments I want you to believe all your heart I want you to believe with all your heart the Lord God the Bible says the Lord God has promised believe or that as many as believe were saved now that sounds awful little but you see when you really believe that's all you can do then God has to when you really believe it then God pours out the Holy Ghost upon you and then God vindicates his word now the Bible said wait a minute I believe before I do this I believe there was go to be a prayer line is that right all right how many wants to go back to Pentecost raise up your hand how many believes that the prescription is still good amen it sure is the Baptist the Holy Ghost not an education not to go up and get your PhD and then when Nicodemus come to the Lord Jesus Jesus he said what must I do to have eternal life a man 80 years old been a priest all his life what must I do to have eternal life Jesus didn't say Go Polish up on your scholarship he didn't say go seek a higher office in your organiz a no he flatly told him he he he absolutely rebuked him for being a man of his caliber and then not knowing those things that you got to be born again we take it too sir that's the same thing tonight see we take it too lightly we just take some kind of sensation say I was borned again and go ahead and your life proves out it doesn't do that something wrong yes sir or you say but I know that man's a good man no matter how good he is that don't have nothing to do with it you don't meet any people in muhammadans and things like that sweet and everything certainly not oh no sometimes heathens Idol worshipers sweet and humble as they can be that doesn't mean nothing no sir these signs shall follow them that believe that's what the doctor said this is the result of the inoculation there you are yes sir that's the thing the doctor said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also of aie did you see it that's a sign of a Believer we take the sign of a good man goes to church and Pays His ties that's good that's fine but that ain't what Jesus said these signs shall follow them the works that I because if the life that's in a peach tree can be taken out of the peach tree and be injected into a apple tree it will no more bear apples but peaches because the germ of Life of peach life is in in the apple tree and it's got to Bear peaches exactly right brother Williams is sitting here in front of me a very personal sweet friend of mine I he called brother Sher this morning and I had prayer for him over the phone I was standing with brother Sher one time in a Citrus Grove and there was a tree standing there up a tree of uh I believe it was a orange tree and it it had about four or five different kinds of fruit on it and I said well what kinde of tree is that brother John he said it's a it is a orange tree well I said I see a grapefruit a tangerine a tangelo a lemon I said he all these different fruits he said oh yes I said how he said they're grafted CIT well I said now that's wonderful is he said yeah anything the Citrus life will live with it that's very good I stop something stop me I looked again like that day and over in Finland when that little boy was laying dead I said Brother Moore that's that little fell I told you about right here inport a little boy be raised from the dead in a certain place that's that's him no he's got to come back death can't hold him no more God spoke he I said death turn him loose here he was amen God can't lie no no I said brother John I see something you see I said I want to ask you something brother John cuz I want to get a sermon out of this I said now next year those all those um uh citrus fruits like uh lemon and tangerine and grapefruit all that will drop off and the bear oranges he said oh no no no no he said it'll bear its kind he said the on got a lemon branch in it will Bry a lemon and the one that bears has got a uh Tangerine will bear a tangerine well I said yeah I thought you said it was a orange tree he said yes I said did he quit bearing Orange He said no when the original tree puts out original vine it Bears an orange that's it that's it these denominations has been grafted in they're still bearing denominational fruit membership so forth but when the tree puts out original Branch again there'll be a book of Acts behind it I am the vine you are the branches why the life that's that's injected from the original vine puts forth a branch it is a Pentecostal Branch with Pentecostal results for the Life of Christ is in the branch and it does his works I haven't got the gift of speaking in tongues but I sure feel like I'd like to oh wow the spirit Bears record in my soul it Bears record with the word that these things are true how many do you believe how many of you in here that's got prayer cards raise up your hand I put your hands down how many in you that does not have prayer cards and yet you're sick want something from God raise up your hand all right you believe father all right you believe our heavenly father I know I'm standing before an audience that's quite a few of them are new feeling your spirit settling down now I've spoke your word and read your prescription I've told the people that's the way back now Nicodemus recognized and so did the sanin when they seen you incarnate they said Rabbi we know you're a man sent from God for nobody could do these things that you do except God be with him and that same group knowing that by the works and he said he did and promised that his Believers would do the same work they called called him be elub and said his Doctrine deceive the people time hasn't changed father we're in another C unel didn't but you stayed right on unbelief didn't stop you you moved right on just the same doing what the father told you to do when you made your clear statements that I do nothing the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing you could tell Phillip where he was at under the tree when Nathaniel found him you could tell Simon that he was a son of Jonas called his name in his father's name you told the woman at the well you your faith of one blind man stops you a little woman with a blood ISU touch the B of your garment wholly impossible for you to feel it physically but you stopped and told her her troubles and said they had ceased let that life that was in Christ come into this group just a few moments Lord that they might know that you're still God I've just got through telling them Lord your word man coming around and saying this that and never a little gimmick but Lord what does it testify of there's a real one somewhere Lord God let it come forth tonight let the Holy Spirit speak and not man give Faith to this church Lord I realize you just couldn't anoint one of us youve got to anoint many of us anoint us together Lord as your church let it be known that you're God and I've told the truth I'm standing on your word even through opposition but I've tried to be true not saying that for myself Lord and not to these people hear me but I'm praying because The Showdown is at hand I pray that you'll vindicate your word tonight Lord that it is the truth that the life that was in Christ lives in his church and his Believers granted father through Jesus Christ's name amen everyone I want everyone to be just as reverent as you can how many in your strangers to me raise up your hands You' never I can just feel it you've never been in the meetings before now Jesus Christ said in his word in St John 1412 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also do you believe that the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you believe that Hebrews 13:8 all right now the only way to know whether it's Christ or not it's not a dress cuz he dressed like ordinary man if he a sure tonight he wears suit of clothes like we got onard it wasn't his dress it wasn't because he had beard or didn't have beard it was a life that was in him that proved what he was lots of people dressed like him in that day but it wasn't he that's right many people today do the same thing but it don't change it a bit it's aive now the way that they know that he was the Christ is because they had to go by what the scripture say said the Christ would be is that right now what did Moses tell them that Christ would be he'd be a prophet like himself is that right and they all look for because God had told him if there be one among you who's spiritual or Prophet I the Lord will speak to him if it is it'll be true if it isn't then no hearing that's only logical and now when Jesus raised up and when he started into his ministry and Simon came up Peter he told him his name was Simon and told him that his name was Simon and his father's name was Jonas is that true that made a Believer out of him Philip went found uh Nathaniel went and found Philip under a tree and said come see who we found and when he told him what had been taken place he didn't kind of disturbed about it and when he got over there Jesus looked right straight at him and said behold an Israelite in whom there's no God he was a he was a teacher he was a man who know it he said rabbi did you ever know me he said before Philip called you when you under the tree I saw you said Rabbi you're the Son of God you're the king of Israel that's settled it see the woman at the well when he spoke to her many all through the scripture they know that when he was coming he was going to be a god Prophet that was his sign it's always been still is then he notice that when we find out this woman come out he said woman bring me a drink want to care conversation with her she say it's not customary for Jews ask me a woman of Samaria such things we don't have no dealings with one another he said but if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink she said the wells deep you have nothing to draw with and so forth he said go get your husband and come here she said I have no husband he said that's right you've had five and the one you're living with is not your husband you told the truth she said sir now when the Pharisees him do that they said he's a fortune teller be El but that prostitute she said sir but that prostitute she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet we know that when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things that'll be the sign of the Messiah we know when he comes he'll tell us these things he said I'm he that speaks to you and right away she run into the City and said come see a man who told me the things I've done isn't this the very Messiah and the man of the city believed the woman and believed on Christ is that right no wonder he said if I do not the works of my father believe me not beuc now we don't have to be smart we don't have to be educated we have to believe we have to Humble ourselves and empty ourselves for God to manifest himself through us out empty up yourself get yourself out the way the biggest enemy you have is yourself now you believe God do you do it our father now if God our Father father which is the Holy Ghost the father of our Lord Jesus Christ is the Holy Ghost we know that that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and if that Holy Spirit can come into you and I and perform the very life that Christ liveed was your place of Doubt then I've told you the truth about returning going back you believe that if he will do it I don't say he will I remember people believe that these days is pass but he promised it in the last days have to be loyal to this office each one of us has offices we have to be loyal to this office God it's the word the words made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the word tonight is in our flesh to manifest itself to prove that he's God in us it bears fruit of it certain I told you the spirit of Dillinger was in me you expect me to have guns I told you the spirit of of uh artist is in me expect me to paint a picture of if I tell you the spirit of Christ is in me then do the work of Christ that's what he said would it help you to believe let me tell you a little something speaking out of quanas before some doctors at a meeting the other day i' taken a physical with a famous doctor I'm going overseas had a physical examination I did this purposely and he was let me give me an upper lower GI natur taking the heart blood and everything thank God is fast so when I I drink in this SP meal I just made myself real tense and he pressed on my stomach looked through the X-ray he said brother Brandon I said yes sir he said your stomach feels normally but it nothing goes out I said it's supposed to he said yes I said I don't I said it's supposed to he said yes sir I don't understand he said my I don't understand I said um what shall I do he said think of something real good to eat I said why you we do that father what he's say and he said a nice big juicy steak I said I'll compromise for a plate a fried squirrel with pinto beans and he said all right start off I changed and start thinking he said there she goes I said what did that doc he said a little electrical war in your brain sent word down to your stomach I said is that right then speaking I said you remember the little wire I said Doctor what makes you dream did you dream he said yes I said what is it a part of you that's dreaming he said you're subconscious I said a normal human here's one conscious and here's a subconscious you have to go to sleep to get into that conscious he just told me he said I found something brother Brandon again I can't explain it said it's not your nerves he said it's something inside of your nerves I said my soul he said yes said I it is what makes you what you are and I said I asked him about Vision he didn't know nothing about it so I told him I said one conscience is your the other when here you have to get out of this conscious let it become darant in order to get in here but some part of you went somewhere because you can remember dreams and places you was at in your dreams years and years away so that's right I said you see that's an armal but God so sets it to some of us that our first conscience and subconscious is right together we don't go to sleep God just uses it to see things that was and which is and shall come that's prophetic and he said Mr brandom I've read your books on healing he said I certainly agree with you so I'm going to tell you said we have absolute cases here I can prove it science if there's a doctor poost can tell you that he said let a person have a ignacy or a tuber or an ulcer or something that's real bad we know it's go to kill him and we'll tell him that and said if he gets all tore up flustrated angry upset and going on that that patient will die right away but so that patient usually if he's a Christian or something he doesn't mind dying it's just one of the things we have to do dying is part of living so he just goes ahead and takes it on I'll lift you my times out so almost that attitude retires that case said he'll Linger on and on and on and on before he kills him I said all right doctor let me finish my story I said put a lie detector on your arm and stand and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth and watch that needle go negative wasn't why it's a viberation in your nerves you wasn't made to lie you were made to tell the truth a lie such a horrible thing till it interrupts your nerves you ain't made to be angry you're supposed to be at peace like a child with God you're not supposed to be frustrated you're supposed to have faith walk with God see I said that's it I said now doctor if the this man living in his first conscience can take the attitude that if he dies he safe so what difference does it make it'll retire the case for a long time what will it do when it drops out of that first conscious back into the second on the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll take the case completely away that doctor raised up and said marvelous tears run down his cheek I said Doctor you know what's the matter I said our churches don't teach that he said Mr random that's truth I said we need to go back to Pentecost he said I'm Presbyterian said my wife is Presbyterian I said you join a presbyterian law Jes said that's about it I said Doctor a Christian is born again you can't go Jin you got to be born he said Mr Brandon that's the truth and tears get around down his cheeks what baptizing pretty soon now what your fluster will hold that up there and your one conscious will drop it down and make your body function right what will it do when you let the Holy Spirit roll in it'll perform everything that Christ promised you become an instrument of the Holy Spirit got Piere when I was born there's a light hanging there you got the picture here somewhere that's true truth science the truth dying over this platform science has proved it the truth not to me I'm a man I'm nothing I'm just your brother the there's nothing to me predestin but the holy spirit in predestination for ordained gifts God has set in the church not want some Elder lady's hands on God said in the church first apostles then prophets and so forth God set them in there there are Divine gifts for ordained of God before Jeremiah the prophet has ever born God said I know you for you even in your mother's belly and ordained you a a prophet to the Nations before you ever come out of the womb is that right he had nothing to do with it God does that he's still God and you believe with all your heart and you that sick or have a need of God you say Lord God I've heard this message astounding to me I've heard this man claim that you're God and you're right you're in the midst of people if he isn't he told something wrong wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them why he's in you anyhow and when he divide himself among you it comes back to a unit again now you had to be part of that unit to believe that this part of the unit can operate Ministry it if he give me a Ministry he's got somebody he'll believe it or there' be no need of giving me a Ministry that's right you believe with all your heart and see if God doesn't do the thing I don't want you people with prayer cards I want you people hasn't got prayer cards C I'm going to call the prayer cards I want you to take this in your mind I be a real Reverend Christ now Christ could heal because he healed by Vision when the father told him that's right he never healed anybody or perform one Miracle until he saw a vision first how many knows that St John 5:19 he said it himself he's G and can't lie but you see healing has already been purchased now the sacrifice is made he can still Proclaim himself by prophecy and show his signs but healing you have to believe him if you standing here night and you say Lord will you heal me you say I've already done it don't you believe it for he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed do you understand that alive you believe it and see if he's still alive Lord what a challenge I challenge that before half a million people standing against me Bombay India I challenged it before 250,000 Duran South Africa watch God moving on the scene 30,000 blanket natives throw down their idols and become Christians at that minute women start naked as soon as Christ come up on them folded their hands and walked away and then women today in the Pentecostal Church cutting off their clothes and acting and then still say you got the Holy Ghost I'm I love you you know that but I'm I'm I'm zealous when I see my sister God's daughter out there see my brother so cowardly have to stand behind some kind of a fail to preach the word of God that he knows the truth see my sister conducting herself like some Street woman instead of a saint of God truth see some man afraid to stand up proclaim the truth afraid his denomination will kick him out a Son of God I don't that blood don't throw right real genuine Christianity believes a word and holds it holds that promise are your strangers I look around I old brother Williams sitting here I see sister Mo I think that sister Bole set didn't recognize her night I'm trying to see if I see anybody I know I'm trying to see if I see anybody that I know brother here can't his name this brother here I can't think of his name brother Harris I know him brother brother sister down sitting right here from up Ohio I believe I see brothers that's about it I believe I see brother Collins is that right brother Collins a good old Methodist boy received the Holy Ghost one of my deacons at the church now God bless your brother Collins sister colins the holy the holy spirit's coming in now becomes blinding out I wish I could explain this you can't explain God you have to believe God you just have faith don't doubt believe on the Lord Jesus Christ believe the Bible say you should be saved if you believe it say Lord I'm like the woman tou the master you say Lord I'm like the woman who touched the Master's garments I ain't trying to touch that preacher he's a man but the Bible said that you're a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities did he say it that's the New Testament well then if you touch the high priest how would you know you touched him unless he acted the same way he did yesterday and if he's the same he'll act the same is that right that right he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and what happened when that woman touched him and went off and sat down like you are whatever she did Jesus turned around and said somebody touch me Peter said while the whole group's touched you why I say a thing like that he said but I perceive that virtue I went out of me I got weak he looked around till he found the woman told her about her blood issue and said thy faith has saved thee he's the same God tonight he's the same high priest now you believe you believe you that don't know me you that has no prayer card you ask God and be humble about it I remember it's going to take your faith to touch him I can't touch him for you you got to touch him yourself it's your own faith but you believe how many does believe say I believe thou can't believe let's start Roll by just I wish you'd be real let's just start Roll by roll it's just come I I wish you'd be real

was sent forth to for run the first coming of Christ you're sent forth and your message will forun the second when that Baptist Minister where I was already year that set of seventh grade education is

the name of Jesus [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen he said in the name of Jesus Christ amen he said [Music] this we cut the switch there this year may seem very strange but it's only obeying an act of God if you believe that you repent and or baptized you're candidate for the Holy Ghost that's right see well what by Minister a servant of Christ who's brought you the truth Minister the word of God to you then if God comes in his word and they preach the word and the Holy Spirit comes down and proves that to be the truth see friends what happened just a while ago I I don't know God in heaven knows I don't know or whatever it was it must have been glorious because my heart's beating real fast with joy it was something now it looks to me like that a born again church that claims the new birth and are the time of the coming of Christ at hand why with the uh evidence a positive evidence if there was a man standing here with a long row bone his scars and his hand blood running out of his face that still wouldn't be the Christ any impostor could do that but the life that was in Christ be reproduced then you know it's Christ Hallelujah I'm preaching one of these nights on a paradox and that was a paradox you just seen it's something that can't be explained see it's a miracle that how the god of Heaven can produce such now you say could you heal me brother B it's impossible you're already healed if he was standing here wearing my suit that he give me he couldn't do no more that's all he could do was vindicate that he's Christ prove that he's here you have to believe him I can if you believe that's it right now if you believe it that's all there is to it it looks to me like an AR latify it ought to send people to repentance it ought to send people seeking for the Holy Ghost it ought to do something more than it's a doing is a food is a rock is a word seed falling upon Stony ground ladies the church the answer Brethren Church what's the answer what more can God do he never promised another thing you'll never see nothing no greater than the presence of Jesus Christ working in his church performing the things that he promised to do but you know something happened to the church what do you think it took place if 50 years ago that would have broke through see it's got see it's got to be more powerful now to shake the church harder as an enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God Rises a standard against it one of these days it will raise a church come out of its place the Born Again Saints two in the bed I'll take one and leave one two in the field
