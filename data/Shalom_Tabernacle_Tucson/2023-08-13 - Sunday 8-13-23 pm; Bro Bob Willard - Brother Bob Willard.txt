hang on just a moment please let me just thank you God bless you tonight praise God I I feel like I can preach now amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen praise God wonderful we just so nice to be here with all of you and our dear friend brother Israel can any good thing come out of California brother we're looking at one right over here praise God they said that about Jesus can any good thing come out of Nazareth so we just appreciate it brother Israel in his Gallant stand on the Gospel of Jesus Christ and we recognize brother sister that we're standing before the purchase of his blood we don't take that lightly our desire tonight of course is just to as God would help us get out of the way and have him speak to us through his word amen we can turn the pages of this Bible we can read the statements and quotes of our seventh Church age messenger but God Alone is the only one that can give divine revelation of his word so we're depending on him tonight praise the Lord we thank the musicians and brother Tim I didn't realize you could play one of those things he did a beautiful job there I wish I could sit on a box and make it sound like that it's tremendous brother Trevor good to see you on the steel and just each and sister Sharon and God bless you brother Zach good to see all of you praise God I feel I just feel at home amen praise God brother George you know when you've got brother George in the meeting he's really the only one you need I know I'm going to hear some amens I'm just going to have to have the brothers turn this mic up so you can still hear me so it's just good you can tell I'm feeling right at home God bless you tonight if you would turn in your Bibles with me I want to read from the gospel of Saint John chapter 16. and as the Lord will help us tonight we have several messages up here um and we want to just take some things that brother Branham preached uh later in his ministry late 61 brother banham preached a message there in the Branham Tabernacle you must be born again and then January of 65 he preached a message birth pains so here I've got both these messages up here with me tonight they're very very outstanding uh later in brother benham's Ministry of course we know that brother Branham being the manifestation of Malachi 4 5 that he was sent to restore the hearts of the children back to that faith that was once delivered to the Saints and uh but just very striking to me the things that he points out in these two messages especially the message in 65 birth pains and so we want to take this text out of Saint John 16 which brother Branham refers to this in the message birth pains so we'll pick it up here Jesus speaking verse 20. fairly verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and Lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy [Music] a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow but her hour is come because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembareth no more the anguish for the joy that a man is Born Into the world Amen Let us just approach the author for a moment before we're seated Heavenly Father how we thank you tonight Lord from the very depths of our hearts for the grand privilege that you've extended to each of us tonight to be able to assemble ourselves those of like Precious faith Lord in the house of God this evening and Lord we thank you for the privilege and we ask your favors tonight Lord that you would just move us out of the way would you please raise us up together in Heavenly places and father speak to our hearts is only you can and would you impart to each of us Lord that measure of Revelation that you've ordained for the service tonight that Lord we be not just hearers but also doers of your word we commit the remainder of the service into thine hands and that to your glory in the lovely name of Jesus Christ God's people said amen you may be seated tonight thank you so much for your patience now in getting started this evening and I'd like to take you just a moment here and point something out as it pertains to the title of the two messages that we were mentioning a moment ago the one you must be born again which we know is Jesus's first Doctrine is you must be born again because of the Fallen birth that we come into the world with the Bible says conceived in sin shaped in iniquity come the world speaking lies that God requires a new birth and so we know that brother banham said over and over he said that if you are not born again you're lost so in order to make the Kingdom of Heaven to see the kingdom of heaven we must be born again and so what I'd like to point out as the Lord would help us is in this title that he preached late 61 you must be born again and then January of 65 he entitles his message birth pains and what's so striking to me in this message is that brother branham's Focus is not so much the born part as it is on what it takes to get there because the two words birth and born are two completely different meanings so I want to take that tonight and getting started here this is out of the Webster dictionary but the word birth in its meaning is the act of coming in to life it means the ACT of bringing forth so brother sister we all know it's required to be born again and every single one of us here tonight certainly if we're not recipients of this are seeking this brother Benham said the theme of every Apostles message was have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and so this birth means the act of bringing forth and born means brought forth so the born is a result of the birth so brother sister if we're truly Desiring and seeking this experience and and I've got something here tonight if you've been born again already I'm going to say it this way you're not finished yet brother Madam on the tape said that's where you Pentecostals made your mistake he said you were born in the family by the genuine Holy Ghost but you failed to continue with the tutor and become an heir so you see brother sister a Christian walk isn't just one birth if you've ever heard the tape or studied the message blasphemius names and brother it's one of the keynote uh messages for me he preached this the month following the statures of a perfect man and I want to read this to you this boy you talk about you know there's times in your listening to the message or studying and we recognize that God knows what he's doing with each of us as individuals he knows how to unfold spiritual food in due season you can hear it take 50 times and on that 51st time a statement will stand out that you never even remembered was there [Music] but when I came across this many many years ago oh let me read it to you brother Benham says how do you get in the church this is Page 39. born how do you get into the church born by what the Breath of God he says Breathe on Me Breathe on Me Spirit of living God breathe on me that's my prayer just let the Holy Spirit breathe oh my for the Breath of God what is it sealed away in the kingdom of God knowing that when I first confessed I believe Jesus Christ yea he says then to my faith at virtue see the Blasphemous names brother banham picks up on the lesson of statures of a perfect man and I believe just puts a few finishing touches to that lesson of course we know that there's an illustration that goes with it and God dealt with the church ages dispensationally the same way that he deals with the individual now here he says that's my prayer he says then add to my faith I add virtue Godly virtue then to my virtue I add knowledge of the word to my knowledge I had Temperance self-control he goes on to say tested don't you worry 3 Satan will try them for you just want to encourage you tonight that after this lesson Satan is just waiting there as a tool in God's hand to test you and brother if we'll be honest with ourselves and God brother through these messages you can know exactly where you're standing in your journey and growth in Christ you know I have found as I've gotten older and I am officially old I have a Medicare card when you get that in the mail just face the facts you are old but brother sister the prophet of God in his 50s on the tape he talked about Satan's crown he said I do not want Satan's Crown in my life I do not want to become a grumpy grouchy bitter old man but I want to be crowned with the fruits of the spirit brother Madam said life dishes out its disappointments he says you have to learn to let them go the Bible says let not the sun go down upon your Wrath so you see brother sister as we get older you might think you know what I'm fellowshipping with the same group of people that I have fellowshipped with for years but for some reason they're all getting more aggravating [Music] yes I've not changed but everybody else is just getting more aggravating now when you feel that way do yourself a favor walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror because the problem's not with the folks brother banham said we are our worst enemy so brother sister the prophet of God said thus saith the Lord You Have To Change brother you're not going to be an adopted son and daughter of God if you're not changing because it's line upon line line upon line here a little there little precept precept brother when you finally die out enough to get born again now you enjoy that experience but I'm letting you in on a secret you're in for it you ain't your brother you just you're just starting brother Madam said from there you grow up yes you don't get born an adult you're not born again a matured Christian there's things that must be added now brother look you might hear these things I know how I have and you think oh Lord how am I ever gonna get there well brother he required it and if God requires it he makes a way for us to obtain it now if you try to do it all I'm telling you right now it ain't gonna work but see that's why brother sister a Christian walk is a walk of self-denial Paul said I Die daily I know yeah so here look what he says tested don't you worry Satan will try them for you I'm climbing up the ladder now see I've added virtue knowledge Temperance now I've got to add patience I still ain't got the Holy Ghost brother when I read said what I got this far and I ain't got the Holy Ghost but mother look you've got to keep these statements within the context that they're being made brother Madam is not referring to the birth here he's referring to the seal to the adoption so you see you brother you've got to rightly divide these things the way they were divided for us so you see brother it doesn't mean that you weren't born again because look okay watch let me read it watch he says I still ain't got the Holy Ghost then after I add patience I add godliness you know what that is like God I add that don't miss don't misbehave myself go like a Christian gentleman ought to let that not be a put on but something in me you've already got brother sister the nature of a lamb through that new birth experience now the dove can lead you so brother sister you ain't adding nothing without the Holy Ghost adding it otherwise you're just a crow trying to stick some dove feathers in there okay watch he says oh go like a Christmas gentleman ought to not be a put on something in me the love of God just boiling boy I could do it but maybe I better not uh uh he says uh you got to go beyond that brother it's got to be something as brother man put it in statures of a perfect man from the sweetness of your heart forgiving every man now watch watch he says it's there anyhow he says it's a birth now look what he says next I've been birthed into this into this into this into this into this seven times he States it I've been birthed into this into this into this so you see brother sister our growth in Christ is dependent upon a birth and you can't have a birth without a death right and president that's the hard part brother even though we come into a wonderful service and under the anointing of God brother it's not enough because you're made of three Realms you've got a body of spirit and a soul you can come into a wonderful Holy Ghost meeting you might even shout and have a time and you leave no different it's going to drop deeper than just the flesh deeper than the spirit down into the soul brother Benham called it a birth of the word he said if you truly have that you will punctuate every word of God with an amen you might not understand it all I don't understand it all but I believe every word Jesus told those men on the road oh fools and slow of heart to believe some all that the prophets have spoken so you see brother sister the birth of the word is what we're looking for because look the prophet of God said your birth is not your conception brother a birth just produces what was sown let every seed bring out brother banham in the you must be born again he says false teachers produce false births a birth's a birth but brother you've got to be sure that the seeds you've sown that your birth is based on the word Jesus asked Peter who the men say I the son of man in Peter he said upon this Revelation I'll build my church so here he points this out he says into this into this and then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that up in me for service then what does he do when he gives me the Holy Ghost he sets you out in a separate place to yourself marks you a different person he says the wedding garment's been put on you he says then when we have met these qualifications and become full of the virtues of God and the things of God then the Holy Spirit comes down and seals us into the kingdom don't you worry everybody will know you got it you won't have to say well glory to God I know I got it I spoke in tongues you don't have to say a word glory to God I danced in the spirit once he says you don't have to say a word about it everybody will know you got it don't you worry it'll testify for itself he'll let it be known among men so you see brother sister we just have to be willing to surrender and give it to the Lord now in in let me get back here to my definitions now I read here in John 16 in text and the Bible uses these words Lament anguish travail and I want to take these definitions the word Lament it means to mourn to grieve to weep or wail so you see brother there's no such thing as a dry eye dying out you're not going to get this by shaking the preacher's hand it's going to take some dying and that's the part we don't like to mourn to grieve to weep or wail to express sorrow to regret deeply anguish extreme pain look at the title birth pains our dear mother is in the building tonight Little Junior that brought so much joy to your home came with pain you know what's amazing about that process it's not a 10-minute deal it's more than 15 minutes at the altar all right and brother when them contractions come think about what that dear Mother to be goes through sick in her body all kinds of symptoms and sorrow that goes along with it and us guys I remember when my little son this he'll be 42 this year and my dear wife sister Tina she now personally for me now I'm old but I'm I'm really I am old school because I thought that it would have been ideal for me to be back like in the father's knows best ERA and be able to wait in a little room with the other dads until they Wheel junior in he's all cleaned up wrapped up a beanie on him he's got his name marked on the little bassinet and they put him in the room with a window and I could say oh that's mine but sister Willard had a different idea on that she said no you're partially responsible you're coming with me so we took them classes I don't know if they still have them or not but they teach you how to breathe they figure it out on improved way to make the birth easy and they show their little films they teach you how to breathe my wife and I we were breathing machines I could have taught the class I was such a good breather but when them contractions come and brother that little sweet little thing you married she lets you know them Pains start and so we get to the hospital and you know what's I love about the hospital they have a special Ward for births return they don't send you just anywhere and brother I feel like the church ought to be that this ought to be a birthing room it's ought to be a Maternity Ward we ought to be trained you might have got the Holy Ghost 40 years ago but brother we've got a sacred charge and that's to come to the house of God With a Purpose on purpose and that's to do everything we can to create an atmosphere that our children a sinner folk can come through and get the same experience you've got [Applause] [Music] yes sir you go in there I remember we went in and of course after the first little one you know the program but when you're in there for the first time and you walk in and all you hear from down the corridor is a blood curdling scream they did not show that on the film because that's a real birth if it's in a hospital or a pink Decker or a barnyard it's a mess brother if you search this message the 1200 or so messages we have you will find the number one word that brother Benham used to describe the new birth was the word mess look the word up it means out of order it means disorderly Wonder we're called the message the message whether it's not how long you've been in the message how long's it been in you it only gets in there by a new birth English extreme pain you know what's amazing about the birth process is the pains don't get easier they get more intense and the contractions get longer not shorter you know the prophet of God said about the New Birth he said we want a classic he classical way we'll go where they don't shout and boohoo and pound on an altar you want to be too human that's what he said he says you're not willing to skip a few meals oh there's always some when I make that statement a few of you Brothers eyes get big especially at home skip a few meals huh what's that well how bad do you want it yes [Applause] it means eternity joining Church ain't gonna get you there shaking the preacher's hand ain't gonna get you there you know what the prophet of God said he said we've gotten to a place where we're just concerned about getting people to our church instead of to Christ now brother if they can get to Christ in your church wonderful but that's the main thing is to get to Christ you know what brother banham said it matters who teaches you he put picking the church you attend on the same parallel as your spouse he said there's something to it he said not what's sociable but true Bible teaching I feel like I'm preaching to the right crowd but brother those pains get worse not easier he says we ain't willing to skip a few meals he said we're we won't stay at the altar more than 10 or 15 minutes well brother sister how bad do we want it it should be our Focus here recently at home I did a little uh opportunity and a little questions and answers for the teenage group and one of the most amazing questions and I'm not making light of any question I'm not making fun of the question but one of the questions I got was many of us are worried about whether we've been born again well brother sister first of all I don't believe in worry because brother it's based on fear now to be concerned yes we should be but brother what are we doing about it if you're concerned or worried about the Holy Ghost what are you doing about getting it I just read the definition of birth is the act of bringing forth we're to show Meats of repentance we should be doing what the prophet of God brother just sometime punch in the Holy Ghost and the word altar and see how many times they're used in conjunction even in the tent Vision which is a future event brother Branham has just made an altar call all right and there's still a prayer line anguish extreme pain listen to this now agony to distress with extreme pain deeply distressed see brother sister we don't want that but God's got a provided way and brother you've got to come his way we want everything instant everything easy that don't come that way brother bam says we want shortcuts there is no shortcut to the new birth you've got to meet God's requirement for it travail okay to labor with pain severe toil toil to strive to strain prepare to work with efforts of some duration I've been told over the years well I went to The Altar and I didn't get anything so go back you can't make God's word lie brother Madam said God obligates himself to his word he said if he failed to bring his word to pass he'd have to stop being God and that's not possible God obligates he's obligated brother man said that he said brother we've got a promise of the Holy Ghost we've got brother your Bible says that as the bride of Christ we've been predestinated now I love this because you know God just took it all the way to the finish so that you and I wouldn't have to worry about it he didn't say you were predestinated to a birth or a Sanctified life he said you were predestinated to your adoption that's the finished work so brother you're predestinated to it now we just have to catch up to what we've been predestinated to you've got to act out what God foresaw you would do with the word the putting your name in the Lamb's Book of Life brother I believe it's an hour that we should be getting busy with God's Redemptive plan not just say God sent a prophet and go to church way more than that to a Christian walk with efforts of some duration to strive to make efforts make efforts really brother sister if you're seeking the Holy Ghost and I love the fact that brother Israel has an old-fashioned altar bench he's not managed to put that in the basement brother this thing wasn't designed for flowers that was Cain's offering it was designed for us we're supposed to be the offering we're the sacrifice [Applause] I see a Kleenex box brother Benham talked about let me read it to you watch watch okay now this is late 65 if there's anybody hung up on something said before 63. now I'm not it doesn't matter my Prophet prophet's quote book was written two thousand years before 63. [Applause] and this is God's absolute unadulterated word of God [Applause] just cleared that up so this is late 65. invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother Madam says and if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something she's got the mother something it's nature but to Bear a child for her husband raise it to the service of God it's entirely out of her line oh she'd be so disgraced if she did by her sin love and Society of the 1965 type of woman rather look at it's almost 60 years later look at the conditions today a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking Acts 2 38 youngins around her yeah yeah see yeah she don't want any of them whooping what whooping I want to let you in here on a little secret a little head nod with an amen that's not whooping you're gonna oh you're gonna give me the head nod give me an old-fashioned fascist please [Applause] he says Acts 2 38. oh look what he's okay okay I'm jumping ahead here any other he don't want they don't want any of them hooping crying screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination sure will right amongst us brother if you want to see the Judas is scary Spirit that's living right amongst us preach an old-fashioned sin killing sky blue Pentecostal blessing experience and watch old Judas show his color [Music] I got permission to go ahead God bless you I would have anyway because it's too late for me yeah I've had it both ways I like it beggar like this yes sir just pray for me look she don't want any of them hoop and crying screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would have put her immediately out of her denomination if they had one like that in one of the churches why'd they'd throw her outright quick why are you letting such as this go along oh yes brother he says so you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belongs to here they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnated with the word brother I want to be pregnanted with the unadulterated word look because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth Amen brother ain't no wither room in this now brother sister look I've been in this way a long time like many of you have and I know what brother Benham said that we're Beyond Pentecost I know the quotes the word that fell at Pentecost won't work today that's right well brother sister look he said we're in the bride age we've come out of laodicea yes we have and brother sister certainly we've got way more word than what they had at Azusa way more but brother sister were never Beyond The Experience brother we're 400 years Beyond Luther's age but brother what Luther preached is just as true today that the just shall live by faith as it was 400 years ago we still believe in justification we still believe in the truth of the age that Luther preached it in we're Beyond it but we believe it if you didn't believe in justification none of you would be saved thank you [Music] and the next dispensation under Wesley was sanctification I trust we still believe in that he taught without Holiness you'll not see God don't fill an unclean vessel you remember brother Branham brought what completes a birth there's three things one is justification second sanctification third is the life the birth the Holy Ghost he took the analogy you find a glass in your yard and it's dirty yet it's a good glass you paid for it it still got value it can still be used so you pick it up well you don't use it in that condition it's got to be clean that's where sister Willard and I have a little difference at home I've got a coffee cup I'm the one that uses it so I feel like I make sure she's not looking I can just rinse it out and put it back that's not the Gospel According to Saint Tina no it needs to go in the dishwasher and get washed right what's wrong well brother God has a provided way he's not going to fill over the top of the filth of the world that you're living in oh that's got to die out brother and the Holy Ghost will burn it out of you see brother sister look God when he sanctifies you he takes the desire brother he changes your appetite amen that's the problem today we just want the benefits of a new birth but still dabble out in the world it don't work that way brother sister you might come in as I said earlier to an Old-Fashioned Holy Ghost meeting and feel the anointings of God that's wonderful but brother it's going to go deeper than that You Gotta Die you know what he said not only die he said rot like an old potato I don't know has anybody ever opened up the pantry and look down in there and your your potatoes have grown tentacles have you ever seen that to have one of them go rotten no my wife ain't never burned in our house a rotten potato candle that's not part of aromatherapy I might smell like an apple pie or something but never a rotten potato because it stinks and brother that's how the world's got to get to us if you expect to truly be born again you're going to have to die out to that old stinking nature [Applause] okay you thought I was done with this quote but I'm not he says you've been pregnated with something because she's bringing forth members of all time but they don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering brother look at the words he used that he tied into a new birth there ain't one single word that's classical not one of them every one of these words is a mess but you know you can act this way at a ball game we're just one of the fans isn't it amazing how the Devil Makes the ball game Lively and church is dead as a doornail that's true I'm telling you right now shouting didn't begin in a ball game it was before the foundations of the world sons of God shouted [Applause] brother if you get happier at a ball game you do in the house of God something's wrong with your walk and brother Benham called them folks Unholy rollers it's on the tape if we're Holy Rollers them are Unholy and brother Jesus did way more than a home run yes you and me brother he he saved our souls we're headed to Hell a thousand miles an hour and he said oh the father hath given me will come to me and I'll not lose one of them brother he interrupted your life who didn't look for him he was looking for you not you Adam where are you [Applause] turned you around save your sinful soul gave you a book full of blessings and an eternal life out in front of you that's worthy of a praise that's worthy of a shock three years [Applause] since when do we go by feelings anyhow do the battle you'd be in in this late hour every devil inhales against this teacher so he tells us offer unto me the sacrifice of praise that means you didn't feel like it man if you came down the road getting here singing and worshiping in your car only got one hand maybe you're steering with your knee because your hands are in the air worshiping God whether it wouldn't be no sacrifice [Music] but it's when you don't feel like it it's when the symptoms are raging it's when the discouragement had been piled on you it's when the devil's telling you you there ain't no way you're just kidding yourself that you think you can be bride of Christ it's when then take God at his word amen God looks and honors faith you don't go by feeling but brother it's what's motivating you I'm gonna go to church anyway brother man said I don't care if you have to hobble that's on the tape hobble you know brother you've heard the message brother Bannon preached digging the valley full of ditches he preached it right there in Phoenix and he talked about you know the story Elisha out of sorts sees Jehoshaphat ahab's son son and he wouldn't even speak there in the presence of ahab's son except for the righteous man Jehoshaphat brother Benham said his temper got the best of him he was out of sorts so he called for someone to play he called for timbrel and so when he got in the spirit he prophesied saw vision and he said dig the valley full of ditches brem says it wasn't some soft pliable soil it was like out here in Phoenix it was a dried up old hard pan desert but the deeper you dig the more water you're going to get it's what he said on the tape so brother sister there ain't nobody here one of the reasons we stayed in school and found a different vocation because maybe you did dig some ditches nobody really says I can't wait for my career path I'm going to be an expert ditch digger it's hard work it's labor it's brutal well brother sounds like a process of a birth the process of dying it's a dying process and this is what he said on the tape he says when you're digging and you run into that teapot dig it out and then he started giving names to the things you run into one of them was tiredness it's what he said on the tape brother really really is there anybody here that is not tired I'd like to shake your hand after church I'd like to actually know someone that isn't tired I wake up tired and I go to bed more tired tired's a way of life I'm up here tonight tired I don't feel it right now but I know I am but you put one foot in front of the other and you say I'm gonna offer a sacrifice of prayer I'm going to go to church and I'm going to pretend I'm not tired because I'm going to worship my God he's worthy to be worshiped I'm a child of his I'm a believer I'm going to act like what I'm not gonna sit back with my arms folded hoping somebody can entertain me I've come to get in the spirit yes [Applause] praise the Lord okay you want me to quit get quiet trust me there's only somebody that won't be quiet I got a brother at home I go to say that he's preach it brother take your time I know he gets glared at sits in the front so we can't see who's doing it born look what he says born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church joined Creed joined going bobbed hair painted-faced there's no such thing as that in it all of it you don't find that in the word of God you find an old-fashioned Sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting praising God [Applause] praise God [Applause] I never forget a brother I preached for in Africa years ago he was in some meetings I want to say there were some folks from North America in the meetings and one of the dear brothers in the message over there in Africa told the brother who was African he said now the reason you folks act the way you do is because it's your culture and the dear Pastor said I beg to differ with you because I've been to I've seen one of your Super Bowls yeah you talk about Maniacs you talk about crazy you ever seen them guys like in Green Bay in the middle of winter and they ain't got no shirt and they painted their body the color of the team the great big old bellies they don't even care that they're showing them things because they're a football fan they're supporting the team and all that team does is score six points or two points or an extra point well brother and they get we got a picture there we show on our screen at church brother Vic found it and I love it because it's one of those pictures in the middle of winter and all them uh Packer fans whoever they are in that country that they think we're crazy for living in Arizona no no no you talk about so cold that your lungs will freeze you gotta plug the car in so it'll start they show them folks out there in the stadium covered up covered in snow and the caption underneath this and you can't go to church brother if the devil can have fans that go out in that kind of weather how about God's fans be dedicated to him [Applause] praise the Lord he's worthy to be praised the Bible says show the Praises of God okay I don't even know brother Israel oh my no my time's up I got the pastor's okay so you take it up with him that's what I love brother Israel about a little Evangelistic effort because I can come here and I just go straight home and brother Israel has to fix it praise God let me read something to you and then I'll pull over don't you love the word of God it's got the devil's answer brother sister you can leave this meeting with a new birth you can leave this meeting adding a virtue because you're birthed into each one of them brother there's not one of us here that doesn't need more of God The Man Behind the pulpit tonight needs more of God maybe you've got the Holy Ghost years ago but how's your lamp doing you know the prophet of God said late in his ministry it's lamp Trim in time even the wise virgin fell asleep in Matthew 25 and was woken up because the bridegroomed Terry they fell asleep too but at midnight there was a cry and even though she had extra oil even though she had the oil to stay topped off but brother sister she still had to trim her lamp a wick trimming time cleaning the globe getting ready for the coming of the Lord brother how many could use a refilling tonight maybe your clamps gotten a little low you could use a refill he's here tonight okay I'm I know I'm in amongst the right crowd tonight praise God brother let's quit making excuses and just take God at his word okay oh my let me I want to take this here brother Branham in the Patmos vision this is off the tape he's referring to Revelations chapter 1 verse 10 how that I John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and brother Madam said John was a type and the vision of the Bride of Jesus Christ he was a type of you and I he said for on Patmos in Vision God transmitted him through time as though he lived in our day and John says I was in the spirit brother Bannon Bears down on that I'm on page 96. he says all right now in the spirit on the Lord's Day now remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit man that's the first thing you come to the house of God the very first brother why do you think God ordained worship prior to the preaching of the word it was to create an atmosphere for the word it's not just a ritual there's a purpose behind it brother years ago back in the mid 80s thereabouts I come across an article I think it was at my father-in-law's house and he hadn't stack or had some National Geographics and one of the articles in the geographic magazine was entitled the wars Within and it was an extensive study on the immune system and as I began to read through it right away it caught my attention because it speaks of five cells that work in the immune system to keep your body alive to kill and drive out sickness that comes in because 24 7 your entire life there's all kinds of germs and bacterias viruses diseases trying to kill you so God equipped us with this a cellular response system to Keep Us Alive it's called the T cells okay I don't have time that's a whole different but brother sister every one of us here has dealt with symptoms otherwise Christ didn't need to be a Healer Remnant says Divine Healing was the bait on the hook to get folks hooked to the Gospel of Jesus Christ so brother sister if if we didn't have symptoms how could we be Overcomers Birmingham said don't sign for that box of snakes you know what he said on the tape he said as long as you are complaining about your symptoms God can't heal you how are we doing sure we get symptoms absolutely do our prophet got symptoms Jesus got symptoms [Music] that's so that God could display himself as a Healer Brandon says don't never let your uh testimony your confession be negative be positive he said don't you never say you're not saved he said say you're saved and one day you will be amen don't ever say that your faith is weak confess your faith is strong and then God will bring your faith to your confession he's the high priest of what our confession have you ever met somebody a dear brother or sister that you didn't even want to ask how they were doing because of the track record and by the time they get done with you know it's amazing how people can detail all the symptoms brother honestly they could win an Academy Award and putting such detail to all the symptoms and by the time they get done with you you've got a few you didn't even know we're there man you know I got that too have you ever read one of them articles do you have stress you know that's backed by some pharmaceutical that wants to put you in some mind-altering drug that has side effects to give you another drug to take care of the side effects from The Other Drug and I love they show that you know brother this age that you and I live in I ain't never seen such anxiety in my in fact when I grew up I don't think the word existed I don't know we just lived they got a name for everything you know that anxiety is actually one of the definitions under the word fear fear produces it never seen such that's what we got today anxieties panic attacks whether it's gotten to a place well the Bible says men's Hearts failing for fear but brother sister look all that Death Angel all that was going on darkness in Egypt but there was light in Goshen brother we don't have to drink that Kool-Aid we take God's word we've got a safe place we've got a hiding place we've got a Goshen and that's God's promised word thank you yes thank you Lord amen they showed that little butterfly you ever seen the commercial or seen the advertisement they got someone in a field smiling with a butterfly this is how this is going to make you feel well brother what you really need is a good dose of the Holy Ghost brother Ben and preached the message letting off the pressure you know how the pressure brother the Holy Ghost will take care of it that's why we're here tonight we're here because we want to be you know people see us they see you you're always going to church you know all you do is go to church everything's church church don't you know how to have a good time come to church with me come on come and see the joy of the Lord is our strength mother the devil didn't Rob David of his salvation he just robbed him of the joy of it we spoke this morning brother Caleb's on the first love and it says to love you once had for them old-fashioned Holy Ghost meetings he said you left it it didn't leave you we leave it he says and you begin to slide slip it's just gradual slip into the formal the Bible brother and brother Bannon brought it he says God hated the formal d of the Nicolaitans he says and so does his church hated it now brother God doesn't like a lot of things but I don't know in serving him I would think it would be wisdom to focus on the things first that he hates okay if we're going to get busy serving God let's take a look at what God hates let's get those out of the way and then we can work on the rest of that he hates formal religion he said formal religion is no different than Catholicism Look up the word formal in the Webster dictionary you know what the word means stiffly the base meaning of formal is stiffly stiff stiff it means unbendable unyielding stubborn stiff neck bro that means you can't even get a head nod out of them they're next to sniff to nod their head brother what do they call a dead person what do they call them a stiff why they're dead there's no life in them they're not moving because why they're dead stiff brother I'm gonna let you in on something here if the Deacon board back here watching you for a two or three hour service can replace you next Sunday with a mannequin you're formal there's no wiggle room around it you just face the fact I'm formal I need to change the way I am because God hates formalism [Music] brother I don't care if I don't feel like it or not I'm still going to clap I'm gonna Pat my foot I'm gonna offer to him the sacrifices of Praise because he's worthy of it you know what God does to a sacrifice that's based on the word of God and its efforts he consumes it and then after a while you feel like brother we just got to take God at his word know what we're doing know why we come here amen [Music] amen amen amen in this statement oh brother Israel brother you can see why I hold the Malachi 4 record of the most one-time invites I had a dear friend of mine tell me a pastor friend what an encouragement I felt very encouraged when I hung up the phone honestly I got invited one time it was down here a dear brother invited me said brother Bob we haven't had you for a while we've got a lot of new folks in the church and we felt like to thin out the crowd well that's nice I get invited to thin out the crowd brother I believe this message brother it's it's changed my life if we'll just take what he said I don't have to change it alter it twist it just take what he said you know it's the Bible how could a Vindicated Prophet preach anything other than the Bible and brother for the life I mean how in the world can somebody unvindicated talk you out of a Vindicated prophet it don't even make sense [Applause] okay I don't care what website it is okay I'm gonna rain it in a little bit okay praise God brother Benham says referring to Revelations 1 10. okay in the spirit the Lord's day remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit the very first thing the very first thing you got to get in the spirit we come to the house of God we come here to get in the spirit okay here's what he says about it he says get in the spirit house these Revelations ever going to come to you get in the spirit amen amen how are you ever going to get the Holy Ghost get in the spirit say brother sister you don't get the Holy Ghost and then get in the spirit you can but in order to get the Holy Ghost you first got to get in the spirit sit back there all folded up bless God ain't gonna have no song leader tell me to raise my hands I'll do it when I the spirit moves me I'm going to give you just the inside little information the spirit ain't gonna move you at all not with that kind of a demon Spirit got you all bound up you've got to be willing to let God have his way sit there like you sucked on a lemon the prophet said we ought to be the happiest people in the face of the Earth [Music] [Applause] want the church all folded up oh put him in a raffle and win a new Ford F-150 man all kinds of emotions put them at a bowl game with Junior yeah put Little Junior bottom of the ninth inning two outs you're down by three runs you got three men on your team on base and your little Junior hits the Grand Slam walk-off you can take the most reserved couple you can take the dear sister with bobby pins everywhere here's perfect and let little Junior hit the Grand Slam walk-off bobby pins are flying dad's got his thumbs under his chest That's my boy yep I taught him everything he knows chip off the block well brother we do that because he's family right yes he's family he's my heavenly father he's my brother my mother my lawyer my doctor he's everything brother way more than a home run [Applause] see it ain't so hard to praise him you be careful now you might find yourself shouting you might find yourself standing up going what am I doing Francis it'll make you do things you didn't think you'd do look what he says now when you as a sinner okay I'm talking to everybody Even If you deny it every one of us a sinner born in sin Shake come to the word of speaking lies every one of us need a new birth every one of us need a savior sinner okay brother man gives us an analogy he says when you was a sinner you went to the dance you've gotten that spirit I love to see oh you press the sister with the fans could someone turn one this way God bless you you're showing yourself a rugged Christian I was down in Nogales last week pulled up the big building for these meetings and didn't have no windows and the car said 111 as we went in I said oh I hope when I get home nobody complains the church is too warm brother I sweated my tie down to where it was Dripping the top of my trousers changed colors if I just hope trust that the man that invented air conditioning makes heaven I'm going to look him up and shake his hand thank the Lord when you was a sinner you went to the dance and you got a Nets now whenever I read this quote there's always somebody out there that gets real happy and they seem too happy about how then they used to act as a sinner I always get that you know oh we're heading on or a big smile or a little chuckle because they remember how they acted they probably wore the lampshade come to the house of God like a wart on a pickle okay when you was a sinner you went to the dance you got in that Spirit you started Clapping Your Hands and patting your feet and shin digging I love the fact my Prophet used the word Shin digging that means your shin was digging that's a shin dig Shin digging you got in the spirit of it look what he says he says you went to Shin digging throwed your hat on the floor going around and around acting silly acting silly there wasn't one of us that driving to church with honey next to us sitting next to you and go honey can't wait to get to the house of God so we can act silly but it'll make you do things you didn't think you'd do I'll tell you one thing bro it take the starch out of your collar it'll take care of that formal Spirit oh bound up yes sir hey man it'll make you pliable throwing your hat in the ground running around acting silly you was in the spirit of it could you imagine a fella or is that it he was a dance fiend go and do a dance say well you all are having a pretty good time I suppose oh they'd say you Wallflower get out of here brother I don't want to be no message Wallflower I want to get in the spirit [Music] I mentioned a moment ago in that immune system article every one of us in battling symptoms have had a fever did you know that it's not actually the virus that causes the fever it's the immune response the macrophage has a direct connection with the intelligence your brain and it notices identifies and discerns that there's a virus infected the body and the immune response those cells cannot respond in a normal body temperature to an enemy so it tells the brain heat up the body that's what we do when we come to the house of God that's why we worship before your killer tea comes out of the back room is you're raising the temperature in the building the spiritual thermometer so that the enemy can be cast out that's why we worship God amen okay brother I tell you I'm trying to pull over I'm sincere to pull over to try to stop you know at home I got a little granddaughter she bothers she's just my
