His love is so great. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we come before you tonight, Lord. We approach you, Lord, with all sincerity and our hearts to you, Lord, asking for your leadership, Father, &gt;&gt; for the anointing, &gt;&gt; for for instructions from heaven. that we want to hear from you, Lord. Not to hear from a man or for some carnal avenue, Lord, but to hear from you is our prayer. And Father, just take the few moments that's set aside for that and move right into the word, Lord, and speak to our hearts, we pray. Lord, we have no ability of our own. Without you, we can do nothing. So we trust and depend on you tonight. Asking for your favors. Bless every heart that's gathered, Lord. The youngest ones, the older ones. Each one may receive their portion tonight. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you. So good to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight. Amen. So we welcome each of you, our visitors, our friends. Good to see each of you. Welcome. Have brother Jonathan here with us tonight. We look forward to having to see what the Lord has for him to say to the church here on this weekend. So, be in prayer for that service. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before we um go into the um prayer meeting, we'd like to take a a few moments to go into the word of the Lord. I have two places in the scripture. Um, brother Joe, those the notes with the prayer requests, I left them on my desk faithfully. Always do that. So, in Acts 1 and8 and also in Luke chapter 22, it's old song. We used to sing, "Can't nobody do me like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can't nobody do me like the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's my friend." Amen. &gt;&gt; What a friend we have in Jesus. Amen. Acts 1 verse number 8. But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. Amen. So we'll take one more scripture in Luke chapter 22. In verse number 15, this is a kind of the a communion. This is our Lord getting ready to give his life at Calvary. And he said unto them, with desire, I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I say unto you, I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And he took the cup and he gave thanks and said, take this and divide it among yourselves. And let's go down just a little bit in verse number 23. And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was should do this thing. And there was also strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so. But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitth that meat, or he that serveth? Is not he that siteth that meat? But I am among you as he that serveth. Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father hath appointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my table where &gt;&gt; in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel. Now, uh the prophet of God on Sunday, we shared a few places with you on this great thought of the millennium and the millennial reign. How many thank the Lord for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that we are headed to that place where we will reign with Christ for a thousand years. Um it's spoken of throughout the scriptures in Isaiah, Ezekiel and many of the scriptures and Jesus refers to it many times in many parables. But this thousand year that millennium millennial is in revelation chapter 20 is where that is uh more spoke of. But tonight um we'll read a few of those notes from Sunday morning Sunday school and u we trust that this word will be a blessing to you. Let us pray. Father bless your word and bless your people. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Thank you. So, this millennium is a thousand-year reign where the saints of God will reign with Christ for a thousand years. That's here on the earth. That's where we go before we go to heaven. Amen. And in Revelations 20, it tells us in verse 7, "And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth. Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea." So, you know, as we uh go forward in this thought of the millennium, the millennial reign and uh the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God, what this subject does, brother Kurt, it it encourages more questions than answers. &gt;&gt; And so, it's beautiful, but they're good questions. They're questions of the future. And they asked brother Brandon of the question, will there be children born in the millennium? And he said he wondered about that himself. It kind of looks like it is kind of like like looks like it isn't. And in this reign and in this um governing of cities and towns and building and planting where Satan is bound not with the log chain but with the chain of circumstance, there will be no sin ruling and reigning. &gt;&gt; But the sons and daughters of God will have something to reign over and people to reign over. One of the some of the great theologians believe that these people that Satan finally gathers from the four corners of the earth are the redeemed children, the saints who had children during this thousand years will have children and not all of them will be saved. And so these are the subjects that we reign over and these are the ones that will rebel in the final end. We know at the end of the millennium there'll be another. Of course, there's no sin during the millennium, but um it's still not heaven. And we're still um working, eating, planting, building, and so forth. And brother Brown makes this statement on the millennium about some of the people that we'll be ruling and reigning over. And it's just one little place. I haven't seen any other place where he talked about it in depth, but he says it here in the message Questions and Answers 1962, paragraph 178. And then at the return of the church and the bride, the bride in Christ shall walk out upon the ashes in the millennium when the earth is purified by fire. And there they shall reign, and the heathens that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time. And the sons of God will be manifested. If he's to reign, he's got to have something to reign over. &gt;&gt; He's got a domain. And they ruled and reigned with Christ. Christ ruled with the rod of iron, the nations. Then the manifested sons of God with authority just like he had when he was here. See, there will come the millennium in that reign. See, upon the ash ashes. So I have watched for something. Has it slipped by us in humility and we've missed it? Is it gone and the church is left in our sins? If that be so, then it's later than you think. If not, then there's coming one with a message that's straight on the Bible. A quick work will circle the earth. You know what I love about brother Brandham with all of the experiences he's had with the Lord, personal experiences and him knowing who he was and the great signs, wonders, and miracles in his life, even going beyond the curtain of time, he still always possessed this attitude. Could it be that we miss something? &gt;&gt; And he's always, Lord, please help us to go closer to you. It's never this setback. I've already made it. &gt;&gt; It's never he he doesn't possess that attitude. And if anyone could, you would maybe say he could. But this this heathen being raised, it it it just makes it brings more questions &gt;&gt; because there is no sin, but the saints are ruling and reigning for a thousand years. And I just want you to put that in your mind. You know, before the flood, men would live 900 years, 700 years, 800 years. After the flood, the lifespan of a man dropped down. 120 years is old man. &gt;&gt; And today, I don't know what the average age is, 80, 90, whatever. If you make a 100, that's pretty good. And so before the flood, the men had this long life and they were able to live almost one day. Not quite a day. And the millennium will be that one day that men will live on the earth for a thousand years. The earth will be fertile. It will produce. Brother Chuck, if you plant it, it will grow. and it will it will grow very well. In one scripture in Ezekiel, it talks about how the planting time and the harvest time will overlap. So while you're planting in one season, the or gathering in one season, the food from last year's crop is still remaining while you're still trying to plant for this year. It over it overtakes it in this fertility. It's beautiful, beautiful thought to think of that. building a house, planting a garden, inhabiting, and enjoying all the things that we enjoy. We read many of those quotes for you on Sunday. Now, the prophet of God makes this statement here in the resurrection of Lazarus, 1953, and he says, "He can't do nothing more for us than what he's already done." He makes this statement. He says, "I wish you'd do something for me." This is the attitude of people many times. Lord, I wish you do. God bless you, Kayen. See you. Lord, I wish you do something for me. But brother Bandom says, he can't do nothing no more for us than what he's already done. &gt;&gt; And I want you to let that lay in your mind for a moment. That everything that he's going to do or can do for you, he's already done. healing, power, blessings, whatever it is, is already been purchased. &gt;&gt; Now, the sons and daughters of God have to take that and move forward with &gt;&gt; what this was all about. &gt;&gt; Somebody died so that you can be free. Not halfway free, not part-time free. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about free all the time with all of the benefits. Amen. And all of the blessings that he has to offer. And brother Brandham has taken his time to show the church that we are living below our privileges. &gt;&gt; And he's the one who separated the Gentiles from the Jew as it pertains to laying on of hands and then receiving it by the spoken word. &gt;&gt; And he said the Gentiles faith should be a higher faith. we should receive it because the word says so. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um it's clear in these parables also that when Jesus is talking about faithfulness and he is given this parable in Luke 22 and in Luke chapter 11 and it's talking about being faithful over a little things and in Matthew he talks about being faithful over a few things. I'll make you a ruler over many. I want to take this one in Luke just for a moment. We did it before. I'll take it one more time. Luke 11 and verse number 15. And it came to pass that when he returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. Then came the first saying,"Lord, the pound, thy pound hath gained 10 pounds." And he said unto him, "Well, uh, well, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful and a very little, have thou authority over 10 cities." And the second came saying, Lord, thy pound gained five pounds. And he said, likewise to him be thou also over five cities. And so, you know, this is a a parable of being faithful over something very small, &gt;&gt; the the the the little details. You know, it's um you know, sometimes we we miss God because of the very fine little points. &gt;&gt; It's not the great big things. And what what this parable is showing that you know the little things actually are big things when it all runs its course. &gt;&gt; See when it when it comes to you it seems like a little thing. Well that's all you want me to do? Is that all you ask me to do? Is that all I can do? It's a little thing but he's watching your attitude over the little things. And here these men had one pound or five pounds, just a few dollars. And they doubled those few dollars. And then those few dollars turned into five cities. 10 cities. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "You've been faithful over this little thing, this little task, this little little monetary thing. You did what it took. I didn't hold your hand. You went out and you traded over here. and you traded over here and you ran through the investments and you counted the cost and you took the risk. You could have lost, but you took the risk and you sweated it out and you thought it through and maybe you prayed and you worked through all these little and it's just a few dollars. It's just a few dollars. And in somebody's eyes, it's just a few dollars. But wait, it's the Lord's few dollars. &gt;&gt; He's the one who placed that in your hands. And any shepherd could just any kind of sheep. Any kind of sheep. But David had his father's sheep. And it looks like just a few little stinking sheep. You You're not going to get your name in the paper over these sheep. You're not We're not You don't We don't give out awards for faithful shepherds. &gt;&gt; There is no faithful shepherd's award ceremony. You know, if you hear about a shepherd in the newspaper, you probably did something bad. something bad happens because faithfulness you we don't we don't broadcast that all the time. &gt;&gt; Faithfulness is quiet. &gt;&gt; It's like you don't you don't know you don't know a problem. I if if we do highlight you, it's because there probably was a problem. And here's David's attitude over It's Wednesday night. I'm supposed to be up here. &gt;&gt; Here's David's attitude over his father's sheep. He's just a shepherd. He's got his father's sheep. He's all by himself. There's no lights. There is no, you know, crowns. You're not going to get a trophy. You're not going to win at the end of the month. We're not going to put you in front of the crowd and appreciate how great of a shepherd you were. But the Lord put David over those few sheep. And his attitude over those sheep was so much deeper. &gt;&gt; Now, if I drove by, you drove by, you just say, "Oh, a little shepherd out there." But no, in the kingdom of God, he's watching David. And when the lion came to take those sheep, he put his life on the line &gt;&gt; to save a stinking, dirty, noame sheep. A sheep don't have a name probably. If I was David's daddy, I say, "David, man, don't you put your life on the line for one of them sheep. I can lose one of them, but I can't lose you." &gt;&gt; You see, but faithfulness, it looks at the task. It looks at the responsibility and it takes it serious. Even though the sheep have no value, even though maybe this position has no value, but the responsibility &gt;&gt; is of great value &gt;&gt; because your father put you in charge over it and your attitude towards it means something great. And we see that with many characters in the Bible, don't we? &gt;&gt; We see that with Abraham. how Abraham treated Lot, an undeserving nephew. &gt;&gt; Look at Joseph the way he handled his father's business by giving him report of his brothers even though that causes friction and with the siblings but the father told him give me a report and that's what he did and he was loved and he he gave his father report and it cost him almost cost him his life. What about Job? What about Job being faithful over sacrificing for his children? &gt;&gt; It looks like a nothing, but it's a something. &gt;&gt; What about What about a prayer? What about your little faithfulness to the no name position? &gt;&gt; Huh? Now, this faithfulness be put to the test. And Jesus is given this parable and he's showing us this that faithfulness over a few things equals rulership over many things. So you're faithful over a few things. I'll make you ruler over many things. And that's a nice one. you're faithful over a few things. I'm going to make you ruler. So, so, so they handled the money. They they they they multiplied it. And so, what did the Lord reward them with? Uh a a payment where they didn't have to work again? No. He rewards them with more responsibility. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. But with more responsibility, there's more victories. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can do it here, you can do it over here. If you can't do it over here, promise. I promise you, you can't do it if I give you more. &gt;&gt; I promise I'll be more faithful if you pay me more. &gt;&gt; How many knows that employee? &gt;&gt; How many was that employee? You show up, I want to get paid more. Well, work here for a month, work here for two months, for three months, and then maybe we'll think about, no, no, no. I want I value myself greater than that. Well, that's great. You value yourself greater than that. But I don't know. You uh show yourself &gt;&gt; like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Repeat. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, th repeat. Are you going to appreciate me today? No appreciations today. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be here. That's the contract. That's faithfulness. That's what it is. And many of us want the promise of greater things and more things. We're not even faithful in the few things. What are the few things that God has placed us in charge? Great. They're really great things. this um ruling and reigning in the in the millennium where the Jews will judge over the 12 their the 12 tribes and where the manifestation of the sons of God will come into a great uh fulfillment. Now, this manifestation of the sons of God, as I read that for you, he says it here again. Excuse me as a prophet deals with it here. So, in Jehovah Gyra 1961, he makes this statement here. And all the world is groaning, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. Waiting for the church to get back in its place again. &gt;&gt; Sons of God to be made manifest. Waiting for that hour. Hope that don't hurt, but I just had to say it. The church is so far away from its place. It needs to be back to be sons of God again. rulers, governors of the earth under the spiritual reign. It will be someday when the chief one comes, Jesus Christ, the great millennium. Nature is groaning for that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's showing this manifestation of the sons of God as a future event in the millennium. &gt;&gt; I read the first one here about in questions and answer when he'll raise up the heathens. He says that again, the manifestation of the sons of God as a future event, &gt;&gt; but it's not only a future event. There's a man manifestation of the sons of God before the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Random taught that to us. &gt;&gt; That's what the book, the adoption series was all about, the manifestation of the sons of God. Now, it's a lot of people know how to say amen to the future because it doesn't hold them responsible for right now. &gt;&gt; The future is not your future. If right now isn't right, &gt;&gt; you won't be in the future promise if you're not in the promise right now. What is the word of God to you right now? And I can tell you what it will be in your future. If you don't care now, you won't care then. If it's not important now, it won't be important then. If it's too little now, it won't be enough then &gt;&gt; because now is the time &gt;&gt; for you to take up this word &gt;&gt; and take it seriously. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? If science, what if this gentleman Eli Musk just simply lived off of what science had already done? What if his mind couldn't imagine greater and deeper depths in scientific achievement? What if that existed? What if what if what if the doctor the medical community stopped research? What if there was no no channel for research? I mean, they spend thousands, millions, millions of dollars just in research in some little office, some closed door. Some people you don't know about. You don't even know what they're researching. But they're constantly researching. Why? Because the medical advancements and they're learning. And they're finding out how atoms work and they're finding out how diseases and germs work. And I really am not interested in in learning how to remember anything of that. But I am dependent on the doctors to continue to do the research &gt;&gt; because when I show up and I get sick, I want the best that the medical community has to offer me. Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; I'm dependent on that, right? I expect I mean God have mercy on the civilization that their doctors aren't doing research that they aren't learning and continuing to learn. And we we're dependent on that, aren't we? &gt;&gt; That's not my responsibility to learn what the cutting edge on how to do surgery. That's not my responsibility. That's not who I am. But that is somebody's responsibility. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for the ones that are taking it serious. another medical breakthrough. We have a way that we can do this surgery and get it done precisely. Oh my, &gt;&gt; I'm interested in that, aren't you? &gt;&gt; And and and and all these other disciplines are saying, "But what about the church? &gt;&gt; What about the church? Isn't Isn't there a community somewhere that's depending on somebody that believes every word of this &gt;&gt; that is constantly doing research and research and research and going deeper into the power of God into the third pool into whatever God has for us. &gt;&gt; You don't stop your research. Now God have mercy on the soul. that stops researching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The doctor's children are depending the doctor's family members that need to be saved. They're depending on the church. That is our responsibility. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not by getting a college degree. It's not by getting some doctorate degree. Nothing against it. Learning Hebrew, Greek, or learning all those things. But it is about getting down on your knees &gt;&gt; and reading the text one more time and reading it with your hands raised and read it on your on your knees. Reading it so God can open up his word to you. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talk that's what I'm interested in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's unlimited. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; Is that what the prophet said? &gt;&gt; He said it's unlimited. Don't let me or anybody else put a limit on it &gt;&gt; put a limit on how you want to praise, how you want to study, how you want to worship. Don't put that limit on me &gt;&gt; and don't let me put it on you. &gt;&gt; It's unlimited. So that research, that going into it again, that searching and prayer to go into the privileges that the Lord has given us. &gt;&gt; He's trying to show us the authority that was given to the church. So, Brother Random is showing us those future sons. Is that right? Now we know in the millennium there's a quote where brother Random says there will be no scientific achievements over there. We won't need 5G over there or electricity. We won't need any scientific achievement. But um there will be one flag and that flag will be the old rugged cross. The heathens will be raised to hear the gospel. Those that didn't hear it before and they'll give be given the opportunity. That's what he said. That's what he said. I can't connect it. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; The he heathen will be raised &gt;&gt; and given the opportunity &gt;&gt; and he kind of lays out those order of events. And I like reading those out loud. And I want to read the order of events of what we have to look forward to. If I can do that quickly. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Questions and answers 1964. Brother Random says this, paragraph 75. Now, no, I wish I could have just have more time on that. See, the bride when she's taken from the church, then the church age will cease. Le Oysia goes into chaos. The bride goes to glory. And the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy. Then tribulation sets in upon Israel. Then comes the battle of Armageddon which destroys all things. &gt;&gt; Then the bride returns back with the groom for what? &gt;&gt; I'm interested in going &gt;&gt; for a thousand years. There's the millennial reign. After that comes the white throne judgment. After that comes the new heavens and the new earth and the new city coming down from God out of heaven. Eternity and time blends together. &gt;&gt; So this is the future. He didn't put it in other places. He put it puts in that battle of Gog and Magog at the end when Satan is loosed to go gather his subjects. So what is it that we receive as sons and daughters of God? I just showed you a couple of quotations showing that the manifestation of the sons of God is a future event. It's also the redemption of our body. This adoption and its fullness if you take the scriptures on it. But I like how the prophet brings this in 19 60 and here ye him he's talking about this manifestation of the sons of God and he really puts it uh to us right here very clearly. I love this. He says paragraph number 87. And now you see Jesus had proven to God that he had been the right kind of a son. And God took him up on top of the mountain, brought witnesses out there, heavenly witnesses and earthly witnesses. He clothed him in immortality. When they looked up, they said, "His garments shine like the sun. A supernatural something taken place. His garments garments glisten like the sun in the middle of the day, as white as they could be. God placed on him that robe of immortality, showing that he had received him. That's the thing that God will do to his sons here on earth someday. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll call you aside, church, if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it. He'll place into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He'll place it into the church. All the powers that Christ had in him will be in the church. &gt;&gt; And all that God was, he poured into Jesus. All that Jesus was, he pours into the church. God wanting his work done. He sent it into his son. The son wanting the work done. Sent it into the church. All and at that day you'll know that I am in the father, the father in me, I in you, you in me at that day because the same power of God was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ. The same power that rested in Jesus Christ rests in the placed sons in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Placing of a son, take him out a certain place. have a ceremony before the angels and place him positionally what he's what he is in the body of Christ, then that person has the authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you count me a fanatic from this night on, that very same thing that I'm speaking will be done. There'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the Holy Spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word &gt;&gt; and it'll create itself right there. &gt;&gt; We haven't seen powers like it's coming into the church now. I know it for a fact. &gt;&gt; Say unto this mountain, be moved. Don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you said shall come to pass. You can have what you said. The placing of the church in position &gt;&gt; where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes into the church. &gt;&gt; Then critics's mouths will be shut. &gt;&gt; It'll be a short time. &gt;&gt; Jesus come right off the mountain, went straight to Calvary. Notice it won't last long, &gt;&gt; but it'll be here. Now, now, now that's what the prophet said, &gt;&gt; and I believe that with all of my heart &gt;&gt; and whether or not the churches can grab it or the groups that I think they should be saying or should be doing that, that really has nothing to do with what I just read to you or what the prophet just said to all of us that this power is going to come and now is coming &gt;&gt; that sons and daughters of God will speak and it'll create. Here he is in 1960. He's saying that and he had already manifested that. &gt;&gt; And he was the first fruits, &gt;&gt; showing what a manifested son looks like. He was tested. &gt;&gt; He was tempted. He was tried. Remember they tested him in Vermont. Speak death to them. &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord told him, "Speak death. They'll pack him out of here." And he he didn't know what to do. He said, "I forgive you &gt;&gt; and Lord, that was the right thing." Yes, &gt;&gt; you got the power to do it, but you did the right thing with the power. &gt;&gt; Now I know I can give you more. You're faithful. You were faithful over this. Now I can give you this. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let me ask you a question here. Is there anywhere in your life you can be more faithful? &gt;&gt; You know, faithfulness is not an emotion. &gt;&gt; It's not something you feel. &gt;&gt; Let's get what faithfulness is. Can I read it to you just for a moment? Same thing with sincerity. the the the the angel of the Lord told the prophet, "You must be more sincere." &gt;&gt; H &gt;&gt; and um this the sincerity is the quality of being without pretense, free from deceit or hypocrisy. It's the quality of being genuine and honest in your thoughts, your feelings, and your actions. There's no put on about you. &gt;&gt; Are you sincere? I Is there some showmanship in my ministry? Am I up here trying to show out or am I really sincere? And the Lord told the prophet says if you'll be sincere &gt;&gt; then now you got to be sincere then there's more &gt;&gt; uh I you'll even know the thoughts of the heart. So you're here now you're pretty sincere but you can be more sincere. And if you're sincere then you'll it'll get to where you'll know the thoughts of the heart. Your ministry is right here now. But but if you be more sincere it's going to move up to here. Huh? &gt;&gt; Is what the angel of the Lord told him? Sincerity is not given. Sincer sincerity is something that's on you. &gt;&gt; Sincerity is a prayer. Lord, make me more sincere. &gt;&gt; Take out the pretense. Take out the f take out the showmanship. Take make it more sincere. Make it from my heart, &gt;&gt; from my soul, from my mind, my worship, and everything I'm doing. Make it more sincere, Lord. Amen. You came in here with a level of sincerity. You can leave out with a greater sincerity. &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong? Is that right? &gt;&gt; More sincere. And this was the the um that came to the prophet there. Faithfulness is not an emotion. Faithfulness is a character trait. &gt;&gt; It's a value that involves loyalty and commitment to someone or something. Faithfulness it it is um more consistent and enduring in quality. How many has a faithful friend? &gt;&gt; How many has some friends that you can go way back like to high school? &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of them. But if you got one or two, oh, you're pretty rich. &gt;&gt; If you got a friend from from your neighborhood that stuck it through through all your changes, you stuck through with all their changes and you guys are still friends. There's a that's that faithfulness is I mean you just don't see it everywhere. Not everybody's faithful. Not everybody's faithful. They're not loyal. They they'll they'll take your your your very uh sensitive subjects and spread it to everyone else. But a faithful friend, he holds that &gt;&gt; and he he covers you because he's a fa he's faithful. A faithful wife, a faithful spouse, a faithful friend, a faithful brother, somebody that you can put your confidence and and trust in and even share things with and they will protect you because they're faithful to you. &gt;&gt; And what about if you're faithful to the word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What about being faithful to him? &gt;&gt; Huh? Help us. &gt;&gt; Lord, make me more faithful. &gt;&gt; Can you know some of us we we all should be a witness? But are we a faithful witness? Do we take the opportunities where we should Lord make me a faithful witness, faithful minister, faithful Christian. Those are our prayers that we can we can attain to. And these are the qualities that our Lord highlighted amongst these disciples especially in giving out the talents. They didn't know it was just a test. I I you when you study it, I got to close here, but when you go deeper into this faithful over a few things and being ruler over many, then you'll see that your faithfulness right here, I'm talking about 2025 and how many more years you live in this age here, is definitely correlated to the rewards you receive in the millennium. Brother Bam says in several places, I wish I had time to do it where he talks about the day of rewards are coming &gt;&gt; where re rewards will be given out, &gt;&gt; you know, and and and some people they have taken just a terrible lot in life. Things horrible things happened to them. They it was out of their control. They were born a certain way. They were born in a certain situation. And they have taken that and and given their life to the Lord. And the Lord has taken that life and just exploded it with his blessings and his goodness. And then there's others who have so many opportunities, so many the silver spoon as they say that so many things just given to it and granted to them and handed to them and they let it fall by the wayside. And then you have but you have those ones that you know everything is a test. Everything is a trial. They're coming up the rough side of hard things. And when you talk to them, you don't see no ill effects of all of the foolishness that they've been through &gt;&gt; because they have allowed the Lord to take over in their life &gt;&gt; and they become a tremendous witness. &gt;&gt; You know, some Christians are so down. Everything is a complaint. Everything is a pain. Everything is hurting. Everything. My eyelashes are hurting. Everything is hurt. How are you doing? Oh, me. How you doing, my sister? Oh, do you really want to know? Like, I don't think I want to know. Like, stop. You're just supposed to say everything is fine. Say, all is well. &gt;&gt; And you know, you know, there is a there's a um it's connected. What you're doing here today is connected in that land to come. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; How many know that's true? &gt;&gt; The parables don't lie. The parables don't lie. I &gt;&gt; I wonder I wonder if pastors and leaders and Sunday school teachers will be given an opportunity to give their testimony of you. We we know you faithful because you told us, but let your peers testify of your faithfulness. I wonder what your peers would have to say about you. &gt;&gt; You know, your peers are testifying about you anyways, &gt;&gt; I've been talking about every one of y'all in here, &gt;&gt; but you never heard me talk about you though, have you? And you be talking about me too. Come on, tell the truth. Shame the devil. And you know this is definitely is definitely connected. You what what what we have today. Paul said whatever state I am, I learned to be content. &gt;&gt; And this mindset is that we're looking far beyond what's going on right now. far beyond the temporal things in this life. We're looking far beyond. And Jesus constantly pointed his disciples to this future. So what do we receive here? We receive the power, but not really power. It's authority &gt;&gt; to use the power is what it is. Now, brother Vandom takes this message here and he says that um he's talking about Elijah, how he used that power to curse those children and that wasn't the Holy Spirit. It wasn't the nature of the Holy Spirit. So, we can see where this prophet was given the power. He cursed those children and kings there. And he says it in at thy word. He he talks about it there. Uh let me just read it here quickly. My time is going. In um paragraph 7, at thy word, he says, "You remember that young prophet by the name of Elisha who was a successor of Elijah? He went ball he went baldheaded when he was just a young man. Some little children run behind him saying, "Oh baldhead, oh baldhead, why didn't you go up like Elijah?" And in doing so, it angered the that prophet. Maybe turning around he had bald no maybe a hair on his head. Turned around and looked. He knew it was right. The children was calling him bald head but it angered him and he put a curse on those children in the name of the Lord and two she bears come out of the woods and killed 42 little innocent children. Now anyone knows that's not the nature of the Holy Spirit. But it was angered. It was an angered prophet. See, you have to be careful. Examine every case. So, if we had that authority and that power, I you know, we would probably fail the test. We probably fail the test. Some of us, we would lose it. I I would probably fail the test. But I want to get to the place where I won't fail that test. &gt;&gt; Is that right, somebody? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where I don't get under pressure, where I just slip or I lose it. Amen. &gt;&gt; In a moment, I just lost it. I lost it. &gt;&gt; Well, let's get to the place where you don't lose it. &gt;&gt; And he he he was put under that pressure in that meeting and it said, "Speak death." And he passed the test. &gt;&gt; Now, in the message, Believe in God, prophet of God, says this here, paragraph 26, the other night there was people here. A woman couldn't speak. As soon as that evil power was challenged, she spoke normally. And there was a lady here had a big goer on her throat. I just walked up to her and said, "Satan, I just have the authority to break your power. You have to come off of her." I said, "He's gone." I said, "Do you believe that?" And she said, "Yes." So here the prophet of God is given this authority over the power of Satan. This is in the prayer line of course and we see him using this power. He's actually spoke to Satan and told him I have the power over you. I have the authority to move you off of this lady. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 52 and believing God. He continues. He says is that right? The Bible says they'll lay hands on the sick. they'll recover. Then when you start that, I've tried that and flash them through the line, lay hands on them, but if they if their life isn't combed through by the Holy Spirit to find out if there's anything in there, they don't feel they've been prayed for. Here's my secretary sitting here and things that knows gets the letters. Isn't that right? They just they're not. Now, there I'm up against something. I believe I want you to get this one here. I believe if I could maybe could preach, and I'm not much of a preacher, but if I can get the people to see that they've got to absolutely come clean with God, then I believe I'd have the authority by Jesus Christ, break the power of any demon there is. &gt;&gt; Very nice. The people can absolutely come clean with God. Any demon there is. Think about that. &gt;&gt; So, brother Bannon goes forward and tells us it's not our power, it's the authority. &gt;&gt; Christian verse Christianity versus idolatry. 1961 287. Now remember, each one of you has power in Christ. You don't have power. You have authority. Your authority. You're just exalted way above. Not to be exalt yourself up, but Christ has lifted you up. More Christ lifts you up, the further you want to be down. See, you'll feel so humble. So, how would he ever save a wretch like me? How did he ever do it? But he did it, and I'm so thankful for it. Amen. So good. the message inside. You say, "Brother Vandom, do you have power?" I wish I had power. We don't have power. We're not have power. We got authority. It's not a power. It's authority. We don't need power. Christ has the power, but we got the authority. Amen. There's a lot of difference. He was the one who conquered. He conquered and gave us the authority. He's got the power but we got the authority just like any ambassador going to another country. Yes. And that's what he has given us this authority but we are afraid to use it. We're afraid to use it. My last quote is that faith is a substance 1951. The musicians can come please. And the prophet of God says this here. But I can stand and pray for you until this time next year. It would never do you a bit of good until first you accept Jesus Christ as your healer. And if any of these ministers standing here would be standing in my place and you come and believe that God hears their prayer, you'd be healed just the same as if you would be if Jesus himself was standing here praying for you. &gt;&gt; That's a hard word, isn't it? But it's the truth. He gave all the power and authority that he had to his church and you're just afraid to act upon it. Now you believe that. So God help us to act upon that. Ruth caring for Naomi seemed like a small thing. Job sacrificing for his children, just a small thing. David over his father's sheep seems just a small thing. Abraham fighting for a nephew that really didn't deserve it. But God saw all that service and he blessed them. And God sees our service today. And God has given us the authority over every devil, every demon, every sickness. It's been given to the church of of the living God tonight. been given to us and it will continue to pour in more. Brother Banner makes a statement that um there will be no scientific achievements over there and that you know science they're using their great powers to to rule and reign. they they have their great achievements that they're doing and um but it's all going to come to an end one day. But all the power that God poured into his church will never come to an end. It's just an advance advance advancement and that's the way the way we'll live in the millennium and the great new home that we're going to. um this scient scientific achievements. They have really they they they they're able to you know they say the next the next wars will be fought by robots and and with this with satellites and so your next five-star general could be an IT guy or a girl. Nobody's on the boots on the ground fighting that way. It's all technical. all but all that's going to be done away with and the power that he's investing in his church today will ever remain &gt;&gt; and so we're gaining and we thank God for it. We see an great example in the life of our our brother Brandham and we want that to be our example. God bless you richly. Let's take these requests to the Lord that we have sister Barbara's as a request for her two brothers. They have two very serious health needs and we want to keep them in prayer.
