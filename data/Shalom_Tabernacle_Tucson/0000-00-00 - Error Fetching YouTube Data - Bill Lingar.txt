Um, tonight we want to remember the morning petitions of uh, sister Lori is having that procedure done that God would give her peace in her heart and knowing that everything's going to be okay. He's brought her this far. So, let's pray for her. Also, I want to pray for a brother that called me this morning and and I I know he's going through some deep issues. His name is David Ramanet. Let's pray that God would do something supernatural for him to Let's go. Let's go to prayer. Lord Jesus, thank you Lord for allowing us to be here. Lord God, I pray for your people, Lord. I pray for sister sisters are having the procedure, Lord, that you be with her. Give her peace in her heart that everything's going to be all right, Lord.

I know you did it for me, so I know you could do it for him, Lord God. Pray, Lord. Thank you, Lord. I love you, Lord. Lord, and then this morning, Lord, the message that you brought was Lord, we I don't want to miss your visitation, Lord God. It reminds me of the prophet saying that we're always praising God for what he did in the past, always praising him for the future, but we're ignoring what he's doing right now. In other words, we're missing his visitation. Oh Lord, I don't want to miss your visitation. Please help us, Lord God. I pray that I love you with all my heart. Oh God, I can't even hardly believe that you would call somebody like me, Lord God. I'm so thankful, Lord God.

There is a land and it's not a million miles away or on some far off and distant stream. I'll speed up and they'll slow down. There is a land. Oh, there is a land that I'm homesick for. Though I've never seen it before, I've got loved ones. They're waiting on that shore. There is a land. Thank the Lord. And it's not a million miles away or on some far off straight. I'll speed up and there's slow down. There is the land. And it's not a million miles away, Brother John. And not a million miles away. Or on some far off distant strain.

And so glad to have the gentle shepherd leading us. Amen. And uh he'll always lead us to the right place. Amen. And uh he'll lead us in his word. We have a good friend of ours, brother uh William Lingar, Brother Bill we call him, and he's a friend of mine for many years. and he's here in the Phoenix area and so he has made his way to be with us tonight and so we look forward to what the Lord has for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um just to go uh to encourage your hearts in prayer as I mentioned this morning the vision that I would like to see moving forward with the church to to keep those to you to keep those in prayer. We greet the saints in Mesa and we talked about the Sunday school, the music ministry, the recording ministry, that's all the sound video stream, all of those things, the missionary uh ministry, and the Spanish language, the Spanish people, and just that what that entails. And so, um, for the Sunday school, as we've done it before, we always play the tape of the prophet and typically a series and that's we call that our adult Sunday school and we like to focus on what the prophet is teaching us during that time and internalize that 15 or 20 minute segment so it can be a blessing to you &gt;&gt; and so at the end of those series we will come and teach uh that Sunday school lesson to bring those things together and so we'd like you to if you have questions during that time you get those notes, put those together and um bring those questions and so we can try to help the body of Christ with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The music ministry um all the musicians, song leaders, worship leaders, it is a ministry as serious as any other ministry that God would have. So me preaching or uh the brothers song leading um they're equal in the importance and the part that they have to play into a service. And so we want you to be in prayer. Look forward to that and the recording uh ministry, the streams, the videos and all of that. And our saints should be praying for those that are doing that. It's a sacrifice to work back there. I know it is because they can't really just relax and just go on screen saver mode. They have to be alert at all times watching the sound and what's going on, the lighting, whatever. And so it takes prayer. It takes the Holy Spirit. And since that is a part of our churches today, it's part of the ministry to help us serve the people of God better. Amen. They're not back there twiddling their thumbs. So they're back there in prayer, not passing notes, not on their phones, not streaming, just it's a ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like any other ministry, we want to move and look into that. The missionary uh ministry, witnessing to the lost and tracks, creating, making those tracks, going some kind of way outside of the walls of the church to be a witness. And that includes the little ministry we have in the Mesa area with Phoenix and the brothers there that do their work there. And I want to read this quotation for you. In 1956, 42256, paragraph number 20, the prophet of God says this, and I know you're right there. Every missionary is always right. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. That's general orders. So you're always right. And then the prophet says here in the word became flesh in the India trip report 1954 paragraph 20. And a minister gets in the same way when you're especially an apostle or well an apostle is a missionary. The word mission, aposto means one cent. And why the missionary wants to be called a missionary instead of an aposto order of it is is apostle. So then he sent out he's not exact he he's not exactly has to be a minister. Apostle don't have to be a minister. He just has to be one that sent. God sent him to do certain things. How we can say praise the Lord for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message here ye him he says this in 1956 and this is kind of just talking about the mi the music ministry the recording ministry the sound and and so forth. And um lastly we were talking about the Spanish going to the Spanish or that language here. Yehem 1956 he says this paragraph 16 now in this state many times Jesus never gathers with people just to be gathering Christ never did anything loosely and I think that's the trouble with the church today who take too many of the things of God loosely and I perceive that this is a Pentecostal gathering and listen you're my brothers and sisters but the Pentecostal people are too loosely with the gifts that's in the church and that's the reason God can't respect them. So you just let them go any old way. They should be governed and put in order. &gt;&gt; And that's our attitude. We want that's the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit in our hearts is to whatever we do, we do the best that we can as unto the Lord. Amen. So God bless you. Pray for those I didn't know there were five things. I counted them out. It just turned out to be five things. And if it was four things, I probably would have made it five or seven or something like that. But Sunday school, music ministry, recording ministry, missionary ministry, the Spanish language, and with the Sunday school, it's the adult Sunday school, but there's the smaller classes too for teaching and teachers and some of the young men and brothers. Um well, we want you to pray about those gifts that God maybe would have in your life in any of these areas. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So, as we uh stand to our feet and invite brother uh Bill to come, we'll sing the song Amazing Grace. Oh, how sweet that like me. I was lost, but now I'm found. smile. See, was his grace that taught my heart to fear and grace. My fears relieve. How gracious did that grace appear the hour I first believe. Praise God. Can you say praise God? Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Well, praise God. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God for saving us. &gt;&gt; Praise God for filling us with the Holy Spirit. Praise God for healing our prayers for the sick. Praise God for healing our prayers for our loved ones. &gt;&gt; Whatever this situation is, he promised he would be a present help &gt;&gt; in the time of need. &gt;&gt; And we praise him for all of these things. &gt;&gt; And we're so grateful that he found us &gt;&gt; and brought us back to the fold. So, I'm thankful to be here tonight. It's always a privilege to be with brother Israel, my friend, and to see what God has done in his life. &gt;&gt; Yes. And uh a changed life is a miracle, isn't it? &gt;&gt; That's that's a that's a true a true miracle. And so we pray tonight we'll say something that will encourage you and help uh your pastor in the work that he's doing to feed the flock and help you move forward in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So 1st Samuel 16 chapter 13 or verse 13 and 14. I want to start there and then I'm going to leave it and we'll come back to it and 1st Samuel 16 verse 13 and 14. And I got my timer on. All right. Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him. That was David in the midst of his brethren, and the spirit of the Lord came upon David &gt;&gt; from that day forward. &gt;&gt; So Samuel rose up and went to Rama. But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him. Heavenly Father, as we come tonight and as our brother read about the sacredness of just the gifts, whatever we do, Heavenly Father, may we do it with all of our heart. May we discern the body of the Lord of Jesus Christ. Whether it's a little finger or whatever part it is, it's all a part of Jesus Christ's body to to work together that he might accomplish his purpose in that church. And so to that we dedicate this service tonight in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. David is portraying perfectly Christ our shepherd. And how appropriate that last song was that our brother read sung the gentle shepherd. It fits exactly with my sermon tonight. Christ our shepherd. And we like we like those little things that he does for us, right? To let us know we've got the mind of the Lord and we're on the right path. That's right. &gt;&gt; And so we find here that David, he was the good shepherd because he put his life on the line for his father's sheep. And as the good shepherd here, Samuel the prophet who was the voice of God to that age, he anointed David the good shepherd with the horn of oil to become the chief shepherd, the king of Israel. And for David to become the chief shepherd, the king of Israel meant he was going to sit in the throne. &gt;&gt; He was going to wear the crown of glory. And so it's a type. He was going to exercise the supreme authority of his kingly position. And we know it's a type of this day where brother Brandham said we don't pray for it but command it. And so to command it that's the highest manifestation of God's authority and his power is the spoken creative word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that everything started by that, right? and all things were made by that and for him. &gt;&gt; And so listen to what the prophet of our age, God's vindicated voice said about David's anointing. And this is a quote from the great warrior David. Okay. Make sure I get this right. Yeah. All right. Well, I didn't put it I didn't put it there. So, let me go over here and It's so perfect that I don't want to quote it from memory. It's an outstanding quote. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's on me now. I have to quote it from memory and then you can go to that tape. this great warrior David. He said David was anointed for his kingly position right then. David was placed as king right then. &gt;&gt; And then he ti and then he quotes the scripture as well. All that he forneew he called. All that he called he's justified or anointed and glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so very significant statement anointed for his kingly position right then. And uh yet at the same time, King Saul is anointed of an evil spirit and it was permitted by God. And that evil spirit which was permitted by God because God let it come upon it. The spirit of God departed him and it came upon Saul. It was permitted by God. And what was it doing? It was resisting David's kingly commission. And it was opposing his fulfillment of what God anointed for. He was going to kill him to try to stop the fulfillment of it. Oh, there it is. Huh? Thank you so much. There it is. He and he says, "You are positionally placed in Christ Jesus as kings and priests." Is that right? The moment you receive the Holy Spirit, God places you in the kingdom and an heir. What a beautiful picture. There you are. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so, but there's a riddle here. And the riddle is though David was anointed for his kingly position right then, &gt;&gt; it was 15 years before he had his coronation ceremony. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Very significant. It was 15 years before he had his coronation ceremony. before he actually took the throne, wore the king, and exercised the power not to pray for it, but to command it. Because the king doesn't have to ask anybody. He's the supreme authority of the supreme power in the land. And that's what his throne and his crown and his scepter and what the king's sword enforces. And so, we'll hold that riddle right there. and God help us to come back to it. Now for my for for to take my subject Psalms 23:1 which we're very familiar with. But you know when the Holy Spirit gets in the word, he brings out things that we never thought of. &gt;&gt; So Psalms 23:1 says, "The Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; I shall not want." And my subject tonight is Christ our shepherd, the power to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When brother Israel reminded me of his anniversary services, he kind of told me, "You should have known that." You remember he reminded me of his anniversary services and the dedicational which was coming up and then later he sent me the announcement and I saw your theme was the power to become sons of God. And so just that right there kind of inspired me to consider what that power was and how that power comes. How is it manifested to us? Because if if you're if you have the right purpose in life, your purpose in life is to be a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you may have a different position on the way to that purpose, but if you're a son and daughter of God, you have the same purpose in life. &gt;&gt; Okay? And so, um, then Sunday morning, if you'll recall, he read some outstanding quotes on the power to become the sons of God. And I believe that one of them I'm going to read you now. It ties into our subject. And I believe it's absolutely critical for our spiritual understanding to see what and how that we are alive and remain will come to the manifestation of the sons of God in this age. We need to understand it. Okay? And that's why God has placed in the church the ministerial gifts. Watch. So that you be no more children and toss to and fro with what? Winds of doctrine. &gt;&gt; So we're we're here to be taught right like Timothy was of Paul, right? So that we can help you in these things. And so let me read this quote on on from adoption and this one I know I have. He says but in the fullness of time God sent in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance &gt;&gt; to be what? What inherits the sunship to be a son of God? Okay. Now, this word the sunship, it's only in this message of adoption that I find that he uses this term sunship. And so, we need to see how he explains it to us so that we can apply it the way he explained it to us. And now, this may just choke you to death. But did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods? &gt;&gt; How many ever know that? How many know that Jesus said so? The Bible said, "Did you're not did not your law say itself that you are gods?" And if you call them gods, which God said in Genesis 2 that they were gods, because they were had full domain over the dominion of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now today we don't have it but this message and ministry is to take us back to that. And no matter how much time goes by and how much a promise of God lingers, those who have that promise and anointed for that promise, they're going to wait for its fulfillment. So he says here he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his godship. He lost his sunship his domain and Satan took it over. So now Satan is the prince of the power of the air, right? And he controls the earth and he brings destruction. &gt;&gt; So we're waiting for the fullness of time. Now that's a key word. When the pyramid gets up to the up to the top, would this be the pyramid up to the top? &gt;&gt; And and that's another thing. You see, you have to connect what the scripture said and what the prophet is revealing with what's happening. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then the message takes on a new dimension and a new uh realm of of stimulation &gt;&gt; from the message. &gt;&gt; It's that quickening power that brings joy to my soul, Lord, that you would let me see this. &gt;&gt; So, we're waiting for the fullness time when the pyramid gets up to the top. There's the key. It has to be up to the top. It couldn't be in the dark ages. It wasn't in Luther's age. It wasn't in Pentecostal's age. It wasn't in me in in the last p. But it was at the top of the pyramid, which is why brother Brandham moved to Tucson to fulfill the vision and go into the wilderness to be anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. with the king's sword for a kingly ministry. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing to choke about. It's just a matter to say, "Lord, thank you. Help me to understand, Lord, what you're doing in this age." &gt;&gt; Because how much of the water do you want? The water is the type of the spirit. Do you want it up to your ankles or would you like it to your knees or would you like it to your waist or would you like it to be just the fullness of the spirit of God? &gt;&gt; That's the power of your redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the pyramid gets up to the top, when the full sons of God will be manifested, when the power of God will walk out, hallelujah, and take every power that Satan's got away from him. Yes, sir. It belongs to him. Well, you say, brother Lingard, that he was anointed there in 1963, and we still haven't come to that. I know there was a gap from the time David was anointed for his kingly position before the coronation took place. So let me just stop right there for for time. Okay. And so um though it lingered, God has vindicated it by his prophet shepherd to this age. And you might say, "Brother William, prophet shepherd to our last age." Yes. Allow me to call your attention to what he said about that. And these are these are all puzzles pieces that you put together and allows the bride of Christ to see what the foolish virgin can't see. Why? The oil, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. So we can get beyond our human understanding &gt;&gt; and we can see that he's a supernatural God. There's nothing impossible for him. Once he vindicates his promise, the bride of Jesus Christ is going to contend for it, going to wait for it, and going to believe for it and going to receive it. &gt;&gt; And so here's what he said in the church age. It is not enough that he has associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was seen standing among the seven golden lampstands. Nor it is enough that we even see the five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4 apostle, prophets, teachers, evangelist, pastors. For in each age the church goes astray. And it's not just the ley but the clergy group. Shepherds are wrong as well as sheep. Then God brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministry of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the abundant power of the truth. So the Holy Spirit which has revealed the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, he's quickening that truth to you to turn it into power and deliverance in your life or through you for the life of others. &gt;&gt; And and and so I I I rejoice of this because look at the last church age. ALL WE ALL LIKE SHEEP HAD GONE ASTRAY. We couldn't even get water baptism right. They had a name that they liveth but were dead. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the evidence of the Holy Ghost, right? Let alone eternal hell or the original sin. All those things that HELP ME. WHY DO I die when I first came to Christ? Why do I die? Because I'm was born hybrid. I was born sexual. I knew none of that. So that's power to lead his people back to the truth, the abundant power of that truth. God is in his people, all of his people. For any man that has not the spirit of Christ, he's none of his, and he is the word. That would be the word recognized in the people. See? So God rich in mercy, if we were all like sheep, we gone astray and we couldn't find our way back to the apostolic times, we couldn't do it. But what is man that God is mindful of him? The shepherd David said, &gt;&gt; "And what is the son of man that he visited him on the Jordan River? What is man? We were like sheep going astray. We were helpless. We had separated ourselves from glory. But God knew we needed a shepherd. &gt;&gt; And that shepherd came to call his sheep. How does he call you? My sheep hear my voice. So we see that Christ, our shepherd, is manifesting that relationship with us through the seven messengers. And the church didn't know that because it's been hidden in the book of Revelations. And the book of Revelations wasn't open until the end time. It took a prophetic It's a prophetic book. It was an eagle that gave it to John. And so it takes an eagle to reveal it when it's time. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, and then every church age was the same. He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the church by way of the messenger. &gt;&gt; It's God's gift of grace to us. And so let's go into it now. Christ our shepherd, I shall not want. And that's what inspired me when I read that. I shall not want. And I thought, why should I not want? Because he supplies everything I need by Christ our shepherd. everything that I need to come to the sunship of Christ, to come back to an amateur God, to come back to that position, not just pray for it, but to command it. That's where Adam was in the beginning. He had supreme control of the earth. &gt;&gt; And so, how can you have supreme control of the earth until God gets supreme control of you? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. There's the power. Okay. And so an amateur god and that's typed by David anointed for his kingly position. The supreme authority to command it. A king doesn't have to have. We have presidents here. But you go into Europe and where you had all of those dynasties and monarchs after monarchs. It's all about the throne and the king. And you'll see the king on his horse and with the sword. Why? Because the sword, he basically uh enforced the law of his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it's more real there. So Christ my shepherd, who is he? The Bible said God is my shepherd. God is an immortal spirit. God had no beginning. God had no end. God didn't have to die, but he had a plan. He had a purpose. So Christ, our shepherd, is the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He's the pillar of fire. And that's what the Bible said. When Saul of Tarsus was struck down by the pillar of fire, he knew that light was Elohim. But he didn't know that Elohim had visited the son of man on the river because we needed a shepherd &gt;&gt; and he was made flesh &gt;&gt; as the son of man. What for? To lay down his life for the sheep to manifest the pillar of fire as Christ our shepherd. It had to become flesh. So listen, I was thinking this. Saul knew his Bible better than almost anybody in that age. Is that correct? He knew it. He knew what Moses taught. He knew it inside and out. But he didn't know the author. He didn't know the author because when that pillar of fire became flesh, the one who wrote the Bible by the prophet and gave him all the types and shadows of Moses the prophet shepherd in that they still Paul didn't know him. So you can know your Bible perfectly. Here's the Bible. &gt;&gt; But without the pillar of fire on the scene, to quicken it to you and to reveal it to you like he did to Saul. Then he said, "Who are you? I am Christ. I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Brandham tells us over and over their mistake. They could not take the scriptures that they were preaching and believing and match them to the experience that Jesus Christ was giving them. Why? Because it's repeating again. All of these things like sunset mountain and and the picture of the pillar of fire and the picture of the seven licks of fire. All of these things are scripturally based and God has given them to you not only as a vindication but to raise your faith in his shepherd's voice. &gt;&gt; And so then I was thinking, you know, back in if I was living in the days of Israel, you know, they they read all the time a pillar of fire by night, a cloud by day, but not all of them saw the pillar of fire. Not all of them saw the cloud by day. most did not. And then in the New Testament, Paul saw it as a light. And so I'm a let's say I'm I'm a sinner. I haven't accepted Christ yet. I'm believing I'm believing God is real. But there's always that question a little bit. Is God really real? But here in this age, he scientifically came down and had his picture taken so that you can see the pillar of fire vindicating his prophet shepherd to this age. &gt;&gt; To lead you and guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the water baptism straight. &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the evidence of the Holy Ghost straight. They couldn't get the gifts of the spirit straight. But God rich in mercy came down through his prophet shepherd and with the voice of thus saith the Lord &gt;&gt; vindicated. &gt;&gt; There's no wonder no more. We've returned to the bishop and the the shepherd of our soul, the Holy Ghost that has revealed these things to us and it's turning into power in our age because it's making us what he wants us &gt;&gt; to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. So Moses, you know, Moses said, "The Lord your God will raise up a prophet like into me." And they claimed to believe Moses. They claimed to believe their Bible. But yet when he came as son of man, they denied him. They denied him. And when he raised from the dead, he rebuked them for not believing all the prophets said. And he preached the prophets because they were testifying of himself. And that's why you see the prophet shepherd on the scene today, the pillar of fire. He's preaching the prophets and the scriptures because they're testifying of him. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So when you distance yourself from the pillar of fire in that picture, you're removing the landmark. And the Bible says, don't remove the landmark. Amen. That's what anchors us. That's where we know our place, where our position, where our property is. And we don't want to be dogmatic about that statement. We want to have the grace of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay? So if somebody gets out of step, Lord, help us to help him to come back in line because we're living in the end time when the spirit of apostasy is sweeping the world. Why? They're like Saul. They only had a knowledge of the truth. And it's a almost a perfect knowledge of the truth. But time and circumstances, God proves who is his. &gt;&gt; Because the difference then between his sheep and those that turn out to be sheep in wolves clothing is his sheep have the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; They have the revelation of what he said. And upon this rock I'll build my church. And though the gates of hell come against us, it's the greatest battle ever fought day in and day out. &gt;&gt; But it shall not prevail. &gt;&gt; Why? I'm under the blood. My sins are remitted. It is a fact. &gt;&gt; And I know I'll make mistakes. And I know I have to die daily. So I know what I got to do because the shepherd is leading me. He's guiding me. &gt;&gt; All right. So, the pillar of fire manifested himself though Moses knew what his purpose was in life. his mother taught him &gt;&gt; and and and and I'm be and then may you know it's a blessing that you've grown up under parents in the message but also it can be a liability &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS TAUGHT his purpose. He knew what he was ordained for but he could not fulfill it until he met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PILLAR OF FIRE THAT'S THE SHEPHERD. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; It's the pillar of fire that's Christ. And he comes into his prophet to take control of his voice and his being in order to express what he is to that age. And when he came to Moses, what did he express? The token, the blood of the lamb, the power to call them out. So, so, so here's a key statement. If Jesus Christ, our shepherd, the son of man, if he overcame for us, and he did, he said, "It is finished. He conquered death, hell, and the grave for us. Then why do we have to fight the good fight of faith for the crown of life, for the crown of glory? Why? He said it's finished. He overcame for us so that he could overcome in us. And that he overcome in us. And there's where the power to become the sons of God are. Not just accepting Christ and what he did for us, &gt;&gt; but him coming into my life and overcoming death in my heart, hell in my mind, and the grave in my body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here's the statement. The pillar of fire came down in the east on the Jordan River to anoint Jesus as the son of man's shepherd to conquer death, hell, and the grave for us. And look what it look how John identified that three-fold purpose. To conquer death by the remission of sins. to conquer hell by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and to conquer the grave when he comes the second time to separate the shaft from the wheat and when the wheat will shine like the sun in his glory. &gt;&gt; So he identified it. It was in him, but it's been hidden. &gt;&gt; It's been hidden until this age. &gt;&gt; And so what I'm trying to say is this. The pillar fire came down on the Jordan River in the east to anoint him as the son of man's shepherd to conquer death and hell and the grave for us that he might come down the same pillar of fire in the west on the Ohio River to unfold himself as the son of man shepherd by a son of man. Are we all together? by a son of man to conquer death, hell, and the grave in us. In us. That's why we point so much to the ministry of the pillar of fire in this day here. He conquered death, hell, and the grave for us. And now he's conquering death, hell, and the grave in us. And he does nothing until first Amos 3:7 says he shows it by his prophet shepherd. &gt;&gt; Christ our shepherd I shall not want. He the pillar of fire supplies everything you need. Do we all agree that the pillar of fire is our savior? Do we all agree it's the pillar of fire that this is his work of redemption? &gt;&gt; The immortal spirit of God is your savior by his power. And notice I shall not want because by his threefold manifestation of Christ our shepherd, he supplies everything we need. Three-fold. First, now here we come to the core of the message. First, the good shepherd. Second, the great shepherd. Third, the chief shepherd. Good shepherd makes a way for the great shepherd. And the great shepherd makes a way for the chief shepherd. Now, here's the scripture on it. John 10:11 says this, "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd layeth his wife down for the sheep." Who is the good shepherd? The I am the pillar of fire. How is he going to lay down his life for his sheep? by coming down on the Jordan River and anointing Christ, the son of man, to bring many sons the glory. So the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep that their sins might be remitted by what? The power of the blood of Jesus Christ. It all starts with the blood of Jesus Christ. Then he becomes the great shepherd which is in Hebrews chapter 13 and 30. Let me read this. Now, the God of peace that brought again from the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ, that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant. So, in order for him to raise up, he had to lay his life down. And when he laid his life down by the power of the blood of Jesus Christ for you now, THE HOLY GHOST, praise God, is the power to raise up in your life once the blood has been applied. &gt;&gt; Amen. A new creature, &gt;&gt; A NEW CREATION. WHAT FOR? TO PROVE by the great shepherd that greater is he that is in you than your trials, &gt;&gt; than the persecution of Saul against David. &gt;&gt; Now, that's power. &gt;&gt; That's real power. &gt;&gt; That's Holy Ghost power. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want in my life. &gt;&gt; Lay down. The good shepherd lays down his life. manifest the power of the blood so he can raise up as the great shepherd, ascend back to the pillar of fire and SEND DOWN THE HOLY Ghost to become a new creature and have power to overcome the Sauls and the Philistines and everything that comes against you. That power of the Holy Ghost according to the promise of his word is in you to overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. So the good shepherd makes a way for the great shepherd. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the great shepherd is making a way for the chief shepherd. And we find that in first Peter 5 and4. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive what? &gt;&gt; A crown of glory that fadeth not away. &gt;&gt; Amen. David was anointed for a kingly position. He was anointed right then as the king, the chief shepherd of Israel. But there was a gap. There was 15 years before he ever came to the throne. And when you are born again, you receive the spirit of adoption. And it reveals your position in Jesus Christ. But then like David, you have to overcome first before you can have your coronation ceremony when the chief shepherd comes, which is the second coming of Jesus Christ. So now we're seeing where sunship is fully placed. It's placed under the chief shepherd because that's when David took the throne. That's when David was crowned. That's when David exercise the power to command it. His supreme authority. Though he was anointed for it, there was a reason. And that's what we want to see. so that you can be encouraged in your Christian life and understand why you're going through what you're going through because it's painful. It's a harder way. Amen. To be a good soldier of Jesus Christ, you have to endure hardness. And you know what that hardness is? Evil for the good you do. It's exactly what the Bible says. Evil for good. That's hard. That takes power. That takes the power of the Holy Ghost and the blood of Jesus Christ to die daily to those thoughts of the carnal mind and Satan saying, "You want to get even and that's not fair and why did they do this and why did this happen to me and why did that happen to me?" God permits it for your perfection. And when we get a revelation of that, then we understand the harder way is his way. And I know it leads to the promise of glory. And that's all that matters in my life &gt;&gt; because we don't know when we're going to leave here. &gt;&gt; They're dying at all ages. But thank God when many of them when they're dying they at least have accepted Christ as their shepherd. So now let's just see it again. The three-fold manifestation of Christ the shepherd supplies everything you need to come to your sunship to the crown and the throne of glory. The good shepherd is the power of the blood. So I'm going to say it again and then you say blood. The good shepherd is the power of his blood. &gt;&gt; The great shepherd is the power of his holy spirit. &gt;&gt; And the chief shepherd is the power of the spoken creative word. The power to command it. the power to overcome the grave. &gt;&gt; The blood separates your soul from death. The Holy Spirit which takes into your heart the mercy seat then separates your mind, your spirit from the gates of hell that's constantly beating you and pounding you with carnal thoughts. Now by carnal thought it doesn't necessarily mean worldly thought but the wrong understanding of the message leaning to your own understanding misapplying misinterpreting &gt;&gt; that's the spirit of air and that's what we have to overcome sinful impulses of the flesh my body is not redeemed sticky nature &gt;&gt; okay but the greatest threat tar of all is the deception of Satan in this age the spirit of error becomes 99.99 right one word I didn't teach that that's not my message that's what the prophet shepherd taught us of this age so that we would know what we are up against &gt;&gt; and we fight not with a dogmatic spirit we fight with the love of God in our heart because he that converts a sinner, that's an unbeliever, from the air of their way hides a multitude of sin. And that's the power of God in my life. And that's what I want to see Christ doing through me is help those people that are wrong to be right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. The deacon wanted to give me three bottles of water. Brother Israel said two. It's only fair. It's right. That's the order. We want to respect it. All right. So let me now be because the symbols of crowns and thrones if we lived in Europe you know it's more common to the people in Europe but here we have presidents okay and so crowns and thrones let me read to you what brother Brown said about it so you can see it pertains to adoption it pertains to redeemed human beings okay and so the first one is from how can I overcome? So the promise of wearing a crown of glory, it also fits with the promise of Revelations 3:21. To him that overcomemeth will sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and sat with my father in his throne. So now let's look to the voice of this age to understand what that means from how can I overcome. If we suffer for Christ and his word, we will reign with him. For he is the word. Okay, that's not the letter. That's the locust. That's the immortal spirit. &gt;&gt; Okay, for he is the word. Remember, if we suffer for him and his word, we will reign with him in his word. So there's the throne in our heart. Yes, &gt;&gt; we're going to come to a place by his blood and the seven stripes of the spirit, his faith, his virtue, his knowledge, his temperance, his patience, his godliness, his brotherly kindness, so that he can take his throne in us as king of kings and lord of lords. &gt;&gt; And that's sunship, that's when he has you under his supreme control and then he can exercise his supreme power through it. And we need to understand this because I see people around the world trying to manifest these things and it's the promise for the age. But God has a time, a season, and a way to do it. All right. So, here's another one from the Philadelphiaian church age. It is in the midst of the time of great trouble that Jesus comes. And with his coming there is a resurrection. Many are to come forth out of the dust and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return. And these will be given crowns. Why? Because they're sons of God. They're kings with them. They are reigning with him. That is what crown signifies. Reigning and ruling with the great King Christ himself. That is the promise to all those who suffer with him here on earth. All those who endured patiently, knowing that God, the just judge, would reward them. They who gave up all for him and committed all to him will sit down in his throne and share in his glorious kingdom. So what you will be placed in Christ so Christ can reign in you and through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. for he is the king of glory and it's him that has you in supreme control that's able to bring all things else in supreme control &gt;&gt; and then one last one Philadelphia church age the bride goes wherever the bridegroom is she will never be left by him she will never leave his side she will share the throne with him she will be crowned with his glory and honor honor. So you see, you're you're you're called when the shepherd calls you. He's calling you for a glorious purpose. It's his glorious purpose in you in your life. And when you respond to the call, you surrender your life to him through the blood of Jesus Christ. So you Satan can be taken away controlling your life and he can begin to take control of your life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if Christ our shepherd conquers death, hell, and the grave for us, then why do we have to fight the good fight of faith to win the crown of his glorious life, the glorious liberty of the sunship when he comes riding in as the chief shepherd? See why? He has to conquer in us. The power of the blood kicks out the old man. It takes back control of your being. And then the Holy Ghost comes into that and fights the good fight of faith with you by taking the sword that the king placed in brother Brandham's hand to cut out the word of God for this age. And by those promises and that revelation, you're able to overcome &gt;&gt; and you're able to endure hardness. &gt;&gt; The hardness is real. The pain is real, is it not? &gt;&gt; It's very real. Suffering physically, mentally, emotionally, our loved ones. We all have loved ones we've had to fight for. We had all loved ones that go astray. We know what that means. And the love of God constrains us with a faith that works by love to go to the throne of the great shepherd. Put that need on the throne and claim it and believe it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Be not anxious for nothing, but by prayer and your petition with thanksgiving, &gt;&gt; make your requests known to God. Lord, I thank you. You delivered me here. Lord, I thank you. Do you delivered them there? Lord, I thank you. I thank you. I THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE. And now I'm gonna place it there and I'm not Now, this is the this is what you got to overcome. I'm going to place it there and I'm not going to be anxious about it. So anxious about it. This is real. Okay. Um you you you you try to help it. You don't realize it, right? We try to help it. Well, you know, I prayed this. So then you go over here and you're doing this and you're going over here and doing that. Just let go. But it's hard because there's emotions behind it. &gt;&gt; We have love. We have feelings. There's emotion behind it. But it's powerful. If you ever can get an experience like that, take it to the Lord and leave it there. That's what he wants you to do. And now we're not up araiding you. We're just encouraging you. There's power in that kind of prayer and confidence in God &gt;&gt; in his time, in his season, and in his way. He will do it. &gt;&gt; So the power of the good shepherd is his blood. The power of the great shepherd is his holy spirit. And the power of the chief shepherd is the power of the king's command, the spoken creative word. One comes out of the other. Out of the blood comes the Holy Ghost. Out of the Holy Ghost, when it comes and gets you under supreme control. Then is when your name on the check is the same as his. Then is when we are an amateur God. Then is when you have the power to command it. But not until then. So, we're thankful &gt;&gt; by Amos 3:7. The Lord I'm I'm I'm going to amplify. This is the New William amplified version. The Lord, the pillar of fire, will do nothing for you, his sheep, except he reveals it first by manifestation in his prophet shepherd for your age. And what did he manifest? The son of man. Not his perfection, God's perfection. And we've seen that by what he did for us, what Christ the pillar of fire did for us through his prophet, he restored the bleeding word that the denominational ages had made none of effect. Where's Acts 2:38? You got a name that you're dead and you live. Just that simple thing. Acts 2:38. He restored it so that we can get under the blood by the spirit of his promise. And then those who applied the blood and received the bloody word and that what comes next? The token. It released the token. The life of Christ to overcome and bring you to the stature of a perfect man. If you want to know what the token is, look at the stature of the perfect man. There's the token. It's how many spirits are there? There's one spirit. But he takes it and he builds you and he builds you and he builds you &gt;&gt; until he caps you off. And then when you come to the top of the pyramid, that's where he manifests the kingly power of his supreme authority, the spoken creative word. And that's exactly what we've seen in this age by Malachi 4. And that's why we sing the song, "Can't you see why I'm happy?" Now, my my pastor back at church at the open door, I can quote him in this because he's quoted at a similar time. He says out to them, and I I'm I'm just a sheep like you there, he says, "Now, I know that song makes some of you happy." And I'm scr unhappy and I'm scratching my head. What? You know, can't you see why I'm happy? I've accepted the word of the Lord by the prophet of Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; who knew these things and not known him but he vindicated him in power. &gt;&gt; The ancient of days came down on Sunset Mountain &gt;&gt; and the Ancient of Days is THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF HIS SUPREME deity and he picked up a prophet to bring into preview Revelations 3:21. He began to sit in his kingly power. &gt;&gt; That's a lot, isn't it? But aren't you thankful for it? &gt;&gt; And when did he do it? In the Coronado Forest. And Coronado is Spanish for what? &gt;&gt; The coronation place, the crowning place. He's given us a PREVIEW OF IT. WE ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE. And as your pastor shepherd, local pastor shepherd, I'm here to to try to help him to help you to see these things. But you have to have the desire &gt;&gt; in your heart to say, "I'm going to go look at these things." &gt;&gt; Brother, uh, we come out of the same church, Brother Bob Willard. We all came out of the same church, all ordained under the same ministry. But the thing that we three have in common is when we were taught something or we heard something, we went back to the source and we dug in and we saw it for ourselves. So nobody talked us into it. I didn't believe it because this wouldn't believe it. I believed it because I had the personal experience with Christ, my shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want for you. &gt;&gt; That's what we want for you. All right. Let me go let me bring this to a close now because I'm at 56 minutes. All right. I said we would I said we would come back. I'm going to come back to David. First, Paul Paul was the one that said, "I have fought a good fight, Timothy. I've finished the course. I've kept the faith. Henceforth, there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness, the crown of righteousness, the crown of immortal life, the crown of glory. It's all that same immortal person. It's that outpouring of the Holy Ghost where he fully takes his seat in your heart in a coronation ceremony of adoption. But you already have the spirit of adoption. You already have the revelation of what you are. The question is he has to overcome in you in order to make you worthy for the throne. So, so now Paul is telling Timothy, second Timothy chapter 2 and verse 8, he's telling Timothy how to be the good soldier of Jesus Christ. Okay? The good soldier of Jesus Christ. Not Jesus Christ over here, but Jesus Christ in you. &gt;&gt; He is the soldier. You've got to get the soldier in you. He's the Holy Ghost. He's the soldier. And so let's reason now and let's see how he he does this and I will bring this quickly to a close. He says remember let's see second Timothy 2 and verse 8. Let's read it. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel. I thought what? He was raised from the dead according to your gospel? Paul, you weren't even sure. You didn't even recognize him back then. But the revelation of full redemption and the New Testament covenant, the pillar of fire returned and gave it to Paul. And now what Paul is going to say, Timothy, I told you to endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross. Now I'm going to use my own life as a testimony. And he says here, "Wherein I suffer as an evildoer." Preaching the resurrection to the Jews. And that days, he was suffering as an evildoer. Heretic even into bonds to imprisonment in that old, cold, dingy, ratinfested prison. God put him in there. But then God revealed himself greater in that suffering. He wrote the epistles and he says here wherein I suffered trouble as what? An evildoer unto bonds according to but the gospel is not bound. The word of God therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake. So Paul's saying, "I'm not going to complain about it. I I've been in distress. I've been in hunger. I've been in cold. I've been in the deep. I've been beat with stripes." How could this man do it? The only way he could do it would be by the power of the Holy Ghost and the revelation of what his reward was and his love for the church. Therefore, I do all things for the elect's sake that they may obtain the salvation. The word salvation here, if you'll run it through the New Testament, is full redemption. Okay? This is coming into your adoption. That they may attain the salvation in Christ Jesus with what? &gt;&gt; Eternal glory. &gt;&gt; Eternal glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Crown of glory. eternal glory, throne of glory. It's just symbols of the person of Jesus Christ when he comes as the chief shepherd. All right, next verses. We're going to make it real to you. We're going to re-emphasize what we've already told you. Notice now, Timothy, this is how you become a good soldier of Jesus Christ. It is a faithful saying, for if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. And so here we find the threefold manifestation of Christ our shepherd. First, you have to die to live. Second, you have to live to suffer. Third, why are you suffering? In order to reign. First, he says you have to die to live. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Second, then he says when you live, once you die to live, then you have to live to suffer. And then you're suffering for a glorious purpose. You're suffering for a crown of glory. You're suffering for his eternal glor glory that you might reign in his kingly power. So then why do we have to suffer? We have to suffer so that the character is molded in us and brings us under his supreme control so that we are fit to reign in his power. For power, kingly power without that character cannot reign. And so the brother I heard his prayer. What is he doing now? He's molding a church. Brother Brandham said, "What's holding back the coming of the Lord was the perfection of the church. She has to be perfectly right." How is she perfectly right? Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, godliness, brotherly love, and that's power. That's power. When God gives you the knowledge of what is right and wrong in a situation, and you've been waiting a long time for the answer, and then you go forward and he says, "Hold your peace." Temperance, right? Temperance. Temperance. God gave it to me. Hold your peace. Why? Patience. Patience. Okay. Then one day you'll be walking along. You'll be driving along. You'll be in a situation you're not even thinking about it. And there it'll unfold. The right time, the right place, the right person, the right way. So, who's controlling this situation? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. And how do you think the outcome's going to be? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to be just right. HE DOES ALL THINGS JUST RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S not me taking a gift like one of the nine. Let me show you what I can do. As soon as you see that, you know something is wrong. Okay? Something is wrong. Okay? We don't take our ministral gifts and try to see, let me show you what I know. Let me show you how I preach. No. No, no. Lord God, let us die. Let us get out of the way. We want Christ, our shepherd, to be glorified in the flock. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, first dying to live. So, how are you going to die to live? By the good shepherd. Praise the Lord. Oh, I love it. &gt;&gt; The Bible hooks together perfectly, but it takes the anointing of the spirit. How are you going to die to live? So when he calls you and he brings yourself to him, the first thing that has to happen is you have to die to live. And there's only one way you can die and that's by faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. Okay? Calvary. Lord, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live. But the life I now live, I live by the power of the Holy Ghost, the son of God. Now that I got the Holy Ghost, and by the way, I prayed for two years. I I I asked, I knocked. I sought. Okay? Because I'm not a Baptist. I did not receive the Holy Ghost when I believed the message. But the message told me exactly what I needed to do to receive the Holy Ghost. And one of the greatest things you need to receive the Holy Ghost is desire. &gt;&gt; Jacob had the desire. Nothing meant more to Jacob than the birthight. &gt;&gt; Though he was a shyster and he did many things wrong, but because of that desire, what was that desire? That was Israel on the inside, the gene of God, wanting Jacob to die so Israel could be born. And when Israel were born, HE HAD POWER WITH ALMIGHTY GOD AND MAN. And then what's the next thing Israel did? Then is it was Israel that put the code of seven colors on Joseph. See, then then the Holy Ghost in you, Israel, he's going to put the coat of seven colors on you so that you can then come to the throne, Pharaoh's throne, where he said to Joseph, YOU WILL BE OVER ALL OF MY HOUSE. WELL, I want him over all my house. &gt;&gt; And so, here we are in this age, and this is another thing people understand. I'm coming quickly to a close. As they say, well, we're beyond Pentecost. As far as the age goes, we are. We are. We're up here in Joseph perfection. We've seen it at Sunset Mountain, right? We've seen a prophet being placed over the entire house of God, which it really wasn't Joseph over the house of God. It's Christ in this prophet trying to bring us into subjection to his word. And so the point is this. They say, "Well, we're up here. We need to speak the word and I'm going to speak the word and things like that." That's the promise for the age. But kingly power without the character to control your life is demonic. And so the point is, how are you going to reign? How are you going to suffer to reign if you've never lived to suffer? And how are you going to live to suffer if you've never died to live? There's the problem. There's actually the greatest battle. Die to live. Dying is a process. Dying is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire that comes upon that blood and that faith. Lord, this is my desire. Take all my all of my ambitions, everything that I want in my life. This is the most important thing to me. And I'm going to cry like a baby, Lord, until you give it to me. Not just when I'm here at the church, at the altar, BUT IN MY HOME, IN MY PRAYER CLOSET. I'm going to knock and knock and knock until he fills me with the Holy Ghost. And that's my testimony. That's my testimony. Then you have power in you to suffer the harder way. So people many years, 20, 30 years in the message really never got beyond a knowledge of the truth. And then what happens? The trials are getting harder and harder. The world is getting stronger and stronger. the power of the age and and the deception is all moving in and the people say I can't take it anymore. Are we together? &gt;&gt; You know, I felt like I couldn't take it anymore. But his grace, there's something in me that's holding me. There's something in me that won't let me quit. I have a revelation of my goal. I have a revelation of the promise. And I know we're in the age where the promise of the chief shepherd has been vindicated. And I believe it with all my heart and I'm living for it. And I die daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my mistakes mean nothing. Because we're humble, right? We admit, "Lord, I didn't mean to do that. Lord, forgive me. I spoke out of turn." You know, I I hate that when I speak out of turn. I was on the on a hike two days ago and it was the third time on this Pinnacle Peak hike and it was a lovely day. I mean, I was happy. It was a happy trail, you know. I was feeling good. I'm out here now. I'm away from the winter and this man with his son and his wife, they were coming up the trail and he was about oh 15 yards in front of her, but they were kind of going back and forth. It didn't seem too serious, but they were kind of like, you know, they had something they were disagreeing about. And so, happy me, I said, "Well, you know what? I'm on vacation. Otherwise, I'll offer you some counseling." And and and you know what he said? He says, "Well, I'll give you $30 an hour." And you know what she said? "Shut your mouth." I said, "You're right. That's good advice. That's good advice. Swift to hear, slow to speak. Amen. All right. So, how are you going to reign if you haven't suffered? And how are you going to suffer if you don't have the power of the Holy Ghost? And how are you going to live if you haven't died? So, it goes back to Pentecost, doesn't it? It goes back to the new birth. It goes back to dying out. It goes back to Jacob grace. It goes back to dying so Israel can live in the power of God with God and man. I had enough power to say that woman's right. Though they were disagreeing, she was right. Just shut my mouth. Don't interfere in their business. So, it was it was a good lesson for me. Absolutely. All right. Let me close. So you see though we're up here and we've seen a preview of the coronation ceremony. We've seen a prophet put the sword in his hands has the supreme authority of the supreme deity to speak in existence. But there's requirements and the requirements is kingly power without the character is not fit to rule. It's demonic. Okay. And we could give you illustrations of that, but we're out of time. Okay. So, you see then the three manifestations of the shepherd. The good shepherd enables you to die to live. The great shepherd raises up and enables you to live to suffer. He's interceding for you. He's there on the throne for you. He's holding the church while she's growing through the seven church ages to come to Revelations 3:21. And where is Revelations 3:21? at the top of the pyramid after he's done the work of the great shepherd after he's interceding for his church that's been suffering the persecution of denominational church the persecution of the world and all that after he she suffers and he forms her into the character then he's ready to take his throne sunship hip. How many can see that? Okay. So, now we come back to David. And this is what I want to close with. David the good shepherd. And now I'm I'm I'm 13 minutes. I'm over. Okay. David, here's the point. David the good shepherd was anointed to be the chief shepherd. And right then he was placed as king. Yet he did not express his kingly authority. He became a fugitive. He ran for his life. Saul was after him. Saul wanted to kill him. Saul didn't want to give up the throne. Saul didn't want to give up his position. He was jealous of him. and he tried to oppose David's kingly position, his kingly commission. And God permitted it. Why did God permit it? Because David could not go directly from the good shepherd to the chief shepherd. He's a type of Jesus Christ. And he had to go from the good shepherd to the great shepherd to the chief shepherd. And so he let Saul persecute him and run him and do him evil for the good that David did to PROVE THAT THE HOLY GHOST in David was greater than the evil spirit anointing the church natural and the Philistines and all that to persecute David. And so David, that interval between the good and the chief shepherd was the great shepherd. And why didn't Jesus just go from good shepherd to chief shepherd? For the same reason, he had to stay on the throne and intercede for us while we died daily to oursel while the church suffered the denominational persecution. put him to death like Saul wanted to do David right through the seven church ages. But now here we are at the end of the seven church ages and Revelations 3:21 is coming in view and a prophet has been anointed with the kingly ministry of Christ our shepherd. And we're so thankful that we see it. So finally, David came to his final test. And in your darkest hour, and we've all had our darkest hour, right? We've had that that time, that moment that something was pressing us. We didn't know the way out. It looked like, okay, you know what? This is looking like defeat. This is looking like they got us this time. And that's when God moved on the scene. Saul and his armies, they had David, they had him boxed in in the cave. He had nowhere to go. He had nowhere to hide. But God moved in on the scene. God help you. God help me in that darkest hour to hold our faith in the promise. David, you're anointed for a position. Nothing can stop that promise. Hold your faith. Stand there. David didn't know how he was going to get out of it. But God came on the scene in his way, in his time, and he raised up a standard for David. And you know what it was? He gave Saul and his men a sleeping pill symbolically, right? Just, you know, no swords, no clash, no armor. Just gave them a sleeping pill. And they were out cold. They were out cold. And they were falling asleep. And then and then here comes David. And his men said, "The Lord has delivered him in your hands, David. Here's your opportunity, David. Here's your time. He did you evil, evil, evil, and all you did was good, good, good. Slay him, David. The Lord's delivered in your hands." And do you believe David was tempted to do it? He sure was. But then what happened? There was a battle inside David. And David knew the scripture, touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm. And so instead of killing him, he had the character that what? Spared his life. Spared his life. That's what I want to do to my enemies, especially in the RELIGIOUS REALM. GOD HELP THEM. They don't understand what they're doing. And so he took the king's sword, cut a piece of the king's garment, and when Saul woke up, he waved it to him. He got his attention. And when he saw that, and he knew, musicians, please come. He knew that David had spared his life, he said, "Now I know." Can we stand? Now I know what you'll be king because whereas I rewarded evil for good, you rewarded good for evil. That's the testimony I want. And brothers and sister, that's a painful testimony. That's the harder way. But that's the way that the prophet shepherd has led us in this day as our example. the harder way leading us into the tremendous victory of the love divine. &gt;&gt; Do we know that song? Lord, my heart is open. Won't you come inside? Fill up all my being ever to abide. How many can give me a little bouquet and say, "You help me if I help me." All right. And I it helps me too because it's it's a real battle. It's a real battle. You got burdens. You got burdens. Brother Israel as an individual, he's got burdens. But as a pastor, he's also bearing your burdens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So pray for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pray. Let the faith that works by love. Pray for one another. I know a thousand% that this man is doing the very best he can for you. So are the deacons. So is the church. Love one another. Pull together. And remember a church that has lost their burden for soul saving. Be soul saving is open. I need grace inside. Feel upon my being never to abide. I've open up the windows. I th every door. Come inside your Lord. I need you more and more. &gt;&gt; I like it from your heart. Now again my heart is open and won't you come upon my king ever to abide I've opened all the windows I' over. Come inside here, Lord. I need you more and more and more. &gt;&gt; While you're playing softly, Christ our shepherd, the power to become the sons of God. His blood is on the throne. His spirit is ready to be poured out. And we've seen the kingly power, have we not? &gt;&gt; So, we know we're living in the age that God is going to bring the complete cycle of redemption. &gt;&gt; I want to be one of those. You want to be one of those? Let's just lift your hands. We're not going to do an altar call. I want to be one of those. God bless you, young children. All of you. Say, "Lord, let this faith work by love because that's power. That's power." God bless you. We're going to sing it one more time as our song leader comes. God bless you, brother Lord. open and won't you come into fill up all my being ever to abide. I've opened all the windows, thrown wide every door. Come inside, Lord.

I really enjoy the word of the Lord tonight. As brother Bill was talking about two years he was seeking for the Holy Ghost. How many saints here remember when you were uh seeking the Holy Ghost some time was waiting, carrying service after service? It took me over two years as well. I know some people it doesn't take that long, but I just was really so hungry. I was discouraged many times. But one afternoon, it was on a Monday, the Holy Spirit came down and filled my soul. And I shall never forget it. And I want to encourage all of you that are seeking the Holy Spirit in your life or another filling of the Holy Ghost. Don't be discouraged. It's for you and he wants to give it to you. It's a good gift. It's good. It's precious and he wants you to have it. And you need that in your life to overcome the challenges of this day. And it's for you. It's a promise. The good shepherd, the great shepherd, the chief shepherd wants you to have it. And so we want to remember sister Lynette. She's asking the Lord to completely heal her. she sent that she needs a complete healing in her body. So let's bow as we close for prayer and close for these needs. And if you have a need in your life today, you want to be included in this prayer for healing, for deliverance, for the Holy Ghost. And for those precious ones that rededicated your life to the Lord today and tonight, oh, may you ever continue forward, Father. all these hands that are raised and these hearts responding to the message they heard tonight. Lord, as we pray once again to close this meeting, but we present Sister Lynette Blevens at your throne of mercy and grace, knowing that you're the great healer, you're the doctor, Lord, and we know that you uh will touch and heal our sister. We believe that for her and for this surgery, for Sister Lori, she's going in. Lord, remember her also and the other requests that we have. So many, Lord, for these ones that need the Holy Ghost in their life. Lord, may they not ever sleep or let it go, but they'll stay with it like Jacob did. Wrestle all night long with the angel until you changed his name. He overcame. And Lord, may that be the promise and the blessing for every heart that's gathered here tonight. As we prepare to leave from here, may your Holy Spirit go with us. The sweet Holy Spirit go with us and be with us through the night. We sing these praises all through the night. And the angels of God around us encamping bringing the promises to pass. Lord, there be someone here that needs to stay even to pray and to meditate on these things. Lord, may they do that as we commit each one into your hands. Lord, as we close the meeting, bless brother Bill. Lord, strengthen him. And thank you, Lord, for the gift in his life tonight and encourage our hearts. Lord, we thank you for it. We thank you for these saints, Lord. This lovely church, the spiritual church.
