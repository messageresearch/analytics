like that verse today I've been forgiven today I've been healed cuz my God is awesome amen God bless each of you tonight we're so glad to be in the house of the Lord with you we have a portion of a tape we want to play for you it's in um uh 1965 uh before we do we'll read the scripture in second Peter chapter 1 if you take your Bibles and turn there we like welcome you to the house of the Lord always good to find oursel in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night Thursday night Friday night whatever night you can find time to be in the house of the Lord I think that's a good time amen of course we know this is second Peter this is uh as we take the first a couple of verses it's dealing with the Statue of a perfect man I want to read from verses 12 through 21 I have two quotes I want to read and then play this portion of the tape for you tonight it's only uh 20 minutes but I trust it'll be a blessing to you this scripture in verse number 12 Peter wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yeah I think it meet as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ Christ has showed me moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance that's the third time he's saying that for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy mount we have also a more sure word of Prophecy wherein to you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the Privacy the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated just for a moment this um the uh the portion of the message I want to uh play for you tonight uh I'll give you two references where brother Branham as we were sharing with you on Sunday night a lan in the presence of the son and I titled it laying in the presence of the son of man showing that this great ministry of a son of man revealing the son of man in the day that you live in and how important it is and the reason why it's so important is that we see so many that are trying to flex against that Ministry and trying to bring it down the confidence and he made mistakes here this isn't true uh what happened at the bridge that didn't happen and this one we verified on the internet that didn't take place that didn't take place and so why why is that like that it has to be that way but when you have a revelation of what came down in our generation then you'll know there are no mistakes in what God does Amen when he sent a perfect word he sent it um for you to have a perfect faith in it amen I don't believe God wants us to read the Bible thinking that it there's questions in it or that is partially true or maybe that's not right I don't believe we should go to the Lord in prayer thinking that maybe this is right or maybe it's not I think those questions need to be dissolved and when we're listening to the message if it's the message of God then I don't believe the Lord wants us listening to that message trying to verify it by somebody online all right some other group of people or whoever whatever they've come before they've gone before but God has revealed to us this G glorious message and here Peter is getting ready to leave the Lord revealed that to him in verse number 14 he says I I got to put off this Tabernacle the Lord Jesus showed me that so he knows he's leaving and he's telling the people to put these things in your memory and I played a portion of brother Billy Paul's uh that that dream that brother Billy Paul had had on Sunday night wasn't that nice it's a reminder to re to remember and so there's two places in the message and they're they've they've gone a controversy over the years but I don't want you to be afraid of any of these quotes and we'll get to the original when brother vom how this this terminology ride this Trail again there's three places in the message where brother bam is dealing with it it's all in 65 and the last two times is in the message God's only provided place of worship it's a morning service there in streetport and then in the evening service on the wings of the Snow White Dove and I want you to hear how brother uh I'm going to read this for you what brother vom says here this is at the beginning of the message he said I understand that in France this mornings there there's better than 2,000 Frenchmen on a several day fast that will come bring the message to France and French the whole Protestant Nation Protestant part of the nation of France and so we are it's just begin blooming now just begin the Shucks pulling away so the weak can lay out there now see so just keep reverent keep praying see remember they that wait upon the Lord renew their strength now there's I was getting pretty old and and I thought will I will there be another Revival I'll see another time and just remember from the West will come a white horse rider we'll ride this Trail again that's right soon as we get ready it's a promise you see and then later uh in the evening service in in sh Port um Louisiana he says this in paragraph 225 this is toward the end of his message he said why me an old man suffered all my life why did he heal me now I believe I'll ride this Trail again I got to bring a message and I say to my father tonight as Junior scene in a dream the other night the wings of this Dove moving in these windows here Lord your servants reporting for service amen I'm ready and so I read those two quotes but those two Quotes come off of a Dream by Brother Walker and I let brother bandam uh give that um the importance of it in there it's clear he's wanting the people people to get ready that something's fixing to happen and look how he warns them to pay their debts to stop playing church because something's fixing to happen it's a it's a tremendous warning and um and you'll hear it for yourself all right this is in the message um so as we prepare to go there to this message in in uh paragraph 240 uh through paragraph 290 and that's in the message I'm sorry I can't see what message that is and knoweth it not and knoweth it not not so thank you musicians you may be seated we'll hear this portion of the message God bless you brother Brandon then Billy Ren said Daddy that man's gone I can't I said who's that out there car I said some guy come down from Argan said he's got some kind of a dream and I told him I wouldn't give you no fall so it's 300 year waiting now and said and I told him just write the Dream Out said I got a pile of in here that high and how and I just added to it I said bring him in give him five minutes well as soon as the man walked in 5 minutes he said I am Reverend Walker I think his name was from Argan I think is a some other denomination I don't know Presbyterian pres and something he said I met you about 20 years ago I come down to Grant P where you and I grant p but uh um I forget the name of the place there said whole country headlines and paper every morning said everybody knew about it said I couldn't even get to the building where he's at but I seen you go up one day on the street I walked up said four or five men around you and I shook your hand you I told you I was

you're saying oh my brother sister now everyone of you conscious I know what that means just watch stay close to Christ let me warn you now as a minister the gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word at you're writing Christ because that's the only thing that's going to because we're in the most deceiving age that we ever lived in it would deceive the very elected if it was possible because they have a anointing they can do anything like the rest of them clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said not I mean like your house R stuff you got to do it get all your things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something's fixing

here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a lodge it's Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us I believe we're in look at in California look at the rids look at 19 people being killed racial didn't I tell you here not long ago that that Martin Luther King would lead his people to a massacre how many remembers that it isn't them colored people it's them leaders stiring them up it is an integration segregation and whatever they want to call it it's the devil right not only to the white colored it's to all of them it's a devil of the mental faculties and reasons a man is broke down there's no hopes is beyond hope the whole thing is aurated sore the mental faculties of man they can't make decisions I'm not a politician I don't neither democrat or republican they're all all Filthy I'm for one Kingdom and that's the kingdom of Jesus Christ that's all but how in the world did you ever see a bunch of Puppets like we got up there now like that bunch of Texans we got in there why they said whatever the people wants if they want communism we'll give them communism if they want integration we give them integration more segregation we get where did where is man oh God that's like the P pit where is man man that's manad that stands for a principle where is women that stands for a principal or is a church that stands for a principal I got a nickels wor the time for a wishy-washy give in compromising Spirit woman's a woman let her be lady if a man's a man let him be man if he's a president where is our John Quincy Adams where is our Abraham Lincoln and a principle where's our Patrick Henry said Give me liberty or give me death where's the man that stands for what's right where is the man's not afraid to speak out regardless the whole world's against him speak out for what right and stand for it and die for it where is our honor again today where is man of integrity where is man with Spirit there's so wish it washing GED up until they don't know where they stand God let me stand for the principles of one man as a minister the word of Jesus Christ for heavens and earth will pass away but it'll never fail on this rock I'll build my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against everything amen thank God for his word tonight amen you I mean it just really does something to you to hear the prophet scream out like that so we're going to go to the Lord in prayer let's all stand and we'll take this uh time to as he said to get ready that's what coming to church is all about is getting ready that's what the prayer meeting is for so that we can get ready and um I think we' have been warned there's a prayer in Ephesians I think I read it for for you before but Ephesians chapter 1 and we can read that and maybe as a church we can focus our our prayers for one another and um as the Apostle Paul um talks about that in Ephesians chapter 1 verse number 16 Ephesians 1:16 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you and my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give you give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what the riches of his glory Riches of the glory of his inheritance and the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power amen so that's what we want to pray that God will open our eyes understanding and he would give us the spirit of wisdom and we know uh the hour and the time we live in amen just a quick announcement for the uh coming Services December uh 24th which is Christmas
