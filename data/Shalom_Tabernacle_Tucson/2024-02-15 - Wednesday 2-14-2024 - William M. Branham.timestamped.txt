[31:42] so we like to go right into the word
[31:43] just for a moment we have a tape we're
[31:45] going to play for you but before we do
[31:48] from the last
[31:50] few uh Wednesdays we
[31:53] started back in
[31:56] um February the last Saturday in
[31:58] February or last Wednesday in feu
[32:01] January the 24th and then January 31st
[32:05] February 7th we did we started conduct
[32:09] order and Doctrine and we've been on the
[32:12] conduct portion and we just want to read
[32:15] a few places from the message just
[32:18] before we go into um the tape tonight
[32:21] amen there's a scripture in Hebrews
[32:23] chapter 10 we' like to turn
[32:26] there
[32:35] and Hebrews chapter
[32:39] 2 good nice to see you brother Nathaniel
[32:42] and your daughter there Aliana and each
[32:44] of you
[32:48] amen when you get those scriptures you
[32:50] can say amen amen Hebrews chapter 10
[32:53] verse number 24 and 25 it says let us
[32:58] consider one another to provoke unto
[33:01] love and to Good Works not forsaking the
[33:05] assembling of ourselves together as the
[33:08] manner of some is but exhorting one
[33:11] another and so much the more as we see
[33:16] the day approaching amen Hebrews chapter
[33:19] 2:
[33:21] 1
[33:23] three therefore we ought to give the
[33:25] most Earnest heed to the things which we
[33:27] have heard lest at any time we should
[33:30] let them slip for if the word spoken by
[33:33] Angels was steadfast and every
[33:36] transgression and Disobedience receive
[33:38] the just recompense of reward how shall
[33:42] we escape if we neglect so great
[33:45] salvation which at the first began to be
[33:48] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[33:51] unto us by them that heard him amen may
[33:55] God add a blessing to the reading of his
[33:57] word let us just pray Lord Jesus we ask
[34:01] that you would come now and speak to
[34:04] every heart that's gathered father you
[34:07] know exactly what we have need of and we
[34:10] believe your word is true when you said
[34:13] that you would be in our midst if we
[34:15] would Gather in your name we come
[34:18] gathered in your name now we ask your
[34:21] blessings now in Jesus name amen God
[34:24] bless you you may be seated thank you
[34:28] musicians thank you bless
[34:31] you um we have a few announcements and
[34:34] we'll get into those when we do our
[34:37] prayer requests so the purpose of these
[34:40] uh few little lessons they're they're
[34:42] very simple they're we call the ABCs but
[34:47] they have been very beneficial to us
[34:50] here I've had several comments on um
[34:54] just these 45 minutes left lessons or or
[34:58] segments that we've done on conduct
[35:00] order and Doctrine and we're just on the
[35:02] conduct we're just dealing with the
[35:04] conduct we'll get into the order how
[35:06] things are placed in order and then
[35:09] we'll get into that all these things are
[35:11] surrounded by a Doctrine out of the word
[35:15] and the first time we got together we
[35:17] showed you in the scriptures Luke
[35:19] chapter 14 us and the army of the Living
[35:23] God we're soldiers and this word this
[35:27] preaching this teaching is for the
[35:29] purpose of equipping the soldier it's to
[35:32] make
[35:34] pillars not just church members every
[35:37] church has those pillars those Believers
[35:40] that are steadfast they're unmovable
[35:42] they're going to be there through the
[35:44] thick and the thin you can count on
[35:46] their presence and um Jesus said that
[35:50] there's a promise that if we would
[35:52] Gather in his name he would be there so
[35:56] that's a promise
[35:57] and Hebrews chapter 10 that we read for
[36:00] you is a um it's a an admonition it's a
[36:06] Commandment that we don't forsake the
[36:09] assembling of ourselves together and
[36:12] what Leo deia has done for us and done
[36:14] to us we make the
[36:17] excuse that our Ox was in the ditch and
[36:21] I'd like you to examine that Ox just a
[36:23] little bit and what that responsibility
[36:26] is and what Jesus talked about there's a
[36:29] difference between you not being able to
[36:31] come and then you not deciding to come
[36:35] when the Believers gather together so
[36:37] let's make that very clear if you can't
[36:39] come of course we
[36:41] know it's not God's intention for you to
[36:44] be at every single service and
[36:49] somehow um your attendance will be a
[36:52] record on the other side maybe there
[36:53] will be I don't know but but I I can't
[36:57] see that that is you know a Salvation
[37:00] issue but but for us that come and
[37:04] gather in his name the single greatest
[37:06] outward appearance of God dealing with a
[37:09] young man or a young woman or old man or
[37:11] young old woman a newcomer is their
[37:15] attendance when they come to church and
[37:18] you see them at the prayer meeting and
[37:20] you see them coming Sunday morning
[37:22] consistently then we can say God is
[37:24] dealing with them that's just an outward
[37:27] I want you to get that very clear we're
[37:29] not saying that God is not dealing with
[37:31] people because they're not coming to
[37:33] church but for those of us who are are
[37:35] part of a body of Christ and we have to
[37:38] make things move and we have to open the
[37:41] doors and some people have to get a key
[37:44] some people have to be a part of an
[37:46] office have to be able to handle the
[37:47] word and teach you're not going to give
[37:49] those responsible responsibilities to
[37:52] people who are not here very clear and
[37:55] so to me that's one of the greatest
[37:58] singular outward expressions of
[38:03] spirituality or go or an importance to
[38:06] an individual's life and their heart is
[38:08] their attendance and we find this
[38:10] promised right in this word brother
[38:13] random deals with
[38:16] this terminology the post our post of
[38:19] Duty he says it many times he says um
[38:24] that your church is your post of Duty
[38:27] you know you have your other places that
[38:28] you want to go to and he deals with that
[38:31] and we read the quotations on that for
[38:34] you he deals with the sin of omission
[38:38] and I think and I would categorize
[38:41] forsaking the assembling of yourself
[38:44] with the omitting the Omission the not
[38:48] the things that you did it's the things
[38:50] that you didn't do so you omit to come
[38:54] together as the body of Believers have
[38:57] been called to come together remember
[39:00] we're not serving a location we're not
[39:03] serving a church or Pastor we're serving
[39:06] the lord and our attitude towards his
[39:10] word is our attitude towards
[39:13] him and so it's not about you know
[39:16] brother Israel those quotes make me feel
[39:18] guilty so I'll try to straighten up for
[39:20] a few weeks the quotes are not put
[39:23] together to make you feel guilty for a
[39:24] few weeks but it deals with the
[39:27] condition of your heart the word of God
[39:30] is there for the conditions of your
[39:33] heart and and it it will expose it will
[39:37] expose that you know we come together
[39:39] we're not perfect we come together we
[39:42] bump against each other there's things
[39:43] that happen and we got to say sorry we
[39:47] got to say oops we say it's my fault can
[39:51] I give you can you give me a second
[39:52] chance that's on purpose God designs
[39:56] that you know like Lord just make me
[39:58] perfect like boom and and if that was
[40:01] God's intention for you just to be
[40:04] perfect no scratches no bruises then
[40:07] when you gave your heart to the Lord as
[40:09] a Christian he should have just Zapped
[40:10] you out of here because you're ready for
[40:13] heaven right no you got work to do you
[40:16] got work to I got work to do I got to
[40:19] live this out so I want to take any more
[40:22] time on that and uh but I wanted to read
[40:26] this one quote and brother rold kind of
[40:28] opens this up
[40:31] in as he was talking
[40:35] about uh the post of Duty and he I read
[40:38] this for you and this really stood out
[40:40] to me because I've I've driven I've been
[40:42] around and all the churches I've been to
[40:47] typically the least attended services
[40:50] are the Wednesday night there's a
[40:52] Wednesday night
[40:54] crowd uh the Sunday night you'll see a
[40:56] break and the communion
[40:59] crowd and we know that that that's true
[41:02] we've we've seen that over the years how
[41:03] many you know what I'm saying this
[41:05] true all right so easier to stay home on
[41:09] a Wednesday sure Sunday it's almost like
[41:12] our
[41:14] duty and we feel so guilty just staying
[41:18] home just straight up staying home but
[41:21] Wednesday is like man surely I can take
[41:24] a Wednesday off
[41:29] right did I tell you to touch your
[41:31] neighbor
[41:33] yet okay we won't mess with you tonight
[41:36] all right so in this message
[41:39] here the Seal of Christ 1955 paragraph
[41:43] 38 I'm just going to read this quote and
[41:45] then we'll go right to the
[41:48] tape paragraph 38 1955 the Seal of
[41:53] Christ brother randam says this here
[41:54] just that my organ ganization I become
[41:57] the chief
[41:58] presor next year and maybe I'll be a
[42:01] district man or something that's all the
[42:04] preacher about cares about anymore come
[42:08] on preacher we're going to take it with
[42:11] them that's right oh my pulling feathers
[42:14] in the Hat and so forth when we ought to
[42:17] be on our knees crying for the sins and
[42:21] the Abomination and the disgrace that's
[42:24] done into the city we see seem to be so
[42:27] unconcerned about the Lost amen amen
[42:30] that's right you know that's the truth
[42:33] unconcerned about the Lost just so our
[42:36] church makes it so we have the greatest
[42:40] congregation Sunday all stay home Sunday
[42:43] night and look at the television today I
[42:46] was in one of the biggest churches in
[42:48] the city one of the member said we have
[42:51] 3,000 people here on Sunday morning
[42:55] Sunday night Sunday night we don't have
[42:58] half of it look what brother bam says
[43:00] they all come to church to do their
[43:06] religion and go back home look at the
[43:10] television take a little ride out in the
[43:13] country why it's a
[43:16] disgrace it shows there's something
[43:19] lacking in the heart
[43:22] amen so you know it sounds not I mean
[43:26] what's wrong about taking a ride in the
[43:28] country what's wrong with you know
[43:30] having a little family time on a Sunday
[43:33] afternoon well if the church doors are
[43:37] open and you forsake that I would
[43:41] classify that under the Omission the sin
[43:45] of omission and really this is about the
[43:48] matters of the heart brother branon
[43:51] makes a statement that if you are God is
[43:54] in your heart you you can't wait for
[43:58] those doors to open well I know as a kid
[44:01] I couldn't wait for the church service
[44:03] to close it seemed like because I had
[44:05] other things I want to run with my boys
[44:07] you know little kid raising Church you
[44:09] want to run and get on the drum set and
[44:12] after service run up and down and
[44:13] chitchat with this one and that one and
[44:16] play and go get something to eat but you
[44:18] know that's what a little kid thinks
[44:21] what about we us men us
[44:23] Brothers US soldiers God is trying to
[44:26] make pillars out of us and this last day
[44:30] group this last day
[44:32] laziness this Leo deia spirit that gets
[44:34] on all of us to just set back and just
[44:38] take it easy the scripture specifically
[44:41] tells us to awake to watch and pray and
[44:47] if there ever was an increase of service
[44:49] times of people Gathering Together
[44:52] prayer meetings that that's that's what
[44:54] should be taking place today our prayer
[44:57] meeting should be increasing more to the
[44:59] Saints coming to the house of the Lord
[45:02] for these things but we've seen just the
[45:05] opposite and it would make it easier
[45:07] maybe if we just had one service on
[45:09] Sunday one long service
[45:13] right how many wants
[45:16] that you know that's a trap
[45:20] huh we would just take a break one
[45:22] service Sunday then we get off Sunday
[45:25] afternoon what do you think you're going
[45:26] to do that Sunday
[45:29] afternoon you're not going to sit home
[45:30] and twidle your thumbs you'll find
[45:33] something to do shopping carousing
[45:36] you'll do whatever Le oia is doing
[45:39] eating carousing and all those things
[45:41] and so we're so glad we have a pattern
[45:43] that was laid for us some people can't
[45:45] have two services on Sunday that's not
[45:48] what we're talking about some people
[45:50] have their you know their Church order
[45:51] their church services the way they're
[45:53] conducted we're not talking about that
[45:55] we're we're talking about your church
[45:57] that is your postive duty then you don't
[46:00] want to forsake that amen amen God bless
[46:03] you so let's go to this message it's the
[46:06] message why Christ speak brother random
[46:09] preached it twice the first time he
[46:11] spoke it was here in
[46:14] Indiana and so let's stand and sing that
[46:18] old Hymn of the church only
[46:21] believe and we'll get the main part of
[46:23] that message there's a prayer line to it
[46:26] we won't get to the prayer line but
[46:28] we'll we'll get to this portion of the
[46:31] word he's going to be taking this
[46:32] scripture reading out of
[46:35] Exodus amen so let's sing that only
[46:39] believe singing
[46:42] on
[46:45] really

[47:56] all Lord
[48:00] I let's just remain standing and we'll
[48:03] take um move down to paragraph number 11
[48:06] sis and if you want to read along it's
[48:08] in Exodus chapter 23 and after the
[48:11] scripture is read then we can be seated
[48:14] God bless
[48:19] you now God is not going to hold a man
[48:22] responsible for because he's a sinner
[48:26] because he was born a sinner but what
[48:28] God's go to hold a man responsible for
[48:31] is because that he remains a sinner he
[48:33] don't have to remain a sinner for there
[48:36] is a provision made for his
[48:40] justification through Jesus Christ amen
[48:42] so we are trusting tonight if there be
[48:45] some Insider out who has not yet
[48:48] accepted Christ that this will be the
[48:49] night that something will be said or
[48:52] done that will wake you up to the the
[48:55] place that you know you need Christ and
[48:58] then if you just accepted him as your
[49:00] personal Savior and have not yet
[49:03] received the Holy Ghost I trust that
[49:06] tonight you will receive
[49:07] it I see some of the Tabernacle folks
[49:11] here I'm going to say this about the big
[49:14] sister one thing that the Tabernacle
[49:17] needs up there at our church at the
[49:19] Tabernacle Jeff is a rededication and a
[49:23] refilling of the Holy Ghost amen right
[49:26] uh everyone to get down to the Altar and
[49:29] pray until they get a renewing of the
[49:32] Holy Ghost the whole church be filled
[49:35] with the power of God that's what we
[49:38] need not only the Tabernacle there but
[49:41] the body of Christ
[49:43] Universal it needs a
[49:45] refilling I like David said one day
[49:48] restore to me the joy of my salvation
[49:52] now he had not lost his salvation but
[49:55] the Joy of it and when it comes to a
[49:58] place that I can't enjoy my religion my
[50:01] salvation there's something wrong
[50:03] somewhere because it is joy unspeakable
[50:08] and full of
[50:09] Glory one of them said taste and see the
[50:13] Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the
[50:17] Rock oh I'm so glad that I have tasted
[50:20] that amen the Lord is good and I love
[50:24] honey but I never tasted any like that
[50:28] that's the best that I know now we're
[50:31] going to hurry right into the service
[50:33] and see if we can let the church out
[50:35] early so the people can go to their
[50:37] places and of worship or work tomorrow
[50:41] in their homes and now we are
[50:45] anticipating a great meeting out on the
[50:48] west coast right away and we are asking
[50:51] and soliciting the prayers of this
[50:53] church and all these people to pray for
[50:56] me this morning there was something
[51:00] happened I've never went Harley to a
[51:02] little church unless God specially done
[51:05] something for
[51:06] me I just love
[51:09] that and this morning after I'd gotten
[51:13] through preaching perfectly in order the
[51:16] Holy Spirit fell among us and gave a
[51:20] message to brother
[51:22] Jackson that has just stuck with me all
[51:27] afternoon frankly I'm getting the tape
[51:29] so I can play it over and over I can get
[51:32] it for recently I've been feeling my
[51:35] wife here knows I've been telling her
[51:38] that the Lord was going to visit me with
[51:40] some way right away and it might have
[51:44] been that message this morning because
[51:47] it's give me a different view he gave me
[51:50] a text that I wish to speak on for a few
[51:52] moments I wish to read now out of the
[51:55] book of Exodus the 14th chapter and the
[52:01] 15th
[52:04] verse and the Lord said unto
[52:07] Moses wherefore criest thou unto
[52:11] me speak to the children of Israel that
[52:14] they go
[52:17] forward may I read the 16th
[52:21] also but lift up thy rod stretch
[52:25] out thine hand over the sea and divide
[52:28] it and the children of Israel shall pass
[52:31] on dry ground through the midst of the
[52:34] sea may the Lord add His blessings to
[52:37] the reading of his
[52:39] word and now let us bow our heads just a
[52:43] moment for
[52:45] prayer and if there's any people here
[52:49] that would like to be remembered in this
[52:51] prayer may you let it be known to God by
[52:54] an uplifted
[52:56] hand the Lord grant to you your
[53:00] desire Lord we now solemly and honorably
[53:06] and childlike walk on the sacred grounds
[53:11] of
[53:13] prayer we lay aside every weight every
[53:17] sin every
[53:18] thought that does so easily beset us
[53:21] that we might run with patience the race
[53:24] that's set before for
[53:26] us and as we move into these blessed
[53:29] sacred
[53:31] Sands of prayer knowing this that Jesus
[53:36] said ask the father anything in my name
[53:39] I'll do
[53:41] it and again it is written if ye abide
[53:46] in me and my word in you ask what you
[53:49] will and it shall be done unto
[53:53] you then we come
[53:56] Lord not in the name of this little
[53:59] church or in the name of its Pastor
[54:02] though we love them are not in our own
[54:06] name because we have nothing to offer
[54:09] through it but we come in that alls
[54:13] sufficient name of the Lord
[54:16] Jesus who gave us the promise that if we
[54:20] asked in his name we could receive
[54:22] whatever we asked
[54:25] and we would not want to ask anything
[54:28] that was a
[54:29] myth we would want to ask only that
[54:34] which would be pleasing to
[54:38] you you know our conditions you know
[54:41] what we have need of you know what this
[54:44] little church has need of and what each
[54:47] individual has need of we'd pray thee
[54:50] Lord God to give to us Sly as we have
[54:54] needs
[54:55] may the great Holy Spirit move down upon
[54:59] this building and around these people
[55:03] and sanctify this group that the Holy
[55:06] Spirit might have the ride away through
[55:08] every heart here tonight from the least
[55:11] of the children to the
[55:13] oldest granted Lord these hands that
[55:16] were lifted up you most surely seen them
[55:20] Lord if a sparrow can notot fall in the
[55:23] street without you knowing it how much
[55:26] more do you know when a child of yours
[55:29] lifts its hand towards heaven for a
[55:32] bread we are promised that it will not
[55:35] receive a stone
[55:37] instead we know that you shall give them
[55:40] the bread that they asked
[55:42] for and we would ask to remember all
[55:45] that's sick and
[55:46] Afflicted so glad to hear from Brother
[55:49] Rogers that he said he felt well enough
[55:51] to go to
[55:52] work we are so glad for that Lord
[55:56] praying that you will heal him that that
[55:59] cancer will not have the the right away
[56:02] but will be stopped by the blood of the
[56:05] Lord
[56:06] Jesus by faith we place the blood of the
[56:09] Lord Jesus
[56:11] between the death cancer and our
[56:16] bre now we ask for all that's needy
[56:19] everywhere get glory to thyself honor
[56:22] thy word Lord as we have read it and
[56:24] give us a great healing service for the
[56:27] glory of God we ask it in the name of
[56:30] the Lord Jesus
[56:35] amen for our text tonight I would like
[56:38] to use the three words
[56:42] why cry
[56:46] speak and for a subject I would like to
[56:50] use the attitude of people towards God's
[56:53] anointed
[56:55] just for a short time perhaps 20 minutes
[56:58] or 30 then we'll start the prayer
[57:03] line God had called
[57:06] Moses a special
[57:09] calling and when God calls a man and
[57:12] anoints him for a a certain Duty he
[57:17] expects that man to carry that out to
[57:20] the letter
[57:21] amen God doesn't want to give a man and
[57:25] a commission and him hum haul around
[57:28] about it he wants him to go straight
[57:31] forward and do just exactly what he's
[57:34] commissioned to do don't look right or
[57:39] left just move
[57:42] forward and the children of Israel had
[57:44] been in bondage for some 400
[57:48] years but God had promised that he would
[57:51] visit them and God keeps every every
[57:55] promise that he
[57:58] makes he cannot lie he's God
[58:02] am and the time had come for this
[58:08] visitation and I believe tonight
[58:11] paralleling that God made a
[58:14] promise that he would return
[58:17] again I believe that we are near that
[58:21] time
[58:23] amen this morning when I was speaking on
[58:27] that
[58:28] subject I could almost feel the the
[58:33] current as to saying that The Nearness
[58:36] of the Lord
[58:39] Jesus now Moses being called for this
[58:44] purpose but he was a man God trained him
[58:47] 80
[58:48] years before he ever was able to use him
[58:53] 40 years in the palace and 40 years in
[58:55] the
[58:56] wilderness God can train a man take him
[58:59] a hundred years for 30 minutes
[59:04] work God knows how to
[59:08] train what the schools had put in Moses
[59:11] 40 years had taken 40 years to get it
[59:15] out but one time in the presence of the
[59:19] anointing one time in the presence of
[59:23] the burning bush he know more about God
[59:26] than he' learned in books in the 80
[59:27] years of his
[59:30] life God trains his man then anoints him
[59:35] gives him experience takes him through
[59:37] the riged training down to the Sands of
[59:41] burning
[59:42] punishment trying testing not only does
[59:47] he do that to His prophets but he does
[59:49] it to his
[59:50] children every son that cometh to God
[59:54] must be chastened and tried
[59:56] amen tested by his word see when the
[1:00:01] pinch comes the strong time when it
[1:00:04] faces death are you able to stand there
[1:00:07] on the word of God say God said so that
[1:00:11] settles
[1:00:13] it and God had called such a man and
[1:00:16] that man was Moses but Moses a great de
[1:00:20] like us every time it come a place to
[1:00:24] something had to be done Moses called
[1:00:27] out oh Lord what must I do in this place
[1:00:30] now isn't that just like we
[1:00:34] do God had blessed him and anointed him
[1:00:37] above his Brethren give him a message
[1:00:40] and a Ministry that had not been on the
[1:00:42] earth since that day until that
[1:00:45] day and yet every time something taken
[1:00:49] place Moses run off to God with it Lord
[1:00:52] what must I do amen what must I do in
[1:00:55] this case God got kind of tired of it I
[1:00:58] believe he said why are you crying to
[1:01:02] me speak to the people and go
[1:01:06] forward if any time it ever looked like
[1:01:08] the ought to retreat was in but God has
[1:01:11] no
[1:01:13] retreat there's no place to retreating
[1:01:16] God go forward amen the doctor says it's
[1:01:20] cancer go forward if he says it's TV go
[1:01:23] forward
[1:01:25] if the devil says you can't give this up
[1:01:27] go
[1:01:28] forward if your home says that you're
[1:01:31] going to be a fanatic go
[1:01:33] forward the church turns you out go
[1:01:36] forward there's no retreating back go
[1:01:41] forward speak and go forward speak what
[1:01:45] his word and go forward bust say at the
[1:01:48] Lord and move
[1:01:50] on cry out to the people but the people
[1:01:54] then rebelled and said it have been
[1:01:57] better that we died down in
[1:02:00] Egypt it had been better that we had our
[1:02:02] Graves marked and from the hyenas and
[1:02:05] the vultures to pick our bones in this
[1:02:10] Wilderness why did you bring us out here
[1:02:13] after they had
[1:02:15] seen that God had a approve Moses to be
[1:02:19] his
[1:02:20] servant God when God comes into a person
[1:02:24] or to persons into a congregation into a
[1:02:29] man or a woman he vindicates his
[1:02:32] presence amen God proves that he's there
[1:02:35] while when God comes Supernatural signs
[1:02:38] begin to appear this person becomes a
[1:02:41] changed person they're not no more like
[1:02:44] they used to be sin has vanished from
[1:02:47] their life fear and doubt has vanished
[1:02:51] fluster there are solid stable live or
[1:02:54] die it's
[1:02:57] Christ they don't care what comes or
[1:03:00] what goes nothing shakes them they move
[1:03:03] forward and Moses Fred with the people
[1:03:07] and other the people Fred to Moses and
[1:03:09] he said what must we do and go forward
[1:03:13] what's the the answer now they said we
[1:03:17] are out in this Wilderness and the
[1:03:20] armies of pharaoh is approaching us
[1:03:23] they're Camp just behind behind us but
[1:03:26] Moses knew to obey God and if God sends
[1:03:31] a representative and he anoints this
[1:03:35] representative and sends it into the
[1:03:37] world the people must obey that
[1:03:39] representative amen it's always been
[1:03:42] that way all down through the Bible
[1:03:45] Moses is called for the job God has said
[1:03:48] in the word he would do it he promised
[1:03:51] that he would send such a a thing in
[1:03:54] that day to deliver him and God did his
[1:03:59] part sent Moses and the children of
[1:04:01] Israel just because little stumbles and
[1:04:03] things come along to
[1:04:05] try they fail to march with
[1:04:09] Moses Now isn't that just like today
[1:04:13] amen we see the message come forth we
[1:04:17] see the church rise to a place on the
[1:04:19] wings of the Holy Spirit until the power
[1:04:23] of God TRS every person in there the
[1:04:27] glory of God Falls around and signs and
[1:04:29] wonders take place less than a week
[1:04:32] Satan is permitted to come in that
[1:04:36] congregation why does he do it God
[1:04:38] permits
[1:04:40] it and then the church begins to murmur
[1:04:43] fall back maybe it wasn't so there's
[1:04:47] where we fail that's the failing of the
[1:04:50] church am regardless of what takes place
[1:04:53] it's God move
[1:04:55] forward well say there's brother so and
[1:04:57] so I shouted the victory with him but
[1:05:00] he's back no matter what he done that
[1:05:03] has nothing to do with
[1:05:06] you well so and so professor said that
[1:05:09] that wasn't right that wasn't of the the
[1:05:11] Lord no matter what professor said so
[1:05:14] you are the guy that stood on the sacred
[1:05:16] grounds you're the guy was at the
[1:05:18] burning
[1:05:19] bush what professors of Egypt what a
[1:05:23] pharaoh would have said to Moses oh you
[1:05:25] just imagine you seen a bush you thought
[1:05:28] you had a that's a roaring in your
[1:05:30] ears Moses knew where he stood Moses
[1:05:34] knew what talked to him and every man
[1:05:37] that's born of the spirit of God knows
[1:05:39] what talks to him when the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] comes it speaks of peace that passes
[1:05:46] understanding Moses was called he and
[1:05:49] God then after Moses receiving his call
[1:05:52] he went down to Egypt then he's got to
[1:05:54] get the people to believe
[1:05:56] him now he was the anointed prophet of
[1:05:59] the Lord but the people didn't believe
[1:06:02] him though he God proved it by signs and
[1:06:06] wonders that he did and because they
[1:06:09] didn't believe Moses the servant of the
[1:06:13] Lord then they fell in the wilderness
[1:06:16] and every one of them died that left
[1:06:19] Egypt not a one of them was saved
[1:06:22] everyone died perish beside Joshua and
[1:06:25] Caleb that started out because they
[1:06:29] murmured and complained against the
[1:06:33] Vindicated message that God had spoke in
[1:06:35] the
[1:06:39] Bible oh when I think of that when God
[1:06:43] promises anything God keeps his word
[1:06:47] amen and when God confirms that word to
[1:06:49] you then believe it God promised in the
[1:06:53] last days he' pour out his
[1:06:56] Spirit upon All Flesh I your young man
[1:07:00] would see Visions the old man would
[1:07:01] dream dreams upon my hands maids and
[1:07:04] Maid servants will I pour out of my
[1:07:06] spirit they show signs in the heavens
[1:07:09] and in the earth and great signs and
[1:07:10] wonders would take place in the last
[1:07:13] days and here we are in the last days
[1:07:16] and God's keeping his
[1:07:18] word the holy spirit's here and it
[1:07:22] vindicates the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:26] and the people turn it down and murmur
[1:07:28] against
[1:07:28] it just like it was that's our
[1:07:32] deliverance Moses was a the the
[1:07:36] signpost of the Deliverance of Israel
[1:07:40] according to God's word the time Drew n
[1:07:43] God sent Moses he was God's light for
[1:07:47] that day and today the time's drawing
[1:07:50] now atomic bombs are ready the world's
[1:07:53] going to be blown to Pieces pretty soon
[1:07:56] ashes all over the Earth nothing but
[1:07:58] volcanic ashes the time is at hand and
[1:08:01] God promised he'd pour out his spirit
[1:08:03] and take his church out and the Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost is here representing that with
[1:08:08] signs and wonders proving that he is the
[1:08:11] same Jesus Christ in the form of the
[1:08:13] Holy Ghost doing the same work that he
[1:08:15] did when he was here on
[1:08:17] Earth blinds the people the gospel
[1:08:21] always blinds the people if they don't
[1:08:23] open their eyes
[1:08:24] you either walk or it blinds the
[1:08:27] people yes every case in the Bible when
[1:08:31] God sent a messenger and that messenger
[1:08:34] was received there was a Revival in that
[1:08:37] time but if it was not receive there was
[1:08:40] no Revival but just chaos followed the
[1:08:43] unbelief and so is it today nothing less
[1:08:47] I think today I like to make mention of
[1:08:50] one woman that I think of in the Bible
[1:08:53] and she was bad to begin with rotten to
[1:08:58] the core a young beautiful woman by the
[1:09:01] name of
[1:09:03] Rahab she was a heathen to start
[1:09:06] with and she was a prostitute on the
[1:09:11] street but she heard that there was a
[1:09:16] God not an idol that set dumb or a
[1:09:20] declaration of Creeds amen but a God who
[1:09:23] lives among his people and anointed them
[1:09:26] and signs and wonders was fallowing them
[1:09:30] she heard about it one day two
[1:09:33] Representatives come to
[1:09:35] Jericho and quickly her on the street as
[1:09:38] a prostitute she called him took them
[1:09:41] into her house said they're after you
[1:09:44] and she hid them and I like her
[1:09:48] attitude she never said I'll believe
[1:09:52] when I see the Great anointed Joshua do
[1:09:55] some sign if I could have seen Moses do
[1:09:59] some of the signs I would have believe
[1:10:02] but she said I have
[1:10:06] heard Faith cometh by hearing hearing of
[1:10:10] the word I have heard that the god of
[1:10:14] Heaven who is the real
[1:10:17] God is with you
[1:10:19] all and he's done great signs and
[1:10:23] wonders he dried up the Red
[1:10:25] Sea he brought Flags upon Egypt we see
[1:10:29] how you turned the enemy over to your
[1:10:31] hands and our whole country is trembling
[1:10:34] because of it I'm asking
[1:10:37] Mercy amen she didn't say I'll have to
[1:10:40] see this God first let me take my
[1:10:43] judgment and take what my scripture says
[1:10:45] about that and see she never found it
[1:10:48] but Faith cometh by hearing hearing the
[1:10:51] word of God and and she
[1:10:55] believed and when these words were
[1:10:57] brought back to Joshua the word Joshua
[1:11:00] means savior like Jesus died oh it
[1:11:03] brought back to Joshua God's anointed
[1:11:06] her house was permitted to stand and
[1:11:09] when the people marched 13 times around
[1:11:12] the walls of Jericho and sounded the
[1:11:14] trumpet every place on that wall fell
[1:11:18] but her
[1:11:19] house because she believed before she
[1:11:22] seen anything am she accepted it she
[1:11:26] said they're Servants of the most high
[1:11:29] God and I will receive it up on the
[1:11:32] basis of hearing it I believe it Faith
[1:11:36] cometh by
[1:11:38] hearing she heard it she believed it she
[1:11:41] accepted it I noticed they said bind
[1:11:45] this Scarlet string that you let us down
[1:11:48] with binded in the window that red spoke
[1:11:52] of the blood of Jesus there moment and
[1:11:55] every place in that wall fell but
[1:11:58] rahab's house it set on top of the wall
[1:12:02] God honored her and he she saw as great
[1:12:05] a miracle performed there as it was
[1:12:08] drying up the Red Sea for the hand of
[1:12:11] Jehovah was over that little place to
[1:12:13] protect it she had accepted
[1:12:17] it God's anointed God's servants went
[1:12:20] over there anointed and she believed it
[1:12:24] before she seen Miracles she believed it
[1:12:26] anyhow and accepted it
[1:12:30] Elijah the prophet of the Lord
[1:12:34] anointed oh yes God anointed him to be
[1:12:37] prophet he was Pastor
[1:12:40] Elijah I don't imagine Jezebel would
[1:12:42] have wanted to call him that but he was
[1:12:45] her pastor just the
[1:12:48] same God made him her
[1:12:51] pastor so she hated him and God told him
[1:12:56] said you go up on the mountain and you
[1:12:58] sit down there I've commanded the crows
[1:13:01] to feiji I'll Water you from the brook
[1:13:04] sedr and he sat down there and the King
[1:13:09] said go get that fanatic and bring him
[1:13:11] down here and the soldiers all armed
[1:13:15] with the command of the king they start
[1:13:17] up the hill and Elisha probably raised
[1:13:19] up and said something like this
[1:13:22] gentlemen this is a holy spot I've been
[1:13:26] called of God to be his Prophet amen
[1:13:30] he's commissioned me to stand on these
[1:13:33] grounds and Proclaim his message amen
[1:13:36] and the message that I have for you
[1:13:37] don't you approach this
[1:13:39] ground
[1:13:42] amen stay off of here the
[1:13:45] uncircumcised have you not read when
[1:13:47] Moses the servant of the Lord crossed
[1:13:50] over the river and the uncirc cised
[1:13:53] tried to impersonate him they all
[1:13:55] drowned him stay off of this ground oh
[1:13:59] they said that old quack what school is
[1:14:01] he from we'll go in anyhow Elijah said
[1:14:05] if I be a man of God let fire fall from
[1:14:09] Heaven and vindicate my Ministry and
[1:14:12] about that time fire fell and burn up
[1:14:16] 50 the king might have said lightning
[1:14:19] struck him so he sent another 50 and the
[1:14:21] same thing happened
[1:14:24] unbelief man who Mock and scoff and make
[1:14:28] fun of the anointed Church of the Living
[1:14:30] God Shall Perish someday in a
[1:14:34] Hell won't only be burning for a few
[1:14:36] minutes it might be a long
[1:14:40] time so it's holy
[1:14:42] grounds God's anointed stands on there
[1:14:46] no uncircumcised or unclean thing can
[1:14:49] enter that
[1:14:51] spot that is true
[1:14:54] if the impersonators try to act like
[1:14:56] that they're doing it you'll find out
[1:14:58] they'll soon come to not but what does
[1:15:02] the impersonators vindicate that there
[1:15:04] is a
[1:15:05] real there's a real God there are some
[1:15:08] people who want say they don't believe
[1:15:10] it but they want to act like they
[1:15:11] believe it but a person that knows God
[1:15:15] is a man that's born again of the Holy
[1:15:17] Ghost and fill with the power of God
[1:15:20] with a thus sayith the Lord and goes
[1:15:22] forward they know something has struck
[1:15:24] their heart they know that they're
[1:15:27] right so Elisha was a man of God
[1:15:31] anointed that they did not believe look
[1:15:34] at David when he sat with Nathan the
[1:15:36] prophet David a man after God's Own
[1:15:39] Heart and he was the Anointed God
[1:15:42] anointed him King David was not only a
[1:15:45] king but he was a
[1:15:47] prophet so Nathan was the great prophet
[1:15:51] of the nation David is more like l a
[1:15:53] poet and a prophet songwriter
[1:15:57] musician and prophecy really in its
[1:16:01] original is more like a a song when they
[1:16:06] prophesy then one day while the prophet
[1:16:10] and the King was sitting together David
[1:16:12] said it's not right for me to live in a
[1:16:16] house of Cedar in the ark of my God
[1:16:18] under a
[1:16:20] tent and I want you to listen the
[1:16:22] notable words of Nathan he said
[1:16:26] David oh don't fail to get this down get
[1:16:29] between the
[1:16:31] lines David do all that's in your heart
[1:16:34] for God is with
[1:16:37] you oh my why I think of that David do
[1:16:42] all that's in your heart for God's with
[1:16:45] you why cry to me God's with you speak
[1:16:49] and go forward amen God's anointed you
[1:16:52] move on on don't him hul around say this
[1:16:56] that or the other should I believe God
[1:16:58] should I trust him for this trust him
[1:16:59] for every breath that you
[1:17:02] draw it was the great General Stonewall
[1:17:05] Jackson who's been my favorite General
[1:17:08] since Joshua away Stonewall Jackson was
[1:17:11] asked one time how can you
[1:17:15] stand with just a handful of man when
[1:17:19] the opposition is so great that's how he
[1:17:21] got his name of stone wall he would not
[1:17:25] budge he know no
[1:17:28] retreat what could we accredit a man
[1:17:31] like that too a man when the Yankees
[1:17:35] come down by the thousands and he stood
[1:17:37] there in the minority but they never mov
[1:17:40] him he stood like a stone wall all the
[1:17:43] rest of the Rebel Army had retreated
[1:17:45] back lions come along said what's the
[1:17:47] matter with Jackson why isn't he going
[1:17:49] he said he stands like a stone wall
[1:17:53] that's where he got his
[1:17:55] title the other generals asked he said
[1:17:57] Mr Jackson little bitty fell blackheaded
[1:18:00] and blue eyed only is about 5 foot two
[1:18:02] inches tall very modest mild speaking
[1:18:05] little fell said Mr Jackson how can you
[1:18:09] stand in such opposition bash like he
[1:18:12] kicked his boot on the ground he said I
[1:18:14] never take a drink of water unless I
[1:18:17] thank God for it first that's where it
[1:18:20] is there's no retreat in God speak and
[1:18:23] go
[1:18:25] forward right that's God's commission to
[1:18:27] his church we have no time to slap they
[1:18:31] say the Revival is over it isn't
[1:18:34] over for it's time that Pentecost is
[1:18:37] played out it isn't it's time for
[1:18:40] Pentecost to rise in the name of Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ and go forward there's no retreat
[1:18:45] there's no stand on the same ground
[1:18:47] let's move with the spirit or the spirit
[1:18:50] will move on to somebody else and leave
[1:18:52] you standing
[1:18:54] you follow it do all that's in your
[1:18:56] heart for God is with you when Jesus
[1:19:00] came the Bible said Peter said on the
[1:19:03] day of Pentecost Jesus of Nazareth a man
[1:19:07] approved of God among you how by signs
[1:19:11] Miracles and wonders which he did in the
[1:19:13] midst of you all for you all yourself is
[1:19:16] a witness to this what was he he was a
[1:19:21] signwork one anointed I know placees
[1:19:25] said Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of
[1:19:29] God among you God's approval is upon him
[1:19:33] how did he approve him by signs wonders
[1:19:37] Jesus said if I do not the works of my
[1:19:39] father then don't believe
[1:19:43] me but if I do the works of my father
[1:19:46] then believe the works if you can't
[1:19:47] believe me as a man in other words he
[1:19:50] said if you can't believe I'm I'm he you
[1:19:52] will perish in your
[1:19:54] sins but if you don't believe me at
[1:19:56] least believe the works that I
[1:20:00] do oh he was approved of God by signs
[1:20:04] Nicodemus well expressed it when he came
[1:20:06] Ben night and he said good
[1:20:09] Master we know that there a teacher come
[1:20:12] from God amen amen amen they couldn't
[1:20:16] hide
[1:20:18] it we know that you're a teacher come
[1:20:21] from God for no man can do the things
[1:20:23] that you do the works that you do L God
[1:20:26] was with him they realized that he was
[1:20:29] approved of God anointed of God he was
[1:20:32] God's servant the church had to
[1:20:35] recognize it though they hated him they
[1:20:38] called him a devil they tried to find
[1:20:40] all kinds of
[1:20:43] excuses but when it come to face of
[1:20:45] facts they believe that he was the
[1:20:47] anointed one but they thought more of
[1:20:49] their tradition and they did the
[1:20:51] anointing of God Amen
[1:20:53] many and women today will join some
[1:20:55] social standings in the church join some
[1:20:58] intellectual group because they love to
[1:21:01] get into intellectual sections when they
[1:21:04] know that the spirit of God has life and
[1:21:08] movesen Christ is the same yesterday
[1:21:10] today and forever and the way he was
[1:21:12] then that's the way he is now and will
[1:21:14] be
[1:21:16] forever and the messenger of God is here
[1:21:20] the Holy Ghost to reject his death to
[1:21:23] receive it his
[1:21:25] life approve how does people accept it
[1:21:29] how the Holy Spirit has one message
[1:21:32] speak the word go
[1:21:35] forward that's right don't cry to me
[1:21:38] there's the
[1:21:39] word speak it and move forward thus
[1:21:42] sayith the
[1:21:43] Lord that's the message of the Holy
[1:21:45] Ghost now the people begin to
[1:21:48] murmur they fail we don't want to murmur
[1:21:52] what is The Works that Jesus did he said
[1:21:54] my Works declare me my Works proves who
[1:21:57] I am my Works vindicates me when God
[1:22:01] sent Moses The Works Vindicated him when
[1:22:05] God sent Elijah The Works Vindicated him
[1:22:08] when God anoints a man his Works
[1:22:10] vindicate him when God sent the Holy
[1:22:13] Ghost in This last days The Works
[1:22:17] Vindicated jining a church jining an
[1:22:21] organization accept the the creeder of
[1:22:23] Doctrine if that's the Holy Ghost then
[1:22:25] there has always been a holy ghost in
[1:22:27] all kinds of
[1:22:28] religions but this Holy Ghost has to be
[1:22:31] the same holy ghost that it was back on
[1:22:33] the day of Pentecost Arts not that same
[1:22:36] Holy
[1:22:37] Ghost has to never change it's the same
[1:22:40] Spirit it has to live
[1:22:43] forever Jesus said the works that I do
[1:22:46] he that believeth on me St John
[1:22:48] 14:7 he that believeth on me the works
[1:22:51] that I do shall shall he do also amen he
[1:22:55] that believeth on me amen no man can
[1:22:59] believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of
[1:23:01] God until he's received the Holy Ghost
[1:23:04] you're only taking it by faith and
[1:23:06] accepting it you can't say that it is
[1:23:09] you can say I believe it is but no man
[1:23:12] can call Jesus the Christ until the Holy
[1:23:14] Ghost is in him the Bible said so the
[1:23:17] Holy Spirit has come in first then it
[1:23:19] gives a witness you know yourself that
[1:23:21] Jesus is the Christ Because He Lives in
[1:23:23] You
[1:23:25] amen then that same Holy Spirit
[1:23:27] introduces himself to the people and
[1:23:29] these signs shall follow them that
[1:23:32] believe and the church laughs at it and
[1:23:34] makes funs of it we're just living in
[1:23:36] that day the the atmosphere getting
[1:23:39] charged up for an atomic bomb for
[1:23:43] judgment the church is getting ready for
[1:23:45] a Rapture we're waiting anticipations
[1:23:48] waiting the church is waiting the coming
[1:23:50] of the Lord the world is a shaking
[1:23:52] Wonder which one's going to get the bomb
[1:23:53] first to the other one we don't care
[1:23:55] which one gets there we're going here so
[1:23:58] it doesn't matter which one gets there
[1:24:00] it doesn't have a thing to do with us
[1:24:02] we're just rejoicing happy believing it
[1:24:04] one day we'll hear a sound from heaven
[1:24:06] and here he'll
[1:24:08] come and his church will be caught up in
[1:24:10] the air to meet him and be with
[1:24:15] him he that believeth on me the works
[1:24:17] that I do shall he do also Peter said
[1:24:20] Jesus of Nazareth a prophet anointed
[1:24:25] anointed and
[1:24:26] approved of God among you all which you
[1:24:30] all yourself
[1:24:31] know the Bible said also that God
[1:24:35] anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy
[1:24:36] Ghost that he went about doing good
[1:24:38] Healing The
[1:24:40] Sick that was a sign that he was what he
[1:24:43] claimed to be that's the way God sends
[1:24:46] it that's the way it's supposed to come
[1:24:48] in the last days and the Holy Spirit
[1:24:50] that comes in the last days isn't to
[1:24:52] draw us to a Creed is to draw us to a
[1:24:54] church is to draw us to God and
[1:24:57] Supernatural signs is to follow that
[1:24:59] holy spirit
[1:25:01] amen what is the signs of the Holy
[1:25:03] Spirit if Jesus of Nazareth was a man
[1:25:06] approved of God Anointed with the Holy
[1:25:09] Ghost let's see what kind of a message
[1:25:11] he had what did he do how did he act see
[1:25:16] his action then we can follow his
[1:25:18] actions we find it when he first come on
[1:25:21] through his Ministry at the age of 30
[1:25:23] when he was anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:25] the first thing he did he met a man by
[1:25:28] the name of of Peter and he told him
[1:25:31] said your name is Simon and you're the
[1:25:34] son of Jonas and he believed in me why
[1:25:38] Moses had spoke before his time and he
[1:25:41] said the Lord your God shall rise a
[1:25:43] prophet just like
[1:25:45] me that'll be the sign you'll know he'll
[1:25:48] be a god Prophet that Messiah will be
[1:25:51] both God and prophet and he'll do the
[1:25:54] sign of a
[1:25:56] prophet when he does like the Jews today
[1:25:59] Lou Petra sent over a million Bibles to
[1:26:01] those Jews New Testaments that come from
[1:26:04] down in the other parts of the world and
[1:26:05] never heard of Jesus been down there for
[1:26:07] 2500 years they begin to read that New
[1:26:11] Testament and they said if this be the
[1:26:14] Messiah we know the Messiah will be a
[1:26:16] god Prophet if this is the Messiah and
[1:26:19] he's not dead but he's alive again let
[1:26:21] us see him do the sign of the Prophet
[1:26:23] we'll believe
[1:26:25] him for our our Messiah is a god
[1:26:30] Prophet Jesus said when he met Peter he
[1:26:33] said your name is Simon and your
[1:26:35] father's name is Jonas and Peter fell at
[1:26:39] his feet Lord he knew that that was who
[1:26:43] was spoke of strictly away went they
[1:26:46] went after Philip went for Nathaniel and
[1:26:49] told him what he had found and when
[1:26:50] Nathaniel come up before he he said
[1:26:52] there's an Israelite in whom there's no
[1:26:54] God said Rabbi when did you ever know me
[1:26:57] he said before Philip called you when he
[1:26:59] R the tree I saw
[1:27:01] you he said you are the Son of God
[1:27:05] you're the king of Israel they knew who
[1:27:08] that was that Samaritan when she said
[1:27:11] when he said bring me a drink that woman
[1:27:14] the nation of
[1:27:15] Samaria so said bring me a drink said
[1:27:19] it's not customary for you some uh you
[1:27:21] Jews to ask Samaritans such things as
[1:27:23] that I'm a woman of Samaria he said but
[1:27:26] if you knew who you were talking to You'
[1:27:29] ask me for a drink I'd give you water as
[1:27:32] you don't come here to draw the
[1:27:34] conversation went on for a while till he
[1:27:36] saw where her troubles was he said go
[1:27:39] get your husband and come here she said
[1:27:41] I have no husband he said that's right
[1:27:44] you've had five and the one you're

[1:33:46] Jesus in US amen so we can believe that
[1:33:50] word from
[1:33:53] few announcements and then a prayer
[1:33:56] request when brother George Smith was
[1:33:59] here he um talked about the books that
[1:34:04] he had was working on the church age
[1:34:06] book and then this seal book and so
[1:34:10] there was a few brothers that have
[1:34:12] requested it specifically I'll make sure
[1:34:14] they get a copy of that that's there
[1:34:16] it's in the back there there's a few
[1:34:18] copies of that exposition of church age
[1:34:23] the uh resume of the seven Church
[1:34:26] ages and
[1:34:28] um Christian baptism this is really good
[1:34:31] I really like that so those are in the
[1:34:33] back there he had did something for the
[1:34:37] Sunday for the kids it's a little walk
[1:34:40] with me coloring book I know some of the
[1:34:43] brothers in South Africa really enjoyed
[1:34:45] that I don't know how many of the Saints
[1:34:48] have it or know it he only sent one copy
[1:34:52] but if that's something you want more of
[1:34:54] then he would definitely send that to us
[1:34:58] so those are there's a cop a list of
[1:35:00] those in the back or a number of those
[1:35:02] in the back
[1:35:04] um a reminder sub uh Sabino February the

[1:35:18] that send her a text just so they can
[1:35:20] get the number together there's a
[1:35:22] reminder I think you need to get back

[1:35:26] the date is on that text but as soon as
[1:35:28] possible if you're interested in going
[1:35:31] and then also this Sunday morning
[1:35:33] brother bill lingard will be here
[1:35:35] speaking for us and Sunday night brother
[1:35:39] Ferguson will be with
[1:35:41] us and next week Wednesday the 21st

[1:35:48] well so Sunday night Wednesday night
[1:35:50] brother Ferguson Sunday morning will be
[1:35:53] brother Bill
[1:35:55] lingar
[1:35:57] amen all right and so just to give you a
[1:36:00] little update on when we uh about the
[1:36:04] church the group in Phoenix There
[1:36:06] Brother Art so we move that service
[1:36:09] there from Wednesday to Thursday night
[1:36:12] and the Saints here are welcome to go
[1:36:14] and be a part of
[1:36:15] that they streamed the service here on
[1:36:18] Sunday morning um brother sister
[1:36:22] Carpenter and the Carpenters have been
[1:36:24] coming to the hotel and then they opened
[1:36:26] it up for open their Church up for us to
[1:36:31] to meet there on Sunday mornings and uh
[1:36:36] Sunday nights and Thursday nights and so
[1:36:40] um normally I'll go down or brother
[1:36:43] George he's not here tonight we'll go
[1:36:45] down on the Thursday night to have
[1:36:48] service with the group that's in Phoenix
[1:36:50] and so when we say pray that's what
[1:36:53] we're talking about pray for that group
[1:36:55] there and they
[1:36:58] would obviously love to see you Saints
[1:37:01] there as well U for that service but
[1:37:04] pray that the Lord will just um lead and
[1:37:07] guide on how to proceed and continue to
[1:37:10] serve that group another little group in
[1:37:13] the San Carlos reservation brother
[1:37:15] Wills um olifant goes there and he calls
[1:37:19] this his home Church
[1:37:22] that was placed on his heart to go there
[1:37:24] and so um Sister Jesse Lynn and Caleb
[1:37:28] they'll go there and do the music for
[1:37:30] them on Sunday morning they have one
[1:37:32] service and we do what we can to help
[1:37:36] them um I haven't been there myself but
[1:37:39] brother George has been there a number
[1:37:41] of times brother Josh has been there
[1:37:43] this last time one of the visiting
[1:37:46] brothers that come through the city for
[1:37:48] the Trevor we sent him there and and so
[1:37:52] um it's a missionary work it's a
[1:37:56] ministry that's always been there and
[1:37:58] we' like to see the Lord bless them and
[1:38:00] help them and we just don't know how um
[1:38:05] brother Will's not here tonight but um
[1:38:08] he's been praying about how to go about
[1:38:11] helping the little group there and I you
[1:38:14] know we made oursel available to them
[1:38:16] and so the church
[1:38:17] has been a part of that and but pray for
[1:38:22] the full Direction on how what the Lord
[1:38:25] wants to do for those folks
[1:38:27] there also there is a
[1:38:31] um our Sunday school our adult Sunday
[1:38:34] school is
[1:38:36] um for us to hear the word and we're in
[1:38:40] the second seal and so we take 20
[1:38:43] minutes for the adult Sunday school and
[1:38:45] so during the week you can listen to
[1:38:48] that anytime and just get familiar with
[1:38:51] that seal and then we come here uh we
[1:38:54] can't listen to it all but we just
[1:38:56] listen to a portion of it and God always
[1:38:59] speaks to us during that time so that's
[1:39:01] what the adult Sunday school is and you
[1:39:03] can just background it with listening to
[1:39:05] that message and um in your own private
[1:39:09] time or tape time so when you come
[1:39:11] together you can really get more out of
[1:39:14] that adult Sunday school service and so
[1:39:18] those little Ministries like our men's
[1:39:20] prayer meeting
[1:39:21] that we have here on Saturday it's not a
[1:39:24] a must but it kind of just developed
[1:39:27] into where we meet here on Saturday
[1:39:29] mornings um just the men only and
[1:39:35] someone said what about the sisters well
[1:39:36] they can do it in their home so they can
[1:39:40] meet at you know they can get up at
[1:39:42] whatever time they would get up 5 or 4
[1:39:45] and we pray from 5: a.m. to 6 that's on
[1:39:48] a Saturday that just came it just
[1:39:51] developed and it's a Ministry of this
[1:39:54] church and we just try to serve as we as
[1:39:57] we can you you just you know sometimes
[1:40:01] we always asking the Lord Lord what
[1:40:02] should I do Lord what should I do but
[1:40:04] like on the just him and H around you
[1:40:07] just do what you're supposed to do do
[1:40:09] what you know to do and God opens the
[1:40:10] doors and he'll bless it so that's a
[1:40:12] little
[1:40:13] Ministry you know that's you know that's
[1:40:16] Saturday and then we're here Sunday then
[1:40:18] we're here Wednesday then Thursday

[1:40:22] Phoenix Thursday and if our door opened

[1:40:28] would go there too and so it's whatever
[1:40:31] the door the the amen would you pray for
[1:40:34] me or would you so at least pray all
[1:40:36] right so maybe you don't understand it
[1:40:39] all together and I don't either but the
[1:40:41] Lord works it out we walk follow the
[1:40:44] motive of objections of your heart and
[1:40:46] the Lord sees that when we went to
[1:40:48] Phoenix and started there
[1:40:51] um I contacted the pastors that I'm in
[1:40:54] fellowship with and they know exactly
[1:40:56] what's going on whether adonius has sent
[1:40:59] ministers there to preach for us when we
[1:41:01] couldn't go and so
[1:41:04] um you continue to pray for that work
[1:41:07] but that's a Thursday night service for
