[41:03] side to the mosm Beek and Malawi
[41:06] different places like that they you got
[41:09] a family over there you got brothers and
[41:11] sisters over there you've never met
[41:12] maybe and maybe I'll be able to share a
[41:15] little bit with you tonight and get a
[41:17] few visuals and some testimonies it'll
[41:19] be kind of like a shotgun service
[41:22] because I I don't have anything I really
[41:24] want to focus on but uh it's always the
[41:27] thing for a preacher is you know to try
[41:29] to to try to get the mind of the Lord
[41:32] and something that would help you amen
[41:34] so I think just sharing some of the
[41:36] mission work would help you to see uh
[41:39] you know what the faith the faith that
[41:41] is around the world that same faith we
[41:44] have amen so God bless you and we'll
[41:47] take our Bibles tonight and we'll turn
[41:49] to Isaiah chapter 6 you want this one

[42:43] do we want to just pray once more father
[42:46] before we read your word Lord anyone can
[42:49] open the Bible and read from it but it

[42:54] real to us and father tonight we're just
[42:57] humbly asking Lord that you'll come and
[42:59] Quicken your word to our hearts and
[43:01] father and forgive us of our wrongs our

[45:32] Uzziah died I also saw the Lord sitting
[45:35] on the throne high and lifted up and his
[45:37] train filled the temple now do you know
[45:39] what the prophet said the train
[45:43] was Angels right angels He said that his
[45:47] train the Greek says the skirt but it
[45:50] was the Angels following him in the
[45:53] temple and above it stood the seraphim
[45:56] each one had six wings with TW he
[45:58] covered his face with Twain he covered
[45:59] his feet and with Twain he did fly and
[46:02] one Cried unto another and said holy
[46:05] holy holy is the Lord God of the Lord of
[46:08] hosts the whole earth is full of his
[46:10] glory and the posts of the D doors moved
[46:13] at the voice of him that cried and the
[46:15] house was filled with smoke imagine what
[46:18] an
[46:19] atmosphere when we come into that
[46:21] Holiness amen not just blessing but that
[46:25] atmosphere
[46:26] God may it be tonight that would come
[46:29] into that atmosphere of angels then I
[46:32] said woe is me for I am undone because
[46:35] I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in
[46:37] the midst of a people of unclean lips
[46:39] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[46:41] Lord of hosts then flew one of the
[46:43] seraphim unto me having a live coal in
[46:45] his hand that he had taken from the
[46:47] tongs from off the Altar and he laid it
[46:49] upon my mouth and said Lo this has
[46:51] touched thy lips and thy iniquity is
[46:53] taken away thy sin is purged praise God
[46:57] Amen aren't you glad for that we had
[47:00] something that purged our sin that
[47:02] cleansed our lips and we can speak God's
[47:05] word also I heard the voice of the Lord
[47:07] saying whom shall I send and whom will
[47:09] go for us then said I here am I send me
[47:15] may the Lord bless his word you may be
[47:17] seated as you're seated I'll just read
[47:19] from Mark
[47:22] 16 uh chapter uh 16: 15 and he said unto
[47:27] them go into all the world and preach
[47:28] the gospel to Every Creature he that
[47:31] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[47:33] he that believeth not shall be damned
[47:36] and these signs shall follow them that
[47:38] believe in my name they shall cast out
[47:40] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[47:43] they shall take up serpents and if they
[47:45] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[47:48] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[47:50] and they shall
[47:52] recover amen it's still the same gospel
[47:56] we're believing Jesus Christ is the same
[47:59] yesterday today and forever amen and I I
[48:02] just want to reinforce that so A so then
[48:07] after the Lord had spoken unto them he
[48:10] was received up into heaven and sat on
[48:12] the right hand of God and they went
[48:14] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[48:16] working with them and confirming the
[48:18] word with signs following amen that
[48:22] we're we're not following after signs
[48:25] but signs follow us the signs of the
[48:29] Gospel follow us the supernatural signs
[48:32] follow us amen today I believe it's uh
[48:35] what is it Super Bowl
[48:37] Sunday but this is Supernatural Sunday
[48:40] amen for us I'd rather be here in the
[48:43] house of God than in any Super Bowl Amen
[48:46] to be here with the supernatural God
[48:49] Among Us all things are possible all
[48:52] things are possible amen and and we we
[48:55] we only limit god wow but if we we we
[48:58] just all things are possible whatever
[49:01] our needs are tonight the Holy Ghost can
[49:04] meet those needs I I wonder if the
[49:06] brother could just put that up quickly
[49:07] and we'll go through a few slides we'll
[49:09] see what our time is like uh this is the
[49:13] continent of Africa so you see how many
[49:17] countries are in this continent the USA
[49:20] is in there China India big Nations and
[49:25] all the rest of them France Spain
[49:28] Germany uh all all those countries so
[49:31] it's a
[49:32] vast continent that you know the prophet
[49:36] said he wanted to get in there and seow
[49:39] Seed in there and it just seems like
[49:42] that's where the SE seed today still
[49:45] it's the the harvest is still
[49:48] ripe amen the the the fields are ripe
[49:52] onto Harvest and we think well it's
[49:54] passed no it's not pass past people are
[49:57] still coming here in North America it's
[50:00] different in in our in our situation but
[50:02] over there it just by the
[50:06] thousands you know and so uh it it you
[50:10] can get lost here for your
[50:13] lifetime brother ly you could be lost
[50:16] for your lifetime it
[50:18] just a vast continent and it takes more
[50:21] than one you know it's not not just our
[50:24] little group it takes all all of us
[50:26] together you do a little work here you
[50:29] do a little work there everybody chips
[50:31] in amen and we find that last
[50:33] predestinated seed so we can get out of
[50:35] here we can go home amen isn't AR aren't
[50:39] you hungry for home I I just want to go
[50:42] home now oh I just come Lord Jesus I
[50:46] mean you know I was walking down here in
[50:48] your streets in Tucson and I was looking
[50:50] at that place where JC Penney used to be
[50:52] and the prophet had that vision of souls
[50:54] in prison and I thought what would he
[50:56] see
[50:58] today as I walked the streets what I saw
[51:02] I thought you know hell has
[51:04] surfaced and but you know there's a
[51:07] promise in the word the same with Jesus
[51:09] he wouldn't leave his soul in Hell
[51:12] neither would he suffer his holy one to
[51:13] see corruption we're living in an age
[51:17] when he will not leave us he will not
[51:20] and there'll be people that will not see
[51:22] corruption there'll be people that whose
[51:25] bodies will be changed I want to be one
[51:27] of them I want to be one of them that's
[51:31] the mark That's the high calling if he
[51:33] takes me he takes me but I'd want to be
[51:35] one of
[51:36] them Hallelujah we got a promise next
[51:39] slide that's the continent there so we
[51:42] were down on the east side of Africa
[51:44] this last time and uh it's uh more
[51:48] towards Mosen Beek right down there at
[51:50] the bottom your right hand side Mosen
[51:53] Beek and then Malawi is just a thin
[51:55] strip there it's a small country Malawi
[51:58] but it's landlocked and and there's a
[52:01] lot of Believers in there and uh you
[52:03] know they call that the warm heart of
[52:06] Africa because the people are really
[52:08] soft they're they're you know you get
[52:10] some Nations they're militant Nigeria or
[52:13] you know some other countries they're
[52:15] more militant but in in Malawi it's just
[52:17] a
[52:18] softness and it just uh uh the warm
[52:21] heart of friendly uh way you know so
[52:24] it's it's nice to go there uh next
[52:27] slide uh that's the road to some of the
[52:30] villages and into Mosen Beek and uh next
[52:34] slide uh you see these bikes along the

[52:41] you'll have a brother and a and and his
[52:43] wife on the back of a bike or a man and
[52:46] a woman and and they tell me that if you
[52:48] don't have a bike over there in some of
[52:50] the villages you don't get a wife no
[52:52] bike no wife so a bike is is very
[52:56] important over there CU they just go for
[52:59] miles and and they they carry their
[53:01] goods and things so but it's a it's a
[53:04] it's a beautiful country next slide
[53:07] these are some of the missionaries that
[53:08] I work with over there in in Malawi and
[53:11] uh the the front one is a is an
[53:15] evangelist the more evangelist and their

[53:34] into the country so next slide this this
[53:38] is their parents they're some of the
[53:39] Pioneers that are in the message in
[53:42] Malawi they're and they they both their
[53:45] sons preach and uh they uh they have
[53:49] quite a testimony too and just uh
[53:53] they've been such uh pillars in
[53:55] and you know I don't know but uh I I
[53:59] consider them like my
[54:01] parents in the gospel and uh the sister
[54:04] there she has great testimony uh she you
[54:08] know she's just a simple woman but I've
[54:10] known them for years and years and I was
[54:13] just sitting down last year with them
[54:16] fellowshipping and we were talking about
[54:18] how God provides and Jehovah Gyra and
[54:20] she said Brother Martin she said I once
[54:23] once one time I wanted to go to Zimbabwe
[54:26] for special meetings and Convention some
[54:29] of ministers from America were going and
[54:31] I didn't have the money but I sold cakes
[54:33] on the side and she said I when I sold
[54:36] these cakes I made enough money to get
[54:38] an airline ticket and go and she said I
[54:41] was so blessed but she said then I
[54:44] worried because it took her like I
[54:46] forget how long it took her like two
[54:48] months or three months to make enough
[54:50] and then she said I worried about how I
[54:52] was going to have meet an's meat at when
[54:55] I got back and she said you know the
[54:58] flower I used she said when I went into
[55:01] the kitchen to use the flower she said
[55:04] it never went below half of the the
[55:08] can I just thought what you never said
[55:12] anything like that before like she's
[55:14] just a quiet quiet sister but she she
[55:16] said God and she said I had all the all
[55:20] my sales in two weeks the money came
[55:23] back wow and it took her months to get
[55:26] it but in two weeks she had all of it
[55:29] she sold twice as many cakes so just a
[55:33] little thing you know but uh that's the
[55:35] type of they're Faith people they they
[55:38] just believe and that and that's the
[55:41] kind of people you like to be around you
[55:43] know they're they're they just rubs off
[55:45] on you right so next slide uh there are
[55:49] some of the books that we've been

[56:33] generation has come up and there's a
[56:35] generation that doesn't know about

[1:01:49] know some Basics just the basic things
[1:01:52] that's what they needed so we we went
[1:01:54] ahead and just loaded up the truck and
[1:01:56] headed out and just went for seven days
[1:01:59] straight all over the the southern
[1:02:02] region so it was just you know when I
[1:02:04] look back on it it wasn't easy at the
[1:02:07] time but when I look back on it I I
[1:02:09] think I'm so glad that I went I'm so
[1:02:14] glad and they were so glad that someone
[1:02:17] came someone actually came to their
[1:02:20] Village like and thought about them cuz
[1:02:23] the government s of you know forsakes
[1:02:26] them and there's political stuff over
[1:02:27] there too that the some people get
[1:02:30] preference over others and Believers see
[1:02:33] we were concentrating on Believers if a
[1:02:35] brother or
[1:02:37] sister the household of faith do good
[1:02:39] always to the household of faith you
[1:02:42] know and uh you can't feed everybody you
[1:02:44] can't help everybody but you could help
[1:02:47] some Believers and so you know it's a
[1:02:50] it's a cust so we loaded up the truck
[1:02:52] and went to these Villages next
[1:02:55] slide and some of the widows were were
[1:02:58] on the you know on the Forefront the
[1:03:00] widows indeed you know help them first
[1:03:03] as much as you can so we did that and
[1:03:05] stopped along the way uh next slide and
[1:03:10] uh this little brother here he he's I
[1:03:12] call him brother Watchman because I had
[1:03:14] a nice watch and it was a red face on it
[1:03:18] and when he saw that watch he really
[1:03:20] liked it he really liked it so I gave
[1:03:24] him the watch and so I call him brother
[1:03:27] Watchman I said brother Watchman he's
[1:03:30] he's he was a pastor in that little
[1:03:32] little group there now that's that's not
[1:03:34] many people there we're not looking for
[1:03:37] crowds we're looking for the last
[1:03:39] elected seat that's what we're looking
[1:03:41] for we're not looking at you know one of
[1:03:44] the meetings there there was over 5,000
[1:03:46] in a meeting but you know these type of
[1:03:48] things I really enjoy I really enjoy
[1:03:53] next slide yeah and that's some of the
[1:03:55] brothers with brother Harrison at his at
[1:03:57] his home he runs a small contracting
[1:04:00] company and uh you know he he puts a lot
[1:04:04] of his own living into this he's he's
[1:04:07] not there with his hand out he's not
[1:04:10] sending emails he's not he's not that
[1:04:12] type of guy he's just God will supply
[1:04:15] and God has blessed his
[1:04:17] business so much that he's able to feed
[1:04:21] a lot of people put on special me
[1:04:24] meetings have brothers from America and
[1:04:27] Canada come next
[1:04:29] slide this is Through the Jungle from ma
[1:04:32] Malawi to Mosen Beek and they didn't
[1:04:35] want to go through the border so they
[1:04:37] said well we'll just take the shortcut
[1:04:38] to Mosen Beek and I said well that's you
[1:04:40] guys know the country but it was rough
[1:04:43] it was a rough Journey it wasn't uh yeah
[1:04:46] it was 4x4 Journey that's for sure and
[1:04:49] then you'd meet some guys on the field
[1:04:51] and they'd have a big machete out like
[1:04:52] this you know and you're think H you
[1:04:56] know it look kind of iffy but they're
[1:04:58] cutting wood in there and they make
[1:05:00] coals out of it so come to find out that
[1:05:04] uh you know if you were caught on that
[1:05:07] road you'd go to
[1:05:09] jail because you're crossing the border
[1:05:12] without going through the border control
[1:05:15] but they didn't tell me
[1:05:17] that and we we met one brother in there
[1:05:21] he he was there and he he got caught he
[1:05:25] was he slipped over from Malawi side to
[1:05:28] mosm Beek and was cutting the wood he
[1:05:30] got caught he spent two years in jail in
[1:05:32] mosm Beek a
[1:05:35] brother he paid for that one and I said
[1:05:38] two
[1:05:39] years whoa that would have been a long
[1:05:43] jail sentence and so I said I kind of
[1:05:46] reprimanded them a little bit I said
[1:05:47] don't do that to me again I don't want
[1:05:51] to end up in jail here or some Ransom
[1:05:53] you know so anyway it was a it was a
[1:05:56] nice Journey uh it was a rough Journey
[1:05:58] oh there's a video I didn't know I
[1:06:00] didn't know that I had some videos but
[1:06:03] uh so that is the road through the
[1:06:06] jungle and uh it's not yeah you just you
[1:06:10] feel sorry for the
[1:06:12] cars you just hurt for the cars because
[1:06:15] rang bang you know and okay so there
[1:06:18] that's the one that's ahead of us and we
[1:06:20] met some people on that were cutting
[1:06:23] wood there
[1:06:25] anyway uh yeah see you can see the
[1:06:28] basket they just make coals out of it
[1:06:31] they burn it make coals and then sell it
[1:06:33] commercially so they make a living off
[1:06:35] that next
[1:06:36] slide so we got to some of the remote
[1:06:39] Villages and uh you know we we talk
[1:06:42] about homeless people
[1:06:44] here you know these are homeless people
[1:06:47] these are the real homeless people
[1:06:48] because sometimes our homeless people
[1:06:51] I'm not saying all of them but some of
[1:06:53] them they don't want a home
[1:06:54] yeah it's all over North America it's in
[1:06:57] our city we we can give them a nice warm
[1:07:01] place a shower food everything they want
[1:07:03] but they don't want it they don't want
[1:07:06] it but these people they they take
[1:07:08] anything that you give them that they do
[1:07:11] anything to get a little help so next
[1:07:14] slide uh that that on the side there
[1:07:17] that's a house that was a house just a
[1:07:20] it's just a thing of mud so next slide
[1:07:24] and some of the some of the places that
[1:07:27] we you know we we we we did a big
[1:07:30] spreadsheet and we did our costs and we
[1:07:33] we we did the whole thing out what it
[1:07:34] would cost and you know it was just it
[1:07:37] was it was too huge it was too big next
[1:07:40] slide they're still suffering from it
[1:07:43] and some of the some of the families
[1:07:45] there and uh next
[1:07:48] slide that's all that's left you know of
[1:07:52] a little place next slide
[1:07:55] yeah yeah next
[1:07:57] slide and this this place we got to late
[1:08:00] at night but uh they lost a lot they
[1:08:03] lost the their whole house and
[1:08:05] everything but they came out you know
[1:08:07] when we came they came out and they were
[1:08:09] worshiping with us and singing and
[1:08:12] smiling happy and I'm thinking what's
[1:08:16] wrong with this like this would not be
[1:08:18] us but they were joyful in the Lord like
[1:08:21] they the Lord will supply Lord will do
[1:08:24] it he's the Creator you know and I just
[1:08:27] think wow that that helps me because you
[1:08:31] know it helps me to you know to realize
[1:08:33] that God is Jehovah Gyra and the joy of
[1:08:37] the Lord is our strength no matter what
[1:08:40] happens to us amen next slide now this
[1:08:44] is a family that is got to be I don't
[1:08:47] know 300 Square ft maybe that that Hut
[1:08:51] or that little Shack they had that's the
[1:08:53] whole whole family and they all fit in
[1:08:57] there they cook outside there there's no
[1:09:00] kitchen but they all sleep in there and
[1:09:02] and uh and they were just standing there
[1:09:04] on that muddy thing and I thought yeah I
[1:09:08] thought these are these are really the
[1:09:10] homeless people that we if we can help
[1:09:13] you know in any way so we we did and uh
[1:09:17] but they still haven't recovered next
[1:09:19] slide that's a church that was gone and
[1:09:23] uh
[1:09:24] from the floods that they lost it and
[1:09:27] they wanted to rebuild so they use their
[1:09:29] own labor they make their own bricks and
[1:09:32] uh you know they just need a little help
[1:09:34] here and there to get going and we went
[1:09:37] and then uh they asked me to lay the
[1:09:39] Cornerstone so I next slide I laid the
[1:09:42] Cornerstone and that church is back up
[1:09:44] now fully built I didn't have the slide
[1:09:46] with me but it's back up fully built and
[1:09:49] uh they're in it worshiping again so you
[1:09:52] know what it means I I know I heard you
[1:09:54] you're you're in a maybe building
[1:09:56] program here or look for you know what
[1:09:58] it means you you want you want a
[1:09:59] building for the people of God you know
[1:10:02] and and and charity let me say this
[1:10:04] charity begins at home you look after
[1:10:07] yourself you look after the flock and
[1:10:10] then if there's anything else you know
[1:10:13] and God puts it on your heart then do
[1:10:14] what you can but it's uh you know the
[1:10:18] the kingdom of God the prophet said was
[1:10:20] not operated by money right it's
[1:10:24] Faith it's faith God our God is a
[1:10:28] Creator he can create money he can
[1:10:32] create things I've seen him create
[1:10:35] things over there I've seen him create
[1:10:38] money like a million
[1:10:41] dollars in a moment in five
[1:10:45] minutes and and that that's what we
[1:10:47] believe that's the kind of God we
[1:10:49] believe that's what we're taught to
[1:10:52] believe amen the spoken word is the
[1:10:55] Original Seed amen and that's still
[1:10:58] happening amen these signs shall follow
[1:11:01] them that believe the dead are still
[1:11:04] raised the blind still see amen there's
[1:11:07] cripples I I I mean remember sister she

[1:11:43] simple you know they used to call me
[1:11:45] Simple Simon when I was a
[1:11:47] kid because you know I was just a simple
[1:11:50] way you know but you know God makes
[1:11:53] makes you the way you are for a reason
[1:11:57] so you know tell sometimes God hidden
[1:11:59] and revealed in
[1:12:02] Simplicity you know we get too
[1:12:04] complicated Our Lives get too
[1:12:05] complicated but anyway this might help

[1:16:32] didn't I didn't want to come down but I
[1:16:34] needed $2,000 I figured for my trip and
[1:16:39] I thought you know I I couldn't get it I
[1:16:41] I had a hip operation this this year I
[1:16:43] was four months before that and four
[1:16:46] months recovering so I was out of work
[1:16:48] and I thought well I can't do that and
[1:16:51] and I had a I don't know what what it
[1:16:53] was but I saw a hand write
[1:16:57] $2,000 and the next day there was $2,000
[1:17:00] in my bank account from someone that
[1:17:03] doesn't believe the
[1:17:06] message there was $2,000 this this what
[1:17:09] I saw and I thought you know because I
[1:17:13] wanted to do it for the Lord I want to
[1:17:15] share what's going on for the Lord so
[1:17:18] the Lord said I'm going to do it and
[1:17:20] I'll use someone that doesn't believe to
[1:17:21] do it God is able to these stones to
[1:17:25] raise children under Abraham he's able
[1:17:27] to you know and I don't believe in
[1:17:29] pulling for money I don't believe in it
[1:17:32] God I believe he's a Creator God is a
[1:17:35] Creator and he can he can create the
[1:17:38] right atmosphere he can he can influence

[1:21:20] see them give what they can
[1:21:23] right they they got something to give
[1:21:26] you know and that's the circuit Rider
[1:21:28] preacher there on the motorbike I mean

[1:21:31] that he's happy you know he gets enough
[1:21:33] money for his gas and that's him and his
[1:21:36] wife there in their in their area and we
[1:21:40] had service in their area under a tree
[1:21:43] there was a great crowd of people
[1:21:44] because the the church was was washed
[1:21:47] away so we were there and we had some
[1:21:50] testimony meeting there man it was just
[1:21:52] just a wonderful time and uh a couple of
[1:21:55] the deacons got up and they were
[1:21:57] testifying they said Brother Martin when
[1:21:59] you were here 5 years ago or or 10 years
[1:22:02] ago he's at this meeting certain meeting
[1:22:04] then I gave my heart to the Lord and I
[1:22:07] started serving the lord from that time
[1:22:09] and I just thought oh man I didn't know
[1:22:11] I did that he said that was that was you
[1:22:14] that was you were preaching and that's
[1:22:16] when I give my heart to the Lord so see
[1:22:18] and then someone someone here sent me so
[1:22:23] we're all connected so we all have a
[1:22:25] part and it's a chain amen and it's and
[1:22:29] we'll see it by and by we'll see it on
[1:22:31] the other side amen next slide that's
[1:22:35] the circuit ride preacher amen that's
[1:22:37] his motorbike and uh I think that's it
[1:22:40] next slide maybe oh that was the that
[1:22:42] was the that was the the chief of that
[1:22:46] Village we got there late at night
[1:22:49] excuse me and uh we made a mistake there
[1:22:51] because you can't do that kind of work
[1:22:55] at night and we were just too many
[1:22:57] places to go too far distances we're
[1:23:00] trying to get to everybody but it got
[1:23:02] dark and next slide we were in this it
[1:23:05] was just getting dark and so uh brother
[1:23:08] Harrison was speaking to the people and
[1:23:10] you know uh establishing in them on the
[1:23:13] message preaching the message
[1:23:16] establishing them on that and uh so as
[1:23:20] it grew darker we had the food all in
[1:23:21] the center as it grew darker other
[1:23:24] people from other Villages you know word
[1:23:26] gets around and they came around and
[1:23:28] they were watching and looking and as it
[1:23:30] got dark they they just uh mobbed us you
[1:23:35] know we got we got enough we got the
[1:23:37] majority of food out to the to the
[1:23:39] Saints there at the needy church but by
[1:23:42] the time it was you know just about over
[1:23:45] they just they just come in from every
[1:23:47] side and they just pushed everybody out
[1:23:48] of the way because you know what I
[1:23:50] wasn't mad I you know we made a mistake
[1:23:54] it wasn't them they got children too
[1:23:57] they're hungry too and what would you do
[1:23:59] if you had five children and there was
[1:24:01] food in the village that nobody else
[1:24:03] knew you're going to go down there
[1:24:06] you're going to go down there and see
[1:24:07] what you can get you know I'm not saying
[1:24:09] it's right but I don't I didn't feel any
[1:24:12] animosity I might do the same
[1:24:14] thing so anyway when those big guys when
[1:24:18] the big deacons and stuff they couldn't
[1:24:20] hold them off we just Run for the car he
[1:24:24] said Martin go run get in the car let's
[1:24:26] get out of here cuz they were big guys
[1:24:29] next next slide this is a church we
[1:24:32] helped uh it's by the the ocean and
[1:24:37] uh it it had a real testimony uh the
[1:24:40] Pentecostals in that area were
[1:24:42] persecuting them because they believed
[1:24:45] in a prophet and in the message and they
[1:24:47] were persecuting them and tried to get
[1:24:50] them in jail and different things so um
[1:24:54] we were able to help them a little bit
[1:24:56] they didn't want to see this church
[1:24:58] built and so I mean look at the roof
[1:25:00] look at the that's what they had for
[1:25:02] water like when it rains you just can't
[1:25:05] I remember being in the back room there
[1:25:07] with a lantern at night one of those
[1:25:09] lanterns you know the oldfashioned
[1:25:11] lanterns studying with a lantern and I
[1:25:15] just thought no
[1:25:16] electric and uh so came home I think
[1:25:20] maybe some of you have seen this before
[1:25:22] I'm not sure but there was a sister in
[1:25:25] our a little sister in our church she
[1:25:27] worked in a coffee
[1:25:28] shop and uh she was saving for a car and
[1:25:32] she gave what she had she this just
[1:25:35] touched her heart and she she gave all
[1:25:39] what she had and she put a roof on that
[1:25:41] building by
[1:25:44] herself and she left the
[1:25:47] car you know that's
[1:25:50] testimonies testimony of faith and God
[1:25:54] blessed her God really blessed her for
[1:25:57] it too you can't you can't out give God
[1:26:00] Amen you can't do it so anyway that next
[1:26:03] slide this is the same
[1:26:04] church that's the same church wow look
[1:26:08] at that a little bit little bit here
[1:26:11] from a CH little bit there this sister
[1:26:13] that brother you know and that's what
[1:26:15] happened he's so proud of his
[1:26:17] church oh man he's just there's his
[1:26:20] bicycle and real testimony in the
[1:26:22] village next slide and that's me and my
[1:26:25] wife because you know God calls a man he
[1:26:28] calls his wife and I wouldn't be able to
[1:26:31] go so it's uh what time did we
[1:26:36] start 20 oh don't say that brother I'll
[1:26:40] be here all night testifying but uh you
[1:26:44] know we read in uh we read in Isaiah I
[1:26:48] think that's yeah that's brother
[1:26:50] Harrison and and Dyson again uh just
[1:26:53] some offerings we gave them and next
[1:26:55] slide is that
[1:26:57] it that's it that's it thank
[1:27:00] you so we were talking about what
[1:27:03] influences us to do these things where
[1:27:06] where is our influence coming from amen
[1:27:09] is it is it to build a kingdom to you
[1:27:12] know uh say what we
[1:27:15] did right I did this I did that we
[1:27:18] printed so many books we did this it's
[1:27:21] not that way you know it's it's it we
[1:27:24] didn't publicize it and uh we don't have
[1:27:27] a magazine or you know not really
[1:27:30] supported much but you know what God
[1:27:33] that's when you see go you see God in
[1:27:35] your need that's when you see God and
[1:27:39] we're just not needy enough sometimes
[1:27:42] when we're needy that's when we're going
[1:27:43] to see him that's when he's going to
[1:27:45] come on the scene amen so uh maybe God
[1:27:49] will speak to someone here tonight who
[1:27:52] shall I
[1:27:54] send you know there's a few gray hairs
[1:27:57] up here brother Po and and you know I've
[1:27:59] got a few battle
[1:28:01] scars from the from the journey and uh
[1:28:04] different things that happened and you
[1:28:06] know when you're sick in Africa or
[1:28:08] you're you're just about to die you know
[1:28:10] it's a long ways from
[1:28:12] home but you know if God sent you he'll
[1:28:15] take care of you amen and he'll bring
[1:28:17] you home amen but I did say you know one
[1:28:22] time there I said if I die here I don't
[1:28:25] want to go in no hospital but if I die
[1:28:27] here I said you can bury me right
[1:28:29] here and and don't don't my wife just
[1:28:33] doesn't agree with that but uh you know
[1:28:36] don't don't do the expense because I'm
[1:28:37] going to come
[1:28:39] up right from that African
[1:28:42] dirt I'm going to come up we're going to
[1:28:44] come up Saints we go that way we're
[1:28:47] going to come up doesn't matter where we
[1:28:48] are we're going to come up so yeah so uh
[1:28:53] on that in that order uh what is
[1:28:56] influencing
[1:28:57] us where's our influence where's our
[1:29:00] greatest influence coming coming from
[1:29:02] you know I was thinking about Isaiah and
[1:29:04] the temple there and the the influence
[1:29:07] of
[1:29:08] angels and uh you know there in the
[1:29:12] order of angels I'm not a teacher but
[1:29:16] I've read the message a long time I've
[1:29:18] studied the message there's different
[1:29:20] orders of angels there's Ezekiel so it's
[1:29:23] the four living creatures and the
[1:29:25] prophet said he said they're Angels but
[1:29:27] they're not
[1:29:29] Angels but then he said but they are
[1:29:32] angels so I'll figure that one out see
[1:29:36] you got to know the language just what
[1:29:38] he's saying so you know the the four
[1:29:40] anointings the four living creatures
[1:29:42] they were anointings for all those ages
[1:29:45] and they were influencing that age the
[1:29:48] lion the the ox The Lion The Man The
[1:29:50] Eagle right they were in influences and
[1:29:52] they were they were anointings or living
[1:29:55] creatures and uh you know you you you
[1:29:57] can break that down and get into the
[1:29:59] into the order of angels living
[1:30:01] creatures there's archangels there's
[1:30:03] Michael there's Gabriel there's W
[1:30:04] wormwood you know there's the throne
[1:30:06] guards there's cherubims there's
[1:30:09] seraphim there's healing Angels there's
[1:30:11] protecting Angels there's Guardian
[1:30:13] Angels there's there's uh messenger
[1:30:17] Prophet messenger
[1:30:18] Angels you know you know you know like
[1:30:21] it says in Hebrew 2 Hebrews 2 how shall
[1:30:24] we escape if we neglect such a great
[1:30:27] salvation you know for the word spoken
[1:30:30] by angels and the prophet said there
[1:30:31] that's not Heavenly Angels that's
[1:30:33] Prophet Messengers the word spoken by
[1:30:36] Elijah was steadfast would never change
[1:30:39] it would come to pass amen so he said
[1:30:43] how will we escape how could we escape
[1:30:46] Saints amen you know the problem
[1:30:50] is the problem is we're predestinated
[1:30:53] we're
[1:30:54] elected that's the problem because we're
[1:30:57] not getting out of this see that's the
[1:31:00] problem you know I tried to run from the
[1:31:02] ministry I didn't want to get in the
[1:31:04] ministry and then I tried to run from it
[1:31:06] and I paid
[1:31:07] dearly but you don't have a
[1:31:10] say we don't have a say we don't have a
[1:31:13] thought
[1:31:14] coming God's elected predestinated us to
[1:31:17] sit here in this time in this age under
[1:31:20] this anointing
[1:31:22] under this Eagle anointing under this
[1:31:24] message and we can't do nothing about it
[1:31:27] so we might as well go with it we might
[1:31:30] as well run with it amen and and I'm a
[1:31:32] firm believer don't don't try to go to
[1:31:35] Ecuador until you go next door right
[1:31:38] right go next door I was on the bus
[1:31:42] Saturday and met these two Street
[1:31:45] Preachers and man I was getting it from
[1:31:47] both ends just they were preaching and
[1:31:50] preaching to the bus and brother Arie
[1:31:52] knows he talked to the brother today and
[1:31:55] uh you know we just come on out come on
[1:31:59] out to service they showed up this
[1:32:01] morning you know that's all your respon
[1:32:04] come and see don't have to explain the
[1:32:07] message don't have to explain anything
[1:32:09] come and see get him in front of the
[1:32:11] preacher get him in this atmosphere amen
[1:32:14] that's all we have to do invite someone
[1:32:17] do some missionary work right here amen
[1:32:21] and and we used to do that more but you
[1:32:23] know we've kind of cooled off and we we
[1:32:26] think well we're just waiting for the
[1:32:28] Rapture we're just waiting for the
[1:32:29] Rapture but there's something for us to
[1:32:32] do Amen brother and you know he the
[1:32:35] prophet said one time he was praying for
[1:32:36] a child that was really crippled bad and
[1:32:39] and he felt so sorry for the child and
[1:32:41] he said Lord what are you going to do
[1:32:42] about this and the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:32:44] back said what are you going to do about
[1:32:46] it wow what are you doing about
[1:32:49] it it's up to us it's in our hands amen
[1:32:54] uh so in in that order of angels we want
[1:32:58] to be influenced by another realm and I
[1:33:01] I really believe we're under the
[1:33:04] administration of Angels in this age the
[1:33:07] administration and influence of angels
[1:33:09] we're under a we're under an angel
[1:33:12] Messenger to the age it's it's all it's
[1:33:15] all about that God's sending
[1:33:18] Messengers and we're under that so uh on
[1:33:21] these uh you know the scripture says be
[1:33:23] not be not
[1:33:26] uh now have to read it but don't be
[1:33:29] afraid to entertain
[1:33:31] strangers uh Hebrews 13 unaware for some
[1:33:36] have under entertain angels unaware
[1:33:39] don't don't be afraid to entertain
[1:33:40] strangers me because sometimes you know
[1:33:44] you are an
[1:33:46] angel we are angels we don't realize it
[1:33:49] but we are an angel to someone the
[1:33:50] prophet said you're you're an angel to
[1:33:52] someone you're a messenger we're all
[1:33:55] Messengers so you know we we don't uh
[1:33:58] think of that sometimes and you know as
[1:34:01] I as I just you know see uh the
[1:34:04] condition of our our churches we need to
[1:34:07] be more LED of the spirit
[1:34:10] individually it's not a church
[1:34:12] Revelation it's not a group Revelation
[1:34:15] you need to be led do what God leads you
[1:34:17] to do you don't have to go to Africa you
[1:34:20] don't have to go on the street and you
[1:34:21] don't have to do this that but you might
[1:34:23] be the hand you you might be your prayer
[1:34:28] I remember a woman in a hospital in in
[1:34:30] Canada we I was waiting for my
[1:34:32] brother-in-law to pray pray with him he
[1:34:34] had epilepsy and uh this older lady kept
[1:34:38] looking at me and I'm in the hallway and
[1:34:40] I'm just you know how that is sometimes
[1:34:41] you're just shy you're just you know she
[1:34:45] kept looking at me and just kept looking
[1:34:47] at me and and she waved and I I waved
[1:34:50] back and then something was just saying
[1:34:52] go talk to her go talk to her I didn't
[1:34:55] want to talk to her I didn't know she's
[1:34:57] a
[1:34:57] stranger and and I just felt you know
[1:35:01] I've learned you better obey right you
[1:35:03] better obey that still Small Voice now
[1:35:06] I'm just giving you some
[1:35:08] testimonies but you know I went in there
[1:35:10] how you doing and what are you in here
[1:35:12] for and and uh oh they got they getting
[1:35:15] me ready for the Boneyard she said you

[1:35:20] it's terminal she said older lady I said
[1:35:23] well you know there's a God that
[1:35:26] heals there's a God that heals I said
[1:35:28] and do you believe that yeah well yeah
[1:35:31] so I started talking to about healing
[1:35:33] and and uh so we talked and uh I said
[1:35:37] would you mind if I pray with you no not
[1:35:39] at all so we I prayed for her and and
[1:35:42] just a simple old lady now there's a
[1:35:44] Ministry there that's a mission field
[1:35:48] hospitals
[1:35:50] prisons any there's there's a Ministry
[1:35:52] there not for all of us don't feel
[1:35:55] guilty but if God puts it on your heart
[1:35:57] and you got you want to do something for
[1:35:59] God there's lot you can do so anyway we
[1:36:03] we had prayer and I I thought it was
[1:36:04] Christmas time and I thought well she
[1:36:06] was all alone there there wasn't a card
[1:36:08] there wasn't a flower there wasn't
[1:36:10] nothing so I thought well I'll just
[1:36:12] bring her something and went back up to
[1:36:14] see my brother in-law the next day and
[1:36:16] talked to her she said you know what
[1:36:18] yesterday when you
[1:36:19] prayed she said I said yeah I thought
[1:36:22] maybe God touched her she said I said
[1:36:25] did did you did you do you feel better
[1:36:27] she said no feel the same I said well
[1:36:31] what happened she said something changed
[1:36:35] here she said something in my heart
[1:36:38] changed she might have been bitter she
[1:36:40] might have been angry she might have had
[1:36:42] family issues she might we don't know
[1:36:44] but you know you're the only Christ that
[1:36:47] some people will ever see right so I
[1:36:50] just I just rejoiced in that and I said
[1:36:52] well you know I got some literature on a
[1:36:54] a man that was sent sent to pray for the
[1:36:56] sick would you like would you like a
[1:36:57] book and I had a I had a book with me
[1:37:00] that it was how the angel came to meise
[1:37:03] God and I just picked it up and I just
[1:37:05] said would you well are you are you are
[1:37:08] you a Mormon are you Jehovah Witness I
[1:37:10] don't I don't want any of that I said no
[1:37:13] no this is just a man that was sent to
[1:37:15] pray for pray for PE pray for God's
[1:37:18] people said okay I'll take it so she
[1:37:21] took okay next day I come back or two
[1:37:23] days no it was the very next day cuz she
[1:37:26] said I'll read it tonight and I got back
[1:37:28] and the and the nurse on the ward said I
[1:37:31] said U did you move so and so and she
[1:37:34] said no she she she passed last
[1:37:37] night and I thought the last book that
[1:37:40] she read was how the angel came to
[1:37:45] me you know I don't I'm not the judge
[1:37:49] she could went right into the presence
[1:37:51] of the Saints because she believed right
[1:37:54] there the thief on the cross it just
[1:37:57] takes a minute just to accept it and so
[1:38:01] I thought praise God you know I'm so
[1:38:05] glad I listened to that
[1:38:08] angel that was there speaking to me you
[1:38:11] know the prophet said the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:13] an
[1:38:15] angel and he said you have an angel we
[1:38:18] all have an angel right from birth
[1:38:20] everyone has an angel from birth but the
[1:38:22] elect have an Angel that's a word body
[1:38:26] you have a word body Genesis 1:26 God
[1:38:29] created you in the beginning Spirit man
[1:38:33] he created you a theophany but you
[1:38:35] bypass that and you came right to the
[1:38:38] flesh to be tempted amen and tried oh my
[1:38:42] when it's over Saints that's all this
[1:38:45] testing and trying all these trials amen
[1:38:48] all all these all these things that fall
[1:38:50] upon us it'll be worth it all it it's
[1:38:54] nothing to compare amen when we get
[1:38:57] there it's just a breath away and so we
[1:39:00] were uh you know I was thinking of that
[1:39:02] the you know the seraphim the cherubims
[1:39:06] the the the archangels and what what uh
[1:39:10] Isaiah experienced there you know and I
[1:39:12] and I and I just started looking at the
[1:39:14] message and reading about that and and
[1:39:16] just things started to come out you know
[1:39:19] I want to finish with this quick here if
[1:39:22] I can take another 10 minutes can I take
[1:39:24] another 10 minutes and I'll try to shut
[1:39:26] it down uh I talked to you know uh a few
[1:39:31] Brothers about this because I you know I
[1:39:33] don't you know there's there's things
[1:39:35] that we don't understand uh but you know
[1:39:38] there's glimpses if we read the message
[1:39:41] we feed on the message there's glimpses
[1:39:43] in there that puts it all together and
[1:39:46] uh you know Paul spoke about it uh about
[1:39:49] our our Celestial body bodies
[1:39:52] terrestrial bodies in 1 Corinthians 15
[1:39:55] and the difference because Paul was
[1:39:57] caught up to the third
[1:39:59] heaven but we've had a messenger in this
[1:40:03] day that went under the altar the sixth
[1:40:06] Dimension and told us what was
[1:40:09] there you know we are so privileged
[1:40:11] Saints and it's laying in the message
[1:40:15] it's laying there and uh so just when we
[1:40:18] have need of it and I believe we have
[1:40:19] need of this now
[1:40:21] because you know we're expecting a
[1:40:24] resurrection that therefore that that
[1:40:26] theophan he has to come and pick up this
[1:40:28] body
[1:40:29] amen right and and become a glorified
[1:40:32] body so we're at that time now and uh we
[1:40:36] should be feeling the pull from our home
[1:40:39] on high amen Paul said if this Earthly
[1:40:42] Tabernacle beat usol we have one waiting
[1:40:46] prepare it in the heavens Amen in 2
[1:40:49] Corinthians 5:1 I can take take time to
[1:40:51] go through the scripture like I said in
[1:40:53] Matthew 18 and10 take heed that you
[1:40:55] despise none of these little ones for
[1:40:58] there I say unto you that in heaven
[1:41:00] their Angels do always behold the face
[1:41:02] of My Father which is in
[1:41:04] heaven and the prophet quoted that many
[1:41:07] times and he said we have and then he
[1:41:10] said if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:41:12] dissolved all refers to what Paul said
[1:41:15] we have one waiting in the heavens
[1:41:18] prepared and so you know everyone has an
[1:41:21] angel so we got to be careful how we
[1:41:24] treat each other and speak to each
[1:41:28] other and we've all made those
[1:41:32] mistakes but uh referring to Acts
[1:41:34] chapter 8 in the Hebrew
[1:41:37] series The Prophet uh and I won't put it
[1:41:40] up but just read it to you chapter 3
[1:41:44] he's talking about when Peter was in
[1:41:46] jail we heard it this morning and uh in
[1:41:49] them days he said there was a little
[1:41:50] draw bar draw bar and you raised it up
[1:41:53] to look out in the prison for you for
[1:41:56] you let your guest to come in no this
[1:41:58] was in the house said you had a draw bar
[1:42:01] in your house and you looked to see who
[1:42:02] was coming in and uh Peter had been put
[1:42:05] in jail and the angel of the Lord came
[1:42:07] and leted him out of
[1:42:09] jail amen amen that's that brings
[1:42:13] testimony to my mind but God can get you
[1:42:15] out of jail too devil put you in jail
[1:42:18] but God can get you out of jail so he he
[1:42:21] said he's talking about Peter and when
[1:42:24] he the angel Lord takes him out he goes
[1:42:26] to John Mark's house and and they're
[1:42:27] they're there and Roa goes to the door
[1:42:29] and you know it's it's Peter and she
[1:42:31] says you know she just shuts the door
[1:42:33] and leaves him standing outside you just
[1:42:35] look to oh it's Peter and then she runs
[1:42:37] in talks to them well they thought she
[1:42:39] she's mad no she affirmed it's Peter
[1:42:42] they said well no it must be his
[1:42:45] Angel his angel now Prophet picks it up
[1:42:48] he said they said oh no no that's his
[1:42:51] Angel standing there he done got into a
[1:42:54] glorified B you know that that theophany
[1:42:56] part you remember how that we took that
[1:42:59] that big diamond out there and then he
[1:43:01] says if this Earthly Tabernacle beol be
[1:43:04] dissolved we have one waiting and they
[1:43:06] thought Peter had done died and this old
[1:43:09] body had dropped and they buried it in a
[1:43:11] few and they'll Buri it in a few days he
[1:43:13] entered into his
[1:43:15] Angel the prophet he entered into his
[1:43:18] Angel we all have an angel
[1:43:21] a theophany and he and he and they say
[1:43:24] angel and the prophet says Angel here he
[1:43:27] said he entered into his angel or his
[1:43:29] and then he says glorified not glorified
[1:43:32] he said his
[1:43:34] theophany my you got it up there God
[1:43:37] bless you guys's are
[1:43:39] quick yeah he he he but in his theophany
[1:43:43] the body that's already prepared it
[1:43:45] couldn't shake hands see it had to be
[1:43:48] they thought it was theophany but it was
[1:43:50] Peter
[1:43:51] but uh Saints it's time for these things
[1:43:55] to be made more real to us amen and we
[1:43:58] we ought to be expecting yes sir we
[1:44:01] ought to be expecting that body that new
[1:44:04] body uh and and that influence and
[1:44:07] listen listen to that
[1:44:09] influence um I'm going to skip a few
[1:44:11] scriptures
[1:44:12] here um in Hebrews the Hebrew series is
[1:44:16] full of this there's a lot in there
[1:44:19] about our other body and angels and uh
[1:44:24] see uh Jesus the prophet said was A
[1:44:28] Spoken
[1:44:29] Word by the prophets a virgin shall
[1:44:32] conceive right he was a spoken word
[1:44:35] Gabriel said to Mary you will have a son
[1:44:38] right so he was a spoken word so he he
[1:44:41] he he was not born by sex desire so he
[1:44:44] bypassed that theophany we all know that
[1:44:46] I'm not trying to teach you now just
[1:44:48] kind of sharing with you a little
[1:44:50] influence here right amen uh so he by we
[1:44:56] bypassed that he came straight from the
[1:44:58] the attribute the thought the logos and
[1:45:01] became flesh he was a spoken word where
[1:45:06] we came by sex desire we came by the
[1:45:08] flesh to be tempted and tried so that's
[1:45:11] why the prophet said Jesus went to hell
[1:45:13] and preached to the souls in
[1:45:15] prison in that in that theophany
[1:45:18] form so he was barred from the
[1:45:21] resurrection until for 3 days until all
[1:45:23] the word was
[1:45:25] fulfilled and so are we barred from the
[1:45:28] resurrection till all the word is
[1:45:31] fulfilled amen and the prophet said I
[1:45:34] see nothing I see no scripture that
[1:45:37] needs to be fulfilled all I see is the
[1:45:39] Readiness of the
[1:45:42] Bride it's all been fulfilled I'm not
[1:45:45] looking for something to happen it's
[1:45:48] happened it's already happened happened
[1:45:51] we just need to catch it we need to
[1:45:52] catch up and catch it amen and if you
[1:45:56] catch it amen just and and just be
[1:45:58] simple just don't try to strain don't
[1:46:01] try to make anything big about it just
[1:46:03] be simple God you'll reveal it but be
[1:46:07] sensitive amen see
[1:46:10] uh that's that's where we're at see and
[1:46:13] the prophet said in
[1:46:15] the in this message who is this
[1:46:19] mzc he said you're not a hybrid at all
[1:46:22] he said you're an eagle he's an eagle
[1:46:25] then after you recognize the very word
[1:46:27] of God was Eagle food then you left the
[1:46:29] other thing and you've been formed into
[1:46:30] the image of the Living
[1:46:32] God how were you made in the beginning
[1:46:34] you were made Spirit man so that's
[1:46:37] coming together now in this Dimension
[1:46:40] and he said when you heard that eagle
[1:46:43] scream he said then you heard from your
[1:46:47] theophany amen how many have heard from
[1:46:49] their the
[1:46:51] amen you heard if you believe this
[1:46:53] message I mean if you really believe
[1:46:55] this message is a revelation in your
[1:46:57] heart you heard from your theophany
[1:46:59] that's the only thing that could reveal
[1:47:00] it to you amen so and you don't just
[1:47:04] hear
[1:47:06] once amen I'm I'm
[1:47:08] listening for a different sound I'm
[1:47:11] listening every day so if and then the
[1:47:14] proph that you heard from your theophany
[1:47:16] if this Earthly body be dissolved we
[1:47:19] have one waiting he quotes Paul again
[1:47:22] there was the prophet named Moses one
[1:47:24] time he said over in the land he died on
[1:47:26] the Rock the Angels took and buried him
[1:47:28] there was another man an eagle he was he
[1:47:31] didn't have to die he just walked across
[1:47:32] Jordan and God sent a chariot down the
[1:47:35] robe of Flesh dropped and he rise and
[1:47:36] caught the Everlasting prize 800 years
[1:47:39] later 800 years later on the mount
[1:47:41] Transfiguration there he stood the two
[1:47:42] of them moses' body had been rotten for
[1:47:44] hundreds of years but here he was in
[1:47:46] such a form till even James and Peter
[1:47:48] and John recognized him wow amen if this
[1:47:52] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:47:54] one waiting there he was there they were
[1:47:57] standing there on Mount transfigure in
[1:47:59] their
[1:48:00] theophany yeah that's
[1:48:02] theophanies it wasn't flesh not like
[1:48:04] melzak you know the prophet said mzc was
[1:48:07] was was a glorified body he could eat
[1:48:11] right he could it was a it was it was a
[1:48:14] a an example of the
[1:48:17] Resurrection cuz they and those bodies
[1:48:19] can't eat
[1:48:21] they can't sleep but we will have a body
[1:48:24] that we can eat right so you know you
[1:48:28] might think that well this is simple
[1:48:29] Brother Martin but it is
[1:48:31] real it is more real than we realize
[1:48:35] amen and and it's just coming more and
[1:48:37] more real I'm not going to be long just
[1:48:39] stay with me a few more minutes see uh
[1:48:42] but I have good news for you and you
[1:48:45] here tonight we have now when we've
[1:48:49] heard the message and we heard from
[1:48:50] Earth theophany we have a spoken word
[1:48:53] birth you were birthed by the word you
[1:48:56] were not birthed by some sensation or
[1:48:58] some miracle or some sign follow the
[1:49:02] sign no follow the voice behind the
[1:49:05] sign right you weren't birthed by some
[1:49:07] sign or wonder I didn't see any of the
[1:49:09] signs or wonder I heard the word of my
[1:49:12] salvation repent and be baptized the
[1:49:15] name of Jesus Christ you shall receive
[1:49:17] the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and then
[1:49:20] then the understanding comes that's just
[1:49:22] the new birth that's you're you're just
[1:49:25] a babe in Christ but when you start
[1:49:27] hearing from your theophany that matures
[1:49:30] you amen that's the maturity that's the
[1:49:33] adoption oh it's not too high for a
[1:49:36] Saints it's right here and and we just
[1:49:40] we just need to let God reveal it to us
[1:49:42] see
[1:49:44] but see when we repented and confessed
[1:49:47] and then we heard from that you know
[1:49:50] your word body your theophany that image
[1:49:54] that you were made Genesis 126 has never
[1:50:00] sinned this flesh has
[1:50:02] sinned and and and the prophet said a
[1:50:05] righteous man A righteous woman is not a
[1:50:07] sinless man or a sinless woman Elijah
[1:50:11] was a man of like passions but he got
[1:50:13] angry his temper got up he you know he
[1:50:17] he he said send me a Minstrel I need a
[1:50:21] menstrual because I'm in a bad
[1:50:23] mood you know I didn't want to see this
[1:50:26] guy's face
[1:50:29] today you know but then it just it just
[1:50:34] that just brought him into that that
[1:50:37] Spirit like that's why the the song
[1:50:40] service is so
[1:50:42] important amen it just you know songs
[1:50:45] singing can
[1:50:47] deliver singing Take Spirits right off
[1:50:49] you you come in here with an attitude
[1:50:51] you've been feeding on the wrong thing
[1:50:53] doing the wrong thing and then you know
[1:50:55] you you sit there and you repent and you
[1:50:56] pray and then you get into that song
[1:50:58] service and just it just lifts right off
[1:51:01] I've seen suicide Spirits lift right off
[1:51:03] wow in a song
[1:51:05] service you don't know what you're doing
[1:51:08] we don't know what we're doing sometimes
[1:51:09] it's just just taking our place our
[1:51:12] position amen so um you know Satan likes
[1:51:17] to overwhelm us and uh with grief and
[1:51:20] sorrow and disappointments and we all
[1:51:22] have those things but we need to hear
[1:51:24] from our theophanies amen because that's
[1:51:26] the only thing that's going to give us
[1:51:29] strength amen and courage to go on you
[1:51:32] know uh we've all made mistakes we've
[1:51:34] all you know but like I said a righteous
[1:51:36] man is not a sinless man uh you know
[1:51:39] we've all made mistakes and um fell on
[1:51:43] our faces I know I have that's why I
[1:51:45] wanted to run away from the ministry
[1:51:48] wanted to call it quits God wouldn't let
[1:51:51] me he wouldn't let me and he won't let
[1:51:54] you either he won't let you fall away
[1:51:57] either no you're elect he's going to

[1:52:03] or the hard way he's going to bring you
[1:52:06] isn't that isn't he wonderful ain't he
[1:52:08] loving isn't he gracious make the stupid
[1:52:12] mistakes amen but you know it's like
[1:52:14] that uh that example one of the brothers
[1:52:16] showed me you know he had a little boy
[1:52:19] and uh he took the little boy up and the
[1:52:20] little boy said what's your father's
[1:52:22] name and he told me his name and and he
[1:52:23] said okay you sure of that and he yeah
[1:52:25] that's my father's name what's your
[1:52:26] mother's name yeah that's my mother's
[1:52:27] name yeah yeah okay uh you're sure about
[1:52:30] that and he said yeah yeah I'm sure
[1:52:32] about that and so then he said well just
[1:52:34] fall down on the ground so he fall falls
[1:52:36] down on the ground and then he and then
[1:52:38] he picks him up again and he says what's
[1:52:41] your father's name he says same name he
[1:52:44] said what's your mother's name same name
[1:52:46] he said you when you fell it didn't make
[1:52:49] any difference
[1:52:50] your parents are still the same
[1:52:52] wow your father's still the same yes sir
[1:52:55] your mother's still the same see the
[1:52:58] prophet came to a place where he said
[1:53:00] I'm not the son of Charles and El
[1:53:04] brown right we we we got another father
[1:53:08] he's our father our mother our sister
[1:53:10] and our brother amen and because you
[1:53:13] fall it doesn't mean that any his love
[1:53:16] changes his love is
[1:53:18] unconditional amen it's pre
[1:53:21] predestinated unmar Grace
[1:53:24] unconditional unconditional it doesn't
[1:53:26] change you can mess up terribly and I'm
[1:53:30] not saying you should you'll pay for it
[1:53:32] am but you know what his love does not
[1:53:35] change and I'm so glad I serve a God
[1:53:38] Like That amen I think I heard the
[1:53:40] brother testifying of that last time I
[1:53:42] was here I'm I'm so glad I serve a god
[1:53:45] like that that you know he's not an
[1:53:47] Angry God he's a loving God and you know
[1:53:51] I I uh I was riding a horse up here in
[1:53:54] the Prescott one time and these young
[1:53:56] guys were really riding ahead of me fast
[1:53:59] and uh they they had me on the horse
[1:54:01] that followed the other ones and this
[1:54:03] horse fell in a canyon and he and he
[1:54:05] went up against the rocks and there was
[1:54:07] ice in it you know I just bounced off of
[1:54:09] that that horse and I thought if I let
[1:54:12] go of these rains he'll trample me to
[1:54:15] death cuz he was kicking trying to get
[1:54:17] up off the ice so i l on his I laid on
[1:54:20] my belly on his rump and he bounced a
[1:54:22] few times and I said I got to hold on to
[1:54:25] these
[1:54:27] RS I got to hold on and I I I got to get
[1:54:31] back in that
[1:54:32] saddle and God taught me a lesson right
[1:54:34] there you better get back you got to get
[1:54:38] better get back to what I called you to
[1:54:40] so I just bounced a few times and I
[1:54:42] pulled on those rains I jumped back up
[1:54:44] in the saddle and the and the young boys
[1:54:47] your relatives sister Grace
[1:54:50] and uh they said hey how did you do that
[1:54:54] can you do that
[1:54:56] again I thought my leg would have been
[1:54:58] crushed I would have been trampled by
[1:55:01] this horse and I'm thinking this is not
[1:55:03] a rodeo show this is not this is not
[1:55:06] games this is like that was my life
[1:55:09] flashed before me like you got to hold
[1:55:12] on hold on Saints hold on to those rains
[1:55:17] you know don't let the rains go anyway
[1:55:21] uh no matter what we've done there's an
[1:55:23] angel you have an angel you know and let
[1:55:27] me let me just try to close
[1:55:30] here uh in Phoenix uh life story in
[1:55:35] Phoenix the prophet said when um he had
[1:55:39] got
[1:55:40] overwhelmed any anyone ever been
[1:55:44] overwhelmed I see some Expressions there
[1:55:48] amen and and that's what the the devil
[1:55:49] likes to do overwhelm us but we've got a
[1:55:51] mightier Angel we've got a strong Angel
[1:55:55] you've got a powerful powerful theophany
[1:55:59] your your theophany is all powerful if
[1:56:02] we just get in touch just stay in touch
[1:56:05] not talking about something real you
[1:56:08] know spiritual just just in a simple way
[1:56:12] just you know get before the Lord and
[1:56:15] what do you want me to do what what what
[1:56:18] what should I focus on
[1:56:20] help me to get more serious you know you
[1:56:22] know I I want to see God moving in my
[1:56:24] life how many want to see God moving in
[1:56:26] their lives amen I I I want something
[1:56:29] and it that's all it is Saints it's just
[1:56:31] that prayer and and that desire and uh
[1:56:35] you know he he says in life story here
[1:56:38] he got overwhelmed because he he wanted
[1:56:40] to commit suicide now that's some of the
[1:56:43] some of the things in the message we
[1:56:44] we're not proud of right but it's a fact
[1:56:49] right and others other prophets did too
[1:56:52] right other prophets did too but it it's
[1:56:54] just you know people like to like to
[1:56:57] make a God out of
[1:56:59] everyone right and and they're perfect
[1:57:01] we're human we go through things and the
[1:57:04] prophet was going through things that
[1:57:06] overwhelmed him and and he felt like
[1:57:08] taking his life and he and he even
[1:57:11] tried now I want to ask you a question
[1:57:15] did the prophet have the Holy Ghost yes
[1:57:17] sir yes sir you did have the Holy Ghost
[1:57:21] you can get so overwhelmed even with the
[1:57:24] Holy Ghost wow you get to a place Satan
[1:57:27] get you in a place you're so overwhelmed
[1:57:30] it takes the God's intervention the Holy
[1:57:33] Spirit to come down and intervene I know
[1:57:36] it did in my
[1:57:37] life and you know when he got so
[1:57:40] overwhelmed he he threw that gun it went
[1:57:43] off his own testimony he fell asleep and
[1:57:47] had a dream and he says he went there
[1:57:50] and he saw his Sharon
[1:57:51] Rose and and Sharon Rose says to him uh
[1:57:55] daddy and he said you call me daddy said
[1:57:58] dad you just don't know where you're at
[1:58:00] see this is heaven down on Earth you I
[1:58:03] was your little Sharon Rose said don't
[1:58:05] you remember what you're teaching on
[1:58:06] immortality is I I teach that there
[1:58:09] won't you taught that there won't be any
[1:58:11] little babies in heaven we're all one
[1:58:13] age one size
[1:58:16] Immortal amen this is not fair
[1:58:20] Tales this is the
[1:58:22] reality and he said we'll just be there
[1:58:25] no real old people and no real little
[1:58:28] babies we'll just be one age the youth
[1:58:31] forever said do you remember your
[1:58:32] teaching on
[1:58:33] immortality see you're you're not Sharon
[1:58:37] Rose said yes Daddy I said well Sharon
[1:58:39] honey I don't understand she said and
[1:58:42] then she asked him a question about
[1:58:43] Billy
[1:58:44] Paul and his home see so my question is
[1:58:48] how did she
[1:58:50] know what brother Brandon preached
[1:58:53] because she died at what six months
[1:58:55] or right how did she know about who is
[1:58:58] this mzc and the
[1:59:01] theophany she never heard those messages
[1:59:04] but she was in a
[1:59:05] body she was in a body that knew all
[1:59:08] things there was no time there there was
[1:59:11] no yesterday there was no tomorrow and
[1:59:14] so he's here she's preaching to the
[1:59:17] prophet is't that wonderful
[1:59:20] so your theophany knows a lot more than
[1:59:22] you do so Lord speak to me speak my Lord
[1:59:27] and I'll be quick to answer thee amen
[1:59:29] and and and so I thought the same thing
[1:59:31] about Jesus 12 years old how did he know
[1:59:35] he was the word he had a spoken word
[1:59:37] birth but so have we now had a spoken
[1:59:40] word birth and we're back in contact
[1:59:42] with Earth theophany and we're hearing
[1:59:44] from it amen and and that's what Jesus
[1:59:47] did at 12 years old I uh maybe the
[1:59:50] musicians can
[1:59:51] come amen maybe the musicians can come I
[1:59:55] just wanted to share few things like
[1:59:56] that about angels and I have a message
[1:59:59] on it but I I just wanted to put that in
[2:00:01] with the mission report amen I was I was
[2:00:05] preaching in Germany and I can't explain
[2:00:06] it but uh I was uh just preaching away
[2:00:11] and a few minutes I thought I was going
[2:00:14] to pass out and I thought I got
[2:00:16] lightheaded or something and I was just
[2:00:18] preaching away and all of a sudden
[2:00:20] brother I I was up here and I was
[2:00:22] watching myself preach just for a second
[2:00:27] I was aware I thought how can I be there
[2:00:29] and here at the same time I thought well
[2:00:32] I'm going to faint or I just got
[2:00:33] lightheaded or but it was my theophany
[2:00:37] preaching if you yield it'll be your
[2:00:39] theophany speaking don't take a thought
[2:00:42] what you're going to say I'll I'll give
[2:00:44] you what to say your theophany already
[2:00:46] knows that amen and and uh so I I just
[2:00:50] thought I I left it for years I didn't
[2:00:52] know what what that was but I know what
[2:00:55] it is
[2:00:56] now I know what it is now by this word
[2:01:00] you know uh I I I mentioned that in
[2:01:03] Germany when I was there you can play
[2:01:04] something sister if you want uh in
[2:01:07] Germany and U this sister was diagnosed
[2:01:11] with terminal
[2:01:14] cancer and they didn't give
[2:01:17] her much time six weeks or so she wanted
[2:01:21] to go to church the week before she
[2:01:24] passed and she's standing at the altar
[2:01:27] and the pastor told me they were praying
[2:01:29] you know and the young children
[2:01:32] congregation had young children and it
