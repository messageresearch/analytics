remain standing I'm not sure if brother brandom seats us but if if he doesn't seat us then we'll just be seated after the reading of the word God bless you now for a text I want to take this far a text this morning the sudden secret going away of the church now let me announce it again because I haven't had very much time to premeditate on any comments but just hurrying we were out late yesterday and never got in last night till real late and rushing down here this morning but this just come to my mind and maybe later I might catch something that would do someone good I love this subject the sudden secret catching away of the church and now in first Thessalonians the 5th chapter but all the times and all the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for you yourselves know perfect ly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destructions cometh upon them as trevail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as as a thief ye are the children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night are of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night now I wish you to look just across the page if it is so geographically arranged in your Bible to the 16th 17th and 18th verses of the fourth chapter of first Thessalonians for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the deading Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy word this is an unusual thing to speak of a subject like this on a morning that I come down to to minister to the sick but there is a greater sickness Than Physical sickness and it's much more essential that we be well for this great event that's just fixing to take place than it would be to be even asleep in the Lord that is dead as we would know it it's better to be ready I would rather be a sick man ready with the Lord than to be a well man not ready to go with the law yes but however it be God is so willing that we be both well and ready amen soul and body for he forgives all of our iniquities and heals all our diseases he died for a compound purpose and then I thinking today on this subject of the sudden and secret I like that God is people live today as though just before the coming of the Lord Jesus if he was going to send a host of angels down to all the newspapers and for a year of so announced it throughout all the world in the newspaper that on a such and such a date Jesus will arrive and to have it broadcast by the radio and put on the televisions and everywhere just the day and just the hour that he was coming now that's the way people live today but God has said in his word that it would be like a thief in the night coming if that would be so people would say as the world thinks today oh well there is just plenty of time H it'll be well announced and but you see it is announced but it's a secret announcing it's just those who are willing to hear it those who are willing to consider it and to who loves the law I think now of what Paul said when he said there is a crown of righteousness laid up for me that the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day and then he stops did you notice and said not only me but to all them that love his appearing if we love is appearing usually in the world today that people think of the appearing of the Lord as a horrible Dreadful thing oh the world might come to its don't talk to me about that they'll say they don't want to know about those things they don't care about them just for the present day living but those who love of the Lord love is appearing what if one of your loved on some of you older people that your mother was gone on or your father or your baby and they were been away for so many years and you know that they might appear at any time why you'd have the house all cleaned up you would just be ready and watch watching down that road for every car light that turned in you'd think it would be D now that's the way the church ought to be watching for the coming of the Lord all in order all ready all packed up and ready to go as soon as he comes because it'll be in a moment in a twinkling of an eye just try to time how long it would take your eye to twinkle that's just how quick the Rapture of the church will take place amen you know the enemy always uses the tactics that the uh that the Lord uses you know when he seen that God was going to have a righteous church and the things that he was going to do the enemy used that same strategy he's got a church and he's got a people that's very religious and they're just right on the toe as as religious people because he knows that Christ Church is the same way and he does it out in military line I was reading an article some time ago on the sudden attack on Pearl Harbor that wasn't no exactly any unknown attack they had already been warned that the Jacks were going to do that but the sad part was they ignored that warning they had seen signs and the Japanese Army assembling themselves together and the big ships being loaded with ammunition and the threat was in the air and they were just exactly in line for the invasion but they ignored it that's the way it is today with the church the church church is in line of judgment but they are ignoring the coming of the Lord so you can't blame him they said when it was noise to brought around in Pearl Harbor that the Japs could attacked it any time if their big Fleet had set out in the waters of the sea and was moving slowly but steadily toward Pearl Harbor that thing only laughed at it and said oh nonsense you Gloom Builders You Weary works all you think about is some trouble and on the night just before the great attack the next morning there was a great dance or a big party given in Pearl Harbor itself and no matter how much they tried to say that the Jets were coming they still would not take warning let's just look on them for a few minutes there's a little radio bulletin goes out and a little piece in the corner of the paper about like a healing campaign would be advertised just a small place that the Jacks were on their Road in the waters of the sea a great fleet was headed that way nonsense says the others we don't believe in no such stuff as that what are you trying to scare us about and then we find getting close to the night I can see at the home place instead of them preparing for to get out of the city why the young girls were all putting on their new FRS and so forth they were going down to this great big uh Jubilee they were going to have and also the officers of the army were just busy riding little passes so that the soldiers could all attend this party big drunken party party and the trucks were roaring and humming bringing in their best of beer and their wine and stuff for this party and all the time the Japanese feet on its Road there and they fail to hear the warning as the sun begin to set and they all gathered in this great Tavern of a place maybe on the side somewhere the BART tender polishing the bar or something said something like this say did you hear the rumor no I don't believe it did said the man he spoke to oh they say something about a Japanese Fleet being coming this way and then someone else drops in on the conversation and a young silly girl bounces up there sticks her foot up on the bar and said you gloomy headed WS don't you know that we're here for have a good time and not talk about what that isn't just about the way the world is the same today about the coming of the Lord you oldfashioned fogy do numbers what makes you dress and act and do the way you do but we're looking for that secret sudden appearing of the Lord or there's something in the air a message of the holy spirit that tells us that coming is at handise God then when the big shind dick went on and oh it must have been a horrible thing that night for it said that sometimes during the night they took a young lady a beautiful built young girl and stripped her clothes from her and put her in a little wagon with just one underneath garment on and run her down the street and so forth just having a big time and all the time the Japanese was gaining grounds coming right on and then the next morning when the man on the post of Duty in the airplane signal watching and so forth had been out all night drunk and running around with these women and so forth was so drowsy and upset the next morning from the big party until they were caught asleep on the [Music] job and I'm afraid that it's going to be likewise at the coming of the Lord the church is so tuck up and drunken with the cares of the world tell they are going to be asleep at the post of Duty at the coming of the Lord and then over the city flew the planes and the bombs dropped and they just battered out that City to the ground why because they wouldn't take heed to the warranty and that young lady along with the rest of them one old Japanese brutal soldiers running there they ravished them in the street and cut them to pieces with knives afterwards and so forth for if you won't heed to warning there's only one thing left that's judgment oh if there ever was a time that this America was ever at its lowest end right now of its immorality of its indifference the gospel's been preached from Shore to Shore and signs and wonders has been performed and great Miracles has been done and they continually go on in their Ry drinking ignoring making fun out of the 200,000 pull pits in America of Protestant churches what we need today in those pull pits is prophets of the Lord who's not afraid to blast out God's Thunderbolts of judgment upon this generation of sinful people that we're preaching to amen we need prophets like Isaiah who cried out and said a wicked generation and how that he did condemn that generation and tell them of the oncoming judgments but the day too many of our ministers are afraid to say those things they are a scared to give a direct witness of warning for it would mean some of their jobs they'd have to lead their denomination lead their pulpits and they would have to to go out perhaps maybe take another stand at some other church or something but it's just too bad that we've got those kind of people in our pull pits we need man like John Wesley of the early Reformation Martin Luther we need people like Paul who's willing to give all and to surrender theirselves even if it means separation from this life as a witness of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ amen what it is today that education and societies and little frenal things of societies in their own feelings has stuck the place of the Holy Ghost in the church what we need today to cry out to America is God sent God filled man with the power of the Holy Ghost who's not afraid to cry out against the thing that's wrong and to warn the people of the oncoming judgment God could by no means ever let this nation Escape judgment if God would do so he would have to raise up Sodom and gomorra and apologize to them for ever sinking them when they was such an evil people we are no no exception in the sight of God what we have come today when it comes comes to our politics when it comes to our government it is rotten all the way from Pillar To Post there is no justice no more only in God oh we say we rely upon the UN the United Nations and better than 5 years ago they were 51% communist other the nations in the UN there's nothing to rely upon but the word of the Living God we can't rely upon nothing not no politics I have been in trials for the last three or four months under heavy fire try trying to accuse me of doing something that was wrong by passing the money through this Tabernacle here for the meetings which our truste board here signed a declaration and there's not a person that's ever attended my meetings but what I publicly announced that this money was taken up in our and my meetings were directed to this church and now they say because I placed it to the church I was trying to defraud the government and want to give me 20 years in Fort leworth Kansas fart I said what is that word wrote over on our courthouses Justice it means no more that it wasn't even wrote there so when everything that your own people told me to do I have did it and now you say that they're not with the government anymore how can you you'll setle one and prove it out that here they'll dig up something else not only that but they're wishy-washy oh amen I made this statement in the federal courts I said if Communism had Christianity in it I'd be a communist but I can't be because it denies Christianity so I have one hand to hold to that's God's unchanging hand knowing that he will respect truth and honor it'll have to come forth prise God and Justice amen but to let you know there is not hopes nowhere only in the coming of the Lord amen that's the truth oh it's such a day that we're such a an awful time when every physical thing even to the church itself the church peoples the church denominations they're so concerned about their little their little differences till they won't even Fellowship one with the other I'm not taking warning that the coming of the Lord is at hand man such as Billy grim and Jack Schuler or Roberts and many of the Great advances and Charles Fuller who has an Outreach to the whole world they do everything that they can to warn the coming of the Lord those on man those man who tried to do right is the man that our own government tries to tear to Pieces amen the true I said to someone Mister 28 years of my life I've laid on the altar of God to try to do right and I want someone to look at me in the eye and tell me if I ever beat anyone out of anything I ever stole anything in my life by the grace of God I'm clear amen that means to order that in must snap of your finger amen you're guilty anyhow and you're a dictator in your church you snap your finger and your church does what you tell him to do oh I said how unjust can man be he said you gave people gifts when their homes burnt here's your check where you give widows hundreds of dollars and paid their rent and done things like that said did you go to your church board and tell him you were going to do such I said no sir why didn't you I said the Lord told me in his word don't let your right your left hand know what your rights are doing he said then you're trying to plead Your Case by Bible and we're judging you by law I said which is the highest law man are God's I'll take God's law just a few two years ago I've been on my vacation was on my road bank here in Indiana the speed laws are 65 miles an hour in the daytime and that's on the free highways the freeways and it's 60 M an hour at night if the sun goes down that's in Kansas that's so in Illinois That's So in Colorado that's so in Idaho that's so in Wyoming and all wrote back after sitting in a snow drift for several days in a blizzard and I just gotten an elk and I was on my road home to give it to my friends and I had to hurry to try to beat another blizzard was just behind her I'd be set up again and the meat would ruin and I crossed out of Wyoming come over into to Nebraska I was about 30 Mi up inside the road and all of a sudden I look back and I seen the police's uh red light and I never was arrested in my life so I just went on I looked down I was doing 60 M an hour out on 30 or 40 miles from a any any kind of a city and just going down the highway big four lane Highway and I noed 60 m I looked back and he continued to stay behind me and I just watched and I seen the red light flickering I thought well why don't he pass me he's got plenty of room and I kept waiting I run my window down and I heard a sirene well I thought I'm over as far as I can get and he pulled around and stopped me I got out of the car I thought maybe some message that I didn't pick up on the radio maybe at home my wife or family family I got out of that car just as innocent as I could be he said I guess you wonder why I stop you I said I do sir and he said you were breaking the speed laws said do you know how fast you were going I said yes sir I said I was going 60 M an hour he said that's right and that's against the law I said is it 65 and no sir said it's 55 here you were doing miles over the speed limit oh I said I'm so sorry I didn't mean said give me your driver's license just show me your license and I took them from my pocket and just as soon as he seen that word revered his eyes gleam with fire he grabbed out his book and started writing me a ticket for $224.50 I said are you going to give me a ticket said you're right I'm going to give you you a ticket well I said sir it's all right but I didn't see anything he said oh there's a sign right outside the state line you should have seen it I I said I've been sitting in a four snow drift for 4 days and I probably just never saw it sir and he said all right you got any cash on you I said just about $12 well I said you're going to stay right here until you pay it about 10:00 at night or 11: I said sir I told him all what was wrong the meat and so forth that didn't mean a thing to him so I had to sign a bonifide statement that I would send him the money when I got home I wrote the judge that of the little city that the Squire that I was ascended to and I told him I said sir I put 20 about 25 years at that time 26 years in the service of the Lord trying to convert criminals to the Lord Jesus to try to protect your life as an officer to try to make better communities and a better place to live and decency for our families I put 20 something years in that service and I just crossed over your line I feel that you should forgive me F I said but your officer would not even considered it all which I maybe he's supposed to do that and carry out his duties but I'm asking you as a judge it isn't the money it's the principal my first spine to ever pay and this has to come out of money that people give me to live on through the church I said if you'll be so kind as to forgive me for it I'll appreciate it however here is the check that's been notorized that you might know that it's it's all right brother he just signed his name across and tuck it cold bloodly why why I'm done through rotten politics and religious Prejudice some of them get by with murder There It Is God won't let his church exist very long under such things amen and the world is corrupted and the politics is corrupted and the church is corrupted what we need to do more about it is God fearing people to get together and call on the name of the Lord Lord yesen that's what the brandom Tabernacle needs to do oh I would just looking and seeing I had lot ahead of in and thinking of how much we could stresser all the way that the churches are going how they let down upon the morals of the people how they let them live and go to dances and The Rock and rolls and dress any way they want to and everything and still go on just the same compromising preachers what we need his oldfashioned godsent Heaven Barn preachers who will tell the truth regardless who it hurts like John who said the ax is laid to the root of the tree and every tree that not bringeth forth good fruits is hewing down and cast Into the Fire we need preachers prophets like that who bombard and use the judgments of God for amination to tear up and this wicked condition that we're living in you can never rid sin by patting it on the back you can never rid sin by educating people our programs has become demolished and have failed there's only one remedy for sin and that is Christ is that remedy and not Christ through intellectual confession but through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to a new life and a regeneration that's the only remedy for sin only remedy for our nation it's only remedy for our church it's only remedy for the people here's sometime AG go I guess many of you people who travel has been there I've stayed all night there many times in my journey out west which I have to go next week Rel get relief from the government to go they're whole in me year worth and send me away they can get me right here and I've got to go to a couple of meetings over on the west coast and the Lord willing I shall pass through this little city called West Memphis Arkansas it's just across the river from Memphis Tennessee and in this place they wanted to spend two and12 million dollar for race court for gambling two and one half million dollar to degrade and to pollute and to send soul to hell and then catch man like Billy Grim or Roberts myself and those who are suffering for the cause of Christ to pass legitimate money through a church and morning give him 20 years in federal prison it's always been the will of the world to act like that I said you I have brothers who's been in federal prison and one of the said attorneys said you got Brothers in the federal prison I said I did have said who were they I said one of them was brother John and alcatrez on the aisle of patmas and the other was brother Paul in the Roman federal prison and brother Daniel he was also in the prison house and Brother Joseph because that he had been accused of something that he was innocent of sered years by trying to be a real servant to pontier and his wife accus him and he was condemned and laid in prison for years until his whiskers and hair had grown out till he didn't even had to shave him to take him before Pharaoh sure what far anything wrong for the cause of Christ amen exactly and then spend $2 and15 million for a race Corp to pollute and damn and send souls to Hell talking about God coming quickly but they Arkansas people done something about it every church I think nine or 10 different denominations in that Community they all got together and said it's wrong and we won't have it and they formed a prayer meeting and they take chains of prayers day in and out and night in and out and one the judges and the federal man and they all went to the court the next morning to settle it whether they could build it or not they were met and it was defeated Prayer Changes Things amen I don't care how rotten the world is how rotten our country is our nation is our people our prayer changes things but we're not in Ed in prayer meeting no more we got so many other things we have to do so we think and then not only that was that race Court condemned but it also was draw up that they could not have in the state of Arkansas nothing like that anymore for years and years to come why because of people that are called by his name assemble themselves together and pray oh what we need today is a calling together of getting ready I'm not depending on the preacher but you as an individual before God make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord to escape all this corruption amen no matter what they call you and what action they take that doesn't change God one B God will do it just the same he's depending and waiting on us oh my some people say well I go to church on Sunday morning I listen to our pastor which is a fine preacher that's good I appreciate that and you are the America the world whoever it is but it takes more than a good message from the pulpit it takes your life it takes you to get ready in Revelations the 19th Chapter and the seventh verse the Bible said that speaking of the bride of Christ she has made herself ready she made herself ready and you as a member of this bride you've got to make yourself ready some time ago a minister was preaching and and there was a man who had been tending his church for oh quite a lengthy time and he came that morning up to the Altar and he said pastor I now wish to give my testimony and my surrender to the Lord Jesus which I have done last night and the Pastor said well uh I am sure glad to hear about that John to know that you have decided to finally come and give yourself to the Lord because we don't want to hurt your feelings but we know that you have been very Wicked and we know you have mistreated your family you gambled away your money and you drank it up and live a horable life and your family went without and it gives my heart Joy this morning to know that you have come forward now and going to surrender yourself to the Lord Jesus to become a different person to serve him he said thank you Pastor he said then just what the I want to ask you something what sermon did I preach or what text that I use or what song was sung in in the church and the hymns that made you so decide to do this and as the man looked at him in the face with the tears running off his cheeks he said pastor it was none of your sermons though it's good as they were it was none of the choir singing or the specials though as good as they were he said then would you tell this congregation why you have made this decision he said I work with a man who is a Christian and I've said everything to him I've called him a Holy Roller I've called him a religious fanatic and everything and it does bother him a bit but he lives such a life till finally in my heart all long he has w a place that I want to be like that man and that's the reason I asked him to lead me to Christ I wanted the Christ that he serves you see God does work through the pastor to get his church ready he works through the songs to get his church ready and he works through you to get his church ready if your pastor would fail and continually to fail you'd hunt you another Pastor quickly you would do that if your choir didn't sing right are your soul wasn't right you would say to the director the one who has the music don't let them sing the more they just make me nervous to sing but what about you as an individual how do you fail in your daily living how do you tally up with God what God says for you to be a shining light that sits on a hill no one can pass that way around your way without knowing about Jesus what type of Life do you live one of those types of of mean and sing and aggravating and different are can you speak of the peace and the love that you have found in Christ she has made herself ready I showing you the wickedness in the time would not would fail me to Go Through the Ages and show that each time like in babbling on the night of the rting and dancing and drinking and so forth and what happened and down through the age has been that way and every age God had thunderbow prophets and signs and wonders to condemn the thing in the midst of all popularity and stand alone for God not only that but what if I would speak of the time of little Stevens not a prophet not a pastor just the member of the body of Christ how that this little fellow stood before the Sanhedrin Council that morning and spoke out to those who were condemning him and said you stiff necks uncircumcised in the heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do you he wasn't a pastor you can't expect your pastor to do it all you can't expect your truste board to do it all or your Deacon board you've got to make yourself ready it's an individual Affair and remember His coming is so sudden that the church will go in the twinkling of an eye and if we see sin on every hand and judgment pending in the battleships of God's Wrath coming how we escape this signs are appearing Jesus is coming and great wonders are being done every mon Outpost is poting towards his soon appearing and it'll happen in a moment how are we standing this morning as we take inventory if we should be spoke to this morning and the Lord Jesus should descend from the heavens this morning with the shout and the Trump of God would we be found ready as a church body amen would we be found ready as an individual to jar with the those who are raised from the dead who have proven themselves ready no matter whether we are ready or not the Lord Jesus will come just the same at the appointed time we must be ready and we must do it now it is no time to wait we must redeem the time and be ready sometime ago a story just before closing that struck me as I heard it many many years ago this secret coming of the Lord sudden secret going of the church watch there'll be two in the field I'll take one and leave one there will be two in the bed I'll take one and leave one showing that the coming of the Lord will not be just at any certain corner but it'll be universal one will be in the field working daytime the other in the bed sleeping on the other side of the world it'll be a universal Rapture and it will come with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God shall sound in the dead and Christ shall rise and she'll be called away secretly oh I love that the great bridegroom coming in the bride got herself ready waiting for that secret moment that she doesn't even know herself but she's ready and dressed and waiting for it we see signpost in the world that she's ready for judgment we see signs and wonders in the church great things taking place what kind of people should we be ready at the moment or we don't know when he's coming be also ready for you know not what minute or hour your lord does come be ready for you can't get ready then for he said you could not how many of you all perhaps have read of the virgins some were wise and some were foolish virgent means Purity they were all good people every one of them virgin Sanctified vessels of God but those who had or in their names went in and the others was left out they were all virgins every one people that you couldn't put your finger on for anything wrong they everyone believed in the coming of the Lord they were ready to go meet him but some of them let their oil go out don't let that be your case keep oil in your land yes or is the spirit the Holy Spirit never let it drain from when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to Christ and to the the cause quickly go to him who has the Fountain of oil and buy for yourself a filling of the Holy Spirit our nation gone morally corrupted and ruined our politics corrupted and gone our leaders oh God what could we do about you put a good man in and he comes out of cook there's only one we can bring now that's the Lord Jesus amen let's make ready for his coming amen I want to tell you a little story that I heard some years ago in the cloes this sudden quick Rapture of the church now you say certain things will take place then I'll Make Ready make ready now I've just related to you of Pearl Harbor and of many places where they refuse to hear the warning they refuse to listen to it nothing was left but Divine judgment upon the people now all that will not go in Christ will be under God's Wrath and divine judgment please don't let that happen to you no matter what the Brandon Tabernacle ever turns out to be don't you let it be you you be a servant of Christ no matter what the church world does you be a servant of Christ it's not up to the brandom Tabernacle neither is it up to any other church it's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the Lord you must be ready I must be ready I sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your steps leave mine alone me leave yours alone you've got to make your garment ready that was a great raner and he owned a mammoth big Ranch way in the northern part of Colorado near the mountain section as you all know I done a little ranching in my life of riding and so forth one of my calls to God was sitting on a parable Texas wheel spers with a rifle L on the saddle and a pistol on my side but I heard down trees blowing sound like a boy said Adam where are you I looked up towards the stars and he old slim an old cowboy from Over Texas blowing through a comb with a piece of paper down at at the cross where my savior died it was down there for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was his blood applied glory to his name I pulled the blanket over my face and tried to hide myself because God was looking down in those Hills it's on one of those ranches where the great packing companies buy their cattle run them into the mountains and then bring them out at their caves or barn and in the fall of the year and brand them and sell off some of the old herd and the steers and so forth and go ahead into the accumulate their great herds of cattle and on this certain Ranch the owner are the caretaker what we call there the top the foreman he had about five daughters they were all beautiful women young Sangle and there was a little lady there which was a cousin to these girls that her father and mother had both deceased and she was brought over there to be a to live with her her uncle and those girls they wasn't those fancy type of frilly FRS you know and and um and they just Tu this poor little girl and they just treated her like she was some animal all the hard work poured right on her she washed the dishes she cleaned up she fixed the bunk she she had to do it all and they just stayed around with polished fingernails and manicure the stuff on their lips and all fixed up you know just prissy and especially did they do this when they heard that from Chicago the big Packing Company who own the out his young single son was coming to visit the ranch how did they Dyke out in good clothes and did they dress and make ready for his coming and each night the conversation would be they were going to B this young man and marry him who would then they would own the ranch themselves for the son would fall air to all so they made themselves ready so you see there is a ready to be made you make yourself ready by joining church or something that ain't all that's required you got to have oil in your lamp just you're dressing saying we'll build a big church we'll belong to a better denomination we'll we'll build the pipe oring to the Lord we'll make plush seats that is what God requires amen righteousness is what God requires in his son Christ Jesus that's the garments for the Bible said the white clothes which he is adorned in is the righteousness of the Saints amen so she these girls thought they would make themselves ready for the coming of this young man of course that poor little cousin that reminds me of an off cast somewhere you could appreciate her she was a beautiful woman but oh my she was a nice little girl but she was not even considered among them not as a relative now that's about the true picture of the real church today before the denominations not even considered a bunch of in denominational a bunch of outcast so the poor little fell went ahead working and when the young man arrived they didn't know it but he come looking for a wife he was sick and tired of the city girls who just stayed all doled up and oh you know hung around the barrooms and uh roll around in The Cadillacs and the different things they they were just sick and tired of it he thought i' go out west and Hunt me a a real girl that'll be a real mother to my babies and somebody who will not hang at all the sewing circles and the and the societies and things but it'll just be a real mother what did he find when he got there but the same thing that he had condemned in Chicago I wonder if the Lord Jesus will find a church just a denomination just by name a church no are in the Nam not ready to go oh they got fine FRS they got the biggest churches the biggest this and all these things but God don't want that he wants you as an individual they may have the best pastors they may have the finest Deacon board but he wants you with all L he's coming to C that alled bride away and as this boy looked up on him he was disheartened and that night they were having something on the order and then days it's been a long ago they called the Charleston which is just like a rock and roll and they were going to throw one of those big parties many of you people remember that old Charleston dance they did back when I was a kid when I was out there and so they were all had their little black and white clothes on you know to do the oh it was called Charleston's and black box that's what they were calling and they had them two tone clothes and they were going to do these dances and but this boy was sick of that stuff he was hunting for a real girl so he slipped out other party he's watching him he went in to look at him so is another son that I know of another son will come to your church he'll Son of God he'll come there he he'll look around he'll see you're fine dressed he'll he'll know that you're a good member but he's looking for something different from this IR regular trend of church so as he looked around after all he so discouraged he walked out the door and going back Walking In The Moonlight towards the bunk house he heard somebody calling huming and he looked around and here went this little girl with a great big pan of dish waterer way in the night barefooted that throw the dishwater out and as soon as he saw her something another said that's her that's the one so he put himself in a way and when she that's when she come back along the crow fence well E standing there and she almost fainted he said how do you do and he said what's your name and she told him her name and it was the same name of the boss of the ranch said then I can't understand how that this is that your father said no I'm just a cousin you see my father and he were brothers I've got the same name but I that that's about you might have the name of church might have the name of Brandon Tabernacle or Methodist or whatever Church you go that isn't it friend see it's something different it's your character that's what God's looking at you might be Methodist you might be Baptist you might be Presbyterian it's not that it's character that God looks at not just Earthly character but holy spirit character these signs shall follow them that believe said Jesus in the 16th chapter of St Mark she was so gotten that that he would speak to her even and she held her little head down and she ran into the house he was there for a week or two and he looked all around everywhere and he never said no more but he kept watching her and the night before he left he used to leave the next morning there stor another big party and he watched for her he couldn't fight her he know she' had to do the dishes and so forth so the dirty work and all could be thrown off that's the way the real Church of God has to take it sometime the Dirty Work all the Scandal names and all of the things that's mean to be thrown at it she's a Great Speckled Bird all the other birds gather around and flock at her that's all right her name's on the Lambs Book of Life she'll spread her great Wings someday for a flight she's ready and Speckles me the blood of Christ sprinkled on her you've read it in your book your Bible and this boy caught the little lady that night coming out he said I've watched you no one knows it but myself he said I've come out here looking for a wife and all that I have ever seen you meet the requirements amen how did she feel the big man's son asking her now if she would be his wife just imagine how those girls must have felt when they looked out the window and saw holding hands with that little despised cousin a man that they tried to back with all their big fine frocks and Frills and carrying on and he said will you marry me oh she said sir I'm not worthy that's the way the real Church feels about it am I'm not worthy I can if I can just wash your dishes it'll be all right are you willing to take that place could you wash the dishes from the supper would you be willing to be called fanatic or would you be willing to be Tak away with the Lord's despise few are you willing are you willing at your work to be marked there's a man he's a religious pH at it because he won't drink he won't smoke he doesn't dance he doesn't run with women there's a woman that keeps her head down she walks like uh down to the town she's not she won't join our circles and are you willing to take the way make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord if you have if you do you'll be waiting for him to come you'll Joy at his coming it won't be a Dreadful thing it'll be the most gracious moment that you can think of the coming of the Lord praise God all those that love his appearing so when he left he told her he'd be back at a certain time said when you begin to see there a winter said when you begin to see those trees begin to Bud y that mosquit and stuff begin to take on New Life said then I'll be back about Springtime I understand I couldn't say it was true but the girl only got about a175 cents a week for her labor but she saved every penny of it why she was getting ready for the wedding that was to be she was saving her money for her wedding gown or he said we'll be married right here at the ranch when I come again she saved her money all year she was happy happy she didn't mind washing the dishes she didn't mind ironing the clothes or sweeping out the bunk house or what more she was engaged to the boss of the ranch why do we care what the world says a real Christian what do we care if we have to be dis despised and rejected blessed are the meat for they shall inherit at the Earth the boss's sons are coming one day and we're going to a wedding supper what differ does it make to us if you love is appearing after it was all the days passed the little daughters the little cousins made fun of her danced around her and done everything else well I said you poor silly kid do you not know if he why he was just like all man he was just teasing you but the Son of God doesn't tease except a man be born again he will in no wise I don't care how good you look how much Church you belong to what your status is in the country you might be a politician you might be in the federal government you might be in the Catholic Presbyterian any church you want to be but it's accept the man be born again you will not enter and these signs shall follow them that believe I'm only quoting his word finally when the hour come she begin to see this the buds begin to come on the trees she knew he'd be there at anytime and he said I'll try to make it just at sundown so we can be merried and hurry off and every evening it's Sunday when she she going get make herself all ready get her little wedding garment all and wait at the gate and these little cousins come and laugh at her and make fun of her and said you poor silly ignorant child the think that the the man who owns his a president other of the company that his boy would marry a dishwasher he was looking for virtue not clothes he had enough money to buy all the clothes as necessary God don't care how biger fancy things you have he owns everything in the world so he wants virtue he wants something that's real and so finally one evening while she was standing there and they were laughing and making fun of her and telling her she was silly all at once they heard some hoofs of prancing what happened across the hill come a Buckboard now Buck board's a little wagon open pop very popular in the west and the horses all jingled and everything coming across the hill come this carriage and stopped in front of the gate and she run she said I knew you would come that's to be the church someday amen she threw herself in his arms and he said darling I have had a man stationed on this ran since I left your last year here has brought me a report of everything that you've done God's got a man stationed in this Tabernacle this morning he's called the Holy Spirit he knows the secrets of your heart he knows everything that you've done what you think he tells the father everything that you do he brings the

around her and drove off to find this new big Palace on Outer Drive in Chicago the selected of the nation where she could live as his bride why she was ready she'd Liv and been the kind of a woman
