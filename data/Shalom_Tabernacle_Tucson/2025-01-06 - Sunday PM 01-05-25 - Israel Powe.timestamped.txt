[34:41] flows from
[34:43] deep within.
[34:51] There
[34:53] is a
[34:57] [Music]
[34:58] fountain that
[35:00] frees us
[35:03] all from sin.
[35:10] Come
[35:13] to this
[35:17] water for there
[35:20] is a
[35:23] vast supply.
[35:26] [Music]
[35:30] There
[35:32] is a
[35:34] [Music]
[35:37] river that
[35:40] never
[35:42] shall run dry.
[35:48] There
[35:50] came a
[35:52] sound from
[35:57] heaven as a
[36:00] rushing
[36:03] mighty
[36:07] wind. He
[36:09] filled their
[36:11] hearts with
[36:16] singing. He
[36:18] gave them
[36:20] [Music]
[36:21] peace with him.
[36:27] And the
[36:29] prophet
[36:31] gave this
[36:35] promise that the
[36:39] spirit
[36:41] would descend.
[36:46] And
[36:48] from your
[36:50] inner
[36:55] being a
[36:58] river
[37:00] with
[37:05] no
[37:07] there
[37:10] is a
[37:14] river that flows.
[37:18] From
[37:19] deep
[37:24] within
[37:27] there
[37:29] is a
[37:33] fountain that
[37:36] frees the
[37:38] soul from sin.
[37:42] [Applause]
[37:44] Just
[37:46] come
[37:48] to this
[37:52] water for there
[37:55] is a
[37:58] vast supply.
[38:03] Oh,
[38:04] [Music]
[38:05] there
[38:07] is a
[38:12] river that
[38:15] never
[38:17] shall run dry. Come to this
[38:22] water.
[38:24] Come
[38:26] to this water.
[38:32] Oh, there
[38:34] is a
[38:36] vast
[38:41] supply. Yes,
[38:44] there
[38:46] is a
[38:50] river that
[38:53] never
[38:55] shall run
[38:59] dry. Amen. And as we get ready to change
[39:02] the order of our service this evening,
[39:04] we'll go to key of A.
[39:08] In
[39:10] peace like a
[39:15] river
[39:18] attendeth my
[39:21] way. When
[39:25] sorrows like
[39:27] sea
[39:28] billows grow.
[39:31] [Music]
[39:38] Whatever my lot, thou hast
[39:44] taught me to
[39:47] say. It is
[39:51] well. It is
[39:54] well with my soul.
[40:02] It is
[40:08] well with my
[40:15] soul. It is
[40:18] well. It is
[40:21] well with my soul. But Lord for thee.
[40:30] My
[40:32] Lord is for
[40:35] thee. For thy
[40:40] coming we
[40:43] wait. The
[40:45] sky not the
[40:48] grave is our goal.
[40:56] With the
[40:58] shout of the
[41:02] angel and the
[41:05] voice of my Lord.
[41:10] Blessed
[41:11] hope.
[41:13] Blessed
[41:15] rest for my
[41:18] soul. Oh my
[41:22] sin. My sin.
[41:26] Oh, the
[41:28] bliss of this
[41:33] glorious
[41:35] thought. My
[41:37] sin not in
[41:41] part but the whole.
[41:49] It is nailed to the
[41:54] cross and I bear
[41:59] it no more. Praise the
[42:04] Lord. Praise the
[42:07] Lord, oh my soul.
[42:15] It is
[42:21] well with my
[42:23] [Music]
[42:27] soul. It is
[42:31] well. It is
[42:34] well with my soul and Lord haste the
[42:39] day.
[42:42] Oh
[42:44] Lord, haste the
[42:47] day when my
[42:50] face
[42:52] shall be
[42:55] sight. The
[42:57] clouds be rolled
[43:00] back as a
[43:08] [Music]
[43:10] us shall
[43:13] resound and my Lord shall
[43:20] desend even so
[43:25] is
[43:26] well with my soul and with all your
[43:32] heart this
[43:33] evening.
[43:34] Is
[43:39] well with my soul.
[43:46] [Music]
[43:47] It is
[43:49] well. It is
[43:53] well with my
[43:57] soul. Amen. If you would continue to
[44:00] play that this evening.
[44:02] [Music]
[44:27] Heat.
[44:34] Heat.
[44:37] [Music]
[44:52] Yeah. Heat.
[45:04] Amen. Amen. Let's pray. Lord
[45:08] Jesus, it is well with our soul, Lord,
[45:11] as
[45:12] we think of what you have done for us,
[45:16] Lord, in this last hour. We give you the
[45:20] praise and thanks, Father. We ask for
[45:22] you to come now and speak to our hearts
[45:25] in this portion of the service.
[45:28] We give you all the glory, the honor,
[45:30] and the praise. Take full control, Lord,
[45:33] as the saints are gathered in your name,
[45:35] Lord. Meet them. Meet our portion. We
[45:38] pray and we ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[45:42] So, God bless you saints. So good to be
[45:45] back in the house of the Lord with you
[45:47] tonight. And
[45:49] um we'd like to go right into the word
[45:52] of the Lord this evening. Just take a
[45:54] moment to go in further portion from the
[45:58] message this morning and we'll take St.
[46:01] John chapter
[46:05] 12. If you would stand with me and turn
[46:07] in your Bibles.
[46:16] Pray the Lord will help us.
[46:17] Amen. Are you happy to be here tonight?
[46:20] Yes, sir. Amen.
[46:32] St. John chapter
[46:37] 12 in
[46:41] verse our main verse is number 34 but
[46:45] let's
[46:46] see yes verse number
[46:52] 30 Jesus answered and said this voice
[46:55] came not because of me but for your
[46:59] sakes now is the judgment of this world.
[47:02] Now shall the prince of this world be
[47:05] cast out. And if I if I be lifted up
[47:09] from the earth, I will draw all men unto
[47:13] me. This he said, signifying what death
[47:16] he should die. The people answered him,
[47:19] we've heard out of the law that Christ
[47:22] abideth forever. And how sayest thou,
[47:25] the son of man must be lifted up? Who is
[47:30] this son of man? Amen. And we take that
[47:34] as our title tonight. Who is this son of
[47:38] man? Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask
[47:42] your blessings on the service. Lord, the
[47:44] word that we just read and the
[47:46] scriptures and the quotations that we'll
[47:48] read tonight. May each one receive their
[47:51] portion. Lord, remember the saints that
[47:53] are gathered there in Phoenix, Lord, in
[47:56] Mesa, for the art and the faithful
[47:58] saints there. May you bless them and
[48:00] help them. We pray. We love you in Jesus
[48:03] name. Amen. I bless you. Amen. You may
[48:07] be seated. I had it on my heart to go
[48:09] visit Brother Caleb Duron and just greet
[48:12] his church as we will be uh moving right
[48:16] into that neighborhood. And so, he
[48:18] pulled on me to take that service. That
[48:19] was a 4:00 service and I just finished
[48:22] up over there. So I was running a little
[48:24] bit behind and so we got started a bit
[48:27] late here tonight and we had a treat for
[48:30] you with brother Armando Rivera but he
[48:34] couldn't make it tonight. So I I have a
[48:38] few things that I didn't finish up from
[48:39] this morning. I trust it to be a
[48:41] blessing to you. Amen. So who is this
[48:45] son of man? As we took the scripture in
[48:48] Hebrews chapter 2 to show that this
[48:52] mindfulness, what is man that thou art
[48:55] mindful of him and the son of man that
[48:59] thou visitth him? And we showed you in
[49:04] the
[49:05] scripture, I quoted the scriptures to
[49:07] you that that phrase son of
[49:10] man is not always meaning a prophet. But
[49:15] in the New Testament, it is. And in many
[49:18] of the scriptures in the Old Testament,
[49:20] Jeremiah and Ezekiel are addressed as
[49:24] the son of
[49:25] man. But it's a um it's a phrase meaning
[49:29] human kind or humanity, the sons of men,
[49:34] the sons of Adam. That's the phrase. If
[49:37] you just take it and read it through
[49:39] your scriptures, you'll see that that is
[49:41] absolutely true. But as the prophet
[49:43] brings it to us, he shows us that this
[49:47] office of the son of man, uh, the son of
[49:51] man ministry found in Luke 17:30, one of
[49:54] the main scriptures that were, uh,
[49:58] manifested in our day, as I've said, can
[50:02] only apply to a one-man ministry. And of
[50:05] the three ministries, this is probably
[50:07] the one that's the most controversial
[50:11] because this is
[50:14] actually a son of man office prophet
[50:18] that is now revealing the son of man,
[50:22] the son of
[50:23] God. And God uses that flesh in such a
[50:28] way
[50:30] to bring to pass the scripture for the
[50:34] Gentiles. Remember the son of man came
[50:38] in flesh. His name was Jesus. And he
[50:41] came to the eastern people. He came to
[50:44] the Jews and the
[50:45] Samaritans. But he never came to the
[50:48] Gentiles as the son of man. the ministry
[50:52] of the Messiah, being able to discern
[50:55] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[50:58] And I would I would argue or contend or
[51:01] I would certainly say that uh that's
[51:04] probably the aspect of
[51:06] controversy is when there is so much um
[51:12] that God used brother Random in such a
[51:14] way that his closest friends actually
[51:18] uh mistook him for the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:21] and he had to correct it. It was an
[51:23] error. But he said if that did not
[51:26] accompany his ministry that his ministry
[51:29] would then be false. It had to. Could
[51:32] you imagine John the Baptist? Now, those
[51:35] of us who preach or minister, who serve,
[51:37] Brother Will, we've never been accused
[51:39] of being
[51:40] Jesus. I would love for that accusation
[51:43] to strike me. Uh but it hasn't happened
[51:47] yet and it's probably not going to
[51:49] happen. Where man, is that the Lord? But
[51:54] this actually happened to
[51:55] John. John the
[51:58] Baptist. They asked him the question,
[52:01] "Are you the Christ?" Now, could you
[52:03] imagine what kind of ministry this man
[52:06] would have to have to get the Jews to
[52:09] mistake him for the Messiah?
[52:12] It's a tremendous ministry. And he
[52:14] didn't have any signs, wonders, and
[52:16] miracles. even just preaching just the
[52:19] just the the just just the anointing of
[52:22] who he was. His message was so
[52:25] tremendous and profound that it had to
[52:28] be God. All the people knew that John
[52:30] was a prophet. The scripture says that
[52:33] they all knew. They wouldn't even speak
[52:34] against John. They all know that that's
[52:36] a prophet.
[52:38] And so they thought that he was the
[52:40] Christ because they were amused about
[52:43] the city and all of the great wonders
[52:46] that were taking place. His ministry was
[52:48] like no other. He used examples from the
[52:53] wilderness. And he he was fearless. I
[52:56] mean, we heard it in Sunday school this
[52:58] morning where he rebukes these are
[53:01] leaders who have the power to take his
[53:02] life. He rebukes them in their marriage.
[53:05] It's not lawful for you to have her. He
[53:08] preached marriage and divorce and it got
[53:11] him. They took his head off of for it.
[53:13] So we say it doesn't matter today. No,
[53:15] it does matter today. John lost his life
[53:18] over a marriage and a divorce sermon we
[53:22] would say and they had it in for him.
[53:24] But this ministry of the son of man. So
[53:28] we can bring the Elijah ministry of
[53:30] course the restoration of the gifts and
[53:33] those aspects and we can bring the
[53:35] seventh angel. The angel is supposed to
[53:38] reveal those seven seals. And I know
[53:41] many ministries love that aspect of the
[53:43] revelation of the deeper things, the
[53:45] third pull and those things. But this
[53:48] aspect of a son of man revealing the son
[53:53] of man. Um, a son of man revealing the
[53:57] son of man is uh part of the contention.
[54:02] So, but who is he? Now, I read this
[54:05] quote for you this morning. I'll read it
[54:07] again because he connects Luke
[54:10] 17:30 with
[54:13] Malachi 4. All
[54:16] right. And it was the quote I couldn't
[54:19] find, but sis found it for me, but it's
[54:21] I'll get it for you. Send a message to
[54:23] trial. I know that. And it's paragraph
[54:26] number 77. Get it in my uh place
[54:34] here.
[54:46] Yes. I thought I would get it, but feels
[54:50] like she has it. And she does. All
[54:53] right.
[55:02] Yeah, but for some reason I want to read
[55:04] it here. Let me get it here.
[55:07] Okay. The
[55:17] trial now. Don't you love the Lord?
[55:23] Yes. Uhhuh. All right. I'll just take it
[55:29] there. Blind prosecutor. Can't you see
[55:32] that his words are true? Not nail scars
[55:36] and prints and thorns. It's the son of
[55:40] God
[55:41] impersonated in his
[55:43] church as son of man.
[55:46] It has to fulfill Malachi 4 and the rest
[55:50] of the scriptures. A call to the court's
[55:53] attention. Look at that real good. Son
[55:56] of man, like God the Father, God the
[55:59] Son, God the Holy Ghost. It's the same
[56:02] God. Three different attributes of the
[56:05] same God. Now, brother man continues in
[56:09] the message uh the feast of the trumpets
[56:13] paragraph 275 and he says this
[56:17] here. So with that in the message the
[56:20] trial he takes this Luke 17:30 ministry
[56:24] had to be manifested in order to go up
[56:27] and fulfill Malachi 4. See how that's
[56:31] connected? Just read it for you there.
[56:33] He uses the the revelation of the son of
[56:37] man, that son of God being
[56:39] impersonated in this office of a prophet
[56:43] to fulfill Malachi 4, which was the
[56:47] Elijah ministry. All right. So in the
[56:49] feast of the trumpets, paragraph 275,
[56:51] the prophet of God says this, "The
[56:53] seventh angel's message under the same
[56:56] trumpet, same everything, exactly the
[56:59] same seal is to what? call the people
[57:04] the bride out of the Pentecostal and
[57:07] world tradition to the genuine atonement
[57:11] the word Christ impersonated in his word
[57:15] here made flesh among us science has
[57:20] proved it by pictures the church knows
[57:23] it the world around we firmly know it
[57:26] for he's never told us one thing and
[57:28] thus sayeth the Lord but what's been the
[57:31] truth
[57:32] Did he not say down there on the river
[57:35] as John the Baptist was sent so will
[57:37] this messenger will pull out? So we see
[57:41] that again it's Christ
[57:45] impersonated in this office. Now he is
[57:48] our brother. Brother Brandham is our
[57:50] brother. Brother Brandham was just a
[57:52] sinner saved by grace. He's a man. He
[57:56] says that throughout this message, but
[57:58] there is an element of his ministry
[58:00] that's so profoundly
[58:03] uh in line with the word that many of
[58:06] his friends and followers mistake him
[58:09] for the Messiah. Amen. And even the
[58:12] Christ, even some will baptize in his
[58:15] name and even worship him. But is that
[58:19] scriptural? Yes, it is scriptural. Is it
[58:22] is it supposed to be? Yes, it's supposed
[58:24] to be. It's not something we run from.
[58:27] I'm not going to not read a quotation or
[58:29] a vision because there's an element of
[58:31] people doing that. No, no, it's there
[58:35] for me to read it, to embrace it. I know
[58:39] it's there. It's supposed to be there.
[58:42] And what many have done, they've, you
[58:44] know, shied away from it because if we
[58:46] start reading that and start saying
[58:47] that, it's going to appear like we're
[58:49] one of those crazies.
[58:54] Well, I'm crazy anyways. That's not
[58:56] going to make me crazy. I'm already
[58:58] crazy. I'm trying to gain my mind. And
[59:01] my mind, my sanity comes through the
[59:04] word of the Lord. Amen. So the, you
[59:08] know, it's a scarecrow that's put up.
[59:10] That's right. So it controls the
[59:12] preachers and what quotes we No, they're
[59:14] all free to read.
[59:17] When brother Joss comes here to preach
[59:18] or brother George or whoever preach,
[59:20] they're free to read any of the quotes.
[59:22] It's free. The Bible, whatever, it's
[59:25] there. I am free to read all of those
[59:28] quotes and you're free to say amen to
[59:30] all of them, too. Amen.
[59:32] Now, this element is there. Now, let's
[59:34] look at it in the scripture just for a
[59:36] moment. It's found in the scripture in
[59:43] Revelations chapter 19. You'll turn
[59:47] there
[59:50] quickly. And I just want you to embrace
[59:53] the fact that this
[59:56] exists. Now, they can publish that in
[59:58] the papers here in Tucson that some
[1:00:01] people baptize in his name. Some people
[1:00:04] actually worship him. They have their
[1:00:07] pictures in his in their churches
[1:00:09] because they worship him. So the pastors
[1:00:12] that hear that it's like, "Ah man, I
[1:00:14] need to take those pictures down or they
[1:00:15] going to think I'm worshiping him."
[1:00:17] Stop.
[1:00:18] You we we we we do what we do by
[1:00:22] revelation. It's not because we feel
[1:00:24] pressure this way or pressure that way
[1:00:26] or maybe the people will understand us
[1:00:28] better. No, you do. You take a stand on
[1:00:30] God's word. Amen. So, we find this in
[1:00:33] Revelations chapter. What did I call?
[1:00:37] What verse did I want?
[1:00:39] Can somebody help me? I know I got it
[1:00:41] here. What verse did I want? Huh?
[1:00:46] Somebody said 17. Is that the verse I
[1:00:48] want?
[1:00:50] Huh? Somebody, Sister Heather, she's on.
[1:00:54] That's the verse I want. Verse number
[1:00:57] 10 and 1910. Of course, all the
[1:01:03] scriptures are good. 19 is good, too.
[1:01:05] But the one I wanted was verse 10. And I
[1:01:08] fell at his feet to worship him. And he
[1:01:13] said unto me, "See thou do it not. I am
[1:01:15] thy fellow servant and of thy brethren
[1:01:18] that have the testimony of Jesus.
[1:01:21] Worship God for the testimony of Jesus
[1:01:24] is the spirit of prophecy."
[1:01:27] Now, this is the the great apostle John
[1:01:31] who fell down to worship this angel.
[1:01:34] Now, let's take one more scripture. It's
[1:01:36] the next chapter over in Revelations
[1:01:38] chapter 22 and we'll see this repeat.
[1:01:41] And we're going to go deeper to see who
[1:01:42] this angel is. Brother Vanam actually
[1:01:45] tells us who it is. Revelations 22. Now,
[1:01:48] what verse do I want in here?
[1:01:52] Huh? Eight. Who said that? Yes. Thank
[1:01:55] you, brother
[1:01:57] Joe. Brother Joe's an old-timer. Maybe
[1:02:00] next time Joe let some of the younger
[1:02:01] ones get it. No, I'm just Thank you,
[1:02:04] brother
[1:02:05] Joe. You can't win, huh? You can't
[1:02:08] win. Verse number eight. And I, John,
[1:02:11] saw these things and heard them. And
[1:02:14] when I heard and seen what he
[1:02:17] do, I fell down to worship before the
[1:02:20] feet of the who? The angel which showed
[1:02:24] me these things, then saith he unto me,
[1:02:27] see thou do it not, for I am thy fellow
[1:02:30] servant, and of thy what?
[1:02:34] The what?
[1:02:36] This is a prophet.
[1:02:38] Amen. And of them which keep the sayings
[1:02:41] of this book worship God. So who is
[1:02:45] John? John is a type of the
[1:02:48] believer and the angel is a type of the
[1:02:52] messenger that is revealing to the bride
[1:02:55] John the great secrets in the
[1:02:58] revelations. And John got so caught up
[1:03:02] in who this angel is. And let's examine
[1:03:05] who John is. He's not a newcomer. He's
[1:03:07] not a pagan worshipper. He's not
[1:03:09] somebody just off the streets. This was
[1:03:12] a man who walked with Jesus.
[1:03:15] looked at him eyeball to eyeball. He was
[1:03:18] the one that Jesus loved marketably. One
[1:03:22] of the disciples, one of the incrowd of
[1:03:25] the not one of the 70, but he's one of
[1:03:27] the
[1:03:28] 12 that when Judas was being exposed, he
[1:03:32] asked Jesus, "Which one is it,
[1:03:34] Lord?" And Jesus said, "The one I'm
[1:03:36] going to dip my bread in at the same
[1:03:38] time. He's the one that's going to
[1:03:39] betray me." Boom. And he dips. And then
[1:03:42] Judas dips. J John was a real believer.
[1:03:47] John was not like a halfway believer.
[1:03:49] This is real people, real materials. Yes
[1:03:53] sir. And he with all his credentials
[1:03:57] bowed down to worship this angel. Now
[1:04:00] the angel prevented him and stopped him.
[1:04:03] Now verse n chapter 19 just shows it was
[1:04:06] an angel. Chapter 22 shows us that that
[1:04:09] angel was actually a prophet. I didn't
[1:04:12] take time to find it, but it's in the
[1:04:14] message. If the sisters find it for me,
[1:04:16] I shouldn't ask them to do that. But
[1:04:18] brother Vano answers that question that
[1:04:20] that is not um the Lord Jesus that John
[1:04:23] was worshiping. That was a prophet.
[1:04:26] You tell me which prophet it was. Yes.
[1:04:30] Well, we have an example of who that
[1:04:32] prophet was. It was it was the Reverend
[1:04:34] William Brham.
[1:04:37] Ministry so great. It looks like
[1:04:40] something you would hide from. But it
[1:04:42] was a ministry so great that true
[1:04:46] believers would even fall down to
[1:04:50] worship, get so mixed up. Now, is it
[1:04:53] right? No, it's not right. It's wrong.
[1:04:55] Brother Brandon said it was an evil
[1:04:57] spirit. He said it was contrary. It had
[1:05:00] to be corrected. He said all that and he
[1:05:02] told us why it had to be that way
[1:05:04] because his ministry had to replicate
[1:05:08] the ministry of of John. John had the
[1:05:12] same issues. Brother Bham deals with
[1:05:15] this in questions and
[1:05:16] answers and he says this
[1:05:22] here. Don't you love the Lord? All
[1:05:25] right. I hope this helps somebody
[1:05:27] tonight. I believe it does. It shows us,
[1:05:31] you know,
[1:05:32] that that we're right in the word. You
[1:05:35] know, there's an element of people that
[1:05:36] go overboard this way and that way. It's
[1:05:38] supposed to be that way. We know that
[1:05:40] they're going to be there. It's part of
[1:05:43] it. Brother Brandham, this is in
[1:05:45] questions and answers. They asked
[1:05:47] Brother Brandham question number
[1:05:50] 123, 1961.
[1:05:53] Brother Brandon, we know that you are a
[1:05:56] messenger sent from God to this church
[1:05:59] age. The very same signs that follow
[1:06:02] Jesus, we see following you. We
[1:06:05] understand why some who know you best
[1:06:10] think you are Messiah. Would you explain
[1:06:13] the difference in your relationship to
[1:06:15] God and that of
[1:06:18] Christ? Well, I know, brethren, that is
[1:06:20] true.
[1:06:22] See, but let's wait. I got something
[1:06:24] wrote down here just for a minute. Many
[1:06:26] times it's misunderstood. But now the
[1:06:29] person sometimes I want some of you to
[1:06:31] turn with me to Luke the 3 chapter and
[1:06:33] the 15th verse. While you're doing that,
[1:06:36] I might be saying when you get it. Luke
[1:06:40] 3 and going to shut the door. He
[1:06:42] continues on verse paragraph 384. But
[1:06:45] listen, brethren, I adjure you before
[1:06:48] Christ that you you hold this part of
[1:06:52] your peace. But if you're spiritual, you
[1:06:54] would understand. See, don't you know
[1:06:57] what the very first thing he said there
[1:07:00] down there at the river? Don't you
[1:07:02] remember what he said? As John the
[1:07:04] Baptist was sent forth to forrun the
[1:07:05] first coming of Christ, your message,
[1:07:08] it's the message that will forerun the
[1:07:10] second coming of Christ. That's what the
[1:07:13] angel of the Lord said. Now notice
[1:07:15] that's John the Baptist. Now all of you
[1:07:17] have heard that you read it in books.
[1:07:20] You heard people that standing there
[1:07:23] hearing it and everything else when the
[1:07:25] angel itself spoke that message as John
[1:07:28] the Baptist was sent forth to forrun the
[1:07:30] first coming of Christ. You are sent
[1:07:32] with this message will forrun the second
[1:07:35] coming of Christ. Now, the message. Now,
[1:07:38] if you'll notice, little Willie out
[1:07:40] there put my name under the star out
[1:07:42] there. And that's the reason I passed it
[1:07:44] over. You see, cuz I don't think, now
[1:07:47] I'm going to be honest, as I can be, I
[1:07:50] don't think I'd have anything to do with
[1:07:52] that messenger. See, that's right. I
[1:07:54] believe that I may be being sent for a
[1:07:57] part, this church, to help build that
[1:08:00] message up to the place where it would
[1:08:02] be when this forerunner comes, that he
[1:08:04] will come. But I believe me being what I
[1:08:07] am, I believe that I have the message of
[1:08:10] the
[1:08:10] day. I believe that this is the light of
[1:08:13] the day and believe it's pointing to
[1:08:16] that time coming. See, I believe that
[1:08:19] the message that he said down there, the
[1:08:21] message that you have. Now if you notice
[1:08:24] that star that rose back
[1:08:26] there, brother Bam continues
[1:08:29] on and he continues on to paragraphs
[1:08:33] continues says down to paragraph number
[1:08:35] 426. He says a lot of things there and
[1:08:38] he says so now the reason that this
[1:08:40] message this message will have to be
[1:08:43] looked on in this
[1:08:45] respect to prove that it is now we know
[1:08:49] brethren that man cannot be God. Man yet
[1:08:53] he is a god. Each one of you are a god.
[1:08:58] You was made to be a god but not while
[1:09:02] you're in this life. See, Jesus was a
[1:09:06] man just like we are, but God was in
[1:09:08] him. The fullness of God was in him. We
[1:09:10] have the spirit by measure. But being
[1:09:13] that this little light has come, and if
[1:09:15] it is true, if it's the true light,
[1:09:18] that's to herald the message that John
[1:09:20] the Baptist heralded as he said he did
[1:09:23] on the river down yonder. Just look how
[1:09:26] it could be. How it could be anything
[1:09:28] else. Look at me. See, not even a
[1:09:30] grammar school education. when he told
[1:09:33] me these things would happen, not one of
[1:09:35] them has failed. Brother Am continues
[1:09:39] on. He says 420, paragraph 4:29. And so
[1:09:45] he's he reads the scripture in Luke 35th
[1:09:49] verse there. Just start about the 14th
[1:09:52] verse. And they read this the
[1:09:54] scriptures. The soldiers likewise
[1:09:56] demanded of him, saying, "And what shall
[1:09:58] we do? said unto them, "Do no vice and
[1:10:01] no man neither accuse any falsely be
[1:10:03] content with your
[1:10:04] wages." As the people were in
[1:10:07] expectation, and all men mused in their
[1:10:09] hearts of John, whether he were the
[1:10:11] Christ or not, John answered, saying
[1:10:13] unto them all, I indeed baptize you with
[1:10:16] water, but one mightier than I cometh,
[1:10:19] and the l and the latchet of whose shoes
[1:10:22] I'm not worthy to unloose. He shall
[1:10:23] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:10:25] fire. All right. What was it? The people
[1:10:29] were under such expectations of the
[1:10:32] Messiah to appear. When they seen this
[1:10:35] great anointed ministry of a man coming
[1:10:38] out of the wilderness and having his
[1:10:41] campaign and going back in the
[1:10:42] wilderness, many men that was his own
[1:10:45] followers said he is the
[1:10:49] Messiah. They were expecting it. See
[1:10:52] then if this is the true message of God
[1:10:55] for running the coming of John the
[1:10:58] Baptist the same like the same thing the
[1:11:01] Elijah message it'll have to be thought
[1:11:04] of in the same manner see so that
[1:11:09] answers that questions I think exactly
[1:11:11] see it's got to be thought in the same
[1:11:15] manner see brother asked is there
[1:11:18] anything that we are responsible to do
[1:11:20] in order to help anybody that would take
[1:11:24] in a conflict like that or what could we
[1:11:26] do? There wouldn't be nothing. There's
[1:11:29] nothing you can
[1:11:30] do. The brother says a reprobate mind.
[1:11:33] Could that develop in a reprobate mind?
[1:11:35] Well, it would come to a reprobate mind.
[1:11:38] If it come to this, if the man that was
[1:11:41] spoken or would witness that he was the
[1:11:43] Messiah, then we know he'd be a false
[1:11:45] Christ. See, see, as long as a man would
[1:11:48] So, Brother Adam continues on. So he
[1:11:50] showing us that that has to be expected.
[1:11:54] That's part of the
[1:11:56] ministry of this ministry as John the
[1:12:00] Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[1:12:01] coming of Christ. There's an element in
[1:12:04] your Bible that thought John was the
[1:12:07] Messiah. There's an element in the
[1:12:10] message that think that brother Brandham
[1:12:13] is the Messiah or was the Messiah. It's
[1:12:16] part of it. Yeah. And um um but that
[1:12:21] shouldn't stop
[1:12:23] me from taking a stand on what he said
[1:12:26] on the tapes.
[1:12:31] I shouldn't feel
[1:12:32] ashamed for following this message the
[1:12:35] way we do because that element exists.
[1:12:39] How many you understand that? They said
[1:12:41] they want to handcuff you. You read that
[1:12:43] you say that you're going to be
[1:12:45] identified with that group. What? What?
[1:12:47] Whatever. What group? I'm trying to be
[1:12:50] identified with the word of the Lord.
[1:12:52] Aren't you? Amen.
[1:12:54] Amen, saints. That's the conflict of the
[1:12:57] three main scriptures, Elijah, seventh
[1:13:00] angel, but this son of man part seems to
[1:13:03] be the conflict many
[1:13:07] times. But let's take a few quotations
[1:13:12] that will help you out here, help us all
[1:13:15] out, and then we'll we'll close. All
[1:13:16] right, it's already right.
[1:13:19] The son of man in the message proving
[1:13:22] his
[1:13:24] word, paragraph
[1:13:28] 222. Now, we don't apologize for any of
[1:13:31] the quotes. We don't I don't apologize
[1:13:33] for any of the vision. The church age
[1:13:35] book, I don't apologize from reading
[1:13:37] from it. I sure don't. No, because I
[1:13:40] know what brother said about the church
[1:13:41] age book. I don't apologize for the 1977
[1:13:46] uh uh uh things that were said about
[1:13:48] that. Um uh what what do you say about
[1:13:52] 1977? About that should terminate the
[1:13:56] world
[1:13:57] system that that should bring and usher
[1:13:59] in the end. I predict as a student of
[1:14:03] the scriptures that that should be the
[1:14:05] end. I'm not shying away from Did he say
[1:14:07] that? He said it. It's on the tapes.
[1:14:12] I don't have to hide any of those. No,
[1:14:14] no, no, no, no. I embrace it all.
[1:14:18] And if they call us crazy, they called
[1:14:20] him crazy. They said he's a mad man.
[1:14:24] They said John was a
[1:14:26] witch. What they're going to say about
[1:14:28] us. Now look at this. In proving his
[1:14:30] word. All right. Paragraph 2:22. And the
[1:14:34] son of man is revealing himself in the
[1:14:35] same power that he was. Not down through
[1:14:38] the church age through justification,
[1:14:41] sanctification, all these things here,
[1:14:44] but the son of man. Who is the son of
[1:14:49] man? The
[1:14:51] word. And the word is quicker than
[1:14:54] powerful than a two-edged sword and
[1:14:58] discerns the thoughts that's in the
[1:15:00] heart.
[1:15:02] It is the rising of the sun. 1965. We'll
[1:15:05] take this here. Paragraph
[1:15:07] 92 says, "And it to be waved again we
[1:15:10] realize in the last day according to
[1:15:13] Luke
[1:15:15] 17:30 in the Sunday
[1:15:18] again in the day that the sen of man
[1:15:23] will be revealed." What day is that,
[1:15:25] saints? What day is that? Is that going
[1:15:27] to be tomorrow? Is that next week? When
[1:15:30] is that?
[1:15:31] Is that this day? Is that on your tapes?
[1:15:35] Huh? That's on your
[1:15:37] tapes. Just be waved again. We realize
[1:15:40] in the last day according to Luke 17:30,
[1:15:42] in the Sunday again in the day that the
[1:15:46] sen of man will be revealed or waved
[1:15:50] again over the people. What does he mean
[1:15:53] again? It's already waved once to the
[1:15:56] Hebrews in the New Testament. Now it's
[1:15:59] waved again. Now, who is the son of man?
[1:16:02] As I'm quoting now, paragraph 93. Now,
[1:16:04] who is the son of man? In the beginning
[1:16:07] was the word and the word was with God
[1:16:10] and the word was God. And the word was
[1:16:13] made flesh and dwelt among us. And if
[1:16:16] all the teaching that we have in
[1:16:18] confirmation of the word of God by word
[1:16:22] of God by signs by wonders, we see today
[1:16:26] that in the book of Luke here that as we
[1:16:29] just quoted Luke the 17th chapter, the
[1:16:32] 30th verse and Malachi 4 in the
[1:16:36] different scriptures that we are
[1:16:37] acquainted with that the word again is
[1:16:40] waved over the people that the dead
[1:16:43] traditions of man is dead and The son of
[1:16:46] God is alive again with the baptism of
[1:16:49] the Holy Spirit right among us and is
[1:16:53] giving us
[1:16:57] life. How many can say praise the Lord
[1:16:59] to that?
[1:17:03] H isn't there life in this message?
[1:17:08] It's only dead to those that are dead,
[1:17:11] but it's alive to those that are alive.
[1:17:15] They the the it that song they sing,
[1:17:18] it's all over me. It's keeping me alive.
[1:17:21] It's the Holy Ghost and fire. It's
[1:17:23] keeping me alive. It's the message of
[1:17:25] the hour and it's keeping me alive. You
[1:17:29] wouldn't be alive today without this
[1:17:30] message. No, you'd be doing what
[1:17:32] everybody else is doing. You would you'd
[1:17:34] be doing what everybody else is doing.
[1:17:37] But the reason you're not doing what
[1:17:39] everybody else is doing is because Luke
[1:17:41] 17:30,
[1:17:44] Malachi 4, Revelations 10:7
[1:17:49] came into your life.
[1:17:52] Came into your world view. Thank you
[1:17:56] Jesus.
[1:17:59] Thank you Jesus for the blood applied.
[1:18:05] Thank you Jesus. You have washed me
[1:18:07] wine.
[1:18:08] Thank you,
[1:18:10] Jesus. You saved my life.
[1:18:14] [Applause]
[1:18:15] Yes. He saved my
[1:18:19] life. Brought me from darkness.
[1:18:23] Into glorious light. How many know what
[1:18:25] I'm talking about?
[1:18:28] Yes. Let me read a few more quotations
[1:18:31] for you. Okay. here in the message
[1:18:34] trying to do God a service without it
[1:18:36] being his will that's part of those last
[1:18:38] messages in November of 65 that I quoted
[1:18:41] to you this is paragraph 212 and he says
[1:18:44] this here now he promised that so that
[1:18:48] sets the Bible just exactly to this day
[1:18:52] and Sodom and Gomorrah and Elijah that
[1:18:55] wasn't Elijah that was the spirit of God
[1:18:57] on Elijah Elijah was just a man now
[1:19:00] we've had Elijah's Elijah's coat
[1:19:02] Elijah's mantels, Elijah's everything.
[1:19:04] But the Elijah of this day is the Lord
[1:19:07] Jesus Christ. He is to come according to
[1:19:11] Matthew Luke 17:30 is the son of man is
[1:19:16] to reveal himself among his people. Not
[1:19:20] a man,
[1:19:22] God. But it'll come through a say it
[1:19:26] with me.
[1:19:28] Prophet. Now, he never had two major
[1:19:31] prophets at the same time. Never in the
[1:19:34] world, no matter how much two heads
[1:19:37] can't. It has to be one head. God has to
[1:19:40] get one man under his control. There's
[1:19:43] one God. There's one father, son, and
[1:19:45] holy ghost, but one God over it all.
[1:19:48] Notice, and just use them offices. So
[1:19:52] has he with Elijah, the spirit of
[1:19:55] Elijah, he used that spirit, but the
[1:19:57] same God controlling it all the time to
[1:20:02] fulfill his word. Amen. I like
[1:20:06] that. Modern events made clear like by
[1:20:10] prophecy 65 of December paragraph
[1:20:16] 233. The messenger says this. Jesus when
[1:20:20] he come he was to be a prophet. That's
[1:20:22] right. And today before Jesus comes the
[1:20:25] full manifestation of the person of
[1:20:28] Jesus Christ is to be manifested in
[1:20:31] flesh. Think of it. Jesus said as it was
[1:20:35] in the days of Sodom so shall it be at
[1:20:37] the coming of the son of man. When the
[1:20:39] son of man is being
[1:20:42] revealed. What is revealed? Unfolded
[1:20:46] made known. The secret has been brought
[1:20:49] forth,
[1:20:51] revealed in the day that the son of man
[1:20:54] will be revealed. The world would be in
[1:20:57] a Sodom condition. We've got it, haven't
[1:21:00] we? Yeah. How many believes that it's in
[1:21:03] a solemn condition? That's exactly
[1:21:05] right. Look where it's setting now. Let
[1:21:08] me say this. I was raised in a Christian
[1:21:10] church my entire life. My mom and dad
[1:21:13] raised me in a Christian home. My mom
[1:21:15] was very religious. taught us about the
[1:21:18] Bible stories and about
[1:21:20] Jesus. But I didn't have the revelation
[1:21:23] of the son of
[1:21:26] man. You get that?
[1:21:30] So the world out there has a Bible
[1:21:31] talking about Jesus that can read the
[1:21:33] scriptures. But is the revelation of
[1:21:36] Luke 17:30, has it been revealed or
[1:21:39] unfolded to
[1:21:41] them? No, it has not. Not in its
[1:21:44] fullness. Not according to Malachi 4 and
[1:21:48] Revelations 10 and Luke 17:30 to fulfill
[1:21:53] this scripture because you need the
[1:21:56] office of a prophet to fulfill this
[1:22:00] scripture. Lord Jesus, reveal the
[1:22:03] revelation of the son of man. What is
[1:22:06] the revelation? It's the word being
[1:22:09] revealed or opened up to you.
[1:22:13] Not nail scars. Amen. Not a crown of
[1:22:16] thorns, but the word opening up. Good
[1:22:21] evening, friends.
[1:22:23] Glory. It's the prayer lines. It's the
[1:22:26] recorded sermons.
[1:22:28] That's the revelation of the son of man
[1:22:31] opening up. Amen. If it's not that, then
[1:22:35] everybody that's calling on Jesus,
[1:22:38] reading their Bible, has to be a part of
[1:22:40] the bride. And we know that's not true.
[1:22:41] There had to be a message to open up the
[1:22:44] word. It's the revealing
[1:22:50] of the son of God impersonated again in
[1:22:53] this church. And when you get that
[1:22:54] revelation, you're not going to pick it
[1:22:56] up and say, "There's mistakes. That
[1:22:57] don't mean that, that don't mean this,
[1:22:59] that." No, you'll know this is God
[1:23:01] speaking. Amen. You see the importance
[1:23:03] of the revelation? Yes, sir. Amen. God
[1:23:06] bless you. Don't you love the Lord?
[1:23:08] Lord, open up your word to me.
[1:23:11] Open it up that you can't fail. You sent
[1:23:14] a perfect message. I don't have to clean
[1:23:17] nothing up or help God fix anything. He
[1:23:21] sent the vision the way he wanted it to
[1:23:24] be sent. Amen. And I want to represent
[1:23:26] that. Don't you? Amen.
[1:23:30] Let me take one more as we close
[1:23:36] here. This one I want to read for you.
[1:23:38] All
[1:23:41] right. It brings the
[1:23:47] fullness the entire
[1:23:50] deity. I bring that. I have to I like to
[1:23:53] bring this because it shows us what
[1:23:55] we're quoting from. It's not a regular.
[1:23:57] It's not a pastor I'm quoting from. And
[1:23:59] I'm quoting from the messenger. I'm just
[1:24:01] quoting some brother who came with signs
[1:24:04] and wonders. No, I'm quoting the
[1:24:07] revelation of the son of man being
[1:24:11] revealed. The son of man being revealed
[1:24:13] by the office of a son of man. And it
[1:24:18] can get confusing but it's still the
[1:24:20] truth. Amen. Now let me see this here.
[1:24:24] Last one I wanted to read. Yes. This is
[1:24:27] God's only provided place of
[1:24:30] worship. 1965 there in
[1:24:33] Shreport. Paragraph
[1:24:36] 263. Thank you, sis. You're doing such a
[1:24:38] good job. I I don't think I gave you any
[1:24:40] of these. They're finding them for me
[1:24:42] very
[1:24:44] nicely. The headstone crying what?
[1:24:47] Grace. Grace. Pass from death and creed
[1:24:51] into a living word of the living God.
[1:24:55] God's only provided plan for his age.
[1:24:58] His sons in the word age quickened by
[1:25:02] the spirit like a spark that's lit off
[1:25:06] of something to make it alive and seated
[1:25:09] now in heavenly places in present tense
[1:25:13] already alive and subject to every
[1:25:17] promise in the word. Then what does that
[1:25:21] do? You being a part of God's gene, a
[1:25:24] part of the word, other men a part of
[1:25:26] God's word seated together manifest the
[1:25:29] entire body of Christ because there's no
[1:25:32] leaven among you. See what he's talking
[1:25:34] about, brother Brown. No leaven among
[1:25:36] you, just the word only seated in
[1:25:39] heavenly places in the door where he put
[1:25:42] his name, Christ Jesus. No leaven among
[1:25:46] you that brings the entire fullness of
[1:25:50] the godhead bodily among you. Couldn't
[1:25:54] do it in Luther's age. Couldn't do it in
[1:25:56] Wesley's age. Couldn't do it in the
[1:25:58] Pentecostal age. But in the day when the
[1:26:01] son of man will be manifested, revealed,
[1:26:05] brought back the church together with
[1:26:08] the entire deity of God amongst his
[1:26:12] people, showing the same visible signs,
[1:26:16] manifested, manifesting himself like he
[1:26:19] did at the beginning when he was
[1:26:21] manifested on the earth in the form of a
[1:26:23] prophet God. Oh, glory promised by
[1:26:28] Malachi 4, promised by the rest of the
[1:26:32] scriptures. Where are you worship at?
[1:26:35] The house of God seated in present
[1:26:39] tense. Amen. Don't you love the Lord?
[1:26:43] We got the fullness of the entire deity
[1:26:46] among us. How does it happen? How does
[1:26:50] it make me a son? As I spoke this
[1:26:52] morning, I'm a son of God.
[1:26:55] I'm a redeemed son of God because the
[1:26:58] word has been revealed to me. The son of
[1:27:01] man has been revealed to me. God bless
[1:27:04] you. The musicians will come.
[1:27:08] Amen. Musicians, please come. God bless
[1:27:10] you. Don't you love the Lord?
[1:27:18] Amen. Thank God I'm free. A long time
[1:27:21] I've traveled down a long lonely road,
[1:27:24] but thank God I'm free tonight.
[1:27:27] Amen.
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:36] For a long time I
[1:27:41] traveled down a long lonely road.

[1:27:57] Jesus.

[1:28:55] out of

[1:29:08] his

[1:30:22] blind man that
