[1:33:46] hallelujah there's no better time that
[1:33:49] we can have as Christians apart from the
[1:33:52] time that we spent with the Lord I've
[1:33:55] really really enjoyed myself this far
[1:33:59] I've benefited from the ministration of
[1:34:02] the
[1:34:03] word um how many appreciated that
[1:34:06] message in the morning from Brother
[1:34:12] Paul you know as our brother was
[1:34:15] ministering I thought to myself that you
[1:34:17] know I wish that God could give me p
[1:34:21] stupid manners like uh brother
[1:34:27] Paul I tend to shout all over the
[1:34:32] place I don't know why they called me
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:37] whisper I guess I was shouting when I
[1:34:40] was
[1:34:41] born and they tried to quieten me
[1:34:44] down I don't know how far they
[1:34:48] went but we appreciate the Lord for
[1:34:51] every every one of his children amen
[1:34:54] really really enjoyed as well the
[1:34:57] ministers meeting that we had with
[1:34:58] brother
[1:34:59] Fason amen like brother ISRO said you
[1:35:02] know it's it's almost like if you know
[1:35:05] everyone was here it was just so
[1:35:07] beautiful we appreciate the Lord for
[1:35:10] that amen without wasting much of your
[1:35:13] time I just want us to go straight um
[1:35:16] into the ministration of the
[1:35:19] word last night
[1:35:22] um we lay the background and um by God's
[1:35:26] grace I just want to take it a little
[1:35:30] further and then just bring um a
[1:35:33] teaching around that I said last night
[1:35:36] that I was just laying a background amen
[1:35:40] but before we get to um the word I just
[1:35:44] want to maybe give you a background to
[1:35:48] what I'm going to talk about and how
[1:35:50] this all came to
[1:35:52] me I'm a firm believer in the baptism of
[1:35:57] the Holy
[1:35:59] Ghost I believe that like brother Paul
[1:36:02] was saying that you got to be born
[1:36:07] again the Christian Journey starts from
[1:36:11] there so I'm a firm believer in that and
[1:36:16] um we were just teaching on this I've
[1:36:19] been teaching on it for for years is now
[1:36:22] um but it got to a certain time um when
[1:36:27] I just
[1:36:28] couldn't understand certain aspects
[1:36:31] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:36:34] know you get to a place where you think
[1:36:36] that you understand something and then
[1:36:40] when things begin to unfold then you
[1:36:42] realize that what you thought you knew
[1:36:45] you actually don't
[1:36:47] know I got to that place where I I
[1:36:50] really really got so confused about
[1:36:53] certain things and when I get to those
[1:36:55] levels at times you know then I just
[1:36:58] take time to pray I wake up in the
[1:37:01] morning about 3: in the morning at 3:00
[1:37:03] a.m. and uh I would just go and start to
[1:37:05] pray and I do that for days and just
[1:37:09] carry on and carry on and I was so
[1:37:11] burdened at that time and I wanted to
[1:37:13] find out what what really you know this
[1:37:17] was all about and one day when I was in
[1:37:20] prayer
[1:37:22] really burdened about that
[1:37:24] issue I don't know how I can explain it
[1:37:27] because I can't but whilst I was in
[1:37:31] prayer the Lord revealed to me what I
[1:37:35] had to go and
[1:37:38] read and the Lord directed me to a
[1:37:42] specific Court when I Rose from there I
[1:37:46] knew exactly where to go and
[1:37:49] read now that is has only happened to me
[1:37:52] three times in my life where something
[1:37:55] like that is revealed in such a
[1:37:57] supernatural way and in all the three
[1:38:00] instances it is when I was in
[1:38:03] prayer so I rose up from there and I
[1:38:07] went and I took the message that the
[1:38:10] Lord had revealed to me and I went
[1:38:12] straight to that quotation and there was
[1:38:15] my
[1:38:17] answer and that just changed me so
[1:38:20] completely
[1:38:22] and by God's grace I just want to touch
[1:38:24] on that now this was about 11 years ago
[1:38:28] and since then you know the Lord has
[1:38:30] just been revealing this more and more
[1:38:33] and getting to understand the word even
[1:38:36] in a more clearer way you know when the
[1:38:38] Lord opens up a channel then it
[1:38:40] continues to just unfold and to unfold
[1:38:43] by his grace so we thank God for his
[1:38:46] goodness amen so by God's grace I want
[1:38:49] us to just now come to to the time of
[1:38:51] the ministration of the word I'm going
[1:38:53] to ask you to stand to your feet as we
[1:38:57] get to the reading of the
[1:38:58] word amen praise the
[1:39:03] Lord
[1:39:05] hallelujah this the same scripture that
[1:39:07] we read yesterday for the benefit of
[1:39:10] those that were not here I'm just going
[1:39:12] to just background this and touch on
[1:39:15] what we spoke about before I get into
[1:39:17] what I want to talk about tonight in the
[1:39:20] book of Zechariah IAH chapter 4 the
[1:39:22] Bible says starting from verse one and
[1:39:25] the angel that talked with me came again
[1:39:28] and wed me as a man that is wakened out
[1:39:31] of his sleep and he said unto me what
[1:39:34] seest thou and I said I have looked and
[1:39:37] behold a Candlestick all of
[1:39:41] gold with a bow upon the top of it and
[1:39:44] his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes
[1:39:47] to the seven lamps which are upon the
[1:39:49] top thereof and two olive trees by it
[1:39:54] one upon the right side of the bone and
[1:39:56] the other upon the left side thereof so
[1:39:59] I answered and SP to the angel that
[1:40:01] talked with me saying what are these my
[1:40:03] Lord then the angel that talked with me
[1:40:06] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[1:40:08] not what these be and I said no my Lord
[1:40:13] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:40:15] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:40:18] zerubabel saying not by might nor by
[1:40:21] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[1:40:24] of H who art thou oh great Mountain
[1:40:28] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[1:40:31] plain and he shall bring forth The
[1:40:33] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[1:40:35] Grace Grace un it moreover the word of
[1:40:39] the Lord came unto me saying the hands
[1:40:42] of zerubabel have laid the foundation of
[1:40:44] this house his hands shall so shall also
[1:40:47] finish it and thou shalt know that the
[1:40:50] Lord of horse has sent me unto you for
[1:40:54] who hath despised the day of small
[1:40:57] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[1:40:59] see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel
[1:41:02] with those seven they are the eyes of
[1:41:05] the Lord which run to and fr through the
[1:41:08] whole
[1:41:09] earth and then another
[1:41:13] scripture in the book of second Peter
[1:41:15] chapter 1 starting from verse 5 and
[1:41:19] besides this giving all diligence add to
[1:41:22] your faith virtue and to your virtue
[1:41:26] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[1:41:28] and to Temperance patience and to
[1:41:31] patience godliness and to Godliness

[1:41:36] kindness
[1:41:38] charity we may be
[1:41:41] seated as we bow our
[1:41:44] heads Heavenly
[1:41:46] Father we have read Thy
[1:41:49] word we come now now to this sacred
[1:41:53] part the part that we cannot
[1:41:56] handle father it takes you and you
[1:42:00] alone Lord I confess my
[1:42:03] inabilities but I ask that you can step
[1:42:06] in
[1:42:07] Lord father may you increase as we all
[1:42:11] decrease that's our prayer tonight we
[1:42:14] commit the service into your hands in
[1:42:16] Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you
[1:42:31] praise the Lord so by God's grace we
[1:42:35] just carrying on from where we left amen
[1:42:38] and uh we we want to speak on the zeru
[1:42:42] Babel
[1:42:43] commission amen but by God's grace we
[1:42:45] are going to part two I just want to see
[1:42:48] whether this thing is working or it's
[1:42:50] not no it's not working for me all right
[1:42:53] so we have to go back to to plan B he
[1:42:58] knows our plan B all right so um we just
[1:43:03] carrying on from where we left off last
[1:43:07] night we established last night that the
[1:43:11] Bible tells us of a
[1:43:13] zerubabel the book of Ezra speaks of a
[1:43:16] zerubabel that was there in the days of
[1:43:20] of um uh in the days of Ezra in the days
[1:43:23] of King Cyrus who went to rebuild the
[1:43:26] house of the Lord in Jerusalem but
[1:43:29] Zechariah speaks of another zerubabel
[1:43:32] who we say is building a spiritual
[1:43:36] Temple how do we know that the zerubabel
[1:43:38] of Zechariah is building a spiritual
[1:43:41] Temple we know that because of the way
[1:43:43] that he actually builds that building
[1:43:46] the Bible tells us that he brings forth
[1:43:48] The Headstone with shouting crying Grace
[1:43:52] Grace unto it in other words he doesn't
[1:43:55] come with building equipment he doesn't
[1:43:57] come with an ordinary building material
[1:44:00] that we use to build a physical building
[1:44:03] but he comes with a spiritual angle to
[1:44:06] his building amen we then saw that the
[1:44:10] Bible gives us a way to identify who
[1:44:14] this zerubabel is because the question
[1:44:17] that we have is but who was this
[1:44:19] zerubabel
[1:44:21] and to identify him we say that the
[1:44:23] Bible gives us a way to identify the
[1:44:26] zerubabel and we find that according to
[1:44:28] the Bible in the book of Zechariah
[1:44:30] Chapter 4 in verse number five then the
[1:44:34] Bible says then the angel that talked
[1:44:36] with me answered and said unto me
[1:44:38] knowest thou not what this be and I said
[1:44:41] no my Lord and he answered and spake
[1:44:44] unto me saying this is the word of the
[1:44:47] Lord unto
[1:44:49] zerubabel so there is a specific word of
[1:44:54] the Lord unto
[1:44:55] zerubabel and that specific word that is
[1:44:58] unto zerubabel we are shown in the Bible
[1:45:02] what that word is is that right church
[1:45:06] because we find that in Zechariah 4
[1:45:09] verse number two the Bible says and he
[1:45:12] said unto me what seest thou and I said
[1:45:15] I have looked and behold a Candlestick
[1:45:18] all of God with a B upon on the top of
[1:45:21] it and seven lamps thereon and seven
[1:45:23] pipes to the seven lamps which are upon
[1:45:25] the top thereof so what Zachariah was
[1:45:29] looking at like we said yesterday it was
[1:45:32] something like this I'm on the
[1:45:35] picture it was something like what that
[1:45:38] picture is showing us
[1:45:40] amen praise the
[1:45:43] Lord if you just take me to the
[1:45:47] picture so what Zachariah was looking it
[1:45:50] was something like that and when
[1:45:53] Zachariah said but what is this my Lord
[1:45:56] then he is told that this that you are
[1:45:58] looking at is the word of the Lord unto
[1:46:03] zerubabel
[1:46:05] now a question was asked and the
[1:46:08] question was but is zerubabel not the
[1:46:11] Lord Jesus
[1:46:13] Christ now I give you to understand that
[1:46:15] the scripture says this is the word of
[1:46:18] the Lord unto zerubabel
[1:46:21] so the word of the Lord comes unto
[1:46:25] zerubabel now Jesus Christ is the
[1:46:28] word so the word cannot come to the word
[1:46:32] but the word comes unto a prophet so
[1:46:36] this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:46:38] zerubabel it tells me therefore that
[1:46:41] zerubabel must be a prophet and not the
[1:46:45] Lord is that right church so the word of
[1:46:48] the Lord unto zerubabel so to identify
[1:46:52] zerubba Bell we got to look into the
[1:46:54] word of the Lord that came unto him and
[1:46:56] that is the way that we are able to tell
[1:46:59] who this zerubabel
[1:47:01] is and according to what Zechariah tells
[1:47:04] us is that he's got to come with a
[1:47:06] message around the
[1:47:08] candlesticks around the lampstands and
[1:47:11] when we find that man that brings the
[1:47:14] message aen who is identified as a
[1:47:16] prophet of God then we know that that is
[1:47:19] zerubabel
[1:47:21] and we are not ashamed like I said
[1:47:23] yesterday to declare to the world that
[1:47:26] we know who zerubabel is because
[1:47:28] zerubabel is none other than that
[1:47:30] prophet of
[1:47:32] God I wish that my young man can see me
[1:47:35] but he's hiding behind the screen all
[1:47:38] right so he is none other than the
[1:47:41] prophet of Malachi
[1:47:43] 4 he is our zerubba Bell and how did we
[1:47:48] establish that he is zerubba
[1:47:50] because we know he's the one that came
[1:47:53] and he started preaching on the seven
[1:47:55] Church
[1:47:56] ages and not only did he preach on the
[1:47:58] seven Church ages but after he preached
[1:48:01] on the seven Church ages then God came
[1:48:03] behind what he had preached and he drew
[1:48:06] exactly the same pictures by the pillar
[1:48:08] of fire in other words what God was
[1:48:11] saying was that what this man has said I
[1:48:14] have put my signature to it this is not
[1:48:18] the word of a man this is the word of
[1:48:20] the Lord that has come unto a
[1:48:23] generation so we are not second guessing
[1:48:25] Amen on who has the authorized version
[1:48:28] of the seven Church ages we know who has
[1:48:31] the authorized version because God
[1:48:33] himself came and he Vindicated it by a
[1:48:37] pillar of
[1:48:39] fire and I want to say that it was the
[1:48:42] message of the seven Church Ages which
[1:48:44] is the message of the seven golden
[1:48:46] candlesticks it is what made brother
[1:48:48] Branham zeru Bell
[1:48:51] because Zariah was told this is the word
[1:48:54] of the Lord unto
[1:48:57] zerubabel and I want to say that if he
[1:49:00] had not preached on the seven Church
[1:49:03] ages he could have been Malachi
[1:49:06] 4 he could have been Revelations
[1:49:10] 10:7 but what made him zerubabel to me
[1:49:14] is because he then brought the message
[1:49:16] of the seven churches because that is
[1:49:19] what was saying in the book of Zechariah
[1:49:21] this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:49:24] zerubabel so zerubabel had to come with
[1:49:27] a specific message are you with me
[1:49:30] tonight then we found out amen that the
[1:49:33] main Commission of zerubabel was the
[1:49:36] bringing of The
[1:49:38] Headstone is that right so the purpose
[1:49:42] of the coming of zerubabel was that he
[1:49:44] would bring forth The Headstone thereof
[1:49:47] amen and then we established yesterday
[1:49:49] that that there is only one type of a
[1:49:51] building that can actually have a
[1:49:53] headstone on top of it the zerubba build
[1:49:56] that came during the days of Ezra amen
[1:50:00] he was coming to build a physical Temple
[1:50:03] that was in this form
[1:50:07] here amen and we found out yesterday
[1:50:11] that if you've got a building like this
[1:50:13] there is no way that you can actually
[1:50:15] put a headstone onto it because a
[1:50:18] headstone ties the entire
[1:50:20] building so you can put a Cornerstone
[1:50:23] onto a building like that but where are
[1:50:25] you going to place the headstone if you
[1:50:27] place it there that corner is not tied
[1:50:31] I'm still on the same
[1:50:33] picture if you put it on there that
[1:50:36] corner is not
[1:50:38] tied that corner is not tied that corner
[1:50:41] that is way behind there is no tied so
[1:50:44] where do you place a headstone on a
[1:50:47] building that is in that type of a ship
[1:50:50] there is only one type of a building
[1:50:52] which you can place a headstone on and
[1:50:55] we get to understand that it is in the
[1:50:57] shape of a
[1:50:59] pyramid so when we get to the pyramid it
[1:51:02] is the only building amen if you take me
[1:51:04] to the next one that you can put a
[1:51:07] headstone on because if you put a
[1:51:10] headstone here you tie that corner and
[1:51:13] you tie that corner and you tie that
[1:51:16] corner and you tie the corner that is
[1:51:18] behind
[1:51:21] so the only building that you can put a
[1:51:22] headstone on it is got to be in the
[1:51:25] shape of a pyramid now if brother branam
[1:51:28] was a ruber bell then we get to
[1:51:30] understand that he had to bring amen a
[1:51:33] spiritual
[1:51:35] pyramid because he's building not a
[1:51:37] physical building but he's building a
[1:51:40] spiritual house or spiritual houses
[1:51:44] rather so he had to bring a pyramid
[1:51:47] message and then we found out yesterday
[1:51:50] that in the message is this the sign of
[1:51:52] the end in paragraph 129 the prophet
[1:51:55] says now that was mans and mans and
[1:51:58] months before the pyramid message was
[1:52:01] preached so we get to understand that
[1:52:03] brother Branham preached a pyramid
[1:52:05] message is that right and we establish
[1:52:08] what that pyramid message was it was the
[1:52:10] message the St of a perfect
[1:52:13] man because the prophet says in
[1:52:15] paragraph 373 you remember the pyramid
[1:52:18] message it's the Capstone what did he do
[1:52:22] the Holy Spirit kept off the individual
[1:52:24] and seal it when it added to our faith
[1:52:27] righteousness and godliness and faith
[1:52:29] and so forth and kept adding to it till
[1:52:32] we got the seven
[1:52:34] things and we know the prophet was
[1:52:36] speaking about the message the stature
[1:52:39] of a perfect
[1:52:40] man now the main part of the message of
[1:52:44] zerubabel like I said it is the bringing
[1:52:46] down of The
[1:52:48] Headstone and if brother Bram came and
[1:52:51] if he did not bring down the headstone
[1:52:54] then it means he was not zerubba Bell
[1:52:57] because before zerubabel the pyramid
[1:53:00] amen cannot be completed because the
[1:53:03] headstone has not yet come there on if
[1:53:06] you take me to the picture so if you are
[1:53:09] building
[1:53:10] aen we're going
[1:53:15] forward so if we are building aen then
[1:53:19] the way that this picture can only be
[1:53:23] completed is if the headstone comes on
[1:53:26] it before The Headstone comes on it it
[1:53:29] is not complete are you with
[1:53:31] me praise the Lord in the highest so
[1:53:35] because brother Bram we know was the
[1:53:37] ruber bell and if he was the ruber Bell
[1:53:40] then we can emphatically say that that
[1:53:43] pyramid was completed wow why because
[1:53:47] the Bible says truly Elijah shall shall
[1:53:50] first come and restore all
[1:53:53] things not some things but all
[1:53:58] things and the Bible also tells us that
[1:54:01] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:54:03] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:54:06] mystery of God shall be
[1:54:10] finished so if he came he finished the
[1:54:12] mysteries of God if he came He restored
[1:54:16] all things and not part things therefore
[1:54:19] I can as well give you to understand
[1:54:21] that the pyramid was
[1:54:25] completed is a right
[1:54:27] Church why because he
[1:54:31] came but then as we take it a step
[1:54:34] further I want to say that though I'm
[1:54:37] saying that the headstone came and The
[1:54:39] Headstone is here but the way that God
[1:54:42] actually does it the prophet tells us in
[1:54:44] the message the stature of a perfect man
[1:54:48] because he says there are two big
[1:54:50] beings to which he brings the headstone
[1:54:54] the prophet of God says in paragraph 354
[1:54:57] and this being when it's completed is
[1:55:00] the Church of God going into the
[1:55:03] Rapture and this being and completed is
[1:55:07] a servant of God in the Church of God
[1:55:10] that's going in the Rapture Glory see
[1:55:14] what I mean there you are there is the
[1:55:18] full thing so the prophet tells us amen
[1:55:22] that there are two beings upon Who The
[1:55:25] Headstone is going to come take me to
[1:55:27] the picture one
[1:55:31] step so there are two beings upon whom
[1:55:34] this the the the The Headstone is going
[1:55:37] to
[1:55:38] come all right he's not moving at the
[1:55:42] pace that I want him to move but it's
[1:55:44] okay so the prophet of God tells us that
[1:55:47] this being here which is the one that is
[1:55:49] in red amen that is the Church of God
[1:55:53] that is going in the
[1:55:55] Rapture and then he turns around and he
[1:55:58] says and this being here glory to God is
[1:56:02] the
[1:56:03] individual amen is the sevenant of God
[1:56:06] that is in the Church of God that is
[1:56:08] going in the Rapture so how did God
[1:56:12] actually do this the way that God did it
[1:56:15] he sends a message amen that produces
[1:56:18] this being here which is the Church of
[1:56:21] God that is going in the
[1:56:24] Rapture so there is a being that God is
[1:56:27] dealing with that is going in the
[1:56:30] Rapture and that is represented by the
[1:56:32] seven churches and the Seven Church age
[1:56:34] Messengers but then there is an
[1:56:36] individual that is in the Church of God
[1:56:39] that is going in the Rapture so what God
[1:56:42] did is he completed the being which is
[1:56:46] the church that goes into the rapture
[1:56:50] the full mechanics of that church God
[1:56:53] brought down when he brought Malachi
[1:56:56] 4 who is our zeruel are we with me are
[1:57:00] you with me tonight so that was
[1:57:03] completed but when that was completed
[1:57:06] where is the work of God now the work of
[1:57:08] God is now on this being
[1:57:11] here I'm still on the
[1:57:16] picture the work of God is still amen
[1:57:19] now the focus is on this being
[1:57:22] here glory to God and that being amen
[1:57:27] which is the individual he is the one
[1:57:29] that is going into the Rapture are you
[1:57:32] following me
[1:57:34] Church glory to God in the highest so
[1:57:38] the focus praise the Lord is now on that
[1:57:42] individual it is now on you and I we are
[1:57:45] the focus of the message of the
[1:57:48] hour and I hear the prophet of God
[1:57:50] begins to tell me and he says in
[1:57:53] paragraph 172 Christ never sent me to
[1:57:56] build
[1:57:57] organizations Christ sent me to build
[1:58:01] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[1:58:06] Christ that there might be the
[1:58:08] PowerHouse by the that there might be
[1:58:11] the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of
[1:58:13] the Spirit by his word by his word see
[1:58:19] build up the individual to that
[1:58:22] place so the focus of the message of the
[1:58:25] hour it is the building of the
[1:58:28] individuals and I hear the prophet loud
[1:58:30] and clear and the prophet says God never
[1:58:33] sent me to build organizations but God
[1:58:36] sent me to build
[1:58:38] individuals God sent the prophet to
[1:58:40] build you and I we are the focus of the
[1:58:44] message of the hour we are the ones that
[1:58:46] are to be built built what to Hallelujah
[1:58:50] built amen into the stature of Jesus
[1:58:54] Christ what for that we might become the
[1:58:57] dwelling place of the Spirit by his
[1:59:03] Works glory to God in the
[1:59:06] highest
[1:59:08] Hallelujah so now the prophet of God
[1:59:11] because he's a Ruel he's now going to
[1:59:13] come with a message that is going to
[1:59:14] build the
[1:59:17] individual and that's now he turns to
[1:59:21] the book of
[1:59:22] Peter and he now pulls the scripture of
[1:59:25] second Peter chapter
[1:59:27] 1 and then in second Peter chapter 1 the
[1:59:30] Bible says and besides this giving all
[1:59:33] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:59:35] to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:59:38] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[1:59:41] and to patience godliness and to
[1:59:43] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:59:45] brotherly kindness
[1:59:48] charity and we know that from here this
[1:59:51] is where the prophet of God preached the
[1:59:53] pyramid message is that right church now
[1:59:56] when the prophet of God preached that
[1:59:58] message he was drawing a picture of a
[2:00:01] pyramid and as he drew that picture of
[2:00:04] the pyramid he amen had to make some
[2:00:07] certain diagrams onto it praise the Lord
[2:00:11] in the highest if you take me to the
[2:00:12] picture so the prophet drew that picture
[2:00:15] as he preached that message that was the
[2:00:18] pyramid that the Prophet
[2:00:20] Drew but now when the prophet brought
[2:00:24] this message then he placed the holy
[2:00:28] ghost at the top
[2:00:31] here
[2:00:33] amen and when the prophet placed the
[2:00:35] holy ghost at the top
[2:00:38] there that gives rise to different
[2:00:44] understandings and that is where our
[2:00:46] lesson is going to be tonight
[2:00:49] before we get to the preaching
[2:00:52] part
[2:00:55] Hallelujah the prophet plac the Holy
[2:00:58] Ghost right at the top there amen and
[2:01:02] this brings us to a very important
[2:01:05] lesson because the prophet placed the
[2:01:07] Holy Ghost up there it gives the
[2:01:10] impression that before you get the Holy
[2:01:13] Ghost you got to add all these
[2:01:16] virtues and you can't get the Holy Ghost
[2:01:19] until you have added all these virtues
[2:01:21] because the Holy Ghost is up here
[2:01:24] hallelujah is that
[2:01:26] right not only does it give that
[2:01:29] impression and watch I'm saying an
[2:01:31] impression not only does it give that
[2:01:33] impression but after we had picked up
[2:01:35] that impression than many of us
[2:01:37] including myself back then before 11
[2:01:40] years ago I heard then the understanding
[2:01:43] that because the prophet in many
[2:01:45] quotations he says the baptism of the
[2:01:47] Holy Ghost is the new New
[2:01:50] Birth it then gives the understanding
[2:01:53] that the new birth is also up there come
[2:01:58] on but I want to say to you tonight to
[2:02:01] say that the new birth is up there is
[2:02:04] actually an
[2:02:09] error why do I say what I'm saying
[2:02:12] praise the Lord in the
[2:02:17] highest okay
[2:02:19] there's a bit of a slight delay in the
[2:02:21] change of the screens so just bear with
[2:02:23] us praise the Lord so now I'm saying
[2:02:28] that to place the new birth at the top
[2:02:32] here is actually an
[2:02:37] error and why do I say that it is an
[2:02:40] error because when the prophet of God
[2:02:42] preached the message the stat of a
[2:02:44] perfect man he never placed the new
[2:02:47] birth at the top here come on come
[2:02:51] on now I had listened to the message the
[2:02:54] stature of a perfect man I had read the
[2:02:57] message the stature of a perfect man but
[2:02:59] I'd never got to understand
[2:03:04] that but when the prophet preached the
[2:03:06] message the stature of a perfect man
[2:03:09] though he placed the holy ghost at the
[2:03:11] top here but he never place the new
[2:03:13] birth at the top here where did the
[2:03:16] prophet place the new birth he the new
[2:03:19] birth at the bottom
[2:03:23] here oh let's get into the message of
[2:03:26] the Prophet so that we can prove this by
[2:03:28] the message the stature of a perfect man
[2:03:31] the prophet in the message the stature
[2:03:33] of a perfect man in paragraph 1141 he
[2:03:35] says and here is what we do what's the
[2:03:38] first thing have faith and be born again
[2:03:43] that's laying the
[2:03:47] foundation oh glory to
[2:03:50] God oh glory to God this is what we do
[2:03:55] what's the first thing have faith and be
[2:03:58] born again take me to the
[2:04:01] court that's laying the
[2:04:07] foundation so where do we find the
[2:04:09] foundation according to the prophet it
[2:04:11] is at the
[2:04:13] bottom have faith and be born again
[2:04:16] where do we find the new birth it is at
[2:04:18] the Foundation
[2:04:20] stage hallelujah oh let's establish that
[2:04:24] according to the Prophet The Prophet
[2:04:26] then in paragraph 142 then he says and
[2:04:29] after we lay the foundation secondly you
[2:04:32] add to your foundation add to your faith
[2:04:35] Peter said here add to your faith first
[2:04:38] you have faith then you add virtue to
[2:04:40] your faith this is the next column first
[2:04:42] pour your foundation Faith then to your
[2:04:46] faith add virtue come so the first thing
[2:04:50] that you got to do it is to pull the
[2:04:53] foundation then in paragraph 102 the
[2:04:56] prophet of God says notice you must be
[2:04:59] born
[2:05:00] again and when you are born again you
[2:05:03] can be born again without having faith
[2:05:07] that's right so you see on my chart here
[2:05:10] I got the very Foundation faith is the
[2:05:14] foundation of all of it for without
[2:05:17] faith it is impossible to please
[2:05:21] God so the prophet of God glory to God
[2:05:25] he put Faith at the foundation and he
[2:05:28] says have faith and be born again take
[2:05:32] me to the picture so he says have faith
[2:05:35] and be born again but where is Faith it
[2:05:38] is at the foundation here so the new
[2:05:40] birth is at the foundation
[2:05:45] there so now we can make this chat
[2:05:48] clearer and I can get back to the
[2:05:50] diagram I was using yesterday praise the
[2:05:52] Lord take me to the next one so have
[2:05:56] faith and be born again so we find then
[2:05:59] that the new birth is the foundation and
[2:06:03] it is right here at the
[2:06:06] bottom glory to God in the highest and
[2:06:10] we are clear according to the message
[2:06:11] the stature of a perfect man that that
[2:06:13] is where the Prophet go the prophet of
[2:06:15] God placed the new
[2:06:17] birth
[2:06:19] but we still have the baptism of the
[2:06:21] Holy Ghost up
[2:06:24] there and the question that then comes
[2:06:26] to a Believer is then what do we do with
[2:06:29] the quotations where brother Branham
[2:06:31] says that the new birth is the baptism
[2:06:33] of the Holy
[2:06:34] Ghost I give you to understand that yes
[2:06:38] the new birth is still the baptism of
[2:06:40] the Holy
[2:06:42] Ghost we have quotations that say that
[2:06:45] many quotations that say
[2:06:47] that I'll just take one or two here the
[2:06:51] prophet of God says in the smiling
[2:06:52] Church ede what is the baptism with the
[2:06:55] Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing
[2:06:58] you into the body of Christ it is the
[2:07:02] new
[2:07:03] birth Hallelujah so the baptism of the
[2:07:07] Holy Ghost is the new birth it is the
[2:07:10] spirit of God coming in and filling you
[2:07:13] after you have repented having heard his
[2:07:17] words Oh Glory to God so what is it that
[2:07:21] happens you hear the word like brother
[2:07:24] Paul was preaching in the morning uh
[2:07:26] when you hear the word Acts chapter 2
[2:07:29] amen verse 37 they were pricked in their
[2:07:32] heart there was conviction that Came
[2:07:34] Upon them and when that conviction Came
[2:07:36] Upon them Hallelujah then they repented
[2:07:39] and after the repentance it leads you to
[2:07:42] a
[2:07:44] birth
[2:07:46] Hallelujah and of course there are many
[2:07:48] quotations we know where the prophet of
[2:07:50] God also says that the new birth is not
[2:07:53] the baptism of the Holy
[2:07:55] Ghost is that
[2:07:59] right and then the question then comes
[2:08:01] so is there a contradiction in the
[2:08:04] message there is no contradiction in the
[2:08:06] message and that brings us now to what
[2:08:08] brother Ferguson was saying in the
[2:08:10] ministers
[2:08:11] meeting there's got to be a
[2:08:13] Reconciliation of these
[2:08:15] quotations oh praise the Lord in the
[2:08:17] highest
[2:08:19] we got to be real good students of the
[2:08:22] word the Lord Jesus Christ is said in
[2:08:25] the Book of Luke chapter 24 verse number
[2:08:28] 25 he says oh fools slow of heart to
[2:08:32] believe all that the prophets have
[2:08:36] said now we are not fools
[2:08:39] amen we are children of the most high
[2:08:43] and as children of the most high we
[2:08:45] believe all that the prophet is saying
[2:08:49] if the prophet says the new birth is not
[2:08:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we say
[2:08:54] Amen if the prophet says the bapt the
[2:08:57] the new birth is the baptism of the Holy
[2:08:59] Ghost we still say
[2:09:02] Amen but there's got to be a
[2:09:04] Reconciliation of these quotations and I
[2:09:07] am here to tell you that those
[2:09:08] quotations indeed they
[2:09:12] reconcile we ain't got time to go
[2:09:14] through the reconciliation of it but I
[2:09:16] believe that they perfectly
[2:09:19] reconcile the question is when he is
[2:09:22] saying that the baptism of the Holy
[2:09:24] Ghost is the new birth and when he's
[2:09:25] saying the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:09:28] not the new birth what exactly is he
[2:09:30] referring
[2:09:33] to glory to
[2:09:36] God but we know that the baptism of the
[2:09:39] Holy Ghost is the new birth is that
[2:09:42] right he goes on and he says here we all
[2:09:46] know that the Bible teaches the new
[2:09:48] birth and they substitute handshakes and
[2:09:50] everything else for the new birth but it
[2:09:52] will never take the place of the new
[2:09:54] birth it's got to be an experience a
[2:09:58] born
[2:10:01] again so the new birth is still an
[2:10:03] experience he goes on and he says we all
[2:10:06] know that any kind of a birth is a
[2:10:09] mess that's what the new birth is it's a
[2:10:12] mess but it brings life it ain't a style
[2:10:17] or a put on or a Declaration of of
[2:10:19] Creeds is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:22] and that's the secret of the real
[2:10:25] believing Church born
[2:10:28] [Music]
[2:10:30] again what is the secret of the real
[2:10:32] believing Church it is the new
[2:10:36] birth glory to God in the highest so I
[2:10:40] can as well come back to my picture now
[2:10:43] and I can say yes according to the
[2:10:45] quotations if you take me to the picture
[2:10:47] the prophet of God has told us that the
[2:10:49] new birth
[2:10:53] amen is the baptism of the Holy
[2:10:57] Ghost is that
[2:10:59] right is that what the quotations are
[2:11:01] telling us so we can as well we know
[2:11:04] that according to stature of a perfect
[2:11:06] man he has placed the baptism of the
[2:11:08] Holy Ghost at the foundation he has told
[2:11:11] us that the new birth is the baptism of
[2:11:13] the Holy Ghost but we still have the
[2:11:16] Holy Ghost that is up here
[2:11:21] and the question that then comes is so
[2:11:24] what is this holy ghost that is up
[2:11:27] here do we have two different holy
[2:11:30] ghosts the answer is
[2:11:32] no there is only one Holy Ghost Oh Glory
[2:11:36] to God so how come then Preacher Man
[2:11:40] that we've got the baptism of the Holy
[2:11:42] Ghost here and we've got the baptism of
[2:11:44] the Holy Ghost up there what is going on
[2:11:46] Preacher Man let me say to you that the
[2:11:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a
[2:11:52] single
[2:11:54] event but the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:57] Hallelujah it is a
[2:12:00] journey oh let me bring it to the
[2:12:03] quotations the prophet of God says we
[2:12:06] should be
[2:12:07] unfolding God's spirit pouring out not
[2:12:11] just one little GHA not one little
[2:12:13] baptism but baptism after baptism not
[2:12:18] Revelation just shall leave by faith or
[2:12:21] sanctification or the gifts of the
[2:12:23] Spirit but revelation after Revelation
[2:12:26] power after power glory after Glory so
[2:12:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not a
[2:12:34] single
[2:12:37] event Oh Glory to God in the
[2:12:42] highest but the prophet of God tells us
[2:12:45] exactly how he believes these things
[2:12:49] because he says in the message you must
[2:12:51] be born again in paragraph 35 he says
[2:12:54] and now I'm saying this and I know it's
[2:12:57] going on tape and I want to say this to
[2:12:59] the
[2:13:05] pastors I want to say this to the
[2:13:07] pastors that will perhaps receive this
[2:13:09] step I suppose maybe just a little
[2:13:13] different from what the regular Church
[2:13:15] teaches it I teach and believe and
[2:13:20] believe can sufficiently prove by the
[2:13:22] scripture that you are born of the
[2:13:25] spirit and then baptized into the body
[2:13:30] by the Holy
[2:13:33] Spirit and the prophet of God says here
[2:13:37] and you are born of the spirit and then
[2:13:40] I'm still on the same one and then glory
[2:13:43] to God baptized into the body by the
[2:13:47] Holy Spirit
[2:13:49] Hallelujah and then means that it's
[2:13:53] something that is coming
[2:13:54] after so you are born of the spirit of
[2:13:57] God and then after you born of the
[2:13:59] spirit of God and
[2:14:02] then and the prophet of God says I want
[2:14:05] to say this to the pastors I teach and
[2:14:08] believe and believe can sufficiently
[2:14:11] prove by the
[2:14:13] scripture Oh Glory to
[2:14:16] God so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:14:19] not a single event but the baptism of
[2:14:22] the Holy Ghost is a journey according to
[2:14:24] the prophet it starts with a new birth
[2:14:27] and then it begins to
[2:14:30] grow
[2:14:32] Hallelujah he puts it in another way
[2:14:35] when he gives us the example of a
[2:14:37] baton the message uncertain sound he
[2:14:40] says in paragraph 42 as I Illustrated it
[2:14:44] like a
[2:14:45] Buton when a man is saved that much of
[2:14:48] him is God that's the little light that
[2:14:51] comes in to make him quit doing what's
[2:14:53] wrong now if you can take all the malice
[2:14:56] and envy and strife and unbelief out
[2:14:59] that little button like of the light and
[2:15:02] power of God will keep growing growing
[2:15:07] growing growing crowding out unbelief
[2:15:11] and you don't do it by exaltations or
[2:15:13] bodily exercise you do it by a
[2:15:16] sanctified consecrated life that the
[2:15:19] holy spirit moves through
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:24] you oh glory to God how are you going to
[2:15:28] grow when you are served glory to God a
[2:15:32] little light like the size of a Pon
[2:15:34] comes inside of you but then now that
[2:15:36] little light of Amen that is the size of
[2:15:39] a Buton which is the power of God
[2:15:42] hallelujah will keep growing uh and it
[2:15:44] will keep growing uh and it will keep
[2:15:45] growing and growing and growing uh
[2:15:47] crowding out unbelief uh how is it going
[2:15:50] to be growing uh as you are living a
[2:15:52] Sanctified life and as you are having
[2:15:54] the Holy Spirit move through
[2:16:02] you is that what the prophet is saying
[2:16:06] church so there is a growth that is
[2:16:08] coming and the question then comes so
[2:16:11] where are you growing
[2:16:13] to
[2:16:15] Hallelujah what are you growing
[2:16:18] true Oh Glory to God the prophet of God
[2:16:22] in the message Blasphemous name names
[2:16:25] let me just as well say right here that
[2:16:27] the message the stature of a perfect man
[2:16:30] and the message blasphemia names are
[2:16:32] exactly the same
[2:16:38] messages and if you want to get the full
[2:16:40] picture of the stat of a perfect man you
[2:16:43] got to go through the two messages
[2:16:45] together that's the only way that you're
[2:16:47] going to get the full picture of what
[2:16:49] the prophet was bringing here so we get
[2:16:52] now to the message Blasphemous names and
[2:16:55] in paragraph 168 the prophet of God says
[2:16:58] now when the member is born by the Holy
[2:17:01] Ghost into the family of
[2:17:04] God so what happens first a member is
[2:17:07] born by the Holy Ghost into the family
[2:17:10] of God
[2:17:13] and something is now coming has proven
[2:17:17] to heaven these virtues in him that God
[2:17:19] can see virtue knowledge Temperance
[2:17:22] patience brotherly kindness and
[2:17:24] godliness in him then God seals
[2:17:29] him all places
[2:17:32] him and there that's where you see the
[2:17:35] Sons and Daughters of
[2:17:37] God so the prophet introduces another
[2:17:40] word here he says then God seals him so
[2:17:43] there is the baptism amen which is at
[2:17:46] Birth and then after the baptism of at
[2:17:49] Birth I'm still on the same cord then
[2:17:51] after the baptism at Birth hallelujah
[2:17:53] what happens next then the believer is
[2:17:56] proved to have these virtues inside of
[2:17:59] him that God can see all these virtues
[2:18:02] then God comes and seals him but then
[2:18:06] the prophet then changes the language
[2:18:08] and he says then places
[2:18:12] him Hallelujah now we are talking about
[2:18:15] the placing of a son yes
[2:18:18] and I've had to highlight it to say all
[2:18:20] places him now when we started talking
[2:18:22] about the placing of his son what are we
[2:18:25] now talking
[2:18:27] about we are now talking about
[2:18:30] adoption is that right church so a
[2:18:33] member is Born Into the family by the
[2:18:36] Holy Ghost and then is proved to have
[2:18:39] these virtues then God places
[2:18:42] him but the placing of a son it is the
[2:18:46] adoption of a son
[2:18:51] son take me to the diagram now so in the
[2:18:54] diagram we can now say that a member is
[2:18:57] Born Into the family of God and when a
[2:18:59] member is Born Into the family of God
[2:19:02] he's born by the Holy Ghost then he
[2:19:04] proves to have these
[2:19:06] virtues Faith virtue knowledge
[2:19:08] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[2:19:11] kindness amen then the prophet says then
[2:19:13] he seals him or places him
[2:19:23] brother whisper is it you that is just
[2:19:25] saying this or the prophet really said
[2:19:28] it it is the prophet that said
[2:19:31] it brother whisper are you saying that
[2:19:34] the prophet says that at the top here
[2:19:36] this is your
[2:19:38] adoption yes that's what the prophet of
[2:19:40] God
[2:19:41] says oh let me prove it by the
[2:19:44] quotations so that you know it is not me
[2:19:47] that is saying this but it is the
[2:19:48] prophet that's the way he taught
[2:19:51] it in the message blasphemia names he
[2:19:54] says then you have the spiritual you
[2:19:56] will be you have the Holy Spirit and
[2:19:59] will seal all these things unto you is
[2:20:01] that Holy Spirit covers this from your
[2:20:04] faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in
[2:20:07] with Christ then you become one amen you
[2:20:10] become one see you and Christ live
[2:20:14] together if that day you will know that
[2:20:16] I'm in the Father the father in me I in
[2:20:20] you and you in me see then that's a
[2:20:24] sealed unit of the Lord
[2:20:26] [Applause]
[2:20:27] God then he says in paragraph 152 now
[2:20:32] and then they are
[2:20:33] Vindicated
[2:20:36] and
[2:20:38] and oh let's read it together they are
[2:20:41] Vindicated and placed when that time
[2:20:45] takes place they become come Vindicated
[2:20:48] Sons and Daughters of God then he says
[2:20:51] in paragraph 153 do you remember over in
[2:20:55] the Book of Matthew the 17th chapter the
[2:20:58] first to the 5ifth verse Jesus on Mount
[2:21:02] Transfiguration and he says you have
[2:21:04] heard hear ye him the sameon I just hear
[2:21:09] about a year ago preach become so
[2:21:12] popular hear ye
[2:21:14] him and we know what the message here is
[2:21:17] him is all about it is about adoption is
[2:21:20] that right church he goes on and he says
[2:21:23] the placing of a son in Ephesians 1:5
[2:21:27] also God has predestinated us unto the
[2:21:30] adoption of sons see a family when a son
[2:21:35] is born into it it's a son then but that
[2:21:38] son had TOS to raise it and if that son
[2:21:41] never did come to to the right kind of a
[2:21:43] son he never become air but if he was
[2:21:46] the right son and the son that would
[2:21:48] obey his father then that son was
[2:21:51] adopted or placed positionally
[2:21:54] Hallelujah he become air of what the
[2:21:57] father
[2:21:58] H Oh Glory to God in the highest so we
[2:22:02] can conclude safely church that
[2:22:04] according to the message of the Prophet
[2:22:07] that the holy ghost that is at the top
[2:22:08] here it is your
[2:22:13] adoption until 11 years ago I never knew
[2:22:16] it
[2:22:20] Hallelujah that this holy ghost that is
[2:22:22] at the top there according to the
[2:22:24] teaching of the message in the stature
[2:22:26] of a perfect man in the message
[2:22:28] blasphemia names it is actually your
[2:22:32] adoption take me to the picture so right
[2:22:35] there at the top amen that Holy Ghost
[2:22:38] that the prophet is talking about it is
[2:22:40] talking about
[2:22:42] [Music]
[2:22:44] adoption and the prophet has done told
[2:22:46] us that in the Old
[2:22:49] Testament when a child was born that
[2:22:53] child was a member of the family but
[2:22:55] then that child had to be placed under
[2:22:57] tutors and governors to be taught to get
[2:23:00] to maturity and then at a certain point
[2:23:03] he was then
[2:23:07] adopted and let me say church that even
[2:23:11] nature itself it tells us exactly the
[2:23:14] same
[2:23:15] thing you don't give birth to a child
[2:23:19] with
[2:23:22] beards if you give child if you gave
[2:23:25] birth to a child with beard you run away
[2:23:27] from that
[2:23:30] baby you don't give birth to a child
[2:23:33] that is
[2:23:35] talking if the moment the child is born
[2:23:38] the child starts talking you run away
[2:23:40] from that
[2:23:43] child am I speaking
[2:23:45] reality you don't don't give birth to a
[2:23:48] child that is walking if that child
[2:23:50] jumps out of mommy's tmy and starts
[2:23:52] running around the whole Hospital W will
[2:23:55] run
[2:24:00] away so even nature itself tells us that
[2:24:03] the process amen that the way a child is
[2:24:07] born a child is born as a baby take me
[2:24:10] to a picture glory to God in the highest
[2:24:13] so when a child is born the child is
[2:24:15] only but a baby
[2:24:18] but when does that child become a member
[2:24:20] of the family it is the day that the
[2:24:22] child is born that day they become a
[2:24:25] member of the
[2:24:28] family if that child is a poor amen the
[2:24:31] very day that that child is born the
[2:24:34] child is named and the name has got a
[2:24:36] Ser him they are saying that this baby
[2:24:39] though the baby can't talk though the
[2:24:42] baby can't scream though the B sorry
[2:24:44] can't walk but that baby is identified
[2:24:48] as a member of the PO
[2:24:52] [Music]
[2:24:53] family Oh Glory to God even when they go
[2:24:57] to getting the best certificate the best
[2:24:59] certificate will say so and so send him
[2:25:03] this
[2:25:05] family identified as a member of that
[2:25:09] family and there is a lot of rejoicing
[2:25:12] oh congratulations a baby has been born
[2:25:15] to the poor family baby has been born to
[2:25:18] this family there is a lot of rejoicing
[2:25:21] because a New Birth has happened a
[2:25:23] family member has been
[2:25:26] added but that baby that has been added
[2:25:29] glory to God nobody knows what the
[2:25:32] baby's going to grow to
[2:25:37] become but give the baby time glory to
[2:25:40] God then the baby will begin to move and
[2:25:44] he will go amen becomes a toddler from
[2:25:46] becoming a toddler amen I'm still on the
[2:25:48] same picture from becoming a toddler
[2:25:51] that baby will begin to go to school and
[2:25:53] that baby will go to high school then
[2:25:55] that baby will go to college and at some
[2:25:57] point that baby will start to
[2:26:01] work is that
[2:26:03] right but all along amen though the baby
[2:26:07] is growing but father is saying yes you
[2:26:09] are my child but I cannot give you my
[2:26:13] business to handle because you are still
[2:26:15] growing you still need to be to tou but
[2:26:19] there comes a certain time glory to God
[2:26:22] when father now says my son is now
[2:26:26] mature I can give him to handle my
[2:26:29] business and I can give him the
[2:26:31] checkbook Authority that what he signs
[2:26:34] is signed what he fires is fired uh now
[2:26:38] his signature is as good as my
[2:26:45] signature it is the very some son that
[2:26:47] was a baby some years ago but what has
[2:26:50] happened with the baby the baby has been
[2:26:52] growing and growing and growing crowding
[2:26:56] out unbelief and at a certain point then
[2:27:00] the father is happy and when the father
[2:27:02] is happy then the father calls for an
[2:27:07] adoption glory to God in the highest
[2:27:11] then the father says
[2:27:12] now I give you my
[2:27:15] authority speak the word what you speak
[2:27:20] materializes when you are still a baby
[2:27:23] you can speak and people ignore
[2:27:25] you because they say that's child talk
[2:27:29] but when you get to a certain point amen
[2:27:31] even your father when you begin to speak
[2:27:34] the father says okay I'm listening my
[2:27:36] son carry on why because father knows
[2:27:39] I'm now talking to out I'm now talking
[2:27:42] to a mature somebody I'm now talking to
[2:27:45] somebody who I've given
[2:27:51] Authority praise the Lord in the
[2:27:54] highest so when a child is born the
[2:27:58] child amen is placed take me to the
[2:28:01] picture is placed under tutors and
[2:28:04] governors and what are those tutors and
[2:28:06] governors doing they are guiding the
[2:28:08] child to come to their
[2:28:11] maturity and the prophet tells us who is
[2:28:13] the tutor he says the tutor is the holy
[2:28:19] spirit so God gives you Birth by the
[2:28:22] Holy Ghost God hands you over to the
[2:28:25] tutor the Holy Ghost God grows you to
[2:28:28] maturity by the same Holy Ghost is that
[2:28:31] right
[2:28:35] church and I want to say to you tonight
[2:28:38] that we can prove by the word that the
[2:28:41] prophet taught us that every one of
[2:28:44] these stages from one level to another
[2:28:46] another it has got to take a
[2:28:51] birth the prophet of God says in the
[2:28:54] message Blasphemous names he says in
[2:28:56] paragraph 28 it's a
[2:28:59] birth I've been birthed into
[2:29:03] this into this into this into this and
[2:29:08] I've put numbers around it so you can
[2:29:10] see how many times the prophet is
[2:29:13] actually saying it into this into this
[2:29:17] into this and the prophet says it seven
[2:29:20] times then the love of God Christ comes
[2:29:23] down and seals all that I need what for
[2:29:27] for
[2:29:31] service for
[2:29:33] service Oh Glory to God take me to the
[2:29:36] picture so the prophet of God is telling
[2:29:38] us here that you are bir into this you
[2:29:41] are birth into that you are birth into
[2:29:43] that you are birth into knowledge into
[2:29:46] temp into patience into godliness until
[2:29:49] you get to brotherly kindness you are
[2:29:51] birth every
[2:29:53] stage but every birth is a mess and
[2:29:56] every birth takes the baptism of the
[2:29:58] Holy Ghost without the baptism of the
[2:30:01] Holy Ghost they cannot be a
[2:30:07] birth
[2:30:08] Hallelujah so I can as well say saints
[2:30:11] that it takes a birth for us to get to
[2:30:14] the next level and that birth it takes
[2:30:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that
[2:30:20] right
[2:30:21] Saints glory to God in the highest thank
[2:30:24] you it takes a birth amen are you with
[2:30:28] me church and let me say to you tonight
[2:30:32] that it is an impossibility for you to
[2:30:34] even get to a place where you are going
[2:30:36] to add those virtues without the baptism
[2:30:39] of the Holy
[2:30:43] Ghost are we going to prove it by the
[2:30:45] word
[2:30:47] that unless you have the baptism of the
[2:30:48] Holy Ghost there's no way for you to add
[2:30:51] those
[2:30:55] virtues can we show it by the
[2:30:58] word the Bible says unto your faith add
[2:31:02] virtue is that
[2:31:05] right but the prophet tells us what is
[2:31:07] virtue the prophet tells us virtue is
[2:31:11] strength virtue is
[2:31:13] power and the prophet of God says say
[2:31:16] for instance you write a check and there
[2:31:19] is no funds in the bank the check will
[2:31:21] bounce insufficient funds and the
[2:31:24] prophet tells us that that woman that
[2:31:26] had the blood issue when she came and
[2:31:29] touched the ham of the Lord Jesus virtue
[2:31:31] went out of him but the reason why
[2:31:34] virtue went out of him is because there
[2:31:36] was virtue inside of him so before
[2:31:39] virtue can be drawn out of you virtue
[2:31:42] must come inside of you can you say amen
[2:31:45] amen you need to have that virtue before
[2:31:49] that virtue can be drawn out of you is
[2:31:51] that right
[2:31:52] church but virtue is power but how do we
[2:31:56] get power EXs chapter 1 verse number 8
[2:32:00] but you shall receive power after that
[2:32:03] the Holy Ghost is come upon you without
[2:32:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is
[2:32:08] no
[2:32:09] power
[2:32:11] Hallelujah is that right church then the
[2:32:14] Bible says unto your VT add
[2:32:18] knowledge and the prophet of God tells
[2:32:21] us what type of knowledge that is he
[2:32:22] says this is not worldly
[2:32:24] knowledge the prophet of God says that
[2:32:27] is supreme
[2:32:28] knowledge it is a Godly
[2:32:31] knowledge it is a knowledge to know that
[2:32:34] God can't lie it is a knowledge to know
[2:32:37] that God keeps his word is that what the
[2:32:40] prophet
[2:32:41] says it's a supernatural knowledge it is
[2:32:44] not a knowledge amen that is a knowledge
[2:32:47] of this world Amen it is a knowledge of
[2:32:49] the word but I give you to understand
[2:32:52] that you can't add that knowledge
[2:32:54] without the baptism of the Holy
[2:32:56] Ghost why do you say what you are saying
[2:32:59] Preacher Man John chapter 16 verse
[2:33:01] number 13 the Bible says when he the
[2:33:05] spirit of Truth is come he shall lead
[2:33:08] you into all
[2:33:11] truth so in order to get into all truth
[2:33:14] what do you need first you need the
[2:33:16] spirit of Truth you need the baptism of
[2:33:18] the Holy
[2:33:20] Ghost John 4 verse number 23 the hour
[2:33:24] cometh and now
[2:33:26] is when the true worshippers shall
[2:33:29] worship Him in spirit and
[2:33:33] in watch the order of the Scripture it
[2:33:36] is in spirit and
[2:33:38] in in other words you can't get truth
[2:33:41] before you get the
[2:33:43] spirit when he the spirit of truth is
[2:33:46] has come he will lead you into all truth
[2:33:49] true worshippers it's got to start with
[2:33:51] the spirit and the spirit leads you to
[2:33:54] the truth can you say Amen so you can't
[2:33:57] add that knowledge unless the spirit is
[2:34:00] inside of you are you getting me
[2:34:04] tonight oh let's take another one let's
[2:34:07] look at
[2:34:09] godliness the prophet of God says what
[2:34:12] is godliness the prophet says I look
[2:34:14] through the dictionaries I went through
[2:34:16] four or five dictionaries trying to see
[2:34:19] what godliness is all about and I
[2:34:21] couldn't find it but he says I then went
[2:34:23] to a brother's house and right there is
[2:34:26] where I then found out what godliness is
[2:34:28] is then he says what is godliness he
[2:34:30] says godliness is to be like
[2:34:33] God glory to God now how can you be like
[2:34:38] God unless the spirit of God is inside
[2:34:41] of you the prophet of God says if I had
[2:34:44] the spirit of John
[2:34:46] villinger you would expect me to pick up
[2:34:49] some guns I'll be an outlaw is that what
[2:34:52] he says he says if I had the spirit of
[2:34:55] an artist then I you would expect me to
[2:34:58] paint some pictures is that right if you
[2:35:01] want to be like God then you got to have
[2:35:04] the spirit of God so godliness can only
[2:35:07] come after you have the spirit of God
[2:35:09] inside of you say Amen
[2:35:12] [Music]
[2:35:14] somebody so you need the Holy Ghost
[2:35:17] before you can have godliness inside of
[2:35:19] you because it only takes God glory to
[2:35:23] God to produce himself in the life of an
[2:35:27] individual oh let's get this clear
[2:35:29] tonight church and let's really make it
[2:35:32] plain and simple and
[2:35:34] clear now we started by showing this
[2:35:36] diagram take me to it the prophet of God
[2:35:39] says amen that there are two beings that
[2:35:42] the Holy Ghost and the cing of the storm
[2:35:44] is coming on to
[2:35:47] the prophet of God says that there is
[2:35:49] the church that is going in the Rapture
[2:35:51] and there is the individual that is
[2:35:52] going in the Rapture and then the
[2:35:55] prophet of God tells us that the way
[2:35:57] that he has dealt with the church is the
[2:35:59] way that he deals with the
[2:36:02] individual and that's why he
[2:36:04] superimposed these two
[2:36:07] diagrams is that
[2:36:10] right now let's hear what the prophet
[2:36:12] says paragraph 146 Blasphemous names he
[2:36:16] says it has been the holy spirit that
[2:36:19] made the Ephesus
[2:36:22] Church it was the Holy Spirit that birth
[2:36:25] the Manan Church the holy spirit that
[2:36:27] gave the pagamos church and the tiyan
[2:36:30] church in the Dark Ages is the holy
[2:36:32] spirit that's built that
[2:36:34] bride the elect that's pulled out of all
[2:36:37] the organization systems Right Through
[2:36:39] the Ages like that there is an elected a
[2:36:42] predestinated bride of Jesus Christ that
[2:36:45] the Holy Spirit has called out the
[2:36:48] elect and it's been the Holy Ghost in
[2:36:52] This age that age that age that that
[2:36:57] that that and I've numbered them again
[2:37:00] so you can see what he's talking about
[2:37:02] he mentions that seven times in other
[2:37:06] words the prophet is pointing back to
[2:37:08] his diagram to show us that it has been
[2:37:10] the Holy Ghost where if you take me to
[2:37:13] the diagram again it has been the Holy
[2:37:15] Ghost in that age in that age in that
[2:37:19] age that that that
[2:37:24] that but the way he built the church is
[2:37:27] exactly the same way that he builds the
[2:37:32] individual now we all can
[2:37:35] agree that Ephesus had the Holy Ghost is
[2:37:39] that
[2:37:40] right if Ephesus had the Holy Ghost then
[2:37:43] the way he built the church is the the
[2:37:45] way that it builds the
[2:37:49] individual so it means at Faith the
[2:37:52] individual must also have the Holy Ghost
[2:37:55] smer until we go amen until we get all
[2:37:59] the way to laia it's been the holy ghost
[2:38:02] that has been building the church say
[2:38:04] Amen
[2:38:06] somebody if it wasn't the holy ghost
[2:38:09] that build the church then we are also
[2:38:11] saying that even in our age the age of
[2:38:14] brother Branham because that age is
[2:38:17] still under the
[2:38:19] cing it would not have the Holy
[2:38:24] Ghost but the prophet is telling us it
[2:38:27] has been the holy
[2:38:29] ghost that built that church that church
[2:38:32] that church that that that that and the
[2:38:35] prophet says he does the individual in
[2:38:38] exactly the same
[2:38:39] way oh glory to
[2:38:42] God so we can safely conclude church
[2:38:45] that we need the Holy Ghost in order for
[2:38:47] us to climb up amen the ladder to the
[2:38:50] stat of a perfect man it starts with a
[2:38:53] new birth glory to God in the
[2:38:56] highest Oh Glory now I can come back to
[2:39:00] the commission of
[2:39:02] zerubabel and we'll find a place to
[2:39:06] close glory to God Zachariah chapter
[2:39:10] number four the Bible says the hands of
[2:39:13] zerubabel have laid the foundation of
[2:39:15] this house his hands shall also finish
[2:39:18] it and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[2:39:20] host has sent me unto
[2:39:23] [Music]
[2:39:24] you so zeru Babel lays the foundation
[2:39:28] with his hands why is he laying the
[2:39:30] foundation we say it yesterday night
[2:39:33] that the reason why he's coming to lay
[2:39:35] the foundation is because when it comes
[2:39:37] to laia that building has totally been
[2:39:39] destroyed and Christ is standing outside
[2:39:42] of the church he has been kicked out
[2:39:44] completely and the Bible says in
[2:39:46] Revelations 3 CH verse number 20 behold
[2:39:49] I stand at the door and I
[2:39:52] knock he's been kicked out of that
[2:39:54] church Edge he's nowhere near that
[2:39:57] church Edge so because he's rejected
[2:39:59] zerubabel then comes along and zerubabel
[2:40:03] with his hands he lays the
[2:40:05] foundation but what is that Foundation
[2:40:08] the prophet told us that that Foundation
[2:40:10] is the Cornerstone and what is that
[2:40:13] Cornerstone that Cornerstone is Jesus
[2:40:16] [Applause]
[2:40:18] Christ so he comes to lay again that
[2:40:20] foundation and what is the foundation he
[2:40:23] has already told us lay the foundation
[2:40:26] be born again so zeru Babel comes and he
[2:40:30] begins to build the church and he says
[2:40:33] when we are building this church when we
[2:40:35] are building this individual it's got to
[2:40:37] start with the foundation it's got to
[2:40:40] start with the new birth oh let me say
[2:40:43] church this message starts with the Holy
[2:40:47] Ghost this message continues with the
[2:40:49] Holy Ghost this message finishes with
[2:40:52] the Holy Ghost this message is about the
[2:40:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost from start to
[2:40:58] finish glory to God in the highest
[2:41:01] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:41:03] you are feasting on a wrong
[2:41:06] principle he is the principal team of
[2:41:09] the message if he not the principal
[2:41:12] theme of the message you have missed it
[2:41:14] somewhere if you end up with another
[2:41:17] principal theme who is not Jesus Christ
[2:41:19] you have missed it
[2:41:21] somewhere can you say Amen somebody he
[2:41:25] is the Cornerstone and he is the
[2:41:27] Capstone he is the alpha and he is the
[2:41:31] Omega he is the holy ghost at the
[2:41:33] foundation he is the holy ghost at the
[2:41:35] top he is the St and he is the
[2:41:40] finishing he is the same
[2:41:42] God oh glory to God in the heart yes so
[2:41:46] zel comes and he says we're going to lay
[2:41:49] the foundation we're going to start
[2:41:51] again you got to start with the new
[2:41:55] birth you must be born
[2:41:57] again that's why brother Paul was saying
[2:42:00] in the morning young children you got to
[2:42:02] have an experience oh let me also Echo
[2:42:05] that and say you must be born again
[2:42:08] unless you have a true experience of the
[2:42:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost you ain't not
[2:42:14] started you you got to get to that place
[2:42:17] where you become a son or a daughter of
[2:42:20] God you got to migrate from being a
[2:42:22] grandson of God because God does not
[2:42:26] have
[2:42:27] grandchildren God has Sons and Daughters
[2:42:30] say Amen somebody you must be born again
[2:42:34] so zerubabel comes along and he lays the
[2:42:37] foundation and as he lays the foundation
[2:42:40] then he starts to build that house glory
[2:42:43] to God but the Bible says the hand of
[2:42:46] zerubabel it has laid the foundation his
[2:42:50] hands shall also finish
[2:42:53] [Applause]
[2:42:54] it let me say we are living in a special
[2:42:58] age we are living in an age amen where
[2:43:02] zerubabel lays the foundation but
[2:43:04] zerubabel also finishes the building in
[2:43:07] the same age oh this is a special age
[2:43:10] Church it is an age of a Sharp quick
[2:43:14] work glory to God where the house is
[2:43:17] started and the house is completed can
[2:43:20] you say Amen Joel propes side of this
[2:43:24] day in Joel chapter 2: 23 the Bible says
[2:43:28] and he will cause to come down for you
[2:43:30] the rain the former rain and the latter
[2:43:33] rain in the first
[2:43:36] [Music]
[2:43:37] month that is talking about a sh sharp
[2:43:40] quick work oh glory to God because
[2:43:44] ordinarily
[2:43:46] your former rain it comes in another
[2:43:49] month and then the crops begin to grow
[2:43:53] and they begin to grow and at a certain
[2:43:55] point then you have the latter rain
[2:43:58] which is your Harvest rain which is
[2:43:59] bringing the crop to maturity is that
[2:44:02] right so that you can come into the
[2:44:04] Harvest is that right they don't
[2:44:06] ordinarily come in the same month it was
[2:44:09] a type of what was to happen in this age
[2:44:12] that you will have that God is going to
[2:44:14] send the former rain and the latter rain
[2:44:17] all in the same
[2:44:19] age oh we are living in a special age
[2:44:22] church we are living in an age where God
[2:44:25] is doing
[2:44:27] everything he's starting the building
[2:44:30] he's building the building he's
[2:44:32] completing the building all in the same
[2:44:36] age God sent us a message that can bring
[2:44:39] us to a completion say Amen somebody God
[2:44:43] plants the plant God Waters the plant
[2:44:46] God fertilizes the plant with the
[2:44:49] fullness of the word that the plant
[2:44:51] might grow and come to its maturity in
[2:44:54] exactly the same
[2:44:56] age and let me say to you tonight Church

[2:45:11] zerubabel will also finish it so let me
[2:45:14] repeat we are living in an age where
[2:45:17] what God starts is finishing
[2:45:20] it whatever it is that God has started
[2:45:23] he's going to finish it why do I say
[2:45:26] what I'm saying because I am fully
[2:45:29] persuaded Philippians chapter 1 verse
[2:45:31] number six being confident of this very
[2:45:34] thing that he which began a good work in
[2:45:37] you will perform it until the day of
[2:45:40] Jesus Christ oh let me say to you
[2:45:43] tonight if God started a good work
[2:45:45] inside of you he will finish that good
[2:45:47] work he did not start something in you
[2:45:50] so as to leave it halfway he will finish
[2:45:53] what he started are you with me tonight
[2:45:56] are you with me tonight what God starts
[2:46:00] he's going to finish it I don't care
[2:46:02] what the devil is trying to resist it I
[2:46:05] don't care how many demons from the pie
[2:46:06] of hell are trying to resist what God
[2:46:09] started but what God started he's going

[2:52:31] [Applause]
[2:52:33] amen let me drop in two testimonies
[2:52:36] here in our
[2:52:39] church we have a certain sister young
[2:52:42] sister got married and the were
[2:52:44] expecting their first child and as they
[2:52:47] were expecting this first child they
[2:52:49] went to the doctors and the doctors they
[2:52:51] did their scans and they said we are
[2:52:53] afraid that the baby does not have a
[2:52:59] nose and you can imagine how devastating
[2:53:02] that news is to a sister young sister
[2:53:05] just recently married expecting their
[2:53:07] first
[2:53:10] child and the husband and the and and
[2:53:13] the sister they say
[2:53:15] they were recommended and they said we
[2:53:17] recommend that we remove this baby
[2:53:22] terminate and the couple said no we
[2:53:24] can't do it we're going to keep the baby
[2:53:28] so they carried on they went to the next
[2:53:30] SC I don't know yet how many weeks it
[2:53:32] was but say you know you're about 28
[2:53:34] weeks or there about they went for the
[2:53:36] scan and the doctor said the situation
[2:53:38] is still exactly the same the baby does
[2:53:40] not have a
[2:53:43] nose what what do you want to do they
[2:53:45] said we want to keep the baby and they
[2:53:47] carried on Amen went to 32 weeks and
[2:53:50] they scanned again and the doctor say
[2:53:52] that the baby does not have a
[2:53:55] nose but we can't terminate it now it's
[2:53:58] too
[2:53:59] late they said let's carry
[2:54:03] on and the husband and the sister they
[2:54:05] were quiet and they were just
[2:54:08] praying the father of this sister is one
[2:54:11] of our ministers and he's a Gifted Man
[2:54:13] he has the gift of praying for the sick
[2:54:15] many testimonies around his
[2:54:17] life called the dead and he says Dad
[2:54:20] this is what the situation pray for
[2:54:22] me and the father prayed for that girl
[2:54:26] but the father himself started to say to
[2:54:28] this girl and he says you know don't
[2:54:30] worry about it you know these things can
[2:54:32] happen he himself could not amass the
[2:54:34] faith and the child started to say to to
[2:54:37] the dead A Gifted Man and she said to
[2:54:40] the dead why are you saying what you are
[2:54:42] saying you don't have faith I I'm
[2:54:44] keeping the
[2:54:46] baby and she carried on like that she
[2:54:48] never even told
[2:54:50] me one day she was listening to the
[2:54:54] message I was preaching I took the
[2:54:56] quotation where the Prophet talks about
[2:54:57] that woman that came to the prayer line
[2:55:01] and was holding a hanky and the prophet
[2:55:03] says oh don't weep
[2:55:04] sister and then the prophet of God says
[2:55:08] God will heal you and then the sister
[2:55:10] removed the hanky from the face and
[2:55:13] there was no nose
[2:55:14] and the prophet prayed for that
[2:55:16] situation and when the prophet prayed
[2:55:18] for that situation a few months down the
[2:55:20] line the prophet passed through the same
[2:55:22] place and the sister came along and he
[2:55:24] says do you remember me do you remember
[2:55:26] the
[2:55:27] quotation a brand new nose had grown
[2:55:30] there and I was preaching one day not
[2:55:32] knowing that I had a couple in the
[2:55:35] church that were actually going through
[2:55:39] that and they said we took that and we
[2:55:42] said the god of that sister is is going
[2:55:44] to be the god of our child They carried
[2:55:47] on with the with the pregnancy 37 weeks
[2:55:50] they went for the final come the doctors
[2:55:53] had now said this is going to be a test
[2:55:56] case we are getting all the other
[2:55:58] doctors from all the different countries
[2:56:01] this was the best doctor that is in
[2:56:04] London they called the others from
[2:56:06] France and they said get ready this
[2:56:08] child is about to be born we want every
[2:56:10] one of you to come the child came a few
[2:56:13] days earlier than they
[2:56:16] expected but when they went to the 37th
[2:56:19] week then they started doing the scan
[2:56:22] and the doctor stopped and he says
[2:56:27] huh they said let's repeat the scan and
[2:56:30] they did the scan again and the doctor
[2:56:32] was tattled and the sister started
[2:56:35] thinking what is the doctor seeing come
[2:56:37] on and as the doctor carried on then he
[2:56:40] say sister I don't know what happened
[2:56:43] but your baby is got a
[2:56:45] [Applause]
[2:56:45] [Music]
[2:56:47] nose that child was born that child we
[2:56:50] dedicated and that child has a
[2:56:53] nose contrary to Medical signs I'm
[2:56:56] talking about a
[2:56:58] Powerhouse I'm talking about a message
[2:57:00] that has got
[2:57:03] power we've got another sister that is
[2:57:06] in the church if you come to our church
[2:57:08] we'll show you these people they are not
[2:57:10] fake they are
[2:57:12] real we've got another sister this
[2:57:14] sister the doctor say she has got
[2:57:16] something on the back of her spinal cord
[2:57:19] and they said you've got a growth and
[2:57:22] they said this growth is aggressive and
[2:57:24] it is growing at a very fast PA so they
[2:57:27] said we've got to quickly operate so
[2:57:30] they took her into surgery very quickly
[2:57:32] and there was only one doctor that could
[2:57:34] perform that operation and that doctor
[2:57:36] said I've got just one opportunity if we
[2:57:39] miss this we will not be able to do
[2:57:40] anything and because of this growth that
[2:57:42] is aggressive we got to do it very
[2:57:45] quickly they said okay fine let's carry
[2:57:48] on with the operation the sister went
[2:57:50] for the operation the doctor opened the
[2:57:52] spinal cord and they told the sister
[2:57:55] that after we open this you're going to
[2:57:57] be bad reading for some six months
[2:57:59] because it's a very delicate
[2:58:01] operation so they went ahead and they
[2:58:04] did this operation and the doctor when
[2:58:07] he tried to operate then he says the
[2:58:09] growth was too aggressive it had now
[2:58:11] entangled itself around the nerves in
[2:58:14] the spinal cord so the doctor could not
[2:58:16] do anything about it so the doctor
[2:58:19] closed up that
[2:58:22] sister now the sister is going to go 6
[2:58:25] months with an operation that did not
[2:58:27] take away the growth and the doctors
[2:58:30] after they did that then they say to the
[2:58:32] sister 6 months you'll be getting ready
[2:58:35] to
[2:58:35] die because this is too
[2:58:39] aggressive the sister said I believe God
[2:58:45] and the sister said I'm going to start
[2:58:47] listening to the message of the Prophet
[2:58:49] I'm going to listen to the message
[2:58:51] message after
[2:58:53] message she took her earphones and she
[2:58:56] put them into her ear and she said this
[2:58:58] is what I say to Satan I say to Satan if
[2:59:01] you want to stay in this house in this
[2:59:04] house we listen to the word

[2:59:14] better stay but if you want I'm going to
[2:59:16] torment you by the
[2:59:17] word and the sister started listening to
[2:59:20] the message message after
[2:59:22] message then that brother that I was
[2:59:24] talking about that gifted brother he
[2:59:27] prayed for this sister over the phone
[2:59:29] and when he prayed for the sister the
[2:59:31] sister then went into they said you're
[2:59:33] going to get a wheelchair and then you
[2:59:35] know you you you will not be able to
[2:59:37] walk they took her into a uh a ward for
[2:59:40] her to recover and then to go home and
[2:59:42] getting ready to die
[2:59:44] and the sister got into this gear to say
[2:59:46] I'm going to believe
[2:59:48] God the nsy says you're not supposed to
[2:59:51] move one day the NES come into the world

[3:00:02] supposed to be up you can't even be
[3:00:04] standing and the sister said I feel
[3:00:08] well I was just brushing my teeth and
[3:00:12] they said you can't do that he says but
[3:00:14] I
[3:00:16] [Applause]

[3:00:20] take the thing then one day the doctor
[3:00:23] said let's take you back for a scan and
[3:00:26] we see what is happening inside they
[3:00:28] took her back to the scan they put it in
[3:00:31] you know they have to put this liquid in
[3:00:32] there that shows the the growth they
[3:00:35] call it a Dye I think so they put that
[3:00:38] and pumped into her and they took her
[3:00:40] into the scanner and they looked and the
[3:00:43] doctor then
[3:00:44] said put her
[3:00:48] back they said pump some more Dy into
[3:00:50] her and put it back and these people
[3:00:54] that were ping this sister because they
[3:00:56] said it's a delicate case we can't just
[3:00:58] handle
[3:00:59] anyhow then they put her back into the
[3:01:01] scanner and she was wondering what is
[3:01:04] going on then the doctor looked and says

[3:04:42] bothered with that scripture
[3:04:44] because he was the ruber bell and he has
[3:04:47] a message to the mountains so he started
[3:04:50] asking God did you mean a literal
[3:04:52] mountain and God says I meant a literal
[3:04:55] Mountain one day when he's out hunting
[3:04:58] then God says are you not
[3:05:02] hunting are you not looking for
[3:05:04] squirrel speak the word and the prophet
