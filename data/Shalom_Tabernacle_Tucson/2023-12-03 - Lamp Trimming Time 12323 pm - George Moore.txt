be preparing to bring that for us we have a special friend and guest with us today that's brother Jonathan wbe I believe I said that right I believe he's from originally from tanzan or Zambia Zambia and he is one of the Believers from the Tucson Tabernacle fellowships there and he came to our meetings and was in a part of I think the Sunday night service I had the chance of fellowshipping with him a little bit and he's texted me since then he's a singer and a worshipper of the Lord and he's been wanting to come and share some of those gifts with us here and he picked tonight and he said he would like to come and sing and so we're going to have him come and sing and is he welcome to sing can he sing for the amen so come come brother Jonathan he wanted to sing with me but I I can't sing with you tonight because I we got to practice first so but we're so happy to have you with us God bless you richly I'm sure the musicians can probably pick up what you want to do God bless you amen I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so happy that he doesn't know my other side so I'll keep it that way but uh greetings from the pastor uh Pastor Dan says uh greet the church and um I'm brother Jonathan MBE uh from Zambia originally but I've been uh sojourning in your country since February and uh ton Tabernacle was my first church to be or this was my first time to be in the USA okay and then uh through Pastor Dan uh he took me to Phoenix I saw the brothers there then again he took me to Pastor CB's Church so the brothers there and um since I come I think I've ministered three times there then I told the Pastor said look I think let me step aside and help the brothers in the singing and then um I was the one leading songs that day of the youth meeting I saw brother Levi then the pastor says the father to that man is that one there and then uh my eyes went straight to that man and you know brother Brenham says um it is better to give a little Rose to the brother when he's alive then to bring a lot of talks and many of those talks are hypocritical talks because why do you want to say so many things when the man is gone so um I came to the faith in 1989 and then I was um posted from our country I went into diplomatic service in the neighboring country Botswana and um 2005 I was ordained as a minister I had the leral group there the lord gave me a church and then 2007 I was ordained as a pastor and uh the change of government in my country I was led off so everybody that came into foreign Services through that president who was out of power so all the people that went on that ticket were chased away and then uh while is trying to see how best I can live in the country a brother a minister from another city followed me into that City and then he said um you cannot be a pastor here you have to go back to your country because brother mam says a foreigner cannot be a pastor in another country so well the church was broken and um when he heard that I'm no longer with Zambia High commission then um he reported me to the immigration to the state uh intelligence I was arrested I was interrogated and then uh yeah the things were very bad so I was given seven days to leave the country so what do I do to the people Lord so some people went to the world World some remained some were H so when I ran into South Africa apparently the man that ordained me as a pastor his name was Israel so now you can understand why I'm in this church so uh I left and then later uh the Lord told me to go back to that man because I had bitterness and then the Lord told me go back because Ile with him and when you concile with him shake my hand my brother you are not the one okay so um then that thing left me and then I pleaded with him for the sake of the source can we reconcile brother for the sake of the source so I spoke to those who remained some refused to be with him some accepted and then um so so I gave those Brothers there well I'm speaking this because we have reconciled and then uh yeah so um went back to Zambia the pastor you are mentioning about Pastor Chessa that has been my mentor I have preached several services at pastor chesa's church then I've preached in other places I've preached for pastor Jeremiah Pastor chind in cap town I've preached for pastor Becket and meeting these people I met a lot of people so I am explaining this because I want to make a statement on this man here when I saw him I the toon and the pastor brings us here and then I see him here I hear the singing I saw the other ministers said okay I think Shalom Tabernacle they have a good pastor amen yeah I have ministered for 24 years I have traveled I have met men of God I think this church God has blessed them amen with a wonderful Pastor that's right you are a wonderful brother my brother amen shall we stand all over us [Applause] amen I want him to say when brother Jonathan came to my church he gave me a little Rose and I want

standing we'll turn in our Bibles to Matthew the 25th chapter and glad to be back in the States uh uh had a nice week last week in Canada uh had about uh eight Services there last week and so uh immediately after the meetings here after the special meetings the uh the devil come on us and and gave us all a a a head cold and and uh congestion and all that was messing with our voice and you know as a minister if I broke my leg you could prop me up here on the pulpit and I could still get a message out but if you don't have a voice uh it's kind of a kind of a big thing so and you'll notice with ministers that's always where the devil tries to attack is somewhere in your your respiratory your voice and so forth and so uh we got all the way up to that happened come on me on Tuesday uh before I left for Canada on Friday well Saturday uh we had uh the service Saturday night and I was really really bad and uh I text Brother Israel and ask for prayer and and uh and um the the congestion and all that was with me until I stepped into the pulpit and then as soon as I stepped into the pulpit it was gone on and I preached all eight services without any issue nothing in my voice everything was fine it was my voice was just as strong at the end of the eight Services as it was when we started and so that's just the hand of almighty God Amen and so we're so happy to be back I uh bring you greetings from all the churches there and they all asked me to greet you and and I told Brother Chuck at every one of them I don't even just I just say all of them said greet brother Chuck and Sister Barbara for them and and I don't even remember all the people but uh Matthew the 25th chapter tonight and uh we'll get right into the word and we'll read uh the first 13 verses for a scripture reading this was a little thought that the Lord put on my heart this morning and uh it just so happened I believe this was a scripture that was read at the prayer meeting yesterday morning is that I believe was Matthew the 25th chapter so Matthew 25 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there not be enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they uh that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut and afterwards came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading's word let's just bow our heads father we thank you for the opportunity to gather here and Lord we thank you for this service tonight Lord we thank you for your spirit amongst us Lord your presence here with us we thank you that we can gather together with the purchase of your blood tonight Lord we can gather together with brothers and sisters that love the Lord and believe a message today Lord and Lord it's our privilege to be here we don't take it for granted and Lord we thank you for providing us this place and and Lord but most importantly we thank you for your spirit here with us and Lord we ask that you would bless the further part of this service I pray you would speak to every heart Lord and minister to the needs of the people tonight and I pray Lord that you would bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride said amen you may be seated and I want to touch on lamp trimming time tonight just for a quick text before the communion and uh uh the Lord began to deal with me when I woke up this morning about being more sincere pastor and you know the message that you and I have today Saints was brought with the greatest of sincerity it wasn't brought just haphazardly it wasn't brought just any way but it was brought under great sincerity and this wasn't a message today of a man but this was a message from God can you say Amen to that tonight and and and we find that brother brandham said in the angel of the Lord he said while I was sitting in the room since a boy I had a calling on me and I was sitting in the room hitting right on the floor and a supernatural being come walking into the room and an angel said he was sent from the presence of God he said if you get the people to believe you would be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even can now now now to me brothers and sisters I'll take this as the word of the Lord and it says then uh you would ask me does everybody get well brother brandom he says everybody that truly believes gets well and he said thousands have been healed if you'll be sincere when you pray so so as brother Israel's talked about at length the the the angel commissioned brother Brandon to get the people to believe him and he said if you'll be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer is that what the angel said and so brother Brandon's commission had hinged upon him being sincere when he prayed is that right so he had to be sincere when he prayed but he goes on to say not just sincere when he prayed but me and you have to be sincere when we hear the word of the Lord is that right and he said if you'll be sincere and but he said uh you you uh when you pray he said not only did you had to be sincere but it had to be absolute sincerity and it has to be received with absolute sincerity can you say Amen tonight now in my commission he says and we've read this quote many times he he said I'm just your brother but by the grace of God when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you he said maybe I offended you by saying that forgive me I felt that might have been resented but I am God's voice to you see it I oh God he said I say that again that time was under inspiration you see he said now he said I felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it now see I can say nothing in myself but what he shows me I say it he says you believe it and Watch What Happens so brother brandom said if you'll believe what I'm telling you Watch What Happens amen and I've found in my life saints that if you can believe this word it brings it to pass amen there's no promise in this book there's no promise in this word that believing it won't bring to pass amen amen now he says believe he said if you can believe it Watch What Happens believe what believe that William brandom is God's voice to you is that right I am God's voice to you he said brother brandham said I am God's voice to you and he says you believe that and watch what happens now is that right or wrong Saints believe it he said believe it you believe it and Watch What Happens believe what that the seventh angel will have the power of infallibility in this last day believe what that that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age is that right Saints is that what the church age book says believe what that there's only one messenger for each age that receives what the spirit has to say to the churches so you can't be led by the spirit without receiving what that messenger said to the churches is that right Lord now he said believe what whether One messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false now you know I'm quoting this out the church age book but he speaks to You and I by Revelation through the messenger is that right amen amen and he said then the message is broadcast to all but though the message is broadcast to all it's only received by a certain qualified group in a certain way and he said each and individual has the ability to hear and receive what the messenger has already spoken aren't you glad to be the kind of person that can hear and receive what the messenger has spoken for our day that's the program amen that's God's plan that's God's purpose and so we have to believe this and we have to be sincere when we hear this message it's not just a message of a man it's not just a message of a good preacher I like good preaching I I like to hear it I like good testimonies but this is different Saints this is the message from almighty God Amen and we have to be that sincere when we hear the messag amen amen now brother brandom said I didn't put the quote in there but Christ is the mystery he said it's not just sitting and listening to the word amen he said but it's he that heareth my words he he that receives it amen now that's something he said there's something inside you that tells tells you that it's right something inside you that tells you it's right see there was a point in time in your life where you didn't know the message but but when the message crossed your path at some point something inside you told you that it was right amen that's God's program there something in you that recognized the message of the hour that the was wasn't just the words of a man but it was the words of Almighty God tonight that's the ability to hear and recognize what the messenger has said so we're so grateful tonight to hear and recognize there's something inside of you so it's not just if you believe the message you got it it's it's not just oh you hear the tape and you got it it's hearing and receiving what the messenger has already said it's hearing recognizing and acting on the word right see hearing it's one thing but recognizing it's something else and in acting upon what you recognize is something else is that right Saints so that's where we're standing tonight now notice brother brandham was charged to be sincere when he prayed and that nothing would stand before his prayer is that what the commission was then then the second pull came along and he was charged that if you'll be more sincere it'll come to pass that you'll know the secrets of men's hearts Hearts is that right and then the third pull as it come to pass he had to be more sincere still yet see all of these things hinged on his sincerity and if the prophet of God hinged upon being sincere then what about you're and I walk with the Lord tonight it hinges upon our ability to maintain sincerity and to grow our sincerity over time amen now keep in mind the vision of the serpent brother brand said he was coming down to the Jordan and he said on the other side of the Jordan he said there's where all the promises laid and he said he was lifted up and he was sitting on a highway and everybody was scared they were all afraid and he said a voice came and said there's such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you and he said he heard something in the weeds and he looked and it was a Mamba is that right and he said the voice said you have been given power to find him the worst or any that's what that's what the prophet said the voice told him that and he says well what must I do he said there's just one thing that you must do you must be more sincere all right so so when the vision came and he came out of that Vision he ran and he opened up his Bible before he had to carry the kids to school and he said his Bible on 1 Corinthians 5:8 and and you can pull that up the seventh and eth verse says this purge out therefore the old leaven now somebody some preacher preached on leevan this morning didn't they does anybody wake this morning all right can I get an amen tonight Pastor you still got that dollar maybe we could pay him a dollar to get an amen up here Purge out the old leaven that you may be on new lump it said as you are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen there's that word again sincerity and so in Paradox he says I took this Bible and just opened it up like that and my thumb was laying on 1 Corinthians the 5th chapter e8th verse when something uh reads something like this when you come I was planning on taking a fast to the Lord I told him I'd go out and fast and said when you come to this Feast which a fast in the body is a feast with the Lord he says we know that so when you come to this Feast don't come with the old leaven or the leaven of malice and so forth but come with the unliving bread of sincerity and Truth just exactly what he had told me in the vision come God is my solemn judge come with the unliving bread of sincerity and truth that is the word now I want you to notice the elements that's involved in this sincerity that brother Brandon was talking about it was he said I was in prayer and I was going into a fast and he said I let go of malice and come to the word that's that's some work on our part isn't it amen prayer and fasting and letting go and coming into coming out of and going into that's work brothers and sisters now it's important to note that we're not talking that like the people are not sincere today I'm sincere you're sincere but what we're saying is that there are there's more that we can attain amen it's not that we're not sincere now but we need to strive to become more sincere Amen brother brandom wasn't not sincere on the first pool but he had to become more sincere on the second pool he had to come more sincere on the third pool amen so it's not that we're just that we're just uh uh loose living right now but it's a it's a it's a it's a process that we want to go through to bring ourself into greater and greater sincerity for the Lord now the word sincere does not mean pompous or grumpy or arrogant or any of those things but the word sincere means free from pretense now the word pretense means an attempt to make something that's not the case appear true to make something that's not the case appear true it's it's like telling mostly the truth but spinning it just a little bit so that it looks better all right now we see that plenty in the world today and we see it plenty handled with the word today but Saints we don't want a pretense we want the pure word of God today now he says uh it means to uh or dece proceeding from genuine feelings we want to be sincere we want to have it uh uh proceed from genuine feelings it means heartfelt it means wholehearted it means deep from the heart of a person it means saying what they genuinely feel or believe not dishonest or hypocritical but free from dissimulation which means hypocrisy now the Bible also tells us to let our love be without dissimulation but to let our love be without hypocrisy to be a real feeling of love and real genuine not not I love you cuz I I'm supposed to say that because I'm a Christian but I really love you I really have a feeling of love for you amen now there was many that said they love brother brandom and didn't is that right and we don't want we want to genuinely and if you don't have genuine love you want to stay at the altar until you do have genuine love amen that's true amen so it's time to get sincere it's lamp trimming time Saints now the first seal we heard this morning uh brother Brown said Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah now you talk to him about it see wherein eight Souls were saved by water so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and if there was 800 that went in the Rapture tonight you would never hear a word about it tomorrow or the next day or no other time they'd be gone and you'd be knowing nothing about it it just be the same thing what am I trying to say I'm not trying to scare you worry you I want you to be on your toes he said be ready watching every minute quit your nonsense just get down to business with God because it's later than you think is that what the prophet said this morning now it's time Saints to be sincere it's time to trim our lamps it's time to be sincere when we pray it's time to be sincere when we come to church it's time to be sincere when we're praying for one another it's time to be sincere when we worship it's time to be sincere at our work and it's time to be sincere at our school and it's time to be us sincere when someone ministers the word and it's time to be sincere when we come to the table of the Lord and it's time to be sincere when we hear the message of the hour and it's time to be sincere when we play the tape and it's time to be sincere Saints amen amen it's lamp trimming time it's time to make sure that the oil is filled in the lamp but after you get the oil filled in a lamp you then have to trim the wick back and and you have to trim the wick back to make sure there's no smoke or smut that's that's fogging up the glass is that right amen so you can have the Holy Ghost and still have things in your life that we need to be corrected on we need to we need to move up a little higher with amen we there's still things about all of us that we can improve I I want to be a better man tomorrow than I am today I want to be better amen I don't want to remain the same I don't want to get stagnant I want to keep moving forward is that your prayer today amen it's time for some self examination amen now the Bible said if your heart condemns you let me just read it for you 1 John the 3 chapter 18th verse my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth sincerely love is that right Saints and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our hearts condemn us not God is greater than our heart uh if our heart if our heart condemns us rather God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God so condemnation is not a bad thing as long as we're acting upon that condemnation amen it means that the Lord's dealing with us it means that God's still working on us oh God it means there's still things about us that we can get better at it means that there's still things in our life that's not measuring up but but God is not done with usen amen and it's time to be sincere about trimming our lamps first seal paragraph 102 he said and when a sleeping virgin come they rubbed her eyes and and said suppose I ought to have some of that oil too so you'd better maybe you'd better have some and the real true bride standing there say we got just enough for ourselves see you see the difference in the sincerity the the the foolish Rose and said well I guess we better go get some of that oil but the the bride said I only got enough for me the bride was concerned about having oil in her lamp is that right and he said we just go through enough to get in ourself we can't get you nothing if you want some you go pray up oh yes and while she was gone the bridegroom come and in went the bride and then come to remit there the ones that were absolutely virtuous the church they were absolutely virtuous was left outside Di and he said there'll be weeping wailing and nashing of teeth see that's now that's the elected and that's the elect and when the the sound come the bridegroom cometh then every one of those that slept down Through the Ages awakened everyone amen so it's time to be sincere about having our lamps filled is that right Saints see it's time we're at the time of the call to go forward that the bridegroom is coming and we need some sincere men today in the message that'll lead their home I like that fire chief in Louisville you know the oil company was on fire the oil company was on fire amen and and and and here come Jeffersonville and the chief said well spurt a little water over here and spurt a little water over here is that right and and then here come Clarksville and the chief said spurt a little water over here and spurt a little water over here but Inc come Louisville brother brand said and he said they knew knew how to handle it and he said before that ladder got stopped good that Chief was on the end of it he said he threw that a through the window and said come on boys and he said the fire was out in just a few minutes because there was some men there that knew how to lead is that right amen and we need sincere men like that that'll cry out come on boys amen amen the bridegroom's coming amen amen I'm not messing around I'm I'm not playing church I'm going to lead my family I'm going to guide my children I'm going to be an example for my church I'm going to be an example at work amen I'm going to lead I'm going to guide I'm going to be sincere I'm not backing down from taking a stand I'm GNA be a rock for my family I'm going to be a man that's worthy of my wife's respect oh my I'm going to be a pillar in my church I'm going to believe without asking permission amen I'm going to be a leader we need some sincere women that'll lead their families we we need some sincere women that'll say behold the bridegroom's coming amen I'm not letting the world creep into my house I'm not letting my family lose focus I'm not going to preach I'm I'm going to preach to my congregation is that right they might not listen but I'm going to preach to them anyway is that right amen and we need some women like that we need some women to say I'm going to apply the token to my family I'm going to be a help to my husband I'm going to be a help to the church behold the bridegroom cometh amen I'm going to serve the Lord I'm this is my house and these are my kids this is my family and I'm going to stand up come on boys the bridegroom's coming amen we need some s sinere young people that'll stand up and say behold the bridegroom's coming amen I'm not of this world and I'm not polluting myself with the things of the world and I'm not polluting myself on social media and and I'm not polluting myself with the internet and I don't care what the other message kids are doing I'm here to serve the Lord I'm a child of the king I'm standing for something amen oh God I'm not bowing down to the popular opinion of the world I know that I'm a man is a man and a woman is a woman I know that I am what God made me amen I know I'm not a dog or a cat or a jellyfish amen right oh and I'm not comparing myself to anybody else I'm not comparing myself to what other churches do or what other believers do I'm I'm concentrating on God alone and I'm here to serve the Lord can you say Amen tonight we don't need a little spurt a little message over here and spurt a little message over there when if somebody says I want to believe all of it the way he said it we're going to believe it all just like he said it I don't have to explain it I just have to believe it amen what do he mean by that he meant what he said amen amen spur a little message over here that's right spur a little message over there I want all the message and I'll tell you Saints we need to turn the full board nozzle of the word of God loose on this devil today Saints you were put here to be a problem for the devil glory amen God give us a backbone like a s LW and plenty of knowledge in the Gable end of our soul and let us fight the devil as long as there's a tooth in our head and then come him to death until we die Saints I hope we're all 90 years old and and on our Walker and ging the devil to death amen yes amen you were put here to be a problem for the devil amen the Bride is a problem for the devil amen and I'm so thankful and I praise God for an open book and an Open Door in this age amen Philadelphia and church age he said what is the open door it's the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ what did he say to his church back there back in this age he said I am he that was which is and shall come I'm the first and the last I'm the almighty he said it three different times made himself de to his first church here before he went into the last Church age he said I sit before you and open door and he said if you want to see the Revelation here it is where he would build his church he said and the only way that he could take his church is back to the revelation of who of what he is see we're built today Saints on the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ is that right Saints it's the greatest of all Revelation and that's what we're built on today and that's what the message is built on today Jesus Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's the greatest of all Revelation it's the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ amen and I'll tell you we need to get sincere about this open door now remember in the last days this Lan Church shut their door in Jesus face and Jesus was on the outside knocking trying to get back in and brother Brown said it was one of the most pitiful sites in all the scripture Jesus on the outside of his church trying to get back in now the door handle was on the inside now they're not going to open that door to Jesus in this age so Jesus sent a message since they won't open the door to let him in he sent a message that cried come out if they won't let him in he will call out a bride is that right Saints so Jesus is now today calling come out of her come out of her right now that's what this Third Exodus Exodus is all about coming out of and going into when we come out of something we have to go into something else when you come out of denomination you can't just stay out you have to go into something else is that right and I'll tell you this whatever we can turn loose of tonight is more that we can go into with God whatever in our life that we can turn loose of is more that we can go into with Jesus Christ see is there any leaven that we can come out of so that we can go into Jesus is there any mortar in the joints Pastor that we can that we can get loose so that we have more room to fill up with Jesus Christ is is there is there any am I what am I holding on to that I need to let go of so that I can come out of it so that I can go into Jesus Christ are there any habits is there any technology is there any flesh that needs to be circum is there anything about the way that I'm dressing that's not pleasing to the Lord is there anything about what I'm looking at that's not pleasing to the Lord is there anything about what I'm listening to that's not pleasing to the Lord is there any ideas that I have that's not pleasing to the Lord is there any feelings I got that I'm holding on to that I need to let go of so that I can move on into the Lord what area my life can I tighten up on so that I can be pleasing to the Lord do y'all believe this tonight how many of you love the Lord tonight oh God I want to cut this short because we got the communion service still yet but I just leave you with this thought saints that it's it's our it's our ability and it's our purpose to become more sincere around this message and to become more sincere around our homes more sincere with our families more sincere in our prayer more sincere in our fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ it's a privilege that the bride has and and if we're coming out of something we're going into something greater amen God bless you let's just bow our heads maybe the musicians could come and just have a little word of prayer and before we pray just how many of you with our heads bowed and our hearts to the Lord and you just be honest with yourself and say brother George I I I'm one that needs to come out of some stuff I'm one that needs to turn loose to some things I'm one that that needs to consecrate my life tonight I I've got things in my life that I don't feel think about his love sister Sharon I've got things in my life that that I'm not sure the Lord's pleased with I I got things in my life that are holding me back I got feelings in my life that I need to let go of so I can move forward with the Lord I got I got circumstances in my life life that's holding me down I got relationships in my life that's holding me back I I I got habits in my life that I can't give up and I've I've tried to give them up but but there's just it's just so hard for me but I want to come out of those things so that I can go into Jesus Christ tonight how many of you'd say I just need a touch from him tonight and just lift your hand to the Lord I need to come out I need to come out so that I can go into I pray that God help me be more sincere May May the sincerity in my life may it be multiplied may I be more sincere with my family may I be more sincere in my church may I be more sincere in studying the word of God may I be more sincere about my habits if they're holding me back may I be may I cast them aside and and and and and and and cling to the cross of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus you see the hands tonight you know our hearts you know what we have need of and Lord it's our privilege to come to you and oh God that sincerity that we're looking for tonight that we're asking for tonight oh God I pray Lord that you would sink it down into our hearts father it's time to not play church but it's time to really get serious it's time to be sober and Vigilant and the and the call will go out soon behold the bridegroom cometh and Lord at that time it'll be too late but Lord those Lord that have oil in their lamps will be prepared oh God grant it that we got oil in our lamp Grant it Lord that we're sealed away into the kingdom of God

Ghost but there's still little things Lord we're trying to trim back the lamp we're trying to trim the wick Lord we're trying to make sure it's burning clean tonight Lord we're trying to make sure

accepted us amen hallelujah and our sacrifice is perfect therefore we are perfect tonight Lord Jesus bless your church we pray we commit it into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen I'm [Music] amazed that you love me I'm the how you [Music] away I'm amazed I'm amazed that you love me I'm a man how you care Through Your Precious Blood I found Parton pardon sins are washed oh washed away all my sins was washed away amen I thank the Lord for that word tonight how many thank God for that I believe that's the Holy Spirit reminding us once again to trim our lamps to be ready for his soon coming you know it's so nice that we have time to do that he does it while there is no emergency seemingly we have time to pray and really consider our life and take inventory of what we heard tonight to be more sincere that's a message to us all amen that's to the believer to the preacher to the Oldtimer to the newcomer to the young person to the old person more sincere and I do that on my knees Lord let me be more sincere with even my praise and my worship and my study and my preaching and whatever I would do let me be more sincere thank you brother George for that we certainly thank the Lord we'd like to go right into the word here for a moment in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 if we' like to ask you to stand to verse 23 we want to remember that youth meeting on Friday there that's coming up at Amazing Grace Temple um brother axis is one of the speakers and our own Levi he'll be um having a part of exhortation there in that meeting pray for that the theme of it is Rally around the spirit for a soldout life and this is Brother Caleb duron's church he had this burden and he wanted to highlight the young men that have that are sold out to the word and and we' like to encourage that amen amen 1 Corinthians 11: 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come yes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep brother banam says that's the premature death many die prematurely for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another Terry means to wait and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come you know wouldn't you rather be chastened than to be condemned yes and so he chastens us with his word and the sword of his word that we won't be condemned with the world so we're going to wait on the Lord just for a moment we'll pray as the scripture says let a man examine himself let a man trim his lamp let him trim it and see where those areas are in his life and in silent prayer you pray for me I'll pray for you pray for the one next to you in front of you and behind you that the Lord will help them and forgive them if they've done any sins done any wrong pray for them as brother bam taught us the Terry means to wait for one another and so we'll do that at silent prayer for a moment e heavenly father in my hands I hold the bread that was made for this service Lord as we partake of it may each one Lord seee um the benefits of being obedient to your word to show your death till you come as the prophet said it shows to the church that we believe every word when we partake of it now bless it now for this service in Jesus name we pray amen Heavenly Father hold the New Testament the cup of your blood Lord we know that there is healing in the cup the types and the Shadows show that even their clothes didn't wear out through Egypt 40 years Lord it brought them through that was the shadow but Lord You're the reality amen and now may the reality of what we're doing just strike every heart and if there be a sickness in the body may they receive their healing just in partaking of the cup tonight is my prayer Lord we thank you for it may you bless it now in Jesus name we pray amen bless you you may be seated follow the direction
