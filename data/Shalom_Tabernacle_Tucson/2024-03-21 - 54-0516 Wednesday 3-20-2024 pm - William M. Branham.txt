a fact that God and Christ are one no three persons no two persons but one person and his name is Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ we'd like to welcome you to the house of of the Lord tonight we're going to listen to a portion of this tape questions and answers on the law having the Shadow and this will kind of go into or introduce the second part of these uh messages I've been bringing on Wednesday night conduct order and Doctrine and we're going into the order part and as I Was preparing for that um there's several areas to get into um and this tape was one I believe we heard it before I'm sure we heard it before here um because in paragraph number 42 brother random makes a very very strong statement about birth control and I think it's the only place that he really says it this harsh and but it's the truth and so what we have done when I first heard this quote it was a year or so ago we were listening to it here and uh I know a lot of people in the message or in the ranks of the message they just you know on the issue of birth control brother random normally would um counsel with the individual and uh he made that very clear but on this tape he says this and he says it very clearly you'll hear it for yourself and this is what he says here it's in paragraph number 42 I believe I think I got it maybe I did maybe I didn't all right it's up there yeah a baby's born form first germ it's in the mother's wom it's a baby I'm firmly against birth control see yes sir for where it's just as much as harm to take a life of a little baby that ain't two months old as it is to pull a pistol and shoot a man down in Cold Blood murder yes sir I'm against birth contr control what God sends God will take care of and so that was in 1950 um whenever this tape is we're about to listening to 1958 1956 1954 all right and so um um and so this discussion came up and I'll go into it very quickly and then we'll go into the tape this discussion came up with some pastors I was with years ago from Africa that have taken this quote on birth control and they really firmly so you see these large large families and then when they start traveling to the US they found out that the Pastors in the US and many of our churches practice it very very openly and so how is it everybody's only have two kids and four kids and all like that and so these congregations one of the pastors told me that the brothers in these congregations went back to their pastors and so why didn't you bring the balance on this they were thinking he said now I have to raise all these kids and I kind of laughed at it but it's you know so the word of the Lord is is the truth that's the standard that we start with and what we have done many times we have made an exception we've made that the rule and so people just go right in and then they start practicing birth control and this is a you know this is a me this is a subject that's on the tape and here brother brand says it's wrong so I think you need to find that balance for yourself and find out what it really is and what your motive and objective is don't just do it because everybody else in the message churches are doing it amen now brother brandom said it's okay you don't have to say Amen it's still the truth in 1964 they asked the Prophet this question and look at how he answers it in 64 so in 54 when was this tape help me again4 in 54 this is 1964 10 years later and they asked brother brandom this question here oh Lord please help me just put it in here okay 1964 August 30th 1964 uh question number 420 it's a direct question direct quote and this kind of help give you the range of of the message brother bam says this here it's a question is it right according to the word to practice birth control I told you I'd answer that privately you that's got these questions come to me privately so you see the difference not that there's a difference but here on the tape he said he believes it's wrong he Compares it to murder he Compares it to shooting uh uh someone and so that's the reality of it and so I you know we say what the tapes say and we say everything that it says when they asked him 10 years later he answers it um privately so there's a you have to work those things out for yourself and as I said you know you start with what the rule is it's wrong and then from there there's exceptions and the reasons and your motives and your objectives okay amen all right don't try to take it off the tape he said it was wrong he compared it to murder and you're going to hear it tonight all right so let's go into um I don't think he gets into a scripture because we're going to stop this message a bit short before it gets into the scripture so just for the for the sake of a scripture reading let's turn in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and like I said um we have taken the conduct Behavior poster Duty forsake not the Assembly of yourself giving your best how we dress fasting and praying we brought all that on conduct on the last few Wednesday services and we're going to start into order the order of things and brother Adam gets into a lot of that here uh in this tape tonight questions and answer law having a shadow the scripture reads in 1 Corinthians 14 verse number 37 if a man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues let all things be done decently and in order amen so that's what we want tonight let's prepare our hearts to go to this portion of the tape and we'll sing only believe amen i' like to greet each of you see brother Andy in the back God bless you the bonds of each of you God bless you richly amen singing only [Music] believe only believe that all things are possible only [Music] believe only [Music] believe only believe all things are Poss only God bless you you may be seated brother brandham do and that way the Holy Spirit keeps us all broke up you know the prophet one time went down to The Potter's House see to be broke up to be melted over see you have if there's something wrong God don't just put a patch in anything he said you put a new piece and a in an old garment it'll make it worse than that that just a thing to do is it's if if put the whole thing so if you've done something wrong don't just get around a little say well I'm sorry I did it I won't try not do it again just break up and get molded over again make that piece another piece now last evening now in this week now probably tonight will be gospel teaching again and I uh I do the very best that I know how see and now in coming in many times you all think I just come in maybe this morning maybe they might be a stranger or two but most of them I perhaps suggest the regular little Tabernacle group here and sometimes teing into the go ble like that it isn't to make you angry with me or to it's what it is yes it's to tear you up certainly that's what it does the word of God sharper than a 28 Sword and the thing of it is in there there'll be this one come in with something that one come in with something this one there and all good people but they'll have different ideas and each one want to present their idea to the church see you can't do it the church has got a solid gopel doctrine that has to be based on the word of God if you got a difference why either take it to the pastor and let him see what he thinks about it and so forth and let it be submitted don't take some Theory now it has to be brought out in the word a lot of times the pastor build all those things up then when I come in he's dir very humble brother Neville he know he did he's just a little bit too humble he don't speak when he ought to speak that's that's that's right and I I I think I here not long ago we had a little talk together I said what's the matter brother nille is this you you you a loving sort of a brother and you don't want to hurt no one you you think I'm standing in the Tabernacle there well after all it's brother Bill's Tabernacle it's God's Tabernacle he's a Shepherd put in full charge that's right it's his place to do these things I said B said I'm you don't want to hurt one's feelings look if you side in with somebody siding this way and other siding this way you got to stand the mutual grounds and draw it together here and say this is it see that's it see you must do that and the people really I found this around the world if you'll be absolutely straight and sincere the people appreciate you more amen just lay it right down Jesus name he loved the people he even gave his life there for those Pharisees that were crucifying him and he prayed for their forgiveness but yet he said you generation of viers Snakes in the Grass and so forth like that he wasn't exactly talking to the being the human being it was a spirit I look at Peter coming behind him said oh Lord you can't do you turn around and said get thee behind me Satan are always an offense to me he wasn't speaking to the Apostle it was he was a fountain of Truth and it was the spirit that was on that apostle that was making him say that to J see and he wasn't speaking to Peter he loved him see he loved him and know he is to be the head of the Church of Jerusalem but he he was wasn't going to speak back to Peter he was speaking to the spirit that was causing Peter to hinder The Works of God Amen you get it that's the same thing here it isn't to hurt your church hurt your feelings well you well you're my beloved brothers and sisters why my if there's any Crown if there's a star in my crown if I've W someone to Christ the Jew well I ain't going to break my star I'm sure but if if there any something gets on my started on to be on there I'm going to break that if I can I'm going to do that cuz I want it to shine and if I can get the church All In Harmony in one Accord then the whole thing a shine it see see what I mean and that's what we have to do last night and answering the question I did the best that I knew how the person that wanted that vicarious ailly Dilli it they never gave me any uh point on it last night that I should had answer it this morning or give you the Roman numerals written out but if you're here this morning and so desired all right You' be glad and um last evening after the service was over there was a a man came to the platform which was the Christian Scientist man been standing the meeting and what a great compliment he passed and he said he had never heard that type of teaching never heard the Bible so well explained and just go show walk out of the church and someone standing out there said said that guy sure is an impostor well of course that's someone that backslid from the Tabernacle here and went away with that group not long ago three or four of them pulled away and let this church hear this pastor and all regardless if those people who left this church they went out from us because it wasn't of us said the Bible amen right and we went to them with brotherly Godly love one after another trying to reconcile them to the church they wouldn't listen we take in groups and went with them they wouldn't listen then we told it to the church and the Bible said let them be as a heathen and a Publican that's right they cannot come back into the church without first coming before the church and repenting before the church and then repenting before God and then be brought back and see how they act actually that that's right they cannot come back all the Bible That's Bible teaching we must stay with this B see if the brother has off go to him and if he won't hear you take someone with him with you if you won't hear that tell it to the church then let them be as a heathen and a Publican and said whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven what you lose on Earth I'll lose in heaven see so we must keep listen hard teaching sometimes but it'll keep your church Church level up it'll keep it what God Said like I sometimes if anything I hate do correct my children when or give them a whing amen but I I just hate to do that but yet the Bible said do it and you watch these little people today that don't whip their children and correct them find out what they got got a little smart stomp their foot and slaming arme against the wall and ball you out app parent that's said see the Bible's right in everything isn't that right amen the Bible is right and everything so this has been a time of teaching um someone who wouldn't come in last night stood on the outside said I wouldn't answer all the questions that I went back in the room and started them out and found the ones I wanted to answer and brought that KN and answered them look if you put in a question I didn't answer you bring it to me I got two this morning that I gave you remember last night somebody brought them up late and I had to give him to brother Neville and I got him this morning the answer I try to answer everyone to the best of my knowledge what is thus sayith the Lord now you may miserably disagree with me on things but just the same the love of God will remain just the same towards you and I because we're children together and before we start the morning's uh Sabbath teachings which we hope not to take too long whatever the Lord will and then I want to answer this now remember Church you every one of you knows what this church stands for you absolutely understand now we don't have any membership we just have Fellowship see because if we have membership then we bring the people like to an organization which we are strictly inter denominational unorganized only one thing to lead us that's the Holy Spirit and we believe that the Holy Spirit leads through our leader if God set a a Holy Spirit set a teacher in the church then if the Holy Spirit wants the church to know something he'll speak through the teacher amen for the Holy Spirit that's what the teacher is ordained to do is that right it's ordained that gift is in the church as a teacher and we should all listen to it until that gift goes to proving something that isn't right in the Bible then we have a right to question it see as long as it's not the go saying well there's no such a thing thing is water baptism is no such a thing as this that the other are the baptism of Holy Spirit then question that see amen but now the Holy Spirit leads now the church believes in the baptism of water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins after repentance it believes in the baptism of the holy spirit with the fruits of the spirit following the fruits of the spirit longsuffering gentleness patience goodness meekness we believe in nine spiritual gifts all nine of them wisdom knowledge teachers Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues Divine Healing those things we believe we believe in church government and the government is ordered of the holy spirit in the Bible the pastor is always the head of the Church yes the pastor is always that's God's Elder in organizations you have to come to the bishop now the Bible there's no higher order in the Bible than the Elder of the church that's right just tell me where it's that there's no higher order in the Bible for the church than the Elder which is the pastor he's the highest order of the Bible and then if U the the Elder if don't receive any acquisation against your Elder unless it first be by two or three Witnesses no matter what anybody says about an elder don't you believe it until you have two or three Witnesses and let them Witnesses be tried first and then if that Elder has done something wrong and these three Holy Ghost Witnesses have been tried and proved that they've really done something to the Elder then go to the Elder and that sin openly rebuked see that others might see and take heed now in orders of the church and now we just trust that God will keep you perfect and your hearts stayed upon him and remember friend this glorious church that we've been talking about and this last week why can't we have that here on eth and 10th Street amen we've got the qualification we've got the people who love God don't you believe that we got we got people in here I see strangers in here coming in since brother Neville has been Pastor here a fine people I meet him here at the altar people from Louisville people from Henryville new albony and around people I don't even though I've never seen them in my life wonderful people now would you all like to have a real Bible Church a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were setting order everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be would that be wonderful now you're going to have to sacrifice not money you're going to have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas you're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer you're going to have to sacrifice your maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility see you're going to have the whole Christian move is sacrificial he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me daily is that right how often you have to sacrifice every day Paul said he died daily every day died now I believe with God's help our brother Neville and I just went through a great Siege of going through different things and rubbing over different things and trying to find out and I say this not brother Neville don't even know I'm saying knows nothing about it he's just sitting there that's all I question him in the doctrine of this Tabernacle see if it was right and he's right he teaches the doctrine now what I find in the church is leading up to an answer here in one of these questions that I give which is the only one that I know these all in here I think if I'm not mistaken yeah these are the same some of the same ones was here last night look them over brother NE see if they are if you will and get them back to me see y' and um that's what I come in for at these times is to look around in congregation is more or less the as Paul told to one of the elders down there keep these things when I come down we accept the church in order first thing I got with brother Neville see what he believed see if there's any contrary and our our faith our our way or explain the Bible there wasn't one eror we went right straight through the same thing then if the Elder and I and he's teaching it right then we got to find out where the where the trouble's at see we get this thing straighten out now one thing I find out in the church while is no not maybe uh three or four strangers with this just a little Tabernacle is one thing it's a lack of love for one another Among Us uh I I don't you know me well enough to know that when I know something's wrong I I'm going to come to you that's right because I'm Duty bound to God and it might have to hurt you but I'm going to tell you the truth see I'm going to tell you the truth so we can both get straighten out with God and go to the Bible said agree with th advies quickly don't let the Wrath son set on your wrath see now in order to be a a correct Pastor or Minister you've got to watch your congregation if you see the enemy coming in and slip that over here and say here just a minute see now that's wrong thing then you're watching the Bible said take heed to the flock to feed the flock which the Holy Ghost has made you overseer over now if you fail to do that God's going to make the answer for it that's right so that's what we want to do is that old the ones I had last night all right now I tried to answer each one but these these two here I'll get that this before we go into Sunday school so uh everyone of be answer I see do you believe that God gives the Holy Spirit to everyone that is truly born again Christian at the time they accept salvation or do you believe that uh this is a different work of Grace that in the experience of most Christians come later please um CL CL ify this subject as many are confused because of the differ teaching on this subject uh if I don't answer this correctly well then you ask me I I I I and put it on my Des for tonight and then I I'll get a hold of it now Christian friends a person cannot be borned again until they have received the Holy Spirit amen see you can you are not even converted until you receive the Holy Ghost I'm not say you're lost before you receive the Holy Ghost because you're not there is three there is one work of Grace only one work of Grace that's the Holy Spirit and it's made in three manifestations just like the one God made in three manifestation father son Holy Spirit one God amen only one now there's three works of Grace but three manifestations there's a manifestation of justification by faith a man believes God the yester I believe that I believe there's a true God and now and for my personal savior I accept Jesus Christ his son as my personal savior now that's what's called justification by faith which the disciples received first now the next thing is this man would go out and today he might Smoke Drink curse do things that his habits is hanging into him it's just rooted in there it's Spirits habits are spirits the Bible said there are unclean spirits in man now he want that maybe he's lustful excuse this we're a mixed audience but we're we're standing in the Judgment House of God and we must say these things clear for instance man sometimes especially man become lustful sex Maniacs not only that but just lustful way women dressed and things today no wonder they are but and but women becomes the same way lustful Spirits get on them and the nice little ladies and they put on Sharp clothes and little bitty things around them which looks terrible and they get out why they don't want to be bad but they don't realize that that Old passioned Demon spirit is working on them they don't do that to appear before God they do it not to be cool because pure science proves you that you take your clothes off the hot air on your body is more hotter to you than what it is when you got clothes on the Indian girl in in Arizona beautiful lot more than what you see one of these nudes and she don't only put on her clothes but a big blanket around her when she walks across the desert to keep cool and piration when the heat comes up that's it's the air conditioning see see so it's nothing in the world but a lust passion Spirit maybe you're lady enough not to do anything wrong to live untrue to your husband or to your own Mor but my sister that's disgraceful and you don't realize if you could look in God's looking Place year and find out what God said about that it's an evil spirit that's on you and you don't realize it Mary magdalina didn't realize the spirit that was on her see well now when you get that kind of spirit on you or man you get out here and start lusting for women it's a you say well it's human nature not like that no it's the spirit the Bible said it was the spirit that's right so the thing to do then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from lust and passion amen called sanctification the word sanctification means to be cleaned and set aside for service you get one now that's lust Spirit leaves you under sanctification let a little lady nice goes to church she sings in a choir but she has to more grass with a little pair of sharks on let her get Sanctified one time and let her put on a pair let that man that'll almost have a wreck looking at that woman in the yard and let he get Sanctified one time and go down the street amen just keep his mind on what he's doing amen exactly right if he gazes sideways he'll turn his head this way the the holy spirit says turn your head amen amen there you are Hallelujah that's right that's sanctification hallu now in this person it's been called by God is manifestations of gifts now a very dear friend of mine in Denver the other day was discussing this with me we used to be here and preach in this city very fine man as far as I know but see he was a Nazarene and and he felt the sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which it is not there's no scripture to show that I Pro that a little bit in the Bible that it isn't you're not sealed by sanctification you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit a sealing is the completing of the work that's the reason it couldn't be sealed under Luther Wesley either one it had to come to the baptism before the church was sealed away till the day of redemption you see now but AR they're not lost they're saved certainly they are now sanctification is the same work of Grace or are the same Grace that saves you Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws me amen so it's the holy spirit all along but that's a portion of the holy spirit this is a greater portion of the Holy Spirit and now when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is a completion of the Holy Spirit taking it's AB bold in you to manifest gifts speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts of power wisdom knowledge understanding man said last night said where did you get your education for these things well said I've come out of great seminaries and we've never had such as that ever taught in a seminary that I ever heard I said it don't come from Seminary I said I'm poor with a seventh grade education 10 15 years ago I couldn't hardly write my own name and I cannot do much better today but it comes through inspiration amen I said then watch it why he said you never watch what you're going in the Bible you just grab the thing and run on through the Bible it says it just all comes back together I said after I get out of the pull pit I couldn't tell you what I said not me I don't know see it's him putting it together I don't know hallu I can't tell you I just get up here and something strikes me and I just know the scriptures like that you might ask me the scripture hour later I wouldn't know see but it just comes like that and you watch and see if it's right or wrong when I get in the full I don't know what people are doing when they come to the prayer line what they've done in their life but watch it strike and tell them this is exactly what they've done in their life and what they ought to do to get saved is that right what they are to do to be healed and whether they're going to live or die how do I know that then ask me 10 minutes after out the platform I couldn't tell you what it said I don't know it's all that I haven't got anything to do with it I just yield myself to the Holy Spirit and he does the talking that is the whole thing amen that's right so it isn't I it's not me if you judge that I have the Holy Spirit then it's the Holy Spirit and if you judge that it isn't the Holy Spirit then you might think it was the devil but the thing of it is compare it with this and see what it Compares with the Holy Spirit wrote this so if it Compares with that and brings that out truth then it must be of God then isn't that right amen now no the Christian brother now look it's just in this manner I'll try not to take too much of our time on this look a new birth Jesus told Peter after he would been the apostles all of them they had been justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ they've been Sanctified through the truth he was the truth and then he said and given power they went forth to preach the gospel the the UNG great gifts that was in him was being made temporarily or you know shallow away manifested but he said now the next thing you got to do is make this thing grow now he said Peter said Lord I'm willing to go to death and everything with you he said Peter after you are converted strengthen your brother after you're converted well Lord I've been baptized by you Jesus Christ baptized Peter he baptized uh the apostles all right now he said now I've been baptized that I've done all these things and I've walked by you I I I've been saved and you give me power you wouldn't expect God to put that power in an unclean vessel so he had to clean him up and give him a life of of sincerity anyhow before he he let him go out and preach the gospel and they return back rejoice and said but even the devils are subject to it see and why then he said now Peter I know all this but you're not converted yet see you're not right yet Peter you're not converted but after thou are converted then strengthen your brother Peter hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet see when the Holy Ghost come then Peter was an inspired teacher Jesus recognized it in last night's question you remember what he said come down and said Upon This Rock I'll build my church amen not upon Peter not upon the pope or upon that place or in that no not upon himself Jesus never put upon he been the Chief Cornerstone no he said Thou Art Peter and flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven and up on this Rock Amen spiritual revealed Tru I'll be on my church that is not upon what the Seminary teaches not what the church teaches but what the spirit inspired teaching that comes into this Bible and Manifest this Bible to be true upon that I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it see what I mean now now a person can be look a mother's look this way now the little young ladies most of are out in the room out there and the young man we're all married folks I want to ask you something what is everything in the natural types the spiritual everything Mo mes made the pattern of the Tabernacle like he saw in heaven is that right amen everything in the natural tipes the spiritual now when a the St John the SEC uh I mean 1 John 5 and 7 it said there a tree that bear record in heaven the Father the word which was the Son and the Holy Ghost these three are one is that right so there's three that bear record in earth water blood spirit they are not one but they agree in one see now you can be justified without being Sanctified you believe that now you holding his people will agree with that all along see all right then when I tell you you can be Sanctified without receiving the Holy Ghost you Pentecostal people are shout over that see because that's true you can it's just another step into the same Grace now you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without receiving the Holy Spirit I've brought that this week Through the Bible ages and everything and I could spend two years right here on the same thing and never leave the subject it's in the Bible we just merely touched the little points and things around here and there not even dug down in and got all the scriptures the Old Testament the prophets and everything and brought them right out the picture hour after hour in these cave up here Greens Mill and things has God reveal that him now look a friend now but you cannot have a father father without having the son you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost see they are inseparable but water blood and spirit is separated although it's by the same Grace that they come now look when Jesus died at Calvary he produced exactly what it constitut to get into the body of Christ come out of the body of Christ amen when Jesus died what come out of his body now listen closely what come from his body first was water amen blood and spirit amen now when a baby is born in the Earth Mother Dad what's the first natural thing in a natural birth break water that right first laor pain the words are cutting the Sinners sitting there M does he mean that I have to quit doing well I have to get old pain and labor it takes death to bring forth life amen death life can only come through death so you say well yes that's right here you go all right I Repent of my sins I want to be baptized show to this congregation I believe in the death baral and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ Waters come forth what's the second thing in the natural birth blood is that right breaking of blood then the blood cleanses and takes all the unclean habits away from you sanctifies you get you fixed up all right that cleanses them all sin now you're set aside for Serv now what's the next thing to come out of the body of Christ spirit amen when the water comes the blood comes in a little posterior protoplasma stimulations added to the baby like that a little gospel spanking and he cries out God spirit is that right that's what the church needs sometime is just a little bit of gospel spanking like that down listen and then he say oh he CES as our father the spirit comes Bor out to him man he's born again of the spirit of God he's a Christian when he's begotten a baby's a baby when it's formed the very first germ in the mother's woms it's a baby I'm firmly against birth control see yes for just as much harm to to take the life of a little baby if it ain't two months old as it is to pull a pistol and shoot a man down in Cold Blood murder yes sir I'm against birth control what God sends God will take care of notice now that is wrong to do that now that's the baby right there it's a life for the first germ of life is in it which it'll only be the only life it'll in it let other Spirits in it then the baby becomes begotten it little muscles quiver and jump and twist like that then that's the next thing then the water blood then it has to get when it breaks its little lungs through just as the natural baby is born there a spiritual body at the side of the mother to give the baby a spiritual life and then when we're growing old here and we've been born again of the spirit year begotten in the wounds of the earth here when we lead this Earth this robe of Flesh I'll drop and rise and seize the Everlasting priz and Shout while passing through the air as long as in this earth here there's a born again Christian a spirit in here groaning and waiting if this Earthly Tabernacles is God we have one all that way when this when this natural was conceived and being brought forth when it was born it was a spiritual body to receive it and now as this natural body is dilling away there's a spiritual body to receive it when it goes away when it's begotten of the we are begotten of the father through the word by the washing of the water of the word and made new creatures in Christ Jesus so it's all one work of GRA but now look in the age Luther Wesley and all down to the Pentecostal age as I said I'm am not Pentecostal I believe in Pentecostal Doctrine many things is some things that I disagree in as I told you last night some things I I disagree prly in the initial evidence of what they call you have to speak with tongues to prove that you've got the holy ghost that can not be scripturally proven that is just let your pastor come to me see that's right and I even from the highest the do Pope and all those others we've come together even the head of the Assemblies of God one of the greatest and speaking in tongu for evidence and Dr Pope reached across the table him and eared and them and took hold my hand said brother Brandon that is the truth but what are we going to do about it now if we fail to do that then the people go off just like Pilgrim Holiness and so forth I said no they want you just lay it out like the Bible says they let God add to the church let God give to the church see those gifts are in the church right in here this morning there's Gifts of speaking in tongues there's Gifts of Prophecy there's Gifts of everything setting in your but if you just not go to hanging at that gift if you do you're going to get the gift without the giver see the thing of it is seek after God seek after the love of God in your heart and that is God wants you he'll move you into whatever he wants you to do see that's it that's how the church is putting order now now in that and this here remember that when you are justified by faith I hope that explains the SC now you are a Christian right then when you accept Jesus as your personal savior you are a Christian at that time that's right I believe if you would die right then when you accept Jesus as savior I believe you'd be saved that's what the dying priest did on the cross and that's what others that's what the scripture says Jus say he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life see I believe you are a Christian name now I I can't judge where you are not God knows whether you are not see that's your heart I was I wasn't sent or no other man to judge we were only sent to preach see now you're a Christian when you accept Jesus and when the blood of Jesus Christ is applied to you your sins are your habits and fth of this world that you wed in is gone from you smoking drinking gambling all these uh unclean habits Leave You by sanctification and then the Holy Spirit comes in and anoints you and put you in service to do something for him now that is them now in the next then the next thing is to do is uh then you're born again when you receive the Holy Ghost that's when you're converted you might be in process of conversion but you're not converted until it's completed and you're sealed into the kingdom of God Amen heal down just like if I start loading a box car out here well I throw some tans in I throw some clouds in I throw some more things in I say is it ready the inspector come by NOP not yet but the Box Car sitting right there on its road to its Des Nation but as soon as I get the whole thing loaded up sealed in packed in right then the doors are Slam by the inspector and is sealed there you are and she's ready she's sealed and gone that's right Jesus said blessed are ye when you hunger and thirst after righteousness for you shall be filled amen now there's another question last night you spoke of your belief in the gift of the spirit you mentioned that you yourself had spoken in tongues do you believe that the program including sermons should yield to the spirit when it is trying to bring forth a message in tongues now I answered that to an extent last night now I will finish it this morning now speaking in tongues is a gift of God but it's subject to what's on the floor is the first place now there Christian there's where you make your mistake now I don't know someone told me that Monday night or Tuesday night when I was preaching if somebody spoke in tongues while I was preaching it's a good thing I didn't hear it or I'd have stopped and called you out right there CU you was out of AR the Holy Spirit if I'm anointed of God speaking by the Holy Spirit he's speaking here he don't speak over here and over here and over here a confusion the Bible says that Christian see so that's right we must get those things down in our heart everything has to come in a season speaking in tongues is give away to a place for speaking in tongu see and then if if someone speaks in tongues now I ain't saying the person was wrong I don't say the person was demon possessed I believe the person was sincere I believe the person if they could speak with tongues they're blessed of God but the person it's just like brother neille standing here trying to sing a song maybe he's gifted to sing a song and he's here singing a song me saying you're trying to preach right in your face in him singing a song well that's not order if the holy spirit's in the singing Let the singing go on see if uh then if I Sor start preaching and he raises up and and starts to sing a song while I'm preaching that's out of harder the holy spirit is not an author of confusion that's right so get that church you're a lovely people see but you're all in eror now if you've got a gift use a gift where the gift belongs if I got a pick and shovel I certainly wouldn't try to hold my tomatoes with it no see I use the pick and shovel when I'm picking or digging a ditch I wouldn't try to drive my automobile through the corn field see I use the automobile to travel back and forth and I use my plow in the corn Fel so I ain't got nothing against the plow I haven't got nothing against the automobile they both are instruments to the Ure for EMB betterment of mankind I haven't got nothing in speaking in tongues I haven't got nothing against preaching against singing against interpretation tongues against Gifts of healing but it's all to be used in his place oh please church have faith just a little while see you must come under teachings you see I don't need no one to teach me if the Holy Ghost has come my friends that that gives me just a little room to doubt whether you've really got it or not see see the way you're acting with it see see the same you're doing now why if there is no if the Bible said the a holy spirit is the teacher why did the Holy Spirit put teachers in the church stand to set the church in office the same Holy Spirit sure we don't need any seminaries to go around a big bunch of man to look out these things the holy spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher and it gives us some fell a gift of teaching then you must be subject to that gift if here some man to when we're going here and he's got a gift of healing Faith and Healing and I'm sick I walk up to him and say brother what must I do he stands there he's a prophet and he stands there with a gift he said thus sayith the Lord William Brandon you know you done a certain thing day before yesterday in a certain place and that's the reason you're sick today because you did something I'm subject to that gift I ain't going to say oh you're wrong I don't care what you say I know who I am not I'll die in that condition see I've done something wrong now the things me do when I see that I'm wrong I say yes my dear brother the holy spirit's upon me and that's the truth I did wrong you pray for me and I'm going to ask God to forgive me so that I can be right with God now you're getting back on the heing life then I say yes I'll go back and make that right if I cheated this brother if I talk wrong to that brother or sister there I'm going over to make it right you're the Holy Spirit going to reveal it to me then I go over and make that right say I'm sorry brother I was in the wrong watch me get well that's right but if I puff myself up and say oh I know as much about it uhuh you must listen to the Holy Spirit see he's the teacher and the guide of the church see now the holy spirit that now the Bible says that if uh in that that the spirit of the Prophet the one now a man who speaks with tongues is prophesying you know that certainly now if a man speaks with tongues and the prophet is preaching from the platform then that spirit is subject to this Spirit if brother nille was standing here preaching and he's under the inspiration of God and he's making an over call or whatever he's doing as long as he's in this pull pit and his voice isn't moving he's under the inspiration of God or should be and then if he does then when he gets finished and he's sat down then if the spirit falls into the meeting you say well brother brand it fell on me in the beginning I know that is true it isn't the spirit falling on you brother the spirit or sister whoever you are the spirit is subject to the word of God because Paul said if an angel come and taught anything different let it be at purse this every holy spirit will recognize this word of God to be true is that right but now some people sometimes people have gifts and the gift will speak for oh my it's a it's a gift of God and it wants to go forth and do something it's Inus but it's got to come under subject of the Holy Spirit see it's a gift therefore don't you see where you see tongues is not the only evidence tongues as a gift see the Holy Spirit has to operate that now Paul said if a man speaks with tongues in the church and there be no interpreter let him hold his peace no matter how much he wants to speak how much is crying out in the feet that's the gift see what I mean that's the gift here I I sit many times with the gift that the Holy Spirit has given me to pray for the sick I see a time you said oh there's some poor little fell I must pray for him my heart just yield for him and the Holy Spirit said leave him Al and go over here to this one I come in a meeting I sit there and there's a poor old mother laying there with all crippled up Ling there shaking like a oh God that poor L she looks up and say brother brandom please have mercy on me oh how my heart beats for that poor little thing M and your that's a lady over here maybe was female trouble the angel will never touch that woman land there go here this lady the female trouble and say th sayith the Lord your healed amen now me my gift I want to get to that woman there but the Holy Spirit just go over here see what I mean Philip was down there a Revival just having a wonderful time thousands being converted and everything but the Holy Spirit comes to go out the gates into the desert he's going to be a color man pass through after a while am give him the message and he never returns you see what I mean yes Jesus passed through you he was God and he passed through this F of the all these cripples and blinds and lames and Halt and wer was laying there how his poor heart must have burned for that poor mother with a Waterhead baby that poor old Dy stand there blind saying somebody help me and here come the very God of creation moving by and flesh coming by him walked right on by him watch what he did walked over to a man that maybe had ptic trouble or something he had 38 years he could get up and walk and go where he wanted to he said when I'm coming to the pool another can rout run me and get down there see when I'm coming to the pool Jesus said will thou be made whole said take up that bed and go into the house heal that one man which could walk around and was in pretty good of Health he got around for 38 years with it but he was laying that prent maybe one time he could jump into the pool and he had all this disease and I had it for 38 years and there was people dying laying there sure Jesus wanted to go to them but the Holy Spirit led him there for the Bible said that he knew the man was a there next amen see no matter what the what the gift says it's got to yield to the spirit that's why Paul said that the gifts out in there and our congregation will yield to the prophet see you got to yield to the order that's it it's the gift I hope that explains it there's where the Pentecostal Church gets tied up many times many of in order that's what cause trouble in the brand Tabernacle see it's because you people with your gift don't know how to use that and that's the reason you need Bible teaching to know how to use that gift to get the best out of it for the kingdom of God's say speaking in tongues I wish every one of you spoke with tongues I wish the interpretation of tongues was every one of you but you couldn't do it the same time you've got to yield to the order of the spirit when the spirit is Anointed a brother here preaching he say you're preaching the gospel like that then let your gift yield to that spirit because just like I said last night you know uh now a lot of people did not speaking in Tong they said the devil and you good nazarine people your own church status word back flip exactly when the light of speaking in tongues and the gifts of the Spirit come you deny in a person in a nazarine church you know how they feel if you speak in tongues you're a devil I know a woman today that was just revealed to me last night a little woman in New Or that's real real bad and sense an morning been striking me she come to my house and the Holy Spirit told her exactly what was wrong told her all about some horrible sinful things she did and pronounced her healing and the woman went away and got with a bunch of methodists and Nazarene preachers that believes that anybody speaks with tongu is got is a devil and the woman bleeds that and she's blaspheming and she'll never get over until she comes and receives the Holy Ghost you can't mistreat God be careful what you're doing if one word against that will seal you out of the kingdom of God forever now if you believe me to be his servant if you think God is with me and helping me and in my words in according to the Bible then you correct me but if they are according to the Bible and you believe me to be his servant you better take heed and listen that's true so then here my hands is used for a certain purpose but I've got to go to that bu that place there to use them there's no need of my hands fighting at that now when my Feet's trying to take me over there just like a man preaching he's pre preaching or now it's time for speaking in tongues and this this hand or speaking in tongues wants to get to it see but don't claw the air wait till my feet gets me over there then I can reach over to there see now when a man speaking or preaching up here at the platform or a message going forth if the man is of god he's anointed of the spirit to preach the word and that's the Holy Spirit the holy spirit's moving that that's just your gift there trying to get you started but the holy spirit's coming through the word and the Holy Spirit will always the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God right and It'll recognize the word and be rever and then when a time comes when the holy spirit's left the platform off the minister comes out in there then you're in order then somebody give up maybe has has a messages speaking in tongu then he gives interpretation to it then watch it it won't be quoting scripture it won't be saying something God don't use repetition see It'll stand up and say thus sayith the Lord Mr brother S and S is laying here sick what done it was day before yesterday sometime he done a certain thing got out of the will of God on that thus sayith the Lord now that'll interpretate that's for the the Holy Spirit only speaks to edify the church if you speak with tongues with no correctly interpretation don't do it in the church do it at home that's what the Bible say then and if if that's true then the spirit of God's up you maybe you'll speak and say all you move from this section of this city tomorrow there's coming a sideone that'll sweep all this section out now before that can be remember speaking and sound is not too accurate Paul said Let It Be first judged by two or three witnesses that two or three was divine judgment judges what with the Holy Spirit Level sound and Doctrine I believe God was in that the next raised up said God was in that got to had one more one more raised up said God was in that then let what part of the church is in this section flee as hard as he can get out of there if tomorrow the storm comes through and blows it up no God is with you but if it doesn't do it you better be careful you got the wrong Spirit among you you better get back up the Altar and get this thing prayed out all the church together and that poor person spok in Tong ought to come around the Altar and say Lord somebody help me I don't want to be Anointed with that that's wrong see so Lord help me get the thing off of me let me get right with you see what I mean so be careful church do you understand if you do say amen amen if you do now that's true Bible teaching amen now it won't now you hear a lot of times come up and say oh the Lord is coming soon Jesus is coming and uh and the people must be ready or something like that sure the Lord's wrote that in the Bible if it come it'll come right through the prophet coming out through right that but it's for the edifying of the church see the edifying of a church it's a direct message everybody's heard that message but if say this man here if yesterday he was untr to his marriage vow and the Holy Spirit comes and condemns him this morning that's something the church don't know that's right see it condemns that man he stands and says that's the truth God forgive me then God's with you see what I mean then you won't all be confused you've got those gifts now here's the last quotation of it listen friend listen all the this you had those gifts you didn't deserve them God given them to you before the foundation of the world still yours when you was born in this world you was born with him felt that gift which is within you see you're born with those things you can't make yourself do something I couldn't make my eyes brown because they're blue amen who taking thought can add one toic to his statue it's all in God's Divine program if I tried to be a s any what good would it do me can amen God had a sany inin I'm William Brandon you're whoever you are now look if you will take those gifts that you have and use them correctly and orderly in the church this little church will grow like everything but when you get in yourself in the flesh you'll keep it tore up as long as the church stands here exactly right now have I made it clear I hope so if I haven't and if there's one question that hasn't been answered you let know and I'll be glad to do it well that's a long time and you know I've got I got a long time I hope to stay here in this world and I know one thing we got a long time to be gone amen so let's let's try to keep the thing correctly Brotherly Love continue let it keep in the church like that now do you think we are to dismiss church now should we just have this a little bit of Bible teaching how many think we already going into Bible teaching and I for just a half hour brother you watch your watch and give me a half hour you go shall we bow our head heavenly father I promised last evening to finish these questions this morning I've did the best that I know how if I have ered in any way knowing that you love your children you love them and if you're in my heart it'll make me love them amen then father knowing that sometimes fathers correct their children they must and I pray God if I have made the wrong correction then you forgive me I'm only going by the way your word said to the best of my knowledge and by the witness of the holy spirit that lives in my heart thank to me it's perfect and I pray God that it would become perfect to this church that this church may become perfected in the love of Christ amen that this will be a place that people will come from around the world to come in here and see the Glorious operation and H of the spirit where gifts and manifestations that when Sinners walk in the building the holy spirit will be so dominating in here till they'll weep and walk up the Altar and give their lives to thee granted Lord make us that way not to be selfish not only us Lord make every Church on the face of the Earth like that that the world may know that Jesus Christ has raised from the dead and living today among his people heal the sickness May every church accept healing May every Church be filled with the Holy Ghost every Church speaking in tongu interpreting tongu every Church having Divine Healing and prophecy and all the manifestations of the spirit oh Christ th great Holy One knowing that that would be my desire in my heart but knowing that your word says it will not be therefore we cannot look for that we cannot look for our prayer to be answered but in our heart we believe that and we love them and we want to see them things the same way that you were not willing that any should perish but that all might come to say praise the Lord thank God for his word tonight that's so good you know coming being raised in the Pentecostal Church there all those truths are just really they were just mine they were Earth chattering to me when I heard the those things in the message cuz uh we were taught just the contrary on a lot of that you know someone speaking in tongues they had something fresh and they would take over even the preaching of the service and take off and do but I'm so glad the word has comeing our day and put that in order for us amen let's take our prayer requests
