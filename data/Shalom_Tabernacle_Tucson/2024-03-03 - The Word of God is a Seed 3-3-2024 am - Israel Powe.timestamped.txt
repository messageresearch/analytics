[2:00] third seal I heard the third Beast say
[2:03] come and see and I beheld in a low black
[2:07] a black horse and he that set on him had
[2:09] a pair of balances in his hand and I
[2:12] Heard a Voice in the midst of the four
[2:14] Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny
[2:18] and three measures of barley for a penny
[2:20] see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
[2:24] amen we're going to be listening to
[2:25] paragraph 72 through
[2:28] 133 this morning it's about 20 minutes
[2:31] amen so let's sing only
[2:38] believe
[2:39] only
[2:43] believe
[2:45] only
[2:47] believe that all things are
[2:53] possible
[2:54] only
[2:58] believe oh only
[3:02] believe
[3:04] only
[3:07] believe all things are
[3:13] possible
[3:14] only we
[3:17] live God bless you you may be seated
[3:19] brother brandom and if you don't
[3:22] remember like that there's something
[3:23] wrong with your
[3:24] faith see you're not sure you're saved
[3:27] yet
[3:27] then you're just guessing it
[3:31] do that all right we ain't going to get
[3:34] into this SE AR all right I want each
[3:38] night I don't know where you mind me
[3:41] taking up your time we could get out a
[3:42] little bit earlier there's not two in
[3:45] the revealing of these of these seals
[3:50] remember it's only really one verse the
[3:54] first tells the announcing of it the
[3:56] second verse most all commentaries and
[3:59] so forth the reading of it or or reading
[4:02] of their thoughts and I have and I've
[4:06] always believed like nearly all of them
[4:08] does that that first horse rider was the
[4:11] was the early church but when the Holy
[4:13] Spirit revealed it it was absolutely
[4:15] contrary to
[4:18] that and so then all it does just show
[4:22] what it is and then I try now to me this
[4:27] is very sacred that's the reason I'd
[4:30] rather answer these questions and let's
[4:33] get it everybody knowing straight and on
[4:35] tapes too that they'll understand now
[4:38] see I Tred to speak a while at night on
[4:41] backgrounding to get the people rushing
[4:44] in and pushing in and you shouldn't do
[4:47] that but when it does it's human beings
[4:50] and it's hot and in here and you and you
[4:53] restless but you've been very very nice
[4:56] the best I've ever seen the people act
[4:58] in the Tabernacle has been this this me
[5:00] and setting quiet and mothers take their
[5:02] babies to the nursery when they start
[5:03] crying and everything has been very nice
[5:06] but I try to backgrounded until I just
[5:09] feel the anointing of the spirit on me
[5:11] to say these words to say what has been
[5:15] revealed to me and then if I'm have
[5:18] somewhere doing that if I have made a
[5:20] mistake here surely here before all the
[5:22] people he'll corrected for me I I want
[5:25] it it's I want it right there no need of
[5:28] taking this what you imagine there's
[5:30] something right and and we want that we
[5:33] want God to give us what's right so
[5:36] now we talk this these Riders as they
[5:40] come up the first horse now uh and we
[5:43] realize that that was the the Antichrist
[5:46] that went forth and then we find out
[5:49] last night that the same fell that went
[5:52] forth as Antichrist is a white horse we
[5:54] found him with a sword last
[5:57] night rid and and killing people now now
[6:02] it's always the natural and the
[6:04] spiritual and for the church sake I want
[6:07] to type just before we get to the
[6:09] opening of this seal which what he give
[6:11] me I got it rot down here I got several
[6:13] scriptures here seven or eight pages of
[6:15] it and as I refer to it uh notice I want
[6:19] to give a type of the church and make it
[6:22] so plain that you'll be bound to see it
[6:25] see now there was a natural bride in in
[6:29] the Garden of Eden remember last night
[6:32] that natural bride she was Adam's
[6:36] sweetheart not yet his wife because he
[6:41] hadn't knew her yet as a wife just like
[6:43] Mary was Joseph wife but he never knew
[6:46] her yet she was found as a child see now
[6:50] before Adam knew his wife she was just a
[6:53] bride to him all right and we find out
[6:57] that um God she she fell in the Garden
[7:00] of Eden because she failed to hold to
[7:06] God's word now he knew that Satan would
[7:09] be loose among them so he gave them uh a
[7:14] place to stay behind fortify them well
[7:18] who could know any better place to be
[7:22] fortified than God if he's trying to
[7:25] take care of his own children if I want
[7:27] to take care of my little Jo jph a
[7:30] brother everything and I know his life
[7:33] depended on it why and I was able to do
[7:37] it well if 40ft concrete reinforced
[7:42] would would be the thing would do it
[7:44] that's I make it 90 foot to be sure that
[7:48] and if I can think that about my little
[7:50] boy which if his mortal life had lost I
[7:53] believe a child would be saved how much
[7:55] more to God to his child that would be
[8:00] eternally
[8:02] lost what should he Place him behind he
[8:06] Place him behind his own
[8:09] word as long as you're in that word
[8:13] you're
[8:14] safe if you abide me and my words in you
[8:17] then just ask what you
[8:19] will that's it the word thank so Eve got
[8:23] the strolling in the garden and she run
[8:26] into the serpent a very polished up sort
[8:28] of a fell and see and he began now he
[8:32] was on the other side God Lives dwells
[8:38] Works in
[8:40] humility never any other
[8:43] way now a little humble lady walking
[8:46] along there and Satan come up as a wise
[8:50] slick polished sort of a fellow and he
[8:53] wanted to seller the program as long as
[8:57] no matter how much Satan was around as
[8:59] long as she stayed behind this word she
[9:01] was all
[9:03] right so let Satan do whatever he wants
[9:06] to you just stay at the word don't make
[9:08] a bit of difference if he says while
[9:10] you're sick by stri some
[9:12] heal well you going to die you're rais
[9:15] me up again
[9:17] prise they just stay behind the word
[9:19] that's all Christ retreated to the word
[9:21] himself it's
[9:23] written now stay behind the word but Eve
[9:27] she began to kind of let down but she
[9:30] never let it all down she only let one
[9:33] little phrase
[9:35] down and that's what SAT want her to do
[9:38] he got her from behind God's Promise by
[9:44] reasoning don't never try to reason
[9:47] God's word just believe
[9:50] it so she stepped out from there and
[9:53] before Adam ever got to her for a wife
[9:57] she was already defiled by Satan amen
[10:00] and she and did you notice Christ did
[10:02] the same
[10:04] thing exactly now far redeeming God had
[10:08] to be there first and did you notice
[10:11] Mary before she would come to Joseph the
[10:15] Holy Spirit done got
[10:17] there that's where the Redeemer come now
[10:21] now notice the Natural Woman fell and
[10:25] God made a way for her to be redeemed
[10:27] although she had fallen he made a way
[10:31] now that was the first Bride on Earth
[10:33] fell before her husband and her were
[10:37] married she fell by by the reason of of
[10:43] reasoning instead of staying with the
[10:44] word she fell amen and she fell to death
[10:50] amen amen Eternal
[10:53] separation with her she took her husband
[10:55] and everything else she was on the earth
[10:57] amen she fell
[10:59] now but God full of Mercy made a way to
[11:04] redeem that woman and now he promised
[11:08] her telling her that sometime in the
[11:11] future the true word would come to her
[11:15] again the true word will be made known
[11:18] to her I remember that because he
[11:22] promised Christ through the woman and
[11:26] Christ is the word amen one in the
[11:29] beginning was the word the word is with
[11:31] God and the Word was God and the word
[11:33] became flesh see and dwelt with us God
[11:37] dwelt With Us in flesh he was the word
[11:40] before word it's a thought and a thought
[11:43] has to be created all right so God's
[11:48] thoughts become creation when it was
[11:50] spoke by a word that's when he present
[11:53] it to to you as a thought is thought and
[11:56] it's revealed to you then it's still a
[11:58] thought until you speak it that's the
[12:01] reason Moses went out to pray a pillar
[12:04] of fire around him and he said go um
[12:07] hold your stick towards the east and say
[12:09] call for flies there's no
[12:12] flies but he went and help the stick
[12:14] there and said let there be flies no
[12:16] flies at all yeah went on back but the
[12:18] words God's thought has already been
[12:20] spoken it's a word now it's got to
[12:24] happen now don't you see what Jesus said
[12:27] if you say to this Mountain not if I say
[12:30] it but you say to this mountain be moved
[12:33] and the first thing I guess in Moses
[12:35] time big old green fly get the buzz and
[12:36] after while it was 5 PBS per yard where'
[12:39] he come from God created him don't you
[12:42] see how God can destroy this world
[12:44] tonight with knats if he wants
[12:47] to well he can pile NS Plum to the
[12:50] Moon all thing do just say Let There Be
[12:53] kns to the Moon that'd be all there
[12:54] would be to it no chemicals nothing they
[12:56] just keep on growing growing growing on
[12:58] see he can do what he wants to he's God
[13:00] the Creator only do just speak it that's
[13:03] right he's the Creator now if we just
[13:06] get to realiz and how great he
[13:08] is he just does what he wishes to he
[13:11] sits up there and looks the people and
[13:12] these little Educators smarten out and
[13:14] there's old God and
[13:17] everything it just like it was at Babel
[13:19] again Babel rather now we notice that
[13:23] God told eveen that after so long a Time
[13:27] the words coming back to you now how did
[13:30] she fall I my class to say what did she
[13:33] fall from what did E fall from the word
[13:37] is that right the word right and God
[13:40] said he'd make a way to redeem her back
[13:43] to the word
[13:45] again all right after so long a Time the
[13:48] word would be known to her all
[13:53] right the word would come for one
[13:56] purpose now hold tight now what I'm
[13:58] saying the the word would come to her
[14:00] for one purpose that was for
[14:03] Redemption all right but until until
[14:07] then she had a substitute that would uh
[14:12] that would work until the time arrived
[14:16] for the original
[14:18] word how you understand clearly see he
[14:22] told her the word would come to her
[14:23] again but until that time he give her a
[14:27] substitute on until that time arrived so
[14:31] he gave her a offering to make a
[14:34] substitute for that blood now the blood
[14:38] was of bulls and sheep goats and things
[14:41] but it didn't take away her
[14:45] sin see it only covered her
[14:48] sin it didn't take it away at all it
[14:50] covered it for it was an animal's blood
[14:53] and in the animal's blood is animal life
[14:56] it was a substitute until
[14:59] the real I get your quotes on the real
[15:04] human blood as human beings would be
[15:08] become
[15:10] incarnate
[15:13] god without sex
[15:15] virgin the Virgin ver produce that
[15:19] now God's
[15:21] word promise became blood and was
[15:26] incarnated in the person of Jesus Christ
[15:28] the Savior the blood of bulls and goats
[15:31] and so forth but now wait here God made
[15:34] the promise saying it would be there
[15:37] when it come her seed should bruise the
[15:39] Serpent's head now if if her seed come
[15:41] just like from Adam or like had been
[15:43] from The Serpent and so forth then still
[15:45] be sinful seed that's the reason John
[15:47] wept there no man because no man
[15:48] everybody's cross the other side of the
[15:50] ditch the chasm but there's coming a
[15:52] time that when this substitute blood of
[15:55] animal would be done away with when the
[15:57] real incarnate blood came God made Flesh
[16:01] and Blood the Bible said he
[16:03] was 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy
[16:07] great is the mystery of God is for God
[16:10] was manifested in
[16:12] flesh that's right uh virgin birth did
[16:16] this now the blood of sheep and goats
[16:18] covered sin but didn't get rid of it for
[16:22] it was an animals blood but it was to be
[16:25] all right was to be a substitute and
[16:27] they sure got uh got used to that
[16:30] subtitute and so they just kept on and
[16:33] when the real promised word was made
[16:35] manifest in Jesus
[16:38] Christ who proved to be the son of the
[16:42] great Creator God and was Vindicated
[16:46] himself by being the Living Word of
[16:51] God he proved he was he could speak
[16:55] things into
[16:57] existence there ain't a human being or
[17:00] or nothing the world can do ain't a
[17:02] thing on earth can create but God the
[17:05] devil can't create he's a perverter of
[17:08] what's been created but he can't create
[17:11] amen sin is only righteousness perverted
[17:15] you know what I mean what is a lie it's
[17:17] a truth misrepresented see what is an
[17:20] adultery the right legal act uh
[17:23] perverted everything in sin sin is just
[17:27] the truth perverted now he could not
[17:30] create but when Christ came proved he
[17:34] was the creator amen there was the blood
[17:38] that was been promised now if you want
[17:40] to read that you let's just turn for a
[17:42] minute we go take a time on this any
[17:44] tonight it makes me nervous I think
[17:46] everybody wants to go home you
[17:49] know now let's get acts two thank you
[17:52] and we'll
[17:56] just acts two and we'll find find out
[17:58] whether this is right or not whether he
[18:01] was proved that he was
[18:04] godu get Acts 2 now let's get here at
[18:07] the 22nd verse Peter speak in the day of
[18:10] Pentecost ye man of Israel hear these
[18:13] words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved
[18:17] of God among you by Miracles wonders and
[18:20] sign which God did by him in the midst
[18:23] of you as you your ALS you yourselves
[18:26] also know
[18:29] a man that was a proved that it was God
[18:33] among you by the very things he done
[18:36] proed that he was here's Peter stand at
[18:38] the Sanhedrin telling him Nicodemus know
[18:42] the same he said Rabbi we all know that
[18:45] you are a teacher comes from God because
[18:48] no man could do these things say he come
[18:50] from
[18:51] God they know it but why what now ev's
[18:56] promises but when that Bride come on
[19:00] down and refused when the real word came
[19:05] to her so the woman refused to recognize
[19:12] the Hebrew
[19:14] Bride for she was the Bride of of God he
[19:19] put her away in divorcement is that
[19:21] right she was a bride of God you say
[19:24] well he wasn't never married yet that's
[19:26] right but Joseph put Mary away before it
[19:28] was going to put Mary way before this
[19:29] Mary see he was engaged to her and when
[19:33] he come and the word that he Pro
[19:37] promised come for the wedding he found
[19:40] her wrapped in her substitutes so bad
[19:43] that she wouldn't take the real promise
[19:45] that had been made the word Christ maybe
[19:49] you don't get it let me go over again I
[19:52] want you to get that thing she was
[19:55] promised the bride Eve to be a redeemer
[20:02] the Redeemer would be the
[20:05] word and when the word came made flesh
[20:08] she rejected it she was given
[20:11] substitutes a hold that substitute given
[20:14] substitutes to go on until the Redeemer
[20:18] come and when the Redeemer comes she
[20:19] want to continue with her substitute and
[20:22] rejected the true
[20:24] word that was the Hebrew
[20:27] bride
[20:29] so did he by the second Eve bride a
[20:33] mother of all Spiritual Living see Eve
[20:37] means the mother of all as spirit all
[20:39] its living Eve mother of all its living
[20:43] now and when he came to the Hebrew bride
[20:47] she was the mother of all that was
[20:49] living but she rejected it naturel Eve
[20:53] fell in Eden by listening to Satan's
[20:57] reasoning against God's word that's how
[20:59] she fell all right sir she fell because
[21:02] she did that spiritual Eve now that's
[21:05] the church Christ bride she fell not in
[21:09] Eden but in Rome am
[21:13] see at the Nia Council when she rejected
[21:17] that Pentecostal church that went down
[21:21] to Nia and listening to Romans reasoning
[21:25] instead of holding on to the word she
[21:28] fell and everything away from her died
[21:32] with her around
[21:34] her now just as natural Eve fell
[21:39] spiritual Eve fell God's bride fa fell
[21:43] in the garden Christ bride fell in Rome
[21:47] see notice by the same reasoning against
[21:52] God's
[21:53] word she also
[21:56] forfeited her writes a virtue to Satan
[22:01] which we found in the breaking of these
[22:03] seals that that was Satan and still is
[22:06] Satan there the Bible said it's the very
[22:09] seed of
[22:10] Satan amen and as e forfeited her her
[22:16] virtuous rights and give them over to
[22:19] Satan in the Garden of
[22:22] Eden the church the bride of Christ did
[22:26] the same thing at Rome when they
[22:28] forfeited the Bible for their dogmas and
[22:32] reasoning see how types you just run
[22:35] those types your B to come out right if
[22:37] my hand looks like if I've never seen
[22:39] myself and I see my shadow coming I'll
[22:41] know just about what I look like see but
[22:44] that's what if you want to see what's
[22:45] coming look what has been for the all
[22:47] the old things were Shadows of things to
[22:49] come the Bible said all right for she
[22:53] forfeit her virtuous word the word of
[22:56] God when she sold the Bible and put a
[22:59] man in there that says that the church
[23:03] has rights to change anything they want
[23:05] to
[23:06] change and they've done
[23:08] it and the bride of Christ the
[23:12] Pentecostal bride sold out her virtue at
[23:16] Nia just as Eve sold her virtue to Satan
[23:20] in the Garden of Eden exactly all
[23:26] right

[1:09:37] shall strengthen your heart all ye that
[1:09:40] hope in the Lord amen thank God for the
[1:09:43] reading of his word what a blessing we'
[1:09:47] like to take our scripture reading in
[1:09:49] Matthew chapter
[1:09:52] 13
[1:10:22] and the scripture I like to read
[1:10:26] here we condense it down a little bit
[1:10:37] here we'll take verses
[1:10:43] number
[1:10:48] three pardon me just a
[1:10:52] moment
[1:11:19] M oh my let's see
[1:11:22] this
[1:11:28] in verse three Matthew chap
[1:11:31] 13:3 and he spake many things unto them
[1:11:34] in Parables saying Behold a swer went
[1:11:37] forth to sow when he swed some seeds
[1:11:40] fell by the wayside and the fowls came
[1:11:42] and devoured them up some fell upon
[1:11:45] stonely places where they had not much
[1:11:48] Earth and forth with they sprung up
[1:11:52] because they had no deepness of Earth
[1:11:54] when the sun was up they were scorched
[1:11:57] and because they had no root they
[1:11:59] withered away and some fell among thorns
[1:12:02] and the Thorns sprang up and choked them
[1:12:05] but other fell into good ground and
[1:12:08] brought forth fruit some 100-fold some
[1:12:12] 60-fold some 30 fold who hath ears to
[1:12:17] hear Let Him
[1:12:19] hear and we like to take
[1:12:24] um verses number 18 to
[1:12:27] 23 as
[1:12:30] well so Jesus is explaining the parable
[1:12:34] he says Hear the parable of the swer
[1:12:36] when anyone heareth the word of God of
[1:12:38] the
[1:12:39] kingdom understande it not then cometh
[1:12:42] the wicked one and catcheth away that
[1:12:43] which was sown in his heart this is he
[1:12:46] which receive by the
[1:12:48] wayside receive seed by the wayside but
[1:12:51] he that receiveth the seed and Stony
[1:12:53] places the same is he the same is he
[1:12:56] that heareth the word and Anon with joy
[1:12:59] receiveth it yet hath he not root in
[1:13:03] himself but doth for a while for when
[1:13:06] tribulation or persecution ariseth
[1:13:09] because of the word by and by He Is
[1:13:12] offended he also that receives seed
[1:13:15] among the Thorns is he that Hearth the
[1:13:17] word and the cares of this world and the
[1:13:20] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[1:13:24] and he becometh unfruitful but he that
[1:13:27] receiveth seed into the good ground is
[1:13:29] he that heareth the word and
[1:13:32] understandeth it which also beareth
[1:13:34] fruit and bringing forth some 100-fold
[1:13:37] some 60 some 30 amen and so we thank God
[1:13:42] for the reading of his word we just want
[1:13:44] to speak on to see the word of God is a
[1:13:48] seed the word of God is a seed very
[1:13:51] simple text we've been speaking on you
[1:13:54] know we win by our conversation the
[1:13:56] spoken words The Original Seed and a
[1:13:59] positive confession we want to continue
[1:14:01] in that in this title this morning seed
[1:14:06] the seed is the word of God let's pray
[1:14:09] father we ask your blessings upon this
[1:14:11] word we pray bless every heart we ask in
[1:14:15] Jesus name we pray amen God bless you
[1:14:18] you may be
[1:14:22] seated
[1:14:29] now we thank God for his word the
[1:14:31] reading of his
[1:14:33] word and as we move into this um
[1:14:37] particular subject again we've been
[1:14:40] dealing with these principles of
[1:14:42] planting a seed these are principles
[1:14:45] that are laws of God there's laws in
[1:14:48] atmosphere there's laws on how we deal
[1:14:51] with electricity there's laws laws in
[1:14:53] gravity there's laws in the speed of
[1:14:56] light of sound even your body is made up
[1:15:00] of laws and the doctors when they go to
[1:15:02] examine you they're looking at the
[1:15:05] different systems in your body your
[1:15:07] blood pressure with your heart your bone
[1:15:11] structure how are things going in your
[1:15:13] body that's based on laws of what
[1:15:16] regular should be and then there's
[1:15:19] abnormalities and when things are
[1:15:21] abnormal they have to make an adjustment
[1:15:25] and they have to give you an evaluation
[1:15:28] of what's going on and he's doing that
[1:15:30] not by some uh something out of the air
[1:15:33] but he's studied and he has principles
[1:15:37] and there's instructions that he follows
[1:15:41] and that's how he handles you he has to
[1:15:43] handle you based on what you can tell
[1:15:45] him I've been eating a balanced diet
[1:15:48] I've been exercising like you said doc
[1:15:50] I've been taking all my vitamins that's
[1:15:52] all okay that's all good but we still
[1:15:54] need to examine you and when he examines
[1:15:56] you the examination will tell him how
[1:16:00] you've been doing in your diet the
[1:16:02] examination of your blood and your heart
[1:16:04] rake and all of that will be taking
[1:16:05] place because he's not looking at just
[1:16:07] your words or your testimony there's
[1:16:10] principles that he's following and the
[1:16:12] word of God is based upon these
[1:16:14] principles Satan himself knows these
[1:16:18] principles and he used this principle uh
[1:16:21] against Eve in the Garden against the
[1:16:24] human race he knew that every seed must
[1:16:27] bring forth of his kind if you put a
[1:16:30] seed in the right atmosphere you allow
[1:16:33] it to grow it will produce whether you
[1:16:35] pray about it or not whether you was
[1:16:38] wanting to get get it back or try to
[1:16:40] change it or not it will produce after
[1:16:43] its kind and Satan knew this so he
[1:16:45] planted his seed as unbelieving seed
[1:16:48] into the human race through Eve and this
[1:16:53] law and these principles he held true
[1:16:56] and god holds these true as well we've
[1:16:58] been sharing with you all here at the
[1:17:01] church that you know our words mean more
[1:17:05] to us than perhaps we realize and then
[1:17:08] when we look at this Parable here there
[1:17:10] is four places that the seed has been
[1:17:14] planted it's by the wayside a Stony
[1:17:17] places Thorns amongst thorns and then it
[1:17:20] was also planted in good ground
[1:17:23] remember this there was nothing wrong
[1:17:26] with the seed the seed was the original
[1:17:29] seed it was a proper seed but where it
[1:17:32] was planted and placed made a big
[1:17:35] difference and I want you to notice also
[1:17:37] that a good seed even planted in good
[1:17:40] ground It produced some 30 some 60 some
[1:17:45] 100 fold now in in farming and in
[1:17:49] planting we all want the greatest yield
[1:17:52] that we can can get when we plant a seed
[1:17:55] and the Bible I shared this with you
[1:17:56] before the Bible says that Isaac in
[1:17:59] Genesis 26 he planted in one year and he
[1:18:03] received a h hundredfold of his planting
[1:18:05] because the Lord blessed him and this
[1:18:09] was during a time of a famine and so the
[1:18:12] blessing comes from the Lord he opens up
[1:18:14] the seed he gerti it he allows it to
[1:18:18] grow but we have a part to play and that
[1:18:21] and that first part is the knowing that
[1:18:23] that the word of God is a seed and so
[1:18:25] what we do as Believers as we approach
[1:18:28] the Lord and and this is how we should
[1:18:31] approach everything is that we judge
[1:18:34] ourself and our faith and others by how
[1:18:37] they stand on the word we don't judge
[1:18:40] them based on you know maybe they might
[1:18:43] be a little loud or a little too quiet
[1:18:46] or they're a little this way or that way
[1:18:48] a little indifferent but how do they
[1:18:51] handle the word a how does that man
[1:18:54] really handle the word because if he's
[1:18:56] handling the word with respect in the
[1:18:59] right way God will place him where he
[1:19:02] needs to be but if he's already
[1:19:04] disrespectful with the word you know
[1:19:06] there there's he loses his position
[1:19:09] right there so sometimes we see a child
[1:19:11] they'll come they'll accept the word of
[1:19:14] God we see them come to the altar
[1:19:16] they'll accept the promise of God and
[1:19:19] they're still doing things that's not
[1:19:20] quite convenient maybe they hav matured
[1:19:23] yet but look at look at their attitude
[1:19:26] towards the word and that's what we
[1:19:27] Foster that's what we Fellowship around
[1:19:30] give it a chance to grow it'll mature
[1:19:33] don't don't don't cut people out so
[1:19:35] quickly especially if they re if they
[1:19:38] receive the word if they receive the
[1:19:40] word in their life let God continue to
[1:19:43] bless them and don't try to come down so
[1:19:45] hard on them because they have to take
[1:19:47] root first and they has to settle into
[1:19:50] their heart and their mind first and so
[1:19:53] sometimes we do that with young
[1:19:54] Christians we do that with young
[1:19:55] churches young pastors young Ministries
[1:19:59] we get a young Minister up and some
[1:20:01] people won't even hear a young Minister
[1:20:03] preach because they're too revelated or
[1:20:05] too anointed but you know what you know
[1:20:07] the young men's got to start somewhere
[1:20:10] and and if he's handling the word
[1:20:13] properly then you want to Foster that
[1:20:15] because he'll grow and he'll mature with
[1:20:17] the word how many believe that well just
[1:20:19] put it this way you started somewhere
[1:20:23] and you started and you stumbled and you
[1:20:25] made
[1:20:26] mistakes don't we all is there Grace for
[1:20:30] everybody that's making a mistake amen
[1:20:32] absolutely so we have to remember that
[1:20:35] and so we know that the seed is the word
[1:20:38] of God and God's word is this seed and
[1:20:42] we become the Planters of this word by
[1:20:45] the way we speak the way we speak and
[1:20:48] the way we handle the word it is um it
[1:20:52] is very it's very very important to God
[1:20:55] I want you to look at this Matthew
[1:20:58] Chapter 13 just just for a moment that
[1:21:03] the the
[1:21:05] seed had to
[1:21:07] contend with
[1:21:09] two uh different obstacles in order for
[1:21:13] it to grow and to
[1:21:15] thrive and the first obstacle as we know
[1:21:18] very well it was the atmosphere that it
[1:21:20] was planted in and so although we have
[1:21:24] the right seed it's a gerti seed where
[1:21:27] it is planted is going to determine how
[1:21:30] well it does the kind of ground is it in
[1:21:34] a positive atmosphere the kind of the
[1:21:37] nurture that is getting that's all very
[1:21:40] very important you could take the word
[1:21:43] and you could just plant it anywhere but
[1:21:45] it still needs to be right in the right
[1:21:47] atmosphere and the next enemy that it
[1:21:49] would have is the wicked one so we have
[1:21:52] these two forces that are working
[1:21:55] against a seed now we know the seed or
[1:21:58] the word of God will not return void
[1:22:01] amen it would always accomplish what it
[1:22:03] was sent to do but there's places that
[1:22:06] it thrives better than other places and
[1:22:09] we'll see that even with the message it
[1:22:12] goes better it does better in different
[1:22:14] cities and than other cities and what's
[1:22:17] the reason for that I don't know exactly
[1:22:18] why you think that you know our church
[1:22:21] our city here has 14 15 maybe 16
[1:22:25] churches and there's some states that
[1:22:27] only have maybe one and it's barely
[1:22:29] struggling what happened there well God
[1:22:32] God knows God God is in control of that
[1:22:35] but the seed will not return void and so
[1:22:39] the the
[1:22:40] Wayside is where the seed falls into a
[1:22:44] heart and they don't understand the word
[1:22:46] of God and so they don't even ask God
[1:22:49] for Revelation to open up the word to
[1:22:51] them many of them they don't even pray
[1:22:54] for Revelation many come and they hear
[1:22:57] the word of Truth and they don't let it
[1:22:59] settle down into their heart and so what
[1:23:02] happens is they don't understand it and
[1:23:04] when they leave the wicked one is there
[1:23:07] to take the word that was even sown in
[1:23:10] their heart and the second place is
[1:23:13] Stony places this is where the seed was
[1:23:16] planted but it had no root there to grow
[1:23:19] thereby didn't go deep enough to find a
[1:23:22] place to grow and then amongst the
[1:23:26] Thorns this was a seed that was planted
[1:23:30] and then the cares of the world be to
[1:23:33] choke out the seed that it would not
[1:23:36] produce and wouldn't grow and then
[1:23:39] finally it was planted in good ground
[1:23:42] and the good ground was he that
[1:23:44] understood what he
[1:23:45] heard the good ground was he that beared
[1:23:48] fruit from what he heard the good ground
[1:23:51] was he that br bringeth forth fruits
[1:23:55] it's interesting how many times we'll be
[1:23:58] in a good service and the word of be God
[1:24:01] will be preached and we know we had a
[1:24:02] good times we felt the anointing and you
[1:24:05] get out and you ask the people what did
[1:24:07] the brother preach on what was the
[1:24:09] subject where did he get his scripture
[1:24:11] from it's amazing how we lose that and
[1:24:15] we don't Foster that like we should and
[1:24:19] so why is that that happens because the
[1:24:21] enemy is involved in how this seed is
[1:24:24] planted and and as the seed is being
[1:24:27] planted it's your job to keep that seed
[1:24:30] in the right atmosphere it's your job to
[1:24:33] make sure that you've got a good
[1:24:36] understanding of what's being said or at
[1:24:38] least the portion that God is revealing
[1:24:40] to you that it' be understood now
[1:24:43] brother vandom gives an example of how
[1:24:47] many remember he was talking about those
[1:24:50] two women one that had a she had a a
[1:24:53] some a stomach ailment and the other one
[1:24:55] had a growth in her neck and he said
[1:24:59] that in the meeting that night the angel
[1:25:01] of the Lord he said it in different
[1:25:03] places came down and spoke to them and
[1:25:06] gave them the Word of
[1:25:08] Deliverance and then they went home into
[1:25:11] their neighborhood and one morning a
[1:25:13] cool feeling came up over the mom one of
[1:25:16] them that was eating and you know she
[1:25:19] just felt like she should take that
[1:25:21] promise and she claimed the promise even
[1:25:24] though she knew she was sick she knew it
[1:25:26] wasn't do do good but she ate a little
[1:25:28] bit and God blessed her she ate a little
[1:25:31] bit more and blessed her and she
[1:25:33] realized she was healed and then she
[1:25:35] wanted to go tell her friend down the
[1:25:37] street so she ran down the street and
[1:25:39] her friend was praising the Lord she was
[1:25:43] in a a an atmosphere of Praise because
[1:25:46] that tumor that she had upon her was now
[1:25:49] gone she was looking through the sheets
[1:25:51] and saying where the tumor words and
[1:25:53] they came back and gave brother bam this
[1:25:55] testimony this is what brother banam
[1:25:56] says now these principles are true
[1:25:59] either they're true or not he said that
[1:26:00] the angel of the Lord went through the
[1:26:04] neighborhood to hunt them
[1:26:06] down to see if they were still
[1:26:11] believing Lord now these
[1:26:14] principles uh we can't I can't identify
[1:26:17] them how they happen here in real time
[1:26:19] today but a prophet gives us enough to
[1:26:22] know that this how it works remember
[1:26:25] Grace Weber we shared her testimony last
[1:26:27] week how she was testifying of the good
[1:26:31] things he said that the angel of the
[1:26:33] Lord heard her testifying amen he says
[1:26:36] go tell her she'll not die tell her that
[1:26:39] I hurt her and that I'm going to heal
[1:26:42] her so here the angel of the Lord follow
[1:26:45] Miss Weber to her job a hostile
[1:26:48] environment but now you got a she's got
[1:26:50] the seed of promise and she stood up for
[1:26:53] what was right and the angel of the Lord
[1:26:55] heard her and here the angel of the Lord
[1:26:58] found these women knew their
[1:27:00] neighborhood just like God knows your
[1:27:02] neighborhood and
[1:27:04] he uh heard their words and now he's
[1:27:08] bringing to pass what the promise was
[1:27:12] now I'll read a few from there and
[1:27:14] brother brandom says this in the message
[1:27:16] the second
[1:27:18] Miracle paragraph number six he says and
[1:27:21] she found her neighbor down in the floor
[1:27:23] screaming to the top of her voice the
[1:27:25] growth had just left her neck a few
[1:27:28] minutes before that you know what it was
[1:27:31] it was the angel of the Lord passing
[1:27:33] through that neighborhood of those
[1:27:35] things that he had Pro
[1:27:38] pronounced if he pronounces it it's his
[1:27:42] obligation not mine or yours see it's
[1:27:46] your obligation to Keep On Believing
[1:27:49] it's my obligation to stay here and work
[1:27:52] for him it's your obligation to believe
[1:27:55] what he tells you and God will bring it
[1:27:58] to pass now that can't always answer
[1:28:01] spontaneously when Paul was out on the
[1:28:03] ocean that night 14 days and nights
[1:28:06] without moon or stars all hopes was gone
[1:28:09] is that right no hopes at all on those
[1:28:12] seamen oh men with Barnacles on them
[1:28:16] most they've been in the sea a long time
[1:28:18] all hopes is gone if they should ever
[1:28:20] live so he couldn't answer spontaneously
[1:28:22] with Paul he didn't answer spontaneously
[1:28:25] with these two women brother bam says it
[1:28:27] a little different here in the faith
[1:28:30] trip report he says this here in
[1:28:32] paragraph
[1:28:33] 171 said you're feeling better sir I
[1:28:36] thought so you're going to get over that
[1:28:38] nervousness and be all right now the
[1:28:41] blessings are still on you so don't
[1:28:43] worry if the blessings placed on you
[1:28:47] hold
[1:28:48] still sometimes it's days before he can
[1:28:51] get to you you Daniel Prayed one time
[1:28:54] and the angel didn't get to him for 21
[1:28:56] days is that right I've seen the time
[1:28:59] where women and men would wait for weeks
[1:29:02] and the first thing you know all at once
[1:29:04] it happened the angel passing through
[1:29:08] the neighborhood he knows where it's at
[1:29:11] whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind
[1:29:13] in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth
[1:29:15] I'll loose in heaven is that right
[1:29:18] that's his
[1:29:20] sovereignty prophet of God continues and
[1:29:23] how the angel came to me
[1:29:24] 1953 so down the street she went to tell
[1:29:27] her neighbor four or five doors below
[1:29:30] her when she got in to tell her neighbor
[1:29:34] she found her neighbor in there
[1:29:35] screaming at the top of her voice and
[1:29:38] the lump had just left her throat so
[1:29:41] they didn't know what it was what it was
[1:29:44] on the platform when the angel of the
[1:29:46] Lord had pronounced that he can't be to
[1:29:50] you just at every second but he had
[1:29:52] passed through the neighborhood
[1:29:54] confirming the word of God making it
[1:29:57] right sometimes you pray I believe
[1:30:00] Daniel the angel couldn't get to him one
[1:30:02] time when he was asking I believe 21
[1:30:05] days wasn't it 21 days for can get there
[1:30:08] see now if you if you if you'd have lost
[1:30:12] faith they'd lost out but you do just
[1:30:16] exactly what God says do this is his
[1:30:20] word first the other is
[1:30:23] secondarily can you say praise the Lord
[1:30:26] so we do what God says first everything
[1:30:30] else is
[1:30:31] secondarily and so we know that when the
[1:30:34] word of the Lord is spoken to us and
[1:30:36] sometimes we look at this Parable and we
[1:30:39] when we place it as a Believer maybe
[1:30:41] their life there's a believer that comes
[1:30:43] in contact with the word and they're in
[1:30:45] it for a little bit and then they leave
[1:30:48] or they come in contact with the word
[1:30:49] and then the trials hit and then they
[1:30:51] leave and we place it like that but
[1:30:53] let's let's let's look at this in real
[1:30:56] time how this can take place this can
[1:30:59] take place even this morning and I
[1:31:01] believe it's happened many many Sunday
[1:31:03] mornings and Wednesday services and tape
[1:31:06] Services where the Holy Spirit has
[1:31:09] instilled some things into your heart
[1:31:11] and you know it's true and you guarantee
[1:31:14] and God has blessed you at a certain
[1:31:17] point in the service actually we should
[1:31:20] be looking for those points that God is
[1:31:22] speaking to us in the service we should
[1:31:24] be looking for our time that God that's
[1:31:27] for me that's my word I'm going to catch
[1:31:29] on to that and when you catch that word
[1:31:32] you hold on to it but how does that
[1:31:34] happen in real time you know um God will
[1:31:37] speak that word and then right after
[1:31:39] service right next afternoon the next
[1:31:42] Monday or Tuesday we've forgotten those
[1:31:46] promises that God gave to us yes and
[1:31:49] that's the wrong atmosphere to have that
[1:31:51] seed in
[1:31:52] that's the wrong time to disbelieve his
[1:31:56] word we have to hold on to his word once
[1:31:59] it has been spoken we keep it in the
[1:32:01] right atmosphere which is the atmosphere
[1:32:03] of faith and then we know that God is
[1:32:06] going to keep his word we see this take
[1:32:10] place um many times and what what we
[1:32:14] what God has done for us it is Our
[1:32:17] obligation to believe that and give a
[1:32:19] witness to that and to speak that out as
[1:32:22] though it is true for it is true it's
[1:32:25] God's word as I share with you in Psalms
[1:32:28] 27 says Lord deliver me from my enemies
[1:32:32] false Witnesses have risen up against me
[1:32:34] such as breathe out cruelty you just
[1:32:37] want to be careful that you're not the
[1:32:39] false witness that's breathing against
[1:32:43] yourself and sometimes we look at the
[1:32:45] enemies and somebody out there but
[1:32:47] sometimes it's your attitude and the the
[1:32:50] language that we speak about about
[1:32:51] ourselves is contrary to the word of God
[1:32:55] and when it's contrary to the word of
[1:32:56] God then you become your worst enemy you
[1:33:00] already got an enemy he's a real one
[1:33:02] he's the Devil he's the wicked one and
[1:33:05] he's there to catch away whatever God
[1:33:08] put into your heart he's there to take
[1:33:11] that away that's your enemy but then you
[1:33:13] have another enemy that's you and if
[1:33:16] you're not in the right place you'll
[1:33:18] begin to say things and to speak things
[1:33:21] that are contrary to the word and that's
[1:33:24] what we want to be careful of so this
[1:33:27] atmosphere we talk about we don't want
[1:33:30] the seed of the word in a hostile
[1:33:32] environment this is why Believers this
[1:33:35] is whole the perp one of the great
[1:33:36] purposes of coming to church we come in
[1:33:39] the atmosphere of Believers this is the
[1:33:42] P purpose of staying in good company and
[1:33:45] then your it develops who you are the
[1:33:49] people who you hang out with show me
[1:33:52] your company and I'll show you who you
[1:33:54] are because you feed on the people that
[1:33:57] you're with and if you're in a negative
[1:34:00] group a negative chat a negative session
[1:34:03] a a negative posting or a negative set
[1:34:07] of people that's what you become that's
[1:34:09] what you are you're part of that
[1:34:11] negative atmosphere and the seed of the
[1:34:13] word of God will not grow in that kind
[1:34:16] of
[1:34:17] atmosphere we want to keep the word of
[1:34:19] God in a positive atmosphere we want our
[1:34:22] our lips to offer the fruits of his
[1:34:25] praise from our lips to say what the
[1:34:28] word says is true amen now these are
[1:34:32] very simple uh thoughts and very simple
[1:34:36] truths but they work they absolutely
[1:34:39] work and these are these are the things
[1:34:42] this is how we handle the adversities in
[1:34:45] our life we handle it by the word of God
[1:34:48] we take God's word and then we establish
[1:34:52] that we make sure that this is God's
[1:34:54] word and then we just start repeating
[1:34:56] what God's word says and as we repeat
[1:34:59] what God's word says we're confessing
[1:35:01] the word of God and the word will not
[1:35:05] return void now God allows these
[1:35:08] tensions to come he allows it to happen
[1:35:11] in the church and in an atmosphere to
[1:35:14] see how you'll
[1:35:15] stand now the prophet of God says this
[1:35:18] here in the message
[1:35:24] um why Christ
[1:35:26] speak paragraph 37 he says this
[1:35:32] here actually we'll we'll we we'll take
[1:35:35] what does thou here I read this for you
[1:35:37] many times I'll read it for you here
[1:35:39] 1959 what Dost thou hear it says it's
[1:35:43] very strange Pastor here knows and other
[1:35:46] ministers watch out your Mount carel
[1:35:50] you're going to have a j juniper tree
[1:35:52] whenever a man has a blessing and the
[1:35:56] power of God Pours Down and does
[1:35:58] something for you look out Satan is on
[1:36:01] the track just remember the next day
[1:36:05] that Monday after a good day on Sunday
[1:36:09] is going to be a hard thing because he's
[1:36:12] going to do everything he can to knock
[1:36:15] that confidence out of you that the Holy
[1:36:19] Spirit instilled in you the de day
[1:36:21] before so the Holy Spirit instills or
[1:36:25] installs something in you and then the
[1:36:27] next day Satan is trying to take it out
[1:36:29] of you and how does he take it out of
[1:36:32] you he doesn't come up and say hey I'm
[1:36:34] Satan I want to take that word out of
[1:36:35] you now he come he comes with a bad
[1:36:39] attitude somebody cut you off in traffic
[1:36:42] somebody rolled their eyes at you
[1:36:45] someone sends you an email someone bups
[1:36:48] you gives you the cold shoulder he's
[1:36:51] trying to take out what the Holy Spirit
[1:36:53] instilled in you and some of us are
[1:36:55] ready to fight so much we just drop
[1:36:57] everything and ready to go you're not
[1:36:59] going to disrespect me that way you look
[1:37:02] at me that way I'll deal with you you
[1:37:04] want to start it I'll finish it and
[1:37:06] that's the attitude of many people but
[1:37:08] the Holy Spirit spoke to you on Sunday
[1:37:11] maybe nobody else in their job was in an
[1:37:13] atmosphere like you and maybe your job
[1:37:16] is a negative in a in a a a a dark
[1:37:19] atmosphere for the word of God to grow
[1:37:21] in the seed but God planted the seed in
[1:37:24] you and that seed that he planted is his
[1:37:28] word and then we hold on to that word
[1:37:31] and let the word do what it's supposed
[1:37:34] to do it's supposed to grow that seed is
[1:37:37] supposed to multiply and produce more
[1:37:42] than what you actually receive that's
[1:37:43] how seeds work you plant a seed you
[1:37:46] water a seed you nurture the seed you
[1:37:50] you give it the atmosphere spere and
[1:37:51] then when it grows and you keep it
[1:37:53] growing and it grows and then the
[1:37:55] Harvest time comes and when the Harvest
[1:37:58] time comes you can't even eat all the
[1:37:59] fruit yourself your cup runs over you
[1:38:02] got to share it with other people and
[1:38:05] that's a beautiful thing when you reach
[1:38:06] that point and so we know that those
[1:38:10] Mondays those murmuring Mondays I call
[1:38:13] them you got to watch out for those
[1:38:15] murmuring
[1:38:16] Mondays because Satan is there to catch
[1:38:19] you look what brother randam says and
[1:38:21] why Christ speak he says it here in
[1:38:24] paragraph 46 46 Now isn't isn't that
[1:38:27] just like today we see the message come
[1:38:31] forth we see the church rise to a place
[1:38:34] on the wings of the Holy Spirit until
[1:38:37] the power of God Thrills every person in
[1:38:40] there the glory of God Falls around and
[1:38:45] signs and wonders take place less than a
[1:38:50] week Satan is permitted to come into
[1:38:54] that congregation why does he do it God
[1:38:58] permits it and then the church begins to
[1:39:00] murmur and fall back maybe it wasn't so
[1:39:03] there's where we fail that's the failing
[1:39:06] of the church regardless of what takes
[1:39:08] place it's God move forward so not even
[1:39:13] a week later we have our special
[1:39:16] meetings not even a week later fighting
[1:39:19] tensions rubbings
[1:39:21] she said he said I can't believe they
[1:39:24] and that that Satan is allowed to do
[1:39:27] that he's allowed to do that so you can
[1:39:30] hold on to the seed of what God has done
[1:39:32] for you
[1:39:34] amen the prophet of God continues he
[1:39:37] says this here in the message possessing
[1:39:40] the enemy's
[1:39:43] Gates it was Moses after being also in
[1:39:46] the line of this Royal seed the Seed of
[1:39:48] Abraham that when he sat down into Egypt
[1:39:51] to deliver the children of Israel and
[1:39:53] God gave him signs and wonders to
[1:39:55] perform and to Smite the Earth and to
[1:39:57] bring forth frogs fleas and darkness and
[1:40:00] hell and rain and fire and had done all
[1:40:03] these Miracles yet when he let them out
[1:40:05] by the hand of Jehovah there come a time
[1:40:08] when he met the gate between him and the
[1:40:10] promised land there was the Red Sea a
[1:40:14] bar across the way they were hemmed in
[1:40:16] by Pharaoh's Army mountains and deserts
[1:40:19] and the Red Sea but Moses stepped
[1:40:22] forward and possessed the Gate of his
[1:40:24] enemy and crossed the Red Sea dry shod
[1:40:28] as he was walking on a dusty road he
[1:40:31] shall possess the Gate of the enemy God
[1:40:33] said so that settles it it was only a
[1:40:37] few years later when the Trials come and
[1:40:41] the church got All Shook Up as it's so
[1:40:44] easy for a Congregation of people to do
[1:40:48] when something just don't seem to happen
[1:40:50] the way way it's supposed to be God
[1:40:54] makes it that way who makes it that way
[1:40:57] God help me preach now Hallelujah who
[1:41:00] makes it that way God God makes it that
[1:41:03] way God brings tensions into the church
[1:41:07] see that old dirty devil bringing all
[1:41:10] the tensions into the church God allows
[1:41:12] the tensions in the
[1:41:14] church he allows
[1:41:17] it you after a great outpouring in the
[1:41:20] Holy Spirit not even a week
[1:41:24] later carnal comes Upon Us All Shook Up
[1:41:29] from that congregation God brings
[1:41:31] tensions into the church every son that
[1:41:34] cometh to God must be tried proven and
[1:41:37] tested he lets sickness strikes you he
[1:41:40] lets disease come on you to test you and
[1:41:43] to prove you to show the world that
[1:41:45] you're truly the Seed of Abraham he
[1:41:48] permits it by his own will he permits
[1:41:52] disasters he permits the friends to turn
[1:41:55] against you he per he permits all these
[1:41:58] things and turns the devil loose to
[1:42:00] tempt you and he'll do all but take your
[1:42:03] life he could throw you on a bed of
[1:42:06] Affliction he could turn your neighbors
[1:42:08] against you he could turn the church
[1:42:11] against you he can do most anything it's
[1:42:14] God's will for him to do it we're taught
[1:42:18] that is more precious than gold amen
[1:42:21] think about that God can allow or will
[1:42:26] allow tensions to rise to persecute you
[1:42:30] now if you're the true seed you'll keep
[1:42:32] that seed in the right atmosphere how
[1:42:34] many's ever had persecution strike them
[1:42:38] how many knows that it happens even from
[1:42:40] friends and other believers and God
[1:42:44] allows it sometimes the church will turn
[1:42:47] against you but God allows that but he
[1:42:51] planted the seed of the word in you and
[1:42:53] he expects you to keep that seed to keep
[1:42:56] that word committed now the seed versus
[1:43:02] the elements and the seed versus The
[1:43:06] Wicked one so you have the outside
[1:43:09] elements that's always going to be there
[1:43:11] the worldly pressures the things of the
[1:43:13] world the wicked one is also there to
[1:43:17] pressurize you but you are the believer
[1:43:20] that's actually planting the seed you
[1:43:24] are the one that plants the the the the
[1:43:29] Atmosphere by your your attitude and by
[1:43:33] your steadfastness in what God Said in
[1:43:36] his word once his word has been revealed
[1:43:38] to you then you realize that you plant
[1:43:41] those seeds and those seeds have to
[1:43:44] bring forth these are principles that
[1:43:47] must be adhered to by the word of God he
[1:43:50] instills those and he gives those to us
[1:43:53] so that we can we can um we can grow
[1:43:56] thereby it's for our benefit God gives
[1:43:59] that to us now the scripture says in
[1:44:05] Philippians uh uh Hebrews chapter 13
[1:44:08] verse number 15 it says this here by him
[1:44:12] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[1:44:14] praise to God
[1:44:17] continually that is the what help me
[1:44:20] read
[1:44:21] the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
[1:44:24] his name but to do good and to
[1:44:27] communicate forget not for with such
[1:44:30] sacrifices God is well pleased so we
[1:44:33] offer with the fruit of our lips the
[1:44:36] sacrifice of praise you know it's got to
[1:44:39] come from your lips that's what the song
[1:44:41] service is about that's what you know
[1:44:44] repeating the scriptures out loud
[1:44:46] together that's what it's about you know
[1:44:48] we can read the word in silence we can
[1:44:50] you memorize it but it's another
[1:44:52] experience when you speak it out how
[1:44:55] many's ever read the word of God out
[1:44:57] loud to yourself the Bible says faith
[1:45:00] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:45:03] word and it might be you that you're
[1:45:05] hearing hearing yourself read the word
[1:45:08] faith cometh by hearing and the just
[1:45:12] shall live by what and we walk by what
[1:45:16] and not by sight we the just live by Fai
[1:45:20] faith we actually walk by faith and not
[1:45:23] by sight brother bam says in wisdom
[1:45:26] versus Faith he said that a true seed of
[1:45:28] the word cannot grow in the atmosphere
[1:45:31] of wisdom worldly wisdom it takes the
[1:45:35] atmosphere of faith for that word to
[1:45:38] work in that life and brother the
[1:45:41] prophet of God says in the hidden life
[1:45:42] in Christ speaking of this scripture
[1:45:44] Hebrews 13 and Heath made us priests and
[1:45:48] Kings unto God spiritual priesthood a
[1:45:51] royal Nation spiritual offering what is
[1:45:54] it now spiritual sacrifices that is
[1:45:58] quoting the scripture that is the fruits
[1:46:00] of our lips giving praise to his name
[1:46:04] now what kind of a what a spiritual
[1:46:08] sacrifice now now we might as well get
[1:46:10] started right here notice a good place
[1:46:13] to start from this is in the message of
[1:46:15] hidden life
[1:46:16] 1955 paragraph
[1:46:18] 81 spiritual priest Hood Royal Nation
[1:46:22] spiritual offering what is it now
[1:46:25] spiritual sacrifices that is quoting the
[1:46:29] scripture that is the fruits of our lips
[1:46:31] giving praise to his
[1:46:34] name now what kind of a what spiritual
[1:46:37] sacrifice now we might as well get
[1:46:40] started right here notice a good place
[1:46:42] to start from when a little confusion
[1:46:45] comes in the church you don't run over
[1:46:48] to one side and pout now if you are you
[1:46:52] sure ain't a priest see you pray through
[1:46:56] spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our
[1:46:59] lips giving praise to his name see what
[1:47:02] I mean well you say I just don't feel
[1:47:04] like going to church but you're a priest
[1:47:07] it's your duty you've got to be there
[1:47:11] well I just don't feel like taking part
[1:47:13] in the service you're a priest making a
[1:47:16] sacrifice a spiritual sacrifice not
[1:47:19] giving somebody some hand me down as
[1:47:21] they call it today that's all good I
[1:47:23] have nothing against it not going to get
[1:47:26] somebody to come to church that's all
[1:47:28] good I have nothing against it but it's
[1:47:30] you you making the spiritual sacrifice
[1:47:34] the fruits of your lips giving praise to
[1:47:37] his
[1:47:38] name now those are the fruits of your
[1:47:41] lips now the fruits of your lips lips
[1:47:44] that sacrifice is that praise that you
[1:47:47] didn't want to really give it's the
[1:47:50] harder praise to give it's the tired
[1:47:53] praise it's a help it's to help me wake
[1:47:56] up praise it's I you know ain't nobody
[1:47:59] else singing I can't sing praise it's
[1:48:02] the praise that you give to him it's a
[1:48:05] sacrifice yes it hurts yes it takes
[1:48:09] effort yes but what are you what are you
[1:48:12] doing when you do that you're offering a
[1:48:15] sacrifice and every offering every
[1:48:18] sacrifice is a seed that God consume and
[1:48:21] there's a benefit that comes with every
[1:48:23] offering amen it will not return void
[1:48:27] you put your time in with the Lord it
[1:48:29] will not return
[1:48:31] void and we offer those
[1:48:33] sacrifices the sacrifice of praise the
[1:48:36] fruits of our lips now there's also the
[1:48:39] fruits of
[1:48:40] righteousness we read this in 2
[1:48:42] Corinthians 9 for you I'll take it and
[1:48:46] it says that he which Seth sparingly
[1:48:48] shall reap also sparingly
[1:48:51] and he which sth bountifully shall reap
[1:48:53] also bountifully every man according as
[1:48:56] he purpose in his heart so let him give
[1:48:59] not grudgingly or of necessity for God
[1:49:04] loveth a cheerful Giver that's the
[1:49:07] scripture 2 Corinthians 9 you know that
[1:49:09] word cheerful means God loves a
[1:49:12] hilarious is that word means
[1:49:15] hilariously it's like a hilariously
[1:49:18] cheerful Giver you look the word up God
[1:49:21] loveth a cheerful Giver it's
[1:49:25] hilarious and God is able to make all
[1:49:27] grace abound towards you that you all
[1:49:30] always having sufficiency in all things
[1:49:34] may abound to every good work as it is
[1:49:36] written he hath dispersed abroad he ha
[1:49:39] given to the poor his righteousness
[1:49:42] remaining forever now he that Minister
[1:49:45] seed to the sore both Minister bread for
[1:49:48] your food and multiply your seed seone
[1:49:52] and do
[1:49:54] what increase what the fruits of your
[1:49:59] righteousness and that's what we want as
[1:50:02] Believers we want our righteousness to
[1:50:04] be increased that the life that we live
[1:50:08] the benefits the word of God that we're
[1:50:10] planed in our life we want that to
[1:50:12] increase in all spiritual matters says
[1:50:16] it again in Philippians 1: 9-1 and this
[1:50:20] I pray that you love your love may
[1:50:22] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[1:50:25] and in all judgment that you may approve
[1:50:28] the things that are excellent that you
[1:50:31] may be sincere and without offense until
[1:50:33] the day of Christ being filled with the
[1:50:36] fruits of righteousness which are by
[1:50:39] Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise
[1:50:42] of God how many of us here want to have
[1:50:45] our fruits of righteousness to be filled
[1:50:49] we want that to be be filled those are
[1:50:51] fruits of righteousness so the Lord uses
[1:50:55] this example of seeds of harvest of
[1:50:59] fruits of seeds sown of seeds increase
[1:51:03] he uses those examples all through his
[1:51:05] word he uses it as we apply our time as
[1:51:09] we apply our our resources our finances
[1:51:12] as we apply our life our gifts he
[1:51:15] increases that to those that sow that
[1:51:19] seed
[1:51:20] and the most important one is that your
[1:51:22] seed that the fruit you increase the
[1:51:24] fruits of your righteousness let's look
[1:51:26] at Hebrews chapter 12 and verse number
[1:51:29] five and let's look at this just for a
[1:51:31] moment at this process on how this fruit
[1:51:35] can be yielded because we believe the
[1:51:39] seed of the word is planted in good
[1:51:40] ground and the proof that it's planted
[1:51:43] in good ground is that it will it'll
[1:51:45] understand it it'll bear fruit and it'll
[1:51:47] bring forth fruit Hebrews
[1:51:52] 12
[1:51:57] 5 and verse 11 for whom the Lord loveth
[1:52:00] he
[1:52:01] chastise and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:52:05] receiveth if you endure chastening God
[1:52:07] dealth with you as with sons for what
[1:52:10] son is whom the father chasteneth not
[1:52:14] but if you be without chastisement
[1:52:16] whereof all are partakers then are you
[1:52:18] bastards and not Sons furthermore we
[1:52:21] have had fathers of our flesh which
[1:52:24] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[1:52:27] shall we not much rather be in
[1:52:28] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:52:31] and live for they verily for a few days
[1:52:35] chasten us after their own pleasure but
[1:52:38] he for our profit that we might be
[1:52:41] partakers of his Holiness now no chesing
[1:52:44] for the present seeth to be joyous but
[1:52:49] Grievious
[1:52:50] nevertheless afterwards it does what it
[1:52:54] yielded the Peaceable fruits of
[1:52:57] righteousness unto them which are
[1:52:59] exercised thereby now we want these
[1:53:02] fruits of righteousness but one process
[1:53:05] is that you have to come through the
[1:53:07] correction and many Believers and many
[1:53:10] people don't want to be in a place where
[1:53:12] they can receive correction they can't
[1:53:15] be corrected it's hard to be correct it
[1:53:17] doesn't feel good to be corrected but
[1:53:20] correction is part of the package it's
[1:53:23] part of the growth it's called
[1:53:25] pruning and the correction is how many
[1:53:28] know that we all need
[1:53:30] correction well write out what you need
[1:53:32] to be corrected on that's another step
[1:53:35] isn't it we we all say well nobody's
[1:53:38] perfect sure I need correction okay show
[1:53:40] me what you need to be corrected
[1:53:42] on that's a real issue it's not just a
[1:53:46] by word though nobody's perfect yeah we
[1:53:47] know nobody's perfect we got that
[1:53:50] nobody's perfect we all need to be
[1:53:52] corrected now what do you need to be
[1:53:54] corrected on well wait wait wait wait if
[1:53:58] it's going to be corrected I'm going to
[1:53:59] do I'm going to correct
[1:54:01] myself
[1:54:04] please the word does the
[1:54:07] correcting this is not no selfcheck it's
[1:54:10] not an honor System you're going to let
[1:54:13] yourself get by you squeeze by you
[1:54:17] change the rules won't you you expand
[1:54:20] the deadlines if you but but the word
[1:54:23] does the testing the word does the
[1:54:25] correcting and what we want we want the
[1:54:28] word of God to correct us so that our
[1:54:31] life will produce a righteous
[1:54:35] seed seeds of
[1:54:39] righteousness now this planting of the
[1:54:41] seed and the speaking the spoken word
[1:54:45] and speaking things that are positive
[1:54:48] these are all these are all laws that
[1:54:50] God has they're all part of his word but
[1:54:54] we have to play by the rules and we have
[1:54:57] to stay with the word in order for the
[1:55:00] benefits of the word to take its place
[1:55:02] and have root in our
[1:55:05] life
[1:55:06] amen and so if you got a negative seed
[1:55:11] you want to get rid of those and you
[1:55:13] want to plant a positive seed you start
[1:55:16] by picking up your Bible you start
[1:55:19] reading those promises out of the word
[1:55:23] you start reading that word and you
[1:55:24] start planting those seeds in your life
[1:55:27] you made a mistake we all do if you done
[1:55:29] things that you done that was wrong
[1:55:31] we've all done those then you got to go
[1:55:34] make those right and then what you got
[1:55:36] to move forward you just got to keep
[1:55:38] going on and once God forgives you you
[1:55:41] got to move forward and you can't let
[1:55:44] the Enemy Bring up your past what you
[1:55:47] did that was wrong if you made made it
[1:55:49] right with the Lord you can't you will
[1:55:53] you will incriminate yourself you'll die
[1:55:55] yourself you have to take what God's
[1:55:58] word says about forgiveness amen and
[1:56:02] placing it under the blood and we do
[1:56:04] that by faith we do that in spite of
[1:56:06] ourselves in spite of how negative we
[1:56:09] might think of ourselves we got to take
[1:56:10] God's word on it and God's word says He
[1:56:13] is faithful and just to forgive you of
[1:56:16] your sins confess your faults one to
[1:56:20] another and he will he will he'll
[1:56:22] forgive you he's faithful to forgive you
[1:56:24] amen of your sins and then you have to
[1:56:27] move forward look at the scripture in um
[1:56:32] James chapter 3 vers 13 and
[1:56:37] 18 the upper verses is talking about who
[1:56:39] can tame a Man's Tongue how little it is
[1:56:43] but it turns the ship it controls the
[1:56:46] horse the little member called the
[1:56:49] tongue
[1:56:50] no man can tame it it's a
[1:56:53] fireball sets things on hell of course
[1:56:57] you can take sharp words and destroy a
[1:57:00] the confidence of a young man or young
[1:57:02] woman and you can take those same words
[1:57:05] and build up a little life and build
[1:57:08] them up and encourage them because death
[1:57:11] and life lays in the power of the tongue
[1:57:13] and that tongue has the power to speak
[1:57:16] blessings and it has the power to speak
[1:57:20] curses and we want to be on the blessing
[1:57:23] side amen we want our mouth our lips to
[1:57:27] speak on the Blessed side say what God's
[1:57:30] word says let me ask you a question in
[1:57:33] the light of the world would would you
[1:57:36] consider brother bram's message positive
[1:57:40] or
[1:57:43] negative in light of the world what do
[1:57:45] you think the world would say about
[1:57:47] brother Brandon's message just take the
[1:57:50] titles 1965 1964 just start taking them
[1:57:55] some of those
[1:57:56] titles and you get into some of those
[1:57:58] statements and it sounds like it's
[1:58:00] negative negative negative sounds very
[1:58:02] hard but we know that that's the seed of
[1:58:06] the word of God it can't be
[1:58:08] negative it's
[1:58:11] positive but when it's cutting us and
[1:58:14] it's chastising us is for the purpose
[1:58:17] that it will yield forth fruits of
[1:58:20] righteousness now look at the message
[1:58:22] churches here in this city and across
[1:58:24] the the the the US those of you that
[1:58:27] have travel for the most part pretty
[1:58:30] decent
[1:58:31] assemblies pretty decent uh uh the way
[1:58:34] we handle ourselves the women the way
[1:58:36] they dress typically the way they
[1:58:38] conduct the church service you travel
[1:58:40] from the west or the east or whatever
[1:58:42] most of the message churches have a
[1:58:45] certain order and a decency about them
[1:58:48] why because there was a seed of the word
[1:58:50] that was planted it was planted in one
[1:58:54] it was in an aggressive atmosphere
[1:58:56] denominational they invited him just for
[1:58:58] the money they wanted the crowds but he
[1:59:01] preached the the pure word of God but
[1:59:04] now that word now found a resting place
[1:59:08] and look what it produced how many in
[1:59:11] here has never saw brother vam or metam
[1:59:13] raise your
[1:59:14] hand 90% of the congregation how many
[1:59:17] here has saw brother Bram or met him one
[1:59:20] two just a couple yeah sister there two
[1:59:23] or three so most of the congregation is
[1:59:26] is is made up of people who's never even
[1:59:28] met the Reverend William brandham but we
[1:59:32] came in contact with the seed of the
[1:59:35] word and the seed of the word produced a
[1:59:39] clean church a clean man a clean woman
[1:59:45] standards yes protocols principles
[1:59:50] that we stand on amen that's because the
[1:59:53] seed was planted in in faithfulness and
[1:59:57] it was a faithful seed and the word will
[1:59:59] not return
[2:00:00] void but look at this in James it says
[2:00:03] who is a wise man and endued with
[2:00:06] knowledge among
[2:00:08] you if you got it you can turn there
[2:00:10] James
[2:00:12] 3:13 read it out of your own Bible or
[2:00:15] they might put it on the screen for you
[2:00:17] to help you out who is a wise man any do
[2:00:20] with knowledge among you let him show
[2:00:23] out of a
[2:00:25] what
[2:00:27] huh a good conversation or a bad
[2:00:31] one a good conversation his works with
[2:00:36] meekness of
[2:00:38] wisdom but if you have bitter envy and
[2:00:40] strife in your hearts Glory not lie not
[2:00:43] against the truth this wisdom descendeth
[2:00:46] not from above but is Earthly sensual
[2:00:48] devilish for where envy and strife is
[2:00:51] there is confusion in every evil work
[2:00:54] but the wisdom that is from above is
[2:00:57] first
[2:00:58] pure then
[2:01:01] Peaceable then gentle and easy to be
[2:01:03] entreated full of mercy and good fruits
[2:01:07] without partiality and without
[2:01:10] hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness
[2:01:13] is sown in peace unto them that what
[2:01:20] that make peace we're talking about the
[2:01:22] children of God Sons and Daughters of
[2:01:24] God the fruits of
[2:01:27] righteousness we want our fruits to
[2:01:31] increase this is the danger of
[2:01:35] gossiping now there's a difference
[2:01:37] between you know there's information and
[2:01:39] things that need to be said or need to
[2:01:40] be told all right we need to hear some
[2:01:44] things that are going on we have to hear
[2:01:46] that that's different than what God
[2:01:49] gossip is want to give you the
[2:01:50] definition of Gossip real quick how many
[2:01:53] want it you already know what it is
[2:01:56] don't you but let me read it for you all
[2:01:58] right somebody said keep going I
[2:02:00] will casual or unconstrained
[2:02:05] conversation reports about other people
[2:02:08] typically involving details that are not
[2:02:12] confirmed as being
[2:02:14] true you know what I heard I don't know
[2:02:18] but I heard
[2:02:20] heard did you hear the
[2:02:23] tapes then tell us that you heard that
[2:02:26] too didn't you tell us what the tape
[2:02:29] said but it ain't it the tapes ain't
[2:02:31] juicy
[2:02:33] enough I heard about brother bonsa I
[2:02:37] heard something about you brother bonsa
[2:02:39] I'm not going to tell you but I'm going
[2:02:41] to tell Brothers over there what I heard
[2:02:43] about you come on I haven't talked to
[2:02:46] you I haven't confirmed it with you
[2:02:49] I don't have the proof whether it's
[2:02:50] right or wrong but I heard it and now
[2:02:54] I'm going to use my lips careful now to
[2:02:59] speak something that I don't even know
[2:03:01] if it's true or
[2:03:03] not not
[2:03:05] valuable we use our lips to speak
[2:03:08] righteous things things that are
[2:03:10] confirmed in his word a person who
[2:03:13] habitually reveals personal or
[2:03:16] Sensational facts about others
[2:03:19] gossiper rumor or report of intimate
[2:03:25] nature Sensational facts about others
[2:03:31] gossip just be honest how many of you
[2:03:33] have ever been guilty of gossiping
[2:03:36] right I didn't say raise your hand but
[2:03:38] you
[2:03:39] did you're the honest
[2:03:42] on
[2:03:44] Gossip it you want to be the first to
[2:03:47] tell it even it's not confirmed yet but
[2:03:49] before it's confirmed you want to be the
[2:03:50] first to tell it it's gossip and and and
[2:03:53] it and it and it's working it's working
[2:03:55] to your own detriment you're planting
[2:03:58] the seed now you're spreading something
[2:04:00] that's negative and Satan is using your
[2:04:03] lips to do it by but God gave us his
[2:04:06] word that we can speak and that's true
[2:04:09] it's something that we heard yet the
[2:04:11] same and it has all the power in it to
[2:04:14] change a circumstance death and life lay
[2:04:17] in the power of the tongue
[2:04:19] you speak those things that are true and
[2:04:22] you stay steady and steadfast with those
[2:04:24] things that are true so we plant those
[2:04:26] seeds don't we and we thank God for them
[2:04:29] now the atmosphere is so important can I
[2:04:32] take 10 more minutes
[2:04:33] yes in the message in the message modern
[2:04:37] the Oddball he's talking about the
[2:04:39] atmosphere and I'm going show you how
[2:04:41] important this atmosphere is speaking of
[2:04:45] the outside elements that's against the
[2:04:47] seed and the enemy himself self that's
[2:04:49] against the sea the atmosphere and I
[2:04:51] certainly I say amen I walked out the
[2:04:54] door I
[2:04:55] say it would pay me every Sunday to
[2:04:58] drive up here or have my children even
[2:05:01] to come to sit under an atmosphere like
[2:05:04] this because it's always the atmosphere
[2:05:07] that brings the
[2:05:08] results you can lay a seed out there in
[2:05:11] the ground no matter how much that seed
[2:05:13] is gerti and lay it there it's got to
[2:05:16] have an atmosphere to make it live amen
[2:05:19] that sun has to come to a certain power
[2:05:22] before bring it to a certain atmosphere
[2:05:25] an egg has to have an atmosphere or it
[2:05:27] won't hatch no matter how fertile it is
[2:05:30] it's got to have that
[2:05:33] atmosphere modern events made clear by
[2:05:36] prophecy
[2:05:37] 65 uh December of 1965 he says this here
[2:05:41] in paragraph 46 now the Bible is a
[2:05:44] different book from any other sacred
[2:05:45] book there's no book like the Bible
[2:05:48] because the Bible is God in word form a
[2:05:53] word is a thought expressed God's
[2:05:55] thinking expressed it his words through
[2:05:58] the prophets and they wrote the Bible
[2:06:00] which is the word
[2:06:02] form which is in word form and Jesus
[2:06:05] called it a seed and any seed will bring
[2:06:07] forth of its kind in the right condition
[2:06:09] the right atmosphere now this book this
[2:06:12] book of Prophecy is for telling future
[2:06:16] events now the book contains the entire
[2:06:19] revelation of Jesus Christ you don't add
[2:06:21] to it or take from it every Revelation
[2:06:24] must come by it see it must be the word
[2:06:28] so he says it comes through the right
[2:06:31] condition and any it it will bring forth
[2:06:33] if it's in the right condition and that
[2:06:36] right condition is the right
[2:06:39] atmosphere we want to make sure that we
[2:06:42] are receiving the word in the right
[2:06:45] atmosphere that we're hearing it in the
[2:06:47] right atmosphere we're keeping it in the
[2:06:50] right atmosphere and you want to be with
[2:06:52] people that align themselves up with the
[2:06:55] word of God that you
[2:06:56] believe there's a quote where brother
[2:06:58] bandam says if it's against God's word
[2:07:02] you be against
[2:07:04] it another place it says if it's against
[2:07:07] God's word that is your
[2:07:09] enemy and that enemy is to come and take
[2:07:14] what God has sold into your
[2:07:17] heart so the understanding is by the
[2:07:21] wayside the Stony places they had no
[2:07:24] root the Thorns are the cares of the
[2:07:27] world and these all these
[2:07:30] atmosphere hinder the growth in the the
[2:07:33] moving of this seed to coming to
[2:07:36] maturity the good ground is he that
[2:07:38] understandeth and beareth fruit now you
[2:07:41] can ask God to give you an understanding
[2:07:44] you can you can pray and ask God to open
[2:07:47] my understanding Lord Lord are these
[2:07:49] words show me what I need to see out of
[2:07:52] this word open it up to me because we
[2:07:55] don't understand all of the seals it
[2:07:57] doesn't mean we don't listen to him we
[2:07:58] listen to him because there's Parts in
[2:08:00] there that we'll understand and he opens
[2:08:02] up more of it to us as the days go by
[2:08:06] amen and we thank God for
[2:08:09] it and so we know that God's word is a
[2:08:14] seed we know that there's an atmosphere
[2:08:17] that's at that's adverse to that seed
[2:08:20] it's a hostile environment sometimes
[2:08:22] it's our own atmosphere that's causing
[2:08:24] it and in Matthew Chapter 13 it says
[2:08:28] that Jesus who was the son of God he
[2:08:30] could not do many mighty Works in this
[2:08:34] place because of their
[2:08:37] unbelief he had Mighty works that he
[2:08:40] could do but he could not do these
[2:08:43] Mighty works because of their unbelief
[2:08:45] their atmosphere wasn't right we want a
[2:08:48] church that has the right atmosphere
[2:08:50] what if every what if every believer in
[2:08:53] here were to fall down on their knees
[2:08:56] and pray to God for a move of God in our
[2:08:59] little church and to help us and to help
[2:09:02] us to grow every believer was to do that
[2:09:04] and not critical and not looking around
[2:09:06] and not wondering why what if every
[2:09:09] believer did that do you think God would
[2:09:11] answer that prayer you think it would
[2:09:13] make a difference well essentially
[2:09:16] that's what we've been commanded to do
[2:09:17] when we come into the house of the Lord
[2:09:20] the Believers to come prayed up looking
[2:09:22] for God to do what he said he would do
[2:09:24] in this word he said I will be there in
[2:09:27] their midst where two or three would be
[2:09:29] gathered in his name and so we want to
[2:09:31] see that take place in our lives so we
[2:09:34] see that we become the word as we
[2:09:37] receive that word we then become the
[2:09:39] seed itself we see that in these
[2:09:43] Parables 1 Peter 5:6 say he will exalt
[2:09:47] you and do time in due season the
[2:09:50] exaltation will come and in the message
[2:09:53] perfect faith brother bam makes this
[2:09:55] statement here paragraph 93 said Jesus
[2:09:58] had perfect Faith he had it and it come
[2:10:01] because he was the word and you become
[2:10:04] the word you become the word as you
[2:10:07] receive the word if you abide in me and
[2:10:10] my words in you my words this word
[2:10:13] abides in you um then ask what you will
[2:10:17] and it'll be done for you see if you say
[2:10:20] to this mountain be moved and don't
[2:10:22] doubt but believe what you said then you
[2:10:24] shall have what you said when you pray
[2:10:28] believe that you receive what you asked
[2:10:30] for and you shall have it it'll be given
[2:10:33] to you time space nothing else has will
[2:10:37] ever change it you know it's done it's
[2:10:39] already it's already over with so you
[2:10:42] become the word as you receive the
[2:10:46] word can I take this a little bit
[2:10:49] further as my last place here to go here
[2:10:53] is in Leviticus chapter
[2:10:57] 25 this is the Lord giving promises to
[2:11:02] Israel the Hebrews coming out of
[2:11:06] bondage he's going to establish
[2:11:08] them he's going to cause them to
[2:11:11] grow and he caused them to grow by
[2:11:14] increasing the fertility of the womb
[2:11:18] he's going to grow a nation through the
[2:11:22] birth by increasing their
[2:11:25] fertility by taking away diseases making
[2:11:29] them strong and healthy that the family
[2:11:32] would grow through birth after birth
[2:11:35] after birth 10 kids 15 children Jacob
[2:11:39] had how many Abraham had how many he's
[2:11:42] going to he's going to raise up a nation
[2:11:45] through the birth and causing them to
[2:11:48] grow through the seed of the
[2:11:51] womb and this is the increase so God
[2:11:54] gives you this increase but here in
[2:11:57] Leviticus chapter
[2:11:59] 26 it says if you walk in my statutes
[2:12:02] and keep my Commandments and do them
[2:12:05] verse
[2:12:07] three then I will give you rain in due
[2:12:10] season and the land shall yield her
[2:12:13] increase and the Trees of the field
[2:12:15] shall yield their in their fruit and
[2:12:18] your threshing shall reach unto the Ving
[2:12:21] vintage and the Vintage shall reach unto
[2:12:23] the sewing time so it's showing that
[2:12:25] that your Harvest Time and your reaping
[2:12:28] time and your sewing time they're kind
[2:12:30] of overlap you'll be so blessed your
[2:12:32] Fields will just overlap in reaping and
[2:12:35] sewing that's what it's saying there and
[2:12:37] your threshing shall reach unto the
[2:12:39] Vintage and the Vintage shall reach unto
[2:12:41] the sewing time and you shall eat your
[2:12:43] bread to the full dwell in the land and
[2:12:46] I'll give peace in the land and you
[2:12:47] shall lie down and none shall make you
[2:12:50] afraid so it deals with the fear aspect
[2:12:54] and I will rid the evil Beast out of the
[2:12:56] land neither shall the sword go through
[2:12:58] your land and ye shall Chase your
[2:13:00] enemies and they shall fall Before You
[2:13:03] by The Sword so you're not running from
[2:13:05] them they're running from you five of
[2:13:08] you shall chase a hundred and aund of
[2:13:11] you shall put 10,000 to a flight and
[2:13:15] your enemies shall fall Before You by
[2:13:17] the sword for I will have respect unto
[2:13:21] you and make you fruitful and multiply
[2:13:25] you and establish my Covenant with you
[2:13:28] and you shall eat the old store and
[2:13:30] bring forth the old because of the new
[2:13:32] and I will set my Tabernacle among you
[2:13:36] and my soul shall not abore you or hate
[2:13:39] you and I will walk among you and will
[2:13:43] be your God and you shall be my people I
[2:13:46] am the Lord your God which brought you
[2:13:48] forth out of the land now what is this
[2:13:50] all based on this is all based on if you
[2:13:53] walk in my statutes and keep my
[2:13:57] Commandments and you do them I'll take
[2:14:01] the fear your fear for other nations
[2:14:04] I'll take that away from you I'll make
[2:14:06] five of you the equivalent of a thousand
[2:14:09] men and one of you the equivalent of 100
[2:14:13] one of you can chase a thousand one of
[2:14:16] you will chase a 100 and five of you
[2:14:18] will put a thousand to a
[2:14:20] flight five of you shall chase a 100 and
[2:14:23] a 100 of you shall put 10,000 to a
[2:14:25] flight what the scripture says so he's
[2:14:27] going to walk among you I'll be your God
[2:14:30] and you shall be my people but if you
[2:14:33] will not hearken unto me verse
[2:14:35] 14 and will not do these
[2:14:39] Commandments he says you'll sow your
[2:14:43] seed in
[2:14:45] vain verse 20 and your strength shall be
[2:14:49] spent in
[2:14:50] vain like people spinning their
[2:14:53] wheels it's like people thinking they're
[2:14:56] catching up on a little time because you
[2:14:59] know they're not going to go to service
[2:15:00] on Sunday or whenever the service time
[2:15:03] is they won't go because they got to
[2:15:04] catch up on all the busy tasks that they
[2:15:06] have from the work from the job that the
[2:15:09] lord gave them and they're so busy they
[2:15:11] can't come to church and they can't put
[2:15:13] their time in the things of the Lord so
[2:15:15] they need to they need their own me time
[2:15:18] so they have to carve out their me time
[2:15:20] okay all y'all can me I can't be there
[2:15:21] with you guys I'm part of you but I
[2:15:23] can't I need to conserve my own time but
[2:15:26] then you're like spinning your
[2:15:28] wheels you leave early and then you get
[2:15:31] stuck in
[2:15:33] traffic or you try to take uh uh off the
[2:15:36] time from that the Lord has called you
[2:15:38] now I'm not talking about every time but
[2:15:40] I'm think I'm talking about your
[2:15:41] responsibilities as a Believer he calls
[2:15:44] you to a responsibility and you try to
[2:15:46] cut that in half and think you're going
[2:15:48] to save on catching up on some sleep or
[2:15:51] catching up on some rest or some time
[2:15:54] all of that is in God's hands did you
[2:15:55] know
[2:15:56] that time is in God's hands how many of
[2:16:00] you have ever ever been doing something
[2:16:03] for the Lord and it's
[2:16:05] like he increases your time like it's
[2:16:09] 9:00 and you're supposed to be 9:30 in
[2:16:11] your mind only five minutes pass you're
[2:16:14] like thank you Lord I needed more time
[2:16:17] and then other times it's like you think
[2:16:19] you've been only sitting around for an
[2:16:20] hour it's been three
[2:16:22] hours it's in it's in God's hands this
[2:16:25] time and when and when you don't uh keep
[2:16:29] his Commandments or walk in his statutes
[2:16:31] he said your strength will be spent in
[2:16:34] vain you're spinning your wheels burning
[2:16:36] a lot of gas but you ain't going nowhere
[2:16:38] spinning your wheels spinning your
[2:16:39] wheels spinning your wheels and you
[2:16:40] think you're catching up on your
[2:16:44] personal business time or whatever you
[2:16:46] whatever you're doing or you think that
[2:16:48] maybe you know that's too much for the
[2:16:51] kids to serve the Lord like that or you
[2:16:53] don't want to you know that sacrifice
[2:16:55] you don't want to give that you don't
[2:16:56] want to give that you know whatever you
[2:16:58] give you're not going to lose anything
[2:16:59] if you're giving it to the Lord right
[2:17:02] you're not you can't you can't and this
[2:17:06] principle is what you know the enemy has
[2:17:09] tried to put that upon us today and we
[2:17:12] want to serve God like he's in second or
[2:17:15] third place when actually he should be
[2:17:18] first placed right am as a Believer we
[2:17:21] put God first in all things look at what
[2:17:25] he'll do when you walk in his statues he
[2:17:28] says I will increase the rain over your
[2:17:33] land now who's in charge of a
[2:17:37] famine who can make it rain or make it
[2:17:39] stop raining who's in control of that
[2:17:42] huh God is who is in control of making a
[2:17:45] seed multiply 30 60 or 100 fold who's in
[2:17:50] control of that now science can try and
[2:17:54] other groups can try but God is in
[2:17:56] control of multiplying the seed amen who
[2:18:01] can take the fear from
[2:18:05] you that's
[2:18:07] God he's in control of that he said I
[2:18:10] will make you that you won't fear the
[2:18:12] other nations and he gives you the
[2:18:14] strength and the power to actually be
[2:18:16] able to Chase your enemies instead of
[2:18:19] your enemies chasing you these
[2:18:22] principles were established in the Old
[2:18:24] Testament under the levitical laws that
[2:18:27] if you do this and if you do this I got
[2:18:30] your rain covered and the rain's going
[2:18:32] to condition your land and your land
[2:18:34] will be real fertile and when you go
[2:18:36] plant the seed you'll get 30 60 you get
[2:18:38] 100 fold and when your mom and your dad
[2:18:41] get together they'll have those children
[2:18:42] they won't have these diseases they
[2:18:44] won't have all these stresses they won't
[2:18:46] have all these fears and all these
[2:18:48] problems because you kept my precepts in
[2:18:50] my word yes sir when you put God first
[2:18:53] you're planting the right seed in the
[2:18:55] right place at the right time and God
[2:18:58] will bring it to pass God's word is a
[2:19:01] seed we want to plant it we want to keep
[2:19:03] it in the right atmosphere we have the
[2:19:05] fruits of our lips and the fruits of
[2:19:09] righteousness that comes with it amen
[2:19:12] one last place in the scriptures and
[2:19:15] we'll close with this is in James
[2:19:16] chapter 5
[2:19:28] verses number
[2:19:32] seven look what it says verse James
[2:19:36] chapter 5: 7 says if you have it say

[2:20:01] coming of the Lord draw it

[2:20:30] richly you have need of patience after
