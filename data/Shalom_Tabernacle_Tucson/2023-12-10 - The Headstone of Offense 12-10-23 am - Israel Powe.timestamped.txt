[2:14] brother Brenham the church being caught
[2:17] up with those who are asleep Bene the
[2:19] Lord in the air and the rest of the
[2:21] church is carried over into the
[2:22] tribulation period they make nothing
[2:25] else out of it
[2:26] myself Enoch raptured no death
[2:31] now uh let's start studying a little now
[2:34] get down to L ice keep on that we never
[2:36] will get into the the
[2:38] seal now
[2:40] notice let's take now because we're
[2:42] going to have along maybe tomorrow night
[2:44] or next night get a trumpet now and then
[2:46] because the trumpet sounds at the same
[2:48] time the seals is just the same thing
[2:49] the church age opens just the same thing
[2:52] now a trumpet always denotes war or
[2:58] otherwise political
[3:02] disturbance the trumpet does a political
[3:05] disturbance and that causes
[3:08] War when you go to get mess in politics
[3:11] and get them all messed up like we got
[3:14] it
[3:16] now look
[3:20] out war is at
[3:22] hand but see the kingdom still belongs
[3:25] to Satan he still got this part in his
[3:28] hand because why
[3:30] it is Redeemed by Christ but he's doing
[3:33] the part of the kinsman redeemer taking
[3:36] his subject until the last one name is
[3:38] put on that book has already received it
[3:40] and been sealed away now you got it then
[3:44] he comes from his throne his father's
[3:46] Throne walks
[3:49] forward takes the book out of God's hand
[3:52] from the throne and claims his rights
[3:56] the first thing he does is call for his
[3:58] bride he amen then what does he take he
[4:02] takes his opponent Satan and binds him
[4:05] and cast him into the fire out there
[4:07] with all
[4:08] follow now remember it wasn't
[4:12] Russia no the Antichrist is a smooth
[4:15] fell just watch how smooth he is he's
[4:18] smart yes sir just take the Holy Spirit
[4:20] going in can out do him notice trumpets
[4:25] means political disturbance Wars Matthew
[4:29] 24 Jesus spoke of he said you'll hear of
[4:31] wars and rumors of War see all the way
[4:35] down through you remember this Jesus
[4:38] speaking that Wars rumors and wars and
[4:41] rumors and wars and come on down to the
[4:43] end now that's a trumpet sounding now
[4:45] when we get on the trumpets we'll go
[4:47] back there and pick up each one of them
[4:48] Wars and show you that they follow them
[4:51] churches show you they follow these
[4:54] seals wars and rumors of War but trumpet
[4:58] denotes political disturbance or as
[5:04] seals deals with the religious
[5:08] distur see a seal is open a message is
[5:13] dropped and then the church is always so
[5:17] set up in its own political ways and
[5:20] whatever more and all of its dignitary
[5:23] and when that real message drops down
[5:26] that messenger Goes Forth and he shakes
[5:29] into
[5:30] Jesus that's right it's religious
[5:33] disturbance when a seals open that's
[5:36] what's
[5:39] happened yes they get all at ease and Z
[5:43] the church gets all settled down and we
[5:45] got it all made just like the Church of
[5:47] England there all settled down the
[5:49] Catholic Church all settled down and
[5:50] longc come
[5:51] Luther there's religious distur yes sir
[5:55] sure was well the church went on office
[5:58] swingly and from swingly come on down to
[6:01] different ones and the Calvin and after
[6:03] while the angland church settle down and
[6:05] it was just at ease long C Wesley that
[6:09] was a religious
[6:10] disturbance right see it always denotes
[6:13] a religious disturb now the seal let's
[6:17] just read it a little bit now I want
[6:21] to get this this read it I get Talking
[6:25] of and I saw when the lamb open open one
[6:30] of the
[6:32] seals what happened and I heard is it
[6:35] was a noise of a
[6:38] thunder oh how I'd like to dwell on that

[6:46] are waiting for the consolation of the
[6:48] Lord will now study real close and on
[6:52] the tapes also that you'll think of this

[9:59] it was in a symbol when John saw it it
[10:03] was still a mystery why it wasn't even

[11:55] amen and only is to be revealed at the
[11:57] last day when this actual seal is
[12:00] broken broken to who not to Christ but
[12:03] to the

[13:03] as Christians that God swore to David
[13:08] that he would raise up Christ to set on
[13:10] his throne and give him an everlasting
[13:13] kingdom here on the
[13:15] earth he did it and Jesus said he that

[15:49] subjects that's what he come forth from
[15:52] the throne to do it is then that the
[15:56] line like creature said to John come
[16:01] see what are you reading it one of the
[16:05] seal and it as if it was a noise of a
[16:09] thunder and one of the four Beast you
[16:11] know what the beasts were we tucked in
[16:13] one like a line one like a calf and one
[16:16] like a man and one like an eagle now
[16:19] this first Beast said watch each time is
[16:22] a different Beast so them four horse
[16:24] riders pass there four beast and this
[16:28] four har Rider notice each one of them
[16:31] Feast announced Matthew M Mark luk and
[16:33] John we're going to get back in and
[16:35] prove which one Matthew Mark which one
[16:36] Mark which one John each one as they
[16:40] went hello one out the Beast saying come
[16:45] see he heard the noise of the Thunder
[16:47] and one of the Beast said now come see
[16:49] in other words I hear stand the lamb and
[16:53] John stand out there watching it happen
[16:55] the lamb come up from the throne like
[16:59] had been slaying blood over him he was
[17:01] the one that was found worthy and when
[17:03] he reached over and Tuck the book then
[17:06] everything begin to shou and screaming
[17:08] and carrying on you see because they
[17:09] know Redemption was paid for now he's
[17:13] come to claim his own so he takes the
[17:15] bat stands out there before John and he
[17:18] pulls it back and breaks the seal amen
[17:21] pulls the seal down and when he pulls
[17:23] the seal down a thunder clack to the
[17:26] place and when a thunder
[17:28] no doubt John might have jumped up in
[17:31] the air when a thunder roared and then
[17:34] one of the four Beast said now come see
[17:37] what it is what's revealed beneath here
[17:42] oh John WR what you see so John goes to
[17:47] look see what it was John goes to see
[17:51] what the Thunder said it's then that
[17:54] this creature told John come see what
[17:58] what the mystery is under the first
[18:01] seal the Thunder the voice of the
[18:04] creator has uttered
[18:07] it he ought to know what's
[18:11] there
[18:12] oh but think now he wrote this but when
[18:17] he started to write those other seven
[18:19] Thunders he said don't write it he'd
[18:21] been commissioned to write everything he
[18:23] seen But when these seven Thunders over
[18:25] in Revelations 10 uttered he said don't
[18:27] write them at all amen there are
[18:29] Mysteries we don't know what they are
[18:31] yet but my opinion they'll be revealed
[18:33] right away and when it do it'll get
[18:36] Faith for that Rapture and Grace for
[18:38] that church
[18:40] Mo we've just moved through everything
[18:42] that we know of through all the
[18:43] dispensations we've watched everything
[18:45] we've seen the mysteries of God we've
[18:46] seen the appearing of the of the great
[18:50] Gathering Together of the Bride in the
[18:51] last days but yet there's something in
[18:54] there that we just can't lighten ourself
[18:55] with there's something other but I
[18:57] imagine when that m my begins to come
[18:59] forth God said hold it back now wait
[19:01] minute I'll reveal it in that day don't
[19:02] ride at all John because it stagger over
[19:04] it just let's Let It Go but I'll reveal
[19:07] it in that day when it has even they
[19:09] never uttered for nothing no you
[19:11] remember like the little drop of ink
[19:12] everything is for a purpose everything
[19:15] were things for a cause but notice the
[19:18] Creator uttered and he uh he heard this
[19:22] voice and he went to see but now the
[19:26] lamb is showing John in the the symbol
[19:29] of of U of uh Church scripture like for
[19:34] the church know what to right just show
[19:38] now don't don't tell this just what it
[19:39] is don't go down John and say now this
[19:41] is just what this is now what's under
[19:43] this seven seal don't don't go down and
[19:45] tell that for if I tell John that then
[19:48] all down through the age the whole
[19:49] planet will be broke it's a
[19:51] secret he just wants he coming he said
[19:55] nobody's going to know when I'm coming
[19:56] I'm just coming that's all it ain't for
[19:59] my business no when I just to be ready
[20:01] you see so then he said now John went
[20:04] forth he thought I'm going to see it now
[20:06] and what did he do when John went forth
[20:09] he now what's he got to do now he's got
[20:11] to write this to the church
[20:14] age that's what he's supposed to do
[20:16] write it to the church
[20:18] agent right what you see of these seven
[20:20] golden candlesticks at the beginning
[20:22] write to this church and tell them all
[20:24] right and the Thunder went off John knew
[20:28] the voice of God and then the the
[20:30] lionlike creature said come see what it
[20:33] was John went forth now with his P to
[20:37] write what he was going to see now he
[20:39] never seen exactly what it was he never
[20:42] understood it but what he saw was what
[20:45] God was sending to the church for a
[20:48] time now he's got he will he always does
[20:53] he makes it plain when it's time to make
[20:55] it
[20:56] clean but he didn't make it plain then
[20:59] why because he's going to keep it a
[21:01] secret until the last age and the
[21:03] sounding of the last Angel's message was
[21:06] to get up these
[21:08] [Applause]
[21:10] Min make it clear but what John saw he
[21:13] just you know White Horse go out with a
[21:15] rider on it so that's what he wrote down
[21:18] when he did that's what he said come see
[21:20] so John went to see what he could see to
[21:21] ride to the church and when he did he
[21:23] saw a wine horse and him that sat on it
[21:25] had a bow and he went forth C
[21:28] to conquer and there was given to him a
[21:30] crown and that that's all John saw so he
[21:32] just WR that down now see that's in
[21:35] symol that's the way the church has
[21:37] received it but with the promise and at
[21:40] the last day he'
[21:43] reveal so what it is God help us to
[21:47] understand yes Lord Church agent but is
[21:51] not made fully known till the seventh
[21:55] message of the last Church age
[21:58] notice he
[22:02] starts this messenger of the seventh
[22:06] Church age if you'll notice it he
[22:08] doesn't start a denomination like the
[22:11] rest of them
[22:12] did you is he doesn't start no if you'll
[22:16] find out he's against it amen Was Elijah
[22:20] Was Elijah against it sure he was was
[22:23] John against it with Elijah's Spirit
[22:25] what kind of a spirit did Elijah have on
[22:27] him he was nobody knows much about him
[22:30] he just a man but he was a prophet he
[22:33] was hated my and what time did he rise
[22:36] right in the time of the popularity of
[22:39] Israel when it all went worldly and he
[22:41] got her out there and he was a woman
[22:44] hater sure was and he loved the
[22:47] Wilderness that was his nature and then
[22:50] people ought to know when that fell come
[22:53] out there with that same Spirit on
[22:56] him come out there this John not dressed
[23:00] all up like the

[23:11] man what was he he loved the Wilderness
[23:15] another thing he done he hated
[23:17] denomination he said now don't you begin
[23:20] to say we belong to this or that for I
[23:23] tell you God's able to e Stones rise

[1:07:28] brother Caleb and he's a very unique
[1:07:30] brother very special and uh when he was
[1:07:35] a single man I I know it was my prayer I

[1:08:14] young children to him that he should
[1:08:17] touch them and his disciples rebuked
[1:08:20] those that brought them but when Jesus
[1:08:22] saw it he was much
[1:08:24] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[1:08:27] little children to come unto me and
[1:08:29] forbid them not for such is the kingdom
[1:08:32] of God verily I say unto you whosoever
[1:08:36] shall not receive the kingdom of God as
[1:08:38] a little child he shall not enter
[1:08:41] therein and he took them up in his arms
[1:08:45] put his hands upon them and bless
[1:08:50] them brother brandom says in the message
[1:08:54] God keeps his word he says now the Lord
[1:08:56] has given to you this little this lovely
[1:09:00] little one and now you are dedicating it
[1:09:03] to him putting it in his arms that God

[1:11:23] moment
[1:11:24] all right you know babies do what babies
[1:11:30] do and I'll leave it right there all
[1:11:32] right so if you'll stand and take your
[1:11:35] Bible and turn in the
[1:11:38] scripture in Romans chapter
[1:11:48] 9 praise the
[1:11:51] Lord and in 1 Peter chapter chapter 2
[1:11:54] and we'll take a scripture in Matthew 21
[1:11:56] Romans chapter 9 and verse is right
[1:12:01] towards the end
[1:12:03] there in verse
[1:12:08] 29 and Isaiah said before except the
[1:12:12] Lord of Sabbath hath left us a seed we
[1:12:16] had been as Sodom and been made like
[1:12:19] unto gomorah what shall we say then that
[1:12:22] the Gentiles which followed not after
[1:12:25] righteousness have attained to
[1:12:28] righteousness even the righteousness
[1:12:31] which is of Faith but Israel which
[1:12:33] followed after the law of
[1:12:36] righteousness hath not attained to the
[1:12:38] law of
[1:12:39] righteousness wherefore because they
[1:12:41] sought it not by faith but as it were by
[1:12:45] The Works of the law for they stumbled
[1:12:48] at The Stumbling Stone as it is written
[1:12:51] behold I lay in Zion
[1:12:53] a stumbling Stone a rock of offence and
[1:12:57] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:13:01] ashamed amen 1 Peter chapter
[1:13:22] 2
[1:13:25] verse number one wherefore laying aside
[1:13:28] all malice all guile all hypocrisies
[1:13:32] enves and all evil speakings talking
[1:13:36] about that mortar we been talking about
[1:13:39] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:13:42] of the word that you may grow thereby if
[1:13:46] so be you have tasted that the Lord is
[1:13:49] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[1:13:52] Stone disallowed indeed of men but
[1:13:55] chosen of God and precious ye also as
[1:14:00] Lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:14:03] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:14:07] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:14:10] by Jesus Christ wherefore also is
[1:14:14] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[1:14:17] in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[1:14:22] precious precious and he that believeth
[1:14:25] on him shall not be
[1:14:29] confounded amen we thank the Lord for
[1:14:32] his word one more scripture in the new
[1:14:35] uh in the uh under the gospels Matthew
[1:14:37] chapter
[1:14:38] 21 our lord Jesus
[1:14:52] speaking
[1:14:54] verse
[1:14:58] 42 Jesus said unto them did you never
[1:15:01] read in the scriptures the stone which
[1:15:03] the builders rejected the same is become
[1:15:07] the head of the corner this is the
[1:15:09] Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our
[1:15:13] eyes therefore say I unto you the
[1:15:16] kingdom of God shall be taken from you
[1:15:19] talking to the Jews and given to a
[1:15:22] nation bring bringing forth the fruits
[1:15:25] thereof and whosoever shall fall on this
[1:15:29] Stone shall be broken but whomsoever it
[1:15:32] shall fall it will grind him to powder
[1:15:37] amen The Headstone of offense is the
[1:15:40] title of the message this morning The
[1:15:42] Headstone of offense let's pray Lord
[1:15:46] Jesus we ask your blessings on your word
[1:15:49] this morning I pray you'll bless your
[1:15:51] people in a very special way way Lord
[1:15:54] move us out of the way and may you have
[1:15:58] your way as we pray remember the
[1:16:01] Brethren our friends and Phoenix Lord
[1:16:04] for the art and the families there all
[1:16:08] the visitors that are gathered here
[1:16:09] today and even our young people the
[1:16:12] youngest one Among Us may you grant
[1:16:14] blessings to each one we pray in Jesus
[1:16:17] name amen God bless you you may be
[1:16:20] seated I see sister Maggie is here from
[1:16:23] Sacramento she's becoming a regular amen
[1:16:26] God bless you Sister Maggie sorry to
[1:16:28] hear about your brother we'll be praying
[1:16:30] for for him he passed on right so we'll
[1:16:33] keep him in prayer I know she was had
[1:16:35] been witnessing to him every time she
[1:16:38] comes here she's an old friend from
[1:16:41] Sacramento amen the Sacramento church
[1:16:43] and so headstone of offense and all of
[1:16:48] our other visitors we greet you our
[1:16:50] folks from Alaska and our different
[1:16:52] friends and it's good to see Josh back
[1:16:54] from his trip he made it back safely and
[1:16:57] each of you we trust the Lord will bless
[1:16:59] you um it's true the me the meeting on
[1:17:04] on Friday night was I thought it was
[1:17:06] success it was a good meeting for the
[1:17:08] Youth I think Levi did a wonderful job
[1:17:11] there speaking to them um and so I trust
[1:17:16] that uh someone's heart was encouraged
[1:17:19] and I was definitely was encouraged by
[1:17:22] some of the I heard and said there one
[1:17:24] of the points I I heard that Levi made
[1:17:27] it was it stood out to me was the
[1:17:30] difference between a decision and a
[1:17:32] commitment because your decisions can
[1:17:35] change you can decide and undecide but
[1:17:37] when you're committed to something and
[1:17:39] that's a bit stronger bit deeper and I
[1:17:42] enjoyed that and so we'll just pray the
[1:17:44] Lord will continue to strengthen him and
[1:17:47] um but this morning this headstone of
[1:17:50] offense actually we have been talking on
[1:17:53] the those messages the stature of a
[1:17:55] perfect man and this Great Pyramid the
[1:17:58] house that we're building and that this
[1:18:01] pyramid is a actually a uh witness of
[1:18:07] history The Church History it's a uh
[1:18:10] really a picture of who you are becoming
[1:18:14] those virtues are the virtues of Jesus
[1:18:16] Christ and as The Headstone nears and
[1:18:19] comes together there is a Unity that
[1:18:22] takes place that moves the funny things
[1:18:26] out from be in between the two stones so
[1:18:31] that the two actually become one and
[1:18:34] these are more than two stones there are
[1:18:36] seven stones that make this pyramid and
[1:18:39] then it's capped with Divine love and
[1:18:43] we've all been enjoying that have we we
[1:18:46] we think of we think of our life and how
[1:18:48] we can let that there would be no
[1:18:51] division in the body no schisms in the
[1:18:54] body but it's interesting in Matthew 21
[1:18:57] how Jesus said that the the the the
[1:19:01] kingdom of God will be taken from you
[1:19:03] and given to
[1:19:05] another and in First Peter that we read
[1:19:08] there the rock of offense he says that
[1:19:11] the Gentiles who were not a people are
[1:19:15] now a people of God and so we see this
[1:19:19] inheritance as we've seen it and we've
[1:19:22] talked about it
[1:19:23] how God has through the cross swapped
[1:19:27] the blessings from the Jews and put them
[1:19:30] on the Gentiles under this great
[1:19:34] salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ it
[1:19:37] was at the cross that this took place
[1:19:39] and so now we were not a people of God
[1:19:42] but now we are the people of God this is
[1:19:45] the season for it but that door is
[1:19:48] closing and we are in the day of the
[1:19:50] closing of the Gentile door
[1:19:53] where it goes back to the Jews again
[1:19:55] because they are his people let's be
[1:19:58] clear of that all the fighting going on
[1:20:00] over there we know who's going to win
[1:20:02] amen and we know there will be no peace
[1:20:05] no matter how many talks who votes in
[1:20:08] who who argues what there will be no
[1:20:11] peace until the headstone of Peace the
[1:20:15] Lord Jesus Christ comes down in there
[1:20:19] and fixes all those problems they'll
[1:20:21] argue they'll fight they've been
[1:20:22] fighting since I was a kid it's been in
[1:20:24] the news and it's been in news all of
[1:20:26] our life how many you know that's true
[1:20:29] it's always an uprising somebody who
[1:20:31] started it who whatever uh we know there
[1:20:34] will be no peace but we pray for the
[1:20:37] Peace of Jerusalem we pray for them we
[1:20:40] look at them their time piece they're a
[1:20:43] watch and it kind of tells us what's
[1:20:46] going on Amen and so we know that this
[1:20:50] uh Rock of offense Jes Jesus said that I
[1:20:55] am going to take this word and it's
[1:20:57] going to you you'll be replaced by
[1:20:59] another so let's take our and focus our
[1:21:03] attention a little bit on this uh lot
[1:21:08] that God has has given to us and I'm
[1:21:11] going to I'm going to I want you to take
[1:21:13] this lot for example as the time that's
[1:21:18] been given to you your space your time
[1:21:21] in life and and let me just clarify it
[1:21:24] just a moment uh today's group of people
[1:21:28] that's following the message there has
[1:21:31] never been a people to this close to the
[1:21:34] coming of the Lord like the people today
[1:21:37] right now another generation can take
[1:21:40] that claim later but now we can say
[1:21:44] there's never been a PE a people on the
[1:21:47] Earth that has followed the word that
[1:21:50] has followed the Lord that has been this
[1:21:52] close to the coming of the Lord I want
[1:21:55] that to sober you also I want you to to
[1:21:59] bear in mind when we say the message and
[1:22:02] what we're talking about how brother bam
[1:22:04] admonished us to study the message in
[1:22:07] the Statue of a perfect man he said take
[1:22:09] it and study it and compare it and then
[1:22:13] act upon it is that what he said that's
[1:22:16] what he said and let's be real clear
[1:22:19] them in
[1:22:20] 1962 acting upon on that as far as study
[1:22:24] is going to be different than us acting
[1:22:27] upon it and studying because we have
[1:22:29] more word I we have the word that's been
[1:22:33] um it's we can compare it we can
[1:22:36] highlight portions of the message we
[1:22:38] actually know how long the tape is going
[1:22:40] to be we can fast forward it and as I
[1:22:45] said some of you would want to fast
[1:22:46] forward me but you
[1:22:48] can't uh but you know after the message
[1:22:51] has been preached preach we can sit
[1:22:53] there and know how long this tape is
[1:22:55] know where the prayer line is know where
[1:22:57] need start the scripture reading who
[1:22:59] else was able to handle the message that
[1:23:01] way so when he talked to the people and
[1:23:03] says study it and compare it how about
[1:23:07] putting your life of study next to their
[1:23:10] life of study and I don't think um it's
[1:23:14] Apples to Apples in
[1:23:17] comparison we have been given the
[1:23:19] message in a format that we can study it
[1:23:23] now and we can compare it now it used to
[1:23:27] be brother Joe when I came into the
[1:23:29] message in order for me to study the
[1:23:31] statue of a perfect man first I had to
[1:23:33] get the tape all right and then if I
[1:23:36] wanted to compare it to Blasphemous
[1:23:38] names I had to get that tape but for
[1:23:41] example Caleb took it out from the
[1:23:43] church library so I have to wait till
[1:23:45] Caleb returns it back to the church
[1:23:47] library then I can get it and if he
[1:23:51] don't return it on time I got to wait
[1:23:54] another week I live through those times
[1:23:57] where wanting to hear a message was
[1:23:59] waiting constant waiting number one
[1:24:02] number
[1:24:03] two US listening to the message today
[1:24:07] then you can have the tape but guess
[1:24:09] what else you
[1:24:11] needed a tape recorder thank you so if
[1:24:15] your tape recorder ain't working in your
[1:24:17] car if you don't want to have one at
[1:24:20] home guess what you ain't listening to
[1:24:22] nothing
[1:24:23] you got the tape in your hand but it's a
[1:24:25] two component process that has been
[1:24:31] eliminated now we have the
[1:24:35] message
[1:24:38] instantly and I believe we're going to
[1:24:39] be held accountable not only that I
[1:24:42] believe we will be blessed because of it
[1:24:45] and we are blessed because of it if we
[1:24:47] can look at it that way so we've seen
[1:24:50] this change right before our eyes amen
[1:24:53] amen that's just technology that's just
[1:24:56] time and if time continues what more
[1:24:58] would we have before even in the last
[1:25:01] five years we'd say eight years how many
[1:25:04] were able to come to a church and
[1:25:06] actually see the quotes on the screen as
[1:25:10] it's being preached to you that happened
[1:25:12] right before your
[1:25:14] eyes and so these these are some of the
[1:25:17] points that is
[1:25:20] accelerating our time
[1:25:23] this is highlighting our our our lot in
[1:25:27] history okay and so our spot in history
[1:25:31] I cannot go back and refer to what
[1:25:35] pastors did 20 years
[1:25:38] ago I can't go back to that I look as a
[1:25:41] as an example I can glean from it the
[1:25:44] the Stepping Stones the mistakes and I
[1:25:46] can glean from it but my example is this
[1:25:50] word today present can I get a witness
[1:25:54] all right so let's go into the message
[1:25:57] uh turn on the light and brother Bram
[1:26:00] says this here this is just a little bit
[1:26:03] of a background and we'll go a bit
[1:26:06] further into this message paragraph 104
[1:26:09] he says that's when 103 sorry like my
[1:26:12] hand here in a shadow it's a shadow only
[1:26:15] it's darker as my hand becomes more it's
[1:26:19] a negative here a positive here as a
[1:26:22] negative and positive gets denser darker
[1:26:24] darker darker and finally it claps
[1:26:28] together and negative and positive
[1:26:30] become one that's when church and Christ
[1:26:34] unites together as a bride with the same
[1:26:37] spirit that was in him will be upon her
[1:26:42] when the church comes from justification
[1:26:44] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:48] into the last
[1:26:50] days this is
[1:26:53] 1964 their last days ain't Our Last Days
[1:26:57] these are the last days right into the
[1:27:01] last days and honing her down now for
[1:27:04] the coming of the Lord oh don't be the
[1:27:07] rough part on it Pentecostal brother
[1:27:10] shine up with the word and believe every
[1:27:12] bit of it don't get out into these isms
[1:27:16] and things as we see going on today
[1:27:19] don't be astonished at that because the
[1:27:21] head Stone is coming crying ABA father
[1:27:26] pretty soon my God my God yes I believe
[1:27:30] that with all my heart do you see it you
[1:27:33] know what I mean it's Christ now taking
[1:27:35] the rags of yesterday the Lutheran
[1:27:38] Methodist Presbyterian and so forth and
[1:27:40] he's putting it through a process what
[1:27:44] kind of a process a process of the Holy
[1:27:48] Spirit what they had Plus making it till
[1:27:53] he is pressing his own image when the
[1:27:56] church and Christ become one in Union
[1:28:01] God granted so what was it was what they
[1:28:05] had
[1:28:07] plus do you have the
[1:28:11] plus the generations what they had
[1:28:16] plus do you think the other Generations
[1:28:18] would have loved to have access to the
[1:28:20] entire message
[1:28:23] I'm talking about in the seventh age I'm
[1:28:24] talking about
[1:28:25] 1966 on to the today do you think 1966
[1:28:30] preachers would have
[1:28:32] enjoyed the the freedoms of being able
[1:28:35] to search the message the way we enjoy
[1:28:37] them today do you let's be for real yes
[1:28:42] it's a beautiful Freedom so we have what
[1:28:45] they had plus what are the pluses well
[1:28:48] you can fill in the blanks what the
[1:28:50] pluses are the pluses are are instant
[1:28:53] access the pluses are a more
[1:28:56] comprehensive study the pluses are I can
[1:28:59] compare where he said this statement
[1:29:01] once and then twice and then three or
[1:29:03] four or five times those are some of the
[1:29:06] pluses and what are the what does that
[1:29:08] do for me as a minister as a as a
[1:29:12] Christian believer what it does for me
[1:29:15] it puts me up closer to what brother
[1:29:18] bradam was saying we know he preached
[1:29:21] things that is own congregation did not
[1:29:23] understand we know he preached Mysteries
[1:29:26] and he refer to dreams that the
[1:29:28] congregation didn't hear the dream yet
[1:29:30] because they didn't hear the tape yet
[1:29:33] but now we're caught up to that now
[1:29:36] because we're hearing what he said all
[1:29:39] the way through the
[1:29:40] message I want to highlight the value of
[1:29:43] that I want you to see that that is a a
[1:29:46] unique place in history for the believer
[1:29:52] right and I want you to see that if they
[1:29:54] live holy without all of the search menu
[1:29:58] then how should we be living with all of
[1:30:01] the search
[1:30:03] menu look at the pictures of the sisters
[1:30:06] back then and then look at the sisters
[1:30:08] of the pictures today something ain't
[1:30:11] right we know more yes we can argue more
[1:30:15] yes but there's a difference something
[1:30:19] has changed what has happened
[1:30:22] does God words change no it didn't
[1:30:26] change it's still the same
[1:30:29] word but it makes us more responsible
[1:30:32] doesn't
[1:30:33] it amen so now it shows us that we are
[1:30:39] at uh what they had plus the generation
[1:30:43] before us plus let's skip forward and
[1:30:46] turn on the light and he says this here
[1:30:48] in paragraph number 109 so ought the
[1:30:51] Church of of Pentecost
[1:30:53] today asking who is Jesus Christ the
[1:30:56] same yesterday today and forever his
[1:30:59] light of his gospel ought to be shining
[1:31:02] forth with the word of this age
[1:31:04] revealing Jesus Christ to the nation
[1:31:07] just like it was then he was so filled
[1:31:10] with the wsh Revival till he was the wsh
[1:31:13] Revival we ought to be so filled with
[1:31:16] Christ until we reflect him in the power
[1:31:19] of His word that's lock it to us to this
[1:31:27] day so brothers and sisters we have a
[1:31:30] portion of the word that has been
[1:31:32] allotted to us please don't sleep on
[1:31:35] that please don't let that pass you by
[1:31:39] please don't ignore brother bram's
[1:31:42] admonition to study compare and add it
[1:31:45] to your life he said that and he said
[1:31:49] that to his congregation and his
[1:31:52] congregation I believe will obey him
[1:31:55] right and so the obedience is uh doing
[1:31:59] what he said to do if you believe me you
[1:32:02] keep my Commandments many people said
[1:32:04] brother Brandon we believe you're the
[1:32:06] prophet but they don't believe what he
[1:32:07] they won't do what he said do huh so the
[1:32:10] evidence in believing he's the prophet
[1:32:13] is to do what he said do now when he was
[1:32:17] talking to study it compare it and then
[1:32:19] apply it to your life was he just
[1:32:21] talking to the
[1:32:23] pastors was he just talking to the men
[1:32:26] no was he just talking to those that are
[1:32:29] in their 30s or 40s or was that for the
[1:32:33] young people too was that for a new
[1:32:36] church an old
[1:32:37] church a a church that's being
[1:32:40] established a church that's coming in
[1:32:42] the in its fullness of of perfection
[1:32:46] that's to all of us that is hearing the
[1:32:48] word and what was the message title the
[1:32:52] stature of a perfect man God's Building
[1:32:57] house that quo is meaning more to me
[1:32:59] than ever before and I hope and trust it
[1:33:02] means more to
[1:33:04] you paragraph 112 in turn on the light
[1:33:06] he
[1:33:07] says remember this is the seventh Church
[1:33:11] age the leodan church age according to
[1:33:13] Revelations 3 they reject Christ of
[1:33:17] every Church age that was mentioned in
[1:33:18] the Bible the Leo Dean age was the worst
[1:33:22] of all of them that's our age that we're
[1:33:24] in it turned him out rejected him put
[1:33:27] him on the outside did you see the Moon
[1:33:30] black out the other night before the
[1:33:32] pope went to Rome Rome to Jerusalem
[1:33:36] Jerusalem the oldest church the Moon is
[1:33:38] a type of the church always reflecting
[1:33:41] the light of the Sun in the absence of
[1:33:43] the sun and it blacked out I draw out
[1:33:47] that on the Blackboard here three or
[1:33:48] four years ago and show the churches
[1:33:50] hundreds and thousands of homes Across
[1:33:53] the Nation what was it a shadow the
[1:33:56] first time a pope ever left to come back
[1:33:59] here come in the name of Paul and so
[1:34:01] forth went down through those places had
[1:34:04] to bless the River to cross it and so
[1:34:06] forth what does the river need
[1:34:09] blessing what's what's the matter with
[1:34:13] this church age that we're living in
[1:34:15] today what would he say if he saw the
[1:34:17] churches
[1:34:18] today what's the matter with the church
[1:34:20] age that we're living in today can't you
[1:34:22] see
[1:34:24] it God declaring it in the skies
[1:34:28] declaring it in his word declaring it on
[1:34:31] paper declaring it amongst the people
[1:34:34] can't you open your eyes and see the
[1:34:38] hour these are they that Testify the
[1:34:42] truth this is the light of the hour what
[1:34:46] the great economical move is going into
[1:34:49] this Council up there now just for an
[1:34:51] image of the beast in Revelation 17
[1:34:55] exactly what it said it would do you
[1:34:57] Pentecostal people going to sit still
[1:35:00] for that and go into it the forcing hour
[1:35:06] has come now is the time to rise and
[1:35:09] trim your lamps and shine with the
[1:35:12] Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power as
[1:35:17] we heard on Sunday night amen is that
[1:35:20] right
[1:35:22] now is the time to rise and trim your
[1:35:27] lamps so why do people reject this Stone
[1:35:32] that's clearly been
[1:35:35] identified and I want to I just want to
[1:35:37] bring out a couple of ways that people
[1:35:41] uh will reject uh the stone or reject
[1:35:44] the word or the Revelation one way that
[1:35:47] they reject it is a very outward ver
[1:35:51] verbal rejection they'll tell you I
[1:35:54] don't believe it I don't see it that's
[1:35:58] incorrect I don't accept it it's very
[1:36:02] outward it's a matter of fact it's very
[1:36:04] clear but there's another way that we
[1:36:07] reject it and this is the more subtle
[1:36:09] way it's hard to identify it it's a way
[1:36:13] that many people can still maintain
[1:36:15] their Christian position and and
[1:36:19] composure but yet they're still still
[1:36:21] rejecting it through their actions this
[1:36:25] is a nonverbal rejection this is a
[1:36:28] rejection I don't know if you're getting
[1:36:30] it or not but your actions finally show
[1:36:32] us oh he's not getting it
[1:36:35] right right this is a subtle rejection
[1:36:39] and this rejection is um uh many times
[1:36:43] it's caused because we're uh we we we
[1:36:46] don't understand or we haven't been told
[1:36:49] more information as to what is being
[1:36:53] told us um
[1:36:55] this th this this rejection this quiet
[1:37:00] rejection it's in the heart it's in the
[1:37:03] spirit it's in the mind where we've
[1:37:06] heard the answer we saw it there we got
[1:37:10] next to the ark I sympathize with Noah I
[1:37:12] know he's a man of God I believe what
[1:37:14] he's saying is true but these are the
[1:37:16] people that came up close to the ark but
[1:37:19] they rejected it maybe not verbally but
[1:37:22] their actions prove because there is
[1:37:25] only eight of them in the
[1:37:26] ark and so when we look at the age of
[1:37:30] Noah the entire age rejected Noah now
[1:37:34] did the entire age write a letter of
[1:37:37] resignation no did they all publicly
[1:37:40] stand up and criticize Noah but by
[1:37:43] virtue of them not going into the ark
[1:37:46] they rejected it amen it's a subtle
[1:37:50] rejection
[1:37:52] it's a
[1:37:54] non-commitment it's a non-changing of
[1:37:56] your
[1:37:58] ways
[1:38:00] okay we see these two
[1:38:02] rejections and I believe we all
[1:38:04] understand what I'm saying
[1:38:07] right it's hearing the light seeing the
[1:38:10] light but not walking in it now brother
[1:38:14] random deals with this
[1:38:18] uh the
[1:38:20] teaching
[1:38:22] and he tells us
[1:38:24] in and I read this on on on Wednesday
[1:38:28] I'll read it again about Hebrews chapter
[1:38:31] 5 and there are some great tremendous
[1:38:35] truths that are in the message like like
[1:38:39] on the tape we're hearing for Sunday
[1:38:40] school
[1:38:41] tremendous quotes tremendous statements
[1:38:45] Let's Take One For example that I read
[1:38:47] for you on Wednesday night what about
[1:38:48] the dream of brother Billy Paul okay the
[1:38:51] dream of brother Billy Paul that brother
[1:38:52] Ram said came from the Lord look what it
[1:38:55] had in that dream just analyze it just a
[1:38:58] little bit now I'm not a prophet I can't
[1:39:01] interpret dreams but many times a dream
[1:39:05] gives you enough information to know
[1:39:07] that it's a warning and you might not be
[1:39:10] able to put it on the Blackboard and
[1:39:11] explain it all but there's enough
[1:39:14] details to know that somebody's in
[1:39:16] trouble or possibly or somebody needs to
[1:39:20] get their act together and that's what
[1:39:22] that dream did if you you you heard me
[1:39:25] read it for you is that right on
[1:39:27] Wednesday some of you did not I admonish
[1:39:29] you to hear that dream I think I let me
[1:39:33] give you a reference of where it is I
[1:39:35] had it here somewhere maybe later pardon
[1:39:42] me my I hate when I do
[1:39:49] that going to tell sister since you're
[1:39:51] walking in the back go get those quotes
[1:39:52] for me but let me see here but it it was
[1:39:56] in the dream there
[1:40:00] um probably on my desk brother Trevor
[1:40:04] but
[1:40:05] let's thank
[1:40:07] you but in that dream look at the
[1:40:09] components that were in it you're all
[1:40:12] Parton me I just misplaced things all
[1:40:15] the time I'm sorry so have mercy for
[1:40:18] me yeah there's a man huh
[1:40:21] man who could turn on the light thank
[1:40:22] you and in that message brother brandom
[1:40:26] says that brother Billy pauler dreamed
[1:40:28] in the dream brother brandham had eyes
[1:40:30] of fire so if you just look that up in
[1:40:32] the word you'll see that that's
[1:40:34] Revelations 1 there's a judgment there
[1:40:39] not only that he gave us a component of
[1:40:41] the scriptures in Daniel chap 12 where
[1:40:44] there was a stone heun out of a mountain
[1:40:49] that that had no hands and brother
[1:40:52] brandom takes that scripture and brings
[1:40:55] it that it's going to smash all of the
[1:40:58] Gentile kingdoms remember Daniel's dream
[1:41:01] the head of gold the brass the silver
[1:41:03] and then at the feet was iron and clay
[1:41:06] and this Stone heun out of the mountain
[1:41:09] without hands smashes the feet and it
[1:41:12] grinds it all together and that was
[1:41:15] Christ smashing the Gentiles to the end
[1:41:18] time that's speaking of of of our day
[1:41:21] and our time maybe it's on a printer
[1:41:23] clevor
[1:41:27] Trevor he's a clever Trevor all right
[1:41:31] and and these these components are there
[1:41:36] pardon me I hate that it's there yeah
[1:41:40] but I I needed those quotes but in that
[1:41:43] dream those components were
[1:41:49] there amen thank you yes
[1:41:55] sir I need to invite you into my office
[1:41:58] a bit more and you just know how to help
[1:42:00] me thank you pe and brother brand
[1:42:04] talking about how his son has dreams
[1:42:06] very often I won't take time to read the
[1:42:07] dream I'd like you to read it and then
[1:42:09] later on in the message he brings it up
[1:42:11] again but look at those components
[1:42:13] there's a a Stone come out it smashes
[1:42:17] this image and we see that there was the
[1:42:20] the coming of the Lord there was a a
[1:42:23] Time factor that it's too late now it's
[1:42:27] over and here this dream now uh maybe
[1:42:31] not fully interpreted on every single
[1:42:35] level but it there's enough in that
[1:42:37] dream for me to know as Brother brandham
[1:42:40] related it he said Lois it's too late
[1:42:44] for her to come the children are too
[1:42:45] young now even if it's my own daughter
[1:42:48] they won can't get her to pray it was
[1:42:49] just it was just anxiousness and he says
[1:42:52] you had that time before you've already
[1:42:56] had that time to get ready and so we see
[1:42:59] that this that the that this these
[1:43:02] dreams and how God will
[1:43:05] reveal through the through the dream
[1:43:09] enough for us to to accept it now now
[1:43:14] who would not be interested in what that
[1:43:18] dream meant that dream meant right who
[1:43:22] after hearing that knowing that it was
[1:43:25] at the end time knowing it was brother
[1:43:28] bam being used in this portion to give
[1:43:31] the final hour that between now and
[1:43:35] midnight the Lord is
[1:43:37] coming that was the final hour saints
[1:43:40] that was the closing
[1:43:43] time and so it's enough for us to to
[1:43:47] make ready and to look further into that
[1:43:51] but as it
[1:43:52] is with many other truths like
[1:43:56] that strong statements like that there
[1:44:00] are some people they hear it and they're
[1:44:03] not interested in going deeper to find
[1:44:07] out what significance does it play in my
[1:44:12] life and there's a reason for that now
[1:44:16] in the message um Hebrews chapter 5
[1:44:20] brother is dealing with these uh those
[1:44:24] that are unskillful with the word and
[1:44:26] this is what he
[1:44:28] says he takes a scripture Hebrews
[1:44:31] chapter 5:3 he's reading from the 11th
[1:44:33] verse down he says therefore now the
[1:44:36] time you ought to be teachers you have
[1:44:38] need that one teach you again with the
[1:44:41] first principles of the Oracles of God
[1:44:43] and are become such as have need of milk
[1:44:46] instead of strong meat for everyone that
[1:44:49] uses milk milk is unskillful in the word
[1:44:52] of righteousness for he is a babe I hope
[1:44:56] the holy spirit is taking that right
[1:44:59] down in the bottom of you for he that
[1:45:02] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:45:05] righteousness for he's a baby you give a
[1:45:08] baby strong meat you kill it that's the
[1:45:11] reason so many people say I don't
[1:45:13] believe that and walk away steal
[1:45:18] babies they just can't understand
[1:45:21] listen to this they can't grasp that
[1:45:25] truth it kills them Great Mighty things
[1:45:29] the church should know today but you
[1:45:32] couldn't teach it they they they they
[1:45:35] stumble over it they don't know what to
[1:45:38] do with it and it actually it creates a
[1:45:42] fear some of these great great great
[1:45:46] truths that people stumble over and now
[1:45:50] it creates a fear where people are not
[1:45:51] even interested like let's take let's
[1:45:54] take a controversial one let's take the
[1:45:57] the the vision of the T Vision brother
[1:46:00] Bam's T Vision now no one has a right to
[1:46:04] that quote alone there's no group that
[1:46:07] can franchise that quote there is nobody
[1:46:11] no Ministry produced that quote who's
[1:46:13] the originator of the vision first
[1:46:17] that's the question who originated the
[1:46:19] vision God sent the
[1:46:22] vision so if God sent
[1:46:26] it why should I be afraid of it somebody
[1:46:30] help me preach this morning why should I
[1:46:32] be afraid of speaking in
[1:46:36] tongues why should I be afraid of
[1:46:39] somebody getting blessed in the Holy
[1:46:43] Ghost why should I be afraid of an
[1:46:46] oldfashioned alter
[1:46:49] call Lord
[1:46:52] L God sent the gifts God sent the
[1:46:56] message God sent the Visions God sent
[1:47:00] the
[1:47:03] anointing so something's happened
[1:47:05] between God sending it and you being
[1:47:08] afraid of it Something's Happened
[1:47:10] there come on
[1:47:13] somebody Great Mighty things the church
[1:47:15] should know today but you
[1:47:17] couldn't teach it so
[1:47:21] so this
[1:47:26] teaching let's get into some of the
[1:47:28] teaching what the teaching does here
[1:47:31] here what brother Bram says here in the
[1:47:34] message marriage and divorce all
[1:47:39] right paragraph 284 this is an awful
[1:47:42] strong thing I didn't know how to bring
[1:47:44] it out what will I do when I got men
[1:47:46] women sitting in my congregation some of
[1:47:49] them has been married twice or three
[1:47:52] times good men good women all mixed up
[1:47:56] what done
[1:47:57] it help me preach false false teaching
[1:48:01] exactly not waiting on the Lord so false
[1:48:08] teaching is
[1:48:11] Kryptonite it's a
[1:48:13] killer a false understanding a false
[1:48:18] representation a
[1:48:20] misrepresentation false teaching created
[1:48:24] the tremendous problem in marriage and
[1:48:29] divorce that the prophet had people in
[1:48:32] his own church people in his own family
[1:48:36] people that had this issue had this
[1:48:38] problem and it's a great one it's a one
[1:48:40] of the problems of the day it's still a
[1:48:43] problem
[1:48:44] today yes and what created it was false
[1:48:47] teaching but let me take the other side
[1:48:50] to false teaching what about
[1:48:55] non-teaching people who are not taught
[1:48:58] cuz cuz the admonition was to teach your
[1:49:03] children not to go this way so a false
[1:49:07] teacher is off the word and a
[1:49:10] non-teacher is ignorant of the word oh
[1:49:13] my so they're like related yes sir one
[1:49:16] don't know and one refuses to know or
[1:49:19] reject
[1:49:21] it and I don't want to be in any of the
[1:49:23] camps I don't want to be a false under a
[1:49:26] false teaching and I don't want to lay
[1:49:29] on a teaching that's in Zion yeah that
[1:49:32] he's given to the church and me not
[1:49:36] enjoy the blessings of knowing what he's
[1:49:39] talking
[1:49:41] about this is the reason that the Holy
[1:49:45] Ghost is caught in this great battle
[1:49:49] today is because of of the teaching it's
[1:49:51] not taught properly can I go a little
[1:49:54] further here brother bam says here in
[1:49:56] the imparable Sin think of it paragraph
[1:49:59] 33 think of it no fear that's the
[1:50:03] greatest plague there is in the
[1:50:05] Christian church today is
[1:50:09] afraid and the reason they're afraid
[1:50:12] tell us brother Brandon the reason
[1:50:15] they're afraid is because they're what
[1:50:18] not taught right
[1:50:22] oh
[1:50:25] oh so
[1:50:27] fear comes from not being taught right
[1:50:31] is that what he said the reason that
[1:50:33] they're afraid because they're not
[1:50:35] taught
[1:50:37] right God have mercy upon us that's good
[1:50:41] no reason at all why this little place
[1:50:43] here couldn't be a beehive of the power
[1:50:46] of God buzzing with the glory of God
[1:50:50] flying from everywhere this little old
[1:50:52] hole in the wall here almost is known
[1:50:55] throughout the entire world this little
[1:50:57] spot you're sitting in tonight because
[1:50:59] not of William brandom but because of
[1:51:01] Jesus Christ who did it so here brother
[1:51:05] brandom is talking about the reason that
[1:51:08] people are afraid is because they're not
[1:51:10] taught and who is he talking to what
[1:51:13] church is he visiting in he's actually
[1:51:15] in the brandom Tabernacle who's the
[1:51:17] pastor of brandom Tabernacle I think the
[1:51:20] title ought to give you the name that
[1:51:23] he's the pastor of the brandham
[1:51:25] Tabernacle here he is in the brandham
[1:51:28] Tabernacle telling the people on the
[1:51:30] recorded tape that the reason why the
[1:51:33] people are afraid is because they're not
[1:51:37] taught right so let's explore down that
[1:51:40] just a little
[1:51:43] bit in questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:51:47] number one paragraph 57 brother brandham
[1:51:51] tells us paragraph 51 questions and
[1:51:54] answers on Hebrews number one he says
[1:51:56] now remember the Holy Ghost was not
[1:52:00] taught as the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:04] until after World War
[1:52:08] I we just celebrated our golden jubilee
[1:52:12] 40 years or the 40th year of the Jubilee
[1:52:18] so isn't that interesting
[1:52:20] that it wasn't even taught in the
[1:52:22] churches till after the first world war
[1:52:25] and then is isn't it amazing now how
[1:52:28] it's being taught then you see people
[1:52:30] start receiving
[1:52:32] it because it's now made aware to the
[1:52:35] people now there's always been people
[1:52:37] throughout all the ages that have
[1:52:39] received it but as a group as a whole
[1:52:42] the people were ignorant to it okay and
[1:52:46] they were ignorant to the power of God
[1:52:49] and bless blessings of God is such as
[1:52:51] all of us were until we come in contact
[1:52:53] with the message and the message makes
[1:52:56] us aware of really what the power of God
[1:53:00] is and what the anointing of God is in
[1:53:03] this little detail that brother Rood
[1:53:06] would even show us right there even that
[1:53:09] the gifts uh don't have anything to do
[1:53:12] with whether you're even in the will of
[1:53:14] God or not that the anointing can fall
[1:53:17] on a church and people can prophesy and
[1:53:20] be used mightily under a gift and still
[1:53:23] be
[1:53:24] false I I I don't know how valuable you
[1:53:26] don't know that that that is but that's
[1:53:28] very valuable for years people have have
[1:53:32] given people the right thumb of approval
[1:53:34] because of a gift in their life and then
[1:53:37] bypass all the false teaching and the
[1:53:39] ill living that they're doing only
[1:53:42] because of a gift but because the angel
[1:53:45] has come in our day and revealed to us
[1:53:48] that truth we can now walk and know how
[1:53:51] to handle a Gifted Man or a gifted
[1:53:55] woman that don't stay with the word
[1:54:00] right a dream that's not with the word
[1:54:03] we know how to handle it don't we why
[1:54:06] because we've been taught
[1:54:08] that amen so the value of
[1:54:13] teaching it's it's just tremendous as
[1:54:17] the Lord teaches you and the rejected
[1:54:20] King 1960 brother bam says this here
[1:54:24] paragraph
[1:54:25] 45 if that taking place tonight in every
[1:54:28] Church in the United States there would
[1:54:30] be a Revival in this nation I'll tell
[1:54:33] you whiskey joints will be broke up it
[1:54:35] will be one of the most grandest things
[1:54:38] that this nation's ever know if every
[1:54:41] preacher of all denominations would just
[1:54:43] follow the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:46] and instead of some Creed or their
[1:54:48] denomination what some Bishop said or
[1:54:51] somebody else said somebody else said
[1:54:53] what somebody else said said has nothing
[1:54:57] to do into it God sent the Holy Spirit
[1:55:02] and he's our guide he's our leader but
[1:55:05] when they even see the Holy Spirit
[1:55:08] moving they get scared of it they don't
[1:55:11] know what it is it's a stranger to them
[1:55:15] because they're not taught in that
[1:55:18] line
[1:55:21] they're taught just Upon A Certain thing
[1:55:24] that the Church Believers believes and
[1:55:26] they go right like that and they go
[1:55:29] through life calling themselves
[1:55:31] Christians and go on with the things of
[1:55:34] the world and then when they come to die
[1:55:36] they say why my faith saves
[1:55:40] me so and
[1:55:43] people have their ideas about the
[1:55:46] dreams they have their ideas about God
[1:55:49] bless you little baggot God bless you
[1:55:51] idea about the dreams ideas about the
[1:55:55] gifts and they have these funny little
[1:55:57] feelings about uh you know what this is
[1:55:59] and that is it's because the way they're
[1:56:03] taught and if they're taught to embrace
[1:56:06] spiritual things they will be the
[1:56:10] benefactor benefactor of spiritual
[1:56:13] things like for example I'm so glad he
[1:56:16] did it he came down the Holy Spirit came
[1:56:18] down just before we came out in that
[1:56:21] last song how many felt that how many
[1:56:24] can see that the Holy Spirit was in that
[1:56:26] song he was in all the songs right he
[1:56:28] was in your prayer he was but this was a
[1:56:30] special anointing we all can sense it if
[1:56:34] you can't sense it that's you know God
[1:56:36] help you but most of us can sense that
[1:56:38] was the Holy Spirit he came past your
[1:56:42] Pew he came into your church he came
[1:56:46] into the song that you were singing but
[1:56:49] if you're not thought right you won't
[1:56:52] even lift your hands you won't embrace
[1:56:54] it you won't find out how God can feed
[1:56:58] you through that
[1:57:02] anointing Lord Teach Me How To Worship
[1:57:06] when you come into my church teach me
[1:57:09] how to praise you when you stop by my
[1:57:13] assembly glory to
[1:57:18] God Amen
[1:57:20] amen it's in the
[1:57:22] teaching you know the basketball game
[1:57:25] they get into the
[1:57:27] spirit the dancers they get into the
[1:57:30] spirit and they play another song and oh
[1:57:33] yeah that's my song and then the next
[1:57:35] song no that's really my song and then
[1:57:37] they start taking it get into the spirit
[1:57:40] and we come to church and think that the
[1:57:41] spirit is supposed to pick us up and
[1:57:45] force us to
[1:57:46] worship that's not a sacrifice of
[1:57:50] praise for a sacrifice of
[1:57:54] praise is thank you
[1:57:56] Lord for saving my
[1:57:59] soul thank you Lord for the word of
[1:58:05] God
[1:58:07] yes
[1:58:12] Hallelujah you got to be taught you got
[1:58:15] to be taught that and once it's taught
[1:58:18] to you you believe it then you will be
[1:58:22] the benefactor of
[1:58:25] it yes

[1:58:31] time I will wash your feet I will wash
[1:58:35] your dirty feet if you come to my church

[1:58:41] welcome I'll put a smile on my face I'll
[1:58:45] whip up my hands I'll make you feel
[1:58:48] welcome
[1:58:49] am amen praise the
[1:58:52] Lord
[1:58:56] hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:58:59] praise God can we go a little bit
[1:59:01] further you know what's interesting and
[1:59:04] people say well I worship the Lord if if
[1:59:06] I feel like it I'm just kind of just who
[1:59:08] I am I'm kind of quiet but you're not
[1:59:10] quiet in all areas of your
[1:59:13] life when you get excited we've seen you
[1:59:16] we've seen you
[1:59:18] excited so don't run that one on
[1:59:21] me like the one brother said excuse me
[1:59:24] if I say this brother juel forny he
[1:59:28] said said the White Brothers tell them
[1:59:31] you black folks worship that way because
[1:59:33] you're black he says no I seen the
[1:59:36] prices
[1:59:39] right when y'all win a new car your
[1:59:43] hands go up you're jumping you're
[1:59:46] shouting had nothing to do with colored
[1:59:48] in it's about what you excited about
[1:59:51] don't try to run that on
[1:59:53] me no
[1:59:55] sir try to run that
[2:00:00] one in the message blasphemist names can
[2:00:03] you say praise the
[2:00:05] Lord paragraph 91 brother bam says this
[2:00:08] here now I believe that the reason that
[2:00:11] there is so much confusion today about
[2:00:14] the Holy Spirit is not correctly taught
[2:00:20] I believe that the baptism is taught and
[2:00:23] just say the
[2:00:25] baptism but then be like you say
[2:00:27] automobile but now I've got several
[2:00:29] mechanics in the church and I don't know
[2:00:31] one thing about it see if I make a
[2:00:33] mistake Brethren remember I'm not a
[2:00:34] mechanic there has to be coils plugs
[2:00:39] points Valves and everything that makes
[2:00:43] the
[2:00:44] automobile right
[2:00:46] Saints there's points there's plugs
[2:00:50] it might be a plug on page three there
[2:00:53] might be points on page 15 there's
[2:00:56] Sparks on page 32 and you got to go
[2:00:59] through that thing through that message
[2:01:02] and there is something for
[2:01:05] you it doesn't all come together at the
[2:01:07] same time but there's something for you
[2:01:10] and there's more than what you have
[2:01:13] right now that's right and so he the
[2:01:17] teacher has to accompany
[2:01:19] you when you're studying when you're
[2:01:22] reading and you believe that he's there
[2:01:25] with you so let's just take for a moment
[2:01:28] on the
[2:01:30] baptism now brother branner brings it
[2:01:32] out in those two messages that your
[2:01:36] birth into this your birth into
[2:01:41] this your birth into this how many
[2:01:44] remember that the seven
[2:01:48] births but let's go a little bit further
[2:01:50] than just the
[2:01:51] births there are
[2:01:54] baptisms upon
[2:01:57] baptisms and there's
[2:01:59] feelings and then there's
[2:02:03] refilling now I I know and I and I'll
[2:02:06] probably venture out to say this there's
[2:02:08] probably some people here in the
[2:02:12] building here that has never been what
[2:02:15] we call filled with the Holy Spirit and
[2:02:19] the idea or the thought is that the
[2:02:22] spirit is filling every fiber of you but
[2:02:25] it's not
[2:02:26] just maybe that's I would say it's a
[2:02:29] shower or the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:33] it' be like you being baptized in
[2:02:36] water and so that Holy Spirit comes upon
[2:02:39] you it's an
[2:02:41] anointing it's another atmosphere that
[2:02:43] you was in and that is what we long for
[2:02:48] more more of those in our Christian
[2:02:51] Journey um some of us have probably
[2:02:53] never felt what that is and I would say
[2:02:56] to you as a brother as a pastor as a I
[2:02:59] would pray for God to let me be baptized
[2:03:03] in the Holy Ghost one more time all
[2:03:07] right is that going to hurt anybody
[2:03:11] maybe some church folks are afraid of it
[2:03:13] but I'm not church folks Lord I'm your
[2:03:16] son I want to feel the blessing of the
[2:03:19] Holy Spirit one more time I want the
[2:03:23] baptism of the Holy Spirit to come down
[2:03:26] upon me just once more Lord I already
[2:03:30] believe your word I already a Christian
[2:03:34] but I want to feel your presence just
[2:03:37] one more time lord is that a is that an
[2:03:41] appropriate prayer is that a good prayer
[2:03:44] is that a righteous
[2:03:47] prayer
[2:03:52] am and so this is not a one time
[2:03:58] happening this is not just for preachers
[2:04:02] only this is this can happen to you this
[2:04:04] morning hallu another filling of the
[2:04:09] Holy
[2:04:14] Ghost
[2:04:16] so brother bam actually gives us an
[2:04:18] example of
[2:04:20] that in the message Lord show us the
[2:04:22] father let me take a a moment here and
[2:04:25] bring this for you show us the
[2:04:29] father 1953 paragraph one shall we bow
[2:04:32] our heads just a moment our heavenly
[2:04:35] father May that not only be from our
[2:04:38] lips but may it be from the depths of
[2:04:40] our heart Lord I believe and may today
[2:04:44] the Holy Spirit give us another baptism
[2:04:49] May our earnestness and the best that we
[2:04:53] have to give to God be be brought
[2:04:57] forward
[2:04:59] today he's he's he's actually praying to
[2:05:02] the father he's praying to the Lord see
[2:05:06] this is a prayer you're not looking
[2:05:07] around the rest of the church this is a
[2:05:10] prayer you're not worried about what
[2:05:11] everybody else is doing or not doing
[2:05:13] this is a prayer between a son and a
[2:05:17] father Lord send me another
[2:05:20] baptism another refilling of the Holy
[2:05:23] Ghost I needed in my walk I'm tired Lord
[2:05:28] I need it in my faith I'm
[2:05:32] discouraged I need another baptism
[2:05:36] Lord
[2:05:38] hallelujah the Journey's getting heavy
[2:05:40] on me I'm tired Lord I'm in this battle
[2:05:43] I've been tired I've been wearied I've
[2:05:45] been stressed Lord send a refreshing on
[2:05:48] me
[2:05:49] send it on my soul oh godall now that's
[2:05:53] a real prayer
[2:05:55] Saints and that's a prayer for the
[2:05:58] believer here what the prophet of God
[2:06:00] says here in the message the
[2:06:05] resurrection number 53 he
[2:06:08] says good oldfashioned Holy Ghost sent
[2:06:11] Revival men back to beli in the word of
[2:06:14] God that God will take care of us like
[2:06:16] he did in the old days he'll take care
[2:06:19] of us today do you believe that God will
[2:06:22] take care of us what we need today is
[2:06:25] another
[2:06:26] refilling another like the disciples
[2:06:29] three days some of you trying to test an
[2:06:32] experience or I trusted that they had 10
[2:06:36] years ago that's all right but what
[2:06:39] about
[2:06:42] today you need one
[2:06:45] today today is the day sure a
[2:06:49] filling the disciples about three or 4
[2:06:52] days after they received the Holy Ghost
[2:06:54] went back and got in one Accord and
[2:06:56] begin to pray again with one Accord
[2:06:59] until the Holy Ghost shook the building
[2:07:01] where they were sitting amen what we
[2:07:06] need why Christ speak
[2:07:09] 1959 paragraph 12 he says if you just
[2:07:12] accept him as your personal sa savior
[2:07:14] have not yet received the Holy Ghost I
[2:07:16] trust that tonight you'll receive it
[2:07:18] amen I see some of the Tabernacle folks
[2:07:21] here I'm going to say this about the big
[2:07:23] sister see one thing that the Tabernacle
[2:07:27] needs up there at our church at the
[2:07:30] Tabernacle at Jeff is a
[2:07:33] rededication and a refilling of the Holy
[2:07:36] Ghost
[2:07:38] right everyone to get down to the Altar
[2:07:41] and pray until they get a renewing of
[2:07:44] the Holy Ghost the whole church be
[2:07:48] filled with the power of God that's what
[2:07:52] we need not only the Tabernacle there
[2:07:55] but the body of Christ
[2:07:57] Universal it needs a
[2:08:02] refilling David said one time ReStore in
[2:08:04] me the joy of my salvation not that he
[2:08:08] lost his salvation but the joy of it
[2:08:11] when it comes to a place that I can
[2:08:13] enjoy my religion my salvation there's
[2:08:15] something wrong somewhere because it's
[2:08:18] joy unspeakable and full of
[2:08:21] Glory I'm so
[2:08:24] glad one of them said taste to see that
[2:08:27] the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in
[2:08:28] the Rock I'm so glad that I've tasted
[2:08:31] that the Lord is good I love honey a
[2:08:38] amen do we need another filling another
[2:08:41] baptism see you have to be taught that
[2:08:43] that's available to you not be afraid of
[2:08:46] it and don't be mad at at people that is
[2:08:49] getting it I mean that's a that's
[2:08:51] something you Embrace that's an
[2:08:55] opportunity when the Holy Spirit comes
[2:08:57] down that's an opportunity not to clam
[2:09:00] up but to open
[2:09:04] up knock the cobwebs off of your
[2:09:10] praise get the rust out of your your
[2:09:14] your your your your
[2:09:15] Hallelujah and your amens it
[2:09:22] flowing it's like anything else you get
[2:09:25] into the
[2:09:26] spirit but the spirit we're getting into
[2:09:28] is the holy spirit that great Capstone
[2:09:33] that's coming down to unite with the
[2:09:36] believer remember it's going to be a
[2:09:38] birth after birth after birth now in
[2:09:42] these
[2:09:43] baptisms the scriptures speak of the
[2:09:46] Holy Ghost and Fire
[2:09:49] in these baptisms of the Holy Ghost
[2:09:52] there is a cleansing fire that cleanses
[2:09:56] the sin from the heart of the True
[2:09:59] Believer it is part of the process it is
[2:10:03] how we overcome it's how we make the
[2:10:06] next step is how we get to the next
[2:10:08] stage is through another birth another
[2:10:12] baptism another T touch another Fire
[2:10:17] Fall
[2:10:19] in our lives in our hearts in our
[2:10:22] unbelief to make us more like him amen
[2:10:26] now we thank God for what we are today I
[2:10:28] love how brother George brought that
[2:10:30] Sunday night we're sincere but we want
[2:10:32] to
[2:10:33] be more
[2:10:35] sincere and we have the word but we want
[2:10:38] more of the
[2:10:40] word can I give you a scriptural example
[2:10:43] for a moment all right we're all sincere
[2:10:46] but we want to be more sincere turn to
[2:10:47] Acts chapter 17 we got into this
[2:10:49] Thursday night in Phoenix Acts chapter
[2:10:52] 17
[2:11:13] quickly Acts chapter 17 I believe that's
[2:11:16] where it is
[2:11:21] look at these people here and I want you
[2:11:23] to classify yourself here acts 17:10 and
[2:11:27] the
[2:11:28] Brethren immediately sent Away Paul and
[2:11:31] Silas By Night unto
[2:11:33] Berea Who coming thither went into the
[2:11:35] synagogue of the
[2:11:37] Jews these were more noble than those in
[2:11:41] thessalonica and that they received the
[2:11:43] word with
[2:11:45] what all ready
[2:11:48] of mind and search the tapes search the
[2:11:53] scriptures
[2:11:55] daily whether those things were
[2:12:00] so therefore many of them believe also
[2:12:03] of honorable women which were Greeks and
[2:12:06] of men not a few so it's interesting how
[2:12:10] the Bible highlights the the men of
[2:12:13] Berea the people of Berea in contrast to
[2:12:17] the thes
[2:12:18] alians those of Thessalon
[2:12:22] thessalonia they were Noble but the men
[2:12:25] of Berea were
[2:12:27] what more noble why why what made them
[2:12:31] more noble were they taller were they
[2:12:34] shorter did they shout louder what made
[2:12:37] them more noble the same thing that'll
[2:12:39] make you more noble by searching the
[2:12:43] Scriptures Daily God sent you the
[2:12:46] scriptures so you can read them and then
[2:12:49] you read them and then you act upon them
[2:12:52] you believe them with all of your heart
[2:12:56] and you do that daily
[2:12:59] amen yes
[2:13:02] sir we need our nobility come on risen
[2:13:08] today on this great subject on the
[2:13:12] baptism of the Holy
[2:13:14] Ghost and the great Capstone of
[2:13:16] perfection
[2:13:18] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[2:13:20] father in Heaven is perfect is the age
[2:13:24] requirement but they have rejected it
[2:13:27] who is they the people the Ministries
[2:13:31] they have rejected this Stone and
[2:13:34] they've rejected it by a open rejection
[2:13:39] and they have rejected it by not
[2:13:42] accepting
[2:13:44] it and we don't want to be of that group
[2:13:48] that reject the
[2:13:50] word just with a casual cold shoulder or
[2:13:54] lifestyle of a lukewarm
[2:13:57] leoan the Leo Deans had so much they
[2:14:02] didn't need anybody to teach him they
[2:14:05] didn't need a prayer meeting Hallelujah
[2:14:08] they're so anointed they didn't need a h
[2:14:12] you know an extra service they didn't
[2:14:13] need to be a part of the special
[2:14:15] meetings they didn't need to come be a
[2:14:18] part of any prayer group they didn't
[2:14:20] need to fast I mean there's many
[2:14:22] Christians that don't eat I'm talking
[2:14:24] about people in the message that don't
[2:14:26] even
[2:14:28] fast
[2:14:30] yes what's nice about that prayer that
[2:14:33] we ask you to pray those that could
[2:14:36] Friday and Saturday is you're probably
[2:14:39] already
[2:14:40] fasting from 5:00 a.m. to
[2:14:43] 6: um breakfast is breaking of the fast
[2:14:47] you didn't have your breakfast yet I
[2:14:49] don't
[2:14:50] think um for most of us you know if you
[2:14:53] get up that early in the morning the
[2:14:55] last meal was the day prior so you get
[2:14:58] up you're on an empty
[2:15:00] stomach and then maybe you have to wash
[2:15:02] your face to get going right you got to
[2:15:05] get in the spirit you know you're going
[2:15:06] to pray for an hour those of you that
[2:15:09] did
[2:15:10] it and so maybe you took a shower to get
[2:15:13] woke woken up and then you take that
[2:15:15] hour and then you pray and the Lord does
[2:15:19] wonderful things when we do that and
[2:15:22] just think of that there's many people
[2:15:23] don't see the value of that or see the
[2:15:25] need of it of the day and it's because
[2:15:28] it's the way they are taught they're
[2:15:30] taught that tomorrow we can do it or we
[2:15:33] have a next day or just the spirit of
[2:15:35] the age has us you know just constantly
[2:15:37] putting things off but I'm so glad that
[2:15:41] the message is on the tapes and so I'm
[2:15:44] not out of line with what I'm bringing
[2:15:46] you because what I got was on the
[2:15:49] tapes and this is what the word of the
[2:15:52] Lord brought to us is what's on the
[2:15:55] tapes and so I don't have to be afraid
[2:15:59] of any of the gifts of the Spirit I
[2:16:02] don't have to be afraid of any of the
[2:16:04] quotes that people argue about or or get
[2:16:07] feel uncomfortable about why you feel
[2:16:09] uncomfortable when I say the tent
[2:16:11] Vision uh I could have said return
[2:16:14] Ministry but I don't even use that term
[2:16:16] but I said the ttin B what's the tent
[2:16:18] Vision well I don't know that's on
[2:16:22] you if you don't
[2:16:25] know oh I knew it's going to tight I
[2:16:28] didn't know it was going to tighten up
[2:16:29] but it tightened
[2:16:30] up brother and sister you got time to
[2:16:33] study that
[2:16:36] out go home and study it up for
[2:16:40] yourself and put in a tent Vision put it
[2:16:44] in there just study it oh if I do that
[2:16:47] I'm going to be a you going to be
[2:16:48] identified as a Believer if you do it
[2:16:51] exactly I use that one cuz that one is
[2:16:54] the sticky one that's the real
[2:16:56] aggressive one I you I love using that
[2:16:59] one because why what I got to hide
[2:17:02] for he said I didn't say it I never had
[2:17:06] a vision in my life he had the
[2:17:10] vision praise the Lord don't let people
[2:17:12] make you feel uncomfortable about a
[2:17:14] vision he had I feel uncomforable about
[2:17:18] some of these brothers Visions but not
[2:17:20] this one all right no
[2:17:22] sir say what the tapes say say what the
[2:17:26] Visions say and you hear those Visions
[2:17:28] they look complicated you just say Amen
[2:17:31] thank you Lord I'll receive what you
[2:17:34] have for me the part I need to know
[2:17:37] you'll open up what I don't know I still
[2:17:39] believe you I love you
[2:17:44] Lord
[2:17:46] amen can I take one more quote or two in
[2:17:50] the message earnestly contending for the
[2:17:51] faith brother bandam says this
[2:17:53] here here's what's the matter with you
[2:17:56] Builders you ministers standing out
[2:18:00] there that's what's the matter when they
[2:18:02] built the temple of Solomon they started
[2:18:04] putting the temple up and they found a
[2:18:06] freak
[2:18:08] Stone it was a freak
[2:18:14] quote everybody ain't smiling come on
[2:18:18] it's some quotes that
[2:18:20] will hey wait whoa what you trying to
[2:18:24] say there what's going
[2:18:29] on let me stop there all right let let
[2:18:32] me just let me stop there just to
[2:18:34] conserve time um but I'm going to take
[2:18:37] you to three
[2:18:38] scriptures in in the Bible and then
[2:18:41] we'll get to that another time all right
[2:18:43] on the builders the builders are the
[2:18:45] ministers and they're the ones who who
[2:18:47] failed to teach the people they're
[2:18:50] responsible and and it's all right here
[2:18:52] in the word I have it all right here and
[2:18:54] there was a freak stone that came and
[2:18:57] they got the building built so high and
[2:18:59] they couldn't go any further that's
[2:19:01] right and neither will
[2:19:03] you go any further until you include the
[2:19:09] freak Stone sir the stone that's been
[2:19:12] rejected the stone that all the
[2:19:14] criticism is around the stone that caes
[2:19:17] separation to them but it actually draws
[2:19:20] us together to be one with the stone The
[2:19:24] Headstone the Lord Jesus Christ amen so
[2:19:27] let's take a few scriptures as I close
[2:19:29] in Matthew St John chapter
[2:19:34] 7:43 good preaching God bless
[2:19:38] you St John
[2:19:42] 7:43 says this
[2:19:46] here
[2:19:50] and start verse 40 many of the people
[2:19:52] therefore when they heard this saying
[2:19:56] what's the saying what's the saying I'm
[2:19:59] going ask you a question it's a
[2:20:01] quote many of the people when they heard
[2:20:04] this saying said of a truth this is the
[2:20:09] prophet others said this is the Christ
[2:20:11] but some said shall Christ come out of
[2:20:15] Galilee ha not the scripture said that
[2:20:17] Christ cometh out of the seat of David
[2:20:19] and out of the town of Bethlehem where
[2:20:22] David was so there was a division among
[2:20:26] the people
[2:20:28] because of
[2:20:31] him and there's
[2:20:33] still a
[2:20:35] division among the
[2:20:38] people
[2:20:40] because of
[2:20:46] him you see the picture we have in the
[2:20:49] foer there we had this company up the
[2:20:51] street here posters whatever framed that
[2:20:54] for us and they did a wonderful job the
[2:20:56] the man there I think he's losing his
[2:20:58] mind a bit now he came in here and we
[2:21:00] installed it right up here just to see
[2:21:04] it he was like what's with this picture
[2:21:06] what's he kept asking me that and I kept
[2:21:07] kind of shucking it I didn't answer him
[2:21:09] directly what's in that picture and then
[2:21:11] he he stood back he says hey there's a I
[2:21:16] see something in the picture sure he's
[2:21:17] still right there he actually
[2:21:20] used like a almost a semi swear
[2:21:24] word I mean he's a c he was a Catholic
[2:21:27] not that it's okay for Catholics to do
[2:21:28] that but he was like he beep he used a
[2:21:33] swear
[2:21:34] word there's a face in there see I see
[2:21:38] something I said what you
[2:21:41] see I want to hear him preach to me so
[2:21:44] bad what you see man yeah he said
[2:21:47] there's a face in there I said yes and I
[2:21:52] shared with him a little bit about the
[2:21:54] Angels coming down and he's like man
[2:21:57] I've never seen nothing like that in my
[2:21:59] life I wish some God speed and he went
[2:22:02] on do you see the face that's in
[2:22:05] there do
[2:22:09] you this has gone under attack here the
[2:22:12] last few
[2:22:13] years there was great
[2:22:15] division over over
[2:22:18] him in this
[2:22:20] message but we're not of those that are
[2:22:22] divided because of that we're actually
[2:22:25] gathered around
[2:22:27] it we're like that's the dinner
[2:22:31] table
[2:22:33] this something about to be said that's
[2:22:35] going to jump me off I'm about to put my
[2:22:38] praise shoes on I'mma run through here
[2:22:42] praising God when I when I hear he from
[2:22:47] this great headstone that's com in our
[2:22:50] day praise the name of the Lord we're
[2:22:53] not running from it we're running to it
[2:22:55] why because I've been taught
[2:22:57] to I've been taught to take one more
[2:23:00] scripture St John chapter 9 verse
[2:23:13] 16 verse number 12 then said they unto
[2:23:16] him where is he he said I know not they
[2:23:19] brought to the Pharisees him that a four
[2:23:21] time was blind and it was the Sabbath
[2:23:24] day when Jesus made the clay and opened
[2:23:26] his
[2:23:27] eyes then again the Pharisees also asked
[2:23:31] him how he had received his sight he
[2:23:33] said unto them he put clay upon my eyes
[2:23:37] and I washed and do SE therefore said
[2:23:41] some of the Pharisees this man is not of
[2:23:43] God because he keepeth not the Sabbath
[2:23:46] day other says how can a man that is a
[2:23:49] sinner do such Miracles and there was a
[2:23:54] division among them we take one more and
[2:23:59] let's see St John 10 just right
[2:24:05] over verse 15 as the father knoweth me
[2:24:08] even so know I the father and lay down
[2:24:11] my life for the sheep and other sheep I
[2:24:13] have which are not of this fold them
[2:24:15] also I must bring and they shall hear my
[2:24:17] voice and there shall be one fold one
[2:24:21] Shepherd therefore doth my father love
[2:24:23] me because I lay down my life that I may
[2:24:26] take it again no man taketh it from me
[2:24:29] but I lay it down of myself I have power
[2:24:31] to lay it down I have power to take it
[2:24:33] up again this commandment have I
[2:24:36] received of my father there was a
[2:24:38] division therefore again among the Jews
[2:24:43] for these sayings
[2:24:47] so these sayings cause
[2:24:52] divisions amongst those that have not
[2:24:56] received these sayings and we're so glad
[2:25:00] that we're not being divided but we're
[2:25:02] being united don't you thank the Lord
[2:25:05] for that aren't you happy for the rock
[2:25:08] of
[2:25:09] offense to them amen it's a stumbling
[2:25:13] stone for for us it's the question to
[2:25:18] all the answers of my
[2:25:20] life it answered all the questions of my
[2:25:24] life was this headstone it didn't create
[2:25:28] a problem it created the answer for me
[2:25:32] it was the Lord Jesus Christ being
[2:25:36] placed in my life a stone that I had
[2:25:39] rejected for many many years and thought
[2:25:41] I can be better by doing this and better
[2:25:43] by joining Church better if I could just
[2:25:45] eat right or do right if I could just
[2:25:47] stop going out on Friday night if I
[2:25:49] could just stop running like this and
[2:25:51] stop drinking
[2:25:54] stop but over in the weed pile there
[2:25:57] there was a stone that I had
[2:25:59] rejected and in one day that stone was
[2:26:01] revealed to me and that answered all the
[2:26:04] questions in my life it will answer the
[2:26:06] question in your life today don't you
[2:26:09] believe that how many love the
[2:26:12] stone rejected by many but accepted by
[2:26:16] me
[2:26:17] the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you let
[2:26:21] us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[2:26:24] your word
[2:26:26] today we thank you for your people
[2:26:29] that's gathered around the
[2:26:32] word Lord I pray that you would break
[2:26:37] every Spirit of unbelief that would
[2:26:40] cause me to
[2:26:42] reject any
[2:26:45] truth that would cause me me
[2:26:47] to be of the crowd that would be a non
[2:26:51] acceptor nonacceptance through my
[2:26:54] actions through my
[2:26:57] coldness but Lord let me be like the
[2:27:00] bereans let me search the scriptures let
[2:27:03] me take them
[2:27:04] daily let me be more noble than I ever
[2:27:08] have been for these things where you
[2:27:11] have made it to where I can actually
[2:27:16] study the word and compare
[2:27:19] it in this day 2023 Lord what a
[2:27:24] time I can compare the message I can the
[2:27:28] sisters can compare it and in their
[2:27:31] lives the young people can compare
[2:27:34] ministers and father we just want to to
[2:27:39] take advantage of that today we love you
[2:27:42] we thank you we ask for these blessings

[2:34:02] Holy Ghost in your own personal time if
[2:34:05] you take that message God hiding in
[2:34:09] Simplicity right at the end of the
[2:34:11] message starting at paragraph number uh
[2:34:15] 329 God hiding in Simplicity he gives an
[2:34:19] altar
[2:34:20] call and and and he preached this
[2:34:23] message twice those of you that would
[2:34:25] take us a note of this God hiding in
[2:34:28] Simplicity in Jeffersonville and then he
[2:34:30] preached it in New Mexico and at the end
[2:34:32] of the message there's an altar call and
[2:34:35] he's there laboring with the people and
[2:34:38] the Holy Ghost comes down and he cus it
[2:34:41] there's there was the showers of the
[2:34:43] Holy Ghost that fell upon four or five
[2:34:47] or six people and he identified them and
[2:34:50] I want you to hear that and listen to
[2:34:52] how he instructed them to raise their
[2:34:55] hands to don't sit down don't don't
[2:34:59] leave just hold on to the promise stay
[2:35:02] right with it amen and that's what we do
[2:35:04] when the Holy Spirit Comes Close Your
[2:35:06] Eyes raise your hands and get into the
[2:35:09] spirit of what's going on and just ask
[2:35:12] him Lord pass by my by my way this is
[2:35:15] something that you you forget about what
[2:35:17] others are doing around you and then you
[2:35:20] get into his presence and let him F you
[2:35:24] one more time cuz we need it in our
