you can control and use that father I'll be out of the way that your people will see you father this are your I'm standing in front of your children royalties Abraham Royal seeds I didn't die for them but father that Thursday night in the Garden of Gethsemane the Bible father teaches us that your sweat turned to blood because father you saw every one of them through the stream of time and you died for them so father you died for them you know their needs I don't because I did not die for them so father tonight I pray Lord God that may you use me as your channel of communication use my voice but

allowing the Holy Spirit tonight to take over take control of the everything here that will be done so that father at the end only the Lord Jesus Christ get the Glory thank you for everything we commit out to your hands tonight in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated for few minutes um in fact let us stand and read the scripture we get that out of the way and then uh okay let's read our scriptures tonight um sorry um the first scripture we are going to read is habac habakuk habak 2 we start from verse one habac 2 and we start from verse one I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it PL upon tables that he may run that R now let me stop here um it's kind of a little bit hard to understand what is says here in verse two so I'll read you from the Hebrew Bible the Hebrew Bible says that to write the vision PL that he who comes can stand it h h h um can understand it quickly to make it plain all right but he say here he will run he that read it may run but it says that when you come you can understand it fast amen all right behold no three for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end he shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t now I would like you to pay all your attention on verse four behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith now we are accustomed to saying the J shall live by faith but what type of Faith you can you can hide yourself in the faith of the church you can hide yourself in the faith of your parent but here what is saying the just shall live by his faith and that's what we're going to be talking tonight uh Joshua let's read the book of Joshua 1 Joshua 1 8-9 Joshua 1 18-9 um this book of the law yes shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success says have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismay for the Lord thy God is with thee with soever that goeth I have two quick scripture the one is very familiar to us Malachi uh Malachi um 4 5-6 very familiar scripture Malachi 45-6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He Shall he shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the with a curse one more verse uh um Genesis 15 Genesis 15 Genesis 15 and verse 6 and he talking about Abraham and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness you may be seated and may the Lord add a blessing to a reading of the word so tonight my title I give the tile before I start anything else usually ministers we forget that contend for the faith restored by Malachi 4 to do the Greater Works of Christ contending for the faith restored by Malachi 4 to do the Greater Works of Christ amen so first of all I didn't mean to jump straight to business I want to first read the scriptures uh I let me I want to say shalom and uh greet you all uh on behalf of my wife sister henriet um I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who made us acceptable uh to God by his finished work of Calvary is only through his finished work at Calvary that he made us acceptable not by anything that I did or you did not none of us or will ever do amen I'm my pastor brother Mike W uh send you all his greetings when I was coming well tell all the Brethren I send them all my greetings and I think brother is Israel said that uh uh he met him once so he send you all his greetings and I would like to extend on behalf of my wife and myself our heartfelt thanks to brother and sister Paul uh brother and sister Robson for making us so welcome um we yesterday from yesterday uh at brother at the robson's and today at lunch we just felt like we've known you for a long time you know usually they say there have to be a moment of ice breaking there were no eyes because there are no eyes between the children of God anyway so there are no eyes to break there there were only heartfelt warm Fellowship to share amen and uh I also like to thank uh my new little friend Timothy for taking us to the Sabino Canyon uh yesterday uh thank you so much and sister eron I can tell you those pamplet are great you know when I went to Israel when I'm reading the Bible I can I place myself I see myself in the story when a story is being told and you can place yourself in the story then what happen is that the story becomes aive to you and you become a life to the story you feel like you are part of it is not a history or some record that is been read to you amen so we've heard so many about the Sabino Canyon about the sword Eagle uh rock and all that but going there now when I'm listening now to the message with that I'll be looking I say that's right I I can picture myself standing there experiencing what the prophet is experiencing amen amen and I'm sure my wife will feel the same and brother isra you know I told him if I call him don't think that I'm making name funny I'm so used to pronouncing the word Israel in Hebrew so that when I said it Israel people he didn't say right that that I told him you know to forgive him Advance I'm so used to I have to think to not say to say that way America I mean the in English way so brother Israel I uh thank you for your confidence for the confidence you have in inviting me to speak in your ppit and I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ help me to not betray that trust uh you know pastors are Shepherds that God appoint to watch over his children and as Shepherd a Shepherd they stay at the door all right and why are they at the door they at the door the entrance to a ship fold and they make sure that only sheep food enters to feed the flock nothing else I don't care who that person is I don't care what reputation you have you only bring in sheep food amen so tonight my main objective is to bring in sheep food with spiritual vitamins uh and say something that will draw you closer to the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthen your faith in him amen I want to share a few things with you to encourage you in your Christian Journey now the Christian journey is a journey of love it's a Journey of Faith a journey of Friendship with God Amen and that's the journey that our father AB abam had that they call him the friend of God and uh uh I I I'll jump a little bit ahead on my Note here and we are all here tonight Abraham Royal seed and you know I'm already getting ahead of myself here I know what's going to happen now Abraham he was called Abraham he left the ear of the childes and the word ear of childes mean the fire of the childes so he left fire God took him out of that and that's why each time when God came to him God told him I am the god who took out of that fire but when you read the ear you may not want know what God was telling him I am the one who took you out of that fire amen and then we didn't know anything about Abraham until all of sudden in verse 14 when Abraham was about to play was kind of was going to give us the the the the the tidee the prefigure of redemption to go redeem his brother lot all of a sudden name appear attached to Abraham name they say all of a sudden somebody who escaped and came we never heard that word before nowhere all say Abraham the Hebrew have you ever asked what that means oh what it means and brother thank God for a prophet who came in a plain when I was studying Hebrew and I saw the prophet explain it for a prophet Seven Grade explained I never heard that from anybody else you can tell me anything to convince me of anything else amen so Hebrew mean crossover so you have crossover left everything and Abraham Abraham he cross cross the the the the the the the river I mean cross everything so each one of you tonight you left your associate you left everything all the different you left and cross over so so everyone of you so what is the saying that he was called Abraham the crossover so every single one of you here you can call yourself you can say Israel the Hebrew every single one of you here you can put after your name the Hebrew Hebrew is not a race thing is about crossing over and being Abraham Royal seed you cross over everything and you're here tonight every single one of you you are Hebrew amen and you don't have to look back and if we go back to Abraham we stay here we won't finish amen I just want to throw that out there every time you get up you say I'm a Hebrew and what say what do you mean are you a Jew you don't have a Jewish passport if you have a Jewish passport you are Israelite but when you have the passport from Heaven you are Hebrew you cross over amen in Christ Jesus amen so now when your faith is strongly Anchored In Christ and his finished work at Calvary you can see your position in Christ as a True Believer redeemed amen now I'll get if I have time I'll get a littleit into Redemption even if I had to skip everything and get to Redemption I get there because you see one thing I came to find out brother Bram you have heard him always say that we are here in the West and try to understand the Bible written in eastern but he said when you went there the Bible became new so if the Bible became new to him what did he what what did he preach in he preaching that new language and the reason why we didn't understand him he was speaking a language in with Eastern concept and we were are here with our Western education we are trying and that's why we never understood the prophet it had to be simple and then Eastern that to be simple simple simple simple but the may make it complicated you lost you lost it amen so you got to understand the simplest any complicated that every one of you get say I'm redeemed I'm Abraham Royal seed you don't just say it that has to be something that become a life to you and you're life to that so when any circumstance comes in life you see wait a minute I'm Abraham Ro seed I'm a Hebrew don't just don't say it just because brah has said it on a tape but you say because you're convinced amen and I'll try by God grace if we can reach there all right say something that will help you all right and when your faith all right when that Faith takes hold of God's Eternal world word the power of the grace of God you see when you talk about Grace people just look at favor oh you know what oh there grace of God so I can go and do this I can go and do that no Grace is the power of God to live for him is not the power to say know I I I'll go here and do it I go and do this and do that well by the grace of God God will forgive me Grace is the power of God the power of the Resurrection for you to be able to live for Christ amen and when the when the when your faith takes hold of God's Eternal world the power of the of the grace of God makes you know for sure that God call you before the foundation of the world what for to fulfill his own purpose not your purpose and that's what where where many of of us Christians have problem God call you before the foundation of the world not to fulfill your purpose but to fulfill his purpose amen uh remember it's not your purpose now it is God who has a need to be God remember that it is God who has a need to be a savior it is God who has a need to be a father that's right amen amen it is God Amen and what happen is that those need produce Who You Are this evening Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ so it's not your purpose it's his purpose amen now as you read in Romans 8:28 uh uh um all things work together for good for those all all right for good to them that love him to them who are called according to who your purpose no according to his purpose amen now his very name Elohim all right if you had time to get into we won't have time to get his very name Elohim means that everything is connected to him amen and and and and and and let me read here in Romans Romans 11 uh 34-36 it says here for who have known the mind of the Lord or who have been his counselor or who have first given to him and he shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to him be glory forever we are connected to him so tonight you sitting here you are connected to him amen and and and and and Bram express it I won't have time to read the quote here but in 19 uh uh 64 February 5th God is his own interpreter BR Braham explained that we are his attributes amen and all those attribute that have before you ever came here those attributes all right make you who you are here tonight amen so andam said here and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking before there even was a word you were in Christ that's right Amen in God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subject and the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled sin and so forth and that's what God and that's what God uh is the whole thing that's what God is the whole thing amen so I said tonight you are connected to him please never let Satan or your circumstances talk you out of that amen never let Satan or circumstances talk you out of that amen all you have to do is hold on to his word and and promise to you and and his promises to you and be thankful from your heart at all times in your life it doesn't matter what comes thank you Lord I don't care what happened thank you Lord all right let me quickly jump here quick again I I I'll say some I'll throw something out there that usually I show in PowerPoint when you say when you raise your hand say hallelujah praising God and BR Brown told us you are defeating gravity but you know what you're doing when you raise your hand in a in a word Hebrew all right the word praise Hallelujah is written with it start with something because everything is almost like like pictures he start with a breath and two hands raised they say with one hand you giving your heart to God and if your other hand you are taking his heart so that's why brother say when you raise your hand you are giving your heart now it does not say what hand but it was just me say you know what I think with my left hand I'm raising I'm ging my heart because my heart is here so I give him that heart and I take his hand because he said his when I take his hand I give me the power with the right hand to do anything right so I give him my heart and I take his heart that's what praise mean so I don't care what you're going through when you when you are connected to God you in syn with him then your heart beat at the rhythm of God's heart I don't care what Satan does that's why when Satan went rooming all over and went to God God said you've been rooming where you've been rooming all over have you considered job because job's heart is beaten at the rate of my heart it's of course you if you put all that hedge around him of course it's okay I'll remove the Hedge you see what you can do amen go and try but don't touch his soul and that's what every one of us Abraham we all see it it doesn't matter what is happening our hearts and God's heart should be beating together in harmony our heart should be one with God's heart and how do you do that is to praise and that's the secret and that's how you can see when Happ say raise your hand raise your hand I said did know what it was that that's a secret and that's where the Hallelujah came from halel mean you raise your hand you give one heart to God take his heart and and yah is God you are doing that you are one with God and if you're one with God what can touch you Satan can that's why say well if you put that all that hedge around him you what can I do say they cannot do anything amen all right now may his word all right and like I said be thankful from your heart at all times in your life and in all circumstances you face or go through and love your neighbor as yourself and be forgiven amen love your neighbor as yourself and be forgiven amen now may his word all right be alive to you and you alive to his word amen amen he is your shield for he was the shield of Abraham amen and you are Abraham Royal seed this evening and the promise was made to Abraham and his seed amen you have to make that promise in life to you when you get up in the morning I say Here Am Abraham R seed thank you Lord I know you made this promise to of my father but it's to me you made it too now God you you are my shield I know you are El Shai amen help me to live today guide me lead me give me the strength I give to my father Abraham amen now this evening all right there's nothing new that I will be bringing all right if you come expect Moria to bring something new then you'll be very disappointed why because whatever I will say I'm sure you've already read that in the Bible or heard heard it either through the voice of the seven messenger the Prophet The Voice to our age brother William Brenham or through your pastor brother Israel or through a visiting Minister you've already heard it amen this evening my desire to say something to stir your soul on what you already know and to ask so that you can ask yourself some question and do what are called spiritual introspection amen you know BR Ram told us a story about a lady who was suffering but that lady has uh she was suffering but her son was in India and the social services came there to see how they can help her amen and uh they asked her do you have any child he said yes I do are you in contact oh say yeah he sent me beautiful beautiful cards can we see those cards and all what they saw was money uh uh in those days uh those uh how you call it uh uh how you call it money um the assistent post office all right it's not actual money but you have to go and cash it in all right is not telegram how you call it again money like money or the type the old type okay a Travelers check we we it became Travelers check right voucher and she had it all over there and just suffering and as a studying one thing all right let me take a quick detour God talk spoke to Abraham and them in a daytoday life thing that they understand there's nothing complicated all right nothing was complicated imagine that a Biblical Hebrew have only 5,000 words but we today in our English language have millions of word trying to explain five so it's so simple so God spoke to them in Simplicity all right now as I studying doing self introspection the Lord also study from Hebrew point the Lord put on my heart those little stories of say here and there many time we gloss over them we Passover until we hear that say of the Lord people are not paying attention br br can start saying stories you can sometime people will sleep first when he begin say let's read the scripture okay yeah and then but bra has said a whole lot and and as I reading I go back and take the step for the very beginning br will place one little thing here and move on put one little thing here and move on one little thing here and move on one little thing here by the time begin to preach probably he's preaching to everybody now but he already put nuggets for the seed to find amen so the Lord put on my heart as I was looking on I'm I'm thinking that there's nothing new the Lord said that's right and then the Lord brought to my mind that story Abraham told he said that's what's happened to the bride I sent them a lot of a lot of money draft they have that there they have the M draft it's all over in their room every they don't know now what you have to do there nothing new you going to bring so when I go anywhere I put a disclaimer there nothing I'm bringing here if you think there nothing something new I'm going to bring they you'll be very disappointed all right but what we're going to be doing we're going to look for those morning draft they're all over amen so I said God now if you help me all right if you help me when I go somewhere no matter where I go I don't want to be seen But if you help me that I can go deep go into the message amen and take those and begin to shine the light on them all right then people can begin to see they can go and take the flashlight all right let Me Assume let's let let let let assume that okay okay this is my point I'll be using later but assume that it's a flashlight and let's let's assume that all of a sudden we power goes out here is complete dark complete dark nobody sees anything is a piano there it's still there my wife is sitting there she a sh city daugh city there Israel everybody the right and suppose that a and my flashlight and I oh there a piano did I did I did I BR did I brought the piano there all what I did the flag is already there so so when God sent a prophet he send us a bunch of money little money millions and we pack them there we argue we didn't understand what he said yes we didn't pray enough and then we are suffering and the social service comes do you have it yeah my father is in heaven who is your father the Lord Jesus Christ he down Calvary but you know what I don't he di but I don't know I I don't feel I don't know really did he send yeah yeah what he he he he gave me a book and the book has a lot of pages let's see what I am thy Shield wait a minute he was wounded for our transgressions was bruised for our iniquities the just sin fell upon him but he Str wait a minute he gave you that yes and that's what we ministers we have to do is find the flashlight and pray and ask God God where is it that's turn the light on and you flash it on it's there the prophet has revealed everything if there's anything new if there's anything new anyone can bring then we are denying Revelation 10:7 if there's anything new anybody can bring then we are saying that revelation 10:7 will never fulfill Malachi 4 amen all was fulfilled in Malachi 4 amen amen yes sir so now you see many people today they have problem they'll say well I I don't know what my purpose is you know what and you find out many sincere Christians all right sincere Christians devoted I don't know what my I don't really know what my uh my purpose is and I was uh as I was studying the Lord began to show me something you see my wife is a puzzle lover all right how many here love puzzle she can sit there I can sit there for two hours I can only put maybe two or three pieces she can tell you that all right that's not but she can be the know now but before she can put that puzzle I see that she has a picture she's looking at right now the reason imagine that she doesn't not have any picture and you bring all those puzzle I'm sure I mean she she's better than that I'm I'm sure I don't think she can do anything than first of all what are you putting together so you see his purpose was a big puzzle so instead of saying God show me my purpose say God show me what is your purpose and how do I how do I fit into that purpose so with the big picture I can see my wife would tell me no no no no you see how this this one goes here so when you find your purpose when you find his purpose and you begin to pray you begin to meditate on his word you begin to praise him you begin to connect with him then you can tell you you fit right in there amen and then he will show you how you fit in his purpose to fulfill that purpose because remember you never had a need to be a father you never had a need to be a savior a redeemer he's had that need to be God and be worship amen but now how is that going to happen he has to show you how you fit in that so you don't need to be scratching what's my purpose find his purpose first amen and and fill with the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost will lead you to how your purpose fit in his plan amen now now the seventh angel Malachi 4 the seven Church age messenger all right God promised that he will reveal all the Mysteries so the question today is did he reveal them or not if he didn't that mean well we're in trouble that mean we don't know what age we are in amen look look what we are look how things are going on who else are you waiting for to come I don't know amen so there's no new Mysteries all right everything has already been revealed right okay amen now now any Revelation that comes any light what I call Revelation when God Shine the light is not going to tell you that that thing speak is spooky it just it's simple yeah it's it's an instrument that's all what it is any Revelation that God send will show you that God is simple God loves you and he want you to love him back any Revelation that come who make God complicated obscure no that's never God and that's a reason why in 1963 everybody was waiting for the Seven Seals the whole world the stone the white stone that alive light had never shine on people thought that angel were flying all over the place but here the prophet walks humbled into the pulpit March 17 1963 God hiding himself and revealing him in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same and then he finished preaching the Seven Seals traveled to aluer New Mexico he preached in the morning walk for aart but what's the next message again God hiding in simplicity so he packaged that mystery that's right that God shine light on that we thought is going to be such such a great mystery even the revelation of the seventh Thunders when I asked him is it something new said no it's in the Bible so any new revelation any light that shine on anything that make God complicated uh-uh that's not that's not what it is and that's the reason why God has to raise a prophet with no great education to not make anything complicated sometime when he reading he can't even pronounce the word that the Theologian has interpreted and put here so complicated for him so he have to tell in tops of a dove an eagle if you take our English language or French French or anything maybe 20 years from now they say what the Academy of of science or Academy of these languages have seen that this world has to change right today with all what is going on with sex people don't know who they are the words are changing the word gender is changing is that right the word gender doesn't mean what it used to be anymore right but if I see an eagle 1,000 years from now an eagle is an eagle if I see a do 1 million years from now a dove is a dove a lamb is a lamb so God spoke in terms things like that that will stay and God sent a prophet so he doesn't use big words oh a deer oh I was standing there and I saw the eagle I was against The Rock he spoke in a language that God can relate to us that will never never change amen so in M uh uh he wrapped that whole Revelation simplicity so remember when you approach God you have to approach always simple mind and the simple mind will be God I love you what must I do to love you more that's that's it I love you what must I do to love you more that's simple and then you let him you because when you do that I love you how do I to love you more you are telling him God what must I do to fit in my part of the puzzle they say now you wait now don't press God you add to that Faith you have to add patience and wait and just keep moving keep holding on Amen all right let me quickly run here so that we can see some some stuff now brother branam he was a voice of God to our age and it presented to us the son of man he was a son of man born of a and Charles bradam from but he presented to her this son of man who came from God Amen so now if a person has a Holy Ghost and has a revelation of the word and here was a prophet says there's no way he can turn and say he's a false prophet it's not possible so now I want just to go and see few things all right I know my time is running now what is hearing you hear Jesus said he who have the hear to hear Let Him hear now when I came back from Peru uh two years ago I begin to do self introspection I begin to ask my self question now Jesus said we don't receive because we don't ask imagine that you have a child that never ask you a question never ask you dad what do you like never ask you dad what business are you in that who's your father who's your mother where he never asked you you wonder is something emotionally wrong with this child so God want us to ask ourself question amen so myself I began to do introspection God I know I love you but have I really done all what it takes for me to re understand this message that's good so what I'm telling God is that God I don't know I want you to Lead Me amen all right and as I began to do that I as myself a question God have I really obey you have I obey your word because one thing that God wants is not that great faith God want obedience God want simple obedience and trust in him all right now put put the put the I know I'm running I'm running out of time now put the put the PowerPoint so at least I can go through some of the PowerPoint all right I've been theing since 85 almost 40 years but the time you been aing does not matter what matter is that how simple do you love God that's what matters do you obey him now I I want to jump ahead here and U this message here was preach here that's why I'm starting from too soon as I was asking myself question about self introspection and all that that's one of a message that the Lord led me to um in 2018 the Lord put on my heart press on my heart to study the last Convention of the Prophet that was in sha Louisiana from November 25th to November 28th now I won't I we won't we won't I won't be able to go through all that but there's one that's got stuck with me and Steve can tell you is the last one on the wings of a snow white dog and that's why uh Timothy you always be stuck with me in my study is he took us there and show us where brother the story that was talking about when he was against um The Rock and saw White Eagle but when BR brah said that BR brah mentioned something that people don't pay attention to he said White Eagle now he said White Eagle parentheses do leading Eagle he has against The Rock Eagle but then he slid something in there SP do leading ego exactly where God said the next message will come and when I get there the Lord said now read what is he saying here then I took that I went back to Matthew when Jesus came out of the water the Dove came on him and he went to the Wilderness and when he came back from the wilderness in power he went to the synagogue to make his mission statement any business any Ministry any church that start you must have a mission statement with a Clear Vision amen and then what does it mean Dove leading Eagles I know what I know what what Eagles are strong birds and I know what doves are we have at home couple turtle doves you you to that thing the the feather Des I mean get disr on your hand and everything said you can see in those dos so I wonder I ask myself when I touch that Dove trying to sometime handle them move them their feather just come apart but how how is that Dove going to lead an eagle if an eagle flap his wing that do will disintegrate so the Lord put on my heart to go and study the message that BR Brown pre that morning amen and in that the message that he preached in that morning he said that the now the people are [Music] beginning to hear the message intellectually but the must lay under the sun and mature and T now we we come back to the message on the wing of Snow White Dove at the end of the message he was calling that was his Farewell convention he was telling Shalom all the nation was hooked by telephone hook up to Shaul lisiana and Brother briham begin to say all the way from New York being to call different ministers those are ministers filled with the Holy Ghost he said call all of them say say I'll be wrong Jeffersonville West Coast say say I'll be wrong all my life I want the dove to come in I can feel the fluttering of the dove coming in what was he saying he was telling us now I have brought you now you are going to you are going to go through the Wilderness to the desert Jesus when Jesus came out of the water the dove he says if you if if you read in Matthew 3-4 they say the dove led him to be tempted so you see when we heard those messages we thought we have Eagles faith we can move mountains but the prophet was trying to tell us that with that eagle fith that we thing we have we still have to surrender and let the dove now the dove is going to lead us through Wilderness it's not going to be easy many people think that time 77 oh be a Rapture we're gone so many people p 77 didn't know where we going anymore and yet the dove know where we are going the do know where we are going right with with that fa we're going to Rapture but you see Jesus we we are interested in the Rapture but Jesus is interested in the lost one that he died for amen amen so the dove was supposed to lead us we go through Wilderness all the thing that was going to happen to us God seen it and the only way now brother Brown say that's where the next message will come from I said what message this is it but what other message coming but it mean the holy spirit is going to lead us through this Wilderness the attack the fighting and all that if we can let the Holy Spirit lead us we will go through but we thought we have the faith we can do it then we begin to disintegrate right okay so here brother Bram just before he left us now in in in in in Hebrew if you want to find it and in the Bible if you want to find a real meaning of something you trace it back all the way to where it appears for the first time so the Lord put on my heart why don't you do that for the message too so I began to trace the message trace the message all the way to April 12 1947 the first message faith is the substance what what did I sending for to return back to original faith and then from April 12th 1947 to December 12th 1965 is exactly 18 years and 8 months now in the Hebrew 18 is life and eight is back to Eternity so with over 18 years and 8 months God send us a message life that send us back to Eternity amen back to Eternity so when we was living the last that whatever message that he preached he was just helping us encouraging us he said here all right I'm saying this so that you will understand what you're doing if you walk into anything blindly you don't know where what you're doing you can even have confidence if you don't know what you're doing amen and I realized that we've quoted the message we've done a lot with there have be quot walls the quot became like weapons and all that spiritual weapons against one another we never really understood what the prophet said all right so I was praying and the Lord begin to show some some separ that's what I want to share with you all right there's nothing new I'm bringing nothing new next slide please now you hear BR Bram said that the Bible is an Eastern book but we we are here looking at it from with a Western View and it's complete different all right it's a complete different that's why we never understood the prophet and that's why today you see there what called a blind faith people accepted it but today they don't understand it they walk into it blindly they never have confidence in the message when a hard time came look what happened many people say people could have been in the message for 40 years even some ministers pastors 40 years they never had confidence in it in the message what happened now he's a false prophet amen and he told us that all right so but the way the Bible was written Jesus me a parable so that we can always go back to it and that's why he sent a prophet to speak like Jesus spoke The Parables amen so let me do this brother Israel I'm running out of time now okay um I I want to do something quick you see this is a magnifier right if if if you see me walk in the street with this magnifier like this just walking like that you people say wait a minute that brother there's something wrong with him if you guys know me say oh brother M came and preach do you see him in the street he's losing it right but now what if you see me doing this someone say how is Morel oh I got it he's getting age he he he needs something to help him right so this thing here this is this so the same way that if I'm going around with this alone you think I'm crazy so if you just go if you just go around alone with this people say you a cult come on now that's right if I just go and have this is going around they say you are cult but if you like I said if you see me doing this you say why need help so this year magnify the word if you put it you see clear and that's why God told habac God told habac write the tables in such way that people who see it can extend it you don't have to say oh you know what this is that and no no no it's so that's why BR is simple so put the s that somebody who read it and understand the Simplicity of God that's I told heac right so brother Bram God sent him even though he didn't speak Hebrew he I can tell you having St a littleit Hebrew everything he was telling us was he was speaking from that Ean mindset to explain to us the heart of God now you don't need to learn Hebrew all what you have to do is pray that God Shine the Light on the message brother BR has already done all the work for us amen so then next slide please let me run quickly here next slide please all right now let let's keep this this I see the same quote talking about the eastern book all right next slide please now you see here I let me tell you see the Western mine and the hebraic mind so for them there's in the western we see a split between natural and Supernatural but for them everything Supernatural for example let me come here power power over others achieve through business politics and human organization but in the Eastern is power is dead power over others is structur by social patterns ordained by God you see next slide please when you begin to approach God from the Western we looking at God like from our power ourself what we can do but from over there everything is is is ordained by God all right n i I'll skip one day one one one day if I come here again I'll have to take time because that by says the message all right I just wanted to show that a little bit to show that God send us a prophet he brought us in the other column now if you look here in all the scriptures here okay you see that it say for it says for instance uh Genesis 20 20 20 28 obey my voice everywhere obey my voice obey my voice obey my voice so the question how do you obey a voice amen next slide please how do you obey a voice how do you obey a voice next slide please so this year no no no come back uh so you see this here is a definition you can get on the internet what obey means okay next slide please hear same thing but what does it really means obey and hear so the question that I was going to ask myself is that did I really hear the prophet first question I I hear sounds on the tape okay yes I hear sounds on the tape but did I hear the prophet that's what I'm trying to get to okay let's go to next so you see in Deuteronomy the you have a PR called shma the shma come from Deuteronomy 64 uh 64 to5 here oh Israel the Lord Our God the Lord is one so in Hebrew there really no word that mean obey now you'll be surprised there's really no word that means obey the Hebrew word that returns at obey is the word shma and and what the the shma which mean here but what it means it means more than just hearing or listening amen now it means when say sha let's say for instance you have a child a mother tell a child sh what is saying is that listen to what I said think about it and take the appropriate action all right if the child keep doing what he's doing the child didn't the child didn't hear amen so it means to hear and respond appropriately amen so when for instance the Bible says Moses uh uh the um when it say when the bible say that Moses heard the Lord it means that he heard him and then he acting upon what he heard amen now when a Bible all right says that the Lord heard the people it means that he heard them and took an appropriate action amen so when Jesus said he who have an ear to hear Let Him hear it looks like what what he's trying to say is that if you hear what I've said think about it P and take the appropriate action so for instance if you to the Pentecostal they heard a voice but when eser baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Spirit they didn't hear the word because the appropriate action will be to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ next slide please so so the the the the the the shma all right when David said for example the Lord heard me David is not accusing the Lord of being hard hearing he's saying that the Lord heard me and took the appropriate action towards me amen so next slide please I have to skip a lot here all right so now what is the main purpose for for obeying is love is not a fear of going to hell is not a fear of saying I'm lost is love because if you see here in uh in John 14 21 he said he that have my commandment and keepeth them is what is he that do what loveth me so love is the basis for obedience for hearing next slide please next slide now now okay let's keep this again let's keep this I want to quickly go next slide next slide again so here this is something very important all right this where I'm going to get AIT into Hebrew now in the Garden of Eden something happened when God's creation stopped to hear Satan now when Satan came first of all imagine that you have a child and you told your child don't go to the woods If the child heard what you say if I come to that child say let go to the wood the wood the child will say no period no arguing no reason I'm not going but imagine if I come to your child and tell the child did your dad say don't go to the wood because of the danger that I may hurt you they you begin to H danger there is that why my dad is say maybe I want to see what is there now remember one thing in Genesis 2 when God was giving a command or was telling Adam about do not eat he told Adam they can eat of every right it was Adam alone Eve was not created yet so Adam became the first prophet to take the word of God to tell the bride amen amen his Bri so the bride can accept or reject it start right from there so when Satan washed them he watched Adam and Eve he watch their habit when Adam was a away Adam who received the word was a way then he came now he brought the question he said everything that he didn't say oh Eve do you want to eat this fruit he said Can said no no reason but he brought it with a open-ended question he studed what God Said and miss and and and and and and distorted it first of all God never said touch there nowhere God talk to touch but you hear a word like touching coming all right Touch come if you if you can read that if you if you if you see what's going on so what happened is that Satan came quoted everything God said but try to miss try to put an open question ambiguous thing what is that doing when Eve stop it brought even to reasoning is that so or not he brought if to question did Adam tell me everything did Adam hear everything from God because look this is what Satan repeating what God Said but adding few different things but this what Adam said did Adam say did Adam really hear from God if has a question to begin to ask herself did Adam hear anything from God or maybe he didn't you see that open right there yes an Avenue for what happens in your mind and what happen in your heart your heart accept your mind reason question and that's why the prophet will always say that he has to go from here to your heart so same thing here when God called the prophet we were not there there was no bride when God gave him the commission we were not there so the prophet took the word just like Adam to tell the bride that God sent him but today we are we are back exactly to where Eve was did the prophet hear from God or he didn't where the cloud real or not was the pill of fire real or a reflection of some light amen we are back to the same thing amen so when would I have five more minutes now when all right this thing here don't take me longer than that now when your mind is open to reasoning two things are going on your heart either accept or your man question so the question here is that remember if was not there so the when when Satan p the whole picture bringing what Adam she hear from Adam versus other who is the truth did Adam omitted some now what Satan added were there something that maybe God said he omitted and if you see the way God talk about the tree it Satan even repeat the same way now when your mind is open when you begin to question this message then the devil comes in he's not going to change a whole lot he change one so when when Satan begin to realize that if now yes he open up then he change one thing because he knows that when you CH one that said so if you notice God said shall surely not die the serpent said shall not surely die one word so now let's I want us to look at that one word before I leave I have more we won't get there that not in Hebrew is the the you have to read it from right to left I don't know what happened to oh it came back you see this one here that's that God l in Hebrew but now look at the not is the them of God change turn the other way do you know you see that so that's why Jesus told us it will be so close look somebody look if I if I didn't if I didn't tell you about Hebrew you looking at this on the top the one in the red all right my my poter is dying the one in the red I say on the top and the bottom you say the same thing if I come here fly this oh this the same is the same thing is that right so the word that Satan added is if even the name of God turn the other way and that's why amen when God came what happened Adam run the other way from that time on every time so it's you see the you see how the the the red right read it from right no right to left look what is the bottom it like switch so that's the word not in Hebrew and that's the word that Satan added so every time when God came what Adam Adam where what did he do he run away so from that point on was introduced in the race of Adam anything run away from God and that's why brother Bram said no man run to God it's God who comes after you is the mercy of God because of that that introduced the race we always running away from God amen so but now it will take so when we run away from God we are without God next SL let me see what's yeah okay that one and I I will end here then immediately God went to doing the work of redemption what did God do God find Adam kill a lamb now I would like you to look you see the word on the left right look at it and look at the word okay thank you how many word you count there there are four letters right now look at the word on the right how many you count five you hear br br say five five five a j s us now the one on the left is called Gula gulab be Exile you are without God that's what happened to Adam when Adam run away he went to a world without God and the red that's God unified with human with Humanity so when Adam run away Adam went to what we call Gula A word without God so when God came to Adam he brought the lamb killed the lamb to to unify said that's what's going to happen there going to be a Redemption so that on the on the right there that's the word Gula Redemption now you see how close they are only one thing that change what is God coming in the day God save you tell me did you become any taller the day God save you did you be did you become shorter the day God save you did you change anything but what happened God came in now Peter now let's go back to Peter when God breathed on them Peter even in the garden my wife were playing this today uh uh before we came she she she was playing the uh the Bible Peter J didn't deny God he denied god with a note when a Jew present a note you mean that you my life so Peter deny god with his life that mean you can kill me and know I don't know that man amen so when like like let's say Paul and then let say they took a note to go do so now we are de for our life if we don't do that he cannot be killed amen and that's why when the when when when they went to Jericho when they promis okay uhh what what's her name they said that we present with our oath with our life so Peter Peter before Christ came in he was in he was in G and that's why Jesus call Peter do you love me oh I love you Peter do you love yes but God know no you don't have that yet and that the third oh God you know everything amen so he then Jesus told him when you are converted that mean when the Elohim the red comes into you then convert your brothers amen that's about the day of Pentecost when God came in repent and be baptized he can walk and people walk in Shadow he will no more afraid I'll leave you here what I want to tell you is this but how does you get that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so I'll leave you with this there's more I can say but I don't have time to get there if you don't have the Holy Ghost don't don't sleep until you say God fill the Holy Ghost if you are not born again say God I nothing anymore interest me until I'm born again and and fill with don't just be bornn again born again that's the initial step you have to go all the way and be and receive the Holy Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost then you are out of Exile you see Peter here is Peter he received the Revelation who do men say I am thou are the Son of God and what did God said what did Jesus told him is my father right but he was still in Exile that's how you can deny Jesus with a note amen because God hasn't come in he hasn't get to Gila which is redemption amen so and that's what BR Bram said all right when I read that when I saw that when I studed BR Bram said if there is anything I could tell you more if I have the voice of a to tell you the importance of about Holy Ghost that's the best I can give you and when I came to find that I said yet that what was talking about and that's why Peter and them no matter what re they got so no matter what Revelation you get of the message no matter your bapti no matter how many books you read if the Holy Ghost doesn't come in you are in Exile God bless you Shalom brother you see I only told about a few minutes all right God bless you I hope that I have said something that help you tonight Amen brother Israel the Lord hand of praise amen
