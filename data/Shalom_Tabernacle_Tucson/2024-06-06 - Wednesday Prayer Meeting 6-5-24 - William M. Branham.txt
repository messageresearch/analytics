that all things are possible Lord I believe and Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe God bless you you may be seated brother Bren thank very good evening friend very happy to be here tonight and to enjoy this wonderful message as much as I heard of it of brother Tom and I know he's a servant of the Lord God because he has proved it ever since I have knew him and so we're very happy for this message and I hope that it went straight home to every heart and now brother Tom's also he is a a missionary to the 0s in Africa and I thank you're making arrangements to giving him and offerings of uh Le I asked for for his na Mission over there I after being there myself while of course knowing just what it really means to be a missionary I think the type of of mission that brother Toms has is really the correct type see the first thing the Na's just a little suspicious of the white man when he comes to begin with but brother Tom has the idea that the lord gave years ago one time I was reading a little book from a mission field and it was a picture of an old colored man little white rimma hair he said white man white man where was your father said I'm old and dull at mine I'm just learning of Jesus if I would have known him I would have t him to my people that struck me if I would have known him when I was young I would have talking to my people now that is right see the first thing the white man can't even go over the na go he can't live on the same thing and I thought get the native saved and let the native do the missionary itself that's what brother Tom says and at Johannesburg the date when we had 30,000 converts at afternoon after scene which we had time to tell you the story of it when the man heel walk like a dog and led by a chain and when the Lord Jesus began to reveal things in the audience everyone Dr FF BOS many of you knowing he estimated 25,000 healings at one time 25 5,000 got healed at one prayer when theyve seen it and 30,000 got saved at the same time and he uh I said now don't wait until some missionary comes from America I have all respect for them but the thing of it is friend the David lson isn't no more it's got to be somebody get out there and what they is far theology while they bleed on their idols and so forth and just just merely a change of thought but when they see God moving in his power that's what changes the Navy and I said don't wait for your education go on out and tell your Navy friends that Jesus died for them and I got a piece out of a dering paper that one man who didn't even know which is right in left hand was baptizing as many as a thousand week Naes out in the jungles out in the the field that's it he he didn't even know which was right and left hand but he knew that he had got healed and Jesus loved him and he was telling his NY friends theying right down water and baptized and Justice they come so that is wonderful so while you're supporting or helping in this offering for brother Tom for his na missions over there I'll say with all my heart I think it's a worthy thing a very good thing God will bless you for your help and giv to it there times never asked me to say this I just I just said it because it's it's worthy of everything that we can give to help it out and now I didn't know whether brother V year here here's brother deer sitting here he's taking tape recordings I think and Es deer a veteran of the the last war got hurt overseas hand blowed off and he come home gave his heart to the Lord Jesus very consecrated man and evangelist he's my neighbor my buddy CH to me his family his wife a very dear woman when brother beer first was born again and received a Holy Spirit if I get it wrong brother dealer well I don't aim you I think I'm right your wife she belonged to a certain church that didn't believe that so brother beer just let her alone just went on and kept praying for her and one night in the night he couldn't make it till morning he had to wake him up and then she got right with God you know what that's a good thing you just be salty God will produce The Thirst if you he said you you just be salty brother beer would you stand up just a moment brother beer is a personal friend of mine and Advan a very dear brother brother esel dealer and I think his wife and babies are on the ground here somewhere very good friends and usually I have to preach when I come in and don't get a chance God bless you brother deer now to someone else here is a friend of mine brother uh Leo Mercer he's from up in Michigan and he comes from that badger state of believe up there course you can be forgiven for that you know from being from Michigan and um a very fine boy him and shean gold another Chum bosom friends I call them my students they're a missionary boys studying for missionary they come along in the meetings and take tape recordings and so forth you boys stand that just a minute Two Fine Christian Brothers this

to find out just what's taking place to see these man they have in here and you have a tape recorder brother Woods I don't see him nowhere yes he is sitting over here my brother Woods is a very personal friend of mine how I come to meet brother the woods he was at the Houston meeting when this picture was taken when the angel of Lord came in and he's a contractor and he was a little short of money so a thought I had a barn to fix or he run fix the barn before I got enough money to go to Houston and what he had he had a boy his legs brought up under him and he I didn't know him he's just set the crowd many many times larger than this well we went on up East and brother Woods just followed us up and one night while his faithful wife who's with us tonight the book salesman and the boy was sitting out in the audience praying the Holy Spirit turned around and told the woman all about her told her she had a son sitting there was but that thus sayith the Lord he heal the boys on the ground tonight somewhere just as Nimble and no more crippled than any of the best walking people is on the ground not a sign of it nowhere God healed him made him well brother would just give up his contracting business goes with me just to fiddle around sh books and help me and besides that he moved over in Indiana and bought a place right next to me and we really ched brother Woods would you said at this minute brother Woods I don't know where his wife is she's probably out at the bookst somewhere and the boys here somewhere David where you at would you stand up just a minute son a boy that was crippled his legs all up under him I wonder if he's standing on the ground somewhere now he's probably running around here he Billy are quite Chum I don't team just at the time but we'll have him come up maybe and walk up the platforms he's bash for just a little country boy like myself and he he's signed backward so he he around here somewhere had his leg dra under him and the Lord healed him instantly so we're thankful for that isn't he good to us he's worthy of all the praise and everything our brother Oregon brde I have never seen him yet I don't know whether he's ever come yet or not go Jack Mo I don't know if they're in the crowd I hope they stand up go I I've been looking for him for some time they're both supposed to be here two three days ago and um so um we are looking to see them anytime now tomorrow night how would you like to have a night and just uh have a relaxation and let our Minister Brothers help us pray for the sick would you like that everybody just let you see that the Lord God he answers prayer for the ministry brother too and we it's not only evangelist who comes in and pray for sick God will the prayer of any sincere person that'll pray always like to have a night when the preacher is represented after all when of evangelist E Town if he keeps the congregation around himself well then what's the poor Pastor got when he leaves the people think well the pastor he just remember he's just as much man of God as any evangelist or anything else on the field he's the real true man of God and we like to see them represented here and it let you see that God answers prayer for them I was just thinking coming home last night or uh they let me stay just a little long last night and brother woods and Billy was apologizing way into the night nearly 12:00 about doing it and staying a little long it's something or another I can't explain it friends I wish I could there's no need of even trying it but it just seeming like you're way up about a million miles in air and then you dropped back down to Earth again all at once that's an awful feeling but what does it denote there is a high Rim that we can climb we're going higher someday and um they was telling about something about now the meetings to me the only way I know them is someone to tell me or to pick up one of these tapes I get these tapes also and they're kept for references out of each meeting that I hear the tape over and I hear how the service went but to me it's a dream and then there's something about a colored man there something there laying on a cop or stretcher or something walking and just remind me sometime ago at Dallas I've been over to Dallas for a meeting this a short word now before we call the line I've been over to Dallas for a meeting and well on the road back the airplane got caught into a storm and I had to land at Memphis Tennessee and they take me up to that big famous hotel there which myself it's a good thing the airlines had a because I couldn't stay in that hotel it was um I forget skab body hotel and so they told me they' to call me the next morning give me a room in there to stay all night and they called me the next morning so I could go on time catch the plane so I said that's fine and I went upstairs went to bed after there praying a while wrote some letters and the next morning I got up early and way before Sun up and they they told me the plane was going to leave at the limine would come by and pick us up at 8:00 it's about 6:30 I thought I got plenty of time I'll sit down mail this post that I've got here and put it away and then I'll go down catch the limousine get them planning go on home I started out that morning I prayed quite a while got up early I at the meeting kind of nervous and shaky all tight know and so forth just show you the Sovereign Grace of God then going down the street I was going down the street sanging one of those little songs that you Pentecostal people sing Oh what's the name of this glad I can say I'm one of them I believe that's said yeah people all got in the upper room filled with the Holy Ghost and and he did for them that day he'll do for you the same you know know what it's a that's what song I was trying to get in my mind I was going down the street singing it to myself you know the people gathered in the upper room and all want a card and was praying and Jesus came in power something and I trying to get all fcked out I started across the street and when I started across the street the holy spirit said stoping minut I thought now what so I went started across again something just kept me from sing acrossing I turned into one side there a little old place where this a bunch of Po post like like this and I was praying I Lord what would you have me to do he said turn and go back just keep walking that was just as plain not just as in your mind I heard it there he was that light whirling so I just turned and went back I walked on past the old walked on and on and on and on and I kept on walking I looked down my watch it about 10 minutes to 8 I just kept on walking he just said walk so that's all I know to do is keep walking I got way down on the river down where there's a lot of kind poor people live down in there and I kept on walking a little farther farther I thought my got out into the color District just kept on going down along that way way down in the lower part there somewhere walking along after a while I was kind huming a little song to might only believe all things are possible only believe I look hanging out over a little old colored person's house house there kind of whitewashed had a gate there there an old typical ank jamama with a with a a man shirt tied around her head and she was leaning across the gate like this no probably as far out as that PO there I just kind of humming as I seen her looking at me I just quit humming started to pass by her big fat cheek she WIP the tears out of her eyes she said good morning Parson I looked at her and I said ma'am she said I said good morning now up in Tennessee a preachers a paron I don't know whether it is you colored folks here or not but said good morning Parson I stopped I said how did you know I was a par yeah I thought isn't this strange something began to move maybe this is it what the Lord want me to walk down part so I said how how' you know I was a Parson she said well Parson said when I see you coming she said I know you was a Parson and she said did you ever read that story in the Bible Parson about the shunamite woman who she couldn't have any children and Elijah the prophet went and blessed her and she had the baby I said yes ma'am she said well I was that kind of woman and she said I prayed to the Lord and she said and uh I told the Lord if he'd give me a child I would raise it to love him and honor him she said I a wash woman she said I I wash for living she said then you know when my baby got to be a man said he big boy said he got out with the wrong company part and said he took a horrible disease he said I didn't know it and said he got so far gone until the doctor man says he can't live no more and said he's in there in the house and he's been dying since yesterday and says he don't know where he's at and he's just groaning and said I just can't stand to see my baby die baby 180 pounds about that I just can't see my baby die but remember that was baby to her to her mother right no matter what you are what you do it's still your baby if you're a real mother and so she said I just couldn't stand to see my baby die in that condition knowing that I had promised the Lord to raise him uh to serve the Lord and she said I prayed all night last night and she said I said Lord what can I do now and so said the first thing you know I went to sleep and I dreamed a dream and said I seen a man coming with a tan suit on wearing a tan hat and said the Lord said here's my part and she said that was about 3:00 when I woke up she she said I've been standing here ever since a waiting for you I believe I got the trans position on this maybe and I said I've been standing here since 3:00 awaiting for you well when I went over there that poor old thing was still wet on her back where she been standing out there and she said I've been waiting here since 3:00 to see and said when I see you coming down the Street you're the same man I saw in the dream and I know you was the part and she said won't you come in and when she opened up the gate little chain hanging to it and I walked into that little colored person's house that morning there was no rug on the floor just a little little iron beded but I tell you if I ever walked into the presence of God I did there there was no pinup on the wall there's a little picture hanging over the door saying God bless our home clean and I looked around laying on the little iron bed was a great big Husky fell he had the the the quilt in his hand like this the blanket brother he's going and I said what I said good morning young man she said Parson he don't know nothing said he hasn't know us for two days so all he talks about he says he's out in a big deep sea and it's all dark and he's lost and she started crying and she said if I could only hear him say that he was saved said I'd be willing to give him up and so I said well has the doctors done said they can't do nothing for him Parson he's too far gone it was stic and um said it's too far gone it's done eat his heart out hold to it I said there's nothing to be done for him I said Auntie do you know what my

'w you pray with me she said yes sir and when we knelt down there that morning that little old humble home I've been in four King's palaces praying for them King George of England and Gusto and so forth I've been in some of the best homes there is in the nation but I never was any more welcome than I was in that little Shany that morning when she made me welcome I knelt down on the floor I looked over at her I said ay would you lead in prayer she said yes Parson and a prayer that would make your her s on the back of your neck to hear that poor old pained woman those big black pets in the tears running down how she pleaded out to God God don't let my baby die let me hear him say one time that he sa Lord I his M will be satisfied I thought God bless her poor old heart she raised up began to wipe her eyes I Bel his feet cold and sticky he kep one said oh it's so dark and so I knelt down laid my hands over on the boy's feet and I said I'll pray now handy and I said Heavenly Father here it is after 9:00 the plane's done gone I said and I don't know you told me to come down here and the only thing I know to do was to walk if this is the place that you sent me I pray that you'll hear the prayer and will answer for this poor woman and you know what he began to go he said mmy oh M he said he's getting light in the room and about five minutes from men he was sitting on the bed

and we pray that you'll think it deep into every hearts and now as we call the prayer line I ask thee heavenly father that in thy mercy and Grace that you will do something tonight exceedingly abundantly and give us a great outpouring of thy blessings and may all that's unbelievers become Believers tonight May those that are backslid become saved and those without the Holy Spirit be borned again of the spirit of God and every sick person made well for we ask it in his name amen oh how wonderful he is no wonder eyes not seen ears not heard as near the heart of man what God has for those

know I wish i' sometime come back and stay a month for a Revival just keep it going preaching and moving on now there's a bunch of prayer cards I believe where is silly uh what was the oh here are all right we got play card RS give out tonight look on your little card it's just a little up there by the way I never prayed for these handkerchiefs last evening and I want to do it tonight and then I will tell you maybe tomorrow night when we have more time just on what to do about these how to stand to the place and get them now it's a little card something like this here and uh on the back of it it's got a r and then it'll be 1 to 100 now we can't get all them up here on the platform wish I could C that but I can't and anyone coming up doesn't mean they're going to be healed it's just that this is not a show now it's not a stage show it's a religious meeting see the Holy Spirit but it's a Vindication of the presence of the omnipotent and Omission God that's in his presence doing the same thing that he is there any New Comers here for the first time let's see my just look that's what see each night it to explain how that the Lord Jesus let me read just a scripture before we call it s just a moment here's one right here turned right to it in St John the 5th chapter and let's begin at the 33rd verse you sent unto John and he bear witness of the truth but I receive not the testimony from man but the things that I say that you might be saved he was a burning and a Shining Light and you were willing first a season to walk in that life but I have a greater witness than that of John for The Works which the father has given me to do and to finish the same that I do bear witness to me that the father has sent me and the father himself which has sent me has borne life of me now think of it what did Jesus do when he was here on Earth what he did when he was here on Earth if he has he died to save us then returned back into the spirit form he's the same yesterday today and forever he did not claim to be a Healer he only claimed to be able to do what the father showed him by Vision how many Bible readers know that the truth B see Jesus said in St John 5:24 verely verely I say unto you as is passed by a great multitude of people lame H blind and withered he he one man lay on a pallet might have had a prosate trouble or something I don't you know something was had it 38 years it wasn't going to kill him but he healed him because God had showed him to go to that person the scripture plainly states that and he said he knew where he was knew he had been in this condition all this time walked away and let the multitude he was questioned that's when he said really barely I say you the son can do nothing in but what he sees the father doing that doth the son likewise when Philip found theel brought him back to show him that he had found the Messiah thought when he walked up into the crowd Jesus looked out and said behold an Israelite whom there's no G that when did you know me Rabbi he said before Philip called you when he under the tree I saw you he said thou the Son of God the king of Israel go to the woman at the well he told her where sins was and so forth he's the same Lord Jesus tonight I believe that and now by the brother preaching the gospel declaring that he is now he will come in his August blessing and come around over us and will declare the same that he is risen from the dead then we are to receive him don't you think so all are to worship him no matter many of you probably will be called up and let's see let's begin somewhere what was that now what was that letter RS RS all right excuse me let's start from 75 tonight you see we we've been starting ones and 15s and 20s and 50s and has anybody got r75

father they blazed the road they've taken the stump and pull back the Bri now their children are running happily down the highway enjoying these blesses now Heavenly Father we pray that you'll come tonight great Jehovah God send the Lord Jesus tonight and may him in his resurrected power move now and declare that he has raised from the dead that these people might know that our faith is not in vain our hopes is not in vain that he Shar literally the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead doing the same things as he promised that he would do in his church until he come again forgive us of our many sins and help us tonight Lord as we set our face at to Calvary May the angel of God come and anoint thy servant and anoint every servant in here and may my lips be circumcised and my eyes be circumcised to speak and see the things that you'd want me to know and may ever heart and ear be circumcised to receive for we ask it in Jesus name amen now before we start just on the handkerchief Heavenly Father the handkerchiefs are here poor sick needy people maybe some little old mother and dad laying out there in a little cabin and I BL can't see across the floor they're waiting for this hand to come some mother walk in the floor with a baby in her arms waiting for the h to return God you know all about it now they brought them to me now in the Bible days they brought to St Paul handkerchiefs and aprons for they knew that he was your servant that they might take off of his body handkerchiefs and aprons they were sent to the sick and Afflicted and they were now father we know we're not St Paul but we know that you're still Jesus and it wasn't St Paul at all it was you Lord and the people's faith in your servant and now Lord we bless these handkerchiefs and they are laid upon the bodies of the saint may it be the same as when God gave this promise it's not a man's promise it's God's promise and one time when the Red Sea had Israel cut off from the promised land the riter said God look down through that Pillar of Fire with angered eyes and the Le sea got scared moved back and Israel went on to the promised land god when these ANS are placed upon the sick May Eyes Of God look down through the blood of Jesus tonight and may the enemy that's finding the sick people these H represent may he get scared and move back may the people move on towards the promised land with good health and strength for promise for the gospel and our Lord Jesus Christ or we ask it in his name amen all right got them all now what say all about 100 number 100 if anybody finds the

patience oh [Music] God now in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I take every Spirit around here under my control for the glory of God and to you out there who has my prayer card don't wa for you get up here without prayer cards and want Jesus Christ to heal you would you raise up your hand just look everywhere now I say this if he comes in his anointing power see it isn't I don't do this there's nothing I can do about it you're the one who does it it's your faith that does it this is just a gift when God wants to show me a video he just comes down and picks me up and shows me the whole thing how it's go to be then I come tell the people and that's just what happens never has failed I'm 46 years old it never fails not one time ask anybody you ever seen but now you yourself you are Christians and you pull that gift out see it isn't me it's your faith that does it if you don't have no faith there's nothing can be done it's your faith that operates the gift just like Christ when he was here on Earth he was this little gift that needs just like a spoonful out of the ocean out here and Christ is like the whole ocean but remember the same tentacles that's in that the foods in the whole ocean CL see it's just not as much of it see so it's a that's that's the way a gift of God is now it's your your faith that operates the gift the woman touched His Garment Jesus never said oh no he said thy faith has made the whole see your faith does it it was her faith that did it and it's your faith that does it now to this woman here God might not say one thing to her now is there anybody everybody along that line here strangers to me you're standing here if you are raise up your hands everybody that's strangers to me that's all the way down the line how many out there strangers to me let's raise up your hands everywhere I don't know one of you the only ones that I know in this audience tonight God in heaven knows just what I've introduced besides my boy here that's the only ones that I know but now God knows every one of you now in the Supernatural realm may the Lord grant His blessings is my prayer now sister if you I just come a little near this way if you will just so I can keep you out of line of other people you are you are a human being but yet you're a spirit too if you didn't handle Spirit you'd be dead so every time when you see a an automobile going down the road that automobile is operated by a spirit represented in a body see now I'm not dealing with your body I'm dealing with the spirit like when when life gos out of a tumor I'm not dealing with that gross tumor I'm dealing with that life in that gr it's a separate life from the person who has it or a cancer or cataract or whatever disease it is now we're standing here as two human beings never met in our lives before perfect total strangers to one another and you're standing here's a woman is a man a very beautiful picture to begin with tonight like our lord Jesus and not taking his place but I mean that he's here you see and the woman at the well of Samaria not you taking her place but it's just a man and a woman been and talking now he talked to her for quite a while until he caught the conversation till he found out what was wrong with her found her spirit and then God showed him what was wrong and he told her he said he said uh go get your husband he said I don't have any said you said well because you got five and he who you now have is not your husband in that thou said us well and she said I perceive that you are a prophet he said I know when Messiah cometh he'll do these things but who are you as a the prophet he said I'm the Messiah so that was the sign of the Messiah then it's the sign of the Messiah today and if he would come here now in the person of you and I and would come in our body and would perform the same thing he did for that woman at the well would you believe it would be the sign of the Messiah would you accept it that way will the audience recept accept it that way the sign of the Messiah I may he granted for his glory and for his word sake not that we're worthy but for his word now the lady standing there talking with her just looking at her you don't have to answer me rather she wouldn't but just to catch her spirit get her single because it's coming from everywhere but uh the Lord may not say one thing to me about the woman she realized she's in his presence she knows it's not me that feeling that she has right now just moving on her is that cloud settles between her and I she knows that that's not a man she knows it only can come from God and now I want you to look this away lady and just believe with all your heart it's the only way I have of helping you to know more of the Lord Jesus not knowing what you're here for knowing nothing about you but God does know but as the lady begins to notice She's suffering with a tremendous nervous condition and that nervous condition is very very bad now I see her trying to hold on to things she drops things all time she's having the Spells of gets worse on her at times and especially in the middle of the day look like when she's trying to wash dishes or something she's dropping them but she's the trouble of it is she's her trouble is in her back it's her spinal condition that's making her trouble and the woman also is suffering with something that
