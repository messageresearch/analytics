[47:33] everything on okay fine thank you I
[47:37] would like to greet you all in the
[47:38] wonderful name of the Lord and Savior
[47:40] Jesus Christ I'm so thrilled to be with
[47:44] you and I'm thankful to your pastor for
[47:47] allowing me to be with you tonight we
[47:51] have not met we have heard of one
[47:54] another being members of the body Body
[47:57] of Christ and uh it's good today that we
[48:00] are able to see one another and to
[48:03] fellowship with you all and I as you've
[48:06] heard I am from the United Kingdom in
[48:11] the city of Sheffield we have a group
[48:14] there and we would like to really
[48:19] appreciate the Lord for helping us to do
[48:21] the little part that we are doing to
[48:24] handun for that last one before we all
[48:27] go
[48:28] home but uh obviously I I am now British
[48:34] but I don't look
[48:36] British which is true because I am
[48:39] originally from Zimbabwe so I am much
[48:43] Zimbabwean and still Zimbabwean and will
[48:46] forever be
[48:48] Zimbabwean only that I am a born again
[48:51] Zimbabwe and which makes me I hope a
[48:54] blessing to all of you who are born
[48:55] again so I thank God that I some of you
[49:00] who don't know me may just want maybe
[49:03] just 3 minutes of knowing who who I am
[49:07] but my real identity will take us a
[49:11] while to explain because it was from
[49:14] before the foundation of the
[49:17] world but I thank God I was raised up in
[49:19] a Christian family my mother uh and
[49:23] father were both in the Methodist Church
[49:27] I don't know much about my father
[49:29] because he he died when I was just 3
[49:32] years old and I'm just told he was just
[49:36] um a nominal Christian not too committed
[49:39] but my mother was very very committed
[49:42] she raised us up in the fear of God and
[49:45] I thank God for that so later on in life
[49:49] when I was about 20 years old I made my
[49:51] own decision to really be born again and
[49:55] live a victory glorious life in Christ
[49:58] and so when I did that it was
[50:01] 1977 I gave my life completely to God
[50:05] and had the victory the new birth and uh
[50:10] that same year I was led to the message
[50:13] of the hour and I always thank God that
[50:15] I came in in a very good year 19
[50:20] 1977 I think some of the oldtimers would
[50:23] know that a lot of people even left the
[50:26] message message in
[50:28] 1977 by failure to understand spiritual
[50:32] things but that's when we came in and
[50:35] straight away the Lord called me into
[50:37] the ministry I found my wife three years
[50:41] later we're in the same church all
[50:45] zealous young people and uh we just we
[50:49] just married and That Was
[50:52] 1980 and so we've been together ever
[50:55] since and we have have lived Happy Ever
[50:58] After and intend to do so until Christ
[51:01] comes and through life God has blessed
[51:05] us with seven children I think that's a
[51:08] great achievement trying to walk in the
[51:10] steps of Abraham the father of
[51:13] Nations seven children four girls and
[51:16] three boys and I'm so thankful to the
[51:19] Lord they are all married now got all
[51:21] their own their own families now and um
[51:25] uh where when I first started in the
[51:28] ministry the Lord led me to go to mutari
[51:31] which is a town in Zimbabwe right on the
[51:34] eastern border close to mosm so that's
[51:37] where I went there started the church
[51:39] with the help of the Holy Ghost and
[51:41] brothers who were also there God helped
[51:44] us to start that work there in that part
[51:47] of the country and the Lord just blessed
[51:50] the work so much it's uh it's amazing
[51:53] how the message out there in Africa
[51:56] still excites people and God is still
[51:59] calling and people still are responding
[52:03] to the call of the message even right
[52:05] now maybe now it's not so much in the
[52:08] cities but out in the country we have
[52:10] such a such a pool people are receiving
[52:13] the message and some of the Miracles and
[52:17] things are happening out there that's
[52:20] where God is is vindicating Mark 16 he
[52:23] says go preach the gospel all the well
[52:26] these signs shall
[52:28] follow and so many churches sprung from
[52:31] that little church in from
[52:34] 1981 when I went to
[52:37] mutari and um uh I Then I then uh uh
[52:42] later on also God helped us to go into
[52:45] mosek which is close to muari is right
[52:49] on the on the eastern border with mosic
[52:52] that's in the eastern part of of
[52:53] Zimbabwe so the Lord helped us to
[52:55] introduce the message there we're able
[52:58] to go into Mana a city which is closed
[53:01] and then into also chimo right into Baya
[53:05] and right now today the whole country
[53:08] the messages spread just like a wildfire
[53:11] and we want to really thank God for that
[53:14] and um um so later on after 17 years of
[53:17] pastoring there I am more on the
[53:20] Evangelistic calling I I I travel I
[53:23] preach and so on and so I felt a
[53:26] building to go back to Harari where I
[53:28] had started from and went and started
[53:31] the church in another part there and
[53:33] today that church is still there
[53:36] thriving and I'm I'm I frequent that
[53:39] church also even the church in mutari as
[53:42] the one who started the work I'm always
[53:45] looking and kind like overseeing it and
[53:47] sort of just seeing if things are going
[53:49] on and when we have conventions and
[53:51] things like that they always want me to
[53:54] be there and uh so I want to to thank
[53:56] God that over the years God has really
[53:59] blessed us 7 years I worked in Harari
[54:01] then 17 years ago I went to the UK the
[54:06] we had a few Believers that had left our
[54:08] country because of the economic problems
[54:11] there some relocated and so I also felt
[54:14] a burden just to help them out there and
[54:17] so God helped us to start a fellowship
[54:19] there in in sherfield and um that's
[54:22] where I'm now stationed so I want to
[54:25] thank God that is about it all I think I
[54:28] could I I could share so many
[54:30] testimonies also but we don't have much
[54:32] time being an evening service if I put
[54:35] in too many testimonies then I I won't
[54:37] be able even to say anything so I would
[54:40] like at least for you to know me by what
[54:42] I believe as well that's real Fellowship
[54:45] you know sometimes the testimonies are
[54:47] okay but they can be given by anybody
[54:50] sometimes people who believe strange
[54:52] things can share very very edifying
[54:55] testimonies sometimes so I think the
[54:57] word is most important don't you think
[55:00] so it makes us know one another better
[55:02] and appreciate one another and so I'm
[55:05] thankful I was preaching this morning in
[55:07] Phoenix um I mean
[55:10] um uh uh what's that little town there
[55:13] yes in Cottonwood and uh with brother uh
[55:18] uh Chris Long there and so we had to
[55:21] drive to this place for this service
[55:23] which really is nothing new for me
[55:26] my life has been just like that I would
[55:29] preach in mu in the morning and then
[55:32] drive 3 hours to Harari and preach again
[55:36] there so I would preach in the morning
[55:38] drive 3 hours preach again and sometimes
[55:41] come back to M on a Wednesday preach go
[55:44] back to harar for the Thursday meeting
[55:46] and come back to M for a Friday meeting
[55:49] and and then that has been my life so I
[55:52] am very comfortable with that but well
[55:55] that was when I was younger
[55:58] now I've got I've got 17
[56:03] grandchildren 17 that means I've been
[56:06] around for a while and and and and and
[56:11] and so if I came in the message in 1977
[56:14] and 20 years old you can figure how old
[56:17] I am 1977 when I came in I was 20 years
[56:21] old how old do you think I am I am quite
[56:24] an old man but because of the Lord he
[56:27] gives us new Strength amen I'm just I
[56:31] just turned 58 I mean 68
[56:35] 68
[56:36] 68 but I would pass for 58 I guess
[56:40] especially if I start
[56:42] preaching so the Lord bless you let's
[56:44] stand at this time I'll make sure that I
[56:46] don't take any more time than is
[56:48] necessary for a Sunday evening service
[56:50] if you have a request if you have a need
[56:53] I believe the holy spirit is here to to
[56:56] minister directly to our needs and the
[56:59] preaching of the Gospel is not complete
[57:02] without the healing of the sick without
[57:04] God manifesting himself in the power of
[57:07] his resurrection and he gave us the
[57:09] Blessed promise whatever two or three
[57:12] gathered in my name I'm in the midst of
[57:14] them and he says whatsoever things we
[57:17] desire when we pray if we can believe
[57:21] that we receive it in prayer God will
[57:23] give it to us so let us pray you can
[57:25] raise your hand if you would like to be
[57:27] remembered in prayer God sees your hand
[57:30] I see it too and if it touches me to
[57:32] know that you have a desire how much
[57:34] more does it touch our heavenly father
[57:37] shall we pray Heavenly Father our hands
[57:40] are raised up because we are needy
[57:41] people we pray that you meet with us
[57:44] tonight thanking you for the wonderful
[57:46] songs that have been sung thanking you
[57:49] for the open door from our pastor here
[57:51] Lord for me to be here tonight in
[57:53] service to you we thank you so much now
[57:56] Lord may you bless each one give them
[57:58] their heart desires that they will say
[58:01] from that day things changed and it was
[58:05] never the same again we want to thank
[58:07] you in advance for Healing The Sick we
[58:10] thank you in advance for granting the
[58:12] request of your children bless your word
[58:15] bless our fellowship forgive us of all
[58:18] our shortcomings father and fear us with
[58:20] your presence for we ask it in Jesus
[58:22] name amen I wish to read from Matthew
[58:26] chapter
[58:27] 16 and I would like to speak on the
[58:29] mystery of who Jesus is the mystery of
[58:33] who Jesus is we thank God that in the
[58:35] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[58:38] the mystery of God is finished so we can
[58:42] answer those questions the mystery of
[58:44] who Jesus is basing it upon the
[58:46] scripture in Matthew 16: 13 to verse 19
[58:51] when Jesus came into the course of
[58:53] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[58:56] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[58:59] man am and they said some say that thou
[59:03] art John the Baptist there some Elias
[59:05] and others
[59:07] Jeremiah or one of the prophets he say
[59:12] unto them but whom say ye that I am and
[59:15] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[59:18] the Christ the son of the Living God
[59:22] Amen may the Lord bless the reading of
[59:24] his word
[59:26] you may be
[59:28] seated the fact that he
[59:30] was the son of the Living God is what
[59:35] prompted him to ask
[59:38] them who do men say that I
[59:41] am if he had not been the Son of God he
[59:44] would have not even asked them that
[59:46] question because there would have been
[59:48] no need to ask that question you would
[59:51] have been just a normal person but
[59:54] because there was a m history
[59:56] surrounding him he wanted to be sure
[1:00:00] that people had the correct revelation
[1:00:02] of who he was so he says who do men say
[1:00:05] that I the son of man am he was a
[1:00:08] mystery he was born in a mysterious way
[1:00:12] we know he was the seed of the woman
[1:00:14] promised from Genesis 3 where the Bible
[1:00:17] says they are put enmity between thee
[1:00:19] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:00:21] her seed we know also that he was the
[1:00:26] Virgin born son of Mary who came by the
[1:00:30] Immaculate Conception as we read in
[1:00:33] Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 before they
[1:00:36] came together before Joseph and Mary
[1:00:39] came together she was found with child
[1:00:41] of the Holy Ghost that's strange that's
[1:00:43] a mystery that doesn't happen unless
[1:00:46] there's something behind it some
[1:00:48] Supernatural hand so he was a mystery
[1:00:51] before Joseph and Mary came together
[1:00:53] Mary was found child with with child of
[1:00:56] the Holy Ghost it took an angel to come
[1:00:58] and intervene for Joseph could not just
[1:01:02] take Mary's story that she met an Angel
[1:01:06] that's how mysterious his birth was
[1:01:08] Joseph was about just to even put her
[1:01:11] away and then the angel had to come and
[1:01:14] say to him no don't do that on verse 20
[1:01:17] of Matthew 1 for that which is conceived
[1:01:20] in her is of the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:01:22] Ghost so he was born in a mysterious way
[1:01:26] and that's why he was asking who do men
[1:01:28] say that I am because he realized he
[1:01:32] came in a strange in a mysterious way
[1:01:34] and he wanted to be sure that they all
[1:01:36] knew who he was especially his disciples
[1:01:39] especially those who were predestinated
[1:01:41] especially those that he was coming to
[1:01:44] die for and to redeem he didn't want to
[1:01:47] miss their opportunity of redemption and
[1:01:51] salvation in him and so Matthew goes on
[1:01:54] to tell us that that this is what was
[1:01:56] written
[1:01:57] there um uh all this was done that it
[1:02:01] could be fulfilled spoken by the prophet
[1:02:03] that a virgin shall be with child and
[1:02:06] you shall call his name Emmanuel which
[1:02:08] is God With Us now in Luke chapter one
[1:02:12] when Gabriel came again to Mary Mary
[1:02:15] said how can these things be seeing I
[1:02:17] know not a man how can I have a child
[1:02:20] because Gabriel says you are going to
[1:02:22] conceive and bring forth a son and the
[1:02:25] angel on verse 35 answered and said the
[1:02:28] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[1:02:32] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:02:35] thee and I want you to know today you
[1:02:37] may be having a difficult situation
[1:02:40] something that's you don't know how you
[1:02:43] can even go around it or about it I want
[1:02:45] to let you know that if the Holy Ghost
[1:02:48] comes upon you and if the Holy Ghost
[1:02:51] anoints you he will change the situation
[1:02:55] he was a virgin little girl that never
[1:02:58] been married never lived with a man how
[1:03:01] can these things be the answer was the
[1:03:03] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee let's
[1:03:07] allow the Holy Ghost to come upon us
[1:03:09] tonight when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:03:11] you he heals your diseases when he comes
[1:03:15] upon you he dissolves all your mind
[1:03:18] battles and all your questions and he
[1:03:21] makes you a completely new creature in
[1:03:23] Christ Jesus so the Holy Ghost shall
[1:03:25] over sh then watch what he says there
[1:03:27] and that Holy thing that Holy thing
[1:03:30] because the Holy Ghost is coming upon
[1:03:33] you that product will be a holy thing
[1:03:36] and that Holy thing sh that shall be
[1:03:38] born of thee shall be called The Son of
[1:03:42] God now watch what the angel is telling
[1:03:46] telling Mary and watch what the answer
[1:03:50] of Peter was to Jesus Peter said Thou
[1:03:54] Art the Christ
[1:03:56] son of the Living God and Jesus said
[1:03:59] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:04:01] unto you but my Father which is in
[1:04:03] heaven but do you notice how that
[1:04:05] Peter's Revelation was in line with the
[1:04:08] word he he just did not say thou art the
[1:04:12] son of the Living God without any
[1:04:14] scriptural backing to that amen his
[1:04:18] answer to who Christ was was scriptural
[1:04:21] amen that's what Gabriel said that hold
[1:04:26] thing shall be called The Son of God and
[1:04:30] that is why he was a mystery because he
[1:04:32] was the son of a God who is a
[1:04:37] mystery God himself is a mystery and if
[1:04:41] he be the son of a mysterious God he
[1:04:44] also was
[1:04:46] mysterious and if you are a son is we
[1:04:50] are sons of God today who is a
[1:04:54] mysterious God it makes as also
[1:04:57] mysterious people will not understand us
[1:05:00] your neighbors will never understand you
[1:05:02] your unbelieving parents will never un
[1:05:04] understand you your workmates will never
[1:05:06] un understand you because you are a
[1:05:08] child of a God who is a
[1:05:12] mystery only those who are also
[1:05:16] Mysteries can understand you amen amen
[1:05:20] only Mysteries can understand
[1:05:23] Mysteries yes so who do men say I the of
[1:05:26] man what does the public say about me
[1:05:30] what's the public opinion about Jesus of
[1:05:33] Nazar now the public had different
[1:05:35] opinions some say you are John the
[1:05:37] Baptist and some say you are Elijah some
[1:05:40] say you are Jeremiah some say some are
[1:05:43] the prophet now those people who thought
[1:05:45] Jesus were Jeremiah missed their
[1:05:48] salvation those who thought Jesus was
[1:05:51] Isaiah they missed their salvation
[1:05:54] because Jeremiah was not a savior
[1:05:56] neither was Isaiah a savior those who
[1:05:58] thought Christ was John the Baptist they
[1:06:00] missed their salvation right there
[1:06:03] because John the Baptist was not a
[1:06:04] savior so how could Jesus save someone
[1:06:09] who thought that he was Jeremiah he
[1:06:12] could not do it and only Those whom he
[1:06:15] came to save the elected the
[1:06:18] predestinated the for ordained would be
[1:06:22] given by the Father the correct
[1:06:24] revelation of who Christ
[1:06:27] was public opinions this is why when he
[1:06:31] was active in his ministry the Bible
[1:06:33] tells us in John 7 on verse 12 and there
[1:06:37] was much memor among the people
[1:06:40] concerning him for some said he is a
[1:06:43] good man others said nay but he
[1:06:46] deceiveth the people he always caused a
[1:06:50] stir in his ministry because he was a
[1:06:53] mystery in on verse 40 of John 7 it says
[1:06:58] many of the people therefore when they
[1:06:59] heard this saying said of a truth this
[1:07:03] is the prophet others said this is the
[1:07:06] Christ but some said shall Christ come
[1:07:09] out of Galilee hath not the scripture
[1:07:11] said that Christ cometh of the seed of
[1:07:13] David and out of the town of Bethlehem
[1:07:16] where David was watch it on verse 43 so
[1:07:20] there was a division among the people
[1:07:23] because of him he always brings a
[1:07:25] division among the people the word will
[1:07:28] bring a division the message will bring
[1:07:30] a division Mysteries will always bring a
[1:07:33] division and guess what that's why we
[1:07:35] have so many
[1:07:37] divisions because people lack the
[1:07:40] revelation of the mystery of who Jesus
[1:07:43] Christ is there was a division because
[1:07:47] of him I like the scripture there was a
[1:07:49] division because of him John chapter 9
[1:07:52] on verse 16 therefore said some of the
[1:07:55] phes says this man is not of God because
[1:07:58] he keepeth not the Sabbath day others
[1:08:01] said how can a man that is a sinner do
[1:08:04] such Miracles that's in chapter nine now
[1:08:08] and there was a division among them
[1:08:11] again a division among them because the
[1:08:13] word will always divide unless you get a
[1:08:17] revelation unless you get the same
[1:08:18] Revelation the reason that you can
[1:08:20] receive me today and receive my
[1:08:23] preaching today is because we are
[1:08:24] standing on the same platform of the
[1:08:27] same Revelation the same message the
[1:08:30] same Prophet the same Holy Ghost the
[1:08:33] same anointing I can say something here
[1:08:35] we've never met I say something you can
[1:08:37] say Amen brother because we are just
[1:08:40] operating on the same
[1:08:42] level we are not strangers one to the
[1:08:46] other we were together before the
[1:08:48] foundation of the world we were together
[1:08:50] in the mind of God praising God our
[1:08:53] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:08:56] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:08:58] we've met before that's why we can have
[1:09:01] fellowship and rejoice together like
[1:09:03] this tonight so there was a division
[1:09:05] among the people uh because Christ was a
[1:09:08] mystery now let's go to John chapter 10
[1:09:10] on verse 19 to verse um to verse 21 it
[1:09:14] says there there was a division
[1:09:17] therefore again that's the third time
[1:09:20] among the Jews for these sayings and
[1:09:23] many of them said he had a devil
[1:09:25] and is mad you see if you lack a
[1:09:29] revelation you will be so deranged in
[1:09:33] your mind so mentally deranged by lack
[1:09:37] of a revelation how can you think a man
[1:09:39] has a devil when he is casting out devil
[1:09:43] it goes to show that if you refuse
[1:09:45] Revelation you become mentally
[1:09:48] deranged say for example Jesus said
[1:09:51] baptize in the name of the father and of
[1:09:53] the son and of the Holy Ghost now a
[1:09:56] person without revelation will just go
[1:09:59] and repeat those words I baptize you in
[1:10:02] the name of the father and of the son
[1:10:05] and of the Holy Ghost but father is not
[1:10:06] a name son is not a name Holy Ghost is
[1:10:10] not a name but because they refuse
[1:10:12] Revelation they become so mentally
[1:10:14] deranged to know that they are not
[1:10:16] baptizing in any name and there is no
[1:10:20] scriptural support of anybody who has
[1:10:22] ever baptized that way but they won't
[1:10:25] even listen to that because they have
[1:10:28] turned aside Revelation may God help us
[1:10:32] to receive divine revelation which is
[1:10:35] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[1:10:39] the knowledge of him if we lack wisdom
[1:10:43] let's ask it of God if we lack knowledge
[1:10:45] and revelation God gives it and when the
[1:10:49] Revelation comes it's not against the
[1:10:52] word if you say that is revealed to you
[1:10:57] that baptism in is in the name of the
[1:10:59] Lord Jesus Christ what you are basically
[1:11:01] saying is you have the correct
[1:11:03] interpretation of scripture
[1:11:07] amen if you tell me that you have a
[1:11:09] revelation of what happened in the
[1:11:11] Garden of Eden the serpent seed what
[1:11:13] happened there the original sin what you
[1:11:15] are telling me basically is your
[1:11:17] interpretation of the scripture is
[1:11:20] correct because any Revelation without
[1:11:22] scriptural support cannot be accepted
[1:11:25] amen we have to judge your Revelation by
[1:11:28] the scripture so Revelation really is
[1:11:31] the correct interpretation of
[1:11:34] scripture when you can precisely know
[1:11:37] what the Bible says about the godhead
[1:11:40] that's Revelation that's wisdom that's
[1:11:43] knowledge and when you have that that's
[1:11:45] the new birth it changes you
[1:11:49] completely and you cannot stop the holy
[1:11:52] ghost from flooding your soul because
[1:11:55] that opens the doors of God to pour
[1:11:58] himself into you and Jesus said Upon
[1:12:01] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[1:12:05] gates of hell can never Prevail when
[1:12:08] something is revealed to you Satan
[1:12:10] cannot Prevail sickness cannot Prevail
[1:12:13] and that's why Jesus says I give you the
[1:12:16] key whatever you bind here will be bound
[1:12:18] in heaven upon Revelation all things are
[1:12:22] possible if it's revealed to you that
[1:12:25] God Is A Healer if it's revealed to you
[1:12:28] that God is a provider if it's revealed
[1:12:31] to you that you are a part of the Bride
[1:12:34] there's not enough Devils to stop you
[1:12:36] from becoming what God has said you are
[1:12:38] to
[1:12:40] become amen isn't he
[1:12:43] wonderful so there was a division
[1:12:47] again in John 7 John chapter 7 on verse
[1:12:51] 46 going down there the officer J
[1:12:56] answered never man spake like this man
[1:13:02] he was a mystery he was not born like
[1:13:05] other men that's why he could never
[1:13:08] speak like other men never man SP these
[1:13:12] people were sent to go and take him and
[1:13:14] bring him and apprehend him and arrest
[1:13:17] him and bring him here bound bring him
[1:13:20] want to examine him and when they went
[1:13:22] there they began to hear him speak
[1:13:24] instead of arresting in him they were
[1:13:26] arrested they were apprehended
[1:13:28] themselves they could not do anything
[1:13:31] hey never meant spe like this man and
[1:13:35] and and and and and the Pharisees were
[1:13:38] so were so were so upset are you also
[1:13:43] deceived on verse 48 he says but these
[1:13:46] people who knoweth not the law are
[1:13:48] cursed Nicodemus said unto them he he
[1:13:51] that came to Jesus by Night being one of
[1:13:53] them doth our lord judge any men before
[1:13:56] it hear him and know what he doeth they
[1:14:00] answered and said unto him art thou also
[1:14:03] of Galilee
[1:14:05] search and look for out of Galilee
[1:14:08] ariseth no
[1:14:11] Prophet the Bible says on verse 53 and
[1:14:14] every man went unto his own
[1:14:18] house there was no Fellowship after that
[1:14:20] service
[1:14:21] there every man went down to his own
[1:14:24] house
[1:14:26] when the service was over that day they
[1:14:28] could say God bless you brother and we
[1:14:30] will come again next next next service
[1:14:32] and here every man just went to his own
[1:14:34] house I believe it won't be like that
[1:14:37] today after the services over let's have
[1:14:39] some fellowship every man went to his
[1:14:42] own house they just could not understand
[1:14:44] who he was he was a mystery see how God
[1:14:49] works without a revelation you would
[1:14:53] never catch that Jesus Jesus though he
[1:14:56] was in Galilee but he was born in
[1:14:59] Judea and yet that did not need a
[1:15:02] revelation Supernatural something from
[1:15:05] above to just show you that he was born
[1:15:08] in Galilee you had just to go back to
[1:15:10] the records and search the history
[1:15:13] search the history talk to Mary you are
[1:15:18] living in Galilee yeah how many years
[1:15:21] all our life okay and then this man who
[1:15:24] is saying Jes Jesus how come he's living
[1:15:27] in in Galilee oh oh you know what
[1:15:29] happened we were he he was born during
[1:15:32] those days when Augustus Caesar had his
[1:15:35] Proclamation and forced all of us to go
[1:15:38] for the sensus if you remember and
[1:15:40] that's when we went there and just at
[1:15:43] that time I gave birth so he was born
[1:15:46] actually in Judea in Bethlehem according
[1:15:49] to scripture it was Bethlehem you know
[1:15:52] but you know what when the wise men came
[1:15:55] came to identify and and and and and and
[1:15:58] and and and Herold asked them and they
[1:16:01] did not go back to him my husband had an
[1:16:05] experience with the angel and he was
[1:16:07] told to take the child and the mother
[1:16:10] into Egypt because Herod wanted to kill
[1:16:14] the child really yeah you remember when
[1:16:16] the twoy olds and and were killed yeah I
[1:16:19] remember that they were looking for
[1:16:21] Jesus so really he was born in bethle
[1:16:25] but raised in Galilee and he spoke like
[1:16:28] a Galilean there was nothing judian
[1:16:31] about him his diet his preferences his
[1:16:35] talking his dressing his friends he was
[1:16:38] galileon 30 years later he says I'm the
[1:16:42] Messiah what you Messiah when you are
[1:16:44] From Galilee no we will wait for one
[1:16:47] coming from Judea so God will hide it
[1:16:50] from the wise and prudent but reveals it
[1:16:54] to babes
[1:16:55] such as Woodland I thank God the eyes of
[1:16:58] our understanding has been open and what
[1:17:02] did it the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:05] behold I send unto you Elijah the
[1:17:08] prophet he will turn the hearts of the
[1:17:11] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:17:14] Elijah will come and restore all things
[1:17:18] and in the days of the voice of the
[1:17:20] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:17:22] sound the mystery of God will be
[1:17:27] finished and we thank God because though
[1:17:30] we are in this last day of L this year
[1:17:33] but we are not a part of L this year we
[1:17:36] have received the counsel I counsel Thee
[1:17:40] I canel the to buy of me Silver tried
[1:17:46] gold tried in the fire and to have
[1:17:48] rainment so that your nakedness will not
[1:17:51] appear and our eyes have been anointed
[1:17:55] with the
[1:17:56] eyes oh this is beautiful God loves to
[1:17:59] hide
[1:18:00] himself God wants to hide himself so
[1:18:03] they were saying here judge search look
[1:18:06] out of Galilee ariseth no prophet and
[1:18:09] every man went to his own house Wow we
[1:18:12] must be so eloquent and able so
[1:18:16] knowledgeable about the message until
[1:18:19] those that try to convince us to leave
[1:18:23] the message those that try to convince
[1:18:25] us that all these things are not so and
[1:18:27] so on we should be so
[1:18:29] knowledgeable so eloquent about the
[1:18:32] scriptures to be able to silence them
[1:18:36] amen until every man will go to his own
[1:18:40] house without asking us any
[1:18:45] questions I like that when every man
[1:18:47] went to his own house they were shaking
[1:18:49] their head never men spe like this man
[1:18:53] this one went to his house they did not
[1:18:55] talk that day now in
[1:18:57] Matthew in Matthew chapter 22 verse 41
[1:19:01] down while the Pharisees were gathered
[1:19:02] together Jesus asked them saying what
[1:19:05] think ye of Christ yeah what's your
[1:19:08] Revelation about me who do you think I
[1:19:10] am now you say when you say you have a
[1:19:13] revelation check it with the word
[1:19:16] revelation is correct interpretation of
[1:19:20] scripture amen let that sink if you say
[1:19:24] it's revealed to you there must be
[1:19:26] scripture to back up your Revelation am
[1:19:30] let me tell you something
[1:19:32] Peter did not even need to really make
[1:19:37] that question something farfetched you
[1:19:40] know he could have just said hang on
[1:19:43] Lord very good question that you have
[1:19:46] asked that who do we say you are just
[1:19:49] give me a few moments I'm just going to
[1:19:52] find out if Peter had just gone to where
[1:19:55] Mary was and say Mary what did the angel
[1:19:59] say when you gave birth to the master
[1:20:02] what did the angel say oh Mar would say
[1:20:05] oh yes the angel say that Holy thing
[1:20:08] shall be called The Son of God and could
[1:20:11] have come and say you are the Son of God
[1:20:14] by just scripture it was in the Bible
[1:20:18] baptism in Jesus name is not something
[1:20:20] which is being cooked up from somewhere
[1:20:23] it's biblical
[1:20:25] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:20:29] given his name Shall be Called counselor
[1:20:33] Prince of Peace Everlasting father that
[1:20:36] same Sunday so the name of the father
[1:20:40] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:43] the Lord Jesus Christ for the Bible says
[1:20:48] there is no salvation in any other name
[1:20:52] but the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:55] and in the whole book of Acts which is
[1:20:57] the record of the foundation of the
[1:20:58] church nobody was ever baptized entitled
[1:21:02] but when you reject Revelation you
[1:21:05] become mentally deranged you don't even
[1:21:08] think to think that AR Bishops and
[1:21:11] Bishops and people with degrees and
[1:21:13] Masters and they've written fces of what
[1:21:17] they believe this to be yet they don't
[1:21:19] they can't even see that nobody was ever
[1:21:22] baptized in titles until the Catholic
[1:21:25] church start they cannot find way Peter
[1:21:28] ever baptized in the name of the father
[1:21:31] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:33] they can never see where Paul did it but
[1:21:35] they still doing it and they are saying
[1:21:38] no we believe Jesus not Peter but the
[1:21:41] same Jesus said Peter I give you the
[1:21:44] key whatsoever you see without
[1:21:47] Revelation you just become so ignorant
[1:21:50] so ignorant and and and and so
[1:21:54] so uneducated and so
[1:21:58] unreasonable it's demon possession when
[1:22:01] when you fail to have a revelation which
[1:22:03] comes from the father let's leave that
[1:22:07] who do men say what think you of Christ
[1:22:10] on verse
[1:22:12] 42 they say unto him the son of David
[1:22:16] and they answered this way on
[1:22:20] purpose they didn't want to acknowledge
[1:22:23] he was the son of of
[1:22:26] God and they knew he was saying he is
[1:22:28] the Messiah some were saying he's the
[1:22:31] anointed but they didn't believe him to
[1:22:33] be the anointed so he says what think he
[1:22:36] of the Messiah the anointed when he
[1:22:39] comes who will he be said oh he will be
[1:22:42] the son of David what a wrong
[1:22:46] answer that answer was not
[1:22:48] correct Jesus did not Mark that correct
[1:22:51] he didn't take it correct no he did not
[1:22:55] why am I saying that there was a greater
[1:22:59] father than
[1:23:01] David if you want to call him son start
[1:23:05] on the
[1:23:07] highest Son of God but he had to come as
[1:23:11] son of David in the lineage of David for
[1:23:16] Redemption for kingship and all that and
[1:23:19] they to be son of men to be a prophet
[1:23:23] but you can't start and say is the son
[1:23:24] of David as if that's all Jesus then
[1:23:28] rebuked them and he say how then does
[1:23:31] David in the spirit call him
[1:23:34] Lord saying the Lord which is God said
[1:23:38] unto my Lord that's the Christ sit thou
[1:23:41] on my right hand till I make thy enemies
[1:23:44] thy foot St if David then call him Lord
[1:23:49] how is he his
[1:23:50] son you
[1:23:52] know like every man went to his own
[1:23:55] house the other time this time no man
[1:23:58] was able to answer him a
[1:24:00] word may God give us such a revelation
[1:24:03] of this
[1:24:04] message until no man will ever want to
[1:24:07] ask you
[1:24:09] anything people are telling us today

[1:24:37] well I don't know then if you don't
[1:24:42] know please don't talk to me about
[1:24:47] that the reason why I am in this message

[1:25:40] put that put the put the negatives of
[1:25:42] the of the of the denominations in the
[1:25:44] drum then I'll say you can have your
[1:25:46] drum I have my
[1:25:49] cup yeah because there is things that we
[1:25:52] will never be able to understand all
[1:25:53] right let's look at this imagine
[1:25:56] someone who was really against Jesus as
[1:25:59] being the Son of God maybe he was a phy
[1:26:03] and he was saying No this man is not
[1:26:04] this this is a child of Mary he's a
[1:26:06] child of Joseph this is a cover up it's
[1:26:09] a cover up they just not wait for their
[1:26:11] wedding it's a cover up I'll never
[1:26:13] believe it and then Jesus comes up and
[1:26:17] then he's arguing with them about the M
[1:26:20] about the word and about the law and
[1:26:22] everything else and while he's trying to
[1:26:24] prove himself to be God to be the son of
[1:26:27] the Living God then all of a sudden Mary
[1:26:30] comes in my
[1:26:32] son my son your
[1:26:35] father not that one Your Father Joseph
[1:26:40] and I your mother we're looking for you
[1:26:43] and there he was trying to prove he was
[1:26:45] the son of
[1:26:46] God that person would say a hear it from
[1:26:49] the horse's mouth here is here is the
[1:26:52] mother herself saying
[1:26:55] this is our product with Joseph and he
[1:26:57] is trying to claim he's the son of God
[1:27:00] God will always put stumbles stumbling
[1:27:03] blocks to Blind the eyes of those who
[1:27:06] are not supposed to see it and the
[1:27:08] prophet say some things he spoke them to
[1:27:11] throw other people
[1:27:13] out of the message God allows it to
[1:27:17] throw out some people so that the light
[1:27:19] will not strike them they are not
[1:27:22] supposed to be saved and will let some
[1:27:25] things happen so to those who really
[1:27:27] really wanted to to to to to find fault
[1:27:30] with Jesus they had firstand fand
[1:27:33] information from the mother that this is
[1:27:36] our son me and Joseph so there's nothing
[1:27:39] about Immaculate in this and how would
[1:27:42] you ever convince them that he was but
[1:27:43] you see to the
[1:27:46] predestinated god reveals it and I thank
[1:27:50] him for that so on verse 46 no man was
[1:27:53] able to answer him a word neither dust
[1:27:57] any man from that day forth ask him any
[1:28:00] more questions look how Jesus spoke
[1:28:02] because he was a mystery he was a
[1:28:04] mystery and in John 3:13 no man hath
[1:28:07] ascended up to heaven but he that came
[1:28:10] down from heaven even the son of man
[1:28:14] which is in heaven that's that's talk
[1:28:18] that will confuse anybody there the son
[1:28:21] of man which came down from heaven
[1:28:24] Heaven which is in heaven so he was in
[1:28:27] both dimensions at the same time that
[1:28:30] was a mysterious person he was a mystery
[1:28:33] his birth being mysterious that Holy
[1:28:35] thing there he was a mystery because he
[1:28:40] was the mystery of God
[1:28:44] revealed 1 Timothy 3:16 without
[1:28:48] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:28:51] godliness God was manifested in the
[1:28:53] flesh justified in the spirit seen of
[1:28:56] angels preached unto the Gentiles
[1:28:58] believed on in the world and received up
[1:29:01] into Glory he himself said in John 14:20
[1:29:05] at that day that's this day the last day
[1:29:09] you shall know that I am in my father
[1:29:13] and you are in me and I in
[1:29:17] you brings it down to us together with
[1:29:21] him and Paul explains it in Colossians 1
[1:29:24] 26 and 27 even the mystery which have
[1:29:27] been hid from ages and from Generations
[1:29:31] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[1:29:35] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:29:37] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:29:41] among the Gentiles which is really
[1:29:45] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:29:49] hallelujah hallelujah so you are right
[1:29:51] in it you are right in it you are a part
[1:29:55] of that mystery when we say what think

[1:32:33] opinion to the elect
[1:32:37] Revelation amen and friends let's turn
[1:32:41] the picture from the public

[1:32:52] recognized the head of Christ Christ in
[1:32:55] that cloud on Mount
[1:32:57] Sunset had not the angel told the
[1:32:59] prophet to turn the picture to the
[1:33:05] right that picture was taken as a
[1:33:08] pyramid this way but one day the Holy
[1:33:12] Ghost told the prophet turn it to the
[1:33:15] right look at it in the right way look
[1:33:18] at it in the right mindset turn the
[1:33:21] picture to the right he turned and there

[1:33:28] attention from the public we've heard
[1:33:31] what the Pharisees the say and we know

[1:35:23] isn't this beautiful yeah we know what
[1:35:26] the Pharisees were saying thou art thou

[1:35:32] they were saying you were all together
[1:35:34] born by fornication you you never came
[1:35:37] the right way you say and this is why
[1:35:40] you will find that don't try to measure
[1:35:43] Yourself by your own human standards of
[1:35:46] your Holiness and how much you are able
[1:35:49] to really keep the word and everything
[1:35:51] else that you'll be disappointed said
[1:35:53] because your flesh will fail you but the
[1:35:57] word buried in your flesh will never
[1:36:00] fail that word planted in your heart
[1:36:04] will never
[1:36:05] fail she was in a terrible condition she

[1:36:33] thank God that I know something I thank
[1:36:35] God I know something I thank God I know
[1:36:38] we are in the last days I thank God I
[1:36:40] know that Rapture can happen any time I
[1:36:43] thank God I have a revelation of that
[1:36:46] this message here will see us through
[1:36:49] into the Rapture I thank God for that I
[1:36:52] know I know know something and I know
[1:36:55] what I know I know and I'm not going to
[1:36:57] let the devil Rob robe me of what I know
[1:37:00] and what you know keep knowing it'll
[1:37:03] save you
[1:37:04] hallelujah
[1:37:06] amen isn't this beautiful here yeah we
[1:37:10] know when Messiah cometh here I'm I'm I
[1:37:13] am here that's fine so but these
[1:37:15] Pharisees here here is a sinner he knew
[1:37:18] he knew that Christ was was Jesus was
[1:37:21] the Christ he says we know when when
[1:37:23] Messiah that's Messiah the prince the
[1:37:26] anointed
[1:37:27] one and then the Pharisees no you are a
[1:37:30] Samaritan with the devil and you were
[1:37:32] born in in in in in fornication you you
[1:37:35] cannot tell us anything and all that
[1:37:38] they did not only say he was a Samaritan
[1:37:40] they said he was mad he's crazy and they
[1:37:44] also did not say only that they said you
[1:37:46] were casting out Devils by B zebra the
[1:37:51] prince of devils men they just splashed
[1:37:54] every name on him which was so
[1:37:57] negative see that's what they're trying
[1:37:59] to do with this message
[1:38:02] here but show me any man
[1:38:05] today who can stand and
[1:38:08] preach and then after he
[1:38:11] preached then he
[1:38:13] demonstrates what he was talking about
[1:38:17] by saying if what I have said is the
[1:38:20] truth let the Holy Spirit Come
[1:38:24] and demonstrate the same we don't have
[1:38:27] that we don't have that that was unparal
[1:38:31] an equal and it was a special gift to
[1:38:36] call us Eagles of the end time and to
[1:38:40] prepare us for the Rapture you know you
[1:38:43] may not believe this but I think every
[1:38:45] preacher must stand for his conviction
[1:38:50] you may not believe it but you better
[1:38:52] know who I am so that maybe next time if
[1:38:54] I say I'm coming you won't
[1:38:58] attend I sincerely believe the message
[1:39:01] that we
[1:39:04] have I see you're waiting for the
[1:39:08] bombshell you you are waiting for me to
[1:39:10] say what I was saying yeah I believe the
[1:39:14] message that we have is as essential as
[1:39:18] the Bible is
[1:39:20] essential now you might have a different
[1:39:22] opinion I still love you don't fall out
[1:39:24] on me but I'm saying that's my
[1:39:26] conviction you ask me why I believe the
[1:39:29] message we have is as essential as the
[1:39:31] Bible is essential I'll tell you because
[1:39:34] major
[1:39:36] prophecies major scriptural Prophecies
[1:39:39] of the end time which are in the Bible
[1:39:43] are fulfilled by this message which
[1:39:47] means the message is a
[1:39:49] continuation of the Fulfillment of the
[1:39:52] Bible
[1:39:54] which means without the message you
[1:39:56] won't have enough light to understand
[1:39:59] the Bible oh I like this I like this you
[1:40:03] want to be able to understand what the
[1:40:05] White Horse is what the red horse is
[1:40:09] what the black horse is what them
[1:40:11] Thunders are all about you will continue
[1:40:14] baptizing in the titles of Father Son
[1:40:17] and Holy Ghost because you don't have
[1:40:19] the light but the Bible says it shall be
[1:40:22] light in the evening time the path to
[1:40:25] Glory you will surely find in the days
[1:40:27] of the voice the mystery of God will be
[1:40:32] fished yes I agree with you the message
[1:40:35] is not the Bible or it is not the Bible
[1:40:37] it's not the Bible it can never be the
[1:40:39] Bible but it's as
[1:40:43] essential as the Bible because without
[1:40:46] the
[1:40:47] message you just have wisdom of men
[1:40:51] intellectualism
[1:40:53] and that will produce
[1:40:55] organizations and denominations which is
[1:40:57] men arguing no we better face it the
[1:41:02] Bible is a product of prophetic
[1:41:04] utterances this is a product of
[1:41:07] prophetic utterances Moses spoke it
[1:41:10] became the word Noah a prophet spoke it
[1:41:14] became the word Jeremiah Isaiah all of
[1:41:17] them that became the written
[1:41:20] word but now that word spoke talk about
[1:41:23] the coming of Elijah to restore all
[1:41:27] things come on church that word Elijah
[1:41:31] them people there the Malachi and and
[1:41:34] and and and and the Zachariah the the
[1:41:38] the Isaiah they spoke about the coming
[1:41:41] light so when that light comes you need
[1:41:46] all of
[1:41:48] it that's why when the angel came down
[1:41:50] with a open book and the Thunders
[1:41:53] uttered their voices it goes to say in
[1:41:56] the days of the voice these things will
[1:41:58] be finished and then it says God take
[1:42:01] that book go take that open book eat it
[1:42:05] up eat that Revelation which is coming
[1:42:09] up there eat what the seven Thunders
[1:42:12] haveed let make that your daily bread
[1:42:15] lovest thou me Peter lovest thou me
[1:42:18] Simon feed my lambs and you cannot feed
[1:42:22] them with chicken mesh of some
[1:42:26] denominational Creeds and dogmas you
[1:42:29] feed eagles with the carcus of the word
[1:42:34] of God for where the carcus is where the
[1:42:38] hidden manner is where the spiritual
[1:42:42] food in due season is there will the
[1:42:47] Eagles be gathered together oh brother
[1:42:51] come and dime
[1:42:53] Jesus told his disciples come and
[1:42:57] die oh isn't it wonderful e the book yes
[1:43:02] so is is he now shifts from the my time
[1:43:05] is going he shifts from the public
[1:43:08] opinion I want you to know this let's
[1:43:11] never follow public opinion follow your
[1:43:15] Revelation that comes from God which
[1:43:17] Compares with the word shifted it from
[1:43:21] the public he says whom do you say that
[1:43:24] I am turn the picture don't worry about
[1:43:26] what the public is saying don't worry
[1:43:28] about the negative things about brother
[1:43:30] Bram God does not confirm his word by
[1:43:33] public opinion no it's a
[1:43:37] revelation it doesn't confirm it by
[1:43:39] public opinion it's got to be revealed
[1:43:41] to you you know what if you are
[1:43:43] convinced by somebody that this message
[1:43:46] is correct somebody again will convince
[1:43:48] you out of it but if God has convinced
[1:43:52] you you know the Bible says they shall
[1:43:54] be taught of God they shall be taught of
[1:43:58] God when the Holy Ghost teaches you when
[1:44:02] God reveals something to you you did not
[1:44:06] get it by arguments you never won an
[1:44:08] argument about the topic the subject it
[1:44:11] was revealed to you and the scriptures
[1:44:14] were just aligning in that way no one
[1:44:17] can shake you from
[1:44:20] there turn the picture
[1:44:23] so he comes to the disciples why because
[1:44:25] in Luke 8:10 unto you it is given to
[1:44:31] know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
[1:44:35] you told me what they saying out there
[1:44:37] but who do you say I am because unto you
[1:44:41] it is given you are the bride you are
[1:44:44] the predestinated because the mystery is
[1:44:48] predestination oh yeah that's the
[1:44:50] mystery predestinated if you you are not
[1:44:54] predestinated you are out of the picture
[1:44:56] because you were never in the
[1:44:59] picture amen I like that one you're out
[1:45:02] of the picture because you were never in
[1:45:04] the picture but if you were from the
[1:45:06] beginning in the picture nobody can take
[1:45:09] you out of it you were in God's mind you
[1:45:12] were a part of God you were the thoughts
[1:45:14] of God you were in his mind he thought
[1:45:17] about you how can anybody pull you out
[1:45:21] no one can plock them out of his hand
[1:45:24] and if God thought about you you will be
[1:45:26] in this message until the Rapture you
[1:45:29] will make it for the Rapture nobody can
[1:45:32] ever no hardship no
[1:45:34] trial no difficulty nothing no sickness
[1:45:38] no disease no divorce no nothing no
[1:45:42] temptation will ever move you from the
[1:45:45] love of God which is in Christ Jesus a
[1:45:48] revelation anchors you a revelation puts
[1:45:52] you on a solid foundation on a rock let
[1:45:57] the winds blow let the tornadoes blow
[1:46:01] let the bers come but on Christ the
[1:46:05] solid rock I
[1:46:09] stand who do you say I am he's turning
[1:46:12] to the elected Peter come on Peter come
[1:46:15] on who do you say I am you are the
[1:46:18] chosen ones i' I've come for you I've
[1:46:22] come to lay down my life for your sake
[1:46:24] who do you think I am and Peter just
[1:46:27] without thinking but he gathered up all
[1:46:30] that he had heard all that he knew thou
[1:46:33] are the Christ son of the Living God
[1:46:36] Amen and the moment he said that Jesus
[1:46:40] also said to him you tell me who I am
[1:46:44] then I tell you who you
[1:46:48] are
[1:46:50] hey you get a revelation of who he is he
[1:46:54] also tells you your position in the body
[1:46:59] Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:47:04] my church and the Gates of Hell will
[1:47:07] never Prevail when you know who he is he
[1:47:11] then reveals to you your position in his
[1:47:16] body amen glory to God when you know who
[1:47:21] he is when you know the word the message
[1:47:24] has been revealed to you you also see
[1:47:27] your name in that message you see your
[1:47:30] position in Christ you see your
[1:47:34] placing as a son hallelujah amen glory
[1:47:39] and so he says Thou Art the Christ and
[1:47:42] say blessed blessed art thou Simon why
[1:47:45] did he say blessed that thou he Jesus
[1:47:47] did not just did not just say things he
[1:47:50] was the word come on he was the word
[1:47:52] word whatever he said was scripture so
[1:47:56] he turned blessed that thou Simon why
[1:47:59] was he saying that he had
[1:48:01] said but blessed are your
[1:48:04] eyes in Matthew 13 on verse 16 blessed
[1:48:09] are your eyes for they see and your ears

[1:51:32] joined church or you shook hands or done
[1:51:35] something different or you promised to
[1:51:37] leave by a Cod of rules but Christ the
[1:51:41] Bible he is the word that was revealed
[1:51:45] to you it's Christ in
[1:51:49] you that's the Revelation that the
[1:51:52] church was built on paragraph 496 but

[1:52:43] you the
[1:52:49] Revelation you know
[1:52:55] Christ excuse
[1:52:58] me
[1:53:00] Christ is that seventh
[1:53:04] seal we know
[1:53:07] it I'm closing on this statement Christ
[1:53:11] is that seventh
[1:53:13] seal which we know when the Bible was
[1:53:16] talking about the first seal second
[1:53:18] third there were symbols to each and
[1:53:21] every SE
[1:53:23] but on the seventh
[1:53:24] seal there was no
[1:53:26] symbol it was a mystery and Christ
[1:53:31] himself is a mystery the seventh seal is
[1:53:36] a
[1:53:38] mystery and what did he say about that
[1:53:40] servant
[1:53:41] seal he
[1:53:45] says here
[1:53:47] now we find that the Sixth Seal has been
[1:53:52] open
[1:53:53] opened to us we see it and we know that
[1:54:00] the seventh
[1:54:02] seal cannot be
[1:54:06] broke to the
[1:54:08] public until the hour
[1:54:13] arrived the public could not know who
[1:54:15] Jesus was they saw him as
[1:54:18] Jeremiah they saw he as Isaiah that's
[1:54:21] the public
[1:54:23] that seventh seal the coming of the Lord
[1:54:26] is not BR to the public but to
[1:54:30] us we know that's the bridegroom
[1:54:34] coming to claim his
[1:54:39] bride remember friend the prophet says
[1:54:43] watch that
[1:54:45] seven seven is always the mystery watch
[1:54:49] that
[1:54:50] seven that's the Finish
[1:54:53] that silver when boas was giving Ruth
[1:54:57] the measures of Val how many measures
[1:55:01] did he give
[1:55:04] her Bo measured out six measures of body
[1:55:11] is that right you can check it but
[1:55:13] that's what it is I believe he measured
[1:55:15] out seven measures of B to
[1:55:20] Ru watch that that seven he says that in
[1:55:24] Souls that are in prison now the seven
[1:55:28] is always the mystery that's Christ he
[1:55:31] was a mystery you are
[1:55:34] Jeremiah he gave B was did he a type of
[1:55:38] Christ gave Ruth six measure where was
[1:55:42] the seventh
[1:55:43] measure it was a
[1:55:46] mystery it was standing right there the
[1:55:50] one who gave the first second third thir
[1:55:52] fourth fifth measure was going to be
[1:55:56] Ruth's
[1:55:59] husband the seventh measure stood there
[1:56:03] before Ruth as a mystery she received
[1:56:06] six measures of
[1:56:08] B that seven was a mystery it was b as
[1:56:12] himself he was going to be redeemed
[1:56:15] watch when the water pots were put
[1:56:16] before Jesus how many water pots were
[1:56:19] put
[1:56:22] six water pots where was the
[1:56:26] seven watch that s it's always a m Jesus
[1:56:32] himself says if any man thir let him
[1:56:36] come I will give him the Waters of life
[1:56:39] he was the
[1:56:41] seventh water water pot as a
[1:56:46] mystery and when the woman at the
[1:56:49] well was discerned
[1:56:52] the heart secrets were disclosed he says
[1:56:56] you've heard how many husbands
[1:57:00] six now all these things are not just
[1:57:02] that seventh seal is typed from the from
[1:57:04] Genesis amen you can find that seventh
[1:57:07] seal there she had had six husband where
[1:57:11] was the Serv it was a mystery the one
[1:57:14] who was standing there telling her who
[1:57:17] her first husband was who the second

[1:57:22] was to the sixth that was going to be
[1:57:25] her seventh husband the spirit of
[1:57:28] bridegroom but he stood there as a
