[24:30] peoples and we pray that you will meet

[24:40] apostles be made alive tonight in our
[24:44] midst May every Hungry Heart be fed with

[24:50] God May the Sinners be condemned of
[24:54] their unbelief and accept the Lord Jesus
[24:57] as their personal
[25:00] savior father we would pray especially
[25:03] for the sick and the
[25:06] needy may this be an hour of Deliverance
[25:09] for
[25:11] them we not only pray for those that are
[25:15] present tonight in this great
[25:17] audience but we would pray for those who
[25:20] are in the radio audience we were not
[25:24] able to get here tonight by some reason
[25:29] let thy Holy Spirit oh God come to their
[25:33] bedsides or wherever they may be and
[25:36] raise
[25:37] them up from their sickness that they
[25:40] might live and serve
[25:42] thee Grant these blessings in the name
[25:45] of Jesus we ask it amen you may be
[25:56] seated I
[25:59] I am just a little horse in my
[26:03] voice uh I've been speaking this
[26:05] afternoon for some time an Evangelistic
[26:10] service here at the
[26:12] temple and then just coming from other
[26:17] meetings also and they had some sort of
[26:20] a little bug flying around at home I
[26:23] don't know what they called
[26:25] it those at the doctor's cannot name I
[26:29] think they just call it
[26:32] virus and I don't know what the little
[26:34] Fell's name was but I'm sure sorry that
[26:37] he tried to get in my
[26:39] throat Satan must have sent him there
[26:41] because of this oncoming meeting I come
[26:45] anyhow because I know in who I have
[26:49] believed I'm persuaded that he's able to
[26:52] keep that which we have committed to him
[26:55] against the
[26:56] day I found it in in my life's journey
[27:00] especially in my Ministry that when
[27:03] Satan makes a big fight he knows is a
[27:06] great blessing laying of hand so it's
[27:10] always at those times that we like to go
[27:14] on now
[27:17] our precious Brother David
[27:20] dupes has just brought a wonderful
[27:24] message in so much that I changed my
[27:28] texts when I was standing in the room
[27:30] listening to him to just a little short
[27:33] message before we pray for the
[27:36] sick the reason that I do this is to
[27:39] catch the feeling of the spirit of the
[27:44] people I that is essential we should do
[27:49] that you can take one man preaching an
[27:53] evangelist and let the Evangelist who
[27:55] has the anointing set down and then the
[27:58] pastor get up to make an alter call it's
[28:01] hard to do it you have to catch the
[28:04] spirit of the
[28:06] people and I believe that we're living
[28:09] in a great Needy Time a
[28:13] needing of the spirit of God in our
[28:17] churches and among our
[28:20] peoples and we're trusting at this
[28:22] coming week the Lord willing to see a
[28:26] great Revival start here at the angel
[28:28] Temple and spread throughout the country
[28:31] we're praying to God for
[28:34] this now I want to call your attention
[28:37] to just one scripture found in God's
[28:41] holy word St Matthew
[28:46] 12:42 and I was going to speak tonight
[28:50] on the subject of when the eagle stirs
[28:52] her nest and fluth over her young then
[28:56] we're running just a little late
[28:58] maybe that'll
[29:00] keep I wish to read from this part of
[29:03] the
[29:04] scripture and the queen of the South
[29:06] shall rise up in the Judgment with this
[29:10] generation and shall condemn it for she
[29:14] came from the uttermost parts of the
[29:17] earth to hear the wisdom of
[29:19] Solomon and behold a greater than
[29:22] Solomon is
[29:25] here our Lord had been rebuked many of
[29:28] the people who had been following
[29:32] him and had seen his great
[29:35] Miracles and still they had not
[29:38] repented and he was uaing the cities
[29:41] that he had been in in the previous part
[29:44] of this
[29:46] chapter because in these cities he had
[29:50] performed a
[29:53] sign that all believers should know that
[29:57] that was the sign of the
[30:02] Messiah we spoke on it last
[30:05] evening and how that those who seemingly
[30:09] that God had ordained to eternal life by
[30:13] his for knowledge had believed on
[30:15] it and how that he had brought his
[30:18] disciples to him by this
[30:21] thing that he had performed this sign
[30:24] and they who was looking for the god
[30:26] Prophet to come they knew that that was
[30:30] he but many of them had
[30:33] disbelieved in the previous part of this
[30:37] chapter he was saying to
[30:40] them after he had performed these works
[30:43] and they had said that he was an evil
[30:45] spirit on him was the spirit of
[30:50] beab which was an evil
[30:53] spirit and to make it in words so we
[30:56] would understand that they believe that
[30:58] the spirit that he had that could tell
[31:02] Peter who he was and what his father's
[31:05] name
[31:07] was not seeing him
[31:10] before and could tell Phillip where he
[31:13] was before he came to the
[31:15] meeting and discerned the thoughts of
[31:19] their
[31:20] hearts they cled it as an evil spirit a
[31:24] fortune teller or some evil devil
[31:30] devil and Jesus had told them if you
[31:33] speak that against the son of man it
[31:36] shall be forgiven
[31:38] you but when the Holy Ghost is
[31:43] come to speak against that it would
[31:47] never be
[31:49] forgiven and we find out that it was
[31:53] just as he
[31:55] said and he was speaking there and said
[31:57] th capernium which are exalted into
[32:01] heaven shall be brought down to
[32:03] hell for if the mighty Works had been
[32:07] done in Sodom and Gomorrah that has been
[32:10] done in you it would remain until this
[32:15] day a degraded polluted city as Sodom
[32:21] was and yet Jesus said if them signs
[32:25] would have been done in Sodom
[32:28] it would
[32:31] remained and we find last night that the
[32:34] sign that he was doing was done by an
[32:37] Angel that was later called
[32:40] God just outside of
[32:42] Sodom that Abraham and to Sarah and
[32:47] their
[32:49] host but he never did that down in
[32:53] Sodom and he also referred
[32:56] to Jonah the
[33:00] prophet in all ages God has had man that
[33:05] he could put his hand on to do his
[33:09] work now God chooses
[33:13] man not
[33:15] machines he chooses man to work through
[33:19] he chose the the prophets of the Old
[33:22] Testament he chose his own son of the
[33:26] New Testament and the apostles
[33:28] and on down through the age he's always
[33:31] had people who would believe him God has
[33:35] never been without a
[33:39] witness sometimes it's gotten down to
[33:41] just a few but always there is a
[33:46] Remnant and he was referring back to
[33:50] Jonah and many times we like to say
[33:54] about Jonah of him being backslid
[33:59] now I'm not holding up so much for what
[34:02] he
[34:03] did but I believe that all things work
[34:08] together for good to them that love
[34:12] God sometimes we do things that we do
[34:15] not understand our own doings if we are
[34:18] led by the spirit of
[34:21] God every child of God in my hearing or
[34:26] hearing of my voice rather brother knows
[34:29] that sometimes that you do things that
[34:32] you think yourself is
[34:36] ridiculous when you become
[34:40] so so closed in with God when the Holy
[34:46] Spirit gets you in such a condition to
[34:49] you're fully surrendered to
[34:52] him I've seen Man soul filled with the
[34:56] Devil
[34:58] until it would take several men to hold
[35:03] him and then if Satan can put that kind
[35:07] of a power on a man fully surrendered to
[35:11] him how much more power can the Holy
[35:16] Spirit put on a man that surrendered to
[35:20] him to make a person in a wheelchair
[35:23] rise and walk to make the shadow of a
[35:27] man dying with cancer on a cop to jump
[35:30] to his feet screaming under the power of
[35:34] God for how much stronger is God than
[35:39] the
[35:42] devil
[35:44] and Jesus was speaking about Jonah and
[35:49] he told the story of how it
[35:53] happened we are all familiar with that
[35:56] story
[35:58] and let's stop just for a minute to
[36:02] straighten my expression that I made
[36:05] about
[36:06] Jonah I do not believe he was
[36:09] backslid I believe that he was he did
[36:14] what God told him not to do but God knew
[36:17] all the time that he was going to do it
[36:20] for God's
[36:22] infinite and he knows all
[36:25] things and Jonah was was taken out into
[36:28] the
[36:29] sea on his road to Tarsus and a great
[36:33] storm came up and they bound his feet
[36:35] and hands and throw him out in a big
[36:37] fish swallowed
[36:39] him went down to the bottom of the sea
[36:42] many fathoms
[36:44] de and he kept alive for three days and
[36:49] three
[36:51] nights I believe that to be the truth
[36:55] for the word of God said it's the truth
[37:00] and we are told or I have read that the
[37:04] people of
[37:05] Nineveh were worshippers of idols and
[37:09] their sins had got
[37:12] great and one of their
[37:15] gods especially the god of the sea was a
[37:21] whale and it was the god of the sea
[37:24] because it was the largest species in in
[37:27] the
[37:28] sea and the people their occupation was
[37:33] fishing and as all of them at their task
[37:38] that morning drawing in the Nets of
[37:40] fishes and all of a sudden up comes the
[37:44] god of the sea opens up his mouth and
[37:47] the prophet walks out sure they
[37:51] repented it was all in
[37:53] order God knows how to do things we just
[37:57] have to
[37:59] follow no matter if it seems ridiculous
[38:02] go do it
[38:03] anyhow if the spirit of God is
[38:07] leading and they repented in sackcloth
[38:10] and in
[38:12] ashes because a miracle like that taking
[38:18] place and here was Jesus standing there
[38:21] performing the signs of the Messiah and
[38:24] that generation called it the working of
[38:28] a
[38:29] devil Jesus said they'll raise up for
[38:32] they repented with of the preaching of
[38:36] Jonah and they rise in the day of the
[38:41] Judgment with this generation in condem
[38:44] it then he goes to the little Queen of
[38:47] the south in the days of
[38:50] Solomon now God had give a great gift to
[38:54] Solomon
[38:57] and Anyone who reads the scriptures
[39:00] knows that when God sends a gift to the
[39:03] earth and the people reject that gift
[39:08] it's always chaos to that
[39:12] generation they never
[39:15] Prosper they end up in
[39:20] judgment upon the
[39:23] Nations and if they accept the gift that
[39:26] God sins it's usually a millennium for
[39:31] those people they are
[39:35] blessed and we know as Bible readers
[39:38] that in the days of Solomon was a golden
[39:41] age for
[39:43] Israel why because of all the people
[39:48] with one Accord rallied around that
[39:52] great gift that Solomon had from
[39:56] God I I wonder what would take place
[40:00] tonight if all the churches in the
[40:03] United
[40:06] States would rally around the gift that
[40:09] God has given
[40:11] us that is the Holy
[40:13] Ghost God's gift what if all the
[40:17] churches would break down their barriers
[40:21] and would rally around that great gift
[40:25] of Godly brotherly love
[40:28] and the baptism of the Holy
[40:30] Spirit it would be the greatest defense
[40:33] this nation could
[40:35] have it would be better than all the
[40:38] scientists and atomic bombs and so forth
[40:41] that they could
[40:43] invent for that's what God wants us to
[40:47] do all of us in our different
[40:50] denominations is to recognize one
[40:53] another as
[40:55] brothers and
[40:58] sisters rallying around this great gift
[41:02] of God which is the holy
[41:05] ghost that comes with power and
[41:08] manifestation and
[41:10] demonstrations of his
[41:14] presence and there would not be one
[41:16] cruel word spoken against any move of
[41:20] God we'd all be one and one great big
[41:25] bundle of Godly love
[41:28] that's what it's going to take for the
[41:30] church to go in the
[41:35] Rapture Paul said thy might speak with
[41:38] tongues like men and angels and have not
[41:41] love it profits me
[41:45] nothing I could discern or have all the
[41:48] wisdoms and of the scriptures and know
[41:51] them all and have faith to move
[41:53] mountains I am still nothing
[41:58] what a disappointment it's going to be
[42:00] at the Judgment when man
[42:02] who thought that they were all right
[42:05] because they had Faith to heal the
[42:08] sick they had Faith to operate a
[42:12] gift and had great meetings great
[42:16] Evangelistic services and one
[42:19] Souls Jesus has forewarned us of those
[42:23] things many will come to me in that day
[42:26] and say God have not I cast out devils
[42:29] in your name and in your name done many
[42:32] mighty
[42:33] works then he said he would confess to
[42:36] them depart from me you workers of
[42:40] iniquity I never knew you it takes more
[42:45] than the power of
[42:47] gifts it takes more than jaring
[42:52] Church it takes the birth of the Holy
[42:56] Spirit to break down our walls and to
[43:00] unite us together as one great Christian
[43:04] body moving for one objective and one
[43:11] goal they did that in the days of
[43:14] Solomon while everybody came by they
[43:18] would speak of it as something
[43:21] great Solomon had a gift of
[43:25] discernment wisdom
[43:28] and people coming by would say oh don't
[43:31] you
[43:32] leave they would say to the passer by
[43:36] until you
[43:38] come and see what the Lord Our God has
[43:41] done for us would not that be
[43:45] wonderful to hear it again tonight come
[43:49] and see our God is a living
[43:53] God the news made headlines
[43:58] the only way they had to send news then
[44:01] was from lip to
[44:03] ear and that news swept out all over the
[44:07] world the KNN world that there was a
[44:11] great God up in Israel who was
[44:14] manifesting himself through his servant
[44:18] Solomon and all the people with one ACC
[44:21] carbas rallying around it
[44:24] Unity there's power in un
[44:31] then the news finally come to the little
[44:33] Queen all the way across the Sahara
[44:37] Desert way down in the utmost parts of
[44:40] the KNN world of that
[44:42] day down in the
[44:44] Sheba while every traveler would come by
[44:47] as pass through Israel and say oh you
[44:49] should go up there and see those
[44:54] people why are they just as B old as
[44:57] they can be they know there's not a flaw
[45:00] about their
[45:02] religion that's the way we want to
[45:04] believe it there's nothing wrong with
[45:06] the holy spirit it's a perfect gift of
[45:11] God to the
[45:15] church and they would keep speaking
[45:18] about the great things that Solomon
[45:20] would do now Faith cometh by what
[45:25] hearing hearing the word of
[45:28] God and you know when this word kept
[45:31] coming to this little Queen she began to
[45:35] believe that it was a
[45:37] truth and she began to thirst to go find
[45:42] out about
[45:44] it oh Jesus said ye are the salt of the
[45:50] earth but if the salt has lost its
[45:53] savior or its strength it's forth good
[45:57] for nothing but to be cast out and trod
[46:00] under the feet of man made roads out
[46:03] of well I do not wish to be
[46:07] critical but to a certain degree we are
[46:10] letting this great blessing go to
[46:14] that the strength of the Holy Spirit
[46:18] should be in every member of the
[46:21] church what do you mean strength the
[46:24] power of the Resurrection
[46:27] the life that Jesus gave for the church
[46:30] should be operating in every member of
[46:33] it the
[46:34] body the
[46:36] strength salt will only save if it
[46:39] contacts but it must
[46:42] contact and if the church gets that
[46:45] burden on their heart to contact someone
[46:49] get someone
[46:51] saved then the strength is coming back
[46:54] into the church again and into to the
[46:58] people and this little
[47:01] woman first place she had a lot of a
[47:05] difficults the odds as we would call it
[47:07] in the world was against
[47:10] her the first place she was a
[47:15] woman
[47:16] and then she was a
[47:20] pagan a worshipper of
[47:22] idols and being in her position the
[47:25] queen she'd have to ask release from her
[47:28] own church before she could go up and T
[47:30] that
[47:32] Revival well you can imagine what the
[47:34] Pagan priest would say to
[47:36] her now look my
[47:39] dear do not be carried away with such a
[47:43] little fantastic things if there was any
[47:47] God to be made manifest we would have it
[47:49] right here in
[47:50] Shea our church would have
[47:53] it we'd be the ones that was doing it
[47:58] if that isn't a good attitude towards
[48:00] many people's
[48:02] today I trust that you don't think I'm
[48:05] criticizing I'm just making a
[48:08] declaration of
[48:11] facts now
[48:13] notice and she longed to go and he would
[48:18] they go get out the Scrolls and say now
[48:20] look you
[48:22] here this great God of ours was so and
[48:24] so she'd say I heard my my grandmother
[48:27] talk about that and she said she heard
[48:31] her grandmother talk about it but all we
[48:34] have is some written
[48:37] words of a God that once
[48:41] existed where is he today they tell me
[48:44] that those people up there in Israel has
[48:46] got a living God who's living among them
[48:50] operating through
[48:52] them I want to sit
[48:55] it blessed are they that do hunger and
[48:58] thirst for they shall be
[49:02] filled she made ready she was a sensible
[49:07] woman she said uh she Laden some animals
[49:10] down with gold and silver and
[49:14] frankincense and many great stones of
[49:17] great
[49:18] price let's think that she said this in
[49:21] her heart I'm not going to sit down here
[49:24] in Sheba
[49:27] and just be a wet
[49:29] rag if they've got a revival going on
[49:32] that manifest is the presence of a
[49:34] living God I'm going up to find out
[49:36] about
[49:37] it for if they've got that among them we
[49:40] haven't got it among
[49:42] us and I want to stop these Creeds and
[49:46] and find where there is something that
[49:48] can talk
[49:50] back bless that woman's
[49:53] heart she was hungering and thirsting
[49:56] for
[49:57] God and she laid in these animals with
[50:00] these gifts and perhaps she said this
[50:03] I'm going up I ain't going to take
[50:05] nobody else's word I'm going to find out
[50:08] for myself if it's a truth I'll support
[50:12] it if it isn't the truth I'll bring my
[50:16] gifts
[50:17] back that's a good
[50:21] idea if God's in it put everything
[50:24] behind it you got you're Soul your heart
[50:27] your mind your
[50:29] talent all that you've got give it to
[50:32] the glory of
[50:34] God if he isn't God then let it alone
[50:36] and find out where there is a
[50:39] God if it isn't a truth let it alone
[50:42] find out what is
[50:45] truth so then she had the cross of
[50:47] Sahara
[50:49] Desert now this company of she had a few
[50:54] guards Unix from the temple
[50:57] a few maids to wait on her you know how
[51:00] long it would take to cross the desert
[51:02] from Sheba to Jerusalem by a camel takes
[51:06] three
[51:09] months no wonder Jesus said she'll stand
[51:13] in the day of judgment and condemn this
[51:17] generation while some people in Los
[51:19] Angeles won't drive a Cadillac up here
[51:22] to hear about
[51:23] it look what she had to do come across
[51:26] Al SAR a desert on the back of a camel
[51:29] but there was something in her heart
[51:32] thirsty to find out if there was a God
[51:38] and if he lived and he lived in his
[51:40] people when you get the thirsting like
[51:42] that there's nothing going to hold you
[51:44] away from
[51:45] it I don't care what they call the
[51:49] people they've been called all kinds of
[51:51] names so is Jesus called Bea
[51:56] make any difference what the people says
[51:58] is what God is
[52:02] saying and so she tuck off here's
[52:06] something else had to confront her the
[52:09] children of Ishmael was on the
[52:11] desert Fleet footed Riders robbers
[52:15] murderers well what a what a a pray that
[52:20] would be for them
