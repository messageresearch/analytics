believe only believe only be all things are [Music] possible only believe only only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brena 12 verse unto the angel of the Church of peros write these things sayth he that a sharp sword with two edges I know Works th dwell even Satan's SE and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days Orin anus was my faithful martyr who was slain among you or Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou has there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught B to cast the stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so H has thou also then that hold the doctrine his deeds back there in Ephesus now it's become a Doctrine doctrine of the nickol adans remember me telling you that the other night how it approached to that deeds in Ephesus now it's a Doctrine uh the doctrine of the nickelation which things are hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them not the real Church them with the sword of my mouth he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him him a white stone and in the the stone a new name written which no man knoweth sa in he that receiveth the Lord add His blessings to this am and help us now as we try Hallelujah now on the background of this church it's the third Church age called pergamus and the the date that this church existed was from 3 12 832 to 606 the age was false Doctrine Satan lying the foundation of papacy rule and marriage to church and state the reward was hidden Mana a white stone and the star the angel of this church by all that the Holy Spirit let me do I have picked St Martin amen it was the the Revelation giving me on it because reading of the other Saints during that time uh pick St Martin because that he was a Godly Man to my opinion he was 10 times more Apostle in St Patrick was now St Patrick was um St Martin's nephew uh St Martin's sister was a mother of St Patrick and uh St Martin uh was uh of course that was it St Patrick's Uncle now his life was from ad. 315 to 399 now here's the reason I picked him in preference to other Saints of that day because the way that he held himself and under the inspiration of God I do not believe that th the Catholic Church did not canonizing they did not recognize him that's another reason I picted amen and all these that were're seeing it's got this spiritual Ministry the early church turned down the the nickan church turned it down because of these things they were spiritual and as I've draw here the church was being squeezed out and the nickan doctrine was in the was in the majority and the true church was in the minority has always been and as I said from the beginning it was Jesus that said fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the kingdom that's why I apply the kingdom to a spiritual Kingdom and we are have a spiritual Kingdom and we're so happy all that and a king in this Kingdom remember he is the king of saints sainted ones he is their King who leads him the life of St Martin was is one of the greatest Miracle fill lives of anybody in the church ages from all all the way from St Paul out he was one of the most spiritual men he was one of his first Miracles was he was a soldier to begin with I believe and then one day he was coming by and there was someone uh a man laying cold and shivering and all the people that was willing or not willing but was able to help them in they passing by like the the priest the Levites did in the Good Samaritan but when St Martin come by realizing his duty as a Christian believer he had one coat of cloak over his shoulders he cut it in two with his sword and give half of it to the beggar he took the other half that night begin his career for Jesus Christ appeared to him in a vision wrapped in that same robe that he cut half in Two Hallelujah which fulfill the scripture in so much as you have done unto these you have did it unto me so take that for a lesson whatever you do to somebody you're doing it unto Christ am just remember are you let's say that together what you do to others you have done to Christ so no matter what he thinks about you it's what you think about him see amen that brings the blessing that was his first miracle and the beginning of his ministry there so much to it I I wouldn't have time because I want you back tomorrow night and every night so I don't want to keep you too long all right the next miracle that I chose to speak of tonight he was absolutely demolishing heathenism and he was firmly against the Church of Rome he absolutely disagreed with all all the first church of Rome's Bishops he they was getting whirly and uh so forth like that and he withstood them he certainly was against them that's a miracle that he even lived in them kind of times now but he was destroying a pagan uh Grove one day and tearing down a pagan Altar and there was a sacred tree standing by the Pagan Altar and he was cutting this tree down and many standing by was resenting it he said if I be a man of God tie me the way that tree is leaning and let the tree fall on me if I be a man of God if I'm not a man of God the tree will kill me if I am a man of God my God can twist that tree somewhere else quite a challenge so they started chopping on the tree and when the tree started to fall they switched around and killed a bunch of the spectators amen God Twisted it back up the hill a miracle oh all the time there was miracles in his meeting another miracle that I thought to speak of was a dead baby that he laid his body across and it raised back to life again after he had prayed for some time for this baby another one is outstanding to me was uh the emperor and U he was going to kill some of God's holy ghost filled people and of course he was uh uh the right hand of the of the bishop of the First Church of Rome at that time and he actually was a pope before he was called a pope his name is d m a s r and um he uh was putting all the Christians to death that he could get a hold of to put to death and and this emperor's wife of pagan and darkness over her own heart and when this Saed St Martin came to uh intercede his wife put him next to it that he would try to intercede for these Christians not to be killed of course when he finally got to him didn't do any good because he was just uh the rightand man to this Pope so he killed those holy girls still Christians anyhow but St Mark wanted to interview with him and the gods stopped him at the gate well St Martin fell on his face and laid there and prayed until God showed him to go in when he raised up off there he walked through them locked doors and they opened by themselves Hallelujah now this is history this is just not somebody writing about him and just as a little if anything there would be a Prejudice if it would be some Church talking or the I'd say at least especially the pap Church they wouldn't mention those things but see the history quotes the truth amen and this man walked right up St Martin in right by every guard everything else right into the front of the emperor and the emperor didn't want to respect God's servant you know that that's not that's not mannerly so he just turned his head and wouldn't even respect him you know what God did he tried to talk to him and he just kept his head turn God is going to make this Heathen pay respect to his servant so he just set the thing AAR and scorched him all out of his seat raised him up now that's Bible History not seeing counsel he had to respect God he made him stand up and he Scorch the seat where he was sitting power went through his body and scorched the bottom of the sea and he had to jump up from there God has way doing things God's able to these Stones through eyes children to Abraham remember that same God dwells among us tonight it's the same God all right and then another that I like and then I'll stop I got something here but I this is one I was very fond of while he was one day waiting for his people in prayer in his study room and he he was a great man and he carried this holy spirit filled church and tore us all all he was a had them all filled with the spirit all his congregation and all out throughout all the country that Christians did Miracles and signs and wonder see God speaks to his messenger the messenger speaks to the Ley and then that's what takes place you see he he keeps the Ley and him alike in God you see the Holy Spirit flowing through the group of them many times when they was Morty they stood the minister right out among them like that and killed them all at the same time and um what evils they did do to them people they burn them they tuck man and nail them with down to logs and turn wild dogs loose or and let them eat from the back of the person pulling their intestines through before the never died taking women would cut their right breast off and let them stand there as a heartbeat in his St till he pitched over dead like that take their children from a expected mothers and feed them to the Hogs and things let the mother stand watching and all kinds now you wouldn't think that people profess Christianity would do that but listen to the Bible said Jesus said it'll come to pass that they'll kill you thinking they're doing God a service you remember that same Jesus that said that through the same Spirit predicted it again in the end time it's got to come if these others hit just perfectly with this scripture watch and see if it doesn't coincides exactly through the scripture and through history God said it would happen here's the history said it did happen God said it happen here here where did happen see just exactly then what do we going to do when we get down to the lady oan Church age see where we're at now and the wars and things pronounced to get in so now then this he was in there praying while his congregation was waiting and there was a beggar come to the door and knocked at his door he opened the door and he was busy and he told him he wanted a a garment he was naked had nothing it was cold and he said he's sing around to see the chief Deacon and the chief Deacon was irritable with him and run him out and when it did it run around he come back again and told St Martin that um that the the Deacon had run him out and so then about that time this Chief Deacon come back in and told him kind sharply that your congregation's waiting on you you're keeping them waiting but he was in prayer it's better that he stay in prayer till he feels lead of God to go out and this beggar come back to the door and St Martin took off his own good garment give it to the beggar and had the the um the chief Deacon to go get another one and bring it to him so he had to get a garment anyhow and put it on St Martin and he wore the Lesser garment out before the people instead of his good garment see it just goes to show give the best that you have give your life give your time give everything to Christ and that same spirit that lived in Christ lives in you and and your influence in your neighborhood upon the people that you deal with will be so much like Christ to little work the same thing Christ did amen finally it will come to pass that the people laid in the shadows and was healed that that's right there so much power of love around them and they said that when St Martin was preaching after he come out this lesser robone that the entire congregation notice a Glo of light all around him see because he had done the right thing always do right your duty to God think right that's your duty to yourself and you've got to come out right amen that's right you just have to now we want to start now on a trying to take this in a Canon of exclamations tonight because it's dealing here very strong now to the angel of the Church of perus right these things it saith he which has the sharp two s sharp sword with two edges I want you to notice he's introducing himself again tonight in deity every church was one of his glorified State the one that had 12 star Seven Stars his hand he that has the sharp two- AED sword see something another he that has the feet of brass the eyes run with flames of fire he's introducing himself back to his deity now you said what is deity lay in this he with the sharp two- AG sword coming out of his mouth well the sword is the word Hebrews 4 we tuck it in the beginning when we run that deity of him down the sword we found in Hebrews 4:12 that was the word of God was sharper than a two-edged sword is that right that was the word of God is that now watch you have get these interpretations now Trace that word St John 1 in the beginning way back was the word that created heavens and earth is that right and the Word was with God and the Word was deity amen and deity was made fresh and dwell Among Us is that right amen the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and here is thing here the one at the beginning say this to the angel of the Church of of per pergamus say this to him I am the word of God all we seem over Revelations coming with his vesture dipped in blood Crown upon his head riding on a white horse and on his thigh was r written the word of God oh I like that he is the word the word of God so we see this deity then in the beginning to introduce himself he is the word now if he is the Living Word then this wrote on the Bible is part of him amen then if you can receive this in the himym which is the word this word comes into you by faith makes it alive amen because of oh Hallelujah catch that the word comes into you if the holy spirit's in there it's alive as soon as it comes in and every promises truth nothing therefore if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt your heart because what you are deity speaking you believe it amen said so and whatever you say shall come to pass if you'll not doubt amen if you can get all of the the world bread out of

shall they offer Bullocks upon thine Altar and go back to one more verse here in verse number seven says Purge me with hup and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow amen we'll take one more scripture in second Timothy chapter two and verse number 19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity but in the great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified in meat for the Master's Ed and prepared unto every good work amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word just for a title this morning we'll call this is the Great Purge the Great Purge of course we know purge means to clean or to be made clean and this is necessary for any plant to grow for any individual to grow you need to be purged Purge me Lord and this is the Great Purge so God bless you you may be seated now this uh little message here it's come upon my heart as I've been going through the great uh subject of standing like Joshua and Caleb and how successful Joshua's Ministry was and if we were to use an example General you'd have to take Joshua as the greatest General biblically speaking and brother Ram even talks about how great of a general he was was he didn't lose any battles because of his faith the only weaknesses in Joshua's Ministry was someone got out of line and they HD a sin and it caused men to fail brother Brandon brings that out that we all can cause failure if one of us is out of line it actually hurts others and this Great Purge had to take place before the children of Israel went into the promised land you had the group of men that had grown cynical they got accustomed to seeing the Miracles of Moses and so they felt very comfortable with complaining with him even to the point they wanted to pick up stones and stone him who bought their freedom they would not be where they were without Moses there is no way there's no plan of getting through anybody's Wilderness let alone the great desert that they were supposed to travel through without Moses so what happened in the relationship where now we want to Stone the man that brought us here so they grown cynical their attitude had grown they become Rusty and well um acquainted with doing things that were wrong and then the Lord correcting them okay Lord we're sorry and we'll come back and do it again and then the Lord would correct them then they come back again it was just this habitual a Crim spree and so they um the Lord had to deal with that and so in dealing with it he caused a great separation and after this great separation now Joshua starts with a fresh group of young men not just young men now he had Elders with him too because not all the elders fell into that sin but it was those that murmured from 20 years old and upward the Lord said I'm done with them I will not let them enter into the promised land so the Lord um let them go through the years of dying off and we call that a purging or a cleansing of the old thinking patterns the old you know calloused heart the old yeah I've been here before I saw it before that kind of attitude brother vam entitled he calls them the old Fighters had to die before we go forward and do things we had never done before and I like to say you know the biblical accounts that you read in the Bible the Old test stories they really begin to work when it becomes your story when the biblical account you can now reflect that in your own life there's some old areas that need to die out in every one of us and our way of thinking our way of approaching things is not fresh it's not new I remember I went to go see my daddy when he was passing away there at the hospital there in Sacramento and he was on his last you know few uh uh days there and we didn't fully know that but he fully expected to come back home he wanted to go back home he was upset with everybody he was mad he wanted to go back home but he couldn't take care of himself the will to live was just still there but I remember going to the hospital room and in that emergency room oh my goodness it was full of hurting people and this person was moaning over here in the corner that one had some kind of pain and my heart was just like oh man all these hurt hurt people and I look behind the counter and the nurses they were just having a great time laughing joking they were teasing one another and I'm because they see it every day and and and they have to I mean you can't embrace all the tragedy because then you wouldn't be helpful to other people so there needs to be a little you know got to be able to ignore some of the things that you see but me coming in there I was just shocked at all of the pain and all of the trauma taking place there but what we don't want to do we don't want to have that approach towards God where yeah Lord I heard that before yeah this is your word yeah it's just a scripture it's just a tape it's just Sunday morning you know if that's your attitude you need to ask God to help you that it stays fresh every day every morning his mercies are new and I need every one of them I need all the mercy I can get every morning yes sir we ought to be grateful and thankful that his mercies are new and they never fail they're there for your benefit they're there to help you they're there to strengthen and you need every drop of his Mercy every moment of your life how many know what I'm talking about yes his mercies are new every morning I don't want to grow cynical over that I don't want to get that to make that an old uh testimony over that so this purge had to take place Israel had to be cleanse that Kadesh Baria so they can go forward and now it was hurtful it's a lot of people died it's a lot of harsh you know relationships had to be cut off and severed but now we can grow sometimes growth happens through cutting away sometimes the best growth is when you lose something and sometimes the Lord needs wants growth out of you so he's demanding more out of you amen and through the scriptures our lord Jesus had to deal with growth that was carnal but then he wanted growth that was spiritual and there's a carnal growth that you can grow in your profession you can grow in your finances you can grow in your health you can grow on every every human level that we all want to grow in as human beings but spiritually am I growing spiritually is that the growth that the church needs the church needs a purging needs a cleansing now David explains it very well in this scripture I like uh Second Timothy Chapter 2 because if you take the beginning part of that chapter I won't take time to get into it uh this morning but he uh uses the example of a soldier he uses the example of a one that strives and that Greek word is a athlete he that striveth so he's using the example of a soldier an athlete and a farmer he uses those three examples and of those three examples you know correction is a must failure is not you can't go into any match any fighting any type of farming thinking of being a failure uh God doesn't have any failures God is a winner and how many times does he win all the time he's never lost a battle he doesn't know what he's undefeated yes yes the god that we our founder is undefeated and he called you to be a part of his army amen I I believe I believe I'm on a winning team this morning I believe we've already won and he called me to part be a part of it this great Army he's undefeated he doesn't lose and there's no place for failure now this this um Great Purge has to take place I want to read a prayer just before it's in the message 1965 um April the 10th 1965 paragraph number 18 I don't think I have it written down here and I forgot to put the title but if you can snatch that up for me real quick sis in the back I would be very grateful yes paragraph 18 this is in the message um can't really see it the Easter seal says allmighty God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who raised him from the dead and has given him unto us the sacrifice and a go back and has given him unto us as the sacrifice and a lord and savior we are so grateful to thee for this privilege that we have this morning to stand in thy presence with thy people that's been redeemed and looking for his glorious second coming to receive us unto himself if there be sin Among Us Lord Purge us with thy hisp and we pray heavenly father that you will heal every sick person's that's in our m is what a prayer what a desire Lord Purge me um this Great Purge had to happen with the church coming through the Wilderness in order for Joshua to be successful it had to happen in Jesus's Ministry for Jesus to be successful has got to happen to the church today in order for the church to be successful has got to happen to the Believers today in order for the believer to be successful can I get a witness now how many know we all need a purging the purge actually cleanses us it takes away the dead weight weight things that we don't need in our life Hebrews 12 or Hebrews 10 says lay aside every sin that does so easily beset us Lord get rid of the Dead weight and that comes in the form of Correction doesn't it how many know they need to be corrected can I see about a witness of your hand being raised or at least raise your eyebrow Lord I need to be corrected oh oh yes we could that sounds very nice to say oh I everybody needs to be corrected I need to be corrected but when it happens how does it feel you know if I somebody said ouch praise the Lord you know we say Amen more times when we really saying ouch but Lord hit me one more time I need it in my life and this message will find out where you're moving where you shouldn't move the word of the Lord will find out where you're living where you shouldn't live your faith is being corrupted the word will find that out and so how does that correction happen happen if I'm the pastor of the church or the coach of the team or the head of a military post of command you know how does that correction happen you know at home correction might happen physically but if I was going to correct any of you all today that would be verbally but how many can say we all still need correction all right so I'm going to correct the organist this morning who played the organ this morning all right perfect example stand up organist or organ player you did a horrible job this morning you didn't practice your cords and your keys like you should have you was not prepared and don't let it happen again do you understand we're all not the organists this morning so we can gladly say oh yeah it's fine now if I pick any of you out and and open like the Bible says correct them openly that others will fear can you receive correction this morning of verbal slashing or or or not so Lord Purge me with hisp I'll tell you what the word says if you can't receive it what kind of child are you huh H you're a bastard child if the temper tantrum takes off how could he embarrass me like that in front of all those people you needed it not me I didn't need it you just said you needed correction no no no if if it's going to be correction it's got to be an old 90y old man to correct me you don't get to pick huh huh Lord help us to be willing to receive correction like you embarrass me in front of the entire board call me on the carpet who does he think he is who does she think she is you know this is needed and we need to get our hearts in tune on who's doing the correcting and then we will receive it from the father this is the problem this is the reason why there's too much parasite parasitical Behavior Uh cankerous conversations and things that develop it's infectious and it spreads because the parasites have to be dealt with it happens on the great plants good plants it happens in every walk and Jesus had to deal with this now the prophet of God takes St John chapter 6 where Jesus boldly makes the proclamation except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you and then he makes the statement that he never explained it I mean he made a statement that his disciples and true followers couldn't understand and he did not explain himself he just left it out there and then he kept on saying hard say to what brother random called to shake off the parasites he had to shake it shake it off of them he looked out at the crowd he said the crowd was too large so he need to cut the crowd back and find out who the real Believers are and how did he do that he did that by preaching on things that were not convenient a little harsh no explanation I mean you're going to bring a subject up like that at least give an explanation he didn't give one what was he doing he was shaking their faith he was trying in them and he still does it today he tries the believer every son gets tested every daughter gets tested and child trained to see where their faith is Joshua and Caleb saw the same obstacles that the rest of them saw but look what did they say they took a stand on God's word didn't they and so do you and I we see the same thing we have the same Temptations our jobs and the atmospheres out there we all see the ugliness going on but who is going to stay on the Lord's Side okay now what would you prefer what's better for you a fake friend or a real enemy think about that what would you prefer to deal with a fake friend or a real enemy I prefer to deal with a real enemy because I know what I'm dealing with but Israel had a lot of mixed a mixed multitude unbelievers there that were sprinkled in there now brother grham makes this statement about the gifts of the Spirit and the world is falling apart paragraph 147 he says we wonder today why the gifts and things are not in the church operating the way they should be why the gifts are put in the in put put in the church to separate and take sin out to keep the church clean it's God's toxin that's given to the church it's God's also his disinfect that he puts into the church to kill out all the parasites that tear up the church and God sprays his church over with his word and that keeps all the termite out you know so the church can grow a plant and God knows what it takes to do it well you say it's just like a baby crying for your razor when you're shaving your little baby was hollering give me that razor Daddy give me that razor your little son two or three years old just scream jumping up and down on the floor give the razor well you know better than to do that you wouldn't give that baby that razor he doesn't know how to handle it and that's the reason we don't find no more Divine gifts than what we do they push it off on some kind of tradition over in some denomination they don't know how to handle it God knows what to do with it so you know who who who wants the gifts of the Spirit in their Church sure who wants the gifts of God a Godly gift in your life manifested sure but if you can't handle it you'll do more harm than good and some of us can't even handle just a little verbal slashing or lashing we can't handle a little Flex against someone said whatever they said about you or about your daughter or about your son and you can't even praise the Lord no more someone bumped up against you you just bumped you in one way or the other one carnal way or the other roll their eyes at you and then you roll your eyes back at them but Lord give me a gift Lord send the anointing upon me so you can use me you know what um he's not going to give that he can't give that if you're not ready for it so what he'll do he'll prepare the church and get them ready so he can use them and whatever it takes Lord whatever it takes to get me in the place where I need to be that's what I want that's what the True Believer desires and I believe this Great Purge is taking place now we know there'll be a great Purge in the Great Tribulation we know that the the foolish virgin is purged through the things that she suffers and tries and and that she'll go through the fire of great and horrible persecution and even the church to today is being persecuted on many many levels that's really honing our faith in to what is really important what if God would send a purging process to you this morning could you take it well if you're a True Believer you could and this um operation of the gifts the prophet brings it that you know the baby's not ready for it he goes forward he talks about how in in Jesus's Ministry this is in the message God is identified by his characteristics and he says this here paragraph 115 he says before Abraham was I am see they didn't understand it he was shaking them parasites off of him today we have to beg and plead and Pat and beg and persuade and promise and Christians to come to church if they come to church we'll do so and so Jesus when he was on Earth he had too many with him he looked around and seen the congregation he wanted to get rid of them he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you could you imagine a doctor sitting there this man wants to make uh us to be a human vampire drink his blood nonsense all you people walk away and leave that crazy man alone alone they walked away he never explained it he didn't have to explain it he shakes your faith sometime to see what you'll do and he's doing the same thing in this day yes let it seem spooky to you a little bit to see where you stand whether you really believe amen how many know he shakes our faith today too yes he shakes our faith he makes you question makes you wonder what does that mean what's that statement mean there's places all throughout the Bible the scriptures we've been talking a little bit about marriage and divorce and there's more questions even still surrounding it and all those questions have not been answered to every detail tell but the True Believer stays with the original word Giver the original source of life that is Christ the word that's this word that's coming our day we stay with it even though we don't have all of the explanations so as a gospel preacher we proclaim the good news that doesn't necessarily mean that we explain the good news we're not explainers we're Proclaim ERS we're here to say what the word already said we go into the word and find out what is said and we say the same thing but then now explain it we can't we don't we we can't explain it all it's not given Jesus did not have to explain himself he could have but he chose not to why he was shaking off the parasites he was letting something develop he was trying to show them who they really are Lord we love you so much whatever you say we're with you to the end oh it feels so good to see this lame man healed oh you brought my mom in she's not on crutch us anymore you healed her of her cancer oh we're with you to the end Lord Jesus until he starts making these statements and he starts making these statements we re it reveals that they really had a problem because he wouldn't explain himself now he still does it today now praise the Lord so he makes statements that he doesn't explain all the time he never explained it what was he doing shaking off the parasites in the message influence 1964 he makes this statement here paragraph uh 166 I wonder 165 so then he sent the great congregation he seen the great congregations he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood you have no life in you he never explained it I wonder if he would say that in bont today no matter how popular he was what do you think doctors and cultured people and scientists would say the man is a vampire he wants you to drink his blood well what kind of a you are going off on a tantrum Jes Jesus never explained it he wanted to shake them parasites off of him that's right then they all got up and left then he looked around to those Apostles which was not which was not ordained to life but he had chosen them they wasn't ordained he says what will will you say when you see the son of man ascending up into heaven from whence he come oh that was a choker what did he then Minister says ascend into heaven well this man was born right here in galileia he was born in Nazareth we know his mother his brothers we know the Cradle he was rocked in we seen his baby clothes he speak to his mother and then say this man come and go back up where he come from he come from Nazareth what does he say heaven he never explained it too many parasites yet they got up they walk with him no more that's what the Bible said then he turned around and says you all want to go too to the 12 remember they couldn't explain it but they knowed it they knowed he was so they said to him he had influenced them by his Vindicated signs from God Amen he does the same thing today you know there's some areas in the message I don't speak on them all the time I'm going to a little bit more as I feel to but I know there's some areas in the message that are hot topics or hot spots for some of you all or some of the listeners but they're in the word and what interests what interests me is like why is everybody so up they get themselves all in the bind over some of these statements when they're actually on the tape surrounding the third pool you talk start talking about the third pool my brother Chuck is like who okay wait wait wait where you going with this well let me just quote the scriptures let me quote the prophet I was talking with some ministers one time and you know and and you know that this one of these subjects came up and I and I asked a few of the brothers there I said you know what's interesting to me if I get up and I preach about how the word is in the bride and the bride and the ministry today has all of the signs and wonders with them and Christ is with this this ministry today nobody has a problem always say amen and I say the same thing and imply it over to the prophet in his message and like whoa where you going with that and I I'm that makes me want to dig into it more because because the eagle can fly as high as he needs to it's in the word we fly with it amen there is no quote that makes me back up there's a quotes I embrace those now I back up with men's ideas all the time but you start reading them quotes it don't bother me one bit all of them they're beautiful to me I love them but you know Jesus made statements and this message has statements in it that throws people off and there's statements that are made without an explanation could you imagine Abraham trying to explain how he's going to have a baby with grandmother and himself they don't have any children there is no evidence of them ever going to have any children but the Lord puts that burden on on him to say that he's going to have a child anyway it was impossible but when the angel came to her that afternoon came to that home that afternoon the angel said is there anything too hard for the Lord don't tell me what you haven't never seen before don't tell me it's never happened before is there anything too hard for the Lord is there a problem he can't solve a sickness he can't heal a a situation he can't solve there is nothing too hard for our God Amen there is nothing too hard The Impossible is possible with the god that we serve but he throws things out there that is in inexplicable there's no explanation for it and does that on purpose the prophet is showing us that he does this to throw off the parasites he calls them he gives this example with Father Abraham and he says that Abraham after he shook off the parasite lot he called lot a parasite parasites sometimes are people negative negative negative every time you see them they ain't got nothing positive to say just hanging around looking for opportunity see I told you I knew it wasn't going to work I told you you should have kicked out I told you you should have quit I knew it wasn't going to work all of this negativity and that's a spirit now that's a spirit that gets on people you know that's not the Ministry of our of our Lord Jesus that's not the ministry of the Holy Spirit the ministry of the holy spirit is positive it's the word of the Lord is Raising you up into something that's great that's postive the negativity no that's not God that's Satan's language I'm not much of a Believer I I cannot have any faith you know those statements are appropriate if you finish it off properly Lord I'm not much of a Believer I haven't done what I was supposed to do I'm ashamed but today I claim your blood and I know you'll make a way for me to come up out of my condition yes we know you're a failure but through Christ he answers the failure questions for you you don't leave it on the negative you bring it right on through Christ is the propitiation for our sins for our weaknesses for our troubles absolutely so what does he do he allows the parasites to be shook off of you some of us all of us need some of this unbelief shaken off of us Jesus is dealing with it here in calling Jesus on the scene and he says this here paragraph 88 bunch of unbeliever Bel vers Jesus wanted to shake off a bunch of parasites one day he had too many following him he had his disciples then he had the 70 the ministerial Assan then he had a congregation by the thousands then he made this statement he said except you eat the blood eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you now what do you think a medical doctor would say say heading out in the congregation what do you think a sensible thinking man would what would he call Sensible thinking he never explained it he didn't have to explain it why the doctor would say get away from that fellow he's crazy will be human vampires drinking the blood of the man eating his flesh in the congregation I imagine the priest said this is the time here is where we come in out we we go we'll never attend another one of the meetings away they went then he got all of them away from him he turned around he said to the 70 he says what will you say when you see the son of man ascending up into heaven from whence he come now the 70 said the son of man ascending up from whence he come why he has had us at the very we he has had us at the very manger where he was born we know his mother we seen the clothes the swaddling cloth he was wrapped in he was born down there in Bethlehem of Judea he was brought up over here in Nazareth there is his brothers his sisters and all of them with us then he said this son of man ascended up now he didn't explain it he just said it now they couldn't explain it they couldn't fix it out in their mind this is what they're trying to do they're trying to make it make sense in their mind a lot of intellectual preaching does the same thing they try to take all the loose ends of the prophet and make all the Loose Ends match as if you are a prophet oh the prophet didn't match it up then leave it the way it is he left some statements just hanging out just like that and when as a gospel preacher you have to have the discipline to just to say it just like he said it amen de brothers that's irresponsible to make a statement and not back it up and not bring an explanation I am not an explainer I'm a proclaimer i Proclaim what is in the Bible what is on those tapes that's my mission that's my commission that's what I'll be held accountable for not that everybody's mental understanding can come up to par no no it's we start by saying this is what the word say says okay is that a good starting point that's where we start this is what the quote says this is what the message says and then go from [Applause] there amen and that's a difficult discipline in an age of explanations and very smart people they want to help the prophet out they want to help the Bible out help Jesus out Jesus doesn't doesn't need any help like that he just needs you to be a witness of what he said stand out there and say it like he said it the explanation will come in its due time some things will be explained on the other side amen praise the Lord like the half hour of s silence we don't understand all of that I can take all the quotes on a half hour of silence and this quote and match this in my scientific uh re in and get a little Beaker and another Beaker and mix it together oh this is what it is this is what the half hour of silence is it's that church over there these explanations have come and gone over the years I've seen them I seen them come and G but you know what hasn't changed praise the Lord this right here has not changed and what is on those tapes has not changed all the intellectual understanding oh my I was reading a vision to a a brother we were just talking about it years ago I said what about this Vision here the prophet oh you got to hear Reverend so and so back East he explains all of that what tape was that chapter and verse quote title year give it to me I'm talking about the prophet now I don't live back East I I want something right here in the desert give me show show me on the tapes my brother where I can feed on this I want to say Amen right now give it to me what the prophet said no no no no put the prophet down you need to go hear Reverend so and so explain all of that time to get up and walk out of that restaurant I tell you that you go into a restaurant and their bathroom is dirty and you going to sit there and eat if you get sick sick that's on you because what they're telling you is like this is what we think about our bathroom what do you think their kitchen looks like all right y'all y'all making me get I went through New Mexico one time we did his job one time where am I at can I be at home I'm at home coming to Mexico one time we went to this Mexican restaurant was was that you no Sharon wasn't with me it was another worker we went into this Mexican restaurant and we went in there get ready to order food we ordered whatever to drink I said where's your restaurant at oh our bathroom isn't working you the water is off the bathroom's not working where the dishwashers washing their hands at who who's using the restroom around here like you know what here's a tip a $2 tip I'm out of here if you can't get your bathroom together how you going to serve me a b we though and that's just natural food I'm a picky eater I'm a picky eater I'm a picky eater some of you are picky too you need to be picky on the word that you're feed it on where did the prophet say that that's a simple question that's not argumentative said I want to say amen I want to high five you where did the prophet say that oh the prophet didn't say that well amen somebody so there's some statements that he did make that he did not explain and he left them hanging like that the disciples couldn't explain it either but they had Faith Jesus turned and looked to the 12 and says will you go also then Peter made those notable words Lord where would we go for we are fully persuaded we know that you have the word of life and you alone they couldn't explain how they was going to eat his flesh and drink his blood they couldn't understand how he was going to ascend up from where he come down from when he was born in Bethlehem they couldn't but see Faith don't know no failure it's anchored it stays there no matter what anything else with anything said it stayed there they were ordained to this life they stayed there how many's glad about that the word of the Lord to give you the power to stay right there you stay with what the word says amen he never explained it he just kept right on I like how he puts it here and when their eyes was open they knew him you were the prophet of God says here per paragraph 66 He makes himself God he tries to be equal with god well he was he was the son of God and he says you call them who the word of word came to your law says that that the word came to the prophets and you call them Gods then if you could call a prophet God how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God search the scriptures they're the one who tells you what I'm supposed to do if you don't do anything to what the word says I'm to do then don't believe me but if I do the works of My Father which is the word then believe the works that I do still they could not do it so Jesus said one day now watch he don't explain things he just says it notice he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you could you imagine find intellectual bunch of people people a bunch of doctors standing out there rabbis real trained Highly Educated people thought when he said that oh I can imagine the doctor look over and say woo the ministers get up say uh-huh uh-huh see that brought it out right there now he never explained that he never explained it he didn't have to he didn't have to explain it what a rest in knowing that he can make those statements without having to explain it can we rest that way too can we rest in that this is what the word says I don't have to exp it's not my burden to explain I don't have to prove it to anyone let me say this about explanations you remember when they said if you just come off the cross we'll believe you I imagine there's a sympathetic believer there sitting I remember as a little boy I asked my mom I says mom why didn't Jesus just come off the cross and improve to them and then it would have been like aha see see I I I am who I said I was you know what but that wouldn't have been enough for them there's no explanation that would have ever been good enough for them if he would have came off the cross and did it again they would have said oh you didn't do it fast enough or you came down the wrong side well let me see you do it again and it's a big entertainment look look watch he's about to come off the cross watch this oh wow he came off the cross wow woo wow wow and then you run off the same sin that you're doing it doesn't change anybody the Miracles doesn't change nobody it only catches your attention to the word and once your attention is caught you receive the word now the word has the power to change any man but he uses the signs wonders and miracles to catch your attention to what to the word and do a basketball team and another entertainment and another program to keep the people happy and keeping them coming and give them the little treats and little stars and then you know yeah watch how you correct him you got to be careful you got to walk kind of walk in backwards when you going to correct him don't say nothing sh be quiet be be careful you what how long is he a newcomer no he been in the message for 20 years be careful how you approach him on this subject Lord help us H I want to be able to take the word no matter where it's coming if it's God's word take it amen yeah be careful you tell that read that quote to him in the morning he might leave it's not that you said it's how you said it to me big baby big cry baby what did the word say it's only the babies getting mad right now a son or a daughter of God I had my feelings hurt right have you it don't feel good right but do you need it we all agree that we do need it but then when it comes we don't you know not like that you're disrespected be like what did the word say my brother my sister what did the word say all of this padding on the back and temperamental and you know feelings I feel like I feel like I feel my feelings what did the word say huh I'm not trying to be annoying I'm trying to make a point here that the parasites need to come off of you my feelings need to come off of my personal my culture well in my culture we don't you know we do this we don't he I got to let my culture go I got to let my culture go what did the word say Lord help us you keep people longer you fluff them and you you you you stroke them and then you know like that Pentecostal cat he says you sitting on that pillow he say Pentecostal cat in the vision he's stroking so as you stroking him he's hey man oh we just love that those sermons on love love love and then you start talking about something against that cat you go the opposite way the green eyes came out up wait I thought we was Christians in here you were supposed to be a Pentecostal what you getting all them mad for I'm out of here why you mad bro the quote the if the quote made you mad you should have got mad that's right and then come to the Altar and deal with that feeling they get personal all the time we want it to be personal we wanted to be personal relationship between the Lord Jesus Christ I don't want any parasites on me I really don't you know and I want the word of the Lord to to be to have its free course in my life now the Apostle Paul says to purge yourself from these things and then you would be a vessel un to honor now Jesus the prophet of God is reading I'm reading from the prophet he says he never explained it he don't explain things paragraph number 73 let me get this is here in the message and their eyes were open they knew it all right let's go to paragraph number 75 they looked at one another well the son of man ascending up from where he come from well we know his mother we know his brother his sister seeing his manger he was laid in where he was born we seen the Cradle he was rocked in he come from Nazareth coming up there is a hard saying and they didn't walk with him no more see now all the time these disciples stood right there they didn't know it either but they believed it they couldn't explain it he never explained it but see they were ordained to life they couldn't explain it but you see there so he turned and said I've chose 12 out of you one is a devil he says do you want to go also and there is where Peter made those Memorial words Lord we are persuaded that you have the word of life alone where were we go to that was it you see he didn't explain it he said that so that they would turn down see Faith don't ask it don't reason it searches the scriptures for it if they had searched the scriptures there would have been proven who he was so beautiful point and I want to lay this in there to you Saints today there is that generic lazy position that many Believers take well I'm just saying what saying what the tape say I'm just saying what the word says and it is leave it out like that no explanation they don't have no source of where the the background of it but but here the Jesus said search the scriptures and them you'll find eternal life so there still is the burden for you to search the scripture because the scripture is the discipline that every believer must live by so we just don't grab a quote and throw it out there like the subject of marriage and divorce he says go home and take the scriptures and then study it and pray about it that discipline still needs to be there we don't use that as an excuse well he said it that's it and you just walk away uh uh did you search the scripture on it did you pick up your Bible on the subject I'm talking about brothers sisters everybody Jesus said to search the scriptures and we'll get into that in second Timothy in just a moment there's still a burden for the believer to pick up your Bible you need to be healed yeah go get the scriptures on healing you know we don't have to be a the we don't have to be able to stand in front of a group and to explain it but in your heart you need to have a word where the Lord said it right here that you can anchor your faith into can I get a witness this morning you go out here witnessing to somebody they're in the denomination and you give them a quote it's like where'd you get that from well brother random said it and you just walk off like if you're GNA be witnessing to somebody you probably should read your Bible too am huhuh like water baptism that's in the Bible the godhead explained that's scriptures what did the prophet do he brought us the scriptures and so it doesn't give us that out of laziness just to read a quote or throw a quote out there and not run through the discipline of searching the scriptures can I get a witness yes some of our friends Believers families whatever in the message a very biblically um what's the word I can use unsound a little lame biblically speaking won't pick up the scripture won't run it through and bring what the B what Jesus if you can pick up a quote you should be able to pick up a scripture too that's right somebody is the book of Timothy written just to the brothers are there some scriptures that are only for brothers and some for only for sisters or is it for believers pick up your Bible sis pick up your Bible my brother it is the best thing that God can give it's your friend pick it up it'll speak to you every day read it and then do what pray you want to draw closer to the Lord read your Bible and pray how many time every day praise the Lord oh my God bless you richly can I go a little bit further let me get a little bit further here so he says paragraph 78 he didn't explain it he said that so they would turn down see Faith don't ask it don't reason it searches what does the faith do it searches the scriptures for it if they had searched the scriptures there it would have been proven who he was but he shook them off like that by saying things and never explained it beautiful beautiful how many like that so let's take a little bible For You Second Timothy chapter 2 in verse number 15 now if you didn't have a Bible that'd be different if you couldn't read that'd be different right but most of us in the in the US we're we're literate we can read absolutely second Timothy Chapter 2 thou there for my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus so where does strength come from and the things that thou Hast heard of me among many witnesses saying commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others thou therefore do what endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ there's Joshua right there no man that Warth entangle himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier now you're called by God to be a soldier verse number five If any man also strive for masteries this is athletes this is an athletic Paul is talking about yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully what about in sports today I mean a real disciplined athlete has to be in tune with his body he has to be in tune with whatever athlete he's doing whatever sport he's doing it's baseball it's fo ball you have practice and then you have plays and you have things that you have to work on you have arguably a coach right you don't know it all you need somebody watching over you in this Sports and Paul gives the sports analogy some of us can witness to that I was raised playing sports I played team sports and I had coaches and I had some coaches that swore at me and yelled at me and one coach almost made me cry he yelled at me so hard and so harsh and I didn't go home and tell my mom or my daddy I sucked it up because I was a part of this team and I'm not advocating for that but if you are on a team I mean you're on you're part of a team right and not everybody can play football or basketball say well son you can be anything you want to do uh I don't think so some folks came around some people can't jump no you can go at the YMCA but you can't be on this team why because we want to win right you can go get us some water and you can cheer us along inspiration but we can't have you on the court son but coach I wanted to be a quarterback son you can't play but I wanted to be a quarterback you're sorry you need another you need a person to look you in the face and tell you that for real because mama and Auntie Mabel and all them supporting you and buying you the new Nikes in the little head gear and dropping you off at the park expecting you to play and nobody told you you sorry you can't play or do we want to be lied to all the time oh I can play I'm good yeah I'm good I'm going to get out there your peers will tell you real quick man get off the we'll play without you get off the team we'll be one man down get out get coach get him out of here how many know what I'm talking about sure that's coach this is this is your Apostle Paul talking about if you strive you got to strive lawfully look at the great this baseball and the cycling the drug use and the the the the the doping scandals that have been um that that that have come to light because a man's competition trying to win wanting to win and be great and so much and so much that he'll break the rules and take some drugs to enhance his performance and in get out there and now want to fight and strive on supposed to be an equal playing field but he's cheating he's a cheater he didn't pray didn't study he's quoting somebody else let me let me move that on there I mean look here Saints if you come to church for the pastor to give you material so you can live your Christian Journey you ain't going to make it every believer must come through their own test their own trials and pick up your own Bible and read it read it till it makes you cry read it until you feel it in your bones read it till it becomes your Bible your message your Prophet your lord Jesus and you're going to a home that he prepared for you in glory and then when they catch you up you'll give your life honorably because you had a divine revelation for yourself a lot of people cheating they look like believers they know how to argue like one too but longer the day is gone when I'm going to be quoting somebody else I'm going to quote this Prophet quote this Bible so he talks about this where was I at all right right the athlete the athlete and then he goes further into this strive for masteries and then verse six the husbandman that labor Earth must first be partakers of the fruit he talks about the farmer and him embracing the fruits of your labor there's nothing wrong with enjoy ing the fruits of your hard work like Joshua he had to embrace the commission that you was with Moses I will be well Lord I'm not worthy I will be with you as I was with Moses you got to embrace that commission can you Embrace that he's forgiven you of all your sins can you receive that that the grace is unmar can you Embrace that he has forgot all of the crimes that were against you and put them underneath the blood never to be brought up against you anymore can you receive that this morning or you have to be good enough before you can come and pray I feel more annoyed I feel like I'm good enough now and I'm not good I'm not worthy to take communion how so many people say I'm not worthy to take the Lord's Supper take communion show me a man that is worthy I know of one that was worthy that's our Lord Jesus Christ and he and right here at the cross made him worthy he won he won at Calvary he got up from the grave he won every battle and I'm in him so can you Embrace that you know a farmer can't settle for failure an athlete doesn't go into a match thinking he's going to lose if he does just go ahead and stay home you got to believe you're going to win huh in the military could you imagine a military force could you imagine the Army going into battle thinking man we're going to lose I don't feel good about this guys no you want you want some crazy folks you want some people who don't know what defeat is you want some folks that's like yeah oo I can't wait get me on the baller not the guy hiding I hope they don't call my petal I hope they don't call our group that's how some Believers are I hope they don't call on me aren't you a soldier yeah I'm a soldier I got the uniform are you a soldier uniformer now or you're a soldier in your heart but them real Bo boys and real you know a 911 hit the real men they was like oh yes yes let's go get the enemy let's go get them I'm ready to die for my country today these are the men you want on your team these are the men you want in your group these are the athletes these are the farmers these are the people who know no defeat and the Apostle Paul is using this example here and he says if you're striving for masteries if a man also strive for Mastery yet he is not crowned except he strive lawfully you got to play by the rules amen somebody can I get a witness somebody say keep going Pastor keep going brother yeah somebody said it everybody didn't say it but somebody said it right and 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 19 says this nevertheless the foundation of God standed sure having this seal see I skipped the verse here let me go back and get pick up what I want all right what time is lunch today anyways huh we need to change the way you think about lunch some of y'all can let a lunch go for a little bit you too right everybody's still smiling God bless you can I take a little piece here I want to get this little part right here so here back to this discipline of faith Faith searches the scriptures Faith does that so Faith isn't just out there like I believe it you know the prophet said it and I just walking all day long when's the last time you read your Bible I don't need my Bible I just listened to the tape that ain't what the tape said that is not what the tape said I don't care how good that may sound how anointed you felt when you said it that is not what the tape said the tapes always pointed you back to your Bible back to the Lord Jesus Christ back to Calvary back to an oldfashioned altar back to the Holy Ghost back to a life change that's what the tape said any ministry will point you to the same thing let me close right here verse number 10 therefore are and do all things for elect's sake that they may obtain salvation which which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no Prophet but to the subverting of hearers study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needed not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth Now is this scripture only to men only only to pastors only only to ministers only or is this scripture to the Bride of Jesus Christ huh is it for everybody or not it's for every body study to do what show yourself approved unto what oh I let everybody else know let everybody no unto God I'm studying before the Lord Show Yourself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth and then it gives us something to be careful of and I have to give this to you put them in remember study show but shine provan and vain babblings for they will increase unto more what ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a say it with me canker now that word canker is the same word it's a disease it's the Gang Green disease disease specifically it's what it's talking about it's infectious it it um it's spread and it it uh not it's influence but it what does it does it spreads what's another word for spreads it's it's contagious yes and if you don't deal with it it gets worse and let me give this to you just for a moment all right and it talked about these these men's their words hus and this other gentleman their words spread oh my I left it but it's okay I'm closing now anyways but that word there it eats as a Anker and before I was the Holy Spirit I was meditating on the Lord I was driving to this funeral I was thinking about cancers and how words are cancer there's cancerous words that people say and there's things that the cancerous radio programs cancerous news cancerous entertainment and it gets into you start hearing that stuff and the Bible said says to any man that would Purge himself from these things will be a vessel unto honor you got to you got to purge your ears from hearing that cancerous stuff because it spreads and what it does it even CS the faith of others to be overthrown and that Gang Green is the worst parasite you can think of but the word of the Lord is sharper than any two-edged sword it's meant to cut and to chop away and to remove and this is how you stay pure this is how you stay clean by staying with the word the word of the Lord cleanses the believer and Jesus needed to cleanse his congregation so he brought Doctrine he brought teaching to them to cleanse that group and what did it do it P P out this one left that one got up and left I knew it that group took off yeah whatever and that one and all these groups took off and here what do he have left just 12 he said will you go also he says no Lord you have the words of eternal life out of you know he had he had the 70 he had the multitude he had the 12 one of them was a devil it's like Lord you you know you're cutting everything back you're cutting everything back and all he was left with the 11 but they were real Believers and these 11 men went to different parts of the world and changed the neighborhood they was living in and God used them mightily that's why we're in the word today because the disciples the real Disciples of Jesus carried on his work carried on this word amen so God richly bless you the Great Purge is taking place it starts by the word coming forth he grows us by cutting us sometimes he didn't explain it and disciples couldn't explain it Jesus didn't explain it the disciples couldn't explain it but there it still the there is still the truth but it's still because we don't explain it doesn't mean we don't run through the discipline of finding it in the word search the scriptures for and you'll be be searching for the rest of your life but you don't stop searching is that right you can't explain it all you don't understand it all you will never understand it all but Timothy said to study to show yourself approved and this is how you cleanse yourself from the parasites and all the foolishness of our day God bless you so much richly I press I trust the Lord will bless you tonight the Lord willing brother Eli Castillo will be with us tonight a very fine brother he's been with us before if the Lord Wills I believe that's um the plan he's coming in he's out of Phoenix but he's coming in from the New Mexico funeral that was his auntie that passed and spoke with him a little bit and he going to share the word of the Lord with us amen all right don't you love him oh God bless you richly let me take one more scripture okay let's all stand as we take this in St John chapter 21 verse 22 Jesus saith unto him he's speaking of John if I will that he tar till I come what is that to thee follow thou me I'll let you get there St John chap 21: 22 when you have it you can say Amen all right we'll wait let some of you get your Bible scripture for you you get home read the whole chapter of course read all that you can Jesus said unto him if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me then went the saying abroad among the Brethren that that disciple should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he tar till I come what is that to thee this is the disciple which testified of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true so Jesus makes a statement a saying goes out from the statement Jesus didn't go back and clean it up make sure no that's not what I meant that's not what I said the saying went out the disciple is not going to taste death and John was the oldest one oldest disciple but the rumor went out that Jesus said he's going to stay alive Jesus never said that and he let it go on he let it go on and he let some rumors go on too little things people say stuff said stuff about the prophet don't you think the prophet heard the lies that was told about him the little side deals people were making and stuff but he stayed with the word and Jesus still makes statements and allows statements to be made need to test your faith if you're looking for a AA moment to say oh I knew this was false there is a moment for you to find but if you're a Believer there's nothing that can be said that'll Shake A True Believer amen God bless you let us pray the musicians come Lord Jesus bless your people thank you for your word this morning I'm going through a purging right now each
