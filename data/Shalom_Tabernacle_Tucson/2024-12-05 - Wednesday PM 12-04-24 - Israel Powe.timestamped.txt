[24:22] evening amen welcome you to the house of
[24:25] the Lord so good to hear brother will
[24:28] that special I think that's his first
[24:30] time doing that God bless him
[24:33] richly
[24:35] amen all right so right in the
[24:38] scriptures in 1 Peter chapter 3 we like
[24:42] to turn there just for a moment thank
[24:45] you
[24:46] musicians so good to have our brother
[24:49] George back I heard good reports from
[24:52] his meetings
[24:53] there and uh some of you saints that
[24:57] wasn't feeling well that has made it
[24:59] back God bless you good to have each of
[25:01] you back we'll go take this little
[25:04] subject we were we
[25:07] started a week or two ago on respects
[25:11] and we want to continue just to take
[25:14] another portion of that I think it was
[25:17] on the
[25:18] 17th yeah a couple Sundays ago and then
[25:21] we listened to the tape
[25:23] respects and so let's take our script
[25:29] scures 1 Peter chapter
[25:44] 3 in verse
[25:46] S likewise ye husbands dwell with them
[25:51] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[25:54] the wife as
[25:55] unto the weaker vessel
[25:58] and as being hirs together of the grace
[26:01] of life that your prayers be not
[26:05] hindered amen one more scripture found
[26:09] over in
[26:11] Psalms 105
[26:30] I believe it's Psalms
[26:39] 105 and the scripture says here
[26:43] verse number 12 when they were but a few
[26:47] men in number yeah very few and
[26:50] strangers in it when they went from one
[26:53] nation to another from one Kingdom to
[26:56] another he suffered no man to do them
[27:00] wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their
[27:04] sakes saying touch not my anointed and
[27:08] do my prophets no harm amen may God add
[27:13] a blessing to the reading of his word
[27:15] you may be seated amen so brother banam
[27:19] as we know he takes that scripture and
[27:20] he preaches the message
[27:23] respects and the
[27:26] last week that we were here we we were
[27:30] talking to you about how we want to get
[27:34] God's respect and really you know it be
[27:37] nice if everybody respected us like they
[27:40] should and we respected everyone like we
[27:43] should but as I was meditating even on
[27:46] that thought if I had to choose one or
[27:49] the other and I pose that to you to
[27:52] would you rather everyone respect
[27:56] you perfectly
[27:59] or would you rather have that ability
[28:02] to handle the way anyone would treat
[28:07] you and um I think from Brother Billy
[28:12] Paul's own testimony talking about his
[28:14] dad he said that was one of his greatest
[28:18] things that he noticed he knew how to
[28:20] handle every
[28:22] situation and so it's going to be now if
[28:25] you choose the first and you expect
[28:28] expect everyone to treat you
[28:30] respectfully perfectly at all
[28:33] times that is not even going to happen
[28:37] if you're the only one in the
[28:41] room exactly and if we go around
[28:45] thinking or expecting everyone to treat
[28:49] us properly at all times that's just not
[28:51] going to happen but I can achieve the
[28:54] goal or look forward to the goal of re
[28:58] acting to whatever comes my way properly
[29:02] and respectfully so we took a little bit
[29:05] of of that in how God respected Abel's
[29:09] sacrifice and how in James it says it is
[29:14] a sin to have respect of persons it's
[29:17] actually a sin now I want to turn there
[29:19] quickly because that dealt with we got
[29:23] into Peter and to Paul and
[29:26] how they Peter had a hard time accepting
[29:30] the Gentiles into the
[29:33] kingdom because of their nationality
[29:36] because of their race because of
[29:38] whatever the way Peter was
[29:41] raised and that was a hindrance for him
[29:44] and it happens to all types of people
[29:47] all walks of life human beings have this
[29:49] problem the disciples had this problem
[29:53] and in James chapter 1
[29:59] in verse number what scripture am I
[30:01] looking for
[30:03] Saints yes verse number no not
[30:16] 13 no not
[30:19] seven all right let's go back may we're
[30:22] in James chapter 2 then
[30:28] yes 21 and then it goes down so we'll
[30:31] take two verses one my brethren have not
[30:34] the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the
[30:37] lord of Glory with respect of persons
[30:41] then he goes into how if a rich man
[30:43] comes into the assembly I will give him
[30:46] preferential treatment but verse number
[30:50] nine says this very clearly and this
[30:52] looks at all of us in the face but if
[30:55] you have respect to persons what does it
[30:59] say ye commit sin and are convinced of
[31:03] the law as
[31:06] transgressors so when you respect people
[31:10] over other
[31:11] people um that's not scriptural then
[31:15] James says it's a sin and this is a
[31:18] weakness that we all can fall pre to you
[31:22] know part of foot washing and communion
[31:24] deals with this when you go down to wash
[31:28] somebody's feet who you perceive is
[31:30] beneath you are not worthy of your time
[31:35] to I mean I sure I'll wash this
[31:37] important person's feet or this person I
[31:41] know their feet are probably clean so
[31:44] I'll be more comfortable you know you
[31:47] need to check that you really do you
[31:50] have people in the congregation that you
[31:53] can't wash their feet that's probably a
[31:56] you problem it's a human problem but you
[31:59] need to deal with that and the
[32:00] scriptures don't lie and the scriptures
[32:02] not pointing at you or pointing at me
[32:05] it's pointing at all of us and this is
[32:08] what the Bible says he's talking about a
[32:10] man with Godly apparel comes in looking
[32:13] sharp looking nice and you go into a
[32:16] restaurant they're going to treat you a
[32:17] certain way and I get off of work and
[32:20] I'm in my painting clothes I have
[32:22] overspray on me and I go into some
[32:24] circle Cavs they're going to treat me a
[32:26] certain way I go into that same Circle K
[32:29] on a Sunday they're going to treat me a
[32:31] certain way I'm the same person they
[32:34] don't know me just like they didn't know
[32:35] me before but looking on the outside to
[32:39] begin to judge and to have respect of
[32:42] persons it is sin and that happens in
[32:46] churches so God help us right and so but
[32:50] there is a respect that we are to have
[32:52] for one another brother bam or the
[32:55] scriptures talking about um those that
[32:57] labor and the word to have double honor
[32:59] for them it speaks about that how we're
[33:02] to love and respect husband and wife
[33:04] love and respect each other but tonight
[33:07] I just want to deal with the respect of
[33:11] the weaker vessel and this is the
[33:14] respect the husband should have towards
[33:16] his wife and it goes
[33:18] even uh on the
[33:21] spiritual application I think it's in
[33:25] the um Ephesians chap Church age
[33:29] book the prophet of God says this here I
[33:32] don't think I gave that to you sis but
[33:34] if you can find it for me that'd be
[33:36] great it says the Ephesians Church AG
[33:39] says how beautifully the Savior praises
[33:42] and commends his children he takes full
[33:46] account of their fine spiritual
[33:48] attitudes and behavior he knows that
[33:52] there is weakness amongst them but as
[33:55] yet he does not cry out against it
[33:58] isn't that just like the Lord he knows
[34:01] how to encourage Us in the right matters
[34:04] and discourage Us in the wrong matters
[34:08] we could all learn a good lesson right
[34:10] here in running the church and our
[34:15] families and better still we could all
[34:17] learn a good lesson in that God deals
[34:20] with each one of us in exactly this way
[34:24] don't ever be discouraged s of God for
[34:26] God is Not ungracious to forget your
[34:29] labors of love amen
[34:33] so there was so much ground that we got
[34:37] into we talked about the gossiper the
[34:40] tail Bearer we talked about how Saul
[34:43] lost his position in Christ because he
[34:45] feared the people's
[34:47] faces and
[34:49] um and but in Psalms
[34:53] 105 as God was dealing with Israel he
[34:57] says when you were few men in number yay
[35:00] very few he suffered no man to do them
[35:05] wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their
[35:09] sakes and this is God speaking he says
[35:13] touch not mine anointed and do my
[35:17] prophets no harm now who are the
[35:19] anointed ones those are the Saints those
[35:21] are not just preachers those are not
[35:24] just leaders or brothers those are the
[35:28] Saint the anointed ones those are the
[35:31] brothers and the sisters and so there's
[35:34] a respect that we have to that God
[35:36] Demands a respect for his children and
[35:41] we should have the utmost respect for
[35:43] one another amen and in doing that it
[35:47] really shows our love when we really
[35:50] love someone we'll try to cover them we
[35:52] won't try to expose them when you love
[35:56] someone you won't don't gossip about
[35:58] them you'll try to bring it in you bring
[36:01] them to that place that they need to be
[36:06] now uh the scripture is very clear and
[36:09] that was the fall for Saul was that he
[36:12] got bigger in his own sight and when
[36:16] when we lose vision of really our
[36:22] littleness then it um it allow for what
[36:28] 1 Corinthians 4 says here verses
[36:33] 5-7 if we could turn there quickly it
[36:36] says this
[36:39] here therefore judge nothing before the
[36:41] time until the Lord comes who both will
[36:44] bring to light the hidden things of
[36:47] darkness and will make manifest the
[36:49] counsels of the heart and then shall
[36:52] every man have Praise of God and these
[36:55] things Brethren I have in a figure
[36:58] transferred to myself and to Apollos for
[37:01] your sakes that you might learn in us
[37:04] not to think of men above that which is
[37:08] written that no one of you be puffed up
[37:12] for one against another for who maketh
[37:17] thee to differ from another and what
[37:20] hast thou that thou this not
[37:23] receive now if thou did receive it why
[37:27] does thou Glory as if thou had not
[37:32] received it so your pretty stature or
[37:35] your beautiful voice or your ability to
[37:39] speak or preach or lead or follow
[37:43] whatever special touch the Lord wired
[37:46] you and gave you and you know it's a
[37:49] gift that comes from the lord it's
[37:51] attractive it's likable it's lovable
[37:53] it's a gift from God then why would I
[37:56] want to boast a that when I didn't give
[37:59] myself
[38:00] anything if I have anything worth of any
[38:03] praise or boasting it'll be from
[38:06] Christ and so God gives me a gift and
[38:08] gives you a gift and then we start
[38:10] fighting one another over that gift
[38:13] that's not the god that we serve that's
[38:15] not why he gave you the gift he gave you
[38:17] the gift so you can now use that to
[38:20] serve his people and then you can bless
[38:23] his people with his gift that he gave
[38:26] you and when we make it about ourselves
[38:29] then we get edgy we puff against one
[38:32] another we Flex against one we compare
[38:36] we be become carnal and we start drawing
[38:40] these lines and it's just not pleasing
[38:42] to the lord it's disrespectful to the
[38:44] one that called you and you're supposed
[38:46] to be serving we are
[38:48] ministers to the public ministers to the
[38:51] people wife is a minister to her to
[38:54] she's to minister the needs to her
[38:56] husband husband to to the wife and the
[38:58] children and so forth and so this little
[39:01] message in such a disrespectful age is
[39:04] well worthy to shout from the
[39:07] Housetop respect one another with the
[39:11] utmost respect be little in your own
[39:15] eyes and look at your brother or sister
[39:18] just lift them up much higher so that
[39:20] you're not puffed up against one another
[39:22] but the scriptures are
[39:24] clear in this uh likewise ye
[39:30] husbands dwell with them according to
[39:33] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[39:36] unto the weaker vessel one of the
[39:40] translations takes that word honor and
[39:42] says treat them with respect as the
[39:45] weaker partner or the weaker vessel that
[39:48] word means the same giving honor giving
[39:51] respect un as the weaker vessel now look
[39:54] what brother random says in Jehovah Gyra
[39:57] he's talking about Abraham and Sarah and
[40:00] he says this here paragraph 28 I can
[40:04] imagine it was on a Sunday afternoon
[40:06] when he spoke to him maybe on Monday
[40:10] morning how he's going to do poor little
[40:13] Isaac he looks at him oh he loves him
[40:17] but I can't look at that I got to think
[40:19] of obeying God so he's talking about the
[40:22] Lord told Abraham to take his slay his
[40:24] only son and this is he told told him
[40:27] that Sunday this is on the Monday that
[40:29] he's got to carry it out so he couldn't
[40:32] tell Sarah cuz you know the ladies are
[40:35] the weaker vessel so you sometimes you
[40:38] have to watch so I can't tell Sarah cuz
[40:42] she
[40:43] wouldn't
[40:44] understand
[40:47] now um Sarah let me finish the quote
[40:50] Sarah never was too strong anyhow in the
[40:52] faith cuz she lacked she disbelieved the
[40:55] promise but Abraham help her because the
[40:58] man and woman are one the woman could
[41:01] not be saved in the Old Testament only
[41:03] by the man because it was circumcision
[41:06] and she had to be joined to her husband
[41:09] in order to receive it but in the last
[41:11] days God poured out his Spirit and the
[41:15] women are circumcised in the heart just
[41:18] like the man and that was in
[41:20] 1956 he says it again very similar like
[41:25] this in the message I'll Skip One says
[41:29] questions and answers in
[41:32] 1960
[41:35] no identification
[41:37] 1964 the prophet of God says this
[41:41] here paragraph 152 and you know God said
[41:46] now to make the people in days to come
[41:49] the Seed of Abraham know your seed know
[41:52] that I keep my promise to any man that
[41:54] will hold unto my word I'm going to give
[41:56] him a test when the little boy got about
[42:00] 14 years old I imagine little shaggy
[42:03] hair pretty little eyes oh how that
[42:06] happy father and mother you know how you
[42:08] parent are with your child only child
[42:12] then God said to Abraham now he wouldn't
[42:15] tell it to Sarah because Sarah was the
[42:17] weaker vessel and so he said Abraham I
[42:20] want you to take this little boy that I
[42:23] give you the one that I'm going to make
[42:25] you a father of many nations by and I
[42:27] want you to take him up on the mountain
[42:29] that I'm going to show you tonight in a
[42:31] vision and there kill him so here
[42:35] brother banam uh is taking this one
[42:38] quote the last quote he says that God
[42:40] couldn't tell Sarah because she was a
[42:42] weaker vessel and there's just certain
[42:45] things we can't just dump on everybody
[42:49] their ears are not equipped to hear it
[42:52] um even young people you just can't
[42:54] unload those things on them
[42:57] you got to know with with Revelation
[43:00] with knowledge know what is valuable and
[43:05] what can be
[43:07] helpful um you know you can't tell the
[43:10] whole story and I know some of you
[43:11] sisters are going to look sideways but
[43:13] this is I'm reading the quotations the
[43:16] Bible said you are a weaker the weaker
[43:20] vessel God made you that way for a
[43:23] purpose and I expect some sisters to say
[43:25] Amen but if you don't say Amen
[43:27] it's yours you can keep it that's fine
[43:30] the word already has a big old Amen on
[43:32] it anyways and so that's the reality of
[43:35] it in this age and hour and look at the
[43:38] little babies giving me an amen thank
[43:40] you little will yes but you know this
[43:44] that that's a reality and it's not just
[43:48] weaker like I can lift more muscle I got
[43:50] bigger muscles than you there's the the
[43:53] the from the Garden of Eden all the way
[43:56] through and all the way down there's a
[43:59] reason why she's not to handle the word
[44:01] and preach the gospel the scriptures
[44:04] brings us that order now brother
[44:07] brandham goes further in this on the
[44:10] weaker vessel and I just want to bring
[44:11] that to you as he brought it to us Amen
[44:16] in the message the six-fold purpose of
[44:19] Gabriel's visit to Daniel he says this
[44:21] here but I got a tremendous quotes for
[44:23] you sisters that's coming up here too so
[44:26] if you going to be quiet now just stay
[44:28] quiet cuz I was going to lean right with
[44:31] you
[44:33] but ain't no favorite part we say Amen
[44:36] to we say Amen to all of it right praise
[44:39] the Lord
[44:41] somebody all right paragraph
[44:44] 129 the prophet of God no paragraph
[44:47] 67 he says this here 1961 he says you
[44:52] women I've hollered at you now I'm going
[44:54] to take up for you a minute the woman is
[44:57] the weaker vessel I know there can't be
[45:00] a bad man before there's a bad woman but
[45:03] men who knows that men who knows that
[45:06] you are a son of God and take advantage
[45:10] of a woman shame on you no matter what
[45:14] she
[45:16] does she's a weaker vessel and you know
[45:22] that if she goes out acting unladylike
[45:27] take her by the hand talk to her like a
[45:29] sister you're a Son of God don't don't
[45:33] do them evil things look at Joseph he
[45:36] was an example to you
[45:40] amen questions and answers 1961 the
[45:43] prophet of God says this now what did I
[45:45] tell you a while ago when I first
[45:47] started when you see a car coming down
[45:50] the road 90 miles an hour get out of its
[45:52] way that's right when you see the first
[45:55] twist in anything like that get away
[45:58] from it stay away from it that's the
[46:01] ground you should not be on Satan will
[46:03] present something to you that'll wreck
[46:06] your soul and send you to Hell stay away
[46:09] from it shun the very appearance of evil
[46:13] that's right be a man be a woman I'm
[46:17] going to take up for the women a minute
[46:19] that's unusual isn't it they say oh the
[46:22] woman caused it oh it was the woman's
[46:25] fault she hadn't got out of her place
[46:28] well the man wouldn't have got out of
[46:29] his that's true well we'll say that's
[46:33] right she got out of her place a man
[46:36] can't be bad L there's a bad woman but
[46:40] remember there can't be a bad woman
[46:42] without being a bad man that's right and
[46:46] you who claim to be a Son of God where
[46:49] is your principles if the woman ain't
[46:52] out of her place aren't you a Son of God
[46:56] aren't you the one that's a higher
[46:58] stronger vessel as the Bible says she's
[47:01] weaker then if she's weaker then show
[47:04] yourself a man of
[47:06] God tell her say sister you're in the
[47:09] wrong that's right I've done it other
[47:12] Christians have done it you'll always do
[47:14] it as long as you're a Christian but
[47:16] show yourself you're a Son of God you
[47:20] have more power over yourself than the
[47:23] woman does if she is weaker recognize
[47:27] her to be
[47:28] weaker understand her mistakes and
[47:30] things like that or try or try to
[47:33] correct her say sister we are Christians
[47:36] we shouldn't do that see be a real man
[47:39] be a Son of God and watch the woman
[47:50] amen choosing of the Bride the prophet
[47:52] of God is a very strong message very
[47:56] similar to
[47:57] um marriage and divorce he's bringing
[48:00] out the choice that a man in choosing a
[48:03] bride and types it with Christ choosing
[48:06] a church choosing uh an elect lady and
[48:10] as we shared on Sunday that you know
[48:13] we're all married to Christ and we're
[48:15] married to Christ the word and that is
[48:18] our husband that's our headship and so
[48:20] brother random brings those types the
[48:22] scripture brings those types and when I
[48:25] really respect the word proper ly then I
[48:27] will respect everybody else
[48:30] properly if I can't respect the word
[48:34] properly that's probably why I'm not
[48:36] respecting you the way I should because
[48:39] my approach to the word isn't correct I
[48:41] can say I can quote the quotes I can
[48:43] quote the scriptures but if I'm not
[48:45] treating you according to the what the
[48:47] scripture tells us then I really don't
[48:49] believe it Jesus said um if you love me
[48:54] you will do what you will keep my
[48:57] Commandments and I gave the the brother
[48:59] bam gives a beautiful example in the
[49:02] message respects when AA Allen spoke
[49:05] against him publicly over something that
[49:08] he heard the proper thing was he should
[49:11] have came to brother Brom and talk to
[49:13] him now that's what the Bible says
[49:16] that's what the scripture says that's
[49:18] you know your feelings will make you do
[49:20] one thing but really Christ the word is
[49:24] our leadership is our headship amen and
[49:27] above what everybody else thinks how
[49:29] they feel how they treat you who started
[49:32] it first who's being acting the way
[49:35] they're acting you have a responsibility
[49:38] to the word brothers and sisters that is
[49:43] our example even whoever did whatever
[49:47] wrong to you you still have an example
[49:51] you have a
[49:52] responsibility to hold to what the word
[49:55] says bring that on the table and then
[49:58] you say well this is what the word says
[50:00] Lord help me I don't feel like this I
[50:02] don't feel I feel like this is you know
[50:05] I'm being done wrong I'm being done
[50:06] unjust I really want to L lash out
[50:09] against them I want to go do something
[50:11] but if the word doesn't give you that
[50:13] permission to do that you want to humble
[50:15] yourself to the word you submit yourself
[50:20] every believer has to do it it's not
[50:23] just the wives have to submit to their
[50:24] husband oh this unfair that's not right
[50:27] it's unfair a man has to submit to the
[50:31] word of God and you tell me that's an
[50:33] easy task a single man that's not easy I
[50:38] mean to bring this carnal uh I mean I
[50:42] applaud the saints that come to church
[50:43] that's here on a Wednesday night I mean
[50:46] all of the attractions of the world out
[50:48] there you've worked and you've done you
[50:50] could be out kicking back cable has so
[50:53] many television shows plus Netflix plus
[50:56] all the other shows you could be at home
[50:59] relaxing and doing what most most people
[51:01] are doing I applaud a man or a woman
[51:05] single Man Group family that will get
[51:07] themselves together and come to the
[51:09] house of the Lord it might look easy I'm
[51:12] looking at you it looks easy but I know
[51:14] it ain't easy and some days I want to
[51:17] check out like some of y'all
[51:20] do but I can't praise the Lord and when
[51:24] we all get when we all get handcuffed to
[51:27] the work like I'm handcuffed to it
[51:32] there'll be no days off praise the Lord
[51:36] God bless you yes yes it's it's not easy
[51:40] for anybody it's like oh I'm so glad
[51:43] that I could have the rule over my no
[51:45] you are responsible now you're
[51:48] responsible so now the word of God the
[51:53] prophet of God takes choosing of the
[51:54] bride and he says this here paragraph 14
[51:56] 4 and the woman was the one that changed
[51:59] over for the perversion that's right see
[52:01] where the beauty takes her to now that's
[52:04] why that today we find that women is on
[52:07] the increase of beauty you take Pearl
[52:09] Brian did you ever see her picture
[52:11] supposed to be America's great Beauty
[52:14] there isn't a school kid out of any
[52:16] school but what would have her in the
[52:19] back row did you know it's supposed to
[52:23] be that way did you know the Bible
[52:27] speaks that that's the way it's going to
[52:31] be there is no other message like our
[52:34] message Saints do you know the fall came
[52:37] by women at the beginning and the end is
[52:40] going to wind up the same way women
[52:44] coming into Authority and ruling over
[52:47] men and so forth you know the scripture
[52:50] says that you know the day that she puts
[52:54] on man's clothes and Bobs her hair and
[52:56] all those things are contrary to God's
[52:58] word you know she represents the church
[53:03] wow when you watch what women are doing
[53:05] you'll see what the church is doing
[53:08] that's exactly right now now that's just
[53:12] as true as the word of God is true no
[53:15] other female is made that can stoop like
[53:16] a woman can and yet through that being
[53:19] made she was not in the original
[53:22] creation all other females is in the
[53:24] original creation Birds male and female
[53:26] animals male and female but in human
[53:29] life God only made a man and he took
[53:31] from him and a woman is a byproduct of a
[53:35] man because God did not Institute such a
[53:38] thing search the scriptures exactly
[53:41] right God knows sir in his original
[53:45] creation she was put out there
[53:48] but if she can hold herself
[53:52] right what a greater reward she has than
[53:57] man that's right she's put on a testing
[54:01] ground through her come death she's
[54:04] guilty of all death but then God turned
[54:06] around and used one to bring life back
[54:10] again brought his son through the woman
[54:13] an obedient one but a bad one is the
[54:16] worst there is nothing can be so low so
[54:20] and of course brother bradam is
[54:23] bringing the natural and the spiritual
[54:25] type remember in the message thinking
[54:27] man's filter has brother bam talked
[54:30] about the subtle instrument that Satan
[54:33] used called the church to use to deceive
[54:38] The Souls of many and create all kind of
[54:42] taste and desires whatever flavor you
[54:45] want we'll give that to you whatever
[54:47] flavor you want but a thinking man he
[54:50] can only preach the word a true church
[54:53] can only preach the word and that's what
[54:55] a thinking man wants doesn't want an
[54:58] Easy Street sermon doesn't want a sermon
[55:00] that doesn't touch me nobody called me
[55:03] out no no not a True Believer a True
[55:06] Believer wants to be right with God amen
[55:09] amen if God's word says it then that's
[55:12] what I want to size my life up to I want
[55:15] to pattern my life behind that behind
[55:18] all cost remember Saints we're going
[55:20] somewhere we got to leave from here and
[55:24] why would we play games with the few
[55:26] meager decades that we have here on on
[55:30] the earth we'll be leaving here soon
[55:33] amen and um what's more
[55:37] important than standing before him on
[55:40] that day you want to be prepared for
[55:44] that don't
[55:45] you so here what the prophet of God says
[55:48] here um speaking of
[55:52] this this weaker vessel or this
[55:57] this the woman and her role and position
[56:01] as it pertains to the man in the message
[56:05] life
[56:08] story um I forget the paragraph number I
[56:10] think I gave it to you the prophet of
[56:12] God says this here but now a good woman
[56:15] is a jewel in a man's
[56:18] Crown she should be honored my mother's
[56:22] a woman my wife is and they're lovely
[56:26] and I've got thousands of Christian
[56:28] sisters who I highly
[56:31] respect but if they can respect what
[56:34] what God made them a motherhood and a
[56:38] real queen that's all right she's one of
[56:41] the best things that God could give a
[56:46] man was a
[56:48] wife besides salvation a wife is the
[56:53] best thing if she is a Good Wife but if
[56:58] she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a
[57:00] jewel in a man's Crown but an orary one
[57:03] is no good one or or no good one is
[57:07] water in his blood and that's right it's
[57:10] the worst thing could happen so a good
[57:13] woman if you got a good wife brother you
[57:16] ought to respect her with the
[57:20] highest that's right you should do that
[57:23] a real woman and children if if you got
[57:26] a real mother that stays home and tries
[57:28] to take care of you keeping your clothes
[57:30] clean send you to school teaching you
[57:32] about Jesus you should honor that sweet
[57:36] old mother with all that's in you you
[57:40] should respect that woman because she's
[57:43] a real
[57:45] mother and the message the token the
[57:47] prophet of God says
[57:50] this you should love one another
[57:52] Believers should separate themselves
[57:54] from the world don't just take it now
[57:56] lightly then you people that's listening
[57:59] to this on tape you women you men you
[58:01] listen a minute if you ever believe me
[58:04] you believe it now it's time you quit
[58:07] fussing with one another believe the
[58:09] message of the Bible believe Jesus
[58:12] Christ and love and honor and respect
[58:15] one
[58:16] another men respect your wives you
[58:19] respect your home bring your home
[58:22] together because remember this lamb was
[58:24] for the home not just
[58:26] one the whole home too had to be brought
[58:30] everything had to be brought in we
[58:32] should love each others and Believers
[58:35] should separate themselves from the
[58:40] world now how many love that and how
[58:43] many believe that is
[58:45] true
[58:47] amen
[58:48] perfectly the way I would treat the
[58:53] things that happened to me look at
[58:55] myself
[58:57] as you know not above what God called me
[59:01] look at myself as just a nobody I don't
[59:05] deserve anything I don't I don't deserve
[59:09] everyone's respect right it'd be great
[59:13] if we get it but really I respect the
[59:16] word above that and so the Bible says
[59:20] look let no man suffer as an evildoer
[59:26] or worker of iniquity it says
[59:31] here in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 5 I
[59:34] want to take this scripture for you here
[59:36] and I'll share what the prophet of God
[59:38] says about this all right Ephesians
[59:42] chapter 6 servants be obedient to
[59:45] them that are your Masters according to
[59:47] the flesh with fear and tribling and
[59:50] singleness of your heart as to who
[59:57] as unto not your boss not the master not
[1:00:01] the guy who's in charge not the fleshly
[1:00:04] but as unto
[1:00:06] Christ not with I Service as men
[1:00:10] Pleasers but as the Servants of Christ
[1:00:13] doing the will of God from the heart
[1:00:16] with Good Will doing service with Good
[1:00:18] Will doing Service as to the Lord and
[1:00:22] not to
[1:00:23] man knowing that whatsoever good thing
[1:00:26] any man doeth the same shall he receive
[1:00:30] of the Lord whether he be Bond or free
[1:00:33] and you Masters do the same things unto
[1:00:35] them forbearing threatening knowing that
[1:00:38] your master also is in heaven neither is
[1:00:42] their respective persons with
[1:00:46] him
[1:00:53] amen there one more scripture let me
[1:00:56] take that for
[1:01:04] you it's in the New Testament there find
[1:01:08] it
[1:01:14] here respect a great subject wouldn't
[1:01:17] you
[1:01:18] say oh we can all learn to respect the
[1:01:21] word even
[1:01:23] more and respect him more so so
[1:01:26] Ephesians chapter 5 so let's let me read
[1:01:38] that so brother brandham deals with it
[1:01:44] here in
[1:01:48] questions no not questions and
[1:01:52] answers
[1:01:54] yeah Revelations CH 4 part 3 paragraph
[1:01:59] 160 now turn with me right quick with
[1:02:02] ephes to Ephesians 5 just hold your
[1:02:05] place go back a few pages back to
[1:02:07] Ephesians the 5th chapter the 26th verse
[1:02:10] that he might sanctify and cleanseth the
[1:02:12] church he's speaking of see now let me
[1:02:15] go back a little further go back to the
[1:02:17] 21st verse you're looking submit

[1:02:24] God submit yourself

[1:02:57] husband is that on the screen it's like
[1:02:59] I'm in this room by
[1:03:00] myself wives submit yourselves to your
[1:03:03] own husbands as unto the
[1:03:06] Lord y'all help me read that I can't say
[1:03:10] that I notices all the brothers said
[1:03:13] that they made sure they got that one
[1:03:14] out there because he is your
[1:03:21] lord can we play that one out really
[1:03:23] loud no no don't it say in there there
[1:03:26] it
[1:03:27] is now she can hold her position
[1:03:32] right okay she has a greater reward than
[1:03:35] the
[1:03:36] man and if the man has a wife that's out
[1:03:39] of line what did he say do he said no
[1:03:41] matter what she does you know she's the
[1:03:43] weaker vessel you bring the correction
[1:03:47] this is what this is our responsibility
[1:03:49] to the word We Don't Fight Fire with
[1:03:51] Fire don't get even with people you
[1:03:55] upset so I'm going to get upset back at
[1:03:56] you that's not how that's not the word
[1:03:58] that's not the headship that we're
[1:04:01] following it's so much bigger than your
[1:04:04] wife or your husband it's our Lord as
[1:04:08] unto the Lord and when my praise and my
[1:04:12] sermons and my giving and everything is
[1:04:15] as unto the Lord then I will do it
[1:04:17] properly sir you don't have to Pat me on
[1:04:20] the back or appreciate it or be looking
[1:04:23] for you know acknowledgement I gave that
[1:04:25] to the Lord Lord he saw it and thank you
[1:04:29] Lord for giving me the opportunity to
[1:04:31] even give you praise you know we're
[1:04:33] supposed to be praising the Lord and
[1:04:35] then we get upset when the people don't
[1:04:37] praise
[1:04:38] us something is Twisted there it's
[1:04:42] off it's not right it's incorrect
[1:04:45] serving looking I Service as men pleas
[1:04:48] I'm going to please this brother this
[1:04:49] one oh he's not that important so I
[1:04:51] won't please him he's not you know he
[1:04:53] don't have no power but brother oh yeah
[1:04:55] I'll serve brother over here cuz he's
[1:04:57] got the power to you know change my you
[1:05:01] know so Lord help
[1:05:03] us so he is your lord how many knows
[1:05:09] that you women that's exactly right
[1:05:12] thank you sis the Bible said so at the
[1:05:15] beginning it's still the same way wives
[1:05:18] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:05:21] as unto the Lord for the husband is the
[1:05:24] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[1:05:26] head of the church and he is the savior
[1:05:29] of the body so is the husband you all
[1:05:32] know that you married people an adult or
[1:05:35] children that's old enough to know the
[1:05:38] way of life all right as unto the Lord
[1:05:43] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:05:45] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:05:48] and is the savior of the body therefore
[1:05:51] as the church is subject unto Christ so
[1:05:54] let the wives be to do their own
[1:05:57] husbands in
[1:05:58] everything husbands love your wives even
[1:06:01] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:06:04] himself for it don't run over her if you
[1:06:08] do that you're not fit to be a husband
[1:06:12] that's right that he might listen here
[1:06:16] here it is get it now that he might
[1:06:19] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:06:22] of the Water by the
[1:06:26] word then every worshipper that ever
[1:06:30] gains access into this has to come by
[1:06:34] the word there's too many comes
[1:06:38] otherwise I believe in little stories
[1:06:40] and things about mother died long years
[1:06:42] ago she's waiting for you in heaven that
[1:06:45] does all right after the the word has
[1:06:47] been applied many people come to the
[1:06:49] altar cuz they want to meet their mother
[1:06:52] in heaven that's all right you should do
[1:06:54] that but that's not the reason you come
[1:06:56] to the altar you come to the altar
[1:06:59] confessing your sins because Christ died
[1:07:03] in your
[1:07:04] stead by the word so the word is our
[1:07:08] headship it's our
[1:07:10] leadership I if I'm if I'm in the word
[1:07:13] properly you will love
[1:07:16] me yeah because that's the best version
[1:07:18] you gonna get from me that's the best
[1:07:20] version you're going to get from me is
[1:07:22] if brother Israel can come under the
[1:07:24] headship of the word and that's the same
[1:07:26] for the young people for wives or
[1:07:27] whoever so you pray for me I pray for
[1:07:30] you that we'll all find the headship of
[1:07:32] the word and the word makes us what he
[1:07:36] wants us to be amen God bless you God
