[24:04] God bless you I'd rather ask for
[24:05] forgiveness then permission so I'm going
[24:07] to give a testimony even though it takes
[24:08] a little bit of time
[24:11] um I gave I gave a testimony at my high
[24:13] school graduation which was a year ago
[24:16] um this end of May about um Lord healing
[24:20] me from diabetes and chronic headaches
[24:22] and um about a couple months after that
[24:24] it kind of all came back and I got it
[24:26] again and then I
[24:29] like six months ago I'd say um was
[24:31] battling a really severe depression if
[24:33] you ever dealed with depression it's
[24:34] just something you never really break
[24:35] out of you're just kind of always like
[24:37] you have your good days you have your
[24:39] bad days but it's kind of always a
[24:41] tainted day it's never a great day um
[24:44] and it was really hard to go through and
[24:47] um you know you're claiming your healing
[24:49] but it's your faith is down and
[24:53] um it was probably the hardest battle
[24:56] I'd been through and then is in the
[24:57] middle of relationship and then I got
[24:59] engaged and I was just praying this
[25:01] morning I was like Lord I don't want to
[25:03] take this into my marriage I I can't let
[25:06] this be bothering me and this is what I
[25:08] start my marriage out on that's just not
[25:10] healthy I can't I can't do that that's
[25:12] going to really set it off on the wrong
[25:15] foot um and me and Trevor had a real big
[25:19] heart to heart last night and I was like
[25:21] I have to get this under control and so
[25:24] brother Joel's sermon hit it right on
[25:26] the head this morning and I went through
[25:29] that prayer line I had a horrible
[25:31] headache this morning I couldn't get to
[25:32] go away I took exed I drank water and as
[25:35] soon as I went through that prayer line
[25:36] he called the sisters up to pray with me
[25:39] and he said they prayed with me and it
[25:42] just left and I felt the depression
[25:44] leave the anxiety it just melted away I
[25:48] have never felt this
[25:51] light and this song has been on my heart
[25:54] for a year I wanted to sing it after my
[25:56] graduation and I just never listen to
[25:58] the Lord so we're going to sing it
[26:01] tonight because he's been telling me for
[26:03] 12 months to sing
[26:07] it I've had many tears and
[26:11] Sorrows I've had questions for
[26:15] tomorrow there have been times I didn't
[26:18] know right from
[26:23] wrong but in every
[26:26] situation God bless a
[26:30] consolation that my trials only come to
[26:35] make me
[26:39] strong and I've been lots of
[26:43] places seen so many
[26:47] faces there have been times I felt so
[26:54] alone oh but in my Lonely Hour

[27:02] hours Jesus let me know I was his
[27:10] own for through it

[28:01] would I know that he could solve them

[39:01] perish but have eternal life for God so
[39:04] loved the world that he gave his only
[39:07] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[39:10] him should not perish but have
[39:13] everlasting life for God sent not his
[39:16] son into the world to condemn the world
[39:20] but that the world through him might be
[39:24] saved amen we thank God for the reading

[41:08] seated brother brandom amen during the
[41:11] time of the Revolutionary in the
[41:13] states it was said that a
[41:17] soldier was tried and court
[41:20] marshaled for a certain crime and was to
[41:24] be shot at a certain date at
[41:28] Sunrise day before some of them went to
[41:31] the notable president and beg for his
[41:37] life and the president being in a hurry
[41:41] picked up a small piece of paper and
[41:44] wrote on it I pardon this man and signed
[41:49] his name Abraham
[41:51] Lincoln and the carrier brought the
[41:54] piece of paper to the cell and said to
[41:57] to the man you are
[42:00] free and as the man looked he said it's
[42:05] doesn't seem official to
[42:07] me I just don't believe it and I'll not
[42:10] leave here he rejected
[42:14] it because it was on a small piece of
[42:17] paper and not a great letterhead or
[42:21] something from the
[42:22] president the next morning the man died
[42:26] as sentenced
[42:28] by firing
[42:30] squad then the paper was written with
[42:33] the president's name the man is pardoned
[42:36] and they shot him after the president
[42:39] had pardoned
[42:41] him and it was tried in federal court
[42:45] and there was a
[42:48] decision that a pardon is not a pardon
[42:53] except it be received as a pardon
[42:58] so John
[43:00] 3:16 is a pardon to every Mortal man and
[43:04] woman on
[43:05] earth if it's received as a
[43:09] pardon but if it's not your still
[43:15] condemned for God so loved the world
[43:20] that he gave his only begotten
[43:24] son that whosoever believeth in him
[43:27] should not
[43:29] perish but would have everlasting
[43:34] life what a pardon to Adam's Fallen race
[43:39] that any man or woman that wants to
[43:42] receive it it's a free pardon for you
[43:46] and for
[43:48] me that love that God
[43:52] had love is a powerful force
[43:58] and when love is
[44:00] projected and it comes to the end of its
[44:05] strength Sovereign Grace will take it up
[44:09] from there and project the object that
[44:12] love has as
[44:14] far that's the reason we have a savior
[44:17] tonight is because God so love the
[44:22] world that is love being projected to
[44:26] the world produced a
[44:31] savior God wanted to see you well so
[44:36] much his love went out and produced an
[44:40] atonement for your sickness as your
[44:45] sins it was the love of God that
[44:47] constrained him to do
[44:49] it love is a powerful
[44:53] force it'll run a woman a mother right
[44:57] into the fls of fire after her baby if
[45:01] she knows she's plunging herself to
[45:04] death there's nothing more strong than
[45:09] love love will make you
[45:13] trust you might go and know that you
[45:16] belong to the greatest Church in all the
[45:19] provinces of
[45:22] Canada you might know that you're the
[45:24] charter member of the greatest Church in
[45:28] the
[45:30] nation and then you would do things that
[45:34] you would not do if you belong to a
[45:36] little Mission somewhere in some corner
[45:39] and had the love of God in your
[45:43] heart
[45:45] love has no
[45:48] fear Love cast us out
[45:51] fear and I noticed in my
[45:55] meetings so much that when I come into
[45:57] the
[45:58] people one of the great things I find
[46:01] among them is
[46:03] fear and what makes fear is lack of
[46:09] confidence if you lack confidence it'll
[46:12] make you
[46:13] fear but if you love it Cast Away that
[46:20] fear and that's the way God wants his
[46:23] church not so many as charter members he
[46:26] want members that's loyal and loves and
[46:30] believes and have confidence in
[46:34] him for instance my wife is somewhere in
[46:38] the meeting tonight in the
[46:41] audience I love her with all my
[46:45] heart and when I get ready to go
[46:48] overseas now what if my wife I caught
[46:52] her by the arm and said listen here Mrs
[46:55] Brandon
[46:57] while I'm gone overseas Thou shalt not
[47:00] have any more
[47:01] husbands and if I ever hear of you
[47:05] flirting with any other man while I'm
[47:08] gone woe unto you when I get
[47:12] back and then she catch me with the coke
[47:15] collar and said that's very well Mr
[47:18] Brandon but I want you to have a little
[47:21] law
[47:22] too if I hear of you going out with
[47:25] another woman War under to you when you
[47:27] come
[47:29] back now wouldn't that be a home well
[47:33] that's just about the way we made God's
[47:35] place of
[47:36] dwelling some kind of legalistic laws
[47:40] that we have to
[47:43] keep what do I do when I go
[47:45] overseas I love my wife and as long as I
[47:50] love her I got confidence in
[47:53] her we just get down in the floor and
[47:56] pray together bring our little children
[47:58] around us they pray God take care of
[48:01] daddy bring him back I pray God take
[48:03] care of the family while I'm gone I rais
[48:06] up kiss her goodbye kiss the babies she
[48:09] said Billy I'll be praying for you while
[48:11] you're gone that settles
[48:15] it we think no more about
[48:17] it and if I was
[48:20] overseas under the law that I know I'd
[48:24] be divorced when to get back if I went
[48:26] out with someone else I'd be a miserable
[48:31] man but if I was over there no matter
[48:34] what kind of a condition I was in and I
[48:37] knew that I could cheat on her and come
[48:41] back and tell her and she would forgive
[48:43] me for it I still wouldn't do
[48:47] it I wouldn't hurt her for
[48:51] nothing no sir if I know you said bill I
[48:54] understand I forgive you I couldn't look
[48:57] her in the face I think too much of her
[49:01] I tell you brother when the love of God
[49:05] comes into the human
[49:07] heart it'll D all these things you don't
[49:10] have to worry about smoking drinking and
[49:12] run into BIOS
[49:14] Scopes when the love of Christ comes
[49:17] into your heart you wouldn't do nothing
[49:19] to hurt
[49:21] him not walking around saying they're
[49:23] narrow minded and they're this way and
[49:25] that way just let the love of God strike
[49:27] you once those things die your whole
[49:31] affections is placed on Christ you got
[49:35] eternal life then when you believe him
[49:39] when you really believing and get
[49:42] married to him and die out to the things
[49:45] of the
[49:46] world God projects his love and his love
[49:51] makes you what you
[49:53] are oh there's many things we could say
[49:56] about
[49:58] I'm just going to let my collar down as
[50:00] it was for a few minutes and tell you my
[50:04] Canadian friends some of the inside if
[50:06] you'll excuse that as a personal
[50:08] testimony I want to let you know
[50:10] something on the inside of my
[50:13] life that I found cause it seems very
[50:16] fitted right at this
[50:20] time many people wonders what takes
[50:24] place think it's some sort of a Mystic
[50:28] it isn't it's love that's the main
[50:33] thing is loving Christ not just saying
[50:38] you do but from your heart love
[50:42] him I've seen the cruelest of devils
[50:45] conquered I've seen wild animals flower
[50:49] themselves in the presence of God's
[50:52] love love castes the fear away
[50:58] here's in this little book is written a
[51:01] testimony at Portland Oregon one
[51:05] night I was preaching on
[51:08] faith and all of a sudden up through the
[51:11] building came a great big man about
[51:15] 250 I thought he must have been a
[51:18] messenger until I noticed the whole
[51:20] group of preachers maybe 150 more just
[51:23] scatter from the platform
[51:26] and when he run up he looked at me in
[51:29] the face Drew back his big arms little
[51:33] and I know he was an insane man out of
[51:36] an
[51:37] institution and he just HD a preacher
[51:39] out on the street and broke his jaw and
[51:42] his collar bone knocked him way out in
[51:44] the
[51:45] street and there's about 6,000 people
[51:48] present what could get in the building
[51:50] pouring the rain on the
[51:52] outside and this fella run to the
[51:55] platform and he looked at me and he said
[51:58] you
[51:59] hypocrite he said up here posing
[52:01] yourself as a servant of God I'll break
[52:05] every bone in your
[52:08] body I weighed 128 pounds he weighed
[52:13] right on 250 or better nearly 7 foot
[52:16] tall well able and strength the pack his
[52:19] threat
[52:20] out I knew better than to say
[52:24] anything for he was Well Physical
[52:28] able but when I turned to look at the
[52:32] man something
[52:34] happened oh if it would always
[52:38] happen instead of flying
[52:42] loose and wanting to fight the man or to
[52:45] call the police on him I loved
[52:49] him I thought that poor man doesn't want
[52:53] to hurt
[52:54] me that's a devil call ING that man he
[52:58] wants to hurt me that man is a man
[53:01] probably with a family who loves likes
[53:05] to eat soate and be a
[53:09] citizen but the Devil in him is doing
[53:13] that I thought that poor
[53:16] brother and he walked up close to
[53:19] me and he said I'll show you whether
[53:22] you're a man of God or not I never open
[53:25] my mouth I just looked at
[53:27] everything was quiet I had just LED two
[53:30] little policemen to Christ back in the
[53:33] dressing room they ran out to the
[53:35] platform to grab the man I shook my head
[53:37] at him it's not a flesh and blood Affair
[53:40] and the man walked right up to my
[53:44] face spit right my face he said you
[53:48] snake in the
[53:50] grass I'll break every bone in your body
[53:54] for I'm going to knock you way out in
[53:56] the middle of that audience great big
[54:00] arms I never said a word but I was no
[54:03] more afraid that I am right
[54:06] now that's it it's
[54:11] love I never went there by my own will
[54:15] God sent me there it's up to God to take
[54:18] care of me while I'm
[54:20] there I looked at him I thought poor
[54:23] fell and he raised back his big fist and
[54:27] started to strike me 6,000 people just
[54:30] sitting
[54:32] breathless as he started to strike I
[54:34] said Satan come out of that man first I
[54:39] missed some of it when he told me that
[54:41] he was going to knock me out in the
[54:43] floor I heard my own voice telling
[54:46] tonight you'll fall over my feet he said
[54:49] I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over
[54:52] and he drew back to strike me and I said
[54:55] Satan leave the man and the man threw
[54:57] his arms in the air his great eyes
[55:01] bulged out his mouth went open he turned
[55:04] around and fell on the floor and pinned
[55:07] my feet to the floor to the policeman
[55:09] had to roll him
[55:11] over don't be Frid God still
[55:16] lives I've seen him in the challenge of
[55:19] witch doctors in
[55:21] Africa with all the Hinduism in India
[55:26] don't don't you think the devil won't
[55:27] make you prove every inch of ground you
[55:32] claim but if you love him there's no
[55:36] fear
[55:39] left sometime ago a few weeks ago down
[55:43] in O
[55:45] Mexico we were supposed to get the
[55:49] bulling but they wouldn't let us have it
[55:52] and we had to take a great big field
[55:57] where they run a ballpark or something
[56:00] thousands of people swarmed in we
[56:03] couldn't get to the building or to the
[56:05] place they had to let me up a ladder and
[56:07] then down into the bull
[56:10] ring and then while preaching
[56:14] there that night the night before a lady
[56:19] had come there at 3:00 in the afternoon
[56:21] and people gathered at 9:00 at morning
[56:24] no cheers to set in
[56:26] they leaned against each
[56:30] other and they were waiting till 9 that
[56:35] night what will they do in the day of
[56:40] judgment against the self style groups
[56:44] that wouldn't even darken the door of
[56:46] such a
[56:48] place
[56:50] then that night Mr Moore standing in it
[56:54] pouring down rain
[56:56] and Mr Moore kept telling me there's
[56:59] something going on at the pray
[57:02] line and a Mexican Minister from
[57:05] California brother espinos many of you
[57:08] may know
[57:09] him he was giving out the prayer cards
[57:12] and trying to keep the people ly and he
[57:14] couldn't do
[57:16] it and Billy come to me my boy and said
[57:19] Daddy he can't hold that line any longer
[57:21] there's a little woman down there with a
[57:23] dead baby that died this morning
[57:26] and she's climbing over the top of the
[57:30] man I said well brother Moore you go
[57:32] down there and pray for the
[57:35] baby and Brother Moore started down and
[57:39] I looked out here in front of me and a
[57:41] vision come of the little baby raising
[57:45] up now we can't say these things unless
[57:48] they're
[57:50] authentic and the little baby I noticed
[57:54] a little mother down there screaming
[57:56] padra the word padra means father she
[57:59] was
[58:00] Catholic and when I said bring the
[58:02] little lady
[58:04] here and she had a blanket over it it's
[58:07] soaking wet I couldn't speak to her no
[58:10] one there to interpret I just laid my
[58:13] hands over on the little baby and
[58:15] offered to God a little
[58:17] prayer this Bible laying open here now
[58:21] God knows the truth the little fell let
[58:24] out a squeal and begin to kick his heart
[58:25] as he could that just alarmed the whole
[58:30] Mexico the next day or night when I got
[58:33] in there the platform was about as wide
[58:36] again as this entire building across
[58:37] here the floor space and it was pile
[58:40] full of old coats and hats they might
[58:44] pray over them hats and things for the
[58:46] people coming on the platform that night
[58:49] about the fourth or fifth person I
[58:51] noticed an old wrinkled faed
[58:54] man and as he come up he was blind and
[58:59] he kept saying something The Interpreter
[59:02] was speaking it was he
[59:04] approaching the man that was going to
[59:06] pray for him he kept telling yes he
[59:09] fumbled in his old ragged coat pocket
[59:12] brought out a little pair of beads and
[59:14] begin to say something over these beads
[59:17] I told him I said put it away brother
[59:20] you don't have need of that now and he
[59:23] stuck it in his pocket and I looked at
[59:25] him
[59:27] I begin to think now to you
[59:30] pastors here's something for
[59:35] you you know your congregation knows
[59:37] where you love them or
[59:39] not you can't put on love it's got to be
[59:43] real it's just like people trying to a
[59:46] freezing man you'd show him a painted
[59:48] fire he can't warm by a painted fire
[59:51] it's got to have some heat in it and
[59:55] love has got to have has an action to
[59:59] it and the old man as he stood there I
[1:00:03] begin to feel sorry for him I looked at
[1:00:05] his old ragged coat I put my shoulders
[1:00:09] upside of his to see if my coat would
[1:00:10] fit him I look at his feet no shoes on
[1:00:15] great calluses on his feet Dusty all the
[1:00:17] way up as far as you can see where his
[1:00:20] ragged trouser leg my shoe wasn't
[1:00:22] nothing like big enough for him and I
[1:00:25] begin to look and I thought that poor
[1:00:27] old man maybe never had a good meal in
[1:00:29] all his life oh the economics of Mexico
[1:00:34] is very
[1:00:35] poor The Brick Mason gets about eight
[1:00:38] pesos a day and it takes about four days
[1:00:42] good hard labor to buy himself a pair of
[1:00:44] shoes that's Poncho Frank what does
[1:00:47] Pedro do working for about two peses
[1:00:50] with six or eight children to raise oh
[1:00:52] it's terrible and I thought after all
[1:00:56] that and then nature the devil has given
[1:01:02] him evil to Blind his poor old blinded
[1:01:06] eyes how cruel it was to him I begin to
[1:01:11] enter into
[1:01:13] something I can't express it it was the
[1:01:18] love of
[1:01:21] sympathy as the old fellow common ladies
[1:01:24] head over on my should told I hugged
[1:01:26] that old ragged
[1:01:29] coat I said merciful God please help
[1:01:34] this poor old blind daddy and my dad
[1:01:38] would have lived it' have been about
[1:01:40] that age will you help him and I heard
[1:01:43] him H glory
[1:01:45] atos and the man could see as good as I
[1:01:49] could the people begin screaming
[1:01:52] everywhere what was it it was entering
[1:01:55] into that Fellowship of his suffering in
[1:01:58] his life is you must do
[1:02:01] it if ever I had a time of success of
[1:02:05] praying for anyone is when I could enter
[1:02:08] into the fellowship with them feel their
[1:02:13] infirmities feel their conditions then
[1:02:17] something in you goes down beyond the
[1:02:19] reason and praise of prayer of faith for
[1:02:22] the sck you've got to feel for man
[1:02:27] you've got to sympathize with him you've
[1:02:29] got to be with him before you can help
[1:02:34] him then you enter into some sort of a
[1:02:37] deepness it's a love of God it's beyond
[1:02:41] human
[1:02:43] love I'm going to tell you something you
[1:02:45] may class me a fanatic after
[1:02:48] this but I'll feel like I want to tell
[1:02:51] you
[1:02:53] anyhow many things happen like that
[1:02:57] frankly all my Ministry has been wrapped
[1:03:01] around that one
[1:03:02] thing if I can love that or fall in
[1:03:06] sympathy with
[1:03:08] it I was a game warden of Indiana for
[1:03:12] several years while I was still a
[1:03:13] Baptist
[1:03:15] pastor one
[1:03:17] day I was left my truck and was going
[1:03:21] across a
[1:03:22] field and I had a little old gun pistol
[1:03:26] revolver I was supposed to pack and I
[1:03:30] going over across the hills to see a
[1:03:33] sick friend to pray for
[1:03:35] him and I took this little old gun off
[1:03:38] and throw it up in the seat and started
[1:03:40] across the
[1:03:42] field as I walked through the field lot
[1:03:46] of little Shrub Oak I don't think you
[1:03:48] have it here little Shrub Oak we call it
[1:03:50] there in the field I was about 200 yards
[1:03:53] from the fence or better when all of a
[1:03:57] sudden the great fool raised up and I
[1:04:00] recognized him he was that killer from
[1:04:03] the Burks Farm down near the wet Ridge
[1:04:06] Cemetery a few months before that had
[1:04:08] killed a colored man gour him through
[1:04:10] and killed him and they had sold him up
[1:04:12] there because he was a famous gery bull
[1:04:15] a breeder and they had him up there and
[1:04:18] I forgot that he was in that
[1:04:20] field and he rose up not over about 30
[1:04:25] yards from me and anyone knows what
[1:04:28] those vicious animals are and this fell
[1:04:31] a
[1:04:33] killer and as he rose up I was excited
[1:04:36] of course I reach for the gun and it
[1:04:40] wasn't
[1:04:41] there and I'm glad that it wasn't there
[1:04:46] I to kill the then went and paid for
[1:04:50] him I reached for the gun it wasn't
[1:04:52] there then I looked to the fence too far
[1:04:56] away not a tree nowhere but just little
[1:04:59] scrub Oaks about four or five foot high
[1:05:01] and he had been laying down with some
[1:05:03] cattle in this midst of these trees what
[1:05:07] was it if I turn my back he got me no
[1:05:11] matter where went he got me it was
[1:05:16] death then I thought oh my
[1:05:19] Lord I won't end my life as a coward
[1:05:24] I've tried to tell others to be brave in
[1:05:26] the time of trouble I said I'll walk to
[1:05:31] death just as Brave as I can walk trus
[1:05:33] in Jesus
[1:05:35] Christ no more than that come from my
[1:05:39] thinking now please don't take this as
[1:05:44] juvenile but something
[1:05:47] happened oh I wished it would happen
[1:05:50] right
[1:05:52] now always in those cases that something
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:05:58] happens instead of hating that
[1:06:02] bull there was something I sympathized
[1:06:05] with him I loved
[1:06:08] him and I was no more afraid of that
[1:06:12] animal and I am standing here with my
[1:06:15] brethren all here have
[1:06:19] left and I thought poor creature I'm on
[1:06:23] your territory you're an animal you
[1:06:26] don't know any different that's the only
[1:06:29] thing you know is protect your
[1:06:32] rights and I said to this bull in these
[1:06:37] words oh creature of God I am a servant
[1:06:43] of God and I'm on my way to pray for my
[1:06:47] sick
[1:06:48] brother I'm sorry I Disturbed
[1:06:51] you but in Jesus name go lay down
[1:06:57] and he threw his Harms in the ground
[1:07:00] throwing the dirt he fell to his knees
[1:07:02] and through the dirt again I stood there
[1:07:05] just as calm as I am
[1:07:09] now and he rushed towards me just as
[1:07:13] hard as he could come in a
[1:07:15] charge I just stood there for I wasn't
[1:07:20] afraid and when he gotten about five
[1:07:23] feet of me he threw his big feet out
[1:07:25] like that and
[1:07:28] stopped and he looked this way and that
[1:07:30] way so depleted and turned around and
[1:07:35] went over there and laid down and I pass
[1:07:38] within five fet of him and he never
[1:07:40] moved No
[1:07:42] More Jesus Christ God's son when love is
[1:07:47] put in his place it'll defeat any enemy
[1:07:51] there is on the Earth or in tment
[1:07:56] now you say brother Brandon I had a lot
[1:07:59] of confidence in you till
[1:08:01] now well let me tell you brother we all
[1:08:04] going to answer at the day of
[1:08:06] judgment and the god that could close a
[1:08:09] lion's mouth in the den with Daniel
[1:08:12] still lives
[1:08:14] today
[1:08:17] certainly my wife will probably I don't
[1:08:20] know where she's
[1:08:21] at she don't always got to answer me for
[1:08:24] more in the yard the shirt
[1:08:27] off I have about a half acre in the
[1:08:30] parsonage there and one day I was
[1:08:33] pushing my lawn mow and I'd run a few
[1:08:35] rounds and somebody would come into to
[1:08:37] me prayed for i' have to slip out and
[1:08:38] take off my overhauls and put on some
[1:08:40] clothes and running pray for maybe get a
[1:08:42] couple rounds that day in the front yard
[1:08:45] would be growed up before I could get in
[1:08:46] the
[1:08:47] backyard so one hot afternoon I was in
[1:08:51] the backyard no one around no one could
[1:08:54] see me I pulled off my shirt now you all
[1:08:56] don't have hot weather here you have to
[1:08:59] have some of that in Indiana on that
[1:09:01] Ohio River and I was a mowing the grass
[1:09:05] just as hard as I could run afraid
[1:09:06] somebody would come in all at once I
[1:09:08] wouldn't get but a few rounds made and I
[1:09:12] forgot that in the corner of the fence
[1:09:15] was a nest of
[1:09:17] hornets and I Ram that Mo right into
[1:09:21] that nest and friends as God being my
[1:09:24] judge
[1:09:26] I was covered all over with Hornets just
[1:09:28] in a moment now anyone knows what a
[1:09:31] hornet is he'll kill you one Hornet can
[1:09:36] flatten you on the ground and me with no
[1:09:39] shirt
[1:09:40] on and I was standing
[1:09:43] there and something
[1:09:46] happened I don't know what it is it's
[1:09:49] just something that happens it's
[1:09:53] love instead of hating your harness I
[1:09:56] thought poor little creatures of
[1:09:58] God I have nothing again you at your
[1:10:02] home and I Disturbed you sounds like a
[1:10:05] child but the trouble of it is we tried
[1:10:07] to be growing up when we ought to be
[1:10:10] children we take things just as we are
[1:10:13] so
[1:10:14] intelligent we'd have to measure our
[1:10:17] intelligence with God's grace one time I
[1:10:19] wonder what would come
[1:10:20] up but in this these harnesses all over
[1:10:24] me and I wasn't afraid of the little
[1:10:27] fellas I said little creatures go back
[1:10:29] into your nest I will not harm you and
[1:10:33] as God
[1:10:35] Lives them Hornets whed around me three
[1:10:38] or four times and went right straight
[1:10:40] back into their nest that's just the
[1:10:43] truth as I stand
[1:10:44] here last summer Mr Mercer here Mr Gold
[1:10:49] which is your also and many of the the
[1:10:53] some of the campaign party it's not with
[1:10:55] me now we were sitting on my front steps
[1:10:58] it had been a a negro girl it's in the
[1:11:01] paper that morning a lovely beautiful
[1:11:03] looking colored girl and she had had a
[1:11:08] baby illegitimately born and she had
[1:11:11] tucked this baby and smothered it in
[1:11:13] some blankets wrapped some water around
[1:11:15] it and hir a cab and she went out on the
[1:11:18] Ohio bridge and looked off and lik she
[1:11:21] go throw a bundle over and she threw the
[1:11:23] baby in the river the tag cab driver
[1:11:26] reported back to the authorities they
[1:11:28] stained it out and found it was a
[1:11:31] baby Mr Mercer here and Mr Gold I call
[1:11:34] on my student ministers if you ever knew
[1:11:37] who they was one's a Catholic and the
[1:11:39] other I think's a steam fitter and they
[1:11:41] made them themselves a little FBI to
[1:11:42] come find out if these Visions were
[1:11:44] right and come in town posing as
[1:11:46] somebody else and the Lord revealed it
[1:11:48] all to them right there and they become
[1:11:51] friends of mine and they were sitting on
[1:11:53] the porch and I was teaching I said that
[1:11:56] woman isn't a mother a mother wouldn't
[1:11:58] do a thing like that noer I said she's a
[1:12:02] female it gave birth to a baby but she's
[1:12:05] not a
[1:12:07] mother a mother is a greater name than
[1:12:10] that and while we were talking coming
[1:12:13] down the road I don't know where you
[1:12:15] know what they are here the animals was
[1:12:17] a
[1:12:18] possum I live
[1:12:20] about 200 yards from a little woods on
[1:12:23] the River Bank the three houses between
[1:12:26] me and the woods with no fances my house
[1:12:28] has a fence around it and this old pum
[1:12:31] come up in the middle of the day about
[1:12:32] 10 o00 I guess at morning turned in the
[1:12:35] gate and I said that possum has
[1:12:38] rbies because of possum anyone knows a
[1:12:42] posum prows at night when the Sun goes
[1:12:46] down they go out and prow in daytime
[1:12:48] they're practically
[1:12:50] blind and here come this pum right in
[1:12:53] the hot summer in the middle of the day
[1:12:55] coming right up and turned in my gate Mr
[1:12:58] Woods who formerly was Jehovah Witness
[1:13:00] and his boy was healed with infantile
[1:13:02] paralysis his legs draw behind him you
[1:13:04] don't even know which leg it was now L
[1:13:06] his mother would have to tell him which
[1:13:07] it was he had quit his Contracting and
[1:13:10] moved in next door to me just to be with
[1:13:12] me and he had been cut it help me cut
[1:13:14] the yard and the rake was laying there
[1:13:17] we been rake in the grass C it gotten
[1:13:19] tall and Leo and Jean and I run out to
[1:13:23] the yard and I took this rake and throw
[1:13:25] it over the pum to stop
[1:13:28] it and when it did it just started
[1:13:30] gnawing on the rake now that's unusual
[1:13:33] because the pum usually when he touch
[1:13:36] him he what they call play possum he
[1:13:38] just lays act like he's
[1:13:40] dead and while he was in that condition
[1:13:44] Mrs Woods come up and Mr woods and Mrs
[1:13:47] Woods is a
[1:13:48] Veterinary and while he was laying in
[1:13:50] that condition I said oh I see what's
[1:13:53] the matter the dogs had got her a few
[1:13:56] days before our car and it mashed her
[1:13:58] left shoulder till it was swollen about
[1:14:01] that big broken hanging back behind her
[1:14:04] and this is an awful word to say but the
[1:14:06] Flies had bloated and maggots was
[1:14:08] working on them and I said just look at
[1:14:11] that I said that poor old thing is dying
[1:14:14] I said that's what made her fight like
[1:14:16] that and just then the Milkman come up
[1:14:20] and he was looking at her all of us
[1:14:22] standing around and a possum and a
[1:14:24] kangaroo is the only two animals that
[1:14:26] have a pocket they care they're young in
[1:14:29] so the old pum had let down her string
[1:14:33] that help the the pocket together and
[1:14:37] nine little baby possums naked about
[1:14:39] that long has crawling on the ground I
[1:14:42] said look at that now come here Leo Jean
[1:14:46] I said there is real Mother's Love
[1:14:49] there's really more mother about this
[1:14:52] old possum than there is about that
[1:14:53] woman that drowned her baby
[1:14:56] she doesn't have over 30 minutes longer
[1:14:59] to live and she's willing to give that
[1:15:02] 30 minutes to fight for them babies it's
[1:15:06] Mother's Love that's in her that makes
[1:15:08] her do it and while we were looking at
[1:15:11] it Mrs wood said brother brand what are
[1:15:13] you going to do with it said won't you
[1:15:15] you kill her now and said take them
[1:15:17] little ones and just kill them quickly
[1:15:18] because got a round mouth and they can't
[1:15:20] nurse a bottle so you'll have to kill
[1:15:22] him I said I just can't do it
[1:15:26] why Miss Wood said I go and get you a
[1:15:28] gun and kill it said I thought you was a
[1:15:31] hunter I said I'm a Hunter but I'm not a
[1:15:34] killer I said I I just couldn't do it
[1:15:37] that's a mother and she's fighting for
[1:15:40] her babies I haven't got the heart to do
[1:15:44] it she said well let Banks do it that's
[1:15:47] her husband I said no I can't do that
[1:15:50] said you don't mean you're going to let
[1:15:51] that poor thing lay there and suffer the
[1:15:53] woman was right in her with
[1:15:55] thinking said being a Veterinary she
[1:15:58] know the Humane thing to do was kill him
[1:16:01] and I said that's right Mrs woods but I
[1:16:03] just can't do it she said you going to
[1:16:05] let her lay down like that I said yes
[1:16:08] and I let the rake up and she made her
[1:16:10] way up to my doorstep and collapsed we
[1:16:13] went up there and poured water on her
[1:16:15] every once in a while she looked like
[1:16:16] she greened just a little had the posum
[1:16:19] does make the
[1:16:21] grin that night after a long days of
[1:16:24] service Mr wood said brother BR you
[1:16:27] service long enough today said let's go
[1:16:29] out and take a ride coming in that night
[1:16:31] at 11:00 there laid the old pum still
[1:16:33] laying there he said now you know if
[1:16:36] she' have ever moved anymore she'd move
[1:16:37] when the sun went down those little
[1:16:40] babies still nursing that almost dead
[1:16:43] mother all night I couldn't
[1:16:45] sleep the next morning I went out about
[1:16:48] 6:00 there was old posum still laying
[1:16:51] there do all over flies all over the
[1:16:53] lake well I thought that poor old thing
[1:16:56] and I can't kill her those little babies
[1:16:58] still nursing at her I thought suppose
[1:17:01] she's dead and I kicked on her a few
[1:17:03] times with my foot I seen her move just
[1:17:05] a little she's still alive I thought oh
[1:17:08] my just then I heard my little girl
[1:17:10] Rebecca here she's going to be a
[1:17:12] spiritual little girl she just saw her
[1:17:14] first Vision recently in the
[1:17:17] school quite just a
[1:17:21] moment I'm going to do something that or
[1:17:24] try something if God
[1:17:26] willing I'm going to ask him I'm going
[1:17:30] to ask you people
[1:17:31] tonight I told Billy not to give out any
[1:17:34] prayer cards we already got prayer cards
[1:17:38] out not to give out anymore tonight
[1:17:42] which we usually
[1:17:43] do but I'm going to ask those who's got
[1:17:46] prayer card just hold your peace for a
[1:17:48] minute I'm going to ask the heavenly
[1:17:51] father that if we have found Grace in
[1:17:54] his sight
[1:17:55] tonight that he will move over this
[1:17:57] audience now and will heal the sick
[1:18:00] without you coming
[1:18:02] here I believe he'll do it I'm asking
[1:18:05] him to upon the Merit of his word on the
[1:18:09] Merit of these people coming to Christ
[1:18:12] I've done my best all I know how to do
[1:18:16] immediately after this service I'll ask
[1:18:17] you to come to the Altar and pray just a
[1:18:20] moment we've been late each night and
[1:18:22] I'm going to ask you to be reverent and
[1:18:25] pray and look this away and if Christ
[1:18:29] the one that I have spoke of God's
[1:18:31] atonement if he were standing here in
[1:18:33] this pulpit and the Bible said that he
[1:18:35] is a high priest that can be touched by
[1:18:38] the feeling of our infirmities how many
[1:18:39] knows the Bible says
[1:18:41] that right well when a woman touched him
[1:18:45] when he was your on Earth he turned
[1:18:47] around and said who touched me and he
[1:18:49] kept looking over the audience till he
[1:18:50] found the woman and told her her
[1:18:52] condition and told her her faith that
[1:18:53] saved her is that right
[1:18:55] the Bible said he's the same yesterday
[1:18:57] today and forever that was the sign of
[1:18:59] the Messiah in the Bible when he was
[1:19:01] here because he did those things to the
[1:19:04] Jew and Samaritan and Gentile and all
[1:19:06] how many knows that to be the truth that
[1:19:08] was the Seal of his
[1:19:12] messiahship now if you will give me your
[1:19:15] attention just for a moment everybody
[1:19:18] believ everybody look everybody beli
[1:19:21] look to Christ say Lord Jesus I'm in
[1:19:25] need and we got a day where I feel sorry
[1:19:29] for the people one says this is a way
[1:19:32] that's the way we got the truth we got
[1:19:35] poor people don't know which way to go
[1:19:38] American and Canadian people are the
[1:19:40] worst confused people in all the world
[1:19:42] that's right the worst confused of all
[1:19:45] the world if he anywhere that
[1:19:46] missionaries belong is not in Africa
[1:19:51] it's in the North America continent
[1:19:54] I'm sure if brother Toms is standing
[1:19:56] here he could almost than you to say
[1:19:58] that's true that's right what do you
[1:20:01] think about it brother Toms it's right
[1:20:03] if missionaries are needed it's
[1:20:06] here I don't say this through slur I say
[1:20:10] this through reverence and respect but
[1:20:12] an educated Heathen is harder to deal
[1:20:15] with than an uneducated Heathen and what
[1:20:18] does the word heathen mean
[1:20:20] unbeliever that's right one who's smart
[1:20:23] self-sufficient you can't deal with him
[1:20:25] let one that knows he knows nothing
[1:20:27] he'll know Christ in a little bit if
[1:20:28] you'll tell him that's right they won't
[1:20:31] try to figure nothing out he just
[1:20:32] believes in that settled it tens of
[1:20:36] thousands coming a
[1:20:38] time now look this way I won't take up
[1:20:42] no more time I feel that the holy spirit
[1:20:45] is here God is always here but I believe
[1:20:49] his presence here now through this
[1:20:50] audience especially here where I can see
[1:20:53] pling in the audience because I've been
[1:20:55] preaching hard and in this audience if
[1:20:58] the holy spirit will come and perform
[1:21:00] the same Miracles right here from this
[1:21:02] platform into that audience that he did
[1:21:04] when he was on Earth how many will say
[1:21:06] it'll increase my faith and make me
[1:21:08] happy now we won't even we want people
[1:21:10] out of the audience all around wherever
[1:21:12] you are now just be reverent and set Qui
[1:21:15] just for a
[1:21:19] moment I just want to look at this side
[1:21:22] and pray I have no way in the world uh
[1:21:26] if somebody would come here if this man
[1:21:28] raise up and say brother brand what's
[1:21:29] wrong and my mother was laying here and
[1:21:31] say Billy what's wrong with me honey I
[1:21:33] nursed you when he was a baby I took
[1:21:35] care of you I fed you I what all I've
[1:21:38] done for you honey what's my outcome I
[1:21:40] wouldn't know God would have to tell me
[1:21:42] to my poor mother I have no way of
[1:21:44] controlling it it's God's grace that
[1:21:47] does it the same grace of God but you're
[1:21:50] sick people many of you here and I God
[1:21:53] wants to heal you and he's already done
[1:21:55] it he just wants your faith to believe
[1:21:58] it now let's just try to go across the
[1:22:00] audience one way or the other let's look
[1:22:01] in this way and how you people over here
[1:22:03] go to praying and just saying God be

[1:22:19] that's scientific if this is my last
[1:22:22] message tonight remember my word is the
[1:22:26] truth because the Bible says it's a
[1:22:29] truth my Ministry proves it's a truth
[1:22:31] the holy spirit in it and the scientific
[1:22:33] world knows it's the truth so there's
[1:22:36] the three Witnesses may God give us
[1:22:39] three Witnesses here tonight at least
[1:22:41] three people if God will do that I'll be
[1:22:43] happy about it three

[1:22:55] of spirit everything's a con every one
[1:22:58] of you is a
[1:22:59] spirit everyone's a
[1:23:02] spirit if you wasn't you wouldn't be
[1:23:08] here I
[1:23:10] hear I hope that the audience will look
[1:23:13] at me at this time just watch I'm
[1:23:15] standing right here right in between
[1:23:18] here and where that step goes down there
[1:23:21] you see that circle of light that little
[1:23:23] light circle cing
[1:23:25] there now that's the light that's on
[1:23:27] this picture I just now
[1:23:30] appeared if I say in the presence of it
[1:23:33] and in my Bible and before the creator
[1:23:36] of heavens and earth I believe that
[1:23:38] that's the same light the pillar of fire
[1:23:41] that led the children of Israel I
[1:23:44] believe that Pillar of Fire was made
[1:23:46] flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of
[1:23:49] the Son of God Jesus Christ I believe
[1:23:52] that Jesus Christ set on Earth according
[1:23:54] to to his word I come from God I go back
[1:23:57] to
[1:23:58] God and I believe that when he returned
[1:24:00] back he returned back to that same light
[1:24:03] that led the children of Israel I
[1:24:05] believe that that is the same light that
[1:24:07] Paul saw on his road that was so bright
[1:24:10] to him and struck him down although
[1:24:11] those who was with him did not see the
[1:24:14] light I do not know where anyone sees
[1:24:17] this or not I can't say I believe it's
[1:24:19] the same light that come into the prison
[1:24:22] that night with Peter the Apostle and he
[1:24:24] dream when the prison doors open and let
[1:24:26] him out I truly believe that almighty
[1:24:30] God is the creator of heavens and earth
[1:24:32] and Jesus Christ is his son who is
[1:24:35] present
