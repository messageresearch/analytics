[6:17] Amen. Let's stand. We just start by

[6:23] his faithfulness to us.
[6:25] [applause and cheering] Hallelujah.
[6:32] Amen. We get together and we have these
[6:34] special meetings. It's sometimes it's
[6:36] easier to sing, sometimes it's easier to
[6:38] worship than the Wednesday nights when
[6:40] it's just it's it's a sparer crowd. So,
[6:42] it's not so much of a sacrifice of
[6:44] praise that we need to bring tonight.
[6:46] [music] We should come with excitement
[6:47] and expectation in our hearts. But I
[6:48] want to start with that this evening. We
[6:50] bring the sacrifice of praise into the
[6:52] house [music] of our God.
[6:55] We bring the sacrifice of [singing]
[6:57] praise
[6:59] into the house of the
[7:02] [singing and music] Lord.

[7:10] into the house [singing and music] of
[7:13] our Lord.
[7:16] And we offer up to you
[7:21] the sacrificees [singing]
[7:24] of thanksgiving
[7:27] and we offer [singing]
[7:29] up to you
[7:32] the sacrificees. [singing and music]
[7:34] Let's sing that one more time.
[7:37] Oh yes, we [music and singing] bring the
[7:40] sacrifice of praise
[7:43] into the house.
[7:45] of [music and singing]
[7:46] our Lord.
[7:49] We bring sacrifice of praise
[7:54] into the house
[7:56] of [singing] our Lord.
[8:00] And we offer [music]
[8:02] up to you
[8:05] the sacrifice [music]
[8:08] of thanksgiving [singing]
[8:11] and the offer of to you
[8:16] the sacrifice
[8:19] of joy.
[8:23] Amen.
[8:27] Amen. And I saw our brother Armando
[8:29] Rivera in the in the house. I haven't
[8:33] seen him while I've been looking out,
[8:34] but I'd like to have him open our
[8:36] service with a word of prayer. So,
[8:38] [music] as we sing the next chorus
[8:40] together, if brother Arando could come.
[8:42] What a mighty God we serve. Yes. What a
[8:45] mighty God we serve.
[8:50] Oh, what a mighty God we [music] serve.
[8:56] Angels bow before him. Heaven and earth
[9:00] adore him. Oh, what a mighty God we
[9:04] serve. One more time. What a mighty God
[9:09] we serve. Oh, we serve.
[9:12] What a mighty God [music] we serve.
[9:18] Angels bow before him and adore him.
[9:23] What a mighty [music] God we serve.
[9:26] Jesus is Jesus is the God I serve.
[9:31] [music and singing]
[9:33] Yes, Jesus is the God I serve.
[9:39] Angels [music] bow [singing] before him.
[9:42] Heaven and earth.
[9:45] Jesus is the God [music and singing]
[9:47] I serve.
[10:01] Let us pray.
[10:05] Heavenly Father, we come to you this
[10:07] evening.
[10:11] First of all, asking forgiveness for our
[10:15] trespasses, mistakes, [music] sins,
[10:17] Lord.
[10:18] And father, we know that in your
[10:20] presence, we're going to [music] be
[10:22] blessed.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; And we know, Lord, that you have taken
[10:26] us from darkness [music] unto light. And
[10:30] we are the children of light.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; And Father, let the Holy Spirit, speak
[10:36] to our hearts, and Father, bring the
[10:41] results [music]
[10:42] that are beneficial to our lives in our
[10:46] spiritual walk.
[10:48] We know that you are already here
[10:51] and we are here praising you and adoring
[10:53] you. Lord,
[10:55] we open [music] this service
[10:58] and Father, we know that you're going to
[11:00] bless us [music] tonight. We ask these
[11:02] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:04] Christ. Amen.
[11:16] Maybe we just turn around, shake hands
[11:18] with those that are around you this

[11:20] song. So good to see a full house and
[11:23] smiles on everyone's face. Glory to his

[41:36] [applause]
[41:46] &gt;&gt; My my, what a presence to be in, saint.
[41:48] So good to be with each one of you. Let
[41:50] Thank you for letting us shoehorn you
[41:51] in. We just done the best [music] we
[41:52] can. So forgive us if we mishandled
[41:54] anything and just in the presence of the
[41:57] Lord and so thankful for it. We didn't
[41:58] have any prayer requests this evening.
[42:01] That's good. But maybe there's something
[42:02] on your heart you want to say, "Lord,
[42:05] I'm one of your children and I got
[42:06] something. I got a family member,
[42:08] something I want to hold before you."
[42:10] Dear God, we're so thankful to be in
[42:11] your presence. Lord, there's nothing
[42:12] like it. It's a Saturday night, Lord. A
[42:14] sacrifice of praise. We're so thankful
[42:16] for brother John, the ministry, Lord,
[42:19] the [music] each one that's put a
[42:20] shoulder to the will, this place, Lord,
[42:22] that we dedicate to you. Hard to imagine
[42:25] just a short time ago being in this
[42:27] little rental bank building, Lord, and
[42:29] you blessed us with this fine little
[42:31] humble place. We're so [music] thankful
[42:33] and we know you own it all. You don't
[42:36] need us to give anything to you, but you
[42:38] like that and you've actually commanded
[42:40] that for the tithes and our [music]
[42:42] offerings. Lord, as grateful children,
[42:44] we just want to say thank you, Lord
[42:46] Jesus. And may you be our guest of
[42:49] honor. Anoint the word today, our ears
[42:52] to hear that we might go home a better
[42:54] person, Lord, knowing that you're coming
[42:56] as very soon we see the signs each day.
[42:58] And not because of our righteousness,
[43:01] Lord, something we're going to do,
[43:02] something we're going to say, but Lord,
[43:04] we know Moses walked with you first. He
[43:07] was educated and he had all these things
[43:09] and in 40 years Lord and then you had to
[43:12] take all of that away in 40 years so
[43:15] that he was completely dependent upon
[43:18] you. He didn't have his family. He
[43:20] didn't have his family. He didn't have
[43:21] his prestige. He didn't have the money.
[43:24] All those things Lord [music]
[43:25] you took that away. But oh my, you gave
[43:27] him such a great thing. And that is you
[43:29] and your word Lord. And we follow it
[43:31] precisely completely holy. We give all
[43:34] all to you. We are completely dependent
[43:36] on you and we pray that you will meet
[43:38] our needs Lord in your time. Deliver us
[43:40] in your time. Make us more like you in
[43:43] your time. We love you and thank you.
[43:45] And in the precious name of our Lord and
[43:46] Savior, all God's people say,
[43:48] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. May we ask you to remain standing
[44:00] for a moment. We have a four or five
[44:03] sisters that are visiting from [music]
[44:05] Quebec that we'd like to have them make
[44:07] their way forward as we're taking up the
[44:09] offering and
[44:11] like to just sing a song as they're
[44:12] doing that key of D. We will remember.
[44:18] We will remember.
[44:21] We will [singing]
[44:22] remember.

[44:43] You're our [singing] creator, [music]
[44:47] our life sustainer,
[44:50] deliverer, [singing]
[44:52] our comfort [music]
[44:53] and joy.
[44:56] Throughout the ages, [singing and music]
[45:00] you've been our shelter, our peace in
[45:04] the midst of [music and singing] the
[45:05] storm.
[45:10] We will [singing and music]
[45:10] remember.

[45:33] through life's darkest [music] valleys.
[45:36] When we walk through
[45:39] life's [music] darkest [singing]
[45:41] valleys,
[45:43] we will look back at all you have done.
[45:50] And we [singing] will shout
[45:53] our God is good. Oh, [singing and music]
[45:55] and he is the faithful one.
[46:03] We [music] will [singing] remember.

[49:05] I get [singing] so thrilled
[49:09] with Jesus
[49:12] every [singing] moment [music] of the

[49:17] I get so [singing] thrilled

[49:23] is the [singing] truth, the [music]
[49:26] life, the way
[49:29] I [singing] get so

[49:35] He [music] satisfies my longing
[49:38] [singing]

[50:23] He satisfies [music]
[50:24] my [singing]
[50:25] longing soul.
[50:28] I get so thrilled. [singing]
[50:32] Oh, when Jesus
[50:35] is the [singing] one who makes me.
[50:41] Amen. [applause]
[50:44] [music]
[50:49] Amen. Maybe we can just stand. We're
[50:52] going to have our choir come and and
[50:54] prepare to sing. And just as they're
[50:56] doing that, it was anywhere here this
[51:00] morning for the the youth service. You
[51:02] would have heard our brother Trevor
[51:04] talking about a a chemical messenger
[51:07] that God's put in our body called
[51:10] dopamine.
[51:11] And it's it's it's something that is a
[51:14] good thing. And we've been singing about
[51:16] things tonight. Taste and see that the
[51:18] Lord is good. And we said, "He's the one
[51:22] that makes me whole. He satisfies my
[51:24] longing soul." And so I I would
[51:27] encourage you tonight, if you don't know
[51:28] what we're singing about, you don't know
[51:29] what we're getting happy about, taste
[51:31] and see that the Lord is good. So,
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, as the choir comes, just
[51:38] wanted to share a short testimony. When
[51:40] I was 91, I wasn't serving the Lord at
[51:43] the time. Went to the convention meeting
[51:45] that they had at Tucson Tabernacle and a
[51:48] choir got up to sing and I saw the life
[51:51] of of the Lord and the Holy Spirit and
[51:54] the members of that choir, one of which
[51:56] was now my wife.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; But looking at at them, I said, I know I
[52:01] don't have what they have, and I need
[52:03] that.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's here tonight. There's a
[52:06] fountain that's flowing. So we just
[52:09] maybe we can sing a chorus as their
[52:10] chorus as the choir is making their way
[52:12] up. There's nothing like the presence
[52:15] nothing like the presence of the Lord.
[52:20] There's nothing like [singing] the
[52:22] presence.
[52:24] Nothing like the presence [singing]
[52:29] Nothing like the presence of [singing]
[52:32] the Lord.
[52:37] [music] Nothing [singing] like the
[52:39] presence.
[52:41] Nothing like the presence. [music]

[53:05] the [singing] Lord.
[53:09] There is joy [singing] in the presence.
[53:13] Joy in [singing] the presence. [music]
[53:17] Joy in the presence [singing] of the
[53:21] Lord. One more. There's freedom in the
[53:23] presence. There is freedom in the
[53:27] presence.
[53:29] Freedom in the presence. [singing]
[53:33] Freedom [music] in the presence of the
[53:37] Lord. [singing]
[53:40] Yes, there's freedom [music] in the
[53:43] presence.
[53:45] There's freedom in the
[53:47] [music and singing] presence.

[53:52] of the Lord. [singing]

[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; A strange thing happened last night. I
[1:04:33] was supposed to sing a different song
[1:04:36] and so I [music] sung a song that
[1:04:40] it just came out that way. So
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; that was a supernatural thing that
[1:04:43] happened last night.

[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And he heard about the meetings and he
[1:18:53] um came to join us.
[1:18:57] [clears throat] So I appreciate that.
[1:18:59] [applause]
[1:19:06] When COVID struck, we had we wanted to
[1:19:08] do a little outreach me uh meeting on
[1:19:11] the streets because they had closed
[1:19:12] their churches. Tucant was still allowed
[1:19:14] to meet and gather. We didn't know
[1:19:16] exactly how to do that. And I called
[1:19:18] brother Brooks and he joined. He brought
[1:19:20] his tamarine and a few brothers. We went
[1:19:23] on the street corner there, two
[1:19:24] services, Friday and a Saturday. And um
[1:19:30] um
[1:19:31] there were two people
[1:19:34] that came out. There was an Asian guy
[1:19:35] that came and we baptized him. And then
[1:19:37] another guy, there's a little homeless
[1:19:39] guy. Remember him drinking? He still
[1:19:41] comes to church here. His name is
[1:19:44] brother. His name is Doug.
[1:19:46] [applause]
[1:19:47] Amen.
[1:19:50] So we call him home. He's not homeless,
[1:19:53] but he looks homeless. And so we call
[1:19:55] him homeless brother Doug. But he comes
[1:19:58] to church. He sits right there. And uh
[1:20:00] he just called me today. Pastor Israel.
[1:20:02] Pastor Israel. And so, God bless him.
[1:20:05] God bless brother Brooks for joining us.
[1:20:07] And so, without further ado, we're going
[1:20:09] to uh ask you all to stand and have
[1:20:13] brother Ferguson come and take the
[1:20:14] pulpit at this time, minister to words
[1:20:17] of life.
[1:20:20] 40 plus years over that in pastoring and
[1:20:24] missionary work and established several
[1:20:28] churches in Canada, east and western
[1:20:32] part. very instrumental in the work the
[1:20:35] French work of brother Brandham's
[1:20:36] message going to the French-speaking
[1:20:38] countries of the world for many many
[1:20:41] years and um we thank the Lord for him
[1:20:46] he's a celebrity in the Congo
[1:20:49] and any French-speaking country they
[1:20:52] know brother George Ferguson because
[1:20:54] he's given his life to getting brother
[1:20:57] Brandham's message to those folks
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; when you have it in your language we
[1:21:02] kind of take it for granted, but to get
[1:21:04] it into your language from English into
[1:21:06] French, there has to be instruments of
[1:21:09] men that God uses for that. And he is
[1:21:12] one of them sitting right here behind
[1:21:13] us. And so I always respect him and
[1:21:16] honor him. I know him personally and I
[1:21:18] try to not to rush him too much, but we
[1:21:21] want to rush him a little bit tonight
[1:21:23] because we don't want to go too long.
[1:21:25] But I love to hear him his testimonies
[1:21:28] and uh and and so we are so happy for
[1:21:31] him to be with us. And so as he prepares
[1:21:34] to come, let's sing Amazing Grace.
[1:21:38] [music] That's his oldest daughter on
[1:21:40] the piano right there. Sister Sharon
[1:21:44] Ferguson po
[1:21:47] amazing
[1:21:50] grace
[1:21:52] how sweet
[1:21:55] the sound
[1:21:58] that Say
[1:22:02] [music]
[1:22:25] [music]
[1:22:26] I [singing]
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe you're happy and you
[1:23:11] know it. God bless you all.
[1:23:14] [music]
[1:23:16] But I'll
[1:23:18] I I'll try to take my time and hurry up,
[1:23:22] whatever that means.
[1:23:25] Well, it's really an honor to be here
[1:23:27] with you and I feel a little bit humbled
[1:23:30] with some of these what I would call
[1:23:33] great preachers
[1:23:35] and some, you know, no preacher love to
[1:23:37] hear that he's a great preacher. And I
[1:23:40] told one preacher said, "You're a great
[1:23:42] preacher." And I think brother George is
[1:23:43] a great preacher.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Now, he doesn't agree with me. All
[1:23:46] right, I'll ask him one question and
[1:23:47] he'll change his mind.
[1:23:51] Brother Brandham says, "No, I will ask
[1:23:52] you a question. When you minister, does
[1:23:55] the presence of the Lord come? But
[1:23:57] brother Bannon says, great preachers
[1:24:00] that could bring the presence of God to
[1:24:01] to an audience. That's the great
[1:24:04] preachers. Amen. All right.
[1:24:07] So, I think I think that causes all the
[1:24:10] preachers to change their mind now
[1:24:12] considering what a great preacher is.
[1:24:14] Because if you can't bring the presence
[1:24:16] of God to an audience,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; you're not a preach. You're not a great
[1:24:19] preacher. [laughter] But we want to
[1:24:22] bring the presence of the Lord. We want
[1:24:24] the presence of the Lord to be here.
[1:24:25] Amen. So really, we are all excited.
[1:24:30] We're under anticipations tonight. And
[1:24:32] my prayer is that this won't be George
[1:24:35] Ferguson, but it will be him. You know,
[1:24:39] brother Vanna made a statement that has
[1:24:41] brought more and more signification to
[1:24:43] me in the last couple of months of my
[1:24:46] life when he said, "God speaks through
[1:24:48] his prophet,
[1:24:50] speaks through the apostles.
[1:25:08] I can get out of the way and that it
[1:25:10] won't be me. You speak through me. But
[1:25:12] no, only that. But you hear the people
[1:25:14] singing and brother Brandham said the
[1:25:16] Holy Spirit singing through the people.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; See? Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, you sit in the
[1:25:24] meeting and you're so blessed because
[1:25:26] see brother Isia Brooks get here and
[1:25:28] he's singing and you're so blessed. And
[1:25:31] many people don't realize it's not Come,
[1:25:34] brother. It's not the flesh.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; No sir. It's the anointing come upon him
[1:25:40] and God just use the instrument. God use
[1:25:43] the gift he get and expresses it and
[1:25:45] then we are the beneficiaries. We get
[1:25:47] blessed. He too he's blessed too but we
[1:25:50] get blessed.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Just to know that.
[1:25:53] Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Now tonight uh I was really blessed. I
[1:25:57] I'm sorry I missed brother's meeting
[1:25:59] this morning but you know I met brother
[1:26:02] George and we used to tease te tease
[1:26:05] each other so much in the bus. go to
[1:26:06] Georgia. Remember that? And we always
[1:26:08] see when two Georgees get together, it's
[1:26:11] trouble. Amen. But I think two Georgees
[1:26:14] get together tonight and it's a
[1:26:15] blessing. Amen. [laughter]
[1:26:17] Well, God bless him.
[1:26:20] And God bless all of you and my friend
[1:26:22] here, brother Mando here with us. And
[1:26:25] really, it's an honor to see what God
[1:26:27] has done with Israel. And I remember
[1:26:30] when he had that burden on his heart
[1:26:33] and I couldn't do anything else but
[1:26:34] encourage him. And I encouraged him to
[1:26:36] go forward in the ministry. Same thing I
[1:26:39] did with Barachi Mosaka in Paris and
[1:26:42] Barachi was a little shy preacher, very
[1:26:44] very shy. He was a deacon in the church
[1:26:46] and something happened with the pastor.
[1:26:48] I said, "Barachi, God will use you." And
[1:26:50] he was so bashful and shy and I remember
[1:26:53] Israel was a little bit shy and bashful
[1:26:55] too, you And I remember [clears throat]
[1:26:57] talking with him and I kind of we kind
[1:27:00] of get together so much because we have
[1:27:01] so much in common. I love fishing and I
[1:27:05] believe he loves fishing even more than
[1:27:06] I. So that kind of pulled us together.
[1:27:09] See, and we've got a lot in common, him
[1:27:11] and I. So he was a little bashful at the
[1:27:13] start and I began to talk with him and
[1:27:15] encourage him and and then slowly the
[1:27:17] Lord, you know, put it on his heart,
[1:27:20] started the work and through the years
[1:27:22] I've been coming and it's really been a
[1:27:24] blessing. And I know that brother Paul
[1:27:25] has been here very often and we have
[1:27:26] kind of stood with Israel and some of
[1:27:28] you all here to kind of encourage him
[1:27:31] and stuff and it's really been a
[1:27:32] blessing to come. In fact, the only time
[1:27:34] I get a chance to meet brother is when I
[1:27:36] come to Tucson. So I said well I come
[1:27:39] here and I look forward to seeing him
[1:27:41] look forward to having a little
[1:27:42] fellowship with him because we really
[1:27:43] love each other and we've got so much in
[1:27:45] common. We've been through similar
[1:27:46] struggles, battles and things. You know,
[1:27:49] like I told you all, you know, in the
[1:27:52] ministers meeting, we cried on each
[1:27:53] other's shoulders. You know, we paid
[1:27:55] each other's burden. We held hands
[1:27:57] together and prayed with each other. And
[1:27:59] it's been like that. Amen. So, I really
[1:28:02] certainly thank the Lord for him and for
[1:28:04] all of you and many of you brothers. Uh
[1:28:07] I saw some of you, of course, brother
[1:28:08] Agabell is a bosom friend of mine and he
[1:28:11] was, you know, he pastors a little
[1:28:12] church in in Denver, Colorado. And happy
[1:28:14] to see him and brother Malcolm here with
[1:28:16] us and what a blessing. Amen. all of
[1:28:18] you. Amen. God bless you all. Now, I
[1:28:21] usually I stop and give testimonies of
[1:28:24] some of the work in the foreign fields
[1:28:25] and stuff and but I'm going to go
[1:28:28] straight to the word and in the word I I
[1:28:31] consider I've seen the hand of the Lord
[1:28:33] doing some mighty things this year. In
[1:28:34] fact, the last couple of months
[1:28:37] has been some of the greatest times in
[1:28:40] my entire ministry since God called me.
[1:28:42] I could say I've seen the hand of the
[1:28:44] Lord in a wonderful way. He's really
[1:28:46] helped me so much and I know that that's
[1:28:49] not just for me, it's for all of you.
[1:28:51] And I was happy to see brother David
[1:28:52] McGary. Uh hadn't seen that brother for
[1:28:55] over 20s something years and was happy
[1:28:58] to see him and you know and when I saw
[1:29:00] him the last time I think I didn't have
[1:29:02] much gray hair. My hair was still black
[1:29:04] and he he too and today what you know
[1:29:06] see what where we've gotten. Amen. So we
[1:29:08] certainly thank the Lord. Now my subject
[1:29:11] tonight is the on
[1:29:14] is God and his word
[1:29:16] cannot change.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; God and his word cannot change. And
[1:29:21] we're going to go a little deep into
[1:29:23] this subject
[1:29:25] and I think it will complement a little
[1:29:26] bit what brother George was preaching on
[1:29:29] balance but in a different direction and
[1:29:32] what brother Israel had in his mind on
[1:29:35] that power to become sons of God. You're
[1:29:38] going to see that it is also contained
[1:29:40] in this subject that we are going to be
[1:29:42] speaking of tonight. So I think we are
[1:29:44] under tremendous expectations that the
[1:29:47] Lord will do something for us.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; So I believe we could all stand at this
[1:29:50] time as we enter into prayer. I will
[1:29:53] kind of omit giving testimonies because
[1:29:55] sometimes you start with testimonies and
[1:29:57] you just continue on the testimonies of
[1:29:59] the work in foreign fields and we'll get
[1:30:01] straight to the word. So let's just
[1:30:02] pray.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Father, our hearts rejoice together.
[1:30:08] As we think of what you mean to us, what
[1:30:10] you've done for us,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; and when we think of how great you are,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; We think of how little we are.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And Father, these ministering brothers,
[1:30:21] many of them here, we just pray you will
[1:30:24] bless them, Lord.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; May you help your unworthy servant, this
[1:30:30] congregation here tonight, Father, Lord,
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; that you'll take me out of the way. And
[1:30:36] if Lord, if it be your will, just take
[1:30:39] mine and let it be you. Let it be you
[1:30:42] speak into our hearts, speaking through
[1:30:43] your word, Lord,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; that everyone that come tonight
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; would receive a great blessing from you.
[1:30:50] That
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; when we leave this church, we could say
[1:30:52] that our hearts was blessed to be in the
[1:30:56] presence of the Lord.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We could leave stronger in the Lord.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; We can leave with something that seeds
[1:31:02] that are planted for all eternity, Lord.
[1:31:05] and that when we meet on the other side,
[1:31:06] we will remember the things that you did
[1:31:08] for us during these meetings. And
[1:31:10] father, as our brother David will
[1:31:12] minister tomorrow, may you be with him
[1:31:14] and we just we commit it into your hands
[1:31:17] and even our brother Malcolm and the
[1:31:18] singing tomorrow night. Lord, we just
[1:31:20] commit everything into your hands in
[1:31:21] Jesus name.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you all. Now we will
[1:31:29] take a couple of scriptures
[1:31:32] just to read as we get into this
[1:31:34] subject.
[1:31:36] Of course
[1:31:38] um there's one of the scriptures here
[1:31:40] that everyone knows
[1:31:42] but anyway I'll just go here and read
[1:31:44] this
[1:31:45] uh Luke chapter 16 verse 16-17.
[1:31:50] Luke 16 verse1 16-1 17 Jesus speaking he
[1:31:55] says the law and the prophets were until
[1:31:57] John
[1:31:59] since that time the kingdom of God is
[1:32:02] preached and every man pressth into it
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; and it is easier for heaven and earth to
[1:32:08] pass than one tit of the law to fail.
[1:32:12] What a statement.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; What a statement of Jesus making to us.
[1:32:18] Um,
[1:32:19] we'll go a little further. We'll go into
[1:32:22] Hebrews chapter 13. Of course, this was
[1:32:25] the theme of brother Brandham's
[1:32:27] meetings. Jesus Christ the same
[1:32:29] yesterday, today, and forever. So, we
[1:32:33] would look at Hebrews chapter 13 verse 7
[1:32:36] to9.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] Remember them which have the rule over
[1:32:42] you, who have spoken unto you the word
[1:32:44] of God, whose faith follow, considering
[1:32:47] the end of their conversation,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:32:53] and forever. Be not carried about with
[1:32:56] diverse and strange doctrines. For it is
[1:32:59] a good thing that the heart be
[1:33:01] established with grace, not m not with
[1:33:04] meats which have not profited them that
[1:33:06] have been occupied therein.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Father, we commit this service into your
[1:33:12] hands now.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; And the reading of your word and pray
[1:33:16] that you will take your word, Lord, and
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; put it into the hearts of us all as we
[1:33:20] look to you in Jesus name. Amen. God
[1:33:23] bless you all.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You can be seated now.
[1:33:29] I
[1:33:30] do believe that all of us
[1:33:33] believe
[1:33:35] here tonight
[1:33:37] that ge that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:41] cannot change
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; and that his word cannot change.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And tonight we want to go a little deep
[1:33:49] into that
[1:33:51] and trust it will be a blessing to all
[1:33:56] of you. Yeah.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Now I want to start with just reading a
[1:33:59] little quotation of brother Brandham
[1:34:01] taken from the message God does God
[1:34:03] change his mind in preaching Los
[1:34:06] Angeles. He said you know we can change
[1:34:09] our mind and because we learn a little
[1:34:12] different. We know we were wrong. But I
[1:34:16] don't believe that God could change his
[1:34:18] mind
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; because if he does, then he certainly
[1:34:22] could not be infinite
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; and he could make a better decision if
[1:34:27] he could change it. The faith that I
[1:34:29] have in him that he doesn't change his
[1:34:32] mind because if God ever makes a
[1:34:34] decision,
[1:34:36] he has to stay with that decision. See?
[1:34:40] And each time the same problem comes up,
[1:34:42] he's got to act in the same way he did
[1:34:45] the first time
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; or he acted wrong in the first time.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; So it gives us somewhere to have a basis
[1:34:51] for our faith.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And so we do believe he cannot change.
[1:34:56] So with the that's what the scriptures
[1:34:59] teach us. That's what the word of God
[1:35:00] teaches us. But to get a little deep
[1:35:02] into it, I want to read for you another
[1:35:04] quote from the message from the seven
[1:35:07] church age book and trust that this will
[1:35:09] be a blessing to you. All right.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; This quote really meant a lot to me from
[1:35:15] the church ages and then we go into the
[1:35:18] scriptures as we go into this little
[1:35:19] study tonight.
[1:35:21] Brother Banner mentioned he said since
[1:35:23] this study he's talking about the study
[1:35:25] of this of the church ages was to be the
[1:35:27] most serious one I ever undertaken up to
[1:35:30] this time I sought God for many days for
[1:35:32] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[1:35:36] Then then only did I did I read the
[1:35:38] scriptures on the church ages and delve
[1:35:41] into the many church histories written
[1:35:43] by the most unbiased historians that I
[1:35:46] could find. The servant of Adam first
[1:35:49] sought the Lord and after he sought the
[1:35:51] Lord for the inspiration of the Holy
[1:35:54] Spirit then he went to the history books
[1:35:56] to read those history books.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Now he's continuing here. He says God
[1:36:03] did not fail to answer my prayer
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; for a while I read the word
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; and the histories. So brother Brandon
[1:36:10] went into the history books. He also
[1:36:12] went into the Bible. He read the word
[1:36:15] read the history books.
[1:36:17] He says here, "For while I read the word
[1:36:20] and the histories, I was able by the
[1:36:23] Holy Spirit to see unfold a pattern that
[1:36:27] run through the centuries and right now
[1:36:29] into this present last day." The key
[1:36:33] given me of the Lord whereby I was able
[1:36:36] to determine the messenger for each age
[1:36:39] is the most scriptural one. In fact, it
[1:36:43] might be called the keystone of the
[1:36:45] revelation.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It is the revelation that God never
[1:36:51] changes.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; So the revelation
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; that God never changes is the keystone
[1:36:58] revelation. This is the revelation that
[1:37:01] opens up the entire Bible.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; So with this revelation, we can go
[1:37:07] before God. This is the revelation that
[1:37:10] brother man used when he preached
[1:37:12] marriage and divorce message.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; This is the revelation that he used for
[1:37:15] the theme of his his ministry. This is
[1:37:18] the revelation that when you know that
[1:37:20] God cannot change, you could come to a
[1:37:23] God that you know cannot change. Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; So if you look back as brother Brandham
[1:37:29] tell us here if we can look back and see
[1:37:32] which I'll read it for you right now and
[1:37:35] this here has helped me personally a lot
[1:37:38] in my own personal struggles with the
[1:37:40] devil and also my prayer with the Lord.
[1:37:45] So brother Brandham talking about it
[1:37:47] here.
[1:37:49] He says um
[1:37:51] he says here in the future home he said
[1:37:54] see his plan of redemption is exactly
[1:37:57] the same by everything. He uses the same
[1:38:01] method. He never changes. He said in
[1:38:05] Malachi 3, I am God and I change not.
[1:38:08] Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; The way he does it, therefore, if he
[1:38:11] saves the first man he ever saved by the
[1:38:14] shed blood of an innocent one, he'll
[1:38:16] have to save the next one. And everyone
[1:38:18] that saves will have to be the same way.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; If he healed a man at any time through
[1:38:25] the journey of life,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; be it in the days of Jesus, the
[1:38:29] apostles, the prophets, whenever it was,
[1:38:33] when the same conditions is met,
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; he's got to do it again. That's right.
[1:38:38] He doesn't change. Man changes. Time
[1:38:42] changes.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Ages changes. Dispensation changes. But
[1:38:47] God remains the same.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; He is perfect.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; So if he healed, if one person come and
[1:38:53] the person got healed
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and you come in the same condition, God
[1:38:57] is under obligation to do it. If God
[1:39:00] give a man the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; and the other one come
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; and on the same condition, God is under
[1:39:08] obligation to give him the baptism of
[1:39:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; because he cannot change.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Now, this brings us into another major
[1:39:16] point that I want to bring to you here
[1:39:18] tonight.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Now, listen. The word of God
[1:39:27] cannot change.
[1:39:29] So if God
[1:39:32] put his word,
[1:39:34] he put his word in brother Brook, he put
[1:39:38] his word in this brother here, brother
[1:39:40] Mando.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; He put it in Israel.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; He put it that word when it comes in us
[1:39:45] can change.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Here is something I want to share with
[1:39:51] you. If you take your Bible and come
[1:39:54] with me to the book of Hebrews, chapter
[1:39:57] 11.
[1:39:59] we will go to Hebrews chapter 11. So
[1:40:03] this will kind of help us
[1:40:05] in our little study tonight.
[1:40:09] Now in Hebrews chapter 11,
[1:40:13] we can go up, we can read a lot, but I
[1:40:15] I'll try to go quick. He says, "And what
[1:40:18] shall I say? For the time would fail me
[1:40:21] to tell of Gideon, and of Barack, and of
[1:40:23] Samson, and of Jeff, of David also, and
[1:40:26] Samuel, and of the prophets, who through
[1:40:28] faith subdued kingdoms, route
[1:40:31] righteousness, obtained promises,
[1:40:33] stepped the mouths of lions. So in the
[1:40:35] book of Hebrews, it's by faith Abel, by
[1:40:38] faith Moses. So the same faith that Abel
[1:40:41] had was the same faith that Noah had.
[1:40:44] The same faith that Noah had
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; was the same faith that Abraham had.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Because God, if he give you faith,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; he cannot give me a faith and give you a
[1:40:56] faith that is different.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; If that faith come from God, regardless
[1:41:01] to who it is in, it remains the same.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; It is the same faith.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; So the faith you have is the faith that
[1:41:10] Abraham had. It's the faith that Abel
[1:41:13] had. It's the faith that Moses had. It's
[1:41:16] the faith that Jesus had. It's the faith
[1:41:19] that Paul had.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; The only difference is that someone
[1:41:23] could have a greater measure of the
[1:41:25] faith. So one man could stand like we
[1:41:27] could say, "All right, God gave a
[1:41:29] greater measure to this certain person,
[1:41:31] but in reality, it is the same faith."
[1:41:35] So if you receive the faith of God in
[1:41:38] you, you don't have a different faith
[1:41:40] from somebody else.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; It is exactly the same because the
[1:41:45] revelation, this is the keystone
[1:41:48] revelation of the Bible. It is the
[1:41:50] revelation that God cannot change.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Now, here is something that I want to
[1:41:55] bring to you all.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; We've been measuring on the fact that we
[1:42:00] are so different. The difference is
[1:42:01] among us and the difference is among us.
[1:42:04] and the differences among us which is
[1:42:06] true that there's a lot of divisions and
[1:42:08] separation and stuff but in that true
[1:42:10] bride there is something united there is
[1:42:13] something similar in her because if that
[1:42:16] bride if you have the word of God you
[1:42:19] can't have the word of God in you and
[1:42:21] the word of God in you is different to
[1:42:22] the word of God in somebody else God is
[1:42:25] not the order of this this is this is
[1:42:27] total COMPLETE CONFUSION
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO GOD AND HIS
[1:42:31] word
[1:42:34] Yes, sir.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Now listen, let me go a little a little
[1:42:36] further with you and I'll read for you a
[1:42:38] little quote on that in a little bit. If
[1:42:41] you have the same the love of God within
[1:42:43] your heart,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ took his love and he put it
[1:42:47] in your heart, he can't give you a
[1:42:50] different kind of love to somebody else.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; The love of God within you is the same
[1:42:55] love that Jesus had.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; It is the same love that Paul had.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; It's the same love that Luther had. It
[1:43:02] is the same love that Bernab Brham has.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Because if you if you see a difference
[1:43:09] in the love OF GOD, THEN YOU don't have
[1:43:12] the revelation that he cannot change.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Then we're back into the confusion. THEN
[1:43:23] WE SEE ALL kinds of differences that
[1:43:25] does not exist in God.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:32] Now, don't mix up don't mix up man the
[1:43:34] understanding of a man. I could have an
[1:43:36] understanding a little different to you.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; You could read something and understand
[1:43:41] it different to me.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; But if I believe it with the faith of
[1:43:45] God and you believe it with the faith of
[1:43:47] God,
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; tell me how could that be different?
[1:43:50] Right.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Then what are we doing to God?
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Now, we can go a little further on this,
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; but I want to read something for you
[1:44:07] just before we're going to go a little
[1:44:09] further on it, okay? And trust that the
[1:44:13] Lord would help us. Okay? Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to read for you
[1:44:18] a quote from Brother Brandham on this.
[1:44:21] And what Brother Brandham says here, we
[1:44:25] could back it up with many scriptures,
[1:44:27] too. See, now I want to
[1:44:33] I want to read this here
[1:44:35] for you, okay?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And then we'll go. I trust it will be a
[1:44:41] blessing. Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[1:44:46] Now, brother Brandham says here in the
[1:44:48] Pat's vision, he says, "This morning was
[1:44:51] more of the sermon type placing the
[1:44:54] foundation upon the deity of the of the
[1:44:56] revelation. God being revealed in
[1:44:59] Christ."
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; How many believe it?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; God was revealed in Christ.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Jehovah revealed in Christ. Now, where
[1:45:07] is God to be revealed?
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Where is he going to be revealed now?
[1:45:14] Now,
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; all right, I give you the answer. Now,
[1:45:18] where is God to be revealed?
[1:45:20] In his church.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Now, here is something we have people
[1:45:26] because there's so much misunderstanding
[1:45:28] concerning this word revelation.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; One guy have a revelation, God gave it
[1:45:32] to me.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Another have a revelation is a different
[1:45:35] thing. God give it to me. Another have a
[1:45:37] revelation, God.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, church, God is not the author of
[1:45:41] confusion.
[1:45:44] If God give if God give me a revelation
[1:45:47] in something
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; and he gave him the revelation on the
[1:45:50] same thing, it's the same revelation.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Other than that, what are we doing with
[1:45:56] God? We have people preaching know I
[1:45:59] have look I'll read for you a little bit
[1:46:01] on that in a little bit if we have some
[1:46:02] time because what we have now is chaos
[1:46:05] and revelation and and confusion. Why is
[1:46:08] all the the chaos and confusion? Because
[1:46:10] the people does not have the revelation
[1:46:14] that God cannot change.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; And wherever he is, he can't change. If
[1:46:21] he's in Africa, he can't change. If he's
[1:46:23] here, he can't change. If he's in Asia,
[1:46:25] he can't change.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; If he was back in the time of Moses, he
[1:46:28] can't change. If he was in the time of
[1:46:30] Jesus, he can't change. It is only the
[1:46:32] word coming in its season.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; It's not God chang. He can't. He could
[1:46:39] change his mask.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; He could hide behind a different veil.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; All right. But he can't change.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says here, which
[1:46:52] we'll get into that in a little bitty
[1:46:54] bit.
[1:46:56] This morning was more of the sermon type
[1:46:58] placing the foundation upon the deity of
[1:47:00] the revelation. God being revealed in
[1:47:02] Christ. How many believe that?
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; All right. We believe he was revealed in
[1:47:06] Christ.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. We believe also he came along and
[1:47:09] revealed himself in the prophets
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; and everybody believes that. Many people
[1:47:13] believe that.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; But but goes on.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; He says God was revealed in Christ.
[1:47:19] Jehovah revealed in Christ. Now where is
[1:47:22] God to be revealed?
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; In his church. His church is you. You
[1:47:27] and I.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; In his church with his people in us. the
[1:47:38] same spirit.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; So the Bible tell us by one spirit are
[1:47:44] we all baptized into
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; two bodies?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Three bodies,
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; three bodies, four bodies.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Is Christ divided?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Now come on church.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Is the body of Christ divided?
[1:48:05] Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; We are all listen. I remember telling
[1:48:07] one brother once. I said, "Brother, I
[1:48:10] have the same baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:11] that celebr
[1:48:13] Ferguson, no, no, no, no, no. It's not
[1:48:16] the same baptism of the Holy Ghost." He
[1:48:17] says, "I can't see myself having the
[1:48:20] same Holy Ghost as Peter. Something is
[1:48:22] wrong.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; How could God give you a different Holy
[1:48:25] Ghost? What he gave Peter
[1:48:28] [cheering and applause]
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; now? Come on.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And some people think, well, I have a
[1:48:35] little personal revelation of my own
[1:48:37] that nobody else has got,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; brother.
[1:48:44] [laughter]
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Let me let me just continue on this
[1:48:50] little nice little quote here. Okay.
[1:48:54] Now, okay. The same spirit,
[1:48:59] the same works.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ferguson,
[1:49:04] [laughter]
[1:49:05] I don't see the works in me."
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is fall on your knees
[1:49:09] and pray.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, God of heaven, you promise
[1:49:12] it to me. And whatever he promised, he's
[1:49:14] going to give it to give it to you."
[1:49:15] Now, now, everybody's not going to have
[1:49:17] the same gifts
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; and the same ministry.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; But we all are going to have the same
[1:49:23] spirit,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; the same love. Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; The same faith.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; There's only how many faith?
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; One. Let's say it together.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; One faith.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; ONE LORD,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; one spirit, one baptism. Brother said
[1:49:41] that baptism is the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:43] Ghost.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Let's continue.
[1:49:53] The same manifestation,
[1:49:55] the same love.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; The same love. You see, we have so much
[1:50:03] in common. Do you know why we have so
[1:50:05] much in common? Because we belong to the
[1:50:08] same family.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is our head.
[1:50:15] We we are all if we all if we could say
[1:50:18] all right when you say to God father you
[1:50:21] praying and you say father
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; do you realize what you're saying
[1:50:25] brother says that word father when you
[1:50:27] say father you are telling god I came
[1:50:31] from you
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; and if you if you come from god and
[1:50:39] another one come from god and another
[1:50:41] one come from god where There is this
[1:50:44] division.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; That's why when Jesus spoke to the
[1:50:47] scribes and Pharisees, he said, "Ye of
[1:50:49] your father the devil."
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; NOW THERE ARE THE DEVIL.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; BUT HIS DISCIPLES, WHAT WAS HE DOING? He
[1:50:56] was when he he mold those disciples into
[1:50:59] his own image.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Got to do the same with us. I have to
[1:51:03] hurry. Boy,
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; you know what you do? Pull on my coat
[1:51:08] and I'll step.
[1:51:14] It's It's finished now.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Should I stop?
[1:51:19] [laughter]
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Let's go on.
[1:51:25] [laughter]
[1:51:28] Huh?
[1:51:30] Brother George is watching me.
[1:51:32] [laughter]
[1:51:34] What a blessing. Amen.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, church. You know, excuse me. I I
[1:51:38] have to say this, you know. There's a
[1:51:41] lady in New Brunswick. She's giving out
[1:51:43] tracks, you know,
[1:51:45] look like her mother and father and
[1:51:46] husband and everything died. One person
[1:51:49] come a little track. One guy pastor and
[1:51:52] she handed a check. He said, "Madam, I
[1:51:54] don't want I don't want what you have."
[1:51:56] [laughter]
[1:51:58] Listen,
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; we were miserable without Christ.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; We didn't come to this message to be a
[1:52:04] bunch of miserable Christians.
[1:52:06] [cheering] We come to this message to
[1:52:08] have joy and peace. and blessings in the
[1:52:12] Holy Ghost.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:16] [cheering]
[1:52:16] [laughter]
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; What did Paul say? HE SAYS, "REJOICE.
[1:52:22] AND AGAIN, I say unto you, rejoice.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil steal your joy."
[1:52:30] Don't let the devil [laughter]
[1:52:32] STEAL YOUR JOY. JOY IN THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:52:34] IT'S FOR ALL OF US.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST FOR ONE. [cheering] THE
[1:52:39] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS FOR ALL OF
[1:52:40] US.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; HEALING IS FOR ALL of us.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; DELIVERANCE IS FOR ALL OF US.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; THE PEACE OF GOD IS FOR ALL OF US. THE
[1:52:50] LOVE OF GOD IS FOR ALL OF [screaming]
[1:52:52] US.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; The same love.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; So you tell a brother, you don't have
[1:53:07] love.
[1:53:09] Somebody might say something to hurt you
[1:53:11] in the flesh. He made a mistake.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; And then you look at him and say, "Well,
[1:53:14] does he have love?" Then you go back to
[1:53:16] the word to see what does the word of
[1:53:17] God says. Love is Jesus says, "Any man
[1:53:19] that love me will keep my words."
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; So when you not look Jesus said it, you
[1:53:23] know what the Bible says? John 14.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; He that loveth me not keepeth my words.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; See, so you know when you don't keep the
[1:53:31] word of God, they don't love God. That's
[1:53:32] the Bible. To me, that's the Bible.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Brother Ferguson, no, no,
[1:53:35] no, no. Not brother Ferguson. That's the
[1:53:37] word.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go on.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; The same love, the same forgiveness.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Now you want to know. That's why Paul
[1:53:48] tells us this. As Christ forgive you,
[1:53:51] you forgive others.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; You can say, "All right, did Christ
[1:53:54] forgive you?"
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Do you recognize that Christ has
[1:53:57] forgiven you?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Can you raise your hands tonight and
[1:54:00] say, "Thank you, Lord, you forgive me."
[1:54:02] All right. The same way that you he
[1:54:04] forgive you because when he forgives you
[1:54:08] when he forgives you it's not the way
[1:54:09] people think.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; It's not not that's not the way people
[1:54:12] think.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; I'll give you an example.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Who can I use as an example?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, he volunteered. Come
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Eli. Oh, that's a lovely name. Come up
[1:54:27] here, Elijah.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Well, let's see if Elijah and I have a
[1:54:31] little fight.
[1:54:32] Your dad is here.
[1:54:34] Oh,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; my dad.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Is your dad here?
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was here before.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's see. Elijah and I
[1:54:40] have a little fight. And Elijah hit me.
[1:54:43] Boom. Punch me.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, Elijah, oh, you punched me.
[1:54:47] You hurt me. I split blood." But I said,
[1:54:50] "You know what? I forgive you."
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Now, I could forgive him, but I can't
[1:54:56] give him forgiveness. Now when God
[1:54:59] forgives you, it's more than just
[1:55:01] telling to you, I forgive you. God takes
[1:55:04] his own forgiveness and puts it in your
[1:55:06] heart. And with that forgiveness, you
[1:55:09] could forgive others as Christ forgive
[1:55:12] you. Now, when you recognize what God
[1:55:14] has done to you. Now, the message says
[1:55:17] you're justified by faith. God takes his
[1:55:19] forgiveness. So, we're walking around.
[1:55:22] We're coming to church. Come on.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; We're here upon the earth and in us in
[1:55:27] us is the forgiveness of God.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; So even if somebody do me wrong, they
[1:55:33] already forgiven because in me is the
[1:55:35] forgiveness of Christ.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; So even if I tell you I forgive you,
[1:55:42] you're forgiven even before you do it.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Because it's like me, all of us sitting
[1:55:47] here, even before WE DID WRONG, CHRIST
[1:55:49] DIED AND forgive us. [cheering]
[1:55:53] And that's the kind of forgiveness we
[1:55:55] have. Now when we have the revelation
[1:55:58] that he cannot change, these things
[1:56:01] become real to us.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; We see it. We live it.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just a theory. It's
[1:56:07] something we possess. It's it's in it's
[1:56:09] in us.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go on here.
[1:56:17] The same longsuffering,
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; gentleness,
[1:56:22] patience.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't have patience." All
[1:56:26] you got to do is pray for it.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; A trial will come your way,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; but you'll get the patience. [laughter]
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a west and I forgot to SCRIPT THE
[1:56:41] BIBLE TRIBULATION PRAYERS. [laughter]
[1:56:44] I'm praying in the plane, you know. I
[1:56:46] said, "Lord, I need more patience
[1:56:47] because patience is perfection." Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; You see, knowing how to wait upon God
[1:56:51] and stuff, that's perfection. See,
[1:56:53] Brother Bam says it's character
[1:56:55] formation. How God forms your character.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Character. Brother Brooks, correct me?
[1:57:04] Good. Good. Character. All right. You
[1:57:06] know what I mean? All right. So, I'm
[1:57:08] praying
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; and therefore I come back to the church
[1:57:13] and there was one guy looked at me and
[1:57:14] he says, "You, George Ferguson, come
[1:57:17] here.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; I look at him. I walked out of the
[1:57:22] church and he started bang bang bang.
[1:57:26] And I said, "Lord, what's happening to
[1:57:28] me? What is happening to me is the
[1:57:30] answer of my prayer."
[1:57:34] [laughter]
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; You pray for it, God answer it, AND THEN
[1:57:39] YOU COMPLAIN AFTER. NO. RECOGNIZE THE
[1:57:42] answer of prayer. Look, I got to hurry
[1:57:44] here. I got to hurry.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. The same
[1:57:50] gentleness, patience, peace, mercy, all
[1:57:52] that. All that was in Christ is in the
[1:57:54] church. Remember, keep this in your
[1:57:56] mind. All that that God was, he poured
[1:57:59] into Christ. He was the fullness of the
[1:58:00] Godhead bodily. And all that Christ was,
[1:58:02] he poured into the church. God above us,
[1:58:05] God with us, God in us. The trinity of
[1:58:08] God manifested in three different
[1:58:10] manners. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[1:58:14] Now with the revelation
[1:58:17] that we have
[1:58:20] that God cannot change,
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; the same Holy Spirit,
[1:58:25] the same deliverance,
[1:58:27] the same healing,
[1:58:30] the same God operating in the same way.
[1:58:33] It brings us now to something that we
[1:58:36] need to look at tonight that brother
[1:58:39] Brandon says, and this is happening.
[1:58:42] It's not happening because I desire it
[1:58:45] or you desire it or somebody just pray
[1:58:49] for it. It's happening the way that God
[1:58:52] is working it out.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; And what brother man tell us it is one
[1:58:56] of the great mysteries and what is
[1:58:58] happening right now.
[1:59:01] Now what is happening right now [cough]
[1:59:05] is that right now taking place in the
[1:59:08] bride of Christ when everybody is
[1:59:10] looking at the division everybody's
[1:59:12] looking at confusion everybody's trying
[1:59:15] to get excuse me if I say this I hope it
[1:59:17] don't hurt everybody's trying to get
[1:59:18] churches to unite together
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; which if they could get the churches to
[1:59:22] unite together that's wonderful and
[1:59:24] everybody wants to go bone to bone and
[1:59:26] unite with one another which is also
[1:59:27] scriptural and which is good but in the
[1:59:30] midst of all of this there's another
[1:59:31] uniting going on
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; and this is the major sign but man said
[1:59:37] is the big sign of the hour
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; and some people thinking they put it way
[1:59:41] off into the future. Oh, you know uh
[1:59:43] it's going to happen one day. One day
[1:59:45] we're going to have that. No, it's not
[1:59:47] one day it's going to happen. It's
[1:59:49] happening now. [snorts]
[1:59:50] Now look,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; let me read it for you. Okay,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; let me read it for you.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; All right, are you ready? because we are
[1:59:59] too focused on division and separations
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; and I tell you this I told the ministers
[2:00:03] this morning you know I heard so much
[2:00:05] about divisions and divisions and I was
[2:00:07] was falling into all of this see
[2:00:09] division you all around us there's
[2:00:11] division all around us all around us
[2:00:13] there's division but what's happening in
[2:00:15] all this division and division is God is
[2:00:18] God not doing something where is God in
[2:00:19] all of this is is it God doing all this
[2:00:21] division what's happening now what
[2:00:23] people don't realize is that the shock
[2:00:25] has to pour away
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; from the wheat in order for the weak to
[2:00:29] do a to ripen in the sunlight. This is
[2:00:31] not a sign of division as people think.
[2:00:34] It is a sign of God doing something to
[2:00:36] unite his bride
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; if the people can only see it.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; And that's why he has to give you the
[2:00:43] same love, give you the same faith, give
[2:00:46] you the same revelation. IT IS THOSE
[2:00:47] THINGS THAT are uniting us together.
[2:00:50] BECAUSE IF GOD IS HERE AND GOD IS HERE,
[2:00:52] IT IS THE SAME GOD.
[2:00:55] [applause and cheering]
[2:00:58] NOW,
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; now
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; let me
[2:01:04] let me read for you a little bit what
[2:01:06] brother Brandham says.
[2:01:09] Okay. Because after the opening of the
[2:01:11] seals, Brother Brandham preached this
[2:01:12] message called the uniting of the time
[2:01:14] and sign.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; And before brother Brandham was praying
[2:01:17] and looking for the for the uniting. I
[2:01:19] can read those quotes for you if I had
[2:01:20] the time. He's praying and he's looking
[2:01:23] I can read you the the years and the
[2:01:24] date. He's looking for the anointing.
[2:01:26] He's looking for that that uniting. He's
[2:01:28] looking for it. He's praying for it. He
[2:01:31] said he's praying for it. He's praying
[2:01:32] for it. He's looking for it. All right.
[2:01:34] You're praying for something. YOU'RE
[2:01:36] LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. THERE HAS TO come
[2:01:38] a time when the thing that you're
[2:01:39] praying for and the thing you're
[2:01:40] expecting happens.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; You can't be put in the future all the
[2:01:44] time. In the future all the time. IN THE
[2:01:45] FUTURE. ONE DAY I'LL BE HEALED. ONE DAY
[2:01:47] I'LL BE BLESSED. THERE HAS TO COME A
[2:01:48] TIME WHEN IT HAPPENS.
[2:01:58] Put on my coat.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I haven't watched. Is it?
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; It's counting now. How much?
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; 30 minutes.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I got 30 minutes. Okay. So, brother
[2:02:15] George is going to be watching it. But I
[2:02:17] think you know what? 30 minutes we can
[2:02:19] do a lot. All right. I thought I had
[2:02:22] about 10 more minutes.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, [laughter]
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; all right. Now, let's look at this. Let
[2:02:29] me go a little fast. Okay.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; In
[2:02:43] in 1959, I'm going to give you the the
[2:02:46] time. 590815.
[2:02:48] All right. Let me stop here. Hold on.
[2:02:51] Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[2:02:55] Uh, take my time and hurry up. All
[2:02:58] right. United on the one head. Brother
[2:03:01] Bam says here, and it is very striking
[2:03:03] to see how that man wants to be one.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; The reason he wants to be one is because
[2:03:09] that God designed him for that purpose.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; God designed man, made him up to be one,
[2:03:18] to work together, to cooperate together.
[2:03:20] That's the makeup of man. That's the way
[2:03:23] God made man. But man always wants to
[2:03:27] have his idea about it.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; He wants to project something that God
[2:03:33] never intended him to do.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; He wants to figure his own ways out. He
[2:03:40] wants to make his own plans. He wouldn't
[2:03:42] accept the plan that God made for him
[2:03:45] because it is his fallen nature.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; In his fallen nature, he cannot see what
[2:03:53] God is doing, the program and the plan
[2:03:55] of God. Then brother Brandon goes on. He
[2:03:57] said, "My ministry is a ministry trying
[2:03:59] to unite the body of Christ together,
[2:04:01] not unite denominations to one another."
[2:04:03] This is in 1959. But unite brothers and
[2:04:05] sisters as one group of people, one in
[2:04:08] purpose, one in heart, one in unity to
[2:04:10] see the coming of the Lord. He preached
[2:04:12] this in 1959. He continues here in 1959.
[2:04:15] The full gospel Christian businessman
[2:04:17] has been one of my great supporters in
[2:04:19] taking me in to help fulfill the purpose
[2:04:21] that I believe that God sent me to help
[2:04:23] do. That was to unite the body of Jesus
[2:04:25] Christ together. It's my purpose to do
[2:04:28] that. That's what's in my heart to see
[2:04:30] all of God's children in one accord and
[2:04:32] one one heart moving on. Then I believe
[2:04:35] when that takes place, the work will be
[2:04:37] about done. Brother Brandham's face and
[2:04:39] the millennium will set in. The rapture
[2:04:41] will come and we are certainly praying
[2:04:43] and watching and waiting for that time.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; All right. Here he's saying we're
[2:04:46] praying, we're watching, we're waiting
[2:04:48] for that time. This is in 59. Now we
[2:04:51] come to 1963 after the opening of the
[2:04:54] seals. Here's what he says now.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:58] Come on.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; He says in the uniting time, he says now
[2:05:02] you see where we are living the uniting
[2:05:04] time when we see these things being
[2:05:07] united. Oh my, we failed to see these
[2:05:09] things. You can look in here and see the
[2:05:11] scriptures and see that he promised that
[2:05:14] what he will do.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Now we see it coming to pass. We'll read
[2:05:18] that for you in a little while.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; We see in the church what he promised to
[2:05:22] do. We see it coming to pass. We see the
[2:05:24] nations uniting together. We see the
[2:05:27] isms uniting together. We see the
[2:05:29] churches uniting together. It's a
[2:05:31] uniting time. It's the hour of uniting.
[2:05:33] That's the spirit of the age. We got to
[2:05:35] unite.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Now, that spirit of uniting, I'm going
[2:05:39] to have to hurry. Now, Brother Brandham
[2:05:41] continues.
[2:05:44] I got to put
[2:05:47] All right. I'm going to
[2:05:50] step some of this. Yeah. All right.
[2:05:53] Unite in time. What did he say in
[2:05:56] Malachi 4 would restore? Restore back
[2:05:58] the original Pentecostal faith back to
[2:06:00] the people with the true Pentecostal
[2:06:02] message, the true Pentecostal sign, the
[2:06:04] true Pentecostal evidence, the same God,
[2:06:07] the same power, the same teaching,
[2:06:09] everything exactly
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; with the vindication of the same pillar
[2:06:13] of fire that struck Paul down on the
[2:06:15] road
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; down to Damascus is among us today.
[2:06:18] Hallelujah. Doing the same thing he did
[2:06:20] in that day. Uniting.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; We see the nations uniting. We see the
[2:06:25] word uniting. We see the churches
[2:06:26] uniting. We see the bride uniting.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Uniting with the word.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; The word is God. As the bridegroom being
[2:06:34] the word and the bride being the hearer
[2:06:36] of the word, they come together in a
[2:06:38] union. They unite like a wedding.
[2:06:40] They're getting ready for for the
[2:06:42] wedding. They become one. The word
[2:06:44] becomes you and you becomes the word.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you this. Are you
[2:06:50] waiting for that? Are you saying, "Well,
[2:06:52] one good day is going to happen to me."
[2:06:54] NO, NO, NO. THE TIME is now. It's now.
[2:06:58] It's now.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Could you say amen to that?
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; What is in YOUR HEART NOW? LET'S HURRY
[2:07:05] HERE.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Brother man, continue. All right. He
[2:07:13] says,
[2:07:16] "Amen." Yes, sir. Uniting. What is it?
[2:07:18] She uniting with the word for all
[2:07:20] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[2:07:22] word shall never pass away. She's
[2:07:24] uniting herself with thus sayith the
[2:07:26] Lord regardless of what any denomination
[2:07:29] or anybody else says.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; This is the hour.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; This is the at the time.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; This is God on the scene now.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not waiting. waiting, WAITING FOR
[2:07:49] IT. I'M LIVING IT NOW. IT'S HAPPENING in
[2:07:51] me now. The word is in me now. The word
[2:07:54] is in you now.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Stop stop listening to the devil.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Brother B says, as long as he can get
[2:08:04] you to put it off for another time,
[2:08:05] that's as much that's that's AS GOOD AS
[2:08:07] YOU WANT IT.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; STOP. This is your hour of deliverance.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; This is your hour of victory.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; This is your hour to receive Jesus
[2:08:17] Christ. the same yesterday, today, and
[2:08:20] forever. [cheering]
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Now, [screaming] Brother Brandham says
[2:08:25] here,
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; she's she is uniting herself. SHE'S
[2:08:30] GETTING READY. WHY? SHE IS THE BRIDE.
[2:08:32] That's why. And she's uniting herself
[2:08:34] with a bridegroom. See, and the
[2:08:36] bridegroom is the word.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] Now, brother Bon goes on
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; it goes on to say here,
[2:08:50] I have to hurry here. We see the ducks
[2:08:53] getting ready. We see the geese getting
[2:08:54] ready. We see the bees bees getting
[2:08:56] ready. We see the clouds getting ready
[2:08:58] for rain. We see everything how it
[2:09:00] unites itself together for it's it's for
[2:09:04] the the excuse me, the push. We see the
[2:09:07] League of Nations together, uniting
[2:09:09] themselves in communism. We see them
[2:09:11] uniting themselves over here in the
[2:09:13] Western world. We see the church uniting
[2:09:15] itself together. So we see the uniting
[2:09:17] of churches with churches.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with the bride.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; The bride is the word.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; And when you unite with the word and I
[2:09:30] unite with the word, we don't have to
[2:09:32] strive to be united together. We are
[2:09:34] united in the same word and in the same
[2:09:36] message
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; and in the same revelation
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; here brother man goes on see it's we see
[2:09:47] the church uniting itself together all
[2:09:49] these others so it's absolutely
[2:09:51] impossible no other time could it be
[2:09:54] this way it couldn't have been this way
[2:09:56] 20 years ago it couldn't be in this way
[2:09:59] couldn't this way 10 years ago it has to
[2:10:01] be right now
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; right See right now
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; because these isms and things hadn't
[2:10:07] come to this place. Brother man
[2:10:09] continues. Unite in time. God uniting
[2:10:11] time. Yes sir. Oh my. Now you remember
[2:10:14] now there is a uniting of the word.
[2:10:16] UNITING BACK AGAIN. BRINGING BACK the
[2:10:18] faith that was once delivered to the
[2:10:19] saints. LISTEN CHURCH. MALACHI 4. We
[2:10:22] started and we receive it.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we just go ahead and give
[2:10:33] God praise for that?
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; We receive it. It's here now. [applause]
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; We are WE ARE WE ARE IN the time of the
[2:10:44] restoration.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; It's time for US TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE
[2:10:49] WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; now God, unite in time. Yes sir. Oh my.
[2:11:03] Now you remember now there is a uniting
[2:11:06] of the word. UNITING BACK AGAIN.
[2:11:08] BRINGING BACK THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE
[2:11:10] delivered to the saints. Bringing back.
[2:11:12] This could only be done in this day. The
[2:11:15] only time it could be done is right now.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Is right now.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham is praying praying
[2:11:26] for it. AND THEN HE'S TELLING THE
[2:11:28] CHURCH, HE'S TELLING THE BRIDE, it is
[2:11:31] happening.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; We are SEEING IT HAPPENING NOW, RIGHT
[2:11:35] NOW.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; And he's pouring himself into you and I.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; All right, let's look at this thing,
[2:11:48] this problem here that we have with
[2:11:51] people thinking that they have a
[2:11:52] different revelation from everybody
[2:11:53] else.
[2:11:57] I'll have a few more minutes so we can
[2:12:00] because it's the same experience. It's
[2:12:01] the same power. But it's when you
[2:12:03] believe you you pray and God give you
[2:12:05] the faith. When you believe it's all
[2:12:07] things are possible them to believe.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; It's it's right here now. God is here to
[2:12:12] give it to you.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; And then brother man tells us this. I
[2:12:16] want to hurry on this one. He said the
[2:12:18] spirit
[2:12:20] and the prophet and the bride will be
[2:12:24] saying
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; the same thing.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; and the prophet
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; and the bride.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like I told the ministers, Jesus
[2:12:41] quoted the prophets.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; As Jeremiah says, as this prophet says,
[2:12:48] as that prophet says, and now if the
[2:12:50] spirit of Jesus come in this age, how
[2:12:52] can he change?
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; And some people's hesitant, well, I
[2:12:59] don't know. I'm not sure. They don't
[2:13:01] have the revelation that he they cannot
[2:13:04] change.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; When you have the revelation that
[2:13:08] brother says that's where Eve failed.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; He says Eve failed on the promise of him
[2:13:14] being the same yesterday, today, and
[2:13:15] forever. Because when the devil came to
[2:13:17] Eve, she should have tell SATAN RIGHT
[2:13:19] AWAY, GOD CANNOT [screaming]
[2:13:21] CHANGE.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE said cannot be altered or
[2:13:24] changed.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:13:28] I'll read this for you. We have time.
[2:13:33] Thank you, my brother.
[2:13:35] Amen.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:13:42] [laughter]
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; And you you don't only see he can't
[2:13:46] change in the Bible. You see he can
[2:13:48] change in you and in others.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Random quotes the
[2:13:59] scripture. This one is going to be a
[2:14:00] little
[2:14:02] little touchy.
[2:14:06] Now, I warn you ahead. This is a little
[2:14:07] touchy.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; But I was I was hesitating to read this
[2:14:12] one.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; But
[2:14:17] read it.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Bring it on.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Listen. The bride would believe
[2:14:22] anything. Everything in the world.
[2:14:25] [clears throat]
[2:14:26] [applause]
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; But some people stumble. Well, well,
[2:14:28] well, well, well, well. It's not well
[2:14:30] well. It's Amen. Amen. AMEN.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; RIGHT, LET'S GO ON HERE.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; TELL US WHAT he said.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; He quotes the scripture.
[2:14:45] Thou has tried them that say they're
[2:14:47] apostles and are not and lies.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; You see, that's why Moses could warn the
[2:14:51] people to stay exactly what he says
[2:14:53] because Moses knew that that word what
[2:14:55] he brought couldn't change.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; The people had to stay with it. It had
[2:14:58] for it to change it has to come to pass.
[2:15:00] That's why Jesus said not one title of
[2:15:01] the law could change. But the Bible says
[2:15:03] when it is fulfilled, it passes.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; But it has to be fulfilled first.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; You all understand?
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; You see, he gave a prophecy, it's
[2:15:11] fulfilled.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; It's like you you were sick, he healed
[2:15:14] you.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; When he healed you, the healing is
[2:15:16] complete.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Then now it's a historic fact.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; You don't understand. It's manifested.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; All right. We won't go into that deep
[2:15:22] because we could take a lot of time on
[2:15:24] that. But let's just read this here for
[2:15:25] you.
[2:15:26] that was tried them that say they're
[2:15:28] apostles and are not and has spong them
[2:15:30] lives. But the man who says my that's a
[2:15:32] blunt statement. That was tried them who
[2:15:34] call themselves apostles. Isn't that
[2:15:36] presumptuous?
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; What right is the people to try those
[2:15:40] who call themselves apostles? How do
[2:15:43] they try them? Oh, I love this. Do you?
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Well, you're quiet on me now.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ferguson, we're not
[2:15:53] supposed to preach like that. You know,
[2:15:55] you have to understand, brother
[2:15:57] Ferguson, we have to have love.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Misunderstanding of love.
[2:16:08] Excuse me, church.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Hear what Paul says here with the love
[2:16:15] of God in his heart. Here it is in Gal
[2:16:16] in Galatians 1:8. Though we or an angel
[2:16:19] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[2:16:21] you than that which we have already
[2:16:23] preached unto you, let him be a curse.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Let him be
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; a cursed.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Who said that?
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Was he wrong?
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Do we believe it?
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; It was the apostles who brought the
[2:16:36] original word to the people. That
[2:16:38] original word could not change.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Not even a dot or dash of it.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Paul knew it was God who had spoken to
[2:16:47] him. So he said even if I come and try
[2:16:51] to give a second revelation to make one
[2:16:54] little change in what I gave originally
[2:16:56] let me be a curse.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; You see Paul knew the first revelation
[2:17:02] was correct.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; God can't give a first revelation then a
[2:17:06] second revelation. If he did he would be
[2:17:08] changing his mind. Yes,
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; he can give a revelation and then add to
[2:17:15] it
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; as he did in the garden of Eden when he
[2:17:18] promised the seed to the woman and then
[2:17:20] later designated the seed had to come
[2:17:22] through Abraham and then later it would
[2:17:23] come through the same bloodlines in
[2:17:25] David but it was the same revelation. So
[2:17:28] what he did is he gave the revelation
[2:17:30] and gave more information on the
[2:17:32] revelation but it is the SAME
[2:17:35] REVELATION. SO WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS age
[2:17:37] is the same revelation he gave to Abel,
[2:17:41] he gave to Abraham, he gave to David, HE
[2:17:44] GAVE TO PAUL. BUT IN this age, he give a
[2:17:47] LITTLE MORE. HE GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE.
[2:17:49] And brother Bame is explaining that now.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we're going to have to
[2:17:53] hurry.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; He gave the people more information to
[2:17:57] help them receive and understand it.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; So you got a little BIT MORE
[2:18:02] INFORMATION. BROTHER BRANDHAM CAME AT
[2:18:04] THE PULPIT. People is thinking he's
[2:18:05] adding. No. If Baram added to the
[2:18:08] scriptures and took away from the
[2:18:09] scriptures, he's a false prophet.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; HE PREACHED THE BIBLE.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; But you have things added, you know, a
[2:18:20] little bit more information to the
[2:18:21] people. And the reason is in order for
[2:18:23] the people to to be able to receive it
[2:18:26] and understand it. BECAUSE IN THIS AGE,
[2:18:28] GOD WILL GIVE US THE UNDERSTANDING OF
[2:18:31] WHAT HE SAID.
[2:18:38] All right, let's go on.
[2:18:43] [clears throat]
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; So, so it only gave the people more
[2:18:48] information to help them receive and
[2:18:50] understand it. But God word can't
[2:18:51] change. The seed came exactly as
[2:18:54] revealed. Hallelujah. And see what those
[2:18:57] false apostles were doing. They came
[2:18:59] with their own word. Those these
[2:19:02] Ephesians knew that word as Paul had
[2:19:05] taught it. THEY WERE FULL OF the Holy
[2:19:07] Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands.
[2:19:09] They look those false apostles in the
[2:19:11] eye and says you are not saying what
[2:19:13] Paul say. You are therefore false.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Today you try to do a thing like that.
[2:19:20] They say you have they said you're
[2:19:22] backing Christian. You have no love of
[2:19:24] God in you. You're judging the people
[2:19:27] and on you're judging the people. You
[2:19:29] see, because they failed to see what God
[2:19:32] is doing.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; They failed to see the identification of
[2:19:36] God in his people. That word cannot
[2:19:40] change.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation in us.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; now let me come to another point.
[2:19:50] Okay? And I know some of these things
[2:19:52] are hard, but I trust
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; you will see it's not George Ferguson.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the word of the Lord.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; You see it because what people are doing
[2:20:02] with God, they're making God as if God
[2:20:04] is a div God is dividing himself against
[2:20:06] himself. There's division in God. How
[2:20:08] could there be division in the God ahead
[2:20:09] of them?
[2:20:12] [clears throat]
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'll go a little deep into
[2:20:15] something that probably trouble you a
[2:20:16] little bit, might probably trouble some
[2:20:17] people a little bit.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Let's take my sitting here and then we
[2:20:23] go to the word just now. I'll read the
[2:20:24] quotes. We'll finish just now. If he is
[2:20:27] puzzled on some things in the me in the
[2:20:29] word of God and I'm puzzled on the same
[2:20:31] things and the Holy Ghost comes and give
[2:20:33] him an understanding and he come and
[2:20:35] give me an understanding of the same
[2:20:36] thing. If it's the Holy Ghost giving him
[2:20:38] an understanding, giving me an
[2:20:39] understanding, it's the same
[2:20:40] understanding.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Can't give him one thing and give me
[2:20:44] something else. Of course, if there's a
[2:20:46] need, he has a specific need. God can
[2:20:49] deal with his specific need. Maybe I
[2:20:51] have a different need to him. God will
[2:20:53] deal with me. But when it is the same
[2:20:54] thing, that's why brother Boo said if he
[2:20:56] take a decision upon anything and he has
[2:20:58] to act, he has to act the same.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; If if he don't then you have a God
[2:21:03] changing and what kind of a God we
[2:21:05] serving?
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Now I want to read this for you.
[2:21:17] Brother Brandham says here
[2:21:20] in the message, "Be not afraid."
[2:21:23] Are you ready?
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not hearing a lot of amens.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Bill, you're not amening your
[2:21:30] friend. It's not me, Brother Bill. It's
[2:21:32] that word. I know you you're in you're
[2:21:34] in it with me. But let's go deeper.
[2:21:37] Brother Bam says, "Now, no, I regard you
[2:21:40] as my
[2:21:42] friend."
[2:21:45] That's wonderful, brother George.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; And my brothers and sisters,
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; I expect to spend eternity with you in
[2:21:53] glory.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; And if you disagree with me on my
[2:21:56] teaching, that's perfectly all right.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; But I believe if you search your Bible,
[2:22:00] right, good, you'll find out it's on the
[2:22:02] mark.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz first the angel of the Lord came to
[2:22:07] me and taught it to me. Then he showed
[2:22:10] me in the Bible where to find it.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:18] [laughter]
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; It's right in the Bible.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost showed that prophet
[2:22:23] where to find in the Bible.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; What did that prophet do? Keep it for
[2:22:27] himself?
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Amen. He received it from God
[2:22:30] and gave it to the bride. Amen.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the prophet and the
[2:22:36] bride will be saying the same thing.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; let's go a little further. Now, this is
[2:22:47] a quote you probably have heard before,
[2:22:49] but I want to read it again for you. I'm
[2:22:50] sure you already did, but I want to read
[2:22:52] it again for you.
[2:22:55] Notice here that Jesus by the spirit in
[2:22:57] every age addresses himself to only one
[2:23:01] person.
[2:23:02] God to the word for that age. Only one
[2:23:05] messenger
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; for each age. We seize what the spirit
[2:23:09] has to say to that age.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; So it's not two and three and four and
[2:23:12] five and six.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be, you know, I'm the
[2:23:16] one. I'm the forget it.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Forget it.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Only one person relative to the word for
[2:23:25] that age. Only one messenger for each
[2:23:27] age receives what the spirit has to say
[2:23:29] to that age. And that one messenger is
[2:23:31] the messenger to the true church. He
[2:23:33] speaks for God by revelation to the
[2:23:35] churches both true and false.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; So even the false church gets it. AND
[2:23:41] SOME OF THEM SAYS IT MEANS I BELIEVE IT.
[2:23:44] But watch the fruits.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; The fruits you're watching is the word.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; But man said the fruits is the word in
[2:23:51] the season. That's the word.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Because you see it's the same thing in
[2:23:55] you. It has to be the same.
[2:23:57] You go right back in the Bible and see
[2:23:59] it goes right back. Now let's hurry
[2:24:00] here.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Let's hurry here.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; And that no he speaks for God by
[2:24:06] revelation to the churches both true and
[2:24:08] false. The message is done broadcast to
[2:24:10] all. That's what we did. We translates
[2:24:12] the message so that the message could be
[2:24:14] broadcast to all. And the biggest
[2:24:16] operation I mean missionary work in the
[2:24:18] world is in the central African
[2:24:19] countries among the French speaking
[2:24:21] countries. We have literally I don't
[2:24:23] know how many over two million believers
[2:24:24] maybe 2.5 million believers of the
[2:24:26] message in the central American in the
[2:24:28] central African and the west African
[2:24:29] countries.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; So it's a lot of them coming in. Amen.
[2:24:32] Especially the French speaking. We won't
[2:24:34] go into that. That puts me in the
[2:24:35] missionary report. Let's hurry back
[2:24:36] here. But though it is broadcast for all
[2:24:38] who come within range of the message
[2:24:40] that message is received individually by
[2:24:43] only a certain qualified group in a
[2:24:45] certain way. So the group receives it a
[2:24:47] qualified group in a certain way. So we
[2:24:50] receive it in a certain way. We won't
[2:24:51] have time tonight to go into that
[2:24:52] certain way, but let's hurry here. Each
[2:24:55] individual of that group is one who has
[2:24:57] the ability to hear what the spirit is
[2:24:59] saying by way of the messenger.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; See, so we're not listening to everybody
[2:25:04] else. He's got an explanation and he's
[2:25:06] got another explanation. He's forget it.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Now we go on to this nice part. This is
[2:25:14] the part I love so much. Those who here
[2:25:17] are not getting their own private
[2:25:19] revelation. I got a revelation that
[2:25:22] nobody else knows.
[2:25:29] [laughter]
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; So those are not getting their own
[2:25:48] private revelation. Nor is a group
[2:25:50] getting their own collective revelation.
[2:25:51] You know I'm the pastor of the church.
[2:25:54] Our church has the revelation but nobody
[2:25:58] else.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; So we say for and no more. [laughter]
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; That's not the message.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Because the revelation has to go back.
[2:26:09] Amen. It's back with Abel. Abel had a
[2:26:12] revelation. Noah had a revelation. Uh
[2:26:14] Moses had a It's the same. It's the same
[2:26:17] God.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's hurry here.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; So nor is a group getting their own
[2:26:26] collective revelation but each person is
[2:26:29] hearing and receiving what the messenger
[2:26:33] has already received from God.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; This is what happened in the time of
[2:26:38] Noah. This is what happened in the time
[2:26:40] of of Moses. This is what happened in
[2:26:42] the time of Jeremiah. The people had to
[2:26:44] receive the word as God sent it to them
[2:26:48] through the messenger of the hour.
[2:26:51] [applause and cheering]
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now this quickly now as
[2:26:56] you receive the revelation as you
[2:26:58] realize as you realize as you receive
[2:27:00] that revelation God gives you the
[2:27:03] revelation the key that opens up all the
[2:27:05] scriptures. Amen. The key that brother
[2:27:08] Brandham used to open up all those
[2:27:10] scriptures. And when you get that key
[2:27:12] YOU'VE GOT IT THAT GOD CANNOT CHANGE.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; THEN YOU could have push him for the
[2:27:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost because you
[2:27:18] know in your heart that he gives me
[2:27:20] power. And the same power he give me IS
[2:27:22] THE SAME POWER JESUS HAD. It's the SAME
[2:27:25] POWER THE APOSTLES HAD.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God help us.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Now this brings us into another
[2:27:33] revelation that we won't have time to go
[2:27:35] into tonight.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; It is the revelation of our position as
[2:27:39] believers,
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; our identification as believers.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached this in
[2:27:44] spiritual amnesia that you could
[2:27:46] identify yourself now back in the
[2:27:48] scriptures. How could you identify
[2:27:50] yourself? You could identify yourself
[2:27:51] with Abel because you could say the same
[2:27:53] faith Abel has, I have. The same
[2:27:56] revelation Abel has, I have. NOW YOU GO
[2:27:58] BACK. YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH NOAH.
[2:28:00] YOU could say, as Bam says, you were
[2:28:02] there. He says when you don't do it, YOU
[2:28:03] HAVE SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. YOU FORGET WHO
[2:28:06] YOU ARE. BUT WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE who you
[2:28:08] are, YOU CAN GO BACK. YOU CAN IDENTIFY
[2:28:10] YOURSELF WITH ALL CHRISTIANS of all ages
[2:28:13] [screaming]
[2:28:14] because he is the same. He cannot
[2:28:17] change. Then you could see yourself.
[2:28:19] AMEN. WHAT GOD WHAT WHAT GOD DID IN
[2:28:22] NOAH. GOD GAVE Noah faith. By faith
[2:28:25] Noah. I can identify myself with NOAH
[2:28:27] BECAUSE WE NOAH and I have the same
[2:28:29] faith. We come from the same father.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. [laughter]
[2:28:34] You see it. We're all the same family.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; You see it now. We're together in this.
[2:28:41] Don't feel separated. You come here
[2:28:43] where you have your face all set up
[2:28:46] already. Your mind is made up. I'm not
[2:28:48] accepted in the group.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; You know why I'm not accepted here? I
[2:28:55] feel as if I'm an outcast and I'm
[2:28:57] different. You don't have a revelation
[2:28:58] that he is the same.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Come to Christ as we walk in the light
[2:29:02] and he is the light. We have fellowship
[2:29:04] one another.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; It happens.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; Here's brother George. Here's brother
[2:29:10] Trev Trevor sitting right here. The word
[2:29:12] is in him. The word is IN HIM. THE WORD
[2:29:14] IS IN ME. WHERE IS THE WHERE IS THE
[2:29:16] DIVISION? IT CANNOT EXIST.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I found brother Brandham saying
[2:29:21] this. I'm hurrying out to finish. When
[2:29:23] Paul says, "Who can separate us from the
[2:29:25] love of Christ?"
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; I always thought it was me separating
[2:29:29] from the love. But brother Brandham went
[2:29:31] deeper. When you have that love of
[2:29:33] Christ and I have that love of Christ,
[2:29:35] nothing could separate us. [cheering]
[2:29:38] [applause]
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; SO WHY WHY ARE WE MEASURING ON THE
[2:29:45] DIFFERENCES? WHY are we measuring the
[2:29:47] differences? The one who is in the in
[2:29:49] the division business separating and
[2:29:51] causing confusion and division. His name
[2:29:53] better call him Lucifer.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; But we are more united because we are
[2:30:01] the same family. BUT IT TAKES A
[2:30:03] REVELATION. AND WHEN GOD GIVES YOU THAT
[2:30:05] REVELATION, you could SEE YOUR
[2:30:07] IDENTIFICATION WITH EVERY CHARACTER OF
[2:30:10] THE SCRIPTURES. AMEN.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; And amen. Oh, let's lift our hands.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Let's give him praise.
[2:30:23] [applause]
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; God bless every one of you.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Wonderful.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[2:30:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. [cheering]
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; And amen. Praise his name.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Glory and praise to our God. Amen.
[2:30:51] Praise his name. God bless you all.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; Were you blessed?
[2:31:07] Not because of me, but because of him.
[2:31:10] [applause]
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; He is wonderful, isn't he? God bless you
[2:31:13] all.
[2:31:18] [applause]

[2:44:03] Father,
[2:44:07] when we look at what you've done in
[2:44:09] [music] our lives, oh God,
[2:44:11] how merciful you've been to us,
[2:44:17] God, we don't deserve any of it.
[2:44:20] But God, your grace has looked past
[2:44:22] every mistake in our life.
[2:44:25] [music]
[2:44:27] Everything that we ever need in this
[2:44:29] life is inside of us [music] already.
[2:44:33] Oh God,
[2:44:36] may we grab hold of your promises for
[2:44:38] this hour.
[2:44:42] And Father, when we fall short, may your
[2:44:43] grace [music] just cover those. May the
[2:44:47] blood of Jesus Christ be our testimony.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; Father, we just want to say thank you,
[2:44:53] Lord.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord,
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; for the honor and privilege of being
[2:44:56] [music] here in this house of worship.
[2:44:59] I pray and I ask you, Father, that every
[2:45:02] person [music] here,
[2:45:05] may they know and come to understand the
[2:45:07] grace of God in their life.
[2:45:10] Father, it's nothing we've ever can do,
[2:45:13] but it's simply what [music] you've
[2:45:15] already done for us.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Calvary
[2:45:20] is where it was all paid for us.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; And tonight, Lord, we say thank you for
[2:45:25] that.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Father, as we leave this place, dear
[2:45:29] God, may we leave knowing respectfully
[2:45:33] and reverently
[2:45:35] of what Jesus Christ did for us in our

[2:46:19] of the uh of the church and so forth. I

[2:46:24] refreshments tonight. Yes. And uh you're
[2:46:28] welcome to be a part of that. And um
[2:46:32] before we go just want to sing one more
[2:46:34] hymn. Let's sing [music] that song.
[2:46:36] Jesus paid it all. All to him I owe. And
[2:46:39] I'll turn it over to him. I hear
[2:46:44] the Savior say,
[2:46:47] "Thy strength
[2:46:50] indeed is small.
[2:46:53] Child of weakness [singing]
[2:46:56] watch and pray.
[2:47:00] Find in thee [singing]
[2:47:02] thy all and all.
[2:47:07] Jesus
[2:47:08] [singing] paid [music] it all.
[2:47:13] All to him I owe.
[2:47:19] Sin
[2:47:21] had [singing and music] left the crimson
[2:47:23] stain.
[2:47:25] He washed
[2:47:28] it white as snow.
[2:47:33] How indeed I find
[2:47:38] thy power
[2:47:40] and thine alone
[2:47:44] can change
[2:47:46] the leper spots.
[2:47:50] am
[2:47:52] the harder. I'm so glad that Jesus
[2:47:59] [singing] paid it all.
[2:48:03] All [singing]
[2:48:05] to him my [music] own.
[2:48:09] Sin
[2:48:11] had [singing and music] left a crimson
[2:48:13] stain.
[2:48:15] He washed it white as snow. Sing that
[2:48:20] one more time. [singing and music] Yes,
[2:48:22] Jesus
[2:48:24] paid it all.
[2:48:28] All [singing]
[2:48:30] to [music] him I
[2:48:34] sin [singing]
[2:48:36] had left a crimson [music] stain.
[2:48:40] He washed
[2:48:43] it white as snow. [singing]
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say it was been good
[2:48:49] to be in the house of the Lord?
[2:48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you so much for coming and
[2:48:54] worshiping with us and trust you were
[2:48:57] encouraged. I was encouraged tonight.
[2:48:59] Amen. You're dismissed. We'll [music]
[2:49:02] keep you flat till the storm passes by.
[2:49:06] Out on the [singing] water,
[2:49:10] the storms raging high.
[2:49:14] The waters [singing] around them were
[2:49:18] troubled [music]
[2:49:19] that night.
[2:49:22] Fear filled their hearts [music]
[2:49:24] [singing]
[2:49:25] and they thought they would die.
[2:49:29] I failed to remember
[2:49:33] that the master was [singing] nigh.
[2:49:37] But he spoke the word
[2:49:40] and the winds all [singing and music]
[2:49:42] stood still.
[2:49:45] Even the waters
[2:49:48] they oyed his will
[2:49:52] and he [singing] calmed their storms
[2:49:56] just like he will mine.
[2:50:00] If I'll [music] just remember [singing]
[2:50:04] that he lives deep inside. [music]
[2:50:08] So why should I worry?
[2:50:12] Why should I fear
[2:50:15] when this [music] very [singing] same
[2:50:17] Jesus,
[2:50:19] he stays always near. [singing]
[2:50:23] He lives in [music] my heart
[2:50:27] and he hears when I cry.
[2:50:31] I call on [music and singing] his name
[2:50:35] till the storm passes by.
[2:50:39] We read in [singing] the Bible
[2:50:43] how he walked [music] with them,
[2:50:46] brought light [singing] to the darkness
[2:50:50] when [music] the way grew so [singing]
