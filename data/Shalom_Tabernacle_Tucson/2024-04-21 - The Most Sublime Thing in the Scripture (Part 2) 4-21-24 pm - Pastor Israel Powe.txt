the Lord Jesus Christ and um I want to greet the pastor and I want also to bring special greetings from our Pastor Dan um he says I should pass greetings to the Saints and it's just wonderful to be at Shalom Tabernacle since the pastor introduced me to this church I just feel that uh always a blessing and the atmosphere and the ministry I haven't agree that the pastor since the beginning of the year I prayed for the job and the lord gave me the job then that job took time for worship so at the Tabernacle they missed me for about three months I wasn't be able to be in service when it's the Sundays when is the Sundays then I said is it the Lord who gave me the job so you start wondering a little bit but here I am and um I texted the pastor because um today we don't have a service at our church and um we had a very wonderful time in the morning we had a visiting minister and the pastor says we are not going to have a service in the evening and right there I said I am going to Shalom tabernac tonight so after the service um I text the Pastor said pastor I'm going to the church that you introduce me to said go and greet them so I text the pastor say Pastor can I sing a song he didn't reply so I came from the service I took the song book because uh there was a song that wanted to sing which is in here so I went with it at home then he didn't reply so after my lunch again I text I said he didn't reply so I said okay so I'll go quietly and then I won't go with a song book I just go quietly so I sat there the brother follows me says brother Jonathan you are singing for us tonight say oh my goodness so the pastor CAU my mystery so we are very grateful to the Lord the song that I want to sing is not a new song and is not a special just a song that blessed me so much to today at the service at the church we we sang this song and I've been singing this song throughout the week is a song that this man lost a family that's how the inspiration Came Upon him he you have read about the tanic that ship and um it sunk and um his family perished in that ship and U the inspiration struck him and instead of crying and instead of complaining to God and instead of worry the inspiration came and he wrote this song which has been a generation song now It Is Well with My Soul there's a Bible story where this lady was prayed for by the prophet and the baby was born and that child grew and then he died and then this lady she runs to the prophet and uh the prophet is trying to wonder what could be the problem he says is there a problem and she says all is well but there is a cop at home a dead baby so there are so many lessons that the song teaches to us and uh as Believers as children of God we are always going through life turbulences each and everyone has got this portion this one is a sickness this one is a financial problems but all we can say it Is Well with My Soul amen so you can sing with me and I didn't know that I have folks from the Tabernacle The Hope

God bless each of you so good to be back in the house of the Lord with you this evening like to welcome our friends from the Tabernacle and all of our visitors and the saints of God Amen and so we want to go right into the word while you're standing in Revelations chapter 5 um the most Sublime act in the scripture where we started this morning the most Sublime act in the scripture it's found in Revelations chapter 5 this great taking of the book then taking of the book he took our sins he paid for our Ransom and he redeemed Us by his blood Amen in verse one and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voiced who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven or in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book how many's glad to know that he's worthy to take the book may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated thank you for the song specials tonight just a real blessing apologize brother Jonathan I didn't have my phone with me you were texting me and no response and it was here at the church that church phone and so but we're so glad to have you folks here and all of the saints that are gathered here tonight amen you love the Lord each of you praise the Lord thank God for his great Mercy to us we spoke this morning on this uh the most Sublime thing or the most Sublime act in the scripture and here we see the lamb taking the book this was redemption's price being paid for you and I this is the most Sublime thing not only in the scripture it's the most Sublime thing in your life is the Lamb taking your sins away we couldn't even come to worship here tonight if there wasn't a bloody lamb we wouldn't be able to even say Amen to the word if there wasn't a bloody lamb we couldn't even have the attitude that we have of praise and worship if there wasn't a lamb he made a way and when Believers see this you don't have to push them to praise the Lord when they understand this when they've actually gone through this it's an experience that you'll tell over and over and over again it never gets old to the one it happens to can tell it early in the morning he can can tell it cold turkey he can tell it on a Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday tell it when he just fell tell it when he's getting up from falling this is a testimony that happens to a Believer it's your testimony every believer has one how many Christians here tonight let me see your hand all right God bless all those hands that are Christians if you're a Christian tonight it's because the lamb took the book book and this is what took place he took your sins and when your those sins were taken away oh the shouts the praise the glory how many's ever how many's ever sang to the Lord just in your truck or your car by yourself it it don't even have to match right it don't even have to rhyme it don't even have to be a song nobody's ever sang before I make up songs all the time because the Lord put the song in my heart and and we all have a song to sing and that song is our testimony it's the song of the redeemed amen oh God yes sir amen the redeemed people have a song they got something to sing about they got something to worship about and this great happening we see it here so in the message the breach brother bam says this in paragraph 200 I'll read it again this evening just to get a background here from the prophet here oh would not it be a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him and he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any of you so you see John was weak weeping the great mature Apostle is weeping one of the elders is now weeping because no one was worthy to take the book but now brother bam tells us that he'll come from Glory tonight if you would move your sinful thoughts aside and he would come from glory and make himself known to any one of you what a tremendous thought to think that Christ doesn't send Mary or one of the Saints he comes himself to the believer He makes himself known to the believer as you repent of your sins and you say Lord Jesus I want you to come into my heart very simple prayer just a few words few mumbling words to some but to us it's the change of our life Lord Jesus would you come into my heart how beautiful is that when he comes down into your little heart there teenage heart 20 year old heart 40 50 year old however old the heart is when you ask him to come he'll come into that heart and he'll leave glory to do so but we also uh uh showed in the scriptures that repentance and this process of repentance is what each believer does as we come to Christ we repent and then we're baptized and I get a witness and after we're baptized we repent we're baptized and then we're candidates to receive the Holy Ghost and after the message tonight if the Lord will the altar will be open you can St at your seat and pray and I really believe with all my heart that we need the Holy Ghost all of us yes we do so this process is um the the repented heart and I said this to the church this morning I can't think of any great thing individual thing that the believer does as becoming a Christian that he'll do for the rest of his life and that is to repent there's nothing more beautiful than to be able to repent and ask God to forgive you of your sins and ask God to bring you back into fellowship and he forgets all about it he washes you white in his Precious Blood and I can't think of anything greater but this process brother random says here in the message if God be for us then where are all the Miracles this is from this morning in paragraph 193 he says if there's any of you God a duct nature we got a great big pool back here so if you can smell if you can get a whiff that God remains God if you got a whiff from Heaven tonight that God keeps his word and he's a miracle working God and you haven't received re the Holy Ghost yet smell the water the first thing he said do certainly repent from the bottom of your heart and lay yourself as a sacrifice on the Altar and you will be consumed of the world and Born Again of the spirit and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost go through the right process not come shake hands with the preacher put your name on the book but die so dead that you don't know the world no more thank you Lord Jesus what a beautiful process so he's dealing with this process of repentance now I just want to go a little bit further into this repentance and how the believer goes into this process of repentance and then we can sometimes lose our way and we do do things that's wrong and when we do things that's wrong we have to make those right and we use this Avenue of repentance because the blood is still on the mercy seat and we're so glad it is that we can come and ask God to forgive us but what happens when we don't ask him to forgive us what happens when we do wrong we know we've done wrong but yet we won't go make it right we call that and brother ram calls it the unconfessed sin and when you find yourself in that lifestyle or in that position in your life people can live for years and months and uh uh uh periods of time where they have this unconfessed sin in their life and how many you appreciate that portion of the tape this morning I played there with a Prophet this Sunday school teacher 30 years old losing her mind trying to find Grace With God trying to to get right with God and she could couldn't be healed and she's taking all of these drugs and pills and so forth brother Brandon prayed for her twice ministers had prayed for her and then finally the answer came through a vision of the Prophet that she had unconfessed sin in her life now that was a GameChanger for her wouldn't you say would you say now she can move on and her husband had to confess the same thing he was the Deacon in the church church so the church is being hindered by this unconfessed sin she's a Sunday school teacher in the same church hindered by this unconfessed sin and this issue is going on but now God's grace because of the lamb and the blood still being on the throne they can make this right now it it might hurt a little bit it might cost you something but at the end of the day at least you're right with God is that right isn't that more important than anything else I just want to be right with God if you got to lose your house if you got to lose your Finance if you got to lose a family member or two or all of your family if you got to lose your freedom and lose your very life you still want to be right with God doesn't matter who like you or who don't like you if you're right with God that's all you need in your life and we as believers that is the most important thing to us numbers in the church or being able to sing or preach the best means doesn't mean nothing to the the believer wants to be right with God at what cost you'll say at all CA we want to do what's right we want to make it right between us and God and not only between us and God between us and one another us and our brother and our sister you leave your gift at the altar if there's an a with you and a brother and then you go to make that right is that what he said that's what Jesus told us and so this confess sin when it's not confessed it's unconfessed sin and then brother vom goes further in that very same testimony right at the end there see if I can take it here real quick he um it's talking about when we neglect to do something that God called us to do and we don't do it we're still on bad terms with God and he's dealing with it in the same channel under the same sub subject of unconfessed sin I'm not gonna be long help me preach for a minute okay in the message do you now believe brother brandom is going on in paragraph 53 this is the end of that quote that we played a little bit of this morning and he says brother Roberts is praying for people the way God told him to do it I'm doing it the way God told me to do it see so it just it's slow I want I want to know what I'm doing and before I condemn a satanic spirit and so forth I want to know first whether that's is God's legal plan it's God as brother bosart says Jesus die for everyone that's right then if you're living in above the reproach and doing right then Satan has to turn loose of you but if there's anything back behind there maybe something that you ought to have done maybe you're living clean and pure but God told you something to do and you neglected to do it and god holds that right on you until you go back and make that thing right again whether it's something you should have done of should or should not have done do you see what I mean oh really that opens it up a little bit more it's not just unconfessed sin it's Disobedience God has showed you what you need to do he's made it clear that you need to do it and you decide you're not going to do it and you think you're gonna get your praise on you're gonna go ahead and study more word you're G to go argue with the other Christians no you got to stop and go do what God told you to do you can't wait worry about what other people are trying to get you to do or pressure you to do when God told you to do something go do it because you want to be found in his grace and favors amen amen so brother manam brings this that way you neglect and in this neglecting God still holds that against you so let's go a little bit further here in the message expectations brother brandom says this here paragraph number 32 1954 I know you love the quotes that's why I read them you know if you all didn't want me to read quotes guess what I do thank you I'mma read them anyway I'm blessed when I read them glory amen I said well that's up to them I don't know but I said you know you never know no matter how much you scream how loud you scream how much you pray that's the that Devil's got a legal right to stay right there and he will stay there too that's right he's got a right to stay there not only that but if you're supposed to have done something and didn't do it he has a legal right of Disobedience so there's what it is combing that person you find out just where that cause is then you know where to start for the Cure see it's unconfessed sin many times so you watch what you say stomping this one out and stomping that one out see that's right see faith will move but not when he's got a legal right Satan knows what his rights is you think he's that dumb he knows when he can get on you and he knows what his rights is and he hasn't and and what he he hasn't got a right to that's right clean yourself up before God come before him pure and holy ask then see and I'll search your life out brother bam continues on this message the church is in in its condition paragraph 160 that's what's the matter with people don't receive the Holy Ghost when they're baptized they just don't thoroughly repent God's trying to give them the Holy Ghost he wants you to be meek and gentle quiet that's the reason you get up with that same selfishness in your heart or you might get up shouting speaking in tongues or or or any that would make you have the Holy Ghost you got to get up from there a different person you got to get up from there gentle quiet Meek and humble God's Spirit dwelling with you next year look back down the trail and see how far You' come see you're gaining ground all the time that's the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is love joy peace longsuffering meekness gentleness patience Faith now just repent and tell God you want that right now be real good brother bam continues on in paragraph number nine in the message the blushing Prophet so brother Adam is dealing with this thoroughly repenting and he's dealing with if you come through that process repent and be baptized at that moment you should receive the Holy Ghost if you're taught properly the word of God is there you understand it your heart is broken and repented right you should receive the Holy Ghost right there he continues on and says this is not an easy easy subject to speak on I could think of many things that were easier to speak on but brother if somebody don't stand out in this sinful adulterous day that we live in and call the colors what's going to happen somebody has got to speak the thing somebody's got to place it before the people perhaps Ezra didn't want to do it but it was in his heart and when you see a servant of God get so sincere till he's on his face with his hands in the air praying to God blessing because of the iniquity of the people then you're going to see a Revival will start a man cannot lay in the presence of God a church cannot stay in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and gives unction and power to start a move of God in there among those people just got to be show me a man show me another Calvin Knox finny sanki or any of those who FS the burden of the people that'll lay on their face and cry and pray before God send us a John Smith of the Baptist Church again who prayed all night for the iniquity of the people until his eyes would be swelled shut the next morning from weeping till his wife would lead him to the table and feed him his breakfast out of a spoon show me a John Wesley again a fire brand snatched from the fire I'll show you a Revival so here brother bam is talking about a church a people a group living under repentance and that's living clean and making your testimony pure before God you know how we get little runin with people and we SN we we snub and this and that we go back and forth and we say little things and we go on and don't make it right and time goes on and time goes on and then the Lord has to really convict us to get us to you know come back back and make the thing right and many times we come to church and even take communion and even go on in church and knowing that these things should be right but if we're living under repentance all the time God's got to honor that I believe he will honor it if this whole group would live under that repentance God will his presence would come and that a church cannot stay in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and gives unction and power that's what he said and so here brother vam brings it even further to us now we have to have something to point to a standard to look up to as Believers we don't just like I was telling the church this morning we don't want to just bring people to repentance and water baptism but nobody receives the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is in there it is is a must it's not optional it's not like how you treat some of you treat the Wednesday night prayer meeting it is a must it is a requirement that every member receive the holy ghost or you're not going in the Rapture that is the truth I have to have the H you have to have the Holy Ghost every believer must have the Holy Ghost we can't preach it too much I think we preach preach it less than we should be we should be preaching it more and presenting it to our young people presenting it to the new converts that you must receive the Holy Ghost it is a must it's there for you it's for the believer and here how brother random says it here in the message um he cares for you 1960 there's only one way that you'll ever be able to receive this wonderful comforter is When You Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ confess your sins repent have Christian baptism administered to you and a promise that God will fill you with the Holy Spirit that's his promise he cannot go back on that it's his promise I've always said if a person was thoroughly taught and was repented from their heart and had believed on God with all that was within them and when they are baptized immediately the holy spirit will come upon them because he's promised to do so he promised it you shall receive the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you I'll go a step further the scripture shows us that even if a man is not even baptized if his heart is right the Holy Ghost will come on that man that's in your Bible how much more those of us who repent and are baptized the Holy Ghost is a must amen and if we're taught properly that's what the standard should be you say well brother Israel we don't see that happened too much that still should be the standard is that right huh I got any Witnesses here tonight when anytime someone comes to get baptized they should receive the Holy Ghost right there amen now so we want to stay under this repentance now this most Sublime act in the scripture we see the lamb coming and taking the book and brother banham shares it with us in the message the breach and we see that in Revelations chapter 5 I want you to turn there with me quickly and we'll see what's taking place here and for the next 15 minutes or 10 minutes or so try to get out here by 6:30 or so 6:30 in somebody's time all right now this book that was in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne it's the Book of Revelations can be intimidating for those who don't know or follow as brother Bram the word of the Lord has been revealed and we don't understand it all but you can read something and get something out of it so it's no excuse for not picking up the book and reading it it's in your Bible it's not just in the preacher's Bible it's in your Bible or the prophet's Bible you have your own Bible and that Revelations 5 is in there and here this great lamb comes out of the midst of the throne and the lion prevailed we see in verse number five says weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed so in the breach paragraph 195 the prophet of God says this here now it's just words until the happening happens to you paragraph 195 notice when he came forth where did he come from it come from the father Strone where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again he raised up and sat on the right hand of God ever living to make intercessions amen raised there today as an intercessor with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people now that's the one I'm pending on he he still was covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sin John looked at the lamb and the lamb looked like he had been slain and then he noticed he was wounded and cut bruised and bleeding a bloody lamb that was that's what took our place isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place he saw the lamb he proceeded out John hadn't saw him because he had been way back in the eternities even making intercession and showing that those who had come to God under the offering of the blood of bulls and of goats and the substitutionary offering cuz them who believed it pointed to him and the blood had not been shed yet so he was there to clear them he was there to clear you and I and oh God I hope he's there tonight for every sinner the lamb been slain how can Jehovah see anything but that Bloody lamb standing there so we see this great event taking place not only in the scripture not only in the message that we listen to In The Prophet's Ministry but also in our very lives the lamb was slain for your sins brother and sister this is why when we conf confess our sins we we enter into where he justifies us and he takes the very sin away from us the Old Testament covered our sins in the New Testament blood it removed our sins so now we stand Justified as Sons and Daughters of God that ought to set any church on fire any heart that can hear that and see that reality in their life it will set their life on fire it will do to you what it did to the elders here in Revelations chapter 5 when they saw this lamb take the book it's a very emotional happening when they saw the lion the Elder said the lion has prevailed don't weep John stop crying stop worrying stop weeping John for the lion has prevailed and he turned to look it was a bloody lamb and that Bloody lamb come out of the eternities and he had blood all over him and then the elders saw him and then John saw him and then the four living creatures saw him and then they begin to Worship the Lord they begin to have a praise service they begin to thank the Lord for the lamb verse number eight in your Bible revelations 58 and when he had taken the book The Four beasts four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps so they got instruments golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song and what did they say Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by the by thy blood out of every Kindred out of the tongue and the people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and priest we shall reain on the earth and behold and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power riches wisdom strength honor and glory and blessing how many come to bless the Lord how many come to say Thank You Lord Lord you're worthy you're the lamb that was slain I'm not worthy but you're worthy they're not worthy but you're worthy I don't know nobody's worthy but you are worthy and you alone receive my praise as much as I love the prophets in the Bible that can't get my praise as much as I love my parents and my pastor or those that I love they cannot get my praise my praise belongs to only one and that is the Lord Jesus Christ I will bow down my knees to the lamb that was slain for he alone was worthy this is in your Bible this was written in the Holy text and we can read it and as we think of it it brings emotion upon us but let's go a little bit further with John when John begins to see this happening in verse number 13 and he says this and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea even in the sea John and all that are there in them heard heard I saying what was John saying blessings honors glories Powers be unto him that sited upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever the four Beast said amen the 420 Elders fell down and worship him that liveth forever and forever what a happening what a beautiful thing the most Sublime thing in the scripture let's read it for you in paragraph 243 in the breach all right he what the prophet of God says you know brother Randon was preaching on this and he starts preaching he says oh my I feel religious that's right then he goes further he says Oho I feel like speaking in tongues like it ain't too many churches he can speak in tongues in anymore but how many how many's ever felt like speaking in tongues Are you ashamed to even say that you might speak in tongues one of these days who me yeah you that's one of the gifts don't get mad at me it's in your Bible huh why we so ashamed of speaking in tongues that make us feel funny huh make us feel nervous make us feel like we're in the wrong church if you do you might be in the wrong church but speaking in tongues don't scare no Believers dancing in the spirit don't scare no Believers you know what they gonna be doing up over there they're going to be doing up there what some of our churches won't let us do down here they going be praying PR in the Lord like they lost their mind like they got saved like they've been delivered like somebody set them free like they've heard the Jubilee trumpet sound and they can go free now Glory hallu won't be no complainers over there won't be no tight feelings over there be praising worshiping glory and honor and thank you Lord and the song of the redeemed amen praise His name amen so paragraph 243 let's take this quickly and then I want to play the first time this Revelations 5 is being broken to the people at the random Tabernacle what effect did it have upon them now we read about it in our text text as words we read about it in our Bible but what does it look like actually happening when the seals are opening it's the lamb that opens the book but you can't have the lamb opening the book without a seventh angel y'all want me to close I know you can't have a lamb open in no book without Revelations 10:7 the Angels got to be here so that the lamb can open the book and when the lamb opens the book you can see your name in there you'll see the Jubilee sound you'll know your day and its message you'll find out this is the seventh Church age and there was a prophet supposed to come and you're in it now amen somebody looking for Elijah's Mantle somebody is fasting for a great thing to happen We're In It praise His name how many thank God for it here what the prophet of God says here yes paragraph 243 oh he's waiting there for me tonight who is that one church that's waiting there what else could wait there for you that Kinsman Redeemer oh my what a Sublime statement or act paragraph number 238 he says it here again notice he's not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne who was it the original the the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no Angelic being nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand who what was it brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture amen an act that no angel no nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne all right so let's go to the let's go back in time to the brandham Tabernacle when the seventh angel is bringing these things to us amen he does this in the message in that message the breach he does it in paragraph number 291 all through the the tape there is very nice but but from paragraph 291 to paragraph 304 want to play just a few minutes brother Brandon opening up this scripture in Revelations chapter 5 we have it there God bless you no one know what to do and John was weeping here come the lamb walked over and this book was in the hands of of the original owner because man had fell and when all creation was groaning when all creation was groaning no one know [Music] what when all creation was groaning no one know what to do and John was weeping here come the lamb walked over and this book was in the hands of of the original owner because man had fail and lost it and no man was able to take it anymore to redeem the Earth no priest Pope Nothing is it said but the lamb come up no Mary no saint this or saint that the lamb come up bloody slam and tck the book out of the right hand of him and set up on the throne and when they seen there was a redeemer and all the the souls under the altar when the Angels when the the elars when the everything seen it when this is done it lays in the future tonight he's a mediator but he's coming to this watch and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints that's those that's of the altar that have prayed for long ago see they have prayed for Redemption prayed for resurrection and here is these Elders are pouring out the prayers before call now we' got a representative we got a Kinsman in heaven that's come forth to make his claims and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to our god watch by thy blood out of every kindered tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall rain on the earth they wanted to come back and here they are going back to be Kings and Priests glory to God I feel good enough to speak in tongues look yes seems like I ain't got enough language I can praise him with it I need one that I don't even know notice and I beheld listen to this and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels listen what a jubilee going on when they seen that lamb come and take that book of redemption the soul screamed out we'll get it all everything the elders fell down they poured out the prayers of the Saints what that was represented a kin for us they fell upon their faces and they sang a song and said Thou Art Worthy or you were slaying watch what and look at these angels and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels around about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000s of thousands notice saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings what a jubilee going on in heaven when that lamb leads leaves that intercessor box that come here to possess his claims you know what I've got next to John he must have saw his name wrote there one them seals broke he must have got real happy this is what he said and every creature which is in heaven and all the Earth and underneath the Earth such are within the sea and all that in them is in them heard me ah saying blessings honor glory power be to him that sets upon the throne and to the lamb forever amen amen amen hallelujah oh and the four be said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that lives forever know talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that land was for see the books even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are say is my name now I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that have been slain from the foundation of amen and he took the book opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his [Applause] people what happened the streams of shout Hall old John been stand brother crying while he said everything in heaven everything in the earth and everything in the Se Me blessings honoring might power be to him that lives forever and ever talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen a pass a curtain of time and said there's John he was so happy said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't everything in heaven everything in the earth everything beneath the Earth every creature everything else heard me saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and power and might riches to him amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise amen how many thank God for the word so what happened let's go over that again the John saw this lamb it comes forth and then everything begins to praise and scream the lamb takes the book and then he brings it to the Earth and he gives it to the Reverend Billy Graham to Reverend Bishop so and so he gives it to the seventh angel so how can I preach Redemption without mentioning the seventh angel how can you do it if I'm not mentioning the seventh angel just know that that is deliberate I'm deliberately doing it because Redemption comes through the blood and the Word was revealed through the seventh angel the messenger so we thank God for it if I'm not mentioning it know that that's deliberate but we're so glad to mention the seventh angel because the seventh angel is the one who revealed the Seven Seals and in those seals that's where we can see our name don't you love the Lord the most Sublime thing in the scripture you seeing your name John seeing his name brother B said John must have saw his name in there and he got happy when you see your name in there you'll get happy too I'm so glad I can see my name my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world and we thank God for it amen God bless you so much we trust the Lord will carry you through Psalm 68118 Psalm 66 Verse 18 says if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me but I'm so glad that the Lord can pardon our iniquity and our transgressions and this takes place because the lamb took the book Hebrews 6:12 says that their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more how is it that he won't remember them anymore because the lamb took the book Hebrews 101 1-1 17 says this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more how many you know how many want God to forget your sins your iniquities your transgressions remember he can't forget your sins by your good works he forgets your sins through the blood that was shed at the cross and when you confess those sins in the bleach of the blood it is as though you never did it in the first place it say what sin are you talking about I've redeemed you thank you Lord this is the most Sublime thing not only in the scripture my personal testimony it's the most Sublime thing in my life when the lamb took my sins away amen Romans 4 1-8 what shall I say then that Abraham our father but turning to the flesh hath found he says now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and those whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin now that has to take place through the blood of the Cross Colossians 2:13 our brother mentioned it in his song I believe it says and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it where nailing it to his cross he took all of our sins and he nailed it to his cross James 51315 is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any marry let him sing songs is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall do what shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he's committed sins they shall be forgiven him first John 1 18-10 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness everybody say all all unrighteousness not most of it not the big ones not just the little ones but all of them he's able to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US 1 John 2:12 I write unto you little children because your sins are are forgiven you for his name's sake how many thank the Lord for that how many thank God for your sins being forgiven how many of your sins are forgiven all of them he took my sins and he washed them all away and there's no more sins against us blessed is the man that God will not impute any iniquity because we've confessed them in the preci prous blood of the Lord Jesus Christ now we can receive the Holy Ghost and every promise that he has for us how many believe that tonight oh we love the lamb don't we oh we worship the lamb don't we he made a way for us it's not just the most Sublime thing in the scripture it's the most Sublime thing in all human history the most Sublime thing in any writing or anybody's life more importantly in your life that the lamb would take your sins away and not just take them away you can live a life under this repentance under the blood and have him blessing you every day of your life and we trust in believe that's what the bride is doing we thank God that he sent this great message in our day that's loose these things to the bride and we're glad about it amen what is Iniquity iniquity is to know to do right and do it anyway continue going on in your iniquity but we are those that hear the truth and will make the change that we need to that we need to make is that right disobedience is there the same iniquity unconfessed sin all those things can be dealt with and are dealt with with the lamb so tonight if you haven't received the Holy Ghost I want you to take your time and dedicate your life and rededicate what you're doing what the lamb has done for you revalue your repentance and see if you have thoroughly repented and if you have not thoroughly repented Lord help me to thoroughly repent so I can receive the Holy Ghost remember after you receive the Holy Ghost precious Holy Ghost comes in you and dwells in that human being but then now the Holy Spirit now does a work in you and he starts to take out other things in your life so that you can grow in his grace and mercy into the stature of a perfect man so the holy spirit is constantly working in that believer's life it starts and continues with repentance if you ever get to the place where you feel like you have nothing to repent about then repent for thinking that thought because Paul said I di daily when this sticky nature and the is the issues of life our laziness our um jadedness our you know lack of concern and if we ain't preaching then we can't say Amen if we're not singing We Can't be involved if we're not on the the mic in our hand we can't be excited you know you got to get rid of all of that you got to get rid of all of that and just work and serve the Lord You're not come in here to be seen by a group of people you're coming here to Worship the Lord L who was worthy of all the praise the glory and the honor amen don't you love him

them and then even moved it Forward even till 2024 your blood was shed for us so that we can come into your presence Lord and I pray oh God that this act of redemption will be a reality to our hearts
