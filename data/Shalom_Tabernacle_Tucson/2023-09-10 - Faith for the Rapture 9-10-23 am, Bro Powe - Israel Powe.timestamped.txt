[1:35] because thou has hid these things from
[1:37] the wise and The Prudent and has
[1:40] revealed them unto babes even so far

[3:25] seated brother Branham
[3:27] and they said that Moses never cross
[3:30] actually the Red Sea that it was a a
[3:33] bunch of reeds down there a sea of reeds
[3:36] and he brought the children of Israel
[3:37] through this sea of reeds up at the end
[3:39] of the the sea there's a big bunch of
[3:41] reeds up there and Moses crossed the sea
[3:44] but it was the Sea of reeds that he
[3:46] crossed you know grass tall like
[3:48] thuleles and things that he crossed
[3:50] through that Howry thickness when the
[3:52] water the Bible says departed from right
[3:55] so they think God calls a mighty East
[3:58] Wind to separate
[4:00] [Music]
[4:02] they want to try to figure it out in
[4:04] their own way and that's why they've
[4:07] always failed and they'll continue to
[4:09] fail you know all these things that came
[4:13] or the very type of the carnal-minded
[4:16] man today who's religious uh outwardly
[4:19] he wants to do something outwardly but
[4:22] he's uh he goes to church and and you'll
[4:25] do lots of things for the the building
[4:27] there's only one church and you don't
[4:30] join that these are lodges see you
[4:33] joined the Methodist Lodge the Baptist
[4:35] Lodge the Presbyterian Lodge the
[4:37] Pentecostal Lodge but you're born into
[4:40] the church
[4:42] these all are lodges they're not
[4:44] churches they're lodges no such a thing
[4:46] as Methodist Church our Pentecostal
[4:48] Church no there isn't such a thing no
[4:51] that's all wrong see there that's right
[4:53] there are lodges that people join but
[4:56] you're born into the Church of the
[4:57] Living God and that's the Mystic body of
[5:00] Jesus Christ amen the form now
[5:03] but it pleased God to reveal his secret
[5:09] to Abel by simple faith in the shed
[5:13] blood oh I wish I had time to lay on
[5:15] that alone
[5:16] see yet it came with all this wisdom the
[5:20] smart man oh you say now brother Branham
[5:22] you said you're trying to make him the
[5:24] educated genius he was
[5:26] he was a smart followers Far East strain
[5:28] look at his children every one of them
[5:30] were scientists and doctors and smart
[5:32] man everyone but you follow the
[5:35] generation of saith they were humble
[5:39] peasants and farmers and so forth on
[5:42] down to the destruction
[5:44] but Kane's children were the smart
[5:46] intellectual group they even uh they
[5:49] could claim to temper copper and they
[5:51] make Medals and Builders and they were
[5:53] smart man when when these other menus go
[5:55] out intense and hurt their sheep and
[5:57] rested upon the promises of God Amen see
[6:00] where it was now just follow the
[6:02] genologist
[6:04] they rested upon the promise of God
[6:07] that's how Noah was chosen that kind of
[6:10] a people that's how uh Paul was taken
[6:13] out from his flock see that's how John
[6:15] Wesley Martin Luther what more that's
[6:18] how you come to be what you are today
[6:20] the same thing humble to believe the
[6:23] simple promise of God now notice it
[6:27] pleased God to to identify now God
[6:31] always will a vindicate whether it's the
[6:34] truth or not
[6:36] now many people try to ask themselves
[6:39] into something that God Saves a million
[6:40] miles from that's right but when you see
[6:43] God come back around say it's punctuated
[6:45] says right that's right
[6:48] that's right then you know that's true
[6:50] now when the offerings is on the altar
[6:52] God refused his intellectual conception
[6:56] of God
[6:57] but when he's seen Abel by simple Faith
[7:00] to believe that it was not apples or
[7:03] fruits of the field but it was blood by
[7:07] faith he believed it by Revelation from
[7:09] God God of indicated Adam by accepting
[7:13] his sacrifice
[7:15] that's where we think of praying for the
[7:17] sick anything else Jesus said if you
[7:19] abide in me in my word and you just ask
[7:21] what you will
[7:22] that shall be done to you now as we're
[7:25] coming right on down fastly now for 20
[7:28] minutes more notice
[7:29] Elijah's day
[7:31] God chose to hide himself in a simple
[7:35] person
[7:37] now just think of it
[7:40] God chose that was his choosing remember
[7:43] they had rabbis priests they had great
[7:46] man in them days even King Ahab himself
[7:50] was a Jew
[7:51] he had great man in the land in that day
[7:53] but God
[7:55] hid himself in a simple man not a
[7:59] scholar
[8:01] no
[8:02] not only noun man of the world some
[8:05] great military genius or something no
[8:08] no big name we don't even know who he's
[8:11] popping mama was we don't know anything
[8:13] about his genealogy just a plain old
[8:16] farmer somewhere that was raised up for
[8:19] the purpose to be a prophet God had him
[8:22] living to himself in the wilderness only
[8:24] thing we know he stomped right out of
[8:27] nowhere
[8:28] walked right in and condemned the whole
[8:31] ecclesiastical system
[8:33] my
[8:34] and you know what they thought about him
[8:36] what school did he come from
[8:40] what denomination is he with is he with
[8:43] the Pharisees the Sadducees or what more
[8:46] they had he didn't belong to any of them
[8:49] but he condemned the whole thing
[8:53] God chose to do that but a simple man no
[8:56] education we had no place where he ever
[8:59] went to school we had nothing about him
[9:01] just a simple man but God was pleased to
[9:05] hide in that simple person
[9:08] God back there with this simple man
[9:11] hiding in a human being
[9:15] can you grasp it
[9:17] God hiding in a illiterate
[9:22] crank
[9:24] to the world
[9:27] because you know they they accused him
[9:29] of everything even being a witch
[9:32] Elijah all prophets are accused that so
[9:35] Jesus excuse me
[9:37] be Elizabeth be crazy said well you're
[9:40] mad we know you got a devil you're off
[9:42] at your head see
[9:44] that's where he told him when it come to
[9:47] the last days that the bless that'd be
[9:49] blasphy to do such he forgave him but it
[9:51] wouldn't be forgiven in these last days
[9:53] it had to be faithful
[9:55] with eternal separation never to be
[9:58] forgiven in this world of the world to
[10:00] come but Elijah was considered a crazy
[10:03] man could you imagine standing up to the
[10:06] the women was all cutting your hair like
[10:09] the modern days I guess and painting up
[10:12] like Jezebel the first lady of the land
[10:14] and and the preachers all gone worldly
[10:17] and everything and then what taking
[10:19] place then here come the old Elijah
[10:22] condemning the whole thing all the way
[10:24] from Jezebel down
[10:27] I thought that we don't have to listen
[10:28] to you but
[10:29] we can sure they didn't ask you but he
[10:31] wasn't a pastor anyhow
[10:33] and Jezebel's Pastor she didn't she
[10:35] might have had a different kind but but
[10:37] God said he was
[10:41] God sent Pastor for her she hated him
[10:44] but he was pastured just the same
[10:47] notice and Elijah humbled himself and
[10:51] stayed with what God Said in such a way
[10:54] that it pleased God to take that same
[10:57] Spirit from Elijah and promise to shove
[11:00] it three times down the road from that
[11:01] man
[11:08] he promised it that it would come and to
[11:12] come up on Elisha his successor that
[11:14] come on John the Baptist according to
[11:16] Malachi 4 Sports to be here again in the
[11:18] last days
[11:20] God loved that spirit that was up on
[11:23] that simple uneducated Woodsman from
[11:26] back there in the woods somewhere and so
[11:29] it was so obedient to his word that he
[11:32] could say Elijah do this and Elijah
[11:33] would do it and God hid himself in their
[11:37] sub-simplicity they all told him that
[11:39] old crank don't have nothing to do with
[11:40] him and so forth but one day when he got
[11:44] old and his head Paul in his in his
[11:47] Whiskers hanging down grave what few
[11:49] heirs he had hanging over his shoulders
[11:51] little skinny arms and the meat flopping
[11:54] on him like that come walking down that
[11:57] road to Samaria in my eyes look it up
[11:59] towards the skies with a crooked stick
[12:01] in his hand he wasn't very much to look
[12:03] at but he had thus saith the Lord
[12:06] [Music]
[12:09] he didn't stand her with it
[12:12] were you stutter he didn't say now great
[12:13] Ahab he woke up said not even the Dew
[12:16] will fall from Heaven till I call for
[12:18] you
[12:21] all right
[12:23] God had honored his Simplicity and I see
[12:26] while it was in the simple way and
[12:28] everybody made everybody against him
[12:31] everybody was at his throat all the
[12:33] Ministerial Association everything else
[12:34] was at his stroke that's true trying to
[12:37] get rid of him and everything else but
[12:39] in that Simplicity even though they had
[12:42] no cooperation with these campaigns and
[12:44] whatever more he had everybody thought
[12:46] he was a crank God was hiding himself
[12:50] but when it comes time for that seed to
[12:53] get right that had been planted God
[12:55] manifested himself by sending fire out
[12:58] of heaven
[13:02] Lord God hiding in Simplicity
[13:06] himself again
[13:08] sure
[13:10] it pleased God to do that he's always
[13:13] hidden in such a way that's syrup now we
[13:17] find out that he he promised these
[13:19] things yes uh the trouble is today was
[13:22] so many of us people we want to get so
[13:26] uh you know so Seminary and
[13:29] denominational educated mind is that God
[13:32] can't use it
[13:34] God can give a man a start
[13:37] to do something and uh give him a
[13:40] Ministry the first thing you know you'll
[13:43] go to catering to what others say
[13:45] and the first thing you know you'll be
[13:47] all wrapped up in a big bunch of stuff
[13:49] and then God just takes his hands off of
[13:51] him let him alone
[13:53] see Nanny will try to find him another
[13:55] man somebody that will do it see he's
[13:58] got to find something else we'll we'll
[14:00] take his word we'll take the divine
[14:02] revelation and won't move with it but
[14:05] stay right there on that word that's
[14:07] what he he does it he's always done it
[14:09] that way so when man gets so educated
[14:12] and smart that he tries to put his own
[14:13] interpretation well like to say uh the
[14:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll say oh
[14:19] that was for another day but if they
[14:21] don't well it wasn't for another day but
[14:22] I'll tell you it don't come just like it
[14:24] did on the day of Pentecost we receive
[14:25] the Holy Ghost when we believe in and
[14:27] all kinds of stuff like that you see and
[14:29] talk about the baptism in the name of
[14:31] Jesus Christ they where the Bible
[14:33] teaches that we will say well but the
[14:35] Seminary says and so and so says that's
[14:37] compromising
[14:41] he may let a man be beat all across the
[14:44] country like that and the Man cast out
[14:46] and laughed at and made fun of and
[14:48] everything else like that but when the
[14:50] real Showdown come God stands up and
[14:52] vindicates himself
[14:53] [Music]
[14:55] why is that affect the flower the seed
[14:58] looks like it's over with it dies and
[15:00] falls into the ground dig the little
[15:01] seed up button it looks like a mess but
[15:04] out of their Springs life to reproduce
[15:06] another Power again God is Simplicity he
[15:10] does the same thing the Way Up Is Down
[15:13] always humble yourselves don't never say
[15:16] well I got this and that you ain't got
[15:17] nothing just remember if you got the
[15:20] grace of God just be thankful for it
[15:23] is keep humble yourself
[15:26] now I'll move after her because the
[15:28] clocks I don't want to keep you too long
[15:30] cause don't wear you out see we got a
[15:33] long time here through this week now and
[15:37] now we find out that people get so smart
[15:39] and educated now I want to show you
[15:40] another the others go so far to the
[15:44] other side they become Fanatics trying
[15:46] to be religious
[15:48] now we know we have that group amen they
[15:51] go up the other side that's where I
[15:53] differ with a group of Brethren that
[15:55] pulled off here not long ago from the
[15:57] The Way of Light they they just couldn't
[16:00] see the phenomena being done unless they
[16:02] made themselves a group so they gathered
[16:03] up in Canada and made a group of people
[16:06] that they was going to give out make
[16:07] Apostles and Prophets out of one another
[16:09] and things then it fell right through
[16:10] see
[16:11] and it always will yeah they come they
[16:15] feel that the cause that they are that
[16:17] they don't they so condemn the other
[16:20] things and and the things do they go
[16:22] Plum on the other side
[16:24] see this one side this highly
[16:26] intellectual cold and in different they
[16:30] deny everything there and the others get
[16:33] on the other side on the other side of
[16:35] the radical bunch of an emotion and deny
[16:37] the word
[16:39] but the real true church stays right in
[16:41] the middle of the road
[16:43] now if you notice it's it's it's got the
[16:47] Bible knowledge of what God Said and
[16:51] it's it's spiritual enough to be warm in
[16:53] its heart and it's just the road Isaiah
[16:55] said it would be that way he said there
[16:58] shall be a highway and a blessed holy
[17:02] precious Friends of the nazarene's
[17:04] church a mighty little move that God
[17:06] started up but what did they get when
[17:09] God began to speak with tongues in the
[17:11] church they were so religiously and so
[17:13] self-starch that they call it the devil
[17:16] and you see what happened to him amen
[17:18] and
[17:22] um and so we find out that all those
[17:24] things goes to seed and dies right out
[17:26] Amen to the other side now one side
[17:30] becomes a fanatic the other side becomes
[17:32] cold and starchy now Isaiah said there
[17:35] shall be a highway
[17:37] and the nazarenes and many of the old
[17:39] Holiness people you say the Blessed Old
[17:41] Highway glory to God we're walking up
[17:44] the old highway but you remember that
[17:46] wasn't exactly what he said
[17:47] he said there shall be a highway and and
[17:52] is a conjunction
[17:53] and a way
[17:58] and it shall not be called The Highway
[18:00] of Holiness but the way of holy now on
[18:04] the highway of holies people try to make
[18:06] themselves holy and when you do it's
[18:09] just like I've said before it's like a
[18:10] it would be like a buzzer trying to put
[18:13] Dove feathers in himself to make a dove
[18:15] out of it when his nature is still a
[18:17] buzzard
[18:19] it'd be like a cruel trying to put a a
[18:22] pigeon's feathers in or a peacock and
[18:24] saying you see I'm a beautiful bird see
[18:27] it's something manufactured
[18:29] but a peacock don't have to worry
[18:31] whether he's going to have peacock
[18:33] feathers or not the dog don't have to
[18:35] worry whether he's going to have Dove
[18:37] feathers or not as long as his nature is
[18:39] a dove he'll have Dove feathers
[18:42] and see the Holiness people and again
[18:44] they'll say the women must wear long
[18:46] hair and long sleeves and and all these
[18:48] things and long skirts and not wear any
[18:50] wedding rings or jewelry of anything I
[18:52] see it become a self-righteous Holiness
[18:55] see
[18:56] see that that's that's manufactured
[18:59] holiness but the real Church of the
[19:02] Living God is look what's happened to
[19:05] the denomination now they've all got cut
[19:07] hair like the Pentecostals and and so
[19:09] forth and and they all really wear rings
[19:11] and so forth look at the Pentecostals
[19:13] years ago how they harped on that see
[19:16] and we the church we the church the
[19:19] church is Christ's body it's an
[19:23] individual amongst other individuals
[19:25] that is born in the kingdom of God
[19:28] that comes from the inside out it's
[19:31] automatically lived you don't ask the
[19:34] Sheep to Bear wool or a manufacture wool
[19:36] I mean a sheep don't have to manufacture
[19:39] wool you say now my master wants me to
[19:42] have some more this year I got to get
[19:43] busy and all the only thing he has to do
[19:45] is just remain a sheep that's right the
[19:48] war will actual article it will um it
[19:52] will he will bear it because and we're
[19:54] not asked to manufacture fruits
[19:57] we're supposed to produce fruits their
[20:01] fruits see we are supposed to bear fruit
[20:04] and as long as you are a fruit tree of
[20:07] God with God's word God's word will
[20:10] vindicate itself it'll bear fruit as
[20:12] long as the words in there Jesus said if
[20:14] ye abide me in my word in you that's
[20:17] what you will and it shall be done amen
[20:21] you don't manufacture to work yourself
[20:23] not up to it's just actually there and
[20:26] it goes on and on now
[20:27] let's go just hurrying up now with just
[20:30] a few minutes left and then we'll close
[20:32] down now others go so far as to be
[20:36] fanatics
[20:37] now they go on the other side and they
[20:40] think it's because if they jump up and
[20:42] down or get some kind of a sensation or
[20:44] emotion speak with tongues or or or give
[20:48] a prophecy that happened to be right or
[20:49] something like that they think that's it
[20:51] they got it but it isn't
[20:54] Jesus said many will come to me in that
[20:56] day and say Lord have not I prophesied
[20:58] your name your name done many works the
[21:01] cast out Devils he said depart I never
[21:03] knew you see that isn't it that isn't it
[21:06] friend that's the reason that tongues
[21:09] evidence I'm not even speaking in
[21:10] tongues but I don't think it'd be the
[21:12] only evidence of the Holy Spirit no sir
[21:14] the fruit of the spirit amen and now you
[21:18] see that's the reason I have different
[21:19] with the move of the Pentecostal
[21:21] brethren in that manner that they say is
[21:23] of a man speaks as long as he has the
[21:25] Holy Ghost how different that's no sign
[21:27] he's got the Holy Ghost I've heard they
[21:29] will speak with him just as fast they
[21:30] could drink blood out of a human skull
[21:32] and call on the devil I see Indians take
[21:35] snakes wrap around them and the rain
[21:37] dance out there in Arizona hold their
[21:39] hands up I can't run right around the
[21:40] witch doctor come out laying sitting
[21:41] myself and flee a pencil down right now
[21:44] no one comes and give the interpretation
[21:45] see so don't don't tell me that happens
[21:47] I'm too old for that see so the the
[21:51] fruit of the spirit is if Jesus said buy
[21:54] their fruits not tongues or emotions but
[21:56] buy their fruits
[21:58] well that is the fruit of the spirit
[22:00] it's God unfolding himself in humility
[22:04] sweetness and every day the same it's
[22:08] something about it a man that stays
[22:10] right with the word every time that he
[22:12] sees the word he punctuates you with an
[22:13] amen no matter what the other people say
[22:15] that he believes it's just a man all
[22:17] right see but we go far enough then to
[22:20] rest upon a fanatical and Satan gets
[22:23] amongst the people that's Satan's
[22:25] business and he's a good businessman and
[22:27] he gets amongst people make them think
[22:29] that they got it it's because they can
[22:31] jump up and down and then hate your
[22:32] neighbor
[22:33] no see yeah the same things and speak in
[22:37] tongues just wonderfully and things like
[22:40] that and remember you can speak in
[22:41] genuine Holy Ghost tongues and still not
[22:44] have the Holy Ghost
[22:45] the Bible says so the law speak with
[22:48] tongue of man and Angel and have not
[22:50] shared yet Prophet me nothing I'm become
[22:51] as a sound embracement amen First
[22:54] Corinthians 13. so you don't that don't
[22:56] do it see the Methodist said when we
[22:58] shouted we had it but they didn't and as
[23:01] we said when they lived holy they had it
[23:03] but they didn't the Pentecost is that we
[23:05] speak in tongues we got it but they
[23:06] didn't
[23:07] see God unfolding himself not the
[23:10] sensations no Sensations yets with it
[23:13] you see the place it just gets us so
[23:15] humble to anybody can see it if you if
[23:18] you don't try to inject your own mind to
[23:20] it see your own thoughts it's God now
[23:24] and then they become a bunch of Fanatics
[23:26] then here's the cold formals on this
[23:28] side here's the Fanatics on the other
[23:29] side and your goals the bride right
[23:31] straight through it all right
[23:34] God vindicating it as he goes along his
[23:37] word

[32:21] let's stand together brother George when
[32:22] you come open our service with a word of
[32:24] prayer this morning
[32:25] [Music]
[32:32] it's good to be in the house the Lord
[32:34] this morning
[32:35] let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father
[32:38] oh it's our privilege to be here today
[32:40] Lord and the Lord we're just so grateful
[32:43] to have this place to gather Lord we're
[32:45] so grateful to have brothers and sisters
[32:48] of light precious Faith to gather with
[32:50] and Lord it's an honor to be here but
[32:53] Lord we most importantly want to invite
[32:56] you to come Lord and we invite your
[32:59] presence Among Us father we ask oh God
[33:02] that you would just sanctify us today
[33:04] Lord forgive us of our sins and our
[33:06] shortcomings Lord and father we just ask
[33:09] that our Praises be pleasing to you Lord

[33:23] ask you to meet with us now we pray in
[33:26] Jesus name amen and amen
[33:30] let's just remain standing for a little
[33:31] bit sure good to be back with everybody
[33:33] it's joy and I and Tim and Emma were
[33:36] gone out of town last weekend and
[33:39] we had a chance to listen to
[33:43] one of the services from the special
[33:45] meetings up in Mesa and
[33:47] a chance after the fact to also listen
[33:49] to last Sunday's
[33:51] service that brother Israel brought but
[33:54] you know there was absolutely nothing we
[33:56] could do when we were listening to those
[33:57] that could change the atmosphere the
[34:00] outcome of those services
[34:01] so it was nice to be able to have and to
[34:04] get caught up on what what you guys had
[34:06] heard but we could we could shout all we
[34:09] want it wouldn't have made any
[34:10] difference may have helped our spirit
[34:12] but didn't affect your service and
[34:14] we have the opportunity now yes
[34:17] take advantage of the time that the
[34:19] Lord's given us today and everyone
[34:20] that's here is playing a part you won't
[34:22] leave here like you came
[34:24] so you leave it leave closer to him or
[34:27] further away and I don't think any of us
[34:30] want to leave
[34:31] further away from God than we are right
[34:33] now but let's not waste our time let's
[34:36] not play church today come with an
[34:38] expectation
[34:39] and just looking around on Wednesday
[34:40] night it was so good to be in the house
[34:42] of the Lord and you know just the end of
[34:44] the service
[34:46] thinking about some of those that paid
[34:47] the greatest sacrifice got the biggest
[34:49] blessing
[34:51] and will and Lindsay and
[34:54] they travel a long way to come here on
[34:56] Wednesday night the galantes could
[34:58] travel along a long ways and they didn't
[35:00] want to drive two hours and just be
[35:03] another service and and it wasn't sister
[35:05] Elise was blessed and just she always
[35:08] comes What Can I Do Lord
[35:12] it's not my father not my brother but
[35:14] it's me O Lord amen but we also we are
[35:18] here to be a help to each other and we
[35:20] create the atmosphere around us and
[35:22] let's just see what we can do to be an
[35:25] encouragement to someone around us today
[35:27] amens just drive the devil out of here

[37:19] Lord for the wonderful musicians he's

[50:48] kids coming up um my son and sister
[50:50] Amelia some of the older ones um just

[1:16:31] first Thessalonians
[1:16:34] before we go to Thessalonians we'll take

[1:17:01] I'll read the first verse and the class
[1:17:03] will
[1:17:04] alternate with me
[1:17:06] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[1:17:10] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[1:17:12] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:17:15] afraid
[1:17:20] are you
[1:17:24] the whole shouldn't Camp against me my
[1:17:27] heart shall not fear the war should rise
[1:17:30] against me and this will I be confident
[1:17:48] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:17:51] me in this Pavilion and the secret of
[1:17:54] his Tabernacle surely hide me he shall
[1:17:57] set me up upon a rock
[1:18:02] of my enemies
[1:18:12] to the Lord hear O Lord when I cry with
[1:18:16] my voice have mercy also upon me and
[1:18:20] answer me

[1:18:31] put not thy servant away in Anger thou
[1:18:34] has been my help leave me not neither
[1:18:37] forsake me o God of my salvation
[1:18:47] teach me thy way O Lord lead me in a
[1:18:50] plane path because of my enemies
[1:19:04] I would have fainted
[1:19:06] unless I had believed to see the
[1:19:09] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:19:12] living
[1:19:13] wait on the Lord we have good courage
[1:19:16] and he shall strengthen thine heart wait
[1:19:19] I say on the Lord
[1:19:22] how many is willing to wait on the Lord
[1:19:25] if you wait on him he'll strengthen your
[1:19:28] heart amen first in second Thessalonians
[1:19:31] we'd like to take a scripture here
[1:19:38] first Thessalonians chapter four pardon
[1:19:41] me
[1:19:59] verses number
[1:20:02] 13.
[1:20:04] he said but I would not have you to be
[1:20:06] ignorant
[1:20:08] Brethren concerning them which are
[1:20:11] asleep
[1:20:13] that ye sorrow not even as others which
[1:20:15] have no hope for if we believe that
[1:20:18] Jesus died and rose again even so them
[1:20:22] also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[1:20:25] with him
[1:20:26] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:20:29] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:20:32] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:20:35] not prevent them which are asleep
[1:20:38] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:20:41] heaven with the Shout with the voice of
[1:20:43] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[1:20:46] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:20:50] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:20:53] be caught up together with them in the
[1:20:56] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:20:59] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:21:02] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[1:21:06] words how many find comfort in these
[1:21:08] words amen is certainly greed each of
[1:21:11] you will greet the Saints there in
[1:21:12] Phoenix the little group there that's
[1:21:14] gathered God bless the Ember the art and
[1:21:17] the Saints there and each of you a man a
[1:21:20] little message here this morning faith
[1:21:22] for the rapture the title of the message
[1:21:25] this morning faith for the Rapture God
[1:21:29] bless you can be seated
[1:21:31] this great word the Rapture or the
[1:21:34] catching away as your Bible doesn't have
[1:21:36] at least the King James version doesn't
[1:21:38] have the word rapture in it but we use
[1:21:41] that word because it expresses
[1:21:44] uh what the great catching away is
[1:21:48] and so we know that with anything you
[1:21:52] have to have a motive and an objective
[1:21:55] and a motive is the reason why something
[1:21:59] is doing what is doing
[1:22:02] the objective is the object that it is
[1:22:07] moving towards and so as brother Branham
[1:22:11] tells us when you have a question about
[1:22:13] things
[1:22:14] you always want to look at your motives
[1:22:16] and your objectives amen and so God has
[1:22:20] a motive and an objective
[1:22:22] and so does Satan
[1:22:25] and the whole purpose of us being here
[1:22:28] is uh to play out the motive in the
[1:22:32] objective that God has for us amen
[1:22:35] and we've been talking a bit on this
[1:22:39] third pool last Sunday we brought in
[1:22:42] this little widow woman that gave
[1:22:46] a few pennies in the offering it looked
[1:22:49] real simple it was very simple
[1:22:52] it's probably something she did before
[1:22:54] and sometimes we're looking for God to
[1:22:57] speak to us in some way that's an angel
[1:23:00] coming down or the lights flashing but
[1:23:04] God hides in Simplicity
[1:23:06] he hides in the shadows he hides behind
[1:23:10] the scene to get his message across he's
[1:23:14] a very
[1:23:15] um it's very interesting the more you
[1:23:18] know about him the more you realize you
[1:23:20] don't know and you just want to know
[1:23:22] more about him he's very secretive but
[1:23:25] yet he's very open he's the greatest
[1:23:28] King greatest leader but he knows how to
[1:23:31] follow too
[1:23:32] when he came in flesh he submitted and
[1:23:36] humbled himself and this is part of the
[1:23:39] greatness he being so great and so pure
[1:23:42] and so holy can actually humble himself
[1:23:46] and be robed in a sinful nasty sticky
[1:23:51] flesh with all the filthy desires that
[1:23:55] come with that he humbled himself to
[1:23:58] come to the Cross that's what makes him
[1:24:00] so great
[1:24:02] you know when God gives you something
[1:24:04] it's one of two things can happen as God
[1:24:07] blesses you that blessing can turn into
[1:24:10] a curse if you allow Pride to lift you
[1:24:14] up
[1:24:15] but then it also sets you up to really
[1:24:19] be elevated and exalted in God if you
[1:24:22] take that same blessing and learn how to
[1:24:25] humble yourself
[1:24:26] learn how to stay small and little and
[1:24:30] humility is not you know what others
[1:24:33] would say or do or Pride it's really how
[1:24:35] you view yourself pride is when youth
[1:24:38] have an unhealthy thought of who you are
[1:24:40] and how important you are and you know
[1:24:43] you can be a great man you can have all
[1:24:45] the gifts and talents but you carry
[1:24:47] yourself like you know you're just
[1:24:49] nobody you're in the background you
[1:24:51] don't have to be heard you know that's
[1:24:53] powerful that's powerful and the more
[1:24:55] you do that God will give you more but
[1:24:57] by the same token you can be gifted and
[1:25:00] talented and all those things and allow
[1:25:03] that to get to your head and then you'll
[1:25:05] get puffed up and then there's the
[1:25:08] problem it's interesting how in the
[1:25:10] scriptures a bishop or Pastor is not to
[1:25:14] be a novice and there's a reason why in
[1:25:16] Titus it says that the bishop shouldn't
[1:25:19] be a novice or a newcomer why because a
[1:25:22] novice or a newcomer comes in he'll get
[1:25:26] left it in Pride with the things that's
[1:25:28] being shown to him now it's a good thing
[1:25:31] for him to come in it's a good thing to
[1:25:33] desire a work of the Lord but then if it
[1:25:36] comes to you too quickly and you can't
[1:25:38] handle it then Pride sets in
[1:25:42] and then that Pride now and it's true
[1:25:44] you might be the fastest you might can
[1:25:46] jump the highest you might can quote the
[1:25:48] you know the best memory you might all
[1:25:50] that might be true but you see the way
[1:25:53] you're viewing yourself is going to be
[1:25:55] your destruction the Bible tells us
[1:25:57] Pride goes before what
[1:26:01] we see the fall
[1:26:03] but what happened before the fall
[1:26:06] there is some pride God in there there's
[1:26:09] some haughtiness some upliftedness you
[1:26:12] don't want to ever you don't want that
[1:26:14] Spirit on you because that's the spirit
[1:26:16] of the enemy
[1:26:17] he'll get up on you and start to move
[1:26:20] you into a direction that God does not
[1:26:24] want you to go and you know God wants to
[1:26:27] bless us but those blessings can turn a
[1:26:29] curse if we're not careful but we took
[1:26:31] this little widow woman The Widow's
[1:26:33] might she just gave a few pennies in the
[1:26:37] offering and God the Lord Jesus pointed
[1:26:40] it out to his disciples that she gave
[1:26:43] more than all of those that gave even
[1:26:46] though the amount she gave may not have
[1:26:48] been
[1:26:49] the direct amount that the others gave
[1:26:52] and
[1:26:54] you know this uh it's it's not the
[1:26:57] amount you give it's it's the amount
[1:26:58] that you're not giving it's are you
[1:27:01] giving your all are you giving your best
[1:27:03] are you really giving till it's a
[1:27:06] sacrifice
[1:27:07] and brother Banner brings this out and
[1:27:09] this little woman that this little woman
[1:27:12] uh sister Hattie Wright we spoke of her
[1:27:14] and those of us in the message are well
[1:27:17] acquainted with her story
[1:27:19] she was a poor woman I'm not going to
[1:27:21] re-preach that message but she was a
[1:27:23] poor woman and here she is now
[1:27:26] you know something happened in her life
[1:27:28] she becomes a widow her husband was
[1:27:30] killed in a terrible accident her oldest
[1:27:34] boy finds his dad crushed in this
[1:27:38] accident it creates a break right at
[1:27:41] that teenage time of his life and that
[1:27:46] creates the background for the scene of
[1:27:49] why God chose sister Hattie to express
[1:27:53] this great thing and so it's it's always
[1:27:57] on purpose whatever God is doing he
[1:28:00] doesn't accidentally do stuff like us
[1:28:03] he doesn't get caught slipping
[1:28:06] you didn't catch him off guard
[1:28:09] everything that happens before it ever
[1:28:13] happened he already knew exactly all of
[1:28:17] the details he knew all about it
[1:28:19] hard for our mind to comprehend that but
[1:28:22] that is true that's the god that we
[1:28:24] serve
[1:28:25] and so when we look at a testimony it
[1:28:27] helps us helps us when we can look
[1:28:29] backward and see we see the grand you
[1:28:34] know she said that's nothing but the
[1:28:36] truth she had a great desire
[1:28:39] and then God honored that by giving her
[1:28:42] the salvation of her two boys but look
[1:28:45] how simple and humble it was the
[1:28:47] background of it that led up to that now
[1:28:50] brother Branham brings a message Christ
[1:28:54] is the mystery of God revealed in 1963
[1:28:59] and as we've been bringing you some of
[1:29:01] these thoughts on the third pull I want
[1:29:03] to read just one part again for you out
[1:29:08] of the message Look Away to Jesus
[1:29:11] paragraph 43.
[1:29:13] and I'll get into it I trust I know
[1:29:16] there's some of you Saints here or some
[1:29:17] of you visitors here may not understand
[1:29:19] everything but we'll there's something
[1:29:22] on the table for you today all right you
[1:29:24] will all get a bite to eat okay I trust
[1:29:27] I trust the Lord will bless you program
[1:29:30] 43 he says this it says it's so sacred
[1:29:33] that I mustn't say much about it as he
[1:29:35] told me in the beginning said this say
[1:29:38] nothing of it you remember that years
[1:29:40] ago
[1:29:41] it speaks for itself but I've tried to
[1:29:45] explain the others I made a mistake this
[1:29:48] will be the thing that to my opinion
[1:29:52] I don't say that the Lord tells me this
[1:29:55] this will be the thing that will start
[1:29:58] the rapturing faith for the going away
[1:30:03] interesting how he brings in
[1:30:07] this third pool will be the thing that
[1:30:10] will start
[1:30:12] this second
[1:30:14] Thessalonians event to take place
[1:30:18] now we know the Rapture the catchy in a
[1:30:20] way is ahead of us
[1:30:24] that's what's ahead of us
[1:30:26] so that is a single event that happens
[1:30:31] multiple times before the actual
[1:30:34] happening takes place so a Rapture or
[1:30:37] the catching away or being caught away
[1:30:39] that will continue to happen to a
[1:30:41] Believer as you go into God's word when
[1:30:44] you read his word he raptures he opens
[1:30:48] up more he catches you away into another
[1:30:51] level than what you were before thank
[1:30:54] the Lord for it I'm not the man I was 20
[1:30:57] years ago 30 years ago I had a little
[1:31:00] faith a little knowledge but the Lord
[1:31:02] keeps pouring out more and so that moves
[1:31:04] us up into these cycles of God
[1:31:08] developing our faith because our faith
[1:31:13] is the most important thing
[1:31:16] that you got
[1:31:18] it ain't your knowledge it's not your
[1:31:21] head knowledge but faith is the most
[1:31:23] valuable thing you if Satan can destroy
[1:31:28] your faith then you can't even please
[1:31:31] God you cut off all the channels to God
[1:31:34] you can't even get right with God you
[1:31:36] can't even make an approach to God when
[1:31:38] he when he crushes your face when he
[1:31:42] when he when he ruins that that
[1:31:45] possibility that God can move or do
[1:31:48] something in your life then he's got you
[1:31:50] so we know that faith is the substance
[1:31:53] of things hoped for the evidence of
[1:31:55] Things Not Seen so the Rapture is event
[1:31:58] to come it's an event to come
[1:32:01] we know that tomorrow is Monday right
[1:32:05] that's an event to come that's a day to
[1:32:07] come that's in the future for us we
[1:32:10] still have to live out Sunday and
[1:32:13] um
[1:32:14] um we don't want to get ahead of
[1:32:16] ourselves we have to plan for it for
[1:32:19] Monday but we still have to live out
[1:32:21] today and the Rapture is an event to
[1:32:24] come you know what's interesting about
[1:32:27] the Rapture is the pre-rapture and the
[1:32:31] post-raptor we're in the pre-rapture
[1:32:33] we're just before the church is caught
[1:32:36] away
[1:32:37] and there's things that's going to take
[1:32:40] place after the Rapture that the world
[1:32:44] will know nothing about it they won't
[1:32:46] understand that there's a group that was
[1:32:50] taken out of the earth it happened in
[1:32:52] the days of Noah it happened in many
[1:32:54] ages even when John the Baptist the Jews
[1:32:58] who were looking for Elijah missed him
[1:33:02] and when Elijah came and was manifested
[1:33:05] and gone they still was asking I thought
[1:33:07] the Scribe said Elijah was supposed to
[1:33:10] come well they missed him isn't that
[1:33:12] interesting
[1:33:13] and take a a quote here in the message
[1:33:16] scriptural signs of the time 1964. this
[1:33:20] is a sobering thought the brother random
[1:33:22] says this here now one of these days
[1:33:24] that little minority is paragraph 12.
[1:33:28] as it was in the days of knowing wherein
[1:33:32] eight Souls was saved by water so shall
[1:33:34] it be in the coming of the son of man in
[1:33:37] the days of lot wearing three Souls were
[1:33:40] saved from fire so shall it be at the
[1:33:42] coming of the son of man
[1:33:44] they're looking for a great big
[1:33:46] Universal something when it's not even
[1:33:49] in the scripture see one of these days
[1:33:52] they'll say well I thought the Bible
[1:33:56] said that the church will escape all of
[1:33:59] this
[1:34:00] the bride escapes this
[1:34:03] and just think after Noah as it was in
[1:34:06] the days of Noah Noah went into the ark
[1:34:09] and the door was closed he went on went
[1:34:13] in on May the 17th the door was closed
[1:34:15] and never rained for seven days after he
[1:34:19] was in the ark
[1:34:21] and they didn't know it God closed the
[1:34:24] door
[1:34:25] and one day the door of Mercy will be
[1:34:28] closed
[1:34:29] and people will go right on thinking
[1:34:32] they're getting saved and preaching and
[1:34:36] so forth and mercy has done been spurned
[1:34:38] this last time and know it not until
[1:34:41] it's missing remember there is hundreds
[1:34:44] of people missing every day that we
[1:34:46] cannot find or give an account for them
[1:34:49] world over there will be one in the
[1:34:51] field I'll take one two in the bed I'll
[1:34:54] take one universal so it won't take very
[1:34:58] many to make that escape the raptured
[1:35:01] bride remember these signs
[1:35:05] but the random continues in the message
[1:35:07] who do you say this is 1964 paragraph
[1:35:10] 114.
[1:35:12] do you realize the day that we could be
[1:35:15] in see it could be that they never get
[1:35:18] it do you know Jesus said when the
[1:35:20] sleeping virgin now remember the
[1:35:22] sleeping version come to call
[1:35:25] for oil it was all sealed out she didn't
[1:35:29] get it she never got it do you realize
[1:35:32] that after the bride is done gone
[1:35:35] Rapture to Heaven churches will still go
[1:35:38] on people think they're getting saved
[1:35:41] and everything just like they always did
[1:35:43] continue just like it was in the days of
[1:35:46] Noah they went right ahead eating
[1:35:49] drinking everything just like they
[1:35:52] always did they didn't know it but the
[1:35:55] door was closed
[1:35:57] and it could be friends that the door
[1:35:59] could close at any time maybe already
[1:36:03] for all I know we don't know there's
[1:36:06] just going to be a few of them go in we
[1:36:08] know that as it was in the days of Noah
[1:36:11] eight Souls were saved so shall it be at
[1:36:14] the coming of the son of man so there's
[1:36:19] just be a few Souls safe so this is
[1:36:23] striking reality isn't that to think
[1:36:25] that the door will be closed and
[1:36:28] churches the people the politics the
[1:36:32] work schedules careers daily life will
[1:36:36] continue on the Bible was very clear in
[1:36:39] Genesis I believe it's six it says until
[1:36:42] the day that Noah went into the ark they
[1:36:44] ate they drank what what do we expect
[1:36:48] like a perfect heads up day that the
[1:36:52] Lord is coming let's say on a Sunday
[1:36:54] morning some Sunday morning and all my
[1:36:57] bills will be paid my garage will be
[1:37:00] straightened out all of the junk in
[1:37:03] these files and folders I'll get all
[1:37:04] those things but and up like I've always
[1:37:06] said I would do and everything will be
[1:37:09] tidy and then I'll sit back in my chair
[1:37:11] and be like Lord okay today is a perfect
[1:37:13] day for you to come that's how it's
[1:37:16] going to happen he's going to come in a
[1:37:18] day while people are doing whatever
[1:37:19] they're doing right now
[1:37:21] some will be late to church
[1:37:24] and it won't be a matter
[1:37:26] it won't even matter because the door is
[1:37:29] closed some decide well I'm not going to
[1:37:31] go this morning well don't go because
[1:37:33] it's too late anyways
[1:37:35] but this is reality this is how it's
[1:37:38] going to look
[1:37:40] after this great event the rapture now
[1:37:45] brother Banner makes it very clear that
[1:37:48] he believed that this third pool had
[1:37:51] something to do with the Rapture the
[1:37:55] rapturing faith that's required so
[1:37:59] there's an object that God has he has a
[1:38:02] motive and objective and that is based
[1:38:05] your motives and your objectives are
[1:38:07] surrounded around what your desires are
[1:38:11] and when the the opportunity came to
[1:38:14] Sister Hattie what is your greatest
[1:38:17] desire what's your greatest desire and
[1:38:21] she said what do you mean
[1:38:22] like what do I need this week what I
[1:38:25] need in the fridge what I need in the
[1:38:28] account no we want to supersede art what
[1:38:30] is your greatest what narrow it down
[1:38:33] real quick take inventory what is your
[1:38:36] greatest desire
[1:38:38] what do you really want
[1:38:40] what's motivating you
[1:38:43] what is your why
[1:38:46] your purpose what is your really your
[1:38:49] greatest desire I can tell you this if
[1:38:52] your greatest then that's something
[1:38:54] worth striving for
[1:38:57] you know God has a great motive
[1:39:00] a great desire and he tells us this in
[1:39:04] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:39:07] the prophet of God tells us that God had
[1:39:10] a threefold purpose that God wanted to
[1:39:14] reveal himself to the people
[1:39:16] he wanted to have preeminence in his
[1:39:19] people the bride and he wanted to
[1:39:22] restore the kingdom to his right
[1:39:24] position so we're all men here men and
[1:39:27] women
[1:39:28] I'm certainly some people maybe try to
[1:39:32] identify as an animal or something but
[1:39:34] we're all men and women here
[1:39:35] will be very clear and so let's go back
[1:39:38] to the first man just for a moment take
[1:39:40] your Bible with me and turn in Genesis
[1:39:43] you know this man Adam
[1:39:45] the first man on the earth very
[1:39:47] interesting
[1:39:48] a gentleman he didn't say the Bible
[1:39:51] doesn't record many words that he spoke
[1:39:57] and
[1:40:00] but God could see the need in his life
[1:40:03] he was lonely
[1:40:07] and
[1:40:09] before the loneliness came
[1:40:13] uh he God gave him verse this is Genesis
[1:40:17] chapter two excuse me in verse number
[1:40:21] 18. this is the Lord in his great
[1:40:24] creation bringing man about
[1:40:26] and the Lord God said it is not good
[1:40:29] that man should be alone I will make him
[1:40:31] a help me for him and out of the ground
[1:40:34] the Lord God formed every beast of the
[1:40:36] field and every fowl of the air and
[1:40:38] brought them unto Adam to see what he
[1:40:40] would call them and whatsoever Adam
[1:40:43] called every living creature that was
[1:40:48] the name there uh smart guy
[1:40:52] this is a smart man yeah yeah this is an
[1:40:55] intelligent man I can hardly name a few
[1:40:59] animals and creatures
[1:41:02] and Adam gives name to all of the living
[1:41:06] creatures
[1:41:07] he's the first man Adam he's the first
[1:41:10] uh human being he's made in the image
[1:41:14] and the likeness of God as a spirit then
[1:41:17] he was made flesh
[1:41:19] we don't really know what Adam lost
[1:41:21] because we can see in the fall he loses
[1:41:26] everything before we can actually hear
[1:41:29] him talk more
[1:41:30] but when Jesus come Jesus showed us what
[1:41:35] kind of man Adam was
[1:41:37] because Jesus was the second Adam and
[1:41:40] what Jesus did showed us what Adam had
[1:41:43] the ability to do and the prophet of the
[1:41:46] age is not written in the in the Bible
[1:41:49] like that but in the prophet of the age
[1:41:51] shows us The Authority that Adam had
[1:41:56] now all the creation comes to him he had
[1:41:59] the intelligence to give them a name and
[1:42:03] a name denotes that there's some order
[1:42:05] there
[1:42:07] any names and classifies them the little
[1:42:10] creatures the big creatures the bugs the
[1:42:13] birds all of the living beings were
[1:42:17] named by Adam
[1:42:19] so when the second Adam come Jesus he
[1:42:23] now takes control over the elements
[1:42:27] he has the power to stop a storm
[1:42:32] he has the power to tell a fig tree no
[1:42:36] man eat from you and the next day it's
[1:42:38] gone
[1:42:39] but in the Old Testament he could take a
[1:42:41] branch from a from an almond tree and in
[1:42:44] 24 hours in it increases life that it
[1:42:48] bugs Blossom and blooms
[1:42:50] the same God of creation can bring it he
[1:42:55] can take it away he's got full power and
[1:42:58] this is what Adam lost
[1:43:03] so as a man this is what our desires are
[1:43:06] is to go back to what Adam lost
[1:43:09] in the first seal second seals brother
[1:43:12] Branham and the breach also message he
[1:43:15] brings in what this book of redemption
[1:43:18] was what Adam had in the garden he had
[1:43:21] the ability
[1:43:23] over the fishes and the fowls of the air
[1:43:27] he had the ability to move nature
[1:43:31] he had the ability to move the mountains
[1:43:35] and the trees
[1:43:37] and plant in the garden the way he
[1:43:39] wanted it he used the power he used the
[1:43:43] power that God had given him in that one
[1:43:46] in that nice think of it
[1:43:49] this is why Jesus can say
[1:43:52] if you say to this mountain be thou
[1:43:54] moved
[1:43:56] he's not talking to an Angelic being
[1:43:58] he's talking to a man
[1:44:00] he's seen men do it before Adam was the
[1:44:03] first man he had this power he had this
[1:44:05] ability
[1:44:07] and so these are the great objectives
[1:44:10] that God had from the beginning let me
[1:44:14] read a few
[1:44:15] quotations for you from the message
[1:44:19] in
[1:44:21] the message the Rapture paragraph number
[1:44:23] 65 the prophet of God says this here
[1:44:28] before we read that let's take Matthew
[1:44:30] 24 just briefly
[1:44:34] what are we talking about faith for the
[1:44:37] rapture
[1:44:39] we've got to have faith for that Rapture
[1:44:42] that is an age requirement
[1:44:46] all right
[1:44:48] how many Saints are here this morning
[1:44:50] this should be your objective all right
[1:44:54] we want to refocus your glasses this
[1:44:57] morning
[1:44:58] pick up those spiritual glasses and you
[1:45:00] start looking through those and that
[1:45:02] should be your object your objection
[1:45:04] Matthew 24 37 but as the days of Noah
[1:45:09] were
[1:45:10] 24 37 so shall it also at the coming of
[1:45:14] the son of man be for in the as in the
[1:45:17] days that were before the flood they
[1:45:20] were eating drinking marrying and giving
[1:45:23] in marriage until the day that Noah
[1:45:26] entered into the yard
[1:45:28] and Noah knew not until the flood came
[1:45:30] and took them all away so show also the
[1:45:34] coming of the son of man be
[1:45:36] then shall two be in the field the one
[1:45:39] shall be taken the other one left two
[1:45:42] women shall be grinding at the mail the
[1:45:44] one shall be taken the other left watch
[1:45:47] therefore for you know not what our your
[1:45:51] lord doth come
[1:45:57] now
[1:45:59] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:46:01] the very last right at the end of the
[1:46:04] message paragraph 6 37.
[1:46:09] Prophet God says this year
[1:46:14] and remember this is the three and a
[1:46:16] half three hour plus sermon
[1:46:20] three and a half hours three hours 20
[1:46:22] minutes whatever it was how many minutes
[1:46:23] was that message somebody tell me please
[1:46:25] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:46:28] 359. thank you
[1:46:30] three almost four hours
[1:46:34] we would say it was over four hours
[1:46:37] how we like to exaggerate
[1:46:40] who's in there for over four hours he
[1:46:43] preached for four hours
[1:46:45] and we don't know what they did at the
[1:46:47] pre-service we don't know if there were
[1:46:48] any song specials and these are the
[1:46:51] these are the Saints that we say you
[1:46:53] know they don't really know who the
[1:46:55] prophet was because we have all the
[1:46:57] tapes now we really know who he is they
[1:47:00] can sit and say Amen throughout the
[1:47:01] listen to the tape they're saying amen
[1:47:03] all hour one hour two hour three hour
[1:47:08] four days still saying Amy he's getting
[1:47:11] ready to close they said no no no keep
[1:47:13] going
[1:47:14] what kind of church was he preaching in
[1:47:17] we supposed to be more anointed more
[1:47:20] revelated got more time servers we got
[1:47:23] everything taken care of and we can't
[1:47:25] after 45 minutes y'all start I feel it
[1:47:28] you start tightening up
[1:47:30] there's some people here back in the
[1:47:32] early 60s for our sermon
[1:47:38] still saying amen
[1:47:40] and there he is now
[1:47:42] at the end of the sermon
[1:47:45] he was trying to close he kept saying
[1:47:48] I'll cut this out I'll bring this in and
[1:47:50] then right at paragraph 637 look what
[1:47:52] God does
[1:47:54] not knowing
[1:47:56] of course being spiritual you watch
[1:47:59] spiritual things
[1:48:01] not knowing this God Knows It But if
[1:48:05] you'll turn and look at the clock
[1:48:07] it's on the dot two o'clock
[1:48:10] the end of the second pool
[1:48:14] the third pool is at hand
[1:48:17] nobody's bringing this to the people and
[1:48:19] so he makes this statement and then he
[1:48:22] starts to sing the song that they were
[1:48:24] singing Take the name of Jesus and the
[1:48:27] song takes an octave higher ah
[1:48:30] how do you remember that
[1:48:33] go hear it again all right get to the
[1:48:36] message there don't fast forward it
[1:48:37] listen to the whole thing
[1:48:40] but I fast forward to it it's like I
[1:48:42] fast forward through my Bible so but
[1:48:44] paragraph 637 and he's bringing in you
[1:48:47] who are spiritual you watch spiritual
[1:48:49] things he didn't time this he didn't he
[1:48:51] wasn't trying to manipulate this this is
[1:48:54] two o'clock you've been preaching for
[1:48:56] three hours what time did the service
[1:48:59] start
[1:49:00] okay it is on the dot two o'clock the
[1:49:04] second pool
[1:49:06] is over
[1:49:08] the third pool is at hand this is what's
[1:49:11] to look for now so we see this great
[1:49:15] three third pool is a very important
[1:49:18] subject to the believer
[1:49:20] it's a it's a age requirement to have
[1:49:24] faith for the Rapture let's go back to a
[1:49:29] couple other ages just for a moment
[1:49:32] and those other ages
[1:49:34] let's take
[1:49:36] like I said Adam we don't hear very many
[1:49:38] words out of Adam
[1:49:40] oh I'll see him again I believe the
[1:49:43] Jehovah Witnesses don't believe Adam is
[1:49:45] saved he's lost can never be redeemed
[1:49:48] because of the sin that he committed
[1:49:50] but the Bible says that Adam knew that
[1:49:53] he was doing and he did that in order to
[1:49:56] redeem his right Eve showing in the
[1:49:59] great uh pre-figure of what Christ was
[1:50:02] doing for the church he was given his
[1:50:04] life for the church so he became a
[1:50:07] sinner
[1:50:08] on the cross of Calvary to take our sin
[1:50:11] he didn't know any sin he knew no sin
[1:50:14] but that we might be made the
[1:50:16] righteousness of God he put partook of
[1:50:19] the sin he partook of the fruit like
[1:50:21] Adam partook of the fruit that Eve gave
[1:50:24] adam had every right to leave Eve hang
[1:50:28] him
[1:50:29] but I'm so glad the Lord didn't leave me
[1:50:32] hanging amen
[1:50:33] she was wrong but he extended out Grace
[1:50:38] to her to bring her and when God saw
[1:50:41] that great he made a plan of Escape for
[1:50:45] both of them to be saved and so
[1:50:48] after Adam we'll see that
[1:50:52] um our Lord
[1:50:53] uh the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:50:56] brings in
[1:50:58] Noah we read about Noah
[1:51:01] requirement for Noah and this age was to
[1:51:05] have faith to believe him all you had to
[1:51:08] do was get on the ark
[1:51:10] or would you or be married to one of his
[1:51:12] sons
[1:51:13] basically
[1:51:15] all you had to do was get on the ark you
[1:51:19] had plenty of time
[1:51:21] and Noah's out there preaching away and
[1:51:24] preaching away and God is through with
[1:51:27] man and Humanity every imagination is
[1:51:30] evil all the time he says I'm through it
[1:51:32] man I'm going to destroy but Noah found
[1:51:35] Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[1:51:39] I'm through with everybody but you know
[1:51:42] you found Grace now this is what you
[1:51:44] need to do here's the wood here's the
[1:51:48] plans here's the length of the wood
[1:51:51] here's how I want it built three floors
[1:51:53] here's the animals that need to come in
[1:51:55] I'll do my part you do your part and he
[1:51:58] built he's working on this Ark and all
[1:52:00] you had to do was get into Noah's Ark
[1:52:04] after the Hebrews go down to Egypt there
[1:52:07] were slaves they're let out with a
[1:52:08] mighty hand under a tremendous law Giver
[1:52:12] one of the greatest prophets in the
[1:52:15] bible one of the names that's known
[1:52:17] throughout the Bible one of the most
[1:52:19] famous names throughout the Bible That's
[1:52:21] The Prophet Moses
[1:52:23] Moses born a proper child God calls him
[1:52:26] and raises him up and the people
[1:52:29] followed Moses that age requirement was
[1:52:33] to be in the Covenant
[1:52:36] that God gave them of circumcision and
[1:52:39] followed the laws and all of the
[1:52:42] protocols and and the land was very
[1:52:45] important to God restoring Israel their
[1:52:48] land and then of course we know John the
[1:52:50] Baptist another great time or age for
[1:52:54] Humanity he was a forerunner to Christ
[1:52:58] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:00] that requirement in Jesus's day was to
[1:53:04] believe that he was who he said he was
[1:53:09] he was God made flesh he was The Lord Of
[1:53:12] Glory
[1:53:13] easy for us to believe that today we
[1:53:16] have history to prove it but in that day
[1:53:19] it was hard for Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:53:22] who spent their whole life studying the
[1:53:25] scripture and the law of Moses and here
[1:53:27] comes a new Young priest or young new
[1:53:30] Prophet Jesus from Nazareth doing things
[1:53:33] we've never seen done before
[1:53:35] but you had to believe that you had to
[1:53:37] receive that Jesus said except you
[1:53:40] believe that I am he you'll die in your
[1:53:43] sins
[1:53:45] you'll die in your sins
[1:53:47] except you believe that I'm the one
[1:53:49] before Abraham was I am he I'm the one
[1:53:54] and I had a hard time but there was an
[1:53:56] elect that caught that
[1:53:58] and then of course after the day of
[1:54:01] Pentecost
[1:54:02] and the great Reformation of the church
[1:54:05] and the ages and here we are today
[1:54:08] our requirement today is a little bit
[1:54:12] more difficult more deep than any other
[1:54:15] age that's gone on before so let's get
[1:54:17] into that just a little bit here as the
[1:54:20] Lord will help us
[1:54:22] in the message the Rapture paragraph 65.
[1:54:25] prophet of God says this here but to the
[1:54:28] church the bride the Rapture is a
[1:54:32] revelation to her
[1:54:34] it's revealed to her that the Revelation
[1:54:38] the true bride of Christ will be waiting
[1:54:42] for that revelation of the rapture
[1:54:46] now it is a revelation for the
[1:54:49] Revelation is faith you cannot have
[1:54:53] Revelation without it being faith faith
[1:54:56] is a revelation because it's something
[1:54:58] that's revealed to you faith is a
[1:55:01] revelation faith is something that has
[1:55:05] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:55:07] Abraham that could call anything
[1:55:10] contrary to what have been revealed to
[1:55:12] him as though it wasn't so now Faith
[1:55:15] that's what faith is is the revelation
[1:55:20] of God the church is built upon a
[1:55:24] revelation the whole entire body
[1:55:27] brother Madam continues on paragraph 154
[1:55:30] same message the Rapture he said the
[1:55:33] first thing that comes forth in his
[1:55:36] message calling the bride together the
[1:55:38] next thing is the resurrection of the
[1:55:40] sleeping bride the ones that died back
[1:55:43] in the other ages they caught together
[1:55:45] and the trumpet the feast in the heavens
[1:55:48] in the sky that's the thing that takes
[1:55:52] place friends
[1:55:53] we're right there ready now
[1:55:58] the only thing the church coming out has
[1:56:00] got to lay before the sun to ripen
[1:56:04] and you say Amen
[1:56:06] amen we're right there ready now ready
[1:56:09] for what ready for the Rapture the going
[1:56:12] away
[1:56:13] we're getting out of here it's all
[1:56:15] culminating to this God had an objection
[1:56:19] in his mind he had a purpose in his mind
[1:56:23] he had a reason why he brought man here
[1:56:26] there's a reason why he allowed to fall
[1:56:28] so that he can produce a savior to the
[1:56:32] world we wouldn't know what a savior was
[1:56:35] if nobody wasn't needed a savior if
[1:56:38] nobody was lost wouldn't know what a
[1:56:41] Healer is somebody had to get sick we
[1:56:45] wouldn't know what a friend is unless
[1:56:48] you had an enemy or a fold but God
[1:56:51] reveals that he allows it he doesn't do
[1:56:54] it but he allows it and then he reveals
[1:56:57] himself as the friend as the Savior as
[1:57:01] the Healer
[1:57:03] brother Benham in the message once more
[1:57:05] he says this here paragraph 177.
[1:57:10] so we know there's a Rapture to the
[1:57:12] church Saints we're looking for that
[1:57:14] rapture
[1:57:15] here's what the prophet of God says Lord
[1:57:18] Jesus Great Master Of Life The Shepherd
[1:57:21] of the sheep come forth Lord these
[1:57:24] people are hungry they're thirsty Lord
[1:57:27] years I've wanted to see this happen
[1:57:29] maybe it will just once more Lord one
[1:57:34] more great move of the spirit One More
[1:57:37] Time Lord and the church might receive
[1:57:40] the rapturing faith to go in
[1:57:44] granted Lord make known that you are
[1:57:48] with us and we will praise thee for it
[1:57:51] in Jesus name we ask it amen
[1:57:56] in the message the token
[1:57:58] 1963 the prophet of God says this
[1:58:02] I am looking for a time of a Break Forth
[1:58:06] a Break Forth of the spirit of God in
[1:58:09] these last days that we're now living in
[1:58:11] for another surge of the Holy Spirit
[1:58:15] into the church now he's looking for
[1:58:17] that he's looking for it into the church
[1:58:20] for a rapturing faith
[1:58:24] just before it comes and everything is
[1:58:28] sitting straight in order for that and I
[1:58:31] believe that we're now at the time that
[1:58:33] the word should have preeminence
[1:58:36] I believe that the time to lay aside our
[1:58:39] Creeds and our thoughts and come back to
[1:58:42] the word
[1:58:44] as our brother said this morning it's
[1:58:46] time to stop playing Church
[1:58:49] we're not here to play Church
[1:58:52] we're here to get ready for the rapture
[1:58:56] for the great going away and before we
[1:58:59] can have a rapture we got to have
[1:59:00] Rapture in faith
[1:59:02] amen
[1:59:04] I'm gonna have a power a surge come to
[1:59:07] us something greater than what we have
[1:59:10] right now
[1:59:11] some of us can't get along we can't we
[1:59:14] don't have what it takes we have a
[1:59:16] little bit God's been good to us but we
[1:59:18] we know we don't have what it takes for
[1:59:21] the body change something is lacking
[1:59:24] something is missing
[1:59:26] and whatever's missing whatever I need I
[1:59:29] want it Lord is that your attitude
[1:59:32] if God sent a great move of the Holy
[1:59:35] Spirit to this church would you get
[1:59:38] offended by it
[1:59:40] would you call it fanaticism
[1:59:43] would you be tripping on Church order
[1:59:46] would you
[1:59:48] would you step back with your arms
[1:59:49] folded
[1:59:51] trying to examine Who's In the Flesh and
[1:59:53] who's not
[1:59:55] or would you be looking for power to
[1:59:58] come upon me Lord
[2:00:00] if you're blessing him bless me too
[2:00:04] amen I'm looking for a surge
[2:00:08] I need a surge I need an anointing I
[2:00:12] need a touch from the master I need to
[2:00:15] feel his precious one more time
[2:00:25] amen the prophet continues says and
[2:00:28] everyone knows that look away to Jesus
[2:00:30] everyone knows that for certain as the
[2:00:33] first was identified so the second has
[2:00:35] been identified and you'll think real
[2:00:37] closely You Are Spiritual as the Bible
[2:00:40] said here's to him that has wisdom the
[2:00:42] third is properly identified see we know
[2:00:46] where it is so the third pull is here
[2:00:50] so sacred I mustn't say much about it as
[2:00:53] you told me in the beginning say nothing
[2:00:55] of it remember that years ago
[2:00:58] it speaks for itself
[2:01:00] I've tried to explain the others I made
[2:01:02] a mistake this will be the thing that to
[2:01:04] my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me
[2:01:07] this this will be a thing that will
[2:01:11] start the rapturing faith for the going
[2:01:14] away see this is 1963. it comes down to
[2:01:18] 1964 and the message countdown and he
[2:01:21] says this here now paragraph 175 now
[2:01:24] look I've said some pretty rough things
[2:01:27] about airplane automobile remember they
[2:01:31] are horsepower too
[2:01:33] all of it is a horsepower
[2:01:36] the church is just moving up
[2:01:38] holy ghost power
[2:01:40] is the holy ghost that we're justified
[2:01:43] by you ministers know that don't you the
[2:01:46] Holy Ghost sanctifies us the Holy Ghost
[2:01:49] fills us the Holy Ghost gives us Rapture
[2:01:53] in faith
[2:01:55] as we move up
[2:02:00] Jehovah Jireh 1964. now I may not have
[2:02:03] faith enough to make every word of it
[2:02:05] Act but I certainly wouldn't stand in
[2:02:08] the way of nobody that did have that
[2:02:10] Faith Enoch had faith enough one day to
[2:02:13] take an afternoon stroll with God and
[2:02:15] just keep on walking he went on home
[2:02:18] without dying now I think the church has
[2:02:21] got to come to that to a rapturing faith
[2:02:25] I may not have that Faith just now
[2:02:28] listen to The Prophet now I may not have
[2:02:30] that Faith just now but I sure wouldn't
[2:02:33] stand in the way of somebody that did
[2:02:36] have that faith
[2:02:39] all right
[2:02:40] paragraph number four in spiritual food
[2:02:43] and due season and I want to maybe close
[2:02:46] here or prepare to close here and just
[2:02:49] really hammer on this one here and he
[2:02:52] says this here
[2:02:53] have a prayer line as we can get one up
[2:02:56] here but you're dedicating this service
[2:02:57] tonight for prayer for the sake
[2:03:00] and I want you to get built up now
[2:03:03] in this holy Oracles of God in the faith
[2:03:07] the faith of this hour the faith is
[2:03:10] going to take more faith than ever was
[2:03:14] in any age
[2:03:16] for this has to be rapturing Faith be
[2:03:19] taken up and so we want you to believe
[2:03:22] tonight in all that you have seen heard
[2:03:25] the word that you have heard preached
[2:03:28] the signs and wonders that you have seen
[2:03:30] done we want you we want you to
[2:03:32] accumulate all that together in your
[2:03:35] heart and consider it whether it be God
[2:03:38] or not so here the prophet is telling us
[2:03:42] that our age requirement
[2:03:45] is more than any other age required
[2:03:51] you know the sin of today
[2:03:54] if I was to go back and was able to
[2:03:57] transfer back in time and just go back
[2:03:59] to 1980 I was 10 years old or so
[2:04:02] in 1980 and I was to go back and look at
[2:04:05] the churches in that day
[2:04:07] and I and I handed them a piece of paper
[2:04:10] of what we would be preaching against
[2:04:12] and what the world is struggling with
[2:04:14] Humanity wise and church people them
[2:04:17] church people probably wouldn't even
[2:04:19] believe what I was trying to tell them
[2:04:22] like we know it's gonna get bad it'll
[2:04:24] never get that bad
[2:04:26] and I had a one of the preachers that I
[2:04:28] always looked up to he was a bishop a
[2:04:30] bishop Foster CT Foster he wasn't our
[2:04:34] pastor but he was an evangelist like he
[2:04:36] wasn't a bishop he was an evangelist
[2:04:37] that went around very experienced I
[2:04:40] always looked up to him and I said under
[2:04:42] a bishop Bishop Lewin and I always
[2:04:44] looked up to him these are just
[2:04:46] Pentecostals Pentecostal Holiness
[2:04:49] preachers
[2:04:50] and they did things that wasn't right
[2:04:52] doctrinally they didn't understand a lot
[2:04:54] of things Dr Lee but but those Holy
[2:04:58] Ghost preachers back in the 1980s
[2:05:01] I will take them over some of the
[2:05:03] message preachers today
[2:05:06] that's a hard statement to say but their
[2:05:09] attitude their reverence their
[2:05:12] commitments
[2:05:15] you talk about a prayer meeting
[2:05:18] five babies talking about fasting a week
[2:05:21] I'm talking about meetings a weekday of
[2:05:24] meetings
[2:05:25] preaching Services Monday Tuesday
[2:05:27] Wednesday Thursday Saturday we can't do
[2:05:30] that here y'all won't let me
[2:05:33] we can't do that here because amen
[2:05:36] oh
[2:05:39] but but their their life that they live
[2:05:41] I'll take I'll take some of what they
[2:05:44] had over a lot of the nonsense that I
[2:05:46] see today
[2:05:48] because we're in a different time
[2:05:51] and it requires a tenacity in your faith
[2:05:56] that you can't be looking at other
[2:05:59] people as your guide to serving the lord
[2:06:03] you gotta have your guide as the Lord
[2:06:07] himself in Your Vision he's the one that
[2:06:11] we serve
[2:06:13] yes sir
[2:06:15] he's the one that we're dedicated to
[2:06:18] is that Mike too loud is that too loud
[2:06:19] for you all right good I can hear myself
[2:06:21] good
[2:06:23] but if we're the one we're the ones
[2:06:24] we're dedicated to him and this age
[2:06:28] requires
[2:06:31] I'm talking about a tenacity
[2:06:34] just to make a prayer meeting
[2:06:37] just to make it to Wednesday night's
[2:06:39] service
[2:06:40] just to make it to Sunday night service
[2:06:42] just to keep the all the Commandments of
[2:06:45] the Lord because this age has us so busy
[2:06:50] with the things of the world
[2:06:53] and people have changed
[2:06:56] and the requirement of the age
[2:06:59] is rapturing faith
[2:07:02] or Rapture in Grace
[2:07:05] and there's a reason why Satan is
[2:07:07] howling
[2:07:08] it's a terminology brother Branham uses
[2:07:11] howling
[2:07:12] look at what he's done in the world
[2:07:14] today look at the look at the the
[2:07:18] garbage that's going on in the world
[2:07:19] today
[2:07:21] look at what's going on in the churches
[2:07:23] look at look at the young men today
[2:07:27] look at the young women today
[2:07:30] and so-called preachers too
[2:07:34] it requires a faith
[2:07:38] and I thank God that he's given us
[2:07:41] the evening light that we can have the
[2:07:44] faith for the rapture
[2:07:47] that's our objective today
[2:07:50] that's our Focus today
[2:07:53] is that I will be ready to stand before
[2:07:55] the son of man
[2:07:58] that I would accumulate the faith that
[2:08:02] this age requires not The Faith from any
[2:08:04] other age but this age requires a
[2:08:07] rapturing faith what are those virtues
[2:08:09] add to your faith
[2:08:12] virtue into virtue knowledge knowledge
[2:08:15] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[2:08:18] godliness
[2:08:20] Godly Miss brotherly kindness brotherly
[2:08:24] kindness charity
[2:08:26] which is love
[2:08:29] which is perfect love
[2:08:33] this is our objective
[2:08:35] is perfect love
[2:08:38] this is our objective
[2:08:40] is to be sealed
[2:08:43] with his Divine love
[2:08:46] now the prophet of God takes the message
[2:08:49] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:08:52] and he says this here
[2:08:55] many many things he says but I want to
[2:08:57] bring this here to you
[2:09:02] as he's he was going further and deeper
[2:09:06] into the message
[2:09:09] he was at the three hour mark
[2:09:12] and he says this here
[2:09:16] so you know that God had his great
[2:09:18] Secret in his mind
[2:09:24] and
[2:09:26] he revealed that to his people
[2:09:29] and they were the prophet of God says
[2:09:31] here
[2:09:33] this is paragraph 541.
[2:09:38] so he's already built the message up
[2:09:40] he's gone three hours already
[2:09:42] you've got an hour left to go
[2:09:44] but at the three-hour Mark he says this
[2:09:46] in this message Christ is the mystery of
[2:09:48] God revealed you newcomers you visitors
[2:09:51] we're not going to preach three hours
[2:09:52] okay
[2:09:53] I'm not setting you up but yeah
[2:09:56] but if I did
[2:10:00] I bless you
[2:10:03] paragraph 541 it says one more great
[2:10:06] remark I want to make if I have to move
[2:10:09] over a little bit now notice listen to
[2:10:11] this
[2:10:12] now
[2:10:14] is the great thing now is where we want
[2:10:17] to watch remember in the last days we'll
[2:10:22] exactly go back and vindicate the first
[2:10:25] day see Adam and Eve husband and wife
[2:10:30] know sin
[2:10:32] life
[2:10:33] then the fall now notice notice closely
[2:10:37] notice what caused it Lucifer
[2:10:41] Lucifer is doing now as he did at the
[2:10:45] first time just as the kingdom of the
[2:10:47] Gentiles was brought in with King
[2:10:49] Nebuchadnezzar Vindicated the Gentile
[2:10:51] raised by a prophet who could interpret
[2:10:54] unknown tongues visions and dreams and
[2:10:56] it's come down through the Gentiles
[2:10:58] without anything just medoin Persians
[2:11:01] iron and so forth the feet goes out the
[2:11:04] same way the Gentile Kingdom notice
[2:11:07] Lucifer in the last days is doing as he
[2:11:11] did at the first
[2:11:13] what did Lucifer do the first thing that
[2:11:17] Lucifer done to separate the fellowship
[2:11:19] of God and man he wanted to build him a
[2:11:24] United Kingdom a greater Splendor and
[2:11:28] seemingly more cultured and a greater
[2:11:32] Kingdom than Michael Christ had you got
[2:11:35] it now if you miss it just hold up your
[2:11:37] hand I'll say it again you see
[2:11:39] Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in
[2:11:43] heart was to achieve a brighter and
[2:11:47] greater thing in heaven than Christ had
[2:11:49] is that right by seemingly a more
[2:11:52] cultured more beautiful more splendored
[2:11:56] than the kingdom of Christ do you do you
[2:11:58] think we'll have automobiles in the
[2:12:00] Millennium and airplanes see see what
[2:12:03] Lucifer is doing now the big fancy
[2:12:06] intellectual denominations are doing the
[2:12:09] very same thing Gathering themselves
[2:12:13] together to do the same thing they're
[2:12:16] Gathering and denominating themselves
[2:12:19] each one trying to beat the other
[2:12:25] I was one of the other definitions on
[2:12:27] Pride I I left those little notes in on
[2:12:30] my desk there and I didn't bring it out
[2:12:33] but it's okay on this Pride it's usually
[2:12:36] a flex it's comparing themselves with
[2:12:40] someone else too it's not just it's not
[2:12:43] just them being who they are they've got
[2:12:47] to now be better than someone else see
[2:12:51] because their desire is ill-gotten so it
[2:12:54] will never be full it's Inc it's
[2:12:57] corrupted if they would just be who they
[2:12:59] are you can be satisfied with who you
[2:13:02] are but when you're competing and trying
[2:13:05] to take what Michael had
[2:13:07] and you're trying to build something
[2:13:09] bigger and better than the other
[2:13:11] denominations have this is Lucifer's job
[2:13:15] he comes down in Pride I want let's take
[2:13:18] a scripture here quickly I don't know
[2:13:19] how this will tie in but I I want to
[2:13:21] read this this came to me this week
[2:13:23] Ezekiel 28.
[2:13:28] it's believed about where I want to take
[2:13:30] Ezekiel 28.
[2:13:33] in verse 1 through 10 I think it talks
[2:13:35] about this
[2:13:37] Prince we've always look at verse 11 and
[2:13:42] 12 and 13 about the the king of Tyra how
[2:13:46] he's been in Edom the precious stones
[2:13:49] but look at look at in in Ezekiel 28 and
[2:13:53] verse 1 it said verse two son of man
[2:13:56] saying to the prince of Tyrus thus say
[2:13:59] the Lord God because thy heart is lifted
[2:14:03] up
[2:14:04] and thou has said I am a god
[2:14:07] I sit in the seed of God in the midst of
[2:14:10] the Seas yet thou art a man and not God
[2:14:15] though thou set thy heart as the heart
[2:14:17] of God behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel
[2:14:21] there's no secret then they can hide
[2:14:24] from thee with thy wisdom and with thy
[2:14:27] God
[2:14:28] without thine understanding thou has
[2:14:31] gotten these riches has gotten gold and
[2:14:33] silver into thy Treasures by that great
[2:14:36] wisdom and by that traffic has thou
[2:14:38] increased thy riches thy heart is lifted
[2:14:42] up because of thy riches therefore thus
[2:14:45] saith the Lord God because thou has set
[2:14:48] thy heart as the heart of God behold
[2:14:51] therefore I will bring strangers upon
[2:14:55] thee the terrible of the Nations and
[2:14:57] they shall draw their swords against the
[2:14:59] beauty thy wisdom and they shall defile
[2:15:02] that brightness they shall bring thee
[2:15:04] down to the pit thou shall die the death
[2:15:07] of them that are slain in the midst of
[2:15:09] the Seas without yet say before him that
[2:15:13] slate Thee I am God
[2:15:15] but thou shall be a man and know God
[2:15:19] in the hand of him that slayeth thee
[2:15:22] thou shall die the deaths of the
[2:15:24] uncircumcised by the hand of the
[2:15:26] strangers for I have spoken it says the
[2:15:30] Lord
[2:15:32] the Lord is rebuking this Prince
[2:15:35] because he lifted himself up like he is
[2:15:38] a god even lifted himself up against who
[2:15:43] Daniel was Daniel had the spirit of the
[2:15:46] Gods in him God made Daniel who he was
[2:15:50] he is a prophet he saw Visions the
[2:15:53] nation recognized it God made him that
[2:15:55] Daniel didn't make himself that that
[2:15:58] would be different a man can't make
[2:16:01] himself anything
[2:16:03] you are who you are
[2:16:05] the problem comes when you try to be
[2:16:07] something that you are not
[2:16:10] and then in your heart you lift yourself
[2:16:13] up above this is why people you know
[2:16:16] they're scrapping claw for positions on
[2:16:19] the job
[2:16:21] they'll see other people come with gifts
[2:16:23] and talents and selling them
[2:16:25] appreciating those and working with
[2:16:27] those they feel threatened by it because
[2:16:29] it's a competition now
[2:16:31] you got another churches growing or
[2:16:33] another church is another Ministry is
[2:16:35] coming up another and then you start
[2:16:37] feeling the flex you start feeling the
[2:16:40] threat because you got your eyes on the
[2:16:42] wrong thing
[2:16:44] you're supposed to be serving the God
[2:16:47] who brought you here and in that service
[2:16:50] we're preparing our hearts for the
[2:16:53] greatest event that our lives will know
[2:16:55] that's the Rapture amen
[2:16:58] we don't want to get that Focus off of
[2:17:00] our mind
[2:17:01] but this Pride
[2:17:04] it's a horrible thing it it sits it sets
[2:17:08] this message God hiding in Simplicity
[2:17:10] brother Branham brings that before he
[2:17:13] brings the great revelation of the Seven
[2:17:15] Seals
[2:17:17] brother Brianna preach the message Pride
[2:17:20] and he talks about that woman that
[2:17:22] brought the alabaster box
[2:17:25] how Simon invited him to his house
[2:17:29] and didn't wash his dirty feet
[2:17:32] if you listen to the tape brother Venom
[2:17:33] gets all emotional
[2:17:35] it's like he gets into character of the
[2:17:38] woman
[2:17:39] and he actually sees Jesus with dirty
[2:17:42] feet
[2:17:44] this is where you can preach this is
[2:17:46] when you can pray this is when you can
[2:17:48] live when you get into character of what
[2:17:51] you are reading about it's not a story
[2:17:53] it becomes a reality and he was weeping
[2:17:58] Jesus with dirty feet
[2:18:00] but here comes a woman now
[2:18:03] she's an ill-fained woman
[2:18:06] prostitute
[2:18:08] and she makes her way to Jesus finds his
[2:18:11] dirty feet and begins to cry and weep
[2:18:15] over his feet
[2:18:18] she begins to kiss his feet
[2:18:20] I want you to look at that just for a
[2:18:22] moment that's that's a pretty that's a
[2:18:24] pretty
[2:18:25] I mean
[2:18:27] a woman kissing this man's feet
[2:18:31] She's kissing the right feet though
[2:18:34] and Simon there said if he knew what
[2:18:37] kind of woman she was this is the
[2:18:39] religious people the Pharisee religious
[2:18:42] people they know the Bible they know
[2:18:44] Moses they know all the laws all of them
[2:18:48] their knowledge on the word ain't the
[2:18:50] problem their pride is the problem
[2:18:53] their pride will lift you up to where
[2:18:57] you can't identify with people who ain't
[2:19:00] you
[2:19:02] you cross the street when you see
[2:19:04] something different
[2:19:05] you cross the street when you see
[2:19:07] something threatening I'm a priest I
[2:19:08] can't touch nothing dirty I came you
[2:19:10] know I gotta I'm on my way to pray I
[2:19:12] can't be late for prayer meeting I'm not
[2:19:13] gonna stop with this sinner and help him
[2:19:17] I'm too busy trying to serve God
[2:19:21] why would I spend my time on a sinner
[2:19:23] when I'm trying to serve God
[2:19:28] if he knew what kind of woman she was
[2:19:34] he wouldn't let her be washing his feet
[2:19:35] and Jesus caught it he picked it all up
[2:19:37] he catches it all this woman is kissing
[2:19:40] him kissing his feet her hair falls down
[2:19:44] the only Glory that she has she begins
[2:19:47] to wipe
[2:19:49] his feet with the tears that flow from
[2:19:51] her heart
[2:19:53] and she she gets the most expensive box
[2:19:57] of oil alabaster box of oil
[2:20:01] she purchases it
[2:20:03] and she brings out alabaster box of oil
[2:20:06] and breaks it open and begins to anoint
[2:20:10] his feet kisses feet and with tears
[2:20:14] she's just weeping and crying what a
[2:20:16] sight
[2:20:18] and brother random brings that over to
[2:20:20] today and how we the religious people
[2:20:23] we're so we're so religious
[2:20:27] that for us to do that that's not our
[2:20:30] job to do that that's for the foot wash
[2:20:32] flunky they're supposed to wash his feet
[2:20:35] that's where those newcomers the altar
[2:20:37] is not for old-time Elders altars for
[2:20:40] newcomers
[2:20:41] officers for Sinners I mean like real
[2:20:43] Sinners not like us like real sinners
[2:20:46] but you see that's the spirit that's an
[2:20:48] attitude that's Pride
[2:20:51] and if they're ever was a group of
[2:20:53] people that could get lifted up in Pride
[2:20:57] it would be the people that followed
[2:21:00] this word because this word is the truth
[2:21:06] you had a greater opportunity to get
[2:21:08] caught into Pride
[2:21:11] so what do we do we want to stay humble
[2:21:12] don't we
[2:21:13] God hides in that simplicity
[2:21:16] and we're looking for this great event
[2:21:19] of the Rapture to take place and here
[2:21:23] Pride will get in our way
[2:21:26] that's why we have to have faith virtue
[2:21:29] knowledge temperatures in all of those
[2:21:30] virtues
[2:21:32] and then the love of God seals it
[2:21:36] he begins the message if you remember
[2:21:39] isn't one of these long really heavy
[2:21:43] heavy messages Christ is the mystery of
[2:21:46] God revealed he begins the message with
[2:21:49] a word to the church how many remember
[2:21:50] that
[2:21:52] huh time to remember that a word to the
[2:21:55] church remember love one another
[2:21:58] no matter what
[2:22:02] Satan will come among you and then at
[2:22:04] the end of the message he ends it again
[2:22:06] with the warning of loving one another
[2:22:11] hmm
[2:22:14] let me finish this message here
[2:22:17] what the prophet of God says here
[2:22:19] in this message God's
[2:22:22] uh trying to do God a service without it
[2:22:24] being as well one two three a couple
[2:22:26] quotes here and then
[2:22:30] and then we will let you go all right
[2:22:34] all right paragraph 259 trying to do God
[2:22:37] of service without it being his will he
[2:22:39] says there won't be any denomination
[2:22:41] just remember for the Jack's here he's a
[2:22:44] historian many of you are there's never
[2:22:46] been a Revival but about three years
[2:22:48] after the Revival they started a
[2:22:51] denomination on it is that right
[2:22:53] and this great miracle move of God in
[2:22:55] the last days it's went 20 years it's a
[2:22:58] million miles from a denomination going
[2:23:01] further away all the time the Shucks
[2:23:03] pulling away no cooperation no nothing
[2:23:06] with it see always it pulls away from it
[2:23:10] there can't be no more it's a week now
[2:23:13] but we're plenty of green mm-hmm
[2:23:17] that's right we have to have to lay in
[2:23:19] the presence of the sun to be mellowed
[2:23:22] up
[2:23:23] that's all of it plenty green we haven't
[2:23:25] got what the sincerity
[2:23:30] the sacredness yes the thing we ought to
[2:23:33] have in our midst to know that the
[2:23:36] spirit of the Living God is moving his
[2:23:39] word is showing us the things yet
[2:23:42] God's provided place of worship he
[2:23:44] continues paragraph 40 he says I believe
[2:23:47] the church is beginning to hear the
[2:23:49] message
[2:23:50] I begin and begin to understand but
[2:23:53] friends listen we've got to lay in the
[2:23:55] presence of the sun we've got to be
[2:23:58] ripened our faith isn't right
[2:24:03] intellectually we're hearing the message
[2:24:06] that God has given us in seeing the
[2:24:09] signs that he showed us and proving it
[2:24:11] by the Bible it's there but oh how the
[2:24:15] church needs to lay in his presence till
[2:24:19] it tenders up you know and gets sweet in
[2:24:23] the spirit so they can be so it can
[2:24:25] bathe down
[2:24:28] sometime in speaking the message you get
[2:24:30] harsh you have to break it like that
[2:24:31] because you got to clench a nail to make
[2:24:34] it hold
[2:24:35] but when the church once gets it the
[2:24:38] elected is called out and separated then
[2:24:41] in the presence of God I know it'll be
[2:24:44] something like the people was there when
[2:24:48] it takes its rapture
[2:24:51] praise the Lord
[2:24:53] don't you love the Lord
[2:24:55] hear this quote here in the message all
[2:24:57] things
[2:24:59] like just recently when our movements
[2:25:01] got started God begins to adding
[2:25:03] something to them and went off with it
[2:25:05] and made a tradition out of it lost its
[2:25:07] power instead of bringing Brotherhood
[2:25:09] together it's separated Brotherhood you
[2:25:12] do it sometime just for tradition
[2:25:14] without the sincerity of it he got to
[2:25:18] enter the Feast of God with sincerity no
[2:25:22] real sincerity no real sorrow for sin
[2:25:26] people come up to the Altar and many of
[2:25:28] them take a lot of music a little
[2:25:31] dancing clapping of the hands maybe run
[2:25:33] up and down the aisle maybe just speak
[2:25:35] with tongues now I believe in speaking
[2:25:37] in tongues I believe in running up and
[2:25:39] down the aisles I believe in clapping
[2:25:41] other hands but if there isn't some
[2:25:44] feeling behind there if there some
[2:25:48] sincerity that Jesus Christ has cleansed
[2:25:50] you not doing it because Miss Jones did
[2:25:53] it but doing it because there's
[2:25:55] something in you pulsating
[2:25:58] the sorrow for your sins and the joy of
[2:26:02] the victory that you share in the
[2:26:03] resurrection of your for of your
[2:26:05] sacrifice the evidence of your eternal
[2:26:08] security how can you not be sincere in
[2:26:13] that amen
[2:26:16] oh my
[2:26:19] we want that sincerity don't we
[2:26:22] need that mellowness
[2:26:25] that sweetness
[2:26:27] we need that humility
[2:26:30] we need that Pride taken away from us
[2:26:35] Lord Purge me and Purify Me
[2:26:38] of how I think how good of a Preacher I
[2:26:42] think I am or good of a Christian I
[2:26:44] think wait till they meet me wait till
[2:26:47] they hear me say it wait to hear my
[2:26:49] testimony wait wait till you know what
[2:26:51] that's just a wrong view of yourself
[2:26:54] ain't about you
[2:26:56] there's nothing to do with you it's
[2:26:59] about what he did
[2:27:01] he had a purpose and that purpose was to
[2:27:04] save you and that's the only reason why
[2:27:06] you're saved because he purposed it
[2:27:09] within himself
[2:27:11] don't that make you thankful
[2:27:13] don't that make you grateful doesn't
[2:27:16] that make you appreciative
[2:27:19] doesn't that make you want to share that
[2:27:21] with someone else
[2:27:23] that he can do that for if he can do it
[2:27:25] for you
[2:27:27] um he could do it for them
[2:27:29] and we know
[2:27:31] I won't get into it this morning but we
[2:27:33] know that Satan has launched
[2:27:35] this great attack brother Branham says
[2:27:39] he is howling
[2:27:41] because
[2:27:43] because
[2:27:46] of this great work that God is doing in
[2:27:49] you and I you know that woman that was
[2:27:51] washing Jesus's feet
[2:27:53] brother Branham said that
[2:27:56] you know Jesus could ruin his reputation
[2:28:00] with that woman yeah yeah and then
[2:28:02] brother random comes back and says no
[2:28:05] he makes his reputation with sinners
[2:28:09] it's the Sinners that makes him famous
[2:28:15] it's the Sinners The Sinner that needed
[2:28:17] to be saved is what elevates that he's a
[2:28:21] savior
[2:28:22] and when he told that woman those words
[2:28:25] your sins
[2:28:27] are no more
[2:28:29] I don't know what greater words a human
[2:28:31] being would want to hear from the god of
[2:28:33] creation your sins which are many are
[2:28:37] all gone they're no more he had the
[2:28:40] power to tell her that and he told her
[2:28:42] that look at her broken Spirit look at
[2:28:44] her knowledge or whatever look at her
[2:28:46] history look at her you know she wasn't
[2:28:47] perfect she didn't have all the history
[2:28:49] of other believers she her life was all
[2:28:51] messed up she got but she got this right
[2:28:54] she got this right
[2:28:56] she saw Jesus with dirty feet
[2:28:59] she got the most valuable thing she
[2:29:01] could get
[2:29:02] she brought it to him and we're
[2:29:04] preaching about her this morning
[2:29:07] and that's the way it goes
[2:29:10] that's a God that we serve
[2:29:12] faith for a Rapture rapturing Faith
[2:29:15] that's what the age requirement is Faith
[2:29:19] for this great that's the next move
[2:29:21] Saints and God will give that to us if
[2:29:25] we stay humble and stay with us word God
[2:29:27] bless you let us pray
[2:29:30] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[2:29:32] word this morning
[2:29:33] we thank you for these Saints and these
[2:29:35] Believers that have come
[2:29:37] we commit our ways to you Lord we commit
[2:29:40] these words that were spoken
[2:29:43] to think of your great
[2:29:45] promise the power that you have
[2:29:49] Unleashed Upon Us Lord you
[2:29:52] you made us your Victory we're the prize
[2:29:55] that you fought for at Calvary
[2:29:58] we're the reason that you took the
[2:30:01] stripes on your back
[2:30:03] we're the reason you came down to redeem
[2:30:07] Fallen men
[2:30:08] that we can be put right again to be put
[2:30:13] back in place like Adam
[2:30:16] as a as a man of authority Lord and
[2:30:18] we're coming to that place of redemption
[2:30:22] oh God
[2:30:25] I just thinking how
[2:30:28] you stand in the shadows of our life
[2:30:33] influencing us
[2:30:35] and we can't even see it
[2:30:39] until finally our eyes come open like
[2:30:42] the man in the pig pen
[2:30:45] he came to himself
[2:30:47] he recognized that he has a father
[2:30:52] that his father had
[2:30:54] riches that land he had a Heritage he
[2:30:57] had an inheritance and he recognized
[2:31:00] that you know
[2:31:02] I don't deserve even a room I don't
[2:31:06] deserve even the status to be a son of
[2:31:10] such a great father
[2:31:13] but maybe I can go back home
[2:31:16] and I'll just work for that
[2:31:19] as a servant
[2:31:20] I don't deserve it but I sure need it
[2:31:23] I'll I won't come back entitled I'm the
[2:31:27] son I'm your son I got your last name no
[2:31:30] no I'll go back as a servant
[2:31:34] and I'll just try to work
[2:31:37] for him
[2:31:38] and it's in that humility it's in that
[2:31:41] Brokenness that you'll never turn or
[2:31:44] broken in a contrite heart
[2:31:46] Lord I've seen it so many times
[2:31:50] seated so many times
[2:31:53] man or woman
[2:31:55] they'll somehow just come to themself
[2:31:57] and they realize they deserve nothing
[2:32:01] you owe them nothing
[2:32:04] and they'll make that turn to you
[2:32:07] and you're standing there with your Arms
[2:32:10] Wide Open
[2:32:11] all along all the time waiting for them
[2:32:16] to make that turn in their life
[2:32:20] and they run off and they're doing
[2:32:21] whatever they're doing there's doing
[2:32:24] their secret sin they're running
[2:32:27] not many people know about it
[2:32:30] and so they keep running but you're
[2:32:32] standing there with your Arms Wide Open
[2:32:36] waiting for them to Humble themselves
[2:32:38] and say Lord I can't do it I can't do it
[2:32:41] anymore
[2:32:42] I need your help
[2:32:45] I'm running back to you Lord
[2:32:47] and this man
[2:32:49] turns back to head to his father's house
[2:32:53] it is Father sees him from afar
[2:32:56] and his father doesn't judge him
[2:33:00] his father doesn't have a rules or
[2:33:02] regulations for him his father was so
[2:33:05] happy to see him
[2:33:07] that he leaves the house
[2:33:09] and he meets him halfway
[2:33:12] and brings his son back home
[2:33:15] kills a fat calf gives them the clothes
[2:33:18] that he needs washes him up puts them
[2:33:21] back in place again
[2:33:24] and we're trying to get put back in
[2:33:25] place
[2:33:26] like what Adam lost
[2:33:29] you're trying to put us put us right
[2:33:31] Lord set us right in our spirits
[2:33:35] in our humility the way we handle the
[2:33:38] word the way we handle other people the
[2:33:41] way we handle denominations and handle
[2:33:44] people who don't have a revelation where
[2:33:45] we handle a sinner girl or sinner boy
[2:33:49] the way we think about them people Lord
[2:33:51] put us right put our minds right again
[2:33:56] because that's the kind of people that
[2:33:58] makes the rapture
[2:34:00] and the Rapture in faith is wrapped in
[2:34:03] that
[2:34:03] I believe that lord it's in that
[2:34:05] humility
