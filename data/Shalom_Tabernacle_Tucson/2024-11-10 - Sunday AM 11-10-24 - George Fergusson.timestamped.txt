[5:01] you may be seated brother
[5:09] Brenan in the book of Exodus the 14th
[5:14] chapter and we want to read just a
[5:18] line uh two and then for a little text
[5:23] and my subject tonight is uh maybe a
[5:27] little
[5:28] strange and it's um I want to speak on
[5:31] the subject of divine love and Sovereign
[5:37] Grace and when Divine love has been
[5:41] projected and come to its end its
[5:45] destination Sovereign Grace will then
[5:47] take over and in the book of Exodus
[5:51] Moses and Moses said unto the people
[5:55] fear ye not stand still and see the
[5:59] salvation
[6:00] of the
[6:01] Lord that's for a
[6:03] text or scripture reading rather now
[6:08] we're faced in a day that when is
[6:13] prophesied to us that Brotherly Love
[6:18] would become a strange thing among
[6:20] people and it's to my humble belief that
[6:25] that is the greatest of all the gifts
[6:29] that there is is in God's Bible if the
[6:33] Lord Jesus should stand on the platform
[6:35] tonight and uh look me in the face and
[6:39] say I'm going to give you your choice
[6:41] you can be a great person of a great
[6:45] Minister I'll give you a gift of
[6:47] preaching the gospel or I'll give you
[6:50] the gift of teaching the word or I'll
[6:52] give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll
[6:55] give you the gift of Prophecy or I'll
[6:58] make you a prophet or or any of the fine
[7:01] Gifts of Faith any of the gifts that's
[7:03] in the Bible I'll give them everyone to
[7:07] you but then I will
[7:10] withhold love from you or either I'll
[7:14] give you love and withhold the gift from
[7:17] you I say Lord take all the gifts and
[7:19] let me have the
[7:21] love for no matter how many gifts we got
[7:25] they will never do us any good except
[7:28] the love of God is is the motive behind
[7:32] the gift we must have love and as I see
[7:37] this great day appearing that we're now
[7:40] living in were the selfishness and
[7:43] indifference amongst people human beings
[7:46] tribes of the earth it Grieves my heart
[7:49] and I would think of it in a different
[7:51] way if he hadn't have already said that
[7:54] this day would be here where they would
[7:57] be against each other and the things
[7:59] that take place and love would would be
[8:02] a strange thing in these days now did
[8:06] you realize that you being a person as
[8:09] you are that you're not altogether flesh
[8:12] you're spirit and flesh not only that
[8:15] but Jesus said that the Bible said that
[8:18] we are in a miniature way Gods the Jesus
[8:23] said that we are he said if that was
[8:26] prophets and so forth of the Old
[8:28] Testament that Jesus were was referring
[8:30] to said it is written your law that
[8:32] you're God and if he call them Gods who
[8:34] the word of God come to then why not
[8:36] himself being the Son of God when he
[8:39] makes himself equal with God
[8:42] now we are in an amateur way we are
[8:47] creators then I want to just talk to you
[8:50] from my heart now before the service
[8:52] because one a preach that upsets me
[8:54] these two different anointings one of
[8:56] them is for vision and the other is for
[8:58] the word
[8:59] and then if you go on to the word real
[9:02] hard and go to preaching then it the
[9:05] service you can't hold the vision so
[9:07] well it's two different gifts and if
[9:10] you're building your congregation on one
[9:12] and then turn it to another then it's
[9:15] you know what I mean so then but being
[9:18] that we're small and crowd yet we want
[9:20] to place it as much around the word as
[9:23] possible and then have a little healing
[9:24] service because of so many sick now did
[9:28] you ever see some someone that you just
[9:31] love to be around sure you have there's
[9:34] people that you meet and associate with
[9:37] that you just love to be around there's
[9:40] an air about them that you just love to
[9:43] associate with them and then there's
[9:46] fine people that you know of it's very
[9:48] fine people and yet there's just
[9:50] something about them that you just don't
[9:52] feel at home around them somehow you
[9:55] just you don't want to hurt their
[9:56] feelings they're your friends you love
[9:58] them but there's just a difference
[10:01] between them and this other person well
[10:03] what it is we create that atmosphere
[10:07] around us and now I'm a conservationist
[10:11] and of Wildlife and so forth and dealt
[10:15] with wild my mother is a half Char
[10:18] Indian and I I just love the wild Soul
[10:22] so I study God my first study of God was
[10:25] soon nature watching what he did in
[10:27] nature how he watches and what he does
[10:31] and there's one of the greatest
[10:33] hindrance that there is in the church
[10:34] today and right here at Edmonton and
[10:36] ever not Evon I didn't mean to say that
[10:39] I mean Prince Albert and um and among
[10:42] other peoples everywhere is
[10:45] fear but
[10:48] love perfect love castes out
[10:52] fear so you the reason you're you're
[10:55] fearful is because the
[10:58] right Temperance of love has never
[11:01] entered yet when there's real
[11:05] love all fear passes away right when you
[11:09] really love the Lord now I'm not
[11:11] condemning you I'm only trying to bring
[11:14] something to light that you could look
[11:15] at because after all if there's a these
[11:18] sick people sitting around and Sinners
[11:21] and so forth and the differences what
[11:23] makes it all I can't believe that God's
[11:26] pleased with it so there must be
[11:28] something remedy and if we can find that
[11:31] remedy we ought to use it so the thing
[11:34] it is it's a lack of love no matter how
[11:37] many prophecies we have how many great
[11:39] preachers how much theology we know how
[11:42] greater church that we belong to if love
[11:45] doesn't temper that together it's a non
[11:48] effect right and even in 1 Corinthians
[11:51] 13 Paul said go I speak the tongue of
[11:53] men and angels become as a sound Andra
[11:57] te symbol go I have prophet Y and
[12:00] knowledge and understand all the
[12:01] mysteries of God and have faith to move
[12:03] mountains and have not love I am become
[12:07] nothing so we people are more or less
[12:11] going after gifts instead of The Giver
[12:15] see we must come back to the place where
[12:18] you're wonderful people but you must
[12:20] come back first and the key that unlocks
[12:23] the door to everyone we've left the key
[12:26] and rush for the door so when you get
[12:28] there you find out the door don't open
[12:30] because you haven't got the
[12:32] key oh I've often said this that in my
[12:36] world travels I found two different
[12:39] classes of people one of them is the
[12:42] fundamental the group that I come out as
[12:44] Baptist positionally they know where
[12:47] they are that's right but they haven't
[12:49] got much Faith with it and then the
[12:51] other is
[12:53] Pentecostal they got a lot of faith but
[12:55] don't know who they are it's just like a
[12:58] man's got money to Bank you don't know
[13:00] how to write a check the other man
[13:01] hasn't got no money in bank yet he can
[13:03] write a check if you could get the two
[13:05] together you have
[13:08] it now what the church is Laing is
[13:12] divine
[13:14] love I don't mean affectionate love for
[13:18] one another I mean the agapa Love The
[13:21] Godly love and have it so richly in your
[13:25] heart until you just love the Lord
[13:29] and everything you just take his word
[13:31] for it you don't mistrust him my wife is
[13:35] setting present when we were married I
[13:39] took her to be my wife and promis to
[13:41] live faithful to her until death
[13:43] separated her and she promised separated
[13:46] us and she promised the same to me now
[13:49] it isn't a law when I leave and go
[13:52] overseas or somewhere be away a long
[13:54] time I don't have to go say now Mrs
[13:56] Brandon I'm going to lay down the law to
[13:58] you while I am gone I don't want you
[14:01] flirting with any other husband and I
[14:04] don't want you doing so and
[14:06] so I don't say that now she doesn't come
[14:09] to me and say Mr brand then I'll tell
[14:12] you you must not ft with any other wives
[14:14] and you mustn't do this or that we don't
[14:17] think
[14:18] that we just love each other when I get
[14:22] ready to go we kneel in the room and
[14:23] take hold of each other's hands and
[14:25] raise the other hand to God and say
[14:27] thank you Father for being so kind to us
[14:30] and for helping us and now we must
[14:32] separate because you said if you won't
[14:34] forsake wife children and all and cl
[14:37] after me you're not worthy to be my
[14:39] disciple and now father no matter what I
[14:42] would do I'm still not worthy to be your
[14:44] disciple but this is such a little thing
[14:47] that we can do but we're willing to do
[14:49] this little thing that for love that we
[14:52] have for you and we know you have for us
[14:55] when we get through praying I kiss her
[14:56] goodbye and say goodbye sweetheart she
[14:59] you say goodbye I'll be praying for you
[15:00] Billy that's says it no Thou shalt not
[15:04] and thou shalt nothing about it now when
[15:07] I'm out into the field and when I'm out
[15:09] there and yet I would know and I she
[15:13] don't have to worry about me I don't
[15:15] worry about her as long as I love her
[15:18] the way I do she'll never have to worry
[15:21] and as long as she loves me I'll never
[15:23] have to worry so we got confidence in
[15:25] each other as husband and wife that we
[15:27] love one another and that just settles
[15:29] it we don't we just go on the regular
[15:31] routine of life now even if I know that
[15:36] I could do something bad and get by with
[15:39] it and go tell her confess my sin and go
[15:42] tell her I've done wrong yet I wouldn't
[15:44] do it if she'd forgive me and say that's
[15:46] all right Billy I know it was a case of
[15:49] of this that and you've explained it to
[15:50] me I'll forgive you we just forget it I
[15:53] I still wouldn't do it because I love
[15:55] her too much to do that I I love her I
[15:58] would hurt her yet she'd forgive me I
[16:00] know it would scar her heart if I did
[16:02] something was wrong and if I think that
[16:05] was aial love of human love towards my
[16:08] wife how much more ought I to my
[16:11] savior no matter what would be this that
[16:14] I want to please him I want to love him
[16:17] and I want him to be able to say that's
[16:19] my servant I can tell him to go here and
[16:21] he'll do it and I want to say that's my
[16:23] Lord if he sends me here I'll go and
[16:26] that's what love is it's it's something
[16:29] that binds us with God and that takes
[16:31] all the fear now somebody come say Mrs
[16:34] brandom is not true to you I wouldn't
[16:36] believe it you couldn't make me believe
[16:38] it no sir for I have confidence in love
[16:40] I would say oh you reckon she is why
[16:42] will have to get my children no and I
[16:44] wouldn't believe it in the first place
[16:46] because I love her and as long as I love
[16:48] her that way I've got that confidence in
[16:50] her as a woman and no matter what you
[16:53] say the days of the medical tast God
[16:54] don't do this and God don't do that you
[16:56] just might as well save your breath I
[16:58] love him and I believe him and I takeen
[17:00] at his word so that settles it that's
[17:02] all God said so and if you can get to a
[17:05] place where you Lov him it'll cast out
[17:09] the fear that you have that he won't
[17:10] keep his word that's really true now
[17:13] Israel in our text tonight had come into
[17:17] a spot where God by his grace through
[17:20] his word had promised Father Abraham
[17:23] that his seed would sojourn in a Strange
[17:26] Land and among the strange people for
[17:29] 400 years they would be aliens but God
[17:32] then at the end of 400 years would bring
[17:35] them out when the time of the promise
[17:37] Drew nine as the pictures are text
[17:41] tonight there came a time that God's
[17:44] promise was not at hand and God will
[17:48] always keep his promise no matter how
[17:51] ridiculous it seems God keeps his
[17:53] promise do you believe that always keeps
[17:57] his promise and sometimes the most
[17:59] ridiculous way he does it now Moses had
[18:02] failed with all of his military training
[18:05] to deliver people he was trained up
[18:08] under Pharaoh under his mother's Bible
[18:10] teaching and he was to be a deliverer he
[18:13] trained up to take Pharaoh's place to be
[18:15] the great military leader of the
[18:18] powerful Nation who had all the world
[18:20] beat down and one day he thought it's
[18:23] time for me to go I got my ba my DD so
[18:27] I'll just walk out and take things over
[18:28] over and he slew an Egyptian and found
[18:31] out that he was out of the will of God
[18:33] and was a stranger to the land for 40
[18:35] years but one day back on the back side
[18:38] of the desert after 40 years passed and
[18:41] he was an 80y old man long whiskers and
[18:44] white hair hanging down from the ball
[18:46] spot on his head perhaps walking along
[18:48] there with a chain in his hand God met
[18:51] him in a burning bush because God keeps
[18:55] his
[18:56] tongue you see it yes God keeps his
[19:01] every
[19:02] Thom and God had brought Moses in the
[19:05] world to do the job and God was
[19:08] determined that Moses was going to carry
[19:10] out his
[19:12] PL so he gave him a different kind of
[19:16] schooling and I'm afraid tonight friend
[19:19] as I say it with respect and with
[19:21] reverence I'm afraid that we are giving
[19:24] the church the wrong kind of
[19:27] scoo We Are given him a schooling from
[19:29] the dead letter and not from an
[19:32] experimentalist standpoint of the new
[19:34] verse to meet the true and living
[19:36] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ who's just
[19:39] the same tonight as he was in the days
[19:42] gone
[19:43] by Moses in the light of that burning
[19:47] bush as you all know as Christian that
[19:50] Moses meeting the angel of the Lord in
[19:52] the burning bush he was better equipped
[19:55] in five minutes of talk with God face to
[19:58] face and he was the 40 years of training
[20:00] under a
[20:01] Theology and I say tonight with all
[20:04] respect here it is you might as well
[20:06] button up because it's coming look a man
[20:08] is better equipped to preach the gospel
[20:12] and to stand before the audience with 5
[20:15] minutes experience before almighty God
[20:17] and all the seminaries could hack out in
[20:20] a 100 Years of an experience
[20:23] right they something
[20:25] happens and sometimes it's ridiculous
[20:28] look at Moses scared running out of
[20:30] Egypt as hard as he could Out On The
[20:32] Backs side of desert looking behind him
[20:34] who is coming is Pharaoh going to catch
[20:36] him on the back side of the desert he
[20:38] went married this colored girl and had
[20:40] two children now in pray to go back to
[20:43] Egypt but in the presence of God and
[20:46] seen God's glory and God's glory was
[20:49] Divine Healing healed his hand with
[20:51] Leprosy and performed a miracle two
[20:53] different gifts he had and he performed
[20:55] this miracle and then let's take a look
[20:58] at Moses look how ridiculous it seems
[21:01] now this is for some of you people that
[21:02] believe that God don't do things
[21:04] ridiculous sometimes in your mind see
[21:07] the wisdom of the world is foolishness
[21:09] in the sight of God right that's right
[21:12] no matter how much wisdom you got you're
[21:14] still foolish in the sight of God and
[21:17] God's wisdom sometimes seems to be
[21:19] foolish to the human mind that's our
[21:21] contrary they are one to another look at
[21:24] Moses talk about something seem
[21:26] ridiculous now Moses run 40 years before
[21:29] as a Young Man trained to this very
[21:33] start with all the Egyptian Army behind
[21:36] him and everything else run from the
[21:38] presence of pharaoh and here he is 80
[21:41] years old with a stick in his hand look
[21:44] at him going down the next morning had
[21:47] his wife sitting on a mule with a child
[21:49] on each hip leaving a little old donkey
[21:51] the wind blowing on a sck and here he
[21:54] goes down the way to Egypt where you
[21:56] going Moses going down to Egypt to take
[21:58] over
[22:00] what going to do what I'm going down to
[22:04] Egypt to take over the greatest military
[22:08] nation in the world with the millions of
[22:11] armed man and chariots and the best of
[22:14] was in the world would be like going
[22:16] into Russia or some country like that
[22:18] today singlehanded going down to take
[22:21] over 80 years old wish is Bor to one
[22:23] side Le the you with a life with a child
[22:26] on CHP joging along the road where going
[22:29] down to egyp to take over but the
[22:32] beautiful thing he did
[22:34] it because God said so that settles it
[22:38] no matter how ridiculous it looks to you
[22:40] if God said so that settles it that's
[22:43] all no matter if it seems strange you
[22:45] say that they act strange they look
[22:47] strange they're peculiar sometimes God's
[22:49] people aren't peculiar he said they were
[22:51] he seems and they act peculiar to the
[22:53] carnal mind but one time come into the
[22:56] presence of that same Angel of the
[22:57] burning blood and you'll act the same
[22:59] way you you'll have a peculiar Lookout
[23:02] on things you say I ought to have seen
[23:04] that before I ought to know it but it's
[23:06] got to be a con converted mind now here
[23:10] we are at our text tonight how God wants
[23:16] to project to you his Divine s Grace now
[23:22] they' come out here's the Israelites
[23:25] they had listened to Moses reverently
[23:28] they had handed they had took the
[23:30] sacrificial uh lamb and had slain it
[23:33] Puck the blood on the PO open over the L
[23:37] of the door and on the door poost a sign
[23:39] of the cross as the death angel did not
[23:42] come to their home they had separated
[23:46] themselves from all of their possessions
[23:48] you know the trouble of it is we don't
[23:50] want to separate
[23:51] ourselves we don't like to do that but
[23:54] God wants us to separate we want mixers
[23:57] God won separate operator and you have
[24:00] to come out sometime and stand alone if
[24:02] you ever walk with God and so here's
[24:06] Moses now he's brought the children out
[24:08] they followed him and they're coming out
[24:11] and instead of going down to the land of
[24:14] the
[24:15] Philistines God thought if the people
[24:17] said if surely if they see War their
[24:21] hearts will faint and they'll learn back
[24:23] so he led them through the way of the
[24:26] Wilderness I'm so glad that God takes us
[24:29] through the Wilderness Journey there he
[24:32] can get us alone get out alone with God
[24:36] and this Wilderness experience isn't it
[24:39] strange how God leads us into great
[24:42] tribulations and
[24:43] trials look how those Israelites were
[24:46] laying look at the Waters of Mya and how
[24:50] that the Wilderness of sin and all the
[24:54] different places how the path of God
[24:57] leads
[24:58] some through the wat some through the
[25:01] floods some through deep TRS but all
[25:05] through the blood

[1:32:01] God well you can be

[1:32:09] and I really have to thank our brother
[1:32:11] Israel for inviting us in with my wife
[1:32:16] and brother Luke and sister
[1:32:19] Stephanie and really brother luk brother
[1:32:22] Lucas the ministry started to minister
[1:32:24] church and what a blessing to have him
[1:32:26] and S sister Stephanie here with
[1:32:28] us so I don't know if those Brothers can
[1:32:31] get the a little bit of water appreciate
[1:32:32] it and uh what a time we've been having
[1:32:35] just a jubilee I think my UHA the Lord I
[1:32:39] kind feel so happy that I was able to
[1:32:41] come and sit and listen and to hear
[1:32:45] Brother hadn't heard him for a long time
[1:32:49] brother
[1:32:50] um brother Ted bedle and what a message
[1:32:55] I his style of ministering really was
[1:32:58] just different and I just enjoyed it and
[1:33:01] I think I brother Paul what you brought
[1:33:03] was really special to all of us you know
[1:33:06] I remember uh the reason it really
[1:33:08] touched my heart so much is that this
[1:33:11] year is the first year that we
[1:33:12] translated the message Christianity
[1:33:14] versus
[1:33:15] idolatry and as we were translating it
[1:33:18] my mind was I was touched by some of the
[1:33:20] statements and I think brother Paul I
[1:33:23] was studing Israel brother Israel after
[1:33:25] of course I call him Israel because he's
[1:33:26] my son-in-law and you know we just love
[1:33:29] each other so much and we got so much
[1:33:31] Inc coming him and I and I really
[1:33:33] certainly duly thank the Lord because
[1:33:36] not because he's my son-in-law but I
[1:33:38] really believe he has a true revelation
[1:33:40] of this
[1:33:40] message and like I was mentioning uh
[1:33:44] brother Paul I was you know we working
[1:33:45] on that message in Christianity versus
[1:33:47] idolatry and says my this is just so
[1:33:50] outstanding because you know brother
[1:33:52] bandam explains what idolatry and stuff
[1:33:54] and see what Paul taking that and
[1:33:56] bringing it out and I I was talking to
[1:33:58] brother Israel here and telling him I
[1:34:00] said that took a lot of study and prayer
[1:34:02] that they be able to put that message
[1:34:04] together I think brother Paul must have
[1:34:06] spent a lot of time trying to put all of
[1:34:08] that together and to see you know what
[1:34:11] it means to all of us and you know as we
[1:34:14] see each other and we love each other we
[1:34:15] see Christ reflected in each other you
[1:34:18] know we kind of look over our little
[1:34:20] faults and you know you get with a
[1:34:22] brother you see all the little faults fs
[1:34:24] and you know the shortcomings and things
[1:34:26] you know we don't we look over that and
[1:34:27] we try to see what the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:30] is trying to accomplish in our lives and
[1:34:32] you know this morning I got up uh I was
[1:34:34] up at about 5:30 and was praying and I
[1:34:37] went back my spirit I went back into the
[1:34:39] service last night and I was praying to
[1:34:42] the Lord and saying father you know I do
[1:34:44] believe with all my heart that you
[1:34:45] wanted me to speak that to the church
[1:34:48] because you know brother Brandon
[1:34:50] mentions it and not to go back on it and
[1:34:52] I know I kept your little along and you
[1:34:54] know my wife Liz she's a good judge of
[1:34:57] of that you know sometimes she tell me
[1:34:58] she says FY but some of there she told
[1:35:01] me she says you know what she says last
[1:35:03] night was a little different she says
[1:35:05] the people were really enjoying it she
[1:35:06] says even even if you went a little long
[1:35:09] she said that was good that was needed
[1:35:11] and uh sometimes you know it's good to
[1:35:13] have a little encouragement you know
[1:35:15] we're human beings and to see the people
[1:35:17] say you you know what I mean you know
[1:35:19] brother LTI sitting here I love him so
[1:35:21] much and all the few and it's good to
[1:35:23] have a little encouragement sometimes
[1:35:25] but Billy part used to call it the
[1:35:27] pattern the
[1:35:28] flesh that's how he would describe it
[1:35:31] and sometimes you know he would talk a
[1:35:32] little bit about it and you know to have
[1:35:34] a little encouragement I had a few
[1:35:35] emails came in text messages of people
[1:35:39] back out of town that sent messages in
[1:35:41] saying that they listening in last night
[1:35:43] and what it meant to them to hear it and
[1:35:46] I I I thought about it and you know I've
[1:35:49] always wondered even for my own self if
[1:35:51] I talk not to you but even to my own
[1:35:53] self
[1:35:54] and you know I looked and I saw a little
[1:35:57] bit what brother Brandon mentioned I'm
[1:35:58] not going to go back into that message
[1:36:00] again we're going to hit something
[1:36:01] different and that's why I'm trying by
[1:36:04] the grace of God if he could help me to
[1:36:05] condense
[1:36:06] it and what what was it is this
[1:36:09] statement brother brandom made kind of
[1:36:11] It kind of It kind of continued in my
[1:36:14] mind you know where he says no man knows
[1:36:16] the things of God save the spirit of God
[1:36:18] and and he to whom the spirit of God
[1:36:20] reveals them we need to call on God for
[1:36:23] Revelation more than anything else in
[1:36:25] the world and I see a lack in the people
[1:36:29] and part of the reason is that this word
[1:36:30] revelation I do believe has been so
[1:36:33] misunderstood and because people is
[1:36:35] thinking well is it an understanding I
[1:36:37] have is it some kind of a you know a
[1:36:39] kind of a idea that somebody has because
[1:36:41] this is what we hear true and wrong all
[1:36:43] the time I have a revelation and stuff
[1:36:45] and then last night we went deep into it
[1:36:47] to show that you cannot have a
[1:36:49] revelation of something that God did not
[1:36:51] say it's not like a prophecy or
[1:36:53] something there's prophecies and stuff
[1:36:55] it has to be what God has brought so we
[1:36:59] read the quotes where brother bam says
[1:37:00] only one messenger for each age receives
[1:37:03] what God has to say to that age that is
[1:37:05] a pattern that runs from Genesis to
[1:37:07] Revelation all through the scriptures
[1:37:09] and then he says that he speaks to God
[1:37:12] speaking of the messenger in this age to
[1:37:13] the church is both true and false and
[1:37:15] then the message is broadcast to all as
[1:37:18] we read it last night and he says though
[1:37:20] it is broadcast to all he said it is
[1:37:22] received in a certain way and last night
[1:37:24] we went deep into that to show the way
[1:37:27] that the Believers receive it God has a
[1:37:29] pattern of how he does things and um we
[1:37:32] went deep into that I'm just rehearsing
[1:37:34] and repeating it to you whereas we have
[1:37:36] a lot of Brother s God revealed this to
[1:37:38] them and all these things will fade away
[1:37:40] and not be a part of Eternity it it be
[1:37:43] all in one brother have a revelation
[1:37:45] that will be it's like a a fruit that
[1:37:47] fell on the ground from the trees when
[1:37:49] you were in the air and it just rusts on
[1:37:51] the ground and people don't realize what
[1:37:53] does Prof us we got a little idea in our
[1:37:55] minds and we want to push it as the word
[1:37:56] of God and I mean I hate to say this but
[1:37:59] it's things that we have seen things
[1:38:01] we've heard TR he hears and we've seen
[1:38:03] the fruits of all of this and we don't
[1:38:04] want to be critical when we talk about
[1:38:06] these things so we want to look at the
[1:38:07] positive ends and of course you know we
[1:38:09] went deep into it and see that God has a
[1:38:11] manner a way that he gives us the
[1:38:14] Revelation and we went a little deep
[1:38:16] into it to show that first he brings it
[1:38:18] through that messenger that messenger
[1:38:20] caps all that God has for the age and
[1:38:23] the challenge to us is not to deviate
[1:38:26] like what God told Joshua he said stay
[1:38:28] exactly don't deviate to the left don't
[1:38:31] deviate to the right so therefore it is
[1:38:33] not us it's not us trying to put our
[1:38:35] little you know two pieces into it our
[1:38:37] little ideas all little things into it
[1:38:39] the challenge to all of us as Believers
[1:38:41] is to stay with that and as we stay with
[1:38:44] it we open our hearts and we accept the
[1:38:46] Revelation just the way that God has
[1:38:48] given it to us we went deep into that
[1:38:51] last night and showed that we're here
[1:38:52] and even if you know we accept it like
[1:38:55] brother bam tell us he said even when
[1:38:56] Jesus stood there with the disciples he
[1:38:59] preached for six hours and prophecy
[1:39:00] being fulfilled he shared with them all
[1:39:03] the scriptures he says but all of that
[1:39:05] went over their heads you know you could
[1:39:07] sit there and hear it even if the Lord
[1:39:09] Jesus Christ himself is here speaking
[1:39:11] directly to you showing you all the
[1:39:14] scriptures but you see that's the first
[1:39:16] phase of it that's how he does it that's
[1:39:19] what's the first phase is to show you
[1:39:21] the Revelation by the scripture
[1:39:23] the promised word for your day the
[1:39:25] things that God has promised to you what
[1:39:27] he's going to give to you he does that
[1:39:30] and then the next step is you open your
[1:39:32] heart and you accept it and when you
[1:39:33] open your heart and you accept it
[1:39:35] brother brandom describes that in a very
[1:39:37] specific way he says then he gets into
[1:39:40] you he gets into you when you accept his
[1:39:42] word but still that's not enough you see
[1:39:45] because he cannot reveal himself until
[1:39:47] he gets into you how he gets into you is
[1:39:49] when you accept his word then you have
[1:39:51] invited him in then you begin to scry
[1:39:53] for Revelation more than anything else
[1:39:55] in the world then he gives you the
[1:39:56] Revelation because this because as the
[1:39:59] Bible says no man knowth the father save
[1:40:01] the Son and whosoever the son reveal it
[1:40:03] to him so people have taken these things
[1:40:05] too lightly there is no way for us to
[1:40:08] know God outside of a revelation see and
[1:40:12] then the Holy Ghost comes down and he
[1:40:14] reveals to you that which is already
[1:40:16] revealed it's not a new revelation it is
[1:40:18] a revelation of that which is already
[1:40:21] revealed and last night we we read those
[1:40:24] quotes we went deep into it and we saw
[1:40:26] that this is where we are right now and
[1:40:28] when that Revelation comes of course
[1:40:30] there's so much in it that we won't have
[1:40:32] time love is a revelation faith is a
[1:40:34] revelation the Rapture is a revelation
[1:40:36] the new birth is a revelation and all of
[1:40:38] that now let us what we're going to do
[1:40:40] is this we're going to change direction
[1:40:42] slightly from that and my subject this
[1:40:45] morning is the new creation of
[1:40:49] God uh this is a subject I've dealt with
[1:40:51] in three parts back home
[1:40:53] because of its importance um before
[1:40:56] coming out here and I want to try to
[1:40:59] share it with
[1:41:01] you and uh we want to we want to entitle
[1:41:04] it the the New Creation in us the
[1:41:08] creation of God in us and therefore
[1:41:11] we'll go a little deep into it of course
[1:41:14] there's no way to separate the word of
[1:41:15] God there's no way you could separate
[1:41:17] the word from the word and everything
[1:41:19] just ties up together because it's the
[1:41:21] word of God and it's a part of God so
[1:41:23] there's no way that we could separate it
[1:41:25] it all comes together and how grateful
[1:41:28] and honored we are for it and as I stand
[1:41:31] here before you all I feel it's
[1:41:34] all yeah thank you I appreciate that as
[1:41:37] we stand here this morning I feel a
[1:41:38] little bit like I say honored to be
[1:41:41] invited to be among you and trust the
[1:41:44] Lord that this will be a great blessing
[1:41:46] to all of you
[1:41:48] amen of course last night you were a
[1:41:50] little bit quiet on me and the church
[1:41:52] back home does me the same things
[1:41:53] sometimes and uh and sometimes I'm in
[1:41:57] congregations and they do the same thing
[1:41:58] with me and H and then brother Luke kind
[1:42:02] of said to me a few words to encourage
[1:42:03] me him and sister Stephanie and they
[1:42:05] were saying they well the people were
[1:42:06] really listening because sometimes you
[1:42:08] know you say amen and then you might
[1:42:10] miss something so of course you know so
[1:42:12] he said the people he said sometimes you
[1:42:14] know we listening he says and we we we
[1:42:16] want to get into it we want to see it
[1:42:18] see and then in our hearts as we leave
[1:42:21] the meeting we cry out to God we pray we
[1:42:23] ask the Lord to help us because if ever
[1:42:26] there is a time that the church should
[1:42:27] be crying out for Revelation it's now
[1:42:29] that's why the bride will be waiting for
[1:42:31] the revelation of the Rapture the
[1:42:33] Rapture is a revelation it's not if I
[1:42:35] would stand here and explain all the
[1:42:37] steps of the Rapture to you and you
[1:42:39] don't have the Revelation what is going
[1:42:41] to profit to you and that Revelation is
[1:42:42] Faith you see so anyway let's get out of
[1:42:45] that message last night let's get into
[1:42:47] this one and trust the Lord that it will
[1:42:49] be a blessing so at this time I know we
[1:42:52] be praying for you brother brother Bill
[1:42:55] and trust in the Lord we'll be expecting
[1:42:57] it we'll be coming tonight with a big
[1:42:58] bowl under our expectations that the
[1:43:00] Lord will just bless us and use our
[1:43:02] brother to his honor and to his glory
[1:43:06] amen let us all stand at this time as we
[1:43:08] go before him in prayer oh Lord God Of
[1:43:13] Heaven as we bow our heads before you
[1:43:17] we've heard the specialist Lord and what
[1:43:18] a blessing to hear the little children
[1:43:21] singing and to hear the without singing
[1:43:23] and to our brother Lord I don't know his
[1:43:27] name and stood here and Lord and he's
[1:43:29] sanging what a blessing what a gift
[1:43:30] you've given him to sing and you're in
[1:43:33] songs and how we great how we grateful
[1:43:35] we are for it but Lord as we come into
[1:43:38] this portion of the SC of the word oh
[1:43:40] God heaven let it not be me that I'll
[1:43:43] Stand Here Lord glorify any man or
[1:43:45] anything of this type Lord you know
[1:43:47] that's not our motives it's not our
[1:43:49] objectives lord it's not what we want to
[1:43:51] achieve or we want Lord is to please you
[1:43:55] it's the Cry of our hearts and this
[1:43:58] morning we're going to approach a very
[1:43:59] another very vital subject and that you
[1:44:02] brought through the scriptures you want
[1:44:04] us to know these things you wanted to
[1:44:06] reveal it to us Lord and I I just pray
[1:44:10] Lord that it will be a jubilee for this
[1:44:12] little church that at the end of the
[1:44:14] meeting Lord we can all say that we've
[1:44:15] had a Revival together sir oh god of
[1:44:18] Heaven Let It Be and a pastor here
[1:44:21] brother Israel oh God bless him the
[1:44:23] pastors around Lord may you bless them
[1:44:26] and we certainly thank you Lord and pray
[1:44:28] that you continue to bless brother Paul
[1:44:30] Lord his ministry see his dear wi sister
[1:44:33] hly here with us and the ministry Lord
[1:44:35] knowing that each Minister goes through
[1:44:37] that gets sem many experience that
[1:44:40] Calvary it's hard the better Cup oh lord
[1:44:44] it's just so hard but we know that after
[1:44:47] all it brings the the fruits it brings
[1:44:50] something under the scene it makes us
[1:44:51] what we should be oh God we just honor
[1:44:54] you you you're God you know what to do
[1:44:56] Lord you know how to lead you know how
[1:44:59] to take a a brother or sister this year
[1:45:01] in the meeting Lord and heartbroken and
[1:45:03] heartaches and trials and different
[1:45:05] things and mold it into your own image
[1:45:07] and Glory as we look to you in Jesus
[1:45:09] name amen now I'm going to uh this
[1:45:14] subject like I mentioned we start
[1:45:16] subjects and I think brother Paul made a
[1:45:19] statement I kind of liked when he said
[1:45:21] that he doesn't want to finish his
[1:45:23] message because the real truth of it is
[1:45:25] you could never finish a sermon you know
[1:45:27] it's so hard if it's really the Holy
[1:45:29] Spirit there's no way to be able to
[1:45:31] finish it up amen it just goes on and on
[1:45:33] and on and on and on and therefore H
[1:45:36] this message on the new creation there's
[1:45:38] so much in it that I think um we will
[1:45:41] start a little bit on it and I'm sure
[1:45:43] that there's material here to go on for
[1:45:45] just months and months and months in it
[1:45:48] but I I got many many several scriptures
[1:45:51] but we will take First Kings chap 19
[1:45:54] verse 9-13 of First
[1:45:57] Kings First Kings chapter 19 verse
[1:46:01] 913 and he came thither under a cave
[1:46:05] he's talking about Elijah now and lodged
[1:46:07] there and behold the word of the Lord
[1:46:09] came to him and said unto him what doest
[1:46:13] thou here
[1:46:14] Elijah and he said I have been very
[1:46:17] jealous for the Lord God of hosts for
[1:46:20] the children of Israel have forsaken thy
[1:46:22] Covenant
[1:46:23] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[1:46:26] prophets with the sword and I even I
[1:46:29] only am left and they seek to take my
[1:46:32] life and they seek my life to take it
[1:46:34] away and he said go forth and stand upon
[1:46:38] the mount before the Lord and behold the
[1:46:40] Lord passed by and a great and strong
[1:46:43] wind rent the mountains and break in
[1:46:46] pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the
[1:46:48] Lord was not in the wind and after the
[1:46:51] wind and earthquake but the Lord was not
[1:46:54] in the earthquake and after the
[1:46:56] earthquake a fire but the Lord was not
[1:46:59] in the fire and after the fire a still
[1:47:02] small voice do you know where that SM
[1:47:04] still Small Voice
[1:47:08] was
[1:47:12] huh do you know where it was brother bam
[1:47:15] says it's spoken Elijah's
[1:47:18] heart it was not a voice out there and
[1:47:20] he said that still Small Voice speaks in
[1:47:22] your heart
[1:47:24] Elijah heard the voice in his
[1:47:30] heart
[1:47:31] amen amen wonderful isn't he that's what
[1:47:35] I want I want the voice in my
[1:47:38] heart some want the voice only on the
[1:47:40] tape I don't blame them if that's how
[1:47:42] they feel but I want that voice in my
[1:47:44] heart let him speak in my heart sir let
[1:47:47] it come from the tape in my
[1:47:50] heart sir oh are we all feel that way
[1:47:53] don't we am all right God bless you all
[1:47:56] let's continue here and it was so when
[1:47:59] Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face
[1:48:02] in his mantle and went out and stood in
[1:48:04] the end of in of the cave and behold
[1:48:07] there came a voice unto him and said
[1:48:09] what do is th here Elijah oh when he
[1:48:11] speaks in our hearts for a blessing all
[1:48:14] right now we're going to take another
[1:48:15] scripture here of Jeremiah chapter 29
[1:48:18] verse
[1:48:20] 13-4 and he shall seek me and find me
[1:48:23] when he shall search for me with all of
[1:48:27] your
[1:48:28] heart and I will be found if you sayith
[1:48:31] the Lord and I will turn away your
[1:48:34] captivity and I will gather you from all
[1:48:37] the nations and from all the places
[1:48:39] wherewith I have driven you sayth the
[1:48:41] Lord and I will bring you again into the
[1:48:43] place whence I cause you to be carried
[1:48:46] away
[1:48:48] captive and I want to take a scripture
[1:48:51] going back again in the Old Testament in
[1:48:54] the Psalms which is Psalm 14 from verse
[1:48:57] 2 to
[1:48:59] 3 Psalm 14 verse 2 to3 and the Lord
[1:49:03] looked down from heaven upon the
[1:49:04] children of men to see if there were any
[1:49:06] that did understand and seek God they
[1:49:09] are all gone aside they are all together
[1:49:14] become filthy there is none that do it
[1:49:17] good know not
[1:49:21] one Lord your word is so precious to
[1:49:26] us uh we see such value in every single
[1:49:31] word that come from your mouth Lord and
[1:49:34] we know that the challenge to us in this
[1:49:37] evil age is to stay with every word
[1:49:40] which you say and not be deviated under
[1:49:42] the for any consideration By Any Man any
[1:49:45] whatever comes Lord just help us father
[1:49:48] that we love our brothers we love our
[1:49:50] sisters we love everyone but help us
[1:49:53] father to to be what you want us to be
[1:49:56] to live by every word that come out of
[1:49:58] your mouth Lord and not to deviate from
[1:50:01] this message but to stay with everything
[1:50:03] you've said as we thank you in Jesus
[1:50:05] name amen you can be seated God bless
[1:50:09] you
[1:50:10] all now
[1:50:13] um what a blessing amen and we are
[1:50:17] grateful to him for
[1:50:20] everything that he has given to us
[1:50:25] amen all right now brother Brandon here
[1:50:28] to start with because we going I'm going
[1:50:30] to start straight to get to the to the
[1:50:32] get to the point as soon as as quick as
[1:50:34] I
[1:50:35] can in the five in the five
[1:50:38] identifications of the Church of the
[1:50:39] Living God brother brandham says
[1:50:43] here somebody said I sought God I sought
[1:50:48] God that's contrary to the Bible
[1:50:52] it's God seeking you not you seeking
[1:50:56] God God went up and down the Garden of
[1:50:59] Eden crying Adam where thou not Adam
[1:51:04] crying God where thou it was God crying
[1:51:08] Adam where thou now this song is a
[1:51:11] little bit contradictory to the way that
[1:51:12] we think because to many people that
[1:51:15] think well you know no no no brother
[1:51:17] Ferguson I seek God listen close now as
[1:51:19] we get into
[1:51:20] this okay because we don't want to just
[1:51:23] pull one quote and go off with it we
[1:51:25] want to see everything come together you
[1:51:27] see there's the reconciliation of the
[1:51:29] word with the word which we won't have
[1:51:30] time to go into this this morning
[1:51:32] brother bam continues message called
[1:51:34] Resurrection he says you say well bless
[1:51:37] God I tell you I got to seeking God no
[1:51:39] you never you never did seek God man
[1:51:43] never did seek God there's no such a
[1:51:45] thing as man seeking God did you know
[1:51:47] that God seek man that's right you said
[1:51:50] is that scriptural yes sir Jesus said no
[1:51:53] man could come to me except my father
[1:51:55] draws him first your whole nature is alt
[1:51:59] together against God and it has to take
[1:52:02] the Holy Spirit to first put that desire
[1:52:05] in there for you to linger after God is
[1:52:07] that right now we will be dealing a
[1:52:09] little bit with that as we go further
[1:52:11] okay all right so it takes the Holy
[1:52:13] Ghost now let's go a little further into
[1:52:15] this that no man seeks God of course we
[1:52:18] could take the scriptures if you
[1:52:20] want and read some more of the
[1:52:23] scriptures on this which of course not
[1:52:26] only in the Psalms but also Paul
[1:52:29] mentioned this in Romans chapter 3:
[1:52:34] 10-13 Paul mentioned as it is written
[1:52:36] there is none righteous no not one there
[1:52:39] is none that understand it there is none
[1:52:41] that seeketh after
[1:52:44] God we go a little further they all gone
[1:52:48] out of the way they together become
[1:52:51] unprofitable there is none that they at
[1:52:53] good know not one their truth is an open
[1:52:56] sepulture with their tongues they have
[1:52:58] used deceit the poison of ASP is under
[1:53:01] the lips now we may not have an idea for
[1:53:04] ourselves like that but the real truth
[1:53:06] of it is in our nature is human beings
[1:53:09] we do not have the nature to seek after
[1:53:11] God no so look at this look at this
[1:53:13] church here this this morning we've got
[1:53:15] the meeting look at the multitudes of
[1:53:17] people on the outside what are they do
[1:53:19] you think they want to seek God not at
[1:53:20] all it's not in man to do that
[1:53:23] but let's just go a little further so we
[1:53:25] can go a little deeper into this so you
[1:53:27] could see what we are saying now brother
[1:53:30] brandham here in the Hebrews here's what
[1:53:33] he
[1:53:37] mentioned uh praise the Lord ain't he
[1:53:40] good to
[1:53:41] rest y here it is this is important he
[1:53:46] said if you love him not a duty that I
[1:53:48] can't do this and I can't do that you
[1:53:50] love him too much to do it because he
[1:53:51] has chose you you never chose him he
[1:53:54] chose you you said I sought the Lord I
[1:53:57] sought the Lord no man seeks God it's
[1:54:00] God seeking him now listen to this you
[1:54:03] might be seeking a favor of
[1:54:08] him there's a difference between seeking
[1:54:11] a
[1:54:12] favor from God and seeking
[1:54:17] God you might be seeking a favor of God
[1:54:20] but God has to change your nature before
[1:54:23] you can even seek after him because
[1:54:25] you're a sinner you a pig that's right
[1:54:26] so it's not you it's what God has done
[1:54:29] for you it's God CH God has to change
[1:54:32] that nature in you for you to seek after
[1:54:33] him now we're going to go a little deep
[1:54:35] into that in a little bit but just
[1:54:38] before we do I want to share with you
[1:54:40] that there are things that comes from
[1:54:43] the Lord that is not the
[1:54:46] Lord and people run after these things
[1:54:49] that come from the Lord but it's not the
[1:54:52] Lord now we got an example here in the
[1:54:56] scriptures that we just
[1:54:59] read in First Kings where we see here
[1:55:03] Elijah was
[1:55:05] there and the Bible says if we going to
[1:55:09] go back and read it again in
[1:55:13] um 1 Kings chapter
[1:55:16] 19 and verse 11 and and he said go forth
[1:55:20] and stand upon the mount before the Lord
[1:55:22] Of course that voice was speaking in
[1:55:23] Elijah's heart we've got quotes upon
[1:55:25] quotes on that I'm not going to go into
[1:55:27] that area we're going to we're going to
[1:55:29] skip that and behold the Lord passed by
[1:55:32] and a great and strong wind went the
[1:55:34] rock the mountains and break in pieces
[1:55:36] the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord
[1:55:38] was not in the wind now here is a great
[1:55:41] Mighty Wind that came it rent the
[1:55:43] mountains it did all but it didn't
[1:55:45] attract the attention of Elijah brother
[1:55:46] bam said because Elijah knew that that
[1:55:50] wind came from the Lord but the wind was
[1:55:52] not the Lord so here is something coming
[1:55:56] from the Lord but it is not the Lord the
[1:56:00] Lord is not in
[1:56:02] it now here is where the believer has to
[1:56:06] be able to see the difference between
[1:56:09] God and the things that come from God
[1:56:12] favors that come from God blessings that
[1:56:15] come from God now we're going to go a
[1:56:17] little deep into that to show you the
[1:56:19] difference because it would help you in
[1:56:21] your walk with God there are times you
[1:56:23] approach God which is not wrong it is
[1:56:26] not script it's not unscriptural you ask
[1:56:28] God certain things but what you're
[1:56:30] asking God for are favors or things
[1:56:33] coming from the Lord You're not asking
[1:56:36] God for God you see there's a difference
[1:56:38] when you come to seek God and when you
[1:56:41] seek that which is coming from God amen
[1:56:46] amen you see the difference now we'll go
[1:56:49] a little deep into it so that you will
[1:56:51] see these these things coming from the
[1:56:53] Lord are not unscriptural sinful things
[1:56:56] they are scriptural things but they are
[1:56:58] not God
[1:57:03] exactly okay now let's go a little
[1:57:06] further we're just going to read Isa and
[1:57:08] then we'll go into that but the Lord was
[1:57:10] not in the wind and after the wind and
[1:57:12] earthquake imagine that a big wind
[1:57:14] coming into the church Oh Brother people
[1:57:18] would said boy that's the Lord
[1:57:22] the big wind oh we was in the church and
[1:57:24] a wind
[1:57:26] came and then an
[1:57:28] earthquake boy a big earthquake
[1:57:30] everything is shaking everything seems
[1:57:33] to be shaken when that earthquake
[1:57:36] hit and people get after that oh brother
[1:57:39] we had a big
[1:57:41] earthquake but the
[1:57:43] Lord was not in the earthquake so they
[1:57:45] run after to the wind they run after the
[1:57:48] earthquake and then a fire oh ATT tracks
[1:57:51] a lot of people with fires an attractive
[1:57:53] thing a building burning over the street
[1:57:55] there you see people standing look at
[1:57:59] it this is fire
[1:58:02] boy we had a big fire brother it swep
[1:58:06] the whole church that's
[1:58:09] wonderful but we have to ask one
[1:58:12] question was the Lord in the fire well
[1:58:15] brother Ferguson come on in scripture
[1:58:17] yes it came from the Lord yes the fire
[1:58:20] came from the Lord but the Lord was not
[1:58:23] in the
[1:58:27] fire
[1:58:29] now is to show you that there are things
[1:58:32] that you and I could come we could seek
[1:58:34] and we said this is God no that's not
[1:58:38] God that's something coming from the
[1:58:40] Lord I'm going to share with you one of
[1:58:42] those things
[1:58:44] quickly okay are you
[1:58:46] ready before we go further because I'm
[1:58:49] praying pray for me this morning because
[1:58:51] I I I want to try to
[1:58:53] hurry
[1:58:55] okay okay of course I don't think it's
[1:58:58] necessary for me to go back on all the
[1:59:00] scriptures because Paul dealt with this
[1:59:02] in 1 Corinthians 13 which we would look
[1:59:04] at in a little bit but brother showed us
[1:59:08] where the Pentecostals made their
[1:59:09] mistake because they ran after the gifts
[1:59:12] instead of The Giver they were not able
[1:59:15] to see the difference between the gifts
[1:59:18] and the
[1:59:19] giver but it's not just the Pentecostals
[1:59:21] that had this problem that's just one of
[1:59:24] the examples it's just one and of course
[1:59:27] I I'll go back to First Corinthians in a
[1:59:29] little bit because First Corinthians
[1:59:31] goes with this you see because this is
[1:59:33] the same thing that Paul is showing
[1:59:34] trying to show the difference between
[1:59:36] the favors of God and God now on this I
[1:59:40] need to share a scripture with you that
[1:59:42] you will see that what brother brandham
[1:59:44] is saying is exactly with the scriptures
[1:59:47] Paul deals with this problem in
[1:59:49] Philippians chapter 2 and verse 21
[1:59:53] okay now we're showing you first the
[1:59:55] negative side and then we're going to
[1:59:56] move into the positive side to see what
[1:59:58] God does for us in order because God has
[2:00:00] to do something for you and something
[2:00:02] for me in order for us to seek God
[2:00:04] because Jesus that said seek and he
[2:00:06] shall find so if he said seek and he
[2:00:08] shall find God expects you and I to seek
[2:00:11] but in order for you and I to seek God
[2:00:13] has to do something for us so it's not
[2:00:16] really you seeking or I seeking it is
[2:00:19] really what God has done for us so God
[2:00:21] has to do something for you you and
[2:00:24] yourself forget it you wouldn't seek God
[2:00:27] you will seek the favors of God you will
[2:00:29] seek the blessings of God he will seek
[2:00:32] that which come from God but not God now
[2:00:34] we'll deal with this as we go a little
[2:00:36] deeper Paul now speaking of this in
[2:00:39] Philippians chapter 2 and verse
[2:00:41] 21 the same thing what brother bam is
[2:00:43] saying he says for all seek their own
[2:00:48] not the things which are Jesus Christ
[2:00:52] so something that I want myself I want
[2:00:54] God to bless me I want this I want to
[2:00:56] speak in tongues I I want to give to
[2:00:58] preach I want a prophesy I want this I
[2:01:01] want that all these things are wonderful
[2:01:03] they're scriptural but they're not
[2:01:04] that's not the Lord okay so we could
[2:01:06] repeat that but then of course we all
[2:01:08] see that part of it but there's another
[2:01:11] part of it I want to share with you so
[2:01:13] it's not just the Pentecostal that went
[2:01:14] off on
[2:01:16] that there's another
[2:01:18] part okay are you
[2:01:20] ready and I want to share it with
[2:01:23] you now this might sound very very
[2:01:27] strange but it is true uh brother Ram
[2:01:31] speaking in the message now how can I
[2:01:37] overcome he says
[2:01:39] here I going to read a little further up
[2:01:42] he said it never showed him in the
[2:01:44] church until it come to loud this year
[2:01:48] and when he got to L this year he said
[2:01:52] he had excuse me when he got to laud
[2:01:55] year he had been put out of his church
[2:01:58] trying to get back
[2:02:00] in then brother bam goes on he said see
[2:02:04] justification never put him
[2:02:07] in as wonderful as justification is you
[2:02:11] could come to church and said Lord I've
[2:02:13] sinned against
[2:02:15] you I've done wrong Lord I shouldn't do
[2:02:18] these things please forgive me for it
[2:02:21] and you have a wonderful experience of
[2:02:23] forgiveness and God justify you it
[2:02:26] doesn't mean that God is in you that's
[2:02:28] correct you seeking something from the
[2:02:32] Lord I'm not hearing any amens
[2:02:38] here and then sanctification just
[2:02:41] cleanse the placei for
[2:02:43] him it doesn't mean he has come in
[2:02:46] it you now the church has put all the
[2:02:49] emphasis on
[2:02:50] sanctification and and what we call
[2:02:52] having a good
[2:02:56] spirit and you see people today they
[2:02:58] believe that if I'm stifi and I have a
[2:03:00] good spirit that's all it takes to be a
[2:03:03] Christian listen brother sister you're
[2:03:05] taking something from the Lord but that
[2:03:07] is not the
[2:03:13] Lord now if we look at the example in
[2:03:15] Esau and
[2:03:18] Jacob amen amen was a
[2:03:23] gentleman brother B says today the
[2:03:25] churches will choose Esau instead of
[2:03:27] Jacob what what was the difference Jacob
[2:03:29] was a
[2:03:31] cook the man was a
[2:03:35] deceiver look at the list of things that
[2:03:37] you can have against
[2:03:38] Jacob you could said here this guy did
[2:03:41] this he he cheated his father-in-law he
[2:03:43] did this he did that he even deceived
[2:03:45] his own father look at all the the man
[2:03:47] look what he was but God looked long
[2:03:49] from heaven and understand what did he
[2:03:50] say of Jacob he said Jacob I love you
[2:03:52] what did God see in Jacob that he loved
[2:03:55] because in Jacob there was a desire for
[2:03:58] God for God the birth light which was
[2:04:01] the Holy Ghost which was God he had that
[2:04:04] desire for God and that's what God saw
[2:04:07] in
[2:04:09] Jacob
[2:04:12] Hallelujah now we're going to go a
[2:04:14] little deep into that so you can see the
[2:04:16] favor so you see here's the brother he's
[2:04:18] put all the emphasis in being a good
[2:04:20] person
[2:04:22] that he could be a loving sweet
[2:04:25] person and he comes to the church and he
[2:04:28] prays for it and God gives it to
[2:04:31] him and it's not anything contrary to
[2:04:34] the word we want those kind of people in
[2:04:36] the church we don't want to we don't
[2:04:39] think in our mind to have Jacobs we want
[2:04:42] nice loving sweet people in the church
[2:04:45] people that have good spirit brother
[2:04:47] said that is laia they want to be good
[2:04:49] they want to have good things in them
[2:04:51] that's the spirit
[2:04:53] ofia it's not contrary to the word it's
[2:04:56] something coming from the
[2:04:59] Lord but that is not
[2:05:06] God this song is a little
[2:05:14] surprising because we put all the
[2:05:16] emphasis on
[2:05:20] that and we believe it and God forbid
[2:05:24] that I would ever say anything against
[2:05:25] it or any preacher will say anything
[2:05:27] against it how could you speak against
[2:05:29] the fire that came from the Lord you
[2:05:31] can't speak against the fire but the
[2:05:33] Bible is clear the Lord was not in
[2:05:37] it
[2:05:40] amen all right now let's go
[2:05:44] on so if we see the
[2:05:47] difference between the favors of God and
[2:05:52] God
[2:05:53] himself you see uh many of them run
[2:05:57] after the
[2:05:58] favor seeking the favors of God and the
[2:06:02] things coming from the Lord but it's not
[2:06:04] God to seek God God has to do something
[2:06:06] for you so let's go a little bit further
[2:06:08] now to see God doing something for us
[2:06:13] okay so brother bam is clear on that he
[2:06:16] said God has to change your nature in
[2:06:18] order for you to seek out to him so it's
[2:06:23] not just you and I making the decision
[2:06:24] in our hearts I'm going to give my heart
[2:06:26] to the Lord I'm going to I'm going to
[2:06:28] serve the Lord I'm going to this that
[2:06:30] decision is is get me right now I we're
[2:06:33] not against it but multitudes multitudes
[2:06:36] have made those decisions on belam where
[2:06:39] are they
[2:06:41] today some of them painted faces jel
[2:06:44] they cut their head they live like the
[2:06:45] devil but it doesn't mean that they
[2:06:47] didn't make a decision they made the
[2:06:49] decisions but what we have we come to
[2:06:52] the place right now where we understand
[2:06:54] it's more than that and we have to point
[2:06:56] the people in the direction where it's
[2:06:58] not their decision but is God what God
[2:07:01] is doing for them God has to come on the
[2:07:04] scene and do something for you and do
[2:07:06] something for me so all what we are
[2:07:08] doing is in vain until God steps
[2:07:11] in amen and when he steps in his brother
[2:07:15] his word it's a going to be anything
[2:07:16] show you to this message it's going to
[2:07:17] be word by word by word exactly now let
[2:07:20] me go a little
[2:07:22] further uh brother Brandon mentions here
[2:07:25] as we go a little further into
[2:07:33] this uh first I'm going to read for you
[2:07:35] just a couple of quotes quick on this
[2:07:37] okay now as long as there's something
[2:07:38] down in our hearts how many believes in
[2:07:40] Divine Healing all right then sure look
[2:07:43] as sure as there is a call down in here
[2:07:45] a desire to be healed of God by Divine
[2:07:47] Healing there's got to be a fountain
[2:07:50] open somewhere see before that creation
[2:07:53] could be in there that creation to make
[2:07:56] you desire that there has to be a
[2:07:58] Creator to create that creation is that
[2:08:01] right is that right well there's got to
[2:08:03] be a God then somewhere that's putting
[2:08:05] that desire in your heart the desire
[2:08:07] that and if he has put that desire there
[2:08:10] then there's got to be something out
[2:08:12] there to Def to fulfill that desire that
[2:08:14] you got okay now we'll go a little
[2:08:18] further on that in the message the queen
[2:08:20] of Shea because I want you to see here
[2:08:22] they see because the emphasis must shift
[2:08:23] from you to God as long as the emphasis
[2:08:26] is on you you're going to get nowhere
[2:08:28] the emphasis must shift from us to God
[2:08:30] it's not my desire it's what God has
[2:08:32] given me so then God give me the desire
[2:08:35] and God does it for me you all
[2:08:37] understand and he gives me that desire
[2:08:39] to seek after him now let's go further
[2:08:43] in the message the Queen of Sheba here
[2:08:44] brother mam says as long as human beings
[2:08:46] search and hunger and thirst calling for
[2:08:49] the power of God there's God got to be a
[2:08:52] power of God somewhere to respond to it
[2:08:55] before there could be a creation there
[2:08:57] has to be cre to be a Creator in their
[2:08:59] creating that creation and when a man
[2:09:01] longs to see God there's got to be a god
[2:09:04] somewhere that created that desire in
[2:09:12] him if the deeps quing to the Deep
[2:09:15] there's got to be a deep respond to that
[2:09:17] because the Deep had to be there first
[2:09:18] to create that call now when God create
[2:09:21] that desire in
[2:09:24] you oh brother let me read to show you
[2:09:27] how important that desire
[2:09:29] is that's a part of it's not just an act
[2:09:33] of a decision it is a work of creation
[2:09:37] God has created it in
[2:09:39] you very good amen all right it's a work
[2:09:44] of creation so it's not just you God
[2:09:47] come down you want to serve the Lord you
[2:09:50] want to do that which is right that's
[2:09:52] good I mean who who in their right mind
[2:09:55] W want to do that which is good you got
[2:09:58] people in the Catholics that the woman
[2:10:00] brother said the woman that becomes a
[2:10:01] nun she doesn't become a nun because she
[2:10:03] want to be a bad woman her motive is to
[2:10:05] be a good
[2:10:07] woman it's true he said Pharaoh Pharaoh
[2:10:10] was a kind-hearted
[2:10:13] man yeah Judas was not the kind of
[2:10:16] character you think he
[2:10:19] was Judas had such a good good attitude
[2:10:22] about him until the the disciples had so
[2:10:24] much confidence in him until they made
[2:10:26] him the treasurer it was not Jesus that
[2:10:28] made him the treasurer it was the
[2:10:29] disciples that made Judas the treasurer
[2:10:32] and he says no one knew he was the Judas
[2:10:35] no one knew
[2:10:38] it even the disciples asked Jesus who is
[2:10:41] this man that's going to betray you so
[2:10:43] you see church it's more than
[2:10:47] that you see it church it's going to be
[2:10:49] more than that now we're not here this
[2:10:51] morning looking around for the Jud the
[2:10:53] Judas is among us we don't have that
[2:10:55] kind of an attitude let's be like the
[2:10:57] disciples they trusted everything they
[2:10:59] trusted this man and made him the
[2:11:01] treasurer he had the bag and he was a
[2:11:03] thief the Bible called him a
[2:11:06] thief yes
[2:11:08] sir but not just a thief like Jud like
[2:11:11] like Jacob Jacob was a a crook but in
[2:11:15] his heart there was a cry for God Judas
[2:11:17] didn't have no cry for God in him
[2:11:20] [Laughter]
[2:11:23] this is what makes the difference
[2:11:27] church it's a huge
[2:11:29] difference when there's a cry in your
[2:11:31] heart for Revelation there's a cry in
[2:11:33] your heart for God oh brother it's a big
[2:11:36] difference between you having a cry for
[2:11:38] God and you having a cry for the favors
[2:11:40] and the goodness of
[2:11:42] God all right now we need to continue
[2:11:47] on now brother brandom as he goes into
[2:11:50] this
[2:11:52] I I think now we can move a little
[2:11:53] further on because I think now you begin
[2:11:55] to see the difference between God
[2:11:57] because God is the
[2:11:59] word when you begin to seek God you seek
[2:12:02] the word you want to live by the word
[2:12:04] you want the word of God in you father I
[2:12:08] don't want anything else but you I want
[2:12:10] you but to really have that desire in
[2:12:13] you God has to create it now here's what
[2:12:15] brother manam says putting the emphasis
[2:12:16] a little bit on the desire okay oh this
[2:12:20] is so nice I feel still good do you feel
[2:12:23] good about
[2:12:23] it all right now here this is something
[2:12:27] here that really is encourage me and I
[2:12:29] think it will encourage you all too
[2:12:31] sometimes we need a little bit of
[2:12:32] encouragement from the message don't we
[2:12:34] all right so let's see in in the
[2:12:35] Masterpiece message here's what brother
[2:12:36] bam
[2:12:37] says he says on the interview a few
[2:12:40] moments ago I was speaking to a person
[2:12:42] in the room that's present now and said
[2:12:45] but brother brandham I have so many
[2:12:47] things that I know that's wrong and a
[2:12:50] Godly little woman but man even said
[2:12:53] later on she was a Spirit-filled
[2:12:55] woman I said but but look sister you
[2:12:59] don't look at yourself praise the Lord
[2:13:01] and I know that I've heard brother
[2:13:03] Israel speak many time and he's really
[2:13:05] I've heard him once he was up out our
[2:13:07] church and he put a lot of emphasis on
[2:13:09] this on the fact of not looking at
[2:13:11] yourself not looking at you know your
[2:13:14] nature not looking at your faults not
[2:13:16] looking at you but rather looking at
[2:13:19] what he has done for you and he says
[2:13:21] here but look sister you don't look at
[2:13:23] yourself it's just what your desire
[2:13:27] is and what you what you try to do and
[2:13:31] if you really love the Lord you try to
[2:13:33] serve him with all your heart and then
[2:13:35] all your mistakes is hid in the blood of
[2:13:38] the Lord Jesus see he made a way now
[2:13:41] that desire is so important in you
[2:13:45] because the Bible says blessed is the
[2:13:47] man to whom the Lord will not impute sin
[2:13:50] and Better B I'm going on to express it
[2:13:52] he says he will not impute sin to you
[2:13:55] because you have no desire to do it so
[2:13:58] you are blessed you see he takes that
[2:14:01] worthy desire out of you puts his desire
[2:14:04] in you but then there is something else
[2:14:05] I want to share with you on desire just
[2:14:08] to touch this and I'm when I this this
[2:14:11] these quotes are quotes that you know
[2:14:13] you read it like there's something just
[2:14:14] like like an inspiration just seemed to
[2:14:16] pull you into it and then I says Lord I
[2:14:19] was in the back looking at it and
[2:14:20] reading and
[2:14:22] I no Lord I want to pull back from that
[2:14:25] inspiration trying to pull me here and
[2:14:27] go into this inspiration here for the
[2:14:28] message this morning but brother Bill
[2:14:30] this is nice here's what he says now you
[2:14:32] all hear it when he speak about the
[2:14:33] token message and what he said about it
[2:14:35] and I'm not going to spend much time
[2:14:36] Lord help me because I got to get into
[2:14:38] my message quick now under token message
[2:14:42] here's what he
[2:14:43] mentioned
[2:14:46] um
[2:14:48] o well just excuse me one second here I
[2:14:52] want to be sure I got this all taken
[2:14:54] care of because I could take a little
[2:14:57] bit more time on this excuse me you love
[2:14:59] him with all your heart don't
[2:15:01] you ain't he good to
[2:15:04] us all right yeah I think I got it
[2:15:06] written on here well if I don't that's
[2:15:09] all right I'll find
[2:15:10] it brother Brandon when he spoke about
[2:15:13] the
[2:15:14] token here's what he says in desperation
[2:15:19] he says now I'm sure or hope that you
[2:15:20] got what the token meant see the token
[2:15:23] is the sign that the blood has been
[2:15:26] applied that the price that's been asked
[2:15:28] required of God Jesus pray that price by
[2:15:31] shedding his own blood he did that then
[2:15:33] from his life came the Holy Spirit and
[2:15:36] when the blood is applied to you the
[2:15:38] holy spirit is a token that your price
[2:15:40] is paid God has received you of course
[2:15:43] last night we spoke a little bit about
[2:15:45] that when you accept the
[2:15:47] Revelation you accept it by faith
[2:15:51] the word comes in you then God accepts
[2:15:53] your faith and when God accepts your
[2:15:54] faith he reacts to that so you see the
[2:15:57] action of God to your faith the fact
[2:15:59] that you believe every every word of the
[2:16:01] message you've avoided all the
[2:16:02] Temptations to go into these
[2:16:04] speculations and all these explanations
[2:16:06] that are not coming from the prophet not
[2:16:08] from the Bible you've resisted all those
[2:16:10] Temptations and these reasonings and
[2:16:12] this and this and the other and you
[2:16:14] stayed with that word and then God
[2:16:15] accept your faith and when God accepts
[2:16:17] your faith the Holy Spirit God himself
[2:16:19] reacts to that then you see the action
[2:16:20] of God as God react to your faith of
[2:16:23] course we will not go into that this
[2:16:24] morning it's putting me into that it's
[2:16:26] pulling me constantly but I have to pull
[2:16:28] away from that now he says here God has
[2:16:30] received you and that's the token
[2:16:32] remember that's the that's the token and
[2:16:34] then we're going to go a little further
[2:16:36] down here to what
[2:16:41] um uh we're going to go a little further
[2:16:44] down here
[2:16:46] yes uh this one here in desperation then
[2:16:51] the life that was in Christ is the Holy
[2:16:53] Ghost not the third person but the same
[2:16:55] person in the form of the Holy Spirit
[2:16:56] coming upon you as a token that your
[2:16:58] life and your fair is paid you have been
[2:17:02] accepted this is one of the greatest
[2:17:04] things we can think of our life to know
[2:17:06] that I have accepted Jesus Christ is
[2:17:08] wonderful and this is what the
[2:17:09] denominations put the emphasis on and
[2:17:12] many preachers put the emphasis on the
[2:17:14] emphasis is not when you accept the Lord
[2:17:16] Jesus my brother sister the emphasis is
[2:17:18] when the Lord Jesus accepts you
[2:17:26] am he has accepted
[2:17:29] me amen I am I am now a part of his
[2:17:34] bride am I brother don't tell me I'm not
[2:17:36] the purpose I'm forget the name of my
[2:17:39] friend you now brother brother
[2:17:43] Jal see brother say you can accept him
[2:17:46] that's good but wait until he accepts
[2:17:49] you when he accept accepts you he
[2:17:51] accepts your faith then he gives you the
[2:17:53] Revelation and the only how he can
[2:17:54] accept you is not the flesh he accepts
[2:17:57] it's that word in you when you believe
[2:18:00] the entire word you accept the
[2:18:02] Revelation exactly what God has said and
[2:18:04] that's not enough you wait for him to
[2:18:06] accept
[2:18:07] you now we try to get away from that now
[2:18:10] brother B
[2:18:12] continues he
[2:18:14] says uh he said your affir is paid youve
[2:18:18] been accepted until that token comes you
[2:18:20] not permitted on the highway you're not
[2:18:22] permitted on the bus line you're not
[2:18:24] pered to go in until you can present the
[2:18:26] token and that token is your fair and
[2:18:29] now it shows that the blood has been
[2:18:31] shed and been applied to you the price
[2:18:33] is been applied to you and you have the
[2:18:35] token thus the blood is applied to you
[2:18:38] and you've been accepted you accepted oh
[2:18:42] my oh what a blessing God in his love
[2:18:45] and mercy has accepted me I've accepted
[2:18:50] you oh oh brother could we liftt our
[2:18:53] hands this morning and just glorify him
[2:18:56] for that just that Revelation to know
[2:19:00] that all right now now now now now this

[2:19:06] hands in the Honey Bucket aren't we we

[2:19:13] got a revelation amen and then you can't
[2:19:15] help yourself you be you you act
[2:19:17] abnormally when you get that stimulation
[2:19:20] people don't understand how you act but
[2:19:21] that's normal that's what the prophet
[2:19:23] says now we go on now now just not the
[2:19:27] certain evidence see not the certain
[2:19:29] evidence you see you say what brother
[2:19:30] bam I feel it in my
[2:19:33] mind you see why why would I know then

[2:19:39] why would you know he answers that
[2:19:41] question look what you were and what you

[2:19:47] looking at what you were and how you are
[2:19:49] amen it's not CLA your face change right

[2:19:56] know brother Israel your hair hasn't
[2:19:59] changed yet you better thank the Lord
[2:20:01] but brother Paul I remember when it was

[2:20:05] wife said to me Fergie is the first gray
[2:20:08] hair and I said leave it alone that's
[2:20:09] all right I don't have to tell her that
[2:20:11] long because one came then another then
[2:20:13] another then another then almost the
[2:20:15] whole thing is turned white so brother

[2:20:53] of your desire the prophet of God says
[2:20:56] he has to create that in you now as we

[2:23:34] time that we are living right now let's
[2:23:36] go a little deeper into
[2:23:38] it butam now the prophet to whom the
[2:23:41] word of the Lord
[2:23:45] comes the Elijah that's the Revelation
[2:23:47] that God has given me it's not a
[2:23:50] personal revelation it is that which is
[2:23:52] written Quicken to me the Bible says
[2:23:54] Elijah shall first come and restore all
[2:23:56] things when that Revelation comes in me
[2:23:58] it doesn't change it Remains the Same
[2:24:01] God doesn't change the Revelation when
[2:24:03] he gives it to you he quickens it amen
[2:24:06] it's the same Revelation Elijah truly

[2:24:26] they want to see others and they feel
[2:24:27] happy with that that's between them and
[2:24:28] the Lord but this is the
[2:24:31] Revelation it is written it is revealed

[2:24:40] what is written is revealed so what is
[2:24:42] revealed and what is what is revealed in
[2:24:44] me and what is written is the same thing
[2:24:45] what is revealed to you and what is
[2:24:47] written is the same thing there's no
[2:24:48] difference
[2:24:57] now we continue now he's standing in the
[2:25:00] midst of the church as he stand there
[2:25:03] revealing who he who he is in this last
[2:25:07] age he calls himself the author of the
[2:25:11] creation of
[2:25:12] God this is another
[2:25:17] creation this has to do with the church
[2:25:22] Church oh

[2:25:34] explanations and people trying to get
[2:25:35] wrong
[2:25:36] stuff he said it has to do with the
[2:25:38] church and me settled I'm brother George
[2:25:41] all
[2:25:42] right this is a special designation of
[2:25:47] himself he is the creator of that church

[2:25:56] have approached him as a Healer let us
[2:25:58] approach him this morning as a Creator

[2:29:55] of our message I might end up keeping
[2:29:58] you too long and then to sit out long
[2:29:59] mind to preaching now Lord I'll try to
[2:30:02] hurry okay let's go on
[2:30:06] here low body H has thou father prepared
[2:30:09] me God not Mary provided that body amen
[2:30:12] Mary was the human incubator and she
[2:30:15] carried that holy child and brought him
[2:30:17] to birth it was a god manise he was the
[2:30:20] son of God he was of the new creation
[2:30:24] man and God met and joined he was the
[2:30:27] first of this new race who was the
[2:30:32] first there were those saying is brother
[2:30:34] brandham
[2:30:35] church I love brother brandham but the
[2:30:39] first of that race was not brother
[2:30:44] brandham now this might this this might
[2:30:46] step on some people's toes but sometimes
[2:30:48] we can't help it we people's stes that's
[2:30:51] right where they get hurt what can we do
[2:30:54] and I've seen people leave meeting
[2:30:55] sometimes bitter and hurt and stay that
[2:30:57] way for years what can you do got to
[2:30:59] tell them the truth
[2:31:02] so so we go back
[2:31:04] here he was of the new creation he was
[2:31:07] the first of this new race he is the
[2:31:10] head of this new race there it
[2:31:14] is Colossians 1: 18 and he is the head
[2:31:17] of the body the church who was the
[2:31:19] beginning the first first oneor from the
[2:31:20] dead that in all things he might have
[2:31:21] the the preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17
[2:31:25] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[2:31:27] in you yes sir he is a new sir what is
[2:31:30] he a new creation who created
[2:31:34] him did he create himself Satan is no
[2:31:37] Creator no sir man cannot create amen
[2:31:40] but is clear on that yes sir amen the
[2:31:43] church cannot create amen we approaching
[2:31:46] him as what he is the only creator amen
[2:31:50] and we approaching
[2:31:52] him could you raise your hand and give
[2:31:54] him praise could you glorify him for
[2:31:58] that all right now let's go
[2:32:06] on things are all he says here therefore
[2:32:10] he is a new creation all things have
[2:32:13] passed away behold
[2:32:17] all things have become new yes amen now
[2:32:21] let me say this to you when you when you
[2:32:24] read the Bible like this you aside all
[2:32:27] the little Coral thoughts and all what
[2:32:28] the devil trying to BR to your mind and
[2:32:30] you confess that all things has become
[2:32:35] new to
[2:32:37] you that's
[2:32:41] right amen we say it together all things
[2:32:46] have become new amen
[2:32:53] amise there you can see that though man
[2:32:56] was of the old order of creation right
[2:33:00] now in Union with Christ he has become
[2:33:02] the new creation of
[2:33:05] God Ephesians 2:10 for we are his
[2:33:09] workmanship created in Union with Christ
[2:33:11] Jesus under good works Ephesians 4:24
[2:33:15] and that he put on the new man which
[2:33:18] after God has created in righteous and
[2:33:20] true
[2:33:21] Holiness this new creation is not the
[2:33:24] old creation made

[2:34:41] of God this was his purpose amen this
[2:34:45] purpose took took form through election

[2:34:54] church as the author of this new
[2:34:57] creation of God his Sovereign power

[2:44:52] man you know the answ is all in this
[2:44:56] message sometimes we seek answers in

[2:45:02] sisters doesn't work but explain to me
[2:45:04] what's happening with you yeah but then
[2:45:07] the word tells me what it is here what
[2:45:09] the word says first you must be born
[2:45:11] again amen and then when you're born
[2:45:14] again you have faith you believe the
[2:45:17] word until you wared then you'll argue
[2:45:21] against
[2:45:29] it if you're just riously inclined and
[2:45:32] you got a little human knowledge that
[2:45:33] you should do right you'll never be able
[2:45:36] to agree upon the word of God you'll
[2:45:39] never do it you've got to be born again
[2:45:41] and born again it produces Faith yes
[2:45:45] amen amen you see why they arguing
[2:45:50] anyone agree with the
[2:45:52] word that's it how they born
[2:45:58] again look let's leave that alone let's
[2:46:01] move
[2:46:02] on now I want to say this to you quickly
[2:46:06] before we finish listen to
[2:46:16] this and I'm I'm going to open open this
[2:46:19] subject up just a little
[2:46:24] bit but we're not going to go deep into
[2:46:27] it this morning I have to finish because
[2:46:28] take me too too much time so I w't go
[2:46:30] deep into it total
[2:46:33] Deliverance now when God is doing that
[2:46:35] work in
[2:46:36] you it's a perfect work yes God doesn't
[2:46:40] do halfway work amen let me let me read
[2:46:45] it for you total difference just like
[2:46:47] you if you're a Christian
[2:46:50] God Don't Make Any halfway
[2:46:55] Christians it's like a it's like we ask
[2:46:58] the question we ask the question to the
[2:46:59] church sometimes when is the work of God
[2:47:02] Perfect When God starts or when he
[2:47:12] finishes
[2:47:17] silence my brother says all the way
[2:47:21] true who says when he
[2:47:24] finishes who says when he starts who
[2:47:27] says
[2:47:29] [Laughter]
[2:47:31] nothing all right what is the
[2:47:34] answer God starts in Perfection and he
[2:47:37] finishes in Perfection yes he does
[2:47:39] that's what the prophet tell us that's
[2:47:40] correct God cannot God cannot work in
[2:47:43] imperfection exactly everything God does
[2:47:47] is perfect everything man does is
[2:47:51] imperfect man cannot produce Perfection
[2:47:54] God Alone is the one to do it all right
[2:47:56] going into that that's another subject
[2:47:58] but here he says here God Don't Make Any
[2:48:00] halfway Christians God makes complete
[2:48:03] Christians God Don't Make halfway
[2:48:05] preachers amen but the preacher could be
[2:48:08] halfway that's correct brother Paul
[2:48:11] brother Bill brother George Israel we
[2:48:14] don't want to be halfway
[2:48:16] preachers but then what is a halfway
[2:48:18] preacher
[2:48:22] you know I ask myself that because
[2:48:25] brother Jo I don't want to be halfway
[2:48:28] preacher and I don't want to be Halfway
[2:48:30] Christian I ask myself what is a halfway
[2:48:33] preacher every Everybody might have
[2:48:35] their little ideas but let's get to the
[2:48:37] message but the preacher could be
[2:48:39] halfway and God makes his children
[2:48:42] Christians but sometimes they're halfway
[2:48:45] Christians but it's not God's intention
[2:48:47] for them to be that way it is their own
[2:48:50] ways got mixed up with the plan of God
[2:48:53] for their life and that what make them
[2:48:55] way they are God don't want them to be
[2:48:58] halfway Christians or halfway preachers
[2:49:01] compromising on either
[2:49:06] side today that that has become a lovely
[2:49:09] word in
[2:49:10] politics you have to be able to
[2:49:14] compromise he is a wonderful politician
[2:49:18] who knows knows how to
[2:49:21] compromise and this is coming to the
[2:49:23] church and instead of saying compromise
[2:49:25] they say you know our pastor is a man of
[2:49:29] understanding he lets us do whatever we
[2:49:35] want you know all we have to do is to be
[2:49:37] sweet and nice and just tell him and he
[2:49:39] would let us know he knows how to fiddle
[2:49:42] Fiddle in order to make the fiddle with
[2:49:44] everybody in order to make everybody
[2:49:46] happy when we come into the church we
[2:49:48] don't want to be uneasy you know and get
[2:49:50] our FS all ruffled up and hear all kinds
[2:49:52] of rough pushing you know we want to be
[2:49:53] able to sit there and enjoy everything
[2:49:55] and be
[2:49:58] comfortable they don't realize what the
[2:50:00] eagle Mama does when she ready to take
[2:50:02] him for a flight she spreads the wings
[2:50:04] and blow all the F out of the Wings and
[2:50:06] those little things begin to stick on
[2:50:09] all the little Eagle ass and makes the
[2:50:11] whole Nest uncomfortable what is she
[2:50:13] what is she fixing to do take them for a
[2:50:15] ride take them higher now come on Church
[2:50:20] look we weren't going into all of that
[2:50:22] we spend a lot of time but let me go on
[2:50:24] here butam says God don't want him to be
[2:50:26] halfway Christians halfway preachers
[2:50:28] compromising on theze he wants it to be
[2:50:31] completely stand in the
[2:50:33] bridge now Moses had made him now God
[2:50:36] had made now Moses God had made him a
[2:50:38] complete Prophet for complete
[2:50:40] deliverance and Moses was completely
[2:50:43] surrendered into the hands of God that's
[2:50:45] the reason it made him what he was he
[2:50:47] was so complete in God till God could
[2:50:50] trust
[2:50:53] him that's what we
[2:50:57] want God wants the church without spot
[2:51:00] all
[2:51:04] Grand and in the new creation he will
[2:51:06] have
[2:51:09] it it's not a decision of you or a
[2:51:13] decision of
[2:51:16] me it is the work of creation in
[2:51:19] us what he has done for us now
[2:51:24] church I got to stop
[2:51:27] here all right I want to keep you all no
[2:51:31] longer I
