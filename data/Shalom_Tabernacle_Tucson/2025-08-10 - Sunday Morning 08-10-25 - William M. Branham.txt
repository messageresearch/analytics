[Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. [Music] This morning, let's all stand to our feet. Go for Sunday school portion of the service like to welcome each of you to the house of the Lord and we'll just bow our heads for a word of prayer and just soft heavenly father we thank you for bringing us together once again Lord as we bring the service to We pray for your blessings for your anointing to come and strike us every heart. Lord, bless this beginning service all the way through the remainder of the day. Holy Spirit be with us. We pray. We love you. Thank you for those that are traveling on their way as well [Music] as well. Bless all the other classes, Father, the other pray. Amen. We'll sing a little bit of Amazing Grace. [Music] the sanctification where Jesus gave his life at the cross. Um sh spilling his blood upon the earth 2,000 years. The the second the third 2,000 years is the age that we're in and we come into that millennium reign and on into the seventh day. But that seventh day, that millennium is still not our eternal uh that we're not bound there. That's not our heavenly home. We have a heavenly home and that is our future home that he's building for us now. &gt;&gt; So what is left? What's next? Next for the church, for the believers is this thousand year reign with Christ for a thousand years. And this is a reality. This is not a story. This not fairy tale. This is where Hollywood gets their stories from truth like this. We will come back again. And there's a group of people that will be dead sleeping in their graves while we're still reigning on the earth. And at the end of that thousand years, it's still a time period. The Bible tells us that we will plant, we will build houses, brother Chris. We'll plant trees and vineyards and vegetables and gardens and we'll eat from that. We'll build homes. Some of us want a nice home. The square footage, whatever kind of home you want to build, we're going to do that &gt;&gt; in a thousand years reign with Christ. &gt;&gt; And there will be no satanic politics to influence us. And brother Vanam will bring it out in this message that as he redeemed the earth, he redeems you. So just as you are an attribute of God, this earth is an attribute of God. He created that. And this earth is as eternal as you are. I want you to think about that. He created the earth and not so that it can be destroyed or polluted. He created it so that righteousness and holiness can dwell on it. and that was his children to dwell upon the earth. &gt;&gt; And so when man corrupted it, he had to redeem it. He had to purify it and cleanse it so that um the people can live on it. So I mean, what's eternal life if you don't have a place to live on? &gt;&gt; Um you got to have a place to live. So the earth is eternal. Think about it. And this message really opens up your heart and your eyes to uh what the future holds for the true believer. This first resurrection, remember, everybody resurrects. &gt;&gt; Everybody that come on the earth will rise again. But what order do you come in? &gt;&gt; That first resurrection is for the bride. That first resurrection is what we are attaining to &gt;&gt; to be a part of the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; Jesus was a part of the first fruits and we were raised in that first resurrection. And blessed and holy is he that hath part in that first resurrection. Those are the ones that will come back to the earth for a thousand years and rule and reign with Christ. And as Christ cleans the earth, he cleanses the believer. And when he and brother says that he as he he'll take all the politics out of the earth just like he takes all the politics out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The individual. So you can be a son or daughter of God. So, we just read in Revelations there, chapter 20, uh, chapter 21. It's a nice, uh, view of the new heaven and the new earth. But I'd like to take the scripture in Luke chapter 22, verse 24. If you can turn there quickly, this is just one place of many where the disciples were looking for this time to rule and reign with Christ. They were looking for Jesus to come and kick all the Romans out and reestablish his kingdom right now. Here's the great Messiah. This is the one that David spoke of. Isaiah spoke of him. All the prophets spoke of him. And then here's Jesus manifesting these great signs, wonders, and miracles. They're thinking that they will go right into reigning and ruling and establishing a righteous kingdom &gt;&gt; where the Lord Jesus will be that king. And it wasn't time yet. &gt;&gt; It wasn't time yet. And Jesus never told them, "This is not exactly your time." He just kept it moving forward. And they would ask him a question. Lord, will you restore the kingdom at this time? And he says, "It's not for you to know the time or the season when God will. You just got to keep moving forward. Just keep moving forward. And some of us will taste death. I don't know. Um, if the Lord Teresa is coming, some of us will have to go by the way of the grave. &gt;&gt; But there's still going to be a thousand-year reign. &gt;&gt; And you're not going to miss that. If you go down properly, you'll get up in time &gt;&gt; to to be a part of to be a part of the thousand-year reign. &gt;&gt; How many want to be there? &gt;&gt; Oh my, &gt;&gt; there so far beyond just coming to church. &gt;&gt; This is my future. This is where I'm headed. &gt;&gt; So let's take Luke 22 24. And there was strife among them. Which of them should be accounted the greatest? He said unto them, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so. But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief as he doth serve. For whether is greater, he that siteth at meat, or he that serveth, is not he that sitth at meat? But I am among you as he that serveth. Yeah, ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. He's talking to his 12 disciples here. And I appoint unto you a kingdom as my father has appointed unto me. that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And so we see the Lord is talking about this future kingdom even with his disciples. Now just to take a few quotations for you. The prophet talking about this millennium. He says this in the message the resurrection of Lazarus 1953 November he says he can't do nothing more for he says paragraphs 11 you know sometimes I think I wonder how the Lord feels about us sometimes when he does so many things for us and yet we just sit like we are subconsciously don't we aren't we all guilty we just sat and say well Lord I wish you'd do something for for me. He can't do nothing more for us than what he's already done. He's already healed us. He's already saved us. He's already given us joy. Give us peace. He's our shield, our buckler. Everything that we have is in him. And he's done paid the price of redemption to redeem us back as sons and daughters of God. There's only one thing in the world that is yet left undone. That is physical death. We've all got to die because that was the only way God has of bringing us home. That's the only avenue we can travel is through death to get home. So everything is under his feet. Everything except death. And death has done been the penalty of death done been taken off. And now we just go right into his presence and someday return back and be made immortal and live on this earth a thousand years with Jesus Christ. Amen. I believe that. I'm strictly a millennialist. I believe in the millennium. I believe all the Hebrew prophets and through the ages spoke of the golden age of the millennium coming. I believe we're going to have it. We'll reign here with him a thousand years. There's postmillennium, premillennium, no millennium. If you say, "I don't believe it it at all," that's all right. We're still brothers. In the message, God's preparation, brother Bannam says this here, paragraph number 49, over in the book of Revelation said, "Rejoice ye heavens and ye holy prophets, for the kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and his Christ. And he ruled and reigned on earth a thousand years. There you are. Then they will study war no more. But as long as Satan's got rule, this one will build up a little bit. A few righteous men will get in office and they will build up a little bit and then Satan will reach over here and tear the thing down. That's right. Then the first thing you know with that great prince that's coming someday, every man, every nation fighting, let this be the international language. Let this be the international flag. And they're fighting for power and don't realize they're calling up a bunch of crazy people. And we're in the kingdom that will possess the world. That's right. Yes, sir. The kingdom of God shall rule and reign and smite down every nation, every flag. There will be one flag, and that will be the old rugged cross. There will be one language and that will be the heavenly hallelujah. And that will be heavenly. Hallelujah. One people that will be the saints. They will rule and reign with Christ on David's throne, his father, and rule and reign here through the millennium a thousand years. Then it over to the new earth. Oh, what a marvelous thing. The Junction of Time 1956, Brother Random says this here. When Satan will be bound and cast into the pit, chained by a chain of circumstance circumstance that he cannot come out and deceive the nations no more. And a thousand years millennium reign will take place on the earth while we are glorifying our Lord Jesus and adorning him. Crown him the king of kings and lord of lords. Jehovah Gyra 1961. All the world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. Waiting for the church to get back into its place again. Sons of God to be made manifest. Waiting for that hour. Hope that don't hurt. But I just had to say it. See, the church is so far away from its place. It needs to be back to be sons of God again, rulers, governors of the earth under the spiritual reign. It will be someday when the chief one comes, Jesus Christ, the great millennium. Nature is groaning for that day. Questions and answers. The prophet says this in 1962. Then at the return of the church and the bride, the bride in Christ shall walk out upon the ashes in the millennium when the earth is purified by fire. And there they shall reign and the heavens that never heard that the heathens that's never heard the gospel shall be raised in that time and the sons of God will be manifested. If he's to reign, he's got to have something to reign over. He's got a domain and they ruled and reigned with Christ and Christ ruled with a rod of iron the nations. Then the gospel then the manifested sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here. See there will come the millennium in that reign. See upon the ashes. So I watch for something. Has it slipped by us in humility and we've missed it? Is it gone and the church is left in her sins? If that be so, then it's later than you think. If not, then there's coming one with the message that straight on the Bible. A quick work will circle the earth. That was in 1962. Here what the prophet of God says here in the future home paragraph 198. As I prepare to close here, notice this is still not referred. This millennium reign, the thousand years is not the new earth. See, the millennium reign is a different reign. That's what we go into the millennium. But that isn't the new earth, the new heaven. No, no, that's just a rest place. See, a rest period. Not at all the new heavens and the new earth. For you see, in the millennium, we have things that would not go into that. It's a type of the old seventh day out of Eden. The seventh day after he made the world, the seventh day he rested in Eden and the millennium. Brother Brandon brings it like this in one place. He says that the marriage ceremony is taking place now. The wedding supper, the marriage supper takes place over in heaven, that other dimension for three and a half years. Then we come back on the earth for the honeymoon a thousand years. That's that rest period. Some of us look a little tired. We can use a rest. Fighting off devils every day. fighting people a little trap set after running for my I'm singing the song I'm running for my life I'm running for my life if you stop anywhere Satan will get you &gt;&gt; but in that millennium will rule and reign &gt;&gt; and Satan will be bound could you imagine a week without Satan &gt;&gt; well think about a thousand years &gt;&gt; amen that's where we're going &gt;&gt; Amen question they ask brother Brandham in the message questions and answers. Brother Brandon, will there be any children born during the millennium thousand years millennium 1,00 years reign of Christ here on the earth? Or will there be any sign of earth, any sin, pardon me, on the earth during that time? Will there be people on the earth in corporal bodies during that time? That's the question. Now, will children be born during the thousand years millennium reign? That's the question in my mind that I told you the other day. I don't know. It looks a whole lot lot like it could be. It looks a whole lot like it couldn't be. I'm going to be as honest with you as I know how to be. I don't know. To this time, if God ever reveals it, I will tell you. But wait, it has to come from God. You're my children. I wouldn't tell you. I don't know whether there'll be or whether there will not be. I can't say. or will there be sin on the earth during that time? No, there will not be no sin on earth. Satan is bound. Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; I just want to release out a great hallelujah right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where there is no sin in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Once you get there, won't you meet me there in the great millennium? There will be no sin there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or will there be sin on the earth during that time? No, there will not be no sin on earth. Satan is bound. &gt;&gt; And will there be people on the earth in corporal bodies during that time? Yes, sir. We will have our glorified body right here on the earth, eating, drinking, building houses, and living just like we do now for a thousand years. It's the honeymoon of the bride and groom. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I got two more I want to read. Number 392. Question 392. The church age ending and has blacked out. The bride is called. We have already entered into the Have we already entered into the tribulation period? Someone is asking. Brother Banner answers this. 1964. No. No. No. I wish that I could just have more time on that. See, the bride when she's taken from the earth, from the church, then the church age will cease. Leodia goes into chaos. The bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy. Then tribulation sets in upon Israel. And then comes the battle of Armageddon, which destroys all things. And then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years, the millennium reign. After that comes the white throne judgment. After that comes the new heavens and the new earth and the new city coming down from God out of heaven. Eternity and time blends together. In the invisible union of Christ, the prophet says this, if the musicians will come, please. Paragraph number 34. Saints, we have so much more to look forward to &gt;&gt; than what the news is telling you. We have so much more to look forward to &gt;&gt; than your own personal issues at this present time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many of us have are going through something? All of us. All of us. &gt;&gt; All of us broken dream, broken promise. We wanted this to happen that didn't work out. We wish we' have more of this or less of that. We wish this. We wish this was in order. We wish I had all of that taken care of. But we have more to look forward to than perhaps we realize. &gt;&gt; And the scriptures point it all out to us. &gt;&gt; This is just a very small portion of your life. What's going on right now? It'll soon all be over and you will forget about all of this &gt;&gt; and all of the stress and the tears &gt;&gt; and the problems and the troubles to wipe them all away &gt;&gt; in that new home. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we're going to that place. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. Invisible union. He says this, "And we know that history is closing out. The world's history will soon be over. Then we're going to step into a new day to the great millennium." That as one believer, I believe in the millennium, a millennium reign with Christ, a thousand years upon the earth, the physical return of our Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your uh this portion of your word today. I pray, Father, that it'll resonate in our hearts as we prepare to hear about this future home as uh as we come to that part of the service, Lord. We we want to take some time and praise you and worship you and offer the sacrifice of praise, the fruits of our lips, giving thanks to you. Lord, bless this service today. Bless our worship. May you receive our little offering, our little sacrifice, our little time that we've set aside to present it to you. You're the righteous and the holy one. You alone receive worship and it's you alone that we bow down to worship. And father, may each one prepare their hearts to give that over to you today as our prayer. Thank you for the word of God. Thank you for these promises. It's in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Lord, I believe the Bible is true. I believe these promises are true. I feel it in my spirit. I'm longing for it, Lord. So today I want to live knowing that that future home just lays right up ahead of the road and grant it. Father we pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. The musicians can play their prelude music. God bless you. [Music] Yes. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat.

Will you just shake hands with somebody around you this morning? It's good to be together again. Nice to see the smiles. Key of Eflat if we could. Sister Sharon, I'll enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. So trust that's how we all came in this morning. Thanksgiving in our heart. [Music] Amen. We have so much to be thankful for this morning. And just want to let him know how much I appreciate what he's done for me, what he's doing for me. And I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter his courts with praise. I will say this is the day that the Lord has made. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. Oh, I will enter his gaze with thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter his voice with praise. I will say this is the day that the Lord has made. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. Oh yes, he has made me glad. Oh, he has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. He has made me glad. Yes, he has made me glad. I will rejoice for him. Let's sing that one more time. I will enter I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter his court with praise. I will say this is the day that the Lord has made. I will rejoice. He has made me glad. Yes, he has made me glad. Oh, he has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. [Music] He has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. So I changed the batteries on the microphone, Sean, but I left them in the back room. So, if you could bring them to me and then use one of them to open our service with a word of prayer, that would be wonderful. He has made me glad. Yes, he has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. Yes, he has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will rejoice for he has made me glad. [Music] Happy to be here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's talk to our Lord Jesus. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just come to you with worship and thanksgiving, oh God, for just all you've done, Lord. Lord, we just ask that you'd speak to our hearts this morning, Father. Lord, Lord, let us hear from heaven this morning, Lord. Lord, we just ask that you would just walk the aisles, Lord, and just just fill us with another double portion of your spirit, Lord. Lord, we just love you so much, Lord. Lord, you gave us these hands, Lord. You gave us our bodies, Lord, and we give them back to you, Lord. Lord, we just ask you forgive us of anywhere we've fallen short this week, Lord. And we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name. We bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. Yes, we bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. Let me offer up to you the sacrificees [Music] of thanksgiving and we offer up to you the sacriice. Let's sing that one more time to bring that sacrifice. We bring the sacrifice and praise into the house of the Lord. Yes, we bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. [Music] And we offer up to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving that we offer unto you. This the verse says, "I come into your presence, past the gates of praise, into your sanctuary till we're standing face to face." And just thinking about that, the gates of praise. And you know, we we don't have the same type of cities that they that they had that we read about in the Old Testament. But the only way in was through those gates. And I think that's something that to think about that we want in his presence. We're going to make that sacrifice of praise. And and he wants us. He inhabits the praises of his people. But we can't just come to him on our terms. So, let's just let him know this morning how much we appreciate him. I think anybody that's a parent here, you know, when your children come and they tell you something that you're the best, that you know how great you are, how it just melts your heart. You want to do something special for him. And I think that's that's the way that he deserves it. We need to tell him, Lord, we just we love you so much. You're so good to us. Amen. And let's just let's just make him welcome this morning. We know he's here, but let's make him welcome. Let's make him our guest of honor today. As I come into your presence, past the gates of praise, into your sanctuary, till we're standing face to face. I look upon your countenance. I see the fullness of your face. I can only bow down and say [Music] you are awesome in this place. Mighty God, you are awesome in this place of the Father. You are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awesome in this place. Mighty God, yes you are awesome in this place. Mighty God, you are awesome in this place of a father. You are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awesome in this place. Mighty God. Yes, he's worthy of our praise. You are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awesome in this place. Mighty God. Hallelujah. Let's go to the key of Jes. On a hill far away, there stood a rugged cross, the emblem of suffering and shame. Oh, I love that old cross. How I love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain. [Music] And so I'll cherish the old rugged cross until my trophies at last I lay down. And I will cling to the old rugged cross and I'll exchange it someday for a crown. Oh, that old rugged cross so despised by the world has a wonderous attraction for me. For the dear lamb of God left his glory above to bear to dark calary. Oh, I'll cherish the old rugged cross until my trophies at last I lay down. Oh, I will cling to the old ruged cross. And all exchange is someday for a crown in the old rugged cross. And in the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine. A wonderous beauty I see. [Music] For it was on that old cross Jesus suffered and died to pardon and sanify me. Oh, I'll cherish the old rugged cross until my trophies are last. I lay down. [Music] Yes, I will cling to the old rugged cross [Music] and all the exchange is someday for let's sing the last verse to the old rugged cross I'll ever be true. Yes to the old rugged cross. I will ever be true. It shame and reproach gladly bear. Oh then you'll call me someday to my home. tomorrow. Oh, what a day that'll be. Where is glory? Forever I'll share. All cherish the old rugged cross [Music] until my trophies at last I lay down. [Music] Yes, I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it someday for a crown. [Music] &gt;&gt; Majesty. All worship his majesty. [Music] Unto Jesus be all glory. Let's stand as we worship him this morning and praise [Music] me majesty. Oh, he's the kingdom authority. The kingdom authority lo from his throne unto his own his anthem raise. Let's exalt him this morning. Lift up on high the name of Jesus. So exalt. Let's lift up on high the name of Jesus. Let's magnify. Magnify. Come glorify Christ Jesus the King [Applause] mesty. Oh worship his majesty. [Music] Jesus who died now glorified the king of all kings. Jesus who died now glorified for the job. Yes. Jesus who died now glorified. He's the king of all kings.

We dismissed the older school to be in church uh Sunday school with brother Israel this morning. Did you enjoy that children? Yes. So good. And getting ready for that new reign, the coming of our king. For the younger class, we had five kids and four Bibles and $2 in the offering. And I'm going to take the prayer request now in prayer. I'm missing the snows. I got to see sister Laura Laura for the first time in a few months there. It's just so good to see him, but I'm missing this morning. So remember sister Laura, brother Randy, and the family and her recovery. Missing the Figaroas and their moves. So we want to hold them up uh in prayer. Brother Joe Galante and uh recovering from his surgery this week. So hold him up in prayer and certainly for the Wheelers with the passing of our precious sister had her upcoming birthday this this month. But it was time I believe she was ready to go. But we'll hold them up. Sister Jackie, sister Carlina, Sarah and the family. And there will be a service on Friday, a graveside service at 9:00 at East Lom Palm. So I want to be in prayer and and support them in all that we can as we can do. Is there anything I'm missing this morning that you'd like to uh mention? Or maybe just hold up a hand to the the master this morning. Say, "Lord, help me with my trial, my battle, my loved ones." Dear God, we're so thankful to be in church this morning to to worship your majesty. We know you're the sooncoming king and not just a duty to be here, Lord. We know that is an expectation, but we are we're told that if two or three would just gather in your name, you'd be there, Lord. And we believe you're walking these very aisles. And pray that you look down on each one, each need. Lord, we find all of our answers in the word of God, Lord. Your perfect will is what we want in our lives. So, help us to understand and to know that to be bold and courageous to follow the very will uh your will, Lord, this morning. in each of these knees. We miss the snows. We know she's Sister Laura's been through such a great trial. Lord, you basically raised her from the dead and and we're very thankful. Lord, you have more for her to do here. And we miss them this morning. Just pray you'd help her through her recovery. Uh praying for a complete recovery, Lord, for her faith and her family. For the Figaros, we'll miss them these months, Lord. And whatever time frame that is, their move down south, we hold them up. Our precious brother Joe, sister Elise, we miss them this morning. Pray for them. And also for the Wheelers, Lord, we we know this time was coming, our precious sister, Lord, being many years and and just a gallant soldier. Uh but we will miss her and pray for this service on Friday that you'd help and comfort the family as only you can do. And we've brought our needs to you, Lord. Now, may we just walk in the truth and and be content with where you've placed us and with all that we have, Lord, knowing that we're your children in the final, this last age, Lord, where your coming is very soon. May we get ready. We bring tithes and offerings, Lord, as a sacrifice as well, a sacrifice of praise as cheerful givers, Lord, and thankfulness. Just love and appreciate each one in their precious name of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. All God's people say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's just sing that song with the musicians as they continue to play it. Brother Arvy has a special for us on his guitar this morning. If you could make ready. Yes.

But just thinking about what we were hearing in the Sunday school today and what we have to look forward to with Satan being bound a thousand years and and and we're going to hear about our new home this morning. It we should be shouting. We should be excited and that we just want to sing that song. We all get to heaven. What a day of rejoicing that'll be. Amen. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus. Oh, sing his mercy and his grace in the mansion bright and blessed. He'll prepare for us a place. When we all get to heaven. Oh, what a day of rejoicing that will be. Oh, when we all see Jesus, we will sing and we'll shout the victory. Oh, while we walk the hill, clouds will over spread the sky.

God bless you. Second Peter 3. This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance, that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior, knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust. and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming?" If that don't meet this infidel woman, and since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water. Whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished. But the heavens and the earth, which now are by the same word, are kept in store, reserve unto fire against the day of judgment, and the predition of ungodly man. But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. Now the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some man counts slackness, but is longsuffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all might come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens and the earth with a great noise shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works that are therein shall burn up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of person ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for the hastening unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that we look for such things, be diligent that you may not be found may be found of him in peace without spot, without blemish, and accounting that the longsuffering of the Lord is salvation, even as our beloved Paul, according to the wisdom given unto him, has written unto you, as also all his epistles, speaking in them of the things which are sometimes hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrestle rest as as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest ye also being led away with error of the wicked, fall from your steadfastness. But grow in grace in the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen. Now in the the revelation of Christ in the 21st chapter, I read these words. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there were no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adored for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with man, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrowing nor crying, neither should there be any more pain, for the former things have passed away." And he that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." He said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful." And he said unto me, "It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. And I will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountains of the water uh of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son. Let us pray again. Lord Jesus with such a promise and such stern talk as Jesus himself and the apostle has given us concerning the hour we are approaching. Give us, oh Lord, thy direction &gt;&gt; that we might know how to approach it in the right way because it's coming. We know the scriptures must be fulfilled and so shall it be. Now, Lord, we ask your mercy again upon us all as we study thy word. Be with us and unfold it to us, Lord. For we asked it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be seated. Now, I wonder if there could be a way that perhaps maybe they could turn the lights from the main auditorium off and just leave them on the platform here, which would probably be better, and take some of the current. We uh about burn up a transformer the other night and if the uh uh custodian will do that for us, we appreciate turn the bottom lights, the main auditorium lights off and then I think you'll have plenty of room to see the right. Now the subject again to announce it that we are approaching the the subject of the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. Now as it's been I'm just going to have to do this. It's just too hot as as we are I know my wife don't like me to do that but that take my coat off. It's just too hot up here. you got air out there. It's just cut off in a little pin. &gt;&gt; Now in the um in the future or in the past rather, we have studied the seven seals, the seven churches, brother veil, and those are working upon those now faithfully to get them in book form. And seeing all these mysterious things that we have seen come to pass. Then I think after understanding that in the hour that we're living in and the position there's no one that would want to sit down real sensibly and examine what has been spoken of and what is promised to happen and what has happened. But what could say that those things are fulfilled? &gt;&gt; Exactly what God said he would do. He did it just exactly to the letter. Now I think in this that not knowing what time that the Lord Jesus might appear uh I thought it would be good it seemed pleasing to the Holy Spirit that we speak on this and and maybe come back to it again two or three times because I won't have quite ample time to get all this out as where you hit a a subject that might be a little stumbling to someone. You can't carry it all the way out to make it plain. Then you come back again to catch the next subject. And then later on in the if the Lord willing, we come into the 12 seals not pardon me the 12th chapter of Revelations which lays between the coming of the Lord and the ending of the trumpets and so forth. We'll try to bring that back to show who's Satan and what he did, where he come from, what's his purpose, and how that his great beauty that was given caused his fall, his deceit causes the fall beauty. Then how that the impossibility for any man that wants to look at it, right? That's serpent seed. &gt;&gt; I'd make a challenge to that to anybody see that would want to look at it with with absolutely common understanding. a child can see it thing. Now, and we'll get to that later. Now, we understand here that these two scriptures, the reason I read second Peter, the third chapter, and compared it with Revelations 21, um they u both here are speaking uh uh the same subject, but John never never wrote it out like Peter did. See, we understand that this great home of the bride is to be here on earth. And now if you read just like 21 chap 21st chapter of revelations, the apostle here said or the prophet said that I saw a new heaven and a new earth. Sounds like there comes a annihilation. Now way I always find my messages is by prayer. I'll be sitting in prayer and something reveals to me and I'll wait on a few minutes and see if it's right. Then I feel it closer and then sometimes I keep waiting till it breaks into a vision. But when it begins to come and I'm satisfied it comes from God then I go to the scripture. See, that is a thought to be the confirmation of every spiritual thing that's done because the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. It is his body. And now in that maybe I find a place in the scripture that doesn't sound just right. I wonder I go back again to prayer. It comes again. Then I then I begin to to examine my scripture. Now our Bible is wrote in English. In English words change all the time. For instance, like St. John 14 said, "In my father's house is many mansions." A mansion in a house. Well, then you what to do with that? Then run it back to the u to the uh original and see what James meant or go back to the Hebrew or to the Greek from the first translation. And in there it says, "In my father's kingdom is many palaces." Well, then you come back to the time that the translators translated for King James, the kingdom was called in English a house. And uh the king was the father over his delegates. There's the reason they translate in my father's house is many mansions. See, and then you get those words and you have to hunt them up. Then you see from that inspiration this pull pit this morning I say not one time has it ever been nothing but straight the scripture &gt;&gt; that's how serpent seed and all these other things come see but and it's really if a fellow would just read and say in my father's house many mentions if you didn't stop to study praying you'd be all confused see but just keep praying God always makes it right if it comes from God now John explains means the change and the come how it comes about he doesn't explain it rather but Peter does John said I saw new heavens and new earth first heavens and first earth has passed away there was no more sea I John saw the holy city coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adored for her husband but we turn back to second Peter now to find out Peter explains how this process will come about now if you look at what John said it sound like for the first heavens and first earth was passed away, annihilated. See, and that sounds very strange. So, that's what struck me. And I begin to look for the word pass away. And now, but it's clear that both of these apostles and prophet were talking of the same thing. And now also in the book of Isaiah now that you want to put these scriptures down in Isaiah 65:17 Isaiah speaking of the millennium that thousand years of rest for the for the people of God. Isaiah spoke of it and he said I there was a uh all the former things that passed away and how they'll build houses and have them and we had time maybe we just take time. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and read this just a minute. Isaiah 65 and let's just read for a few minutes here. And here it is right for us now to begin. Isaiah 65:17. And behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. Now, Isaiah the prophet was one of the prophets that wrote exactly the entire Bible in his prophecy. He starts out with the creation in the middle of his book about the 40th chapter comes around John the Baptist the New Testament and winds up here in his book in the revelations in the millennium. There's 66 books in the Bible and the 66 chapters in Isaiah. He wrote a complete commentary. Now we find out you're now getting the 65th chapter. One more chapter and he speaks of the millennium. Notice it. How beautiful. Behold, I create new heaven and new earth. And the former thing shall not be re remembered or come into mind. It's the pass away. But believe be ye glad and rejoice even in that which I've created. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoice and her people of joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people. and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her for nor the voice of crying. There shall be no more thence infinite days in an old man that is not fulfill his days. For a child shall die 100 years old, and a sinner being 100 years old shall be accused. Then shall and they shall build houses and inhabit them. And they shall plant vineyards and shall eat the fruit of them. And they shall not build and another inhabit. That is your farm. Your son fall heir to it or some of your heirs. They shall not plant and another eat there. They do their own planting and remain there. They got life eternal. For as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my law my elect shall long enjoy the works of their hands. They shall not labor in vain or bring forth for trouble. For they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord and their offsprings with them. Now shares where I'm going to get to while and it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer. And while they're yet speaking, I'll hear, and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together, &gt;&gt; and the lion shall eat straw like a bullock. Dust shall be the serpent's beat, and they shall not hurt or destroy, and all my holy mountain, sayeth the Lord. What a promise &gt;&gt; of these prophets and great sages, teachers of the Bible way back in ancient days seeing this glorious day come. By these passages, one might think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this earth will be destroyed. I make a new heaven and a new earth. that the heavens will be gone and the earth will be gone completely annihilated. But a close study and with the help of the Holy Spirit, we can see the truth of this. And that's what we're going into. It is only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's up on the earth that will be destroyed. Now we realize that the heavens means the atmosphere is above. What does it do? It uh then these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits will all be gone away and annihilated. &gt;&gt; It has to be done that way because we are going to live right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; We prove that by the Bible. &gt;&gt; Right here's where we live. &gt;&gt; Now notice thistles, germs, all of sicknesses and things will be completely uh taken away. All this its existence that's in the earth now, man-made systems, politics, sin, all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with in all the heavens above us. and your is contaminated with evil spirit. Are we going to go deep and long in this? See, all this exists in the heavens or atmospheres and the earth which is now this earth holds those things. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't made for that purpose. Sin caused it to be like that. &gt;&gt; It was made by God, the creator. But all and all of our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when God created it &gt;&gt; because you're out of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; It was all laid out here. When God himself created, you were in his thinking &gt;&gt; and in him the great eternal was the thought which is his attribute. &gt;&gt; And now sin caused all this to happen. And God through this age is gathering up his material. Satan is still here. That's the reason all these things happen. He's still here. And all of his evil forces are still here. Notice that's why the earth now is so filthy. That's why the scum and ridiculous things that goes on, bloodshed, war, politics, sin, adultery, all kinds of filthiness goes on is because that Satan is the ruler of this earth and this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You say the atma. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Both the heavens and earth now is contaminated with devils &gt;&gt; that can accuse us before God. Jesus is there to intercede for us. &gt;&gt; See, while the accusers keep pointing a finger, they did this, they did this, they did this, but the blood still covers. &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that elected that he foresaw. That's why it's so filthy today. Here, the apostle in second Peter here, the second chapter and the fifth and the and the fifth and sixth verse. Yes, I've got it. He refers to three stages of the earth. He he gets three stages of it. Notice how he brings them. The old world stood out of the water. Now that was the Antelovian world. Now the one it is, the present world we live in now, called it a world, the old world that stood out of water. Genesis 1:1. now and the world that is now present. And that again refers to another the world that is to come, the new world. Three worlds, three stages of the world. And notice how God makes plain to us his plan of redemption. Oh, this just thrilled my soul when I saw it. how he makes plain to us here now his plan of redemption. Now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world. He's done the same plan to redeem his people. &gt;&gt; For the unchangeable God changes not any of his plans or anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Such a glorious thing how he led us to himself to a a tabernacle in us by three stages of grace just like he's led the world in three stages to come to the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different uh stages of purification. That's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of grace. &gt;&gt; I taught that at the beginning. I've never changed since. It's God's word. You have to keep your threes together. Your sevens, your twelves, the pneumatics of the Bible must run perfect or you'll get your picture all mixed up. If you can't understand it, just keep praying. You watch it'll cut right in exactly. God is perfected in threes. Notice the old world the antalubian the world is present now and the one to come. Now first stage that he brings us to see his plan of redemption is exactly the same by everything. &gt;&gt; He uses the same method. &gt;&gt; He never changes. &gt;&gt; He said in Malachi 3, I am God and I change not. the way he does it. Therefore, if he saved the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one, he'll have to save the next one and everyone he saves will have to be the same way. &gt;&gt; If he healed a man at any time through the journey of life, let it be in the days of Jesus, apostles, the prophets, whenever it was, when the same conditions is met, he's got to do it again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Man changes. Time changes, age changes, dispensation changes, but God remains the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's perfect. What a hope that give the sick people. &gt;&gt; If he ever healed a person, he has to do it again when the same conditions is met. &gt;&gt; He ever saved a man, &gt;&gt; he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time. &gt;&gt; If he ever filled a man with the Holy Ghost, he's got to do it on the same grounds he did the first time. If he ever raised a man up from the grave, he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle. &gt;&gt; Doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a hope that gives me. What is it? Not in some man-made theory, &gt;&gt; something that groups of man have come together, but his unchangeable word. &gt;&gt; You say, "Is it the truth?" He said, "Let every man's word be a lie and mine be true. &gt;&gt; For heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall never fail." &gt;&gt; All scriptures given by inspiration. Therefore, it's good and profitable for doctrine. And remember that all scripture will be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Every bit of it. Notice how God makes it plain to us. And if that wasn't a a great confirmation, a good a great loving blessing from God. When I see this and see that since a boy, first time ever, Christ dealt with me, I've still always taught those three stages of grace. &gt;&gt; Notice it isn't true. Now, now the first step is repentance towards God. And then follows after that is water baptism. &gt;&gt; Water baptism. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; See water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine or to remit our past sins. Now it has nothing to do with future sin. &gt;&gt; It only remits. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. What for? Remission taken away of past sin &gt;&gt; has nothing to do with the future. Just your uh sin has been chopped off. &gt;&gt; What you did, you can't repent for what Adam done. &gt;&gt; You never done it. Adam did. You just get forgiveness for what you done. &gt;&gt; Amen. The old nature is still there. &gt;&gt; Let me take this board just a minute. Now, here is a human heart. Now, I'm not I'm a long ways from being an artist. Here is a human heart. And here is a human heart. Now, this one over here has a snake in it. That's sin. Here he has his lion. This one over here has a dove in it, which is the Holy Spirit. Here, he has a lion. Well, this here has malice, hatred, envy. That's what's causing this all here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, this over here has love and uh joy and longsuffering, and that's what does it down here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when you are asked or you are forgiven of your sins, you've only done this. &gt;&gt; Taking that away, &gt;&gt; but the thing that made you do it is still there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the old root of evil. &gt;&gt; It's still there. Notice, then you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your sins. Notice then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness to think right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Taken away. Sanctification is a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the next comes the baptism of the fire and Holy Ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us. &gt;&gt; Notice in the natural birth when a woman gives birth to a baby the natural life types the spiritual life. When a woman gives birth to a baby in the natural, the first thing happens is breaking of water, then blood &gt;&gt; and then the spirit alive. Grab the little fell and spank him and away he goes screaming. Water, blood, spirit. And now when a baby is born into the kingdom of God, he comes the same way. &gt;&gt; Water, blood, spirit. Now notice sanctification. The third stage, second stage of it, cleanses the mind, sets the heart, the mind of the heart, an order of holiness. A man can repent of sins and he's still thinking of, well, maybe he's a immoral man. Every immoral looking woman he finds, it's still there. Maybe he's a drunkard and every time he smells the drink, it's still there. See, but then when he gets sanctified, that cleanses that desire out of him. &gt;&gt; See, it takes the want of it away. He can still be tempted, but he's takes the want of it away. Still, he's not right yet. Then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire, cleansed, burned out, cleaned up, and then put into the service of God. Sanctification only sets him aside for service. And notice this exactly how that come. The message is coming. Martin Luther justification. John Wesley sanctification, the Pentecostal, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The messages. That's where they can't be any more ages of it. See, we're at the end time. &gt;&gt; Three stages. Baptism cleanses the heart with the Holy Ghost. How striking. Now he takes the place where we are to dwell in through the same process. Now he's called the church through justification. Called it through sanctification. Then filled it with the Holy Ghost and fire and he took it through a process that he himself, the Holy Spirit himself, the son of God could dwell in the human heart. &gt;&gt; Now it has to go through that before he can come into it. Notice he done the world where that bride's going to live in the same way. &gt;&gt; The same plan of of salvation. &gt;&gt; Notice the Antalovian world. He after it had repented by through the bride of that day, Noah, he give it a water baptism. &gt;&gt; Cover with water. Then justification, showing it is on his road to call this fallen world from Eden back to its restoration again. Then Christ came and shed his blood upon it, cleansing it and claiming it. &gt;&gt; See, that's the world that we live in now. See how Satan here in the scripture tried to make him break God's plan to receive it, give it to him when he took him up on the mountain and tried to give it to him without the purchase of the blood. &gt;&gt; You notice how Abraham when they tried to give him the land, he bought it with so many shulkets of silver before the people as a in sign as a witness. Let it be known this day that I bought this bearing place. see &gt;&gt; purchase it and Satan tried to to give him the kingdom which belongs to him now &gt;&gt; he tried to give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive it &gt;&gt; causes see then Satan could still have claim on it &gt;&gt; but it had to be bought &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; he was a word in the fullness thereof they couldn't deceive a minute then it is now to get a baptism of fire. &gt;&gt; See it is now what happened. Christ came and called the church to repentance baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission sanctified the church and with the fire of God come down and burn out all the filth and come and dwells in the human heart. Now the world to be redeemed for this redeemed person. He uses the same method. He baptized it in water after the end of destruction. Shed his blood up on it to sanctify it and claim it. &gt;&gt; It's his. Satan tried to say, "I'll give it to you." Said, "No, sir. I buy it. &gt;&gt; Let it be a witness." He was lifted up for an insign &gt;&gt; that he bought it. He purchased it. &gt;&gt; But now it has to go through a baptism of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Holy, far from God, which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it. &gt;&gt; Then it's purchased so that the redeemed can live on it, &gt;&gt; live in it in peace. Notice the baptism of fire is to cleanse it from sin, from sickness, from disease, germs, from sinners, from the devil, and all of his group. He's to be cast out into the lake of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Holy fire from God comes down from God out of heaven and burns it up. &gt;&gt; Notice to make it ready for God to dwell in. For God in the new world that is to come is to dwell in the earth. &gt;&gt; Cause you say God, he dwells in the human heart. But he and the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the same plan of redemption is used to redeem both world and the persons that live in it. &gt;&gt; See, the heart has to be cleansed like that. &gt;&gt; Before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost, which is Christ, coming down and dwell in the human heart, it first must be repented. &gt;&gt; It must be baptized in water in his name to show who it belongs to. &gt;&gt; Then it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus. And then the holy fire and holy ghost from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin, &gt;&gt; all the nature of the world. And therefore, he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth. &gt;&gt; Then again, the Bible said it's impossible for a man that's born of God cannot sin. &gt;&gt; He does not sin. There's no way for him to sin. &gt;&gt; How can he be a sinner and redeemed at the same time? &gt;&gt; How can I be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop at the same time? &gt;&gt; Oh, he redeemed us by his blood. &gt;&gt; By his spirit, he cleansed us and then comes to dwell in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church, &gt;&gt; not the denomination. Now the church notice close now as we take this places we are to to dwell in now now the the antivian repentance then brought water baptism then Christ came and shed his blood upon it to cleanse it to claim it and then comes the next the destruction of the world as it is now &gt;&gt; all the sin that's in the heavens above. He's the prince of the power of the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He keeps off wars off blessings from God. In there comes thunderbolts of lightning and strikes the earth and everything from the heavens, sheets of slice and rain and typhoons, ti storms and everything comes from above which is Satan. &gt;&gt; The prince of the power of the air. Notice, see how Satan tried to take it, as I said a few minutes ago, by giving it to Jesus without buying it. Then Satan still has a claim because it's earmarked. &gt;&gt; See, but Jesus buys it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By his shed blood and brings it back to the rightful owner. &gt;&gt; That's how he bought us by his blood. How he bought the church. &gt;&gt; And now it's baptism of fire cleanses from all germs. all diseases, all sicknesses, even all the spiritual things which is by us too that does the same way to make it ready for God to dwell in in this great age that's to come the new earth. See, he redeems it in the same way he does his people. He makes it all just the same as plan of redemption. For he is the unchangeable God, always the same in his plans. how I've told you before and make it known to you and by all ages that God cannot change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Makes it known every way by the same. He made it known his first message in the Andolivian world by Noah the prophet. &gt;&gt; I was talking to a dear brother who's sitting present with me now yesterday. He said one thing he said, brother Brandham, it always shook me as to what is it, brother? And he said, here's what she said, and it's true. The minority, how a little group is going to be saved in the days of coming. And we talked of how Jesus said, "Straight is the gate and narrow is the way, and but few there will be that'll find it." &gt;&gt; Now, notice the Bible said, "As it was in the days of Noah, where in eight souls were saved by water. &gt;&gt; So shall it be in the coming. I said, brother, you just got, he said, remember there's only eight souls there. &gt;&gt; I said, you just got half the picture. Yet Noah was a type of the remnant that's carried over. &gt;&gt; Not the translated bunch. &gt;&gt; Enoch, one man. That's right. &gt;&gt; When in the rapture before the flood came &gt;&gt; showing that the church does not go into the tribulation or anything around it. &gt;&gt; Enoch was translated &gt;&gt; one man. &gt;&gt; Oh the church may be a number but the bride is going to be a very small group. &gt;&gt; That'll make up the bride. &gt;&gt; Now the church may be a great number but the bride you see compare eight with one. Eight times less will be the bride than the church. And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where will the sinner and the ungodly appear? &gt;&gt; Those who know better to do it and go ahead and do it anyhow. &gt;&gt; Those who follow the rules of denomination instead of the word, where will they appear at yet called Christians taking the name of Christ? Now perfectly Noah was a type of those carried over. Remember when Noah come out, Ham was with him. &gt;&gt; Sin was still in there. &gt;&gt; Sin went right on over through the ark. &gt;&gt; Unbelief, doubt. &gt;&gt; Went over in the ark. Carried above the judgments. But Enoch went higher than the ark. &gt;&gt; He went on into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; But Noah went through and come out and there was still sin type of the millennium of the world's condition. The millennium is not the end of it. There will still be time after the millennium. The millennium is a space of time, but not the new earth. No, indeed. Notice in that, we'll get to it after a bit. See, the earth redeemed goes back to its original owner again. It took he took it from Satan. He pulled taken the earth away from Satan just like he took you away from Satan &gt;&gt; like he took the little woman at the well away from Satan. &gt;&gt; There stood the priest thought he was with God and he had nothing. &gt;&gt; See, I'd like to draw that for you just a moment. Now, we want to get this real clear. So, now watch close now on this teacher. Now this shirt here is God. God which is the eternal without there's no one but him. But in God he had attributes. Now this here represents the word the word of God which is made flesh to dwell among us in the person of Jesus. Now this year fellow here we're going to make him like this. Now this is called the woman at the well. This is the priest Pharisee. And where do you see this open blackboard means grace and salvation. Now in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; The three stages it was an attribute first was in God that he thought of himself as being human and that transmitted him down to be Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now if you'll ever be there, you was with him then. For there's only one form of eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; And you had to be a part of God at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not what you just chose down here. He chose you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come. &gt;&gt; Now look at this priest here. We find his bottom part here. His backlight back behind him. His predestination back here is sinful. Here's hell down here. Now, this little part in here looks like the blackboard that represents is purity. He was a priest. He was an honorable man. That represented this. &gt;&gt; He was also had to be a good man or he couldn't be a priest. &gt;&gt; But you see how he got it was intellectual earning. &gt;&gt; Now, this little woman, her first life up here, she's a prostitute. She was all marred up. But way down in here with just a little bit of understanding. I know when Messiah cometh that was there. Notice when Jesus came and manifested the word because the word discerned the thoughts that was in the heart as Hebrews 4 uh says it will 4:12 that he would the word was a discerner of the thoughts of the heart and he came as the son of man the prophet. What happened? This priest with only intellectual learning said it's a devil &gt;&gt; because that's what his denomination called it. &gt;&gt; What did it do? He had no representation. So it blacked him out. &gt;&gt; But this little woman had nothing to present. She's as filthy and dirty as she could be. &gt;&gt; But notice way down in her, she's got representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then she was looking for this to be made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he said, "Go get your husband and come here." She said, "Sir, I have not." Said, "You said the truth cause you got five and one you have now. It's not yours. You've had five. That means six you have." &gt;&gt; She said, "Sir, you're not beyond. &gt;&gt; I perceive that you are a prophet. &gt;&gt; Now, we know the Messiah, which is called Christ, will come." Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he does, he'll do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm he." No more doubt. &gt;&gt; Didn't have to split it. &gt;&gt; She saw it. &gt;&gt; Away she went. Why? &gt;&gt; What did it do to her? It redeemed her. &gt;&gt; Now watch. He came to be a redeemer. &gt;&gt; What does redeem mean bring back? &gt;&gt; Why didn't he get the priest? He was nothing. &gt;&gt; He had no representation. &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that which had fallen. the ball. This got messed up with that girl. But God had her in his thinking before the foundation of the earth and he come to cleans her. &gt;&gt; Then he shut Why? See where the priest? What did it do to him? It sent him right back to his destination. &gt;&gt; He had nothing to be good. Only intellectual learning. &gt;&gt; Now listen friend, if the only thing you've got is just intellectual learning, you get something different from that. And you'll never be able to get it unless you got representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I believe you come from the east and west, north and south. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The were living made manifest. &gt;&gt; Notice now how he makes his way known by his prophets in the beginning. He's never changed it. Salvation. justified a man, sanctified him, sent the Holy Ghost in fire, burnt the sin out of him and dwelt in him himself. He does the earth that he's going to use in a plan of redemption. The same way it repented and was baptized in water in by Noah. Jesus come and sanctified it by dripping his blood upon it and claimed it. And in the new earth is to come. It's to have a holy fire baptism to clean it of every devil, every germ, every sickness, everything that there is and make it a new I saw a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; You become a new person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just an old one patched up &gt;&gt; by joining church or trying to turn a new page, &gt;&gt; but you are a complete brand new unit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God takes the old man and burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost and fire and it comes himself. sends down your representation. No man can come to me except my father has drawn. &gt;&gt; And all the father has given me will come to me. &gt;&gt; You see it? &gt;&gt; Same plan, same weight. Satan was will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you. Satan cannot bother or he can tempt but he cannot get &gt;&gt; a bornag again Christian &gt;&gt; for God from the foundation of the world forsaw him &gt;&gt; and sent Jesus to redeem him &gt;&gt; and the blood speaks fine &gt;&gt; how can he sin when it can't be seen even by God &gt;&gt; he don't even the only thing he hears is your voice &gt;&gt; he sees your representation Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; by the same means for the world is one of his attributes just the same as you are one of his attributes. &gt;&gt; The world becomes one of his attributes because it was God's thinking in the beginning to have a world &gt;&gt; to be on a throne, &gt;&gt; to be a king, &gt;&gt; to be a redeemer, &gt;&gt; to be a healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's his attributes. &gt;&gt; Just like an attribute of you. I can't say a post less I think a post. &gt;&gt; I can't say man less I think a man. &gt;&gt; And when I think a man then say man, the thinking is my attribute and expression is a word. &gt;&gt; See like Isaiah, how could he say that a virgin was going to conceive? What is a thought? Now, many of you wonder how them that discernment comes. I'm going to tell you. See, it's a word that I say and it isn't my thinking because I don't know. I don't know the thinking of it. How can I tell you who you are and where you come from when I don't know you? &gt;&gt; How can I tell you what you done 10 years ago and I never seen you in my life? &gt;&gt; How can I tell you where you do and what you'll do 10 years from now? How do I know the future? But it is somebody else's thought. &gt;&gt; Let the mind that was in Christ be in you. &gt;&gt; Let the mind that was in Christ be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, then it isn't your thinking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you. &gt;&gt; And you're not expressing your own words. You're expressing his words. &gt;&gt; That's how many times a brethren gets confused on interpretation of tongues and things. They say things that's not right. They don't realize that that's Satan. &gt;&gt; You say in the garden of God, just wait till we get through. Find out if it's not or not. The weeds and the wheat grow in the same field. &gt;&gt; They both live by the same sun in the same rain. &gt;&gt; But if there be one among you who's a prophet, I the Lord will speak to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if what he says happens, then that's me. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's not expressing his own. He's expressing my thoughts. My attributes of the things that has to come, I'll use his mouth to express them by. And after he said them, they've got to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall never fail. &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive." That settles it. She's going to conceive. What God said, he does. &gt;&gt; Oh, make known by his prophets all of his manifestations because it's his attributes of his thoughts expressed. Now, here was this little woman. She was one of his attributes. &gt;&gt; See, and there was a priest representing the light. &gt;&gt; He had learned it from the Bible. He had learned that God was God. He had learned that holiness is right. He was learned that there was a law of God. He had learned it because of an intellectual conception. And he was born in the right lineage. He was a Levite. But he only know it by intellectual conception. &gt;&gt; And when the light of the hour, see, he learned it. But what had happened, &gt;&gt; not what was happening, &gt;&gt; what had happened. &gt;&gt; And when he found what was happening, his denomination said nothing about it. Therefore, he had no representation of it. &gt;&gt; But here was a redeemer on earth at that time to redeem those attributes of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she received it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She never questioned it. &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, Messiah come and see you'll do this." That settled it. &gt;&gt; And she seen it done. So he said, "I'm the Messiah." So that's settling. &gt;&gt; No more questions. She's just went telling everybody else, "Come see who you found." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These processes make us clean a temple for his dwelling place. Justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost with fire that does the cleansing of this temple. So as old world frame did not destroy by the waters when it was washed off the frame of the planet. The old frame the all the dirt all the uh stuff that God put on the earth was not destroyed when the first world was destroyed. And the Bible said it was destroyed. But it never destroyed the frame. &gt;&gt; It just destroyed the sin and sinners that was on it. &gt;&gt; The framework remained. But you see, as justification, as you Baptist and Methodists want to think of it, just justification, believing and being baptized, that's not enough. &gt;&gt; You wander right back into the things world, blob your hair and wear shorts and everything else. &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing happened yet. You just look back and seen you done wrong. &gt;&gt; What did justification do to the world? Never done a thing to it. Started right off again. Just as much sin as it ever was. &gt;&gt; That's the way a man does. And that's all the farther he goes. &gt;&gt; That's the way the great evangelist Billy Graham to see. He said, "I'll go and have 30,000 converts come back in a year and a got 30." &gt;&gt; That's all the farther they went. &gt;&gt; See, they surely they repent. I believe they repent. Most of them or some of them at least. But that isn't what it takes. It proves it here. Now, so the old world framework was not destroyed by the water. The world was only washed off. &gt;&gt; That got its baptism. &gt;&gt; It was baptized. So will the framework remain though it be burnt by fire. &gt;&gt; It don't destroy the earth. See, &gt;&gt; it just destroys the sin that's on it. Notice here some of you Bible student especially Dr. They looking at me. Notice in Peter in the second chapter of Peter, your third chapter rather, he uses the word world as a Greek word cosmos, which means the world order. The earth shall pass away, melt the elements with fervent heat. See, doesn't mean that the earth, the planet's going to pass away, but the world cosmos, the politics, the sinners, the systems, sin, disease, germs, everything that's wrong will pass away. &gt;&gt; Everything that once God shook the heavens, but this time he said he'll shake the earth. &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth, he shook the earth rather than this time he'll shake the heavens. &gt;&gt; See, for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; It's a eternal kingdom. Watch how it goes to it. Notice here Peter said, "And will melt with fervent heat, and the works therein burn up." &gt;&gt; Not the planet, the works therein. &gt;&gt; The works of man, all their politicians and their schemes and all their denominations and man-made schemes will all go with it &gt;&gt; when it burns. And and heavens will pass away with a great noise. Did you notice here? Heavens will pass away with great noise. Listen, the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases that's in the earth and explode it. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Talk the Bible said here, Peter said, "And the heavens will pass away in earth with a great noise." &gt;&gt; Such an explosion will rock it. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Cause it's got to kill every disease, every thistle, every thorn, everything there is to be done. The fire will burn it up. &gt;&gt; And remember, it's not altogether just a literal fire. It's also a holy fire. &gt;&gt; See, that will take away Satan. All of his, &gt;&gt; all the devils, both heaven and earth, amen, &gt;&gt; will pass away, killing all the germs, all insects, all natural life on it and around it. Even the H2O, the water will explode. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; Talk about a noise. You think that little noise I hear in Tucson was something when he opened the six seals that shook the country around about and caused the talk. Wait till this earth receives our baptism. &gt;&gt; You know when a man receives the baptism of fire, there's a lot of noise around there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They think that's shame to hear people scream and shout like that. Just wait till this earth gets her baptism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll explain exploit the H2O, the water. For the Bible said here in Revelation 21, and there was no more sea exploit. This will change the whole surface of the entire earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She'll burst and blow to pieces. &gt;&gt; All the outside the crust and for hundreds of feet below it'll just simply be completely demolished. That's right. &gt;&gt; The atmospheres, the gases that's in the earth now where they're finding these missiles that can't get to it. A great sphere up in there way up in some kind of a sphere that there's all kinds of gases they say and that'll burst. &gt;&gt; The holy wrath of God will come up on it &gt;&gt; and will cleanse it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will change the entire service. Now, many of you won't put on this word, the Greek word pass away. It comes from the word I had to find. I thought, how's this world going to pass away? And yet, we're going to live on it. But if you'll notice, some of you people wants to put it down. I'll spell it for you. I couldn't pronounce it. P A R E R E C H O M I A. I don't know how to pronounce it. Now that way as I said when I get the inspiration strikes me for something then I go back to find out the word now here I can't spell the word I can't I can't pronounce it but in that the Lord is still give me a way I go and find out what that word means then I got it &gt;&gt; then I got it again see heavens and earth will pass away now this word means passing from one form to another it does not mean annihilation as the English word would mean pass away. It's annihilated. But the Hebrew word or the Greek word here does not mean pass away. It means from passing from one thing to another. Look, but to pass from one condition, it says to another. Now notice Paul used it. If you want to read it now, put it down, you can read it later. And Titus 3:5, Paul is using this same word means regeneration of man. that man has passed from a sinner to a saint. Not completely annihilated. When a man's changed, he isn't annihilated, but he's a changed person. &gt;&gt; He's been changed from what he was to what he is. &gt;&gt; Not annihilating. Jesus used the same word in Matthew 19:28. Now, not 28:19 now. 19:28. He said to them, "You're set with me in my father's kingdom regenerated." You see, changed. When you're changed, he used the same word. And he used the same word when he said to the cult that loose the colt and let him go. Said the same thing at the resurrection of Lazarus. Loose him. &gt;&gt; Change him. &gt;&gt; He's been tied. Let him go. &gt;&gt; What does it mean? The earth will be loose from the grip of Satan. &gt;&gt; It'll be loose. It'll be loose from politics. It'll be loose from denominational religious systems &gt;&gt; to be used for the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; to be established here on the earth. But as long it's in the hands of Satan, politics, Satan, the ruler of the earth, he owns it. It belonged to him. But now Christ has redeemed it. &gt;&gt; One time I was his property, but not now. Amen. &gt;&gt; One time that little woman was his property, but not now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He come to loose the grip of it. &gt;&gt; He loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my life, upon your life, and now we're not his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you often heard me say in prayer, "Take your hands off of God's property." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have faith to claim your own. &gt;&gt; That's your rights. &gt;&gt; Take your hands off of her. Take your hands off of him. See faith will do it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Not annihilate it, but just take your hands off of it &gt;&gt; to loose it. Let it go. Pass it away. It changes. The earth will change. Politics will change. The religions will change. The denominations will pass away. Politics will pass away. The kingdom of God shall be established. We read in John uh read John in Revelation 6:14. See, it departed as a scroll. The Bible said the that it John said, "I saw the heaven and earth depart as a scroll." John Revelation 6:14, Jesus said, "Heavens and earth shall pass away." Or other words, heavens and earth shall be changed. Use that same word right there again. No, not annihilated. For later in Revelations 21 2- 24, he seen the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven and sitting upon this earth. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that it'll be annihilated. The systems will be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Daniel saw the same thing. rock struck the world will shoot out without hands and the whole image of the systems was broke down and become like a champ on a summer thrashing floor and the wind packed it away &gt;&gt; and the rock itself grew into a great mountain that covered the earth. &gt;&gt; Watch that mountain now in a little bit. That mountain covered the earth. Also, we find out here over also in Revelations there, it said the kings of the new earth will bring their honor and glory into it. And the earth is sitting, the new Jerusalem is sitting on this earth. &gt;&gt; See, it just changed. You're the same man and statue that you was when God called you, &gt;&gt; same woman. &gt;&gt; But you see what it did? It was a regeneration. The old life passed away. The old desires passed away. When you used to like to drink and cuss and fuss and stew and run around and immoral, that thing just died. &gt;&gt; See, but now you are used and you was Satan's instrument. Now you are redeemed. &gt;&gt; And that's what the world would be the same way. Redeemed &gt;&gt; a new heavens and new earth just like you. You are a new creature. &gt;&gt; And the Greek word there, anybody knows said you are a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. A new creation in the same old temple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Watch what happens here now. Glorious. All right. Now we find that this earth will hold the kings of the earth. And again in Matthew 5:5, Jesus said, "The meek shall inherit the earth." &gt;&gt; It isn't going to just go to have another earth. It's just going to be the same earth. I'm trying to get the the plan of redemption to you before if it don't get nothing else. See, the baptism a fire on it only is to cleanse it and make it a fit place for his meek to live in. &gt;&gt; Oh, like he did us this creation to live in. Before he could come in it, he had to give us the baptism of fire. &gt;&gt; Then the Holy Ghost come in and live. &gt;&gt; Baptism of fire. Then when you get that baptism of fire, then the Holy Ghost can come in. What does it does? It burns up everything contrary to the word out of you. &gt;&gt; It won't believe nothing else but the word &gt;&gt; because it is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we was talking the other day. The evidence of the Holy Ghost. See the evidence of the Holy Ghost when you can receive the word &gt;&gt; not some system &gt;&gt; but have a clear understand. How you know the word is clear understand? What's it vindicate itself? &gt;&gt; Well you say I see this to it that oh yes weeds live the same way. &gt;&gt; See but it's got to be the entire word. &gt;&gt; To be the bride you have to be part of him. He is the word. &gt;&gt; See and what a part of him is it the word that's promised for this day when he calls his bride. You're part of that. You get it? &gt;&gt; Don't Don't lose that. Now, notice. &gt;&gt; And he makes it a fit place to live through eternity. Notice this is still not referred to uh this millennium reign. The thousand years is not the new earth. See, the millennium reign is a different reign. That's what we go into the millennium. That isn't a new earth, a new heaven. No. No. That's just a rest place, a rest period. Not at all. The new heavens and new earth. For see, in the millennium, we have things that would not go into that. It's a type of the old seventh day out of Eden. The seventh day after he made the world. The seventh day he rested in Eden. And the millennium, see, the world has now almost 6,000 years old. See, every 2,000 year has had a a destruction. See, first 200 the flood came and he baptized it with what? &gt;&gt; Water. Next 200 Jesus come to sanctify and clean it, dropped his blood upon it, called it his. All right, I'll come again now as king with his queen. And the second 2,000 years, what does he do? He comes and gives his rest spirit and then burns her off and claims it for his own. &gt;&gt; Puts his own back on it. And notice, not the perfect world. This millennium, it's a type of the seventh day. Then comes the white throne judgment. See, we still have judgment. We're still in time in the millennium. It's a day 1,000 years. It's a time element, not don't get that mixed up with the new earth now, because it's not. You must say this to me. I this somebody might say this to me that uh now, brother Brandham, what do you go to do now? You've run out of your complete sevens. What are you going to do now? Now you're a dispensationalist, which I am. I believe it. God is too. No, notice you run out of dispensation types. For if you're going to put something beyond that seventh day, how you going to get it? Where are you going to now? All right. I'll call your attention to something. I I had a dispensation yet. I got another scripture here. And remember, all of it has to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Every bit of it. &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Brother Bram, you're trying to put something way over yonder beyond that seventh day. That seventh day Sabbath as God made the earth and labored six days and rested the seventh is only a type of time." &gt;&gt; Time. &gt;&gt; But I've just said here, we become eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So where's your type now? You said your typology just so you you've run out of types now. No, I haven't. Let's just find out if we have. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Leviticus back in the 23rd chapter of Leviticus. I want you to notice in Leviticus where we was at last Sunday or this what gave me the idea right here. The 23rd chapter of Leviticus and the 26th verse. Now remember there is seven feast days. The feast of trumpets, the feast of of tabernacles, the feast of the sheath waving, the all this is seven great feast days. That was only a type of the seven church ages. And you remember how many Sabbaths there was between one and the other. See, seven Sabbaths between Pentecost and the trumpets, which was seven church ages. And there was seven feast days that represent the seven church ages. Keep your numbers running. say, "Well, now Brother Bram, you're done. Run out. You got your seven." All right, let's take the last feast, which is the feast of tabernacles. Now, notice here in the 36th verse, seven days shall you offer offerings made of fire unto the Lord. On the eighth day, &gt;&gt; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's another holy time coming, holy commutation unto you, and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, and it is a solemn assembly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you shall do no terrible work therein. &gt;&gt; Now, we got an eighth day. &gt;&gt; Now, there's only seven days, but yeah, we speak of the eighth day holy conversation. Uh combination, notice, do no work in it. The eighth day are what? back to the first thing. &gt;&gt; What speaks of eternity &gt;&gt; is she rolls around without a stop in place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Notice it was also upon this eighth day, last day, feast day of the tabernacle. Notice after that, after the last feast day, at the last church age, at the last complete seven days upon the earth, after the millennium, that this holy convocation comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember this is feast of tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Gathering places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where in the millennium the Bible said they shall build houses, &gt;&gt; they shall inhabit. But in the new earth, he's already when prepared the place it's built. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with the building of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Eternal. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love that word. My Amen. How many love the word? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Trust the Lord Jesus will bless you. Let's sing that song.
