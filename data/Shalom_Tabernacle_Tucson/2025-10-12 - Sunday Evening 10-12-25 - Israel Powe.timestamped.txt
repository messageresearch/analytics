[6:24] Bread of heaven.

[6:33] know.
[6:37] Here's my cup.
[6:40] Fill it up.
[6:42] and make me whole. Maybe we can sing the
[6:45] verse. Like the woman at the well. Just
[6:48] like the woman
[6:52] and the man
[6:55] I was seeking
[6:58] [Music]
[7:01] for the things
[7:05] that could not satisfy.
[7:13] Oh, but then
[7:17] I heard
[7:19] my savior speaking.
[7:24] Draw
[7:26] from my well
[7:29] that never shall run dry.
[7:36] Just fill my cup.
[7:42] I lift it up.
[7:46] Lord,
[7:49] come and quench
[7:53] this thirst
[7:55] of my soul.
[8:01] Bread of heaven,
[8:06] feed me till I want
[8:11] no.
[8:14] Here's my cup.
[8:17] Fill it up
[8:19] and make me whole.
[8:24] Let's all stand together tonight. And
[8:26] brother Tim Robson, would you come and
[8:28] open our service with a word of prayer
[8:29] tonight?
[8:31] [Music]
[8:42] Lord, thank you Lord for keeping us each
[8:44] one safe. Lord, thank you for all the
[8:46] new babies that we have. Lord, thank you
[8:49] Lord for such a great pastor, such a
[8:52] great church, Lord. Pray you bless each
[8:55] one, Lord, and fulfill the needs of each
[8:56] one. Speak to everyone I pray in Jesus
[9:00] name.
[9:04] Amen. Let me just remain standing for a
[9:08] little bit.
[9:09] We'll sing a couple songs and we'll let
[9:11] you we'll let you sit a little bit. But
[9:14] Joy and I were at a church in New
[9:16] Hampshire a couple Sundays ago. And it's
[9:18] just you realize how we just get
[9:20] accustomed to to things. And you know,
[9:23] we stand what we think is too long. And
[9:26] you know, boy, the song leader is
[9:27] keeping me up too long. He's not being
[9:29] thoughtful. And we go to a church and I
[9:32] don't know thousand people. Joy probably
[9:34] stood for the first 20 25 minutes. All
[9:37] ages nobody thought about sitting down.
[9:39] And we just we get used to things. So
[9:41] let's get out of our comfort zone.
[9:42] That's what that's what formality is all
[9:44] about. And so God just we can be formal
[9:48] being just complacent. And so let's
[9:51] let's just try to break that mold a
[9:53] little bit tonight. Amen. He's alive and
[9:56] well. He's living in me to tell king of
[9:59] G. He's alive
[10:03] and well. He's living in me
[10:07] to tell
[10:10] the world
[10:12] that he is the same.
[10:17] [Applause]
[10:18] world. He is the same
[10:21] yesterday,
[10:24] today,
[10:26] and forever.

[10:44] to tell
[10:47] the world
[10:49] that he is the same.

[11:03] and forever.
[11:06] Jesus
[11:08] is alive
[11:10] and well.
[11:12] The same Jesus. Now, this same Jesus
[11:17] who died
[11:19] on the cross,
[11:22] crucified,
[11:24] is alive
[11:26] in our hearts
[11:29] today.
[11:33] He's resurrected.

[11:56] living in me

[12:06] the same.
[12:10] Well, he is the same
[12:13] yesterday,
[12:15] today,
[12:17] and forever.
[12:20] Jesus
[12:22] is alive
[12:25] and this promise he gives.
[12:29] out of this prom.
[12:31] I sing it
[12:34] to show that he lives
[12:38] in all
[12:41] who truly
[12:43] believe.
[12:47] The words that I do, they will be done
[12:54] by you. Oh, praise God. He's alive
[13:01] and well.
[13:05] Yes, he's alive
[13:08] and well,
[13:10] living in me
[13:13] to tell
[13:15] the world
[13:18] that he is
[13:20] the same.
[13:24] He is the same
[13:26] yesterday,
[13:29] today,
[13:31] and forever.
[13:34] Jesus
[13:36] is alive
[13:39] and well.
[13:42] Amen. You can be seated.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; You're all scared
[13:47] thinking, "Oh, no." He say he's going to
[13:48] keep us stand the whole song service
[13:50] tonight.
[13:51] You're welcome to stand. I'm not sitting
[13:53] down for the song service. You're
[13:54] welcome to stand if you'd like to, but
[13:57] Amen. Let's
[13:59] stay in the key of G.
[14:02] [Music]
[14:04] Who taught the sun
[14:07] where to stand in the morning?
[14:12] And who told the ocean you can only come
[14:17] as far?
[14:22] And who show the moon
[14:26] where to hide till evening
[14:29] whose words alone can catch a falling
[14:34] star.

[20:05] Well, I used to be oh so sad. Oh, but
[20:09] now I'm free and glad.
[20:13] For Jesus got a hold of my life and he

[20:18] tonight? Let's sing that one more time.
[20:21] For Jesus got a hold of my life and he

[20:44] [Music]
[20:46] Jesus got a hold of my love. He won't
[20:49] let me go.
[20:54] Sometimes I remember when I used to be
[20:57] living in sin.
[21:02] I tried to act happy and free, but I
[21:05] wasn't with it.
[21:10] Well, I pulled a lot of friends of mine.
[21:13] Oh, they thought I had peace of mind.
[21:18] But I never had a thing until I opened

[21:30] won't let me go.

[22:00] Well, aren't you getting just a bit
[22:02] tired of fooling around?
[22:05] [Music]
[22:08] You try to laugh your way through life,
[22:11] but you're not gaining ground.
[22:16] Why not try the Lord today?
[22:20] Oh, just ask him in your heart to stay
[22:24] and you'll find Jesus love will be the
[22:27] greatest thing that you ever found.
[22:33] Something in my life will let me go.

[25:43] account. The recruiter from my company
[25:46] found me through Lykan, called me and

[39:02] of Mara.
[39:04] He'll sweeten
[39:06] for thee.
[39:09] He drank all the bitter
[39:14] and gas.
[39:20] Lord,
[39:22] I believe.
[39:26] Lord,
[39:28] I believe
[39:32] all things are possible.
[39:38] Lord, I
[39:40] believe.
[39:43] Lord,
[39:45] I believe.
[39:49] Lord,
[39:51] I believe.
[39:55] All things are possible.
[40:00] Lord, I believe.
[40:06] Fear not,
[40:08] little flock.
[40:12] Whatever
[40:14] your might,
[40:17] he enters
[40:20] all
[40:22] the doors
[40:25] shut.
[40:27] He never
[40:30] forsakes.
[40:33] He never
[40:35] is gone.
[40:38] So count on
[40:41] his presence
[40:44] in darkness
[40:47] and
[40:50] only
[40:52] beings.
[41:02] All things are possible.
[41:08] would
[41:10] be
[41:14] only
[41:21] here.
[41:25] All things
[41:27] are impossible.
[41:32] [Music]
[41:39] [Applause]
[41:46] Amen.
[41:49] Let's stand together if we could
[41:51] tonight.
[41:52] And Sister Hope wasn't here this
[41:54] morning, so she didn't know that our
[41:57] service was about
[41:59] us being sheep and him being the good
[42:01] shepherd. And
[42:02] &gt;&gt; and then we don't sing the verses to
[42:04] that song very often. And so just fear
[42:06] not, little flock. How encouraging that
[42:08] is. We know that God is mindful of
[42:10] everything we're going through. And just
[42:12] thinking through, we're picking out the
[42:13] songs this morning for the musicians.
[42:15] And one that we hadn't sung for a long
[42:18] time, come and dine, the master calleth.
[42:20] And the second verse of that, the
[42:22] disciples came to land. He satisfies the
[42:26] hungry every time. And then brother
[42:27] Israel
[42:29] comes out and takes the text just a
[42:32] couple verses after that when he was
[42:34] talking to the disciples there. And he's
[42:35] just so mindful. I just I love the
[42:37] beauty of that where you just see God is
[42:39] orchestrating,
[42:41] you know, we we get in the way of him
[42:43] doing what he wants to do, but I just
[42:45] thankful that he can use his imperfect
[42:47] flesh and you know that he gets all the
[42:49] praise, honor, and glory out of it. So
[42:51] maybe we could sing one. It's we don't
[42:53] have it on the the sheet, but it's
[42:57] gentle shepherd.
[42:59] Do we know that one?
[43:02] Sort of.
[43:04] All right.
[43:05] figure out what key we do that one in.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Gentle
[43:13] sheer
[43:18] come and lead
[43:22] us.
[43:25] For we need
[43:29] you to help us find our way.
[43:39] Gentle
[43:40] shepher
[43:45] come and feed
[43:49] us
[43:50] [Music]
[43:52] for we need
[43:56] your strength from day to day.
[44:02] And there's no other.
[44:04] Oh, and there's no other
[44:12] we can turn
[44:15] to.
[44:19] Who can help
[44:22] us
[44:24] face another
[44:27] day?
[44:30] [Music]
[44:32] Gentle
[44:34] shepher
[44:39] come and lead
[44:42] us
[44:45] for we need
[44:49] you to help us find our way. We just
[44:55] sing that one more time. Come and lead
[44:57] us, Lord.
[44:58] Oh gentle
[45:01] shepher
[45:06] come and lead
[45:09] us
[45:12] for we need
[45:16] you
[45:17] to help us find our way. Gentle shepherd
[45:23] come and feed us.
[45:26] Oh gentle
[45:28] shepher
[45:30] [Music]
[45:33] come and feed
[45:37] us
[45:40] for we need
[45:44] your strength from day to day. There's
[45:49] no other that we can turn to.
[45:53] Oh, and there's no other
[46:00] that we can turn
[46:04] to.
[46:08] Who can help
[46:11] us to face
[46:14] another
[46:16] day?
[46:20] Oh gentle
[46:23] shepher
[46:28] come and lead
[46:31] us
[46:35] for we need
[46:38] you to help us
[46:42] &gt;&gt; find our way.
[46:46] Thank you. Amen. Let us pray.
[46:50] Gentle shepherd, we ask you to lead us
[46:53] through your word tonight. Lead us by
[46:55] your holy spirit to green pastures.
[46:58] Lord, food for our souls. We pray.
[47:01] Father, we commit ourselves to you our
[47:03] hearing, our understanding, our very
[47:07] spirit and our life. We open it up to
[47:09] you and you alone, Lord. And may you
[47:12] give to each one what they have need of
[47:14] at this junction of the journey. Oh
[47:17] Lord, we thank you for the songs that
[47:19] have gone forward. Thinking of that
[47:21] song, only believe Lord of you, the good
[47:26] shepherd, Lord. You lead your children.
[47:30] Fear not, little flock, Lord. We are
[47:32] part of that flock tonight. May you
[47:35] bless us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[47:39] God bless you, saints. So good to be in
[47:41] house of the Lord with you tonight.
[47:43] Amen. It's always good to see each of
[47:45] you. We'd like to go right into the
[47:48] word. Thank you, Sister Hope, for that
[47:50] song. Very nice. And um, Brother Zach,
[47:54] very nice. And the songs this morning,
[47:56] God bless you. A portion of scripture we
[48:00] like to turn to
[48:03] quickly is in Genesis chapter 18.
[48:31] And the Lord appeared unto him in the
[48:33] plains of Meamra, and he sat in the tent
[48:36] door in the heat of the day. He lifted
[48:38] up his eyes and looked, and lo, three
[48:41] men stood by him. And when he saw them,
[48:43] he ran to meet them from the tent door
[48:46] and bowed himself towards the ground.
[48:49] And he said, "My Lord, if now I have
[48:51] found favor in thy sight, pass not away.
[48:54] I pray thee from thy servant. Let a
[48:57] little water, I pray you, be fetched,
[49:00] wash your feet, and rest yourselves
[49:02] under the tree. And I will fetch a
[49:05] morsel of bread, and comfort ye your
[49:08] hearts." Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; After that ye shall pass on, for
[49:13] therefore are you come
[49:16] or you come to your servant. And they
[49:19] said, so do as thou hast said.
[49:24] And Abraham hastened into the tent unto
[49:27] Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly
[49:29] three measures of fine meal needed, make
[49:33] cakes upon the earth. And Abraham ran
[49:35] unto the herd, fetched a calf tender,
[49:38] good, and gave it unto the young man.
[49:41] And he hasted to dress it. And he took
[49:43] butter and milk, and the calf which he
[49:46] had dressed, and set it before them. He
[49:49] stood by them under the tree, and they
[49:51] did eat.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; And they said unto him,
[49:56] Where is Sarah, thy wife? And he said,
[49:58] Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will
[50:01] certainly return unto thee according to
[50:03] the time of life, and lo, Sarah thy wife
[50:06] shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in
[50:09] the tent door which was behind him. Now
[50:12] Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[50:14] stricken in age, and it ceased to be
[50:16] with Sarah after the manner of women.
[50:19] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[50:23] saying, After I am wax old, shall I have
[50:25] pleasure, my lord being old also? And
[50:28] the Lord said unto Abraham, "Wherefore
[50:31] did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I have a
[50:34] shorty bear a child which am old? Is
[50:38] there anything too hard for the Lord?"
[50:41] &gt;&gt; At the time appointed, I will return
[50:43] unto thee according to the time of life,
[50:46] and Sarah shall have a son.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not,
[50:51] for she was afraid. And he said, Nay,
[50:54] but thou did laugh. And the man rose up
[50:58] from then and looked toward Sodom.
[50:59] Abraham went with them to bring them on
[51:03] the way. And the Lord said, "Shall I
[51:06] hide from Abraham the things which I
[51:09] do?" Amen. It's a beautiful scene in the
[51:13] scripture and it is absolutely relevant
[51:16] to to our day today. Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So may God bless his word. Let us
[51:24] pray one more time. Lord Jesus, as we
[51:27] enter into this portion of the service,
[51:30] Lord, may you bless us. May we say what
[51:33] you want us to say. And may the Holy
[51:36] Spirit let us hear what you want us to
[51:38] hear for your divine glory and praise.
[51:42] It's in Jesus name we ask. Amen. Amen.
[51:46] God bless you. You can be seated.
[51:48] Certainly enjoy the presence of the Lord
[51:50] this morning. We like that Holy Spirit
[51:53] coming down and blessing us in his word
[51:57] in the atmosphere of worship and praise.
[52:00] Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. We long for more of that. Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that the Lord um gives
[52:08] us those little moments of refreshing.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Tonight, we're going to continue in this
[52:15] uh feeding of the sheep and this hidden
[52:18] food. And the prophet of God is dealing
[52:22] with this in the message spiritual food
[52:25] in due season 1965.
[52:27] If you have a chance to go and hear that
[52:29] and read that in that message, brother
[52:32] Bannam is uh really laying out the
[52:35] judgment that is predicted upon the age
[52:39] and that we are in a time of judgment.
[52:43] And he goes and he mentions that he was
[52:46] in up in sunset there
[52:50] &gt;&gt; where the angels came down and he
[52:53] started to relay the story of him
[52:56] talking with brother Mchuse
[52:58] about his eye about his mother being
[53:01] healed and then how that great blast
[53:04] came down and spoke three words judgment
[53:07] is striking the west coast.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; He said it was a blast. Brother Mchuse,
[53:12] if you all remember when he gives his
[53:13] testimony, he said he was there, he only
[53:16] heard two blasts, but brother Bam said
[53:19] there was three blasts. And those three
[53:21] blasts were three words.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Judgment striking the West Coast. It's
[53:27] very tremendous. And it's in this
[53:29] message that the judgments of God being
[53:33] over the age over the nation that
[53:36] brother Bannam is now bringing Elijah
[53:39] having a safe place during the judgment.
[53:42] And he said, "I'm going to type Elijah
[53:43] with the church, the last day church
[53:46] that is hidden away during these
[53:48] judgments."
[53:49] &gt;&gt; And this is why you and I are alive
[53:51] today.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; It's because we have hidden food that's
[53:55] been stored up for us. Amen. Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And so he um um says that the Lord
[54:03] provided a secret place for Elijah.
[54:08] And paragraph number 37 in spiritual
[54:10] food in due season, the prophet of God
[54:12] says this. He says, "Now Elijah during
[54:15] that time had a secret place that God
[54:18] had ordained for him to go." That's the
[54:20] thing we want to see now just before we
[54:22] have the prayer line. Elijah had a
[54:25] secret place provided provided by God
[54:28] himself.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Now, the church never provided it for
[54:32] him. The king never provided it for him.
[54:36] He didn't provide it himself. But God
[54:39] provided a secret place for Elijah to be
[54:43] fed all the time during the drought.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Where his food was provided day by day.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't need to wonder what's
[54:51] going to happen tomorrow or wonder if
[54:54] the supply would run out. God said, "I
[54:57] have pro commanded the ravens. They'll
[55:00] feed you." What a wonderful thing. A
[55:03] type of our secret place in Christ. Do
[55:07] you have a secret place?
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Do you you got a secret place in Christ
[55:12] &gt;&gt; where he has provided for you? When the
[55:16] world council and all that's going on
[55:18] today that says the days of miracles is
[55:20] passed, the great powers of God has been
[55:22] taken out of the churches, they seem
[55:24] like anymore they don't have nothing but
[55:26] a sounding brass and a tingling symbol.
[55:29] We know that to be truth, the form of
[55:32] godliness and denying the power thereof.
[55:36] Now, so brother Madam goes deeper into
[55:39] this message and um says this in
[55:43] paragraph 157. I trust this will be a
[55:45] blessing to you.
[55:48] He says,
[55:50] paragraph 158, it says, "Now the man who
[55:52] preaches the social gospel don't believe
[55:56] that all. He'd walk up to the door, look
[55:59] in, and stand there and say, well, just
[56:01] another bunch of holy rollers walk
[56:04] away." But he don't know that this is
[56:07] the hidden food.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; He don't know that this is the secret
[56:11] thing that's hid from him. He don't
[56:14] know. It's It's pitiful. A mind that's
[56:18] naked, miserable, blind, and don't know
[56:20] it. See, that's a bad thing. Oh, God,
[56:23] let me die first. But don't never get me
[56:26] like that. I'd rather die. Yes, sir.
[56:29] than to do that. I think every one of
[56:31] us, wouldn't we? But now, God has
[56:34] promised us these things in the last
[56:36] days in Malachi 4.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. said that Jesus Christ would come
[56:41] down and impersonate himself in human
[56:44] flesh like he did at Sodom.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. And said the world will be
[56:49] in a solemn condition and said as it was
[56:52] then the son of man will be revealed
[56:54] that day.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; See this man that come down in the form
[56:58] of a man which was Elohim by Abraham
[57:03] before his promised son came. Look what
[57:06] it was. Abraham said it was God.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Now remember in our the the water
[57:13] baptism message we brought on Wednesday.
[57:16] And here Abraham sees the Bible says
[57:18] three men came to him. But Abraham
[57:21] addresses only one as Lord.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; The three are one. There's only one
[57:28] Lord.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Never separates them. He calls him Lord.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Continue. says and the Bible said there
[57:34] was three men came to him dust on their
[57:36] clothes travel sat down and eat like men
[57:40] and Jesus said just at that time the
[57:43] world gets in the sodom condition then
[57:45] the son of man would reveal himself
[57:47] again
[57:48] &gt;&gt; not son of god son of man see would
[57:53] reveal himself
[57:56] &gt;&gt; so what is this language for isn't the
[57:58] son of god just as easy to say as the
[58:00] son of man
[58:02] &gt;&gt; no no No, no, no. Son of man.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; He makes that makes that uh uh very very
[58:07] clear that wording that the son of man
[58:11] would reveal himself.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Now Mark that with the last prophet
[58:16] said, "Behold, I send to you Elijah the
[58:19] prophet."
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; He will restore the hearts of the
[58:23] children back to the father. see
[58:26] &gt;&gt; a message to bring them back to the pe
[58:29] back to the Bible. And the son of man
[58:32] will be revealing himself in that day.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; And at that day, the sounding of the
[58:37] last churches, the seventh angel, the
[58:40] mystery of God should be made known in
[58:42] that day. The seven seals will be
[58:45] broken. The mysteries of all these
[58:47] churches and things, how they happen and
[58:50] how taking place. So here
[58:52] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God is making it clear
[58:55] that this man that was revealed in
[58:59] Genesis 18 and tying it with the man
[59:03] that's to be revealed in the last days
[59:06] &gt;&gt; is the son of man.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; How many enjoy the chief shepherd
[59:12] message this morning?
[59:13] &gt;&gt; That Jesus Christ is our chief shepherd.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; How many know that there's a prophet
[59:17] shepherd?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how you know that there is a
[59:20] local shepherd.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Now all of these shepherds are still
[59:24] sheep.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the lamb of God.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Yet he was the chief shepherd. The
[59:32] prophet is still a sheep. Yet he was a
[59:34] prophet shepherd.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; And the local shepherds, they're still
[59:38] sheep.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; But their calling is a local shepherd.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And the congregants are sheep.
[59:45] And I read for you that many places,
[59:50] many times, brother Bannon refers to the
[59:52] local shepherd or the pastors as
[59:55] prophets.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; In the New Testament sense, as prophets,
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; but that's preachers. That's not an Old
[1:00:03] Testament terminology as a prophet. But
[1:00:06] nowhere did he ever type the New
[1:00:10] Testament preacher prophets as son of
[1:00:14] man.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; That is only one that holds that office
[1:00:18] to reveal the son of man.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And it's food for us in this last day.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; It's actually hidden food.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; It's food for your soul. And the people
[1:00:34] that are not eating this food, you see
[1:00:37] why they handled the message the way
[1:00:39] they handled it.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; They handled it like it's a secondary
[1:00:43] reference point. They handled it like
[1:00:45] brother Banner was just a good brother,
[1:00:47] a good man, like an evangelist on the
[1:00:50] field. No, no, no. Let's make that very
[1:00:53] clear. This was not just a man
[1:00:55] preaching.
[1:00:57] This was the office of a prophet
[1:01:00] revealing
[1:01:02] the son of man.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; A prophet,
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; a son of man revealing
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; the son of man. So Genesis 18 can never
[1:01:13] be read the same way again.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Genesis 18,
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon bring comes to the
[1:01:21] pullpit, turns his back to the audience.
[1:01:25] He said to prove to you that the same
[1:01:29] angel that was in Genesis 18 is here
[1:01:34] tonight.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He performs the same sign, the same
[1:01:38] wonder. There's no pastor, there's no
[1:01:40] five-fold minister, there's no group,
[1:01:43] there's no elder that can ever
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; replicate Genesis 18. Can I get a
[1:01:50] witness?
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. is hidden food.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And you'll see why many people handle
[1:01:59] the message the way they do because they
[1:02:02] lack this opening of the word.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Now look at this here. Brother Bham
[1:02:08] says,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; see paragraph 158. But he don't know
[1:02:13] that this is hidden food.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; He don't know that this is the secret
[1:02:17] thing that's hid from him. He doesn't
[1:02:20] know it. It's pitiful. a mind that's
[1:02:24] miserable and naked. And he brings in
[1:02:26] Genesis 18. Did you notice Abraham how
[1:02:29] he's moving very quickly? You notice in
[1:02:32] Genesis 18, he makes haste. He's telling
[1:02:35] Sarah to hurry up.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; He's telling the young man to go get a
[1:02:39] calf.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; No processed food here.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; This is real food.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; She got to go make that. You got to go
[1:02:47] make that that cake. Make it hastily. go
[1:02:50] get the the the tender lamb and cut him
[1:02:53] up and he's running and he's moving and
[1:02:55] he's offering this food to the Lord.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet tells us that the same
[1:03:03] angel that was there is here tonight. He
[1:03:08] proved that.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; What other minister could do that?
[1:03:12] Whoever whoever did that like that, you
[1:03:14] know, let me say this, saints. This
[1:03:17] message is the truth.
[1:03:20] And it's not just partial truth.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; There is no equivalent message that
[1:03:26] anybody is preaching anywhere in this
[1:03:30] entire age to compare with the hidden
[1:03:34] manner that was to come down in our
[1:03:37] generation.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; We're a privileged people.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:03:45] So now this hidden mana, this hidden
[1:03:48] food here, what the prophet of God says
[1:03:51] in reference to Revelations chapter 2,
[1:03:54] he says he'll give them hidden mana.
[1:03:57] Paragraph 275. Hidden mana. Let's give
[1:04:00] the interpretation the best we can. I'm
[1:04:02] reading what does hidden mana type.
[1:04:05] Hidden mana was the manner that was kept
[1:04:08] in the place or the showbread in the
[1:04:10] Bible that was only for the priest. How
[1:04:13] many know knows that around? See now
[1:04:17] that he had bread for the congregation.
[1:04:20] They had bread for the congregation. But
[1:04:22] there was a special bread for the
[1:04:24] priest. Is that right?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; This is a special bread.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; A special bread, hidden mana.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; What is it? Who is our mana? Christ. All
[1:04:35] right. St. John the 6th chapter 48th
[1:04:38] 50th verse. If you're putting it down,
[1:04:40] Jesus said, "The bread of life that come
[1:04:42] from God out of heaven, the mana." Well,
[1:04:45] what is the hidden mana? The mana that
[1:04:48] isn't given to all the congregation, the
[1:04:51] revelation is poured out upon the angel
[1:04:53] of the church. The revelation of the
[1:04:56] word, see, revelation of the word is
[1:04:59] given to the angel of that age. For it's
[1:05:03] hid from everywhere
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; and revealed back the hidden mana. It's
[1:05:10] addressed to the angel of the church.
[1:05:12] See, you get it.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; It's a little bigger revelation of what
[1:05:17] Christ is.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe a little higher calling.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; So, is brother Bam the seventh angel?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. You can't you can't mess
[1:05:28] with that. If he is the seventh angel,
[1:05:30] then he has a hidden mana.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that hidden mana is a little
[1:05:34] more
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; than just the congregation can get.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So we can all read the same scripture.
[1:05:40] We can all read the same history. But if
[1:05:43] God doesn't reveal it
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; and God has revealed this mana to our
[1:05:49] messenger.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Now after it's revealed to the
[1:05:52] messenger, he now brings it to the sheep
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; that's following his message.
[1:05:58] So we are the benefactors
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; of the heaven hidden manner. Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; That should have put a smile on your
[1:06:07] face.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Even if you tired,
[1:06:10] a tired smile should come on your face
[1:06:13] because the revelation that we have
[1:06:15] received,
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; came from Almighty God.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; It's the hidden mana and that's what
[1:06:22] we're feeding on.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go along tonight.
[1:06:26] I'm just going to go until I stop. Okay.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; And this hidden manner,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; is revealed
[1:06:36] to the angel of the age.
[1:06:39] And then it's brought down to the people
[1:06:42] of the age. It's revelation. Now, let's
[1:06:46] go a little bit further.
[1:06:48] When we talk about revelation,
[1:06:52] the prophet of God talks about the
[1:06:53] greatest of all revelations
[1:06:56] and he uses this terms in
[1:07:01] the Patmas vision.
[1:07:05] He says this here
[1:07:08] and there's a reason why
[1:07:11] he brings this in paragraph 132.
[1:07:15] Um, if we had time, we would read Acts
[1:07:18] chapter 2
[1:07:20] and 38 and show you where
[1:07:24] Peter in his original message was,
[1:07:27] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:07:30] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:07:33] sins. What was he doing? He was showing
[1:07:36] that Matthew 28:19
[1:07:40] is being fulfilled right now with the
[1:07:42] way I'm going to do this baptism.
[1:07:45] So Jesus gave the command go
[1:07:49] teach and baptize in the name of the
[1:07:52] father, son, and holy ghost. That was
[1:07:54] the command.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; But the obedience to that command was in
[1:07:59] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; This is a revelation that Peter had
[1:08:05] showing that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:08:10] the father, the son, and the holy ghost.
[1:08:13] That's right.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You must know who this is when you're
[1:08:16] going to pray to him.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; If there are three different people, who
[1:08:19] are you praying to?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Which one is your friend? Which one is
[1:08:23] above you? Which one is in you?
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; They're all the same.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; But the strict trinitarian view moves
[1:08:31] you away from this great revelation. But
[1:08:33] the Bible keeps it very clean for us,
[1:08:36] doesn't it?
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it. Peter and Paul did it.
[1:08:42] And so this is the great revelation that
[1:08:44] was poured out. Brother Bannam is taken
[1:08:47] in Revelations chapter 1
[1:08:50] verses 10 and 11. It says this here
[1:08:52] paragraph 132. A great one's
[1:08:55] approaching. A trumpet sounds.
[1:08:58] Somebody's coming. He looked.
[1:09:00] Hallelujah. Trumpet saying I am alpha
[1:09:03] and omega
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; the first and the last. Not an
[1:09:07] announcement of a second party or a
[1:09:09] third party, but the only party.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; I'm both alpha and omega.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Before I show you anything, I want to
[1:09:19] let you know who I am.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; The greatest of all revelations is the
[1:09:26] deity.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; The supreme deity of our Lord Jesus
[1:09:31] Christ.
[1:09:32] You can't get to first base until you
[1:09:34] believe that.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's what Peter said. Repent and then
[1:09:39] see the deity. Be baptized in the name
[1:09:42] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:09:44] your sins. And then you're ready to go
[1:09:46] in the spirit.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; The first thing you have to know is the
[1:09:51] deity of Christ. I am alpha and omega.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; I am from A to Z.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; There's no more but me. I was at the
[1:10:01] beginning. I'll be at the end. I'm he
[1:10:03] that was, which is, and shall come, the
[1:10:05] Almighty. Think of it. That's what the
[1:10:08] trumpet said.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Be careful, John. You're entered into
[1:10:12] the spirit. Something's going to be
[1:10:14] revealed to you.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; What is it? A trumpet sound.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; The first thing, I'm Alpha and Omega.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; The first of all revelations.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, sinner, bow your head. Repent now
[1:10:29] before the time is too late. I'm alpha
[1:10:32] and omega. That's the first thing he let
[1:10:34] him know who he was. Who's this
[1:10:38] approaching? Is it King Jesus, King God,
[1:10:41] King Holy Ghost? He said, I'm all of it.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; I'm from A to Z. I'm the beginning
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; and the ending. I'm the immortal,
[1:10:50] eternal one. Just a little later, we
[1:10:53] watch him in a sevenfold personages.
[1:10:56] Drop down. All right. The first of all
[1:10:58] revelations is the supreme deity of
[1:11:00] Jesus Christ. You must know who he is
[1:11:08] when you hear his voice.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Do you know who he is when you hear his
[1:11:14] voice?
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:18] This revelation is essential.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Saints,
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; young people, brothers and sisters, this
[1:11:25] is essential.
[1:11:27] This
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; is where all of the nonsense that's
[1:11:31] going on today is people lack this
[1:11:33] revelation right here.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, that is true.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; They've taken parts of the message and
[1:11:38] made it optional material.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Or they've invalidated it
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; or they've eulogized it.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; They've made it they've rendered it with
[1:11:49] no power, no life, no validity at all.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; But this word is still alive, saints.
[1:11:56] And it's alive to those that know that
[1:11:59] it's been given to them as hidden food
[1:12:02] for the age that we live in.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; It's the secret things that belong that
[1:12:08] come from the Lord to his children.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; These are the precious moments, the
[1:12:14] precious secrets that he unfolds to the
[1:12:17] believer. Yes,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; it is essential that you and I have this
[1:12:21] relationship with the Lord where he's
[1:12:24] revealing himself to you personally.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; It is how he speaks to his children
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; from the little ones to the old ones.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And as long as you live here on this
[1:12:36] earth, you will be receiving these
[1:12:40] revelations from the almighty God.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And when he speaks to you, he'll come. I
[1:12:47] am Alpha. I am Omega.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; I am the first. I am the last.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I am he that was, but I'm alive forever
[1:12:56] more.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I am King God, King Theophony, King
[1:13:01] Lord, Savior. I am all of that.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; He reveals himself when he speaks to
[1:13:09] you.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; In this great revelation, and it's
[1:13:12] hidden. Amen. But it's food for us.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; This is why you're alive today, saints.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; If you're not alive, it's probably
[1:13:23] because what you're eating.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; If you're not alive, you need to eat
[1:13:27] something good so you can get alive.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Remember Elijah ate them cakes one time
[1:13:34] and he went into strength for 40 days
[1:13:36] and 40 nights.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; You talk about an energy bar.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; What was in them cakes? It was something
[1:13:43] supernatural. I can tell you that.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that there's nobody else
[1:13:47] that ate what he ate and could do what
[1:13:49] he did. And it was supernatural. And if
[1:13:52] you eat the bread of life for your day,
[1:13:56] it'll do and have the same effect upon
[1:13:58] you
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; supernaturally.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Going on strong with the Lord. Craziness
[1:14:06] coming on every side. Backsliders,
[1:14:09] liars, people manifesting himself. But
[1:14:12] the true believer is still moving on
[1:14:14] with the Lord, still rising, still
[1:14:17] shining, still praising,
[1:14:20] still worshiping.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; He's alive and well. Did we sing that
[1:14:26] one?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Live in me to tell that he's the same
[1:14:31] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; He is alive.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; He's alive and well.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; This is hidden food is the greatest of
[1:14:44] all revelations.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You'll know that this angel that came
[1:14:48] down in Revelations 18 is what's taking
[1:14:52] place in our day.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what this is about. That's
[1:14:56] what that's about.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; That's Genesis 18. That's before
[1:15:01] Calvary.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's before the New Testament.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; It's way back in the plains of memory.
[1:15:09] Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham meets these three men out on the
[1:15:13] desert and the men are talking to him
[1:15:16] about these precious promises
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; and Sarah's in the background listening
[1:15:22] and she hears something that was too
[1:15:24] much for her faith to catch a hold of.
[1:15:28] She didn't say it out loud. She said it
[1:15:30] like some of you, like all of us, we say
[1:15:33] little, we mumble little things.
[1:15:36] Mumble, grumble, mumble. And this maybe
[1:15:39] wasn't a mumble. Maybe it was just a
[1:15:40] question. Me have pleasure with my Lord.
[1:15:44] She laughed. She That's funny joke.
[1:15:47] That's funny. And the angel
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; that was She didn't say it in his face.
[1:15:55] She wasn't looking at him in face to
[1:15:56] face. She was in the tent behind the
[1:15:59] angel.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And the Lord is speaking to Abraham.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; You know that same Lord hears and knows
[1:16:06] every one of your thoughts, too. Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; He knows every one of your thoughts. And
[1:16:13] I want my thoughts to line up with what
[1:16:15] his program is.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; It's very hard for me to think of Sarah
[1:16:20] having a baby.
[1:16:23] And I can imagine her thinking, "This is
[1:16:25] impossible for me to have a baby." And
[1:16:28] just like any other promise that many of
[1:16:30] you are waiting for, it might be
[1:16:31] impossible for it to happen in your
[1:16:33] life. But whatever the promise is, if
[1:16:36] God said it, I want my faith to get in
[1:16:40] the will of whatever his will is
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; and not look at how hard it could be,
[1:16:47] how difficult the circumstance.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; God said it.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Don't laugh at it. God said it.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Is there anything too hard for the Lord?
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Is it too late? He can't fix your
[1:17:00] problem.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Is he run out of time? He can't take
[1:17:04] care of your issues.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; There's nothing too hard for the Lord.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, the prophet moves forward here.
[1:17:18] Just have a couple pages of quotes. I
[1:17:19] won't read all, but I'll just lay this
[1:17:22] in here. This hidden food. This is
[1:17:25] hidden.
[1:17:27] Like I said this morning, it's not
[1:17:30] everything that is said, it's things
[1:17:32] that are not said. It's things that are
[1:17:34] implied.
[1:17:35] Like in the news, you go and listen to
[1:17:37] the news, it's not just what they're
[1:17:39] saying, it's what they're not saying.
[1:17:41] They don't give you the full story.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Five:00 news is only giving you the part
[1:17:46] that they want to give you. That's not
[1:17:48] what's going on in the streets. That's
[1:17:51] not what's going on in every household,
[1:17:52] in every neighborhood. Are we serious?
[1:17:55] There's things going on right now that
[1:17:57] the news never covers.
[1:18:00] If all you feed on is the news, you're
[1:18:03] getting partial part of the story.
[1:18:06] You're not getting the full story.
[1:18:08] But this right here gives you the entire
[1:18:10] story.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; You're not missing anything when you're
[1:18:14] in line with what's going on here. All
[1:18:17] the prophetic utterances and where we
[1:18:19] are today.
[1:18:22] And so this is hidden food. There's many
[1:18:26] of them. I'm just going to touch on this
[1:18:28] one just for a moment. The Lord will
[1:18:30] help me. This
[1:18:33] is in the message the unveiling of God.
[1:18:38] 1964 paragraph 22. Now my subject this
[1:18:41] morning, I trust that God will reveal
[1:18:43] this. And each time if you who take the
[1:18:46] tapes and listen, I hope and trust that
[1:18:48] you have had spiritual understanding of
[1:18:52] what that God God has been trying to get
[1:18:57] over to the church without saying it
[1:19:01] right out.
[1:19:03] See, it's a thing. Sometimes we have to
[1:19:06] say things in such a way that it might
[1:19:09] thin down. Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out, some to
[1:19:13] leave, and some to ponder over.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; But that's done purposely.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; It must be done that way.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Then it might be that some would say,
[1:19:21] "You mean God would purposely do a thing
[1:19:24] like that?" He certainly did.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; He does. Yet.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, Lord, just say it right
[1:19:30] out. Just say it.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Say it right out." He doesn't say things
[1:19:34] right out.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; He has to leave the element of the
[1:19:37] revelation has to strike you. Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; This is where your prayer life comes in.
[1:19:42] Because if everything is said right out,
[1:19:44] then you can just on the educational
[1:19:46] side just read and read and read and
[1:19:47] read and think you have it. It's more to
[1:19:49] it than just reading.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; What about the saints that can't read?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; So it has to be uh of course read. You
[1:19:57] have to hear it spoken the words of
[1:20:00] life. But then there has to be the
[1:20:01] element of a revelation that it strikes
[1:20:04] to you. Oh, that's what he's saying.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's talking about himself or he's
[1:20:12] talking about me.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; He's there describing this bride and
[1:20:18] describing this elect lady and you'll
[1:20:21] listen. You'll listen. You think it's
[1:20:23] that one is all these people. But it's
[1:20:25] so nice when you realize that he's
[1:20:26] actually talking about you
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; and he's talking to you.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; All these tapes were just for you.
[1:20:38] Can you receive that tonight? Look at
[1:20:39] your neighbor and tell them,
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; look at your neighbor. Tell them,
[1:20:42] "Neighbor,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; all of the message
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; is just for you."
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; They got your name on it.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, tell them. Look at him. Tell
[1:20:54] them
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; the Bible
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; is just for you.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; That's the Thank you. Give the Lord hand
[1:21:08] of praise. Thank you. Yes.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, I didn't like them
[1:21:18] look at your neighbor preachers.
[1:21:21] I hated those. And I'm one now today.
[1:21:24] Look at your neighbor. Touch your
[1:21:25] neighbor three time. This is get on my
[1:21:27] nerves. But I see why we need to do
[1:21:30] that.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; All right. So
[1:21:35] the Bible is for you. messages for you.
[1:21:37] Here what the prophet of God says here.
[1:21:40] He said one day when he had thousands
[1:21:42] around him, he said, "Except you eat my
[1:21:44] flesh of the son of God or son of man
[1:21:47] and drink his blood, you have no life in
[1:21:49] you." What kind of a statement do you
[1:21:51] think that a medical doctor or nurse or
[1:21:54] any fine intellectual person would think
[1:21:56] of a statement like that? For a man that
[1:21:59] had a ministry like he had, why would he
[1:22:01] say eat the flesh? That's cannibal. to
[1:22:04] drink human blood. It's a vampire. In
[1:22:06] other words, he wants us to be cannibals
[1:22:08] and vampires. And the whole audience
[1:22:10] walked away from him. And there was a
[1:22:13] ministerial social with him of 70 that
[1:22:17] had been chosen. And he turned to them.
[1:22:19] He says, "What will you think when you
[1:22:21] see the son of man ascending from where
[1:22:23] he come from?" Now, he didn't explain
[1:22:26] that. He never explained how. Paul did
[1:22:30] that later on. He just said it. See, and
[1:22:34] then when this he said, "What will you
[1:22:36] say to these ministers when you see the
[1:22:39] Son of Man ascending from where he come
[1:22:40] from?" No doubt them men said, "Now just
[1:22:43] a moment. Oh, we eat with him. We fish
[1:22:45] with him. We sleep with him. We know
[1:22:48] where he was born. We seen the cradle
[1:22:50] that he was rocked in. How does this
[1:22:52] man, this is a hard saying,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says they didn't walk with
[1:22:58] him anymore. They left him. Then he left
[1:23:02] the 12. He had chosen 12 and one of them
[1:23:04] was the devil. He says, "So he turned to
[1:23:06] them and there's no one could explain
[1:23:09] what he had just said. How are they
[1:23:11] going to eat his flesh and drink his
[1:23:13] blood? How did he come down when he was
[1:23:16] born right here on earth?" See, they
[1:23:19] couldn't understand it. And then he
[1:23:21] turned to the apostles and he says, "Do
[1:23:23] you want to go also?" And then that's
[1:23:26] when Apostle Peter made that great
[1:23:28] statement. Lord, to whom would we go?
[1:23:32] How many's in that position there?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; How many's at that spot in life?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Some people have a plan B.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Some people have a second or secondary
[1:23:43] plan if this don't work.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I am not one of those people. I If this
[1:23:48] doesn't work, I'm done. I'm lost.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; This is the only plan I have
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; of getting out of here is the word of
[1:23:56] the Lord and this message. It has been
[1:23:59] revealed to me
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; more great, more deep than my mother
[1:24:04] being the lovely Geraldine Poe. My
[1:24:07] mother is Geraldine Poe. I know that was
[1:24:09] my mama and my daddy Jordan Poe. My
[1:24:11] lovely parents, my family members. I
[1:24:13] love them. I know them. I thank God for
[1:24:15] them. And this has been revealed to me
[1:24:19] as much as me knowing who my mom and dad
[1:24:22] is naturally.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; I know who my mother and father is
[1:24:26] spiritually.
[1:24:28] I know where I belong.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; This is crazy talk, but it's been
[1:24:32] revealed to me.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Like Simeon,
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; he got up one morning and the Holy Ghost
[1:24:39] told him, "Go and find that child.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; I revealed it to you by the spirit. It's
[1:24:46] not going to be in the news. Your
[1:24:48] friends are not going to be able to
[1:24:49] update you on what to do next. It's a
[1:24:52] revelation
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; and the entire church is built upon it.
[1:24:57] You have to have that. Is that right,
[1:24:59] saints?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hey, they misunderstood him. Eat my
[1:25:03] flesh and drink my blood. They left him.
[1:25:07] There's no one can explain what he just
[1:25:09] said. How are they going to eat his
[1:25:11] flesh and drink his blood? How did he
[1:25:13] come down when he was born right here on
[1:25:15] the earth?
[1:25:17] And that's when paragraph 30, the
[1:25:19] Apostle Peter made that great statement,
[1:25:21] Lord, to whom would we go? See we
[1:25:27] for we are satisfied.
[1:25:30] We know surely that you and you alone
[1:25:34] have the word of life.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Of this hour
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; we are satisfied of that. See they could
[1:25:41] not explain it.
[1:25:44] You can't explain faith.
[1:25:47] is something that you believe
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; and it's so solid that there is nothing
[1:25:53] else will take its place.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Therefore, they know that that word that
[1:25:58] was written for that age that they were
[1:26:00] living in the Messiah age that he fit
[1:26:03] that place exactly. And what could they
[1:26:06] do? Go back in what could they do to go
[1:26:09] back in them cold formal churches that
[1:26:11] they had come out of? Said where would
[1:26:13] they go to? See, we are fully persuaded
[1:26:16] that you have the word of life.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't explain it, but they
[1:26:21] believed it. See,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said that to weed down his
[1:26:27] crowd. See,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; has the crowd been weeded down?
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Has it been thinning down?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's done on purpose.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Some more need to leave, too.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go on and leave. Let them go.
[1:26:41] See, till he could get that group
[1:26:44] together and out of all those people
[1:26:47] that only 11 of them then understood
[1:26:50] actually who he was.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; They know that he was God and God alone.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 284 knows now Moses were the
[1:27:02] word was the word that day because the
[1:27:05] word was given to him for that day.
[1:27:07] Moses, Joseph was the word in his day
[1:27:10] portraying Christ. Exactly. See, each
[1:27:13] one of them was the word. And when Jesus
[1:27:16] came, he was the word in its fullness
[1:27:18] because the whole plan of redemption
[1:27:20] laid in him.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; How many believe the word
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; come down again in our day?
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And was revealed in the ministry of a
[1:27:30] son of man.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And it is a revelation. It's hidden
[1:27:34] food.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you get that revelation,
[1:27:37] you don't have no problems with the
[1:27:38] statements
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; or the visions
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; or the hard sayings.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; You just make it work.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Even if it don't work, you just stay
[1:27:47] right with it.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; You got to close your mouth sometime.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; You can't There's no answer to
[1:27:52] everything.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; You can't, you know, you just you got to
[1:27:54] look dumb.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; You just don't know.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; You just walk away and say, "Well,
[1:28:00] that's what he said." and keep on moving
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; because they're going to prove to you
[1:28:03] one way or the other through their
[1:28:05] scientific achievement that everything
[1:28:07] we're doing is wrong.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; They'll continue to prove they prove
[1:28:11] that Noah was wrong
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; until he wasn't.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; They proved that he was wrong. They
[1:28:18] proved it scientifically. There's no
[1:28:21] rain up there until one day there was
[1:28:24] rain up there.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And this is how God always does it. He
[1:28:28] lets the critics grow and they grow.
[1:28:30] First he vindicates a man. Then he lets
[1:28:33] the critics grow and grow around it. No
[1:28:36] answer to them. And let them grow. Let
[1:28:38] them grow. Then there's a showdown. And
[1:28:41] the God that answers by fire. He is God.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And we're coming to another showdown,
[1:28:48] saints.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; I'm on the Lord's side.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'm on the Lord's side.
[1:28:57] I'm not an explainer as the Reverend
[1:29:00] Brother Muse would say.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; We're not explainers.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; We're believers.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the word of the Lord?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. It's hidden food
[1:29:12] in due season. May the Lord bless you
[1:29:14] richly with just that little portion of
[1:29:17] the word.
[1:29:19] I
[1:29:21] I'm going to close here. Okay, let us
[1:29:23] pray. Musicians come please.
[1:29:27] Thank you Lord for your word tonight
[1:29:30] as we just wanted to bring this Genesis
[1:29:33] 18 out to the people. How the prophet
[1:29:36] brought it out to us
[1:29:38] that Sarah was in the tent behind this
[1:29:42] conversation.
[1:29:44] A detail we never caught in the
[1:29:45] organization denomination,
[1:29:48] but the ministry in the last last day
[1:29:50] pulled it out of the scripture and
[1:29:53] showed that she was in the tent behind
[1:29:55] the angel. And yet he caught her thought
[1:29:59] and that same angel has come down again
[1:30:03] in our generation.
[1:30:05] It is the same pillar of fire that
[1:30:08] knocked Paul off of his horse one day
[1:30:11] and revealed
[1:30:14] who Christ was.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; It is the same angel, the same pillar of
[1:30:18] fire that wants to reveal himself to
[1:30:21] every individual here tonight.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Even the young ones,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; a personal revelation
[1:30:28] of who Jesus Christ is. Lord, open that
[1:30:32] up to us is our prayer. For it's upon
[1:30:35] this rock you build your church. It's
[1:30:38] the entire revelation of the Bible is
[1:30:41] built upon revelation.
[1:30:44] The entire words of truth is through
[1:30:46] revelation Lord. And I pray oh God that
[1:30:50] you would grant that to us in this time
[1:30:53] and its season. We pray in Jesus name.
[1:30:58] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Brother John,
[1:31:02] would you come and please take the
[1:31:04] service? Amen.

[1:32:41] prayer.
[1:32:43] He's so good
[1:32:46] to
[1:32:48] me.
[1:32:52] Let's go to the key of E flat.
[1:32:57] I have a maker
[1:33:04] before
[1:33:05] my heart.
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:11] Before
[1:33:12] even time began,
[1:33:16] my life was in his hands.
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:25] He knows my name.
[1:33:33] He knows my every thought.
[1:33:40] He sees each tear that falls
[1:33:46] and he hears me when
[1:33:50] I call.
[1:33:52] I have a father.
[1:33:55] I have a father.
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:03] He calls me his own.
[1:34:10] He'll never
[1:34:13] leave
[1:34:15] me
[1:34:16] no matter where I go.
[1:34:25] He knows my name.
[1:34:33] He knows my every thought.
[1:34:40] He sees
[1:34:42] each tears that fall
[1:34:46] and he hears me when I call. Yes, he
[1:34:51] knows my name.
[1:34:55] Oh, he knows my name.
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:03] He knows my every thought.
[1:35:10] He sees
[1:35:12] each tear that fall.
[1:35:16] And he hears me when I call.
[1:35:23] Yes, he hears me when
[1:35:27] I call.
[1:35:32] Well, he's everything.
[1:35:36] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[1:35:42] He's everything to me. Well, he's my
[1:35:46] father, my mother. He's my sister and my
[1:35:50] brother. He's everything
[1:35:54] to me.
[1:35:57] Yes, he's everything.

[1:36:11] and my mother. He's my sister, my
[1:36:15] brother. Yes, he's everything
[1:36:19] to me. Sing it one more time. Yes, Lord.
[1:36:23] You're everything.
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:26] You're everything to me. Lord, you're
[1:36:29] everything.
[1:36:32] You're everything to me. You're my
[1:36:36] father. You're my mother. You're my
[1:36:39] sister. You're my brother. You are
[1:36:42] everything.
[1:36:44] Stand as we tell him that one more time.
[1:36:47] Lord, you are everything.
[1:36:51] You're everything to me. You're
[1:36:55] everything.
[1:36:57] You're everything to me. You're my
[1:37:01] father. You're my mother, my sister, my
[1:37:06] brother. You're everything
[1:37:10] to me.
[1:37:13] Oh, alas. And did my Savior
[1:37:18] bleed? And did my sovereign die?
[1:37:25] Would he devote that sacred
[1:37:30] head for such a world as I
[1:37:37] Oh, and the cross at the cross where I
[1:37:41] first saw the light and the burden of my
[1:37:46] heart rolled away.
[1:37:49] It was in by faith that I received my
[1:37:54] sight. And now I'm happy all the day.
[1:38:02] Was it for crime that I have done
[1:38:10] upon the tree?
[1:38:14] It's amazing
[1:38:16] pity
[1:38:18] grace unknown and love beyond
[1:38:23] the degree.
[1:38:26] Oh, at the cross at the cross where I
[1:38:30] first saw a light and the burden of my
[1:38:35] heart fall away.
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:39] was there by me. I received my side. And
[1:38:45] now
[1:38:48] let's sing that fourth verse. But drops
[1:38:49] of green canary pay. But drops of green
[1:38:55] canary.
[1:38:57] The debt of love I own.
