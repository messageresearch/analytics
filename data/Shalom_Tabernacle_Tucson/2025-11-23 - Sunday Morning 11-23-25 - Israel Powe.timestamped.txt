[0:00] When had come, it would be a everlasting
[0:03] eternal rest.
[0:06] &gt;&gt; God made the world. Hebrews the 4th
[0:08] chapter, God made the world and rested
[0:10] on the seven days. That's right. They
[0:14] come back around. He give that to the
[0:15] Jews for a covenant for a certain amount
[0:18] of time. That's right. But they go and
[0:20] rest one day, go back to first day of
[0:23] the week, start over again. New start
[0:25] over. That ain't the rest that God spoke
[0:27] of when God made the world in six days.
[0:29] when he went to rest, he rested from
[0:31] then on.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. That settled it. He didn't
[0:35] come back on the eighth day and start
[0:36] again. It was only a shadow. Now, that
[0:40] was a type like the moon to the sun. But
[0:43] when the sun comes up, we don't need the
[0:45] moon no more. Now, notice this. Oh, in
[0:49] Revelations 11, the woman with the moon
[0:51] under her feet and the sun at her head.
[0:53] Oh, we could go through the Bibles and
[0:55] lead to lead and show you. See? But what
[0:58] is it? When the Bible said in Hebrews
[1:01] the 4th chapter, if Jesus would have
[1:03] given them a rest day, he would have
[1:05] afterwards spoke of it. He would have
[1:07] spoke of a rest day. What day did he
[1:09] speak about a rest? Come unto me all ye
[1:13] that labor and are heavy laden and I
[1:16] will give you rest.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; Matthew the 11th chapter 22nd verse.
[1:21] Look, then we find that when we come to
[1:24] him, for he said Hebrews 4 that has
[1:28] entered into Jesus rest has ceased from
[1:31] his worldly works as God did from his
[1:34] when he made the world to never return
[1:36] to it again. How long? HOW LONG ARE YOU
[1:39] SEALED BY the Holy Ghost? Until the day
[1:42] of your redemption.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; There's that rest.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. comfort, advocate,
[1:49] &gt;&gt; seal, deliver.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; I get kind of excited.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; I get kind of blessed.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, is it promised for us, Brother
[2:02] Brand? Is it proven by the Bible? All
[2:04] right, let's go to Joel.
[2:06] Find out what Joel said about it.
[2:12] How thankful I am for the blessed word
[2:14] of God. Do you love it?
[2:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; I think there if it wasn't for the word,
[2:20] I don't know where we'd stand. All
[2:22] right, we're Joel now. We're going to
[2:25] Joel, the second chapter of Joel,
[2:30] and we're going to start at the 28th
[2:33] verse.
[2:36] Joel 2:28,
[2:38] 800 years before the coming of Christ,
[2:43] the prophet in the spirit. Now listen.
[2:45] And it shall come to pass afterwards
[2:48] that I will pour out my spirit upon all
[2:51] flesh. Your sons and your daughters
[2:54] shall prophesy.
[2:56] Your old man shall dream dreams. And
[2:58] your young man shall see visions.
[3:01] And also upon my servants, and upon my
[3:04] hands made will I pour out in these
[3:06] days.
[3:08] pour out in those days
[3:12] my spirit and I will show wonders in the
[3:14] heavens above and in the earth blood
[3:17] fire and pillars of smoke. The sun shall
[3:21] be turned into darkness and the moon
[3:22] into blood before the great and terrible
[3:25] day of the Lord shall come and it shall
[3:26] come to pass that whosoever shall call
[3:29] upon the name of the Lord shall be
[3:31] delivered.
[3:35] What
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Joel? Did you notice in Acts two, Peter
[3:40] tuck up the same verse, said, "Ye man of
[3:43] Israel, hear my words. These are not
[3:45] drunk. The sealed comforting,
[3:50] &gt;&gt; peculiar,
[3:52] marked
[3:54] people.
[3:56] They are not drunk as you suppose." Acts
[4:00] two, seeing that this is the third hour
[4:03] of the day, but this is that which is
[4:06] spoke of by Joel the prophet, saying, it
[4:09] shall come to pass in the last days that
[4:10] I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[4:14] What is it?
[4:16] What is the Holy Ghost?
[4:18] All right.
[4:21] Now, let's notice again
[4:24] promise to the believers. That's what it
[4:26] is. Now, this Holy Ghost, we find out
[4:28] what it is. Just a minute. Who is it
[4:30] promise to to believers? Now let's go to
[4:32] Luke 24 chapter of Luke. Listen what
[4:36] Jesus said in his last words before he
[4:38] left the earth.
[4:40] Luke the 24th chapter.
[4:44] And you just taking this down now. You
[4:46] can mark it down and study it tomorrow
[4:47] when you have more time.
[4:54] Now Luke 24:49. Listen to Jesus speaking
[4:58] at the end when he was ascending up into
[5:01] glory, the ascension. Here's the words
[5:04] he said to his disciples.
[5:06] Behold, I send the promise of my father.
[5:09] What promise?
[5:12] The seal,
[5:15] the son,
[5:17] the comforter, and all these things that
[5:21] I've spoke of times thousands more. I
[5:25] send the promise of my father upon you.
[5:28] What promise? The one that Isaiah said
[5:30] would come with stammer lips and other
[5:33] tongues. I speak to this people. I'll
[5:34] send that rest upon you.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; I'll send what Joel spoke of that it
[5:40] shall come to pass the last day, sayaith
[5:42] God, I'll pour out my spirit upon you.
[5:44] Or I'll send to you and make all
[5:46] nations, all people beginning from
[5:48] Jerusalem. I'll bring in the seed of
[5:50] Abraham under this covenant. I'll seal
[5:53] away every one of them. See, I'll pour
[5:56] out my spirit. I'll send the promise of
[5:58] my father upon you. But carry ye means
[6:02] wait in the city of Jerusalem until
[6:06] you're endued with power from on high.
[6:10] What is the Holy Ghost saying? Power
[6:15] &gt;&gt; from on high.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Not power from the bishop.
[6:22] Not power from the church,
[6:25] but power from on high.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; How did that power come? By joining
[6:30] church, I challenge you to say that
[6:33] that's right. By joining the church,
[6:36] shaking hands with a preacher. No sir.
[6:40] Now, do you Catholic sticking out your
[6:42] tongue and taking the first communion?
[6:43] No sir.
[6:45] How did it come? Power of Mona.
[6:50] Let's read a little farther.
[6:52] Let's go to Acts 1 8. They're assembling
[6:57] together now. Now, they were speaking of
[7:00] Jesus here when they were assembled
[7:01] together and had ordained another to
[7:04] take the
[7:06] Judas's place. Acts 1:8, but ye shall
[7:10] receive power after this, the Holy Ghost
[7:13] has come upon you. What? You become the
[7:16] member of the Brandon Tabernet. No, you
[7:19] become the member of the Methodist
[7:20] church, the Catholic church, the
[7:21] Presbyterian. Not so in the Bible.
[7:24] That's man-made doctrine. But you shall
[7:26] receive power after you have become a
[7:29] preacher. No sir.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; You shall receive power after you get
[7:32] your bachelor of art. No sir. You shall
[7:34] reccome power after you get your DD. No
[7:37] sir. You shall receive power after
[7:39] you're baptized in water. No sir. You
[7:42] shall receive power after you have taken
[7:44] the first communion. No sir. See, that's
[7:46] all man-made stuff. Listen
[7:49] what the Bible said, what Jesus said. Ye
[7:52] shall receive power after that the Holy
[7:55] Ghost has come upon you.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost of power?
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Then after this you shall be witnesses
[8:04] just you 12.
[8:07] You witness at Jerusalem. You shall be
[8:09] witnesses to me both in Jerusalem,
[8:13] Judea, Samir, and to the utmost parts of
[8:17] the earth,
[8:18] &gt;&gt; which has never been reached yet.
[8:22] And when he spoken these things, when he
[8:25] spoken these things, while they beheld
[8:26] him, he was taken up in the cloud and
[8:28] received out of their sight. Now turn
[8:32] right across the page. Watch these
[8:35] prophecies come to pass. And when the
[8:38] day of Pentecost had fully come, they
[8:40] were in one, they were all with one
[8:43] accord in one place. And all of a
[8:46] sudden, the pastor came in. And I got
[8:48] off the line there, didn't I? All of a
[8:51] sudden, the priest come on the altar.
[8:56] And suddenly there came a sound.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Not just a make believe. It was there.
[9:04] Amen.
[9:06] &gt;&gt; A sound.
[9:09] A minister was approaching the door. The
[9:12] priest had the communion coming out of
[9:13] the holy place. No, never mind. There
[9:16] came a sound from heaven.
[9:21] Not the rustling of a feet. There came a
[9:23] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[9:26] wind.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[9:34] Praise the Lord.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; And it filled all the house where they
[9:38] were saved.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? Here's where
[9:45] they get power. Here's where they
[9:46] supposed to wait. Here's what happened
[9:48] when they did it. All prophesied from
[9:50] Genesis right on up from Abraham right
[9:53] on through. It would come and how it
[9:54] would come and the results would come.
[9:56] What is it? Promise to the church, to
[9:59] believers.
[10:02] and filled all the house where there was
[10:03] set. And there appeared unto them cloven
[10:07] tongues like a fire and it set upon each
[10:09] of them. And they were all filled with
[10:11] the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with
[10:13] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[10:15] utterance.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to get on that Friday
[10:18] night. We leave that right there.
[10:22] How is it? It's a promise to the church.
[10:25] Absolutely a promise.
[10:28] All right. Now,
[10:31] now we go to find out after they were
[10:33] filled, they were sealed until how long?
[10:38] How many of yours got the Holy Ghost? I
[10:40] see your hand.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; There's more with the Holy Ghost than it
[10:44] is without
[10:46] you to be one of us, brother, sister.
[10:48] When you understand what it is, it's it
[10:51] is the spirit of God dwelling in you to
[10:53] do the works of God. When God ever sent
[10:56] any of his spirit into any of his
[10:58] servants, any of his prophets, any of
[11:00] his teachers, any of his apostles, they
[11:02] were always rejected of the world.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; They were considered crazy in every age
[11:07] there was.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; Even when Paul stood before Griffith, he
[11:11] said, "In the way that's called heresy,"
[11:14] what is heresy? Crazy.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; In the way that they call crazy a bunch
[11:18] of nuts, that's the way I worship the
[11:21] God of our father.
[11:23] That's right.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[11:27] them.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm so glad I can say I'm
[11:31] one of them. Now, after this Holy Ghost
[11:34] fell upon them, it made them so much
[11:36] sweethearts until everything was in
[11:38] common. Is that right?
[11:40] &gt;&gt; My my, what a fellowship. We sing that
[11:43] song time. Oh, what fellowship. Oh, what
[11:49] joy divine. That's it.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They didn't care. They
[11:53] didn't care whether the the sun shined
[11:56] or didn't. They didn't ask for a flower
[11:59] bed of bees. Now I'll receive the Holy
[12:01] Ghost, says some people to me, Mr.
[12:03] Brandham, if you will guarantee me that
[12:05] I'll be a millionaire.
[12:08] If you'll guarantee me, I'll find or
[12:10] wells and if I'll uh find gold mines and
[12:13] I I see people teach that and they teach
[12:16] a lie.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; God has not promised those things.
[12:22] A man that ever receives the Holy Ghost
[12:24] don't care whether he begs for bread or
[12:26] not.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Doesn't make any difference to him.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; He's a heavenbound creature. He don't
[12:31] care. He's got no power here at all.
[12:34] Right? He don't care. Let come let go
[12:37] what may let him criticize, make fun,
[12:39] lose your precious. Why do you care?
[12:43] &gt;&gt; You're on your road to glory.
[12:44] Hallelujah. Your eyes are set on Christ
[12:47] and you're on your road.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; You don't care what the world says.
[12:51] That's what the Holy Ghost is. It's a
[12:53] power. It's a seal. It's a comforter.
[12:56] It's an advocate. It's a sign. Oh my.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; It's the assurance
[13:02] that God has received you. How much time
[13:06] have I take? I've got just eight more
[13:08] minutes. All right. Let me I got a lot
[13:10] of scriptures here. I don't guess I can
[13:11] get them in, but we we'll try our best.
[13:14] Now, after a man has been filled with
[13:16] the Holy Ghost, is it possible that
[13:19] persecutions and things would cause him
[13:22] to have to come back? And now, he ain't
[13:25] going to lose. He's still a son of God.
[13:27] He'll always be
[13:29] because you're sealed how long?
[13:33] That's right. That's what the Bible
[13:34] says.
[13:59] Heat. Heat.
[14:45] Heat. Heat.
[14:49] Here
[15:03] you are.
[16:03] Heat. Heat.
[16:24] Heat. Heat.
[17:09] Heat. Heat.
[18:53] Hallelujah.
[18:56] Hallelujah.
[19:06] Heat.
[19:18] Heat.
[19:42] Hallelujah.
[20:20] Hallelujah.
[20:47] Heat. Heat.
[21:00] Deep.
[21:45] Thank you.
[22:07] Happy
[22:33] I give you all the praise.
[22:37] I want to say thanks.
[22:40] Thanks.
[22:42] I give you thanks
[22:45] for all
[22:48] you have done.
[22:53] I am so blessed.
[22:56] My soul is found rest.
[23:00] Oh,
[23:02] I give you thanks. Let's tell him one
[23:05] more time. I want to say thanks. Let's
[23:08] stand together as we worship him. I give
[23:12] you thanks
[23:14] for all
[23:16] that you have done.
[23:22] I am so blessed.
[23:25] My soul is found rest.
[23:28] Oh Lord,
[23:31] I give you thanks.
[23:36] Thank you, Lord, for the strength you
[23:38] give to simply carry on through life's
[23:43] toils and tests, the worst and best. You
[23:47] never leave me alone.
[23:50] You always ride beside me.
[23:55] when I pray. Since I first began, you've
[23:59] been my dearest friend. I give you all
[24:02] the praise.
[24:05] I want to say thanks.
[24:08] Thanks.
[24:10] I give you thanks
[24:13] for all
[24:15] that you done.
[24:20] Oh, I am so blessed.
[24:24] My soul has found past. Oh Lord,
[24:29] I give you thanks and I give you thanks
[24:32] for this moment. Lord, I give you thanks
[24:36] for this moment. I will continually
[24:41] for each day I live your praise to give.
[24:45] Oh, I'm blessed upon
[24:50] the moment when in my life you made such
[24:54] a change. And since your spirit came,
[24:58] I've not been the same. I just want to
[25:01] give you praise.
[25:04] I'm going to say thanks.
[25:08] Thanks. I give you thanks
[25:12] for all
[25:15] for all you've done.
[25:18] Oh, I'm so blessed. I am so blessed.
[25:22] Lord, my soul has found my soul.
[25:28] I give and even in the bad times.
[25:30] Brother will you come up with our
[25:32] service? Yes. Even in the bad times,
[25:37] when everything's going wrong,
[25:41] even on the mountain, his loving
[25:45] presence makes me strong.
[25:48] Each and every moment,
[25:52] each and every day, I'm going to sing
[25:55] and shout. Won't let the rocks cry out,
[25:59] give you all the praise.
[26:03] I'm going to say thanks.
[26:06] Thanks.
[26:08] I give you thanks
[26:11] for all
[26:13] for all you've done.
[26:18] Oh, I am so blessed.
[26:21] My soul is found.
[26:27] I give you thanks.
[26:34] Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; So grateful, so thankful.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Let's all just bow our heads.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we are so privileged this
[26:43] morning to come into your presence,
[26:45] Lord. And Lord, we just ask that you
[26:47] would have your will in your way in
[26:50] every part of our lives. Lord, we just
[26:52] ask, Lord, that this word would come and
[26:55] just manifest itself through us in a
[26:57] greater way. Lord, we're so grateful for
[27:00] your grace and your mercy in our lives.
[27:02] Lord, we're so grateful for the blood of
[27:04] Jesus Christ. We're so grateful, Lord,
[27:06] that you've presented us, Lord, to
[27:08] yourself as the bride, Lord. Oh, we're
[27:11] so grateful, Lord, that you condescended
[27:14] and came down, the great creator, became
[27:17] my savior, Lord, and then stepped in
[27:20] behind this veil. We're so thankful for
[27:23] this hour, Lord, for the word of God
[27:24] that's being made manifest in these
[27:26] closing moments of time. Lord, just give
[27:29] us strength, Lord. Give us, Lord, what
[27:32] we have need of this morning.
[27:34] Lord, we think of a a fighter and a
[27:36] boxer and, Lord, the training and the
[27:39] exactness of the Holy Ghost, how it's
[27:41] teaching us, Lord, as David said, to to
[27:44] teach our fingers to fight. Lord, our
[27:46] our hands to make war. Lord, help us in
[27:49] this hour. We didn't pick this fight,
[27:51] Lord, but we're sure in it. And oh God,
[27:54] we think of a little kid, Lord, in on
[27:56] the schoolyard back in the day, Lord,
[27:58] and the first thing we recognized is all
[28:01] we could do is maybe windmill it, Lord,
[28:03] and just start swinging, Lord. But then
[28:06] now we're coming into a time, Lord, the
[28:08] bride of Jesus Christ, where you're
[28:10] actually teaching exactly what to do,
[28:12] distance and range, when to move
[28:14] forward, when to move back. Lord, just
[28:16] how to walk, just how to step. Lord,
[28:19] help us, Father, to just be completely
[28:22] under your control. Lord, we give you
[28:25] our lives, Lord. We offer this service,
[28:27] Lord. We offer our sacrifices of praise
[28:30] to you. Be in every part, Lord. The
[28:32] music, Lord, the preaching, Lord, the
[28:35] worship. Lord, give us ears to hear and
[28:38] a heart to understand. Lord, help us,
[28:40] Father, to be able to take all of the
[28:43] word of God, Lord, to receive the whole
[28:44] message, Lord, in this hour. Help us,
[28:48] Father. We commit it into your hands and
[28:50] we're just so grateful and we want to
[28:52] give you all the praise and the thanks
[28:54] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[28:57] Amen.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just turn around, shake
[29:03] hands with those that are around you
[29:04] this morning. So good to be here and
[29:07] just what a lovely atmosphere we have.
[29:16] And you can be seated if you like. We'll
[29:17] stay in the key of F if that's what
[29:18] we're in.
[29:22] Well, hallelujah. What a thought. Jesus
[29:25] full salvation brought victory.

[34:46] &gt;&gt; I was shackled
[34:49] by a heavy
[34:53] burden.
[34:55] How many can say that was your
[34:57] testimony? Beneath
[34:59] a load of guilt
[35:03] and shame. Oh, but isn't it wonderful to
[35:05] be free of that this morning? For you

[37:52] special for us this morning. Brother
[37:53] Jonathan, if you could come and sing for
[37:54] us at this time. And

[38:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you brothers and sisters.
[38:26] Um,
[38:28] I thank the Lord this morning.
[38:31] I am still wearing the pin for the
[38:36] the
[38:37] anniversary which the brother gave me
[38:40] because I'm still in that spirit.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; 36 years ago,
[38:48] I came to the message.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] and I was 20.
[38:54] And I started reading about Tucson.
[38:58] I started reading about George Smith.
[39:02] I started reading about
[39:05] um Sunset Mountain,
[39:09] Sabino Canyon.
[39:12] I'm reading
[39:13] I started reading about Tucson
[39:15] Tabernacle
[39:17] Green. Pastor Green
[39:20] 36 years ago
[39:23] listening to the voice, reading the
[39:25] books and the testimonies.
[39:28] Then one day
[39:31] I find myself in Tucson.
[39:35] You can imagine the feeling, right?
[39:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know because you have not
[39:39] experienced it, but I'm telling you the
[39:43] experience is no longer the same.
[39:47] and my faith has no longer been the
[39:49] same.
[39:51] I want to appreciate this brother
[39:55] &gt;&gt; and my friend,
[39:57] brother Israel for the way that the Lord
[40:02] has always laid him, guided him. that
[40:07] today under this ministry
[40:11] the message that the prophet says I have
[40:14] heard now I see
[40:18] &gt;&gt; right here
[40:21] &gt;&gt; for the first time I met brother George
[40:24] Smith
[40:26] and I shook hands with him
[40:30] &gt;&gt; and I took a picture
[40:32] and I sent it home
[40:36] and then My phone was flooded with
[40:38] messages.
[40:40] Brother Jonathan, is that brother Joe
[40:42] Smith? I said amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; So I have a congregation on social
[40:49] media.
[40:52] So
[40:55] I appreciate this brother.
[40:59] I appreciate this brother.
[41:02] I appreciate this brother. We need to
[41:04] say these things that he can hear them
[41:08] when he's alive.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; I want brother Paul, Paul Rais, wherever
[41:13] you are,
[41:15] I appreciate you
[41:17] &gt;&gt; and my faith when I sit in that corner,
[41:21] my faith is at peace.
[41:24] And um thank you, brother John. Thank
[41:27] you for everything that has happened.
[41:29] And I'm still in the inspiration of that
[41:32] meeting because it really blessed me. I
[41:34] saw pastor
[41:36] uh Ron Peterson.
[41:39] I heard brother Isaiah Brooks 36 years
[41:43] ago. I started hearing the singing of
[41:46] that brother. I took a picture. I sent
[41:48] it home. Brother Jonathan is that
[41:50] brother Isaiah Brooks. I said amen.
[41:55] So you can see that I want to sing the
[41:57] song I pledge allegiance.
[42:00] It has been on my mind for some weeks
[42:02] now and um it's a congregation song. You
[42:06] can join me.
[42:08] I pledge
[42:12] allegiance
[42:14] to
[42:15] the lamb
[42:18] with all my strength
[42:22] with all
[42:24] I am.
[42:26] How seek
[42:29] to honor
[42:31] his
[42:33] command.
[42:35] I pledge
[42:37] allegiance
[42:40] to
[42:43] the land.
[42:48] Howard,
[42:50] how Christians
[42:52] long
[42:54] ago
[42:56] they were brought
[42:58] before
[43:00] the ton
[43:02] throne.
[43:04] They were told
[43:06] that they would
[43:09] spare
[43:10] their lives
[43:12] if they would
[43:14] renounce
[43:16] the name of Christ.
[43:20] But one by one
[43:24] they chose
[43:26] to die
[43:28] the son of God.
[43:32] There would deny
[43:36] it might
[43:38] and
[43:41] quiet.
[43:44] I can almost
[43:46] here.
[43:48] Therefore,
[43:51] I place
[43:54] allees
[43:57] to the L
[44:00] with all my strength.
[44:04] With all
[44:06] I am,
[44:08] I will seek
[44:10] to honor
[44:13] his command.
[44:16] I pledge
[44:18] alce
[44:21] to you
[44:24] the land vest
[44:30] alleges

[44:50] command.
[44:52] I pledge
[44:54] alleience
[44:56] to
[45:00] the land. Listen to this.
[45:04] Now the years have come
[45:08] and the years have gone,
[45:12] but the cause of Jesus
[45:16] still goes on.
[45:19] Now a time has come
[45:23] to count
[45:25] the cost
[45:27] to reach this world
[45:31] and embrace
[45:33] the cross.
[45:36] One by one,
[45:39] let us live our lives
[45:43] for the one who died
[45:48] and to give us life
[45:51] till the trumpet sound
[45:55] that fire.
[45:59] Let us proudly stand

[47:29] Hallelujah. Let's all stand this
[47:31] morning.
[47:34] Brother Joe, if you could bring us to
[47:36] requests.
[47:43] Lord, with each one of you this morning,
[47:45] have a lot to be thankful for, don't we?
[47:48] Amen. Want to welcome our visitors. I
[47:50] notice we have Sister Angel here this
[47:52] morning. And So John and his friend and
[47:55] also brother Ted and his wife from San
[47:57] Carlos. We sure appreciate our visitors
[47:59] filling some seats this morning.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; I just want to go on record saying,
[48:05] "Sister Lorie Snow, you look fabulous
[48:08] today.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; It's good to see you, Brother Randy,
[48:10] Sister Melissa. I have such a way with
[48:12] words. I've said it in a way where she
[48:15] said, "Well, I thought I looked okay."
[48:17] And then you said, "We've got a long way
[48:18] to go." Oh, but I know you know she
[48:20] knows my heart and just good to be in
[48:22] service with each one.
[48:27] Sister Tila, nice to see you this
[48:29] morning. She writes that she wants to
[48:30] thank you, the prayers, the pastor of
[48:32] the church for the prayers and she's
[48:35] feeling much better after starting
[48:36] injections and the help for the back
[48:39] surgery and just trusting the Lord for
[48:41] total healing. Good to be in church this
[48:43] morning. God bless you. my sister will
[48:45] keep you in prayer and and we know we
[48:47] have some traveling, some out this
[48:49] morning. We're fighting a battle. It's
[48:51] the last season, the last hour. So, just
[48:54] bring that request to Almighty God this
[48:56] morning. Dear God, we're very thankful
[48:58] to be in church. So much to be thankful
[49:00] for, Lord. We don't have the words and
[49:03] the songs, Lord. They just scratched the
[49:05] surface of what our thoughts, Lord, our
[49:08] worship of you today. we could put all
[49:12] the words and the letters of the
[49:13] alphabet and things together, Lord, just
[49:15] couldn't touch what your mighty power is
[49:18] and your goodness to us. Just invite
[49:20] you, Lord, to continue to bless the the
[49:23] church, the saints, Lord, the worship
[49:25] service, these
[49:27] songs that have been sung, Lord, the
[49:30] pledging allegiance to you this morning,
[49:32] Lord, our pastor. We just echo those
[49:37] things about him and his burden. Lord,
[49:39] we know it's a very difficult job. It's
[49:41] a 24/7 job. It's a labor of love. Lord,
[49:44] for him, Sister Sharon, for Carissa, for
[49:47] Levi, for Aaliyah, Lord, we appreciate
[49:49] him so much. And we don't tell them
[49:50] enough, but we want to thank you for
[49:54] them this morning, Lord, for each one
[49:56] that it's a small sacrifice, Lord, to
[49:59] come out and say a few things and sing a
[50:02] few songs, Lord. But now, it's time to
[50:04] hear from heaven. And we just pray for
[50:07] your continued anointing, Lord. We thank
[50:08] you for brother John and his family and
[50:10] just continue to bless the worship.
[50:13] Lord, as we move that forward and then
[50:14] the word, Lord, may our ears be open to
[50:17] hear from heaven. Lord, we bring a a
[50:19] small tithe and offering maybe to the
[50:22] house of the Lord, knowing that you own
[50:23] it all, Father, that we are just
[50:25] stewards of the things that you give to
[50:27] us. Our jobs, Lord, the money, our cars,
[50:29] our houses, it's not ours. We're just
[50:32] taking care of it, Lord, for the kingdom
[50:34] of God, however you'd see fit, Lord. We
[50:36] commit it all to you in the mighty name
[50:37] of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus
[50:39] in thankfulness and all God's people
[50:42] say.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Lori, if you would work
[50:50] your way down. I believe Brother Zach is
[50:52] going to be accompanying her this
[50:53] morning. And let's just sing the chorus
[50:55] that Sister Po's been playing there. In
[50:57] the presence of Jehovah.
[50:59] In the presence
[51:07] of Jehovah,
[51:15] God Almighty,

[51:30] trles,
[51:38] hearts
[51:40] are made

[51:54] of the king. Let's sing that second
[51:57] verse. Through his love, the Lord
[51:59] provided.
[52:01] Through his love, the Lord provided
[52:09] a resting place for me.
[52:17] It's a place to find the answer
[52:24] in the hour of
[52:27] distress.
[52:32] There is never any reason
[52:40] to give up in despair.
[52:48] Just slip away.
[52:50] Breathe
[52:52] his name.
[52:55] He will surely meet
[52:58] you there
[53:04] in
[53:05] the presence
[53:12] of Jehovah.
[53:18] Oh God almighty.
[53:21] God almighty.
[53:24] You're my prince,
[53:28] my prince of peace.
[53:32] And in that presence, our trles
[53:37] manage.
[53:41] In his presence, hearts are mened.
[53:45] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[53:49] Make him welcome this morning in the
[53:53] presence
[53:59] of
[54:00] the king. Amen. You can be seated.
[54:12] While brother Zach is getting ready, I
[54:15] just wanted to thank each and every one
[54:17] of you for the prayers
[54:20] for me. The only reason I am here is
[54:24] because of the prayers of the saints and
[54:26] I thank the Lord for extra days.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing else just to give him thanks.
[55:15] There
[55:17] may be storms
[55:20] that will move in our way.
[55:27] and trials
[55:30] may come
[55:32] to only test my faith.

[1:02:08] this morning. Couldn't help but think of
[1:02:11] David, the valleys that he went through.
[1:02:15] And in his deepest, darkest valleys, he
[1:02:17] would encourage himself in the Lord. And
[1:02:18] just the the psalms that we get such
[1:02:20] encouragement out of when he was going
[1:02:22] through that trial,
[1:02:24] he would say, "Great is his
[1:02:26] faithfulness. His mercy is sufficient
[1:02:28] for me."
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Just remain standing. We normally have
[1:02:33] you sit down as the musicians play, but
[1:02:37] that song that brother Jonathan was
[1:02:39] singing the second verse.
[1:02:42] Something about standing
[1:02:45] and just pledging allegiance to the lamb
[1:02:48] this morning, with all my strength, with
[1:02:50] all I am. You know, Jesus will take
[1:02:54] whatever we give him. But he's asked for
[1:02:56] more than our strength. He's asked for
[1:02:58] our heart, our soul, our mind. He'll
[1:03:01] take what you give him. But
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; so don't don't pledge allegiance to more
[1:03:05] than you're willing to give this
[1:03:06] morning, but he'd love for you to give
[1:03:08] him his all your all this morning. And
[1:03:10] let's just sing that chorus. We'll sing
[1:03:12] it once and then just keep your hands
[1:03:15] raised however long they continue to
[1:03:17] play it till our pastor comes out. Lord,
[1:03:19] I pledge allegiance to you this morning.
[1:03:21] With all my strength, with all I am,
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; I pledge
[1:03:27] allegiance
[1:03:29] to
[1:03:31] the Lamb.
[1:03:33] With all my strength,
[1:03:38] with all I am, I will seek
[1:03:43] to honor
[1:03:46] his
[1:03:48] command.
[1:03:50] I pledge
[1:03:52] alance
[1:03:54] to
[1:03:58] the lamb.
[1:04:00] Just remain standing as they continue to
[1:04:02] play.
[1:04:24] It is command.
[1:04:49] Jesus
[1:04:56] Christ.
[1:05:08] Praise to God.
[1:05:14] Amen.
[1:05:26] be
[1:05:53] all the And we
[1:05:59] will see
[1:06:02] the heart
[1:06:05] is
[1:06:18] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:06:19] praise. Good morning.
[1:06:25] like to welcome you to the house of the
[1:06:27] Lord. I trust everybody is feeling fine.
[1:06:30] Amen. We welcome you and I like to see
[1:06:33] your smiles on your faces and Amen. We
[1:06:36] know that something good is going to
[1:06:38] happen this morning. We believe that and
[1:06:40] so we appreciate each of you the
[1:06:43] sacrifice you have made to come. The
[1:06:45] visitors that are here welcome you. As
[1:06:48] we prepare to go to the word, let's bow
[1:06:50] our heads in prayer. Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:06:54] Lord, we can do nothing without you.
[1:06:58] You're the very source of our life. And
[1:07:01] the reason we're here today is because
[1:07:03] you brought us here. You made it
[1:07:06] possible for us to be here, still alive,
[1:07:11] trying to serve you with all of our
[1:07:13] hearts. Oh God, I just commit this
[1:07:16] service and ourselves into your hands.
[1:07:20] May you take full control this morning.
[1:07:22] Minister to us, Lord, as only you know
[1:07:25] how. It's in the mighty name of Jesus
[1:07:28] Christ we pray and we thank you. Amen.
[1:07:32] God bless you, saints. Amen. So, I
[1:07:35] certainly appreciate those song specials
[1:07:38] and uh very very nice. I really enjoy
[1:07:41] that a number of visitors here today. I
[1:07:44] don't have a list of them, but I know I
[1:07:47] heard that Sister Angel was here. God
[1:07:49] bless her. Um, some folks from the
[1:07:51] reservation are here. That's Is that
[1:07:54] brother said?
[1:07:57] Tell me his name.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ted. Brother Ted. Sister Esther.
[1:08:00] Praise the Lord from the resurre. God
[1:08:02] bless them. Let's give the Lord a hand
[1:08:04] of praise.
[1:08:08] Brother John Duncan, our good friend,
[1:08:11] and a a gentleman that's a brother
[1:08:14] that's with him visiting for the first
[1:08:16] time.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; So, we welcome him. welcome them to the
[1:08:19] house of the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:23] Amen.
[1:08:25] Any other visitors that are here, we
[1:08:27] welcome you. Our good friend, brother um
[1:08:30] Zephaniah Papiso, he's here from uh the
[1:08:34] Eastern Cape and uh he's a missionary
[1:08:38] and he has worked with um the Voice of
[1:08:41] God Ministries over the years. He does
[1:08:44] it now, but he speaks the C plowser
[1:08:48] language. You got to do that click and I
[1:08:50] don't know how to do it.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; How's How's uh language and his it's his
[1:08:56] voice on over 70 messages or so that
[1:09:01] interpreting the message of the prophet
[1:09:03] and uh he lives in a very rural area and
[1:09:07] uh but he's been holding up the good
[1:09:09] faith there and establishing churches
[1:09:12] and we want to hear from him tonight.
[1:09:14] And so you pray for our brother
[1:09:16] Zephaniah and uh this morning and this
[1:09:20] afternoon. So we thank the Lord for each
[1:09:22] of you and we'd like to as we're
[1:09:25] standing to go right into the word and
[1:09:27] we'll turn. Good to see brother Vidalis
[1:09:30] and Amen. Amen. This morning and each of
[1:09:33] you in the scripture in Matthew chapter
[1:09:36] 13, we greet the saints in Phoenix as
[1:09:39] well. Brother Art,
[1:09:41] Brother Stevie, and the saints keeping
[1:09:45] the doors and the service moving forward
[1:09:48] there that gather in the name.
[1:09:52] Um, Matthew chapter 13
[1:10:04] in verse number three. And he spake many
[1:10:07] things
[1:10:09] unto them in parables,
[1:10:12] saying, Behold, a swer went forth to
[1:10:15] sow, and when he sowed, some seeds fell
[1:10:19] by the wayside. The fowls came and
[1:10:21] devoured them up. Some fell upon stony
[1:10:24] places where they had not much earth,
[1:10:27] forth with they sprung up, because they
[1:10:30] had no deepness of earth. And when the
[1:10:33] sun was up, they were scorched. And
[1:10:36] because they had no root, they withered
[1:10:39] away.
[1:10:40] And some fell among thorns, and the
[1:10:42] thorns sprung up and choked them. But
[1:10:44] others fell in good ground and brought
[1:10:46] forth fruit, some 100fold, some 60fold,
[1:10:51] some 30fold. Notice, everybody brought
[1:10:55] forth something. Verse nine, who hath
[1:10:59] ears to hear, let him hear.
[1:11:04] And the disciples came and said unto
[1:11:07] him, Why speak thou unto them in
[1:11:11] parables?
[1:11:13] And he answered and said unto them,
[1:11:14] Because it is given unto you to know the
[1:11:18] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; but to them it is not given. For
[1:11:25] whosoever hath to him shall be given,
[1:11:27] and he shall have more abundance, but
[1:11:31] whosoever hath not, from him shall be
[1:11:34] taken away even that he hath. Therefore,
[1:11:40] speak I to them in parables, because
[1:11:43] seeing they see not, and hearing they
[1:11:45] hear not, neither do they understand.
[1:11:50] And then Jesus goes on and quotes Isaiah
[1:11:53] the prophet. We'll take one more
[1:11:54] scripture in Revelations chapter 10.
[1:11:59] Very familiar scripture.
[1:12:02] Hallmark scriptures for the message
[1:12:05] believers.
[1:12:07] Those that follow the message
[1:12:10] of the hour.
[1:12:13] That's becoming a little more difficult
[1:12:17] for some people to even say that you
[1:12:19] follow the message of the hour. But
[1:12:22] don't let the devil fool you. Don't you
[1:12:25] let the devil fool you. He doesn't make
[1:12:27] the rules. God makes the rules. And he's
[1:12:31] the one that we serve. Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And so he's led us by a great and
[1:12:37] tremendous message of this day. In
[1:12:42] verse number one, I saw another mighty
[1:12:45] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:12:47] a cloud. A rainbow was upon his head.
[1:12:50] His face was as it were the sun, his
[1:12:54] feet as pillars of fire. He had in his
[1:12:56] hand a little book open, and he set his
[1:12:59] right foot upon the sea, and his left
[1:13:02] foot upon the earth. And he cried with a
[1:13:04] loud voice as when a lion roarth. And
[1:13:07] when he had cried, what happened?
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Seven thunders uttered their voices.
[1:13:14] Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; And when the seven thunders uttered
[1:13:16] their voices, I was about to write, and
[1:13:20] I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto
[1:13:22] me, Seal up those things which the seven
[1:13:26] thunders uttered, and write them not.
[1:13:28] And the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:13:31] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[1:13:33] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:13:36] liveth forever and ever who created
[1:13:38] heaven and the things that are therein
[1:13:40] are and the earth and the things that
[1:13:42] therein are and the sea the things that
[1:13:45] which are therein that should be time
[1:13:49] lower.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse seven alto together. But in
[1:13:53] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:13:55] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:13:59] mystery of God should be finished, as he
[1:14:02] hath declared to his servants the
[1:14:05] prophets. And may God bless the reading
[1:14:08] of his word. You may be seated. Why the
[1:14:11] mysteries?
[1:14:14] That's the title of our message this
[1:14:15] morning. Why the mysteries? We have
[1:14:20] heard of these great mysteries.
[1:14:24] Um if you have been in church at any
[1:14:27] amount of time in your life, you would
[1:14:29] have come across that word mystery.
[1:14:32] Mysteries
[1:14:35] um in your in your Bible and the
[1:14:38] scriptures
[1:14:40] are um not silent on what those
[1:14:43] mysteries are. in Matthew chapter 13
[1:14:47] that we read there in the Scullfield
[1:14:50] Bible, it will lay out those mysteries,
[1:14:53] what those mysteries are. There's about
[1:14:55] 11 that Dr. Scoffield writes out
[1:15:00] and um in the message, Brother Banner
[1:15:03] goes a little further and he adds some
[1:15:06] more mysteries that has been revealed
[1:15:08] even in this day. If you remember, he
[1:15:11] goes into the mystery of the baptism of
[1:15:14] the Holy Ghost without sensation. The
[1:15:17] mystery of um the water baptism, the
[1:15:21] mystery of serpent seed,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; serpent seed, it's one of the mysteries.
[1:15:26] Scoffield doesn't write that in. And
[1:15:28] there's several mysteries,
[1:15:32] but you know, we'll get criticized or
[1:15:34] many of us can be criticized and be
[1:15:37] critical. And I have too been critical
[1:15:41] over coming to a church and most of the
[1:15:45] language you hear you don't understand.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Some of the verbiage, some of the some
[1:15:51] of the the terminology you might you
[1:15:55] might not understand.
[1:15:57] And so the pressure has been for whoever
[1:16:01] the speakers are not to dumb it down but
[1:16:04] to make it more presentable for the
[1:16:08] newcomer
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; and I believe that's that's a good uh uh
[1:16:12] uh avenue. I believe that should be
[1:16:14] there. But we don't do that in lie of or
[1:16:19] in sacrifice
[1:16:21] of what the mysteries are.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And the mysteries are not things that we
[1:16:26] should run away from.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; The mysteries are the things that we
[1:16:30] embrace. Just pick up your Bible.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Just read your Bible. Don't take my word
[1:16:34] for it. Don't take any other preachers's
[1:16:36] word for it. you pick up your Bible and
[1:16:39] look up the word mystery and see what
[1:16:43] the Bible says about that. Can we do
[1:16:45] that just for a moment?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; In Mark 4 11, it says, "He said unto
[1:16:51] them, unto you it is given to know the
[1:16:56] mystery of the kingdom of God. But un
[1:17:01] but unto them that are without all these
[1:17:06] things are done in parables.
[1:17:11] Romans 11:25. For I would not, brethren,
[1:17:14] that you should be ignorant of this
[1:17:18] mystery, lest you should be wise in your
[1:17:21] own conceit that blindness in part is
[1:17:23] happen to Israel until the fullness of
[1:17:26] the Gentiles be come in. The Lord help
[1:17:29] us. We'll get back to that if the Lord
[1:17:31] would help us. Romans 16 verse 25
[1:17:35] says, "Now to him that is of power to
[1:17:39] establish you according to my gospel and
[1:17:43] the preaching of what?"
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. According to the
[1:17:48] revelation of the mystery which was kept
[1:17:52] secret since the world began.
[1:17:55] 1 Corinthians 2:7, "But we speak the
[1:17:58] wisdom of God in a mystery,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; even the hidden wisdom, which God
[1:18:06] ordained before the world unto our
[1:18:09] glory."
[1:18:11] 1 Corinthians 15:51.
[1:18:14] Want to thank you all in the Thank you,
[1:18:16] sis, in the back. She's pretty fast and
[1:18:19] she's getting these up. 1 Corinthians
[1:18:20] 15:51. But I show you a mystery. We
[1:18:24] shall not all sleep.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; But we shall all be changed.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; How many's interested in that?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; How many interested in being changed?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Well, that's a mystery.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "I show you a mystery.
[1:18:40] We're not going to all go to sleep.
[1:18:44] Some of us
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; will still be here
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; and we will be CHANGED
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; IN THE MOMENT, in the twinkling of an
[1:18:54] eye.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Paul showed that to us.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Embrace it.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Don't run from it.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Be grateful for it.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Says, "Behold, I show you a mystery. We
[1:19:04] shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
[1:19:07] changed."
[1:19:08] Ephesians 1
[1:19:11] verse number nine says,
[1:19:15] "Having made known unto us the mystery
[1:19:17] of his will."
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; According to his good pleasure, which he
[1:19:26] hath purposed in himself.
[1:19:30] You know, his will is a mystery, but he
[1:19:34] has showed it unto us.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. having made known unto us the
[1:19:38] mystery of his will according to his
[1:19:40] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:19:43] himself. Ephesians 3:3 says, "How that
[1:19:48] by revelation he made known unto me the
[1:19:51] mystery as I wrote a four in a few
[1:19:54] words." This is the Apostle Paul writing
[1:19:58] verse four. whereby when we read, we may
[1:20:02] understand
[1:20:03] my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
[1:20:06] which in other ages was not made known
[1:20:09] unto the sons of men, as it is now
[1:20:13] revealed unto his holy apostles
[1:20:17] and prophets by the spirit. Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:26 says, "Even the mystery
[1:20:24] which has been hid from ages
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; and from generations,
[1:20:30] but now
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; but now is made manifest."
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; To who?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; To his saints.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; There is no university going to give you
[1:20:45] this mystery.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; There is no church group. There is no
[1:20:49] man talking to you going to open up this
[1:20:53] mystery. But he has given to us
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; by his love, by his mercy, by his grace,
[1:21:02] the revelation
[1:21:04] of who Jesus is.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of who Jesus is,
[1:21:11] making known this great mystery. Let me
[1:21:15] take this scripture in Colossians 4:3
[1:21:17] and it says, "With all praying also for
[1:21:19] us,
[1:21:21] pray for us that God would open unto us
[1:21:25] a door of o utterance
[1:21:28] to speak what?
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; The mystery of Christ, which I am also
[1:21:35] in bound." So, who's the author of the
[1:21:39] mystery?
[1:21:41] God
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; who's the one that's bringing up the my
[1:21:45] who presents the word in a mystery.
[1:21:49] It's God himself.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; So it's not a church.
[1:21:54] It's not a group of people. Now people
[1:21:56] can make it mysterious and there's
[1:21:59] people that can make it confusing
[1:22:01] but God hides himself in simplicity.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Then he reveals himself. Remember saints
[1:22:11] as the prophet told us Matthew 16, upon
[1:22:14] this rock I will build my church
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:22:19] against it. Upon this rock, what is the
[1:22:22] rock? The rock is a revelation.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Revelation is to reveal things that are
[1:22:28] hidden.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; To be a believer, you must have a
[1:22:32] revelation.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Revelation is not the same of education.
[1:22:35] It's not the same of knowledge. It's not
[1:22:37] the same of you reading. It's not the
[1:22:39] same as somebody telling you. Revelation
[1:22:41] was is when God opens your eyes and
[1:22:44] reveals to you
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; who he is.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Now the entire church is built upon it.
[1:22:54] We have taken criticism
[1:22:57] because we preach the mystery.
[1:23:01] We want it so easy that um and many of
[1:23:07] us approach God this way like God I need
[1:23:10] to know this and I need to know it right
[1:23:12] now and in fact I want to know it
[1:23:15] without praying without wrestling for it
[1:23:18] without tearing into my personal time
[1:23:21] without being hurt for it without being
[1:23:24] h abused or accused for it. We just want
[1:23:27] to know the information.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. But he doesn't present it
[1:23:31] that way. He presents it in the mystery.
[1:23:35] And the disciples says, "Why are you
[1:23:37] speaking to them in parables?" Jesus
[1:23:39] quotes Isaiah and said, "Because it is
[1:23:42] given unto you to know the mystery."
[1:23:47] So, how many love the mystery?
[1:23:49] The mysteries require
[1:23:52] the you know know in the scriptures we
[1:23:54] have keys
[1:23:56] and we have things that are locked and
[1:23:59] things that need to be opened up
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; and we don't even understand our lives.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Not just the mystery of who God is or
[1:24:08] the mystery of the seven seal or the the
[1:24:11] mystery of you know iniquity and all
[1:24:14] these great mysteries that need to be
[1:24:16] unlocked. What about the mystery of who
[1:24:18] I am?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; WHY DO I HAVE TO suffer through the
[1:24:23] things that I suffered? Why was I raised
[1:24:26] in the home I WAS RAISED IN?
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; WHO AM I?
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; WHY AM I SO concerned
[1:24:35] about where I'M GOING TOMORROW? THAT is
[1:24:37] a mystery.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And your mom and dad can't tell you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't tell yourself.
[1:24:47] These great mysteries
[1:24:49] need to be unlocked,
[1:24:52] unfolded,
[1:24:55] revealed
[1:24:56] so that you can walk in the knowledge of
[1:25:00] who Jesus is.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; You know, the mystery
[1:25:04] that has been unfolded or unlocked
[1:25:07] removes the confusion.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That this age is the most confusing age.
[1:25:12] There's more confusion than any other
[1:25:15] age. Even around believers, around
[1:25:17] people, around the nation, the nation's
[1:25:20] identity, who a young man is today, a
[1:25:24] young woman today, what marriage is, and
[1:25:27] all those things, it's just a confusing
[1:25:29] time. But when something is revealed to
[1:25:32] you, the revelation removes the
[1:25:35] confusion.
[1:25:38] So you're not spending years of your
[1:25:40] life trying to accomplish something that
[1:25:42] absolutely means nothing to you.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Years of your life spending your wheels
[1:25:49] trying to BECOME SOMETHING THAT GOD
[1:25:52] NEVER WANTED you to become.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; But when he reveals to you
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; or HE MAKES IT KNOWN TO OR HE OPENS IT
[1:26:00] UP to you,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; man, you can get up with a purpose. YOU
[1:26:05] CAN WAKE UP AND MOVE FORWARD WITH A
[1:26:07] PURPOSE.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION FROM
[1:26:10] NOBODY. YOU CAN WALK FORWARD IN ALL OF
[1:26:13] THE PROMISES OF THE ALMIGHTY God
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; because he's revealed to you
[1:26:20] that you're a son of God.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; This may take some time.
[1:26:28] This may take some struggle.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; This may take some wrestling.
[1:26:34] Ask our dear brother Joseph in the
[1:26:36] Bible.
[1:26:38] Ask him as a young boy the dreams coming
[1:26:41] to him, spiritual dreams. Ask him about
[1:26:44] the love his father had for him and the
[1:26:46] hatred his brothers had for him. Ask
[1:26:49] Joseph if he had all the answers to his
[1:26:53] life. HE DID NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS. IT
[1:26:56] WAS A MYSTERY. BUT WHEN GOD OPENED THE
[1:26:59] MYSTERY TO HIM, HIS LIFE IS NOW A
[1:27:03] testimony
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; moving and working in him.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; So what is a mystery? Scoffield takes
[1:27:15] that mystery and it's a previously
[1:27:17] hidden truth and that is made known.
[1:27:22] There's still a supernatural element to
[1:27:24] it as he gives that definition. And let
[1:27:26] me just read it here quickly. Brother
[1:27:28] Brandham reads it too. A mystery in
[1:27:30] scripture is a previously hidden truth
[1:27:33] now divinely revealed but in but in
[1:27:39] which a supernatural element still
[1:27:42] remains despite the revelation.
[1:27:47] So Dr. Scoffield lists some of these
[1:27:51] mysteries that are to be revealed in the
[1:27:53] last day. And there's a list of them.
[1:27:56] I'll just read them for you here
[1:27:58] quickly.
[1:28:00] And maybe we'll take one of them. One of
[1:28:02] the mysteries is the mystery of the
[1:28:05] kingdom of heaven. Matthew 13. That's
[1:28:08] what we read. The mystery of Israel's
[1:28:10] blindness during this age. That's Romans
[1:28:13] 11. The mystery of the translation of
[1:28:16] the living saints at the end of the age.
[1:28:19] 1 Corinthians 15. 1 Thessalonians 4:14.
[1:28:24] The mystery of the New Testament church
[1:28:27] as one body composed of Jew and Gentile.
[1:28:31] Ephesians 3, Romans 16, Colossians 4.
[1:28:37] The mystery of the church as the bride
[1:28:39] of Christ. Ephesians 5. The mystery of
[1:28:43] the in-living Christ. Galatians 2,
[1:28:46] Colossians 1. The mystery of God, even
[1:28:50] Christ. Christ as the incarnate fullness
[1:28:54] of the Godhead bodily or embodied. First
[1:28:58] Colossians 2, 1 Corinthians 2:7.
[1:29:03] And you can also put 1 Timothy 3:16.
[1:29:08] And he mentions that one. The mystery of
[1:29:09] the process by which God likeness is
[1:29:12] restored to men. 1 Corinth 1 Timothy
[1:29:15] 3:16. The mystery of iniquity. 2
[1:29:18] Thessalonians 2, Matthew 13. The mystery
[1:29:22] of the seven stars.
[1:29:25] Revelations 1:20. Is that too much
[1:29:27] scripture for you?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Did you want to hear the politics?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Was y'all coming here to hear some news?
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I was supposed
[1:29:35] to read from the scripture.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, is this too much Bible for
[1:29:39] you?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Where are we at?
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; This is not a YouTube channel.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; It's not a session to sit back, somebody
[1:29:48] to entertain you.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; I JUST QUOTED FROM THE LIVING WORD OF
[1:29:54] GOD THAT HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS
[1:29:58] AWAY,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; BUT MY word shall never pass away.
[1:30:07] Can I keep reading the scripture?
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Two more. Revelations 120, the mystery
[1:30:14] of the seven stars,
[1:30:18] the mystery of Babylon. Revelation 17:5.
[1:30:23] So, are there mysteries in the Bible?
[1:30:25] Yes. Who authors them?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; God does. Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Now, man gets in there and they
[1:30:34] manipulate and they make things
[1:30:36] confusing. They make it harder. They try
[1:30:39] to use it to manipulate people. We agree
[1:30:42] that's there. But let's go. Where did
[1:30:44] mysteries originally come from?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; They're in your Bible.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; They're given to us
[1:30:51] by God himself. And there's a purpose
[1:30:54] that he gives us these
[1:30:57] mysteries
[1:30:59] so that we can speak them
[1:31:04] so that his plans can be made known.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; a mystery is a previously hidden truth,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; but it's still hidden to many. Right?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Because it's been opened up to you
[1:31:22] doesn't mean everybody else has received
[1:31:25] that revelation.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; The re the revelation of water baptism.
[1:31:29] There was a particular time in the age
[1:31:33] that that was revealed. It was called
[1:31:35] the open door age.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Adam tells us that and that was
[1:31:39] revealed
[1:31:41] in its season between the Philadelphia
[1:31:44] and the Leodysian church age. that age
[1:31:47] called it the open door. I have set
[1:31:49] before thee an open door. And that was
[1:31:52] the revelation of who Jesus was and the
[1:31:54] revelation of water baptism.
[1:31:57] Now, everyone still didn't get to walk
[1:32:01] through that door.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Although the door has been open for
[1:32:05] quite some time. So there the there the
[1:32:08] mysteries that have previously been
[1:32:11] hidden, they're still hidden to many. So
[1:32:16] let let me let me just take this here
[1:32:20] in the Philadelphia church age
[1:32:23] and talk about this open door just for a
[1:32:25] moment because it was a particular time
[1:32:29] in in in history that it was made known.
[1:32:32] Now in 1961 the message Messiah brother
[1:32:35] Brandham says this here
[1:32:38] paragraph 53. And how was the book of
[1:32:41] acts wrote? Start reading it. Look how
[1:32:44] we've contaminated it with all kinds of
[1:32:47] foolish things of our own. But there
[1:32:50] will be someone come someday, a light
[1:32:53] before the going out, this open door
[1:32:57] that set before the church. Watch and
[1:33:00] see if it doesn't come some of these
[1:33:03] days. God will send the Elijah. just as
[1:33:07] certain as I'm standing in this pull
[1:33:09] pit, he will send and the Elijah will
[1:33:12] shake the people right straight back to
[1:33:14] the original Pentecostal doctrine.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; All right, it continues on in the
[1:33:21] Philadelphiaian church age. I have it
[1:33:24] here.
[1:33:26] Actually, I got it right here. Paragraph
[1:33:28] 236. Now, this great temptation, he
[1:33:31] says, this is 1960, December 1960.
[1:33:35] this great temptation, the hour of
[1:33:37] temptation that shall come to try the
[1:33:40] whole world goes into the tribulation.
[1:33:43] Just in a few minutes, we'll see it goes
[1:33:46] into the tribulation. And the
[1:33:48] tribulation did not come in the days of
[1:33:50] Wesley. So, what age are we in? What's
[1:33:54] this door set before us? It's between
[1:33:57] the Wesley, where the church is headed
[1:34:00] right now, and already into the
[1:34:02] Leodysian age. But this little place
[1:34:06] right in here with the last within the
[1:34:10] last 3540 years has been an open door
[1:34:15] setting right before the people to come
[1:34:17] in and God will take the remnant and
[1:34:20] seal it off and they'll go on into a
[1:34:24] lukewarm and he'll spew them out of his
[1:34:27] mouth. The work will be cut short. Up
[1:34:30] goes the church. And here comes the
[1:34:32] Antichrist moving in for destruction.
[1:34:36] Just perfect. Fits with the whole Bible
[1:34:40] right on around.
[1:34:44] Now, he continues on in this open door
[1:34:48] thought. It's the same message that's
[1:34:50] going up a few more paragraphs.
[1:34:53] Paragraph 119, he says this here, a open
[1:34:57] door. What was it? It was the revelation
[1:35:01] of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:06] Not being a second person of a trinity,
[1:35:09] but being God himself made flesh and
[1:35:12] dwelling among us.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; And the revelation, now if you notice
[1:35:15] just in a minute, let's read just a
[1:35:17] little bit farther.
[1:35:19] Shut it. Has a little strength. Has not
[1:35:21] denied my name. The first time the
[1:35:24] name's been spoke of now since back in
[1:35:27] this age back here lost its name. Luther
[1:35:32] come out with the name that he was alive
[1:35:34] and was dead. That's right. Father, Son,
[1:35:37] and Holy Ghost. Here, here comes out the
[1:35:40] name of Jesus again in between these two
[1:35:44] ages here in between the open door. Now
[1:35:48] it's a revelation what he was the deity.
[1:35:53] The revelations of his deity.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] How many has that revelation?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Well, we ought to be thankful for it.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; I think because it's been revealed to
[1:36:09] us, we might not know or be aware that a
[1:36:13] very small fraction of people know what
[1:36:17] you know.
[1:36:18] You are in the minority
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; for to be able to even open the Bible
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; and understand that that an Elijah was
[1:36:26] supposed to come.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; You are in the minority to know how to
[1:36:30] be baptized.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; You are in the minority to know what it
[1:36:34] means to repent,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; what it means TO BE SAVED,
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; what it means to really dedicate your
[1:36:42] life to the Lord.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; You are in the minority. When you
[1:36:46] realize that Jesus is the word,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; and when PEOPLE SAY, "I LOVE JESUS AND I
[1:36:53] WANT JESUS," THEY'RE REALLY SAYING, "I
[1:36:55] WANT THE WORD."
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; How many of us ever met Jesus face to
[1:37:02] face, saw how tall he was, held him in
[1:37:06] his hand in his corporal body? No.
[1:37:08] Nobody here did. No. But we know Jesus
[1:37:11] through what? His word. It's through the
[1:37:14] word that we know Jesus.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is his word.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness this morning?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; That's a tremendous revelation.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; AND WE THANK GOD FOR these revelations
[1:37:29] because God is the author of them. He uh
[1:37:33] uh they're there. They're hidden things.
[1:37:36] There there parts in the in the word
[1:37:38] that we can't really just open up and
[1:37:40] tell everybody because if we do, they
[1:37:44] call us crazy.
[1:37:46] You know how you are on your job. You
[1:37:48] can't tell them everything. They want to
[1:37:51] know the mystery, Brother Joseph, what's
[1:37:53] going on in your life. They want to
[1:37:55] know. And sometimes they'll keep asking
[1:37:57] and keep asking and you're like, "Okay,
[1:37:59] you keep asking, I'm going tell you."
[1:38:02] I had this one gentleman. We was doing
[1:38:04] through work. He was doing a we were
[1:38:06] talking about the Bible or something. He
[1:38:08] was asking me who I thought the first
[1:38:11] twins in the Bible was. I was like, "We
[1:38:13] probably don't want to go to that one."
[1:38:15] He's like, "Come on, which one?" Like,
[1:38:17] he knew who it was. It was Isaac and
[1:38:19] Jacob. I was like, "Nah, I don't think
[1:38:22] WELL, COME ON. TELL ME. WHAT'S THE
[1:38:23] ANSWER?" I SAID, "YOU REALLY WANT TO
[1:38:24] KNOW?"
[1:38:26] And I told him
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; and he received it.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's still in a message church
[1:38:32] over there in Sacramento today.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. They might believe it just
[1:38:37] like you did. Actually,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; they might believe it just like you did.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; But there's some mysterious things. And
[1:38:44] God hid it that way. The disciples ASKED
[1:38:47] HIM, "LORD,
[1:38:49] TELL US PLAINLY."
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU THE ONE OR NOT?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; PILATE ASKED HIM, "MAN, YOUR YOUR LIFE
[1:38:58] IS ON THE LINE. I GOT THE POWER TO
[1:39:01] CONDEMN YOU. I GOT THE POWER TO SET YOU
[1:39:04] FREE.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; DEFEND YOURSELF. HE DIDN'T DEFEND
[1:39:08] HIMSELF. HE DIDN'T DEFEND HIMSELF.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; So mysteries,
[1:39:20] God allows the mystery.
[1:39:23] He brings the mystery on.
[1:39:26] He allows it.
[1:39:28] They come from him. They do exist.
[1:39:32] So what's the problem?
[1:39:35] The problem is
[1:39:38] that many of us
[1:39:41] don't want to do the work
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; required
[1:39:47] to stay long enough
[1:39:50] in a place for God to reveal himself and
[1:39:54] to reveal his will. We're always moving.
[1:39:56] always moving now. I want to know now. I
[1:39:58] want to know now. Everything, every
[1:40:00] service that we have had, you know, in
[1:40:04] cleaning and eating and service and it's
[1:40:06] all about the time. Speed. Speed. Now.
[1:40:08] Now. Now. Who can get it quick? Now.
[1:40:10] Now. Now. And we bring that spirit to
[1:40:12] the word and want God to reveal it now.
[1:40:16] It doesn't work that way.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; He has to allow things to develop.
[1:40:24] I like something that brother Brandham
[1:40:26] preached a number of time. Timeested
[1:40:31] memorials.
[1:40:33] Some memorials you can only give witness
[1:40:37] of them through time.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; This is why the Bible says a bishop
[1:40:41] shouldn't be a novice or a newcomer.
[1:40:43] Why? We need some time. We need to look
[1:40:45] at you.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; We need to judge you.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; We need to not say amen when you're
[1:40:50] preaching.
[1:40:52] We need to not encourage you.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; We need to take something from you. We
[1:40:57] need to talk about your family. Now go
[1:40:59] preach.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Go love everybody AFTER WE DONE GOSSIPED
[1:41:04] on you.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY HELP ME HERE.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; YES. CAN YOU TAKE IT? YOU YOU YOU THINK
[1:41:10] YOU want the mic in your hand. YOU THINK
[1:41:12] YOU WANT THE LIGHTS ON YOU, BUT CAN YOU
[1:41:15] HANDLE THE PRESSURE?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; WELL, WE DON'T KNOW. BUT TIME
[1:41:21] WILL TEST YOU
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE CALLED timetested
[1:41:26] memorials.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Some testimonies are just beautiful
[1:41:32] because you're still alive and you're
[1:41:34] still here.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; You didn't say you don't have to say
[1:41:37] nothing. I SAW THE STORM come through.
[1:41:39] I've heard about the trauma. I HEARD
[1:41:42] ABOUT THE DRAMA. AND I LOOKED THROUGH
[1:41:43] THE CROWD AND YOU STILL STANDING THERE.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; THAT SAYS ENOUGH. YOU'RE STILL HERE.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; STILL LIFTING UP THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; TIMEESTED MEMORIAL.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD I'M STILL ALIVE. AMEN.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Time tested memorials. Yes.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; But here the prophet deals with this
[1:42:10] just a little bit
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; in a couple of places. I'll read for
[1:42:14] you. here
[1:42:16] where
[1:42:17] getting into the spirit
[1:42:20] of revelation
[1:42:23] talks about digging down deep enough
[1:42:27] to get into the spirit
[1:42:30] of revelation.
[1:42:33] Huh?
[1:42:34] Can I read that for you?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Hear what the prophet of God says here.
[1:42:42] It's in the indictment uh 1963
[1:42:46] paragraph 265
[1:42:49] says this.
[1:42:50] Let's move up just a little bit from
[1:42:52] that paragraph. I think I gave you
[1:42:56] the indictment paragraph 265, but move
[1:42:59] up just above that just a little bit.
[1:43:02] Maybe if I'll start reading.
[1:43:04] He says
[1:43:07] I didn't bring my laptop up here.
[1:43:12] But they'll get it. Yes. Move up just a
[1:43:14] little bit. 264.
[1:43:18] All right. Thank you. Paragraph 263. I
[1:43:21] challenge any man to show me, anybody,
[1:43:24] and I know this tape goes around the
[1:43:25] world. Any man, any bishop that will
[1:43:28] come to my study and before this
[1:43:30] congregation and point their finger to
[1:43:32] one place, anybody was ever baptized in
[1:43:35] the name of the father, son, and holy
[1:43:37] ghost in the New Testament. I'll show
[1:43:41] you where every person that ever was
[1:43:42] baptized and those who were baptized
[1:43:45] different had to come and be rebaptized
[1:43:49] to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about it? Stay
[1:43:54] out there in your creeds. Stay out there
[1:43:57] in your dogmas and die. You're guilty
[1:44:00] with wicked hands. You've took the
[1:44:02] prince of life, the word of life, and
[1:44:05] crucified it to the people. Now, what
[1:44:08] did they do? They didn't know it. Today,
[1:44:11] men walk ignorantly.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE TRUTH. They
[1:44:17] think it's some kind of a ism. THEY
[1:44:20] DON'T DIG DOWN deep enough to get into
[1:44:23] the spirit of revelation. They don't
[1:44:26] pray enough. THEY DON'T CALL UPON GOD
[1:44:29] ENOUGH. THEY JUST lightly take it. Oh,
[1:44:33] well, I believe there's a God. Sure. The
[1:44:37] devil believes THE SAME THING.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL BELIEVES IT more than some
[1:44:41] people claim to believe.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; The devil BELIEVES IT AND TREMBLES.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE just believe it and GO ON, BUT
[1:44:49] THE DEVIL TREMBLES KNOWING HIS JUDGMENT
[1:44:52] is coming.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; And people believe it and don't pay no
[1:44:55] attention. The judgment is coming.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; So they don't dig down deep enough.
[1:45:03] Some people want questions answered that
[1:45:06] they didn't even pray about themselves.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I got a question. I got a question. Did
[1:45:11] you even pray about that?
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Did you even search the Lord's word
[1:45:16] about your question?
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; And then did you take it to the Lord in
[1:45:23] prayer
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; and get the assurance that prayer brings
[1:45:28] to you?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; So we're not just praying with the
[1:45:31] formality. Yeah, I prayed about that.
[1:45:34] No, you're praying until he answers WITH
[1:45:37] AN ASSURANCE DOWN in your heart.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Wait,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; stop or go forward.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; SOME KIND OF INSTRUCTIONS HE'LL GIVE you
[1:45:47] when you pray about it.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; It's not everything going to be answered
[1:45:52] right now. challenges me how I am that
[1:45:56] that way and how we're that way. Well,
[1:45:59] we want the answers to uh deep problems,
[1:46:02] developing stories, things that are
[1:46:04] going on right now. We want the answers
[1:46:06] right now. Well, you got to pray about
[1:46:09] it.
[1:46:11] You got to dig down deep. Dig down deep.
[1:46:16] Yes, that's what he said. Take a pick.
[1:46:20] Take a shovel.
[1:46:23] Does any of you all do most of us know
[1:46:25] what a pick and a shovel is?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; We know how to keep our nails nice and
[1:46:31] clean. I'm talking about men supposed to
[1:46:34] be men cleanest fingernails I've ever
[1:46:36] seen. Soft hands don't know what labor
[1:46:39] is. What's a pick? What's a shovel? Man,
[1:46:41] you need to go dig a ditch.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; LIKE ALL DAY.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; GO DIG a ditch.
[1:46:52] And this attitude,
[1:46:55] this softness,
[1:46:58] this weakness
[1:47:01] that can't even pray an hour.
[1:47:05] I I'm I'm going to be real honest with
[1:47:07] you. It takes It takes some endurance
[1:47:10] and strength to pray an hour. How many
[1:47:12] know what I'm talking about?
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The men come together and pray
[1:47:16] typically on Saturday mornings. 5 am to
[1:47:20] 5 a.m.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; If we made it six, would you come?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; What time actually works for you?
[1:47:32] And whatever time we would make it still
[1:47:35] wouldn't come. SOME STILL WOULDN'T COME.
[1:47:37] IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TIME. It's
[1:47:40] something else going on there. to pray
[1:47:42] for an hour to really get into those
[1:47:45] layers of prayer
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; where you get the world off of your mind
[1:47:50] and you start getting all these things
[1:47:51] off of your mind. It takes a little time
[1:47:53] to dig. You start digging down in the
[1:47:56] atmosphere of your life, communing with
[1:47:59] the Lord, DIGGING DOWN WITH THE
[1:48:03] SCRIPTURES, WITH THE QUOTATIONS,
[1:48:06] DIGGING DOWN
[1:48:08] DEEPER AND DEEPER
[1:48:12] UNTIL GOD
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; GIVES YOU a revelation.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful.
[1:48:21] WHEN GOD OPENS UP A DIAMOND FROM HIS
[1:48:24] WORD,
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE OPENS UP A JEWEL FROM HIS WORD,
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, YOU'VE BEEN
[1:48:32] FASTING FOR, YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR,
[1:48:34] THEN HE OPENS IT UP.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; No man can take that from you.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; No church can TAKE IT FROM YOU. NO GROUP
[1:48:43] OF PEOPLE CAN TAKE IT FROM YOU. UPON
[1:48:46] THIS ROCK, I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH.
[1:48:50] AND THE gates of hell shall not be able
[1:48:53] to prevail against it.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; So God ordained mysteries to be there.
[1:49:07] Brother Bham opens up that
[1:49:10] these
[1:49:12] mysteries or these revelations people
[1:49:14] don't pray enough for them. So when did
[1:49:17] he say that? Was that in 1950? This was
[1:49:19] after the seal, sweetheart.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; You know, we're always looking for an
[1:49:24] excuse, right? When did he say that?
[1:49:26] What does it matter?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Look, IT WAS AFTER THE SEALS. HE SAID
[1:49:31] IT. HE SAID IT. I DIDN'T HE SAID IT. WE
[1:49:35] DON'T PRAY ENOUGH. WE DON'T DIG DOWN
[1:49:37] DEEP ENOUGH.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; To get into the spirit of revelation.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; We want it handed to us.
[1:49:47] We want our food
[1:49:50] door dashed to us
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; and they can't get it fast enough.
[1:49:57] Pretty soon we'll ask the Door Dash
[1:49:59] driver, can you open the door and feed
[1:50:01] me too?
[1:50:04] Where are we going with this?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; The open door was an age. It was the
[1:50:16] time that this revelation of who Jesus
[1:50:18] was was open. That's just one of the
[1:50:20] mysteries that the
[1:50:23] scriptures in Matthew 13 are unfolding
[1:50:26] to us. So, Brother Bam goes deeper that
[1:50:28] the that they don't pray enough. They
[1:50:30] don't call on God enough. They don't dig
[1:50:33] down deep enough. Say, "Are you talking
[1:50:35] about me?" No, I'm talking about they
[1:50:37] they don't dig down deep enough. Them
[1:50:39] over there, the other group, the other
[1:50:42] church.
[1:50:44] Doesn't that make us feel better?
[1:50:46] Pastor ain't talking about me. No, he's
[1:50:48] talking about them over there.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the ones that ain't
[1:50:53] in here, right?
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't nobody saying nothing.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Who the Who's this quote talking to?
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Them, right? THEY
[1:51:05] HE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME. HE NOT TALKING
[1:51:07] ABOUT US.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; WHO IS HE TALKING ABOUT? THEY DON'T PRAY
[1:51:13] ENOUGH. THEY DON'T DIG DOWN DEEP ENOUGH.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAS GOD REVEALED TO you
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; about what you're reading in your Bible?
[1:51:24] WHAT HAS HE REVEALED TO YOU ABOUT THIS
[1:51:26] MESSAGE? WHAT HAS HE REVEALED TO YOU
[1:51:29] ABOUT THE WHAT THE CHURCHES ARE DOING
[1:51:31] TODAY AND ALL THE ONSLAUGHT OF CRITICISM
[1:51:35] TODAY? and the explanations
[1:51:39] that we're trying to defend the message
[1:51:41] through an explanation.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God didn't build his church
[1:51:47] upon an explanation.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; He doesn't build it up on some some
[1:51:51] knowledge of some group.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; HE BUILT IT UPON A REVELATION.
[1:51:58] Upon this rock, I build my church. Lord.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; So, we see there's keys that need to be
[1:52:06] unlocked.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, give me a key this morning.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Give me a key that I can go to my job
[1:52:13] and just start unlocking some things.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Go to my prayer life and unlock it.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; There's a key to the door.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the door. Jesus is the faith.
[1:52:28] He is all. But you you enter in through
[1:52:32] the through through through your
[1:52:34] submission to his word.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; And as you submit to his word, he opens
[1:52:39] up more of it. And as you receive it, he
[1:52:41] gives you more.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Now, the scriptures
[1:52:45] are really clear. Matthew 11:28 says,
[1:52:48] "Come unto me all ye that labor and are
[1:52:51] heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[1:52:54] Take my yoke upon you and do what?
[1:52:58] Learn of me,
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; and ye shall find rest unto your souls,
[1:53:06] for my yoke is easy, and my burden is
[1:53:09] light.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:9, there remainth therefore a
[1:53:13] rest to the people of God. For he that
[1:53:16] entered into his rest, he also hath
[1:53:18] ceased from his own works. Let us do
[1:53:21] what?
[1:53:23] Labor. Somebody knows their Bible there.
[1:53:25] Thank you, brother Chuck. Amen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Let us labor therefore to do what?
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; To enter into that rest.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; We just want the rest part. The rest.
[1:53:37] I'm coming to rest. I'm coming to rest.
[1:53:40] No. No more works. I don't have to do
[1:53:41] nothing. Jesus did it all for me.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Did he repent for you?
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; No. He's not going to repent for you.
[1:53:49] You got to repent for you.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; You have to make up your decision. Make
[1:53:53] up your mind. You repent. He that stole
[1:53:56] steal no more.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Turn from your wicked ways. Let the
[1:54:01] things of the world go. You have to let
[1:54:04] it go.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; You labor to enter into that rest.
[1:54:10] These modernday movements
[1:54:14] have presented a gospel where there's no
[1:54:18] work for the believer
[1:54:20] and it's just simply not scriptural.
[1:54:23] You know, you don't work for your
[1:54:25] salvation,
[1:54:27] but there are uh by by grace. Ephesians
[1:54:30] 2:8 says, "By grace are you saved
[1:54:32] through faith, not of works, lest any
[1:54:34] man should boast." And then it continues
[1:54:36] continues on to now to him that workketh
[1:54:39] is a reward, not reckon of grace, but to
[1:54:42] him that workketh not, but believe it.
[1:54:44] His faith is counted for righteousness.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Titus 3:5, "Not by works of
[1:54:50] righteousness which we have done, but
[1:54:52] according to his mercy, he saved us."
[1:54:56] But the scriptures continue to go on. It
[1:54:58] says, James says, "If you say you have
[1:55:01] faith with no works, your faith is dead
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; because it's being alone."
[1:55:10] Titus 3:8, "They that which have
[1:55:11] believed in God might be careful to
[1:55:13] maintain good works." Matthew 5:16, "Let
[1:55:18] your light shine that they may see your
[1:55:22] good works."
[1:55:24] You have works to do,
[1:55:27] but they're founded upon the great work
[1:55:29] that he did at Calvary.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; he died.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; He died so that I could live right.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't die so I can live like the
[1:55:41] devil. He died so a change can come in
[1:55:45] my heart AND I CAN LIVE RIGHT, give
[1:55:48] right, do right, take a stand right.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; So the mysteries are there for the
[1:56:03] reason. Now one of these mysteries
[1:56:07] was the blindness that happened to
[1:56:10] Israel.
[1:56:12] that these Jews actually cried out for
[1:56:15] his blood
[1:56:18] and
[1:56:21] missed him after thousands of years
[1:56:24] waiting for the Messiah to come.
[1:56:28] But in the fifth seal, as the seals are
[1:56:31] open to us
[1:56:33] in Revelation chapter 6, let's turn
[1:56:36] there briefly.
[1:56:41] And like I said, there's 13 mysteries
[1:56:44] that
[1:56:45] Scoffield mentions. Brother Brandham
[1:56:47] adds the other ones afterwards in that
[1:56:51] same line of thinking. It goes deeper.
[1:56:54] But in Revelations chapter
[1:56:57] number six, verse number N says this.
[1:57:02] That's not the heater that's on, is it?
[1:57:06] Thank you.
[1:57:09] Revelation 6 verse number N. When he had
[1:57:13] opened the fifth seal, I saw under the
[1:57:16] altar the souls of them that were slain
[1:57:19] for the word of God and for the
[1:57:21] testimony which they held. They cried
[1:57:24] with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O
[1:57:26] Lord, holy and true, dust thou judge and
[1:57:30] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[1:57:34] the earth?" and white robes were given
[1:57:38] unto every one of them. And it was said
[1:57:40] unto them that they should rest yet for
[1:57:44] a little season until their fellow
[1:57:45] servants also and their brethren that
[1:57:48] should be killed as they were should be
[1:57:51] fulfilled.
[1:57:53] Now the messenger preaches this message,
[1:57:56] the revelation of the seven seals.
[1:57:59] And he preached that message for who?
[1:58:02] Who was that sent to?
[1:58:04] Just the pastors,
[1:58:07] just the brothers. No sisters need to
[1:58:09] read this.
[1:58:11] Young people, you got to be at least 15
[1:58:13] to read your seal book.
[1:58:16] But you read everything else online.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. The seals are too deep. What
[1:58:23] they looking at? What is Nickelodeon
[1:58:25] telling them?
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a old one. Is anybody
[1:58:29] looking at Nickelodeon? That's the last
[1:58:30] one I remember. Huh? What do they call
[1:58:33] it today?
[1:58:35] You don't want to tell me, do you? Which
[1:58:37] one is it that they looking at?
[1:58:40] These little young people, they want to
[1:58:41] tell me, but they don't want to tell me
[1:58:45] looking at that advanced nonsense,
[1:58:49] can read it,
[1:58:51] engulf it, be become one, become
[1:58:54] characters with it, consume it. And then
[1:58:58] when it comes to your seal book, it it
[1:59:01] it becomes like, no, that's a deep
[1:59:04] mystery. You all just talking about
[1:59:05] mysteries. Learn how to love. You can't
[1:59:08] learn how to love until you love his
[1:59:10] word. And his word
[1:59:13] gave us the seven seals.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody?
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's just take this one
[1:59:20] revelation that brother Brandham opens
[1:59:22] up to us. What is taking place here
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; in Revelation chapter 6 under this fifth
[1:59:29] seal?
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; This is one of the mysteries of
[1:59:34] blindness happening to Israel. These are
[1:59:38] the most religious people. These were
[1:59:40] people that were extremely faithful.
[1:59:44] These were holy people set apart for
[1:59:47] ages.
[1:59:49] Ate a certain way, dressed a certain
[1:59:52] way. Not for 10 years, not for five. I'm
[1:59:54] talking about for hundreds of years.
[1:59:57] Their whole life was centered around
[2:00:00] catching our king is coming. We had
[2:00:04] David. We had Solomon. WE HAD ALL OF OUR
[2:00:06] KINGS. Our land has BEEN TAKEN. BUT ONE
[2:00:09] DAY A KING IS GOING TO COME. AND WHEN HE
[2:00:11] CAME, THEY MISSED HIM. HOW HOW DID THEY
[2:00:16] MISS HIM? WELL, there's a mystery why
[2:00:19] they missed him. Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; And let's share it with you. Okay,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; I have seven minutes.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Whose church am I in anyway?
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me in here.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:00:38] Here, the prophet of God says this here,
[2:00:40] paragraph 215. Well, now just a minute.
[2:00:42] We'll find out. Look, these are not the
[2:00:45] souls of the bride church. Not at all.
[2:00:48] We thought that that was the bride
[2:00:50] church waiting there. Souls under the
[2:00:53] altar. You see, crying, "How long, Lord,
[2:00:55] how long?" Let me read it again. When he
[2:00:58] had opened this fifth seal, I saw on the
[2:01:00] alt under the altar the souls of them
[2:01:02] that were slain for the word of God and
[2:01:05] for the testimony they held. See, the
[2:01:08] word of God and the testimony which they
[2:01:11] held. Now, don't move from there just a
[2:01:14] minute. See, he continues reading. Drop
[2:01:16] down to paragraph 218. Now, for they at
[2:01:19] this time, if you notice the fifth seal
[2:01:22] being open, see the church is gone.
[2:01:26] It just can't be. The souls under the
[2:01:30] the early church. Now, please, if you
[2:01:33] did give this attention now, cuz this is
[2:01:36] great controversy. So, I want you to
[2:01:38] listen real close now and you got your
[2:01:41] papers and things right with it. Now I
[2:01:44] want you to notice now these cannot be
[2:01:47] themselves because the souls of the
[2:01:49] righteous martyed and the righteous
[2:01:51] people the church the bride has done
[2:01:54] been took up so they wouldn't be under
[2:01:57] the altar they would they would be in
[2:01:59] glory with the bride now watch for they
[2:02:02] are gone in the rapture in the fourth
[2:02:05] chapter of revelation they was taken up
[2:02:08] now who are these souls then that's the
[2:02:11] next thing who are they in if they're
[2:02:14] not the early church. This is Israel
[2:02:17] that's to be saved as a nation.
[2:02:20] All of them that are predestinated,
[2:02:23] that's Israel. That's Israel itself. You
[2:02:26] see, you say, "Oh, wait a minute. You
[2:02:28] say that it can't." Oh, yes, they are to
[2:02:31] be saved.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Let's settle it here just a minute. I
[2:02:34] got four or five scriptures. I'll take
[2:02:35] one. Let's take Romans just a minute.
[2:02:37] And to find out, let's take the book of
[2:02:39] Romans, the 11th chapter. Romans and
[2:02:43] we'll find out. Just let us just just
[2:02:46] read it.
[2:02:48] Read it ourselves. See, and he takes
[2:02:50] that. For I would not, brethren, that
[2:02:52] you should be ignorant of the mystery.
[2:02:57] Let us should we wise in our own
[2:03:00] conceit. There you are. That blindness
[2:03:02] in part has happened to Israel until the
[2:03:05] fulfilling fullness of the Gentiles we
[2:03:07] come in. the last gentile bride be
[2:03:10] brought in for the bride the blindness
[2:03:13] come to Israel for that purpose. And so
[2:03:17] all Israel shall be saved as it is
[2:03:19] written. There shall come out of Zion a
[2:03:22] deliverer and shall turn away
[2:03:24] ungodliness from Jacob. Right? They are
[2:03:27] Israel. That's under the altar. Watch.
[2:03:31] Israel was blinded for the very purpose
[2:03:34] of us being saved.
[2:03:37] You believe that?
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Now, who blinded them? God.
[2:03:46] GOD BLINDED HIS OWN CHILDREN.
[2:03:50] No wonder Jesus standing there at the
[2:03:52] cross and them Jews howling for his
[2:03:55] blood. That was his own kids. And he was
[2:03:59] the scripture. He was his himself the
[2:04:01] word. And here he knowing that those
[2:04:04] PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GLADLY received him
[2:04:08] and that's the reason he BLINDED THEM SO
[2:04:12] THEY WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM. He come in
[2:04:16] such a humble way and blinded them to it
[2:04:20] that they wouldn't receive it. The
[2:04:23] scripture says they would do it and he
[2:04:26] blinded was blinded. Jesus pied them
[2:04:30] even so much he says, "Father, forgive
[2:04:32] them. They don't know what they're
[2:04:34] doing. They were blind." Let me ask you
[2:04:37] something. If God blinds you, would you
[2:04:41] be able to see?
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:04:46] Brother Bam is telling us here,
[2:04:49] this is showing the grace of God to us.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:53] THAT IF GOD DIDN'T BLIND THEM, they
[2:04:55] would have seen him. And he knows they
[2:04:58] would have seen him. SO HE BLINDED THEM
[2:05:02] SO he could not so they would not see
[2:05:04] him. Excuse me. Sorry. Trying to work
[2:05:08] with this mic here.
[2:05:11] He blinded them, didn't he?
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; He blinded their eyes so they wouldn't
[2:05:16] see him.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; And why did he blind them? He blinded
[2:05:20] them so that you would see him.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; So that the Gentiles would see him.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know. That just done something
[2:05:29] to me as I was thinking about this great
[2:05:31] mystery.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; That if God blinds a man's eyes, he
[2:05:35] can't see.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; But the other side is when God opens a
[2:05:40] man's eyes, he can't help but see.
[2:05:44] AND I'M SO GLAD
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; THAT HE OPENED MY EYES SO THAT I can
[2:05:50] see.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; That's the reason these mysteries we
[2:05:55] received them.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; We received them because they WERE GIVEN
[2:05:58] TO US TO RECEIVE THEM. HE BLINDED ONE
[2:06:03] AND HE OPENED THE EYES TO the other.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You are the ones he opened his eyes to.
[2:06:12] It is God's amazing grace.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Everybody can't see what you see.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody can't walk like you. Everybody
[2:06:21] can't be you.
[2:06:24] But we're so glad he made us who we are.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him today?
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We love him today.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; We give him praise.
[2:06:35] The Jews couldn't see him, but I can see
[2:06:38] him. And I'm so glad he opened my eyes.
[2:06:42] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[2:06:44] praise and thanksgiving
[2:06:48] for his goodness
[2:06:50] for his mercy.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that I'm standing up here
[2:06:58] talking to y'all.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that some of y'all even
[2:07:02] got a friend.
[2:07:06] IT'S A MYSTERY THAT I HAVE A FRIEND.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IN HIS GRACE AND HIS MERCY
[2:07:11] UNLOCKED A MYSTERY. CLICK.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; You got some people who you you love and
[2:07:17] they love you too.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's a great mystery
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; of our lives. May God bless you richly.
[2:07:28] Let's bow our heads and pray. Amen.
[2:07:32] Musicians come. Lord Jesus, thank you
[2:07:34] for your word today.
[2:07:36] We thank you, Lord, for the mystery
[2:07:41] that Israel was blinded so that I could
[2:07:45] come in.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; You blinded Israel so that Israel, me,
[2:07:50] could come in.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I think of that. That's so
[2:07:55] so humbling to think that you blinded
[2:07:59] your children's eyes
[2:08:01] so that we could come in. This is just
[2:08:03] one of many mysteries that you have
[2:08:07] given to us.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; This mystery is under these seven seals.
[2:08:14] And the enemy wants us to stay away from
[2:08:17] them, criticize us for talking about
[2:08:20] them. But oh God, you've given it to us
[2:08:24] because your grace allowed us to have
[2:08:27] ears to hear and eyes to see. Lord, may
[2:08:32] we receive more, more, more.
[2:08:36] May we dig deeper into the word of life.
[2:08:41] Dig deeper and find more keys to our
[2:08:45] life.
[2:08:47] Find more answers to our life.
[2:08:50] Lord, there's questions that come up in
[2:08:52] this even in this city, even in this
[2:08:55] church, even in our families. Questions
[2:08:58] that come up, Lord.
[2:09:01] Lord, let us not be
[2:09:03] so impatient that we can't wait on you,
[2:09:07] that we can't lay it down at the altar.
[2:09:12] begin to dig deep and deeper and deeper
[2:09:16] until we reach into those channels of
[2:09:18] divine revelation
[2:09:22] that you alone can reveal to us.
[2:09:26] Oh God, we thank you
[2:09:29] for the time tested memorial. You test
[2:09:32] every word before you put it in the
[2:09:34] Bible.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Your prophet told us that
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; you tested every prophet that wrote
[2:09:39] every word.
[2:09:41] You tested THE CHILDREN OF GOD that are
[2:09:44] in the Bible. You test every son, every
[2:09:48] daughter, every material that comes into
[2:09:51] the body of Christ must be tested.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:57] Oh God, your sons are tested. Your
[2:09:59] daughters are tested. The youth are
[2:10:01] tested. The ministry IS TESTED. THE
[2:10:04] OLD-TIMERS ARE TESTED. THE NEWCOMERS are
[2:10:07] tested
[2:10:09] BECAUSE YOU BUILD YOUR KINGDOM WITH REAL
[2:10:12] MATERIAL.
[2:10:13] YOU BUILD YOUR CHURCH WITH a revelation.
[2:10:16] Upon this rock, I'll build my church.
[2:10:19] Oh God, let it be.
[2:10:24] Let it be, Lord. that we would embrace
[2:10:27] that
[2:10:29] and not be critical of it.
[2:10:32] We thank you, Father.
[2:10:34] We ask that your grace and mercy would
[2:10:38] follow each one from the youngest one
[2:10:41] here, some of the young people, the
[2:10:43] newcomers to the oldest one here. Lord,
[2:10:46] may you bless them today. May they
[2:10:49] receive these good things down in their
[2:10:52] soul. We pray in Jesus name.
[2:10:56] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; No greater
[2:11:02] love
[2:11:04] ever know
[2:11:09] Lord.
[2:11:11] Oh Lord
[2:11:14] I love you.
[2:11:17] Lord I love you.
[2:11:20] Lord, I love
[2:11:24] I love you, Lord,
[2:11:27] and I want to serve.
[2:11:30] Amen. Let's all stand to our feet.
[2:11:33] You've been so good.
[2:11:38] So good. So good.
[2:11:46] Every knee all the grace
[2:11:54] gater
[2:11:59] known.
[2:12:01] Oh
[2:12:03] Lord,
[2:12:06] oh Lord,
[2:12:08] I love you.
[2:12:12] Amen. And let's bow our heads.
[2:12:15] I'm going to give you the opportunity to
[2:12:17] respond to the scriptures, to the word
[2:12:19] of God in your heart and in your life.
[2:12:23] The waters are troubled. The word has
[2:12:25] come forth.
[2:12:26] This, my brother, my sisters, is
[2:12:28] probably one of the best
[2:12:32] atmospheres for you to receive more of
[2:12:35] God.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I I would love for you to take advantage
[2:12:39] of that.
[2:12:41] the atmosphere of believers, the songs
[2:12:43] of Zion. It's why we come here. And I
[2:12:47] would ask you even just right at your
[2:12:49] seat there, right in your heart to
[2:12:52] really take advantage of this atmosphere
[2:12:55] to receive a portion of his word and
[2:12:59] opening it up to your heart and into
[2:13:01] your life. If you're a young person, if
[2:13:04] you're older, if whoever you are, he he
[2:13:08] calls you.
[2:13:10] He calls you to his word and he opens it
[2:13:13] up to you. If if you've been a little
[2:13:16] dilitary or a little slack concerning
[2:13:19] some of these promises, if you don't dig
[2:13:22] into them like you should, spend that
[2:13:25] time in prayer, not just praying for
[2:13:27] this or job or praying for that, praying
[2:13:31] actually praying for a deeper
[2:13:34] revelation,
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; amen,
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; of the mysteries to open up in your
[2:13:38] life. the hidden truths from the
[2:13:40] foundation of THE WORLD, BUT NOW ARE
[2:13:43] BEING revealed
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; to his saints. To his saints, they're
[2:13:47] being revealed.
[2:13:49] And if you
[2:13:52] every head bowed, every eye closed and
[2:13:54] you want
[2:13:58] to be included in this prayer to to make
[2:14:01] that move to go deeper in the revelation
[2:14:04] of Jesus Christ
[2:14:07] just as a to break gravity just to as a
[2:14:11] Why don't you lift up your hand to him
[2:14:14] in prayer? God bless all those hands. I
[2:14:17] see some young hands. I see some old
[2:14:19] hands.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; I see some some worried hands.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; I see some hands, Lord, that been
[2:14:28] through.
[2:14:30] But Lord, we need more of you.
[2:14:33] Oh God, take every one of these hands
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; and the hearts beneath that hand, Lord,
[2:14:41] and open up the revelation as you've
[2:14:44] given it to the saints. These are your
[2:14:47] saints.
[2:14:49] May you grant it, Lord. May they receive
[2:14:52] if it's more faith for salvation,
[2:14:56] for their children, for their life, for
[2:15:00] their career,
[2:15:02] for their church, for whatever they're
[2:15:05] going through, Lord, to receive that in
[2:15:08] the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, you take
[2:15:10] every hand, you take every heart, and
[2:15:13] you answer that request in the name of
[2:15:17] Jesus Christ, we pray. We receive it,
[2:15:21] Lord.
[2:15:23] We receive it, Lord. I receive it this
[2:15:26] morning, Lord. Every blessing, every
[2:15:30] promise,
[2:15:32] EVERY TRUTH YOU HAVE FOR ME, LORD, I
[2:15:35] receive it,
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; oh God.
[2:15:39] May you grant it
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name we pray. Thank you Lord.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Oh let's just give him
[2:15:49] praise. Let's just thank him. Thank you
[2:15:51] Lord. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
[2:15:56] Thank you Jesus.
[2:15:58] Amen. Thank you Lord.
[2:16:01] Amen. God bless you. I'll turn this over
[2:16:04] to a song leader tonight. Brother Papiso
[2:16:07] will take the to service and he has a um
[2:16:11] we took an offering there in Mesa. He
[2:16:15] has two main needs there. A couple many
[2:16:18] needs. He's in the rural area.
[2:16:22] And I he never says this. I had to ask
[2:16:25] him. And I asked him about where he
[2:16:26] lives
[2:16:28] and uh you know he just lives in a rural
[2:16:31] place
[2:16:33] and uh he could move to a big city but
[2:16:37] he stays amongst his people. That's
[2:16:38] where God called him and the little
[2:16:41] ministry that he does. He used to put
[2:16:43] brother Brandham on the radio station.
[2:16:45] They doubled or increased that cost. He
[2:16:48] had to take it off and he had a little
[2:16:50] other little PA system to get the word
[2:16:52] out to the people. And so I've known him
[2:16:56] since 20 2022. When was that? Yeah, when
[2:16:59] he first came. And um good brother,
[2:17:03] solid. I love him. So we'll have an
[2:17:06] offering to take up for him tonight if
[2:17:08] you want to bring something to support
[2:17:11] his ministry and the work there. So God
[2:17:13] bless you so much. Amen. We'll turn to
[2:17:15] service. Thank you to me.
[2:17:20] You met my every
[2:17:24] need.
[2:17:26] All the grace you shown.
[2:17:32] No greater
[2:17:35] love I've ever known.
[2:17:40] Oh Lord,
[2:17:46] I love you. Let's tell him that again.
[2:17:52] Oh Lord, I love
[2:17:56] you.
[2:18:00] I want to serve
[2:18:03] you.
[2:18:06] You've been so good to me.
[2:18:13] You met my everything
[2:18:17] need
[2:18:21] all the grace you show.
[2:18:26] No greater
[2:18:28] love
[2:18:29] I've ever known.
[2:18:33] Oh Lord,
[2:18:40] I love you.
[2:18:45] Key after you know the song, open our
[2:18:47] eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus.
[2:18:51] Open our eyes,
[2:18:56] Lord.
[2:19:01] We want to see Jesus

[2:20:10] eyes, Lord.
[2:20:13] Just open
[2:20:16] my eyes,
[2:20:19] Lord.
[2:20:21] I want to see him.
[2:20:23] I want to see Jesus
[2:20:33] just to reach out and touch
[2:20:39] him

[2:23:24] Spirit,
[2:23:26] flow through me. Brother Zach, would you
[2:23:30] come dismiss us in a word of prayer?
[2:23:45] Father God, as we came come here, Lord,
[2:23:48] and receiving your word, Lord, and
[2:23:50] through your servant, Brother Israel Po,
[2:23:53] Lord, we came with open hearts, Lord
[2:23:56] God, and hear you speaking to your bride
[2:24:01] here, Lord, because by your grace, Lord,
[2:24:04] you opened our eyes
[2:24:06] to receive you, Lord, in our hearts that
[2:24:10] we may be refilled with your Holy Ghost,
[2:24:12] Lord, and go in that rapture, Lord, and
[2:24:17] change our bodies, Lord, and one day
[2:24:19] we'll be seeing our grandma knocking on
[2:24:21] our door, Lord. That you would uh show
[2:24:25] them to us, Lord, but we won't be able
[2:24:27] to see them unless we're changed, Lord.
[2:24:29] And I ask you to please continue
[2:24:32] continue to bless us, Lord, throughout
[2:24:34] our day, throughout our week, Lord, that
[2:24:36] we may follow your footsteps, Lord, your
[2:24:40] word. And we everywhere we go, Lord. Let
[2:24:44] our lights shine, Lord. May we may be a
[2:24:49] testimony to others, too, Jesus, as we
[2:24:51] leave this building, Lord God.
[2:24:54] Please Lord
[2:24:57] bless us Lord as we come here in the
[2:24:59] evening service to Jesus. I ask these
[2:25:03] things in Jesus Christ's holy name.
[2:25:05] Amen.
[2:25:07] My hands
[2:25:09] to worship
