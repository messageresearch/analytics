[0:01] ain't nothing out of
[0:03] order it's working just exactly like
[0:05] God's Big Time heat see like a clock
[0:08] moving right around your name was put in
[0:09] there before the foundation of the world
[0:11] when the lamb was SL to redeem what was
[0:13] in that book and now he comes forward
[0:15] and takes that book to claim his
[0:17] Redemption I don't want to get started
[0:19] there we never would answer another
[0:20] question today all right question is
[0:25] hell and the lake that
[0:28] burneth with fire and brimstone the same
[0:33] no hell translation in the Bible I
[0:36] believe now the scholar sitting here
[0:38] want to honor that our brother Iverson
[0:41] sitting here and brother n and many of
[0:43] these Brethren who are really
[0:45] theologians the word
[0:47] translated Haiti means the
[0:50] grave is that right the Greek word for
[0:53] the grave but the Lake of Fire is
[0:55] something else but over in Revelations
[0:58] both Hades and PA was cast into the Lake
[1:01] of Fire all right now let's see if not
[1:07] uh is the Lake of Fire hell Eternal no
[1:11] sir no sir anything that was created is
[1:15] not
[1:16] Eternal now anything's created that's
[1:18] the reason there cannot be an eternal
[1:21] hell if anybody ever tells you that you
[1:23] go to burnning an eternal hell I want
[1:25] the scripture for him there's no such a
[1:27] thing as that hell was cre created for
[1:30] the devil and his angels for the
[1:32] Antichrist and his people that was the
[1:34] devil incarnate devil is created for
[1:37] that to
[1:38] destroy and anything that H anything is
[1:41] only one thing at all out of everything
[1:45] there is the whole world and everything
[1:46] else there's only one thing Eternal and
[1:49] that's
[1:50] God before there was a atom or electrons
[1:54] or before there was even Cosmic like
[1:56] electrons or anything he was God he's a
[1:59] Creator and that's the only way you can
[2:02] be Eternal is to receive eternal life
[2:05] that Greek word there I think is Zoe
[2:07] isn't that right Zoe Zoe and then that
[2:10] that life God imparts to you as the
[2:14] father your father imparts his life to
[2:17] you through the uh the marriage vow with
[2:22] the mother and he by that
[2:25] imparts the the joy of imparting catch
[2:29] me of the imparting life for a son and
[2:33] that's way God does joy in imparting his
[2:37] life to a son see and then you become
[2:42] part of him which is zo God's own life I
[2:45] give to unto them eternal life raise
[2:48] them up the last days that's the only
[2:50] thing that that you got eternal life and
[2:55] that eternal life knows its body and it
[2:58] must have to come come forth that it can
[3:02] it's impossible for it to lay
[3:05] there as the spirit of Christ hovered
[3:08] over the body God's spirit over Christ
[3:12] at that great day it know it would raise
[3:15] up again so is the Saints in their body
[3:18] now remember Jesus when he died he went
[3:22] to hell because he had to go there he
[3:24] was a sin barrier and he preached to the
[3:27] souls that were in hell that repented
[3:29] not in the long suffering the day is
[3:31] Noah that right he went to hell and
[3:35] preached to the souls the separated
[3:38] Souls from God death means separation
[3:41] and they had separated from God never
[3:43] could be back no more and Jesus went to
[3:46] Bear a record that he was the one that
[3:48] was spoke of the the woman's seed the
[3:51] serpent seed see what the serpent seed
[3:53] done Antichrist find up in death
[3:56] separation the red hearts the woman seed
[4:00] life ends up on the white heart Jesus
[4:02] Christ see what is it one against the
[4:06] other serpent seed against a woman's
[4:09] seed amen hallelujah you get it
[4:13] now oh we just stay a little while on

[49:16] the Lord thy God is with thee whether
[49:19] soever thou goth amen one more scripture
[49:24] in Revelations chapter 22
[49:37] Verse
[49:39] 18 Revelations
[49:45] 22:18 for I testify unto every man that
[49:48] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[49:50] this book If any man shall add unto
[49:53] these things God shall add unto him the
[49:57] plagues that are written in this book
[49:59] and if any man shall take away from the
[50:01] words of the book of this prophecy God
[50:04] shall take away his part out of the book
[50:07] of life and out of the holy city and
[50:10] from the things which are written in
[50:13] this book he which testified these
[50:17] things saith surely I come quickly amen
[50:23] even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our
[50:27] Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen
[50:31] let's pray Lord Jesus we ask your
[50:33] blessings on the word that we read here
[50:37] today Father move our thoughts aside to
[50:40] just what you would have us to speak and
[50:43] to hear Lord we commit it in ourselves
[50:47] into your hands now in Jesus name we
[50:49] pray amen God bless you you may be
[50:52] seated amen don't add don't take away is
[50:56] the title of our message this morning
[50:58] don't add don't take away we took this
[51:03] little subject or portion of it a number
[51:05] of different ways here at the church and
[51:08] in Florida it rekindled itself again as
[51:12] I spoke on the message a priest found a
[51:14] book and uh to write it down we went
[51:17] through those scriptures where the Bible
[51:21] God commands us to write down the words
[51:24] of the Lord the Testaments are to be
[51:27] written down the Commandments are to be
[51:30] written down and then after they're
[51:33] written down he seals it with these two
[51:36] disciplines and that's the discipline of
[51:39] not adding to or taking away from it
[51:42] it's in these two disciplines that I
[51:44] believe that a true Minister can find
[51:48] his way in the perfect will of God it is
[51:52] also where the True Believer has to
[51:54] develop this at at itude or the
[51:57] willingness or the courage not to add
[52:01] not to take away just say it the way
[52:03] it's said leave it alone even the parts
[52:08] you don't understand even the Redundant
[52:11] part even the repeats the repeats the
[52:13] repeats and who begot and who begot and
[52:16] who begot keep it all in there because
[52:18] God put it in there for a purpose and in
[52:21] this discipline I believe is where
[52:25] Joshua found his
[52:27] success it was in his commission that
[52:30] you will prosper if you're not just here
[52:34] or remember what Moses said but you take
[52:37] it and don't turn to the left or to the
[52:40] right you stay right with what he said
[52:44] and I'd like to say to you all this uh
[52:47] this morning those of us we follow this
[52:50] great message of the hour we know that
[52:53] this message was ministered by the Ang
[52:56] Angel of the Lord this great angel came
[53:00] also to eleazer when he was trying to
[53:05] find a bride for his master Abraham this
[53:09] Angel also appeared to Moses and told
[53:14] him that I will send my angel in the way
[53:18] to keep you in the way so as we just
[53:21] look at these things at this great
[53:23] message that we're following we would
[53:25] have to say that this great message the
[53:27] message that brother Brandon brought to
[53:29] us he spearheaded not only a Revival of
[53:34] the signs wonders and miracles but he
[53:38] also spearheaded the teachings of the
[53:41] Bible the doctrines the things that we
[53:44] didn't understand and although not a
[53:47] theologian although not a a grammar
[53:49] student although he wouldn't be a scribe
[53:52] or someone that taught Greek or taught
[53:55] Hebrew
[53:57] this is how God has always chosen the
[54:00] ones that to to lead his people so he
[54:03] was a
[54:04] leader he he he he went forth and he
[54:08] raised the church into an atmosphere
[54:11] that we had never seen before uh the
[54:13] Believers had never seen anything like
[54:16] this a 20th century Prophet a messenger
[54:21] that had the signs wonders and miracles
[54:24] that our Bible said would be there we
[54:26] knew they were there biblically but to
[54:28] actually see this take place he went
[54:31] forth with a Ministry and a message as a
[54:34] leader to lead the way not just in the
[54:38] Revival remember that it's not just the
[54:40] Revival but it's the teachings it's the
[54:44] doctrines it's conduct order it's how to
[54:49] on every
[54:51] level somehow as we have moved on in our
[54:55] great wisdom and our great intellect we
[54:58] have
[54:59] forfeited the supernatural in many ways
[55:02] and we've taken the intellectual
[55:05] explanation mere arguing mere my point
[55:10] against your point but God didn't send a
[55:13] theologian to us he sent a Vindicated
[55:15] prophet and I introduced this to the
[55:18] church here about the other translations
[55:20] of the Bible and I wanted to bring that
[55:22] because I know that the sneakiness of
[55:25] Satan is always trying to find a better
[55:29] way than the way that God gave to us and
[55:33] you got to watch them because how can we
[55:36] receive more Revelation brother Israel
[55:38] you might ask how can we receive more
[55:41] Revelation but not add to the word we'll
[55:44] get into that in just a little bit it's
[55:46] because we're not adding anything new
[55:49] but what's already been written is now
[55:52] being
[55:53] revealed it's the words of the Lord it's
[55:56] the Mysteries that were already there
[55:59] that had to be uncovered and revealed
[56:01] that's a big difference than me coming
[56:03] up with some kind of idea oh let me see
[56:06] how this sounds let me throw this out
[56:07] there let me see what maybe this could
[56:09] be or maybe that could be some new idea
[56:12] that's not what we're talking about
[56:14] we're talking about taking the same
[56:15] Bible that everybody had and then
[56:18] raising it to a level like nobody else
[56:21] seen before that's what the prophet did
[56:23] in our last day and we follow that with
[56:26] all of our heart brother bam lays this
[56:29] discipline of not adding to or not
[56:31] taking away from the scriptures tell us
[56:34] not to do it and we want to always
[56:36] remain there so with that thought could
[56:39] we not say that every trouble every
[56:43] problem every issue that we see going on
[56:46] today is because this discipline was
[56:50] violated
[56:51] somewhere somebody added something
[56:54] somebody took something away it's very
[56:57] very simple Saints but it's the reality
[56:59] and that's what keeps and gives it its
[57:01] power every denomination was formed with
[57:06] the pretense of somebody trying to do it
[57:10] better trying to improve on what God had
[57:14] sent and so it always you know God sends
[57:17] a move and within that move you have
[57:19] intelligent people people who think
[57:22] people who study people who handle the
[57:24] word and around that group have these
[57:26] little ideas they always come up they
[57:29] come up within me they come up within
[57:31] you let's be
[57:33] honest and we have an idea about some or
[57:36] could it be or maybe it was or should it
[57:38] be or this is a better way but then you
[57:40] still have to bring it back to this
[57:42] discipline of not adding to it and not
[57:45] taking away from it um brother brandham
[57:49] takes the message God is uh interpreted
[57:54] in his word I think that's the title of
[57:56] it God is known by his own
[57:58] interpretation I'll get it for you in
[58:00] just a minute but in that message he he
[58:02] lays to us three must when handling
[58:07] God's word let me get it to you right
[58:09] now let me see if I can find it here
[58:13] quickly as he brings this to us three
[58:17] must when handling God's
[58:23] word are you interested in that that
[58:27] Christ is
[58:29] revealed in his own
[58:32] word that's the
[58:38] title I'm
[58:40] sorry is that right thank you yes I'm
[58:45] always asking somebody to help me preach
[58:46] and I need all the help I can get all
[58:54] right per 72 thank you thank you so much
[58:59] CU I got it we'll take it right here if
[59:01] the sister has it thank you now in order
[59:04] to study the scripture now this is not
[59:06] just preachers this is
[59:08] everybody because the Bible tells us all
[59:11] to study to uh to study the word of God
[59:15] this is how you memorize it this is how
[59:16] you know your place this is how you
[59:19] build faith is by studying the word now
[59:21] in order to study the scripture Paul
[59:23] told Timothy study it rightly dividing
[59:27] the word of God which is truth them is
[59:30] three them is three musts in the
[59:32] scripture and using God's word there's
[59:35] three things that you must not do now
[59:38] let's study those for the next 10
[59:40] minutes three things that you must not
[59:43] do and all out in the land wherever you
[59:46] are Across the Nation be sure to put
[59:49] these down in your mind if you haven't
[59:53] got a pencil you must must not do these
[59:58] things well we tell you all the time how
[1:00:01] you must do now I'm going to tell you
[1:00:03] what you must not do so did Brother Adam
[1:00:07] tell us to put this in our mind he tell
[1:00:09] us to write it down if you got a pencil
[1:00:11] well he just talking to somebody no he's
[1:00:13] talking to
[1:00:14] me write it down remember this I need
[1:00:18] this as a
[1:00:20] minister I need this as a Christian you
[1:00:23] need it too every church needs needs
[1:00:26] this it's a discipline that he's given
[1:00:29] to us now you must not misinterpret the
[1:00:34] word you say well I believe it means
[1:00:36] this it means just what it says it needs
[1:00:40] no interpreter you must not misplace the
[1:00:44] word and you must not dislocate the word
[1:00:50] and if we would do either of these it
[1:00:53] throws the whole
[1:00:56] Bible in a confusion and in a chaos so
[1:01:00] the violation of any of these three
[1:01:03] throws the entire Bible into a
[1:01:07] confusion into a chaos what's the
[1:01:11] misinterpret it means to interpret it
[1:01:15] wrongly was it it mean to misplace to
[1:01:18] put it in the wrong place to put the
[1:01:20] wrong scripture in the wrong place and
[1:01:23] um what does it mean to dislocate shake
[1:01:26] it means to um disturb the normal
[1:01:29] Arrangement or mess up the original
[1:01:33] position move it from its proper place
[1:01:37] you disrupt you disturb you're take
[1:01:40] you're taking it out of the pattern it's
[1:01:42] like a dislocated shoulder your shoulder
[1:01:45] is there but it's
[1:01:47] dislocated it's not the joint it's not
[1:01:49] where it's supposed to be and this is
[1:01:51] what we must not do with the scriptures
[1:01:54] not just the script
[1:01:56] somebody we must not do this with the
[1:01:58] tapes with the Visions with the
[1:02:02] quotations even General commands that
[1:02:05] the Lord would give
[1:02:06] you cuz there are some things that the
[1:02:09] Lord reveals to you as a father and a
[1:02:13] mother and as a Christian the Lord will
[1:02:16] reveal to you things to do and to not to
[1:02:19] do concerning your career concerning
[1:02:22] daily life concerning concerning just B
[1:02:25] basic instruction that's what prayer is
[1:02:27] all about God is speaking to you he's
[1:02:31] leading you by his spirit and when he's
[1:02:34] leading you he speaks to you through
[1:02:37] this leading of the Holy Spirit and
[1:02:39] that's not just you know that's just not
[1:02:42] cheap words that's not secondary words
[1:02:45] that's the word of the Lord to you if it
[1:02:48] indeed is the Lord speaking to you
[1:02:52] sometimes we think we think of adding or
[1:02:54] taking away we think think of the Bible
[1:02:57] or we think of the message but let's go
[1:02:59] a little bit further and think of what
[1:03:02] instructions did the Lord give to you as
[1:03:04] a Believer as a mother as a
[1:03:08] father first of all how many you know
[1:03:10] what I'm talking about how many have
[1:03:13] these personal
[1:03:16] Inspirations personal
[1:03:19] dialogues things that God speaks to you
[1:03:22] maybe others can do this but not you you
[1:03:25] can't go there and you can't dress like
[1:03:28] that and you can't wear that like that
[1:03:31] God has to give every one of us has
[1:03:33] those little special places it's not
[1:03:35] something I would come up here and
[1:03:36] preach per se it's not notes I would
[1:03:38] burden that I'll put on someone else but
[1:03:41] everyone of us have it's a personal
[1:03:44] relationship with the Lord Jesus amen
[1:03:48] and we got to be true to that and we got
[1:03:50] to hold that very dear and we got not to
[1:03:54] add to that or take away away from that
[1:03:56] as well and so you put it in the wrong
[1:04:00] place you dislocate it you misinterpret
[1:04:05] it or you misplace it some of those some
[1:04:10] of those things we can see have been uh
[1:04:13] uh
[1:04:14] improperly uh handled this is why we
[1:04:16] have so many different
[1:04:18] interpretations of the visions of the
[1:04:21] message different versions of the
[1:04:24] message as we would call it would have
[1:04:26] to say that somebody violated this
[1:04:28] discipline of don't adding and don't
[1:04:31] take away let's take a few scriptures
[1:04:33] for you just for a
[1:04:35] moment just to bring the Bible into what
[1:04:39] what the Bible says about this we read
[1:04:42] it in Revelations chapter
[1:04:46] 22 and um there's just a few scriptures
[1:04:50] we read for you many times and we'll
[1:04:52] read them for you again actually we'll
[1:04:54] be reading them for the rest of our
[1:04:57] life in the Scripture it tells
[1:05:01] us
[1:05:04] that what things soever I command you
[1:05:09] this is Deuteronomy
[1:05:11] 12:32 what things soever I command you
[1:05:14] observe to do it thou sht not add there
[1:05:18] unto nor diminish from
[1:05:22] it Jeremiah 261 1 through3 verse two
[1:05:27] says thus sayeth the Lord stand in the
[1:05:30] court of the Lord's House speak unto all
[1:05:33] the cities of Judah which Come To
[1:05:35] Worship in the Lord's House all the
[1:05:37] words that I command thee to speak unto
[1:05:40] them diminish not a
[1:05:44] word if so be they will hearken and turn
[1:05:48] every man from his evil way that I may
[1:05:50] repent me of the evil which I purpos to
[1:05:54] do unto them because of the evil of
[1:05:55] their doings Deuteronomy 4: 1-3 hearken
[1:06:01] o Israel unto the statutes unto the
[1:06:03] judgments which I teach you for to do
[1:06:06] them that you may live and go in and
[1:06:08] possess the land which the Lord God of
[1:06:11] your fathers giveth you you shall not
[1:06:14] add unto the word which I command you
[1:06:17] neither shall you diminish off from it
[1:06:19] that ye may keep the Commandments of the
[1:06:22] Lord your God which I command you your
[1:06:27] eyes have seen what the Lord has done
[1:06:30] and but and and the scripture goes on
[1:06:33] many scriptures go on and on Deuteronomy
[1:06:37] 30 2 Kings chapter 23 Romans 2 11
[1:06:42] there's no respect of persons with God
[1:06:44] all of these scriptures are laying in
[1:06:46] there and the Commandment is not to add
[1:06:49] to the word nor diminish a from the word
[1:06:53] because when we do that we take away the
[1:06:56] power when we add to it when we take
[1:07:00] away from it it's like you know the good
[1:07:02] part we seem to embrace that we have no
[1:07:06] problem talking to people about heaven
[1:07:09] and about the lovely butterflies and the
[1:07:11] beautiful flowers and the wonderful
[1:07:15] fragrances that will accompany heaven
[1:07:17] but we don't want to talk about the
[1:07:18] Judgment but hell is just as real as
[1:07:23] Heaven is and that is a a truth that was
[1:07:26] spoken out of the word and it was spoken
[1:07:30] in the word not so that we can diminish
[1:07:32] from speaking about it it's in the word
[1:07:35] so we can talk about it and there's in
[1:07:38] there for a
[1:07:39] purpose even if that word is a word even
[1:07:42] against us we have to say what the word
[1:07:46] says uh even about us and that is that
[1:07:51] is the beauty of it that is the you know
[1:07:54] we are we been harnessed with that we
[1:07:58] can't just come up and preach our family
[1:08:03] version we can't come up and preach
[1:08:06] something that's going to benefit us
[1:08:08] only slanted for our own personal game
[1:08:13] but a true witness man or woman will
[1:08:17] stay with the word if it hurts if it
[1:08:21] kills if it separates if it causes more
[1:08:25] to grow if it causes some to leave a
[1:08:29] True Believer will stay with the word
[1:08:33] they'll stay with that word because that
[1:08:35] word is God's word and not only is it
[1:08:37] God's word we are commanded to do so
[1:08:42] amen amen somebody so I don't have a
[1:08:45] version of the message to preach there's
[1:08:48] only one version there's many different
[1:08:52] churches that follow it but Heaven only
[1:08:54] said one version of Malachi 4 and that's
[1:08:58] the version I want to be a part of the
[1:09:02] version that came down from heaven the
[1:09:05] version that had the pillar of fire over
[1:09:07] it the version that fulfilled the Seven
[1:09:10] Seals the book of redemption amen
[1:09:15] amen so we see this these disciplines
[1:09:20] there's two characters in the Bible that
[1:09:25] by dilated this more than that but I'll
[1:09:27] take these two and one of them was King
[1:09:32] Saul in 1st Samuel chapter
[1:09:35] 15 how many remember the
[1:09:38] story where Samuel comes to Saul in in
[1:09:43] in Kings chapter 15 maybe we can turn
[1:09:46] there
[1:09:52] quickly now this isn't a commandment
[1:09:55] like scriptures this wasn't Doctrine for
[1:09:59] Israel this was Specific Instructions to
[1:10:02] a King from a prophet to a King on how
[1:10:05] to handle the
[1:10:08] amalekites and he had a reason for it
[1:10:11] God
[1:10:12] did and he sent this King down there to
[1:10:16] do his
[1:10:19] bidding
[1:10:21] amen and he had Specific Instructions
[1:10:26] you know what's beautiful about the word
[1:10:28] when the Lord gives it to you he he has
[1:10:31] it written down and then it's made
[1:10:34] plain so that he that readeth may run as
[1:10:39] habca 2 says so that we could know
[1:10:43] exactly what the word of the Lord is
[1:10:47] telling
[1:10:49] us you all have the scripture there
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:58] oh yes they're going to make me ask
[1:11:00] twice three times four
[1:11:03] times all right let's see home sweet
[1:11:09] home praise the Lord okay now what was
[1:11:13] the scripture I called 2
[1:11:15] Samuel 1 Samuel yes
[1:11:21] listening First Kings
[1:11:29] say it out loud
[1:11:31] somebody all
[1:11:35] right let me get my Bible
[1:11:46] out I believe I call 1 Samuel is what I
[1:11:50] called yes chapter 15 quickly
[1:12:01] Samuel said unto Saul the Lord sent me
[1:12:04] to anoint thee to be king over his
[1:12:06] people now therefore hearken thou unto
[1:12:09] the voice of the words of the Lord thus
[1:12:13] sayth the Lord of hosts I remember that
[1:12:16] which amalik did to Israel as he laid
[1:12:19] weit for him in the way when he came up
[1:12:22] from Egypt now go and smite amalec and
[1:12:26] utterly destroy all that they have spare
[1:12:31] them not but slay both man woman infant
[1:12:35] suckling ox and sheep camel and ass and
[1:12:41] Saul gathered the people together number
[1:12:44] them and the scripture goes on to say
[1:12:47] that they go down and they take this
[1:12:49] great battle verse number eight and he
[1:12:52] took AAG the king of the amalaki alive
[1:12:55] and utterly destroyed all the people
[1:12:57] with the edge of the sword but Saul and
[1:13:00] the people spared AAG and the best of
[1:13:03] the sheep and of the oxin and of the
[1:13:07] Felines and the Lambs and that was good
[1:13:10] and would not utterly destroy them but
[1:13:13] everything that was vile and refused
[1:13:16] that they destroyed
[1:13:19] utterly so we know the rest of the story
[1:13:23] here there's clear instructions the Lord
[1:13:24] said said to go do it this way and Saul
[1:13:29] with his uh better idea the people came
[1:13:32] up to him and they influenced his
[1:13:35] decision to keep the best cattle I mean
[1:13:39] it's just a cow it's just we can use it
[1:13:41] for sacrifice and he spared the king and
[1:13:44] he kept the things that were more
[1:13:47] convenient the good things that they can
[1:13:49] use later on in worship to the Lord you
[1:13:52] know the Lord didn't like that in fact
[1:13:54] the Lord called did Evil it was evil
[1:13:58] what King Saul did because the Lord had
[1:14:01] gave him clear instructions and here he
[1:14:04] took away this one part of the
[1:14:07] instructions and look at the look at the
[1:14:10] downfall of his life look at the
[1:14:12] downfall of his ministry at this point
[1:14:16] the Lord it was repented that he even
[1:14:19] made Saul to be king it turned his heart
[1:14:22] that he would he would even do such a
[1:14:24] thing and he says well well I I've uh
[1:14:27] I've kept this for sacrifice to you Lord
[1:14:30] and the Lord said it's better to
[1:14:34] obey it's better to obey no matter what
[1:14:38] it costs no matter what the loss no
[1:14:40] matter what you gain what matter what
[1:14:42] you're not going to get it's better to
[1:14:45] obey because the Lord has it all figured
[1:14:48] out anyways and has a purpose on why he
[1:14:53] set the word in their the way he did the
[1:14:56] instructions for a
[1:14:59] minister a father a mother a deacon or
[1:15:03] things how to handle things we think we
[1:15:06] uh can evolve in our understanding or
[1:15:10] evolve in how to handle the different
[1:15:13] pressures and the different challenges
[1:15:15] of the day but the word of the Lord is
[1:15:18] still true and it's got the answer to
[1:15:20] every problem so we could say that every
[1:15:24] problem
[1:15:25] every
[1:15:27] situation that we would see that has
[1:15:29] gone off of the beaten path it's because
[1:15:34] they have violated and not keeping every
[1:15:38] word or they have taken away from the
[1:15:40] word how would you take away from the
[1:15:43] word you could take away from the word
[1:15:45] by not preaching it the way it was given
[1:15:48] to us let's take the example of the Holy
[1:15:52] Ghost and the need for it or the gifts
[1:15:55] of the spirit I don't know anyone that's
[1:15:57] going to get up and say that you know
[1:15:58] they don't believe the gift anybody in
[1:16:00] the message they don't believe the gifts
[1:16:02] are true they will say they're true
[1:16:05] because the Bible says it the message
[1:16:07] says
[1:16:08] it but will they will they take the
[1:16:11] stand for the
[1:16:13] gifts and actually say that they exist
[1:16:17] and we should have them in every local
[1:16:19] assembly and actually we we need them in
[1:16:21] every local assembly you know that's a
[1:16:23] you know that that that that requires a
[1:16:25] lot of energy and it's a it's a it's a
[1:16:28] no man's land for some of us but the
[1:16:31] word of the Lord is still true if you
[1:16:33] are listening to the tapes that's what
[1:16:36] the way the tapes bring it just exactly
[1:16:40] that way and that's the way we want to
[1:16:42] find it we don't want to gradually find
[1:16:46] ourselves doing things that is not in
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:50] message and we've seen that in many many
[1:16:54] uh times in our own life and many many
[1:16:57] uh assemblies uh today and so this this
[1:17:02] great uh King King Saul was the first
[1:17:05] king but he was replaced by King David
[1:17:08] he makes this eror of just adding this
[1:17:11] one little detail or just maybe
[1:17:14] adjusting this commandment I mean slay
[1:17:17] everything I mean he kept the king alive
[1:17:20] slay everything that was the
[1:17:22] command so it takes a discipline
[1:17:25] it takes a man who really obeys the Lord
[1:17:29] to look past what everybody said or the
[1:17:32] feelings of this one or know the little
[1:17:34] bitty baby they're so cute and we can
[1:17:36] reform them and we can make slaves out
[1:17:39] of them or we can use this later that
[1:17:41] wasn't the
[1:17:42] command maybe if he told me to do it
[1:17:45] that way we would do it that way but
[1:17:47] that's not what he said to do he said
[1:17:50] utterly destroy don't bring nothing back
[1:17:53] don't give you know Victory coming back
[1:17:55] look what I found look what I got don't
[1:17:57] bring nothing back that was a
[1:18:01] command and look at what Saul
[1:18:05] lost think about this how would this man
[1:18:09] love to get that back from that day
[1:18:11] forth the prophet stopped visiting him
[1:18:15] the anointing left him his kingdom was
[1:18:19] torn away from him and God stopped
[1:18:22] speaking to him in an evil spirit
[1:18:24] started to torment this man a man who
[1:18:27] felt the anointing before a man who was
[1:18:29] a true Israelite a man who was found out
[1:18:32] to be the King King Saul and he loses it
[1:18:37] all over this one little
[1:18:40] violation lost his
[1:18:43] ministry the anointing left
[1:18:47] him oh my and an evil spirit started to
[1:18:51] torment him I'll say this
[1:18:55] there's a reason for
[1:18:57] everything and things don't happen just
[1:19:00] for nothing there's a reason why we have
[1:19:04] to go through what we go through there's
[1:19:06] a reason why we're blessed the way we're
[1:19:08] blessed there's a reason why we have
[1:19:10] what we have or we don't have what we
[1:19:12] don't have there's a
[1:19:15] reason and if we get back to the word
[1:19:17] we'll find out what the reason is
[1:19:21] amen have
[1:19:23] I had it somewhere have I taken away
[1:19:26] somewhere oh Lord please help me let's
[1:19:30] take one more example our
[1:19:32] good Noble prophet and brother brother
[1:19:36] Moses in Numbers Chapter
[1:19:38] 20 you remember
[1:19:40] Moses that great prophet that the Lord
[1:19:44] called him to be the god to Israel and
[1:19:49] pulled him out of Egypt never seen a man
[1:19:52] like him before never never seen a
[1:19:55] Ministry like him before God just Rose
[1:19:58] him up or raised him up however you say
[1:20:01] it God just brought him out of nowhere
[1:20:04] seemingly what's his name
[1:20:07] Moses the deliverer he got so called up
[1:20:10] with these people that the Lord wanted
[1:20:13] to destroy the people and start over
[1:20:16] with Moses Moses throws himself in the
[1:20:19] breach in the gap for the people and the
[1:20:22] Lord stays his wrath because of Moses
[1:20:27] there's no man like Moses he spoke in
[1:20:29] the similitude between God God he saw
[1:20:32] God face he saw him he spoke to him lip
[1:20:36] to ear like a friend what a
[1:20:40] relationship but even this man Moses he
[1:20:43] comes to the Rock and the people
[1:20:45] pressured him and the pressure was great
[1:20:48] and they cried for water and he smoked
[1:20:50] the rock a second time and then the the
[1:20:54] Lord bypassed Moses correcting him no
[1:20:59] the Lord held that he says come here
[1:21:01] Moses come here it brought forth the
[1:21:03] water I'm going to honor your gift you
[1:21:05] smot it you asked for I'm going to give
[1:21:07] it to you but you magnified
[1:21:09] yourself in front of the people and
[1:21:12] therefore you cannot go into the land
[1:21:15] but Lord they made me do lord they're
[1:21:17] pressured Lord I've been through so much
[1:21:19] I look like a old man following after
[1:21:21] these people they tried to Stone me I
[1:21:23] saved their life
[1:21:25] but
[1:21:26] no I never told you to Smite that rock
[1:21:32] twice pressure huh happens to Great Men
[1:21:35] doesn't it can it happen to
[1:21:39] you has it happened to
[1:21:41] you yes it happens to us but I'm so glad
[1:21:45] for the grace of God for the blood
[1:21:49] that's still on the throne to atone for
[1:21:52] my ignorance I really don't want to ask
[1:21:54] had nothing Lord I really don't want to
[1:21:57] take away nothing Lord I want to say it
[1:22:01] the way you said
[1:22:03] it that might seem or appear a bit
[1:22:07] boring that might be like we heard that
[1:22:09] already but this is this is the reason
[1:22:11] why we have the problems that we have
[1:22:13] today you have to bring it back because
[1:22:16] this is this is what caused everything
[1:22:19] from the Garden of Eden remember the
[1:22:22] serpent came to Eve and and all he did
[1:22:25] he didn't add a whole paragraph he just
[1:22:28] took one
[1:22:30] word and he tweaked one word and added
[1:22:33] one word to it and it caused all the all
[1:22:36] of the fall and all the problems that we
[1:22:38] have today what about us today you know
[1:22:42] there's a scripture Our Believers in
[1:22:44] Jeremiah where the Lord asks why is not
[1:22:48] my people healed there is bomb in Gilead
[1:22:53] then why are my people not healed he'll
[1:22:57] ask that question brother bam takes a
[1:23:00] message and he preaches the message the
[1:23:02] way back he's preaching to the
[1:23:05] Pentecostals and he's talking about how
[1:23:07] they got off the beaten path through
[1:23:11] denominationalism they begin to argue
[1:23:13] and the fuss and to break away
[1:23:17] fellowship and you know that's what they
[1:23:19] did there but we have done that here
[1:23:21] today I've seen that done here today in
[1:23:24] our day in our message like the only
[1:23:28] ones guilty of that were the
[1:23:31] denominational huh but it's still a word
[1:23:34] of the
[1:23:35] Lord God never called us to
[1:23:38] denominate he called us to follow his
[1:23:41] instructions that he already laid out
[1:23:44] there and in those instructions there's
[1:23:47] things I don't understand but there's a
[1:23:49] revelation that he can give me of what
[1:23:51] his word says not adding anything new
[1:23:55] but revealing what is already there amen
[1:24:00] somebody praise the
[1:24:03] Lord
[1:24:07] now these different groups and
[1:24:09] Ministries that are there
[1:24:12] today they've come
[1:24:14] up they've added they've taken away
[1:24:17] brother bandam dealt with it he talked
[1:24:19] about
[1:24:21] how those ones in Arizona icing the
[1:24:26] tapes trying to make it say something
[1:24:28] that it does not
[1:24:32] say and that is easily done of course we
[1:24:36] wouldn't splice a tape
[1:24:37] today some people don't even know what
[1:24:39] that
[1:24:40] means but we will take part of the quote
[1:24:43] or part of the scripture or part of the
[1:24:46] truth and then the other part we won't
[1:24:48] preach about it or teach about it you
[1:24:51] know because someone might label us or
[1:24:53] tag us you know some kind of fanatic or
[1:24:57] something but you know we don't have a
[1:24:59] word to bring to
[1:25:02] nobody all we have is a word to follow
[1:25:05] what was brought to
[1:25:06] us and I am not trying to save my name
[1:25:10] in my
[1:25:11] reputation H uh because of what I stand
[1:25:14] on the word I'm trying to take a stand
[1:25:16] in the word I'm trying to build my
[1:25:19] reputation with my heavenly father and
[1:25:22] that reputation is built by me standing
[1:25:25] on his
[1:25:26] word even in a hostile
[1:25:29] environment even when they don't
[1:25:31] understand what you're
[1:25:33] saying even though they can't see or
[1:25:36] understand I want to be faithful and
[1:25:38] stand on his word yet the
[1:25:41] same amen amen amen amen let's take a
[1:25:45] few quotations
[1:25:47] here in the message wisdom works as
[1:25:51] Faith
[1:25:52] ex Express
[1:25:55] the prophet of God says this 1965
[1:25:58] November 26 he says I don't care Judas
[1:26:01] could have done all kind of signs and
[1:26:03] wonders but when he come when he come to
[1:26:06] receive the holy ghost at the day of
[1:26:08] Pentecost he showed his colors that
[1:26:11] devil can come right up and impersonate
[1:26:14] right to the very thing till it comes to
[1:26:17] this word but he can't take all that
[1:26:22] word he can bring bring it all up maybe
[1:26:25] to one word like Eve did the devil did
[1:26:28] to Eve but he can't cross it all because
[1:26:32] the only the whole thing is the body of
[1:26:35] Christ see word now neither they could
[1:26:39] not cannot take the message now neither
[1:26:42] could Janice and jambers take Moses's
[1:26:44] message they could not do it their works
[1:26:47] of impersonation was made known because
[1:26:49] they they could not be able to follow
[1:26:51] God's word Vindicated by his anointing
[1:26:54] OED
[1:26:56] Prophet the message wisdom versus Faith
[1:26:59] paragraph 184 he says this wait just a
[1:27:02] moment we'll get back to the seat again
[1:27:05] what was it the devil tried to do with
[1:27:09] wisdom make God's word say something
[1:27:12] that it didn't say that's right he tried
[1:27:15] to make God's word say something that it
[1:27:19] didn't say so that's the way it comes
[1:27:21] today when they try to make God's word
[1:27:24] say something that it doesn't
[1:27:28] say continues on in that same message in
[1:27:31] paragraph 197 and he says this here
[1:27:35] wisdom as Satan was presenting to her
[1:27:39] said You shall not surely die see it's
[1:27:42] trying to make the word say something
[1:27:45] that it isn't
[1:27:47] so that's what wisdom is today oh
[1:27:51] brother how do we t on that seminary
[1:27:54] schools of
[1:27:56] theology that's their nest that's their
[1:27:59] Grassroots is trying to make God's word
[1:28:02] say something that it doesn't
[1:28:06] say that's what they try to do as I was
[1:28:08] talking about the different
[1:28:09] interpretations of the Bible how there's
[1:28:12] many of them and I know that there's
[1:28:14] some beautiful you know commentaries and
[1:28:18] ways to comprehensively understand the
[1:28:21] word different interpretations and
[1:28:23] brother random used the Greek diet loock
[1:28:25] and he talked about the ls of Bible and
[1:28:28] other translations all those things are
[1:28:30] great all those things are good but what
[1:28:33] did he use to bring the word he used the
[1:28:37] old King James version of the
[1:28:39] Bible and I would I would re strongly
[1:28:42] resist anyone that would want to change
[1:28:46] that
[1:28:47] discipline because there's a reason for
[1:28:49] it if the ESV or the NIV or whatever
[1:28:54] version Bible was the more accurate and
[1:28:56] correct one that we should use and the
[1:28:59] message of Malachi 4 was to restore all
[1:29:02] things don't you think he would tell us
[1:29:06] that so if he didn't tell us that who
[1:29:09] told us that these other virgins were
[1:29:13] the ones that we should
[1:29:15] take please understand I'm not against
[1:29:18] them I use them all the time everybody
[1:29:20] understand that I I listen to them I
[1:29:22] listen to other people preach I listen
[1:29:25] to commentary I listen to you know
[1:29:27] scientists of the day I listen to
[1:29:29] debates all the time I love hearing
[1:29:32] other people I I talk and listen and all
[1:29:35] those things when it comes to my soul
[1:29:37] and studying the word and preparing
[1:29:38] something to bring to the church it's
[1:29:40] got to be out of Malachi 4 it's got to
[1:29:43] be the way the prophet brought it why
[1:29:45] because Satan is too crafty and too
[1:29:48] slick and he's not done interpreting the
[1:29:51] scriptures there'll be another version
[1:29:54] of the
[1:29:55] Bible better than the King James quote
[1:29:59] unquote so what did God use he uses he
[1:30:03] uses the
[1:30:04] prophetic channel to bring not only the
[1:30:08] Visions Supernatural but the teachings
[1:30:11] and the doctrine we read it for you many
[1:30:13] times where brother random says that the
[1:30:15] angel of the Lord taught him these
[1:30:19] things in the
[1:30:21] scripture amen so that's what we're
[1:30:23] following
[1:30:24] and so we want to highlight we want to
[1:30:27] keep that you know uh uh um assurity in
[1:30:31] your
[1:30:32] mind um we believe in fellowship with
[1:30:35] others we believe that there's salvation
[1:30:37] in Jesus Christ and him alone that can
[1:30:40] be in any church any assembly anywhere
[1:30:43] and we should should welcome that we
[1:30:45] shouldn't be so hard against other
[1:30:48] people that are following their Bible or
[1:30:49] trying to live for God we should embrace
[1:30:52] that amen
[1:30:55] but what we've done is we've made the
[1:30:57] message another denominations some have
[1:31:00] have made their understanding of the
[1:31:01] message like another
[1:31:03] denomination and brother Bram didn't do
[1:31:07] that and so it takes uh that discipline
[1:31:11] to stay with with the way he brought it
[1:31:13] the way he said it and because that was
[1:31:16] the
[1:31:17] prophetic inspiration on how to handle
[1:31:21] the word amen the there's some great
[1:31:24] smart men out there today that can get
[1:31:27] the history and break down the Greek and
[1:31:30] the Hebrew and we applaud that it's
[1:31:32] beautiful we use it we wouldn't have a
[1:31:35] Bible today without it please understand
[1:31:38] the doctors of divinity and these great
[1:31:41] men that find no no the finding of the
[1:31:43] the Deep Sea Scrolls and adding and and
[1:31:46] the Beautiful things that are brought to
[1:31:48] the Christian faith and Christian
[1:31:50] Heritage we don't we don't discount any
[1:31:53] of that but God sent us the message of
[1:31:56] Malachi 4 and that's what we're supposed
[1:31:59] to stay with so in a 100 years from
[1:32:03] today our church should replicate what's
[1:32:07] on them tapes and what's in the Bible
[1:32:09] amen not be something different look how
[1:32:11] they've changed look how the worship has
[1:32:13] changed in the
[1:32:15] denomination the worship in the
[1:32:17] denomination has come more like a club
[1:32:20] party
[1:32:21] atmosphere and they've got some kind of
[1:32:23] worship band leader and it's rock and
[1:32:26] roll ver you know slash Christianity but
[1:32:30] it's really rock and roll if you take if
[1:32:32] you take all the names out and if you
[1:32:33] take it you take all the titles of what
[1:32:35] it is it sounds like rock and roll is
[1:32:38] that the Christian
[1:32:39] Church am I supposed to come to church
[1:32:41] and wonder is this a rock and roll song
[1:32:43] or am I supposed to worship with this
[1:32:46] huh but that's what the denominations
[1:32:48] that's come to and if we follow their
[1:32:51] pattern that's what we come to
[1:32:54] but I'm so glad God didn't call me to
[1:32:56] follow no denomination he called me out
[1:32:58] of
[1:32:59] that they don't have nothing to bring to
[1:33:02] me for my soul God sent Elijah the
[1:33:07] prophet yes gifts talents or without
[1:33:10] repentance and we thank God for that but
[1:33:12] the leadership on how to conduct worship
[1:33:15] has to come out of this word
[1:33:17] here amen
[1:33:20] somebody yes because Satan is very
[1:33:24] crafty he tries to make it say something
[1:33:27] the word says something that it doesn't
[1:33:29] say so he he has to get his way in there
[1:33:32] some kind of way and he can't get in
[1:33:34] here with just straight up craziness
[1:33:37] he's got to have some language have
[1:33:40] something similar look close to what
[1:33:43] we're doing and then we drop our guards
[1:33:46] down and then he drops a seed of
[1:33:49] intellect in there the brother randam is
[1:33:52] dealing with this in the message
[1:33:54] um the Antichrist this are questions and
[1:33:56] answers 1964 and this is this is very
[1:34:00] interesting how he's talking about the
[1:34:01] Beatles and what they did and he takes
[1:34:03] his time to read an article from their
[1:34:06] manager let me see if I can find it here
[1:34:07] real quick I didn't give it to the
[1:34:10] sister in the back I just gave her
[1:34:12] paragraph number nine questions and
[1:34:15] answers number 64 he says it's so filthy
[1:34:17] and dirty and Antichrist you see it's
[1:34:20] Satan on a mock campaign see he does
[1:34:24] anything that Christ can do but he can't
[1:34:27] confirm the word see he'll take part of
[1:34:31] it here but he can't take it all
[1:34:34] together see he can't get it together so
[1:34:37] you see no wonder the Bible said that
[1:34:40] would almost fool the very elected if it
[1:34:42] was possible the Antichrist spirit that
[1:34:46] was in questions and answers number two
[1:34:49] 1964 almost fool the very elected if it
[1:34:51] was possible the Antichrist he says even
[1:34:55] their own press manager so he's talking
[1:34:57] about the Beatles
[1:34:59] here and how these
[1:35:06] beetles I thought I put it in
[1:35:15] here their own manager was quoting from
[1:35:18] them
[1:35:24] and brother bandam reads the whole
[1:35:26] statement how
[1:35:29] they it's incredible absolutely
[1:35:31] incredible says Derek Taylor The Beatles
[1:35:34] press officer here are these four boys
[1:35:37] from Liverpool they're rude they're
[1:35:41] profane they're vulgar and they've taken
[1:35:44] over the world it's as if they've
[1:35:47] founded a new religion they're
[1:35:50] completely Antichrist I mean
[1:35:55] I'm Antichrist as well but they are so
[1:35:58] Antichrist they shock
[1:36:01] me which isn't an easy thing but I'm
[1:36:05] obsessed with them isn't everybody
[1:36:09] that's on the tape sister I think she's
[1:36:11] trying to find it brother Bam's actually
[1:36:12] reading that on the tape this is the
[1:36:15] Beatles press manager he says I'm
[1:36:17] Antichrist but they're more Antichrist
[1:36:20] and they shock me he says I am upset
[1:36:24] with them and then and then with that
[1:36:28] anointing there were actually he people
[1:36:30] were being healed following these
[1:36:35] Beatles so if you don't have the
[1:36:37] discipline of staying with the word
[1:36:39] you'll think well and you'll change your
[1:36:41] tune but there when you know what the
[1:36:43] word says about it you know how to place
[1:36:45] it it doesn't move you one bit somebody
[1:36:50] with the
[1:36:51] anointing and and the impressiveness to
[1:36:53] bring healing and the song is so
[1:36:57] inspiring and if they're actually
[1:36:59] obsessed with
[1:37:02] it and the Christian Church many of them
[1:37:05] couldn't catch it many of them couldn't
[1:37:07] catch it here here it this right
[1:37:10] here I'm obsessed with them it's isn't
[1:37:13] everybody I'm obsessed with their
[1:37:15] honesty and the people who like them
[1:37:18] most are the people who should
[1:37:21] be outraged
[1:37:27] most in Australia for example each time
[1:37:30] we arrive at the airport it was if we
[1:37:34] the gal had landed or better yet the
[1:37:37] Messiah the root The Roots were lying
[1:37:41] solid cripples threw away their sticks
[1:37:44] sick people rushed up to the car as if
[1:37:47] the touch from one of the boys would
[1:37:49] make them well again old women stood
[1:37:53] watching ING with their grandchildren
[1:37:55] and as we pass by I could see the look
[1:37:58] on their
[1:38:00] faces it was if some savior had arrived
[1:38:03] and all these people were happy and
[1:38:05] relieved as if things somehow were going
[1:38:08] to be better
[1:38:09] now Taylor Paul stuck a cigarette in his
[1:38:12] mouth the only thing left for the
[1:38:13] Beatles he said is to go on a healing
[1:38:18] tour this is their manager talking about
[1:38:21] the anointing on these boys Bo and we
[1:38:24] say well brother is that was backed in
[1:38:27] you better wake up son sister daughter
[1:38:30] you better wake
[1:38:31] up that anoint that obsessive it's it's
[1:38:35] an obsession there's an anointing on
[1:38:38] that and they leading mega churches
[1:38:41] today with this
[1:38:43] anointing come on
[1:38:45] somebody
[1:38:47] huh where are we at Saints
[1:38:53] everybody getting up and singing ain't
[1:38:55] for
[1:38:56] me every type of worship ain't for me
[1:39:01] no no
[1:39:04] sir there is a way that God has provided
[1:39:07] for
[1:39:08] me and it's the
[1:39:10] oldfashioned blood gospel it's the way
[1:39:14] that's been proven it's brought us
[1:39:16] through the great hard trials and tests
[1:39:20] it's got context it's got meaning to the
[1:39:23] word words there's a revelation in it
[1:39:26] amen
[1:39:28] somebody you'll lose this when you add
[1:39:33] or you take
[1:39:35] away is that
[1:39:38] right we can add
[1:39:40] more We'll add so much by default we're
[1:39:43] taken away from the old way that we've
[1:39:47] done
[1:39:49] okay 11:45 all right
[1:39:54] thank
[1:39:56] you I'm going to take my time this
[1:40:04] morning let's take the seven seal just
[1:40:06] for a moment all right Saints how many
[1:40:08] love the
[1:40:09] Lord It's a discipline you want to
[1:40:12] develop you you want to judge all things
[1:40:16] with this with this within your spirit
[1:40:19] Mom Dad you need to have this in you
[1:40:23] young young Minister song leader whoever
[1:40:25] you are Deacon trustee young person
[1:40:28] coming up like this here older person
[1:40:31] newly baptized whoever you are you need
[1:40:34] to develop this discipline in your
[1:40:36] spirit you got to have this within
[1:40:39] you to judge all
[1:40:43] things with the word through the lenses
[1:40:45] of the word of the
[1:40:49] Lord this is the hour that we in it's a
[1:40:51] terrible treacherous time but a
[1:40:54] beautiful time too
[1:40:58] now brother brandham tells us that Satan
[1:41:03] cannot take the word word by word he
[1:41:07] can't do it now he can impersonate any
[1:41:10] kind of a gift he can impersonate this
[1:41:13] sermon somebody preaching somebody look
[1:41:15] like me he can take a preacher make him
[1:41:17] look exactly like a preacher message
[1:41:19] preacher and just a total impersonation
[1:41:22] but he can't take the word word by word
[1:41:26] he can't take he can't take every Vision
[1:41:29] he can take most of them he could take a
[1:41:32] lum but every single detail all the way
[1:41:35] to the E can't take it this separates
[1:41:38] him from the True Believer and brother
[1:41:41] bam says this in the seventh seal
[1:41:43] paragraph 259 remember Satan will try to
[1:41:46] impersonate he'll try to impersonate
[1:41:49] everything that the church will do he's
[1:41:51] tried to do it we notice it through the
[1:41:54] Antichrist but this is one thing he
[1:41:56] cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics
[1:41:59] to this see cuz he don't know it there's
[1:42:02] no way for him to know
[1:42:04] it it's the third pool look at your
[1:42:07] neighbor say third
[1:42:09] pool he just knows nothing about it
[1:42:13] Hallelujah when was the last time you
[1:42:14] said third
[1:42:18] pool this is one thing Satan can't know
[1:42:21] Saints this is our Escape up out of here
[1:42:25] this is our protection this is what's
[1:42:27] keeping my
[1:42:29] Ministry this is what's keeping my
[1:42:32] Revelation it is the third pool message
[1:42:36] the unfolding of God's word to his
[1:42:39] bride
[1:42:41] amen
[1:42:42] amen it's the third pool he doesn't
[1:42:45] understand it let's take one more in the
[1:42:48] message Christ is revealed in his own
[1:42:50] word paragraph 27
[1:42:53] the prophet of God says this today so
[1:42:57] confused about the evidence of the Holy
[1:42:58] Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate
[1:43:02] any kind of a gift that God has
[1:43:06] got but he cannot bring that word word
[1:43:10] by
[1:43:12] word that's where he failed in the
[1:43:14] Garden of Eden that's where he's always
[1:43:17] failed that's where them the tape on
[1:43:20] false anointed ones and anointed ones
[1:43:23] they can be Anointed with the spirit
[1:43:24] speak in tongues dance shout preach the
[1:43:27] gospel and steal a
[1:43:33] devil all
[1:43:35] right look at that
[1:43:39] so so what's the difference brother
[1:43:41] Israel so this this this when we're
[1:43:44] talking about every word brother will
[1:43:46] when we're talking about every word
[1:43:49] brother LSI and
[1:43:51] Saints so
[1:43:53] so the blessings of the Lord are
[1:43:57] unlimited and and that is you know
[1:44:00] healing gifts you know I it it it's
[1:44:03] about how much you believe you can have
[1:44:07] as much as you believe all right it it
[1:44:10] it's according to your faith amen so if
[1:44:13] you want you want half of your cup full
[1:44:16] this morning well that's on you that's
[1:44:18] right right a full cup is available
[1:44:23] if you only got half of a cup it's not
[1:44:25] because he didn't have a full cup for
[1:44:28] you you you can have your cup full how
[1:44:31] many know that this morning you can
[1:44:34] leave out of here with your bowl
[1:44:37] full with the blessings of almighty God
[1:44:41] if you ask him for it he'll give it to
[1:44:43] you if you believe him for it he'll give
[1:44:46] it to you you have not because you ask
[1:44:49] not say Lord fill my cup this morning
[1:44:53] Lord give me a double portion give me a
[1:44:55] touchdown in my soul like I never did
[1:44:57] you ask for
[1:45:00] that you have not because you ask not
[1:45:03] this is these are percentages these are
[1:45:06] you know based on you and your faith he
[1:45:09] that sold sparingly
[1:45:12] reaped sparingly he that sold
[1:45:15] bountifully reaped that's the scriptures
[1:45:19] First Corinthians talks about it but
[1:45:22] with the word word it's not
[1:45:24] so with the word it's not percentages
[1:45:27] like you got 90% right or 99 with the
[1:45:31] word god commands us to get it all and
[1:45:35] to believe it
[1:45:37] all and it is this
[1:45:40] blessing that entitles us to the
[1:45:43] Token when we believe it all not believe
[1:45:48] most not believe more than we used to
[1:45:50] but believe it all
[1:45:53] amen you mean 1965
[1:45:56] all 472 yes all of
[1:46:00] it even the Book of
[1:46:03] habca
[1:46:05] Numbers yes all of it plus whatever God
[1:46:11] will reveal to
[1:46:14] you God reveals to you that your entire
[1:46:17] family will be saved you can relieve
[1:46:20] that amen amen you can receive that so
[1:46:24] we know that Satan can't keep the word
[1:46:27] word by word he can't do it this is what
[1:46:31] separates the True Believer just this
[1:46:34] discipline alone don't add don't take
[1:46:36] away and every bit of it is the word of
[1:46:39] the Lord don't misinterpret don't
[1:46:42] misplace it don't dislocate it leave it
[1:46:46] alone leave it the way it is and God
[1:46:49] will vindicate it in its due time the
[1:46:53] Bible the prophet of God takes in Christ
[1:46:55] is revealed in this old word and he says
[1:46:58] this here paragraph number
[1:47:01] 57 to answer our question
[1:47:04] on you know the Revelation as we receive
[1:47:07] more
[1:47:08] Revelation it's not
[1:47:10] new it's new to us but it's not new to
[1:47:13] the economy of God we're not adding new
[1:47:17] new message theology no you can't if you
[1:47:22] do you going to have something different
[1:47:23] than what's on the tape and that's where
[1:47:25] some of them have
[1:47:27] steered and and we have steered we've
[1:47:29] gone down that path we've intellectually
[1:47:32] we've thought yeah maybe that could be
[1:47:33] maybe that is a correct interpret maybe
[1:47:36] maybe you know maybe my pastor's writing
[1:47:38] brother Brandon was
[1:47:39] wrong some have gone down that path you
[1:47:43] need to get back where the angel is you
[1:47:45] need to find out where the angel of the
[1:47:47] Lord is because the angel of the Lord is
[1:47:50] leading someone and it's a prophet and
[1:47:52] then the people are following that
[1:47:54] Prophet that was led by the angel of the
[1:47:56] Lord
[1:48:01] amen is this too old for
[1:48:04] y'all this is exactly where we are today
[1:48:08] brother branam takes Christ is revealed
[1:48:10] in his own word and he says this he says
[1:48:12] like the Seven Seals look at this
[1:48:15] temptation come to him the Seven Seals
[1:48:17] someone kept saying to me now you the
[1:48:20] Lord will speak to you brother Brandon
[1:48:22] when these seals are revealed and will
[1:48:25] tell us how to get closer to God and how
[1:48:28] to do it like all the Bible didn't have
[1:48:31] that information already in
[1:48:34] there how to get closer to God but no
[1:48:37] the Seven Seals this campaign is going
[1:48:39] to tell us how to get closer to what
[1:48:42] about the Bible Church what about all
[1:48:45] the instructions in the
[1:48:47] Bible turning a corner he say we turn a
[1:48:51] corner we turn what does that mean turn
[1:48:54] the corner like we stop believing the
[1:48:56] message now turn the corner turn the
[1:48:58] corner like my Bible don't mean that no
[1:49:00] more turn the corner what you mean turn
[1:49:02] the
[1:49:04] corner how many's heard that term oh
[1:49:07] we've turned the corner today so we
[1:49:09] don't go to church no more uh you need
[1:49:12] to find a corner that has a church on it
[1:49:14] and turn inside that corner and go to
[1:49:16] the Altar and start praising the Lord
[1:49:19] because because if you turn the corner
[1:49:22] where we don't go to church no more tell
[1:49:25] me who told you
[1:49:27] that the
[1:49:29] devil e
[1:49:32] interpreter exactly right no no wait
[1:49:35] this is fresh this is fresh everything
[1:49:37] God gave us was
[1:49:39] fresh you say this is fresh is it's
[1:49:41] something new I never heard before I
[1:49:43] don't want to know nothing about nothing
[1:49:45] that God didn't send to me God sent to
[1:49:48] me his
[1:49:50] word and that's where we should remain
[1:49:52] let's take this
[1:49:54] here paragraph 57 the Seven Seals kept
[1:49:58] saying now the Lord will speak to you
[1:50:00] brother Brandon when these seals are
[1:50:01] revealed and will tell us how to get
[1:50:03] closer to God and how to do it I said no
[1:50:06] sir it can't be because the Bible the
[1:50:11] Seven Seals on it had the seven
[1:50:14] Mysteries hid it was already wrote but
[1:50:19] they didn't understand what it was
[1:50:28] it was already wrote friends but the
[1:50:30] people didn't understand what it was and
[1:50:33] the Seven this is why the seven seal
[1:50:35] book The Mystery it's it seems boring to
[1:50:38] some people but they don't realize young
[1:50:41] people included little ones older ones
[1:50:44] that the seven seal book the message is
[1:50:46] is for you you teenagers go pick it up
[1:50:48] and read it something's in there for you
[1:50:50] the great mystery to be revealed
[1:50:52] revealed that was hidden in back part of
[1:50:55] God's mind to be revealed in the last
[1:50:57] days hidden and it looks like he ain't
[1:51:01] really even say
[1:51:02] nothing go read it
[1:51:05] again read it until it makes you
[1:51:08] cry read it till you fill it in your
[1:51:10] bones read it until an amen comes from
[1:51:13] your spirit and you'll do what John did
[1:51:16] when he saw what was taking place man he
[1:51:20] screamed out didn't he
[1:51:23] everybody heard I
[1:51:25] John yes it'll have an emotion it'll
[1:51:27] have effect upon you like a man drinking
[1:51:31] wine the little church mouse Hallelujah
[1:51:35] hiding in the church and running from
[1:51:37] the cat all the time the cat chasing him
[1:51:40] around he's hiding all the time and
[1:51:42] somebody spilled some wine in the church
[1:51:45] and that little mouse ran through there
[1:51:47] and got some wine on his hands they
[1:51:49] start licking that wine off of his hands
[1:51:51] and he start feeling
[1:51:53] good like
[1:51:55] man his courage built up he started
[1:51:59] feeling like I ain't no mouse and he
[1:52:01] said where's the cat at and that's what
[1:52:04] a revelation will do to you you'll stop
[1:52:07] running around you'll get you'll get a
[1:52:09] revelation that he is good all taste and
[1:52:13] see that the Lord is good he'll never
[1:52:18] leave you or forsake you you find out
[1:52:20] you're a son of God you're a daughter of
[1:52:23] God
[1:52:26] Amen yes Christ is revealed in his own
[1:52:29] word brother manam continues paragraph
[1:52:31] 128 so did you all get that you all got
[1:52:35] that the Seven Seals wasn't nothing new
[1:52:37] it was the mystery that was here it was
[1:52:39] already written but we didn't know what
[1:52:41] it was let's take one mystery real quick
[1:52:44] real quick it's in St John chapter 3
[1:52:47] quickly
[1:52:54] there a sneaky one but it's
[1:52:59] there he asked brother Neville what do
[1:53:02] you say about that what does that mean
[1:53:05] he said we'll get to it tonight and he
[1:53:07] didn't never did get to it but another
[1:53:08] message he brought it out in St John
[1:53:11] chapter 3 Jesus speaking to Nicodemus
[1:53:13] let's see if I can find it here
[1:53:23] verse
[1:53:25] 13 it says verse 12 if I have told you
[1:53:27] Earthly things and you believe not how
[1:53:30] shall you believe if I tell you of
[1:53:32] heavenly things and no man hath ascended
[1:53:36] up to heaven but he that came down from
[1:53:41] heaven even the son of man which is in
[1:53:44] heaven brother brand touches this and
[1:53:48] that's a strong one
[1:53:50] now ask your trinitarian and friends to
[1:53:53] explain that no don't ask them don't ask
[1:53:56] them it's just a debate ask God to
[1:53:58] reveal it to you what that means it
[1:54:01] means that he was the omnipotent one not
[1:54:05] a second person he was the
[1:54:08] person even the son of man who is now in
[1:54:12] heaven and he the son of man is talking
[1:54:14] to these people here but the son of man
[1:54:16] is even in heaven he was the omnipotent
[1:54:19] one the word made flesh he that was from
[1:54:23] the beginning not a trinitarian but he
[1:54:27] was God himself little details like that
[1:54:30] little statements that are laying in
[1:54:32] little things that are said on the tapes
[1:54:35] even like the new name of God and many
[1:54:38] things the seven Thunders what did they
[1:54:40] utter John saw it he's about to write he
[1:54:43] said don't write it then brother random
[1:54:45] sees it and he can't make it out and the
[1:54:47] Lord forbids him from bringing it on the
[1:54:50] tape on what that third thing was
[1:54:53] what was that so there things that are
[1:54:54] there that will be revealed I don't have
[1:54:57] to make anything up and so that seven
[1:55:01] seal the Mysteries are already written
[1:55:04] but it has to be revealed and as they're
[1:55:06] being revealed you should be able to see
[1:55:08] your name in there somehow some way it's
[1:55:11] related to you let's take paragraph
[1:55:16] 128 and Christ is revealed in his own
[1:55:19] word
[1:55:20] amen and then that'll be our last one
[1:55:24] musicians prepare to come back
[1:55:28] please paragraph 12 all the other words
[1:55:31] I don't care how well they are
[1:55:33] placed how who they come from what
[1:55:36] denomination they come from or how smart
[1:55:38] the man is is to be absolutely
[1:55:43] ignored anything contrary to the
[1:55:47] word you want to put that scripture down
[1:55:50] it's Galatians 1 18 see Paul said though
[1:55:53] we or an angel from heaven would preach
[1:55:55] any other thing than this you've already
[1:55:58] heard let him be accursed and other
[1:56:00] words if an angel would come to you from
[1:56:02] Heaven a bright shining Angel and would
[1:56:06] stand boy that would be bait for this
[1:56:09] day wouldn't it bright shining
[1:56:12] Angel come up there stand and say things
[1:56:16] was contrary to the word you say Satan
[1:56:18] get away from me right if he's a bishop
[1:56:22] ship if you whatever he is don't you
[1:56:25] never believe him if he doesn't speak
[1:56:28] exactly with that Bible word by word
[1:56:32] watch him he'll carry you with the Bible
[1:56:35] now he'll carry you to a certain place
[1:56:38] and then hook it right there when you
[1:56:42] see the Bible saying one thing and he
[1:56:44] bypasses that watch him right
[1:56:48] there that's on the tapes that's on the
[1:56:50] Visions that's on everything all right
[1:56:52] they bypass Little Things They ignore
[1:56:54] little statements but it's all there see
[1:56:58] that's the way he done Eve he come right
[1:56:59] down and said everything just exactly
[1:57:02] God said this that's right Eve amen
[1:57:04] we'll believe that together well God
[1:57:06] said this amen we believe that together
[1:57:08] God said this yeah we believe that sure
[1:57:12] well but God said we'll die well now you
[1:57:14] know he's a good God he didn't say he
[1:57:17] wouldn't you know but surely oh me there
[1:57:22] he
[1:57:23] is and brother
[1:57:25] brandham is showing us how Satan takes
[1:57:30] that word in the Bible and he brings it
[1:57:33] up to a certain spot brings it up brings
[1:57:36] it up brings it up and then he hooks it
[1:57:39] right there he adds something or he says
[1:57:41] you know that's not reasonable it can't
[1:57:42] be you know maybe maybe the prophet was
[1:57:45] wrong you see what happened in
[1:57:47] 1977 you remember that you see this you
[1:57:49] see it's say
[1:57:51] Satan trying to throw you off from the
[1:57:54] word of the Lord that God has given to
[1:57:56] you so we want to take these disciplines
[1:57:59] of staying with the word don't add don't
[1:58:02] take away and um don't misinterpret
[1:58:06] don't misplace it don't dislocate it
[1:58:10] even in our instructions that the Lord
[1:58:13] has revealed to us and um move forward
[1:58:18] into What the Lord Has revealed to us
[1:58:20] and stay with but that word no matter
[1:58:24] what and it will entitle us to the great
[1:58:28] token every word of it believ in every
[1:58:31] word of it entitles it the token is a
[1:58:34] sign that the purchase has been made he
[1:58:37] says paragraph
[1:58:39] 338 it's been made and been accepted now
[1:58:42] you can't get that token from the
[1:58:44] railroad Fair until you pay the price
[1:58:47] and the only way you're going to pay the
[1:58:49] price is pay it that's right what
[1:58:52] believe it accept it full obedience to
[1:58:56] the whole word of God will entitle you
[1:58:59] to the Token full obedience not the part
[1:59:03] of it as far as your denomination goes
[1:59:07] but all of it full obedience to the word
[1:59:11] which is Christ brings you into Christ
[1:59:17] this has liberated my Ministry Saints
[1:59:19] this has liberated me as an individual
[1:59:22] and I believe it'll liberate you too as
[1:59:24] I we continue to go forward full
[1:59:27] obedience to every word not as far as
[1:59:29] the group takes you is this one or that
[1:59:31] one says but this is what the word of
[1:59:33] the Lord has given to us and let's
[1:59:35] receive it all and God will bless you as
[1:59:40] he blessed Joshua made him
[1:59:44] successful God was with him God bless
[1:59:46] you he'll make you successful in these
[1:59:49] same truths amen am let us
[1:59:53] pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings
[1:59:57] upon your people this morning the word
[1:59:59] that we
[2:00:00] heard we ask you Lord to remind
[2:00:04] us of how achen Lost It
[2:00:08] All by Disobedience to the they didn't
[2:00:12] even they didn't even hurt anyone
[2:00:14] personally they just they lied within
[2:00:20] themselves to the Holy Ghost
[2:00:24] and you saw that and you caught it and
[2:00:26] it me really meant something it it
[2:00:29] wasn't
[2:00:30] even it wasn't an adultery they didn't
[2:00:33] they didn't even take from anyone they
[2:00:35] didn't murder anyone it wasn't anger or
[2:00:39] aggression they didn't have a temper
[2:00:41] they just simply they simply
[2:00:45] lied and and
[2:00:47] and to the agreement that they had and
[2:00:51] Lord you saw
[2:00:53] that and it caused death to them it
[2:00:56] caused death to
[2:00:58] achin one little bad direction from what
[2:01:03] what the Lord had instructed him to do
[2:01:06] and he lost his whole family over
[2:01:09] it but oh God how Joseph stayed faithful
[2:01:14] job he stayed faithful to the
[2:01:17] sacrifice Joshua stayed faithful to
[2:01:20] every word

[2:05:18] baptized in Jesus name the Lord revealed
[2:05:21] to her this message in 32 years or more
[2:05:26] she served the Lord she was a Catholic
[2:05:29] for many years and the Lord got a hold
[2:05:31] of her life in her
[2:05:33] 60s she has a large family there was oh
[2:05:37] my hundreds of people that came to her
[2:05:40] her funeral and it was so beautiful to
