closed their service to be with us and brother arando that most of his church is here and brother Osorio their church too we appreciate that Fellowship friends God bless you amen without further Ado we'll have brother faral F come and take the platform let's receive him yeah put those hands together amen God bless you friends bless you I can say God bless you Saints because you are Saints can say God bless you brothers and sisters because you are my brothers and sisters we are in the same family of God but I do prefer to greet you God bless you friends because the Bible says there is some friend of a greater value than a brother we are more than brothers and sister we are friends we love one another I am just a little bit nervous now for three reasons the first one is because of my so bad and broken English because uh I am a Frenchman I remember just um in July last July I was in a convention in new Week Canada and Minister was preaching and he was a very good friend of mine and when uh he has heard that I will be in the meeting when he arrived at the pulpit he said where are you brother F and so I just raised my hand and he said you know uh you know when I I see brother in a meeting I am really amazed that God is able to save even a French man because you know the French people they are not too much Godly but you know I am saved yeah I am Sanctified I am baptized in the Holy Ghost born again and I'm going to my adoption am we have so much great Ministries here so the first reason was my language second reason I have uh my time very limited and I I I don't want to take the time of my precious uh brother and friend Pastor malcol he will come after me so uh I I have to leave him all the time to to share what God has put on his heart and also F third reason is because after all the preaching the mighty preaching I heard and all these season ministers bringing the gospel I feel so little little little but I said I need your prayer and I need the help of God Amen and I I do believe that it will help me yes and if my English is not very um good English that you can understand the holy spirit will give you the the revelation of that the thought that I try to just share with you but before preaching I I will um you know uh really thank uh this uh the pasture brother Israel uh for opening the the pulpit to me and also for for you know here I said well wonderful welcome come wonderful singing wonderful preaching wonderful where when I let uh Canada it was snowing there arriving here sun and very nice Sun very dry and very nice place so when I arve at my room last night I just have this thinking oh I feel so very well so Lord maybe I can come here move here just uh be in uh in uh among the the the Believers and just be uh relaxing here but I remember that on the Mount of transfiguration Peter has the same idea oh it's so good here Lord is so good here so we will make free Tabernacle you know the things you know but no I said tomorrow I have to go back to serve God in the field and I will do that because I know that uh all the things that the Lord has done in my life it's so much it deserve to be the first one he has not asked for that if you brother said if you uh receive Jesus Christ at the third place fourth place seventh he will come he will always come but it deserves the first place so it must be the of a preeminence in his bride so that's all for now I don't think if I ask a brother to put for me because I am not too much on techniques uh my uh quotes on PowerPoint uh presentation is it okay or I don't know if if it's it's okay okay good thank you so I think I will go very quickly now uh you know it's time to get serious with the coming of the Lord because you know um week after week week we are coming to church we are singing HS we are hearing the word and it seems that you know maybe we are not too uh too much about that the the Lord can can wait a little bit it seems but you know it's not the Lord uh it's not us waiting on the Lord It's the Lord waiting on us said brother he said the coming of La is already past due for a long time it's because of us because we have not taken our place because we have not given the message around us spread the gospel enough and he said so so it's time brothers and sister and when we saw all the things arriving around it it's time to get serious with the coming of the lord we we must wait now we if Jesus will come tonight I don't know he can come in 5 minutes he can come in 5 years I don't know when he will come he will come and we must be serious but the problem is do we know in what season of a time of the end we are or where are we at because in the scriptures he said there are several days at the son uh days of the son of man uh the scripture is Luke 17 verse 22 and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one one of the days of a son of man there is many days of a son of man uh you know it was not the same day of a son of man when the disciples lived and fellowship with him before the cross and when Jesus after when Jesus appeared to them on the shores of the Sea of galileia after his resurrection different death always the same son of man but different death of the son of man and there are several days of the voice of a seventh Angel to Revelation 107 but in the days plural in the days of a voice of a seventh angel there are several death of a voice of a seventh Angels even spoke about the seven seven mountain peaks near Lima Montana which are symbols of his life story we have heard him telling about the three pools of his ministry several days of the voice of the seventh angel so in what day of the voice of the seventh angel are we living in it matters a lot if we don't want to miss what God is doing here and now I can remember the great things that God made has made for us throughout the years and even in the ministry of ofam when he was here on Earth that's days of the voice of the seventh angel but now in what day of the voice are we it's very important we must know what he's doing right now and we must look to another fact in the natural life we start as newborn babies we have seen last night the presentation of our precious brother and we we start a newborn babies to grow up in children then in teenagers until we are adults as a as and as single adults we found a wife or husband and then we be we became parents and even more grandparents life is not static but dynamic yeah I was so nervous I said I I will give thanks to the pastor and really uh always is warmly welcome that's very nice to me and you know not only to him I will really thanks you my precious friends from Shalom Tabernacle in Arizona because I know myself uh put on many many me conventions and you know it's a lot of work a lot of Oh My My My in and when I arrive here and when I see that church in such an order everything just coming very nice Etc oh my uh really you can be proud of your church pastor and your church you church if you are such a good church you can be proud of your pastor too because it's on on the both sides and so thank you s and specially also uh I would like to um give my thanks to a brother here brother Joshua Kate he was the one who take me pick me at the airport and from arriving in a in a count in a in a place in a city um last time I came here it was in 1978 so it's a long time ago and so uh I was with my precious brother brother per green and so uh when we you arrive there is somebody and he said okay we have a contact by phone and he came and we have just a good fellowship and after that uh yesterday I saw his precious wife two children uh his dad Etc all the family that's blessed my thank you brother Joshua for what you have done for me and so uh also uh because I am arriving here children children you know uh there is a special sister in that church that's the pastor's wife sister Sharon sister Sharon I don't know where she is uh right now but sister Sharon you know I remember her as a uh not as baby but I see I would say little girl very little girl and uh years passed and now when I I'm arriving you see not only she she is the wife of a pastor but she has three very nice children so that's something when I saw her at that time a little very little girl maybe two years I think maybe not even two years old she she was living she was very nice you know I saw somebody with babies babies everybody they they they love babies you know you know and they just said make us smile and Etc but a baby cannot do nothing for nobody you have to take care of him or her in all ways and remember Jesus Christ are all Lord when he came in half he was a baby and when he was the baby he cannot save you as a baby he cannot make anything for you as a baby he was just a baby even in Greek we have different different terms I don't want to to to give my G to Greek tonight it's enough to to to speak in English not even to translate and give in in in in French I can I can go there but you know we have term to say U baby in Greek we have term to say pretty little child we have term to say child we have term to say young boy we have term you know we have words for that and even in the scriptures if you are looking in your Bible in the Book of Luke you have all these kind of of terms apply to our Lord Jesus Christ when he was 12 years old at the Jerusalem Temple he cannot be your savior there no he cannot be because he was not uh in in the in the statute to to give his life for you and me even he is the Son of God no he has to go a ground up and even at the age of 30 years old when he was baptized by John the Baptist in um um in the Jordan River you know the the the father says something great about him this is my beloved Son but stop there yes sir he was the beloved Son of God but you know he has to go up ground up until he arrive on the on the Mount of transfiguration and when he arrive at the Mount of transfiguration when I'm said that's the day of adoption of the Lord Jesus Christ amen he has follow exactly the same way that we have to follow so when he was adopted on the Mount of transfiguration after not too long time he he gave his life for us on the cross of golat he was prepared now that's the time so you see the same in Christian Life we are babies when little children when children when young men are finally even fathers in John first epistle words things change things improve as a day follow another day in an onward unseizing constant Rhythm we must be always on the move as the brother sung uh I think U last night we must be always on the Move bam said that we are not born as adult but as baby I speak about spiritual birth New Birth but he also said that this message is not for babies and it's easy to understand it's for the bride and a baby girl or little 10 years old girl they are not in the right condition to be a bride potentially potentially this little girl she is or one day she will will be a bride she will be a mother potentially but at the age of 10 impossible for her to be the bride so you see we have to move on we have to grow uh and thanks be to God for all the his anointing throughout the decades past but here and now we need a new a special anointing you see um 50 27 years ago when I was a just a young Pentecostal evangelist when I received the message I was 17 years old I began to preach uh just after um about uh just two months after uh when I was uh 15 years old so another story that's the grace of God if I am here here it's the grace of God if you are here that's the grace of God and if the things have been improved during the day that's the grace of God as we heard this the first message the grace of God it's all grace of God it's not even my faith it's the faith of Jesus in me I have no Holiness it's his Holiness all the things that we have comes from the Lord so 57 years ago when I receive this message and believe it after a personal spiritual experience almost my all my preaching preaching was about brother Bram Ministry to show the fulfill fulfilling of fulfillment of Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 uh Revelation 10:7 it was just that I went from City to City uh to this all to another meeting all and uh we have received from Brother per green the the movies of Bram the two movies you know so I just um play the the movies at that time it's a big uh it's not now as we are very DVDs and all the things that we have and to make the translation we are we we are not enough Rich to pay to to put that on the on the uh on the tape so uh we have recorded on a little um record tape tape recorder and uh we just try to um adjust the speed of of the tape in order that what Ram says we will be in French really translate you know just speeding a little bit or just increasing or just limiting Etc it does veryy and first of all I I just myself each time I just say the word it's from fren translation of a a movie of a film and so so much things so much time and we we just try I preach always the same the same message the sign of the Messiah that's what we preach at that time but we have really a very good time you know but uh after that you know we began to translate in French um books and tapes in French and send them to french- speaking countries everywhere the fire was lit of wind of the spirit was fueling it it was another day very good day but then we went deeper in all the treasures that God gave us gave to us in this precious message and it was no more for us at that time brother Ram's message but our lord Jesus Christ's message to his bride that he brought To Us by Brother Bram the Heavenly bridegroom Whispering sweet love words to his Earthly bride and we lunch out into the deep of rapture adoption stature of a perfect man manifested sons of God pool an over deep things of God it was still an over day of the voice of a seventh angel you know we are always in the death of the voice of a seventh angel we don't need a new message we don't need a new revelation we don't need a new messenger or new something we have the message of the hour this message is still the same message and God will never change the things because he has made everything this Elijah came and this Elijah restore all things all things have been restored but the question is is are all things restored in my life and in your life my brother or sister that's the thing everything is rest restored but this restoration must take place in each one of us so this is the same message but we are going going going more so uh very good and impressive not worthy day but now we are no more spiritual babies neither spiritual young people spiritually speaking we are no more in the same day of a voice in which we were years ago if we have stopped in our growth in our progress there is something wrong yes you are coming in a church and you have babies maybe there are 20 years in the message 20 years in the church very good members but babies if there is just a little putting thing little little things that disturb them oh my it's a big problem and you have to take the deacons the pastor and everybody to because a baby is a baby that's right but this message is not for babies we will not have a special meeting with a uh girl of 10 years old to speak about marage no you understand me so if you are talking about what uh God what want to the bride we must be more than babies more than young people more we must be mature it's very important very important so we must have growth to reach maturity so the spirit of the Lord stimulate us to go ahead to launch out into the deep and to build believe and see there is now an un of day of the voice of the same seventh angel one glorious day a day now when God is fulfilling all his precious promises to his bride and make her a word bride A Perfect Bride a pure vergin bride amen we have heard all the things happening uh especially um um from uh uh 2023 uh no 20 uh 20 uh uh 20 15 2015 we are people for decades in the message be they began to to deny that message to say so much things about bam Etc even trying to find the price of the candies ET Etc to prove that brother bam said things that are not right Etc and they said about the the cloud so many things you know Etc and many we we are so many many many things so in the message the evening messenger said something very great the evening messenger uh 65 uh January 16 notice when the message is rejected and the messenger seems to be defeated seems not is defeated seems seems to be defeated that's when God stepped on the scene his message is over God step on the scene Hallelujah that's I believe from deep within my heart the time has come this sees the day this sees the hour when God is stepping on the scene hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord in this perilous times after this pandemic virus circumstances in this trouble moment we have to Proclaim that we are not defeated but we are more than over fromers more than conquerors winners not losers but but I will I will add through through our great God and savior our Lord Jesus Christ not by our own power no even in the in the uh in the zerob uh uh commission it he said not by your might not by by m my spirit say the Lord that's the spirit of God doing the things and so uh why why God is acting actually in in our lives it's because he will give us a fresh and renewed anointing for what to reach the goal and the goal is to come unto the stature of a perfect man to be totally transformed in the likeness of Jesus Christ to receive the fullness of the adoption to live the great Oneness God and man becoming one one forever demonstrating Mighty glorious wonders just before our going up in the Rapture and it's all the Amazing Grace of the Lord the special rapturing Grace only for his bride that we have to preach now in such a day we don't just preach Grace we preach rapturing Grace because we are in the time of a Rapture am amen you know many message Believers are not aware about the difference between the appearing and the coming of Our Lord they they do not know that we are living in the time of the appearing of Jesus Christ waiting for his coming because he will come literally said brother we are waiting is coming but already he has appeared Among Us they do not know that our bridegroom is Among Us that his presence is here and now to bring us into Perfection is ear I have not the the quote but the quote comes to my mind where said my Ministry is to declare him that he is here am he is here not simply said the Holy Spirit Etc no he is here the person of the Lord Jesus Christ is in his bride to prepare the bride to make that bride a pure word bride because he is the word and when he will be uh at the great uh super uh wedding supper uh he will unite he is already unit with us because the marriage is on this Earth but it has taken place marage is always taken place marage is the promises you know but we are going to a wedding brother said we are not going to a marage we are going to a wedding that's the difference before you are going to the wedding there is a you know uh a covenant be between the that that that brother and that sister their promises and their promises that's their marriage but after that they have to come before everybody and they they have a wedding and the wedding from that wedding they can live together uh and other family so uh most of the people they don't know that in the message I went somewhere and there are people saying oh he has come yes he has come he brother bam said so he has come but he has come in the sense he he has appeared his ear in the in the form of a anointed word his ear amen but he will come physically literally he will come and so there are some so no no it's all finish it's now no and the overs they tried to say we will stay with the Bible and they took the uh what the evangelicals believe for for most than two centuries but was said no there is no Jesus actually he will come and they don't know but appearing and coming are to things completely different just link together but uh you see there is a a scripture 1 John chapter 2 verse 28 1 John chap chapter 2 ver 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming appearing and coming and after that he said now we are children of God yes we are children of God but what we will be is not actually revealed but when it will be revealed we will know him exactly as he know us because that's the manifestation of the sons of God and you know when we are speaking about adoption adoption I will take some Greek adoption it's in Greek Yia Yia it's adoption a son excuse me excuse me f i preach in fres Sons son is Yos on is techon you know techon children techon children is not with adoption no you have the Life of Christ you have been born again that's okay but when you are yours that's your son and Os means otes adoption that's the thing so I have many quotes but we will just going through this quote this is the close of a royal seeds waiting is here is here the appearing of Christ there's a place in the Bible you know I didn't got time to go into it says the appearing of Christ and then the coming of Christ that's two different things Al together the appearing and the coming is appearing now Etc next quote it says the same thing in all these quotes here the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord he said here um now uh 76 now the appearing of the Lord is now now when he is appearing in his people his Spirit working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for RT the Rapture for the coming of the Lord to catch away the bride see the appearing and the coming two things you can uh just go uh so let me say to you if we are no more than another religious group with its Doctrine and Customs we have not understood the purpose of God with the great message he has sent to us for brother bam going to church to be a good member of what we call now a message Church giving respect to the pastor paying time offering sharing some responsibilities in the congregation and trying to live the best good life we can even if all these thing are right that does not make us real message Believers because Jesus said to the religious scholars in his time and they know the scriptures so much Matthew 22:29 ye do not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God I remember the testimony of our precious brother uh last uh morning uh yesterday morning when he said I was in the church I you know but I was not born again that's terrible and many people in many message churches they are message there are in the church there are real believers they believe we had they know yes brother bam was a prophet of God we I believe the message I believe everything but they are not born again and that's the problem and if we have not be born again as we our precious brother whisper say last night we we have not begin the things we must be born again it's the foundation so to be real message Believers to have been revived through the shout the message of yah is much much much more that to know so well this message that we are able to quote brother bam on all issues uh it is much much more than to tell all the details of his so special ministry as so peculiar life we have a letter of a message but that not enough that does not mean that we got the spirit of message God has sent a prophet messenger with a so powerful message to make us member of his body of his bride ready for the rapture we have a high calling we have a Heavenly calling we are predestinated to be the Lamb's wife [Music] forever so I will take the the quot just go on uh in the message the token I will just uh going very very quickly three five minutes uh no no just go on go on go on all this C I don't have the time to to take all these things I will go to the point uh yeah we are coming to it just in a moment to prove that it's the life okay that is the token yes sir go on the court we are going come on Speedy sir my my don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ next quote message next quote Yeah Yeah and God is moving his church I show all oh we've been keeping the lamb up now for quite a while watching seeing what is is doing watching his nature and everything but now the token has got to be applied he got to be applied it's the only thing except a man be born of a spirit and of water he will in no wise enter in and should love one another believer should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly now you people that's listening to this on tape you woman you men you listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe it now it's time for to quit fing with one another believe a message of the Bible believe Jesus Christ and love H respect one another men respect your wives you respect your home bring your home together because remember Islam was for the home not just one for the whole home to had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love each other and believer should separate themselves from the world not not they were not yes just yet come together to talk about the message they come together to apply the blood to apply the token that's what you must you must do pastor and to this congregation trust his Deacon to youen it's time that we let aside all the foolishness of the world time we let us side everything else we have seen enough now till we are positive sh and the token must be must be must be applied without it we are going to perish you must perish that's the only thing oh don't come together I believe it get beneath it get into it how do it by one Spirit we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ we have the message last night everybody believe with all your heart see he was was not responsible for any out okay there is there is there is too much things to say they come together to apply the blood to apply the to the Token so to be a real message believer or rather a a bride of Christ member yes sir I prefer to say a bride of Christ member that to a message believer a bride of Christ member we need a special very special fresh anointing the long awaited hour has arrived for the bride to experience a new and fresh anointing from the Lord what is this special anointing and we'll finish with that with a quote here all right Revelation chapter 4 part two uh yeah uh just uh yeah yeah when Jesus died the temple veil rent not only a high priest but who soever will can have that same anointing of a shaking glory and walk a holy life holy holy holy unto the Lord and approach in the very presence of God through the blood of Jesus Christ before him take him with Lord Jesus he a sick man he's my brother he's on the death bed right now to die I am approaching you holy holy holy unto the Lord what for as a high priest what for in behalf of my brother there you are your daily walk your daily talk your daily Behavior your heart your soul and all holy holy Holly unto the Lord no roots of bitterness no nothing else holy holy Holly unto the Lord as we begin to approach in behal of our brother whosoever will make anointed blood in in front on him front of him the blood going before him playing holy holy just go on now what is it Christ coming to his body Christ is the word we all know the anointing is Christ yeah that comes on the word that makes the word live is it right right that is the anointing Christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the world that Quicken the world to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in Divine Healing whatever ever more see and Christ the anointing coming to his body see the connection there just like husband and wife to become one now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ become one he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible all of it is yours everything which is promise at this age is [Music] yours just that's good two minutes last one in a second ended Rob he said uh when Elisha come down to the Jordan etc etc and he said and the things the world needs this morning is the power of the god of Elijah you might have spoke with tongues and shouted and run off the floor but what we need is the power of the god of Pentecost to produce to produce what the lives and thing that was living that day in the apostolic power a second handed Rob was all right but he needed a fresh goal in his heart from God he needed a fresh anointing from God he wor a second-handed Rob when he come to the river but he needed a brand new fir handed call from God a fir handed power from God to perform the miracle and my brother don't you be afraid to ask God anything you must demand God or ask God for anything that he has promised for if I am introducing a God that's omnipotent and all powerful and if I be a servant of God I must do the works of God and if I do the work of God I must demand of God to bring these things to pass just listen very closely now because he the Lord is demanding of me to produce the impossible to produce the impossible we have we need the the anointing of a person of the Lord Jesus Christ we can have anointing pray worship anointing Evangelistic anointing prayer anointing Etc healing anointing but we must have the the the really the anointing of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the day of a voice of a seven Church age messenger that we leave in amen we are ADV VM so we cannot just be regular church goers anymore and just uh to close I will ask you to Bow your heads in prayer because I will take a prayer ofam himself in the message vo you say this is preach in 64 December 27 64 and he said I we can we can pray with a prophet of God the same prayer let us surrender Soul Spirit body all of our being to Christ let the Holy Ghost take complete control on each on us on us and get ready for the going up of rupture so the prayer of of of brother bam if I had the privilege of speaking to some people Lord it was not to glorify nothing but this person who the peoples wondering who it is they know that man cannot do this they know it's beyond man to know these things but the people says what is it Lord we know it's you it's Jesus Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost he is the Holy Ghost I come from God I go to God and we see the great Pillar of Fire Fire Among Us Lord the same as they did in the first part of the Bible with Moses we seen it in the middle of the Bible when Paul was on his road to Damascus we see it now here we see it at the end time again free is a confirmation it's been the message each time God made man and woman no longer hold on to traditions and Treats but may they come out of that thing give their lives completely to God and believe not trust just upon Terror and things of man but trust in the Living God while these holid days are going on the cry still is who is this what is it what is it all about religious people say that same thing and it's the same Lord Jesus made flesh in his people anointing his word for the bride and they can't understand it there are also twing laa till they don't know what is what it is all about but the prophet said there'll be light in the evening so now we are looking for it Lord come Lord bless each one amen God bless you how many how many Joy word of the Lord oh what a blessing with a French accent but it's the word of the Lord amen amen let's sing this song as brother Malcolm prepares to come Who I Am Lord who I am who I am Lord who I am I can see now who I am a part of my savior a part of his word it's a revelation it's [Music] predestination of who I am oh glor glorious victory that day he set me free let's stand and sing it my heart is very thrown my life is no longer mine I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I live now I live to praise His name oh Who I Am Lord oh who I [Applause] am and I can see now who I am a part of my savior a part of his word it's a revelation it's predestination of who one more time with all your heart who I am oh Who I Am Lord who I am I can see now who I [Music] am part of his word it's a revelation it's predestination of who I am Give the Lord a hand of Praise brother Malcolm Webster God bless [Applause] you seated I greet you all in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh sorry I'm waiting for my translator because normally for years been preaching in English and our brother translate me in French so I catch myself hesitated it's good to be with you it's good to be in the house of the Lord It's the first time coming this way and we want to say thank you for all your love and kindness it kind of a make me wants to come back and our pastor there from Phoenix is it right brother Amanda yeah he came by us sometime ago and he preached for us it was a wonderful zice he preach about the mind of man how the human mind could kind of play tricks in them it was wonderful we always remember him and we really had some wonderful time here and I believe it's time for us to stop because uh all the great preaching the Wednesday night in Phoenix Thursday night in Phoenix and Friday night with our brother and Saturday with about a Paul it was wonderful and then Saturday night again with brother whisper you know my girl she was telling brother whisper brother whisper brother whisper who is Brother whisper and then when he came into church I didn't know who he was but something said he looks special and he really was special we give God thanks for that and then with brother Ferguson's message it was wonderful and brother F where is he had yeah you know I've known by face since 85 and I think as you get older you get more powerful in the Lord I pray the Lord will bless him and keep him always in the straight and narrow path you know with all the preaching that we've had over the past week the purpose of the message was to kind of uh let the word live in you amen I because that's the most important thing is that your faith could grow I wouldn't Minister because we wouldn't have the time maybe brother Israel the next time going to come back but just to let you know the purpose of the minister you see they did the job they deliver you the word of God and I've noticed the um in these meetings there was no competition like Minister competing each other they compliment each other amen they were led by the spirit this one bring a message not knowing the other one and the Lord would come down and just show you he's trying to do something he's trying to stir our faith because the prophet told us the bride will be waiting for the revelation of that Rapture and you said that Revelation is Faith and you know he say fate is like a little whip that standed close to you that can give you whatever you want it's in you the message there you see the Fate is there you receiving the word now it's for that Faith to come alive that the word that we've been listening to the message take flesh not like with Mary when Joseph was reading the scripture she said read it again something happened she began to meditate on it maybe she heard it before but that was the time that that word came alive amen you see because the desire of every minister right is to see the people get ready for the Rapture that's good and that Rapture the prophet said it's in you he said all you need for this journey even the Rapture he said it in you when you receive the Holy Ghost so the word is there but now you and I must bring it alive and the important thing is to stay with only you and I that because he told us the day you're take into your heart one word that's not the word of God that's the you separate yourself from God he said when you question when a question come from the word of God in your heart he say you stop you can't go further people may think they going further but anytime you question God you stop right there and you had to go back and made it right so it's important that you stay with the word you've been taught and you have access to this message behold I send you Elijah the prophet you know one of the reason why it's important that you receive only what I Prophet said am he said because that body that we looking for that translated body to be change in a moment he said it will materialize around the word that's in you the word you've been receiving Maybe the devil say you forget it but he say they will materialize around that word so if we receive something that's not the word of God we just can't go because only that word he will change so stay with the word stay with that which the prophet said because that's what God will anoint amen and good better whisper P better f f the word of the Lord came to us always are wonderful but now it's us to let that word live the faith is in us he told us we have faith Paul said we have faith you see Peter said there's a fast T coming and we have to get over get away from that Noah wrote over his storm but there Firestorm you have to be changed in a moment so each and every one of us got to get to the place where the fth within us something happened that in that moment in time you'll be changed so it's in there you received the word you've been receiving the word but now the word must live and your faith must grow to that place where in a moment in a twinkle of an eye it'll be changed but it's not only congregation because I always said the nightmare of every minister is that his people going to Rapture and he had left behind I mean it's a nightmare you come to church and this one is gone and this one is gone you know one day my wife played a tree freaking me and it stayed with me it kind of a I know she was in the house I call her she's not there I look in every room she's not there my heart be to beat what's going on she thought it was a joke she was hiding from me imagine the congregation gone and the ministers Left Behind it's a nightmare but that's why we got to know now you you see you have that Assurance of the Rapture and is that word that you receive that take flesh in US amen Elias truly shall first come and restore all things the prophet did his part but that one must be manifested in US amen so I pray the Lord will help us as we leave these meetings we will live the way he want us to live because these minister they didn't just preach just having a good sermon I stood of God as the Watchman in the wall they wanted you to know that this message is real and this message is alive amen I never questioned the word of God he said that's the day you stop taking from the tree of life and you said death steading and let no one regardless of who they are as one of the I think it's brother Paul said I thought I was the only one that's saying that but I heard him said it I I told some my people he said look if you come in here and you're not 100% convinced that you can make the Rapture with what we teach you here you better find a place because at that day there should be no question in your mind not one question you should be certain you see because we choose a church to help guide us to Eternal destination so you should be certain that what you're receiving is enough to take you there there's a little song sister sh I'm going to live the way he wants me to leave I'm going to give until then just no more to give I'm going to laugh last still there just no more oh Lord I can never ever [Music] I'm for there been times when giving and loving brought pain and that promise I will never let it Happ happen again but I found out that love was wellous and that even in losing you win oh I'm going to live the way he wants me I'm going to give until there just no more to give I'm going to love love still as just noral love I can never ever out love the Lord oh for he showed us that only true dying will end and he gave when it seemed there was nothing to give he love when loving brought heartaches and love he forgave from that Old rocked cross I'm going to live the way he wants me to L I'm going to give until there just no more to give I'm going to love love till there just no more love for I can never ever out love the Lord amen and pray the Lord will help you that he will send his Spirit upon us all that we can live the message that which You' been hearding for the past week will come alive in our heart cuz we'll be going the Rapture will be coming but Ram said that he said when the bride recognize who she is he said then the Rapture will go because the Rapture is in us he said it's there recogn I he said look if you have just a shadow of God in you that's he said you're able to create a world yes and go living it amen he said but it's he said there's no weak part and strong part in God it's all strong he said be controlled by a law and that law is Faith as much faith that he will permit you to release he said but when the scriptures fulfilled then they'll be gone so as Str of God as the brothers were telling you you have what it takes to go he said you have power to raise yourself up but now we must believe that somehow believe it I'm going into the Rapture I'm going into the Rapture I'm going into the Rapture I'm going home he began to S better I'm going home I'm going home I'm going home like the blind man I'm heal I'm heal until in his heart he believe it here we going in the rapture we going in the Rapture I believe but then when it anchored down and you recognize who I am what am I doing here if in me lays the power to create Heaven and Earth yeah he said he said our teopan is right here to give us a charge like a charge going through a battery so it's here right around us we just had to come to the place where we realize yes that's me all that the brothers saying it's me it's me it's me and when we recognize that and realize that recognize who we are then we will go until that time let press on the battle will raise there will always be a battle the prop said the child of God f a battle every day within himself right against wrong you'll always have battle but see when trouble come the angel that leads you come and stand between you and trouble and challenge you take God at his word Lord bless you ion [Music] brother
