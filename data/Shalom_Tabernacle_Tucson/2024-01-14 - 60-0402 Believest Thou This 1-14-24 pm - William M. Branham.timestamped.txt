[41:32] sometimes I do that just to maybe like
[41:35] ask the person to get up make a step or
[41:37] two move your hand wiggle your finger
[41:39] just something that they can do
[41:40] different just to let them see that it's
[41:43] all all right they just get nervous and
[41:45] think it isn't going to happen but it's
[41:47] happening all the time and it has to how
[41:50] many Wants To Be Remembered in prayer
[41:52] now would you just raise your hands and
[41:53] say Lord grant it let us our
[41:58] heads Lord as we hear this grand old
[42:02] Hymn of the church R by my precious
[42:05] friend Paul Raider only
[42:08] believe we are thinking now of a boy was
[42:12] brought by his fathers to the disciples
[42:15] no more than 10 days after Jesus had
[42:18] given them power to cast out devils and
[42:21] heal the sick and here they was
[42:23] completely defeated on an epileptic case
[42:27] and they seen our Lord
[42:31] coming and the father ran and said Lord
[42:34] have mercy on us my son is variously
[42:38] vexed with the
[42:40] devil and I brought him to your
[42:42] disciples and they could not cure him
[42:45] Jesus said I can if you believe only
[42:49] believe oh God you haven't changed a bit
[42:53] since then you're just the same
[42:57] loving sweet and compassionate God as
[43:01] you were then so are you today and Lord
[43:04] like that father we all cry Lord help
[43:07] thou our unbelief it's so simple we just
[43:11] stumble over it father we want to offer
[43:14] you thanks and praise for touching that
[43:18] little baby last night to see that that
[43:21] skull that's been swollen that is that
[43:25] the bone has pushed out it went down
[43:28] half an inch last night we are grateful
[43:31] for that father when we know it our
[43:34] doctors has nothing in the research for
[43:36] it there's nothing that they can do for
[43:39] it but Thou Art still God the master of
[43:42] all situations we thank thee father we
[43:45] thank thee for this Mother's loyalty and
[43:47] sweetness and obedience to bring back
[43:50] the string and paste it on this piece of
[43:52] paper here to show to the public her
[43:55] testimony for the glory of God May her
[43:57] little one live and be a normal child
[44:00] For Your Glory look at all those hands
[44:03] that went up father each of them had a
[44:05] need mine up too father I have need and
[44:09] here's many here in the form of letter
[44:12] or in this box that's needy people who
[44:16] are really needy let it come to pass
[44:19] Lord that each will receive their
[44:21] requests this night may they take this
[44:24] Mother's testimony and just as an
[44:27] example to show that when you say
[44:29] anything it's finished it's all we have
[44:32] to do is to receive it and act upon it
[44:35] it's a finished work Grant Lord that
[44:38] each one of these letters and these
[44:40] handkerchiefs the people that they're
[44:42] laid up on May they be healed everyone
[44:44] that raise their hands father they may
[44:46] receive their heart's desire we ask it
[44:49] in Jesus name
[44:51] amen you be
[44:54] seated
[44:58] I just wanted to show you the string
[45:00] here that the
[45:02] lady there you
[45:04] are that the little baby's head did
[45:07] shrink as the Lord promises through the
[45:10] Holy Spirit last night isn't he
[45:13] wonderful so gives us so much courage to
[45:16] have faith and
[45:18] believe now when Jesus said to that tree
[45:23] in Mark
[45:24] 11:23
[45:26] no man eateth from thee from henceforth
[45:29] he might not have yelled out while as
[45:32] frankly he was easy about it till his
[45:35] disciples just I think one of them heard
[45:37] him and um it uh when that epileptic uh
[45:43] when it come up before the Lord Jesus
[45:45] the boy had the hardest fit he ever had
[45:47] perhaps fell on the ground like he was
[45:49] dead but he realized that he met someone
[45:52] who had Faith far above those Apostles
[45:55] now I'd like for someone who didn't
[45:56] believe in Divine Healing to watch this
[45:59] Jesus had given them power to cast the
[46:01] spirits out and they had failed not the
[46:04] power had failed but they had failed
[46:06] Jesus told them why could we not cast
[46:08] him out he said because of your
[46:10] unbelief the church still has a power
[46:14] God's never taken his power from the
[46:15] church but the church don't have faith
[46:17] enough to act upon it that's all it's
[46:20] just that simple we try to make it so
[46:23] complicated sometimes but the more
[46:25] simple you make the gospel the more
[46:27] reality you'll have when you just get
[46:29] real simple with it God said so that
[46:32] settles it that's all and just believe
[46:34] it go ahead when Jesus said no man
[46:37] eateth from thee while the leaves are
[46:39] just as pretty and bright as they ever
[46:41] was the bark look the same but way down
[46:44] beneath the ground in those roots the
[46:46] life begin to dwindle away so is it up
[46:48] on a cancer upon any kind of disease
[46:51] that that you might want to think when
[46:54] you can accept God's word word weighed
[46:56] down deep in the roots the cancer may be
[46:59] there your hand may be just as stiff
[47:01] that don't have anything to do with
[47:02] Divine Healing it's if thou can't
[47:05] believe see way down somewhere it's
[47:07] already gone to work Jesus said if you
[47:10] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[47:13] doubt in your heart but believe that
[47:15] what you said will come to pass you can
[47:17] have what you've said isn't that lovely
[47:19] who that come from the Son of God whose
[47:23] words heavens and earth will pass away
[47:26] but now but his words want now the only
[47:28] way that you can do that you've got to
[47:30] have the right objective and the right
[47:32] motive now if I went out here and said
[47:35] I'll show you I can move this mountain
[47:37] be move Mountain it would never move
[47:40] certainly not no matter what I had it's
[47:42] got to be first you've got to find the
[47:44] will of
[47:45] God that's reason using the prayer lines
[47:48] I I get the very hardest is because it's
[47:51] something that's went through lines and
[47:52] so forth and that's where you get it
[47:54] back but see if you've got unconfessed
[47:57] sin did you ever notice on a Case before
[48:00] I asked the evil spirit to leave I
[48:02] watched that case real sure to be
[48:05] certain that there's nothing in that
[48:06] life that would hinder anything see
[48:09] because remember on these gifts you can
[48:11] get in trouble with him God you remember
[48:13] one time gave a prophet made a prophet
[48:16] out of a man Moses and told him go down
[48:19] and speak to the Rock and the prophet
[48:20] was all excited and went out and smok
[48:22] The Rock speaking of the weakness of
[48:25] Christ he'd have to die the second time
[48:27] or be smitten the second time he had
[48:29] power to bring it but it wasn't the will
[48:31] of God I never could believe that it was
[48:34] God's will for Elijah to go around C
[48:37] them children was teasing about being
[48:39] baldheaded I don't think he should have
[48:41] did that but he was a prophet was
[48:43] angered and he put a curse on those
[48:45] children and two she Bears killed 42
[48:48] little innocent children but I don't
[48:50] believe he should have done that and
[48:52] it's
[48:52] just just we God I believe today before
[48:55] he puts his church in power he tries his
[48:58] church to see what it will do we um next
[49:01] time maybe the Lord's willing when I
[49:03] come back we have time to dwell on
[49:04] something like that on something it's
[49:06] fixing to happen and then we'll know
[49:08] more about it then but if you'll just
[49:11] speak the word say Lord I believe it
[49:15] don't doubt mean it in your heart now
[49:18] say for instance I was in a
[49:20] valley and I don't I'm preaching to
[49:23] millions of people but just across the
[49:25] mountain there is a group of people of
[49:28] 100 and they're dying without knowing
[49:30] Christ well I've got a million here to
[49:32] preach to but yet something in my
[49:35] heart's telling me get across to those
[49:36] people get to them they're perishing I
[49:39] don't want to go myself but yet there's
[49:42] something in me see that's God then
[49:44] moving see what the objective is see
[49:47] what the motive is the going not for
[49:49] self now if I say well if uh my objec is
[49:54] right to get over there but then I get
[49:57] up there and here's a big mountain I say
[49:59] you know if I get over that mountain and
[50:00] save all those hundred people someday
[50:02] they'll have a statue there brother
[50:04] brand the great missionary now my motive
[50:06] is not right the mountain won't fall no
[50:09] sir but when my motive and objective is
[50:12] right and God in my heart is leading me
[50:15] and I can't get over the mountain around
[50:17] the mountain Under the Mountain I'd say
[50:19] mountain move maybe when I say that no
[50:23] more than I say it with that kind of of
[50:25] a right Spirit Led of the holy spirit in
[50:29] the will of God there might not be but
[50:31] one little spoonful of that mountain
[50:33] dropped down but it's on its Road the
[50:36] next day there may be a two lbs fall the
[50:39] next day a quarter of a ton and maybe in
[50:42] a month five ton drops in what of it may
[50:46] not even see it yet but she's moving on
[50:48] it road I'll stay right there and watch
[50:50] the thing be done because God said so
[50:53] and that just settles it praise the Lord
[50:55] can you think that about your mother
[50:57] there tonight all right if you'll think
[50:59] it she'll get well all right that's if
[51:01] you just believe it just speak the word
[51:03] and stay with it see just believe it
[51:06] hang on to it it's eternal life now
[51:10] tomorrow afternoon I told Billy uh
[51:15] tonight just to omit the prayer cards
[51:17] and I want to speak
[51:19] I'm confessing in truth I've been going
[51:22] since January overseas and back phich
[51:25] home back and all completely that

[51:36] and they you you Brethren invited me to
[51:39] stay over for some more days how I
[51:41] appreciate that I certainly think that

[56:47] still daddy little girl anyhow and now
[56:50] about another year we won't get her in

[56:58] up for Daddy you know to come home I've
[57:00] been out in the meeting and tomorrow
[57:02] night they'll be waiting until midnight
[57:05] for me to try to get in and uh so I got
[57:09] in real early in the morning around 3 or
[57:11] 4:00 and mother come the door and let me
[57:15] in and I was so tired and weary I here
[57:19] on the platform uh one the anointed it
[57:22] feels fine but when that once leaves you
[57:24] that's where you get in trouble how many
[57:27] ever knew that well sure it is look
[57:30] Elijah went up on the mountain and
[57:31] called fire out of Heaven call Rain Out
[57:34] of Heaven and then when the spirit left
[57:35] him he wandered Into the Wilderness 40
[57:37] days and God found him pulled back in a
[57:38] cave somewhere Jonah he went out and
[57:41] stayed live in a belly of a whale for
[57:43] three days and nights was spit out up on
[57:45] the bank and went around preaching the
[57:47] whole city repented and come to God and
[57:50] when the anointing left him he went up
[57:51] on top of the hill and asked God to take
[57:53] his life see I stand by the side of
[57:56] William kapper's grave not long ago that
[57:58] wrote that famous hymn that we Ed at our
[58:00] communion service there is a fountain
[58:03] filled with blood drawn from emanuel's
[58:05] veins were Sinners plunged beneath the
[58:06] flood did you ever hear what he happened
[58:09] to him at the inspiration left him from
[58:11] that he tried to find the river to
[58:13] commit
[58:14] suicide I lived right across the Old
[58:16] Kentucky Home and Steven's Foster gave
[58:19] America its most famous folk songs and
[58:22] when he write get inspiration up that
[58:24] inspiration write a song then when he
[58:26] come out of it he go get on a drunk
[58:28] finally called a servant and Tu a razor
[58:30] and committed suicide people don't know
[58:32] what those people that live that
[58:34] spiritual realm go through and now hear
[58:36] you feel like you can move a mountain
[58:38] but just let the anointing drop from you
[58:41] start through that door and somebody
[58:42] ain't there to catch you and then maybe
[58:44] for a few hours you hardly wonder where
[58:46] you're at and then night after night
[58:48] that takes the best of you and little
[58:51] want to tell you about little Sarah and
[58:52] Rebecca so the next morning I couldn't
[58:55] sleep and I got up was sitting in the
[58:57] chair and ATA Becky being the oldest she
[59:00] was had longer legs than Sarah and so uh
[59:03] Becky come running woke up jumped out of
[59:06] bed not waking her little sister up here
[59:07] she come through the house running as
[59:09] hard as she could she's saying Daddy
[59:11] Daddy I stuck out one of my legs and she
[59:13] jumped across there pretty well balanced
[59:15] kind of like the the modern Church you
[59:17] know it's been in the game for a long
[59:20] time you know for several hundred years
[59:21] she could balance herself right well and
[59:23] she put her arm around me and said oh my
[59:26] daddy my daddy little Sarah had in the
[59:29] commotion woke up well I don't know
[59:31] where your children does they're not
[59:32] mine do the little younger one gets the
[59:34] hand-me-downs so Sarah had on Becky's
[59:38] pajamas feet about that much too long
[59:40] you know and here she come little bitty
[59:42] short fella falling stumbling and she
[59:44] got there a little late so Becky turned
[59:47] around and said Sarah my sister I want
[59:50] to tell you something she said I was
[59:53] your first and I have the Monopoly so
[59:57] I've got all of Daddy and there's none
[1:00:01] left for
[1:00:03] you that's the way some people try to
[1:00:05] think about religion isn't it that's
[1:00:08] right and poor little Sarah she dropped
[1:00:11] her little lip her little black eyes
[1:00:13] looked up me and she started to cry and
[1:00:15] Becky had her cheek against mine hugging
[1:00:17] me I love her and Sarah started to walk
[1:00:20] away cuz Becky had all a daddy I scooted
[1:00:22] the other knee out like this and motion
[1:00:24] to her like that oh she perked up right
[1:00:26] quick and run jumped up on my knees so
[1:00:30] she hadn't been around very long her
[1:00:32] legs wouldn't even reach the floor she's
[1:00:34] kind of a little tottery perhaps like I
[1:00:37] am just a little totter you know and she
[1:00:40] didn't couldn't reach the floor she
[1:00:42] wasn't a big denomination you know and
[1:00:43] so she couldn't get out on the solid
[1:00:45] floor she hadn't been around long enough
[1:00:48] and so she was kind of tottering and I
[1:00:50] throw both arms around her like this and
[1:00:53] hugged her up close to me
[1:00:55] and she sparkled those little black eyes
[1:00:57] and looked back to Rebecca she said

[1:01:23] him have both arms around it'll just
[1:01:25] make me feel fine well let's offer
[1:01:27] another little word of prayer to him

[1:02:24] granted Lord now no man is able to to
[1:02:29] interpret the word we realize that John
[1:02:33] saw the book in the right hand of him
[1:02:35] that set up on the throne and there was
[1:02:37] no man in heaven or in Earth or beneath
[1:02:40] the Earth that was worthy to take the
[1:02:42] book to open it or to loose the seals
[1:02:46] and there come a lamb up that had been
[1:02:48] slaying since the foundation of the
[1:02:50] world and he was worthy and he took the
[1:02:53] book l Lo the seals and open the book oh
[1:02:58] lamb come tonight open the book To Us
[1:03:01] father as we wait upon thee for we ask
[1:03:04] it in Jesus name the Lamb of God
[1:03:11] Amen I have chosen tonight a little
[1:03:15] scripture verse
[1:03:17] share of three words but first I want to
[1:03:20] read a vers atud out of St John the 11th
[1:03:23] chapter
[1:03:25] beginning with the 23rd
[1:03:29] verse Jesus said unto her thy brother
[1:03:34] shall rise
[1:03:36] again Martha said unto him I know he
[1:03:41] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[1:03:44] the last
[1:03:45] day Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:03:51] resurrection and life he that believeth
[1:03:54] in me me though he were dead yet shall
[1:03:57] he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:03:59] believeth in me shall never die
[1:04:01] believeth thou this she said unto him
[1:04:05] yay Lord I believe that thou art the
[1:04:10] Christ the son of God that should come
[1:04:12] into the
[1:04:14] world and for our text I wish to use
[1:04:17] these three words believest thou
[1:04:22] this I read a story sometime ago I think
[1:04:26] it was a fiction story and most all
[1:04:29] ministers I guess have read Dr Ingram's
[1:04:32] book of um of the prince of the House of
[1:04:35] David it's a great book I think it's
[1:04:39] absolutely out of print I like to have
[1:04:41] it in print so I could put it among the
[1:04:44] people and in there I was reading a
[1:04:47] little article on this Lazareth and Upon
[1:04:52] Jesus and Mary and Martha Marth that the
[1:04:55] sisters of
[1:04:57] Lazarus and I was reading in there that
[1:05:01] word Jesus lived I believe with Martha
[1:05:05] and Mary they were both lovely Hebrew
[1:05:10] girls and Lazarus was learning or
[1:05:14] training to be a scribe at the temple
[1:05:18] making letters of the law for the
[1:05:21] priest and Jesus had
[1:05:24] Great Fellowship especially with Lazarus
[1:05:28] and we read in the book that where he
[1:05:30] did come to their home and Martha was a
[1:05:33] little diler about uh listening to his
[1:05:36] words but she had to get the dinner
[1:05:39] ready and set the table but Mary sat at
[1:05:42] his feet and Jesus said that Mary has
[1:05:46] chosen the better things and
[1:05:49] then we were told that Lazarus was the
[1:05:52] one that brought
[1:05:55] uh uh Jesus to John in the story of Dr
[1:05:59] Ingram's books and uh on the prince the
[1:06:02] House of David however that might not
[1:06:04] have been true I do not know but just
[1:06:07] for the background of it but he was
[1:06:10] supposed to been living with them now
[1:06:12] we've been learning this coming this
[1:06:14] last week rather that Jesus said in St
[1:06:18] John 5:19 I the son can do nothing in
[1:06:23] himself but what he sees the father
[1:06:26] doing that doeth the son likewise the
[1:06:30] father worketh and the son worketh
[1:06:33] hither to see what he sees the father
[1:06:36] doing so to make this really the right
[1:06:40] story The Father God must have spoke to
[1:06:43] his son Jesus and said your friend
[1:06:46] Lazareth is going to die but it's going
[1:06:48] to be for the good so you leave the home
[1:06:51] go away because it'll be asking you to
[1:06:54] pray for him and make him well and and I
[1:06:56] don't want you to do that if you watch
[1:06:58] the story as we go along you'll see it
[1:07:00] heaps up to that very truth of that so
[1:07:04] Jesus just without any warning or
[1:07:07] anything walked away from the house and
[1:07:09] went somewhere else didn't return that
[1:07:11] night and he went to some other cities
[1:07:15] and as soon as Jesus left the
[1:07:19] home then trouble set in and when Jesus
[1:07:24] leaves your home trouble is on its Road
[1:07:28] just remember when he leaves your home
[1:07:31] trouble is on the way when you get
[1:07:34] social societies and everything
[1:07:36] operating in your church so perfectly
[1:07:38] like some great big 16 cylinder Rick and
[1:07:42] Backer and you leave Jesus out of it
[1:07:45] when Jesus goes from your church
[1:07:47] troubles on the road yes sir when Jesus
[1:07:52] leaves a denomination that they lay him
[1:07:55] aside and say well now we just don't
[1:07:57] believe that these things could be just
[1:07:58] exactly right you adopt something else
[1:08:01] troubles on its Road just remember that
[1:08:05] reminds me of a story of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:07] is found in the Book of Luke you know
[1:08:10] when he was just a boy of about 12 years
[1:08:12] old his people taken him as the custom
[1:08:17] was each year up to the Feast of
[1:08:20] Pentecost and while they were in the
[1:08:22] city of Jerusalem uh uh at the feast and
[1:08:25] having a good time we find in the Bible
[1:08:29] that they went three days without him
[1:08:33] and they they thought maybe just took it
[1:08:36] for granted that Jesus must have been
[1:08:39] among some of their kin folks now we
[1:08:42] cannot do that when they come to go
[1:08:45] through their kin folks to find out he
[1:08:47] wasn't there and we can't take it for
[1:08:50] granted just because we're a Methodist
[1:08:53] Baptist Pres Terian Pentecost and our
[1:08:55] backgrounds and our forefathers were
[1:08:58] great Believers we just take it well for
[1:09:00] granted Jesus is with us we can't do
[1:09:03] that we've got to be in contact with him
[1:09:05] every day and every
[1:09:07] minute oh I love that I want what God is
[1:09:13] now what my parents had what my
[1:09:16] forefathers had is wonderful but what
[1:09:19] they had is good I think we're farther
[1:09:21] up the road let's see what he is today I
[1:09:25] don't want to look back and see what Mr
[1:09:26] Moody did because we're farther up the
[1:09:29] road in Mr Moody the trouble of the
[1:09:31] church is we look back and say U well
[1:09:33] let's see what Mr John Wesley said what
[1:09:37] some of the others said that's the
[1:09:39] reason science is so farther in their
[1:09:42] field than religion isn't its here 300
[1:09:45] years ago a French scientist proved that
[1:09:47] if you'd go the terrific speed of 35 M
[1:09:50] hour gravitation would take you off the
[1:09:52] Earth you think science would refer back
[1:09:54] to that today they're going 1,900 M hour
[1:09:58] and still going on they're pressing
[1:10:00] forward looking forward but we want to
[1:10:02] look back and see what Moody said sanki
[1:10:04] said finny said Knox Calvin some of
[1:10:07] those what they said was all right that
[1:10:10] was for their age but we're going on my
[1:10:13] grandfather rode a oxcart I'm driving a
[1:10:15] Ford V8 my son will fly a Jet Plane
[1:10:19] that's where we're moving on that's what
[1:10:21] religion ought to be the coming of the
[1:10:23] Lord is at hand the church ought to be
[1:10:25] moving on into the powers science can
[1:10:28] only climb so far and and it has to drop
[1:10:30] off but we got untapped sources that's
[1:10:34] never been touched of the power
[1:10:37] unlimited of God that we ought to be
[1:10:39] moving
[1:10:40] into we are living a million miles under
[1:10:43] our privilege tonight of privileges of
[1:10:46] Christians to be en Joy I feel ashamed
[1:10:48] of myself when I look out here and see
[1:10:50] the institutions and the sickness and
[1:10:53] the trouble that's going on right now
[1:10:55] our church are be walking the street
[1:10:57] Healing The Sick raising the dead
[1:10:59] casting out Devils doing signs and
[1:11:01] wonders making the whole world realize
[1:11:03] that Jesus Christ lives that's what we
[1:11:06] need to be done doing why do you say Mr
[1:11:08] Moody never Mr Moody wasn't living in
[1:11:10] this day that's right we're living on
[1:11:13] the coming of the Lord and we just took
[1:11:15] it for granted that he was with our kin
[1:11:18] folks but the other day when a
[1:11:20] challenger challenge Mr Grim we found
[1:11:22] out that he was was among our kin
[1:11:26] folks where do they find him where did
[1:11:29] where did they find Jesus right where
[1:11:31] they left
[1:11:33] him where did leave him at the Feast of
[1:11:36] Pentecost where do we leave Jesus where
[1:11:39] did the church at the Feast of Pentecost
[1:11:42] when we get away from that Old Time
[1:11:44] Pentecostal power and the Feast of
[1:11:46] Pentecost we walk away from Jesus that's
[1:11:49] exactly right friend we are living under
[1:11:53] under our privileges yes sir they left
[1:11:57] him at the Feast of Pentecost and
[1:11:59] there's the only place that Methodist
[1:12:01] Baptist Presbyterian and Pentecostals
[1:12:04] will ever find him is go back where
[1:12:06] you're left him at where is the joy of
[1:12:09] the Lord where is the power of the Lord
[1:12:11] the church asked today what what
[1:12:13] happened to the god of History he's
[1:12:15] waiting for his people to call him on
[1:12:17] the scene but we can't do it to
[1:12:20] denominations we can't do it under uh
[1:12:23] psychology we can't do it under
[1:12:26] arithmetic or we can't do it with
[1:12:28] education we separate ourselves divide
[1:12:31] ourselves we are not Divided We are one
[1:12:34] person indeed in Christ Jesus we are all
[1:12:38] one in Christ and our denominations will
[1:12:40] never do it as good as they are they
[1:12:42] won't do it our education is the
[1:12:44] greatest hindrance the gospel ever had
[1:12:46] is education what we need is not
[1:12:49] education we need the power and
[1:12:51] demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in
[1:12:53] the church to demonstrate the power
[1:12:56] Jesus never said go into all the world
[1:12:58] and teach he never said go into all the
[1:13:01] world and he said go into all the world
[1:13:03] and preach the gospel and the gospel is
[1:13:07] to demonstrate the power of the Holy
[1:13:10] Ghost the
[1:13:11] resurrection we're still a million miles
[1:13:13] sharp and where we should be let us move
[1:13:16] forward let's go back where we left him
[1:13:19] at the Feast of Pentecost Jesus said in
[1:13:21] John I'll be the 15th chapter
[1:13:24] he said I am the vine ye are the
[1:13:26] branches well now if that vine put forth
[1:13:29] the first branch and out of that Branch
[1:13:32] wrote a book of
[1:13:33] Acts the second Branch will make another
[1:13:36] book of Acts the third branch will make
[1:13:39] another book of Acts and every branch
[1:13:42] that comes out of that vine will be the
[1:13:44] same as the first Branch was now you can
[1:13:48] draft we know that I've seen a citrus
[1:13:51] tree with about eight different kinds of
[1:13:52] fruit on it I've seen an orange tree
[1:13:55] putting grapefruits and lemons and
[1:13:56] everything else on it but they were
[1:13:58] drafted in that's what's the matter
[1:14:00] today we've drafted in our ideas drafted
[1:14:03] in our denominations but if that tree
[1:14:05] ever puts forth another fruit Vine
[1:14:07] itself it'll be like the original was it
[1:14:09] went it hallelujah oh church WIll blend
[1:14:14] together but we need the power of the
[1:14:16] original we need the Holy Ghost the
[1:14:20] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:14:22] Christ that's what he told us to do I am
[1:14:25] the vine ye are the branches if a grape
[1:14:28] vine puts forth a Shute it comes out
[1:14:30] with pretty blue grapes the next Vine it
[1:14:33] brings out will have pretty blue grapes
[1:14:35] on it if the first Vine come out and
[1:14:38] they fell under the impact of the Holy
[1:14:40] Spirit and they did great Miracles and
[1:14:43] signs and sealer testimony to a world
[1:14:47] even many of them with their own
[1:14:49] testimony they with their blood they
[1:14:51] seal their testimony they went through
[1:14:53] all kinds of perils and everything to
[1:14:56] bring the gospel they suffered they were
[1:14:58] beaten they were punished must we be
[1:15:01] carried home to heaven on a fly bed of
[1:15:03] ease While others fought to win the
[1:15:05] prize and sail through bloody Seas what
[1:15:08] do we expect to do I must fight if I
[1:15:11] must Reign increase my courage Lord
[1:15:13] certainly we need a we don't need a new
[1:15:16] denomination we don't need a new church
[1:15:18] building what we need today is an old
[1:15:20] time Backwoods sky sin killing
[1:15:24] Pentecostal Revival that was born in
[1:15:27] Pentecost and back into the church again
[1:15:29] the power of the Holy Ghost again to
[1:15:31] bring Jesus on the scene the god of
[1:15:35] History always Rises on the scene in a
[1:15:37] crucial moment we need it that's what's
[1:15:40] a matter church today we're getting too
[1:15:43] far back we're falling into the passions
[1:15:45] of the world gradually year by year it
[1:15:47] begins to die a little and wither away
[1:15:50] it's pruning time pretty soon God will
[1:15:53] cut it back as sure as I'm standing this
[1:15:54] pit God will cut her back to make her
[1:15:57] bear fruit he'll cut the works of the
[1:15:59] world out of it one of these
[1:16:01] days such a disgrace the way the church
[1:16:04] has carried on under the name of
[1:16:06] religion and we find out when Jesus left
[1:16:11] death set in when Jesus leaves our
[1:16:14] church the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:16] leaves our church it begins to dwindle
[1:16:18] and and die and after while there's
[1:16:21] nothing more to it now when Jesus left
[1:16:24] death set in Oh What a Sad time it was
[1:16:28] and notice they wandered around and they
[1:16:31] sent for Jesus but he didn't come they
[1:16:35] sent for him again and he didn't come
[1:16:37] but he know what he was going to do he
[1:16:40] knows tonight what he's going to do it's
[1:16:42] not lost with him he knows exactly what
[1:16:45] he's fixing to do he's going to raise up
[1:16:48] people up this as certain as I'm
[1:16:49] standing this pit he'll raise up people
[1:16:52] for his name's sake now the Gentile
[1:16:54] generation he'll do it the Jews times
[1:16:57] right at hand now and the Gentiles are
[1:17:00] ending out because they just went on out
[1:17:02] they're rejecting Christ they're
[1:17:04] rejecting their signs they're rejecting
[1:17:06] everything is called Godly and branded
[1:17:08] is some kind of telepathy or devil power
[1:17:11] and do they're blaspheming the Holy
[1:17:13] Ghost and sealing themselves away from
[1:17:15] God and God will take that Minority
[1:17:18] after a while and raise it up into a
[1:17:19] powerful church and then turn the spirit
[1:17:21] to the Jews and take the Gentile Church
[1:17:23] home exactly right she's in the making
[1:17:26] now wow we're at the end time nearly
[1:17:30] Jesus he knew and after a while he said
[1:17:32] our friend Lazarus sleepeth while the
[1:17:35] disciples thought he was taking a little
[1:17:37] rest he said well if he's asleeping he's
[1:17:40] doing very well well he said in his
[1:17:43] their words so that they would
[1:17:45] understand said he's dead and for your
[1:17:48] sake I'm glad I wasn't there see for
[1:17:52] your sake say I'm glad I wasn't there
[1:17:54] because they' been asking him to to heal
[1:17:58] the healing but he know he couldn't do
[1:17:59] it because the vision was yet after
[1:18:01] those four days he know that was the
[1:18:03] time the father told him how beautifully
[1:18:05] set the grave father I thank the as I
[1:18:08] was already heard but I just say it for
[1:18:09] these that stands
[1:18:11] by he already know what he was going to
[1:18:13] do he said I'll go wake him now I can
[1:18:16] imagine that little home was really
[1:18:18] broken up the bread winter gone sadness
[1:18:22] oh it's one ful when you got a sad home
[1:18:24] or a sad heart then Jesus appears all at
[1:18:27] once isn't it I can imagine seeing
[1:18:29] Martha a beautiful little woman with the
[1:18:31] Black Veil over her face a little Mary
[1:18:34] and them holding one another saying what
[1:18:35] will we do Papa and Mama's Gone and our
[1:18:38] precious brother now we have left the
[1:18:41] church and we're excommunicated from
[1:18:43] them and come out to follow Jesus of
[1:18:45] Nazareth and he's pulled away and left
[1:18:47] us somewhere I can hear a Critic come by
[1:18:49] and say Hey where's that Divine healer
[1:18:52] that prophet of Galilee where's he at
[1:18:54] now see when it really comes the time
[1:18:56] for him to do something he's gone there
[1:18:59] it is see God just loves to do that just
[1:19:01] to let people just let people show what
[1:19:04] they are just trying them to see what
[1:19:06] they really are he gives them a blessing
[1:19:09] he appears shows himself introduces
[1:19:12] himself to the people just to see what
[1:19:14] kind of a reaction they'll take just to
[1:19:16] see what they'll do about it now we find
[1:19:19] that after uh a few days four days poor
[1:19:23] Lazarus was dead they bued him second
[1:19:26] day Third Day fourth day now anyone
[1:19:29] knows corruption sets in after 3 days
[1:19:33] the nose falls in on the face first and
[1:19:36] then corruption sets in the skin worms
[1:19:39] begins to eat the body they laid him in
[1:19:41] the ground put a big rock over the top
[1:19:43] of the cave where they had him and every
[1:19:45] once in a while the young girls that go
[1:19:47] out and kneel down the grave and cry
[1:19:50] after a while the news got around Jesus
[1:19:53] has come we've seen him moving into the
[1:19:56] city oh that little Martha that had been
[1:20:00] so seemingly so dilit about it she
[1:20:03] proved then what she was made out of
[1:20:05] here she comes she's coming on her road
[1:20:06] then run out seeking I can hear some of
[1:20:09] them along the road say well I guess
[1:20:10] you're satisfied now that your religion
[1:20:13] was false she just ignored them and went
[1:20:15] on past out on by all the critics she
[1:20:18] went down till she seen him maybe
[1:20:20] sitting down at the street corner
[1:20:23] now it's seemingly she must she might
[1:20:25] have had a right to uaid him and and
[1:20:27] speak evil to him why she didn't run and
[1:20:30] say look at here look at here you you're
[1:20:33] supposed to be a prophet a man of God
[1:20:36] why didn't you come when we called you
[1:20:38] why we're the life and stock of the town
[1:20:40] now we come out of our church to follow
[1:20:42] you seemed like she had a right but you
[1:20:45] know just like I preached on the lamb
[1:20:46] and Dove if we're a lamb a lamb forfeits
[1:20:50] every right he's got it's exactly right
[1:20:52] right he ain't got nothing but wool so
[1:20:54] he has to Forfeit that and you forfeit
[1:20:57] every right that you've got to serve God
[1:20:59] that's exactly right I was getting after
[1:21:02] women about the way they's wearing these
[1:21:03] little old clothes you know and they
[1:21:05] said well we're we're Americans we can
[1:21:07] do what we want to I said that's exactly
[1:21:09] right but if you're a lamb you'll
[1:21:10] forfeit your rights smoking cigarettes
[1:21:12] and carrying all like that that's the
[1:21:14] worst thing a woman ever done exactly
[1:21:16] right a lady said to me not long ago
[1:21:19] talking you said brother brandom they
[1:21:20] don't make no other kind of clothes I
[1:21:22] said they still make sewing machines and
[1:21:24] sell Goods there's no excuse for at all
[1:21:26] exactly
[1:21:28] right remember someday you may be pure
[1:21:31] here to your husband but you'll answer
[1:21:33] for adultery part this is certainly
[1:21:35] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[1:21:37] after her has committed adultery with
[1:21:39] her already in his heart what's the
[1:21:42] matter with the Pentecostal women today
[1:21:44] is what I'm a wondering how you have got
[1:21:46] away from the old hu line how your
[1:21:49] mothers used to wear long hair and today
[1:21:51] the Pentecost women Cain up like a bunch
[1:21:53] of mudy GRS and cut their hair and wear
[1:21:55] their little Shar clothes like that just
[1:21:57] like the rest of the we get out and mold
[1:21:59] the yard in the afternoon when man's
[1:22:00] coming by do you realize woman that
[1:22:03] you're going to have to answer for
[1:22:04] committing adultery without that man you
[1:22:06] present yourself to them for that
[1:22:09] purpose it's a evil spirit on the church
[1:22:11] and the people and they don't know it
[1:22:13] blind and don't know it the
[1:22:17] truth maybe you might say I haven't got
[1:22:19] a right to say that as evangelist well I
[1:22:21] I have to follow the leading of the Holy
[1:22:22] SP that's all I can say you know if I
[1:22:25] meet you judgment then I won't have to
[1:22:27] have your blood on my hands get away
[1:22:29] from every bit of the ground that looks
[1:22:31] like Satan stay away from it get come I
[1:22:34] don't care how many television stars
[1:22:36] you're not here a television star you're
[1:22:38] a daughter of
[1:22:40] God preaching in the pastor's Church the
[1:22:42] other morning about an old slave time is
[1:22:46] selling slaves long ago and they used to
[1:22:49] come by and buy them on the auction and
[1:22:51] the people were they're weeping crying
[1:22:54] because they're Homeland they never go
[1:22:56] back no more and they had to whip them
[1:22:58] and they'd buy them just like you'd buy
[1:22:59] an automobile just for anything with
[1:23:02] prices and selling them human beings and
[1:23:04] one day a buyer come byy a broker to a
[1:23:07] big found a big Plantation rather and he
[1:23:09] said how many slaves you got for sale
[1:23:12] said well he got some to swap they try
[1:23:13] to get them big take them mothers
[1:23:16] fathers if the woman he had married was
[1:23:18] a little weakly woman take these big
[1:23:20] healthy men and breed them like horses
[1:23:22] animals never was right God made man man
[1:23:27] made slaves not right to begin with
[1:23:30] never God don't intend any man to be a
[1:23:32] slave no sir and no watch what taking
[1:23:35] place then in the midst of all that this
[1:23:37] fell said well I'd like to buy some that
[1:23:40] he notice one young fellow there they
[1:23:41] didn't have to whip him his chin was up
[1:23:44] head up just like a real gentleman
[1:23:46] walking around and that broker said I'd
[1:23:48] like to buy him he said but he's not for
[1:23:50] sale he said well why said is he the
[1:23:53] boss he said he's a slave well said why
[1:23:56] do you feed him better than you do the
[1:23:58] rest of him he said no he eats out there
[1:24:00] in the galley with the rest of them he's
[1:24:02] a slave said what makes him so much
[1:24:04] different in the rest of them and the
[1:24:06] boss said I wondered that myself for a
[1:24:09] long time but one day I found out over
[1:24:12] in the Homeland his father is a king of
[1:24:15] the tribe and though he's an alien away
[1:24:18] from home he still knows he's a King's
[1:24:20] son and he conducts himself like one if
[1:24:24] if an African lady could realize that
[1:24:26] his father is a king and over here an
[1:24:29] alien in a Strange Land can still know
[1:24:31] that across the sea he's a King's son
[1:24:33] how art women and men conduct themselves
[1:24:36] when you're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:24:38] act like it certainly conduct yourself
[1:24:42] clean up yourselves and act like Sons
[1:24:44] and Daughters of God wonder what a
[1:24:48] condition here we are oh Little Martha
[1:24:52] come running out she looked like she had
[1:24:53] a a way to have said something against
[1:24:56] him why didn't you come to my brother
[1:24:58] look what we've done for you and you let
[1:25:00] us down well if she had have said that
[1:25:02] the story never would have finished the
[1:25:04] way it
[1:25:05] did it's the way you approach a Divine
[1:25:08] gift of God if God sends a gift you got
[1:25:11] to approach it right if you're ever
[1:25:12] expect to get anything from it you've
[1:25:15] got to approach it right and Martha knew
[1:25:18] that she'd probably read about the
[1:25:20] shunamite woman and her baby and if that
[1:25:22] shite woman knew that God was in Elijah
[1:25:25] how much more was he in Jesus sure so
[1:25:28] she went up with the right approach she
[1:25:30] run up and fell down at his feet I like
[1:25:34] that fell down at his feet and said Lord
[1:25:37] that's his right title that's what he
[1:25:39] was he was her Lord Lord if thou would
[1:25:43] have been here my brother would not have
[1:25:46] died oh my oh I could just imagine
[1:25:50] seeing his great heart as he looked at
[1:25:51] that beautiful woman with tears running
[1:25:53] down her cheeks said Lord if you'd have
[1:25:56] been here my brother would not have died
[1:25:59] watch what she said but even now
[1:26:03] Lord though he's dead though the skin
[1:26:06] worms is crawling through his body even
[1:26:10] now Lord whatever you ask God God will
[1:26:13] give it to you oh that's the
[1:26:17] secret you might say I've seen through
[1:26:19] every hospital the doctor says I'm going
[1:26:21] to die but e even now Lord I'm all CED
[1:26:25] up with the arthritis I can't move but
[1:26:27] even now Lord that little baby had a
[1:26:30] Waterhead that big around last night
[1:26:32] there's nothing he do it spread on out
[1:26:33] and burst his little head and die but
[1:26:35] even now Lord he's still the same God
[1:26:39] he's still the same Lord even now Lord
[1:26:43] and he's sitting at the right hand of
[1:26:46] God Almighty making intercessions upon
[1:26:49] the things that we claim that he's done
[1:26:51] for us
[1:26:53] now I really feel religious sure I do
[1:26:55] you're going to call me a Holy Roller
[1:26:57] anyhow so you might as well get started
[1:26:58] and get it over with so yes sir even now
[1:27:03] Lord whatever you ask God God will do it
[1:27:05] ask the father anything in my name I'll
[1:27:07] do it Jesus said even now Lord whatever
[1:27:11] you ask God will give it to you oh that
[1:27:13] must have turned in his great heart he
[1:27:16] said thy brother shall live again she
[1:27:19] said y Lord he'll live he was a good boy
[1:27:22] he'll come forth in the general
[1:27:24] Resurrection at the last day them Jews
[1:27:26] believe in the general Resurrection
[1:27:28] he'll come forth in the Resurrection The
[1:27:30] Last Days look at him he pulled his
[1:27:32] little self together he said I am the
[1:27:35] resurrection
[1:27:37] life oh my there never was a man can say
[1:27:40] that before there never will be one
[1:27:43] afterward can say it he's the only one
[1:27:45] that can say I am the resurrection and
[1:27:49] life sayth the Lord he that believeth in
[1:27:52] me though he were dead yet shall he
[1:27:56] live and whosoever liveth and believeth
[1:27:58] in me shall never die believest thou
[1:28:02] this she said yay Lord oh she know
[1:28:05] something is fixing to hat has to be
[1:28:08] When Faith from an honest heart meets
[1:28:11] God them cogs just comes together like

[1:28:19] name of Jesus Christ let your faith
[1:28:21] connect with God like in a few minutes
[1:28:22] we'll have other
[1:28:25] V there will be such a Revival break in
[1:28:28] this town there would be enough cops in
[1:28:29] the country to keep them down that's
[1:28:32] right there will be a real
[1:28:34] Revival even now Lord well Lord we've
[1:28:37] done call off in this we've did this and
[1:28:39] did that I don't care what you've done
[1:28:41] even now Lord he's waiting for you to
[1:28:44] call on him believe us now this sure es
[1:28:49] sir even now whatever you ask him where
[1:28:51] have you laid him now he goes down to
[1:28:54] the Grave he was man enough to cry he
[1:28:58] was God enough to raise the dead here's
[1:29:00] sometime ago a woman that belongs to a
[1:29:02] certain group of people I never make it
[1:29:04] a habit to make about denominations but
[1:29:07] this woman they do not believe that
[1:29:09] Jesus was divine they said he was just a
[1:29:12] prophet now he was if he is just a
[1:29:14] prophet we're all in sin he was either
[1:29:17] God nothing less than God or the biggest
[1:29:20] deceiver the world ever had that's right
[1:29:23] he was more than a man she said he
[1:29:25] wasn't Divine there's so much of that in
[1:29:26] this social gospel today trying to make
[1:29:28] Jesus Christ a prophet why he was a god
[1:29:32] of the prophets sure he was she said I
[1:29:35] prove it to you for your Bible he was
[1:29:37] just a man I said you do it and she said
[1:29:40] when he went to the grave of Lazarus the
[1:29:42] Bible said he wept he had to be martal
[1:29:44] or he couldn't weep I said lady is that
[1:29:47] your scripture I don't mean to be
[1:29:49] sacrilegious here to say this but I'll
[1:29:51] tell you what I told her she said that's
[1:29:52] it I said that statement is weaker than
[1:29:55] the broth made out of a shadow of a
[1:29:57] chicken that starve to death I said well
[1:29:59] you you haven't got one thing to stand
[1:30:01] on she said why he wept that showed he
[1:30:04] was Mortal I said he was both mortal and
[1:30:07] Immortal he was God in flesh she said
[1:30:10] all nonsense I said he went to the Grave
[1:30:13] weeping that's true enough but when he
[1:30:15] straighten his little self up the Bible
[1:30:17] said there wasn't much to look upon him
[1:30:19] no Beauty we should desire him but when
[1:30:21] he F them little shoulders back and said
[1:30:22] Lazareth come forth and a man had been
[1:30:26] dead 4 days and rotten in the grave he
[1:30:29] came forth that was more than a
[1:30:32] man show me the man you knew it what was
[1:30:36] it corruption knew its Master life knew
[1:30:39] its creator something had to happen he
[1:30:42] spoke and a man that was dead and in the
[1:30:45] grave for 4 days raised again stood on
[1:30:47] his feet and
[1:30:49] liveed
[1:30:50] Hallelujah that was God in his
[1:30:53] son yes
[1:30:55] sir that was God making himself known
[1:30:58] through his son that was God speaking
[1:31:00] not a man he was a man when he looked
[1:31:04] around on that tree that day for
[1:31:05] something to eat that was a man but when
[1:31:08] he took five biscuits and two fish and
[1:31:10] fed
[1:31:11] 5,000 that was more than a man that was
[1:31:15] God was more than a prophet more than a
[1:31:19] man he was the god man sure he laid on
[1:31:23] the back of that little boat that night
[1:31:25] and the Seas roaring and bouncing like a
[1:31:29] bottle stoer out there in that Mighty
[1:31:31] Sea when 10,000 Devils of the sea swore
[1:31:34] they had drowned him that night he was a
[1:31:36] man weak and TI from praying for the
[1:31:38] sick laying back there and the wind
[1:31:40] didn't even disturb him he was a man
[1:31:42] when he was asleep when he woke up put
[1:31:45] his foot upon the bra of the boat looked
[1:31:47] up and said peace be still and the winds
[1:31:50] and the waves obeyed him that was more
[1:31:52] than a man that was God in man making
[1:31:56] himself known that's right he was a man
[1:31:59] at the cross when he cried for Mercy
[1:32:01] when he cried said I thirst that was a
[1:32:03] man when he died he was a man but on
[1:32:06] Easter morning when he broke the seals
[1:32:08] of death hell in the grave and rose
[1:32:11] again he was more than a man
[1:32:16] God no one of the for said living he
[1:32:19] loved me dying he saved me there he
