[3:10] Amen. That's our prayer tonight. Amen.
[3:13] That's our prayer for our life
[3:15] &gt;&gt; that the beauty of Jesus be seen
[3:18] &gt;&gt; in me. Let us pray. Lord Jesus,
[3:23] oh God, we come to this portion of the
[3:24] service tonight.
[3:26] Will you bless us once again Lord your
[3:29] presence give us what we have need of
[3:32] Lord for the journey is our prayer as
[3:35] humble as it may be or as simple as it
[3:39] may seem Lord.
[3:41] Father, let the word of God settle into
[3:45] our hearts like never before tonight, oh
[3:48] God, that we receive from you. Father,
[3:53] we look to you, the author and the
[3:55] finisher of our faith. Lord, we don't
[3:58] look to the left or to the right. We
[4:00] look to you, Lord, to move forward. As
[4:03] our brother is singing there, we're
[4:04] almost home. It's any day now. A few
[4:08] more turns in the road and we'll be out
[4:11] of here.
[4:12] Prophecies are being fulfilled, Lord.
[4:14] Every moment
[4:16] we see what's happening in Israel, the
[4:19] time piece. We see our nation, see the
[4:23] church. Then Lord, we look at our lives
[4:26] and we know we need something from you
[4:29] &gt;&gt; to have rapturing faith. Lord,
[4:32] &gt;&gt; that is the requirement for the rapture
[4:34] is to have rapturing faith. And we need
[4:38] that tonight, Lord.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; That's what our heart's desire is above
[4:43] anything else. And Lord, I just pray
[4:46] that we move one step closer to that. I
[4:49] believe, Lord, many of us have more than
[4:52] perhaps we realize.
[4:54] You've been so good to us.
[4:57] When the pressure comes and the squeeze
[4:59] comes, I believe we have more than what
[5:02] we realize.
[5:04] Lord, reveal it to us even greater
[5:07] the things that you've been doing all
[5:09] these years, building it up, making it
[5:11] up. Let it be tonight, Lord, another
[5:15] piece of the puzzle of our lives being
[5:17] unfolded that we'll know who we are and
[5:20] where we stand.
[5:22] Oh God, let it be is our prayer.
[5:26] We stand the test, Lord, to not move
[5:30] from that position that you called us
[5:32] to.
[5:34] Lord, we just know any day now.
[5:37] Just please help us. We pray. Get into
[5:40] the word, Lord, now and begin to
[5:43] minister to our needs. We ask from the
[5:46] young ones, even the old ones, even the
[5:49] youngest ones, even the oldest ones.
[5:52] Lord just grant it. I pray. It's in
[5:55] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[5:58] [Music]
[5:59] Oh thou
[6:02] spit divine
[6:05] all my nature refined
[6:10] till
[6:13] you did not Jesus be se
[6:21] welcome to the house of the Lord saints
[6:23] that song really blessed me that song
[6:25] Levi sanguh Wednesday night the The last
[6:28] one really blessed me too. They all
[6:29] blessed me, but that one really kind of
[6:32] touched my heart there. Worshiping the
[6:34] Lord. And this one here, too, as we sing
[6:38] to the great spirit divine. Amen.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; I'd like to go to the word of the Lord.
[6:42] Brother Bobby, is this your last week
[6:44] here?
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Two more. Okay. So, we want to make sure
[6:50] we can say uh goodbye or something
[6:53] properly to you. All right.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Good to have you. We love how many you
[6:57] love brother Bobby and sister camera.
[7:04] They start looking at each other and
[7:05] looking at
[7:08] the spotlight on them. All right. So,
[7:11] tonight we'll just take a few moments
[7:12] and we'll go into the scripture. If
[7:14] you'll take your Bibles and turn with me
[7:16] to uh First Kings chapter 19 and stand,
[7:21] we'll read the word here.
[7:27] There was a funeral in um Mesa today.
[7:30] Brother David Carpenter, he's brother
[7:32] Carpenters's last sibling. I believe the
[7:34] youngest last one remaining. Is that
[7:37] right? I think so. He passed and they
[7:40] had that funeral today at 2 or 2:30
[7:42] there at the Mesa Church. So, that
[7:44] service is cancelled. But we want to
[7:46] pray for that family.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Lord will brother Lee and I forget Lee's
[7:52] sister's name.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Julie. Julie. Yes. And that grandkids
[7:56] and all of that. The Lord will bless
[7:59] them and help them along. Amen.
[8:03] First Kings 19. Let's start with verse
[8:07] number 13. And it was so when Elijah
[8:09] heard it that he wrapped his face in his
[8:12] mantle and went out and stood in the
[8:14] entering in of the cave. And behold,
[8:17] there came a voice unto him and said,
[8:19] "What do thou hear, Elijah?
[8:23] And he said, "I have been very jealous
[8:25] for the Lord God of hosts, because the
[8:27] children of Israel have forsaken thy
[8:29] covenant, thrown down thine altars, and
[8:32] slain thy prophets with the sword, and
[8:36] I, even I only am left." And they seek
[8:40] my life to take it away. And the Lord
[8:42] said unto him, "Go return unto thy way
[8:45] to the wilderness of Damascus. And when
[8:48] thou comest, anoint Hazel to be king of
[8:51] Syria, and Johi
[8:55] shalt thou anoint to be king over
[8:56] Israel. And Elisha the son of Sheaphhat
[9:00] of Abel Mihah shalt thou anoint to be
[9:03] prophet in thy room. And it shall come
[9:06] to pass that him that escaped the sword
[9:09] of Hazel shall Jahu slay. him that
[9:12] escape from the sword of Jahus shall
[9:14] Elisha slay.
[9:16] I'm sorry. Hes shall Ju slay. In him
[9:20] that escaped from the sword of Jahus
[9:22] shall Elisha slay. Yet I have left me
[9:26] 7,000 in Israel,
[9:28] all the knees which have not bowed unto
[9:31] Baal, and every mouth which hath not
[9:35] kissed him. So he departed thence
[9:38] and found Elisha
[9:41] the son of Sheaphat who was plowing with
[9:44] 12 yolk of oxen before him and he with
[9:47] the 12th. Elijah passed by him and cast
[9:51] his mantle upon him and he left the oxen
[9:54] and ran after Elijah and says let me I
[9:59] pray thee kiss my father and my mother
[10:02] and then I will follow thee. And he said
[10:04] unto him, "Go back again, for what have
[10:07] I done to thee?" And he returned back
[10:10] from him, took a yolk of oxen, slew
[10:13] them, boiled their flesh with the
[10:16] instruments of the oxen, and gave unto
[10:18] the people, and they did eat. Then he
[10:21] arose, and went after Elijah, and
[10:24] ministered unto him. Amen. We'll take
[10:27] one more scripture in Mark chapter 1
[10:30] again.
[10:41] Let's take actually uh Matthew chapter 7
[10:44] verse 29.
[10:49] Matthew 7:29.
[10:55] It's pretty much saying the same thing
[10:57] as Mark 1, but I wanted to take this
[10:59] one. For he taught them as one having
[11:01] authority and not as the scribes.
[11:06] Lord Jesus, we pray you'll bless your
[11:07] word today. This portion of the word
[11:10] again, Lord, may it uh touch every heart
[11:13] is our prayer. We know that your word
[11:16] will not return void. It has power in it
[11:19] in it all by itself. And you just ask us
[11:23] to believe it, Lord. Father, strike our
[11:26] faith that we can believe it and that we
[11:29] will believe it. In Jesus name we pray.
[11:31] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[11:34] We've been talking about authority. That
[11:36] was my title this morning, authority.
[11:39] But we've been on these orders of
[11:41] adoption. And so we got into this Roman
[11:45] centurion and Jarius, the believer who
[11:49] was a worker in the house in the
[11:53] synagogue.
[11:54] And the prophet of God is bringing to us
[11:58] bringing to us that this Jarius was
[12:01] taught as a Jew to lay hands and have to
[12:06] as a Jewish custom to have hands laid
[12:09] upon him and the need that he needed he
[12:12] needed hands laid upon him. But brother
[12:14] Random tells us that the gentile the
[12:18] Roman centurion was taught authority.
[12:23] And so the Lord takes this uh kind of a
[12:27] natural or carnal discipline of
[12:31] operation and he uses that uh to get a
[12:36] point across to us that this man when he
[12:39] finally came to Jesus they both went to
[12:42] the right place. They both had the right
[12:44] approach but the way they got what they
[12:47] needed was quite different. The gentile
[12:52] claimed that all you have to do is speak
[12:55] a word Lord and my servant will live.
[13:00] And he was speaking of the authority
[13:01] that Jesus had. He recognizes he
[13:04] recognized his authority. And this
[13:07] authority is what the prophet said that
[13:09] God is trying to get the church to. He's
[13:13] trying to teach the believers to have
[13:16] this kind of a faith. I believe that's
[13:18] the kind of faith we need in this hour.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; And I believe and I thank God for the
[13:23] for the the other faith and the other
[13:25] things that will bring us to and through
[13:28] and the helps that we have like you know
[13:30] special meetings are help and youth
[13:33] meetings are health and Bible studies
[13:35] and you know the different things that
[13:37] are associated with church. Um but we
[13:41] know that the believer will stay with
[13:44] the word no matter what the conditions
[13:46] are.
[13:47] You can put them in some place that's
[13:50] dysfunctional and a believer is going to
[13:53] hold his testimony.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; If he has to keep it by himself, he'll
[13:57] keep it by himself. And that's what you
[13:59] and I are. We are true believers. And
[14:02] this is where our faith is. And this is
[14:04] what we're trying to encourage you
[14:06] towards today as we see things change
[14:08] right before us. I've never seen a day
[14:10] like this day. and um so many changes in
[14:15] the message in the world and the things
[14:17] around us and so it requires a
[14:20] tremendous faith. Amen.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; And so many hearts are discouraged but
[14:24] this is not the time to be discouraged.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; This is the time to be encouraged. Amen.
[14:31] Amen. So Lord help us. Now the prophet
[14:34] as we stopped off the angel versus a
[14:37] son. Brother Bannon makes this statement
[14:39] here in kinsman redeemer and he makes
[14:42] this statement. He says now sons and
[14:44] daughters who has the most power before
[14:47] God.
[14:49] What is an angel? He says an angel is a
[14:52] servant. That's right. They're his
[14:55] servants. What are you? His son and
[14:58] daughter. Who has the most power in
[15:01] heaven?
[15:03] Uh uh
[15:05] who has the most power in heaven then? A
[15:07] sinner that's been saved by grace or an
[15:10] archangel that's standing by his right
[15:12] side. The sinner that's been saved by
[15:15] grace has it say being said that so we
[15:18] can understand who we are as sons and
[15:23] daughters of God. Our authority in
[15:26] heaven is greater than that of an
[15:29] archangel. Amen.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, you got to internalize that and
[15:33] think that through. It's greater. Our
[15:36] authority on the earth is greater. Our
[15:39] authority as a son is greater. When a
[15:42] sinner gets down and you get down on
[15:44] your knees to pray and your little heart
[15:46] is hurting for whatever it's hurting for
[15:49] or you have a request in your life,
[15:51] which we all do, that authority that you
[15:54] come with is the highest of all of God's
[15:58] creation. is that relationship that he's
[16:00] ha that he made with you and that
[16:03] covenant that he's made with you. You
[16:05] know, the whole world and the ecosystem
[16:06] and the solar system and all of the
[16:08] systems that makes the world go around
[16:10] and do what it does, there's nothing
[16:13] more important than a true believer. In
[16:17] fact, if you take the believers out,
[16:20] your city's going down. It is the
[16:23] righteousness of the believers that's
[16:26] keeping the judgments off of the city
[16:28] that you live in. Remember Abraham with
[16:31] Lot.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Lord was going to destroy that city. And
[16:34] he says, "Lord," Abraham asked, "Lord,
[16:36] would you destroy the righteous with the
[16:39] wicked?" And the Lord says, "No, I
[16:41] won't. If there's 10 there, if there's
[16:44] five, if there's 50 people in the wicked
[16:46] city, would you save that city?" The
[16:47] Lord said, "I'll save the city for 50
[16:50] righteous." What about 40? What about
[16:52] 45? What about 30, Lord? What about 10?
[16:56] And he just And quickly you begin to
[16:58] know it's not about the number of
[17:00] righteous. It says, "Is there any
[17:03] righteous?"
[17:04] &gt;&gt; And if there's any righteous, the Lord's
[17:06] got his eye upon them. And he says, "I
[17:08] will not destroy the righteous with the
[17:11] wicked."
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. And so we thank and we thank
[17:17] the Lord for all the protections police
[17:19] department and the the state police and
[17:22] and all of our nuclear whatever we have.
[17:25] That's not what holding this nation
[17:26] together. It's the believers. It's those
[17:30] that have the fear of the Lord. And so
[17:34] this um is what the prophet is trying to
[17:38] bring to us to to and I and you just
[17:42] have to ask yourself why would he's make
[17:44] making this such a strong comparison. I
[17:46] think if I saw an angel run through here
[17:49] or standing near me or somewhere like
[17:52] this, I would probably be very afraid,
[17:54] wouldn't you? I would probably
[17:57] want to get out of there or for whatever
[18:00] reason because that's a little too much.
[18:02] I I'm used to just the natural things.
[18:05] But the reality is is that the angels of
[18:08] God are encamped around those that fear
[18:11] him.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; We can't see them, but we can feel their
[18:18] presence and their influence if we look
[18:20] real good.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; We're just real just conscious just a
[18:24] little bit. The angels are present with
[18:25] us. And God has used these angels for
[18:28] many reasons throughout history through
[18:30] the Bible. But here the prophet now is
[18:33] taking these strong statements and
[18:35] saying who has more authority in heaven.
[18:40] So the angel wants something and the son
[18:42] wants something. God uh the prophet
[18:44] tells us that the believer has more
[18:47] authority than an angel. Beautiful.
[18:52] And he says
[18:54] they're his servants. What are you? His
[18:56] son and daughter. Who has the most power
[18:59] in heaven then? The sinner that's been
[19:01] saved by grace or an archangel that's
[19:03] standing by his right side. The sinner
[19:06] that's been saved by grace has more
[19:08] authority in heaven than the archangel
[19:10] that stood by his side without sin cuz
[19:13] he's a son. Son has more authority than
[19:17] a servant. Of course. Oh, we forget what
[19:20] we are. We forget many times what made
[19:23] us what we are. After we become what we
[19:26] are, then we forget how we got here.
[19:31] Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Prophet continues in the same thought in
[19:35] Revelations chapter 4 1961. He says,
[19:38] "Now is an angel a higher order than a
[19:42] man or a lower order?"
[19:45] The congregation answers him obviously.
[19:47] He says, "All right, sir. Which is the
[19:49] greatest, a son of God or an angel?" Son
[19:53] of God. Which would God hear the best?
[19:56] An angel standing there before him
[19:58] pleading for something or one of you all
[20:01] pleading?
[20:03] One of you all. See, cuz your sons and
[20:06] daughters, they're they're servants.
[20:09] See, they're servants and your sons and
[20:12] daughters. So, we see what authority you
[20:15] have. We're just afraid to use it. Now,
[20:19] these are not my words. This is the
[20:21] words of the seventh angel.
[20:23] He said, "This is the authority that we
[20:26] have.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; This is what been given to us. You have
[20:29] that authority.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, you have it right here in Tucson.
[20:33] You have it right on your job. Wherever
[20:36] you're going, you're a son of God.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; That's the high point.
[20:42] It's that's the highest point. You made
[20:44] it, sister. You made it, my brother.
[20:47] You're a son of God." Yes.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; And that authority of all of heaven is
[20:53] behind you.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, can we have faith for that?
[20:57] &gt;&gt; If you would come and pray for me or an
[21:00] angel would come and pray for me, many
[21:02] of us because of the way we're taught or
[21:04] our thinking before knowing these
[21:06] things, we'd say, "Well, I want the
[21:08] angel to come and pray for me." But
[21:10] really, it's a son of God that knows how
[21:13] to pray for another son of God.
[21:17] It's a son of God that really knows how
[21:19] to worship.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; It's a son of God that knows what
[21:22] redemption is all about.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; We were lost, but now we're saved. We
[21:26] were sick, but then he healed us. We had
[21:29] troubles, then he brought us through.
[21:31] That's an experience that we go through
[21:33] as sons and daughters of God. This is
[21:35] why when we meet people on our job and
[21:37] they're going through these troubles of
[21:39] their life and you begin to testify to
[21:42] them, the experience that you have as a
[21:45] son or daughter of God, it goes so far,
[21:48] doesn't it?
[21:49] &gt;&gt; It's your testimony.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[21:53] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make it up. It's the
[21:54] same. It's a testimony. You can tell it
[21:56] 20 years from now, 50 years from now, it
[21:59] is your testimony. That's what the Lord
[22:02] has done for you. It's an experience
[22:04] that you had and you can share that with
[22:07] other people. And God uses men to bring
[22:10] other men in. That's how he does it.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; He uses men and all their falls and
[22:16] failures and the foolishness of
[22:18] preaching, low IQ, maybe not the most
[22:22] best looking. Some of them they don't
[22:23] have teeth. Some of them are they
[22:25] slumber. They they have all these other
[22:28] things. But God will use those vessels
[22:30] to fill his kingdom with
[22:34] &gt;&gt; because um because that's his choice.
[22:37] Amen.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; He uses sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[22:41] He doesn't use the most qualified.
[22:42] Doesn't use the ones that look like
[22:44] they're the most talented. He used
[22:46] whoever he wants to use.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; He chose the foolishness. He chose a
[22:53] Paul. You think he'd have got somebody
[22:55] that didn't have this guilt in his life
[22:57] of seeing Stephen stone, but he chose
[23:00] Paul and elected Saul and Paul and
[23:03] changed him and used him to be the
[23:05] greatest one of the greatest
[23:07] missionaries the world has ever known.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; He does that. That's the God that we
[23:12] serve. So here the prophet is bringing
[23:16] this to us this authority that you as
[23:19] sons and daughters of God that we have
[23:22] and this example with the Roman
[23:24] centurion and um uh Jarius is um in the
[23:30] Bible for that purpose to show us now
[23:35] the authority
[23:38] it's beautiful when you think of it this
[23:39] Roman centurion
[23:41] it it it would take him as I was looking
[23:44] it up for him to get that uh to to be a
[23:47] commissioned soldier like that and just
[23:49] be over a hundred men. It's it's it
[23:53] would take him 10 to 20 years
[23:56] of being in the army in the service.
[23:59] He's not a nobody. He's a man. This is
[24:01] somebody that knows how to work with
[24:03] people and different kinds of people. So
[24:06] this is how he understands authority.
[24:09] You have some people they they they they
[24:13] you know you tell them to go get and
[24:16] then you have others that are commanding
[24:19] and giving those orders.
[24:21] And it's amazing how in our training and
[24:24] our teaching as young men and young
[24:28] women, how God is trying to train us and
[24:31] teach us and mature us that many times
[24:34] in particular, I would say this age
[24:37] because this is the age that I'm living
[24:38] in. I this probably was going on a 100
[24:40] years ago. I don't know. But
[24:41] particularly this age, you have so many
[24:44] people they show up on the job and they
[24:46] just have this entitlement.
[24:49] They want to eat the fruit from plants
[24:52] and trees that did not plant. They want
[24:55] to they want to reap the harvest from an
[24:58] orchard that they didn't water. They
[25:01] want to show up and just begin picking
[25:04] the fruit. You'll see this many times.
[25:07] And so they don't want to go through
[25:11] those stages of bumping and bruises.
[25:15] They want to come in and they're
[25:17] positioned and just everything just be
[25:19] perfect.
[25:21] And so there's no, you know, no
[25:24] challenges against them, no setbacks.
[25:27] And they they uh they'll come in and
[25:29] they'll see a gift or a talent or
[25:32] they'll see someone that's doing it well
[25:34] or doing it right. They say, "Oh, that's
[25:35] what I want to be." And they get the
[25:37] opportunity. Well, this is what you need
[25:39] to do to be that. Oh, no. I want a
[25:41] shortcut. And so they'll scheme and
[25:44] they'll scam to try to get where they
[25:47] want to go.
[25:49] But I'm here to declare to you that all
[25:52] the years of training that the Lord has
[25:55] us in, he's not wasting any time on any
[25:58] of us.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; And he's not in a hurry. Even if you
[26:03] are,
[26:05] &gt;&gt; he's going to take his time with you
[26:08] until you are ready to move on to the
[26:11] next stage.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm glad about that because men
[26:16] will try to move you on. I remember I
[26:19] think I shared this before. I remember
[26:20] when I was seeking the Holy Ghost, a
[26:22] festive sister, she was one of the
[26:24] people that helped witness to me. She's
[26:26] gone on now. She said, "Brother Israel,
[26:28] what are you what are you always at the
[26:29] altar for, friends?" I I need the Holy
[26:32] Ghost. He said, "Well, Brother Israel,
[26:34] you have the Holy Ghost. Everybody can
[26:36] see that." And I was like, "Well, you
[26:39] know, I I need that assurance in my
[26:41] life." Oh, don't worry about it. You
[26:43] You're already in the message. You have
[26:44] the Holy Spirit. You know, that's a good
[26:47] way to Okay. All right. Well, Sister So
[26:50] and so said, "I had it, so I'm going to
[26:52] take that to the rapture." No, I don't
[26:54] think so. No. No. I need the assurance
[26:59] in my heart.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; And it might be true I might have had
[27:03] something but I needed something greater
[27:05] than what I had.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; And there is nobody that can advance you
[27:10] along to the next stage. Your pastor
[27:13] can't, your parent can't, the person,
[27:16] your coach, the person that witnessed to
[27:18] you, they can't move you along. The Holy
[27:20] Spirit has to do that.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Can I preach for a few minutes?
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. This is the training and the
[27:29] teaching. Brother Bam says, "What's
[27:31] happening here with Elijah and Elisha?"
[27:34] He takes that mantle and he touches
[27:38] Elisha with the mantle to see if the
[27:41] mantle was going to fit him. And he says
[27:45] that it took about 10 years for that
[27:48] mantle to fit him right. So here he is
[27:51] following Elijah and Elisha. Remember
[27:54] the Lord already told Elijah. One of the
[27:56] very rare places in the scripture where
[27:59] the Lord is showing who a successor is.
[28:03] And this is a problem with many
[28:05] churches. They don't know who the
[28:06] successor is. And so you have these
[28:09] man-made, you know, they're running like
[28:11] a family business or this one is next in
[28:14] line or this one is in charge. But God
[28:16] has to put that in order. He told Moses
[28:19] Joshua would take your place. He told
[28:21] Elijah, Elisha will take your place. And
[28:24] so it's a beautiful thing when you know
[28:27] what is the next uh uh uh the next the
[28:30] the the transition of the power of the
[28:33] order. So the Lord tells Elijah, "Go
[28:35] anoint him." He anoints him by throwing
[28:38] his uh uh uh mantle on him. The prophet
[28:42] tells us in the message the um
[28:47] oh
[28:50] secondhanded robe I'll get to it in a
[28:52] minute that it took him 10 years.
[28:57] 10 years to fit a role that was his. How
[29:02] long did it take for King David? You
[29:04] remember he was anointed as a little
[29:06] boy. He's a teenager. He didn't get
[29:09] anointed as king until he was 30 years
[29:11] old.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; And he has documents that the prophet
[29:15] anointed him with the oil that you take
[29:18] Saul's place.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; But look at all that he went through to
[29:21] to in order to take that place in that
[29:23] position.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; What about you and I? I was reading this
[29:27] guy this uh Gladwell I think Malcolm
[29:30] Gladwell. He's the intellectual
[29:33] years ago. He wrote a book on um I can't
[29:36] remember he me wrote several books but
[29:38] one of the things he brought out is this
[29:41] um the idea of 10,000 hours. How many's
[29:45] heard that it's about a 10,000 hour
[29:47] about a 10year the scientists and they
[29:50] they look at the people especially
[29:52] musicians that are very highly skilled
[29:55] musicians. It takes about 10,000 hours.
[29:58] It's just a number they throw out there.
[30:00] These are scientists. These are this is
[30:01] the world in carnality. But this is the
[30:04] number they come out with. It takes
[30:05] about 10,000 hours for you to perfect
[30:09] your craft.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; So So it's like like if
[30:16] who do you want performing surgery on
[30:18] you? That's what it I mean even painting
[30:22] your house. You want a master craftsman
[30:24] or you just want anybody know how to
[30:26] paint? Because everybody's got a brush.
[30:29] But a cra a a master craftsman been
[30:32] doing it for a while
[30:34] &gt;&gt; and he's got some insights for you
[30:36] &gt;&gt; now. Everybody a little sign on the
[30:38] building, a little thing on their truck,
[30:40] a little business card talking about
[30:41] he's an electrician. You better be
[30:44] careful.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; You want somebody who really knows what
[30:47] he's doing.
[30:48] And this this uh 10,000 hours rule comes
[30:52] out to about 10 years of you doing what
[30:56] you was called to do and doing it
[30:59] consistently.
[31:01] 10,000 hours. It's a it's a beautiful
[31:03] thing. And it's interesting how the Lord
[31:06] says this is how long it took Elijah and
[31:10] Elisha to get this across. Let me take
[31:13] it in the message.
[31:17] Second added robe here. What pro the
[31:19] prophet of God says here.
[31:23] Now notice paragraph 39. Elijah then
[31:25] after he threw this robe on him, he
[31:27] tried it on him. In other words, Elijah
[31:29] the prophet who had the mantle of God on
[31:32] his shoulders, he came down and laid it
[31:35] across Elisha the farmer to see if it
[31:38] would fit him. And it taken about 10
[31:41] years to get altar to fit that mantle.
[31:46] You know, God usually puts us in the
[31:48] shop and trims us up.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't alter the robe to fit
[31:53] Elisha. He ordered Elisha to fit the
[31:57] robe.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what he does today. He alters
[32:01] us to fit the robe, not the robe to fit
[32:04] us.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? He alters us to
[32:07] fit the quote, not the quote to fit us.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; You got to fit the quote. Don't make the
[32:14] quote fit you. You need to change. You
[32:17] got to lose the carnal weight to put on
[32:21] this message.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; He alters the man to fit the robe. He
[32:28] alters us to fit the robe, not the robe
[32:30] to fit us. Sometimes we want to make the
[32:33] robe fit us, but we can't do that. You
[32:35] got to let be altered yourself for the
[32:39] robe. It's God's robe and he made it
[32:42] perfect. He has got to bring us into
[32:45] that realm to make the robe fit us. So,
[32:49] we can't be perfect ourselves. We know
[32:52] we can't. There's no way for us to be.
[32:55] And yet, he said for us to be. So, but
[32:57] what did he He made a propitiation for
[33:00] us. The Lord Jesus Christ and his
[33:03] righteousness. There's where the
[33:05] perfection comes of ignoring our own
[33:07] holiness of which we have none, our own
[33:10] thoughts which we have not.
[33:13] We ought not to be. But we rest solemnly
[33:16] upon the finished work of the Lord
[33:17] Jesus.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; God sent him to the earth and it was him
[33:21] that we rest.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Notice all these years, as far as we
[33:26] know, he just had that one baptism of
[33:29] the robe going over him. But through the
[33:32] years, God had molded the man's
[33:35] character into a place to where after
[33:38] his call that he would fit into the robe
[33:41] and be the servant of the Lord.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; And when Elijah passed through and
[33:47] throwed it on him and they started up
[33:49] towards Gilgal and many of other places
[33:51] they went on in the school of the
[33:53] prophets and the road journey and on.
[33:55] Finally, Elijah was trying to get Elijah
[33:58] to turn back. Did you notice it? Trying
[34:01] to get him to turn back. Otherwise,
[34:03] maybe the road is a little too steep for
[34:05] you, son. Maybe it's a little too narrow
[34:07] for you to walk.
[34:10] Isn't that something?
[34:12] &gt;&gt; So, this is perhaps what our tests and
[34:16] trials are all about,
[34:18] &gt;&gt; huh?
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord is trying to get this message,
[34:24] get you to fit these quotations.
[34:28] You take a series like this, this is
[34:30] already here. This doesn't need to
[34:33] change,
[34:34] &gt;&gt; but somebody else does. That somebody is
[34:37] me.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; And I want to I want to put that on. I
[34:41] want it tailor made. I want it to be
[34:44] what I'm wearing. I wanted to be the
[34:46] bride's garment.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; She was araid in white.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is the word of the Lord. And
[34:52] so,
[34:53] &gt;&gt; are we being tailored today?
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Are we being trimmed up? Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how so many Christians want
[35:02] to to continue on the way they've always
[35:05] done things.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; But we, the true believer, want to be
[35:08] trimmed up so that we can fit the robe
[35:12] of his righteousness.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; He's got a way for us. And there's a
[35:16] plan that he laid for us. And this this
[35:19] centurion wasn't just a newcomer. He had
[35:22] been in the military for years now in
[35:25] order for him to have this position. And
[35:27] the Lord uses him as an example. And you
[35:31] can't you can't really operate in that
[35:34] authority if you can't accept the
[35:36] authority. You come up in those ranks
[35:38] and you have to get the experience and
[35:41] then you learn how to, you know, you
[35:44] learn how to to to to take orders.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[35:50] &gt;&gt; You learn how to I know I know we all
[35:52] know how to give them, but we need to
[35:54] know how to take the orders. Yeah.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Who's in charge today? Who wants to be
[35:58] in charge? Well, I do. I sure do. Yeah,
[36:00] I'll be in charge. I think I can handle
[36:02] it. Be in charge for a year. Who wants
[36:05] to take orders for a year? No. All
[36:08] right. No, not me.
[36:12] But you got to have both in order to be
[36:14] a real good soldier. And this is the
[36:18] Lord using this example. So Elisha now
[36:22] 10 years of following Elijah and the
[36:26] promise was there that he was to take
[36:28] Elijah's place. Here Elijah now is
[36:33] trying to discourage him and um you know
[36:38] it's it's really sad how this age has
[36:42] been so feminized.
[36:45] The men culture has just totally been
[36:50] feminized on every level and it's
[36:53] constantly a feeling, a game of feelings
[36:56] and trying to work with people's
[36:59] feelings and trying to make sure
[37:01] everybody feels okay and they feel good
[37:04] and don't offend anyone. Well, saints,
[37:08] that's just not life. It's not real.
[37:11] It's fake. And if you got a ministry or
[37:14] if you're in a relationship and it's all
[37:16] about feeling, that's a fake
[37:18] relationship. It's not honest. That is
[37:21] not the scriptures. The scriptures are
[37:24] there to keep you lined up, to keep me
[37:28] lined up. And it would be false for me
[37:31] to go down that path of making sure like
[37:34] every every task that's given, you're
[37:37] given a task here, young man, you need
[37:38] to go take care of this or young sister,
[37:40] you need to take care of that. and
[37:42] you're given that task and hey
[37:44] everybody's not appreciating you in that
[37:46] task. Well, we can make sure we go over
[37:48] there and courage and keep the back rub
[37:51] going so so you don't get, you know,
[37:55] just keep it just keep an eternal just
[37:57] keep an eternal feel good. That's is not
[38:00] life. The wild would eat you up.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; You're living out there. You that just
[38:06] it doesn't work that way, saints. I
[38:08] mean, that's not human. That's not
[38:10] correct. That's false. And this is what
[38:13] Satan is trying to do. He's trying to
[38:15] present this false um version of the
[38:18] truth or Christianity to the people. And
[38:21] that thing try to woo itself in here.
[38:23] And then we, you know, it's the point
[38:25] where, you know, the pastor doesn't want
[38:27] to mention anything negative. He doesn't
[38:29] want to say talk about hell and
[38:32] condemnation
[38:34] and and those things. And it's just not
[38:36] correct.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And um God help us is all I can say. God
[38:41] help us just to be honest, to be
[38:43] truthful because when we stand there on
[38:46] that day, you're going to be so glad
[38:48] that somebody told you the truth.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; I am so glad that this man told the
[38:53] truth.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Even if it was his family, his own
[38:57] church, the other ministers, he told the
[39:00] truth.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; It was uncomfortable sometimes, but he
[39:04] did it in love, didn't he? And it helps
[39:07] us when we hear the clear, clean truth.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; It's like a good coach. He'll tell you,
[39:16] you know, and the coach in football,
[39:18] Chris would know this. You have what you
[39:19] call tryyous. You know, all those kids
[39:22] showing up for tryyouts and then
[39:24] everybody wants to be the quarterback.
[39:27] Everybody wants to be a running back or
[39:29] a receiver. Of course, you show up
[39:32] there, what, son? What position you want
[39:33] to be? Oh, I want to be the running
[39:34] back. I want number 32 or I want number
[39:38] 33 and you call your number. You want to
[39:40] call.
[39:42] So it doesn't work that way, son. You
[39:45] got to we got to go to practice. That's
[39:47] not your skill set. So a a true coach,
[39:50] an honest coach will tell you, you know
[39:52] what, that's not the position for you.
[39:56] Um here's your position. Here's the
[39:58] number you're going to get. And you
[40:00] know, I've seen it so many times that on
[40:03] the field that the kid wants to quit. He
[40:06] wants to leave because the coach and
[40:08] then he gets the parents involved. Then
[40:09] parents come and argue with the coach
[40:12] that you're not playing my son. And
[40:15] look, if we play your son, we're going
[40:18] to lose.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; You want to hear the truth? If we play
[40:23] your son or my son, we going to lose.
[40:26] But, you know, if we want to have fun,
[40:28] we can go to the park and have fun.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; But if we're having an organized team
[40:33] sport and we want to win,
[40:35] &gt;&gt; we want the best players playing, don't
[40:37] we?
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong?
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; You know, and so even in on the streets,
[40:45] you know, the kids with these little
[40:46] pickup games will play football and the
[40:48] two best guys usually be the captains.
[40:51] And you begin you begin to pick your
[40:53] team. You pick your side. And you know
[40:56] the little sorry ones get picked last.
[40:59] You know how that is. You're just like,
[41:00] "Oh,
[41:02] you going to pick me? You going to pick
[41:03] nobody wants to like, all right, come
[41:05] on."
[41:07] But no matter how sorry you are, if
[41:11] you're on the winning team, you can brag
[41:14] just like the star player brag.
[41:20] Oh man, you're so sorry. Hey, but we won
[41:22] though.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what it's all about is, well,
[41:27] are you on the winning team?
[41:29] &gt;&gt; It don't matter. I didn't get the ball.
[41:31] It doesn't matter. I wasn't the star
[41:33] player. I'm on the winning team.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; And you know, that's what progress is.
[41:40] That's what the believers want. That's
[41:42] what you know as you're being trained
[41:44] these soldiers no doubt to become a
[41:48] centurion I think to become a captain in
[41:51] the navy it's 10 years or in the army
[41:53] it's four or five years after being a
[41:57] road soldier and then they then you're
[41:59] able to move up into those ranks. In
[42:01] other words, the point is you don't just
[42:03] come in at the top. There's some
[42:06] training involved.
[42:08] There's a time element there. And that
[42:11] time element is there to train and get
[42:14] you to know who you are. And let's say
[42:17] it is 10,000 hours.
[42:20] Let's say that is a good rule of thumb.
[42:23] 10 years of you doing whatever you think
[42:27] your talent is. And then you've become a
[42:31] master in that trade.
[42:34] You're a physician, a heart surgeon, and
[42:37] you've done it 10,000 hours.
[42:40] You have seen a lot. Your experience
[42:43] brings a lot to the table.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; And I wonder if you know when when this
[42:49] age is over, we're not going to heaven.
[42:52] After this age, we're going to a
[42:55] thousand years of a millennial reign.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; How many know that
[43:00] &gt;&gt; that is on the plan?
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. After after this age is over, the
[43:04] seventh age, then we have the marriage
[43:07] and the wedding supper. And then the
[43:08] Jews come into their kingdom. They come
[43:10] into their faith and God uses them and
[43:13] calls them. Then the saints come back on
[43:15] the earth and rule and reign
[43:19] &gt;&gt; for a thousand years.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; This is just a rehearsal.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; This is just a practice ground.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; We just come from the meetings in Bayer,
[43:30] New Mexico. So Bayard, that that little
[43:33] town. Bayard is a
[43:37] not a parish. I forget the name they
[43:38] call it. It has a name there. It's not a
[43:40] town,
[43:42] but you know, there are all these two or
[43:44] three little towns. Bayard, Santa Clara,
[43:46] and then Silver City. And in order to be
[43:50] a city or town, you have to have, I
[43:53] think, three or four businesses or five
[43:55] businesses. And one of those towns has
[43:57] exactly five. So one brother, he's not
[43:59] from that town. He kind of rolled his
[44:01] eyes said, "Yeah, they're a town because
[44:03] they have one more business than us."
[44:05] And this is how these little little
[44:08] towns are are established. And the the
[44:10] city of Bayard, there was a believer
[44:13] that was the mayor of that town. Fine,
[44:14] brother. He's retired from that. He was
[44:17] a mayor. Went to brother Mark's church.
[44:20] And I began to think, who who's running
[44:23] this town? Who's running this city? Who
[44:25] has the qualifications? Now, this town
[44:27] has one light through the city.
[44:31] If you miss that light and if you get
[44:33] lost in this town,
[44:36] that's on you for real. That's on you
[44:40] because this is not like Phoenix or LA.
[44:43] It's not even like Tucson. It's like a
[44:45] one road and you got a few little
[44:47] things. How you going to get lost in
[44:48] this town? But I begin to think about
[44:50] this great millennium that we're coming
[44:52] to and are you able to reign and rule in
[44:58] those cities? You know, the the the
[45:01] bride will be ruling and reigning during
[45:05] that time. She's given jurisdiction to
[45:08] cover and landscape to keep and he's
[45:13] they're ruling with Christ during this
[45:16] thousand years. and and we you know some
[45:18] of the little simp simple things that we
[45:22] can't seem to fully overcome. I believe
[45:24] we are overcoming them. I believe that
[45:26] with with the message coming and it's
[45:28] great you know it's it's so
[45:31] comprehensive. We have it in the books
[45:32] and tapes. We have it at all times where
[45:35] we can listen to it that it's really
[45:38] bringing us up in our faith. I believe
[45:40] that. I believe this message more now
[45:43] than ever before. And I believe it's
[45:45] equipping me and equipping the believer
[45:48] to really be something that they never
[45:51] thought they could be.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; It's really that's what the word is
[45:55] there for, to build you up. And I
[45:58] wonder, am I ready to rule or to govern
[46:02] even a little neighborhood in that great
[46:05] city? See, this is all not for nothing.
[46:09] We're going to the millennium.
[46:11] We got a thousand years of peace here on
[46:14] the earth in the millennium.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; So, what are we to be today? What should
[46:19] we be today? Now, here what the prophet
[46:21] of God says here in the secondhanded
[46:23] robe as I prepare to wind down. He says,
[46:31] paragraph 111, the thing that the world
[46:32] needs this morning is the power of God,
[46:35] the God of Elijah. You might have spoke
[46:38] with tongues and shouted and run over
[46:39] the floor. But what we need is the power
[46:42] of God of Pentecost to produce the the
[46:45] lives and things that was lived in that
[46:47] day in the apostolic power. A
[46:50] secondhanded robe was all right, but he
[46:53] needed a fresh call in his heart from
[46:55] God. He needed fresh anointing from God.
[46:59] He roar a secondhanded robe when he come
[47:01] to the river. But he needed a brand new
[47:04] fresh-handed call from God and a
[47:06] firsthanded power from God to perform
[47:10] the miracle. And my brother, don't you
[47:13] be afraid to ask God anything.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; You must demand God or ask God for
[47:23] anything that he has promised. Amen.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; For if I am introducing a God that's
[47:29] omnipotent and all powerful, and if I be
[47:33] a servant of God, I must do the works of
[47:36] God.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; And if I do the works of God, I must
[47:39] demand of God to bring these things to
[47:43] pass
[47:44] &gt;&gt; because he is demanding of me to produce
[47:48] the impossible.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; I have to ask him. I have to call upon
[47:54] him and stand there and say, "God, you
[47:57] promised it.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; So do you."
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Every person.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; So we have to demand God to bring his
[48:11] word to pass.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[48:14] &gt;&gt; What he said would happen, I have to ask
[48:19] him.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; I have to demand of him. And this is
[48:22] what Elisha did. He says, "I want a
[48:25] double portion." 10 years of training,
[48:28] 10 years of watching Elisha, watching
[48:31] Elijah, watching him, watching the
[48:33] prophet, watching his style, watching
[48:36] the way he did things. And uh Elijah
[48:39] tries to tell him to go back. Go ahead
[48:42] and stay back. And some of us, you know,
[48:44] we have to be encouraged all the time.
[48:46] Here Elijah is discouraging him,
[48:49] &gt;&gt; trying, you know, stay back. go on back.
[48:51] No, no, I will. I'll stay with you. My
[48:54] soul will not leave from you. He follows
[48:58] him on and follows him to the next city
[49:00] and follows him as he knows he's getting
[49:02] ready to leave. Crosses Jordan, follows
[49:05] him and Elijah asked him, "What do I
[49:08] want to do with you? What are you asking
[49:09] of me?" He says, "I want a double
[49:12] portion of your spirit." And he said,
[49:14] "You've asked a hard thing, but if you
[49:17] see me when I go, you can have it." Oh
[49:21] my. This is the attitude of the
[49:24] believer. We ask for the impossible.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; That's what we ask for. We ask for the
[49:36] impossible because he's given this
[49:39] authority to the believers. And I'm I'm
[49:44] afraid that we're we're not catching it
[49:47] all the time. We're a little afraid of
[49:50] it.
[49:52] He says it in here.
[49:58] Brother Bham says, "I'm afraid." We're
[50:00] afraid
[50:04] sons and daughters.
[50:10] He says that we have that authority. We
[50:12] have that power, but we're afraid to use
[50:15] it.
[50:18] I'm afraid that the church doesn't know
[50:21] their authority. I'm afraid the Holy
[50:24] Ghostborn men doesn't realize their
[50:27] authority
[50:28] &gt;&gt; or the authority that God has permitted
[50:31] to his church.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; That's in the message, Who is God?
[50:35] Paragraph 12. He says, Joshua stopped
[50:38] the sun. Is that true?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "All things are possible
[50:42] with God. Nothing impossible, but all
[50:45] things are possible to you also."
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Nothing impossible to them that believe.
[50:52] All things are possible brought right
[50:56] down and made you if you just know who
[50:59] God is.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm afraid that the church doesn't
[51:02] know
[51:04] their authority.
[51:07] I'm afraid the Holy Ghostborn men
[51:09] doesn't realize their authority or the
[51:13] authority that God has permitted to his
[51:17] church. Let's take a scripture here
[51:20] in Luke
[51:23] chapter 10 real quick.
[51:26] I have one I have two more points. I
[51:28] want to bring this and we'll close Luke
[51:30] chapter 10.
[51:41] Jesus gives the disciples gives them
[51:44] power and authority to cast out devils.
[51:49] Verse 18
[51:51] says, "And he said unto them, I beheld
[51:53] Satan and lightning fall from heaven.
[51:58] Behold, I give unto you power to tread
[52:00] on serpents and scorpions, and over all
[52:04] the power of the enemy, and nothing
[52:08] shall by any means hurt you. Not
[52:12] withstanding in this, rejoice not that
[52:16] the spirits are subject unto you, but
[52:19] rather rejoice because of what?
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Because your name is written in heaven.
[52:25] You see the predestination again.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; You see your position in Christ.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Now, it's a beautiful thing to have the
[52:33] power and the authority and to know that
[52:37] Satan had fallen when they went through
[52:40] these towns and healed the sick and cast
[52:42] out devils. And Jesus tells them that
[52:45] the serpents and the scorpions, you have
[52:47] power over them and all power of the
[52:51] enemy. And this one I like very much. He
[52:54] says, "And nothing shall by any means
[52:57] harm you."
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing can harm you. Oh my. Do you
[53:03] believe that today?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; You know, it's just a time of fear and
[53:07] and every time you're fearful, the enemy
[53:10] is telling you or the people are telling
[53:12] you how to protect yourself and how to,
[53:15] you know, if you're afraid of this, this
[53:17] is what you need to do. You need to have
[53:18] this, you need to buy this, you need to
[53:20] have all of this to protect yourself.
[53:23] But there's nothing that can hurt a true
[53:26] believer.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; This scripture tells us nothing shall by
[53:30] any means hurt you. This gives me a
[53:32] liberty to know that when I go in Jesus'
[53:36] name that he's got me covered.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; And I believe that I really can't, as
[53:41] much as I will try to defend myself and
[53:44] my family. No question about it. I do
[53:47] what I can to defend myself, defend my
[53:49] family, defend whoever I needed to
[53:52] defend. But I know good and well I
[53:55] cannot even take care of myself.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; You think you you have all this
[54:00] protection, you have all this,
[54:01] everybody, all the thieves have that
[54:03] plus
[54:05] &gt;&gt; everything you got, they got a bigger
[54:06] caliber. They got more of it and they
[54:08] got the illegal version of it
[54:11] &gt;&gt; because they're lawb breakakers.
[54:13] And where you're trying to believe in
[54:15] and stay within the confines of the law,
[54:18] they're going to break the law and have
[54:19] whatever they feel like they want.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right, brother Bob? But God is
[54:26] our protection.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; And there is nothing by any means can
[54:30] harm you.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; But he says, don't even rejoice over
[54:34] that. Don't rejoice that nothing will
[54:36] harm you. Don't rejoice that you have
[54:38] power over all the enemy. Don't rejoice
[54:40] that Satan fell down before your feet.
[54:43] But rejoice because your name was
[54:46] written in heaven.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because in heaven you have an
[54:50] authority.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; That authority is the highest of all
[54:56] authorities of any angel.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Is the authority of the sons and
[55:01] daughters of God.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet's trying to
[55:04] show us that we have this authority. So
[55:09] we are moving into another position. Can
[55:13] I close with this last point? Adoption
[55:17] number three par adoption number four
[55:20] sorry prophet makes this statement here.
[55:25] It goes into that inheritance of the
[55:28] believer
[55:33] and he says this here,
[55:44] paragraph number 75.
[55:53] How long has the prophet been off the
[55:54] scene
[55:56] since 1965 to 2025? Has been how long?
[56:02] Help me.
[56:04] 60 years. He's been off the scene. But
[56:06] his message and tapes have grown. His
[56:10] ministry today is bigger than what it
[56:12] was when he was preaching at the Brandom
[56:15] Tabernacle. Can we say amen to that?
[56:17] They didn't have all the tapes confined
[56:19] in one place to be able to give it all
[56:22] out like we have today. And they're
[56:24] still interpreting other languages as we
[56:27] speak. It's a great tremendous work. Do
[56:30] you think the people that's following
[56:31] the message are more equipped now than
[56:34] they were 50 years ago? I say yes. I say
[56:38] we have more information. I don't know
[56:40] when this book came out, but I guarantee
[56:43] you they didn't have it when he preached
[56:44] it.
[56:48] Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; And there God has given us this great
[56:52] tremendous word of the Lord. And we are
[56:56] in the the nastiest age that you could
[56:58] ever live in.
[57:00] An age of disrespect on every level.
[57:04] An age of ungratefulness and an age of
[57:08] total terror. And people are just mad
[57:11] and angry.
[57:13] The races are angry at one another.
[57:15] Human beings are angry at one another.
[57:17] People, family members are just angry at
[57:19] one another. Churches and people just
[57:22] this the the lack of love has grown
[57:25] people to be so cold
[57:28] and hard
[57:30] that even they will beat up an old woman
[57:33] or an old man. Young people
[57:35] disrespectful to elders on so many
[57:39] levels. But God in his great love and
[57:42] mercy has given us a great and
[57:44] tremendous message.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. He's given us a great and
[57:49] tremendous message. And we got to we we
[57:51] we we can't stay here the way we are
[57:53] right now. We have to leave out of here.
[57:58] And we've been in training for some
[58:00] time.
[58:02] And we have been hearing these things
[58:05] for some time. I'm closing right now.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And we're we're in a training. We've
[58:10] seen things happen. We've seen people
[58:12] who are church people. We've seen
[58:14] churches split. We've seen things
[58:17] happen. We've seen people just do all
[58:21] kind of things. Pastors and groups
[58:24] change their theology and even believers
[58:29] won't even fellowship with other
[58:30] believers
[58:32] because of some doctrine. We've seen
[58:35] that, haven't we?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; But we're being trained, aren't we?
[58:39] Yeah.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; And it can't be everybody likes us. It
[58:43] can't be everything is great all the
[58:45] time. It's just, you know, this high and
[58:48] we're just so, you know, we're just
[58:50] bubbling over with joy and happiness and
[58:53] just glee and no test, no trials. That's
[58:56] just not real.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Now, the joy of the Lord is always with
[59:00] us. But we can go through some tests and
[59:03] some trials that will simply cause us to
[59:06] weep and really cause us to hurt. And
[59:09] some of us are going through that right
[59:11] now. Amen. And and and and others are
[59:15] going through even greater things,
[59:16] right? And we know and we hear these
[59:19] stories. But here you know this great uh
[59:21] beautiful message that has been given to
[59:23] us is now calling us from
[59:28] from you know just being a church member
[59:30] just coming in the message to something
[59:32] even greater. And let me let the prophet
[59:35] let's read it here just a minute. Um he
[59:39] says he he has predestinated us to this
[59:43] inheritance.
[59:46] Drops down. He says, "But in the
[59:47] fullness of time, God sent in his own
[59:50] good time Jesus, the lamb slain from the
[59:53] foundation of the world. His blood was
[59:56] shed that I might go to my inheritance."
[59:59] To be what? What inheritance? The
[1:00:03] sunship to be a son of God. Now, this
[1:00:07] may just choke you to death, but did you
[1:00:09] know that men that are sons of God are
[1:00:12] amateur gods?
[1:00:15] How many ever know that? How many knows
[1:00:17] that Jesus said so? The Bible Jesus
[1:00:20] said, "Did not your law say itself that
[1:00:22] ye are God's?"
[1:00:25] And so, Brother Bam goes on. He says,
[1:00:27] "And uh he says uh and he he'll take
[1:00:30] every power that Satan's got away from
[1:00:32] him." Yes, sir. It belongs to him. He's
[1:00:35] the logos that went out of God. That is
[1:00:37] true. That was the son of God. Then he
[1:00:41] made man that little God. And they said,
[1:00:45] "If they call those who the word of God
[1:00:47] come to, the prophets, if they call them
[1:00:49] gods, who the word of God came to, God
[1:00:53] said so himself that they were gods."
[1:00:57] He told Moses, "I made you a god and
[1:00:59] made Aaron your prophet." Amen. Woo! I
[1:01:03] know I act a little like a religious
[1:01:06] crank, but I'm not. Oh, your eyes can
[1:01:09] come open and see those things. All
[1:01:11] right.
[1:01:14] He made man a god. A god in his domain.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; And your domain goes from sea to sea,
[1:01:22] from shore to shore. He has the control
[1:01:26] of it.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came being the one God
[1:01:30] without sin, he proved it. When the
[1:01:32] winds blow, he said, "Peace be still."
[1:01:36] And when the trees, he says, "No man eat
[1:01:38] from thee." Verily I say unto you,
[1:01:40] that's little gods. If you'll say to
[1:01:44] this mountain,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; be moved and don't doubt in your heart,
[1:01:48] but believe that you what you said it
[1:01:50] will come to pass. You can have what you
[1:01:52] said.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are there any little gods in here?
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a false doctrine in the
[1:01:59] word of faith movement and they've used
[1:02:02] this uh principle that god begets other
[1:02:07] gods. So, they're really junior gods and
[1:02:10] they're going around and that's why they
[1:02:12] can get a private jet and multi-million
[1:02:15] dollars because it's they're God's uh
[1:02:18] servants. They are gods walking in that
[1:02:21] authority, but they've denied the word.
[1:02:23] So, how can they be a god?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; They rejected the word, the purity of
[1:02:28] it. And so, there's this idea, this
[1:02:31] proud, boastful thought of being like a
[1:02:35] god, like Satan. take the knowledge but
[1:02:38] not take the character.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; So, it's like following the message but
[1:02:43] not living it.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; It's like throwing the message at people
[1:02:47] and using it for quotes and using it to
[1:02:49] argue it but it's not becoming one with
[1:02:51] you.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; But the gods that he's talking about are
[1:02:54] gods that take the word and every bit of
[1:02:58] the word and they stand with it five
[1:03:00] years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years.
[1:03:04] They take the test of time and they stay
[1:03:07] with the word. Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And this is what we're coming to. God
[1:03:10] bless you so much.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Going right back to Genesis to the
[1:03:15] original. What is it? Now the world and
[1:03:18] nature is groaning, crying, everything's
[1:03:20] moving. What? For the manifestation of
[1:03:24] the sons of God.
[1:03:27] When true sons,
[1:03:29] born sons, filled sons speak and their
[1:03:35] word is backed.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; I believe we're on the border of it
[1:03:39] right now.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Say to this mountain, let it
[1:03:43] be so. Brother, I desire so and so a
[1:03:46] certain thing done. I'm a believer in
[1:03:48] Jesus Christ. I give it to you in the
[1:03:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:03:53] There's a manifestation.
[1:03:55] Oh brother, my crops are burning up out
[1:03:57] yonder. I haven't had any rain. I'll
[1:04:00] send you rain in the name of the Lord.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Bless your crops. Oh, waiting, groaning,
[1:04:06] all nature waiting for the manifestation
[1:04:09] of the sons of God.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; God ordained it at the beginning. He
[1:04:13] gave man the domain.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Now, do you believe that
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; if this quote isn't for us, then who is
[1:04:23] it for? Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And if not now, then when?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Who's going to manifest this?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the millennium.
[1:04:36] This is before the rapture.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; This is a time of the manifestation of
[1:04:40] the sons of God.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; 60 years it's been laying on the earth.
[1:04:47] 60 years. Somebody's been listening to
[1:04:50] them tapes. 60 years the church doors
[1:04:54] have been open. 60 years the tapes have
[1:04:58] been playing and available.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody is going to believe it.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Why not that be you?
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about an amateur guy. That's
[1:05:13] a different level. Now I'm not talking
[1:05:15] about a church member. Church members
[1:05:17] fight with other church members.
[1:05:20] They hold a grudge. They can't let it
[1:05:22] go. They're carnal. They procelite.
[1:05:24] They're interested in their own self.
[1:05:26] They're uh imu. They're they're jealous.
[1:05:30] They're mean. They're arrogant. All
[1:05:32] those spirits that all of us, if we'll
[1:05:35] be honest, we had it come on us, too.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The works of the flesh are these.
[1:05:41] Galatians 5.
[1:05:44] My one pastor would say 17 tickets to
[1:05:46] hell. That's what he called them.
[1:05:50] 17 of them. Those are the works of the
[1:05:52] flesh. How many of y'all in the flesh
[1:05:54] today? If you came here, you're in the
[1:05:56] flesh. And these are the works of the
[1:05:59] flesh. And you got to keep your flesh
[1:06:02] under the working of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:04] because those things will come on you.
[1:06:06] But we're moving from that, aren't we?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; We're moving into amateur gods.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Can I receive that?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; 60 years of it going. I can take the
[1:06:17] attitude. So, brother Israel, you know,
[1:06:19] the other pastor, this is the way they
[1:06:20] did it. You know, live a nice life after
[1:06:23] 30 years, 40 years, you get old, you,
[1:06:25] you know, just be okay. Just die and
[1:06:28] just roll on over. And Satan is just
[1:06:31] going rampant on every level. I don't
[1:06:34] know of an age. I mean, it's just on
[1:06:37] every level. Satan has not stopped. It
[1:06:42] looks like every family is well intact
[1:06:45] and everything is lovey lovey. But Satan
[1:06:48] is no joke.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; He is no joke. He's fighting right now.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Working dissensions and trying to tear
[1:07:00] things up and problems. And then the
[1:07:03] emotional guy, he's all emotional. He's
[1:07:05] all, "Yeah, I can't believe they did
[1:07:07] that. And why would they say that? And
[1:07:09] how could they lie?" and I was just
[1:07:11] getting things together. Well, you
[1:07:14] that's an emotion. I'm talking I'm
[1:07:15] talking about a little G. I'm looking
[1:07:16] for a little G. I'm looking for a little
[1:07:19] G. A little God.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for a little amateur God.
[1:07:25] Where are they?
[1:07:27] Or maybe they're in the Baptist church.
[1:07:29] Are they? You think they're in the
[1:07:31] Baptist church?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; In the denominational church? Where they
[1:07:34] at? They're online somewhere.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Where are they at? Somebody, please.
[1:07:40] Where are the sons and daughters of God
[1:07:42] at?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Elisha asked this question when he got
[1:07:46] the mantle after the years of studying
[1:07:49] the 10 years of the robe fitting him and
[1:07:52] God trimming him and shaping him. Then
[1:07:54] finally his master leaves. He gets the
[1:07:57] mantle. He has the message. He's the
[1:07:59] elected one. He comes to the river. He
[1:08:01] says, "Where is the God of Elijah?" He
[1:08:06] strikes the water and the power of God
[1:08:08] comes down.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; I had a question I wanted to ask you as
[1:08:15] I close.
[1:08:17] How have you been taught?
[1:08:21] Are you
[1:08:23] the Jarius side of teaching or are you
[1:08:25] the Roman side?
[1:08:30] Are you rejoicing because of your
[1:08:33] position in the Lamb's Book of Life?
[1:08:40] Are you capable of demanding God to do
[1:08:44] what he promised you to do for you to
[1:08:47] do?
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Are you a little God?
[1:08:54] God help us. God bless us. I believe we
[1:08:58] are little to gods. I believe we're
[1:09:00] coming into that authority and we thank
[1:09:03] the Lord for it, don't we? Amen. God
[1:09:07] bless you. The musicians come
[1:09:11] and we'll pray.
[1:09:19] Lord, what a responsibility
[1:09:22] that's been laid upon the church.
[1:09:27] as
[1:09:29] Elijah, a type of the Old Testament,
[1:09:34] Elisha, a type of the New Testament
[1:09:37] church, the works that I do, and even
[1:09:41] greater works.
[1:09:43] That's the believer, Lord. That's the
[1:09:45] Gentile church. That's he that has the
[1:09:48] spoken word
[1:09:50] that you've called us to be like a
[1:09:54] centurion.
[1:09:56] who knows the authority.
[1:09:59] He knows
[1:10:01] who's got the power. He knows where
[1:10:04] power lies.
[1:10:07] He knows that he that you're the
[1:10:11] jurisdiction of it all. And you have
[1:10:14] given us that authority tonight. Lord, I
[1:10:19] pray you'll bless us as we move forward
[1:10:22] and really look at the hour that we're
[1:10:24] living in. I can't preach it loud
[1:10:27] enough. I can't scream it, Lord. It's on
[1:10:30] the books. It's in the tapes.
[1:10:33] It's in our Bible. Opened up. It's been
[1:10:36] opened up to us, Lord. An example.
[1:10:40] Father, I pray that you'll help us. In
[1:10:43] Jesus' name we pray. We ask it. Amen.
[1:10:48] can make it
[1:10:51] know that I can stand.
[1:10:55] Better words
[1:10:58] come my way.
[1:11:00] I present your I know that with Jesus I
[1:11:08] Oh yes I can.
[1:11:11] I know I can stand.
[1:11:15] No matter what may come my way, my life
[1:11:21] is in your hands.
[1:11:25] Oh, I know that I can make it.
[1:11:31] know that I can stand
[1:11:36] no matter what
[1:11:39] come my way.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:52] with him. I know I'm sorry. Oh,
[1:11:57] no matter what may come our way,
[1:12:03] life is in your hand. You don't have to
[1:12:06] worry and you don't have to worry
[1:12:13] and don't you be afraid. Brother John
[1:12:19] comes in the morning
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] pass away.
[1:12:29] Oh, there a friend in Jesus.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; He'll wipe your tears away.
[1:12:41] Heart is broken.
[1:12:45] Let's lift your hands. Let's stand and
[1:12:48] sing that. Oh,
[1:12:50] know that I can make it.
[1:12:56] I know that I understand.
[1:13:01] Oh my
[1:13:04] god

[1:13:22] no matter what.
[1:13:28] life is in.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that second verse.
[1:13:32] So when your test and trials,
[1:13:38] they seem to get you down.
[1:13:43] And all your friends and loved ones
[1:13:48] are nowhere to be found.
[1:13:53] Remember, there's a friend in Jesus
[1:13:58] who will wipe your tears away.
[1:14:04] And if your heart is broken,
[1:14:09] just lift your hands and say,
[1:14:13] "Oh, I know that I can make it.
[1:14:20] I know that I can stand.
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:25] No matter what may come my way, my life
[1:14:31] is in your hand.
[1:14:35] With Jesus, I can make it.
[1:14:41] With him, I know I can stand.
[1:14:46] Oh no matter what may come my way.
[1:14:51] My life is in your hands.
[1:15:01] In moments
[1:15:03] like these
[1:15:07] I sing out
[1:15:10] a song.
[1:15:13] I sing out
[1:15:15] a love song
[1:15:18] to Jesus
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:24] in moments
[1:15:26] like thee.
[1:15:30] I lift up
[1:15:33] my voice.

[1:19:53] situations.
[1:19:55] In and out of situations
[1:20:02] that talk to war at me.

[1:25:39] Dear Lord,
[1:25:42] what a message tonight, Lord Jesus.
[1:25:47] We can only find who we are, Lord Jesus.
[1:25:51] Your church, Lord, your body, Lord, to
[1:25:54] carry out
[1:25:56] your works, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:00] Dear Lord, our brother Lazy and Brother
[1:26:02] Shawn, Lord, they're on the road
[1:26:04] traveling. Lord Jesus,
[1:26:06] may your presence be with them, Lord.
[1:26:09] Keep them safe, dear Lord Jesus.
[1:26:13] Dear Lord, just be with everyone here,
[1:26:15] Lord.
[1:26:19] Dear Lord, if we know who we are, Lord,
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:24] the church of God, Lord, nothing can
[1:26:26] stand before us, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:30] The works that you did, Lord, should be
[1:26:32] flowing through us, Lord. That's a
[1:26:35] promise, Lord. We're waiting for that
[1:26:38] manifestation, Lord. Lord Jesus, we ask
[1:26:42] for your anointing, Lord, just to
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; bring it on to us, Lord Jesus. We can
[1:26:49] manifest these
[1:26:51] works of your body, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:56] We're waiting for that, Lord Jesus. That
[1:26:59] third pull, Lord. Oh Lord, that
[1:27:02] anointing Lord, please Jesus,
[1:27:06] just bring that down among us, Lord
[1:27:09] Jesus, and bless this
[1:27:11] your body of Christ, Lord Jesus.
[1:27:15] Give us the faith, Lord. Give us the
[1:27:18] faith we need, Lord, to bring this
[1:27:20] about, Lord Jesus.
[1:27:23] Not for our honor, but for your honor
[1:27:25] and glory, Lord, for you, Lord, to bring
[1:27:28] out your works in this world for us to
[1:27:32] see and be part of, Lord Jesus.
[1:27:35] Thank you, Lord, for your word. We thank
[1:27:37] you for the preaching of your word, for
[1:27:40] the encouragement, Lord, that we have.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you're a great God. We love you
[1:27:46] so much, Lord. Just be with us.
[1:27:50] Strengthen us, Lord. encourage us, Lord
[1:27:52] Jesus. We ask this in Jesus Christ's
[1:27:55] name. Amen.
[1:27:57] [Music]
[1:28:03] Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; We sang a song this morning, fill my
[1:28:08] cup, Lord. And one of the lines in there
[1:28:11] is, "Bread of heaven, feed me till I can
[1:28:14] eat no more."
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And I just, we all have different
[1:28:17] appetites, different levels that we get
[1:28:19] full. But I think today we can all say
[1:28:21] that we're content. It's been good to be
[1:28:24] in the house of the Lord. Amen. What a
[1:28:27] wonderful day.
[1:28:29] So wonderful to be able to fight this
[1:28:32] fight with each and every one of you.
[1:28:34] And I'm just just love you all and just
[1:28:37] am thankful for the opportunity to serve
[1:28:39] him with each of you.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that song as as
[1:28:44] you're dismissed. Who I am, Lord, who I
