a challenge with my voice the last couple of days um but tonight just before we go to the Lord's Supper we like to go right into the word and ask you to stand it's good to see sister Joy I heard her saying praise the Lord and so amen and each of you how many enjoyed the service this morning well that was really really good I certainly needed that and um we pray the Lord to bless our brother and the scripture I'd like to take is in 1 John chapter 5 the epistle John 5 and the scripture says whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his his Commandments are not Grievious for whatsoever is born of God does what overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith how many Believers here tonight how many has Faith it's your faith that overcomes the world Amen Hebrews 11 check one more scripture now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witnessed that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh let's drop down to verse yes our brother quoted this this morning by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith fa that is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's all read that together verse six but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently amen that's our desire tonight to diligently seek Him may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I will speak to you just for a moment maybe 15 minutes if that's okay on just to encourage your faith a little bit right along with our brother's testimony this morning and along with all of the messages that we've been hearing um we asked you to listen to a portion of the restoration of the brid tree to claim what God has restored to the church the brid tree and what is so nice is that brother Joel is that we are the bride tree and we might lose some things through the cankerworm the caterpillar the Locust but what's beautiful is that we are a brid tree and there was a promise that restoration would come I will restore not sayth the church not sayith you but saith the Lord the Lord will restore the church the good things amen God bless you and um in this message brother brandham is dealing in the prayer lines and there's several places that he's dealing with this how he has um the demons are calling out for help for one another and uh there's pages and pages of it several places I should say and I had noted this uh some years ago when I went back to look at it again and did a a different search it even gets even deeper but I have one two three one two three four or five quotes on that that I want to read for you just for a moment and this kind of gives us an opening into how Satan operates and the message deep call it to the Deep 1952 paragraph 20 brother bandam says this here paragraph 20 all right come lady don't you suffer with arthritis too lady sitting right there at the the end little woman you have arthritis don't you would you raise up your hand if that's right that's what happened this this powerful enemy here is screaming for help in other words demons are calling to it you see to answer much of it out there is in the audience but I could tell it was real close to me somewhere now I can't heal you just just a minute while I speak to the audience just a moment so brother Ram continues on and he's saying it's happening all in the audience but he knew this was up close to him where this arthritis demon was calling for help he goes on in the message healing line 1953 and he says this paragraph 13 how come would you sir do you believe with all your heart of course sir as a brother there's nothing I could do to help you in the way of healing you see I couldn't do it and you look like a good strong man but perhaps you're not I don't know but our lord Jesus knows and he knows me and now if you believe that he is here his presence is here you believe that he is here it's a cancerous condition and that man setting right there has the same thing them demons are screaming one to another he you see for pity Mercy they're calling and so's the angels of God calling the battle is here now your faith will determine which way it goes amen it's powerful Insight isn't it now this is just dealing with Cancers and demons of sickness and diseases on our body what about unbelief what about in our souls I wonder in the message this is in uh 1955 paragraph 59 he says this here what if I told you your heart trouble can be made well in jesus' name you believe it then go just a minute demons are demons screamed something called for help demon power it come from the spiritual world when not uh sorry sorry something called for help demon power it come from the audience when this woman was healed that demon Spirit screamed to another one for help it's the spiritual World we're not talking about the outside it's this lady laying in this chair with a red dress on have you a prayer card no do you believe me to be his Prophet you were laying there looking to me believing saying wonder if I could be well if God will reveal to me what your trouble is will you accept Jesus as your healer will you do it it was heart trouble the same thing that was the matter with this woman take up your bed go into your home don't doubt nothing and you'll get well too Hallelujah brother brandom says in the message what is in thy hand 1955 he says this here paragraph 102 he says come lady you just take your same place cuz you have the same condition anemia just stay right there just a minute just keep standing to your feet you're going to see something in a moment if them demons out there are screaming here for help if it has to leave here it's defeated out there too have faith dust thou believe amen tremendous isn't it to see how these demons and Devils we can't hear it in the natural but in the spiritual world they're calling for help they're calling to to continue to keep you or the individual bound but God has given us Faith to overcome the enemy and brother randam says it here in this message 1952 early spiritual experiences say he says this here paragraph 27 I want to encourage your heart on the faith that God has given us he says don't think I'm excited now it's got to be a place till you can't listen to nobody you got to listen to God let every man's word be a lie I know more about that now than I ever noted in my life I don't make any difference what people say it's what God say says if it Compares with the word then it's so if the goods is there to produce it because God testifies of his gifts you listen to the preacher sometime you get yourself in trouble some of them anyhow notice they were all muddled up in their Doctrine and Devils out here fortune tellers was the only ones them was out there was the ones that was recognizing him to be what he was and recognizing the apostles to be what they were men of God fortune tellers and Devils so Paul turned around and rebuked that Spirit of divination from the woman she couldn't tell no more fortunes he didn't need the devil to testify who he was he knowed who he was he was God's Saint he didn't need the devil's help but the devil was telling the truth about him anyhow Jesus told that devil said hold your peace but come out of him yes sir he didn't need the devil's help but the devil was screaming so many people talking about now one of these days before I leave now I'm going to preach to you demonology and let you know what demons are you don't realize how they come right face to face with God and plead to come down and do something about it now that's scriptural besides knowing otherwise how right here in the meeting at night when one comes to the platform with an ounce of Faith you hear another one out there screaming for help the one standing here on the platform maybe is dying with cancer another one sitting over there with cancer and this cancer knowing that he's facing knowing that he's facing down here if that woman would only believe what I'm telling and believe Jesus Christ she'll be healed as sure as the world then to throw that woman's Faith off that other demon screams down to her and I catch between them and say there you are both of you believe amen so brother brandom says just one ounce of faith when when Satan sees one ounce of faith those demons start screaming for help now do you have an ounce tonight do you just have a mustard seed sometimes our faith gets a little bit low but we're always Believers we're not more Believers today than we were yesterday we were Believers by God's grace through faith in the purchase one of Calvary the Lamb of Calvary but our faith gets low doesn't it in it we get discouraged sometimes but we're still Believers and if we still got an ounce of faith our faith is what we overcome the world with our faith is what Rises us out of Despair I was thinking of job how the Lord had confidence in job and I thought that was really nice how the Lord can look upon job and say to Satan have you considered him that there's none like him have you considered my servant he asseth evil and he is truly my servant and brother Ram goes on to say how God had confidence in job and I love that I love for the Lord to have confidence in me and then I started to think a little bit more how we should have confidence in one another I should believe the best about you that even if you're doing something in the negative that I have confidence that you're going to come out of it cuz you're a Believer you're my brother you're my sister and we will overcome the world in any tactics of the devil how many believe that this evening uh we do things to hurt one another don't we we do do things against one another and sometimes we say things and we brush against one another but let's have confidence in one another and believe that the good is going to come out anyhow it'll be made right if there's any wrongs amen so have confidence in one another now just before we go to the to the to the Lord's table I wanted to read this this little quote here because that that little um ounce of faith that quote there when the devil recognizes that the platform the an ounce of Faith then he goes and so then we start to think of what is our faith how can I increase that how can I build my faith muscles how can I be stronger and we want to a mechanism tell us listen to this tape and I'll get more faith or read this scripture or come to church three times out of the week and you'll get more faith but I like the way brother randos says this in the message the Queen of Sheba paragraph 115 he says says how many's been in the meetings raise your hands now and see that done raise your hands everywhere certainly it will it's perfect it's God sometimes people have more faith than they think they have you try to make yourself have faith don't do that just humble yourself a man sitting right there the light still around him right there didn't even it's surprised him he had that much Faith that's right but he had it amen isn't that right sir if that's right raise up your hand the man's healed right there that's right it's just surprised you you didn't think you have it it's just simple just believe it amen um I like good surprises and that's a good one I like to think I have more faith and perhaps my mind tells me or my past experiences tell me but sometimes we try to work ourself to Faith and brother man says don't do that just do what humble yourself humble yourself get out of the way amen I got my pug preacher there back again tonight brother Rick the Lord's did a wonderful work in his life and he's excited about it amen if everybody was saying amen he wouldn't bother us we wouldn't even hear him praise the Lord God bless you you're not bothering me now anyway so God bless [Laughter] you all right now he's blushing all right but don't look at him he started it he called himself out so God bless brother Rick I love him so let's let's take this last portion on this message about about Jesus this is in our scriptures in Matthew chapter 4 and also in Luke chapter 4 that Jesus in conversation with the devil brother Brandon brings down those tactics that he used in the message Harvest time that we brought to you here before how he tried to uh get him to eat something besides the word that was his first Temptation the second was to offer him uh the second was to offer him something Supernatural and the third tactic that he used if the others fail this one won't fail that was to offer him a position in the church but brother random says this in the message Ministry explain and he says this here paragraph 16 1950 Jesus we all believe he was the son of God is that right we accept him as the Son of God and he was more than a man God was in Jesus God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and he was a a God man God working through him now but when he met Satan or Satan met him he did not use any of his fine gifts which I believe that in him dwelt all the powers of heaven was in him but he never used any of them to defeat the enemy when he met Satan Satan tempted him he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone then upon the Pinnacle of the temple he met him again with the word of God when he taken him up into the mountain he met him again with the word of God so showing to us as our example that the word of God will defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime it is written amen prophet of God says it again and my angels shall go before thee 1953 he says this here paragraph number 8 God's word will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time time now when Jesus was here on Earth I believe he was well he was Emmanuel God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself so all the great qualities of the father was in Christ Jesus the son when he was here on Earth all that the father was his and all the fine gifts that that's in God and all that was in Christ par me see all the fine gifts that's in God and all that was in Christ but when he met Satan he never used any of those gifts he just to be your example he brought it to where the very weakest of Christians he said he had the power right then to rebuke Satan and send him away but what he did he never referred to any of his power Satan said if thou be the Son of God there's always a question mark across God's word by Satan so he said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread now Jesus said it's written in the father's word man shall not live by bread alone he taken him up to the top of the temple told him to cast himself down Jesus said it's written right back to the scripture then he taken him up to a mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world and said I'll give you it if you'll Bow Down and Worship me Jesus said it is written see constantly it's written it's written and then when you can hit Satan with the scripture he's just as powerless as he can be see well if anything I don't care what it is now if it isn't within me or now it isn't within me or your pastor to pray it's for us to pray with you but it'll have to be your own individual faith that does the healing now the UNT Jesus never healed anyone without first the father showed him about it now he said that that he had it last night in John the 5th chapter and the 19th verse verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing watch two Blind Men following him one day in the street they were blind crying have mercy on us have mercy on us he just walked right on he come into the house they brought the blind man to him the blind man said have mercy on us he says do you believe he said yes he touched their eyes and said according to your faith is that right according to your faith be it unto you see and they had the faith the woman touched the him of His Garment he said thy faith not my power thy faith has made thee whole see thy faith what but he went and did just what the father showed him amen so it's your faith tonight it's your faith that you overcome by it's your faith that's in you now that God give you that can sustain you if you have to walk all by yourself you can do it but look what he's done he's given us friends he's given us acquaintances brothers and sisters that can shoulder some of the burden with us isn't that nice that I can shake hands with a brother or a sister that's in the same battle that I'm in and when I'm discouraged they can encourage me and I can do the same for them but our faith really has the power to overcome all the Ws of the devil God give us that faith and we thank God for it this is my last quote here in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph number six he says but when he met Satan to let you know that you have this Authority he never used one of his gifts or any of his power Satan said if thou be the Son of God do a miracle here before me let me see you he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he took him to the Pinnacle of the temple and said he quoted some scriptures coded it some scripture and said Angels bear thee up less at any time Dash your foot against a stone he said and it's also written and he took him upon the mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and said these are mine I'll give them to you if you'll worship me Jesus said it is written every time he Satan comes in he said it is written my father said thus my father has said thus he defeated Satan on the word of God every Christian in here can defeat Satan any place anywhere anytime on the word of the Living God say thus sayeth the Lord it is written When you pray tonight say Lord I accept my healing I believe it no matter what you feel like say I believe it Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it not your feeling he's not the high priest of your feeling he's the high priest of your confession you accept it believe it and and confess it amen praise the Lord how many Believers here tonight that's a confession I Believe by his stripes I'm already healed by his stripes if the musicians will come God bless you richly we thank the Lord for his word this portion of his word tonight I'm going to move over to this other mices as we can turn into scriptures to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 we stand to our feet before we read let's just bow our heads just on those few words that we spoke here on faith just an ounce of Faith you say Lord help me to recognize the the ounce of Faith the faith that you put in me that it will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time if I apply that Faith to the word of God I want you to meditate on think about that just for a moment and if that's your desire that's your prayer why don't you raise your hand to him him and say Lord grant that to me to raise me out of whatever the circumstance is it'll be by faith that we overcome father in the name of Jesus Christ not for a form or fashion but it's a declaration of believers who claim a Divine promise that was just read out of your word through an unworthy vessel here but your word is worthy and it demands and it commands the authority over heavens and earth it's your word nothing greater nothing more powerful nothing more true nothing more real than your word and Lord we claim these promises on our life Lord we claim the healing that we need not just in our bodies but in our minds in our souls Lord in our spirits to be healed to be risen up oh God we thank you that we have a pure word to stand upon we're not hoping we're not guessing as we come to the table we're not hoping but we know that we have the correct interpretation of your word because you revealed it to us it is not a boast Lord we're not bragging it's just what it is you you have you have you have saved us and you have made us glad you given us the joy of the word and we know Lord in this life we have our disappointments and discouragements misunderstandings but Lord you give us something more valuable than gold or silver you give us faith and a predes at seed to recognize your word Lord I pray you'll raise up our young people out of whatever discouragement the young men young Brothers the elders the board members even the pastor of the church that you'll raise them out of their discouragement and despair even through our faith which is our victory that overcomes the world and Lord I pray that you'll cleanse us us right now from all unrighteousness as we do this great command of your word Lord we believe you Lord there's nobody like you and we take your word over anybody else's word today and Lord we've been put to the test but Lord there's nobody like you and we want to pass every test Lord for the rest of our life Lord whatever would come our way as our brother spoke this morning Jonah and Abraham and we've been both Lord we've been both but Lord we're still here because you give us Faith the most valuable thing and when Satan sees an ounce of Faith he cries for help but Lord we show him no pity we rebuke him we claim the victory we tread over him we defeat him on every territory any place any time under any circumstance Lord give us the grace give us your mercy we pray and ask in Jesus name we claim it now amen praise the Lord amen amen we'll start with verse number 23 I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which broken which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sub saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world isn't it good

days when we can and um I believe that's the example brother random gave us but Jesus said as often as you do it and along with the Lord's Supper is the foot washing we'll find that in the scriptures here supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all all things into his hand that he was come from God and he went to God he rised from supper he laid aside his garments and he took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him to him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head and Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them know ye what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that ye should do as I've done to you verily verily I say unto you the

know what's wrong she's at the hospital again now and maybe our brother Israel could just take this to the Lord before we go but just to want to share a testimony with you so we've had prayer for my mother a few times she's been in the hospital um first time that she's had covid and so she's been very weak with that we went to visit her last night and that part of the message restoration of the brid tree that our pastor had ask us to listen to joy and I had listened to that we're just talking about sending the enforcer out and and that's been such an encouragement such a help to us and just today we were listening to a song and it was that our God is tremendous and the little ailia sung here with the choir and and just said in that one he's our enforcer and then started going through the different names of Jehovah he's Jehovah nii and I thought you know it's just spot on with what we've been hearing here and we live so far below our Privileges and so just we we just Joy felt to have a little prayer with my mom last night and you know just brought that you know we we send that enforcer and we're claiming the healing and Satan you have no right to this and so that that uh we hear that on the tape and it was somebody something that was stolen from somebody it was their car that was stolen and I think we all all have things that we can say you know State Satan has tried to steal my joy he's tried to seal my family members my son my daughter and let's just believe with that here he's trying to steal somebody's Health there a high fevers for four to five days they don't know what's wrong but amen let's just believe as we stand together this evening we'll call on that enforcer for whatever we have need of there's healing in the cup but let's not just claim that for us and what we came through the line for tonight but Amen brother brother Caleb if you could come and take these needs to the Lord for us this evening dismiss us in prayer and then we'll just sing a couple more songs of of worship let's pray for our pastor I me just see Satan's tactics he's predictable he's persistent but here with special meetings come up trying to take his voice away knowing the burden The Strain just how nice that we want things to be as a church for those that are coming out here and it's difficult when you're want to talk and want to visit and want to want to fellowship and you don't have the voice to do it so we just want to claim a a touch in body for brother Israel tonight and amen guys good brother Caleb come up if you would so we shared the testimony and Mom called today and she sounded like a different person she had energy and um so expect probably tomorrow that she'll be released from the hospital and so we said she was doing much better she was doing much better and we just felt the presence of the Lord come in that room last night knew that God heard the prayer he sent the enforcer and and we serve a living God tonight and I'm so thankful for that [Music] [Music] Lord Jesus today you've given us a blessing Lord all morning and this evening Lord Jesus your children Lord that you knew from the foundation the world lord lord they're in a

don't believe so but we'll sing uh when don't we sing have faith in God have fath in God yes have faith in God [Music] have faith in God for the answer have faith in God yes have faith in God [Music] have faith in God have faith in God for the answer have faith in God yes h faith in [Music] God have faith in [Music] God have faith in God for the answer have faith in God have your seats for just a moment if you would brother Jensen has a testimony that he wanted to share with us here this evening you know I think we all appreciated what brother John preached this morning and U you know I was thinking you know brother bam made a statement about Jonah and it's one of those little nuggets or Jewels but you know Nineveh was a very Wicked City and I'm a student of revivals for the last 40 years or more and the Book of Jonah is one of the greatest Revival in the Old Testament and somewhat in the new because when Jonah walked through that city the whole city repented over 60,000 people they felt conviction and and the whole city went to sackcloth and Ashes and they even put sackcloth on the animals because they were in beastiality it's a very Wicked place but one thing that's interesting about Nineveh is they worship the god Deon the fish God they live right by the Tigers and so picture that in your mind if you go back in history in the that culture the priest was in a garment that looked like a fish and they had the little headdress that looked like what the pope wears fish gun and they're out there on the bank of the Tigris River and they're worshiping their fish God ding everybody got that in their mind and no doubt there was quite a few people standing around as they were worshiping their fish God and all of a sudden this fish this specially prepared fish now the prophet deals with this on with the tapes it swims up to where they're worshiping their fish God and the fish kind of goes up on the shore and throws up a prophet and [Music] he's he's got seaweed all over him and he picks himself up and the people are just a prophet just was spit out of their God the prophet said no wonder they repented cuz Jo Jonah stood up and he kind of wiped some off and he looks around and revent repent for God's going to destroy this city in 40 days and he walks through the city and I mean people repented cuz this God is delivering a mouthpiece now look that quote up I've I've I've studied a lot of preachers through history no one came up with that thought but you know there was something Supernatural about that cuz God has a purpose huh and there's a reason they repented there's a reason that shook that whole city because God did something unusual very [Music] unusual a prophet comes out of a fish I just had to share that I don't know it just you know sometimes things burn in your heart and you think God does something more he likes to do something that's not natural that's right he likes to do something that's extraordinary because we serve an extraordinary God when he comes present he can shake a church he can shake a family he can shake a city he can shake a nation you never know what he's going to do I know sometimes in this message we hear what the prophet said but don't give up on this nation completely cuz there's little pockets and groups of people you know I was talking to a man that brother Israel wants me to do some touchup pain in his house and brother Israel I talked to him he started talking I told him brother Israel is a pastor he says really I said yeah I've known him for 20 years and we started talking about the Lord and He said he was he's in his 80s early 80s and he he uh had been a presbyterian and a Methodist and and uh his wife died four years ago and you know one thing I love to do I like to talk to people that have never heard nothing amen I mean we have such a privilege being in the greatest message that's ever been upon the face of the Earth shame on us if we don't share it hello shame on us and uh he said you know he said I was in church all my life but two years ago a pastor I was going to a church and the Pastor said do you know if you died you'd go to heaven and it shocked him he couldn't answer yes yet been in church Presbyterian Methodist and that Pastor led him to Christ and he said brother Joe I was born again [Music] and I thought wow wow and so I shared with him my card so he can listen to my our our family's testimony but I thought you know maybe he'll come here one day and sitting here something way different than what he's used to how many knows when you come to the message sometimes you're in shock therapy hello it's shock therapy but all of a sudden you realize everything I learned on my life I got to discard CU there's there's something new there's something fresh these people have their eyes on Christ not a building or a preacher but you pray for him his his name is brother green you know we need as a you know we need as a church sometimes and start praying give us a burden for the lost help me to open my mouth Lord let me share it with my neighbor let me share it with someone because you know we've been talking about faith I'll tell you how to increase your faith start witnessing to people hello you say well brother Joel I'm shy it's okay swallow and witness huh swallow and witness leave some books at the doctors of the dentist's office and if you don't want to put your phone number put brother Israel's he'd love to get some phone calls I can't believe it I read this book do you have any more of these books would you like phone calls like that brother huh but witness you want to increase your faith and you know what when you start witnessing people it's good to be rejected hello it's good to be rejected that strengthens your faith when you're called a bromite or you know they look at you and walk away it's good to be rejected cuz Jesus said if they do it in the green tree what are they going to do in the dry so go ahead and witness share share what you have yes sir share what you know yes sir yes sir because whether it's in a church I love to share what I had when I first gave my heart to Jesus I went to all my buddies I used to take drugs and drink with you know they might look at you like a deer in the headlights but share with them amen yes amen amen amen God bless you bless thank amen let's stand together I am learning to Le on Jesus sing it one more time I'm learning to Le learning to Le I'm learning to lean on [Music] finding more power that i' ever dreamed I'm learning to lean on
