[Music] Sunday morning God hiding himself in Simplicity is the title of the the message we've been going through for the last few weeks and uh we'll take a scripture in Matthew chapter 11 brother random takes here if you turn your Bibles there with me pardon me in verse number 25 before we read that let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for uh bringing us together once again Lord we ask your blessings upon the service Lord bless those that are on their way bless the other classes Lord the the younger uh classes this morning the teachers and the students there speak to their hearts speak to our heart Lord we just love you we ask your blessings now in Jesus name we pray amen Matthew chap 11 and verse number 24 but I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for that land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou H has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight amen let's sing only believe amen oh only believe only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all all things are possible only God bless you may be seated brother Ral are you ready ready I want shock you a little bit Hallelujah the Rapture will be the same way yes it'll be so simple no doubt to be likewise till the Rapture will come one of these days and nobody will know nothing about it now don't don't don't get up now but study just a minute I'm sure enough clothing the Rapture will come in such a simple way till the judgments will fall and they'll see the son of man and they say wasn't we supposed to have such and such and wasn't there supposed to be a lie sent to us and wasn't there supposed to be a Rapture Jesus will say it's already happened and you didn't know it God in Simplicity now this week we're go get some offer he teaching I notice the Rapture will be so few go in that bright it'll not be now see how the teachers has got it they got charts and they go show 10 million people coming up here all the methodists if it's a Methodist preacher if it's a Pentecostal all the Pentecostals coming it will never touch there'll be maybe one leave Jeffersonville just somebody come up missing they say well you never the rest of there'll be one leave Georgia there'll be one leave in Africa and let's say there' be 500 people a living will go in the translation now that ain't that ain't the church body this is a bride that ain't the church this is the bride the church will come up with the thousands but that's in the next Resurrection they live not for the space of a th years see but in the bride if 500 people left the Earth this very minute the world would know nothing about it Jesus said there be one in a bed now take one leave one that's at night time there' be two in a field over on the other side of the earth I'll take one and leave one and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man than everything will move just as common as it can be a fanatic message you'll go by and the first thing you know something this Minister going somewhere he can never come back he probably went to Woods hunting he has never returned no more and this fell went somewhere you know what happened I believe that young girl she she must have been CAU away somewhere you know somebody take that girl out in rer probably told her Riv she me nobody half of 99 out of every uh may say one out of every 100 million they ever know anything about it if somebody it's acquainted with say the girl's missing while I can't understand she never did leave like that no and when they say the the graves will open how's the graves going to open when I I haven't got time to get into this what I wanted to I'm going to have to take it just to show you the Simplicity of God and that calcium potach and everything when when everything that's in you of materials only makes a spoonful amen that's right and what that does it breaks on back into spirit and life God just speaks the Rapture come it ain't going out there and the angels come down and shove up the grav get out of an old dead carcass you what it is is born of sin to begin with but a new one made in its lik know we have this will die again see nobody say the graves will open the dead shall walk out that may be true but not open the way you say that's right see it won't be like that it'll be a secret because he said he come like a thief in the night he's already told us this the Rapture then judgments will strike sin plague sickness and everything and people cry for death to take them when the Judgment Lord why is this judgment up on us when you said there be a Rapture first you say it's already com and you didn't know it God hiding himself in Simplicity oh my all right all it's already happening you do it why don't Believers believe the simple signs of his coming they're expecting the all this things that spoke up of the scripture and the moon's going to go down in the middle of sun in the middle of the day and there's going to be all kinds of things oh if we just had I got the notes WR here on it to show what them things are and we'll get it on the breaking of these seals this week anyhow see see there it is just where it's already passed and you didn't know see if it is if the angel of the Lord will break them seals forth to it remember seal with them seven mysterious Thunders now what why can't people believe the simple Simplicity of a humble bunch of people see and the the voice of the signs of God why can't they believe it just like it always been the true word of God being made manifest it's they're too smart and too educated to believe the simple form of the written word they want to put their own interpretation to it it don't mean this it don't mean that see it does mean that listen may I say this right quick now even the visions that God gives here at the place it's so misunderstood that's you hear me on the tape say say what the tape say say what the vision say now if you're Wide Awake you'll see something I hope I don't have to hold up my hand and show you see see see you're it's it's here amen We Believe yes sir smart educationals miss it the simple Visions when they revealed in such Simplicity till it just cover little top of people's head Hallelujah the calls of seen the vision told you all about going up there hunting and you know I just stumble people and there God sent it up there for the very purpose to come back and interpret it right around short of the going of my mother and things like that and it come back and told it beforehand and it happened just exactly the way he said it would do see and yet John came right out there and confessed he said I'm not no Messiah but I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness and then that very disciples say why there's a scribe saying the the scripture teach that Elias was first com the Simplicity of God goes just Roots right over the top of people's head let me take this man close I will for the help of God he look now let's break this down then I I'm sorry to keep keep telling you look sorry to hold you but just a few hours we come back look let's take a simple drop of ink everything is for a purpose you've gathered here this morning for a purpose I eat at your house Charlie Nelly you cooked for me for a purpose everything's for a purpose this church is erected for a purpose there's nothing without a purpose and a call let's take the simple drop of ink now can you hear me let's take a simple drop of ink and look at it what is it a drop of ink where did he come from all right let's take this drop of ink now it's it say it's black ink now that ink is for a purpose it can write my pardon in a out of a Penitentiary it can write my pardon from a death cell that right he can write John 3:16 and Save My Soul by believe leaving is that right amen or it can sign my death warrant amen see it can condemn me at the Judgment bar it's far a purpose is that right let's look at that little ink and see where it come from now it's ink it's been put together chemicals and so forth just become ink and it's black you drop it on your clothes it'll stain it but we have manufactured a stuff called bleach you women use Clorox bleach well I take that one drop of ink and drop it into a tub of of bleach now what happened to the ink see why uh bleach has been manufactured invented and manufactured chemicals together that'll break up that color in soat so you can't find it now part of the bleach is water water is H2O which is hydrogen and oxygen and both hydrogen and oxygen both are dangerous explosives and then hydrogen and oxygen is actually ashes it's what it is that's right chemical ashes it's chemical ashes now now put it together you got water but break it you got hydrogen and oxygen just keep on going back now in getting in this let's take I cannot now there might be chemist sitting here and I I want to say it because there will be chemist listening at it I don't know the farmer but I want to just explain it in my own humble way trusting that God will reveal himself in it look I drop that drop of ink into a uh a bleach what happens immediately the black Steen is gone you couldn't find it again if you had to it's gone you'll never see it no more what happen now you don't see nothing come up from it you don't why don't you because it's broke up now science would say it turned back to its original acids what do the acids come from from see well you say it come from uh from uh certain things all right say for instance like fumes made acids where did fumes come from well it was uh we'll say fumes was made by um molecules where did molecules come from from atoms where did atoms come from Electronics where did they come from cosmic light see you're come back a past finding of chemist now and if it is a substance and a creation it has to come from a cre so you're not sitting here by chance that's right I'm not holding till 12:30 or 1:00 by Chance the foot steps of the righteous is order of the Lord see there's some reason for it there's some reason for you to believe there's some reason for you not to believe it's like there that ink now let's break that down now the first thing say as we get back to we bring it back as far as molecules now we took molecule I'd say number one time molecule 9 time molecule 12 now if it been 11 it would come out red but it it had to be 12 to make black then we'll take that down to Adam it was Adam and 96 * + 43 equal Adam uh 1611 if been 1612 it might have been purple see then you keep breaking it on down it shows that there was a something back on her to begin with now that's only common sense it's a creation has to have a Creator amen and it went out from a Creator and and then it it was determined and put into these different now science cannot take uh Adam B 16 * 12 * 14 * whatever like that to make that God had to do that and then it's brought down to a place to where it's got down into atoms then science can begin to touch it then it comes out into molecules then it can begin to see a little better then it comes out from that into something else and first thing it comes into chemicals and then they blend these together now when man before he sinned I'm closing but don't you miss it when man sinned he separated himself from God and crossed the great Chasm and put himself in death on this side he left his no way back exactly there's no way for him to get back but then when he did God accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a goat or sheep or something for blood which Adam spoke of or Abel spoke up on the other side of the chasm on that side he's a Son of God he's an offspring from God he's an inheritance of the earth he can control nature he can speak into existence why he's a Creator himself he's an offspring of God but when he crossed he separated his sunship he's a sinner by he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan and God took a sacrifice a chemical of the blood but the blood of bulls and goats did not divorce sin it only covered sin if I got a red spot on my hand and cover it with white the red spot's still there see it's still there but God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin it was a of his own son that when our confessed sin drops into God's bleach try to find it again the color of sin goes back through the mediators and down through the time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him till the day of the Judgment hallelujah what happens to the son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on his other side of the CM with no remembrance of sin against it no more there's no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he's free Hallelujah just as that Clorox the E can never be ink no more because it's broke up and sent back again and when confess sin is confessed and been dipped into the a man or a woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the dev and L on or his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of is bridged and never to come in remembrance no more Hallelujah and a man name Justified as the Son of God Simplicity Moses are the blood of bulls and goats with his confession in the word of God and God could take that simple man and put his words in his mouth and he proved that he was Jehovah servant for he could walk out there and Jehovah spoke to him by Vision he walked out stretched his hands towards the east and now remember God has spoke to him it's God's thought God uses man amen God spoke to him it's right right he said go stretch that rod in your hand towards the east and say flies Moses under the blood of that goat sheep walked out there and took that stick reached towards the east thus sayth the Lord let there be flies never heard a fly walked on back it's already spoke it's a thought now it's spoke it's expressed amen it's a word of God then it come into a human's lips a simple man under the blood of a bull or goat first thing you old green fly begin to fly around next thing you know they were 5 lbs per yard hallelujah what was it was the word of God spoken through Moses the Creator because under the blood he was standing in the presence of God and his own words wasn't his word he abide me and my words abide in you then ask what you will just giving you where's the church standing at Let There Be frogs and it was a frog in a country now our's time they were 10t deep in places what was it it was God the Creator hiding himself in a simple man I want to ask you something if the blood of a bull or a goat be used for a bleach which can only cover could put a man in position to speak the creative word of God and bring flies into his existence why would you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ blood who could speak a squirrel or something in do don't stumble over Simplicity believe that he still remains God oh my pardon of sin oh how I wish I could then Mark 11:22 you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said I've got three or four pages we just got to leave it go thank you God hiding himself in Simplicity don't you see there's something wrong somewhere there's something wrong somewhere when God makes a statement he cannot lie he made the promise see he hides in Simplicity it's so simple they educated The Scholar oh it's oh it's telepathy or something you know it's a God can sweep himself back down through the streams of time and tell you back under just exactly what happened tell you just exactly what you are today and what you will be to come that's still by the bleach of Jesus Christ who can take a sinner and bleach him into there and he stands in the presence of God and if you abide me in my words and you can ask what you will he that does Believe on me the works that I do shall he do also how you condemn me oh did not your own law say that those who the word of God came to the prophets did not you call them gods and then how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God they fail to see it they fail to see it now Church in the coming messages from tonight on don't fail to see it see the day that we're living and remember the blood of Jesus Christ takes sin so far from you and there's not even in the remembrance of God anymore it takes all stain sin had left the Crimson sting he washed it white as snow then before the throne I stand in him complete oh my how can I be complete how can I be complete because the blood not me but that blood stands between God and me I accepted it and he put it I'm a sinner but he's God Amen but the chemistry stands between me the kill of sin so God sees me just as white as the the water Bach the sin is gone it can't even reach him because there's a sacrifice there where is our faith to believe the simple word of God gu what God Said take him at his word god hides himself now in Simplicity in a humble little Bunch but one of these days oh GL to

this morning for a class reading those uh prayer requests that go up let's really remember those we'll try to you know some the Saints put requests in and they're really serious things and I know we're very busy and I know it's not on purpose you know we don't do it purposefully but you know someone was to call me and tell me that they were really going through something then I would try to take the time to uh hear you and and spend time in prayer and you know sometimes the prayer requests things get lost in that we see a big group of names but let's take those to Heart amen we see those that have needs those that are afflicted and those that need uh something from the Lord we'll want to attend to that Psalms 23 the Lord I'd like to read all of us to read this together how about that amen all together the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the Shadows of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod thy staff that comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever verse six again that's a declaration let's read that it's and Powerful declaration surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever praise the Lord you know really there's enough in that word right there where we can say amen and go home that's the truth there's it's all complete and it's just a few minutes of reading but it's not the amount you're reading but it's the content of what you're reading it's the the depth of it I'd like to take a scripture in St John chapter 21 for our text this morning very familiar it's the last chapter in John is writing he makes it clear that he wrote this these writings himself at the end there we all know the background of it our lord Jesus has um he's appeared himself he he has appeared to his disciples um I think it's 1 Corinthians 15 to a group of 500 to to the 12 to the apostles which is another group to James his brother and to Paul himself there were several people that saw and witnessed Jesus after his uh death burial and his resurrection they saw him and talked to him the women saw him and so after this he's talking with Peter of course we know the testimony Peter do you love me feed my sheep feed my Lambs then he goes on to tell Peter in verse 18 how he would leave and how when he was young he was this way but when he gets older there'll be someone to carry you and take you about and he tells him in verse 19 this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God and when he has spoken this he saith unto him follow me then Peter turning about seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth thee pet Peter see seeing him saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do Jesus sath unto him if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me then went this saying abroad or rumor we say then went the saying abroad among the Brethren that the that disciple should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee that's the title of the message this morning what is that to thee let us pray father we ask your blessings on your word this morning bless each heart bless those that have gathered Lord bless me move away everything that I would say or think that's not right just move it aside the carnality and Lord may you be magnified and glorified May the message touch deep into the heart of your people today bless the Saints there in Phoenix Brother Art Brother Stevie those Saints holding um the word of life together just pray your blessings on them Father and each one that's gathered we pray in jesus' name amen God bless you you can make you may be seated what is that to thee follow thou me interesting how rumors get started um this is almost like Jesus started it he said it in a way he like he gave bait for a rumor to start he there's a lot of things he could have said he could have said well this man he's going to be in God's hands or this man he'll be healthy or this man he might start a church he could have said something that possibly possibly it was true but he he said Jesus says what if it if this man stays alive what if he never tastes death you know and and Peter asked Jesus this question after Jesus had told him what his end would be so the Lord tells Peter you know uh when you were young you went about uh when you were young you GED yourself you walk whether you wanted to go what you West but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall GTH thee and carry thee with thou would go so the Lord is giving Peter his final instructions and it's something how he gets his instructions and then he looks over and sees John the disciple that Jesus loved John the one who actually asked Jesus the question hey Lord who's going to betray you sitting on his breast at the table T and God unveils that that the one that dips his bread in the soup or the the liquid there he's the one and so it was revealed that it was Judas this John uh what what's going on with him where's he going you told me about me but I want to know about him you know it's interesting how we want to know about we're more nosy than perhaps we realize and we want to get into other folks business don't we we don't want them to know we're nosy but we're nosy anyhow we want to if I could just be a fly on the wall you hear hear that statement what does that mean you want to be there you don't want people to know that you're there but you want to hear if I could just hear what's going on when they're riding home hear where they talk about when they're alone hear what the bosses are saying about me hear what the Saints are talking about me if I can just Lord what about him and Jesus simply says what is that to thee follow thou me me now there's a scripture that ID like you to turn to it's in the Old Testament and it is in the book of Deuteronomy if we'd be so kind to do that oh my I think I left yeah it's here I didn't hear no Bibles turning but maybe they're turning maybe they're swiping them over all right in Deuteronomy chapter 2 how many Saints with me today let me see your hand openly okay so those that hav't raised your hand i'm watching you that you can come on board and help me out here this morning all right Deuteronomy chapter 2: 1 when we turned and took our journey in the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me and we Compass Mount seir many days days and the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau which dwell in SE and they shall be afraid of you take you good heed unto yourselves therefore meddle not with them for I will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breath because I have given Mount seir unto Esau for a possession you shall buy meat from them for money that you may eat you shall also buy water of them for money that you may drink for the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works that of thy hand he knoweth thy walking through this Great Wilderness these 40 Years of the Lord thy God has been with thee thou has lacked nothing and when we pass from our Brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in s through the way of the plain from elth and from eion gabber we turned and passed by the way of the Wilderness of Moab and the Lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither contend with them in battle for I will not give the of their land for possession because I have given AR unto the children of lot for a possession so who are these two groups of people the moabites and Esau now Moab is the grandson of lot if you remember and Esau is the brother to Jacob and here is Israel the children of Israel coming through their coast and their land and and going to the promised land that God had given to them they're on a journey now you know there's a scripture I believe it's in uh ezek uh uh um Exodus chapter we can find it here real quickly but Exodus uh 30 or 13 somewhere in there where the Lord actually leads Israel the harder way purposefully and and he he has them not go through the land of the Philistines because going through that land was it would have been uh easier but they might have fear because of the war and so forth Exodus 13: 17 and 18 there was two routes that could have gone and the Lord purposely takes them the harder route by the way of the sea the Red Sea and so we we realize that the path that the Lord is directing them he's leading them it's not a random path it might appear random and it's going longer than it should have but it's still being directed by God Amen and while going into the land he's telling them who to meddle with and who not to meddle with who to take and who not to take and these two brothers they're actually brothers of Israel Esau can say that's my twin brothers children those are my nieces and nephew that's Israel we you know we were we raised up we're the same blood we got the same Heritage Abraham we got the same blood flowing through us but our inheritance our paths are different but we're still brothers and Moab can say the same thing they can say that Moab was a grandson to lot and lot was Abraham's nephew not just a any kind of a nephew that uh someone that Abraham put his life on the line for someone that Abraham interceded for someone that Abraham loved and cared for amen if if lot was destroyed there would be no Moab so Moab is in existence because of Father Abraham but they're not in the same group as Israel but they're still our Brothers now this is an interesting relationship and we still have those relationships today and we have to be very careful very very careful on how we approach people and the way we think of people amen amen you know God has servants that are not really with Israel he has Kings and kingdoms that in the Bible he calls them their servant amen and one of these cases is in Genesis let's see if we can find it here quickly excuse me I didn't write it down but Genesis chapter 17 somewhere no no Genesis chapter 20 somewhere right in there somebody can help me find it there where the great king uh when Abraham said she is my sister somebody find that chapter for me and the King went in and took Sarah and Genesis 20 thank you brother I want you to hear this conversation it's very very interesting in Abraham verse one Journey from then towards a South Country verse three but God came to aimc in a Dream by night so what's taking place here let's just back it up so here is Abraham he's calling he's called out of ER to go into Canaan to possess the land that God is going to give him God is establishing a covenant with him that his Covenant will be it's a very weird Covenant the Covenant is that every one of your men The Eighth Day age will be circumcised I don't know of any other group of people have to do that I don't know of the spiritual significance I don't know why God chose that but that is the Covenant I'm making with you Abraham not only you but your servants and anybody that you purchase anything that belongs to you will be circumcised like this you're an old man uh your your son ishmail he's older they'll all be circumcised but from this day forward eight days your the boys will be circumcised it's a that's a difficult task it's it's work it's work I mean you got it's got to be clean tools it's Medical procedure it's you know it's the child is with the birth there's there's a you know it's not it's not an easy task it's not like picking a fruit off a tree or planting or you know cutting an animal this is your sons every one of them and every son that doesn't do it is cut off from me this is the Covenant that I'm establishing with you Abraham and so he has this Covenant he's moving on through the land of of IMC he has this agreement with did it in Egypt already we'll do it again now if they see you Sarah they'll kill me because they're heathens anyways and they don't know what we know they'll kill me and take you so this is what we'll do say that you're my sister and if we really break it down we really are brother and sister but you tell them that and that'll spare our life so here a aik's men find her they bring her to aik's home and aik is every intentions am Marian Sister Sarah but God came to aimik in a Dream by night and said to him behold Thou Art but a dead man for the woman which thou Hast taken for she is a man's wife look at aimc but aimc had not come near her and he said what he call him huh huh what the Bible say help me preach he said Lord I thought we only can say Lord I thought we can only want to give you that title I thought we're the only ones that has this relationship with you God knows more people than perhaps you realize and people have relationships and Covenants with God that perhaps we don't know about about it's not our business to know it's our business to walk where God called us to walk amen amen he says Lord will thou slay also a righteous Nation they ain't righteous he's talking to the Lord and said he said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the Integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this and God said unto him in a dream yes I know that thou did this in the Integrity of thy heart for I also withheld thee from sinning against me so King AMC I don't want you to sin against me this is why I'm giving you a dream amen amen the Lord you know we look at the grace on Abraham's side but look at the grace extended to this quote unquote Heathen King look like God cared for him look like God was interested in him that's right yes for I also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered I Thee not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and if thou restore her not thou shall surely die thou and all that are thine therefore ailec Rose early in the morning called all his servants and told these things in their ears the men were so afraid AMC called Abraham and said unto him what has thou done unto us what have I have I offended thee that thou has brought on Me In My Kingdom a great sin thou has done Deeds unto me that thou ought not to be done and the bibic said unto Abraham what sawest thou that thou has done this thing so the king is asking him a legitimate question why would you throw me under the busl why would you potentially why would you put me in a situ you lied to me you lied to me you told me that was your sister and in the Integrity of my heart I was going to marry her properly and look at Abraham's answer and Abraham said because I thought surely God don't speak to y'all surely the fear of God is not in this place and they will slay me for my wife say he he thought aik they didn't know God God don't speak to them they don't get conviction they don't get dreams God's not able to correct them you know you know everybody's in God's hands did you know that did you know your boss is in God's hand hands the neighborhood association is in God's hands anything connected to you is in God's hands and can't nobody do nothing to you unless God permits it or allows it amen am that's how big our God is amen and so he gives Abraham all this good stuff money animals and S on their way now um you'll see a relationship similar with the father-in-law of Moses god uses Jethro to instruct Moses and he was a priest he offered something to somebody and God honored it some kind of way now he didn't walk with Moses he didn't go the way that they went but he still was a servant of God and now here God is now and instructing Israel when you get to Esau and you get to Moab leave him alone don't argue with them don't fuss with them leave them alone they have their inheritance I've given it to them they have their inheritance I've given it to them and you have an inheritance also now oh my praise the Lord how many thank God for that you know we lose control of who's in and who's out now you know Believers like to know who is True Believers and who's not seem like we must know that we like to go around giving people the quote unquote word test to find out if they're really Believers or not but that's really not our test to give to find out if there are believer or not that's God's business now as it pertains to how I'm going to live and how I'm going to operate and what I'm going to do in my life I need to give everything the word test for my life and you know this uh scripture in St John 21 where Peter is asking the question and Jesus answered it the way he did there went a saying fourth that John is not going to taste death now I'm curious is if many of the doctrines that come forth if they're really some of the doctrines I can actually almost classify them as a saying or a rumor because it's founded upon some man's idea and they you know if this is that and that is this that must mean this and so uh in the um Church ages we realize that deeds will lead to Doctrine if you're doing something and it becomes important to you then we can make a Doctrine out of it you know no mustaches long sleeve shirts something like that you know the skirt's got to touch the ankle we can make a Doctrine out of it we'll we can bring it in the word and make it you know because it's a deed now that moves into Doctrine and so this saying started from a comment that Jesus made now one of the dangers with uh and the reason this happens many times I trust the Lord will bless you and help you this morning the reason this happens many times because there are places in the word and brother bam says it many times that the scripture and the Bible is written in between the lines so you have to read in between the line as a love letter it's a letter between God and you God and other individuals God in the church God in the world but it's really a love letter between you and God he he wrote the Bible to you personally and when you have that relationship then you go into it reading it not so you can find points to argue with people but it's a love affair you're reading it for you father this is your word thank you that's what that means oh Lord open that up to me I was curious about this and then you pray and you read and it's a love letter and that's where the supernatural comes down and blesses you amen the bad side to that or the other side to that is that this reading in between the line can be you know interpreted as Revelation amen and God's going to reveal something to you in between the line read in between the lines and and try to come up with something to make it fit our our understanding amen and we'll take the message now we begin to read in between the lines of the message and we'll come up with this conclusion and they start from somewhere they come from somewhere it's not just you know that you know Jesus said it he did say what if what if this man ter till I come he did say that that's valid rumor material did you hear what Jesus said about John what' he say say he's not going to taste death you know that the the old you know I whisper to Trevor he tells little brother he tells sis he tells brother you come back around it's a whole another story then it's a whole another message then it's second hand or third hand or fifth hand and then somebody always feels like you know what he didn't mean to say that what he meant to say was do and you add a little flavor add a little salt add a little pepper and it's a different recipe than what we started with amen and it happens it's it's human beings do it it's innocent it's it's not it's not abstract it it happens amongst people who handled the word there's some statements that are made that we how did I put that together what did he mean by that and then how do they you know then read in between the lines so let's take a few places where brother bam actually talks about reading in between the lines I'm going to take three places here and then we'll move on is that okay in the message an ins sign brother bam says paragraph six say there's a little between a line you have to read in the Bible do you believe that see it's a love letter wrote to the church there's no need of a seminary trying to teach it cuz it's not known by minds of the of the world of this world it's h I've hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and will reveal it to babe such as we learn it's truth that's the reason we got all these different forms and kinds of religions and churches it's all right let it go God's got he's the one that takes care of the books look notice how it was let me give you a little something between the line you know sometimes s we get overseas I'm very fond of my wife she writes me a letter and she says Dear Billy I'm sitting here tonight I'm thinking very much of you I'm so and so now that's what she's saying but I'm reading right between the lines I know it goes a little deeper than that uhhuh and if you got the Holy Spirit you're in love with Christ you can read between God's lines there's something in there amen can you say amen amen then Along come Jose paragraph 10 drop down he says then Along come Joseph he says now wait they put his bones in the coffin I I and my hand on an old Leaf coffin here not long ago there he was supposed to had his bone in he says when you get out here to my burying Burying my bones up there don't bury me down here I wonder why it isn't written in the Bible but there were prophets they could read between the lines amen who could prophets amen they knew that the first fruits of the Resurrection wasn't coming in Egypt it was coming in Palestine yes Amen brother bam continues in the message demonology and says this I'm not going to stay on here long he says this here paragraph 32 here he stands on the earth the most you have to read between the lines to get the Bible a lot of times so here brother Bram is in encouraging us there it is let's get that here he stands here the most you have to read between the lines to get the Bible a lot of times so here's brother brandham is encouraging us that in order to read the Bible you need to be able to read between the lines but what is it founded upon it's founded upon a love affair so we're not reading in between the lines to make it say something it doesn't say we're not reading in between the lines to argue with other people but it's a relationship we're trying to see what he's telling us personally amen and the examples of reading in between the lines brother brandom gives us and someone else can help me with this later but when when brother bam is talking about reading in between the lines I just read the quote for you that it's the prophets they could read between the lines what did he what examples did he give of this the example he gives of job's burying place in Palestine when when job was buried there near heam or Mella and then Abraham wanted to be buried there Jacob wanted to be buried there Joseph all of the prophets they wanted to be buried there and brother Brandon brings it out why did they want to be buried there because the resurrection would take place there he brings that out there's no New Testament scripture that says this is why job was buried there or this is why Abra was buried there but a prophet was able to see that shadow see that type see the action and bring out to us this is why they did it all right another example he gives us of Abraham and Sarah's body change amen he was well and stricken in age 99 years old 100 years old Sarah 75 years old and they're going to have a baby they're taking these Journeys uh Old Kings want to marry her grandma and brother Brandon brings it out that they were 22 to 25 years old that their bodies were changed there's no New Testament scripture that tells us that there's no Old Testament scripture that tells us that but when you put the pieces together those things that are on the line in between the line a prophet can bring it out to you this is what the prophet I don't know anyone else that brings that type like that it's a prophet that does that amen amen he has the Liberty to read read between the lines another one of this reading in between the line brother Brandon brings it many times on this revelation of the son of man and the angel in Genesis 18 that asks where is thy wife Sarah she's in the tent behind you you know you can't really put that together the the angel he asked Abraham where's your wife Sarah like I mean if he knows what her heart saying in her heart he ought to I don't know where she's at but he ask him the question where's your wife Sarah oh she's in the tent behind you and he tells and she's laughs in her heart and the angel picks it up and the prophet kind of he kind of goes around it and he and he brings it many times that you got to read in between the lines of what I'm trying to say here of who William brandom is for example but I don't think that that Liberty of reading in between the lines belongs to a five-fold Ministry Pastor preacher teacher evangelist I can't see it I've seen pastors reading between the lines and they'll come up with a Doctrine but what is it on the line did the prophet say it that way amen and that's the question that we have you know some of these doctrines the brothers that tell you well you know you got to you got to read in between the lines and of the tent you got to read in between the lines like reading between the lines with who and with what glasses am I reading in between the lines we have to say what's on the line is that right yes so we can see that this rumor going out or these doctrines that can go out these sayings that are inaccurate they can go out because somebody gets it upon thems okay I know what he's saying I I know what he's saying I know exactly what he's saying he's going to do this he's going to do this going to do this and it's mere a saying or a rumor let me take one more here in the message the angel of the Covenant he says this here our demonology paragraph 33 when job died he specified his burying Place Abraham watch between the lines now you readers this is not written right in the word you have to read it between it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent when job died he specified his burying ground Along Came Abraham when Sarah died he brought a parelal ground bought it you know how he did with his shekels of Sil silver near job and he Buri her and when he was di he was buried with her Abraham begot Isaac Isaac died Isaac slept with Jacob or with Abraham Abraham begot Isaac Isaac begot Jacob Jacob died down in Egypt but he said don't bury me down here why huh take me back up to Palestine and bury me why bury me with my fathers in the cave Jacob begot Joseph we know the perfect type of Christ well when Joseph was dying he says don't bury my bones down here why he was a prophet he foresaw things that the rest of them didn't see said said take me up to Palestine and bury me with my fathers and Moses after 400 years took Joseph's bones bury them in Palestine I wonder why job said I know my redeemer liveth in the last day he'll stand on the earth and though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself my eyes Shall Behold and not another that God would stand on the earth and he'd see him Abraham said if job's going to see him I'm going to be buried right with him so I can see him too ain't that nice I'll bury Sarah there bury them all there for they know that the first fruits of the Resurrection wasn't coming out of Egypt it was coming out of Palestine so that's that's one of those in between we take it as common message knowledge but not not all the Christian churches understand this terminology because they don't have the in between the line the prophetic eyes to see in between the line why do you have to leave them bones take them bones dead Dry Bones he's dead why you making me swear to take your bones all the way from Egypt and carry them dead bones and wait till you get into the promised land and be and be why what's make us go through all that trouble for because he had a revelation where's the resurrection going to where is it coming from that's where I want to be buried don't leave me down here swear he made him swear didn't he and the prophet brings it out it's an in between the line and this in between the line privilege Saints belongs to the prophets because when you get others let let me start reading in between the lines all right with my background my my my way of thinking and let Reverend so and so start reading in between the lines with his background his way of thinking and it's going to be contrary allog together but let the prophet read in between the lines and then we read what the prophet read you we got so much to preach brother Scott I don't need to read in between the lines in between a line in between another line we got so much on the line 1,200 tapes sir on the line man you can preach that amen all right somebody praise the Lord should I close now where's brother Ark where's brother so and so where's Reverend keep going I ain't nobody telling me to keep going all right brother art said keep going I can hear them somehow some way so this reading in between the lines belong belongs to the prophet and this is this will stop this the sayings and the rumors that go out I used to I I had you know I had some stuff I had in between the lines I remember when I first married and we were living up in Montreal I was on the job site with some brothers uh building the chimney and working construction and subject came up something and I and I quoted something to the brother and he said wow I never heard that before oh yeah it's on the tape yeah it is oh I'll find it for you that's what I told him yeah it's on the tape the prophet said it well he he didn't quite say it the way I said it the way I was saying it was the way the brothers who was I was listening to that's the way they were saying it after they done digested it and made it read in between the line of what the prophet is really saying and I'm quoting that and the brother said oh wow show me that quote Oh oh sure I'll find it for you go back brother bons I'm looking for that quote can't find it can't find it where did the prophet say that oh find out he didn't say that like wow my who am I quoting I preached a message like that a few few years back who are you quoting people going around quoting well brother per brother brother Jones said brother Perry said brother McHugh said brother Lee said brother brother uh whoever said brother Roger Collins said brother so and so said brother who whatever brother Israel said whatever the Reverend said but what did the prophet say amen amen I hope that settles down in your heart for this is where our focus should be on on how these things get started now I'm going to go into the message just for a moment and this is the message as I was with Moses and this is this is Joshua now after um Moses had given him his commission so now uh the commission was leave Esau alone leave Moab alone you're going to the promised land so don't go to the left or to the right you stay right with the the LW of Moses you remember when the Lord came to Joshua he told him that he said says uh uh meditate on the laws day and night this book of the law don't turn to the left don't turn to the right it's almost similar with our message on Sunday stay in the middle of the road don't get caught on that side or that side stay right with this right here amen and he admonished Joshua that and so Joshua had to move forward look at this in paragraph 28 in the message as I was with Moses but people came to brother bam about seeking a gift in paragraph 27 26 someone asked me sometime say shall we seek our gifts now for our Ministries some Methodist Brethren who had just received the Holy Ghost I says no don't do that when you do then God can't use you I said the only thing to do is just go ahead be in a Christian if God has called you he'll place you just exactly where you belong usually those who seek and try to get things if God would give them something they more or less be stuffed shirt usually the man that God calls is the man that's trying to run from him if anything Moses and Paul and different ones trying to get away from the call so very nice way the prophet brings that out and he paragraph 30 so this is a tri tremendous task we'll get into it but Jos Joshua is now Comm commissioned now now Moses is dead now and you're going to lead the people and it's a tremendous task for Joshua you put yourself in his shoes you got to stand in line with what Moses brought there's nobody greater than Moses nobody more anointed than Moses and you Joshua are going to take Moses's place you might have a few critics you might have people that Flex against you where that ain't the way Moses would have did it you'd have all that human problem but this is your calling Joshua and when you go forward you're going to make mistakes in trying to do this and I like this in paragraph 30 he says although if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me am amen I never have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything I'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try amen I mean it's try try he said I'm not a real good witness H you know brother Shaw is probably a good witness he's a people person or sister son show she can be a witness let her go talk to you know this teenager go talk to this one over there but you haven't even tried yet well if I try I'm going to stumble over my words I going to come across WR but at least try try to be a witness he called us to be a witness at least try it's better to try and fail than not try at all amen Satan get you doing nothing because you don't want to make a mistake and not making a mistake is a great thing you don't want to make mistakes on purpose of course none of us wants to put our foot in our mouth or you know you know do something that's wrong but I I if it's to the cost where we're not doing anything at all one time it was said that the Ballard and Ballard Flower Company hired a man and he was going to sign his name and the man had no eraser on the end of his pencil pretty confident huh and Mr Balor said to him why haven't you got an ER eraser he said could you imagine somebody making this statement this is funny could you imagine look in the mirror and make that statement try it you you probably couldn't even finish saying it right you try looking in the mirror and say I don't make mistakes who you fooling you can't even fool yourself on that one you you'll bust up laughing at yourself stop Israel stop and this man said I don't make mistakes he says then I can't use you because if you make if you don't make mistakes you won't do nothing that's true God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes he holds you responsible for your willful sin he that sins willfully after he's received the knowledge of the truth but a man that's going to do something is going to blunder he's going going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely called and God is in his heart he'll Rise Again amen can I go a little bit further here what the prophet of God says here about this what Joshua means here to the people and how this this crosses over even into the ministry paragraph 41 now Joshua the new Warrior only two left now that ever left the promised land and that was Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new Commander to lead an army to step into the place where a great man like Moses stood it was no little task and I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister is called to stand where he did the works that I do shall you do also each minister is ordained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command now as a minister whoever Minister you are whatever degree of ministry you're in if you when you read that then that just moves everybody else out of your focus out of your vision because God didn't call you to follow other ministers am other pastors other song leaders other teachers God didn't call you to follow that God told you to follow Jesus Christ he is our example and this is the task that Joshua had was to follow exactly what Moses brought a tremendous task a task you can't take lightly a task that requires your utmost attention amen amen amen and the minister today he's called to that position skip down to paragraph 53 just for a moment he says this here God called ministers ought not to be so stuffed out with theology but have visit the land to where we're going bringing back evidence of the Divine love and power of Jesus Christ to make known to their congregation that there is a land beyond the river so look at that so that's the what the ministry is called to excuse me and the prophet of God goes forward and said this I read this for you all last couple weeks ago and I read it again paragraph 55 now Joshua and all of this knowing that the command was great but having the Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as we call it Reckless as long as he was pointed in the right way he might break up against a hill that that would knock him backwards but he was carried the right way so can the Church of the Living God be Reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way for he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you nor forsake you never forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he will not fail joshu Joshua he will not fail us he'll be with us and as we find J to take this commission knowing the responsibility responsibilities was leading him through lands that he have to go over into the other land he'd have to set up their Kingdom he'd have to divide the inheritance among them he know that the commission was tremendous far more than what Moses had done Joshua had more to do than Moses had to do another thing and this is getting to our text here paragraph 58 another thing he was to lead them along the border amongst their Brethren and they had already tasted blood he had to conquer them he had to keep them quiet as they marched on so is it today with this new Pentecostal group that's Rising now they've tasted denominationalism it's so hard to keep them down and brother ROM continues on on so this Esau and Moses the commission or the Commandment was don't fuss with them they are brothers but but but they have their inheritance and we have our inheritance now we are headed somewhere Saints we are given precious promises that we should be focused on this morning I don't think coming to church and even coming to this church is just the fill of time Gap but I think that I believe that the Lord wants to lead us somewhere and I believe that there's a a position and a place that God wants our faith to rise into for the hour that we live in Hallelujah now when brother bradam is talking through this message talking about the promised land he's bringing them through Egypt he's bringing them through the Wilderness and the promised land is a type of the Holy Ghost and but he he also brings it as a a type of the full promise it's a type of a power a power that God gives to the church paragraph 53 says it's to Divine love and power that this commission that this Joshua is trying to lead the people into this promised land now not everybody is focused on on the same things and what Esau is doing in their church and what Moab is doing in his church and the way they do things that's not my business we we're connected to them yes we know about them we're related to them they might do some things that might be great good ideas the denominational World their churches do things that are might be good ideas might be great but we have an example for us today and I don't need to stream a denominational preacher to find out the word of the Lord for my day God has given me that already now God uses other people yes he uses other Christians that are not in the message yes you know aimc was God's man God had a relationship with him but aimik didn't have to be circumcised aik didn't have what Abra Abraham had to go through as far as we know it's a different Covenant Al together amen you know if the Baptist and they've invited me to go preach I'll go preach for them am I've gone I can work with them as a brother under this right here under this right here under this right here but they don't know about this over here and I don't need to fuss and argue with them over this amen they have their they have their Covenant God put them there for a purpose you remember when Cain slew Abel he said Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear why didn't God just kill him no he didn't kill him he he said I I'm going to cover you I'm put a mark on you so nobody will kill you and he let him live because he has a purpose God has a purpose in a plan am amen exactly right amen and we want to get involved in that I was listening to the message the other day and brother man talking about this brother oh my I news Escape my mind but they had a a an army jet that was going to take him to go and re and rais the dead of this this man not stat Cliffe but it's it was another brother maybe a stat Cliffe and and brother bam says I they contacted him he'll be there and so many hours it was an Army jet plane that would get him from the US over to Germany to raise this child that had died and brother man says I went to the Lord in prayer and the Lord didn't tell him nothing then he went into the woods and prayed he still didn't say nothing then the next day he got up he said his wife went to work 6:00 a.m. in the morning he started praying he said then a sweet voice came to him and said don't rebuke that this is my hand he said it was a sweet voice that told him that so he got on the phone and he told them you know I can't rebuke this this is God this is the hand of God now there's other times he could rebuke it but you see when you're following the lord it's not a direct line like this right here and not everybody gets the same judgment and everybody not everybody understands what you see they'll never see it that's right so why would I argue and fuss with them yes sir and this was the Commandment that that God gave to to Joshua look at this in paragraph 62 it says this here brother the real Church of the Living God has no forms has no Creeds is led by the power of God that's in every individual's heart pass by your brethren don't fuss at them regretter than they don't fuss at them just just go by I want you to notice the great things taking place here there was Esau Moab and those we referred to last night many of those people many of those were actually borderline believers they were right on the border well I got to stop here in just something a moment and he continues on he says this here in paragraph 66 you Lutheran that believe in justification your inheritance don't lay there if you're called if you're just a Lutheran that's all the father you'll ever get you Methodist and Nazarene and Pilgrim Holiness and Church of God uh who believe in sanctification the killing of the evil that's in you taking out the roots of evil you belong across the river but to you men and women that there is something in you calling out the Deep to the Deep there's a Jordan yet to cross and a land Beyond the river amen said you're going to pass by your brethren you're going to pass by your brethren they're near the borderline if you pass by them don't say nothing to them amen I have given Esau this mountain I have given Moab this country I don't want you fussing at them prelighting just move through gently you know where you're going don't take up their habits amen if you know what you believe you don't have to argue with people about what you believe just keep moving walk gently GL hallelujah amen yes sir amen you know people that that believe a certain Doctrine you know it's some insecurity when they're constantly trying to push something on you but if you know what you believe you don't have to push nothing on anybody you have to be afraid of any of the quotes or the scriptures you know what you believe just move gently on that's my brother over there that's my brother over there Moab they got to they're doing their thing said the Lord told me do they said they supposed to handle the word like that they said they supposed to do it like that leave them alone argue with them about what that's right don't fuss with them don't disagree with him just go ahead leave him alone can you look at your neighbor and tell him leave him alone not a very active crowd this morning leave him alone you're messing with him he don't believe he don't see it he don't understand they know who you are they know you Jacob's kids and Esau this Uncle Esau and Moab is Abraham's uhhh lot's grandson we know we know each other we know we're related you ain't going to come over here and get circumcised you ain't going to come over here and do what the word says that's not my business right isn't this beautiful yes sir how many thinks this is beautiful I think this is lovely this takes the pressure off of me trying to make other folks believe like me amen if they was supposed to believe like me God would reveal it to them like he revealed it to you amen can you handle that are you good with that are you okay with that that God is big enough to speak to them if he needs to speak to them you know some of these little conflicts we get into it you don't see it you don't see it and we leave with a bad attitude on one another but we shouldn't have a bad attitude one against one another we just don't see the same way right I'm not called to walk and handle the message that way maybe somebody is I'm not called to handle the Bible that way maybe somebody is but if God called me to handle the Bible the way I handle it then I need to handle it I you God called me to handle the message the way I handle it then that's what I need to do is that right Saints or should would I be following somebody else should you be following somebody else you got to follow where God leads you God places you let me get into this here I got 10 more five more minutes five to seven more minutes all right paragraph 71 I like this don't disagree with him just go ahead leave him alone pay for what you get if you have to pass through his country amen he was predestinated to be that woo if God would would expected or predestinated Moab to join up with Israel they would have joined up amen if he had predestinated Esau to go with Israel Esau would have jumped in and went but he give him his inheritance on the other side of the river so how can you try to make all Lutheran see it all Baptist see it all the Presbyterians and nazarin and Pilgrim Holiness don't condemn them amen that's all they know hallu that's all that's in them but to you who believe Glory I like that oh God to you who know to you that's got something that's calling to the Deep if all the Deep you've got has been satisfied then stay where you are amen but for me in my house for me there's something more than what we've seen there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still a deep calling to the deep I cannot be satisfied with theology I cannot be satisfied with good church I cannot be satisfied with a good campaign I cannot be satisfied with a little healing service there is something beyond that that's calling now brothers and sisters that's what's in my heart when I handle the message there's something that's far deeper than just a message church here in the city something far deeper than that it's something calling to my heart for the great Rapture of the church a power an anointing that's going to make this word live in my life amen there's something greater than this the way we've always done it and we thank God for what we have it's not discrediting what we have but there's a deep calling to my deep to the deep down in my soul and I handled message I I believe that that you know that should be uh manifested in our in our churches today that should be manifested in me today I how many you feel that way you get you hear those you you listen to the message you hear the prayer line go by you see the anointing take place there's something that belongs to us I believe that belongs to us amen there's a power there's an anointing now if you're satisfied with handling the word and the way things are today then stay where you are no criticism no hatred against you no trying to force you into anything but when you know what the word says for the hour you know God is going to have a church amen yes let me close let me close the prophet of God takes um I'm going to take this this this message here it's in the power of transformation and he says this here I got two places I need to get to before I close but the power of transformation paragraph 72 he said the same thing it is about having a church here in the last days look at this paragraph 72 1965 he says this the same thing it is about having a church here in the last days he is going to have a bride he is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham if we don't follow him he'll get somebody else that will follow him see he is going to have it because he has already spoke it whatever he says it has to be that way it cannot change it must come forth that way because he said it would and all this great thing that we've know come to pass after he spoke it he could have take a rest everything under control his seed was his word and his word is a seed Jesus said and everything would be all right because he had said for it to for he had said for it to bring forth of its kind transforming only to its kind see his word had to be of its kind if he said a palm tree he didn't mean palm and an oak mixed together he me a palm tree here and an oak tree here everything positionally in its place oh we can only learn that that what part of the word we are we must take our place no matter what it is I think of this little sister here in the wheelchair sometime how many faithful prayers has been made over it then we don't understand so we just committed to God she's a flower here among you with her pleasantness and everything see that we can get up and go around how she would long to do that but yet she is Pleasant just the way she sits always get inspired to watch the little lady see because we all believe in healing we've seen God do Miracles far beyond that and she knows that too see but she's willing to take her place see whatever it is that's what we want and I believe it was David said I would rather be a doormat at the house of the Lord than to dwell in tents with the wicked you see no matter what it is take my place sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on Earth to you to take your position that God has called you to I'm sure you can read between the lines what I'm saying see sometimes the very dearest person on Earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position in Christ to where God has called you see but what is God doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of God regardless of what the price is see these things don't come it didn't our red our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of God had to die for us see the things of value come of a great price to bring this message it wasn't easy see no it isn't I had to forsake everything that was dear to me even my own people everybody but you see the value of it is you see is to do the will of God and to do that which knowing that there is something in me when they used to say well that was going to put me away thought I lost my mind baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ contrary to the church and all these things they said he is crazy but you see no matter what they said there's something has to be done and God just takes a person sticks him in his hand and say do this and you do it amen so we have to take our position amen and sometimes that's a costly that's a great responsibility it cost a lot for the prophet to take his position to take his stand and stay focused with the original calling remember when he had the to lay the Cornerstone of his church and the vision came to him he saw the vision of those two trees the Trinity and the Oneness he saw that vision of that he was Port that and to plant that and watch those trees grow but never to mix them up but he planted the seed of the word and the angel the word or the the vision told him that to do the work of evangelist for the time will come they'll not endure sound Doctrine but you got to stay with what God has revealed and look at look at the fruit of his ministry today look at the price that was paid in his life and the cost and the sweat and the tears and the misunderstanding he's talking about dearest of friends he had to part with and shake hands with and separate with because of this focus of this Vision so what about you and I what about you and I can we take that attitude of what Jesus told Peter you know sometimes we come to church Church like who's going to be there or who's not there or who's preaching or what time what what is that today amen follow thou me what are the other churches doing all the way they handle this how does that church do this so what's this pastor doing what's this ministry doing what is that to thee follow thou me God makes it very plain and very clear that it's not nice to have Brethren you walk with it's nice to know that there's others that see what you see but what if you had to come to church and no one else was here would you still come what if you were the only one would you still do it what if your entire family that's believing the word what if they all just gradually begin to walk away from the word and you're so caught up with your family and so connected with that then you'd have to have what the problem Prophet had you have to have what Joshua had you have to have what every True Believer has that not everybody is predestinated to walk under the Covenant that you're walking under and you just have to walk under it whether it looks strict whether it looks crazy look like you lost your mind what is that to thee what what's going to happen to John what's that what business is that yours Paul Peter why you want to know what's going on with John follow me Peter follow me I like this final quote here that brother bam talking in his laying of the Cornerstone he says I left the house speaking to brother Cox this is in the message impersonation of Christianity paragraph 31 you was talking about the the the standing in the middle of the road that Canadian Pastor that came over he left discouraged because the American Church they were all Fanatics and they one extreme to the next you got this over there you got the these people pulling from different sides and we got it here today too in different forms they're called doctrines and then we cross one another's path and then there's a cross pollinate and there's a cross influence you come across people that supposed to be walking with the Bible is supposed to be walking with the word you're supposed to be I'm supposed to be walking with the word and we come across all kind of people and then so you see these things happening and you try to place people is he a Believer make believer unbeliever where does he believe the word should I fellowship with should I just kick him out what you know who is she what is you know you got to let that go you got to let that go and stay focused on what God has called you to and if I am going to be responsible to stand in the line of Jesus as a minister I'm supposed to do what Jesus did man that's a great enough example I don't need to be looking at no one else no one else right but he he's telling this story here and he's he's coming down and he says but as I left the house speaking to brother Cox on I rot down he knows nothing of this as he sits here down the road I said Lord how true that is how hard that has been to try to get the true gospel to the people pulling from both sides and trying to hold in the middle of the road as we've contended from that since the hour the Cornerstone was laid see now and some I said what about these Americans down here what will happen to them it seemed like something said just spoke to me and said what are you doing what is this to thee follow thou me and the vision returned to my mind the day that I laid the Cornerstone on return home I was quoting it to my wife how many remembers the vision of the morning the Cornerstone it's laying right in the Cornerstone Now 23 years ago it's so nice how the Lord will remind you of what your Cornerstone is had to remind the prophet remember when you laid the Cornerstone what about these Americans what about these churches these people pulling from both sides and we're in a time right now too we're in a time right now uh Church message people quote unquote message Church we're in a time right now you got you don't know who is who and what is what you don't know what's developing you don't know who aligned with you don't know who's a brother who's a true brother who's a MOAB brother who's a Esau brother who's a total word brother who believes in all brother who's a part you don't know what you don't know who is who and what is what you try to work it out in your mind but I'm so glad that these words remind to my mind follow thou me amen what is that to thee amen I saved you I called you follow me and I like that I want to leave that with you um this morning you know the sayings the rumors doctrines speculative doctrines man's ideas this is what that means that's what that means follow thou me now as I close everybody love the Lord I have three more quotes Okay can I read those to you you won't leave now Will You Huh three more all right and this is going to refocus our mind back to why am I standing up here always quoting from brother brandham why do we stress the the sisters in the back to get it up on the screen for you to read it where is this coming from where is this inspiration coming from why do you know we got good healthy preachers here that can handle the word very nicely why would all the preachers sit down and listen to a tape why would you do that and well I'm going tell you why I do it okay and I and I know it's the reason why you do it but I just want to remind you where the tape Ministry the whole idea of it where it comes from okay now the prophet of God tells us this is in wisdom versus faith 1962 paragraph 31 so I went back in a little place where we've been out a little place called kandik about 40 miles from any civilization one little story uh one little store for the ranchers and things how many knows where Klondike Arizona is that's where sunset Mountain is he's describing this that little place there to tie in what he's saying here about 40 miles any civil a one little store for the ranchers and things that looked like it was at Klondike and it turned out to be this Tabernacle and I was standing right here I was calling in great barrels of the prettiest food I ever seen radishes look like um three foot long turnips greens and potatoes and everything and he said store in plenty of it see and I was standing there just storing it in and I woke up I couldn't understand it I thought it was just a dream and I went on and brother Woods many of them so here was the interpretation I had to wait just like I've told you many times things has to happen before you can certain things that can bring in in line here and he's bringing an interpretation of something else he was talking about so he's talking about this place this little building taking sides with Jesus paragraph 102 he says this here drop down to paragraph 103 to save time he says says you remember what the dream that I got the interpretation was go back and store up food where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have now of course our little brothers here that's along here these are other little churches are us we're one where would you go to find it show its comparison anywhere you go right out in denominational Creeds you go right away from the name of the Lord Jesus you go right away from these other things see and here is where the food has been stored one message that I preached here to you all look I've been preaching for one to six hours you on a message well if I had to use one of those message I take a week to take it just a little bit here a little bit there see because it's been stored up here it's on on tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes where people in their houses them tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of God he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to his course that's the reason he sent me back to do this store up the food here he forbid me to go overseas the sign of the answer sir night paragraph 152 I went back in the vision and there was a little long building then a voice said to me and all you remember this many of you a voice said to me bring in food store it in that's the only way to keep them here is give them food and I brought in had brought in great big barrels full of the prettiest carrots the prettiest vegetables and things I ever seen do you remember now the vision now I told you later what the interpretation was I was supposed to go to Switzerland and brother the augen bright and brother bam goes on so this is the vision that told him to store up this food Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says this here in paragraph four bless our dear Pastor the shepherd we pray that you'll anoint him with the Holy Spirit of the word and reveal to him to them and feed the flock and once just a while ago when he showed the vision the little Tabernacle here about to store up the food that there will come a time when this would all be needed when we seen brother sofman and brother Rood ready to cross over into another country but you said store up this food here for the time lord reverently I've tried to do that brother random continues on the same message dropped down to paragraph number 90 help this morning Lord as we read the word May the Holy Spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to hold them and may you and may and and may as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored here in this Tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that granted Lord or tape load that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead granted father we all have a task that lays ahead and it's going to be it's going to be aligned with this food that's been stored up to us amen how many believe that so that's the reason why we do it we read from it we listen to it we point the people we point you you to it cuz that's where your sustaining strength is and that that Focus has to stay there you get to where you get to where the quotes is too much or the play in the tape you want to hear me preach then you know something ain't right if you want to hear me preach over you know hearing what the word of the Lord is and something ain't right there's a balance there God bless you you want to hear anointed preaching you want to hear a pastor you want to hear a reverend so and so but in the day when your ear is turning away from hearing the voice of the prophet you just know something's wrong because the angel of the Lord the vision told Brother brandom to store up the food on the tapes amen amen amen and when you're listening to the tapes it will tell you if we should have gifts pastors preachers teachers it tells us all of that amen you say well we're just listening to the tapes because we don't want any Pastor if you're listening to the tape it'll tell you who a pastor is and what a pastor is what the gifts are rather run the church all of that is on the tape amen but but the enemy don't want you to even listen to the tape tell you we got two weeks three weeks of tape Services we're going to play tapes here how many of you got something better to do you'll create something you're like we're just playing what tape y'all listening to I'll listen to it myself you know you got to be careful that Spirit don't the carnal Spirit of the age of the hour don't want you to hear this message that's facts those are fact facts the angel of the Lord the voice of the hour the message of the hour is what God sent to us today is that right Saints can I get a witness so we play a tape tonight or Sunday morning or the next night how many you think well ah they just playing a tape wait wait wait just playing the tape of who Alexander scorby Dr James Dobson is Reverend so and so or the prophet of the age you got to check I'm talking about I'm talking
