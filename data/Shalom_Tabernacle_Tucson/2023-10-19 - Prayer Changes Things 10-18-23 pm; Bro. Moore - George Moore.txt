shall we amen hey amen well God bless you tonight and so good to be in the house of the Lord I'm glad to be with you this evening looks like a bunch of eagles gathered here and good to see everybody and just look forward to spending some time in prayer tonight and so maybe while we're all standing we'll just go ahead and get right into the word tonight and uh we can just turning our Bibles to Isaiah the 56th chapter and so good to be here here brother Joe tried to give me a visitors pamphlet when I walked in I've been been gone been gone quite a bit and been sprinkled in on some Wednesday nights but uh it's um this past weekend we were at Landmark on Sunday morning and then we were uh at uh Shalom Phoenix on Sunday night the weekend before that we're in Flagstaff Sunday morning and in Shalom Phoenix on Sunday night the weekend before that I think maybe landmarkers somewhere I'm losing track at this point but um it's certainly good to be back home with you tonight and and we just uh look forward for What the Lord Has for us can you say Amen tonight amen Isaiah the 56th chapter want to greet our stream uh folks that are streaming we greet our Saints in Phoenix there my friends there and and also if um brother Israel gets a chance to stream or listen in on the service I'm sure he'll maybe have a chance hopefully sometime we want to greet him uh in the name of the Lord tonight too and we just trust that God is using him and sister Sharon in a mighty way and that uh I know wherever he's at whoever he's preaching to he's going to do him good because he's done me good all these years and so I have confidence that the Lord is is using Brother Israel and just uh I just hope that the Lord just continues to bless them and and uh we look forward to hearing the the testimonies that come out of this Isaiah 56 and the 4th verse Isaiah 56:4 for thus sayith the Lord unto the unic that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my Covenant even unto them will I give in mine house and with my walls a place and a name better than the sons and of then of sons and of daughters and I will give them an everlasting name name that shall not be cut off also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord that's that's the Gentiles to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it and take hold of my Covenant even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer everybody say Joyful Joyful In My House of Prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my Altar for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people let's just bow our heads heavenly father it's a privilege to be in the house of the Lord tonight Lord and may we be joyful to be here Lord Lord God no matter what what we've had to go through today no matter the trials that today have held no matter what's going on at work or at school or at home no matter what Lord may we be joyful to come to the house of the Lord the house of prayer and Lord we just ask oh God that you would speak to us tonight Lord break to us the bread of life bless your children we pray and Lord I ask you to watch over me and Lord bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing pleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen and amen God bless you you may be seated and go ahead and turn in your Bibles to James the 5th chapter for another little reading and I want to touch on the topic tonight of Prayer Changes Things Prayer Changes Things and if you want a good search sometime you can search in the message Prayer Changes Things and you'll find uh nice uh a nice selection of quotes that that brother brandham talks about how that that Prayer Changes Things in our lives and so I think tonight as we're entering into this prayer meeting hopefully we can uh read some quotes and some scriptures that will bless you and will help you and and have confidence that that when we go to the Lord in prayer it's not in vain but but Prayer Changes Things Saints do y'all believe Prayer Changes Things tonight amen that's what the prophet of God taught us and and so James the 5th chapter and the 13th verse says this is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any marry let him sing songs is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he has committed sins they shall be forgiven him that's a lot of power in that prayer isn't it confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed now I love this Saints it says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and he says Elias was a man subject subject to like passion as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit isn't that a beautiful scripture reading tonight Saints and and so I'll tell you it's a it's shocking to me I think we probably all have have gotten to the point to where we say my prayer life is not what it should be I don't pray in the manner that I should pray now I realize that in our lives we have es and flows and you might have times where where your prayer life is better than others and and you might have Hills and Valleys in your prayer life but at one time or another if it's not right now you know what I'm talking about that we say I'm just not praying like I should be praying can you say Amen tonight to that and the majority of the Christians in the world today I would say this is a major struggle for them to be able to spend enough time in prayer can you say Amen to that and and probably one of the most neglected parts that we see in the Christian walk is prayer life and and it's the desire to pray and the need to pray and and you find brothers and sisters that that it's it's absolutely the only thing that's going to do any good is to spend that time in prayer is that right and and it's and it's absolutely free to us it don't it don't cost nothing it's not it's not difficult for us to do it's it's absolutely free and it's the only thing that does any good and it's the one thing the devil fights so hard to keep us from doing see see everybody gets to the point to where we're so busy in this day and time with different things to keep us distracted and overwhelmed and we're just busy with work and with home life and with entertainment and with commit ments and different things that would stop us from being able to concentrate on our prayer life can you say Amen tonight Saints and and we find it happens to all of us and and it doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing it can actually be something involved in the church when you know we get busy with the church and we get busy uh uh coming up on these meetings and so forth and all the Prep Prep work that goes into that and planning and and those type things we can easily get so busy with this church function that we forget the the main thing that's going to make these meetings successful and that's to spend time in prayer for those meetings amen and brother brandom says and why are people so tossed about he said the Bible said the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now that word aileth means to exercise force or to Prevail and he said the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much see Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it would rain and it didn't rain for three years and six months and then he went and prayed earnestly again and the heavens give rain now brother Brown says prayer changes things he says it can't change it I can't change it he said you can't change it it's prayer that changes it is that what the prophet said nothing I can do about it nothing you can do about it but there is something prayer can do about it amen amen so so I think it's striking that that it's not you and it's not I but there's something about prayer that that changes things now I don't want to get ahead of myself but but we'll find that prayer is actually an action of the Holy Spirit working in our life it's not prayer is not something we do it's something that the Holy Spirit does through us do you believe that tonight and and prayer is the only thing we find that you can't do too much of you you can eat too much and and and you can sleep too much and you can work too much amen you can you can you can preach too much even I can I after about 45 minutes it gets to where it's too much preaching ain't it and so you find that you can do anything too much but pray and you can't pray too much now brother Bram said in the healing of D gas's daughter he said and if Jesus had to spend much down this is a real familiar quote to us Saints but but but even the familiar ones we got to keep on reading them amen and he said and if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was with him in him how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer so Jesus had to stay in prayer to stay in contact with the spirit that was within him and he said what about me and you amen and I Think Jesus set the example to us and he says if you only knew what time in prayer meant and see it said what sometimes when you're in prayer God changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen so so brother brandham says that that there could be something that was going to happen and your prayers could change what's going to happen or could change the outcome of a situation that's how critical our time in prayer is do y'all believe this tonight and he said he said it changes things that was going to happen he said do you believe that he said might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation well you say if God knows it's going to happen what would my prayer do you remember when he stood there looking out upon the Harvest and he said he was the lord of the Harvest and he said the Harvest is ripe and the laborers are but few pray ye that the to the lord of the Harvest that he will send laborers into the Harvest in other words pray to me that I will send laborers into the Harvest which I'm just telling you is such a needy thing but part of it lays but part of it lays in human beings so brother Bram said that Jesus stood there talking to the disciples and he recognized the need for Laborers in the Harvest and he instructed the disciples to pray to the Lord of the Harvest that they would send laborers and he was the lord of the Harvest you see Jesus was guiding their prayer Jesus was guiding their prayer to what was at need at that time do you believe that tonight Jesus was guiding their prayer and he was the lord of the Harvest and he could have simply sent laborers into the Harvest but God chooses to work through man tonight he chooses to work through you and I tonight and he can't just do it all for us there's something we got to do in this Saints and he said pray that I'll send laborers and he said the kingdom of God he said but part of it lays in human beings see Saints you and I are you are are are elements for the use of God tonight we we the our hands are his hands our our mouth is his mouth or our our tongue or our our bodies are his body we may be the only Jesus that some people will ever see and he uses men tonight he uses women tonight do you believe it and he said pray that I'll send labors into the Harvest he said part of it lays in human beings do you believe that the kingdom of God lays within the human being now Jesus said in one place I am the vine ye are the branches the vine can't bear fruit the branches in the vine bears fruit so so brother so Jesus can't bear fruit that's up to you and I to do and he says God cannot bear fruit of his it's got to take the church is that right now he could do it however he wanted to do it Saints but he chose to to do it through you and I amen he he doesn't have to have us but he chose to have us he didn't have to do it this way but this is the way he chose and it's our job amen amen and that's the way he chose it he says he's got to take your branches to bear fruit and when you branches are are yielded to the vine when you branches are yielded to the vine then fruit comes forth see what I mean God wants your hands he wants your eyes he wants your tongue he wants your lips he wants your ears he wants your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through you see Saints he is counting on your prayers tonight he's counting on you to lift up something in prayer tonight amen so he was the lord of the Harvest and he saw the need that was in the world but he asked his follow to pray for the to the lord of the Harvest which he was because he has chosen to use you and I tonight he chose you and I to be his members so Jesus essentially guides the prayers of the Believers am amen he guides the prayers to the of the Believers now we'll talk about that more here in just a little bit but that's why we must be as brother brandham said yielded to the Vine because if we're yielded to the vine then he can guide our prayers all right now just to help build your faith a little bit when you pray I I want to tell you that we must realize that when we pray God always answers not part of the time not some of the time but God always answers when we pray now here you him brother Bram says get the fear away don't be scared that God's not going to answer prayer God always answers prayer The Works already finished he's obligated he must do it he's got to do it to keep his word notice it's a finished work so no matter what the answer is Saints we got to have confidence that the answer is just righten the answer is just what it's supposed to be now Romans 8:28 I love this verse it's one it's one of my favorite verses in the Bible and somebody at the youth service had this as their favorite verse who was that y'all you remember who that somebody had this 828 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God do you love God tonight then all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose how can you go wrong with a promise like that Saints how can you go wrong when you got that much confidence how can you go wrong when no matter what comes your way no matter what happens it's all working for your good what a blessed people that the worst day you ever had was for your good the hardest time you ever had was for your good amen the worst meal you ever cooked was for your good is that right all things work together for good of them that love God and are called according to his purpose we can't go wrong with a promise like that Saints All Things the good things the bad things the tough things the easy things the happy things the sad things all things work together for good amen so if the Lord gives us exactly what we prayed about and exactly what we were asking for then that's for our good but if he doesn't give us exactly what we ask for then that was for our good also or if he tells us he we can have it but we got to wait just a little bit that's for our good also all things work together for good of those that love God and are called according to his purpose and I believe God has called a bride out of the into this message tonight do y'all believe that and I'm believe we're the called of God and I believe all things are working together for our good amen now here's the part that blows my mind he's such a good God that he actually makes intercessions for our prayers now intercession means the act of intervening on behalf of another now the Bible said he makes intercession for our prayers he acts on behalf of our prayers now Romans 8:26 says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought amen sometimes we don't know the right thing to pray for do we sometimes we don't know if we should pray for this or pray for that what we should pray for well the Bible said that that he know that we know not what we should pray as we ought but the spirit itself makes intercessions for us with groanings which cannot be uttered amen amen so he that searches the hearts knows what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God see he knows what his will is we may not know but he knows and he makes intercessions for our prayers according to his will amen that's miraculous SES now let me read it to you in a different translation the ESV version y'all don't y'all don't throw Rotten Tomatoes at me it's all right likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with Gro too deep for words and he who searches Hearts knows what is in the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the Saints according to the will of God let me just say it like this even your prayers are controlled by the Lord Jesus amen amen if you're yielded to the vine even your prayers are in the hands of the the Lord Jesus is that what the Bible said now you remember how he guided the disciples prayer and he said there's a need for Laborers in the Harvest now you pray that the lord of the Harvest will send laborers is that right Saints just like he did it when he was here on Earth he does it now by the Holy Spirit and he says pray for this pray for this pray for this he guides the prayers of the Believers because that's the way he's chosen to do it that's good amen if the spirit of Christ is in our heart it causes us to cry ABA father amen now Abba actually means father so it actually means that we should cry father father amen and this desire he said to commune with the father you can't can't put it in words he said we don't know how to say it like we ought to he says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father all right and you just can't put it into words you can't describe how you feel about the Lord in so many words there's just no way to describe what he means to you what what he what he's done for you you can't put in words there there's not a word in a language that you can use to describe everything that God means to you is that right Saints but the spirit knows what's in the heart the Bible said the spirit knows what your heart means and it makes intercession for that so isn't that and not only that the spirit also knows if you're close to the vine if you're attached to the vine and if your heart is right towards God God then the spirit knows that at the end of the day you would rather have God's will than your will is that your prayer today thy will be done thy kingdom come on Earth as it is in heaven I might pray for something Saints but at the end of the day I'd rather have it be God's will than to be my will I'd rather have his will in my life than my own will now I'll pray for what I think is right but I but God know knows my heart that I really want his perfect will amen so our desire to commune with the father can't be put into words and and we find that it's not our will but it's his that has to be done I think of it like this it's like all of us dumb guys that's trying to find a way to tell our sweetheart how much we care about him now if I try to do it it ain't gonna make no sense come on somebody y'all don't leave me hanging up here if I try to tell my wife exactly how I feel about it I can't put it into words correctly I guess y'all are all good at that you good at that Caleb all right some of y'all might be good at telling your wife how you feel but as for me I'm not the best at it all right but she knows my heart because we have a relationship together and she knows what I'm trying to say whether I can get it out or not all right she's able to read between the lines see it's impossible for us to pray correctly if our hearts aren't right towards God see we can't fake anything with God you can pull the wool over anybody else's eyes but you can't fake it with God he knows what you are he knows what you aren't he knows the ins he knows the outs and he knows all about it and you can't you might look like one thing in front of everybody else but he knows what you really are and he knows if your heart's right towards him or not that's why the Bible said if our hearts condemn us not is that right 1 John 3:19 says hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us then God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things see it's a good thing if your heart is being condemned about something that's a good thing that means god is dealing with you and you know what you need to make right you know what you need to pray for you know what you need to do you know what's got to be corrected to make your heart right it's a good thing to have condemnation amen it's it's I I I want to be corrected do you want to be corrected Saints I want to be right towards God I I don't want to be wrong I I want to be right and I like to have my it don't feel good but I'd rather get it out of the way I'd rather not have anything between me and him amen and he says God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things says beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do things that are pleasing in his sight is that right Saints so if we get oursel right and our heart is right and we're walking in the way and we're living the right kind of life and we keep the Commandments of the Lord and our heart is right towards God we can have confidence that our prayers are being answered right amen now there is certainly such a thing as a sinner's prayer but it don't need to stay a sinner's prayer we need to have a sinner's prayer for a sinner but then once there a Saint they need to move on up amen so we got to make right what needs to be made right so that we can have a clear conscience towards God and and and that's whatever God shows us that we need to make right whatever God reveals to our hearts that's holding us up amen is this all right tonight Saints so whatever is holding us up whatever is keeping us from having a clear conscience toward God that so we can go boldly to the throne of God in prayer and have confidence that he hears and answers our prayer all right right so I'll tell you Saints one of the things that's the hardest to do here is that we got to stay alone with God long enough for him to place on our hearts the things that he wants us to ask him for that takes a minute it takes some time it it takes I I had a a good a friend of M he said brother George one of my one of my uh the songs that I couldn't I didn't like the most growing up with Sweet Hour of Prayer he said number one the song just goes on and on and on and on he said but then number two he said I can't imagine praying for an hour right now at least he was being honest all right he said what would you pray for well you know what if you get down there with a wish list of everything that you want to tell God that you need you're going to be out you're going to be through your list pretty fast but if you get down on your knees to commune with God and to and to hear from God of the things that that he places on your heart to pray for it can take hours amen all right so brother Bram says this as I thought on my wayist that some of us go other paths in this neurotic age that we're living so many people turn to the p psychiatrist to Christians go to the psychiatrist and psychiatrist has got to go to a psychiatrist he said turn your path to God he's the Healer and if our hearts condemn us not then we have this assurance that God answers prayer amen letting off the pressure he said just another testimony uh to the glory of God he said to know that he answers prayer when the hearts are sincere and want to believe on him he answers prayer when the hearts are sincere and want to believe on him there's nothing too great for him to do let me read that again there's nothing that's right too great for him to do and I believe that he just loves to do that for his people so brother Brown said there's number one there's nothing too great there's nothing off limits amen there's nothing that God can't take care of there's no problem we got that's too big there's no problem we got that's too small there's nothing that that God can't handle in our life nothing that he can't do nothing he can't handle He's Got No Limits he's omnipotent and he's omnipresent and he's more than able to handle anything but not only that number two brother Bram said he loves to do it so we're not asking God to do something that he don't want to do we're asking God to do something that he loves to do amen he loves to do it he loves to answer the prayers of the Saints he loves to do that for his children he loves to do that for his people amen so stay right with it stay with it now brother Bram talked about amram now everybody knows am and yabel in the Bible and he said he prayed and he prayed and he prayed for the children of Israel in bondage and he and he kept praying and he kept praying and it kept getting worse and it kept getting worse and it kept getting worse and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed some more and and and he kept on praying Saints what else could he do what other options did he have amen what else can we do tonight I can't do nothing about what's going on in Israel but I can pray I can't do anything about what's going on out here on the street but I can pray I can't do anything about all the evils and and the Ws of the devil in this world but I can pray amen I can't do anything about others people's walk with the Lord but I can pray amen and he couldn't do anything else he couldn't deliver his people he couldn't ease his people's burdens but he could pray and brother Bram said lifting him up out of History he said one night when Abraham had prayed maybe for several hours and his hair now was turning gray he been praying so long Saints he been praying since he was a young man and his hair was turning gray no Deliverance but just getting worse amen sometimes when you pray it seems like things are getting worse amen one night he got right down to business that's how we have to do it get right down to business he said God you promised this and we've looked forward to it and we see the signs all here and the time is at hand it's time for you to do something about it and while he was deep concentrated prayer while he was in deep concentrated prayer praying with all his heart he looked standing in a corner he rubbed his eyes and looked again and there stood an angel with a sword drawn and he said Deliverance is coming and you're going to bring a son into the world and he's going to be the one to deliver them see God always answers prayer doesn't he if we just hold on brother BRS Prayer Changes Things Prayer Changes Things it changes the outcome it changes the circumstance it changes the the the whole the whole outlook of the situation does complaining change anything does worry change anything do does does gossip change anything does anger change anything does self-doubt change anything does emotion change anything but prayer does change things amen so if none of those other things work why don't we spend so much time en thr enth thralled in them why do we spend so much much time messing with things that don't work and not enough time in the things that do work amen many times it seems like our prayer is is the last resort after we've done everything we can do to try to make it work ourself after we've tried all we can try and done all we can do then we pray amen amen so let's do the one thing that's guaranteed to work amen amen The Works that I do bear witness of me brother Brown says and if you ever want to do anything for me that'll please me you pray for me that's the one thing I want you to do is pray for me CU I know Prayer Changes Things it even changes God's mind about things changes God's program do you believe that he says God can pronounce a certain thing it's going to be just that way and prayer will change his mind about it it has been done amen so we fight and we pull and we strain when the most powerful tool in the Arsenal is left in the sheath many times amen y'all believe that tonight amen let's goad we'll just have the musicians come just a few words tonight 37 M 38 minutes brother isra will be proud of me I was thinking about this while I was putting this message together today and I'm not a poet and I I can't spell good enough for spell check to even know what I'm trying to say that's pretty bad brother will if spell check can't figure out what you're trying to say but every once in a while every five years or so the Lord will the Lord will lay uh maybe they that wait upon the Lord sis we if youall know that song every once in a while the Lord will give me a little something and I'll write it down and I was thinking one day about brother brandom talked about that eagle and he said when he began to get old and weary he said he gets a crust over his head y'all heard the story and he says he gets so weary that he don't know what to do and and the Bible said that the eagle renews his youth so he said I studied about this fell when he gets old and weary and that crust all over his head he says he flies just as high as he can go and he finds a great High Rock and he sits down by the side of this rock and he sits there and he beats his head on this rock and he said what's he trying to do he's trying to beat the crust off oh the crust off he says and he said the blood will fly out of his head and it goes through all kinds of torture but as long as he can feel some of that crust on him he he's got to get that off so he beats it on the Rock and he just keep beating until the crust is off his head and he says as soon as the crust is off his head though he's bleeding and wounded he just screams to the top of his voice and he lets off the pressure because as soon as all that crust is off then he renews his youth he says it's sure to come so as soon as the crust is gone he can start screaming because he knows he's got rid of all that crust he said so his youth is sure to be renewed so he can just let off the pleasure start screaming because he's going back to a young Eagle again that's wonderful he says I'm glad for the eagle I'm glad for that bird and I was thinking about that one day I was thinking about this story and the lord gave me these words and I'll and again I'm not a poet but I want to read this it's all right if I share this with you tonight and it was just a few words that the lord gave me to write down and I I pray it's a blessing to you because I tell you Saints this was after I come up out of a great trial in my life have you ever been in a great trial and right after I come up out of the great trial that was in my life I was at that point to where I was tired from fighting a battle but I felt better because I knew I was going to make it you know what I mean Saints I I knew I was going to make it and so I wrote these words down hope it's a blessing to you the eagle worn and battered stood beaten and alone his feathers loosed and ruffled his blood upon a stone the years had taken from him more than their fair share he looked a sight of pity a film upon his stare tired and weary in his flesh the trials had mounted High but something called within him his eyes looked toward the sky the choice had been made for him by birth he could not fail the anchor held within his heart behind the inner Veil not satisfied with where he was ashamed of how he looked he gathered strength for one more try and to the sky he took High into the heaven far from the world below a still Small Voice was calling back to the Rock I'll go on this rock I'll plant my feet up Way Beyond the sky I'll beat myself upon the stone until I clear my eyes the crust was thick upon them from age or storm or Foe but still the voice was calling you don't belong below an eagle from the beginning greater than other birds predestinated to Glory because the voice he heard painful is the process that it takes to be renewed but joyful is the victory as light comes shining through one by one the scales fell off as the eagle Wars and stries the blood upon the Mountaintop revealed the hidden prize his sight refreshed his Focus sharp his strength began to grow his burdens seemed much lighter as his feathers start to Glow through the scattered mountain tops of scream came forth with praise the sign of Resurrection the renewing of his days the victory came calling because of Royal birth and though he had some troubles he was greater than the earth oh praise the god of Heaven who gives and takes away for by the Lord's provided way the night is turned to day amen can we bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord as we take these requests tonight as we go to you in prayer tonight Lord I pray that each one will renew their strength Lord I pray that Lord as the trials no doubt we've all got them and we've all fought them and we may be fighting them right yet tonight but Lord God you have a way that we can renew ours s you have a a way that we can renew our strength
