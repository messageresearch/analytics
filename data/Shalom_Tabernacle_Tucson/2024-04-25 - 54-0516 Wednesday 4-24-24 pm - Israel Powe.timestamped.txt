[38:01] what was he a man of sorrow acquainted
[38:03] with
[38:05] dream is that what he was he walked
[38:08] about among men dressed like other men
[38:11] he wouldn't know him from no one else
[38:13] but he could stand look up on the
[38:14] congregation and know what they were
[38:16] thinking
[38:17] about when he spoke it was words that
[38:20] you knew that it was coming from a true
[38:22] heart that really knew what he was
[38:24] talking about amen while the soldiers
[38:26] that come to see went
[38:27] said never a man spoke like this would
[38:31] you like to be like that or your words
[38:33] were so seized and they just took a hold
[38:35] to the people's hearts and grip them
[38:37] like that now you can be like him just
[38:39] get him in here is that right he'll make
[38:42] you humble and when someone smites you
[38:45] on one side face you say God like
[38:48] you I know you don't mean it when they
[38:50] pierce his hands and his Sid so forth he
[38:53] saids father forgive them they don't
[38:55] know what they're doing that was it
[38:57] forgiving humble Spirits that's the way
[38:59] we ought to
[39:00] be that's the way we got to
[39:05] be we ever make the Rapture now when you
[39:08] get like that I can say you're coming
[39:10] nine to the Holy
[39:12] Spirit Hebrews a great famous letter
[39:16] written by St Paul I believe what is the
[39:19] book of
[39:20] Hebrews now the letter of the Hebrews
[39:24] was
[39:25] Paul speaking to the the Hebrew Church
[39:29] separating law From Grace in The Book of
[39:34] Hebrews he was telling the Hebrew
[39:37] convert how that they want to continue
[39:40] on in the law and he told them what law
[39:44] was the grace let's read now this book
[39:47] was written in about um uh
[39:51] 80 uh 94 somewhere now far the law
[39:56] having
[39:58] being are having a Shad of good things
[40:02] to
[40:05] come the first Fe first phase of the
[40:08] first verse of the 10th chapter of
[40:10] Hebrews the law having a
[40:16] shadow of the good things to
[40:18] come now remember Abraham of course
[40:22] Abraham didn't live under the law
[40:24] Abraham lived under
[40:25] green how many know that
[40:28] as long for the law was given but Moses
[40:32] lived under the
[40:33] law David all those Liv under the law
[40:37] and all that the law provided was a
[40:41] shadow of the good things to come isn't
[40:45] that marvelous just being a shadow you
[40:48] remember one night last week we was
[40:51] teaching on Revelations 12 word of woman
[40:55] let's read it right quick turn for
[40:57] Revelations 12 and let's get it I think
[41:00] that's a beautiful background for this
[41:02] here to is sh and they appeared a great
[41:05] Wonder in heaven a woman what does a
[41:10] woman mean in the Bible Church a woman
[41:13] clo with the sun and the moon under her
[41:20] feet a woman a church cold with a bright
[41:25] light had raised and
[41:27] or lesser light was fading
[41:31] away see now the Moon is a shadow of the
[41:37] sun is that right see the the moon I've
[41:42] seen the moon through those great
[41:43] glasses out there I used mother used
[41:45] tell us about the Man in the Moon you've
[41:47] heard that you know what that is I
[41:49] looked at it two great powerful grasses
[41:51] it's Mountains and the Sunshine and Mak
[41:53] a shadow great crator nothing to grow on
[41:56] the moon
[41:57] it's just so hot in daytime it's my and
[42:00] at night time it's so many times below
[42:03] zero nothing could live and you can sit
[42:06] in that glass as if and stand out here a
[42:09] half a mile from you you see 120 million
[42:12] years of life space through that glass
[42:15] 120 million years how many miles would
[42:18] that be oh my now and the moon and when
[42:22] the sun has gone down the moon shines
[42:27] oh uh you call me the half hour anyhow
[42:30] but look I just see something moving
[42:33] look in the creation all things Heights
[42:37] and patterns sometime I get to preaching
[42:40] there have a few nights of this I just
[42:42] feel like I could just move on and on
[42:44] and on see just to see it I begin to
[42:46] jump up in front of you you know on the
[42:48] Holy Spirit bring and hang it up there
[42:49] for you see all the things of Shadows
[42:52] and types when God made the heavens and
[42:55] the Earth he made the the moon to shine
[42:59] in the absence of the sun to give light
[43:03] while the sun was
[43:05] gone see a beautiful type of Christ and
[43:09] the
[43:10] church the church is the Moon to give
[43:13] the light to the world while the sun is
[43:17] gone see what I mean a lesser
[43:21] light amen and then otherwise the moon
[43:25] and the sun is H husband and
[43:28] wife as Christ and the church is husband
[43:32] and wife the wife being the weaker
[43:35] vessel only gives a smaller light in the
[43:37] absence of her husband and the church
[43:40] can only make manifestations of the Holy
[43:42] Spirit and remember the moon cannot give
[43:46] any light of her
[43:48] own and when you see the Moonlight it's
[43:51] not the Moonlight it's a reflection of
[43:54] the
[43:54] sunlight and Christ the SE end it up is
[43:58] that right and shines his light on the
[44:01] church to reflect his light and power to
[44:03] the world in his ADD
[44:05] amen do you what I mean Genesis in the
[44:10] beginning
[44:12] now he sees the woman standing you look
[44:14] at her she's the woman you'll seen a few
[44:17] moments she's the Jewish Orthodox
[44:20] Church the wife of
[44:23] God the
[44:25] begotten and no is sent not to begotten
[44:28] she begotten of God sure but she's the
[44:31] wife and God had to put her away
[44:34] sometimes back there on account of
[44:37] spiritual fornications is that right and
[44:41] then he returned again and received her
[44:43] again and married her and said he was
[44:45] married to a back Rider is that right
[44:48] the wife that had gone away from him now
[44:52] what a beautiful picture this is to see
[44:55] this woman standing there
[44:57] and the moon under her feet and the sun
[45:00] shining at her head let's look at her
[45:02] just a moment now and see what she looks
[45:05] like and her feet and upon her
[45:08] head and upon her head a crown of 12
[45:14] stars now what the stars do stars giv
[45:18] lesser light is that right well what
[45:21] does a star Shine from if I could walk
[45:24] out tonight and see that great bright
[45:27] star Little Star you sure are a
[45:30] beautiful thing what makes you shine
[45:32] like that well he to talk you say
[45:34] brother Bron I'm not shining well what's
[45:37] making you shine it's something shining
[45:39] on me see if the sun shining on me
[45:43] brother B I just help right up the path
[45:44] for you or then the true Pastor the pit
[45:48] if he's anointed of God it's not the
[45:50] pastor shining it's not him a good
[45:52] preacher it's not him a good pastor it's
[45:54] the Holy Spirit shining on him giving
[45:56] the gospel on amen amen you what I me
[46:00] just beautiful how it's all TI down now
[46:04] the woman had the moon under her feet
[46:07] the sun of her head and 12 stars in her
[46:11] crown the 12
[46:13] apostles this Bible is built upon the
[46:17] doctrine of the Apostles and Christ the
[46:21] Chief Cornerstone amen that right the
[46:23] foundation of the Apostles now you see
[46:26] that woman this to begin with don't see
[46:29] 12 stars all right and see being with
[46:33] child trailing in birth came to be
[46:37] delivered now there's the Jewish
[46:40] Orthodox Church as the law is fading out
[46:46] the gospel is coming in and just as it's
[46:49] fading there's got to be a new
[46:51] dispensation so the woman is with
[46:55] child and she's in pain pain and travel
[46:59] pain being
[47:01] prevailing and child birth in other
[47:04] words the Roman Empire had her hover
[47:06] down just crying oh Messiah come oh
[47:10] Messiah
[47:11] come Messiah come here we see her again
[47:15] over here now as she's travailing
[47:18] bringing forth newborn babes in Christ
[47:20] Jesus coming come Lord Jesus come Lord
[47:23] Jesus amen and the prevailing in birth
[47:26] there pains to be delivered now watch
[47:29] what she did and that now he stops the
[47:32] rider does now he sees another scene
[47:35] comes on now watch the woman here ready
[47:37] to be delivered now the first thing the
[47:40] law was fading out that dispensation of
[47:42] them candles stick we had the other
[47:44] night distance from Satan coming in that
[47:46] was the law being a shadow of the good
[47:50] things to come amen just the shadow wish
[47:54] we had time to go into all the
[47:55] priesthood and show how everything in
[47:57] there shattered this dispensation here
[48:00] how everything happened back there was a
[48:02] shatter of it just the same as the sun
[48:05] is that's the reason people say I was a
[48:08] typologist I have to be I have any
[48:10] education so I have to look in the Bible
[48:12] I see back there what they was I know
[48:14] this about what this is going to be see
[48:17] I look back there and see if I see the
[48:19] moon shining I know it's a little light
[48:22] It's a Wonderful light but there's a
[48:24] greater light somewhere I know what the
[48:25] sun's going to look like when I see the
[48:28] moon
[48:30] amen I see what the sun's going to look
[48:32] like if I've never seen it if I see the
[48:34] moon and it's the shadow of the son I
[48:36] know what the sun's going to look like
[48:37] when it appears see what I mean now this
[48:42] woman was travailing she was sort of
[48:44] bringing forth a child and she was
[48:47] standing there the sun rising at her
[48:49] head the moon going under her feet the
[48:51] done passed away see she's done live
[48:53] through the dispensation of law all
[48:55] speaking see
[48:57] having the shadow of good things to come
[49:00] see just the Shadow the sun was the
[49:02] perfect now and the both can't shine the
[49:05] same time the law could hang but it
[49:09] won't shine because the gospel out Shin
[49:11] to see that's right the moon can hang
[49:14] here 12:00 to day you'll have to look
[49:16] very close to see it that's right
[49:18] because the sun's so much brighter till
[49:21] just out kind amen it may be still
[49:24] hanging there to show that it was last
[49:27] night but it's it's light's done gone
[49:30] that's the law the Law's light has done
[49:32] gone and live that's right now it's a
[49:34] gospel of dispensation of grace and the
[49:37] power of the Holy Ghost the resurrection
[49:39] of Jesus Christ manifest itself in a
[49:41] greater
[49:42] life I's look at this woman again just
[49:45] now and there appeared another wandering
[49:47] heaven and behold a great Dragon great
[49:51] red dragon having seven heads and 10
[49:53] horns and seven crowns upon his head be
[49:55] taken that to the night look and his
[49:58] tail drew a third part of the stars of
[50:00] heaven and did cast them into the Earth
[50:02] you know what that was I tale wasn't
[50:05] like a for taale like you say the
[50:07] devil's God it was that pale that lie
[50:10] that he
[50:11] told and the Very Jews by the Roman
[50:15] Empire crucified the Lord Jesus and over
[50:17] two-thirds of the Jews denied Jesus Tri
[50:21] the Stars which was in heaven and watch
[50:23] what he did and he cast them to the
[50:25] earth and the Dragon stood before the
[50:28] woman which was ready to be delivered to
[50:31] devour her child as soon as it was
[50:33] born now you say the dragon had
[50:36] something to do with the Jews certainly
[50:38] they said this Jesus says he's a king we
[50:40] have no King but Caesar that right see
[50:44] the devil preparing them Jewish Hearts
[50:46] back there to deny Jesus Christ when he
[50:48] comes can you see the devil denying
[50:51] Hearts today to deny the power of the
[50:53] Holy Ghost when he come amen just
[50:56] exactly
[50:57] the same yet honest and sincere but if
[51:00] they're deeply seek after God like some
[51:03] of them jeed did they will God out
[51:05] received him anyhow that's right they
[51:07] didn't care what the church said but it
[51:09] cast twoth thirds of them to the ground
[51:11] and the dragon stood before the woman to
[51:13] devour her child as soon as it was born
[51:15] now who stood what government what power
[51:18] uh stood before uh the woman the Jewish
[51:23] Orthodox Church to devour Jesus Christ
[51:25] when he was born Rome so the red dragon
[51:28] was Rome so you see where the beast
[51:30] that's to come out of Rome all right now
[51:33] watch and she brought forth a man child
[51:37] that was Jesus who was to rule all
[51:39] nations with the rod of arms what did
[51:41] the prophets all say Jesus to do when he
[51:43] come rule the nations with a rod of arm
[51:46] is that right they fail to see first
[51:49] coming to the Gentiles when he returns
[51:51] then he does rule All Nations amen he
[51:54] will come he is up on his throne now
[51:56] he's sitting on God's Throne amen he

[52:16] see the great king of kings setall there
[52:19] he is he's sitting on his father's
[52:22] throne in other words he's sitting in
[52:24] God's power in spirit now
[52:27] but when he comes back he'll set in an
[52:28] Earthly body Hallelujah on David's
[52:32] Throne now he's setting in the Majesty
[52:35] of father now when we say father it's

[59:01] scripture look when the AR enemy met
[59:04] Jesus Christ when he first met him he
[59:07] didn't go with him just roundabout way
[59:09] he met Jesus out there and he said now
[59:11] where's his reach his spot it's his

[1:04:03] existence he fixed his order as it was
[1:04:05] on Easter morning with beautiful flowers

[1:04:43] come to us the same old devil amen when
[1:04:48] God looked down he said there's nothing
[1:04:50] in
[1:04:51] it right and here come able ragged
[1:04:54] pulling a little lamp behind him with a
[1:04:56] great Vine wrapped around his neck laid
[1:04:58] him up on the Altar and talk the L begin
[1:04:59] to chop him back up and the blood begin
[1:05:01] to fly and the lamb blatantly crying God
[1:05:04] said that's it able amen that's it able
[1:05:09] to the shedding of the blood
[1:05:11] cleansing
[1:05:14] amen I feel like a Holy Roller this
[1:05:17] morning I really
[1:05:18] do notice back to Hebrews right quick
[1:05:22] the law having a shadow of good things
[1:05:25] to come
[1:05:26] and not the very but and not the very
[1:05:29] image of the things not the see just the
[1:05:33] shadow of it not the very image of the
[1:05:38] things can
[1:05:40] never see not the very image of the same
[1:05:43] can never with those
[1:05:46] sacrifices they offered year by year
[1:05:49] continually make a make the come there
[1:05:52] to
[1:05:54] perfect now the Lord all having a shadow
[1:05:56] of the good things to
[1:05:58] come can never make the comer
[1:06:02] perfect now did the bible say that if
[1:06:05] that if the law could not make perfect
[1:06:08] then the Bible speaks that there can be
[1:06:10] a Perfection amen amen do you believe
[1:06:13] there is a Perfection amen let's turn to
[1:06:17] St Matthew the the 5th chapter I believe
[1:06:19] in a 40 and about the 48th verse and see
[1:06:23] if we can find that I believe that's
[1:06:24] about right if I take Matthew so I can
[1:06:27] read for you the 5 and 48 yes that's it
[1:06:29] just exactly Jesus speaking in the
[1:06:31] beatitude be therefore
[1:06:35] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:06:37] heaven is perfect how you going to do
[1:06:40] it be perfect as your father in and
[1:06:45] those sacrifices under the law could not
[1:06:47] make the comer
[1:06:49] perfect why now watch this a little
[1:06:51] while for then would not they had not
[1:06:53] have ceased if they make the perfect
[1:06:56] then did not have ceas kept on with the
[1:06:58] law see because that's the
[1:07:02] worshiper my did you read this look at
[1:07:07] here for the
[1:07:09] worshipper the
[1:07:11] Ley the
[1:07:13] worshipper
[1:07:15] once
[1:07:18] heard should have no more conscience of
[1:07:24] sin what's happened to you out there
[1:07:28] then what are you carrying on fussing
[1:07:30] with your neighbor
[1:07:32] about the Bible said the
[1:07:35] worshipper
[1:07:37] once
[1:07:39] heard has no more conscious of
[1:07:45] sin that's kind strong Doctrine is it
[1:07:49] now this week you haven't been fed on
[1:07:51] skin milk anyhow we've been in De V rich
[1:07:55] and you talk it very nice and I thank
[1:07:57] God for you I just want to come back
[1:07:59] teach some more to you see because
[1:08:01] you're able to take it see I notice the
[1:08:04] worshipper once heard so now the law
[1:08:08] couldn't do it but in this testate the
[1:08:11] said if the law could have done it then
[1:08:13] Jesus wouldn't had to
[1:08:15] die but here if the worshipper then he
[1:08:18] come watch you watch your a little part
[1:08:20] of but these sacrifices which a
[1:08:23] remembrance is made are sin every
[1:08:28] year for it is not possible that the
[1:08:31] blood of bulls and of goats should take
[1:08:34] away
[1:08:36] sin why how much time we got oh my just
[1:08:41] a little bit we'll we'll close and we
[1:08:42] start up again tonight because I told
[1:08:44] you that quck look let's take it just in
[1:08:46] a little tight quickly the worshipper
[1:08:49] once heard has no more conscience of sin
[1:08:52] Jesus said be you perfect even as the
[1:08:54] father in Heaven is perfect here's the
[1:08:56] Old Testament out there the worshipper
[1:08:58] comes he knows he's done something wrong
[1:09:00] he goes out and hunts him a land with a
[1:09:02] spot that brings it to it washs in the
[1:09:04] lad brings in the high priest stand at
[1:09:06] the alt the priest then the high priest
[1:09:10] stands at the altar and he takes the
[1:09:12] lamb he examines it over there's not a
[1:09:15] blemish on it nowhere then the the
[1:09:18] Lamb's laid up on the altar the
[1:09:20] worshipper puts his hands up on the lamb
[1:09:22] and said I confess my sins that I I
[1:09:25] broke the Sabbath I done this day or the
[1:09:27] other I sinned I've done something wrong
[1:09:30] and the priest kills a lion catches the
[1:09:32] blood puts it over here and burns it as
[1:09:34] a sacrifice on the brass altar which
[1:09:37] means divine judgment as the smoke went
[1:09:39] up Israel fell on his knees and gave
[1:09:42] their prayers as it went up on the smoke
[1:09:44] of this burnt blood no blood on fire
[1:09:47] watch what takes place now this great
[1:09:48] pupo went to smoke up in all Israel and
[1:09:51] thousands of trumpets sound and every
[1:09:53] man dropped everything he had and went
[1:09:54] to prayer
[1:09:56] all right three times a day that was
[1:09:58] made the worshipper then went back out
[1:10:01] with the same desire in his heart maybe
[1:10:03] come in for committing adultery and he
[1:10:05] said Lord I did wrong I committed
[1:10:08] adultery I've got to die because you
[1:10:10] said if you sin you're going to die so
[1:10:13] this innocent lamb will die in my place
[1:10:15] so I offer you my lamb I paid my money
[1:10:18] for it so I'll come in and offer you my
[1:10:20] lamb and I confess my sin and this lamb
[1:10:22] has taken my place an innocent you I
[1:10:26] ought to die you was going to kill me
[1:10:28] but you told me if I get this lamb and
[1:10:29] let this lamb die in my place then I
[1:10:32] could go free then he cut his throat got
[1:10:34] his blood thr it on the brazing Divine
[1:10:36] alar of judgment and the blood the folk
[1:10:38] went up to God and God received it said
[1:10:40] I receive it the man walked right back
[1:10:42] out there with the same lust in his
[1:10:44] heart
[1:10:45] another that's
[1:10:48] right and this place where Jesus is the
[1:10:52] Lamb of God why the GM of life is in the
[1:10:58] bloodstream amen and that was an animal
[1:11:02] life and an animal blood had no
[1:11:04] conscience of sin certainly not so it
[1:11:08] wasn't strong enough because it knew not
[1:11:10] what sin was but when God came down into
[1:11:14] the blood cell that was in Mary's womb
[1:11:16] that created the BL of Christ Jesus that
[1:11:19] human blood amen was powerful enough to
[1:11:24] take the human heart and when the
[1:11:27] worshipper comes and puts his hands on
[1:11:29] Jesus head and confesses his sins and
[1:11:32] the lamb was killed and his name is
[1:11:35] written on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:11:37] God gives him the same Holy Spirit was
[1:11:39] in that blood and he confesses his sins
[1:11:42] on he has no more desire of sin
[1:11:45] amen amen
[1:11:48] hallelujah how the goel amen no more
[1:11:53] desire sin
[1:11:56] then the worshipper walked out with a
[1:11:58] clean
[1:11:59] heart the worshiper the law being a
[1:12:03] shadow but in Christ it was taken
[1:12:06] away he taken away the first so he could
[1:12:09] add the second he couldn't have you at
[1:12:10] the same time you can't have a law that
[1:12:12] says it's a $5 fine to run this street
[1:12:15] right out the next say you can go free
[1:12:17] you can't do it you couldn't put
[1:12:18] judgment so judgment is based upon
[1:12:21] something not upon a lamb upon Christ
[1:12:24] amen Christ the son of God who was God
[1:12:27] manifested in the p and The Germ of life
[1:12:31] that come into the womb of Mary that
[1:12:34] developed that cell C the cell that
[1:12:37] brought forth this body to shed blood
[1:12:39] down Us in order that God could be made
[1:12:41] blood and the Bible said we are saved
[1:12:44] through the blood of God Amen I used to
[1:12:48] say that I was saved by Jewish blood
[1:12:50] there was not one spot of Jewish blood
[1:12:52] in his
[1:12:53] body he was neither two genti he was God
[1:12:58] Amen there's not one drop of the
[1:13:00] mother's blood in a baby that's your
[1:13:03] doctor it's all wraps in the mother's
[1:13:05] blood but not the mother can it's got TB

[1:13:21] never hat it isn't f it hasn't got any
[1:13:24] blood in it

[1:16:39] time sin was
[1:16:42] committed and if you notice the parent
[1:16:45] and Garden of Eden substituted animal
[1:16:48] lives you notice it but animal life went

[1:17:55] can give blood one to another but
[1:17:57] there's not one
[1:18:00] animal that can give a blood
[1:18:03] plasma why God has made of all Nations

[1:19:39] beginning the curse put him where he's
[1:19:41] at the Bible said he was not a reptile
[1:19:44] he was a beast and the most subtle of

[1:28:14] God now let's change our scene 19 4,000
[1:28:19] years has passed we're in Jerusalem this
[1:28:21] morning I hear a noise what is it I look
[1:28:24] outside sin and the Earth bath with wars
[1:28:29] and rumors of wars and blood adultery
[1:28:33] and sin and shame and disgrace of the
[1:28:35] all Springs of that couple look at just
[1:28:38] like Herod 70 of her boys and girls died
[1:28:41] on gism and prostitution from sin look
[1:28:44] at at Adam and Eve children how they're
[1:28:45] dying dying in that little weak blood
[1:28:48] down there somehow with a tone it's an
[1:28:50] animal's blood ain't got no life in it
[1:28:52] it can't come before God that life it
[1:28:54] goes out that blood it can't come
[1:28:55] because it's a dumb brute it's got to
[1:28:58] have some kind of a life that knows
[1:29:00] right from wrong God come down now in
[1:29:03] flesh under a virgin knows right from
[1:29:06] wrong now it's Jerusalem I hear a noise
[1:29:09] what is it oh away with him crucified
[1:29:13] why is it the very creator of the human
[1:29:17] race his own children crying for his
[1:29:21] blood they're God's Own creation crying
[1:29:23] for his own blood when I to held himself
[1:29:27] and would have done it it's child have
[1:29:28] been lost don't you see that's Jehovah
[1:29:31] from the garden of
[1:29:33] e since you seen there veiled in this
[1:29:36] human
[1:29:37] flesh oh
[1:29:41] my notice a little farther wish we get
[1:29:43] on this lesson a little farther down
[1:29:46] there it said that Tabernacle Solomon
[1:29:49] building a tabernacle but the most high
[1:29:51] dwth not in houses made of hands
[1:29:54] but a body has thou prepared me when
[1:29:58] Solomon built the temple Jehovah there's
[1:30:01] a good one Hallelujah that's C just
[1:30:05] right thank the Lord for that there's a
[1:30:08] revelation just fresh righty now you're
[1:30:10] going to get
[1:30:11] it when Solomon built the temple and it
[1:30:15] was dedicated God came into that Temple
[1:30:19] and dwelt there is that right and when
[1:30:22] Jesus Christ was dedicated to God on the
[1:30:24] river of Jordan God came down and in
[1:30:28] Jesus
[1:30:30] Christ
[1:30:32] jeh
[1:30:34] amen confession of sin always had to
[1:30:37] look to the temple confess sin has to
[1:30:39] look to Christ there's the temple of God
[1:30:43] God dwelt in
[1:30:44] Christ there he is now you believe
[1:30:47] Jehovah don't you thought of that before
[1:30:50] or sometimes when we're moving along in
[1:30:52] the spirit and setting Heavenly places
[1:30:55] how Christ can move in the church like
[1:30:57] that see how the revelations move
[1:31:00] there's a perfect Revelation coming from
[1:31:02] God he's setting up the platform
[1:31:04] now I know that come from there I know
[1:31:08] it did the temple was where God dwelt
[1:31:12] and the people anywhere in trouble like
[1:31:13] Jonah in the belly of the whale look
[1:31:15] towards the temple anywhere they look to
[1:31:17] this Temple and pray them out here and
[1:31:20] now the temple of God was not made with
[1:31:23] hand you said you prepared me a building
[1:31:25] but that wasn't it but a body has thou
[1:31:27] prepared me there it is God in Christ
[1:31:33] then I hear that howling mob who are
[1:31:36] seen look at him there they're crying
[1:31:38] for his blood his own children screaming
[1:31:41] out away with him their creator their
[1:31:44] God their maker their
