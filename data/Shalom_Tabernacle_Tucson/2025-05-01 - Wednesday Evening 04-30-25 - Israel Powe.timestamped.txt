[7:10] a hand of praise this evening. Amen. You
[7:13] may be seated. Oh, let's sing about how
[7:16] beautiful heaven must be.
[7:23] We read of a place that's called
[7:28] heaven. It's made for the pure and the
[7:34] free. These truths in God's word he has
[7:40] given. How beautiful heaven must be.
[7:46] How beautiful heaven must
[7:51] be. Sweet home of the happy and
[7:57] free. Fair haven of rest for the
[8:03] weery. How beautiful heaven must
[8:08] be. In heaven. No drooping nor pining.
[8:15] No wishing for elsewhere to
[8:19] be. God's light is forever there
[8:24] [Music]
[8:25] shineing. How beautiful heaven must
[8:31] be. How beautiful heaven must
[8:36] be. Sweet home of the happy and free.
[8:43] Fair haven of rest for the
[8:48] weary. How beautiful heaven must
[8:53] be. Well, pure waters of life there are
[8:59] flowing and all who drink may be
[9:05] free. Where jewels of his splendor are
[9:09] glowing.
[9:12] How beautiful heaven must
[9:16] be. Oh, how beautiful heaven must
[9:22] be. Sweet home of the happy and
[9:27] free. A fair haven of rest for the
[9:34] weery. How beautiful heaven must be.
[9:40] And the angels so sweetly are
[9:45] singing up there by the beautiful
[9:51] sea. Sweet cords from their gold hearts
[9:55] are
[9:57] ringing. How beautiful heaven must be.
[10:01] Let's sing that last verse one more
[10:03] time. Angels so sweetly are
[10:08] singing up there by the beautiful
[10:14] sea. Sweet cords from their gold hearts
[10:18] are
[10:20] ringing. How beautiful heaven must
[10:26] be. How beautiful heaven must be.
[10:32] Sweet home of the happy and
[10:37] free. A fair haven of rest for the
[10:43] weary. How beautiful heaven must be. A
[10:48] fair haven, a fair haven of rest for the
[10:55] weery. How beautiful heaven must
[11:00] be. Amen. Oh, how I long to see that
[11:04] place that some glad
[11:07] morning. I thought
[11:09] number
[11:11] one would
[11:14] surely be
[11:17] me. I thought
[11:19] I could
[11:22] be what I
[11:24] wanted to be.
[11:28] I thought
[11:30] I could
[11:32] build whole life
[11:35] sinking
[11:37] sand, but I can't
[11:40] even walk without you
[11:45] holding my
[11:50] hand. No, I can't
[11:53] even walk without you.
[11:58] Holding my
[12:00] hand. For the
[12:03] mountains to
[12:05] high and the
[12:08] valleyies to
[12:11] wide. Down on my
[12:16] knees where I've learned to
[12:21] stand. I can't
[12:24] even walk without you
[12:28] holding my
[12:33] hand. Well, I thought I had
[12:39] done a lot on my own.
[12:45] I thought
[12:47] I can make
[12:49] it
[12:51] all
[12:54] alone. I thought of
[12:59] myself as a
[13:01] mighty big man. But Lord, I can't even
[13:08] walk without you
[13:12] holding my hand.
[13:17] No, I can't
[13:20] even walk without you
[13:24] holding my hand.
[13:28] For the
[13:29] mountains too
[13:31] high and the
[13:34] valleyies too
[13:37] wide down all my
[13:42] knees is where I've learned to stand.
[13:47] Lord, I can't
[13:50] even walk without you
[13:54] holding my hand with all your heart.
[13:59] Lord, no, I can't
[14:02] even walk without you
[14:07] holding my hand.
[14:10] For the
[14:12] mountains too
[14:14] high and the
[14:17] valleyies too
[14:20] wide down on my
[14:24] knees, it's where I've learned to
[14:29] stand for. I can't even walk.
[14:35] Lord, I can't
[14:38] even walk. No, I can't even
[14:44] walk without you
[14:47] holding my
[14:52] hand. Amen.
[14:56] Amen. Oh, I
[14:59] am redeemed.
[15:02] I've been bald with the
[15:07] price.
[15:09] Jesus has changed.
[15:18] If
[15:20] anybody
[15:22] asks just who I
[15:27] am, tell
[15:29] them that I am
[15:37] redeemed. Lord, I am redeemed.
[15:43] I've been bought with the
[15:47] price of
[15:50] Jesus has changed my whole life.
[15:59] If
[16:01] anybody asks you, oh just who I
[16:08] am, you can tell them that I am
[16:14] redeemed. One last time, let's sing it
[16:17] out to him. And I am redeemed.
[16:24] I've been born with a
[16:28] price. Oh my
[16:31] Jesus, he has changed my whole life.
[16:36] [Music]
[16:39] If
[16:41] anybody asks you, oh just who I
[16:48] am, oh you tell them that I
[16:54] am.
[16:57] Greetings. Amen. Is that your testimony
[17:00] this evening? Lord, I'm one of them.
[17:02] Amen. As we get ready for our pastor to
[17:05] come this evening, let's just sing that
[17:08] chorus worship song. He has forgiven
[17:13] me.
[17:15] He
[17:16] has
[17:19] forgiven me.
[17:22] My sins have been
[17:25] washed from his
[17:27] [Music]
[17:29] memory by the blood of the
[17:34] lamb of
[17:38] Calary.
[17:41] He
[17:42] has
[17:45] forgiven me.
[17:49] He
[17:51] has
[17:53] forgiven
[17:55] me. My sins have been washed from his
[18:03] memory. By the blood of the
[18:08] lamb of Calary.
[18:15] He
[18:17] has
[18:19] forgiven me. One more time.
[18:23] He
[18:25] has
[18:27] forgiven me.
[18:30] My sins have been washed from his
[18:38] memory by the blood of the
[18:42] lamb of
[18:47] Calary. Yes,
[18:49] he
[18:51] has
[18:53] forgiven me. as we continue to worship
[18:57] him. If you play this
[19:01] [Music]
[20:56] Heat. Heat.
[21:18] Amen. So good to be in the house of the
[21:19] Lord with you tonight. Amen. Let's go to
[21:22] the Lord in prayer.
[21:24] Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[21:27] bringing us together once again. Lord,
[21:30] to bring us to this place that you have
[21:33] given to us to worship. Lord, I'm so
[21:36] happy to be here with the saints. Lord,
[21:38] I pray that your presence now will bless
[21:42] everyone. F feed us with your word,
[21:45] Lord. We just commit all things into
[21:48] your hands tonight. We love you and we
[21:50] thank you. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[21:54] And everyone can say amen. Amen. We're
[21:56] so happy to be here with you tonight.
[21:59] So, welcome home.
[22:01] I'm so glad to be back home.
[22:03] [Applause]
[22:05] Amen. Yes. I had a wonderful time there
[22:08] in Liberia. I think we had eight eight
[22:12] or 10 services, I believe. Um starting
[22:15] with the Easter convention that they had
[22:17] there. There's another ministering
[22:19] brother that was a uh part. Thank you
[22:23] musicians. Bless you. That was a part of
[22:25] those meetings there from Nigeria, a
[22:27] young man. And he so he helped uh
[22:29] shoulder a good portion of the services.
[22:32] We ser started services on Friday and on
[22:37] Saturday. Two services Friday, two
[22:39] services Saturday, and then we had two
[22:42] services Sunday. And then they have a
[22:45] radio broadcast that was very, very
[22:47] interesting to me. really uh you know
[22:52] spoke uh sparked my interest quite a
[22:55] bit. I really enjoyed that um radio
[22:58] ministry. It was live in the studio.
[23:00] They had just started that on the Sunday
[23:03] afternoon every Sunday afternoon and
[23:05] they'll play the prophet or one of the
[23:08] brothers there will speak trying to get
[23:10] the word out there to their community.
[23:13] And uh so we were able to do that one
[23:16] Sunday and then the second
[23:19] Sunday and I was I was preparing for it
[23:21] on the second Sunday I was putting the
[23:24] notes together and we're
[23:26] not you know you're fishing so we're not
[23:29] really me mentioning the prophet and
[23:31] stuff like that but just trying to show
[23:33] in the scriptures that there's more in
[23:35] the word of God and and so we were able
[23:38] to continue to mention the call letters
[23:42] of the church and our purpose and we
[23:44] continued to do that throughout the
[23:46] program and it seemed to be a little
[23:48] successful. We had a some feedback from
[23:51] that. Immediately afterwards, we met a
[23:54] sister or a lady that was interested in
[23:56] hearing more about the word. And so, I
[23:58] don't know about you, for me that I love
[24:02] that. I love hearing about somebody
[24:05] interested in the word. I mean, it's
[24:07] nice to have our homes and the things
[24:10] that we would do in life that we would,
[24:12] you know, gather and so forth, things
[24:14] that are fun, things that are
[24:16] interesting to us, but there's nothing
[24:17] more. I mean, it just does something to
[24:20] me to see a young man or young woman or
[24:22] an old man or old woman try to find out
[24:25] more about the word. And so, that was so
[24:29] good. And you know after those meetings
[24:32] um
[24:33] that Monday we took a day off and then
[24:36] Tuesday I went and spoke at a church.
[24:39] Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
[24:42] um was services every day. Saturday was
[24:46] a ministers meeting then we had a
[24:48] service. Sunday morning and then the
[24:51] Sunday afternoon radio broadcast. So
[24:53] please don't ask me how my vacation was
[24:56] cuz it was not a vacation. We were on
[24:58] the field for the Lord, but I felt
[25:01] really good. My wife saw me on the video
[25:04] with a video text. She said, "Israel,
[25:06] you look so happy. You look rested." And
[25:08] uh so I hope I look rested and happy um
[25:13] for the rest of all
[25:15] time. Amen. I know the the jet lag will
[25:18] probably catch up to me here sometime
[25:20] this evening, but we're so happy to be
[25:22] here and the Saints uh send their
[25:24] greetings to each of you. Uh Liberia, we
[25:28] just went through a war and some of you
[25:31] may not remember brother pastor Elijah
[25:33] when he came here to speak for us on the
[25:36] Broadway church. He was just here a
[25:38] month or so ago and he was 15 years old
[25:42] when um that war took place and their
[25:46] family had to leave and they ran to
[25:49] Ghana and they're poor and it's just a
[25:53] war. And that's where actually he heard
[25:55] about the message was in Ghana while
[25:58] their country is being torn apart by
[26:00] rebels and so forth. And then after the
[26:03] war was over, it subsided. The people
[26:06] started to come back and then the war
[26:08] broke out again. So there's this
[26:10] long history of this. And so he showed
[26:14] me where he lived. He built his home
[26:16] there. It's mainly concrete. Very nice
[26:19] home, big and it's built in the whole
[26:22] neighborhood. And everyone in the
[26:24] neighborhood is selling something on the
[26:26] streets there. Everyone has a little
[26:28] business that they're trying to sell
[26:30] food and little dinners and corn and
[26:34] mangoes or whatever. They're selling
[26:35] fish. And it's like it's hard to really
[26:39] understand how they're buying from one
[26:41] another right in the neighborhood. all
[26:42] down every street, roads, barbers,
[26:46] little places that they would call a
[26:48] pharmacy. Um um but that was all just
[26:53] nothing was there just in 2016. And here
[26:56] they are just, you know, so it really
[26:58] brings a perspective as to what their
[27:01] country is doing and how they're
[27:04] building. They're moving forward.
[27:05] They're trying to build very very poor,
[27:08] very, very hot. the electricity turns
[27:10] off every night and sometimes during the
[27:13] day and then you got to get the
[27:15] generator going and so I
[27:19] um the air conditioning that was an
[27:22] issue for me. It was quite hot, very hot
[27:26] and humid, but I didn't need to use any
[27:29] lotion all the time I was there. And so
[27:32] it was very and I rested very well and
[27:35] the food was very very good. food. I
[27:38] would pay top dollar for their fish and
[27:40] chicken and all of the fresh fruits that
[27:43] they serve you and the people there.
[27:45] They're so loving and so kind. Um the
[27:49] the traffic there is just I could not
[27:52] drive in that traffic. The way they
[27:54] drive there, it's just it's hard to
[27:56] imagine. Just motorcycles everywhere and
[27:59] then cars, a few cars and then these
[28:02] three-wheel vehicles. I saw one Ford
[28:04] truck the three the two weeks that I was
[28:06] there. Everything's a Nissan or Hyundai
[28:09] or and there's just people are running
[28:11] on the road just I mean they're selling
[28:13] gasoline by the gallon in jars glass
[28:16] jars and so they have a few gas stations
[28:19] but most people are on the side of the
[28:20] road you get a gallon or two gallons of
[28:24] gas just like that just wow just so it's
[28:27] really really different and
[28:31] uh um so I'm glad to be back home to be
[28:35] here with you saints I got back to the
[28:37] church here and I came right to the
[28:39] altar and I said, "Thank you, Lord, for
[28:41] bringing me back home
[28:42] again." Amen. And so, um, lovely group
[28:47] of people. They love the Lord all their
[28:49] heart. So easy to preach to the
[28:51] ministers meeting. They wanted me to
[28:54] speak with the brothers there, some of
[28:56] the pastors. And what's so encouraging
[28:58] is
[28:59] um you know, brother Elijah, he has a a
[29:03] big church that they built and the
[29:05] Easter convention, they all kind of come
[29:07] together. There's about a thousand
[29:08] believers or so that come to the meeting
[29:12] just really fired up. They have
[29:14] instruments and the music, the people
[29:16] dancing all through the um the service
[29:20] and I mean it's just really really nice
[29:23] um in the in that atmosphere. I think
[29:26] everyone here could probably get your
[29:29] praise
[29:30] on without nobody looking at everybody,
[29:33] the little ones, the old ones, just
[29:35] praising the Lord with all their heart.
[29:39] Just beautiful atmosphere to call into.
[29:42] And what I loved about them, they were
[29:45] they would they sang a few new songs,
[29:47] but most of their songs were all only
[29:50] belief songs. But they' take that song
[29:53] and the Holy Spirit would take that song
[29:56] into worship and it was just beautiful.
[29:59] And so we just thank the Lord for that.
[30:01] My batteries have been charged. Thank
[30:04] the Lord. I'm glad to be associated with
[30:07] those believers there. And you can't go
[30:10] everywhere and you can't do everything.
[30:12] But I was so glad I was to be a part of
[30:14] that. I brought my the greetings from
[30:16] this church to those saints there. They
[30:18] were so happy that I was able to come. P
[30:22] brother Elijah's been asking me to come
[30:24] for quite some time. And I said,
[30:25] "Easter, don't even think about it. I'm
[30:28] not coming to Easter. I'm not leaving my
[30:30] church. I have to see if I can get the
[30:31] ticket." And once I made that decision,
[30:33] I kind of let her know somehow. I can't
[30:36] remember how she found
[30:37] out. The way I used to tell Sister
[30:40] Sharon, the way she used to find out
[30:42] what was going on, we would go over to
[30:43] Sister Kay's house. And Sister Kay would
[30:46] ask me all kind of questions and I would
[30:48] answer her. And then Sharon say, "You
[30:50] never told me that, but honey, you never
[30:52] asked me." And so, Sister Kay would we
[30:56] would fellowship. We were good friends.
[30:58] You would just squeeze stuff out of me
[30:59] all the time. And then she would laugh
[31:02] at Sharon because Sharon didn't get it
[31:04] out of me. But um and so that was the
[31:09] the part of that trip. I didn't go there
[31:11] to to get a like a
[31:13] vacation per se, but I had a wonderful
[31:16] time meeting those believers and taking
[31:20] them in just the stuff that I preach
[31:22] here. I preach it right there. the
[31:25] things that I feel that are important.
[31:27] They had a wave of this um you know this
[31:30] unbelief of some of the ministers that
[31:33] are well known here, they're well known
[31:35] over there and then when they've fallen
[31:37] away, they try to contact and get back
[31:39] into the country with you know this
[31:42] doctrine about the pictures and what
[31:44] pictures you have up in the church. But
[31:46] those believers, they don't, that's not
[31:47] even the issue there. Brother Brandham
[31:50] had the pictures up in his church.
[31:52] What's the problem? That's their
[31:53] attitude. And I appreciate that. And I
[31:56] know putting a picture up is not it's up
[31:58] to whoever church can do however they
[32:00] want to do it. It's not an issue. But if
[32:03] you're going to criticize someone for
[32:04] having a picture up, then you
[32:06] criticizing the prophet in my eyes. The
[32:09] prophet put it up.
[32:10] So, but these are just little things
[32:13] that come up in the hour that we live
[32:16] in. And it's so good to see these
[32:17] brothers standing on the word. There's a
[32:21] uh the little churches that I went to,
[32:23] the other little churches, one brother
[32:26] is meeting in a a school that he's
[32:29] renting. Another one had bought a piece
[32:31] of property and they're building.
[32:34] Another brother had already built on
[32:37] their church and they got it up and
[32:39] coming. Another group that broke off and
[32:43] um that brother Elijah goes to is three
[32:45] hours away. one way for him to go there.
[32:48] Every week he goes there to that group
[32:52] and it's building up and they're just
[32:54] just so it's hard to to really explain.
[32:58] You know, you're reading the quotations,
[33:00] you're reading from the prophet and the
[33:02] people are just pulling from from
[33:05] whatever you're saying and they're
[33:07] taking notes. They want to be they want
[33:09] to hear about the message when they
[33:11] heard that you know right around the
[33:13] corner we can see can the Canalita
[33:16] mountains up here just it's just really
[33:19] really they love that they just you know
[33:23] really look at us as being very very
[33:26] privileged people to live in in you know
[33:30] the city of Tucson or even in the US for
[33:33] that matter and so it's so nice to see
[33:36] the different levels of believers, young
[33:39] men, 30s, 40s, some in their 50s that
[33:42] are building their little churches and
[33:45] after the war and Liberia is growing and
[33:48] it's coming together. It has its own
[33:50] constitution and all the history of it.
[33:53] It's so nice to see the work of the Lord
[33:57] moving forward. I would love to go back
[33:59] again to see them as soon as possible,
[34:02] but I pro I know it won't be this year
[34:05] or maybe not next year. The Lord really
[34:08] have to put it on my heart to go again.
[34:10] Um, but I made that commitment to the
[34:13] Lord. I'll go. You open the door. You
[34:15] lead me to go to put my heart with the
[34:18] missionary and the missionary work
[34:20] that's going on around the world. That's
[34:22] what I that's what's in my heart. All
[34:25] right. So, and I appreciate you all for
[34:30] um being faithful. It's so nice to see
[34:32] on the stream there our drummer there
[34:35] praying for the service. It just touched
[34:37] my heart to see each of you. I was like,
[34:39] please span that camera around. Turn it
[34:42] around. I want to see. And so, I was
[34:44] there uh seeing you all worship the
[34:46] Lord. It was so good. So happy to have
[34:49] brother uh Joe here to watch over the
[34:51] service and the Sunday school and each
[34:54] one at their post of duty. The song is
[34:56] in the worship did my heart so good. I
[34:59] just put that stream on and I go to
[35:02] sleep listening to it and try to stay
[35:05] awake and then come back and hear it
[35:08] again. And um so I'm happy to be back
[35:11] home again. So God bless each of you.
[35:15] Amen. Let's go to the prayer meeting.
[35:17] Before we do, we're going to go into the
[35:19] word. Just a little portion of the word
[35:21] that I um just kind of struck my
[35:25] interest here in second Peter chapter 2.
[35:28] If we could stand and turn
[35:35] there. I
[35:37] think one of the last times we were
[35:39] here, we were speaking out of Jude. But
[35:42] ye
[35:43] beloved, building up yourself in the
[35:45] most holy faith. And how the book of
[35:48] Jude
[35:50] mentions Kora
[35:53] um Cain and
[35:56] Balum. But in second uh Peter chapter
[36:01] 2 here we
[36:04] see the apostasy just
[36:08] beginning.
[36:09] And many of the apostles warned us of
[36:13] this apostasy that would come. Uh second
[36:17] Thessalonians speaks of it. Second
[36:20] Timothy speaks of it. Jude and then here
[36:24] we have Peter speaking of the apostasy
[36:27] that already started and began to show
[36:31] itself. And then in the message spoken
[36:34] word is the original seed. Brother
[36:35] Brandham is bringing us into that pick
[36:38] up your pen and when he said let us
[36:40] stand like Joshua and Caleb and if you
[36:43] take that little portion I forget what
[36:45] it is 10 minutes or 12 minutes of him
[36:49] writing but the Holy Spirit told him
[36:51] there's some instructions in there for
[36:53] the last day believer. He brings in this
[36:56] Kora and this balum and so forth. But
[37:00] I'd like to take 2 Peter chapter 2. And
[37:02] I believe it's more important than
[37:04] perhaps we realize. Even as there shall
[37:06] be false teachers among you who
[37:11] privately shall bring in damnable
[37:15] heresies, even denying the Lord that
[37:17] brought them and bring upon them swift
[37:20] destruction. And many shall follow their
[37:24] pernituous ways, by reason of whom the
[37:28] way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
[37:31] And through cavitiousness shall they
[37:33] with fain words make merchandise of you,
[37:36] whose judgment now of a long time
[37:38] lingerth not, and their damnation
[37:41] slumberereth not. Their damnation
[37:43] sleepeth not. For if God spared not the
[37:46] angels that sinned, but cast them down
[37:48] to hell, delivered them to the chains of
[37:51] darkness to be reserved unto judgment,
[37:54] and spared not the old world, but saved
[37:56] Noah the eighth person, a preacher of
[37:58] righteousness, bringing in the flood
[38:00] upon the world of the ungodly, and
[38:02] turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
[38:04] into ashes ashes, condemned them with an
[38:08] overthrow, making them an enample unto
[38:10] those that after should live ungodly,
[38:12] and delivered just Lot vexed with the
[38:14] filth filthy conversation of the wicked.
[38:16] For that righteous man dwelling among
[38:18] them and seeing hearing vex his
[38:20] righteous soul from day to day with the
[38:23] unlawful deeds. The Lord knoweth how to
[38:26] deliver the godly out of temptation and
[38:29] to reserve the unjust unto the day of
[38:32] judgment to be punished, but chiefly
[38:34] them that walk after the flesh and the
[38:36] lusts of uncleanness and despise
[38:39] government. presumptuous are they
[38:43] self-willed. They are not afraid to
[38:46] speak evil of
[38:48] dignities. Whereas angels which are
[38:50] greater in power and might bring not
[38:53] railing accusation against them before
[38:56] the Lord. Stop there verse 11. You know
[38:59] if you take Jude the book of Jude this
[39:02] chapter 2 is very very similar to these
[39:06] beasts the one scripture calls them here
[39:09] in verse 12. how they begin to speak
[39:12] things that they don't know about and
[39:15] how the angels don't even go down that
[39:18] path that these fallen men do. And the
[39:20] Bible says that the false teachers would
[39:23] rise. Let's read verse 12. But these as
[39:25] natural brute beasts made to be taken
[39:28] and destroyed, speak evil of things that
[39:30] they understand not, and shall utterly
[39:33] perish in their own corruption, and
[39:36] shall receive the reward of
[39:37] unrighteousness, as they that count it
[39:40] pleasure to riot in the
[39:42] daytime. Spots they are blemishes,
[39:45] sporting themselves with their own
[39:47] deceings, while they feast with you,
[39:50] having eyes full of what? Adultery.
[39:53] Adultery that cannot cease from sin.
[39:57] Beguiling unstable souls. A heart they
[40:01] have exercise with cavitious practices.
[40:04] Cursed children which have forsaken the
[40:08] right way and are gone astray following
[40:11] the way of Balum son of Bozar who loved
[40:14] the wages of unrighteousness but was
[40:17] rebuked for his iniquity. The dumb ass
[40:20] speaking with man's voice forbade the
[40:23] madness of the prophet. These are wells
[40:26] without water, clouds that are carried
[40:29] with the tempest to whom the mist of
[40:32] darkness is reserved
[40:36] forever. For when they speak great
[40:38] swelling words of vanity, they allure
[40:40] through the lust of the flesh, through
[40:42] much wantedness. Those that were clean
[40:45] escape from them who live in error.
[40:48] While they promise liberty, they
[40:50] themselves are the servants of
[40:51] corruption. For of whom a man is
[40:53] overcome the same as he is brought into
[40:56] bondage. For if after they have escaped
[40:58] the pollutions of the world to the
[41:01] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[41:02] Christ, they are again entangled therein
[41:07] and overcome. The latter end is worse
[41:11] with them than the beginning. For it had
[41:15] been better for them not to have known
[41:18] the way of righteousness than after they
[41:21] have known it to turn from the holy
[41:23] commandment delivered unto them. May God
[41:27] add a blessing to the reading of his
[41:28] word. You may be seated.
[41:31] Amen. So, what a warning, huh?
[41:35] What a portion of scripture that Peter
[41:41] is now warning us. If you take Paul's
[41:44] writing in second and first
[41:47] Thessalonians and you take his writings
[41:49] to Timothy and you take the foster
[41:52] brother of Jesus Jude, he gives these
[41:55] warnings. Also in the book of
[41:57] revelations in the tharin church age,
[42:02] the scriptures talks about knowing the
[42:05] depths of Satan. And brother Brandham
[42:07] brings these depths of Satan. He talks
[42:11] about Jezebel. He talks about the
[42:13] nicicoatans. Then he brings in this
[42:15] Balum. And this Balum is quite an
[42:19] interesting character in the scripture.
[42:21] You'll find him in numbers that he was a
[42:24] hired prophet, but he's mentioned three
[42:28] times in the New Testament. As his life
[42:31] and character was there in the New
[42:34] Testament after the cross, he was
[42:36] brought up again for a purpose, for a
[42:38] warning to all of us. It's in second
[42:41] Peter chapter 2 that we just read, the
[42:43] way of Balum. Jude 1:11, the error of
[42:47] Balum and Revelations 2:14, the doctrine
[42:51] of Balum talking about the same
[42:53] character. Now, brother Bam makes this
[42:56] statement in the adoption right in the
[42:58] beginning as he is going to bring this
[43:03] series, the adoption. How many has read
[43:05] this or heard this series? Isn't that
[43:07] beautiful? It's very nice. You know, he
[43:10] had just come with the experience beyond
[43:13] the curtain of time. And after that
[43:15] experience he brings this teaching this
[43:17] series of teaching while he was in the
[43:20] hospital he was getting ready I think to
[43:22] go to Africa and then the Lord started
[43:24] to you know this is what he is studying
[43:26] the book of Ephesians parallel Joshua
[43:28] but then he also started to um express
[43:33] to us this is his first time really
[43:36] bringing going beyond the curtain of
[43:38] time and what death was really like when
[43:41] you leave a cross but this is what he
[43:42] says in the adoption
[43:44] In paragraph number six, he says this
[43:49] here, Bible teaching is usually a little
[43:53] treacherous, a little no kind of walking
[43:57] out on the thin ice, we call it, but we
[44:00] just feel that maybe at this point, at
[44:03] this time, it might be good to kind of
[44:06] bring the church to what I think to a
[44:09] complete
[44:10] understanding
[44:12] positionally of what we are in Christ
[44:16] Jesus. And sometimes I think that
[44:18] preaching is a wonderful thing, but I
[44:20] believe sometimes, brother Beer, that
[44:22] teaching goes beyond that and kind of
[44:26] especially to the church. Now, preaching
[44:29] usually catches the center, brings him
[44:32] under condemnation by the word, but
[44:35] teaching places a man positionally what
[44:40] he is.
[44:42] And we can never rightly be able to have
[44:45] faith until positionally we know what we
[44:50] are. Now if the United States of this
[44:53] fair land here sent me over to Russia as
[44:55] an ambassador of this nation to Russia,
[44:58] then they have officially sent me to
[45:01] Russia. All the power that the United
[45:04] States has is behind me. My word is just
[45:08] the same as the United States. If I have
[45:10] been recognized as an
[45:13] ambassador, then if God has sent us to
[45:16] be his ambassador, all the power that is
[45:20] in heaven, all that God is, all of his
[45:24] angels, all of his power stands behind
[45:28] our words if we are correctly and
[45:32] ordained, sent messengers to the people.
[45:35] God has to honor the word. For he has so
[45:39] solemnly written that whatsoever you
[45:42] bind on earth, that will I bind in
[45:44] heaven. Whatsoever you loose on earth,
[45:47] that will I loose in heaven. And I will
[45:50] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom.
[45:52] Oh, such great promises he's given the
[45:57] church. And so to me, I want to embrace
[46:03] that. what an ambassador is. It's the
[46:06] highest official representing
[46:10] uh a nation is an ambassador to another
[46:13] country. You speak for the United
[46:15] States. And if we are really called to
[46:18] bride of
[46:19] Christ, then we really should know who
[46:22] we are as believers and our position in
[46:26] the word comes not by just preaching,
[46:30] not by, you know, we have some wonderful
[46:32] services that are, you know, you can
[46:34] feel the whatever the presence of the
[46:36] Lord. He comes, the anointing of the
[46:38] Lord comes in many different ways. And
[46:40] then the preaching of the gospel,
[46:41] there's some excitement. There's a, you
[46:43] know, but teaching is far beyond
[46:47] preaching. Because teaching shows you in
[46:51] the word who you are. You can pick up
[46:54] your Bible and find out that's me right
[46:56] there. That's Balum over there. And
[47:00] these things you must know and they're
[47:03] they're things that you have to know as
[47:05] a believer uh standing in this last day.
[47:08] And so the scriptures
[47:12] um admonish us to study the word to
[47:18] study the word. We don't just read it.
[47:21] We actually study it because in studying
[47:24] it we learn far beyond what preaching
[47:28] can do for us. What is the teaching? The
[47:31] the teaching stabilizes the believer. It
[47:35] settles them to know who they are. And
[47:37] so this Balum and who he was and what he
[47:43] did to
[47:45] Israel, let's look at that just for a
[47:48] moment. All right. The prophet of God
[47:51] tells us here in the
[47:58] message, get this for you here.
[48:04] Does God ever change his mind about his
[48:06] word? Here's what he says. Paragraph
[48:09] number 172. What happened? Balam, he
[48:12] succeeded in weakening Israel. What did
[48:15] he do? He weakened their camp. God let
[48:19] him go and weakened their camp and it
[48:22] polluted the whole camp. And when some
[48:25] doctrine starts that's not the Bible,
[48:29] sorry.
[48:35] Sorry
[48:38] there. It's not the Bible truth. It
[48:41] pollutes the whole camp. Somebody raises
[48:44] up with a different idea like Kora and
[48:47] say, "Well, this that and the other and
[48:50] I got a different idea. It pollute it
[48:52] pollutes the whole camp." And that's
[48:54] what's done the whole church camp today.
[48:58] That's right. teaching as he did,
[49:01] weakening the whole camp for Kadesh
[49:03] Barnea, the word showdown. When they got
[49:06] to Kadesh Barnea, then the weakening of
[49:09] the camp, they come back. They had went
[49:11] right. Remember, they'd eat angels food.
[49:14] They had the word of God every night
[49:16] made manifest and they eat the food.
[49:19] They drink from the rock. They did all
[49:21] seen the miracles. They watched Moses
[49:24] and seen his word, seen his prophecies,
[49:27] everything. Then finally, when they
[49:29] listened to this false teacher come in
[49:32] among them and teach wrong, he weakened
[49:35] the camp and prospered by it. So what
[49:39] was his teaching? Mo Balam's teaching
[49:42] was that we're all the same.
[49:45] That we're all
[49:46] one. And the reality is we're not all
[49:49] the same and we're not all one. Uh we
[49:53] are one with the word. We're not one
[49:56] with one another in our understanding. I
[49:59] want to be one with the word. And when I
[50:00] become one with the word and you become
[50:03] one with the word, then we're one
[50:05] together. But we can't have no oneness
[50:08] outside of the word. No, no, no. I'm not
[50:11] going to compromise fellowship by
[50:15] letting loose on the word. That's
[50:18] balamism. That's nickelatanism.
[50:21] And in the church ages, the prophet of
[50:23] God brings this out. You see,
[50:25] denominations, they'll try to make you
[50:27] feel guilty because you take a stand on
[50:30] the word. But you have a it is a
[50:35] commandment by almighty God to stay with
[50:37] the word. That's above everything. And
[50:40] that position you must know. You see
[50:43] these fellows in second Peter chapter 2,
[50:47] they bring in heresies
[50:50] privately. It's secretly and a lot of
[50:54] their stuff, a lot of their woos. We see
[50:56] as I I brought the quotes here or
[50:59] brought the notes here when one of the
[51:01] big names in the message that we all
[51:03] know, I don't call any names. I think it
[51:06] was
[51:07] 2014 is what when it was that he fell
[51:11] away, left the message. But if you go
[51:14] back and see what was he teaching before
[51:17] that, two years before that, so like
[51:20] 2012, he fell in 2014, it was a big
[51:23] deal, surrounded around the cloud. And
[51:26] then a few years later, four or five
[51:27] years, another bigname preacher fell.
[51:30] And it looks like separate events when
[51:32] they're really the same event. that
[51:35] spirit is around. It wasn't the only
[51:38] preacher that that spirit went to. And
[51:41] when that thing happens, it would be
[51:42] foolish for me not to highlight that to
[51:46] you brothers and believers. And you walk
[51:49] around with your head in the sand
[51:51] thinking that we're all one. We are not
[51:52] all one. The only thing you want to be
[51:55] one with that you have an allegiance to
[51:57] is God's word. And if you compromise on
[52:02] that, you're on your way out. That whole
[52:05] camp of Israel that heard Balam speak
[52:08] and teach, they were living immoral.
[52:11] They were doing things wrong. And when
[52:14] he tried to curse the people of God, God
[52:16] didn't even see it. God ignored it. God
[52:18] said, "I see nothing but righteousness
[52:20] in Israel." He he he totally the the
[52:23] sacrifice held over all of their back
[52:26] parts, all of their crimes, all of the
[52:28] stuff they were doing that was wrong.
[52:30] But when they begin to mix with those
[52:32] people, God never forgave them. So he
[52:35] knew he couldn't go get God to curse
[52:38] them. So what did he do? He got a false
[52:40] teacher to come in to bring damnable
[52:43] heresies among them. And if teaching
[52:46] settles the believer, what do you think
[52:48] false teaching does? And if teaching is
[52:51] more important than preaching, then what
[52:53] is false teaching? False teaching
[52:56] weakens your faith. It weakens the camp
[53:00] completely. And the Bible says they
[53:02] privately do it. It's done privately.
[53:05] And the prophet of God brings this out.
[53:07] So I'm going to take a few more moments
[53:09] if I can. I have a little bit more time
[53:11] here. All right. Here the prophet of God
[53:14] says this here. Who do you say this is?
[53:17] 1964. My allegiance is not to make
[53:19] everybody feel good, but those you say
[53:21] that it sounds you're separating. These
[53:23] are the quotations of the prophet. This
[53:26] is what he said. And you got to teach
[53:27] that there's a responsibility there.
[53:30] It's not just one place. It's not just
[53:32] one prophet. It was Peter. It was Paul.
[53:34] They were bringing in what this apostasy
[53:37] is. And remember, there will be a great
[53:40] falling away first. That has to happen.
[53:44] Is that what we're seeing taking place?
[53:47] Blogs, these internet ministries now,
[53:51] they didn't just leave the message. Now
[53:53] they have a blob for all those that were
[53:56] hurt that were in the message so they
[53:58] can have a safe place to come and um or
[54:02] whatever it is, you know, the abuse that
[54:04] they were in in church or the abuse with
[54:08] following the message. They have these
[54:10] um these what do you call these internet
[54:12] platforms these uh uh
[54:16] podcast that are becoming like a
[54:19] ministry to them and they're getting
[54:21] more popular and more famous. What about
[54:24] just leaving and backsliding? No, they
[54:26] don't leave and backslide. Now they have
[54:28] a ministry attacking what we believe and
[54:32] we pastors and preacher going to put our
[54:33] head in the sand and go home and cry.
[54:35] No, we can pick up my sword and say what
[54:39] the word says that these things were
[54:42] supposed to happen. Amen. And so you
[54:45] have to know that you are a believer in
[54:49] the word of the Lord that God sent in
[54:51] this day and the enemy will come against
[54:54] that. So the prophet brings this to us
[54:56] in the message, who do you say this is?
[54:59] 162.
[55:02] Now he's seen he couldn't curse you. So
[55:05] what's he going to do? He's going to
[55:08] organize you. Oh, we're all one anyhow.
[55:13] See, we all believe in the same God. So
[55:16] just what Balam did? And didn't Jude
[55:19] warn
[55:21] us? Let's
[55:23] see. I don't know what's going on with
[55:25] my I like preaching from paper. Anyways,
[55:28] let me see if I can get
[55:35] this. And didn't Jude warn us of this?
[55:38] They eroded in the way in the doctrine
[55:41] of Balum and perished in the game of
[55:44] Kora. Doesn't Jude, the foster brother
[55:47] of Jesus, warn us of this in the Bible?
[55:50] They're like Cain from the beginning.
[55:53] The hierling, the one that went to
[55:55] church and built churches and built an
[55:57] altar and sacrifice. They erid in the
[56:00] way of Cain. They run in the way of
[56:02] Balum and perish in the gang saying of
[56:05] Kora. Jude lays the whole thing out just
[56:08] like we're doing it this morning. Here
[56:12] before you like we've been doing the
[56:14] whole thing lays there. They perished in
[56:17] the gang saying of Kora. Just think of
[56:19] that. How bad that was. Just think of
[56:22] what Kora now we all go up to feasts.
[56:26] We're all one. The Moabites believed in
[56:29] God. That was Lot's daughter's kids.
[56:32] See, we all believe in one God.
[56:34] Fundamentally, they were perfectly
[56:36] right. Watch Balam up there. Just as
[56:38] fundamental as any good Baptist or
[56:41] Presbyterian today. You come out there,
[56:44] there was Israel that undenominated.
[56:47] They was a nation. Israel wasn't a
[56:49] nation. It was a people at that time.
[56:52] They didn't want to go God's way after a
[56:55] while. They wanted to be like the rest
[56:57] of the nations. That's when they failed.
[57:00] But as long as they want to stay with
[57:02] God, all right. Amen. The prophet of God
[57:08] continues in the message, the exposition
[57:11] of the church ages, the resume of the
[57:13] ages. He says this. There's no paragraph
[57:18] number. Maybe you can find it for me in
[57:20] the back there. It says, "Now watch this
[57:22] doctrine of Balum most carefully."
[57:26] Notice above all that it is the
[57:28] deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy
[57:33] to bind the people to them by leading
[57:37] the people deliberately into the sin of
[57:40] unbelief.
[57:42] The nicicoatan doctrine was the
[57:44] corruption of the clergy as they sought
[57:46] political power amongst themselves.
[57:49] While balamism is the subjection of the
[57:52] people to their system of creed and
[57:56] worship in order to hold them. Now watch
[57:59] this carefully. Watch what is that bound
[58:02] the people to the nominal church and
[58:04] thereby destroy them. It was the creeds
[58:08] and dogmas formed in the church tenants.
[58:11] It was the doctrine of the Roman
[58:13] Catholic Church. They were not given to
[58:15] the true food. They were not given the
[58:18] true food, the word. They were given the
[58:21] food that came from idol worship,
[58:23] Babylonian paganism, wrapped up in
[58:27] Christian terminology.
[58:29] And that very same spirit and doctrine
[58:32] is right amongst all the Protestants and
[58:35] it's called
[58:36] denomination.
[58:38] Nicolotinism is
[58:40] organization humanizing the leadership
[58:43] of the church and thereby depositing the
[58:48] spirit deposing the spirit. Thank you.
[58:52] Baleumism is
[58:53] denominationalism which takes the church
[58:56] manual instead of the Bible. And right
[58:59] this hour, many of God's people are
[59:02] caught in the snare of
[59:04] denominationalism. And God is crying to
[59:07] them, "Come out of her, my people, that
[59:09] you be not partakers of her sins, that
[59:12] you receive not of her plagues." You
[59:14] see, they are ignorant. But if the
[59:16] rapture should take place at this
[59:18] moment, ignorance would be no court
[59:21] appeal from the judgment of God for
[59:24] being in the wrong ranks.
[59:30] Um because of this message, we shouldn't
[59:32] be ignorant
[59:34] of these things. Can I get a witness?
[59:37] This message gives us a
[59:39] revelation of these things. These very
[59:42] things that we're talking about. We're
[59:44] not following humanism and human
[59:46] government. We're following the word of
[59:48] the Lord.
[59:50] Amen. The prophet of God continues on
[59:53] here and he says this in the resume of
[59:56] the ages again. He says this
[1:00:01] here. All right. I'll take a few more
[1:00:04] minutes. Okay. He says, "Because human
[1:00:07] government is politics pure and simple,
[1:00:12] the church became involved in politics.
[1:00:15] This involvement was welcomed by a
[1:00:17] dictator emperor who joined church
[1:00:20] politics with the state uh politics and
[1:00:24] by force established the false church,
[1:00:27] Satan's false religion as a true
[1:00:30] religion. And through various edicts by
[1:00:33] various emperors, we find the false
[1:00:35] church with state power destroying the
[1:00:38] true vine even more avidly. Sad to say
[1:00:42] the true vine was not exactly immune to
[1:00:45] this doctrine. By that I do not mean
[1:00:48] that the true vine ever did establish
[1:00:50] the nickelan ideas as a doctrine. Far
[1:00:53] from it. But that little worm of death
[1:00:56] kept sucking at the true vine, hoping
[1:00:59] that it might fall. Even within the true
[1:01:02] church, men whom God had called as
[1:01:05] overseers were holding that title to
[1:01:08] mean a little more than just a local
[1:01:11] responsibility.
[1:01:13] It was not the clear understanding of
[1:01:15] Paul that existed in the church at this
[1:01:19] time. For Paul said, "And they glorify
[1:01:21] God in me." No matter what authority
[1:01:23] Paul had, he kept the people looking to
[1:01:26] God for whom is all
[1:01:29] authority. But the clergy was always
[1:01:31] looking to divine leadership plus human.
[1:01:36] Amen. Thus in giving honor where honor
[1:01:39] was not due. We find that the true
[1:01:41] church was spotted with humanism.
[1:01:45] With nicolotinism established, apostolic
[1:01:49] secession placed ministers, pastors
[1:01:52] voted in, etc., it was only one step for
[1:01:56] the false church to proceed to balamism.
[1:02:00] The second step to the depth of Satan
[1:02:04] was now in full progress.
[1:02:07] This second step was the doctrine of
[1:02:09] Balum described in Revelations 2:14
[1:02:12] wherein Balam taught Bailo to stumble
[1:02:15] the children of Israel by a united
[1:02:18] meeting. There the guest would do the
[1:02:21] two more things contrary to the word of
[1:02:23] God. You will recall that Bailo needed
[1:02:26] to help to keep his kingdom. He called
[1:02:29] on the most dominant spiritual figure of
[1:02:31] his day, Balum. Balum gave the advice
[1:02:34] that trapped and destroyed Israel. It
[1:02:37] was first of all suggest to suggest that
[1:02:40] they all get together and talk things
[1:02:42] over, eat together, get things ironed
[1:02:45] out. After
[1:02:47] all, understanding each other goes a
[1:02:50] long
[1:02:51] way. That's the problem. We don't
[1:02:53] understand each
[1:02:54] other. Understanding each other goes a
[1:02:57] long way. You all excuse me, my mind is
[1:02:59] running. Okay.
[1:03:01] Once you accomplish that, you can go
[1:03:03] from there. The next step would be
[1:03:05] worshiping
[1:03:07] together. And of course, a little
[1:03:09] pressure from the host usually makes the
[1:03:12] guests go a lot further than they
[1:03:14] intended. Now, that didn't only happen
[1:03:17] back there to God's church of the Old
[1:03:19] Testament, but it happened to the church
[1:03:21] of the New Testament, for there was an
[1:03:24] emperor who, like Bailo, needed help to
[1:03:26] secure his kingdom. So Constantine
[1:03:29] invited the nominal Christian first
[1:03:31] Christian church of Rome to help him get
[1:03:34] the Christians behind him as they were a
[1:03:36] very large body. The outcome was the
[1:03:39] nine council of
[1:03:41] 3:25. There the Christians both true and
[1:03:45] nominal came together at the invitation
[1:03:48] of Constantine. The true Christians had
[1:03:51] been had no business even going up to
[1:03:55] the meeting. In spite of all Constantine
[1:03:58] could do to unite them all, the real
[1:04:01] believers knew they were out of place
[1:04:04] and left. But to those who remain,
[1:04:08] Constantine gave of the state's treasury
[1:04:11] along with political and physical force.
[1:04:14] Along with political and physical force,
[1:04:16] the people were introduced to idol
[1:04:18] worship and spiritism. For the statues
[1:04:21] with names of saints were placed in the
[1:04:23] buildings, and the people were taught to
[1:04:25] commune with the dead or pray to saints,
[1:04:28] which is nothing more nor less than
[1:04:31] spiritism. For the food that man truly
[1:04:34] needs, even the word of God, they were
[1:04:36] given creeds and dogmas and the rituals
[1:04:40] which were all enforced by the state.
[1:04:43] Above all, they were given three gods
[1:04:45] with the triple compound name of one
[1:04:47] true God. water baptism in the name of
[1:04:50] the Lord. Jesus Christ gave way to the
[1:04:52] pagan baptism of three titles. The real
[1:04:55] believers ought not to have gone there.
[1:04:59] They had already lost much truth and now
[1:05:02] they too would lose the understanding of
[1:05:04] the Godhead and forfeit names for titles
[1:05:08] in water baptism. Now watch this
[1:05:11] doctrine of Balum most carefully. Notice
[1:05:14] above all that it is is it is the
[1:05:17] deliberate maneuver. I'm repeating again
[1:05:20] deliberate maneuver of corrupt clergy to
[1:05:24] bind the people to them by leading the
[1:05:26] people deliberately into the sin of
[1:05:31] unbelief. So we see it happen in the Old
[1:05:34] Testament. We see it happen under the
[1:05:37] church ages. All what I just read there
[1:05:39] is the information that we have in our
[1:05:41] church age book. Right? That's all right
[1:05:44] there. It shows the pattern. And so,
[1:05:46] Satan doesn't change. His pattern is
[1:05:48] still there. And he wants to make you
[1:05:51] through humanism develop relationships
[1:05:54] with people over humanism. Not
[1:05:55] interested. Not interested. I'm a human
[1:05:58] being. Yes. I want everybody to love me.
[1:06:00] Yes. But when I get down on my knees,
[1:06:03] ultimately Good to see you, my brother.
[1:06:06] Welcome back home. God bless you. When I
[1:06:09] get down on my knees, ultimately I am
[1:06:12] responsible to the word. So are you.
[1:06:16] Amen. And if these groups, the scripture
[1:06:18] says, as I close, let's turn to second
[1:06:22] Peter chapter 2 one more time, there
[1:06:24] were false prophets also among the
[1:06:26] people, even as there shall be false
[1:06:29] teachers among you, who privately shall
[1:06:33] bring in damnable
[1:06:36] heresies, even denying the Lord that
[1:06:39] brought them and bring them unto swift
[1:06:42] themselves to swift destruction. And
[1:06:44] what does it say in verse two?
[1:06:47] And many and many and many shall follow
[1:06:52] their pernituous ways by reason of whom
[1:06:56] the way of truth shall be evil spoken
[1:07:00] of. That's the hour that we're in. This
[1:07:03] is part of this great
[1:07:05] apostasy taking place. Many that are in
[1:07:09] the way have gone from the way. And it
[1:07:12] was be better if they were never started
[1:07:16] for the end of them is far worse than
[1:07:19] their beginning. It's very clear in the
[1:07:21] scripture. This is the teachings that
[1:07:24] you have to know. So you know how you
[1:07:26] stand as a believer. Not everybody
[1:07:29] claiming whatever they claim is for you
[1:07:31] to feed on. No, the hour's too late.
[1:07:34] It's too great. And they're going into
[1:07:36] foreign fields and you start, you know,
[1:07:38] meeting brothers and they see the the
[1:07:40] influence coming. You see the influence
[1:07:42] coming from America and these brothers
[1:07:44] have to wrestle with it. They have the
[1:07:46] same Holy Ghost and the same word and
[1:07:48] they take a stand on it. But you see
[1:07:50] these people falling for this all the
[1:07:52] time and all the groups of believers.
[1:07:55] There all kind of people privately
[1:07:57] making statements about making statement
[1:07:58] about flexing against a prophet, flexing
[1:08:00] against a preacher, flexing against the
[1:08:02] visions. It starts somewhere and it's
[1:08:05] leading to something else. But we are
[1:08:08] the beloved of God and we hold true to
[1:08:10] the word of the Lord. And I like what
[1:08:12] brother Adam says here. The last quote
[1:08:15] here, it's
[1:08:17] in the spoken word is the original seed
[1:08:21] under the pick up your pen part. He says
[1:08:24] this
[1:08:34] here
[1:08:36] paragraph number 429 in the area that I
[1:08:40] the book that I have 428 he says but
[1:08:44] thank God all Israel never all Israel
[1:08:48] never fell for Kora some stay by Moses
[1:08:52] the anointed prophet with the word of
[1:08:54] God. Same is it today with many of God's
[1:08:58] elected by his word and his spirit.
[1:09:01] Remember the terriers of weeds are to be
[1:09:04] gathered and bound in bundles. That's
[1:09:07] right. This has come to pass. This
[1:09:11] apostate organization church is bound
[1:09:14] tighter than they ever was bound. They
[1:09:17] are bundled together in the federation
[1:09:19] of churches ready for the fires of God's
[1:09:22] judgment. I never wrote this. I feel
[1:09:25] that he did it. Pentecosters are full of
[1:09:29] so-called the same as them. The wheat
[1:09:31] word will be gathered someday after they
[1:09:35] leave for the masters. Brother Badam
[1:09:38] continues on and that pick up your pen.
[1:09:42] I trust the Lord will bless you and
[1:09:45] strengthen you in these
[1:09:47] things. False teachers, the importance
[1:09:49] of true teachers, true teaching and what
[1:09:53] it does to the believer is far beyond
[1:09:55] just preaching. And if that be true with
[1:09:58] the true teacher, what does the false
[1:10:00] teaching do? It's far beyond it weakens
[1:10:04] your faith. So God bless you that our
[1:10:06] faith would be strengthened in this evil
[1:10:09] day. the way of Ba Balum, the error of
[1:10:12] Balum, and the doctrine of Balum. The
[1:10:15] scriptures point this guy out more than
[1:10:19] Pharaoh, more than any of the evil
[1:10:22] nations that rose up against Israel. He
[1:10:23] brings out Balam because Balam had a
[1:10:25] true gift, a true anointing. And for
[1:10:28] wages, he sold his gift and went in per
[1:10:32] permissive will of God so he can bind
[1:10:35] Israel. Couldn't get them by cursing
[1:10:37] them. couldn't get them by their morals
[1:10:39] or their character, but he got them to
[1:10:41] blend or mix with the Moabites. And then
[1:10:44] that's where God's curse came on them.
[1:10:46] And that pattern has repeated itself
[1:10:48] through the church ages. And what's
[1:10:50] taking place today, saints, what's
[1:10:52] taking place today, that's exactly
[1:10:53] what's taking place today. Amen. So, God
[1:10:56] bless you richly. So good to be back
[1:10:59] home with
[1:11:00] you. Let us go to the Lord in
[1:11:03] prayer. I had a few prayer requests. I
[1:11:06] think I left the note on my desk again.
[1:11:09] Sorry about that. I'll try to remember
[1:11:11] what those were. I know Sister Lori
[1:11:14] Snow. We want to keep her in prayer. And
[1:11:18] then there is this
[1:11:21] um another young lady
[1:11:24] that's married. I think she's in one of
[1:11:27] the islands there suffering um with some
[1:11:31] marital abuse. It's very dangerous. The
[1:11:34] police are involved and she needs
[1:11:36] requests. I don't have her name, but um
[1:11:39] handy with me, but we want to remember
[1:11:42] her. Cheryl Greg is her name. We'll pray
[1:11:45] for her. Very serious situation and
[1:11:49] they're asking for prayer for that. And
[1:11:53] then the sister Pasco, Sharon Pasco,
[1:11:55] what was that request? granddaughter for
[1:11:57] the granddaughter who
[1:12:00] remember her in prayer. Her
[1:12:03] granddaughter Sharon Pasco was there
[1:12:05] someone
[1:12:07] else. Yes.
[1:12:10] I don't
[1:12:18] remember about 50 pounds underweight and
[1:12:22] the Lord's
[1:12:23] really talked to him on the phone. He's
[1:12:25] doing real well. He's kept his faith in
[1:12:28] God. He's stood up for the Lord and his
[1:12:31] friends have turned their back on him
[1:12:32] and he's still maintaining. So, got a
[1:12:35] personal trainer helping him get some
[1:12:36] weight back on and he's doing real good.
[1:12:38] So, I just want to continue to pray that
[1:12:41] um you get raised up with a little bit
[1:12:44] of the message. You like know all those
[1:12:46] little brother Brown stories, the kids
[1:12:48] stories and I just pray that the Lord
[1:12:51] use that to bring him to a full
[1:12:52] revelation.
[1:12:54] Yes. Oh, thank the Lord for that. For
[1:12:57] our brethren, the Lord bringing him
[1:12:59] through that. Was there someone else
[1:13:00] that had a praise or prayer request?
[1:13:03] Yes. just a situation on the job.
[1:13:07] Situation on on your job there. I pray
[1:13:09] the Lord will bless our brother Sean.
[1:13:11] Was there someone else? Let's all stand
[1:13:13] to our feet
[1:13:16] and brother Edward. So good to have you.
[1:13:19] Good to see you. Yes, sister. Yes,
[1:13:22] brother Jim Alexander. Yes, brother Jim
[1:13:25] Alexander. Stroke. He had a stroke. I
[1:13:28] think he lost use on one side of his
[1:13:30] body or something. Fine, brother. He's a
[1:13:33] deacon. I've known him for many years.
[1:13:36] We'll pray for Brother Jim
[1:13:38] Alexander. Um the Lord will raise him up
[1:13:40] and strengthen him. But there's someone
[1:13:42] else that had a request they'd like to
[1:13:44] make known. Amen. We'll bring these
[1:13:47] requests before the Lord. Also, always
[1:13:49] pray for one
[1:13:50] another. Pray for me. I'll pray for you.
[1:13:54] pray for one another that the Lord would
[1:13:56] strengthen us in his word, fill us with
[1:13:58] the Holy Ghost, and be ready for his
[1:14:02] second coming and the rapture. Amen. So,
[1:14:05] God richly bless you. If you gain the
[1:14:08] whole world and you lose your soul, man,
[1:14:11] what a loss that would be. There's

[1:41:32] We thank you Lord for gathering us
[1:41:34] together in this place to hear from you
[1:41:37] Lord. How precious it is, Lord, and how
[1:41:41] passing everything else on this earth
[1:41:43] is. How fleeting, Lord, and how
[1:41:46] short-lived health will fail us, Lord.
[1:41:49] Our money, Lord, friends, popularity,

[1:41:55] one thing that
[1:41:56] won't, Lord, let us store up our our

[1:42:30] photo, Lord, and how you've just blessed
[1:42:32] those
[1:42:33] meetings, Lord Jesus. I just pray that
[1:42:36] you would go with each one of us, Lord.
[1:42:38] Keep us in the palm of your hand to do
[1:42:40] your will, Lord, to witness to a a
[1:42:43] stranger, Lord, and bring them in,
[1:42:46] Lord Jesus. Let us be your hands and
[1:42:49] feet at however long we're here
[1:42:51] for. That's our desire, Lord, tonight.
[1:42:54] And we just commit it to you, Lord, our
[1:42:56] way, each of our keeping, the church,
