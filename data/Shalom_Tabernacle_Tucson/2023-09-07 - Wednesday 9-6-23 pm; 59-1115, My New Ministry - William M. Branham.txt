end of the tape I think it's about 43 minutes so uh we we look forward to that states we don't we don't have to hit get to hear a tate we ain't got to hear a tape we get get to hear a tape tonight and I read this quote this past Saturday at uh up at uh in Phoenix there and brother Branham said now I'm just your brother but by the grace of God when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you and he said maybe if I offended you by saying that forgive me if I felt that might have been resented but I am God's voice to you see I said that again that time was under inspiration you see he said I felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it now see I can say nothing in myself but what he shows me I say it you believe it and watch what happens amen so we don't we're not listening to the tape uh this this evening just by happenstance I believe it's predestinated tonight for us to hear this tape this evening and hear the voice of God speak to this church can you say Amen to that tonight so God bless you all before we do that one quick announcement I put it on the board back there but uh Saturday September 23rd that morning seven o'clock that morning we'll have a men's prayer breakfast uh Saturday September 23rd we'll start right here at uh at Shalom Tabernacle and then we'll move over to the Assemblies of God church for breakfast right after that and I think also that day that evening we got another big occurrence that we got a wedding coming that day also so uh brother so we're looking forward to Saturday September 23rd is going to be a good day amen so uh but that information is back there on the bulletin board so I think that's it by way of announcements uh as we listen to the message tonight brother Branham read the scripture of Saint Mark the 11th chapter where he talked about if you say to this mountain be removed and cast in the sea and don't doubt but believe what you've said will come to pass you can have what you've said and so uh God bless you all tonight we're looking forward to finishing this message of my new ministry can we just sing only believe oh only [Music] only believe all things are possible only believe all only believe [Music] oh my only believe all things are possible only leading amen God bless you tonight it's our privilege to hear God's servant and Prophet brother Branham [Music] the first time it was ever performed on a human being I said sister Hattie ask what you will God's going to give it to you man what do you think of that does it get into you seven times he had confirmed it by an animal seven is God's complete number here's the first time on a human being and he what did he choose some great risk to crap a great noted Minister a poor little woman that can hardly write her name God knows what he's doing said ask what you will Hattie said to me brother Benham what do you mean I said ask then your heart desires and it shall be produced right here that you'll know that the Lord God Of Heaven answers and his scriptures are true her first time with a new gift but first anointing I could hardly hear and she looked around we've been talking about her little sister I said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little Edith will be jump into the glory of God had he looked around all around and she said brother Bill my greatest desire is for the Salvation of my two boys what up why there couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for ten thousand dollars she'd have got it what if they've been some millionaire would have asked for another million God no watches go to ask for Him Sister ahead of you at least a seven or eight Witnesses standing there all you people that was present and when that happened raise up your hands everybody in the building was present that happened one two three four five six seven seven of them eight of them eight of them was present when that happened I said ask anything you want to cause God's give it to me to give to you whatever you want she said her boys is beginning to go off on the teenage tantrum and she said the Salvation in my two boys I said wow the will of God follow the power of God I give you in the name of Jesus Christ your desire and her two boys shook under the power of God and that old building tremored Banks fell into his plate Shelby grab and Hattie screamed you could hear her for two blocks and them two boys with tears rolling down their cheeks received exactly what they asked him oh the first time it was ever used on a human being [Music] asked what you will and it shall be given unto you her boy's sitting there with her this morning why would she have asked what if she'd ask the healing of her little sister what I should ask then the little girl would have been healed but her two boys lost what if that poor Widow who just told me that she tried to give to this church fifty dollars on a pledge to help build a new church and brother Roberson wouldn't take it and only let her give 20 of it and I said to myself when she's speaking I'll give her back the 20 but God said to me in my heart now not my vision in my heart when Jesus was standing watching a widow putting three pennies or there was thousands of dollars laying what would you do and I said well if I've been standing up said we don't need it sister we got plenty of money but Jesus never said it he let her go on and do it because he know what was down the road so help me God is by Solomon judge God knew that was down the road for her I run my hand in my pocket to get my pocketbook to give her her twenty dollars Bank say sister Hattie but he said don't do it then a few minutes from the questions part about Jehovah Jireh she said that's nothing but the truth and it comes from a poor widow woman's heart God knowing she'd asked the greatest thing could be done as long as there is the heaven when the stars is gone when there's no more moon no more Earth no more sea them boys shall live on through eternity with the same Jehovah Jireh who gave the immortal promise his promises cannot fail looking forward for the coming of this meeting down here in San Jose oh if it'll just break forth now when the anointing strikes s what you will I have a perfect assurance that will not strikes and whatever God puts to be asked it'll be just exactly that way it has to be or if you say to this man I see it isn't you speaking it isn't you it's God it's you so so submitted to God now watch the prophets of old when we're closing the prophets of old one day we're seeing the coming of the Lord Jesus they were so in the spirit until they spoke as if it was themselves look at David in the Psalms 22nd Psalm crying my God my God why has Thou forsaken me not David it was Christ 800 years later all my bones stare at me they shoot out their lips at me they wiped their heads said he saved others but himself he cannot say David speaking that as if it was himself but it was the spirit of God and he Christ speaking forth oh God be praised moving into his church in the fullness of his power moving among his people spreading out his great wings of Mercy may he be praised I haven't time for my sermon let us bow our heads just a moment is there one here this morning or how many of them is here that knows that you're not prepared this time to meet God would you raise your hands and say pray for me brother Branham we can't bring you to the older cause the Alders are packed God bless you brother you sister you brother you you back there all around you young lady you my brother way back in the back all around God sees your hands if he can bring a ram into existence when there is no Ram if he can bring animals into existence if he's concerned about a little fig tree growing on the side of the hill or a little dead fish laying in the water how much more does he know your desire and your sure he does he knows that you need him ask then you shall receive When you pray believe that you receive what you ask for was that the holy spirit that raised your hand if it was then the anointing's on you then pray and believe God and you shall have what you've said Heavenly Father as this day is growing near to the midday and I've been at length here this morning on this story of our divine grace according to your word it is written in the scriptures that Jesus our lord said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also and we know that those works are true you could discern the thoughts of the people you told Peter who he was what his name was what his father was you told Philip when he brought Nathaniel or told Nathanael rather that you saw him under the tree before he come you told the woman at the well how many husbands she had oh there is nothing hidden from you you knew all things and that was your works then we see you say to that fig tree oh Lord I believe the hour is soon coming that when the Loaves and Fishes will be multiplied there come a mark of the beast soon there'll come a confederation of churches and they'll put out a sign that a unionized church that no man can buy or sell and your church it won't bother to him for your Holy Spirit shall lead them and feed them as you did Israel in the wilderness you are God don't let us miss that Lord let us remain Faithfully let us be true now I don't know just when this will take place again Lord maybe this morning again maybe it'll happen again in the Tabernacle today trusting that it will Lord trusting at your faith in the people's hearts and know that I haven't misled or said one thing wrong I've said it just the way it come to the best that I know in my heart Lord watching my words and weighing them knowing that you have confirmed that to me as I have said seven times and knowing immediately after that on the first human being I ever spoke to she got the desire of her heart the moment she spoke now Lord there's many Desires in here this morning you'll have to anoint your servant Lord if you'll just send the anointing let me have it this morning if anyone should lead you just speak it to me Lord one day speaker whenever whoever you wish and let it come to pass and I know that what's said then it'll not be me it will be you Lord speaking I'll submit myself to you and before I leave from this ministry the old type of the visions and so forth at this altar where I dedicated My Life Anew from preaching the gospel to signs and wonders I dedicate myself again this morning to you Lord for service the first time this has been told The First Time Lord that's been manifested here sets of witnesses oh Lord God if there is anything you can use this old Hall of mine far I am yours Lord take me and mold me and fashion me and do something Lord that'll honor and glorify thee spread it out amongst other ministers send it to the four corners of the world the hours are getting late Jesus is coming bless your people together Save The Lost everyone that raised their hands here this morning save them Lord give them the Holy Spirit May their lives be dedicated to you this little church Lord the pastor I never Pastor here ever abandon's teacher every member of any other Church oh God as a body of people we give ourselves to you take us and use us Lord we are yours and expect them to come to you someday in peace now if there be any sick or afflicted may they be healed this morning may thy Grace and eternal blessings rest upon them as we pray for them by laying our hands upon them and praying May the Holy Ghost come and perform the work that he's ordained to be done granted father through Jesus Christ we ask this blessing amen amen I have told you the honest truth just this God has revealed it it has did it I have honestly told you the truth and now I am earnestly seeking and Desiring your prayers I realize that a man of my age 50 years old the other morning I said to the wife I'm already 50 honey if I do anything for the Lord I got to hurry she said bill God trained Moses 80 years and said he can train you for another 50 years to get one day service from you he's got a purpose for you so just stand still awful there's a lot of wisdom stand still God moves every hand just according to his great plan amen just be still don't try to over to try to push you get ahead of him man it's a whole lot better to try to follow than it is to lead because he's the leader now to my little church here my little flock that's been so faithful and it's prayed for me all out across the world I believe there's another worldwide shakening coming these things I have told you is the truth at the day of the Judgment I'll face you Yonder with the same story just as true as I'm standing here now I'm sure you all could see what it is it's a coming of a greater deeper anointing of the Holy Spirit how to get into it I don't know only thing I know it takes God to put you into it so you just live as sweet and humble and close to God as you can don't doubt him just believe that everything's working just to the good for you and everything will work around all right see just remember you are a sheep he is the dove and the dove leads the lamb when and the lamb and the dove has the same nature the dove is the most generous of all the birds of the heaven a lamb is the most generous of all the beasts of the earth so see their Spirits would coincides with one another now the dove cannot come on a wolf see it wouldn't stay there the wolf is a killer the lamb is gentle so you see it's the lamb and the Dove and one leading the other and you see where the dove led the lamb to all the way to Calvary for crucifixion and he opened not his mouth when they spit on him he never spit back when they smacked him he never smacked back he just went right on knowing that he was for the glory of God he was doing the will of God sister Hattie we're close to around the same age brother George Wright their dad her boy's mother Shelby I want to say this I guess you wonder why I got up and walked out of the house as quick as I did I have never I've been worth 30 000 raw heathens was saved at one time South Africa come to Christ I thought that was the greatest anointing I ever felt it never knows compared with that down to George riots the other day I have never felt anything like that the whole room just seemed to be just a light of the glory of God our sister ahead is very quiet and Pious little woman never raises her voice about anything but you could have heard her scream a city block when the Holy Spirit struck the building everybody everybody there felt it it was wonderful we may live a long time but sister had it as long as there is a memory in our mind we'll remember that from Sister ride now that the people might know that I told that just exactly true would you raise up your hand sister had his sword sister right and you always there just was there just so as you can see see there they are here stand up Sister Hattie there's a little widow woman that the miracle happened on the first bypassing all the peoples of the world for that thing to happen first to that poor little humble widow woman up on the hillside up there trying to raise a crop of corn out of a crawfish ground out there to take care of her children that's the one that God honored the first time since the days of the of Jesus Christ and said ask what you will I said uh challenge anybody in the name of the Lord when that Spirit strikes and says that I don't care what you ask for it shall be granted you know why the plutocrats didn't get it are there big folks like that it's because God knows that ass things that was no good for them he gives it to people who he knows will ask the right thing and what more could that woman what more is tell me anything she could ask greater than that her mother and father saved her little sisters saved all the families saved except the two boys at that time they wasn't saved they're poor people Shelby told me his constant income for a good crop he netted 600 a year work and tell the boys about my agent is all broke down everything and is working take care of his daddy and mother and they're old and try and take care of his little Afflicted sister but he's saved brother right all of them saved but them too was not saying and had he asked the salvation of her children as long as there's an eternity she could have asked for ten thousand dollars and I got it she could ask whatever she would but God knows what you're going to ask before he ever places then haunting that's right sister Hattie is it right that I said ask anything that you wish anything your heart desires asked it Hattie is that right sister Hattie ask anything you want to it makes no difference what it is ask that God has said to me just speak what she's asked for and she'll have it he said ask it now just anything you desire and she didn't oh brother sister do you realize that they were living here the most glorious when God of heaven will put amongst human beings that ask anything you will he'll give it to you it's it's too deep for my mind I know that but I hope that my heart can contain as much of it as I can it's just I have lived on it I have thrived on it I'm going Westward on and I'm entering meetings on it I'm living on it God's words is right as far as I know that's the last thing to happen I don't know nothing else but it could be just to give to human beings as anything that you desire no matter what it is just ask it and it'll be given to you and could you see the wisdom how many beliefs of that woman asked the greatest thing could be yes let's see could you imagine a woman with a Afflicted sister could uh ask for her eating a woman is poor and Her Mother and Daddy poor and all of them poor could have asked for money and got it she could have asked for years added to her life and got it but she asked the greatest thing it could be yes the salvation of her unsaved family and got it amen that's the main thing got it for the same God to give the promise [Music] God oh how I love him now we're going is there any sick here to be prayed for raise up your hands a woman called a few nights ago this tree of I believe from California or something you told me that said we've come two or three times and you give out prayer cards and our numbers are not called I made her promise if she'd stay over that I just pray for the sick this morning comment has been in year one we've had the discernments and things all of you I suppose everybody here see we know that's true we're moving beyond that now oh praise be to God we're moving beyond that now maybe it will come to pass I don't know what God will do this morning but you people that are sick and Afflicted I'm going to ask you just to come a few at a time let these on this side here come up so we can pray for these on this side first maybe I can catch it like that come right up here sister this line right up here because we haven't got you have to send them back down the same aisle I'm going to count of them they're getting back uh I could tell the way this little fella talked this morning he breathed in Divine Healing I know it brings the power of God um is there another Minister here this morning at the uh Minister who believes that God heals the sick if there is let him come up here each life well he only come here same with us why we pray for these these sick and flicking any of you brother not believe that God heals the savior with us now we do not know what the Holy Spirit may do the Holy Spirit May at this time performed just like you did down at sister writes the other day our trust that he will I don't know you understand how many no wealth is not many of you left here when the Visions first started I don't know what time they'll come what they'll do everything is in the will of God and has to be controlled by God how many knows that God could not give man things to control themselves if they did then you see it wouldn't be gone it wouldn't be God it would be I want you to think here friends in this little lowly place but how the Lord has absolutely brother Mike Beyond any Shadow of Doubt has blessed us and performed and done just exactly what he promised you to do how many ever heard of superstition perception many of you hazards it says no but mythology spiritualism but you know they can't damn things are not lasting they don't hold on they can never get any material they'll sit down there and have they say there's a spirit there's a spirit and they're trying to take a picture of something they can't do it see it's just it's not there it's psyche mental but what God does is perfect when Moses sewed down his rod the magician throw down his Rod to this both heard of serpents is that right but what happened to Jamison Jammer's Rod Moses Rod swore it up and when Moses picked up his Rod it was still around but where was there on inside the rod of Moses see you couldn't see it when God does anything he makes it real now they tell me the Holy Spirit you know they say that's people just worked up it's mental them visions and things that's just the mental telepathy well when George J lace examined that picture there when that angel of the Lord many of you stand your scene on the river many times he said brother Branham the mechanical out of this camera don't take psychology so the light was there it is it's Everlasting it's true so you see it's the same angel of God now watch it the nature of it proves it when he was here on Earth it was dwelt in the Lord Jesus Christ who was God made manifest and now Jesus said a little while the world won't see me anymore yet you have seen me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and the things that you do that I do shall you also now watch it when it comes a man can say anything but when God facts it up that makes the truth now what's the nature of that angel when he gets the person so submitted to him he does the same thing that Jesus did when he was here on Earth man because we are Sons and Daughters of God if we're born of his spirit see an angle mythical thing it's got evidence to prove it it shows that it's right so our Salvation is absolutely perfect the god of Heaven who had all the prophets to speak of the coming of the Lord Jesus and Jesus when he come he fulfilled every prophecy many of us fulfill at the cross wounded for our transgressions and what David said my God is Thou forsaken me but when God sends a prophet a prophet speaks God makes that truth if it's God that's where he said to know him if they spoke him up he said come to pass then believe him or I'm with him if it doesn't then either they're not they're false prophets he said but to mark them see where they come to pass now look if God who spoke in the holy prophet talked about the coming of the Messiah to the glory and honor of God if I know who would be president next fall in intelligence that would be prophecy that's right but God doesn't prophesy like that just to or just to be playing God does something to glorify him see but when the Messiah comes and when the Messiah left I want to ask all you methodists Baptist Presbyterian Catholic Lutheran Pentecostal Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness all of you I want to ask you something don't you think that that King of the prophets Jesus would have known how to set up his own church if all the prophets spoke of him and pointed to him what kind of church did he set up when he left he said when he was sure on Earth he told Peter on the revelation of the word of God he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it isn't that right all right when he was before he left in Mark 16 he said these signs shall follow them that believe did he say it in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues pick up serpents drink anything he also said the works that I do shall you do also is that right that's the signs that's to follow his church it's not a denomination it's a setup organization ordained of God Holy Ghost still heaven born church that comes out of all denominations a real believing bunch of people these ministers standing here are just along with me we're a man he's gone but we're here to represent him we're here to tell you that we God has sent us to do this work to lay Hands-On mistake these signs shall follow them them signs all signs that he spoke of will follow a Believer here they are following they fall in God is not going to respect the person what he did for Hattie he'll do for you what he did for the blind he'll do for you blind what he does for the death he'll do for you anything that he's done for anybody else he'll do for you if you will only believe is that right now brother Teddy I want you to play only believe and these people pass through the line then we'll get the other side we're going to come through all of us laying hands on you praying for you that your diseases will be cured and it can it'll be and I don't know what God's going to do I'm just standing here right now not knowing what to do I'm just going to pray for the sick like I promise somebody that I do just pray for the last Sunday remember I told you last Sunday was the was it Revelations and so forth this Sunday I pray for the sake let us pray now Lord we stand here as your servants we stand before your people we're here we don't know what you'll do you might speak with tongues you might interpret you might give a vision you might cause me to take someone's hand for a revelation you might speak and give the authority to say whatever you will I don't know what you're going to do Lord and maybe you want to lay hands on the stick we don't know what it is we're just wanting to please you Lord we're standing here as your servants and these are your people and we're trying to help them according to what your word says to you we're trying to follow your instructions and I pray thee Lord that you'll give to us that what we have need to minister to the people through Jesus Christ's name amen I want all the rest of you keep your head down and pray while brother Woods if you'll Minister Brothers I believe we stand right here how many is four other years or two on each side there and I'll stand right at the head of the line right here [Music] come over here brother dear I I said stand right along there now and if they pass by all congregations [Music] now every one of you not only administers but all of these all to pray for these people you don't know what God might do for you while you're praying for somebody else what if you say the right thing what if there's a woman standing here that's uh so sick they have to hold her up I wonder if your prayer would be the right thing for his life thanks to the right thing like Hattie said the right thing what if you'd say the right thing your parents cop to come down and do something see this is just not one person this is the Church of God everybody else [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] we're going to his chicken in different places and may they eat less father through

meetings thank you my brother the Lord bless you isn't this like heaven when you think of preaching the gospel and souls raising your hands to Christ sick and Afflicted passing through the line baptismal Services Fellowship Brotherhood that's just just a little bit in heaven drop down on Earth you know we I feel like what the Apostle said that time it is good for us to be here if we could we don't need but one Tabernacle but uh we love to be here for the service of God I each of you people that come through the line this morning was prayed for just remember that the same God that granted all these things that you have heard done around the country and they are truth just as true as they can be and all these ministers share what's been done in their Ministry what's been done in the ministry the Lord has given me we have stood here with sincerity with all of our hearts praying laying hands on you just exactly what Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover now it's just there's only one thing to keep it from not happening that would be for you to disbelieve it Jesus said come unto me all your labor and heavy laden I'll give you rest whosoever will let him come now there's only one way for you to miss it God's word is true one way for you to miss it is not come isn't that right that's a way for you to miss it God said these signs shall follow them and believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover there's only one way for you to miss it that's disbelieving if you'll believe God's word God will keep his word you see to that would be that's the first initial that's the way to pray for the sake pass them through lay hands on them or naunt them or anything that God said we but after all of that for God to let you know that he's in the midst of his people he shows signs and wonders and see it's a wonders and miracles of the Living God to do the things that he does do he's wonderful don't you think so now the Brethren are making ready in therefore the the baptismal service and it'll just be quickly and now those are to be baptized the women go to the room is that right the women over there the women over here and the man on this side while we're making ready for baptism service I want to read a scripture in the next few minutes and we'll be I know some of your limbs are bound to be hurting from standing up and if you can't stand just a few moments longer you'll see a beautiful sight when you see the the immersing of these people I want to read some scriptures now found in the book of Acts the second chapter while they're making ready for the baptism I think there's only about two or three to be baptized it won't take but just a moment and I want you to listen close now I'm going to begin reading I'll Acts 2 the 28th verse beginning reading thou has made known unto me the way of life the ways of life it's in the plural thou shall make me full of joy and with thy accountances man and Brethren let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and his Sepulcher is with us to this day therefore being a prophet how many know David was a prophet is a psalmist and prophet therefore being a prophet and the knowledge that God had sworn with an oath to him that all the fruits of his Lawrence according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither did his flesh see corruption this Jesus has God raised up War for we are all Witnesses doesn't that sound like today we Are Witnesses of these things I could say this morning Hattie the rest of you we're Witnesses of these things therefore being at the right hand of God exalted having received to the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear for David is not ascended into heaven but he said himself the Lord said unto my Lord set thou on my right hand remember last Sunday how we spoke of the prophets all them great men how they had to die but one come the Royal seed set thou own my right hand until I make thy foes thy footstool therefore let all the house of Israel know surely that God has made this same Jesus who you crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this that Jesus is both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles man and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise isn't to you and to your children and to them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this on toward generation and they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day that were added to them about three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and in the fellowship and breaking of bread and with prayers and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believe were gathered together and had all things in common sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and they continually daily with one Accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and sangliness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved now just the father coming to the water you let me know when it's George the water um that you might know that Sovereign Grace that reigns with God I want to go back I just can't help from placing something else in did you know those two boys that woman's children that were saved God knew that before the foundation of the world and their names were actually put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the Bible says that and it only had to work to this minute did you know God knew that we'd be standing here 10 million years before the world was ever founded you know he knew we'd be standing here this morning the infancy of God no one ever fly ever not every time that Dr Oz Tower they would produce before the world was ever formed God knew it now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching that's God a part of God's program preaching is his program why do you look up all the apostles he looked upon the heart he said the Harvest is right and the labors are viewed pray the Lord the Harvest that he will send labors into his harness how many remember that well why would they have to pray to the Lord of harvest to send labors into his harness if we are the Harvest of standing there is only it could be done why God Is So arranging that his I'll listen to this God has sore reasons that his program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God needs us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves about anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are in God's will doing his program oh as soon as I return from California the Lord's willing what the grand Tabernacle needs is a Revival raise your Revival and the filling of the Holy Ghost yeah and that's the great need of the Tabernacle some defies keeping the world come to you but what we need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I feel it then tell us and the city who return back if the Lord's willing we're going to have a Revival for that very purpose that's the remembrance of this to happen other people who are seeking the Holy Ghost might come in within instructions and everything I have ground meetings in here to repeat the Holy Ghost that's the church might get back into the will of God and move on with the program of God as it moved on the Lord bless you I'll be there ready
