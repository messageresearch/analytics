Oh Lord, I surrender my life. Oh, I give it all to you. Amen. I'm amazed that you love me, Lord. I'm amazed. Let's start with a verse. Sister Joy, no one knew. No one knew how alone I was feeling. And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Though I laughed and said my life was fine without you. I was covering up the secret tears. I cried. Then one day someone told me of your mercy and the love you showed on a hill called Calary. And there you purchased my redemption. when you broke his power and set my spirit free. I'm amazed that you love me. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed that you gave me through your preious blood. I found pardon. All my saints are washed there. All washed away. All my saint are washed away. Let's stand and sing a second verse. Is it true? There have been days when I failed you. Lord, you know the many times I've gone astray, but I love my weakness. &gt;&gt; And your ear is open every time I pray. No one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. Other friends could never be as close. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. Knowing you are everything I'll ever need. I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed that you care. Through your preious blood, I found pardon. All my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. Yes, it's true. Yes, it's true. Time has failed you. But I learned that your love is stronger than my weakness. And your ear is open every time I pray. No one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. other friends could never be as close to me. I'm not afraid to make of tomorrow, knowing you are everything I'll ever need. I'm amazed that you love me. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed that you came through your preious blood and my sorrow. You're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. How many can thank the Lord for that? Amen. I'm amazed that you love me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord Jesus Christ for his love towards us. Amen. We'd like to welcome each of you to the house of the Lord tonight as we prepare to go into the word in Ephesians chapter 1. Uh we'll be finishing up the adoption number four um that brother Brandon preached. I know it'll be a blessing to each and every one of us tonight. Amen. Thank the Lord for his presence that we can feel among us. And we just pray that the Lord Jesus will give us more of his grace and mercy &gt;&gt; through the preaching of his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 1 verse number nine. having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. that we should be to his praise of that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ whom and whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise &gt;&gt; which is the earnest of our inheritance hence until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. And so, Brother Random kind of finishes up what this um what this purchase is and what this down payment is, the earnest. He talks about that a little bit tonight and we look forward to that and he'll close the meeting off. So, let's prepare to go there and sing only believe all things are possible. Amen. Only believe. Only believe that all things are possible. Holy, holy, we all things are possible. Holy Lord, I believe. I believe. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And all things are possible. I believe I believe all things are possible Lord I will bless you may be seated brother Brandham &gt;&gt; I'll hurry And then we're close cuz it's late and we pray for the sake. About five more minutes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; 14th verse. Reasonably read the 13th over. Get it background. In whom you trusted after that you heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation. Now remember what salvation they have. These were these were Ephesians Christians. They Now look, did you notice the Corinthians? He always had to tell them when I come among you, one has a tongue, one has a tongue, one has a psalm, one has a prophecy, one has See, he couldn't teach them nothing. Cause was always desiring this, that, or the other. These people had the same thing, but they had it in order. &gt;&gt; He never taught the Corinthians nothing like this. He couldn't. The church was in order to teach it. Now, he could teach these people a real thing. What's your salvation? In whom also after you believe, you receive what the Holy Spirit have promised, which is the earnest. Oh, let me not pass that. The earnest of our inheritance until redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory. What is the Holy Ghost? Now, then I'll read the rest of it real fast if you'll bear with me. this much. Where was we at the other night, brother Mike? Whether we're all happy. Oh, everything was peace. That was perfect love. Now, every time you come this way, you drop down a little. Drop. Every time you make a step, you come inches closer. When it gets down to the earth, you got a shadow of the shadow of the shadow of shadows. Now, that's how much Holy Spirit you got in you. That's love. But oh, you thirst for something. Oh, would not people like uh old old people. How would I like to go back and be 15 again? 20. Oh, I'd give anything. What good would it do me? I might be 15 and die yet tonight. It's uncertain. Well, if he was 15 tonight, how you know where the mother be living got home or not? How you know you're going to get home? How do you know you're going to be living tomorrow if you're 12 years old? Perfect health. You may be killed in an accident, dropped dead. Anything might happen to you. Uncertainty. There's nothing here certain. But you long for that. What is it? It's that up there making you long for it. Now you walk into this, then you have eternal life. Now what does it happen? It is the earnest. What is the earnest money on anything? If I come to you to buy a car, I say, "How much is that car?" You say, "This car, Brother Brown, cost you $3,000. What's the down payment?" "Well, I let you have it for $500." "All right, here's the $500. I'll I'll bring the rest of it to you sometime soon as I can. You hold a car. I'll give you $500. That's the earnest. Is that right? I hold that. It's the earnest. It's the down payment. After you were sealed by the spirit of promise. The spirit of promise. After you were sealed, which is what? What is this seal of promise? The Holy Spirit promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until redemption of the purchase possession. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; It's the down payment. And brother, &gt;&gt; if this is the down payment, &gt;&gt; what's it going to do? &gt;&gt; What is it going to be? If this is the if this what we enjoy now and get a happy I've seen man 90 years old just could not I seen an old preacher that raised out one night I said like this come out on platform and I said that old man go to preach and he said well bless the Lord no colored fellow great big old long preachers co on I said why didn't they let some of young preachers preach that old man how can he ever preach he said well he said bre and he said the day I've been hearing the brothers preach all day long he said about what Jesus done on earth I'm going to tell what he done to heaven. He said, "I'll take my text tonight from Job 7:27 said when way back down kind of before the foundation the world said when he said the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy like that said you know listen what something went on back then he said you know and he be to bring on what taking place in heaven brought him down the horizontal rainbow and the second coming about that time the Holy Ghost struck him now they had to lead the old fell out he was around 95 years old he's just like this all bent over and loose a little rim of hair you know like He got out there and he started preaching that peace. Hallelujah. Glory. Got the jump up down like that. Oh, you ain't got enough room. Your feet preach like that hard as he go. &gt;&gt; And that's just the earnest. &gt;&gt; Oh, what does the Holy Spirit do? Oh, here's a good place. Let me read the first verse of the next chapter. Can I? Is it all right? Say amen. All right. The first verse of the second chapter quickly listen. You who were you and you has he quickened who were one were dead in trespasses and sins. &gt;&gt; You has he quickened. What does quicken mean? &gt;&gt; Made a lie. &gt;&gt; Just about gone. But he quickened you just by the earnest money. What will it be when you when you really get all the dividends available? Oh, no wonder Paul caught up into the third heaven said, "Eye has not seen, ear has not heard, neither has it entered the heart of man what God has for them in store that love him." &gt;&gt; What will that be? You talk about joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were once dead in sin and trespasses has he quickened together by the shadow of the shadow of the shadows. &gt;&gt; What's it going to be when you come through the shadow of the shadows into the shadow? The shadow then into the creek. The creek into the river. The river into the ocean. And what is it when you're way out there in redemption with a brand new body? You turn back to a young man alltogether again or a young woman. You'll never go to die no more. And you look down on earth and think, I could enjoy some grapes and some good cold water, but you know, I don't need it here, but someday Jesus is coming. And this angelic body, this theophony that I'm living in will not come through the womb of a woman anymore. It'll not come through sexual desire anymore. But because that he was born without sexual desire, I'll be resurrected without it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will speak someday and the dead in Christ shall rise. And that body that I once lived in will resurrect into a glorified body. And I'll walk and I'll talk and I'll live and I'll enjoy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is to come through Jesus Christ our Lord. &gt;&gt; There you are, brother. That's the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wherefore I also Paul's just telling now what he is. I'll read the rest of this and then we pray for the sake of until the possession. This is an earnest until the possession unto the praises of his glory. Wherefore I also after I heard of your faith, I heard that you believe this stuff. I heard that you really believe in predestination, eternal life, and salvation and so forth in the Lord Jesus and love unto all saints. cease not to give thanks to you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation, knowledge of him, just keep revealing himself to you all the time, growing from grace unto grace, from power unto power, glory unto glory, not fall back, but from glory under glory. Before we keep moving on, I'll keep praying for you. The eye uh the eyes of your understanding. You know, when the Bible said you were blind and didn't know it, but here Paul said, "I'm going to pray that your eyes of understanding, you understand with your heart." That's what he's talking about. You look with your eye, but you see with your heart. &gt;&gt; You know that. All right. that the God of glory. Let's see that the 18th verse. The eyes of your understanding be it enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of the calling and what the riches of glory of his in inheritance in the saints. And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward? They say the power is gone. The power hasn't even arrived yet. &gt;&gt; Who believed according to the working of his mighty power. &gt;&gt; You who have believed to the working of his mighty power. I just pray that God will just pour out his power upon you. See, &gt;&gt; which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above principalities, powers, might, dominion, and that every name that is named Oh, &gt;&gt; for no, I better not. We could sure take the rest tonight on that. &gt;&gt; Every name that is named not only in this world but in the world to come. &gt;&gt; What is every what'sever name ever name of every person will bear the name of what? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; The whole heaven's name Jesus. &gt;&gt; The whole church is named Jesus. &gt;&gt; Everything is named Jesus. For it's the only name that God ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's called Jehovah. Jehovah Gyra, the Lord's provided sacrifice. Jehovah Rapi, the Lord that health thee, Jehovah, Lord's banner, Manasses, Jehovah different Jehovah. He's called the morning star. He's called Father. He's called Son. He's called Holy Ghost. He's called Alpha. He's called Omega. He's called beginning. He's called the ending. He's called the branch. Oh, he's called Jesus called all kinds of titles. But he had one name. &gt;&gt; That's what Matthew was talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Go ye therefore and teach all of baptizing them in the name." &gt;&gt; Not in names. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Father's not a name. &gt;&gt; Son's not a name. Holy Ghost is not a name. It's a title to a name. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's a name of three attributes that belongs to one God. &gt;&gt; What was his name? The angel said, "Thou shalt call his name &gt;&gt; for he shall save his people from their sins." &gt;&gt; That's the reason they all baptized that way in the Bible. That's how St. Augustine baptized the king of England about about 150 200 years after the death of Christ in the name of Jesus Christ. All right. for above principalities, powers, might, dominion, that that every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which is to come, and has put all things under his feet, and has given him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body. Now, if my body has a power over all things, then what my body is is what I am. Is that right? That's what I am. That's what you know me as. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Well, then all that God was, he poured into Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all that Jesus was, he poured into the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; These things that I do shall you do all things also. Even greater than this shall you do. &gt;&gt; For I go to the Father, which is his body, the fullness of him that fillth all in all. Oh, how I love that. &gt;&gt; How I love that. Yes. &gt;&gt; I was reading the other day a book that was wrote about a trip I went to minister in Africa. Never did read it before. How many ever read the book Prophet Visits Africa? In there, I was looking at a little Indian boy. How many seen that picture? I heard a certain evangelist been praying for the sick for about 15 years or more. He said, "I never seen a miracle performed in my life." He said, "I've seen people that said they had headaches, got well. I've seen people say they had tummy ache, got well, and so forth. But a miracle, something that created and made something. I thought that boy already been standing there and seen that. That Indian boy's leg was just about this big around one of them. The other was a normal leg like a human being's leg. And if you notice his brace, there was his shoe about 14 in or 15 in high like this. He had an iron plate on the bottom of it. His shoe set up on top of two long standers that stood. He walked up to where I was standing. They brought him up there. He had two crutches. He took this big arm, shoot him, chomped it down like that. I looked at his leg. He's about that big around. Now them people are Mohamad. Mohamadins. Did you remember last Sunday when I read you what the papers had to write? I've got it right here myself from Africa sent to me by our returned missionary brother Stricker. There's the article how Billy Graham backed up on it. Exactly that. The Mohammad push him right into the sea. What's the matter? The missionaries are leaving the field. What used to stand any longer? They're just whipped. I love Billy Grim and think he's a wonderful man of God. But what Billy Grim ought to have charged him with said, "Wait a minute. If some of these self-starch Baptists would have let him do it, I believe he would have done it. I believe Billy Grim's a man of God. But if he'd said, "Wait a minute. I'm a minister of the gospel. You believe in the Old Testament and you said that Jesus wasn't nothing but a man. I challenge you on a debate. I don't believe you taking the devil's challenges. No sir. But I have challenged him back and said, "Let you and I come together. I'm a doctor of divinity. Billy Grim is a doctor of divinity. Let me u challenge you on this and let me prove to you that Jesus was the Christ." Now, when it comes to divine healing, I don't possess those gifts, but we've got some brothers that does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to bring them people out there, let me just call one of them or Roberts or somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody that has a great ministry that would really get there, come over there and and see what take place. Say, "Christianity is not what you think it is." Now, everybody feels let down because he just walked off and left him. Of course, now I don't believe in the devil giving you a challenge. I've spitten his face too like that and walked away from him. That's right. But when it comes to a place where Billy could have could have made that Mohamad feel like a little weed like that, &gt;&gt; he could have took that Bible and took Isaiah 9 and6 and said, "Who was he talking about? Unto us a child is born. To us a son is given." Who was this man? Who was he was talking about? Who was this prophet? Who was this Messiah that was to come? Show me where he produced himself in Muhammad. He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity, chasted our peace upon him with his stripes, we were healed. Show it to me in Muhammad. How did he cry, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me that pierced my hands and my feet and so forth. Show me by your own word, your own testament. Why he had beat that Muhammad so bad that he wouldn't know where he was at? That's right. But when the paper had to turn around, that's what hurt what made my heart jump. When said there though Billy had to back up and made a backup, how can the Muhammad say that it was wrong said when Reverend William Brandham at Durban South Africa on undisputed miracle after miracle when 10,000 Mohamads fell on their face at one time and surrendered their life to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. They know about it. &gt;&gt; Them fundamentals know about it. Don't you tell me. One time this one come to Jesus said, "Rabbi," you know, he was a Pharisee. He said, "We know your teacher come from God." We know it. &gt;&gt; We know it because no man could do the things you do except God be with him. &gt;&gt; We understand it. We know it, but we just can't confess it. See, cuz if we do, well, we will put out of our church. See, we'll lose our prestige. And so Jesus said began to tell him, "You must be born again." On that Mohamadan boy when he was standing there, there's his picture. The camera won't take a line. There he's standing there, one leg that much shorter about 14 inches than the other one, standing on that iron shoe. Said to him, I said, "Do you speak English?" "No, sir." Couldn't speak English. The interpreter said he don't speak English. "How long you been that way?" The interpreter asked him, "Since birth, can you move the leg at all?" "No, sir." "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" He said, "I'm a Mohamadan." I said, "Will you accept Jesus Christ if he'll make you well?" I will accept Jesus Christ as my savior. He make me well. If he'll make that well, that leg come like the other. You'll accept him. I will. Oh, God. What will you do? This is the next thing. All questions are answered. Brother Mike got the feeling. &gt;&gt; I waited just a minute to see what he was going to say. I looked over and seen the boy going walking along like side of the walls like that. I said, "How many of you Muhammads will accept it?" Here's a Muhammad and the boy. Look at him. Stand him up there. I said, "You doctors, you want to look at him?" There he stands. Oh, you know where you're at, Dan. You know where you're standing. &gt;&gt; Nobody. There he was. I said, "Walk across this way, son." And they got him. Here it comes. Shalom. Shalom. I said, "Look like about 12, 14 inches short." &gt;&gt; Like that. Yeah. Thousands of those black hands went up out there through like that. But Lord, now's the time. I said, "Heavenly Father, if you ever answered, answer me now. This is for your glory. This is for you. &gt;&gt; I pray you make this boy well." I just prayed over him. I said, "Take off your shoe." He looked at me real funny interpreter. I said, "Take off your shoe." He unlen vision what was going to happen. He took off that thing. When he tucked it back, walked over there to me. Both legs just as normal as both of them walking like this. I said, "You want to walk back and forth?" He started crying &gt;&gt; like that. Going back and forth. He didn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; Walking like that. He said, "Oh, I said, "Jesus, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Jesus." And Jesus, Jesus. I got I said, "Is there any questions? Any questions?" Julius Stadcliffe. time knows he brother stats please come here at the church just just went to Germany &gt;&gt; said just a minute brother Brand just a minute so bring a photographer can I get his picture I said walker stand your shoe here you stood like that took the picture of the boy there's both legs just his arm and straight they could be there his old shoe embraced like that like that I said how many of you Muhamadans now reject Muhammad his prophet and believe Jesus to be the son of God and accept him as your personal savior 10,000 Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They don't want to. &gt;&gt; They try to keep it back because we're holy rollers. He call us. You see, just the same God's a moving &gt;&gt; placing his church. He's doing it exceedingly abundantly above all that we could even do or think. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's just as much God tonight as he ever was. So little friends, let me tell you something right now. My darling precious people, you here in this land and the others in tape lands which will be overseas and wherever you are. Don't be afraid. Everything's all right. Father God before the foundation of the world knew everything that would happen. Everything works right along. You love him. Keep your heart right. And remember, when this breath passes from this life to you old people or to you young people and you mothers, when you see your little babies, that little girl baby died when she wasn't 8 days old or 5 days old. She'll be a beautiful young woman when you see her. &gt;&gt; That old grandpa was all so stoked over he couldn't hardly see where he was going. When you seen grandmother, he'll be a fine, handsome young man, just as young as about 20 years old, just in a splendor of youth. And he'll be that way forever. &gt;&gt; You can touch his hand. You can shake hands with him. You'll throw your arms around him. But he won't be hubby. He'll be brother. Oh, &gt;&gt; he'll be so much greater than hubby. You think you loved him? Sure you did. But that was Felio. Wait till you get a goppel. Wait till that real divine love catches and name on him. This year this is like an old smoldering dump. It's no good. There's nothing to it. Only thing I advise you to do now is this. My my my friends. &gt;&gt; A little later on, I would you like for me to pick up them other two chapters sometime? Lord, I I got to rest just a little before talk. Now, I can't preach these things in that meeting. It's too many too many different beliefs. See, this is just church alone. See, I can't preach. I got a right to preach in here whatever I want to. This is my tabernacle. And I'm telling you now, I believe that people are saved. Yes, sir. I truly believe. But oh, how much more it is to walk when you know where you're walking. &gt;&gt; How much know is to know what you're doing. You see, instead of staggering, stumbling along, let's just stand right up in the light and walk in the light. Know which way you're headed. &gt;&gt; That's true. The Lord be with you. And if each one of you in here now has not been positionally placed, you might not be nothing but a housewife. Well, you say, "Brother Brandon, I never done a thing in my life. I'm not a preacher." Well, maybe God brought you here to raise a family of children. Out of that family of children may come another family of children that'll be a preacher that'll send a million souls to Christ. &gt;&gt; You had to be here. You're here for a purpose. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Or you say, "All I ever done was hide across these old clouds. I take out early in the evening, get high, make my kids a living. I looked at the poor little fellas with no shoes on. I sat and cried. I got an old buggy man. Mo went to church. Don't you worry, brother. You just keep loving him. He's got a purpose for you. You just stay right the way you are. Just go right on. See, you might not never preach a sermon, but you might be the great grandfather of one that'll do it. &gt;&gt; Did you know that God credited uh let's see now? What was his name? Levi to pay tithe when he was in the loins of Abraham when Melzdc met him. How many knows that? &gt;&gt; And let's see. Abraham begott Isaac. Isaac begot Jacob. Jacob begot um Levi which was father, grandfather, greatgrandfather. When he was in the loins in the seed of his greatgrandfather, the Bible credit him for paying tied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother, &gt;&gt; oh, as a little as a little Englishman got converted over there one night in England, he said, "I am so happy. I am so happy yet so happy to know that that is true and some glorious day. I don't know when that day will be, but if that was the vision, I don't say I was here. I remember always bear this in mind. May the tape holders do the same. Whether I was in a vision or carrying away in the spirit, I do not know. But it was just as real as I hold my brother Neville. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just as real. And I could look and talk to those people. And there stood my first wife. She didn't holler at my husband. She said, "My darling brother." There stood a girl that I used to go with years ago. Perhaps some number of people sitting near. Alice Lewis from Utica. Very fine royal Christian girl. Got married a little late in life and had her first baby and died in childbirth. Alice Lewis. I walked into the funeral home to see her. I just got in home. I heard she was dead. I walked down there. There's nobody in the room. I said, "Is there a woman here, Mrs. Her name was Emiry. She married a fine Christian boy and she is a fine Christian girl. I've been with that girl everywhere. All kinds of places and everything and just kids 18, 19 years old everywhere. Fine Christian and never know nothing about it but genuine Christianity. I was a sinner. But I would go with her. I walked into and her husband a bornagain Christian, real man. And I didn't know I know she was dying. I'd seen the paper. I went down. They told me I went down there to cooches and I said, "Have you got a Mrs. Emerick?" He said, "Billy, she's right in the room there." I went in there and stood there by the side of the casket. I thought, "Alice, I've been in the darkest of dungeons. I've been over dark roads. You and I have walked together down through the roads and down across the the river when used to have the old showboats. We'd sit down and listen to that clappy play up and down the lanes. What a lady you were. How I thank God for your life. Rest, my dear sister. Rest in the peace of God. And the other night in the vision, there she come running to me. She said, "My blessed brother." And threw her arms around me. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister. It's changed me. &gt;&gt; I can never be the same no more. &gt;&gt; It's so real. It's just it's just as real as I'm looking at you. &gt;&gt; Just that real. So there is no fear. I may die before the night's over. I want to raise my little boy back there, Joseph. I want to see him in a pull pit. When I can take this Bible, when I get to a place I see Joseph in the pull pit preaching as a as a young man filled with the Holy Ghost, anointed with the spirit of God upon him, and I believe he'll be a prophet. The day when I when I when I saw him six years before he's born, you remember me telling you he was coming. &gt;&gt; Remember when I caught him right there at the side of the altar, not knowing what I was saying, dedicating babies. I said, "Joseph, thou art a prophet?" The other day standing out in the yard already come to me and he said, "Daddy, has Jesus got a hand like yours?" And I said, "Well, yes, son. Why?" He said, "I sitting on my bicycle watching for Sarah," that's his little sister to come home from school. Sitting out there, I won't let him go out on the road. He's sitting back like this and said I was looked up and said when I did there's a hand like yours with a white sleeve holding over me &gt;&gt; and said it went on up said was that Jesus's hand going up &gt;&gt; I looked at the mother looked at me we went out to Miss Woodses every where she's at sitting here we cross question him back and forth in every way we could vision he saw it when I can see the time at little Joseph standing I hope I live to see married of Jesus terries and I'm an old Man, the gray whiskers hanging around my neck here. I've sent I want to send two or three more million souls to Christ if I possibly can. It's my determination to preach the gospel to every corner of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So help me God. So when I can see that time come, Brother Mike, I can look at the time. Mama media, I call her my darling. See, she's we're getting old. See her hair turning gray and see us going away, fading away. Rebecca, I'm grateful for Rebecca. Her music teacher told me the other night said, "My if she keeps that up, Brother Brandham said it's hard to tell what she'll do." See, going on music, I want her and I want I want Sarah on the organ, Becky on the piano. I want Joseph in the pulpit. &gt;&gt; And I can see that happen. And me and mama can stagger in me on my old cane some night. Come down along the road. &gt;&gt; I can look in there and see my voice in there &gt;&gt; anointed with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. preaching the same gospel. &gt;&gt; I want to take this old book and say, "Son, &gt;&gt; here it is. It's yours. You stand with it. Don't you compromise on one word. You stay right with it, honey. Don't you don't care. I don't care who's against you, who's God will be for you. You preach every word just the way it's wrote in there. And daddy will see you across the river." &gt;&gt; I like to reach around and take her in my arms, &gt;&gt; my wife, and cross over Jordan. Until that time, God, let me stay on the field loyal. Let me I don't care what cost is or how many what I do or this that. Let me stay loyal and true to the word of the living God. That when that day comes, I cross over there and I can look cross and say, "There you are. Oh my precious friend, my precious brother, my precious sister, young preacher, get into the field. Stay into the harness. All you young preachers and things, don't you sit around. Don't you just sit and do nothing. Get out young and win a soul. Do something. Get on. Get moving. Don't stop. Young preacher over there. God bless your heart. He reminds me of when I was about that age, I guess, and maybe a little younger than him. I was only about 20 something years old and I laid that cornerstone there. I remember I used to wear a blue coat and a white pair of pants and stood there and laid that cornerstone about 31 years ago. &gt;&gt; See how old I was. I was just a boy. and stand there laying that cornerstone. I haven't compromised on one word. I've kept it just exactly the way I laid that cornerstone. Y's my testimony laying y where I wrote it out on the fly leaf of the Bible and tore it out and laid it in that cornerstone and she still lays there. May it be written on the pages of God's eternal word in heaven. Let me stand true unto the end. Let us bow our heads now just a minute for prayer. in the closing of this night, the closing of these one chapter which is not justified. You ought to have the other how he goes ahead and places a church in his place. I'll get it to you sometime, God willing. I've got to get just a little rest now before going to the shiitaka y to another big meeting when I cross over there to Oklahoma from there on to Plymouth Falls and Plymouth Falls on down to California up into Yakamo. Won't be back until next August the 15th. But look, let me ask you something. If something should happen to you or I before that time comes, if I should pass over the river into that land, or if you should pass over before that time into that land, do you feel the assurance tonight that we'll meet there in that place? If you do, raise up your hand. Say, I feel the assurance in my &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. If there's one of you that doesn't feel the assurance that they would be there and would like to say, "Remember me, Brother Brandham, that I will have that assurance," raise up your hand. I want to be there, too. God bless you, lady. God bless you. Our heavenly father, we bring to you tonight this congregation. Every hand, as far as I know, was up. All but one person, some precious soul sitting back here, just a little weary whether they could cross over the land where there's enough of real divine love in their heart and that precious woman's heart that she had come to that land or she is dying tonight. Would it pour her weary soul into the promised land of God? Father in heaven, as I have stood here at this pulp pit and preached and sweated and cried and begged and persuaded, let me ask you once more, Lord. Let me ask for my sister back there. God placed within her heart tonight that divine love, that Holy Spirit of God, &gt;&gt; that peace that passes all understanding that she would receive thy spirit be sealed away by the Holy Ghost until that day. I want to see her, Lord, when we cross over the bridge. If it's if it's my if it's my privilege to cross, if that what you showed me is real and I cross there, I want to meet her there and see her running grab me by the hand and say, "My precious brother, it was that night that something told me to raise up my hand when you got through preaching on the book of Ephesus. I raised up my hand and something happened to me after that. Here I am. I'm young now forever. God grant it to that precious one these who have raised their hands that they have been sealed away by the Holy Ghost. The spirit of God is upon them and they have received the Holy Ghost. They're sealed away with that godly love in their hearts. How we thank you for them realizing, Father, that out into the world these tapes will go. Many microphones are stretched across this pulpit which means that tapes are being made turning back there. The voice will be going into different lands across the world, around the world. 20 or 30 different nations will hear it. I pray for every person that hears this tape that hasn't got that hope of eternal life, that hasn't got the baptism of the Holy Spirit, may it come to their hearts sweetly. Grant it, Lord. And may I, if I never see them in this life, when I cross over into that land, may their running grab me. And I grabbed them and they we holler at precious brother to one another say I heard your tape on Ephesus. How that God predestinated us eternal life and it was on that tape that I received the voice of God and was sealed away by the Holy Ghost into the kingdom of God. Grant it, Father, heal all that's sick and afflicted. Give glory into thyself for we commit all this unto thee in all efforts in the name of Jesus thy son. Amen. Is there any here that's sick and wants to have hands laid on to be prayed for? Would you raise your hands? All right. Would you walk quietly now to the altar right here and stand just a moment while brother Neville comes with us? All this seems praying for the sick. This just seems like coming down to where you know where you're standing exactly. God knows all about this. When I hear that song, remember if you all are living when I go play this for me only believe. Remember, I'm not dead. I won't be very far from you listening at it. &gt;&gt; I can't die. Jesus gave me eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to raise me up at the last day. I'll see you. And if you go, I'll believe the same thing for you. I believe we'll see one another again. Look at this precious lady standing here with gray hair. You're Christian filled with his spirit waiting for him coming. Just stand out here waiting for the boat to come along. Amen. Oh, sister. Praise the Lord. Musicians, come please sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. We're going to take some prayer requests for those that have one tonight. I had one written here for um Melissa Snow has severe back pain and she asked for prayer asked for us to remember us in prayer. Sister Melissa Melissa Snow. So we want to keep her in prayer.
