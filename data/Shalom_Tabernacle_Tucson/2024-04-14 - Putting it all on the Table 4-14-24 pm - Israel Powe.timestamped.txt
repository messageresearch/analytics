[11:39] [Music]
[11:55] prayer dear Lord um tonight
[11:59] we just ask
[12:02] that brother George talks about Lord
[12:05] you'll just bless us encourage us Lord
[12:08] to just not alone just help with
[12:15] the of testifying giving things to
[12:18] people overseas and giving them
[12:21] opportunities and or just
[12:25] sending the pastors here to help them as
[12:28] well Lord but also our our
[12:32] personal uh reasons Lord you put us on
[12:36] Earth to testify and in our everyday
[12:39] life Lord May those things we here
[12:41] tonight encourage us to do what you put
[12:43] us to do here as well Lord not just
[12:46] what's over in different countries and
[12:49] but also just put it in our heart to
[12:51] strengthen us to do these things Lord
[12:53] even if we get discouraged Lord even
[12:55] though we may not see things right away
[12:58] or years to come come from our efforts
[13:00] Lord but just encourage us anyway Lord
[13:04] and may there we just do what you want
[13:08] us to do
[13:09] Lord Lord Jesus I just ask Lord that
[13:13] you'll be here with your children
[13:14] tonight Lord and pull the fogginess from
[13:18] our minds the sleepiness away Lord

[13:29] Lord Jesus tonight
[13:31] Lord Lord Jesus we appreciate everything
[13:34] you do for us Lord Jesus thank you
[13:37] Lord or we just ask these things humbly
[13:39] in the name of our Jesus Christ
[13:45] amen amen you can be seated if You' like
[13:49] I was just meditating on that song as
[13:52] brother Chris was singing this morning
[13:53] as the deer panth for the water and just
[13:57] thinking about that and it maybe maybe
[14:00] you don't understand what that means we
[14:03] take for granted and we sing the lyrics
[14:06] sometimes but just thinking about
[14:08] that the deer's not thirsty is why he's
[14:12] longing for the water it's not just Bo
[14:14] i' really like a
[14:15] drink but it's it's life or death to him
[14:19] when he's longing for that water he's
[14:21] been wounded by by something they're
[14:25] smelling that blood that's coming from
[14:26] him but he knows if he can get to that
[14:28] water
[14:29] that he can live and that needs to be
[14:32] our desire so when David is saying As
[14:34] the deer Longs for the water that's how
[14:37] I long for you oh God it's a matter of
[14:40] life or death I have to get to that
[14:41] water and so it's the same thing with us
[14:44] tonight it's not that we have to get to
[14:45] that water we have to get that water in
[14:47] US amen so let's just sing that chorus
[14:50] together I'm longing longing for Jesus
[14:52] Keep
[14:56] she I'm long
[15:00] in
[15:02] longing for
[15:07] Jesus I have a
[15:11] long in my
[15:15] heart
[15:16] for
[15:21] him just to be
[15:25] near
[15:27] him to
[15:29] feel his
[15:32] [Music]
[15:34] presence I have a
[15:38] longing in my
[15:41] heart

[15:46] ready while we sing it one more
[15:49] time yes I am

[46:15] Lord willing by the by the help of the
[46:17] Lord tonight that I hopefully will be a
[46:19] a help to you all so um Genesis the 22nd
[46:24] chapter if you'll turn in your Bibles
[46:26] Genesis the 22nd
[46:30] chapter while I'm thinking about it I
[46:32] want to make sure to extend my
[46:35] appreciation to brother Ezekiel and
[46:37] sister Lulu for the the uh young
[46:40] people's uh service the other night uh
[46:42] Friday night had the Bible study there
[46:44] at their home and just a wonderful time
[46:46] there with the young people and everyone
[46:48] who was able to to be there and uh also
[46:51] was thinking too um I think maybe
[46:54] Brother Scott and brother Brent worked
[46:56] uh worked real hard to get um to get a
[46:58] new camera up and running so if you look
[47:01] at the live stream you're going to see a
[47:03] lot better quality picture on the live
[47:05] stream just a wonderful job I was I was
[47:08] looking at it uh earlier today and very
[47:11] very nice job so we appreciate these
[47:13] things that that the Lord does for us
[47:15] Genesis 22nd chapter it came to pass
[47:19] after these things that God did tempt
[47:21] Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he
[47:24] said behold here am I and he said take
[47:26] now thy son thine only son Isaac whom
[47:29] thou lovest and get thee into the land
[47:31] of Mariah offer him there for a burnt
[47:33] offering upon the mountains which I tell
[47:37] thee of can you imagine the Lord asking
[47:39] you to do something like that Saints and
[47:42] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[47:44] saddled his ass and took two of his
[47:47] young men with him and Isaac his son and
[47:49] clav the wood for the burnt offering and
[47:51] Rose up and went under the place which
[47:53] God had told him then on the third day
[47:56] Abraham lift lifted up his eyes and saw
[47:58] the place a far off and Abraham said
[48:01] unto his young men abide here with the
[48:03] ass and I and the lad will go Yonder in
[48:06] worship and come again to
[48:09] you amen and Abraham took the wood of
[48:12] the burnt offering and laid it upon
[48:14] Isaac his son he took the fire in his
[48:15] hand and a knife and when they went both
[48:18] of them together and Isaac spake unto
[48:21] Abraham his father and said my father
[48:23] and he said here I am my son and he said
[48:25] behold the father fire and the wood but
[48:28] where is the Lamb for the burnt offering
[48:32] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[48:35] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[48:39] they both went or so they went both of
[48:42] them together and they came to the place
[48:44] which God had told him of and Abraham
[48:46] built an altar there and laid the wood
[48:49] in order and bound Isaac his son and
[48:51] laid him on the altar upon the wood and
[48:55] Abraham stretched forth his hand hand
[48:57] and took the knife to slay his son and
[48:59] the angel of the Lord called unto him
[49:02] out of
[49:04] Heaven said Abraham Abraham and he said
[49:07] here am I and he said lay not thy hand
[49:10] upon the lad neither do thou anything
[49:13] unto him for now I know that thou
[49:16] fearest God seeing that thou Hast not
[49:19] withheld thine son thine only son from
[49:23] me may God add His blessings to the
[49:25] reading of the word let's let's just bow
[49:27] our heads father we thank you for this
[49:30] word tonight Lord and Lord God we know
[49:33] that heavens and earth will pass away
[49:35] but this word will never pass away L we
[49:38] know it's an anchor that holds we know
[49:40] it's a tie poost and we know it's an
[49:42] absolute to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[49:45] tonight and Lord we ask that you would
[49:47] speak to us in the further part of this
[49:49] service and bless these few thoughts
[49:51] Lord I pray and Lord clear my mind oh oh
[49:54] God I pray that you would bind my lips
[49:56] before I speak anything unpleasing to
[49:58] you and we'll commit it into your hands
[50:00] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:03] and the church said amen God bless you
[50:07] may be seated and I'll just put a little
[50:09] title on this tonight of putting it all
[50:11] on the
[50:12] table putting it all on the table and if
[50:17] you want to turn over to the slideshow
[50:19] we'll we'll take a a look at this uh
[50:22] tonight and so uh as many of you um
[50:27] know that we were recently over Easter
[50:29] weekend from the uh flew down on March
[50:33] the 28th and was there uh with the
[50:35] Saints in Jamaica uh until April the 2nd
[50:38] when we come back and so um you know
[50:41] it's it's kind of a a strange thing um
[50:45] that I I had on my heart I I was I felt
[50:49] in my spirit and I was praying about uh
[50:52] I felt like we should have some sort of
[50:55] a missionary Outreach as a church uh I
[50:59] believe that churches should pursue a
[51:01] missionary Outreach and do y'all believe
[51:03] that tonight Saints and and so I was
[51:05] praying about that and and no sooner it
[51:08] was literally within a week of praying
[51:10] about those things that brother Israel
[51:12] took the trip to Warz uh Mexico and it
[51:16] had quite an impact on him as I'm sure
[51:18] it has us all uh and and kind of um uh
[51:23] you know it lit a fire there and so
[51:26] immediately after that um this uh this
[51:30] uh brother uh Jonathan Miller who was
[51:33] the pastor there in um in the the church
[51:38] in Jamaica keep in mind this is the
[51:40] oldest Message Church in Jamaica it's
[51:42] been there since 1963 and somewhere
[51:46] along the line brother uh Israel met him
[51:48] you met him in Florida didn't you
[51:49] brother Israel and uh and and had been
[51:51] acquainted with him from that time and
[51:53] he was asking brother Israel to to come
[51:55] down and of course he was Easter time
[51:57] brother Israel wasn't able to make it
[51:58] and it worked out to where I could go
[52:01] and so uh you know I I think it's just
[52:05] um a good lesson for all of us that um
[52:09] you know many times if there's something
[52:11] you feel and you feel like the church
[52:13] needs to do something or you feel like
[52:15] that we as a Believer a body of
[52:17] Believers need to do something really
[52:19] complaining about it doesn't do anything
[52:21] but praying about it does and so I think
[52:24] if we would pray more earnest ly that
[52:27] God will lead the church uh I believe
[52:30] that God will lead the church don't you
[52:33] I I'll I'll tell you this I I come here
[52:36] because uh I can sit down on Sunday
[52:39] morning and relax and know that I'm
[52:41] going to hear the word of God come
[52:43] across this
[52:44] pulpit and uh there's and I have
[52:47] absolute confidence in that and you know
[52:49] what a blessing that is to have that
[52:51] kind of confidence that that you're
[52:53] going to come to church and be able to
[52:54] Feast on the things of God
[52:56] and and so you know is there things that
[52:59] we could always do better every one of
[53:01] us have things that we could do better
[53:03] and those are things that to me we need
[53:05] to commit to the Lord and pray through
[53:08] and so this was an opportunity and and
[53:11] it was a a real blessing to be able to
[53:13] go and so uh it was over the Easter
[53:16] weekend and uh let me get to the second
[53:20] slide here if you want to go ahead and
[53:21] and turn it down here this was entering
[53:23] into Jamaica and you can see that
[53:25] beautiful water as I it was that was
[53:28] taken out out of the plane as we were
[53:29] coming into Jamaica and I think many
[53:32] times when you talk about Jamaica that's
[53:33] the Jamaica that people have in mind
[53:36] that's what they think about is the is
[53:38] the beautiful beach and some beautiful
[53:40] water at a resort somewhere but that's
[53:43] uh that's a lie that's not
[53:46] Jamaica and uh that's that's tourist
[53:49] Jamaica so if you fly right into Montego
[53:51] Bay or you fly right into Kingston uh
[53:54] and you can go right from there to a
[53:55] resort you'll probably see some
[53:57] beautiful water like that and has some
[53:59] sandy beaches and have all kinds of
[54:01] amenities but that's not what the people
[54:03] in Jamaica are dealing with on a day in
[54:05] and day out basis as a matter of fact
[54:08] it's it's it's it's hot it's just it's
[54:11] real hot and uh and it's real humid
[54:15] which we don't know nothing about in
[54:17] Phoenix or in Tucson but but I I I
[54:20] remember it well from being back east
[54:22] and so uh when we landed there uh in
[54:25] Jamaica I started I beat it up like a
[54:27] teag
[54:28] glass and uh I stayed beat it up until I
[54:32] left Jamaica it was hot it was humid
[54:36] there were uh mosquitoes Galore
[54:39] everywhere and so it was it was really
[54:41] rough and uh and there's no in in the
[54:44] places where we went there's no air
[54:46] conditioning or or uh you know not even
[54:49] hot water which which if you're in that
[54:51] kind of heat and humidity taking a cold
[54:53] shower is not the worst thing in the
[54:55] world I can assure you but uh these are
[54:58] people that are very very poor uh and
[55:02] the things that we take for granted um
[55:05] you know it's it's amazing uh how soft
[55:09] we get as a people and uh but these
[55:12] these folks don't have hardly anything
[55:15] and so entering into Jamaica you can see
[55:18] on the next slide uh the traffic is is
[55:22] terrible in the in the island and so
[55:25] Jamaica we flew into to Montego Bay and
[55:28] the church was only about 11 miles away
[55:31] from Montego Bay uh but it took over an
[55:34] hour to get there that 11 miles drive
[55:37] because of the immense traffic and
[55:40] because of the conditions of the roads
[55:41] and and you can see how narrow this road
[55:44] is uh and you can see that they're
[55:46] driving on the wrong side of the stupid
[55:48] thing and and that the and that the
[55:51] steering wheels on the wrong side of the
[55:53] car and and so it was just a kind of a
[55:56] it was kind of a strange sensation to be
[55:58] driving on the wrong side of the road
[56:01] but uh potholes you can kind of see the
[56:03] condition of the asalt there and and and
[56:06] what you know that the roads are in
[56:07] disrepair and there and that's one of
[56:09] the better roads there uh and it go and
[56:12] we so we go up into the mountains past
[56:14] Montego Bay and it's again very very
[56:17] poor there's about three million people
[56:18] on the island and uh the Island's
[56:21] roughly about the size of Connecticut so
[56:24] but with much of the Island being
[56:27] uninhabitable the the people are very
[56:29] concentrated and so uh we were uh you
[56:32] know it was very very uh uh driving was
[56:37] very difficult and to to
[56:40] further multiply the problems the people
[56:43] in Jamaica drive like wild people and uh
[56:47] and they're very easygo very laidback
[56:49] but when they get behind the wheel
[56:51] something happens to them and and they
[56:54] they just drive like crazy and and uh
[56:58] people uh you they drive through the
[57:00] parking lots they fly through the
[57:02] parking lots and and people just weave
[57:04] in and out of the traffic and and people
[57:06] are walking and they're just you know
[57:08] we're missing them by inches and by
[57:10] centimeters I mean we were just almost
[57:12] hitting uh everybody we went by and so
[57:15] it was kind of a nerve-wracking I I told
[57:17] my wife if you ever go to Jamaica I'll
[57:19] just have to blindfold you and then take
[57:21] it off when we get wherever we're going
[57:23] and so and all of the crazy driving and
[57:26] people jumping in and out of the roads
[57:27] and people on bicycles and motorcycles
[57:29] and people walking in the middle of the
[57:31] street and just all of that I never saw
[57:33] one accident I never saw one wreck uh
[57:36] everybody got where they were going
[57:38] don't ask me how and so uh that's just
[57:42] kind of kind of a little bit so entering
[57:45] into Jamaica this was uh the next slide
[57:47] is a this was uh we the the church only
[57:51] had metal folding chairs you know the
[57:53] old metal folding chairs that's what
[57:55] they had to sit on and so uh and they
[57:58] just had a few of them and so we had to
[58:00] actually rent some chairs for the
[58:02] meetings and and what we rented was
[58:04] plastic lawn chairs and so we went to a
[58:08] person's home in a wealthier area there
[58:11] uh and we rented those plastic uh lawn
[58:13] chairs so the people would have a place
[58:15] to set for the meetings and so these
[58:17] meetings were three four hours long and
[58:19] the people were on metal folding chairs
[58:21] and plastic lawn chair lawn chairs and
[58:23] nobody complained everybody was just as
[58:25] happy happy and I you know I it kind of
[58:28] condemned me that we sat in a a padded
[58:31] Pew with a with a air conditioner on and
[58:34] and and can't hardly grunt out an amen
[58:36] and these folks were just happy to be
[58:38] worshiping the Lord and it's 110 degrees
[58:41] in there and 200 people shoved in a room
[58:44] half this size with no air conditioning
[58:46] and a metal roof and so and they just
[58:47] worshiped the Lord and so what a lesson
[58:50] it was to me and so uh you know the the
[58:53] economics are kind of um kind of
[58:56] different there one US dollar equals
[59:00] $49 Jamaican dollars so that's the
[59:03] that's the uh The Exchange on that and
[59:06] so a bucket of chicken there at KFC was
[59:11] $5,300 if you could find a KFC and there
[59:13] was one in town in Kingsport right out I
[59:16] mean in uh Montego Bay right outside of
[59:18] the airport and so uh a $5,300 bucket of
[59:22] chicken so um uh and then uh when we
[59:25] took up the offering and I'm and I'm so
[59:27] happy to say that we that the night we
[59:29] took up the missionary offering we took
[59:31] up over
[59:32] $1,200 to carry down to help this church
[59:35] and that's I was so proud to present
[59:37] that to those folks and and somebody uh
[59:40] there was a check in there for
[59:41] $240 and so I I deposited that check
[59:45] into my account and then when I got to
[59:47] Jamaica I went to an ATM machine to
[59:50] withdraw that $240 to give to them well
[59:53] I withdrew it in Jamaican funds and it
[59:55] was
[59:56] $36,000 that I pulled out of the ATM
[59:59] machine so uh that was how much
[1:00:02] $240 was in Jamaican currency and so you
[1:00:07] know there's just some different things
[1:00:08] about the culture uh one of the things
[1:00:10] that struck me was uh that the the
[1:00:13] Jamaicans you know the Montego Bay is
[1:00:16] the is the birthplace or where Bob
[1:00:17] Marley come from and and that's s got
[1:00:20] some Reggae uh background there of
[1:00:22] course but the and so I expected that
[1:00:25] however I didn't expect that the
[1:00:27] Jamaican culture they love old country
[1:00:30] music and so I'm not talking about the
[1:00:33] church folks I'm talking about when
[1:00:35] we're driving through town and there was
[1:00:36] bars and you know dance places and it's
[1:00:39] just it's rough but but they they got
[1:00:41] all that stuff you know and they would
[1:00:43] be blasting
[1:00:45] old Merl hagard kind of country music
[1:00:48] and I thought how in the world did that
[1:00:51] get down here and and so come to find
[1:00:54] out the very first radio station that
[1:00:57] would ever was in Jamaica was in 1950
[1:01:01] and it played old country music and so
[1:01:06] the first radio station that they ever
[1:01:08] had played a bunch of old country music
[1:01:10] and so they got to listening to old
[1:01:11] country music and it stuck and so uh
[1:01:15] when I got in brother Miller's van and
[1:01:16] he was carrying me uh back to uh to the
[1:01:19] church area there to his home um the he
[1:01:23] had he was playing some gospel music and
[1:01:26] it was uh
[1:01:28] um oh she lived over there bias Brandy
[1:01:31] Loretta Lynn it was Loretta Lynn old
[1:01:34] Loretta Lynn singing gospel music and so
[1:01:37] I just thought that was kind of kind of
[1:01:39] funny that that that had kind of stuck
[1:01:41] in there so but this was just some
[1:01:43] pictures that I took that was close to
[1:01:44] the man's house you can see how
[1:01:46] beautiful the water and the and you know
[1:01:48] it's right close to the ocean and and uh
[1:01:51] and and so it's it's got a beauty to it
[1:01:53] it's very rugged uh next side shows a a
[1:01:56] Fruit Stand and there was all kinds of
[1:01:58] stands like this and you can see when I
[1:02:01] say a stand it's just sticks throw up
[1:02:03] and a a piece of canvas or tarp thrown
[1:02:06] over it and brother Miller would not
[1:02:08] allow me to pass this stand without
[1:02:10] getting me a coconut and so they they
[1:02:13] they bought me a coconut with a straw
[1:02:16] there to have and I didn't tell him but
[1:02:18] I I can't stand coconut but you know I
[1:02:22] uh I I took it and liked it you know so
[1:02:26] amen so that was but uh but but there
[1:02:28] was a lot of stands like this around it
[1:02:30] seemed like everybody was trying to do
[1:02:32] anything they could to make a few
[1:02:33] dollars like uh a lot of just and I
[1:02:35] don't think there's any regulation on it
[1:02:37] so they were just in odd places there
[1:02:39] would just be a stand up there that that
[1:02:41] somebody was selling something and all
[1:02:43] of these uh fruits and things uh none of
[1:02:46] that's imported of course it's all grown
[1:02:48] there on the island a lot of it's just
[1:02:50] out in the open wild it's not uh not
[1:02:52] necessarily a mango Orchard or whatnot
[1:02:54] it's just uh there'll just be mango
[1:02:56] trees here and there scattered
[1:02:58] throughout and so and the fruit was very
[1:03:00] very good so uh but uh the the next
[1:03:04] slide they don't have water in Jamaica
[1:03:06] they got water and uh so I thought I
[1:03:10] thought that was
[1:03:11] funny but they uh they speak English
[1:03:15] sort of and everybody there speaks
[1:03:17] English but it's got that Jamaican
[1:03:19] accent and and so people ask do they
[1:03:21] really say Yaman after everything and
[1:03:23] they say Yaman after everything so y
[1:03:26] was the the the preachers when they
[1:03:28] preach say Yaman and the the people when
[1:03:31] you talk to them say Yaman and I come
[1:03:32] back singing Yaman so you can't it it's
[1:03:35] really it's really catchy but they do
[1:03:37] have a a Jamaican Creo that that is like
[1:03:40] that is a language there and so it's
[1:03:42] kind of a mix of that and English uh but
[1:03:44] there was no I didn't have to preach
[1:03:46] with a translator I guess all that old
[1:03:48] old country music that they was
[1:03:50] listening to Growing Up helped them they
[1:03:52] understood me fine so um
[1:03:58] they didn't have a problem at all sound
[1:03:59] like they thought it was Merle Haggard I
[1:04:01] guess and
[1:04:03] so but uh but yeah it was uh it was
[1:04:06] interesting trying to they you know they
[1:04:07] talk fast and I I couldn't understand an
[1:04:09] H hes are pronounced a you know like a
[1:04:11] Amma he was asking for Amma he kept
[1:04:13] brother George passed me to Amma and I
[1:04:15] said I don't have a clue what you're
[1:04:16] talking about and he finally pointed out
[1:04:17] he was asking for a hammer so uh uh but
[1:04:21] but we got through it all just fine so
[1:04:24] um
[1:04:25] so the next slide shows every year they
[1:04:28] ask me if I wanted a bun and cheese a
[1:04:31] bun and cheese and so it's a Jamaican
[1:04:34] Tradition at Easter that everybody gets
[1:04:37] a bun and cheese and so that bun is
[1:04:40] actually like a loaf of some kind of
[1:04:42] spiced bread it's almost like a cinnamon
[1:04:45] raisin bread but with no raisins and
[1:04:48] then they slice that and they and they
[1:04:51] uh eat it with cheese now that says
[1:04:53] cheese but it's some kind of proc
[1:04:55] processed can of cheese something like a
[1:04:58] velita and so everybody everywhere at
[1:05:02] Easter time in Jamaica has a bun and
[1:05:05] cheese and so they sent me back home
[1:05:08] with a bun and cheese and uh so if you
[1:05:11] want to try it I got some at the
[1:05:15] house um so the next slide I just kind
[1:05:19] of got into this is kind of a different
[1:05:20] way of life and you'll notice like very
[1:05:23] poor so that's a tile shower but they
[1:05:25] didn't have money for a a a shower
[1:05:28] faucet so that's literally just a CPVC
[1:05:30] cut off glued in there and it only need
[1:05:32] one cuz they don't have any hot water so
[1:05:34] it's just cold water running and this is
[1:05:36] a video here this young man's not a
[1:05:38] Believer uh he just lives there in the
[1:05:40] community but I wanted you to watch what
[1:05:42] this young man's doing that's 10 tons of
[1:05:44] gravel right there and so just go ahead
[1:05:46] and play that
[1:05:51] video and so those bags he's filling
[1:05:53] them up and you can see got them all
[1:05:56] filled there and they uh they can't get
[1:05:58] the they can't get they couldn't get the
[1:06:00] truck any higher up on the side of the
[1:06:02] mountain so they just had to dump it
[1:06:03] there so this young man sat out there
[1:06:06] they just dumped it on Thursday when I
[1:06:08] got there and this young man sat out
[1:06:10] there and by the time I left on money
[1:06:12] see that the top of that mountain there
[1:06:14] behind that house is where he packed
[1:06:16] every one of those bags on his shoulder
[1:06:19] and uh that that kid probably weighs 115
[1:06:22] PBS and was bagging up those rocks and
[1:06:25] packing it to the very top of that
[1:06:27] mountain so it's just a little different
[1:06:30] than what we're used to and um and so uh
[1:06:34] it it struck me by the you know 10 tons
[1:06:36] of it or so and by the end of the
[1:06:38] weekend or when I got ready to leave he
[1:06:40] had he had uh he moved every bit of that
[1:06:42] gravel up to the top of that mountain on
[1:06:45] his back so uh the next slide shows uh
[1:06:49] go ahead and hit it again the next slide
[1:06:51] there's trees this is in the community
[1:06:53] and there's just various fruit trees
[1:06:55] everywhere through so you had a that was
[1:06:57] of course a coconut and a banana tree
[1:06:59] and then right in front of brother
[1:07:00] Miller's house was an avocado tree which
[1:07:03] I didn't even know avocado grew on trees
[1:07:05] and uh there was uh mangoes of course
[1:07:08] and some other fruits that I wasn't
[1:07:10] familiar with uh and you know we noticed
[1:07:13] that if if somebody had in the in the
[1:07:15] county there if they had a cow they
[1:07:17] don't have a pasture for it or whatever
[1:07:19] it just be tied to a rope and they tie
[1:07:21] the rope to a tree and then every day
[1:07:23] they'd move the move the Rope somewh
[1:07:25] where else to let the cow graze and
[1:07:27] there was also many times on the island
[1:07:30] in town and in out in the country and
[1:07:32] everywhere there was a lot of goats
[1:07:34] running wild and uh and chickens running
[1:07:37] wild and I thought well I asked brother
[1:07:39] Miller I said who's uh who's goats are
[1:07:42] those are they just wild goats he's like
[1:07:43] no that's somebody's goats he said
[1:07:45] they'll just go home at night and I said
[1:07:47] well I mean what keeps somebody from
[1:07:49] getting them he said if you get caught
[1:07:51] stealing a goat on Jamaica they'll kill
[1:07:54] you and and uh and he said and the uh
[1:07:57] and the police won't say anything about
[1:07:59] it cuz you stole the goat so uh
[1:08:02] apparently it's a big offense to steal a
[1:08:05] goat in Jamaica and so because of that
[1:08:09] you don't have to worry too much about
[1:08:10] stealing goats uh they'll they leave
[1:08:13] them alone so next slide uh shows uh
[1:08:17] just a little bit about the church and
[1:08:18] the surrounding area so you can see this
[1:08:21] is the church uh and brother Chuck we're
[1:08:23] going to get into some pictures here
[1:08:25] that Health that a that a building
[1:08:27] inspector probably doesn't need to see
[1:08:28] so uh you can just close your eyes as we
[1:08:31] go through this so uh but the church
[1:08:35] again it's been there since 1963 when
[1:08:38] when brother Brown they first heard the
[1:08:40] message it's the oldest Message Church
[1:08:42] in Jamaica you can see it's just a it's
[1:08:45] just a block and concrete building with
[1:08:47] a with a metal roof and the metal roof
[1:08:50] you can see there by that picture is
[1:08:51] just in
[1:08:53] disrepair and uh very very bad and I'll
[1:08:56] I'll show you some more pictures uh
[1:08:58] later on but but basically this roof has
[1:09:01] already caved in once and they've pushed
[1:09:04] it back up and scabbed uh some some some
[1:09:06] splices on the uh on the trusses there
[1:09:10] to hold it up but it's just hanging up
[1:09:12] there by a thread so hit the video there
[1:09:14] and this just kind of will pan around
[1:09:16] and show you the the community and the
[1:09:18] and the area that we were at so
[1:09:20] basically what happened here was uh you
[1:09:22] can you can go ahead and play it there
[1:09:24] uh basically what happened was the the
[1:09:26] original pastor of this church bought
[1:09:28] this parcel of land and he built the
[1:09:30] church there and then he gave uh he gave
[1:09:34] access to all of the Believers that was
[1:09:36] at the church that they could just come
[1:09:38] and build on the church's land and so
[1:09:40] the little Community or there there
[1:09:42] there's the church right there on the on
[1:09:44] the right hand side that's the back side
[1:09:46] of the church and so all of these houses
[1:09:49] were originally church members uh and
[1:09:51] they just came in and they built so many
[1:09:53] of the people that live right around the
[1:09:55] Church go to that church uh but what's
[1:09:58] happened is as we've seen in the message
[1:10:00] here uh that some of the some of the
[1:10:03] grand you know sons and the daughters
[1:10:05] and the grandchildren and
[1:10:06] great-grandchildren they they fell away
[1:10:08] and they don't serve the Lord and so
[1:10:10] you've got kind of a mixture there of
[1:10:12] Believers and and then family but not
[1:10:15] family that comes to church anymore and
[1:10:17] so that was kind of the dynamic that we
[1:10:20] that we dealt with there and so um just
[1:10:24] go to that next next slide there it
[1:10:26] shows the front of the church if you
[1:10:28] want to uh if you want to take a look at
[1:10:30] the cry room that cry room in that
[1:10:33] church would be a bench right on the
[1:10:34] other side of that porch wall there and
[1:10:37] and so you know don't complain about our
[1:10:39] cry
[1:10:40] room um and um so the next picture shows
[1:10:45] kind of the inside of the of the church
[1:10:48] here and
[1:10:52] um let me get to the right picture right
[1:10:56] frame here um and so uh you can see
[1:11:01] that's a nice floor they they uh brother
[1:11:04] Miller had been had come a couple times
[1:11:06] to the states to a convention in the in
[1:11:09] I think it was South Carolina where they
[1:11:11] have a a convention that basically it's
[1:11:14] where uh you know ministers from the
[1:11:16] states and and missionary minded
[1:11:18] ministers they meet and and people that
[1:11:21] need help come and they try to meet
[1:11:23] there and and um they you know try to
[1:11:27] help churches where they can well
[1:11:28] brother Miller had been a couple of
[1:11:30] times and had never gotten any
[1:11:31] assistance and so he went back and told
[1:11:34] the church you know what whatever we're
[1:11:36] going to do to this church we're gonna
[1:11:37] have to figure out a way to do it
[1:11:38] ourself and I like that you know you
[1:11:41] want to you want people that can try
[1:11:42] that's trying to help theirself and so
[1:11:45] you can see they they installed this
[1:11:47] floor uh and and if you'll notice this
[1:11:50] is very very poor they don't have much
[1:11:52] but what they do have is immaculately
[1:11:55] clean you could eat off of that floor
[1:11:57] and they kept it that way throughout the
[1:11:59] whole meetings and brother Miller's
[1:12:00] house he was very very poor and didn't
[1:12:02] have much but what he had sister
[1:12:04] Patricia's wife kept it immaculately
[1:12:07] clean and so uh you know you don't have
[1:12:09] to have a whole lot of wealth to take
[1:12:11] care of something and so uh they I
[1:12:15] believe I heard that brother brandham
[1:12:16] said anything that has any material
[1:12:18] value to it at all is worth taking care
[1:12:20] of and so I certainly believe that to be
[1:12:23] the truth is there a video on that I
[1:12:25] can't remember um no video okay go to
[1:12:28] the next slide there so uh go ahead and
[1:12:31] hit that I think this might be a video
[1:12:33] so before the service starts you can
[1:12:35] hear this music about an hour before
[1:12:38] service they go down and they turn this
[1:12:40] music on and just play it there's the
[1:12:42] inside of the church that was after we
[1:12:44] got some plastic chairs in there and uh
[1:12:47] and that's kind of what we were what we
[1:12:49] were dealing with to worship and when
[1:12:51] they turned that music on in that little
[1:12:53] community in that in that block building
[1:12:55] with that metal roof it just blasts for
[1:12:59] miles across the and so it's kind of
[1:13:02] like a church bell to tell everybody
[1:13:04] church is coming and I and and uh and
[1:13:07] Jamaicans are on a different time
[1:13:09] service started at 10: and everybody got
[1:13:11] to there at 10:30 or 11 and um so
[1:13:14] they're worse than they're worse than
[1:13:15] Shalom Tabernacle ain't they and and so
[1:13:19] they got there about they got there
[1:13:21] about an hour late and so uh
[1:13:26] so you can just kind of see what we're
[1:13:28] what we're dealing with there and um but
[1:13:32] it's it's it's just an interesting kind
[1:13:34] of dynamic uh the next slide will show
[1:13:37] you this stuff that we take for granted
[1:13:39] this is a truck full of water now the
[1:13:42] there is Municipal Water going up into
[1:13:44] the mountain but the line going up into
[1:13:46] the mountain is is very very
[1:13:48] small and um because it's so small and
[1:13:52] provides water to too many homes you
[1:13:54] there's no water pressure at all so what
[1:13:57] everybody has to do is put a giant
[1:13:58] sistern on top of their roof and they
[1:14:01] had to get a pump and they they pump it
[1:14:03] all the time and hopefully they get the
[1:14:05] sister filled up enough to keep up with
[1:14:08] you know the demand for water but
[1:14:09] there's just it's just not enough to
[1:14:11] supply everything so what they have to
[1:14:13] do on something like this where we're
[1:14:14] going to have special services and
[1:14:16] there's going to be a couple hundred
[1:14:17] people there using the water they'll
[1:14:19] never be able to supply enough so they
[1:14:20] have to truck in some water and fill the
[1:14:23] sistern up so I think that's a little
[1:14:25] video there you can you can play that
[1:14:27] and uh but that's that's kind of the
[1:14:29] situation that they're in that's just
[1:14:31] things that we take for granted that you
[1:14:33] can see the black tanks on top of
[1:14:35] everybody's home that's a that's a water
[1:14:37] tank and that's a that is an non oia
[1:14:40] approved ladder made out of a couple of
[1:14:41] pieces of bamboo there and uh and then
[1:14:45] you'll see I'll pan it over and show
[1:14:47] this is a sister that's what it looks
[1:14:49] like right there every home has got at
[1:14:51] least one of those on there you wouldn't
[1:14:52] have any water so uh so that's kind of
[1:14:55] the way they they uh they do that and uh
[1:14:59] so the next slide I'll show you uh when
[1:15:02] I so we had Friday we had five Services
[1:15:04] We Had a Good Friday service on Friday
[1:15:06] night and then Saturday we worked on the
[1:15:09] church uh as soon as as soon as I gave
[1:15:13] them that love offering that you all
[1:15:15] provided they immediately went to work
[1:15:17] trying to repair and do things to the
[1:15:20] church so in this particular uh instance
[1:15:23] here he's standing on top of a couple of
[1:15:25] drums there brother Chuck that is not
[1:15:27] OSHA approved and um and he's wiring in
[1:15:31] some new lights that they bought with
[1:15:33] the money that we took to them because
[1:15:34] there was no lights in this what they
[1:15:36] want to make this is a Sunday school slf
[1:15:39] Fellowship room on the side of the
[1:15:40] church and so they don't have a place
[1:15:42] where they can have Sunday school right
[1:15:43] now but that's what they want to turn
[1:15:45] this into and you can see that to run
[1:15:47] those wires they had to uh they had to
[1:15:49] Jackhammer up the wall there to run the
[1:15:51] wire through that concrete block and and
[1:15:54] then that brother on that uh on that
[1:15:56] rickety ladder and the other brothers on
[1:15:58] that homemade scaffold there and they're
[1:16:00] trying to run those wires those Brothers
[1:16:03] worked on that church from the time I
[1:16:05] got there until the time I left they
[1:16:07] never stopped working on that church uh
[1:16:10] on that church and so the brother in red
[1:16:12] there's the pastor that's brother
[1:16:13] Jonathan Miller and that's his
[1:16:15] son-in-law up on the scaffold uh uh
[1:16:18] there he's a young evangelist brother
[1:16:20] and then this other brother here is a
[1:16:21] deacon there at the church uh that's on
[1:16:24] the ladder there and and uh and so
[1:16:27] really really fine bunch of brothers so
[1:16:30] looking at some of the needs of the
[1:16:31] church on the next slide there you can
[1:16:34] see uh in this top Corner this was a fan
[1:16:37] that was in the pastor's study and uh
[1:16:40] you can see that the bracket is broke
[1:16:43] and it's hanging by the actual wires uh
[1:16:46] that that keep the fan going and I was
[1:16:48] just praying the whole time lord don't
[1:16:51] let those wires snap while I'm here uh
[1:16:54] because that fan was all it was keeping
[1:16:56] me alive in that Pastor study back there
[1:16:59] and so uh uh uh but it that's that's
[1:17:03] just what they're forced to deal with on
[1:17:05] this bottom right hand corner you can
[1:17:07] see where the roof has caved in snapped
[1:17:10] those trusses and uh they pushed it back
[1:17:13] up and they scabbed a couple of tubby on
[1:17:15] each side to to hold the roof in place
[1:17:18] temporarily there and that's what
[1:17:20] they're that's what they're dealing with
[1:17:21] now those joist uh those trusses are
[1:17:23] probably over 8 foot apart and uh which
[1:17:26] is nowhere near what it needs to be and
[1:17:28] like a good strong wind or a storm would
[1:17:31] would take that roof off um um and so
[1:17:35] the next slide kind of shows the this is
[1:17:37] the you know the just rebar and and and
[1:17:40] lines and stuff shoved through the wall
[1:17:41] there and and just things that are in
[1:17:43] disrepair about the church and those
[1:17:45] were the kind of things that they
[1:17:47] immediately started working on trying to
[1:17:49] get fixed when we showed up and so uh
[1:17:52] the next slide shows that's that room I
[1:17:54] was talking about here that they built
[1:17:55] on there obviously there's no windows
[1:17:57] there's no doors uh but they purchased
[1:18:00] those while we were there to try to get
[1:18:02] that up and running and then uh they
[1:18:04] would also use that like I said for
[1:18:06] Sunday school for fellowship and for
[1:18:07] overflow if they had a house full um and
[1:18:11] you can see that the the the concrete
[1:18:13] floors are very rough and so that's why
[1:18:15] the ceramic tile because uh it just
[1:18:18] would be too much work to try to get the
[1:18:20] floor smooth enough uh to put down
[1:18:23] anything else so basically the best
[1:18:24] thing they can do is put some put that
[1:18:27] uh put mortar down and and and put do
[1:18:29] the ceramic
[1:18:30] tile and uh I think it's you know it's
[1:18:33] it's you can tell in the church it's
[1:18:35] just like whatever they had so this and
[1:18:37] this color this and that color this and
[1:18:39] that color this and that color they're
[1:18:40] just doing the best they can so that
[1:18:42] sink there is in the is in the restroom
[1:18:45] and you can see that that's just that's
[1:18:46] not a faucet it's just a a PEC cut off
[1:18:49] that they put in the sink there just to
[1:18:51] to cut off it's just very very po go
[1:18:54] ahead and hit the um hit the video and
[1:18:56] you can see I'll just kind of pan it
[1:18:57] around so that you can see the the
[1:18:59] repairs that are needed in the church
[1:19:01] there uh and so there's brother there's
[1:19:03] brother Miller there in the blue shirt
[1:19:05] the pastor worked hard the whole time I
[1:19:07] was there this is that roof uh so you
[1:19:10] can hear the saws going and stuff in the
[1:19:12] background they were working the whole
[1:19:14] time I was there trying to get the
[1:19:15] church going that down rod on that
[1:19:18] ceiling fan brother Chuck's a 2x4
[1:19:20] scabbed on the trusses that's about to
[1:19:22] fall in and so uh uh that's just uh
[1:19:26] that's where they're that's what they're
[1:19:27] and you know did it stop them from
[1:19:28] worshiping the Lord not at all um so the
[1:19:31] next slide shows a sister that lives
[1:19:34] next door to the church and she has been
[1:19:36] going to church for many many years but
[1:19:38] she's had a leg amputated she's been
[1:19:40] been sick or had sickness and had a leg
[1:19:43] amputated and the sister can't get out
[1:19:46] of her house and she can't go to church
[1:19:49] because that's that's the we'll go back
[1:19:51] that's the uh that's the house so that
[1:19:54] ladder is the only way in and out of her
[1:19:56] house it's on the side of a mountain and
[1:19:59] so she wants to go to church uh but she
[1:20:02] can't get out I mean you know she can't
[1:20:03] get out there and so uh but that's the
[1:20:06] home that she lives in and that's kind
[1:20:09] of the shape that she's in I walked up
[1:20:10] to pray for her on Sunday night uh after
[1:20:13] one of the services I I walked up to
[1:20:15] pray for her uh and I had prayer with
[1:20:18] her there and then uh somehow or another
[1:20:20] them brothers got her into that church
[1:20:22] on uh Monday morning we had service is
[1:20:24] on Monday there so uh but she was able
[1:20:27] to get there so just looking at some of
[1:20:29] the people uh this little girl here this
[1:20:32] is uh this is Izzy and Izzy uh is uh
[1:20:37] brother Miller's granddaughter her
[1:20:39] parents are in the states and they come
[1:20:41] over to the states and their visa
[1:20:42] expired so they can't get back if they
[1:20:46] get back they'll never get back and so
[1:20:49] they're trying to get their paperwork in
[1:20:50] order but this little girl hasn't seen
[1:20:51] her parents in over a year so she's
[1:20:54] living down there with them you can play
[1:20:55] the video and see this uh she's a doll
[1:20:59] and uh what you doing girl what you
[1:21:03] doing tell them what your name
[1:21:06] is tell them what your name is he
[1:21:11] yeah yeah tell everybody hi hi I'm GNA
[1:21:15] send this back I'm gonna send this back
[1:21:17] to the
[1:21:20] States
[1:21:22] yeah so Izzy hadn't seen too many white
[1:21:27] guys
[1:21:28] and uh and was absolutely fascinated and
[1:21:32] kept asking me over and over why was I
[1:21:36] red and uh I said girl I'm hot and I go
[1:21:40] on you
[1:21:41] know and uh and so she was just
[1:21:45] fascinated uh she was just fascinated
[1:21:48] with me every mole every Freckle
[1:21:50] everything on me she kept picking out
[1:21:52] and uh she was just a a real sweet
[1:21:55] little girl I really enjoyed her being
[1:21:58] there and uh uh and so you know what
[1:22:01] kids is just kids wherever they are so
[1:22:04] the next picture will show you this uh
[1:22:06] brother in The Pink Suit right here
[1:22:07] looking fine is uh that's brother Mike
[1:22:11] and brother Mike's a 6 foot6 Beast of a
[1:22:14] man that's the Deacon there at this
[1:22:16] church and brother Mike stood at the
[1:22:18] back door and I complimented him because
[1:22:21] brother Brown said uh you remember when
[1:22:23] that he talked about that guy getting
[1:22:24] shot out of the pulpit that Pastor
[1:22:26] getting shot out of his Pulpit he said
[1:22:27] if you had a couple of good deacons back
[1:22:29] there he said they'd have had that gun
[1:22:30] out of his hand before he ever got in
[1:22:32] there and uh I'll tell you having a big
[1:22:34] old man like that in the back door just
[1:22:36] makes you feel better and uh uh because
[1:22:40] it is a rough area and they know I am
[1:22:43] from the states and that you know they
[1:22:45] they would assume that I've got money
[1:22:47] and so I never felt in danger there uh
[1:22:51] because the church folks took such good
[1:22:52] care of and stayed stayed right with me
[1:22:55] and uh but you know that stuff is out
[1:22:57] there and that's a reality so uh but
[1:23:00] just a fine man there that's brother
[1:23:02] Miller on the left and this is a little
[1:23:04] shop remember I told you everybody's
[1:23:06] just trying to do anything they can to
[1:23:08] make make ends meat to try to get you
[1:23:10] know generate some revenue and he had a
[1:23:12] open room in the bottom of his house and
[1:23:15] he just put a little store in there and
[1:23:16] he's got fabric softener and soft drinks
[1:23:19] and and uh you know crackers and bread
[1:23:21] and a few little odds and end things
[1:23:23] there in that little store and and
[1:23:25] people would just walk up to the house
[1:23:27] and and he'd run down and unlock and
[1:23:29] sell them you know just little little
[1:23:30] things here and there and so uh but
[1:23:33] that's just uh just kind of what he's
[1:23:35] trying to do to to to make it by there
[1:23:37] so the next uh slide this was just go
[1:23:39] ahead and play the video there this was
[1:23:41] a bunch of kids they were all fascinated
[1:23:42] with me and uh it just shows you if you
[1:23:45] so show a kid a camera Watch What
[1:23:50] Happens so here they come
[1:23:57] yeah oh yeah I'm G to send this back to
[1:24:00] the
[1:24:03] States yeah so uh th all those kids were
[1:24:07] so sweet and when I would get done
[1:24:09] preaching at night uh they would come up
[1:24:12] to the platform and every one of them
[1:24:14] would give me a hug and uh before I left
[1:24:17] the platform and I don't know what that
[1:24:20] was they wasn't hugging anybody else uh
[1:24:22] and uh the they com they commented that
[1:24:25] the kids was that they really loved me
[1:24:27] and and so I really loved them of course
[1:24:30] but uh it was almost like they just
[1:24:32] wanted you to bless them and so you know
[1:24:34] the kids would come up give me a hug and
[1:24:35] I would just have a little prayer with
[1:24:36] them and and they would leave and they
[1:24:38] did it every night that I was there at
[1:24:39] every service
[1:24:41] so
[1:24:43] uh and so this is a little picture of
[1:24:45] choir practice I just wanted you guys to
[1:24:48] I think you'll enjoy this you can hear
[1:24:49] them go ahead play
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:25:02] Israel I think this is a song you like
[1:25:04] that they ended up singing this
[1:25:11] [Music]
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:28] High all
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:26:19] so you just can feel the worship in
[1:26:21] their singing and uh this was a thong I
[1:26:24] I think this might have been a Third
[1:26:25] Exodus Assembly song uh and it was uh
[1:26:29] it's a the the tagline of that song is
[1:26:31] the third pool Ministry and so this
[1:26:34] picture on the right hand side somebody
[1:26:35] at the church painted this church ages
[1:26:38] uh on the back wall of the church there
[1:26:40] and again they don't they don't have
[1:26:42] anything but what they got they try to
[1:26:44] make it as nice as they possibly can and
[1:26:46] and so just some real talent there in
[1:26:48] the church uh and so I was just videoing
[1:26:51] those sisters as they were uh as they
[1:26:53] were you know getting their choir
[1:26:55] practice there and they ended up singing
[1:26:56] that in the in the service so uh now
[1:27:00] getting into the services here uh uh
[1:27:03] there it's on there's a couple of
[1:27:05] services on YouTube if you want to if
[1:27:07] you want to look at them uh they they
[1:27:09] put all of them out there brother Miller
[1:27:12] uh does them on Facebook live but it's
[1:27:15] just filmed with like a iPhone and it's
[1:27:18] the quality is very very poor it's hard
[1:27:20] to make out anything really uh but there
[1:27:23] are two
[1:27:24] Services uh that's at this YouTube this
[1:27:27] spoken word Apostolic Tabernacle which
[1:27:30] uh when you do the acronym is SWAT so
[1:27:32] it's like a SWAT team if you want to but
[1:27:34] SPO spoken word Apostolic Tabernacle and
[1:27:37] that is brother Keith Reed's church and
[1:27:39] so many of you may have heard of brother
[1:27:41] Keith uh but he's from down in Kingsport
[1:27:44] Jamaica and his church came up for the
[1:27:46] services the last two Services they came
[1:27:49] up and they they filmed it and it's
[1:27:51] really good quality you got a nice
[1:27:53] camera and so if you go to spoken word
[1:27:56] Apostolic Tabernacle uh Inc on YouTube
[1:27:59] you can see those two services from
[1:28:01] Monday and it's uh it's wor it's a
[1:28:04] blessing to hear the music and the
[1:28:05] worship and and uh so if you wanted to
[1:28:08] check that out you you you would
[1:28:10] certainly be uh you certainly be welcome
[1:28:13] to do that um so this video just go
[1:28:16] ahead and play this
[1:28:18] is this some worship
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:27] there's my Deacon brother in the middle
[1:28:28] of the door big guy back there
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:57] so you know a couple of things here with
[1:28:59] this uh and y'all y'all may not be ready
[1:29:01] for the next video but once they got it
[1:29:04] cranked up but I was in the office at a
[1:29:07] pastor's study with the door shut and my
[1:29:10] Apple watch went off and told me that it
[1:29:13] was over 95
[1:29:15] DB um and that I might be suffering with
[1:29:18] hearing
[1:29:20] loss and that was in the pastor study
[1:29:23] with a door shut so when you open the
[1:29:26] door and walk out I I cannot describe to
[1:29:29] you how loud it was and uh I loved
[1:29:34] it and so um it was quite it was quite a
[1:29:38] blessing now you know into the services
[1:29:41] and sa I I hesitate to even share some
[1:29:44] of this but I I I mean this is what
[1:29:47] happened so to the best of my knowledge
[1:29:50] but there was many miracles that
[1:29:53] happened while we were there in the
[1:29:55] services and I will say this for the
[1:29:57] glory of God that this is nothing to do
[1:30:00] with me this you could be the worst
[1:30:02] preacher in the world and preach in an
[1:30:05] atmosphere like this and uh and and God
[1:30:09] just does things when people have
[1:30:11] expectations and when people are when
[1:30:14] people Worship the Lord and when people
[1:30:17] have faith to just simple Faith just to
[1:30:20] Simply tell them what the word is and
[1:30:22] they just believe it and accept it God
[1:30:24] does things Saints and so as I go
[1:30:26] through some of these things I I I I
[1:30:29] don't I really don't want I don't really
[1:30:31] want to but I want you to know the
[1:30:33] things that the Lord did and uh but it
[1:30:36] has nothing to do with me I'm a man and
[1:30:40] and so um they didn't happen because of
[1:30:44] me they happened because of the people
[1:30:46] and there was such a faith and such a
[1:30:49] anointing there in those
[1:30:51] services and you know it's just uh it's
[1:30:54] just a was just a real blessing to be a
[1:30:56] part of and so
[1:31:02] um
[1:31:04] so the
[1:31:06] church is is it been there since
[1:31:09] 1963 so most of the area has heard about
[1:31:12] the
[1:31:13] message and uh many of the people have
[1:31:16] fell away over the last four or five
[1:31:19] years they've just stopped coming they
[1:31:22] they live right there in the community
[1:31:23] they live next to the church and they've
[1:31:26] just stopped coming and um so the church
[1:31:30] needed a
[1:31:31] restoration um and just a Revival so to
[1:31:35] speak and so I mean we've seen that
[1:31:37] Saint you've seen people that just you
[1:31:39] know over the last five years they've
[1:31:40] just stopped you know they they went
[1:31:42] along good maybe they went along good
[1:31:43] their whole life but all of a sudden
[1:31:44] they just stopped and and and and so
[1:31:47] that's what this church was dealing with
[1:31:49] and brother Miller was very you know
[1:31:50] disturbed by that you know he's like
[1:31:52] brother George he was my Deacon he just
[1:31:53] quit coming to church one day and then
[1:31:55] this brother over here and this sister
[1:31:57] here and this sister over here and this
[1:31:58] sister over here they just they just
[1:31:59] stopped coming and um you know those
[1:32:02] things are spirits Saints and so uh but
[1:32:06] we had many people came back to church
[1:32:10] that had fallen away and U and so I I
[1:32:14] know uh it was it was either six or
[1:32:17] eight people brother Miller was telling
[1:32:18] me about that had hadn't been to church
[1:32:20] in years and they came back to church
[1:32:23] during these services and and and and
[1:32:26] renewed their their vow to the Lord and
[1:32:28] so we saw people come in on crutches and
[1:32:31] walk out carrying them we saw people in
[1:32:34] wheelchairs that walked out pushing them
[1:32:37] and um and and and we saw one night in
[1:32:41] particular we had a a prayer line for
[1:32:44] the people and I asked brother Miller to
[1:32:47] lead the line and brother Miller told me
[1:32:49] that the Lord told him uh not to do it
[1:32:53] but to have me do it he said because the
[1:32:55] Lord told him you know these people but
[1:32:57] he doesn't and so there were people that
[1:33:01] came through the prayer line that uh
[1:33:04] that brother Miller told me that in my
[1:33:06] prayer I was praying things that the
[1:33:08] thing it was a fast line it wasn't
[1:33:10] asking for prayer they were were just
[1:33:11] laying hands on them and praying and
[1:33:13] they said those prayers were exactly
[1:33:16] what was going on in the people's life
[1:33:18] now I say that that's not nothing to do
[1:33:20] with me I don't know those people but it
[1:33:22] was an anointing on those services and
[1:33:25] so uh one sister in particular that I
[1:33:28] had prayed for and he said when I prayed
[1:33:30] I told her that uh she was nervous and
[1:33:32] she would the devil was trying to tell
[1:33:34] her she was going to lose her mind and
[1:33:36] he said she' had a nervous breakdown two
[1:33:38] years ago and that the devil had been
[1:33:40] just tormenting her about that since and
[1:33:43] so then another sister came up and I
[1:33:45] told her she was uh uh praying for her
[1:33:48] family and he said her husband had quit
[1:33:50] coming and and and she and she the next
[1:33:52] service she was there and her husband
[1:33:54] was with her and so and he called me
[1:33:57] yesterday and told me that many other
[1:33:59] things like that had happened where were
[1:34:00] people that were prayed for and had been
[1:34:02] healed and restored there was one
[1:34:03] brother that came in that limped in uh
[1:34:07] and we prayed for him and he ran
[1:34:09] out and um and so you know and just a
[1:34:13] just a a lot of things like that
[1:34:15] happened and then the other thing was
[1:34:16] that uh the brothers that came in from
[1:34:19] other churches there's eight message
[1:34:21] churches in Jamaica and seven of those
[1:34:24] eight had people there at these services
[1:34:27] so it was a wonderful Unity uh that that
[1:34:30] they all turned up all but one Church
[1:34:33] turned up had people there and they just
[1:34:35] were fellowshipping together and so when
[1:34:37] you have expectation and visitors and
[1:34:38] fellowship you know how it is Saints you
[1:34:40] got special meetings going on it was
[1:34:42] just a really special time and so the
[1:34:45] the brothers were saying uh many of the
[1:34:48] brothers from the churches said that
[1:34:50] that that what they heard and keep in
[1:34:52] mind we we had Friday service and we had
[1:34:54] two services on Sunday and we had two
[1:34:57] services on Monday and because Monday
[1:35:01] they call it they call it Easter Monday
[1:35:02] in Jamaica it's a holiday also should be
[1:35:05] a holiday here shouldn't it and um and
[1:35:08] so everybody turned up on Monday and
[1:35:11] many of the brothers said that the
[1:35:13] things that their pastors were preaching
[1:35:15] on Sunday they heard reiterated on
[1:35:18] Monday and so they felt good that it was
[1:35:20] in the same line of CH thought and the
[1:35:22] same channel y'all know how Lord does
[1:35:24] that where where you've been listening
[1:35:25] to a tape and you come in and you hear
[1:35:27] it preached on the same thing or or you
[1:35:29] or you or you heard something preached
[1:35:30] on and then the next tape you listen to
[1:35:32] brother Brown's talking about it and or
[1:35:34] you you know been talking with somebody
[1:35:36] in your family about something you come
[1:35:37] to church and the things preached all
[1:35:39] over that's that's what we like is when
[1:35:41] when uh when when God does things like
[1:35:44] that and so we just saw so much of that
[1:35:47] that I I don't have time to go into it
[1:35:50] uh one of the things that was really
[1:35:52] striking to me is it was a sister there
[1:35:54] that had a the a powerful voice it was
[1:35:58] like she was like it was like a it was
[1:36:01] like an artha Franklin kind of voice it
[1:36:03] was just this powerful powerful voice
[1:36:07] and she sang on Sunday morning very
[1:36:10] anointed and really blessed the service
[1:36:12] and and um so that Monday I was hoping
[1:36:16] that she would sing again and so I was
[1:36:18] waiting for to sing waiting for to sing
[1:36:20] waiting for to sing and it was the last
[1:36:21] service on Monday night and she hadn't
[1:36:24] sang and so as soon as I got up to the
[1:36:26] platform I said I wonder if we could
[1:36:28] take time for one more special and I
[1:36:30] asked that sister sister can you sing
[1:36:32] for us again and she did and the Holy
[1:36:34] Spirit fell in the service just so
[1:36:35] beautiful because she was so uh had such
[1:36:37] a powerful voice and brother Miller told
[1:36:40] me after the service he said brother
[1:36:41] George I was heading down here to ask
[1:36:43] her to sing he said the Lord told me
[1:36:46] don't ask her he said if the L he said
[1:36:48] he said if the Lord wants her to sing
[1:36:50] the Lord will make a way for her to sing
[1:36:52] and he said then the first thing you
[1:36:53] said when you got up in the Pulpit was
[1:36:55] can you come sing sister and so just a
[1:36:58] lot of things where you could find that
[1:36:59] the Lord was working on all ends at the
[1:37:02] same time and so it was really a
[1:37:04] blessing so let's play this next video
[1:37:07] here
[1:37:09] uh they cranked it up a little bit there
[1:37:13] and uh
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:27] all right so uh so just the the you can

[1:37:38] Church website so uh I'll have some more

[1:37:46] yeah that's that's a little action shot
[1:37:47] there and uh so that's kind of the end
[1:37:50] of that slideshow uh and I would just
[1:37:53] say this and and I we don't have time to
[1:37:55] preach tonight this it's too it's too
[1:37:57] long at this point but I I would just
[1:37:59] say this I read that scripture there uh
[1:38:02] uh about Abraham and and and and Isaac
[1:38:06] and and I would just say this saints
[1:38:09] that there there is a law to things and
[1:38:13] um there is a law of of sewing and
[1:38:17] reaping and and it's not I mean it's not
[1:38:20] it's it's a law of God and and even
[1:38:23] secular businesses understand this law
[1:38:26] even secular businesses understand that
[1:38:28] for some reason or another when they
[1:38:30] give money away they get money more
[1:38:32] money back it's a it's a law and and and
[1:38:36] we understand that better than anybody
[1:38:38] as as
[1:38:39] Christians and um and so in this
[1:38:43] instance here you know you think well uh
[1:38:46] many times we kind of focus on our s and
[1:38:48] we focus on our needs and we focus on
[1:38:51] what we're looking for and and and even
[1:38:53] we focus on uh uh uh what our church
[1:38:56] needs what this church what inside these
[1:38:59] four walls need but but the Bible said
[1:39:02] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:39:05] obtain mercy and so if you want Mercy
[1:39:09] yourself you have to first be merciful
[1:39:12] and so I I just feel like Saints in this
[1:39:15] shape right here these These are laws
[1:39:17] brother Israel preached on the tithing
[1:39:19] not just money but time right you're
[1:39:21] know you you know do we tithe our time
[1:39:23] and and those type things and and and
[1:39:26] Saints I would just feel like that if
[1:39:28] you want a strong church then help
[1:39:31] somebody else have a strong church and
[1:39:34] God will make your church strong and and
[1:39:37] and I feel like if we want a church
[1:39:38] building and we need a church building
[1:39:40] here Saints and I feel like if we want a
[1:39:42] church building Let's help somebody else
[1:39:44] with their building and I believe God
[1:39:47] will provide us a building yall believe
[1:39:49] that that's how God works Saints and and
[1:39:52] and we noticed here with Abraham that
[1:39:54] that Abraham he didn't have to give his
[1:39:57] son Isaac but he had to be willing to
[1:40:00] give his son Isaac he had to be willing
[1:40:03] to do it it was his he had to be willing
[1:40:05] to give what he had to do to to and and
[1:40:08] because and and the Lord told him
[1:40:10] because you have done this because you
[1:40:13] haven't withheld your son I know you
[1:40:15] fear me and then the next verse I didn't
[1:40:17] read it tonight but he said because of
[1:40:20] that I'm going to bless you amen and
[1:40:23] your seed after you and you know we find
[1:40:26] many times in the scripture it's like
[1:40:27] that little woman that that only had she
[1:40:29] had this much meal and she had this much
[1:40:32] oil and and she was going to make that
[1:40:35] for her and her son and she was going to
[1:40:37] die and and and but that Prophet come
[1:40:40] through the land and he said bring me
[1:40:42] something to drink and bring me a little
[1:40:45] cake and she said I ain't got but just
[1:40:47] this much meal and I'm going to die he
[1:40:48] said but make me a cake
[1:40:51] first is that right
[1:40:54] and and and you know what if she hadn't
[1:40:56] made him a cake she'd have starved to
[1:40:59] death but because she gave her all to
[1:41:02] God and because she put God first that
[1:41:06] barrel of meal never went empty and it
[1:41:08] never went dry and God don't have no
[1:41:10] financial
[1:41:14] problems amen and you know so many times
[1:41:17] we focus on oursel and what it opened my
[1:41:20] eyes to is to stop focusing on myself
[1:41:23] and focus on others that's Christianity
[1:41:26] isn't it amen and so um you know I I
[1:41:35] I I want to read this this one quote to
[1:41:38] you here and then and then I'll go ahead
[1:41:40] and
[1:41:42] close um me find it
[1:41:46] here brother Bram said and be certain of
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:51] 5978 he said seek ye first the kingdom
[1:41:54] of God and his
[1:41:56] righteousness and all other things will
[1:41:59] be added unto you he said put God
[1:42:04] first put his word first put his Spirit
[1:42:09] first put him
[1:42:12] first he said but instead of that we put
[1:42:14] him last and on this scripture he said
[1:42:18] he talked about that little woman he
[1:42:19] said bring me a little cake first he
[1:42:21] said what's she going to do see if she's
[1:42:24] obedient to the word he said bring me a
[1:42:28] little cake first now to be obedient to
[1:42:30] the word there's a quote in end time
[1:42:33] evangelism uh that brother brandham says
[1:42:35] you are always in the will of God doing
[1:42:40] missionary work now now how many things
[1:42:43] can you say that you're always in the
[1:42:46] will of God doing so we talk about these
[1:42:49] things Saints this is something we don't
[1:42:50] have to second guess we know that this
[1:42:53] is the will of
[1:42:57] God Amen and he says
[1:43:02] this he
[1:43:03] says see if she's obedient to the word
[1:43:06] she turns and starts not knowing what
[1:43:09] she's doing men and women who are led by
[1:43:12] the spirit of God sometimes do things
[1:43:15] that they don't know they're
[1:43:18] doing have you seen that he said she
[1:43:21] turned and started to the house and then
[1:43:23] she heard that voice again that glorious
[1:43:26] word come from his mouth thus saith the
[1:43:30] Lord and she knew who it was then she
[1:43:32] said the barrel will not go uh he said
[1:43:35] the barrel will not be empty neither
[1:43:37] shall the Cru run die until the day the
[1:43:40] Lord God sends Raina on the earth why
[1:43:43] she was willing she put God first she
[1:43:47] was sure that God would do something she
[1:43:51] held on brother brandom said
[1:43:53] amen so Saints we just got to put it all
[1:43:57] on the table and we can't have parts of
[1:44:00] our life that we're not willing to put
[1:44:04] on the table and and you know many times
[1:44:06] when you see that we struggle we
[1:44:07] struggle in places if we struggle as a
[1:44:09] church or we struggle as an individual
[1:44:11] when you many times I've set in counsel
[1:44:13] with people and and it's so glaringly
[1:44:15] obvious the thing that that's causing
[1:44:17] them trouble maybe it's a job but but
[1:44:20] they're just not willing to put that job
[1:44:22] on the table
[1:44:23] but it's a it's a matter of priority
[1:44:26] that that that if a job's keeping you
[1:44:29] out of the house of the Lord get a new
[1:44:31] job is that right get a new job but but
[1:44:35] that's got you got to be able to put it
[1:44:37] all on the table or maybe you got a
[1:44:38] hobby that's that's causing you problems
[1:44:40] that's dragging you down some kind of
[1:44:42] way but you're not willing to put that
[1:44:44] put that hobby on the table or or or you
[1:44:46] know you got maybe it's your cell phone
[1:44:48] you're not willing to put put down it's
[1:44:50] causing your problem but you're not
[1:44:51] willing to put that thing on on the
[1:44:53] table or or or there's any number of
[1:44:55] things that causes problems and we got
[1:44:57] to be willing to put it all on the table
[1:45:00] and you say well brother George you got
[1:45:01] to get rid of all those things I'm not
[1:45:03] saying you do you just got to be willing
[1:45:05] to if God wants you
[1:45:07] to
[1:45:10] amen amen so I I'll close with that
[1:45:13] Saints I I uh I took too long on that
[1:45:17] but I I really feel like uh the the trip
[1:45:20] was a real eyeopener for me and I feel
[1:45:24] like anything we can do to help those
[1:45:25] people we need to do there's one other
[1:45:27] thing that I forgot to mention I the the
[1:45:29] Lord doesn't have any financial problems
[1:45:32] and immediately when I got back I went
[1:45:34] to work on Wednesday and my boss and my
[1:45:37] boss's boss were there and they were
[1:45:40] asking me about the trip how was Jamaica
[1:45:42] you know and I was telling them and I
[1:45:44] even showed them a few of those pictures
[1:45:45] and showed them the condition that those
[1:45:47] people were living in and and the
[1:45:49] condition that the that the church was
[1:45:50] in and and my boss was George I mean how
[1:45:54] can we help uh how can we how can we
[1:45:57] help you can can I give you some money I
[1:45:59] said oh I'll take you
[1:46:01] money and uh he said I'll take I'll God
[1:46:05] will take it too and so uh I said yeah I
[1:46:08] mean that'd be great he said he said
[1:46:10] well hey how can you do a write up can
[1:46:12] you get like a GoFundMe or something
[1:46:13] started and and do a write up and we'll
[1:46:16] put it in our company newsletter that
[1:46:18] goes all across the nation and just see
[1:46:20] if anybody wants to donate and so I just
[1:46:22] just feel like these are little things I
[1:46:24] didn't ask him nothing Saints he asked
[1:46:26] me amen hey I I the last thing on my
[1:46:30] mind was that that the company that I
[1:46:31] work for the secular company that I work
[1:46:34] for would be wanting to sponsor a
[1:46:35] missionary uh effort in in Jamaica but
[1:46:39] God don't have no financial trouble amen
[1:46:43] so we believe that God will supply our
[1:46:46] needs amen amen what a blessing amen can
[1:46:51] we just bow our heads Heavenly Father
