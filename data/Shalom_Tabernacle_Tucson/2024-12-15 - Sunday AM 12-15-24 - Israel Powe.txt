only believe only be ho Bey all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brandon when the first church age started was Ephesus amen Paul the angel of that church one of the Stars the Seven Stars which means seven angels seven Messengers this week I'm going to take the scripture and the history and prove you each one of those are true in each Angel and every angel had the same light that's right then right between these ages that great one to come notice now they're drawing from this main bar are the light the life is dipped into Christ you are dead your life is hid in Christ through hid in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Spirit there's no way at all to ever get you away from there how can you do it nobody can tamper with you the end of your life is burning with the Holy Ghost upbring given light where's the other end of your life into Christ you're a dead and hidden Christ the Holy Ghost is B it off there that you can the devil can't touch you amen he can whiz and make an know even death itself can't touch you oh death where is our s where is our Victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ the end of this verse let's read it and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the son of man my did you notice Stars candlesticks lamps what is does it mean what does this mean that the dispensation that we're living in is nighttime channels and lights and stars me night and what does a star do it reflects the light of the sun until the sun returns blessed be the name of the Lord and a true minister of God don't reflect some flashlight some match them some sh a burning he reflects the golden Radiance of Christ to the church that he's the same and he's alive and he shine on me amen that's the light he reflects the star reflects the light of the sun see so we're reflecting the light of the Son of God doing the same thing he did given life what kind of Life Gospel Life For Those now let's watch in this a little further as we take the rest of this uh 13th verse and in the midst that's the middle of the golden six one like the son of man clo with a garment down to the foot and GED about the paps with a golden girl now here's more proof that this Doctrine is right about being the Lord's day did you notice him he was not a priest during this time neither was he a king he was a judge notice a priest the high priest when he went into the sanctuary or went to minister to service he tied himself around the waist tying his girdle around the waist meant that he was serving never tied over his shoulder but here he comes out walking out with the girdle tied around the top with a sash over his shoulder GED about the PLS the breast with a golden girl GED up high what is it I an attorney a judge the judge with his sash over his shoulder G it up here knock down as a priest see that shows he was in his priesthood now John went all the way over into the Lord's day and saw him coming as the judge you believe he's a judge let's read St John 5:22 right quick we see whether a judge or Not St John 5 and 22 for the father judges no man but has all judgment unto the son am that right he is the judge the Supreme judge and John shows that he wasn't in the day of his prophecy as a prophet neither was he come out into the days of his kingship but he was in the day of the Lord as a judge now how many knows that that the priest having his girdle is string around his waistline meant he was in service Anyone who reads the Testaments and knows the Old Testament knows that when a priest is GED around here he's in service he's a servant but he was GED up here a judge let's read a little farther a golden girl was about the PS that's right up around here he was a judge now we're going to read the Sevenfold Glory of his person oh oh my this makes me shot before I get to it notice oh this is such a wonderful thing just listen and his head now watch he seven things here he misses his head his hair his eyes his feet his voice seven things he mentioned here the Sevenfold Glory of Jesus Christ let me read it his head and his hair was white as wool as white as snow his eyes were a flames of fire his feet like fine brass as if it had been burnt in the furnace and his voice a sound of many Waters and in and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth goes a sharp two a sword and his countenance was like the sun shining in its strength what a vision what did he see here the glorified Son of God and Assemble now let's let's just be ready now oh my I thought that was nine it's only eight I haven't got started yet all right that is good amen now sorry these brethen standing out makes me nervous to see stand see because I know their legs are hurting if I just had anyway brother of anything I could do I'd sure do it now I want you to get this so bad and stand a little while and God reward you richly is my prayer now now notice the first thing I we notice his head and his hair was white like wool his head and his hair was quite like wool now it does not mean that he was aged that did this that wasn't the reason of it he wasn't aged to do this he was it was because of his experience and qualification in his wisdom because he's Eternal and eternal cannot Aid you understand let's turn first we we picture him out here this we'll find out what he is now let's turn to Daniel 79 just a minute you see the same picture in Daniel where he comes as over here at the ancient of time and most everybody Bible scholar knows exactly where we're heading for right now Daniel 7 and the ninth verse I begin at the eth and I consider the harm and behold there came up another little horn before whom there were three out of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn there were eyes like a man and a mouth speaking great things and I beheld until the Thrones were cast down now listen listen close now can you hear me in the back all right say Amen if you can I asked my wife back there I think this Mike here this more of a alive here isn't yeah now I yell too hard I guess in this one all right now Daniel 7:9 and I beheld until the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did set whose garments was white as snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool Ancient of Days his throne was like a a fiery flame and his wheels were burning fire and fire fiery streams issued and came forth from before him and thousands thousands ministered unto him and tens times 10,000 stood before him and judgment was set and the books were open what hair all anybody knows that the old judges and ancient days like English judges used to wear a snow white wig how many remembers that old ancient judges wore a white wig because they wasn't here he is showing again at John's over lord day he saw him as the judge amen amenah not his priest not his King not his Prophet but his judge the father St John 522 committed all judgment to him and he's judge now come to judge the Nations all for that day when you see him like that his hair was as white as snow Daniel saw him coming to the Ancient of Days watch him blend these two together all right uh and the Judgment was set and the books were open and I beheld then be and I beheld them because of the voice of the great uh great words which the hor know I've got the wrong place hav't him Daniel 7 and n yeah here we are and he SS and a fiery stream issued forth and came from him and tens of thousands came and Minister unto him and I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake and I beheld even until the Beast was slain and his body was destroyed and given to the the burning flames as concerning the restr of the Beast they all had their Dominion taken away that's all the Gentile powers and kingdoms will fall yet their lives were prolonged for a season in time and I saw in the night vision and behold one like the son of man come in clouds of Heaven how do we see him coming this morning in the third verse coming in the Clouds Of Heaven the son of man one like to the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven and he came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him now before him and there was given him a dominion and glory and a kingdom and all people Nation languages should serve him this Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom shall his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed come to the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as wool and John turned and he saw one like the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with a Snow White hair the judge not GED around the waist but GED around the pths up here a judge amen with the flash of the judge over shoulder he still with a golden pure holy refined girl that held his righteousness is covered he was covered all the way to the feet watch the Sevenfold manifestation of his person and Glory now I believe the 14th vers hair his head and his hair was as white as like wool as white as snow and his eyes were a flames of fire head hair eyes were like flames of fire think of it those eyes who once was dim with human tears now as to come flames of fire in Anger he stands there as an angry judge why did you reject him oh sinner think of this think of it lukewarm church member think of it Catholic Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal think of a Catholic your Virgin Mary had to go up to Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost and stagger and act like a drunk woman the very mother of Christ had to get that before she'd be permitted to Heaven how are you women going to get there anything less than that amen think of it man each of you is hair and his eyes once dim with human tears yet I want you to notice something about those eyes when he was on Earth yet they were dim with tears like a man for he cried at the grave of Lazarus right full of sympathy his Humanity he was clothed he was God clothed in humanity in order to take away sin but yet behind that Humanity he had something behind that could look right down at the heart of a man and know all about him why there was something behind him yet he was clothed in martal flesh but they didn't know who it was if you don't believe he said that I am he you will die your sins that's right if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works of my father then believe the works if you can't believe me me oh how he tried to get the message to him the Revelation can look right down into the heart of a man know all about him how I think of that those eyes that once pierced over the mountains looked into the face of suffering and could weep like a man but yet could take the spirit of God behind that human Vision there and see all things things which was things which would were and things which would come for tell the end from the beginning that's because God was behind them human eyes amen let God come into your life and take control of you and he'll show you things to come for it's not you no more it's the holy spirit in your life back there looking through that more Liv to pick out things Oh Glory to God I pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughter shall prophesy your young man shall see Visions your old man shall dream dreams Hallelujah sometimes you have tou you to sleep so he can look through you but he'll sure show you many times your young man shall see Visions your old man shall dream dreams upon my hands madees and made tur I pour out of my spirit not upon my deacons and pastors and upon my upon whosoever will upon All Flesh I'll pour out my spirit amen you wonder why I scream that out but it's coming in these Church ages he was those eyes and remember one day those eyes that were de with tears those eyes are standeth of judgment now they're like fire flames running to and fro through the whole earth and there's nothing happens but what he knows it oh my it's recorded running to and fro through the earth watching every move perceiving every thought knowing everything you're doing the intents of the heart what you intend to do he knows all about it he knows where you love him he knows where your intentions are right to serve him he knows all about it and what will it be when you stand that day whenever sin get before him and he stands there as a white Throne judgment God deliver me from that place I don't want to see that when an angered God walks out there with fire flashing from his eyes with a righteousness of white wig over his head like that and his eyes flashing with fire that those every thoughts of your heart and everything you ever intended to do hi be over in a Rock of Ages left for me old fell used to say when this world all on fire Stand By Me Stand By Me let thy bosom be my pillow hide me over in the Rock of Ages God I don't want your judgment I don't want your what I want is your mercy Lord Give Me Your Mercy not your Justice Just Give Me Your Mercy not your laws not any just give me mercy Lord that's all I can plead for nothing in my arm I bring I'm no good no count only simply to thy cross I cling Lord that's all I know one come to take my place watch this Sevenfold personage now of his person and uh you'll see that what he did his head was white as snow like wool white hair and uh his eyes were as uh let's see his head was white like snow and his eyes were flames of fire and his feet were like fine brass has been burnt into the furnace watch now we just noticed where he's covered you know now watch his head his eyes now he go down to his feet like brass what's the contrast to that image there that John saw of Jesus and what Daniel saw of the world Empire the head of gold and so forth look at what this was here stand there brass what does brass speak of brass speaks of judgment Divine judgment it shows that his full purpose is coming here on Earth is God to be made flesh and he died for us and took the judgments of God the Divine judgment and it's received a kingdom that's brass and solid and cannot be moved nothing harder than brass never found nothing yet that were temper judgment brass speaks of divine judgment pass look at the brass serpent in the wilderness what did that brass serpent represent the serpent represented sin but being brass judgment already passed on sin amen now notice also the Days of Elijah when they had rejected Elijah's Prophet that little thre of the ancient Church age one of these days I'll bring up and show you Israel had seven Church ages to and typed exactly with these and in their Church age in the Days of Elijah they refused him and there's three years and 6 months there was no rain and the ancient Prophet said that the skies look like brass amen Divine judgment upon on the Nations for rejecting God and listening to Jezebel brass also represent Divine judgment the altar where the sacrifice is killed amen rais an alar kill the very foundations of brass the Judgment he tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of God and Tuck our judgment upon Him amen turn to Revelations 19:15 just a minute let's see what it is the Revelations 19 and 15 let's read just a moment I and find it yeah let's begin about the uh let's see about the 12th verse his eyes were flames of fire and on his head was a crown many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name was called the word of God now remember his name wasn't the word of God his name was called that see his name is called the word of God and the armies of Heaven the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he shall tread what that tread The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of all Mighty God what did he do [Music] oh [Music] h h [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] oh [Music] l [Music] [Applause]

you take the service George but he said you like that too he said I did like it kind of so so they kind of tease that way they love each other he good friends with the uh with the Moors and so God bless them so much before we go into the word this morning I just wanted to share a brief I try to keep it as brief as possible a testimony on uh how we acquired the building we closed on that building on Thursday so praise the Lord amen amen let's give the Lord a and of praise and I'll just go over a few notes that really are blessed in how it came about in as you all know we've been meeting here at this location uh for nine years and um they have always been very kind and very friendly to us as far as the price that we're paying for this location and um so when I would start to complain I'd have to stop complaining when I look around at the blessing that the lord gave us I mean there's a lot we can say about the sound or layout or whatever but the Lord laid it out gave us this place very very affordable for us we didn't realize how affordable it was until we started to realize that we'd have to leave from here so the property owners which is the school district here has sold this to developers and they were in the works for two or three years of planning to repurpose this property here so that would mean we would have to leave and so the we we knew that um they sent us the warning or the letter preparing us that we had we would have six months and so that would put us I think right around March or so the previous year they had given us six months or so but they weren't for sure and then they you know that had given us right around March or April of um that would have been of this this year and so 2023 we were really on the clock to trying to find a place and uh um I can't tell you the stress it is to think of where are we going to go you know and you know we can rent a school we can go to you know rent another place but then we looked and you know for square foot we're getting the best deal in the city what we're paying per square foot and so this little property on Mountain came up and I can't remember who found it but I know there sister Carina yes and so give her a high five at the end of the service and uh it sent it through she sent she sister Carlina has found many properties as brother Joe and others my wife this one we uh the first time I went there was in February and so brother John I I went there with him and we looked at it on Mount and and I didn't I likeed the property it was nice it didn't really catch my heart really I to be honest because it was so close to brother Caleb's work and I know of all of the Pastors in the city if I have a good work working relationship it is with brother Caleb donon and so um but just doing my diligence with him I had called him and told him that it's a possibility but it's it's not something that I really desire but we might have you know that might be the only thing on the market or so forth and he had just wonderful you know praise and Open Arms of uh you know just no problem at all brother Israel so we're friends and that respect and so um that was that was good but I still had a little reservation so brother Robert figuroa good friend of mine um um Pastor there in Fort wuka he called me and or sent me a text back this was in February about some meetings taking place in Wares the city of Wares and if you know Wares is one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico on the border murders happen all the time and and and so forth but that's besides the point he sent that invitation to me that um he would like to go there's an invitation there and the brother there would like for him and I to go but if I don't go that he probably wouldn't go you see how he did that and so I said I don't know and he says I'm not going to he said I'm not going to drive there by myself brother Israel so a week passed and I kind of left it and he called the brother and told him brother GTO I don't think it's going to work out for us to go the day he calls him that next Saturday that's when I finally call him I says brother Robert I think I might want to go with you so he called the brother and then they set it in motion so that was on a Friday we um his meetings were the 8th 9th and 10th that Friday the 8th was when I um took that trip but I had already saw the building with John and the rest of the board and Believers went and saw the building that I think it was that Friday morning is what it was and I couldn't be there with you all because I was going to those meetings so when I get uh go on this trip soon as I crossed the border and sat down in the meetings the Lord really impressed it upon my heart that I should be a part of these brothers lives more right here in Mexico they're they're right next to us I've always got an Open Door there um just follow the love is what I like to say wherever the love is go with that sometimes you want people to love you it ain't there go where the love is and so they've always always have an open door there and I've kind of neglected them I'd say and while in those meeting I said you know I need to make an effort to see my brothers down here a bit more and help them and you know maybe focused towards missionary work in a more comprehensive way the same time this brother Jonathan Miller the same March the 7th right in there March the eth he's trying to prepare for his Easter meetings he's in Jamaica and he was calling me while I'm on my way there so when the Lord deals with me on this giving and being a part of a missionary um deal this is when Jonathan is calling me and I told him I can't be gone from our church on Easter but if we can send someone would that be okay oh brother Israel yeah that'd be great so brother George was available contacted him he went there just had a wonderful time this little church took up an offering and uh supported that little Ministry there when we have our own needs here and so but the Lord just really impressed that upon my heart so after after that so after we made that commitment to um missionary work down in Mexico made the commitment to go to Jamaica then I get a email from our lease here that guess what we have an we might have another six months to a year and we don't have to worry about leaving now during the time when we were trying to figure out our dates and times we went and saw the property um I have an email where John sent to me and brother Chris a proposed offer for $900,000 is what we would offer that's what they were asking that's what we would offer for this property this building that was on a um that was on a Tuesday or Wednesday and then Wednesday night we had a meeting after the service if you all remember some of you remember about how we should do this our brother Chuck King was involved and the conditions of the church and what everybody thought and what we could afford and it was just um you know so that was on our mind that was on our heart and that was in the um the proposal and we thought well maybe we can offer $850,000 um the first proposal was $900,000 well after we made the commitment for the missionary work then you know they gave us another year basically another six months so this is in March also in March I started that little series on conduct order IND Doctrine and on that Wednesday night I believe I was in fasting and prayer and I did conduct I think there were six services on that order uh for four or five services on that and then on Doctrine just on Wednesday night 30 minutes 40 minutes or so um this particular service I know the amount of people because I started to count and brother Joe knew how many people were in the service there was 41 of us and I said how I said if this little group here would just pray and fast what God would do I said how many people here I started to count and Joe said 41 I said we got a counter in the room so he knew how how many people were here and I was looking at that service uh just the other night um just going back um and what I would like you to do you Believers you Saints is to pray and fast for my trip to Tanzania okay please do that for me I don't have to know it's you doing it just do it please if you can carve out a time to fast and pray and if you can get that service I'd like you to go back not to hear me but you hear your podcast whatever else you hear but so let me get off of that but take just take those quotations on fasting and prayer that I brought in that service and it'll bring you up to speed on what the word says about it and the power that's in it and so and that service was in October no that was in March the um the 13th 313 on a Wednesday night you get a chance to get that I know all of you didn't hear it because there's only 41 of you there okay um and now to set you in mind for the power of fasting and Pur so that conduct order and Doctrine I talked about the um one of the greatest singular carnal outlooks on determining the spirituality of an individual meaning if God is dealing with someone just on the outward we will be able to see that based simply upon your church attendance when God is dealing with someone you'll notice they'll start making it to the house of the Lord when the Believers gather together now that's not judging everybody that doesn't come or everybody that does come but it is an indication when God is dealing with someone they will be in the house of the Lord that's how we know you when I go visit other churches they'll say man he's been coming he was here last night he came last Sunday then we know God is dealing with you just an outward carnal thing and so that was in part of that conduct order and Doctrine but I'd like you to to get that oh sorry thank you musicians you can take your seats and and uh we spoke on the post of Duty and those things and uh I really believe that was the Lord leading us on that because I spoke on giving and in and that was in March we made that commitment we had start to write up an offer for 900,000 for this building and then here we are in December um we closed on that property I think we offered $480,000 and so in the space of nine months when we were about to or ready to offer to purchase a building that's worth every penny of it the Lord took in nine months time and cut the price of this building in half and so as I've heard Brother Scott say that's a Red Sea miracle and that is beyond anything that anyone can do or think we we sat in this room brother John and I with the with the developer himself we was in the back room there this is before our meetings and as we met there fine gentleman very wealthy man obviously and he was listening to our needs and what we want and and he made the suggestions that maybe you go pursue that property on mountain and so that's what we did John went and looked at that and saw it on the market reached out it's a different agent and um before the meetings they um wanted to offer $750,000 and they would carry us which is a blessing and and John said well let's talk about it after the meetings I said yes let's get through our meetings we get through our meetings that Monday morning um or Tuesday John gets a text that they uh would take $460,000 a cash offer just over the space of the meetings and I have to say that you know the the Integrity of brother John's testimony has been just really highlight ited through this process the the gentleman Marcel was going to lend us up to $100,000 or more not based on knowing us he doesn't know us but based on John's relationship same thing with how we got into the property how we were the first ones to look at it was the agent knew John and there was a relationship there so I really appreciate that he did a phenomenal job of just his detailing work and the Lord just really highlighted that to me that your name goes beyond and you just never know when you need someone and um when we were going to offer that here brother John put in the notes let's offer them 900,000 we'll ask them to give us a 100 days and he said they probably won't take it but that will tie up the property and we can find financing and we're going through all of that and this gentleman held on to it held on to it and waited to show anyone else the property just on the strength of John's testimony with him um and so as we were waiting and trying and finding then we find out that we didn't need to we had six more months and so in that six months time Look What the Lord Has Done For Us that after our meetings that Tuesday morning I had was having breakfast with a fine Brother that's Jesse Lynn's brother brother Jonathan and the Lord answered something in our time together uh with him something very private to me as we were uh sitting there talking and um the um that's when the text came about you know that they would take a cash offer and so forth few days later a week later it was on a Monday I have a dream and in this dream I see brother John let me see yes in this dream I I have I see brother John with a check for $10,500 and it was going towards the building fund and I looked at I was like man that's a lot of money for him to be giv to the church fund now that dream can still happen that way but that that wasn't aam cuz the dreams could compound so let's you know let's let let's let the Lord do what he wants to do but but in this dream I was thinking that's a lot of money John giving to the building fund wow $10,500 and so when we got ready to give the earnest money um and John told us we needed a check then it re it reminded me well that's that's what that deposit check should be for $10,500 and I placed that check in his hand right back here so so they accepted our offer and we closed on it on December the 12th and we give God praise for it now and so there's so much more I can say but with the building I'm praying for a Revival how many would prefer thank God for a building amen how many wants a Revival an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and if he can give me a building give us a building he can give me a Revival CU that's what I need amen amen amen God bless you each of you just a little bit of the testimony The Lord Is With Us amen so let's go into the word of the Lord just for a few moments and I'm going to take this title a word to the church as my title we'll read psalms 27 as a class together we'll stand and sing that I had I was going to make this just a very very short sermon then it kept growing it kept growing and I was going to just give a testimony and detail the dates and times but the lord gave me a little different direction and then I said well I'll split it and then it kept growing and growing and I had to cut it short and we trust that that um we'll get through this portion of the word for you today and look forward to the word tonight amen amen thank you I'll read the first verse you read the second verse verse we e read the last verse 14 Alto together the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me and this will I be confident for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock my be lifted up here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me hi not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation teach me thy way oh Lord lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord amen praise the Lord a word to the church found in Proverbs chapter 20 I believe it's where I want in verse number get it for you here verse 19 he that goeth about as a tail Bearer reveal Secrets therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips Proverbs 26 was the next scripture I wanted to to take and that's found in verse number 20 Proverbs 26 verse 20 where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no teral Bearer or gossiper or Tattler The Strife ceases may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated a word to the church and we're going to speak just a littleit bit about this tail Bearer the gossip okay and this is not a uh it's not a rebuke only if it is a rebuke okay brother bam was dealing with in a sermon here that he uh spoke on in the church in its condition he says this here in paragraph number 64 he says here one time I preached just as hard as I could preach in a certain city and there was thousands of people there I made an altar call I thought I covered the whole realm of sin I covered everything that I could think of that night after the service over a very prissy little woman walked by she said well brother brandham I'm sure glad that you didn't touch me tonight I thought that must be a real Christian said you didn't touch me tonight I said well I'm certainly glad to hear that lady you must be close to the kingdom of God and she tipped away some elderly lady standing there I said say do you know that woman yes I said she must be a real Christian said one thing you fail to hit tonight brother Brandon that was gossip she's the chief gossiper in the country there you are that's it see now we'll we'll take a Old Testament example if the Lord would help us just for a few moments with Absalon but and I start to look at this this gossip and what it does and the three uh individuals that are involved in it you you have the one that's doing the talking you have the one that's doing the listening and then you have the one that's being talked about and as you break these three Dynamics down we've uh it's 100% sure that somebody will bring gossip to you that's without question and it's also 100% sure that you will probably be the talked about now you being the one doing the talking the gossiper um we're probably all been guilty of it um if we'll be real honest we we love to gossip we love to talk about other people's matters but that's that's the person that you have control over you do not have control over someone wanting to bring gossip to you and you do not have control over someone talking about you and so as we look into this I like us to focus in on the part that we can control yes and that is this um lending the near you know the Proverbs is very clear on when the wood is gone the fire leaves all right and when you get rid of the tail Bearer then the fighting will stop yeah it's people talking it's the Chatters the back and forth it's talking on frivolous matters I think the definition of it is talking on matters that don't concern you I mean you can just be talking and chatting about the weather or whatever you're talking about but then when you go to try to influence matters or people or things that don't concern you that's when it goes over into the realm of Gossip so this is a very simple subject but it's very interesting if we look at what the human being is and we're going to do that in this message that brother brandom preached the um where he he says that we have the three rings that make up it's in the message the greatest battle ever fault paragraph number 68 he says this here see if I can get it here here I know they'll pick it up for me here and the greatest battle ever fought paragraph number 68 is where we'll start all right when this greatest battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battlegrounds begin in the human mind there's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was to begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some organization they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization can never never do the work of God because the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you I want this little girl here that's very sick to be sure to listen now to this real closely decisions are made in the mind the head there's where Satan meets you and the decisions are because that God made a man that way now I have you if you was looking on my Note here a little map drawn out I had had it here not long ago I use on the board the human being is made up just like a grain of wheat it's a seed and the human being is a seed physically you're the seed of your father and your mother and the life come from the Father the pulp come from the mother so the two together the egg and the blood comes together and in the blood cell is life and in there it begins develop making the child now any seed has a shell on the Outside Inside is the pulp and inside of the pulp is a germ of life well that's the way we're made we are Body Soul and Spirit the outside the body the shell the inside of that conscience and so forth is the soul and the inside of the soul is the spirit and the spirit governs all the other now if you'll see sit down when you get home and draw three little rings you'll find out that the outside body has five senses it's contacted by and that that is SE taste Fu smell here that's the five senses that control the human body inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations conscience memory reasons affection that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit it only has one sense the spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominates it is Faith or doubt so let's look at the diagram of That Body Soul and Spirit this is what makes up the human being the human being has got to be the most interesting creature on on the planet they're very very different and difficult to read the human being you can have you could your mama and your daddy who know you and you love them for 50 years 60 years 30 years your wife people you know siblings and you've known them your whole life and a f minute conversation can cause you to question whether this person loves you or not in five minutes time just a few a few a day or so and our whole 40-year relationship is on the Rocks it's in question because you're dealing with a human being and I can sit there and look at your body but I don't know what you're thinking and I don't know which way you're moving this is why the whole man has to be healed and it's only the new birth Earth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost can heal this individual look I can't trust I can't trust me so sir how can I expect you to trust me you said brother isra am I supposed to read your mind you don't want to read my mind I don't want to read your mind either you don't want to read your own mind this is why we got to be born again so that the mind of Christ will over and supersede my mind that's right so the problem always is the individual looking in the mirror okay you're in a room and the room has Mirrors all the way around you look up it's you you look it's you look over there and that is the problem you look down it's you it's you are the one and the complexity of a human being is so tremendous it's very we're very interesting but we can you know motive and intentions and where we're going what we're doing friend today and the next thing we in court yeah at the altar getting married today and then at the courthouse getting a divorce a brutal one yes very terrible one so much so the heart can be in love with someone and I'll live with you for the rest of my life and then a few few years later somebody murdered someone yes because a human being is just complex like that and the only way that you can handle them and deal with them you have to use the manual that tells you how to handle another man outside of this it don't make sense it will never make outside of this you won't make sense none of your friends will make sense all of the people around you will never make s but this manual here will tell you how to handle a man if my computer blows up I can s that to The Geek Squad my house you know electrical I call an electrician Plumbing a plumber who do I call to fix me all right he's difficult he's a creature that that that that can be the most trustworthy thing in the world and the least trustworthy thing in the world is a human being and in it's in this complexity that we have to handle one another through the instructions of God's word so this three points of of of what gossip does how brother ram calls it acid and how he speaks weeks of saying good things about one another and so he deals with this in uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed on what we call a word to the church many churches has it on their bulletin board and we have read it for you many times and we'll read it part of it again here this morning a word to the church paragraph 80 brother brandom says love one another above everything so he speaking to the Believers in his church love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way and it gives us how Satan will send someone and he'll shoot that person they they'll start something and then it that that thing that you hear wants you to take sides to it now you are responsible how you handle gossip that that responsibility is on you I'm going to let the prophet put that responsibility on you this is the reason and I have some quotes for you why some of our problems in trouble starts within us is because we're listening to something that we shouldn't be listening now you might not have been the one who said it but you listen to it and when you listen to it it now begins to to affect you now the prophet takes this in paragraph 82 says do you remember that the enemy will come when he does just cling that much closer together the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never Clan among or talk or make yourself clannish we are one look at your neighbor and tell them now we are one you're my brothers good to see you bagots God bless you young men all right we are one I couldn't say left him I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I wanted to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another now you got tapes on that got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church let's drop down to paragraph 86 if the brother you think is a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect him it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison aets of malice jealousy and hatred what does malice mean malice is intention to do evil it's ill will jealousy it's feeling or showing Envy of someone of their achievements feelings or suspicious of someone's unfaithfulness jealousy and then hatred is an intense dislike or ill will now don't raise your hand but how many of you got somebody you don't like how many human beings in here you know what we what we do what we do is like this group of human beings don't have the problems that that group of human beings have and what I want you to do is just stop talking because you don't know what you're talking about well when you're in the message uh we would never have the that I can't believe that could ever happen in the message if you're dealing with human beings you're going to have any problem that ever happened to any human being that's capable of happening doesn't matter which group you're part of what which what what what what what city what country they're how they you rich or poor the human being is a complex creature but he was made in the image of God and in the fall it messed him up and so he's partly carnal he's partly spir spiritual and we're trying to get back to the spiritual man as a son of Adam that's what we're trying to get back to but it's a progress It's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a road that we're on in our life to get to that place where we don't have any of those issues in our life amen and so is it's bitterness you don't want that to spring up jealousy hatred it would take the holy SP spirit away from you when you think about somebody you don't like and sometimes we'll say that you know I really don't like him I really don't like her well what is hatred hatred is an intense so it's you not liking them but it's intensified it's got to start somewhere it starts off you don't like him I don't favor him I don't favor her and then it intensifies and it turns into hatred and tell me you're going in the Rapture with hatred in your heart it ain't going to happen happen but it sounds more convenient that I don't like this I don't like the way he Le I don't like the way he I don't like the way she I don't like I don't like and then when that intensifies your dislike becomes hatred and if you hate your brother that's murder that's murder Saints on can I go a little bit further here you know motive and objective is so deep motive can determine the difference between a first-degree murder and a second deegree murder because the human being he's made up that way like if if it's a crime of passion if he loses his mind because of something very bad happened the the court system will look at that and says you know what he had a he had a valid motive he did wrong but it but it was valid but when but when the motive was from the beginning to commit the crime that's a different crime so your motive in everything that you do means everything you just don't give like that you give with the motive behind it and this is the complexity of the human being and this is the part where you are challenged to guard your ears from hearing the gossip that is the responsibility of the believer 100% 100% sure you will hear it 100% sure you will be talked about but you don't have to be the one doing the talking all right somebody he says that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle Hill it'll kill the spirit of God and drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together take the Buckle as the brother testified and Minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you how many believe that this morning yes sir yes sir so let's hear what the prophet of God says here in a couple of these messages yes he says in this message here why are people so tossed about paragraph 105 people go to church and they'll shake your hand in church laugh and call your brother outside the church they pull a little business deal that wouldn't be just exactly straight for personal game I don't say them people are here in the Tabernacle but I say there is there is things that people would do and they get different a a least little thing will bring that old temper back again that selfishness open up an ear to hear gossip or do something of that type that person has never entered into this pot in here there outside brother random continues the church and its condition 1956 paragraph 96 he says but you see the reason he couldn't abide you was a lamb then but when you become a wolf he had to take the flight nothing wrong with with the dove it's you you let that Spirit come to you did I let it brother brandom yes when you went to listening to that gossip when you listen to that lie when you went to is saying well I've got a right to and brother bam go goes on so listening to the gossip there is a responsibility for you to close your ears to it you got to move the conversation you got to redirect it it's it I mean you got to change the subject it's a skill set you have to develop as a Believer because your ears can't unhear the foolishness so if you can stop from hearing it in the beginning thank the Lord but Lord help me to guide my ears but I can't make people close their mouth but I can change the conversation or get out of there all right yes we will how many's heard something that you shouldn't have heard amen you hear people you know upset and they're talking about this brother talking about this sister talking about this church or that group and it's gossip it has no value to you it actually is going to stir you up it'll take Christ out of your life it is actually a wound against you that's why you got to go out of the presence of a tail Bearer because it's going to affect you you say I was just I didn't say nothing I just listen to them say it if you're listening to them say it and it's not right then get out of it how many can say Amen to that praise the Lord amen so you go to listening to that so how do you deal with it you got to lay that aside you know this is a uh it's the way for some people they just love talking other folks business it lifts them up maybe especially if it's you know something derogatory you know it's like it lifts it lifts them up it's a you it creates a focus on something that's not healthy it's not wholesome and and the scriptures actually really qualifies this busy body or this tail Bearer in 1 Peter chapter 4 and I want you to turn there with me in verse 15 now we might not dance today all right but we can sure say Amen to the word we're in such a time as that where it's easy to gossip easy I can talk about you and I probably have I'm looking at you just like you're looking at me but I'm looking at you when you don't know I'm looking at you too and I'm talking about you behind your back you say brother is if I could just be a fly on the wall and hear what they're saying you're a fly what if you heard it what you going to do with it that's probably why flies are crazy because of the things they do hear just run into a wall yeah because if you can hear what a fly heard you're running to a wall too you quit too do you really want to hear what they're saying about you really you know if if the approach is to edify I want that I actually don't want it I need that to edify if it's just garbage trash I don't need to hear it about me I don't need to hear it about brother I don't need to hear about sister I don't even need to hear it about my enemy has no value all right let's take the scripture here 1 Peter 4:15 but let none of you suffer as a what say it out loud help me Saints but let none of you suffer as a or a or a bunch of bad people there there's a bunch of bad people there or as a oo in other men's matters puts them all in the same group doesn't it murderer thief evildoer and he throws like I I was just saying I was just saying what everybody else was thinking I was just keeping it real you you're not keeping it real you're keeping the fire burning you're keeping the fighting to happen you're not stopping the fight you're continuing it to go on and the scriptures warns us against it amen amen amen now let's take this young man Absalon just for a moment he's found in 2 Samuel chapter 15 you know the history of Absalon a very complicated relationship there in Psalms 27 it says though my mother and my father forsake me when my mother and my father forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead me into a plain path why does the psalmist showing us that it is possible that mother and father can forsake you the people that love you the people that should be one with you they can't forsake you because this is the com complicatedness if that's a word of dealing with a human being they can turn on you it could be mother it could be father and these dynamics of love hate and all of those things that go into that three the Triune being of a man it it it it's a real deal and it's something that you know only a life of prayer can deliver you from that and um this in in 2 Samuel chapter what did I call 2 Samuel chapter 15 the scripture deals with this Absalon before we get there we get a little background on him remember he had a sister Tamar and a a a brother kind of like a step brother um by the name of what's his name Ammon and Ammon had forced his sister and created this great conflict in Absalon so Absalon took his sister Tamar in and she uh deal dwelt there with her shame and all of the stuff that took took place with Ammon and he held that in his heart for two years and the hurt and the pain or whatever it was the Vengeance rested in him for two whole years yes and it looks like we're okay it looks like the fire is out but when you're dealing with a human being the fire might not be out you think it's okay you think everything bygones be bygones but not when you're dealing with the human being and unforgiveness and holding grudges is like like I heard one preacher say it's like you drinking poison and expecting your enemy to die that's what what unforgiveness is like the sin of unforgiveness like you you're holding it in and that's the thing that's going to really release you and free you is when you can forgive somebody and you know he held this in for two years it's complicated he he you know he has this you know you know this uh position issue that he wanted to very handsome man beautiful and he holds this in for vengeance for his sister calls for the king's Sons to come they come ammon's heart is Merry he drinks wine and Absalon murders him he takes off into another city gersher for two years he was gone there or for three years he laid away in another city another town because he murdered the King's son but the David the king loved him it's like David why would you love him when he hates you well I'm a human being that's my problem that's the problem I'm dealing with a human being I'm dealing with emotions I'm dealing with complex issues he's a complex being the human being is it it doesn't make sense all the time David why don't you just get rid of this boy it's clear he disrespects you it's clear he trying to get you but David loved him yeah y can I preach a little bit we see these Dynamics all the time don't we and this is in the scripture and so David loves him joab his servant his lead man goes and gets him brings him back into uh Israel and he kind of apologizes verse 15 is where Absalon begins to really show himself verse one and it came to pass after this that Absalon prepared him chariots and horses 50 men to run before him and Absalon rose up early and Stood Beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then Absalon called The King and told him hey King you need to watch out for this is that what he did is that what he did where the Sunday school at where the people at you got y'all can't help me preach here this morning is that what Absalon y'all never heard this story before did Absalon open his heart to the king and tell him you know was really going on the people say no no no no no he used it to his Advantage didn't he controversy came to the king for judgment then Absalon called unto him and said of what City Art Thou and he said thy servant is one of the Trib tries of Israel and Absalon said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee absolon said moreover oh that I were made judge in the land that every man which had the suit or cause might come unto me and I would do him Justice and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obedience he put forth his hand took him kissed him and on this manner did Absalon to all Israel that came to the king for judgment so absolon stole the hearts of the men of Israel interesting huh you know this this if I was in charge or if I was married to him or if that was my wife or if that was my kids they ain't your kids you ain't in charge you're not the manager uh you know it's always you know the The Grass Is Always Greener until until you're on the other side you know this this issue is a problem that Harbors itself in the heart of human beings and it's got to be dealt with and you want the the Lord to really cleanse it out of you is that right Saints you know this um there's a little you know little um you know this this really this story really shows how you know this is the king is your daddy Absalon that's your pops he actually loves you but it wasn't enough for him was it can we take one more scripture here to look into this gentleman just for a moment 2 Samuel 14:25 but in all of Israel there was none to be so much praised as absolon for his Beauty from the soulle of his feet even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him and when he pulled his head for it was every year pulled it because the hair was heavy on him there he pull he weighed the hair of his head to 100 shekels after the king's weight and unto abelin there were born three sons and so he's a fine fellow handsome guy he's the King's son and actually the king loves him but Absalon has issues in his own heart and it really is that he is the problem I remember hearing this kind of a humor this this uh I guess these missionaries went to a remoter Island and they find this guy on the island all by himself and they go up to him and they notice behind him there's two buildings and they look like two churches they said there's only where's all the people he said well I'm the only one on this island only one ever been here I said what's that church over there he said oh that's the church I go to now that's my home Church what's that other church he said that's the church I used to go to so he split from himself y'all didn't get that let me is it cold outside it was only two churches to go to he's the only member and he split one of the churches but it's their fault and this really speaks to the problem that dwells within us when we can see that it's in us because we can't stop the Tattler and the whisperers but we can handle um how we react when we are talked about and who we allow to talk garbage to us do you imagine somebody bringing old rotten food and bringing it into your home and setting it in the living room you're like no you need to get that out of here take it out you move it out and that's that's what that's what gossip is like all right so here the prophet so but how do we deal with it Saints how do we deal with this we deal with this in the message enticing Spirits I like how the prophet of God says this wherefore seeing we are composed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily beset us that we might that we might run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endureed the cross despised the shame and sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God Jesus in his prayer said father I sanctify myself Jesus becom Sanctified to the church he could have gotten married but he didn't do it he become Sanctified he said sanctify them Father through the truth Thy word is the truth now let us lay aside every weight you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you ought not to talk oh God lay it there now let it let it there watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away yes watch the love of God Lick It Up watch that old selfishness the way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way you've talked about the people in the church lay it on the altar this morning and the fire of God will come down and take it right away and the Divine love will burn in its place you got sickness lay it on the altar Lord here it is created me a clean Spirit creating me a healing power see what God will do God will do it this morning our heavenly father we bow in thy presence in behalf of those at the altar let thy Grace rest upon each one of them Father lord I can't do it for them they've got to do it themselves no man can do it for them they have to do it alone let their souls now say in theirself oh God this temper I lay it down here Lord I'll never pick it up no matter what comes or goes I'll let it go from now on this tongue of mine that's been easy to take sides with a bunch of Gossip Lord I'm laying it down here I'll never pick it up again sanctify my tongue how many can say that this morning sanctify my tongue Lord let me feel the Angels coming through like Isaiah did when he said I'm of an unclean lips woe is me and the angel come and took the tongues and went to the Altar and got the coals of fire and laid it on his lips and sanctify him God sanctify every talker this morning that talks wrong and SS Discord granted Lord now that's a prayer that's a real prayer and it has to come not from the prophet it has to come not from a pastor but down in your soul that cry has to come out Lord sanctify my tongue that I would only talk the good things of God Amen Lord help us we lay it on the altar don't we that might just be the next level for your ministry for your parenting for the gift of God that might be the next thing that you need to do is ask the Lord to sanctify your tongue the thing that we say about other people the things that we say in idleness the talking the cheap talk that has no value to it Lord help us God help us sir this was the next step for Abraham he had to do something as I prepare to close he had to do something when the Lord had called him changed his name and then Sac you know the circumcision and all the obedience that Abraham did look at what the prophet says in proving his word 1965 now look at the hindrance that Abraham had first thing was his age 75 years old Sarah being 65 she was way past the change of life the menopause no doubt but what it stopped many years before he had lived with her as wife it was his half sister had probably taken her when she was just a girl in her teens and had married her and he had had no children she was absolutely Barren and now we find that to do this he had to separate himself from all the peoples who did not believe it in order to make it come to pass I don't mean to say you have to separate yourself from peoples but you have to separate yourself from All the gossip of unbelief and stay away from that when people says all those things don't happen that's a bunch of lunatic people there's no such a thing as that happening just close up your ears and walk away don't pay any attention to it how many can say Lord help me to close my ears don't you wish you had some invisible ear plugs huh that's now some of you Brothers might get in trouble with them cuz sis is talking something very very very very important to you and she repeats it and she repeats it are you listening to me yeah yeah I'm listening I'm listening what did I [Laughter] say but if I can have some invisible ear plugs that when the nonsense starts I just plug them right in but we don't have those yet do we look at your neighbor and say neighbor neighbor look at him good now say neighbor I love you I thank God for you I only want the best for you now don't that feel good to hear somebody tell you words like that now gossip if you tell it to the person you're talking about to their face is not gossip you're just probably keeping it real but when you tell those words of malice Envy hatred behind the back of someone that would qualify of gossip and and if you don't like someone let's put that in the category of where does hatred come from not liking intensified is hatred and if you hate them then you are not in line with the word of God you can't say you love God you can't say you love God him that you can't see but I would I would even add that you can see him because you see him right in the word he tells you what you're supposed to be doing it tells you how to handle your brother your sister it's a slippery it's a slippery you know channel to get into those conversation you know sometimes we'll we'll we'll slap a bow on our gossip with so that we can be praying for them you done ran them down open up personal details of their life put it on the screen out to other ears that don't need to hear it and then parents gossip in front of their children damaging damaging open up with gossip in front of their children slander say all that you want to say and then try to wrap it all up I'm just only saying that so you can be praying for him well did you pray for him first if you didn't start it with prayer don't try to wrap it up with let's so that we can be praying for why don't you pray for him first then you probably won't even gossip you know as a pastor or Minister you go to different areas in in your travels so you get details about people you don't always want to hear but people want to share stuff with you and I remember very clearly I was out out of the country and doing some meetings actually with brother Wesco and this couple came to me and wanted to share with me some things that they were going through and they started getting deep into their Grievances and troubles and problems in the church and with that family and the troubles within themselves and I simply asked him have you talked with your pastor about this yeah he wouldn't understand no no no no we're g to stop this right now and it's a temptation to want to hear the goodies the information of what's going on in somebody else's church but when you listen to that it's cheap it has no value to it and the Holy Spirit is not pleased you got to put that in check it takes a discipline to do that you have to you have to have a set of rules in your spirit to deal with that hey little a sister want to come hey brother I need to tell you something but my husband oh oh wait oh no no no there's a right there's a right way to do this we're not going to we're not going to sit up and hear you talking bad about your husband like that no this there's a right way to do this there's a discipline we got to follow cuz words have spirits and some of the B biggest gossipers can I say it brother George some of the biggest gossipers are preachers that's they know they know they know y'all want me to close come on I'm going to Africa the three preachers were confessing their sins to one another and one said I just have a problem I still drink just a little bit and get out there and drink oh man really yeah yeah yeah man pray for me the other one says you know I have a problem with women I still lust quite a bit oh yeah pray for me the third one what's your problem I got a problem with gossip can y'all pray for me no we should let you talk first that's what we should have did yes sir I don't want to be a gossiper and I don't want to listen to No gossip I don't want to be a gossiper I don't want to listen listen to No gossip I don't want to listen to No gossip if you have a prayer request if you have something of value bring that I do not am not interested in hearing any gossip about anybody please put that Banner over my head don't come to me with gossip cuz there's other motives behind it but if you have a concern or prayer or something that's edifying we all need that is that right Saints God bless you so much God bless you richly we did I finish Absalon no I didn't you can finish Absalon in 2 Samuel chapter 15 and he deals and he calls this a great conspiracy because he weaved his way in there and he got people that would hear it and listen I don't want to be a part of that I really don't I've gossa before and I ask the Lord to help me I'm a talker I like to talk but I just don't want that on me so I want to lay that thing on the altar this morning and ask the Holy Spirit to let the fire sanctify my tongue this morning God bless you so much let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father father ask your blessings upon your people today these simple words and the Saints there in Phoenix Lord Jesus just simple words of what we already know but it's a warning to us to talk nice about one another and that what is our motive in talking about it what's the motive behind the conversation what's the objective sometimes we have to say things that are uncomfortable inconvenient in order to get to to the solution but what's the motive Lord and if it's just frivolous talk Talking other people's matters have mercy upon us I pray that that the Holy Ghost would come in our midst Lord and not hinder the move in this little church is my prayer granted oh God we pray and ask in Jesus name amen God bless you now how many of you will be praying for me please take a little time I ask Sean to pray for me I'm I think it's 32 hours travel the one way 32 or 34 hours traveling Atlanta Amsterdam to East Africa and then coming back and I just need the Lord's wisdom and guidance as I travel I really want to be a blessing to the people I didn't ask myself to go it was the door that opened and it every time we've tried to give the Lord has blessed us in our giving and we thank God
