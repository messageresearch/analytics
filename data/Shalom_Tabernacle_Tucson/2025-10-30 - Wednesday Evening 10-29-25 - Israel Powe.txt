Mother Williams and and uh dear daughter there. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [applause] Amen. In the scripture, we like to just take a scripture in Hebrews 11 and verse one. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that his he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaketh. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death. It was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God. But without faith, it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a what? &gt;&gt; rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Not part-time seek him, but diligently seek him. And that's what we want to be as a diligent seeker of the most high God. So, God bless you. You may be seated. Um, we're going to take just a few moments and remind you of our meetings coming. There's a service this Saturday. I will be at in the tabernacle de Shalom. Shalom Tabernacle in Wararez. The pastor is Caesar Seyz. And I met him at that at that meeting that we were at there for um in Wores when I was the Lord put it on my heart to do more missionary work. He was in that meeting. I met him. He's been inviting me ever since and he has his I don't know what meeting this his annual meeting and I decided that I would I told him I would come. So I'll be there Saturday. you pray for me that I can make it back at an appropriate time on Sunday. But Sunday morning, we have a a friend of mine coming to speak for us, brother from brother um brother um October Ordonius's church there in Phoenix. Um um brother oh my Oh, it'll come to me. Anyways, he's he's spoke in Mesa before and he's been around. I don't think he's ever spoke for us. Very qualified speaker, young man. He's the assistant pastor for brother Ardonz. &gt;&gt; Elijah. &gt;&gt; No, not our brother Elijah. His brother um yeah to come to me just a minute. But um he is a good friend even though I can't remember his name, but uh he'll be speaking for us Sunday morning, the Lord willing. So we look forward to that and um we trust that each of you the Lord will bless you richly and give you what you Yeah. Louise uh Aguilar. Brother Luis Aguilar. Thank you. He'll be speaking for us on Sunday morning. The Lord willing. Now this this morning enjoy the service Sunday night. How many enjoyed that? brother Nathaniel Barrett and he was sharing those wonderful things with us about the messenger and um the great mysteries that have been revealed to us. [snorts] And tonight I wanted to take a portion of what we were talking about the last couple of Sundays on this timing and the word and the advancement that the Lord has brought the church through and brought us to. Oh my. So, um, [cough] in this message, the countdown, we [clears throat] listened to part of it. Um, the first one that Brother Brandon preached in 1962. He uses um, uh, some words in there that I really, really love. And I just want to go right into that. and he's typing the modern scientific achievements with the achievements that God had in building his church that he um uh the automobile from the horse and buggy to the automobile to the airplane and then to the astronaut. and how these horsepowers continue to get greater and greater and greater. And I did a real just a real quick casual search over some of the achievements that science has achieved since 1965. They're just innumerable. uh two of them that I will mention tonight was this um invention or the discovery of the DNA and its the genetic profiles and how that works and the researchers that found it. We don't really know who they are. We don't really some of us really don't care. But uh it has been profound for the medical community and for uh law enforcement. It's been able to identify the human being and really give us each our own specific profile. And since this discovery in 60 after 65 there in 70 something I think in the 80s they started to implement this and there [sighs] are over 600 cases of people that were convicted of crimes that have been exonerated. So these are people that were went through the legal system, through the courts, the judic judicial system, attorneys, laws, arguments, testimonies, proofs. He did it. No, he didn't do it. Prove me wrong. They were proven wrong, found guilty in a court of law. But this discovery of the DNA evidence um now comes on the scene and exonerates them. Now, that wouldn't make you happy unless it worked in your favor. &gt;&gt; And you would be so glad that somebody did the research. &gt;&gt; Somebody you don't even know. &gt;&gt; Somebody in a lab coat, maybe a four eyes and a no-name just working behind in some cubicle. Research, research, research, research. Aha. They find this. And then in the medical community community they were able to be able to dictate uh uh determine or find diseases early on cystic fibrosis is one of them amongst children that the average lifespan 20 years after this discovery being able to treat it early um moved their lifespan to over 50 years. &gt;&gt; Now if you had a child that had that you would be really praising the Lord &gt;&gt; for this discovery. Is that right? Somebody you don't know, somebody we don't even care about, a no-name, whatever. But they did the research, they tapped into it, and as real good research does, and real good um openings like this, it benefits people far beyond the people that find these things. And so, um, Brother Brandham brings that correlation with science and the church and how, and he makes this statement, and I read it for us on Sunday. Um, and I wonder if I can pick it up really quickly. I apologize. Sharon, can you get my Well, Levi, get my iPad off the desk. I try to prevent it because I think I have it on my phone. Make sure I don't have it in my pocket this time if Levi can get that for me. But he said, "The church really should be further up the road." Said that in 1964. We really should be further up the road. Now science has taken their discoveries and they have advanced so that 10 years ago they are well advanced than what today than what they are what they were 10 years ago. &gt;&gt; And I believe that the scientists on a carnal level if they could advance what about the believer? Are we are we supposed to be doing what the old believers did 10 years ago? Thank you. Or should we be further advanced? &gt;&gt; Luther was an advancement from the Reformation. Wesley was a further advancement from Luther. The Pentecostals were a further advancement from the Wesleyans. The message of the hour is a further advancement. The believers of the first generation ministers and pastors of this message should be a further advancement. Um, today we should be a further advancement than they were 30 years ago. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. I remember when I came in, and I've said this many times, that when I came in, the tape library was the main source of getting your message. A church had a tape library in the back, and you would check out a tape and or two, and this is where you got the voice of the prophet from. Very few had the entire message in their hand or the library. And then you'd have what they call the lending libraries and you have your own personal libraries that you would build yourself. How many started building your own tape library? We started that 50s or the 60s, however you did it. I started it and building that and building that. And that was real. That was a real life experience. You know, a tape recorder and a tape. You needed two of those components in order to hear the prophet preach. You needed a tape recorder and the tape. Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; And you needed electricity. &gt;&gt; And [sighs] thank the Lord we were able to do that. And we did that. No complaints. No complaints. We did that and then the Lord um advanced that for us. And we had in those days quote books. How many remember quote books? &gt;&gt; The golden nuggets. How many remember golden nuggets? &gt;&gt; Some of those quote books. And these brothers, great men that would take their time painstakingly listen to tapes, pull them out, and put the a subject matter of marriage and divorce, whatever it was, put it in a quote book. Oh, if you can get your hands on one, man, you'd be a lucky guy. And then [sighs] the computer has come forth and uh through the computer the message is downloaded on the computer and now it's downloaded on our phones and now it's hard to find a a message believer that comes into the message that does not instantly &gt;&gt; have all the message and sermons of the Reverend William Brham at their disposal. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you tell me a young man or a young Christian coming to the Lord 30 years ago, working through the details of checking out tapes, sending for books, sending for tapes in Jeffersonville, waiting a week or so for those to come, then go home because you couldn't play all of those tapes mobile. You had to be in your car or at home. And then that believer that died in that generation went through those details and all the painstaking whatever it was to hear the prophet. And then you translate and you and we're all in this seventh age. You take those believers and you fast forward to today and how easy it has become to hear the message of the prophet. You tell me. I mean I'm just asking the question. Is God going to judge us the same? &gt;&gt; Yes. No. No. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Clean it up, brother Art. Yes. You you you tell me. We're sitting in we're sitting in the court of law. We're sitting in court. And here's the evidence. This is what the tools I had to work with as a young pastor 1980. And this is what the pastors in 2025 had to work with. You tell me. &gt;&gt; If God was going to judge us, would he judge us the same? &gt;&gt; Is this a question I would ask? So, we're sitting in the most comfortable &gt;&gt; position as far as a believer being able to hear the word of the Lord. It has never been easier &gt;&gt; than the age that you and I live in right now. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; It's easier to get to the prayer meeting today than any other age. &gt;&gt; And people still can't make it. &gt;&gt; You tell me. a just God, how he would judge us on that. But God has been so good to us. &gt;&gt; He's advanced us. He's given us these great and tremendous um truths to help us serve him better. Now in the message uh God hiding or or in the message um countdown the prophet of God says this paragraph number 60 and remember the messenger is always comes at the end of the message. We know in the church ages there how we got that. Now the horse and buggy days was who that was the ending of the Lutheran age. see horse and buggy days. They believed in justification. God bringing the church from Romanism, Catholicism, he brought it into its first spiritual achievement. The just shall live by faith. That was the horse and buggy days. As they come to the horse and buggy days that ended. Now the next achievement man had in the way of transportation was the automobile. You notice the automobile increases all the time in its power. Now at the end of the Wesleyan age, Wesley age brought in by spiritual achievement, sanctification, which means a church raised from a justified state to a sanctified state. Now I want you to remember this as we go along that the church called church is not the church. The church is church spiritual. Tens of thousands times thousands of Lutheran that join the church know no more about justification than a hog note about a side saddle. They know nothing of it. And in the Wesley age, how the tens of thousands profess sanctification that knowed no more about sanctifying power of God than a rabbit does about snowshoes. See, they absolutely didn't know. But there was a people who achieved it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see where I'm getting to? There was somebody that knowed what justified meant in the sight of God. having peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. There were some of those Lutheran who were loyal. They believed it. No matter what the Catholic Church said, they believed God's word and stood on it because the messenger of that age preached, "The just shall live by faith." And they believed in a justified state. And they was able by the grace of God to achieve justification and have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Paragraph 66. We notice again long come Methodists with sanctification. There's many of those Methodists that was actually sanctified. There's a lot of them claimed it and know nothing about it. The Methodist church taught sanctification. They said they got down and cried and got back up and said, "Glory to God, I'm sanctified." And they read right on living like they always did. But some of those men and women was actually sanctified from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lived a consecrated set aside life. &gt;&gt; Why? That was the automobile age which took in more horsepower. Paragraph 67. Now we take men like the uh uh uh the men who would been a greater man than the old brother Bevington and look at John Wesley, George Whitfield, Finny Knox, many of those old Methodists who sweated it out. They went through hell on earth torment because they believe that God's word taught sanctification, the second step of grace. And they stayed with it and they believed it and they done wonders with it. Just the same as Henry Ford and them done with transportation of the old Model T. The Model T forward up the side of the horse. He moved on above the horse day. Wesley moved on above the Lutheran day. Then along come Pentecost. And that's science of the world was able to achieve in an automobile motor. The Wright brothers brothers that created and made and manufactured rather the airplane. The flying machine was far above the car on the earth because he took to the air. Now the Wright brothers through their achievement was able to take science and pattern something here on earth to show that there was a great spiritual thing fixing to happen &gt;&gt; when the Wright brothers was able to achieve to get a man's feet off the ground. Pentecost fell and took to the air with the spiritual gift with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He took to the air. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Got his feet off the ground so he could swim around. Got up in the air. Oh, how far he was above the horse and buggy. Let me stop there. So, we see the prophet showing us through science and through the ages how it was a constant advancement, not going backwards, but moving forward. More grace, more power, more spiritual power. and he's typing that to the church. Now he moves forward and says this in paragraph number 69. He says, "Now if Wesley hadn't have stepped out on the word and got a bad name behind him, it was called a crazy man and everything else he would have never been able to achieve. But Wesley was one of God's great scientists. Luther was one of God's great scientists. They didn't care what the churches said, what the organization said. Luther didn't care what the Catholics said. He believed the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he took God's chemicals of the word &gt;&gt; and he put it together. And the church moved by faith. Wesley put it together by the blood and proved it by the blood and the church got sanctified. The Pentecostals believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the promise is to you and your children and them that's a far off and they put the chemicals together out of the word and they moved into the air. Hallelujah. They moved out because they were able to accomplish such. Now, I love this in Hebrews 11 because faith is the chemical. Faith is the substance that the worlds were framed by. It is the substance that gives the elders a good report. It is the substance that pleases God. It is the substance that is in the word that we can take the word and with the chemicals of the word find the answer to your problems in your life. You see, it's by faith we achieve all things. And in this message or one of the other uh uh uh messages on the countdown, Brother Brandon makes this statement. He says, "At any time a believer ever takes God at his word, God will bring that word to pass." So, it doesn't even matter what age they're in. &gt;&gt; In the Lutheran age, there were some of those saints that saw miracles, signs, and wonders. It wasn't the age for it, but some believers found it in the word, and it worked for them. &gt;&gt; Same thing in the Wesleyan age. Same thing in the Pentecostal age, and this age that we live in today. And so many times we're waiting on the group to catch the revelation when really God has given us his word that we're supposed to live by. &gt;&gt; Every word &gt;&gt; here. God takes the message, the entire message, and places it into our hands 247 access to it. AND NOW GO MAKE IT WORK. You see, we've complained about the elders and the others, and we've complained and criticized the others, and we've said they didn't do it, or this one didn't do it. But you have the word now. &gt;&gt; You go do it. &gt;&gt; And who is holding you back? Who is stopping you? It can't be a church, can't be a pastor, it can't be your group that's around you because all things are possible to them that believe. And God is giving you this word. I believe this needs to be taken more personal. &gt;&gt; I believe that when you open up the Bible, there's chemicals that work together if you can find them. &gt;&gt; And the believer doesn't operate like science does. Science operates through education. Believers operates through revelation. &gt;&gt; This is something AI can't do for you. This is something that Google cannot give you. This is something that no college degree, no college campus, no book, no learning can ever give you is a revelation. Revelation comes from God. And Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I will build not anybody's church, but my church. I'm going to build my church upon divine spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; It means more to the believer than perhaps we real we realize. So when we're reading the word uh we want a revelation of that word. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We want to go deeper into it and it's unlimited what we can have. So we take the chemicals of the word. Paragraph number 70, brother Bham says this. I'll just take a few more moments and share out of this message countdown. He says, "Why did these men do this? Why did Luther find it? Why did Wesley find it? Why did these others? Because the material was laying here on the earth that could make a T model Ford. There was electricity that could make a car to run. There was gasoline in the earth. There was pistons. and so forth. All the mechanics, the carbon for the generator and everything they had to have to create this stuff. And notice it manufactured it rather not uh rather not create it. God is the creator. He had it laying here. The man who believed it in the scientific realm or the natural progged and into it and they wouldn't take no for an answer. They believed it. &gt;&gt; It was a revelation in their hearts and they stayed with it until they proved that it was right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, one of the most successful Kirby salesman, vacuum salesman, he was a trainer. He was a believer in this message. He lived in Phoenix for some time and then he moved to Jasper, Texas. Um um fine brother. Um I was going to mention his name, but anyways, it doesn't matter. And so they they would fly him around the country to to teach other Kirby sales vacuuming how to make a better sale, increase their numbers. And he was so exited out and I was asking him this brother. I said, "So what's the big secret?" He says, "The secret to selling the most vacuums, a Kirby vacuum, is simply this. When you go to that door, you simply don't take no for an answer. You listen to them say no. They're going to tell you no many times, but just don't accept it as an answer. And you just stay there. You keep moving with them, changing the price, changing the subject. Wear them down. Wear them down. Wear them out. Do you want to buy this? No. Okay, let's keep on talking. Keep on talking. It's a matter of me winning. &gt;&gt; You want me to leave? I'm not going to leave. If this is in my mind, I'm not going to take no for an answer. and his sales numbers was way up here and everybody was down here. And that was his key. Do not take no for an answer. WHAT IF WE APPROACH GOD'S WORD THAT WAY? WHAT IF WE APPROACH EVERY PROMISE? I'M SICK IN my body. I GOT TROUBLES IN MY HOME. I GOT PROBLEMS IN MY LIFE. BUT I WILL [screaming] NOT ACCEPT NO FOR AN ANSWER. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD TODAY. I'M going to take him AT HIS WORD TOMORROW. I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD FOREVER. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THEY won't say take no for an answer. &gt;&gt; Take that key. &gt;&gt; Take it with you. &gt;&gt; Brother Bandham says it here. They wouldn't take no for an answer. Look at your neighbor and tell them. Don't take no for an answer. Oh my. Y'all better than Sunday morning. Thank you. Paragraph 72. You know, a believer has to be tenacious. A believer has to have something that's moving them. If it's just education, it's going to fail you. But if you have a revelation that's MOVING YOU &gt;&gt; THAT GOD keeps his word, then you will not take no for an answer. EVEN IF NOBODY ELSE IN THE CHURCH EVER experienced it, you will become the first one to EXPERIENCE IT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD PROMISED IT IN HIS WORD. IT'S BEEN REVEALED IN MY HEART. AND THIS IS WHAT GOD BUILDS HIS CHURCH UPON. NOT ARGUING QUOTES, NOT arguing scriptures, not an intellectual, NOT EDUCATION, BUT A REVELATION which the youngest one to the oldest one can receive &gt;&gt; is a divine revelation. And that's what God builds his church upon. &gt;&gt; He built it upon re revelation. &gt;&gt; You know that you know that you know. &gt;&gt; Can you explain it all? No. But I know it's true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet moves forward here. Paragraph 72. Did you notice one of those scientific achievements accompanied the other one? Complimemented the other one. It was only a higher form. The automobile was a higher form of transportation than the horse. The airplane was a higher form of transportation than the automobile. But they accompanied one another. Horsepower. Amen. If that's horsepower, what about God power? &gt;&gt; What about the Holy Ghost and power? I wonder if us church folks really believe in the Holy Ghost and power &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost still has power. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Power to change your attitude. &gt;&gt; Power to change your way of thinking. &gt;&gt; That's selfish. &gt;&gt; POWER TO GIVE YOU FAITH to believe that these things are true. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in power. &gt;&gt; It'll change a man. &gt;&gt; It'll heal any disease. It'll heal autism. &gt;&gt; It'll heal cancer, &gt;&gt; AIDS. &gt;&gt; Even the dead can be raised again. I'm talking about the I'm talking about what we're preaching today. &gt;&gt; It is the answer. &gt;&gt; The doctors have all these answers. This prescription and another prescription and another kind of prescription for this for you to feel good or to live with your pain and live with your problem. And I thank the Lord for all the prescriptions. But what about the real doctor? &gt;&gt; That's I mean we're talking about a medical doctor. They they've advanced. YES. THANK THE LORD FOR THEM. They've advanced. YES. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WHAT ABOUT THE REAL DOCTOR IN THE HOLY GHOST CHURCH? &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT IS THAT [screaming] IS THAT DOCTOR STILL AMONG US? &gt;&gt; IS HE STILL THE HEALER? &gt;&gt; YES, HE'S THE HEALER. &gt;&gt; NOT SOME SYMPTOMS. ALL DISEASES, &gt;&gt; mental health, &gt;&gt; personal trauma, &gt;&gt; issues, situations. He's the healer. &gt;&gt; That's the God we're talking about. &gt;&gt; We believe in the Holy Ghost and power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paragraph 78. Science has been able to approve Sorry. Go back to paragraph 72. Excuse me. Holy Ghost and power that can justify you. The same Holy Ghost power can sanctify you. The same Holy Ghost power that sanctifies you can fill you with his presence. A little science that didn't know their ABCs found it. Why? They were spiritual scientists. Amen. Then they seen the thing. Do you believe this was a spiritual scientist right here? &gt;&gt; He did something that nobody could do. &gt;&gt; God used him. He got into the chemicals of the word. He said there'll be a little gray squirrel appear right there. &gt;&gt; And with things that was not seen was made visible. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE IT. WHAT KIND OF SCIENCE? WHAT KIND OF A S WHAT KIND OF laboratory was brother Brandon working in? He's out IN THE FIELD. THERE WAS NO SQUIRRELS. There was none around. Then he says, "There will be a squirrel." [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's the leader of the church that we are following, saints. &gt;&gt; That's the bishop of our church. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE LEADER. &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL HIS FOLLOWERS LOOK LIKE? &gt;&gt; They ain't dead, cold, and formal. &gt;&gt; They ain't half asleep. No, no. Taking God at his word, believing that all things are possible to them that believe. It took science has been able to prove that there's an astronaut that can go so far till you couldn't see it with your natural eyes. And it could go whether there's any pressure there or not. He can go on out because in a pressurized tank. That's paragraph 78. And he can go up there and sail around and see and see the worlds around. An astronaut. Oh my. What an age that that is coming. Yes, sir. Go beyond any natural things at all and sweep plum on out into yonder. What does it represent? a spiritual age, a spiritual time to where God is going to have what? &gt;&gt; Spiritual astronauts, &gt;&gt; singular or plural? &gt;&gt; Plural. &gt;&gt; There's more than one. &gt;&gt; They couldn't deal with that one. &gt;&gt; Wait till there's another group of them that's doing exactly what that one said that we would be doing. &gt;&gt; That was just the first fruits. What about when the church really begins to hear those words and take what he said to heart and believe it with all their heart? Satan will be powerless &gt;&gt; before that true church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A spiritual age, a spiritual time where God is going to have spiritual astronauts. Amen. They're right. They're here right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The eagles of the air that can go beyond any other bird. &gt;&gt; SELL ABOVE EVERYTHING. SPIRITUAL ASTRONAUTS. GLORY. That can take the word of God and prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. A spiritual astronaut. &gt;&gt; Oh my glory. That makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living in this age. &gt;&gt; Not what a wonderful thing. Now, what a wonderful thing for a spiritual astronaut. Look what he says here. Paragraph 85. Remember, the astronaut is controlled by a radar. Can you all help me close this message? Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The astronaut is controlled by a radar. I'm reading quote paragraph 85. You seen them bring John Glenn in? I looked down at a Cape Cannibal Cannibal and seen that great big radar thing and you couldn't even see him nowhere, but you can tell where he was by the way the radar was pointing. That's where he was at. See, and we got a radar, too. Prayer. &gt;&gt; Prayer is the radar power &gt;&gt; that directs the astronaut. Ask the Father anything in my name, I'll do it. See, just watch the way the prayer's going. You can see the way he's pointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just watch the way the church is praying. You can see the way the missiles will fly. &gt;&gt; You can tell by the way the astronauts are traveling by the way the church is praying. &gt;&gt; Is this church praying? That's a question for you saints. &gt;&gt; Is this a praying church &gt;&gt; and not just your individual prayer? I'm talking about praying for the body of believers. Would you classify this as a praying body of believers? Or are we just talkers and gossipers uh uh spreading information, communication, talking, chatting, whispering? or are we really a praying church? What would you prefer to have to be a part of? A larger church &gt;&gt; or a praying church? &gt;&gt; Don't you want people in your life that know how to pray &gt;&gt; THAT CAN PRAY &gt;&gt; FOR THE POWER [screaming] OF GOD &gt;&gt; TO COME ON THE SERVICE? &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of our attitudes is because we don't pray. &gt;&gt; A lot OF OUR ISSUES AND PROBLEMS IS BECAUSE OUR RADAR IS [screaming] OFF. WE'RE NOT IN PRAYER LIKE WE SHOULD BE. WE'RE LED BY [screaming] PRAYER. IT'S THE KEY THAT GOD USES for us to communicate to our heavenly father all of the things we can do too much. I can preach too much. You can sing too much. You can be quiet too much. &gt;&gt; But you can't pray too much. &gt;&gt; Is this A PRAYING CHURCH? AM I A PRAYING PASTOR? DO I [screaming] HAVE PRAYING DEACONS? ARE THE MUSICIANS PRAYER WARRIORS? ARE [screaming] THE MAMAS IN THIS CHURCH [groaning] PRAYER WARRIORS? &gt;&gt; That's what's leading and guiding any church. That's what's God in your household. That's guiding your spiritual condition. &gt;&gt; You might be indifferent. You might be upset even at my voice. You might be upset at the way the church is going and way it's not going. You might get upset at this one or that one and hold a little funny, but if you're in PRAYER AND YOU HAVE A LIFE OF PRAYER OVER YOU, IT CHANGES your atmosphere. &gt;&gt; People don't get to you so quickly. &gt;&gt; They don't poke on you so easily. They don't annoy you so much &gt;&gt; when you're in prayer &gt;&gt; because because prayer brings you up on a higher level than the average church members &gt;&gt; and the horse and buggy and the little Honda Accord or whatever it is. &gt;&gt; We're astronauts &gt;&gt; flying above even an airplane. &gt;&gt; I love that. We wanted some big great chemical. Give me a chemical out of the word that's going to change me. Here's one prayer. &gt;&gt; They took the chemicals of the word and they pulled it out and they made it happen in their life. That's what this is. This is a prayer meeting tonight. I trust we can go into prayer. If we never be identified by any other thing, we the church with the best whatever, nicest whatever, most classified whatever. Oh, but don't you want to be a church that has a love of God in their heart, &gt;&gt; that knows how to pray? If not anything else, if I couldn't preach an interesting message ever again, if the ministry here was never indepth or deep enough for some of you Eagles, if the music program was not as qualified and gifted and talented as it should be. If the exterior and the interior of the building wasn't up to par like how it probably should be, if all those things fail, trustees, deacons, Sunday school department is the workst, weakest one in the city. If all of our brothers and sisters are the poorest, the least whatever. If all those things were true, but we were the most praying, most prayerful church, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you desire that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Wouldn't that get you somewhere? &gt;&gt; This is what moved Cornelius, who was not even a believer, BUT HIS PRAYER LIFE AND HIS GIVING, GOD LOOKED UPON him &gt;&gt; and remembered him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer is the key, saints. &gt;&gt; You stomp out of a service upset and mad. You come in upset and mad. Like I said, the song says they come empty-handed, empty-hearted, and empty-headed. And they leave that same way, too. &gt;&gt; But when we come here [sighs] with a prayer and the word of the Lord over our life, it changes us. &gt;&gt; A man that's in prayer can deal with difficult people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I right about it, saints? Amen. &gt;&gt; A man that has his life, a sister that has her life in prayer can deal with a cold shoulder, &gt;&gt; can deal with the eye rolls, &gt;&gt; deal with all of the the issues of other people's because your life is in prayer. So help us, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; to get us into that atmosphere beyond church membership into the astronauts, spiritual astronauts &gt;&gt; plural. He said not just one, there's more. God help us to be that to take the chemicals of the word. God bless you so much tonight. Um we have a few requests here that we want to go through mention to you for prayer. If the musicians come, thank you. Remember that uh men's trip to sunset is on this Friday and I believe they have all the brothers that are going are set to go and we want to be in prayer for them and if I know brother Art will be there. Brother Art, if you can you get a time of prayer there with this brothers, remember us. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many would like them brothers in that holy place to remember you in prayer? &gt;&gt; Oh, call my name out in prayer. Call these saints out in prayer. Amen. There is a sister Tila asked for prayer. the little sister that sits here, she is in great a great deal of pain also for brother Jonathan. Um he's working double shifts and and they car repairs. They have need of car repairs. Brother Jonathan has been ill in his body as well. He's been sick and working, overworking. They ask for prayer for Tila and brother Jonathan and also for our November meetings. the speakers that are on the flyer there, all those brothers. And for the move of the Holy Spirit, um we're trying to put together a [sighs] photo album and um for the meetings, memory from the past year's 2016 forward. If you have those, please get those to Sister Heather. She's working with Aaliyah on getting those put together. There was a notification sent on the WhatsApp app [clears throat] and so I don't know if everybody is on there or there everybody should but just a reminder anyways to get those to sister Heather. All right. Was there a request we want to mention here? Anyone had a prayer request? Yes. &gt;&gt; Remember Nathaniel in prayer. Someone else have a request tonight. All right. So, we'll go to the Lord. Remember? Yes, brother Jonathan. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Jonathan's asking for prayer. The devil's really after him, trying to discourage him and attack him. single man trying to serve the Lord living alone and um he's asking for your prayer. So we will pray with him and for him tonight and also always pray for one another. The elders, the youth, everyone you pray for each one. Amen. Is there someone else that has a request? All right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Correct. tremendous hurricane. I heard from brother Jonathan. I text him. He said they were doing okay. He didn't answer my call, which he normally does. He said the believers are doing fine or or they're okay so far, but we want to keep them in prayer. I'm going to talk to him again. And so remember them. Is there someone else? Yes, brother. &gt;&gt; Yes. keep Sister Melissa in prayer with her friend as they as they travel. Amen. So, we'll stand to our feet and we'll go to the Lord in prayer. Maybe we'll sing. Remember Aaliyah? She's at home. She bumped her head. And um just each one all of our families, they need a touch from the Lord. Enemies like a roaring lion. Just doesn't stop. Amen. So we'll sing pleasing. Let me be pleasing to you. [music] pleasing baby. [singing] Please sing [music] to you. Let [singing] that I do [music] be pleasing [singing] to you. Oh pray let everything I pursue [music] be pleasing [singing] oh Lord [music] and to you oh [singing] pleasing &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let me be [singing] pleasing to you. Let everything [music] I [singing] do, Lord, be pleasing to you. Pray. [music] Let [singing] everything I pursue be pleasing, [music] [singing] oh Lord, I to you. The altar is open. You could pray right at your seat. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let us sing that song. Brother Trevor, if you'll sing a few songs before we go, Brother Chuck. Sure. Come forward. So [clears throat] all you most of you know that u we were gone up to Minnesota for Barb's brother's he passed away and so we know that you're praying for us and as we got to be blessed tonight and here uh power of prayer is is is very important. And so before we travel, we always ask the Lord for traveling mercies. And when I left here by myself with the dog, uh 1650 miles, asked for the Lord to be with us and and we made it up there taking the car without any problems. Um and we just genuinely appreciate that. uh because it wasn't an easy trip. And on the way back, we end up leaving on Saturday morning to come home. Didn't get too early of a start, a little after 9 in the morning. And between here and there in the 1650 [clears throat] mi, there are two smaller cities. Um one in Nebraska and one in Iowa. And so a lot of little speed bump type towns that all is in there is a little gas station convenience store but nothing else. No services of any kind really. So we were heading back um had been pretty tiring trip and Barb was very tired. She was little sleeping and we come into this uh Sous City, Iowa and as you come into the town getting [clears throat] through it's a little tricky to hit the right road and so we usually set the GPS and then we'll just follow it to get out of out of town and then we're good. And um but she was sleeping and I didn't want to wake her up and I thought, "Oh, I can make it through." And I missed the turn. So I missed uh the turn that I was supposed to take to to head south on this Highway 77. So, we realized it and turned on another highway that kind of went that direction and figured I'd take a side road, cut back to get to that road and it was a gravel road and I'm going along and and it the car is starting to kind of feel like this real weird. I thought, "Oh, it's just the gravel, you know, and all of a sudden on comes the warning lights and I had a tire issue." uh was flat and just as I approached the highway that we're trying to connect to uh I got out and looked at it had a flat tire like oh my goodness this is not a good spot. I pulled out on the highway and I thought this is dangerous. So, I pulled in a little siding, backed into a little siding area there, and tried to get the the wheel off, and it was another tricky story. But anyhow, finally got the wheel off, and this guy came along and asked if we needed any help. Um, I already had the tire off, but he was the local guy. So, we said, "Well, you know, we don't know whether to go down the road and try to get to a tire place or back to Sous City, Iowa." And he said, "No, you want to go back to Sous City." He says, "There's nothing but just little tiny towns between, you know, as you go south." And he says, "There's several tire spots." And I said, "Is there a discount tire there?" He said, "Yeah, there's a discount tire there." So, we called them up. They had the tire that we needed and we end up putting, you know, had the donut on. So, we're traveling back at like 40 m an hour for like 10 miles and we got back to Sous City, Iowa. It was lunchtime. There's a Culver's right next door. She walked over and got lunch. They changed our tires and about two and a half to three hours delayed along the way, but we're right where we needed to be. It could have been the middle of the night in middle of Kansas. I mean there a dozen hundred different scenarios probably that made it bad and then after we left we got about an hour down the road and it started raining and then it rained for like 10 hours and it was some of the road was real slick but we had brand new tires under us you know it felt so good and it was just the Lord &gt;&gt; absolutely absolutely know it was just the Lord and we appreciate your prayers and God bless &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Chuck. Let's stand and sing that song. He's fairer than the lily of the valley. He is everything. The lily. Is that too high? [music] He is fairer than lily of the valley. He is brighter than all [music] [singing] star. He is sweeter than the snow. Fresher [singing] than the Greece, [music] lovelier [singing] by far than all of these. [music] He [singing] is fairer than the lily of the valley. [music] He is brighter [singing] than the morning star. [singing] He is purer than [music] the snow, fresher than the [singing] breeze, lovelier [music] by far than all of [singing] these. [music] May God bless you. Are we in seat? Sweet hour of prayer. [singing] Sweet hour of prayer that calls [music and singing] me from a world of care [singing and music] and bids me at my father's throne.

I'll cast on [singing and music] him my care and weight. for [singing] the sweet hour of [music] prayer. Brother R, could you close the service out with a word of prayer for us? Let's bow our heads. Lord God, Father, just want to [music] say thank you Lord once again for allowing us to be in this place of worship. Father, I appreciate Brother Chuck's testimony for taking care of them, Lord.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the key of G. The trials of this world were growing closer. The pole I felt was more than I could bear. And I was on the verge [music] of living [singing] over. The strength within myself [singing] just wasn't [music] there. But something keeps holding me. [singing] Every day I see he's helping [singing and music] me faithfully to overcome my trials. [singing] He's guiding me constantly, giving [singing and music] me victory. He's a reality. [music and singing] Something keeps holding me. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Satan laid before me his [singing and music] temptation of his desire [singing and music] to steal away my faith.
