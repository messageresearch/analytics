pray that each heart would be blessed those that have gathered here in your name may you grant this blessing to them is our prayer in Jesus name we pray amen so God bless each of you we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight and God bless you richly let's stand to our feet and we'll go right into the word have a few notes that I'll read and then um uh finish up a portion of the tape the queen of the south in Matthew chapter 12 um brother bam takes this scripture as he deals with this queen of the South referred to as the Queen of Sheba Matthew chapter 12 12 verse number 38-42 when you have that you can say Amen then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them a evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the Well's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and that the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here the queen of the South shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here amen one more scripture in Matthew chapter 6 of course I just was meditating on the scripture and then Levi uh plac this last song that brought me out seek ye first the kingdom of God Matthew chapter 6 verse 33 says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof God bless you may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated just thinking on some of the thoughts from this past week and as we were um thinking how you know the the the Lord would always puts us in a position where he would make us motivated he won't Force us to do things but he'll sure make us willing we have to make the decision ourself but there are times that we put too much pressure on ourself that maybe the Lord didn't put on us and sometimes we we feel so inadequate or in effective am I a true witness I haven't LED anyone to the Lord and we think these thoughts and I think those thoughts come from hearts that really want to do something that's right and so if you didn't care you wouldn't think those thoughts I guess and so we all want to be greater witness we all want to see the Lord manifested in our lives and this scripture here in Matthew chapter six kind of deals with take no thought if you take that just that phrase there he says it is several times our lord Jesus does and he says take no thought for the for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink nor for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than rment verse 26 he says behold the fouls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father Feth them are you not much better than they of course the little birds in my neighborhood they don't have to worry about eating because we feed them and many of you you feed the little animals and the birds and those little birds they're not stressing about the things that maybe we would stress about where is their food coming from and Jesus is putting us in that time that that mindset he says the little birds of the air the fowls they're not worried about these things for the father takes care of them he covers them he's got them covered and he's telling and our lord Jesus has said don't take no thought on on those things that how are you going to eat what we're going to do you know sometimes we cross the bridge before we get there we're so stressed out about next week and we might not even be in next week the Lord may call us home and we fail to enjoy the moment of his blessing us today you know the things for tomorrow are going to take care of themselves it's going to happen either you're going to get it done or you're not and sometimes we have our list and our of accomplishments and goals and I like something that brother uh Trevor said at the Bible study there at the youth Bible study he was bringing in how the Lord delivered him and dealt with him on a social media and how he got rid of that and and he was bringing up some of the examples and statistics was very very good and informative and how sometimes we compare ourselves to one another and so we look on there and we say well he's 40 or he's 30 or he's 25 and look at all that he has at the age of 25 he retired at 30 and here you are and you're in your 50s still going to work and are you a bum or what you know but that's not none of your business that's not none of your business who retired or who has what you shouldn't put that pressure on yourself because the father called you for a purpose sometimes we want to preach like this or sing like that want to have what this one has but we're not we shouldn't do that that's not wise to compare ourselves that way and it's just undo pressure it's pressure that God didn't design for us to have and I think that um Jesus just brings that out very very nicely in the scripture I hope you have your Bible there just for a moment in Matthew chapter 6 let's just walk through the scripture just for a moment and then we'll go to this last part of the tap verse 27 says 26 behold the fowls of the air they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father Feth them are you not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature and why take ye thought for rment consider the lies of the field first he tells us the birds and now he's telling us the plant life how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all of his glory was not AR raay like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith you know let's stop right there in verse number 30 as we as we look at the the vegetation and the plant life how the Lord will do the Landscaping on on Mount Lemon there and even on all of our hillsides and how beautiful it is and the rain just sets it off and you'll see the flowers blooming and you wonder well who's taking care of all of those plants who's watering them who's making sure they have enough water but God does he takes care of that and it's without stress I mean the ones that are going to die are going to die and the ones that are going to survive are going to survive and that's just the way it is we went up to Mount Lemon here the other day and just looking at the beautiful landscape how it's put together you know we have some of those same plants maybe in our own yards and we want to care for them and stress and worry about them but the Lord has that all under his control and that's not really our burden I mean I think that um I think in this hour in this age if the enemy can throw you you know he can't get you on this side he'll get you on this other side and so we know we love the Lord we know we want to be true believers and true Christians and then now the enemy wants to get into that and start making this about some kind of a performance like he's grading you or judging you based on your performance but really it's a relationship between our heavenly father he knows what we have need of before we even ask him let me ask you who wants your family saved more than God himself the God put the desire he gave you your family and then like and then now that they're their Wayward or they go the way that they go and then we want to see them saved right how many want to see your loved one saved and then we want to see them saved so bad that we'll get involved and we'll start arguing and stressing the matter and start trying to judge them and send them this quote and make sure they're in church or condemn them when they doing the reason why you want to see them Sav is because God did something for you and if he if he saved you you don't you think he knew who your family would be and don't you think he would know that you would want your family saved too so the stress is on who's creating all of this stress for your family to be saved God got it all under control amen and he works in ways that maybe we don't see he works secretly he works on a man's heart works on a woman's heart and we're looking at the outward we don't see any physical signs and our work is that we're not a good witness nobody's looking at us oh stop God knows exactly what he's doing he puts you in your neighborhood he puts you on the job he even put you in your family and your entire family they're watching you the job is watching you the neighborhood is watching you and that's the best witness that we can be be exactly where God called us to be let off the pressure relax stop trying to figure it all out and just serve the Lord with all your heart paragraph verse 31 says therefore take no thought saying what you shall eat or what you shall Drink wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knowe it that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you let's read that verse together verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take no thought take therefore no thought for tomorrow for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof so that's what we want to do we want to put the things that God has given us put it in his hands trust him believe him and be happy have a smile on your face take off the pressure you're a Christian you're on your way to heaven when you die thank the Lord I I can't think of a better deal than that when it's all over we get to go to heaven anyways so if your candidate do didn't do too well in the presidential thing stop stressing don't worry about it if your crew with your job whatever they didn't promote you they didn't recognize you nobody respects you Let It Go just Let It Go we get to go to heaven when we die anyways and the heavenly father knows what we have need of before we even ask take no thought so brother random takes this message the queen of the South and we listen to paragraph up to paragraph I think 31 or 32 and I want to finish up that message he um pretty much got through the preaching part of it and and now he's going into the prayer line and so I wanted to finish that up and I know if there's an anointing there and I believe it'll be a blessing to all of you and another thing I'd like to say I don't want you to because we play part of a tape or we'll might play half of the tape or we'll break it up like on the seals will start it right at a certain part that's not taken away from uh we certainly don't want you to think that we're taking away from listening to the entire message it is important I another thing also the other Bible translations I read from them for commentary for my own personal study brother random used the King James version that's what I like to use that's where we stand and um as you study that a little bit more you'll see there's some some newer translations that they're they're changing with the times and so you just you know you don't have to deal with that when you just stick with the King James version read what read whatever version you want to read but when you just bring it back to what the prophet left for us and that that settles all of that amen the Christian world are trying to find out the ESV or the NIV or the nsav or the living Bible um New King James all of those versions versions of the Bible great correct it's a language it's good for study it's good for looking what did God use what stood the test of time what is um has been Vindicated and uh that's his King James version so I certainly hopefully trust that that will we we uh establish that here all right all right so God bless you let us go to the tape you can remain seated and brother randam paragraph 31 God bless you got two little girls sitting back there Rebecca and Sarah they're both D's little girls when I go out they're always waiting for me to come back they love Daddy you know how Daddy loves them there's a little Parable one morning I'd come in early and the kitties had waited long and I was late so they had to go to bed their mother put them to bed and I couldn't rest that morning so so I got up early sitting out in the living room in a chair I had meetings and I was so worn out I just couldn't sleep and I got up early sitting in the chair after a while I heard a scramble in the children's bedroom Becky had woke up and she Wonder her daddy if he' got in here she come through the house just as hard as she can behind her come her little sister about so tall now Becky was big she's about 13 long legged and skinny Sarah's a little chumpy fell her pajama feet about twice the size they ought to be she was falling over most everything in the house and Becky come and jumped out a straddle on my leg and her big long legs hung down to the floor she could balance herself pretty well I think about like like the churches sometime they're older than this move of God the Pentecostal and they may have both feet on the ground that's all right we appreciate that and she put her arms around me and hugged me real tight she said my daddy and when she heard Sarah her little sister coming she turned to looked at Sarah she said Sarah Sarah remind me of this little church that just started you know it isn't very old sometimes it gets up in the air and down on the ground and flopping around in and out she said Sarah I want you to know one thing I was here first and I've got all of Daddy and there's nothing left for you little Sarah dropped her little lips down her little brown eyes kind of watered she turned to go away I winked at her and motioned my finger stop my other leg out here she come all smiles and jumped up on that leg she couldn't hold herself she couldn't touch the ground you know they get little upside Topsy Turvy sometime when they get drunk on the spirits you know but as long as are there so I just tuck both arms I had to to hold her on my leg she was too sharp she hadn't grow enough I hugged her up close to me and she roll that little head around them little black eyes stuck out and looked at Becky she said Rebecca my sister I want to tell you something too you said it may be true that you got your first and it may be true that you've got all a daddy but I want you to know one thing Daddy's got all of me so that's the way I feel about this religion I don't know all the ins and outs maybe the Bible I know the the author of The Bible real well and just as long as he's got all of me that's all I care for if I'm so completely surrendered to him and to his will that he can work his works let the world say what they want to and she'll rise in the day of the judgment and condemn this generation for she came from the utmost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon a gift and yet I say Toto you that are greater than Solomon is here let us pray precious Lord we are now standing at a Crossroads we've been brought to a place to whether it is we must accept it are discarded we can not go out this doors of this place tonight as we were when we come in we either go out better or worse Lord grant that every man and woman in here will go out filled with the Holy Spirit go back to their home church and be a real Christian in it granted Lord and now as brother dupes has been speaking and we have told of the great Messiah gift the last sign to the church that was to appear just before for the Judgment I pray God that you'll make yourself known to this church tonight that you are not dead but you are alive and the god that they worship the Jesus that they love is walking side by side with them and those the very thoughts of their heart and when we shall close the service tonight may all unbelievers are so forth come forward and give their hearts to thee and as we go on our roads home may we say like those who came from Aus on that first resurrection morning after Jesus had gotten them together and closed the door he did something just the way he did it before his crucifixion they knew that no man did it that way but him and they understood and their eyes opened and he vanished out of their sight and they said as they hurried back to tell the others did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way once more Lord and this great church of angelist Temple I pray God that you will once more tonight come into our midst so real and so tangible that every person in here may see you do the works that you did before your crucifixion they might know that their God Lives heal the sick save the lost and may we all commit ourselves to thy spirit that we might be instruments that he might work through us we ask it in Jesus name amen hallu Jesus said in one case if I not the works of my father who sent me don't believe me now I want you to know clearly that I am not a Divine healer and I don't believe there's one in the world I believe that Divine Healing is on the same basis of Salvation Jesus Christ paid the price of sin at Calvary and you cannot touch sin unless you touch sickness because sickness is an attribute of sin maybe not what you done but what somebody done before you because we never had no sickness until we had sin When sin came sickness followed it that's true how can you preach the gospel of Salvation and then deny Divine Healing has been more than I ever could understand Jesus died at Calvary every sin was settled the only thing you do now is look and live believe it he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes you were healed if I had power to heal anybody I certainly would do it I sure would I know what it means to be sick I have no power to heal no other man does if he does then what happened to Calvary God cannot do anything twice by his stripes you were healed only if he stood here tonight with this suit that he gave me he could do not one thing towards your healing unless you believed it he proved in the scripture many mighty Works he could not do because of their unbelief it's the same tonight he's same yesterday today and forever but those who believe could now the main thing is this if we can he will come in our midst and prove that he's in our midst then that gives every person an opportunity to look and live I believe I heard brother SAR in a few moment ago as I come up speaking about the Caribbean islands where we just left that judge that morning was standing there talking and Sally Olson was interpreting giving me the message so astonished said it was when this brother brandom leaves God don't leave the island said he put all the emphasis on God and when the meeting was over they took carloads of little old carts and wheels that they drove together to bring their loved ones on crutches and clubs laying covered all over the fields where they just got up and left them and here we set here tonight in America we ought to be ashamed of ourselves if we have the trouble I I feel more sorry for America than anywhere else because they don't know which way to turn this one's saying this and this one's saying that Jesus said let every man's word be lie and mine be the truth he is living he died he rose again he's alive forever more he's the same yesterday today and forever now we're late tomorrow night but this time we expect to be gone Sunday night I'm kind of ashamed I've got a the Lord has given me rather a way that I can operate my Ministry a little different than what I used to that is that the Visions just come and then I let it go till I strike another that really needs it and then let it go to that one then go on to see someone really in need or some sin hanging on the person then I stop that one but I don't believe my Ministry of the first type to take the line and search it by the Holy Spirit has ever been done here so B it won't won't take very long for that let's have it that way tonight and then tomorrow night I'll start my new ministry that the Lord Give Me Now last evening before we had had anybody here so anyone would see that the prayer card GNA have nothing to do with the healing of the person the great Holy Spirit come down and went over this building telling talking to the people tell them just what it was and healing the people how many was sure to witness it raise your hands as before anything ever happened how many is here that's never been in one of my meetings before raise your hands or half the congregation now I claim that Jesus that the coming of the Lord is near the last sign that's ever showed to any generation before the chaos as before the destructions happen the Messiah sign is given to that people it was given to AB Abraham before the destruction of Sodom it was given to the Jews before God turned from them it was given to the Samaritans before God turned from them and now there's one generation one people left from Ham sham and japas people that's the Gentiles we've had 2,000 years of theology we've had healings we've had Miracles all down through there but now we're at the end time the Messiah is drawing closer the hour is at hand I know that you've had so many Sensations and things so it seems like they don't catch it like the baby open up your understandings tonight before God let him move upon you if God can proved to be here the resurrection of Jesus Christ that he is in this building and he is with his people how much more would you want it ought to make you to throw your crutches down jump from your wheelchairs get out of here go on the street tomorrow saying did not our hearts burn within us as the Holy Spirit spoke to us tonight don't wait you keep Satan can make you put it off till tomorrow night that's just one night longer and that much harder to get to it believe it right now if you believe you shall receive and if the Lord Jesus will appear in our midst of these hundreds and hundreds of people sitting here tonight and will perform and do just like he did before he was crucified how many will say it'll settle it with me forever that Jesus Christ is alive and I I'll take him as my savior raise your hands will you thank you and radio audience I wish you could be here to see that this great massive of people sitting here with their hands up witnessing that they would accept the Lord Jesus maybe some of them are sinners some of them what is sin why a person can be just as loyal to church as they can be a member of the finest Church in Los Angeles and still be a sinner a preacher can stand behind the pull pit and preach a gospel message that would shake the whole audience and still be a sinner sin is unbelief you believe him not you're condemned already now I believe the boys told me there that they gave out a one bunch of prayer cards this afternoon we want to stay them up so it'll be Reverend everybody has a chance to get the prayer card get into the line now brother Duffield or any of the pastors here didn't give out those prayer cards it's these boys give them out they stand up here and mix them up before you and then come out give anybody a card that wants one therefore if you're from the temple or your pastor had nothing to do with or neither Brother Duffield or anyone here at the this church or any other Church you just give it out and you come as you're called it's not a push and a shove fuss and so forth this is a house of God it's not an arena I've seen him when you try to take six head Rose of man in India or nearly 500,000 together and they'd break through those lines and jump over one another run through the legs of the officers trying to get through well you couldn't you couldn't preach or pray for the sick like that there's too much confusion the holy spirit is timid everything must be decently and in order for the Holy Spirit I'm was that L prayer cards L was give out and we're going to start at number one and line up as many as we can let's see I believe it'd be just as easy for them to come this way who has prayer card number one raise up your hand a lady come right here number two raise up your hand all right sir number three come right down here lady if you will let that right along front the number three raise up your hand way back in the back uh just wait till your number is called number four raise up your hand back over here 15 minutes now do you realize that this now what I have preached about what you have heard about what the Bible has told it's either got to be proven now to be the truth or it's wrong now Comes The Showdown is Christ alive if he is he'll make himself no to you Pentecostal people did not Jesus say or Paul I beg your pardon Paul said to the Corinthian Church if all speak with tongues and one come in unlearn you'll say you're you're mad but if one prophesies and reveals the secret of the heart then they'll fall down and say God is with you how many knows the Bible says that raise your hands sure see how could you say it with something else when when Paul and Jesus and the Holy Spirit just keeps going on with it now to you that's in the prayer line how many of you know that I do not know you or know nothing about you your calls raise your hands will you all right every one of them I don't see a person there that I've ever seen in my life now again so the audience visible audience can see it every one of you in the prayer line that knows that I do not know you or know what's wrong with you or know your desires or what you're here far raise up your hands again you see it all right now neither do you out there I the only person I thought I seen brother Julius stats Cliff here somewhere I guess it was this afternoon he sitting along here somewhere now here is The Showdown now for the next few minutes now remember it's not me now just be seated keep your seats and be real quiet just for a moment now it's not me I don't know these people those people don't know me my hand is before God I I don't know one of them and they raised their hands that the same they don't know me I don't know them so something's got to take place if these scriptures are made true all right now this there's a woman coming here now I suppose that mic is alive there too is it you can stand right there Then lady now here we are meeting a man and a woman the first time in life to meet I do not know her never seen her I suppose this may be the first time we've ever come this close together let's annoing in her life if that's right raise up your hand that's right the first time was ever met all right but she's here for some cause now what can happen what can Jesus do with this when I've already said by if she's sick by his stripes she was healed but he's still the same Jesus yesterday today and forever one time in St John 4 this come together again a man and a woman Jesus met the woman at the of Samaria and she he asked her for a drink you know the story and Jesus kept talking to her till he found out what her trouble was how many knows what her trouble was she had five husbands living with the sixth one and when he told her that she said uh I perceive that you are a prophet we know when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things that was a sign of the Messiah if he's the same Messiah today he's gone away and the body of Flesh Jesus was crucified God raised it up and set it on his throne but the spirit that was in him has come back upon his church and it's a yielding to the Holy Spirit I don't know her she don't know me now if she believes all right she might be a Critic she might be a hypocrite she might be a Christian she might be sick she might need finances spiritual a I don't know nothing about her if she's a Critic watch what happened to her in the next few minutes you've been in meetings before you and seen what happened then now here's where the that's another anonas and Safa case but now I'll speak to her just like our L spoke to that woman till he found her trouble then if let her be the judge now if I walked up and said sister you're sick that might be right might be wrong and she said yes of course he know I was sick I'm in the prayer line well it could be she wasn't sick and laid my hands on her and said praise the Lord you're going to get well well she should believe that but what if the Holy Spirit comes here and goes back down her life and tell her what she has been now she knows whether that's the truth or not and if he knows what has been surely he'll know what will be you believe that I just want to talk to the woman just a moment being that this is our first time meeting and you're quite sure that there's something taking place because standing before a man wouldn't make you feel as you're feeling now did you ever see that picture of the Angel of the Lord that light over where I was standing is he taken pH in Phoenix Arizona you saw it all right that same light is between you and I now now if that is the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel he come and was made flesh he said I came from God and I go back to God after his death bar and resurrection and Ascension he met Paul on the road to Damascus and what was he back again that Pillar of Fire put Paul's eyes out made him blind for a season and he said Saul Saul why persecuted s me he said who are you Lord he Saidi Jesus Pillar of Fire now if the life of the vine produces something here it's got to produce the same fruit here then if the holy spirit is in here it'll that same Pillar of Fire that's standing between you and I now you being a woman me a man and if it can reveal to me what you're here for then God's interested in taking care of your needs is that right and you be the judge if the audience still hears my voice a woman seems to be going from me and she's She's suffering with a nervous condition that's what she wants me to pray for
