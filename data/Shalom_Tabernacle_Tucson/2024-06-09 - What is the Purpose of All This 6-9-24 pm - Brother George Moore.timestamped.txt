[37:39] while we're all standing let's turn our

[37:47] scripture for this
[37:51] evening so good to be here with you
[37:53] tonight
[38:02] Ephesians the thir chapter we'll start
[38:04] reading at the seventh verse and this is
[38:07] of course Paul speaking and he says
[38:10] whereof I was made a minister he's
[38:12] talking about to the Gentile church or
[38:14] to the Gentiles whereof I was made a
[38:17] minister according to the gift of the
[38:19] grace of God given unto me by the
[38:22] effectual working of his power unto me
[38:26] who am less than the least of All Saints
[38:30] is this Grace given that I should preach
[38:32] among the Gentiles The unsearchable
[38:35] Riches of Christ I'm so glad he preached
[38:38] to the Gentiles aren't
[38:39] you and to make all men see what is the
[38:43] Fellowship of the mystery which from
[38:46] before the beginning of the world hath
[38:49] been hid in God who created All Things
[38:53] by Christ by Jesus Christ now that's
[38:56] maybe sounds a little tricky let me read
[38:58] the uh the English Standard Version it
[39:01] says and to bring to light for everyone
[39:04] which is the plan of the mystery hidden
[39:08] for ages in God who created all
[39:12] things 10th verse to the intent that now
[39:15] unto the principalities and powers in
[39:18] Heavenly places might be known by the
[39:20] church the manifold wisdom of God let me
[39:24] read English Standard on that also it
[39:26] says so that through the church the
[39:29] manifold wisdom of God might now be made
[39:33] known to the rulers and authorities in
[39:36] Heavenly places 11th verse according to
[39:39] the Eternal purpose God has an eternal
[39:43] purpose tonight Saints which he purposed
[39:46] in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have
[39:51] boldness and access with confidence by
[39:55] faith in him can you say Amen to the
[39:58] word tonight let's just bow our heads
[40:00] Heavenly Father we're so grateful
[40:02] tonight to be assembled together with

[40:54] Lord that you'd watch over me and bind
[40:56] my lips before I'd say anything
[40:58] unpleasing to you and will commit it
[41:00] into your hands in the name of the Lord
[41:03] Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you
[41:06] you may be
[41:07] seated and uh uh the title of the
[41:09] message tonight is what's the purpose in
[41:12] all of
[41:13] this now can we get a little bit more
[41:16] monder up here now Paul tells us in the
[41:20] scripture here that it was in the plan
[41:24] of God to bring light by Jesus Christ
[41:30] unto the
[41:31] Gentiles so that the Gentiles might
[41:35] understand the mystery plan of God that
[41:39] had been hidden for ages by God himself
[41:43] so these Mysteries that we uh are
[41:46] looking at or looking for were hidden by
[41:49] God himself and can only be revealed to
[41:52] us by God
[41:55] himself and he said that the Church
[41:57] might know the multifaceted the manifold
[42:01] the multiple wisdom of our Lord Jesus
[42:05] Christ by Revelation so that we might
[42:08] know the Eternal purpose of God by our
[42:12] Lord Jesus Christ so God has an eternal
[42:16] purpose and it was and Paul was saying
[42:19] here that God wants to reveal to his
[42:22] church that Eternal purpose that they
[42:25] might know so God is looking for a
[42:28] people today that understand where
[42:32] they're standing at saints that
[42:35] understand what we're here for why we're
[42:38] here what the purpose in all of this is
[42:41] he wants a people that understand his
[42:45] purpose tonight amen and so if it's
[42:47] something that God wants us to have then
[42:50] it's our right to attain that sort of
[42:52] thing so we each should have a purpose
[42:56] in our life now the word purpose means
[42:59] the reason for which something is done
[43:01] or created or which something exists it
[43:05] means the motive the motivation the
[43:07] cause uh to describe or intend for
[43:11] something of a particular use to have
[43:13] something as one's intention or
[43:16] objective so so our our purpose Should
[43:19] Be Our intention our objective our
[43:23] prescribed use what we're here to do
[43:25] Saints amen so we all should have a
[43:28] purpose we all do have a purpose that
[43:31] God put us here not to just do what we
[43:33] want to do but he put us here to
[43:35] accomplish an intended purpose there's a
[43:38] goal in us being here there's a reason
[43:41] in us being here do y'all believe that
[43:42] tonight God don't do anything just by
[43:45] because but he put you here for a reason
[43:47] and he called you here for a reason and
[43:49] you're in the message today for a reason
[43:51] and there's a reason we're all here
[43:53] tonight and there's a reason we heard
[43:54] the message we heard tonight and
[43:56] whatever take you here tomorrow there's
[43:58] a reason for
[44:00] it because all things work together for
[44:04] good of those that love the Lord and are
[44:06] called according to his purpose so it
[44:09] gives this purpose is what gives our
[44:11] life meaning Saints the purpose is what
[44:14] makes everything worthwhile the purpose
[44:17] is is is why we're here it's what we
[44:19] were put here for and if you want to see
[44:21] somebody that's miserable you can look
[44:24] for somebody that has no purpose in
[44:26] their life and it's a miserable
[44:29] existence it's a miserable way of living
[44:32] brother Ezekiel not to have a purpose
[44:35] and there's no fulfillment in it if you
[44:37] don't have any purpose because there's
[44:39] no meaning to it if there's no
[44:42] purpose see when I was a sinner I had no
[44:45] kind of a purpose outside of my own
[44:48] desires amen and if you're chasing after
[44:51] your own desires you know that there's
[44:53] no real meaning to
[44:56] that so it leads to
[44:59] misery when you're living for yourself
[45:02] it's a miserable
[45:04] life if you turn to many times people
[45:07] turn to alcohol and drugs and things
[45:10] because they're never satisfied if you
[45:13] don't have a purpose and you don't have
[45:15] a goal there's no satisfaction in your
[45:17] life so they try to they try to hush
[45:20] that calling in their life with alcohol
[45:22] or drugs or or any kind of evil or some
[45:25] kind of uh uh whatever kind of sin it is
[45:27] and I'll tell you when I was young that
[45:29] party scene it might look good to me but
[45:31] but I I'd wake up the next day and I
[45:34] realized that there was no value in my
[45:39] life but when God brought me into this
[45:43] message say hallelujah for the first
[45:45] time my life had meaning and my life had
[45:49] value and I was standing for
[45:53] something there was a purpose in me
[45:56] being here
[45:57] is that your is that your testimony
[45:59] tonight Saints and each of Our Lives
[46:02] should have a purpose and this Li this
[46:04] purpose that we're talking about it
[46:06] comes from what what brother Brandon
[46:09] referred to as
[46:12] attributes now attribute that word means
[46:16] a quality or feature regarded as a
[46:19] characteristic or intent part of someone
[46:22] or something it's it's a part of you
[46:25] that's there for a reason
[46:27] for example if if you had the attributes
[46:31] of say an athlete let's say you let's
[46:34] say you got some wheels on you brother
[46:36] Israel and you can run fast and you had
[46:38] that attribute about you then you might
[46:41] purpose to be some kind of a a football
[46:45] player or a basketball player or a
[46:47] baseball player if you got a rocket for
[46:48] an arm maybe a purpose to be a
[46:51] quarterback or a pitcher or something or
[46:54] or or if you got the attributes of a
[46:56] race card driver and you got good
[46:57] reflexes and and and you can drive
[46:59] around Tucson traffic at 8:00 in the
[47:02] morning you might purpose in your life
[47:04] that you want to be a race car driver
[47:07] and and so that that that would you know
[47:08] maybe you start try to get in NASCAR or
[47:11] something like that but but that's the
[47:13] attributes that are inside us and it
[47:16] leads us to our
[47:18] purpose if you had attributes as a
[47:20] musician you might you might purpose to
[47:23] play in the orchestra or something or or
[47:26] maybe you want to play in church
[47:28] whatever those attributes are if you got
[47:30] attributes of liking to eat everything
[47:32] you might purpose to be brother George
[47:40] tonight
[47:42] huh and when you have a purpose
[47:46] Saints the desire is already
[47:50] there when you have a purpose the desire
[47:54] is already there so your attri rutes
[47:57] lead to your purpose and your purpose
[47:59] gives you a
[48:01] desire see if you got a purpose you
[48:04] don't you don't have to be concerned
[48:06] about motivation see motivation goes
[48:08] like this all right motivation goes up
[48:11] and down but when you got a purpose it
[48:13] goes past motivation into
[48:17] conviction and then you don't have to be
[48:19] talked into it you don't have to talk
[48:21] yourself into it you got a desire to do
[48:25] it oh come on somebody tonight amen if
[48:28] you got a purpose of being a
[48:30] professional athlete you don't have to
[48:32] be talked into training you're going to
[48:34] train whether anybody's looking or not
[48:36] you're going to train whether anybody's
[48:38] watching you or not if you got a purpose
[48:40] to be a millionaire ain't nobody gonna
[48:42] have to make you get up in the morning
[48:43] and go to work each day because you got
[48:45] a purpose of being a
[48:47] millionaire you got a desire in you to
[48:51] do the things that you got to do to
[48:53] accomplish your purpose
[48:56] and and if you're a purposed to be a
[48:58] great musician or a great singer Ain't
[49:00] nobody got to talk you in to practicing
[49:03] you desire to practice because you want
[49:06] to be
[49:09] great see purpose gives us an inward
[49:13] Compass an inward compass that get
[49:16] guides us and leads us and pushes us
[49:18] where we should go and and we find so
[49:21] many times that people are going through
[49:23] life without that internal Compass
[49:26] there's nothing guiding them they're
[49:27] just floating about God don't want you
[49:29] just to float
[49:31] about amen God don't want you to float
[49:34] around from Pillar To Post he wants you
[49:36] to settle in and dig your feet in and go
[49:40] forward amen now sometimes we got to
[49:44] seek a while to find our purpose
[49:47] sometimes we got to push hard to to
[49:49] understand what our purpose is it don't
[49:51] always appear to us and you might be
[49:53] sitting here today and say brother
[49:55] George I'm not sure what my purpose is
[49:57] but if you're looking for it God will
[49:59] lead you towards your purpose if you're
[50:02] seeking your purpose God will show you
[50:04] that
[50:05] way so I ain't got it all figured out
[50:08] nobody does Amen but we know there is a
[50:11] purpose in us being here and we got to
[50:13] trust that God's leading us to identify
[50:16] to us the purpose that he has for
[50:18] us all
[50:21] right so if you have tonight the
[50:25] attributes of a
[50:28] believer then you're going to purpose to
[50:31] be a real
[50:34] Christian and if you got the attributes
[50:37] of a Believer and your purpose is to be
[50:39] a real Christian the desire to be a
[50:41] Christian will automatically be there
[50:45] amen and and you won't have to be talked
[50:47] into coming to church you'll come to
[50:50] church because it's Church time amen you
[50:53] might be tired and you might feel like
[50:55] staying at home but you're desire is to
[50:57] be in the house of the Lord your desire
[50:59] is to serve the Lord your desire is to
[51:02] Worship the Lord and ain't nobody to
[51:03] talk you into praising God your desire
[51:06] is to praise God and everybody got to
[51:08] talk you into worshiping God because
[51:10] your desire is to worship God and
[51:13] everybody got to talk you into hearing
[51:15] the message because your desire is to
[51:17] hear the message and nobody got to talk
[51:19] you into reading your Bible because your
[51:21] desire is to read your
[51:23] Bible because your purpose is to be a
[51:26] real Christian and you got the
[51:28] attributes of a
[51:35] Believer
[51:38] yes ain't nobody got to talk into
[51:40] worshiping nobody got to talk you to
[51:43] praise amen Ain't nobody got to beg you
[51:45] to come to church amen if church was
[51:48] closed you'd find another church to go
[51:51] too because you got a desire to be a
[51:54] believer you got a desire to be a
[51:56] Christian right tonight Saints amen and
[51:59] your desire will be there because of
[52:01] your purpose and it won't matter how
[52:03] many websites the devil can come up with
[52:07] it won't matter how many believe the
[52:08] signs is out there it won't matter what
[52:11] any kind of infidel says it won't matter
[52:13] what kind of junk Satan throws out there
[52:15] you'll believe because your purpose is
[52:18] to be a
[52:22] believer and you'll have an
[52:24] anchor that'll hold told you no matter
[52:28] what the internet says no matter what
[52:31] the unbeliever or the make believer says
[52:34] no matter what the nominal says you'll
[52:37] have an anchor and you know I tell you
[52:39] these things that's cropping up in our
[52:41] day and all this that's coming against
[52:42] the message in our day it didn't happen
[52:45] until these old Fighters started dying
[52:47] off I'm gonna tell you right now Saints
[52:49] you you probably you w going to tell you
[52:51] wasn't going to tell brother Muse that
[52:54] sunset Mountain didn't happen
[52:58] CU he was a
[53:00] witness amen you wern't going to tell
[53:02] brother Billy Paul that them Miracles
[53:04] didn't happen because he was a
[53:10] witness and so as these old Fighters die
[53:13] off then we find that other stuff is
[53:15] raising up but Saints it's time for a
[53:18] people that have not seen yet still
[53:21] believe
[53:27] and I might not be a witness but I'm a
[53:30] witness of a
[53:34] witness
[53:36] yes y'all love the Lord
[53:39] tonight and I'll tell you what I Paul
[53:41] said I'm Marvel that you're so soon
[53:44] removed from the gospel that I preached
[53:46] to you it shocked Paul by the early
[53:50] church age that they'd already started
[53:52] to leave away from the gospel that he
[53:55] preached I Marvel that you moved away
[53:58] from it so
[54:02] soon and Saints I didn't come I wasn't
[54:06] called to preach some kind of prop
[54:08] Prosperity Gospel brother will I wasn't
[54:10] called to make everybody think they're
[54:11] saved and everything's going to be great
[54:13] and God's going to give you a million
[54:14] dollars I was called to preach the
[54:17] message and the message is rugged and
[54:20] the message is true and the message is
[54:23] right and the message is
[54:25] straight and the message
[54:28] Cuts but that's what God called us to
[54:31] Saints you don't want what the
[54:33] Prosperity Gospel makes you want what
[54:37] the word
[54:41] makes I can't get messy
[54:46] enough come on
[54:50] somebody and these attributes that are
[54:52] in you were given to you by all my
[54:56] Mighty
[54:57] God when did he give them to you it
[55:01] wasn't when you staggered in
[55:04] here it wasn't when you first gave your
[55:06] heart to the
[55:07] Lord he gave them to you before the
[55:10] foundation of the world brother Ben
[55:12] they've been in you since before the
[55:14] foundation of the world Amen because you
[55:17] were in him before the foundation of the
[55:20] world and before the foundation of the
[55:23] world God saw you and he called you and
[55:25] he said this is my son this is my
[55:28] daughter and this is how they'll be and
[55:30] they'll be sitting here in 2024 at
[55:33] Shalom Tabernacle praising me because I
[55:36] called him to
[55:39] it ohy
[55:43] God man let the devil do what he wants
[55:45] to he cannot stop that
[55:49] predestination it's already done it's
[55:52] already
[55:54] decided amen
[55:57] and they're laying inside of you they're
[56:00] laying inside of me these seed
[56:03] attributes that are laying inside of us
[56:07] and when you give your heart to the Lord
[56:09] these attributes help you identify your
[56:14] purpose when when you receive the
[56:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost it pours water
[56:21] onto those seed attributes and they
[56:24] bring forth life
[56:27] isn't that beautiful Saints but they
[56:29] were laying there all the
[56:31] time but all of a sudden the light
[56:34] brings forth
[56:36] life the water brings forth
[56:39] life
[56:40] amen and so these are things in you that
[56:43] you might not even have known about you
[56:46] didn't know about it you didn't know you
[56:49] called to preach and then all of a
[56:52] sudden God got a hold of your heart and
[56:54] then all of a sudden from the inside
[56:57] that attribute came forth you didn't
[56:59] know you had a gift to sing you didn't
[57:02] know you had a gift of wisdom you didn't
[57:04] know you had a gift of knowledge you
[57:06] didn't know that you could play an
[57:08] instrument but then God brings to light
[57:13] those attributes now sometimes you can
[57:16] have an attribute that God gave you for
[57:18] his purpose and you can use it for the
[57:20] wrong
[57:22] purpose God can give a man a gift of
[57:24] leadership to used for God's purpose and
[57:28] that man can take that gift of
[57:29] leadership and use it for his own
[57:33] kingdom God can give somebody a gift of
[57:35] music for his purpose to praise him with
[57:39] and they can and but but they can use it
[57:41] for their self and they end up some kind
[57:43] of pop star or
[57:45] something is that what happened with
[57:47] Elvis
[57:49] Presley so you find saints that God
[57:51] gives us these attributes and it's they
[57:54] G they are given to us for
[57:56] him now brother Brown says this he says
[58:00] you have to will to do God's will let me
[58:04] read it for you Revelations chapter 4 he
[58:07] says God placed the first man Adam and
[58:10] Eve right here on free moral agency and
[58:14] he places you the same place and the
[58:18] only way that you can get this fixed in
[58:20] here is your own self-will Hallelujah
[58:24] your self-will you have to will to do
[58:28] God's
[58:30] will you have to get rid of your own
[58:33] will to let God's will come in for it's
[58:37] the only channel that leads to the
[58:40] hearts your self-will is the only
[58:44] channel that leads to the hearts and you
[58:47] got to get your will out of there so
[58:50] that God's will can come in so that God
[58:52] can control your hearts
[58:56] so God places these attributes in us to
[58:58] help us find our purpose which is
[59:01] actually his
[59:03] purpose our purpose then becomes his
[59:07] purpose ain't that what you want tonight
[59:09] Saints my purpose to become his purpose
[59:12] my my want too to become his wants amen
[59:16] and he gives you a will to do God's
[59:22] Will and the only way that we can find
[59:26] real joy and fulfillment in this life is
[59:29] to live for God's
[59:32] purpose there's no other way amen you
[59:35] see people trying to keep their self
[59:38] busy with the things of the world so
[59:40] that they don't have to face that one
[59:42] simple
[59:45] fact that our will has to be his will
[59:48] that our purpose has to be his purpose
[59:52] amen now I tell you what I've tried both
[59:55] ways I was raised a sinner and I was a
[59:59] sinner and lived a sinner's
[1:00:02] life and I tried living for myself and I
[1:00:06] was miserable and I almost ruined my
[1:00:11] life I've tried doing what I wanted and
[1:00:14] it was a disaster I made a I made a huge
[1:00:17] mistake I made huge messes out of my
[1:00:19] life can you say Amen tonight Saints
[1:00:21] anybody there I when I tried to live for
[1:00:24] myself but but when I gave my heart to
[1:00:27] the Lord my self-will gave my heart to
[1:00:30] the Lord and God gave me a purpose my
[1:00:33] life is now full of meaning and love and
[1:00:36] the virtues of God and I have a reason
[1:00:39] for being here tonight Saints I'm not
[1:00:41] here for nothing I'm here for something
[1:00:43] God's got a purpose in it
[1:00:49] all so we understand that we have a
[1:00:53] purpose but what about God
[1:00:57] now what is God's purpose did not Paul
[1:01:00] tell us in our opening scripture that
[1:01:03] there would be a people that would
[1:01:06] understand God's
[1:01:08] purpose and they would be
[1:01:11] Gentiles and that they would be they
[1:01:13] would understand the manifold wisdom of
[1:01:16] God is that what Paul said amen and he
[1:01:20] said that and he says and I'll tell you
[1:01:22] Saints I'm so thankful tonight that God
[1:01:26] sent us a
[1:01:28] prophet to tell us the purpose of
[1:01:34] God see all these people trying to run
[1:01:36] around and make people disbelieve the
[1:01:37] message does not the Bible tell us that
[1:01:41] there is coming one to turn the heart of
[1:01:43] the children to the
[1:01:46] fathers does not the Bible tell us that
[1:01:49] there was one to come that would finish
[1:01:51] the mysteries of
[1:01:54] God does the Bible tell us that when we
[1:01:57] see the sodomite condition in the world
[1:02:01] that there would come upon the Earth the
[1:02:03] son of man to be
[1:02:07] revealed now how in the world and let me
[1:02:10] ask you this like what brother Israel
[1:02:12] said last week if it wasn't brother
[1:02:14] brandom who is it didn't nobody else do
[1:02:17] it nobody else knew these things nobody
[1:02:21] else is preaching this Revelation
[1:02:23] tonight nobody else is looking and
[1:02:25] reading the Bible as an open book
[1:02:28] tonight nobody else can do it because it
[1:02:32] takes a prophet to open unto us the
[1:02:35] Revelation thereof and Paul said it was
[1:02:38] coming Paul said there'd be a people
[1:02:40] that know Paul said there'd be a people
[1:02:42] that would understand the manifold
[1:02:44] wisdom of God and now you're a witness
[1:02:47] of it
[1:02:49] today
[1:02:54] Hallelujah and I'm not looking for
[1:02:56] anybody else I found what I'm looking
[1:02:59] for I know where I'm standing tonight I
[1:03:03] know on whom I have
[1:03:07] believed and God revealed through this
[1:03:10] prophet's Ministry his threefold purpose
[1:03:13] to the church just like Paul said he
[1:03:17] would yes Christ The Mystery of God
[1:03:20] revealed brother Brown says the first
[1:03:23] thing was that God wanted to Reve reveal
[1:03:26] himself to the
[1:03:30] people and he couldn't do it as the
[1:03:32] great Jehovah God who covered all space
[1:03:35] Time and Eternity he could not he's too
[1:03:37] great to ever be revealed to the people
[1:03:40] because it would be too mysterious how
[1:03:43] that that great being that never did
[1:03:45] begin and that after you went beyond the
[1:03:49] cycle of a hundreds of billions and
[1:03:51] trillions and trillions of years of
[1:03:52] light space and on into the infinite
[1:03:55] into eternity and a great creature uh
[1:03:59] that was all and still is let me stop
[1:04:01] right here and just say this I Saints
[1:04:04] you got to have a lot of
[1:04:06] faith to think that two Adams was coming
[1:04:12] together and boom made all
[1:04:18] this if that's the case why ain't they
[1:04:21] still doing it
[1:04:23] today why ain't why ain't stuff why
[1:04:25] ain't there another Universe another
[1:04:27] world why ain't it all still happening
[1:04:29] if it if it did it once why ain't it
[1:04:31] still doing it because that ain't the
[1:04:32] way it happen Saints I ain't got enough
[1:04:35] Faith to believe that something could
[1:04:37] just pop up like this right
[1:04:46] here and he said the only way he said
[1:04:50] 143 he says but what he wanted to do he
[1:04:53] loved fatherhood for he was a
[1:04:57] father and the only way that he could
[1:04:59] express it to be was was to become a son
[1:05:03] of
[1:05:04] man and that's the reason Jesus kept
[1:05:07] saying the son of man see they didn't
[1:05:10] know what he was talking about many of
[1:05:12] them but now you get
[1:05:15] it now you get it why because it was
[1:05:18] given to you to know the manifold wisdom
[1:05:21] of God
[1:05:26] just like what our opening scripture
[1:05:28] said see he wanted to express himself
[1:05:31] that was his one of his great 3old
[1:05:34] purposes was to express himself identify
[1:05:37] himself with human beings oh God to
[1:05:41] reveal himself in
[1:05:44] Christ secondly to have the preeminence
[1:05:48] in his body of Believers that his bride
[1:05:52] that he might live in his people
[1:05:57] his first purpose was to express himself
[1:06:00] to you his second purpose was to live
[1:06:03] inside of
[1:06:06] you
[1:06:07] glory amen now he could not do that in
[1:06:10] Adam and Eve now he could do that in
[1:06:12] Adam and Eve but sin separated them so
[1:06:15] now there had to be some way to get it
[1:06:18] back again oh my oh when I this is Rich
[1:06:21] to me just to even think of it see what
[1:06:25] is what God's purpose was now why didn't
[1:06:28] he just keep Adam and Eve like that so
[1:06:32] why why did the fall
[1:06:34] happen because man was placed here on
[1:06:38] free moral
[1:06:40] agency why why is he own free moral
[1:06:42] agency so that God's attributes could be
[1:06:47] expressed in his
[1:06:49] purpose all right then he says then he
[1:06:53] would never been able to express his
[1:06:56] fullness his full attribute because he
[1:06:59] could have been a father there that's
[1:07:01] true but also he's a
[1:07:05] savior you say how do you know he was he
[1:07:08] said cause I had the experience see he
[1:07:12] is a savior and he had to express that
[1:07:16] and how could he do it only through
[1:07:19] Christ and he says how could he be a son
[1:07:22] only through
[1:07:24] Christ how could could he be a Healer
[1:07:27] only through Christ see all these things
[1:07:30] are wound up in that one person Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ Oh my he said when when I when I
[1:07:38] he says oh if God can't get them get
[1:07:41] impr prisoners like that he says now
[1:07:43] that's when he can express his
[1:07:55] knows nothing but
[1:07:59] Christ and he says you get what I mean
[1:08:03] all right that's secondly first is to
[1:08:06] express himself completely God in Christ
[1:08:09] second is to have the premen is by this
[1:08:12] in his church which is his body the
[1:08:15] bride till he could have the preeminence
[1:08:18] to express himself through them all
[1:08:20] right and
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:22] thirdly to restore the kingdom to its
[1:08:27] rightly
[1:08:29] position he said that fell by sin by the
[1:08:33] first Adam back to where he walked in
[1:08:35] the cool of the evening with his people
[1:08:38] and talked with them and fellowshipped
[1:08:40] with them so there we have the threefold
[1:08:44] purpose of God we got it revealed to us
[1:08:48] in our day just like Paul said it was
[1:08:52] coming and that we can understand what
[1:08:55] what all this is about what's all this
[1:08:58] for what's any of this mean that's what
[1:09:01] it means right
[1:09:02] there so once we understand that this is
[1:09:05] God's purpose then everything starts to
[1:09:08] fall into place so why did he put us on
[1:09:11] free moral agency well because it had to
[1:09:14] be our choice to serve him it had to be
[1:09:19] man man it's like in your home if you
[1:09:21] try to rule your home by do it because I
[1:09:24] said
[1:09:27] that's not going to be a very happy home
[1:09:30] but if you try to lead your home by
[1:09:33] example and have and your people and
[1:09:35] your children and and your family they
[1:09:37] do what you what you request of them to
[1:09:40] do because of love and and respect then
[1:09:43] that's the way to do it and God couldn't
[1:09:45] Force us to serve him he's a just God we
[1:09:51] had to do it because of our love for him
[1:09:59] so why did he come in the form of his
[1:10:01] son Jesus to redeem us well because he
[1:10:04] wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:10:08] people he had to be a kinsman
[1:10:12] redeemer he had to go through what you
[1:10:14] and I go through that's the god that we
[1:10:17] serve tonight a God that's been tempted
[1:10:21] in every manner that you and I have been
[1:10:23] tempted he knows what it's like to to be
[1:10:25] you he knows what it's like to feel pain
[1:10:29] he knows what it's like to be lonely he
[1:10:32] knows what fear feels like he knows what
[1:10:34] depression feels like he knows what
[1:10:36] anxiety feels like he knows what he
[1:10:38] knows what sickness feels like because
[1:10:40] he became a
[1:10:45] man and he can be
[1:10:48] touched by the feeling of our
[1:10:51] infirmities why did he send us the Holy
[1:10:53] Ghost because he wanted pre preeminence
[1:10:55] in the
[1:10:56] body he wanted preeminence in the body
[1:10:59] he wanted control of the body and he had
[1:11:02] to put something in you that he could
[1:11:05] control your heart
[1:11:09] with it's all according to God's
[1:11:12] three-fold purpose y'all believe this
[1:11:15] tonight why did he have this purpose
[1:11:17] because he had these
[1:11:20] attributes because a purpose is simply
[1:11:24] an attribute looking to be
[1:11:27] expressed marriage and
[1:11:29] divorce he says what is God God is a
[1:11:33] great
[1:11:34] Eternal at at the beginning way back
[1:11:38] before there was a beginning he wasn't
[1:11:40] even God did you know that God is an
[1:11:42] object of worship and there wasn't
[1:11:44] nothing to worship him he lived
[1:11:47] alone and in him was
[1:11:50] attributes what is an attribute a
[1:11:54] thought
[1:11:56] see God's thoughts are different than
[1:11:59] mine and your
[1:12:01] thoughts yes see I got thoughts all the
[1:12:06] time now Sister Brandy might beg to
[1:12:09] differ with you she might say I don't
[1:12:11] ever think about nothing but I do I got
[1:12:13] thoughts I think about all kinds of
[1:12:16] stuff sometimes people think about too
[1:12:18] much stuff and they worry theirself to
[1:12:20] death over stuff they can't control and
[1:12:22] we got all kinds of thoughts in our mind
[1:12:24] but our thoughts sometimes they don't
[1:12:26] mean nothing our thoughts sometimes they
[1:12:29] just come and go sometimes it's a devil
[1:12:31] putting a thought in our mind or or we
[1:12:32] got some kind of weird thought or we got
[1:12:34] some kind of weird idea and it never it
[1:12:36] doesn't mean anything it's just thoughts
[1:12:38] and stuff in our head but that's not how
[1:12:40] God's thoughts are God's thoughts are
[1:12:43] attributes God's thoughts materialized
[1:12:46] God's thoughts are tangible God's
[1:12:48] thoughts are real tonight
[1:12:51] Saints God's thoughts have
[1:12:53] characteristics and tent and when God
[1:12:56] has a thought that thought never leaves
[1:12:58] it never stops it keeps on going it's
[1:13:01] always true and it's got to manifest and
[1:13:05] when he thought about you in this day
[1:13:08] you had to
[1:13:10] manifest you had to become a Believer
[1:13:12] because you were in the thoughts of
[1:13:21] God so God's thoughts they char
[1:13:25] characteristics their
[1:13:28] features now brother BR says notice
[1:13:31] right on down from that 153 he says
[1:13:33] notice he was his
[1:13:35] attributes that was in him and it was in
[1:13:39] him to be a father it was in him to be
[1:13:43] God it was in him to be
[1:13:46] son it was in him to be
[1:13:50] savior it was in him to be
[1:13:53] healer and all these things here are
[1:13:56] just displaying his
[1:13:59] attributes and he says there's nothing
[1:14:03] out of order you think God didn't see
[1:14:07] the end from the beginning see saints
[1:14:10] that already help you on a lot of
[1:14:11] sleepless nights right
[1:14:14] there you don't think God saw this
[1:14:17] problem
[1:14:18] coming you don't think God saw this
[1:14:20] trial that the church is going through
[1:14:23] you don't think God saw your financial
[1:14:25] needs you don't think God saw the
[1:14:28] sickness in your body you don't think
[1:14:30] God saw the trouble in your family he
[1:14:33] saw it before the foundation of the
[1:14:36] world and he predestinated its Saints
[1:14:39] and I don't know how he's going to do it
[1:14:41] but I know he promised that it's going
[1:14:42] to work together for our
[1:14:46] good amen we ought to be able to sleep
[1:14:48] like a
[1:14:49] baby amen we ought to go right to sleep
[1:14:51] and say hey God's got it all under
[1:14:54] control God's in control of my life he's
[1:14:57] in control of my family he's in control
[1:14:59] of my situation he's in control of my
[1:15:02] health you know what I can't leave this
[1:15:04] world until God's ready for
[1:15:08] me and when he is
[1:15:13] amen where was I
[1:15:16] at 55 he can't be a
[1:15:19] savior unless something is lost he can't
[1:15:23] be a Healer unless something is sick
[1:15:26] these things had to be that way God made
[1:15:29] them thus so that his great attributes
[1:15:32] could be displayed and if there wasn't
[1:15:35] that he'd have never been a savior but
[1:15:37] we know he was even before there was a
[1:15:40] time he was a savior he was a savior so
[1:15:44] there had to be something lost how's it
[1:15:47] going to be if he takes and loses
[1:15:50] it just in order to save it then he
[1:15:54] isn't just
[1:15:56] in his judgment he couldn't send a man
[1:15:59] to hell and be just he is kind gentle
[1:16:04] true honest and he is a great
[1:16:09] judge you must be born again let's read
[1:16:11] that he says then the great Holy Spirit
[1:16:14] went forth and spread forth his wings
[1:16:16] over the Earth and began to brooded for
[1:16:20] a
[1:16:22] purpose what's the meaning in all this
[1:16:25] to fulfill God's
[1:16:27] purpose and what and that was to bring
[1:16:31] forth something to project what God was
[1:16:35] see if we wasn't here nobody'd ever know
[1:16:39] what God was nobody ever know what God
[1:16:42] is you and I are the evidence that there
[1:16:45] is a
[1:16:47] God and I said the other night which was
[1:16:50] first The Sinner or the Savior that's
[1:16:53] what's that all about anyhow which was
[1:16:55] first a Healer or sickness why certainly
[1:16:58] a Healer C he says well why why did why
[1:17:02] did we ever become Sinners then it had
[1:17:04] to be that way it if God is a savior he
[1:17:08] had to have something to save so there's
[1:17:11] nothing wrong it's all just working his
[1:17:15] way now I I couldn't say this to Sinners
[1:17:18] I'm saying it to the minister see and
[1:17:20] the children of God you remember Paul
[1:17:22] said it would be revealed to the church
[1:17:26] the manifold wisdom of God he said I
[1:17:30] couldn't say this I'm saying it to the
[1:17:32] ministers and to the children of God
[1:17:34] it's all working all right no matter
[1:17:37] what we do or do not do it's going to
[1:17:41] come out right because God forne he
[1:17:48] ordained one more quote and then we'll
[1:17:50] move
[1:17:51] forward these quotes all right
[1:17:55] before there was a world this is
[1:17:56] questions and answers 59 before there
[1:17:58] was a world before there was a planet
[1:18:01] before there was a sun before there was
[1:18:03] a moon before there was a light before
[1:18:05] there was anything when it was still God
[1:18:07] God and His Thoughts The Eternal
[1:18:09] thoughts of God chose you by
[1:18:13] predestination and for knowledge to know
[1:18:17] listen to this to know that you would be
[1:18:20] on the earth to know there would be sin
[1:18:25] someone said then why did why was there
[1:18:27] sin it had if there had never been sin
[1:18:31] his attributes would have never been a
[1:18:33] savior there had to be a sinner so he
[1:18:36] could be a savior there had to be a sick
[1:18:39] man so he could be a Healer amen there
[1:18:42] you are it had to be that way it was God
[1:18:46] who saw it and foreordained it the devil
[1:18:49] ain't even in the race
[1:18:55] glory to
[1:18:57] God oh
[1:19:00] my amen the devil ain't even in the race
[1:19:04] he's just a stump on the side of the
[1:19:07] road that God used to bring children to
[1:19:11] him crying Abby father no wonder on that
[1:19:15] day how the angels will sing and when
[1:19:17] we're singing the Redemption Stories the
[1:19:20] angels are bow their head they don't
[1:19:22] know what we're talking about sure they
[1:19:24] never was lost they don't know what it
[1:19:26] is they don't know how good we feel to
[1:19:29] know which we which were once Sinners
[1:19:32] and alienated from God without hope
[1:19:35] without Mercy without God in one in a
[1:19:38] world of corruption dying going to a
[1:19:40] devil's hell and God stooped
[1:19:46] downall and picked us up and redeemed us
[1:19:52] and now we're above of the
[1:19:57] Angels glory to God Saints he can take a
[1:20:02] man in that condition and place him
[1:20:05] higher than the
[1:20:09] Angels oh can't nobody worship God like
[1:20:14] the
[1:20:15] redeemed that angel worships good but it
[1:20:19] ain't nothing like the
[1:20:22] redeemed God covets the worship of the
[1:20:30] redeemed so in him are attributes to be
[1:20:35] a
[1:20:38] God and not just like a Greek mythology
[1:20:43] God that's got that's got
[1:20:45] flaws this is a perfect
[1:20:49] God this is a
[1:20:51] god of love a god God of Justice a god
[1:20:57] of righteousness a perfect God his ways
[1:21:00] are just and right and lovely a God that
[1:21:04] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:21:07] infirmities that's the kind of God that
[1:21:10] was in him to be and that's what he's
[1:21:12] become for you and I tonight Psalms 5:4
[1:21:16] said Thou Art not a God that hath
[1:21:19] pleasure in wickedness neither shall
[1:21:21] evil dwell with thee
[1:21:26] it's only pure
[1:21:29] Holiness with our
[1:21:31] God he's attributes to be a father he's
[1:21:36] the author of
[1:21:38] Parenthood and and he's a perfect parent
[1:21:41] he's a perfect
[1:21:44] father an Earthly father can make
[1:21:46] mistakes but not our heavenly father
[1:21:49] I've made many mistakes with my children
[1:21:52] but my heavenly father's never made a
[1:21:54] mistake with
[1:21:56] me amen not this father an Earthly
[1:21:59] father can provide too much for a child
[1:22:02] or not enough and if you give a child
[1:22:04] too much you ruin
[1:22:06] him and if you don't give him enough you
[1:22:09] ruin him but our heavenly father gives
[1:22:11] us exactly what we
[1:22:19] need a Earthly father can he in judgment
[1:22:25] especially like if the kids are real
[1:22:30] cute and you know they need a
[1:22:33] weapon but you let your emotions get in
[1:22:36] there I mean not y'all I'm talking about
[1:22:38] me and maybe they missed the spanking
[1:22:41] they should have
[1:22:42] got that's an error in judgment let's
[1:22:45] just call it
[1:22:48] Grace but this father's judgment is
[1:22:53] perfect and Earth ly father can be
[1:22:55] emotional and it can skew their judgment
[1:22:58] you can you can react out of anger and
[1:23:00] it can skew your judgment you can you
[1:23:02] can react out of too much too much
[1:23:04] affection and it can skew your judgment
[1:23:06] to what's really going
[1:23:08] on you've seen people that they just
[1:23:10] they couldn't look at their kids and see
[1:23:12] what was going on they just had an air
[1:23:15] in
[1:23:17] judgment but not our Earthly father not
[1:23:20] our heavenly father he he his ways are
[1:23:23] righteous
[1:23:25] his judgment is righteous you know an
[1:23:28] Earthly father they can get fed up with
[1:23:33] you they can get tired of messing with
[1:23:35] you say Get on Up out of here go to your
[1:23:37] room I ain't got time to mess with you
[1:23:39] no more man sometimes you see in the
[1:23:42] world where people kick even boot their
[1:23:44] kids out they're done with them they
[1:23:46] don't want to mess with them no more I'm
[1:23:48] so glad that our heavenly father oh God
[1:23:53] doesn't kick us out when we do something
[1:23:55] wrong I'm so glad that I can make a
[1:23:58] mistake tonight Saints and still be a
[1:24:01] Christian I'm so glad that I can have
[1:24:04] faults and still be a believer I'm so
[1:24:07] glad that I can I can run to him and and
[1:24:10] offer my needs to him and I can mess up
[1:24:12] again and I can go back with the same
[1:24:16] need and I can keep going until I get it
[1:24:20] right I'm so glad I got a father like
[1:24:23] that
[1:24:25] he had attributes to be a son now an
[1:24:28] Earthly son can become
[1:24:30] rebellious you know an Earthly son can
[1:24:33] say uh I I don't want to do that I I
[1:24:37] don't want to follow in your footsteps
[1:24:39] but not this son he said not my will but
[1:24:43] thine be done an Earthly son can can
[1:24:46] decide he don't want no part of the
[1:24:47] father's business but the this son was
[1:24:50] always about the father's
[1:24:52] business amen I got got to move ahead
[1:24:55] savior he had not just a savior but he
[1:24:58] was a perfect
[1:25:01] sacrifice he's a Merciful Savior he's
[1:25:04] full of compassion he's full of grace
[1:25:07] he's full of Mercy he's also just but
[1:25:11] Saints there's Grace if we ask for it
[1:25:15] Saints and and he's full of love and
[1:25:17] understanding why does he understand
[1:25:19] because he was in all points tempted
[1:25:22] like we are
[1:25:25] he went through everything that you and
[1:25:27] I went through that you and I are going
[1:25:29] through he's been through it he knows
[1:25:31] what it feels like he's a Healer why
[1:25:35] because his purpose was to restore what
[1:25:38] was lost because his attribute is to be
[1:25:41] a
[1:25:42] Healer he wants to bring us back to what
[1:25:45] it was in the beginning brother Bram
[1:25:47] said back to where he walked in the cool
[1:25:49] of the evening with his people and
[1:25:52] talked with them and fellowship with
[1:25:55] see our bodies wasn't sick before the
[1:25:57] fall uh our body our minds wouldn't have
[1:26:00] been polluted before the fall there was
[1:26:02] no depression or anxiety or lust or
[1:26:05] things of the world in us before the
[1:26:07] fall it was the fall that brought all
[1:26:09] these things
[1:26:11] about now notice you and I have a
[1:26:15] desire and we have things that we want
[1:26:18] to do according to our purpose is that
[1:26:21] right and if we purpose to be an athlete
[1:26:24] there will be a desire to train and if
[1:26:26] we purpose to be a Christian there'll be
[1:26:28] a desire to hear the word of God and if
[1:26:30] we purpose to be brother George we'll
[1:26:32] just eat stuff all the
[1:26:36] time but many times when you and I
[1:26:38] compare ourself with a holy God when we
[1:26:42] compare our lives with the life of Jesus
[1:26:45] Christ when we compare our life even
[1:26:48] with the life of brother
[1:26:49] brandom when we compare oursel and we
[1:26:52] look at all the things that we got going
[1:26:54] going on in our life and we look at all
[1:26:56] of our struggles and all the trials that
[1:26:58] we're going through and all the
[1:26:59] Temptations in our life and all the pull
[1:27:02] in our life and all the negative in our
[1:27:05] life and all the people trying to weigh
[1:27:06] us down in our life sometimes it's hard
[1:27:09] to compare ourself to a holy
[1:27:13] God maybe maybe we get to thinking that
[1:27:16] if we're sick maybe we feel like we
[1:27:18] don't really deserve healing because of
[1:27:20] how we've lived or the things that we've
[1:27:22] done or the mistakes that we made or the
[1:27:25] trials but the will that we got in all
[1:27:26] that maybe we feel like we don't really
[1:27:28] deserve it because of all the mistakes
[1:27:30] and things we made or maybe we feel like
[1:27:32] we're bothering the
[1:27:34] Lord with our little bitty things like
[1:27:37] he doesn't have time to mess with our
[1:27:38] little insignificant things in our lives
[1:27:41] or maybe we feel like we're just not
[1:27:43] good enough to come and be delivered of
[1:27:45] the things that's bothering us or
[1:27:47] hindering
[1:27:48] us maybe we may think that our mistakes
[1:27:51] and our failures mean that we can never
[1:27:54] come to the Lord with our needs and we
[1:27:57] try to pull back and hide oursel from
[1:28:00] the Lord like Adam and Eve in the garden
[1:28:02] we try to run and hide we try to cover
[1:28:04] ourself up but these things are only
[1:28:07] because of this Fallen State and it was
[1:28:10] God's purpose Saints to redeem us back
[1:28:14] to our rightful
[1:28:17] estate meaning that it's God's
[1:28:20] desire to deliver you
[1:28:26] it's God's
[1:28:27] desire to heal you remember if his
[1:28:31] purpose is to restore us back to what we
[1:28:34] was when we walked with God in the cool
[1:28:37] of the evening if that was his if that
[1:28:39] was his purpose then the desire is
[1:28:42] already
[1:28:46] there it's his desire to heal you it's
[1:28:50] his desire to forgive you it's his
[1:28:52] desire to save you it's his desire to
[1:28:56] give you the Holy Ghost it's his desire
[1:28:58] to help you through your
[1:29:01] struggles it's his desire to heal your
[1:29:04] marriage it's his desire to touch your
[1:29:06] body it's his desire to take care of
[1:29:09] your family it's his desire to lift you
[1:29:11] from that anxiety it's his desire to
[1:29:14] take that depression out of your life
[1:29:15] it's his desire to do it you don't have
[1:29:17] to talk him into it he already wants to
[1:29:20] do
[1:29:22] it because because that is his
[1:29:29] purpose you say but I struggle brother
[1:29:33] George he
[1:29:35] knows he knows he knows your
[1:29:40] struggle you sound tested he knows
[1:29:43] you're tested he was tested
[1:29:47] too you say I got a lot of problems he
[1:29:49] knows what your problems
[1:29:51] are you say I got a lot of bad thoughts
[1:29:54] he knows what those thoughts are you
[1:29:56] can't hide them from him he already
[1:29:58] knows and we don't have to hide them
[1:30:01] from him he already knows what we are
[1:30:03] and he also knows where we're
[1:30:06] going and it's his desire to take us to
[1:30:10] where he has planned for us to
[1:30:14] be he knows where we fail he knows our
[1:30:18] mistakes and his purpose is to restore
[1:30:21] us back to where we can walk with him in
[1:30:24] the Garden of Eden in the cool of the
[1:30:27] day that's where we're headed back to
[1:30:34] Saints and it's his desire to make us
[1:30:40] whole it's his desire for you to be an
[1:30:43] overcomer amen it's his desire we don't
[1:30:47] have to act like we're something we're
[1:30:48] not we don't have to pretend to be
[1:30:50] something we're not we are what we are
[1:30:53] and we want want to get better we are
[1:30:55] what we are but we want to come up a
[1:30:57] little higher I am where I am right now
[1:31:00] but that's not where I want to be
[1:31:01] tomorrow I am where I am right now but
[1:31:03] that's not where I want to be next year
[1:31:05] I want to keep moving forward Saints I
[1:31:08] can't change what I am right now but I
[1:31:10] can change moving
[1:31:17] forward and he knows what it's like
[1:31:20] because he felt it
[1:31:22] himself yet he was without
[1:31:26] sin which gave him the
[1:31:29] right to take away our
[1:31:32] sin because he endured everything that
[1:31:35] we endure and remained sinless he was
[1:31:39] able to descend into hell and take the
[1:31:43] keys is that right
[1:31:48] Saints so today we don't have to be
[1:31:51] afraid of
[1:31:52] God we can run to
[1:31:56] God can the musicians
[1:31:58] come we don't have to be afraid to ask
[1:32:02] for something we can run to God and ask
[1:32:05] for it we don't we don't have to wonder
[1:32:09] if we're all right if it's G to be okay
[1:32:11] we can run to him and and lay it on his
[1:32:14] altar we have the privilege tonight do
[1:32:16] you want to read
[1:32:18] that let's turn in our
[1:32:20] Bibles while we close maybe that little
[1:32:22] song created me a clean Hearts this in
[1:32:25] Hebrews the fourth chapter and we'll
[1:32:29] close in Hebrews the fourth chapter he
[1:32:32] says the 11th verse he said let us labor
[1:32:35] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[1:32:38] any man fall after the same example of
[1:32:42] unbelief for the word of God is quick
[1:32:45] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:32:48] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:32:51] dividing aunder of the Soul and Spirit
[1:32:54] and the joints and Marrow and is a
[1:32:57] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:32:59] the
[1:33:00] heart so Saints we we try to hide things
[1:33:03] from God we can't hide it he's piercing
[1:33:07] even to the marrow of the bone he's a
[1:33:10] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:33:12] the
[1:33:13] hearts see neither uh neither 13th verse
[1:33:19] neither is there any creature that is
[1:33:20] not manifest in his sight but all things
[1:33:23] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[1:33:27] with whom we have to do so everything
