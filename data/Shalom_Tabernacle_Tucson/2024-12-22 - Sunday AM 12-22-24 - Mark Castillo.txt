speaks of wisdom Old North he's doing he's a he's a fountain of wisdom he's a fountain of experience he's a fountain of every good thing therefore he represented in this one like the son of man was clothed with this white hair hanging down Daniel saw him many hundred years 700 years and said he was the Ancient of Days one like the son of man come in power and United with this Ancient of Days and the Judgment was set now I want you to ask you something I'm speaking to you lukewarm Church 10 virgins went out to meet the Lord five of them as wise five foolish as we took this morning they Gras the tree now remember as they went out to meet God now watch the Bible said the books were open Daniel 79 the books were open that's the book of The Sinner and another book was opened who came with him the church from the Rapture oh tens of thousands times thousands times thousands of thousands came with him in minister to his wife the bride Glory his wife came within the church judgment was set and the books were open and another book was open which was the sleeping virgin and every man would judge thus from the book you'll be asked to give a reason why you didn't then what then oh amen you know better now you know better you might not know it before but you do now see wor if us righteous will scarcely be saved where will that Sinner and ungodly person appear the one who rejects knows better than rejects it where will they appear his feet like brass Divine judgment now let's see we're soon down at the end of the page now hair like wool and his eyes were flames of fire and his feet uh feet like brass burned in a furnace and his voice the sound of many water voice of many Waters what does Waters represent if you want to mark it down turn to Revelation 17:15 and you'll find the Bible said the waters which thou sawest is thickness and multitudes and people and tongues all right boys what a horrible thing for drifting Soul on the sea of life no P guiding loose floating with the tides to hear the Roar of the great cataracts The Falls what a horrible thing it would be to a soul drifting voice of many Waters what is this voice it's a judgment the voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many Waters cry out sickness and multitude the voice of those seven stars in his hands at every Church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name speaking in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming Divine judgment the voice of many Waters came forth from this what it look like the son of man many Waters what will be to know what you set in meetings and heard that you should get right with God and receive the Holy Ghost and a drifting soul to hear that voice speak out in that meeting that you set in and heard the judgments of God preach and refused it the Great Falls just below you the great cataracts that'll take you to your Eternal Doom voice of many water fourth personage of him voice of many words how you going to do it when it's recorded in glory when The Voice tonight is recorded your voice is recorded your thoughts are recording as a man thinketh in his heart so is he notice your voice is louder in heaven and your I mean your thoughts are louder in heaven and your voice is on the earth certainly is God knows the thoughts and the intents of the heart you know was all about he said to the Pharisees you Hypocrites how can you speak good things when out the abundance of heart speak of the mouth calling me master good and I know I look right through you and see that you're a hypocrite am you don't mean that oh what will that be on that day when that boy Thunders out of many Waters many Church ages forming out I want to ask you something else let me say something to you people saved let me say this to you are you drifting so you poor Drifter that's drifting over that great cataract got be careful it'll be a horrible thing when you know that there's no saving for you then you can't get saved then you know you're do L right before you when you know within a few minutes you'll hear that voice speak out depart from me you workers of iniquity into Everlasting fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels you know when you hear that Great Falls are roaring of those voices of those meetings while you're passing out of this oh what a horrible thing what a nightmare don't let it happen to you people repent get right with God now while you can get right now I want to ask you something now what is any sweeter to a man that's anchored laying back under the evergreen tree to hear the riing brook that's the church sitting in Heavenly places with the voice of God Rippling sweetly and talking to him see what it is it's a condemnation to The Sinner and a blessing to the saved a man who safely anchored his boat upon the rock Christ Jesus and just lays and listens how he can rest enter into that rest how I like to get where the waters are running we ever go fishing or anything I usually try to find me a place where the waters are Rippling C it just makes you rest you hear just talking all night oh my isn't it beautiful when you can really anchor your soul into Christ in such a place till you can get quiet before him and hear his voice speaking to you I'm the Lord that Health thee I'm the Lord that giveth the eternal life I love thee I Know Thee before the foundation of the world I put thy name upon the book Thou Art mine fear not it's me don't be afraid I'm with you thou sing I've anchored my soul in a Haven of Rest I'll sail a while see no more The Tempest May sweep over the wall stor me deep but in Jesus I'm safe ever more remember the very voice that speaks sweet to you will condemn The Sinner the very flood that saved Noah destroyed the sinner see what I mean the voice of many Waters watch now hair like wool and eyes like plams of fire feet like breath and a voice of many Waters and he had in his right hand seven stars seven stars now let's take the 20th verse right here and the Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou thought in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are seven angels or seven Messengers seven ministers all the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks the I sa are the seven churches he interprets it for us so that be sure there be no mistake an angel for each Church age oh that's going to be beautiful this week when we go back down in history pick up them angels and see the very Ministry they had they had the same Ministry exactly the same all down through the age in that little church sometime ago someone said you know the Catholic church is a good thing and it's a real church because it stood all down to the ages I said that's no mystery when it had all the government and everything else behind it how it stood and wave the storms but the mystery to me is how that little bit of minority that ever away the stor that was s of ster and so into lions and put on stretches and eat and burnt and Bel and killed and everything else and how they survived it it shows that the hand of God was with them that's all and still today her light's still burning amen yes sir now the Seven Stars that was in my right hand he had seven stars in his right hand which means the seven Ministers of Seven Ages oh it's beautiful how we go back and get the the minister that brought the message to the Ephesian church and the minister who brought the message and help with it unle death right down to the samna church into the pgus church the thra and all down through the age even into this age now the ministers that kept and brought the light and held it back like the original at the beginning and brought the light through he held them in his right hand think right hand doesn't exactly mean like Christ sitting on God's right hand it doesn't mean that God's got a right hand because God is the spirit but Christ was the right hand of power amen your right-and man the fell fellow stands by you the closest to you and remember the Seven Stars was in his right hand just think they were drawing their current their light from him they were completely under his control in his right hand every true servant of God is the same way help who can harm them who can harm them as one of the Angels Cried back there in the beginning remember an angel means messenger we get into those deeper things later in a week angel means messenger and he said what can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ can sickness amen can Peril can nakedness can sword can death I am persuaded said Paul that there's nothing can separate us from the love of God J right for we are completely yielded to his right hand somebody say holy R holy r that don't bother a bit you're a religious fanatic they don't even hear Hallelujah they're completely yielded and join their life from his right arm of power reflecting his light and meekness and kindness and gentleness and patience signs and wonders and miracles that the world call it witchcraft whatever they want to makes us no difference because we know we are yielding and in his right hand isn't that wonderful M now let's hurry because we don't want to wear you out in his right hand Seven Stars now the seventh and last um a representation of his person and out of his mouth goes a sharp two- sword I mean that's the sixth one out of his mouth goes a sharp 2-ag sword now l so many Waters and out of his mouth in his right hand he had the stars and out of his mouth goes a sharp two a sword now do you know what the sharp 2 sword of the Bible is let's just catch it so you'll know take Hebrews 4 and 2 just right back this a page or two and you'll get it Hebrews is just in behind Revelations here Jude and and Hebrews now get it close now or Hebrews fourth chapter of Hebrews here we are all right Hebrews the 4th chapter and the 12th verse for the word of God is quicker and and more powerful and sharper than any two- aged sword piercing even to the Divine center of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and the maror and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and then they call you a m it's the word of God made manifest in his church sharper than any two-edged sword see I just happened to think of something else I don't know where I wrote a script get Revelations 19 just a minute let's get this again I think that's right um maybe Revelations 19 uh about 11 and I saw Heavens open and behold a white horse Here Comes white again judgment and he that sat there on was was called faithful and true and in righteousness does he judge and make war you know who that was don't you all right his eyes were of flames of fire who was he and on his head was crowns uhoh he's done come over into the kingdom now and he had and and he had a name written that no man knew but himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God what went out of his mouth what went the white horse rider and Revelations also seven when I believe eight when the White Horse no six when the white horse rider went forth he was given a a bow to conquer and to conquer and a sword went out of his mouth what was he the white horse rider of Revelations notice the sword out of his mouth goes a sharp 2ag sword the word and finally by his word when it's made manifest to all the sons of God he'll cramp Every Nation down with his word by this sharp sword look at what happens as we get it and his right hand and out of his mouth when a sharp two- a sword and his countenances was like the sun shining in its strength a sharp two- AG sword what was going from the mouth of this person the word of God it's a sharp 2ag sword what was it doing Discerning the thoughts of the heart the intense goes even deeper than the meat the flesh the blood cells into the bone down into the M of the bone follow beyond that even to a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen that's what the word of God does and the Word was made flesh andwell among and now the word's made flesh in his church dwelling Among Us his angels in his hands Minister God is depending upon his church amen God is relying on us of this age to bring this gospel right to a dying Heathen bound traditional world Amen God's laying a burden on me and you you War to us if the Heathen dies without knowing it oh They Carried Reading Writing and rtic and a few religious pamphlets and made no more than a bunch of prelit I mean the gospel the gospel is not the word only Paul said so Paul said the gospel didn't come to us through word only but that word made manifest when the word by the Holy Ghost is the word is planted into the heart that's got the the Holy Ghost and produces what the word says it was and the word can discern the thoughts of the Heart Lord Glory a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word does goes from his mouth a sharp two- aged sword wake up the heathens something's got to happen one of these days yes the word of God his name was the word of God the word made manifest look Jesus said go into all the World Mark 16 is last salute to the church before he returns to reveal himself in the church age he commissioned the church go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature what preach the gospel Mark 16 preach the gospel to Every Creature what is that in other words demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost had to be and what they not just teach the word he never said go teach the word he said preach the gospel amen not teach the word preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe this gospel in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they would take up a serpent or drink a deadly thing you wouldn't harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and they went forth said the scripture preaching everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following amen that's the gospel the gospel on display these signs shall follow how many unto the end of the world to

come and move in us and live in US Lord and just let let us Proclaim as Paul Proclaim no longer I Paul living but Christ is living in me Lord that's how the world will see Jesus when they Con seeed in US Lord amen father it's not our works but it's you it's your word but thank you for giving us your word this morning bless this church bless brother Paul Lord as he is out Lord in the fish in in the in the fields Lord in the missionary work bless his ministry father I know he's a blessing even here but bless him out there also Lord Brother Hughes also Father a an elderly man should should be home already retired Lord enjoying life but here he is preaching Lord in another country father and oh what what a blessing he is to other folks Lord bless them Lord bring them home safely in the name of Jesus bless this church Lord the local Ministry those that stand at the post of Duty and your bride that is throughout the world this morning bless him also Father we ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you this morning you may be seated for a few moments I'll ask you to stand when we read the wor the the the scripture this morning I want to greet you all on behalf of evening light Tabernacle it's a small Church there in be we been there for over 40 years it is a work that my father started he felt led to open the Church of Message Church there and I never wanted to preach in my life and I never wanted to be a pastor and here I am doing both of them and uh so so my advice to you if you don't want to do something don't say it out loud because God's going to hear you and but I've come to find out that you know I don't have nothing to preach about in the first place anyways it's not my word it's God's word and I come to find the more I preach it the more I enjoy it because there is so much gold nuggets in God's word and I have been taught as as as a younger man that when we come to church we we we come with a little spiritual s Satchel little Satchel spiritual bag and every every word of God that you can pick up that is a gold nugget take it with you and and and enjoy it throughout the week in other words dwell on God's word because this what keeps us going in this hour uh you you mentioned brother Hughes and uh you know I I admire the the brother he's he's way past past 70 I used to think that 70 was old growing up I am 60 and 70 is not old it's just more experience you know uh as we get older it's like you know that's not old that's a good age you know and and and I admire the brother because he has such a love for the Lord and that is a result of a man when you live in a spiritual atmosphere when you feed your soul with God's word you live in a different atmosphere and the things of the world don't bother you you know we had the greatest example brother Brandon when he went to the the restaurant there playing that wild music in the background brother Bram had it all phased out because he was leaving in a different atmosphere and and Billy Paul says Dad that's a beautiful song He's like what song you talking about he said dad you you are so in love with Jesus you don't even hear nothing around you I thought wow what an what an example to have in this hour that we could live like that that nothing in this world bothers us because we are living in Heavenly places and that should apply when we come to the house of God because a lot of times when we come to the house of God you know we should be the most happiest people and I see people coming to church with a long face and I I've asked the church who who died because I never got to notice why is everybody sad we should be happy you know yes we have problems in life but leave your problems out there Jesus knows about them come in here with an open heart say Lord I Need you you know I got problems in life I'm struggling right now I don't know how many of you are struggling I'm struggling if I were to ask the question this morning how many of you are tired I would think that everyone would lift our hand and say I'm tired yes I slept 8 hours last night nine but I'm still tired because there is anointing in the air that has come upon this nation and it's draining the people Church all right and they're coming to church drained when it should be the other way around we should come ready with a joyous spirit Spirit of worship so so what if I'm broke I got Jesus so what if my body's falling apart I got one waiting for me that's Eternal I I I got glasses here Church they B focals and driving glasses who would ever thought I'd be wearing these things this is for old people but yet here I am oh there you are it's like but you know what that doesn't bother me you know I got a bald spot in the back it bothers everybody except for me I'm like why you bothered about it every hair that I lost it's waiting for me somewhere there was the time when I would roll down the window my hair was floating in the air you know oh being young but now I roll on the window nothing moves there's nothing to fly the hair is losing who cares I got one that's waiting for me that's Eternal knows no sick it's Eternal it's got more than 2020 Vision church but we we get so caught up in life in our in our in our mortal life you know our physical life that we let that drain us down and we forget we're not from here we're just passing through church one day there's going to be a Rapture we've been preaching about it for years one day there's going to be a Rapture and some of them I'm not going to say none of you some folks ain't going to make it in the Rapture news flash Church it ain't for everybody it's for those that have been filled with the Holy Ghost it's for those that have Jesus in you all right amen and and and I'm so glad that we have that opportunity to to get ready we're still here because the last one hasn't come in yet church and I tell my church maybe that last one is you you know we've been sitting here for 40 years in church and we still struggling good you know I use the analogy of a skinny guy who sees a magazine of a strong guy with a lot of muscles and he's like wow I want to be like that so what does he do he starts lifting weights first five pounds you know five pounds got start somewhere you after a week he's sore I'm so sore how much you lifting five pounds oh you weakling But as time passes by those five become 10 those 10 become 50 after a while we're benching 250 wow and he looks in the mirror he's he's been transformed he's different after you know 5 10 years it's transformation and I tell the church we've been in the message for 40 years and we're still in the same spot something is wrong somewhere all right and it ain't the word of God it ain't the message of the hour it's us church we got the problem but thank God for his grace he's still waiting on us cuz the last one hasn't come in yet but when the last one comes in I'm not here scolding you that's brother po job I'm just here to encourage you my my dad used to say I'm not here to judge you church I'm I'm not your judge even though I know your lives I know what you're doing I'm not your judge but when I preach the word of God you all are being judged by God's word amen and we've been here for so many years and we're still struggling why the last one hasn't come in yet but when the last one comes in brother brandham says the door to the Gentiles is closed and people are going to keep on leaving life like nothing but one day he's coming for a bride church I want to go home I don't know about you but I want to go home amen and that should be our desire this morning we want to go home that's why we have church that you might be encouraged with the word of God I I've had the privilege of preaching in Columbia since 2015 and I've preached in many churches and I've told the same thing too when I get there don't don't look at the messenger look at the message of the hour if you know your message and I quote the message you ought to be able to say Amen to that amen you should know your Bible amen why because we've been here for years we we we we know our scripture there are times when the minister is preaching and and he quotes a scripture in my mind I can finish the scripture why I've heard that for years but that ain't gonna do me no good if Christ ain't living in us and we need that church amen it's later than we think we think it's late but it's later than we think church and well God bless you this morning U I'm I'm glad to be here on behalf of the evening night Tabernacle they send their greetings my mother asked me to send the greetings to Sister Po and her family U my mother is uh just turned 80 years old and she's more on fire for the Lord now than ever I'm like wow she gave her heart to the Lord when she was 12 and she never turned back all right and she's gone she's still plays the piano in our church she's our only pianoist in the church and we're trying to get somebody to back her up cuz when she's gone you know we're going to need somebody to play the piano for us but my mother lives to play for the Lord and she loves it and and to me she's my she's my number one fan when your mother tells you m I love that message you did a good job that's right and I'm like wow wow I know my mom loved my message praise the Lord somebody loved it you know and and and and I really I really I really enjoy my mother she's she's a blessing to me and she sends greetings as well to every one of you and as the church does as well and so we're we're we're glad to be here this morning I brought with me brother Anthony H from lascas fellow friend and minister with me also as well and uh my wife couldn't make it because we had already a prior commitment and but um I'm I'm glad to be here this morning not because I want to preach I've never asked anybody in my life please put to preach I want to preach I got something to say never have I said in my whole life and I'm 61 years old when my dad was a preacher I never begged him to put me to preach Never As a matter of fact I ran the other way from from being wanting to preach uh and so but I'm here uh because I just love you all and I enjoy being here and I really I really appreciate your pastor I really do I'm not saying it because he's not here I'm sure he's going to hear the message later I ain't lying I really appreciate brother Po and he's one of our favorites at our convention I always try to get him to preach for us and I really enjoy his ministry he has a wonderful Ministry I know he loves the Lord and I know he loves you also pray for your pastor because pastors need prayer amen we ain't perfect we got we got fault we got errors you know we got mistakes we're human but we love the Lord with all our hearts and we're we're glad to be here this morning um if you'll stand with me this morning let us turn to the book of 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 1 we're going to read from verse 1 1 through verse 4 2 Timothy 41 all the way to 4 uh the title of the message this morning uh I've I've I've put uh sound Doctrine we're going to be speaking about a sound Doctrine this morning second Timothy verse 4 chap chapter 4 verse one excuse me and it reads I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appear as appearing and and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exort with all lungs suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own L shall be shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itchy ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables wow that sounds like a like a sad condition for we always think for those folks What a Sad condition but what about us this morning let us examine Our Lives including myself where are we at this morning with the word of God Amen uh Heavenly Father we just want to thank you for your your word this morning we know that it is blessed already father and your Prophet said that we are blessed when we read it Lord and but father we need more more of you this morning morning father as as we as we as we steal our soul and our spirit this morning Father come and speak to our hearts Lord that we can live from here happy because we heard your word with the the desire and and the strength to keep pressing on Lord we ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you may be seated my my father when he was preaching he was a very a very hard person to preach a very strong very strict and uh he he would always say you know if I wanted to I could fill up the church here in beard uh all I would have to do is just lower the standards and my church would get filled he would say and that sounds nice because when you're preaching to a full crowd there there's just a different anointing there because you're thinking wow we're all believers here but we know the prophet says there's three kinds of Believers there's the the believer the make believer and the unbeliever and we're very quick to point to the unbeliever all right hello he's an unbeliever how do you know well he don't come to church he don't sing he don't lift up his hands in church and and we're very quick to judge other people and the make believer you know he he he looks very religious on Sunday but what is he like on Monday because when when we're in church it's very easy to be very religious I you know I can get very emotionally in church I can raise up my hand say glory to God that's that's good brother and then come Monday drag my feet to work and just be a little devil that's a make believer but a Believer he he he he's he's a real deal because his life tells you what he is and to me uh uh my father was I'm not trying to to to uplift my father but my father was the real deal he he he was strict Church very strict and he would say I I I could fill it up and lower the standards to to to the word of God and feel these Church of he goes body goes I have been given one commission you would say and that's to preach a sound Doctrine yeah because one day I am going to have to answer for what I preached that's it amen and so through throughout the life of my father's Ministry you know our church Never Grow Big because my dad preached the word of God and the word of God in church it's hard but my mom used to say me it's only hard if you ain't living it because when you're living it it's very easy to say hey man brother preach it brother you you got to preach it preach it but when you ain't living it it's like oh can we just talk about love instead you know my my dad would say church if you can't say Amen at least say ouch say something but you know the word of God it's there to to form us it's there to correct us my mom when I was growing up she would Whit me and she had a famous saying M this is going to hurt me more than it's going to hurt you and I couldn't understand understand I I would get the whacking sister Po and I was jumping you speaking in tongues because it hurt you know and my mom was fine she wasn't nothing was hurting and I'm thinking what what kind of a statement is that this is going to hurt me more than you but I found out when I became a parent oh to have to to correct your children brother it hurt me but and my daughter would run away I thought oh my god that hurt me to correct them but you know what the reward was when she would come back with a little note Dad I'm so sorry I love you like wow because correction is love amen and sometimes God's got to put us in the hospital bed to get our attention he's got to he's got to put through a little squeeze to get our attention he's got to remind us who we are because sometimes we forget who we are we've been in this message for so many years it becomes so coming to us Prophet The Prophet said yeah he said but what are you doing about what he said is a question all right amen we you know 40 years have been passing by you know I asked the church one day how many of you got five years and a couple of hands you know went up how many got 10 a couple of few you know 30 40 I read my I've been in this message 40 years I go wow that's a lot of years passing by and why are we still struggling God help us this morning church amen we're not here to judge but let let us examine our lives where are we and what should we be doing in this last hour that we are living in what is our Focus this morning you know uh I was listening to the the song you sang this morning beautiful songs and and and right now we're in that Spirit of a Christmas throughout the whole world and I was listening to a radio station the other day a Christmas uh station singing a song about It's a Wonderful Time of the Year you know and just you know the snow bells ringing and whatever Dash into the snow I'm like wow and not once they mention Jesus I said what's going on here they've taken Jesus and put him you know back in the major and they're out there shopping like crazy people H you know if you don't get a gift for Christmas this here don't feel bad you already got the greatest gift ever Church Jesus Christ amen and and I and and I wonder you know what Have We Become with this last hour we we've forgotten Jesus Jesus Lord don't ever let me forget your mercies don't ever let me forget you know sometimes I walk out of my backyard and I don't have a brand new home I've got an adobe house I'm happy with that you know why because when I leave it's staying behind and sometimes I walk out to my yard and say Lord I got more than I can handle why would I want more I can't even keep up with my yard brother George when are you going to cut the grass why already cut it last week when he's cutting again like good grief why do it keep growing for you know we we can't handle what we have and I think but but yet the most important thing that we have sometimes we neglect it because life is so busy for us and we we forget God's goodness and we forget his grace amen I heard say one time he says many times I've trampled God's mercy right what he say have you ever trampled God's mercy before you when you know you should have done something you did it and God's mercy he spares you he but I could never do that to God's grace because his grace is always sufficient amen God help us in this last hour I I was looking at your program actually I opened up my Bible today and I was and the first thing I pulled up was a flyer from Shalom Tabernacle 2021 when you had your annual meetings and and and the the the quote that brother Paul put there whoever put it there oh we're going to give a credit to the pastor it says and the Gentiles are called out the bride is ready that that was the quote he put on the little marker that I have there I used to keep him in my Bible to remind me you know of what the theme was and it says here brother BR says here the bride is ready the Rapture is at hand can we realize that can we actually believe that is it a story that's been told is it a myth to us is it a something that sounds real is it something that we outside can believe or is it something that's in us that's part of us you know there's a difference between feeling the presence and being filled with the presence right that's good yes sir because we go to church you and I see Sinners and and backsliders they're out there crying like wow they're being blessed but it's just a blessing but there's a difference between being blessed and being fi Church all right and what the church needs is a feeling and once you get the feeling you become a blessing church amen that's good is it is something that we we have that we that we outside can believe it or is it something that is in us that's part of us that it's more than life to us is is living for the Lord more than life to you ask yourself that question when you wake up in the morning why are we here in the first place why was I born in this last hour why did the message come to me of all the friends that I had in school why am I the only one that got to hear the message of all the friends that we had in the Apostolic Church growing up you know why are we the only on that accepted it my my my dad had in his family 19 brothers and sisters wow from the first my first grandma she she only had one son she died at a young age of 16 because she caught on fire with a kerosene iron and she burned to death and then my grandpa married again my grandma Delina and she had 19 children and my father was the eighth of all the men and the only one that turned out to be a minister why and what was that my father in the apostolic church he was already looking for a prophet they didn't preach it but my father he had that Revelation when you read malah 45 you said wow if it's here why hasn't it being fulfilled at and where is Malachi 45 at and he began to look for this prophet in the apostolic church at the age of 17 years old looking for prophet and I and I think to myself why us why did I have a father was looking for this message why was I born in that family I could have been born in another family not even know nothing about Christ but God and His Mercy he he placed me there under good tutorship but we we forget sometimes who we are and where we come from amen you know Sunday becomes so coming to us it's Sunday again one day somebody complained in our church we're not going to name names to protect Innocent but they said why are we always singing Amazing Grace I'm like oh God have mercy brother I already gave away who he was it was a brother I said brother it's God's Amazing Grace every day amen and if we sing it four times in a row it's God's Amazing Grace why you complaining when we sing Amazing Grace well can we sing in our song yeah we can but what's wrong with Amazing Grace do you not like the part where it says a richet like me We complaining and suddenly becom so coming to us oh when they ask the question who's going to preach is brother po again hello we we we we we posted the the on our church whose schedu to preach on Sunday and depending on who's preaching it will you know how many are coming to church wow oh he's going to preach again I had one family leave because they didn't like the way one one Minister preached and they left the church I'm like wow what can they do you know it's the word of God doesn't matter who preach preaches it it's still the word of God church God help us and and it says What attitude do we set in this morning in this Tabernacle brother Brenham asked that question in 1964 and we asked it again this morning what attitude do we sit in this morning in this time what is my attitude this morning why am I here you know why do I serve the Lord why do I want to be in church you know when I was a young person we couldn't wait for church to finish hello when they would say when when the Min would say oh I'm getting ready to close up we like yeah he going to close yes then he go on for five more minutes like I thought he said close he's a liing he said he was going to close it 10 minutes ago and we just couldn't wait together the church and my my dad ask Miho it's slowing what should we do Dad we should cancel the church because it's dangerous out there you got Stow in the highway folks coming to church they could be in an accident Dad we don't want that anymore that my dad is a pastor asking me those questions and I would say Dad let's cancel cuz I was the assistant pastor it's it's a safety reason and then I became the pastor and it started slowing one day and I got started getting text brother are we going to Cel I said no we're coming to church if you can get to work you can get to church you know we don't like being late to work why we'll get fired but we have a problem coming to church late I I don't like going to church late I really don't but sometimes I got people that are running late that make me late we're not going to mention names cuz they ain't here but to me it come this early it's the time to reflect on God's blessings church amen and he say this morning remember it'll be a small flock that receives it not everybody will receive it not everybody will understand it when when my father was looking for a prophet my mom couldn't understand how is that you're looking for a prophet you didn't understand you know even to the point where bbam talks about wearing a ring my mom had a problem wearing the ring because in the apostolic church that was considered worldly was called Julie from the world it was worldly and my mom my my dad bought my mom a ring she wanted a very simple one oh God bless women that like simple stuff well you going to buy me a ring dear I got to have big diamond so everybody can see it my mom wanted a real simple ring I she goes babe I just want something real simple and when she put it on she would hide it from my grandfather when we go to his house and she would serve with her right hand only like that and reach over here and serve over here and you know and one time she happened to go like this to serve something and my grandpa went like this when my grandpa seen his daughter had a ring on and he didn't say nothing after dinner he called my dad meaka come here what's this right there your wife is wearing and my dad stood up saying dad God sent a prophet in this hour and he tolds about the ring and how that that ring it it it tells the world that that woman belongs to another man and my grandfather he says he just is they say nothing else but my mom was was that way she just you know for the longest time she were a veil because she was used to wearing a veil but when she got the Revelation the veil came off am and she embraced this message with all of her heart and to this day she still loves the Lord I I was reading the flyer here and this quote caught my attention this morning's uh the battle the greatest battle ever fought and what come my word was the word whack I never know the the brother use the word whack cuz I used to get whack growing up it was whack for the wrong reasons of course but BR says here whether it be a demon whether it be enemy whether it be sickness whether it be disease whatever it is take the word and pull it with the sword he always pointed back to the word amen that is the job of the ministry today is to point us back to the word church don't don't look at me because I make mistakes sometimes my words don't come out right but don't look at me look to God's word my my my job this morning is to point you to Christ Jesus and he says if you whack it the first time and it don't seem to move whack it again how I want to get whack this morning I do Lord if I need whacking whack me I know it's going to hurt yes but I know you do it with love if I need whacking Lord whack me he says whack it again if it if it don't if it don't seem to move whack it again and whack it again and whack it again right and whack it until you've chipped a hole through like a little chicken peeping outside of a or an eagle what you are peep yourself right through that old Shell of sickness cut your way out and say hallelujah where's the next one amen that's the battle that's the soldier that's the soldier of the cross I think he goes in line with the message this morning of a sound Doctrine amen because we are living in a time where there's so much doctrines coming up from the pulpit church right now we as M beli to have a job we need to know our message and the word of God Amen because today a lot of people they don't hear the message and whatever the minister says amen he must know he he Amen to that and we have so many different doctrines today that I have to ask myself where did they come from when did Brother R ever say that there was an eighth messenger everything runs in sevens in the Bible seven spirits seven Church agents seven Messengers where did the eth one come in you know but it just goes to show that we are living in an hour where those things are to rise up in this last last hour BR Braham says that the hour that we're living in the condition that has risen up it is meant to be for that hour that we are living in that's why it it behooves us Church in this morning to stand on the word of God brother B asked this question and he's asks the question and he says oh brother what does a good pastor have to do today just do the best he can to stand out and cut the limbs where they want to and let the chips fall in where they want to and sling it out there that's all yes sir that's right don't spare anybody just preach the word and stay right with it just Hammer right away you know hammer and Quack they kind of go together with each other if they throw you in jail preach in jail in jail if you're put away anywhere else preach everywhere you go just keep on preaching that's right now that's what's happen see they're smoothing it out revive me return on to me and let me tell you something when the Holy Ghost comes back it brings new birth and new life it brings a conversion the baptism of the spirit brings the church back to itself again it puts life back in the church you know we don't have to wait for a convention to have a Revival we can have a Revival with three people in the church you you you get one person that's on fire for the Lord huh that's contagious after a while that anointing falls on you oh and guess what now we got two on fire for the Lord after while that fire begins to spread Church you know oh what a glorious thing when we can come to church and if there's only 10 people in church we can have a Revival with 10 people church but but the thing is nobody comes with a fire they're they're like well I need for the song leader to inspire me I need the message to move me if brother Paul don't move me then then I I what's what's wrong with him no what's wrong with you what's wrong with us Church you know there are times that I can't sleep at night I wake up at 1:00 in the morning 2:00 in the morning when I was working I slept all night long now that I'm the pastor I can't sleep and I wake up at 1:00 in the morning and I'm there looking at Darkness can't fall asleep you know and I'll put a h of brother brandom on no I'm not trying to act religious this is just what I do I put on tape of brother Brandon and within 5 minutes I fall asleep I get you fell asleep listening to a taper of the Mark I sure did because that anointing it soothe me amen plus I get to hear the Lord speaking to me at 1:00 in the morning and sometimes I'll wake up again and B is still preaching and I'll hear the more message and then fall asleep again and there ain't nothing wrong with that church the problem is falling asleep in church chur when you're hearing the tape that's the problem and a lot of time when you see the church members are like they say their final amen and they're out and sometimes I'll I I'll hear the message and from there I I get inspiration to preach something on Sunday because you know you heard people say well I've heard it all I've heard it all before I've heard that tape before again well hear it again cuz you probably miss something that's right amen it's like breakfast you have breakfast yesterday you're going to skip breakfast today and the rest of your life no I need breakfast again today it's the same with the word of God we got to hear it every day bam says that a good Christian will pray every day and read the word of God every day and we have an excuse because our phones nowadays have apps that pop up with a quote of the day and the scripture of the day that's right you don't even have to look for it it's right there beep quote of the day but how many of us actually take time to read it church God help us the the the gospel brother Brenham says commonly believed is the word of God and that is true in one sense but the word of God is Not gospel alone the word of God is the seed that produces the gospel okay amen Ephesians 6:12 says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual weaknesses in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withand in the evil day having and having done all to stand remember say when you can't do no more you just keep standed when's got going to do it I don't know but I'm going to keep standing on his word it gets worse that the world gets worse and worse but I'm going to keep standing on God's word church you know when we were growing up my parents did not want to send us to elementary school this was back in 1968 you know why cuz the schools were perverted they said 1968 the world the schools were perverted my parents they were so so so in tune with God that you know back in 68 going to school was a perversion but they committed us in into the hands of the Lord and we went to school you know and we did pretty good yeah I never got whacked in school cuz if I got whacked in school I'd get whacked at home and you know what I I did pretty good because I had good parents that instilled in us the things of God so I I managed to graduate through high school 12 years did pretty good never got into a fight never I got picked on many times but I always had a bodyguard that would stand up and say before you whack wiow you whack me first they would say so I never had to fight fight I'm like yeah it's a good thing cuz I have whooped him and then when my grandkids or my kids were born I thought wow schools are perverted now I got to send my kids to school how do I do it and we we brought them before the church and we prayed said Lord we commit our children into your hands they're going to school father watch over them in this perverse generation you know what my kid graduated through school did pretty good never got into a fight and then the grandkids came oh where now you can pick what sex you want to be H you know what my wife did called my oldest son my oldest grandson say m Come here grandma wants to talk to you and made him standing right there and she says Mi listen to me listen to me you are a boy amen repeat after me what are you I'm a boy that's right you you are a boy why because the school are so perverted now amen and they have more rights than you do that's right huh and and if you talk about about them you can get in trouble you see how the world is changing it's getting worse and worse it's getting darker and darker church but you know what hasn't changed the word of God he said says I am still the same yesterday today and forever and if you live to be 100 years old and you die guess what on the day you die he's still the same yesterday today and forever he don't change church amen we we're living in a evil age brother you know growing up going to prayer meeting was easy why you could get into the spirit very quick Brother people were prayed up youd go to the altar everybody would come to the altar back in back in those days we'd all come to the alar we start praying after a while the power would come down and there's people speaking in tongues crying you know oh glorious glorious thing prayer is one of the most glorious tools we have church prayer is so is precious when you can be shutting with God by yourself and just cry out to him you know you don't have to use fancy words in your Simplicity of your of your language you speak to him but today my God to have prayer meeting it's a battle just to break through that barrier why because the devil knows that his time's running out the one that doesn't know it is us but the devil knows and we're living in the last hour you know Hebrews 11 3940 it speaks of the gentile people you and me this morning it says and these all having obtained a good report support through faith Reed not the promise when when I look back and I see men like Samson men like like like Daniel you know was taken as a prison to a different country with different laws the man had enough Revelation to stand on God's word and not be contaminated with the things around him and and the Bible says God having provided something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect and and when you when you stop and see their lives what they live like what they went through and then you compare it to our life today what have we done to deserve this church no wonder brother bam says he goes H having seen the life that they lived how will we stand before him on that day with our small testimony and be compared to those that lived back in those days back then there were to the blood of animals hello Church the blood of an animal the life of the animal couldn't return back to the worshipper it was animal life but today we are covered under the blood of Jesus and that life in the blood it returns back to the worshipper and it changes him and it transforms him and it makes him you know people say well I can't be perfect yes you can you can be perfect in this hour when he lives in you it's no longer you living but it's Christ Living in you Christ speaking in you you Christ working through you church amen yes you know the Saints in Ephesians Church age they did not know when the Lord would come for his bride but they live for him with that expectation that one day he was coming for them and guess what the Ephesian age it finished and the new age began and those Believers had the same hope that one day they were going to go into Rapture but guess what that age passed they left behind a good testimony though and the Third Church age the fourth Church age the fifth Church age six and then we got to the seventh where Jesus was on the outside yes knocking trying to get back into the church in this hour God sent a prophet now it's no wonder that many people worship the prophet because they seen something in him him right you know when you got so much of God in you people are going to look at you more than a human they're going to look at you as a God but BR Bram never wanted no one to worship him he always pointed us to Jesus Christ I I had a Apostolic ask me one day I went for a walk in one of the parks by her house and I was walking getting some exercises and I happened to run to her and her son and she asked me uh brother Castile can I ask you a question like yes sister ask me a question she goes do you guys pray in brother brenham's name I said what where'd you get that from do do you baptize I go what where'd you get that from I said sister I go you know my dad better than that my dad fell in love with Jesus long time ago I go and this Prophet that God sent in this last hour he's always pointed us back to Jesus Christ you know he's never been about himself he always point to Jesus Christ find me a message where brother Brandon boasts about himself you'll never find a church he always pointed back to Jesus Christ I said sister he always pointed back to Jesus Christ because throughout the ages religion got watered down they put Jesus outside but God in his grace sent a prophet to point us back to Jesus to get us back on track I said we don't worship no man we you know M man failure but it's God that we worship that's in that man amen like he should be in every one of us this morning Christ in you Christ in me the the hope of Glory Church the reason for the season you look at our world today and they came up with a guy called The Grinch I never saw the Grinch in the manger where where did he come from but the world has gone so commercialized today that they they they've created create creatures to replace the one and only creation Christ how would you feel if you if you came from the last Church age or the third Church age or the first church age or the sixth or the fourth or the 5ifth and the Lord would tell you even though you have been faithful he would tell you this promise is not for you it's for the last Church age how would you feel and he would say because I have a group at the end time that must first come and be made perfect with this message you know never consider yourself better than anybody else brother Braham says remain remain humble be humble amen don't don't boast of what what you can do keep keep keep in your Simplicity and God honor Simplicity the the the one of the biggest examples that we have was brother brandham you know find me a man today that called any Scrolls into existence find me a man that that that stopped the storm huh find me man today where God told him would you like to walk with me how would you feel one morning you woke up and you heard a voice that says would you like to walk with me today huj what would you say well can we go after breakfast I got a schedule no brother if the Lord speaks to you drop everything and walk with him because that's what he's telling us today walk with me even though you're living in the most terrible time it's a glorious time because in this hour I am coming for a bride I will have a bride in this last hour church but yet God in his grace let us be part of Malachi 45 who would have thought that we'd be part of Malachi 45 in this last hour huh think about that God was going to have a bride in this last hour and I'm part of that bride what did I do God having provided something better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect in other words they're waiting for us Church H they've been waiting a long time they've been waiting a long time for us to get ready church and I don't know what it's going to take it's unfortunate that it takes a squeeze to draw Us close together have you notice that whenever there's a death in the family all of a sudden everybody's there oh Primo I love you I love you too bro even though I haven't seen you in 10 years and And yet when when when the squeeze comes that's the time to unite the people why it takes it I don't know but that's what it's going to take to unite the bride church it's going to take a squeeze that without us they should not be made perfect perfected with what with a sound Doctrine the word of God amen amen everything you need to know is in the word of God I I I I I tell you that that if you're that if you're feeling lonely you're feeling depressed hear a message if you feel like you're sick you can't make it the burden too great hear message if you feel like you're alone nobody loves you hear a message because to me it's nothing but love church for his children this hour and we have access to it any hour of the day you don't have to wait till tape service on Wednesday to hear a tape hear one tomorrow hear one tonight when you're cleaning the house when you're ironing hear a message I have a sister in the church who every day all day long listens to messages like don't you anything better to do than listen to messages no and then when you come to church when she goes to church I see the difference a worshiper the the woman's going blind from one eye she she's really able to walk but she still got Strength In Her Arms to do this she can still sing even though she can't see the screen she can still sing she can still say praise the Lord thank you Jesus she can still cry out in her condition why because she's standing on something that's solid her hope is not in her health it's not in her vision it's in how she walks whatever her hope is in here that one day she'll be transformed from a mortal to an immortality to live with her Savior Jesus forever and when I see her as a pastor she inspires me she in inspires you Pastor you're the pastor yes when I see people that are struggling in the church that that are worshiping they're crying it moves me because I see that the humanity is crying out for something greater and they're in the best place to be the house of God church amen how did Jesus defeat Satan with the word if you're Jesus you know go up there and jump from The Pinacle and your angel will will will save you that no one's scrash will come upon you what did Jesus say well I could have done that easy but he said it is written my word is written veram says now we find him as soon as God Came Upon him he was anointed went into the Wilderness and out for 40 days and defeated Satan by the word of God what did he do he brought any Divine promise in reach of the weakest Christian well I'm not a weak chrisan I've been in this message 40 years you're still a weak Christian cuz you haven't left yet that's right we haven't gone the Rapture yet he brought any Divine promise in reach of the Wiest Christian if he was God why did he let Satan say or Satan say if thou be the Son of God perform a miracle here and show me you can do it turn these stones into bread and eat them you think Jesus could have done it sure he could have not only just bread but cinnamon rolls with a cup of coffee here you here extra but no he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word every word that proceeds from the mouth of God so then as Satan always tries to quot the word went back and told him when he put him on the Pinnacle of the temple he said and Jesus responded it is written and he defeated Satan on the word of God what's going to defeat him today Church the word of God but not the word of God in the Shelf it's got to be the word of God in you because it's okay to have the word of God there in your house with the open up to certain scripture it's nice yeah beautiful it's nice to walk into your house and see that you got the Bible there spread there's no you know Mall's magazines there no comic books it's the word of God wow beautiful looks beauti there on on the on the living room table but it needs to be in you not on the coffee table that shows that you can defeat Satan this is Brother Bram speaking and who's speaking to brother brandham who's speaking through him God Amen that shows that you can defeat Satan on the word of God no matter the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any conditions if it's in the belly of a whale or if it's in a lion's den if it's on the bed with cancer or if it's laying Yonder bleeding to death in an automobile accident the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere that's right and the weakest Christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do so you know people have a have a comment today well I'm an American it's my right you really don't have a right but as a Christian we have a right to God's word that even the Wiest Christian can use it because it's a god-given privilege glory to his name you know the word of God should make us happy it should we have to listen to a tape on Wednesday all hour of it I brother you should be happy that you're listening to it because there's people in Hell the way they could be listening to it right now too right but we're here every chance of the door opens come to the house of God you know when when Co came in the church is shut a lot of folks were happy yeah the make believer and the unbeliever yeah why well they closed church I can't go now I was going to go on Sunday but Co closed it you liar I I walked the church one day and there was eldie sister crying I'm like what is going on there and I asked the sister why is she crying because you're closing the church on Sunday because of covid like wow I wish everybody would have been crying but every chance the door comes open we should have the desire to want to be in the house of God we should have the Longing To want to be in the house of God to come and sing to the Lord to come and hear a message doesn't matter who's preaching or who who's speaking I I want to be you know a brother from columia told Miho when you come to church it's between you and Jesus and that's it but sometimes we want to please our neighbor forget the neighbor if he don't want to raise your hand you raise it if he can't say Amen or she can't say Amen you say Amen if it's the word of God you say Amen to the word of God church because it's between you and Jesus because you don't know if this is the last message you'll ever hear and when you get there and they ask you where were you at when you died well I was in church and what were they preaching um I think they were talking about Jesus brother you better know where you're standing at in this hour cuz the hour is getting late it's later than we think church amen my my my father he one day he got up and he scolded us I used to hate getting scolded I still don't like it when my wife and my daughter calledo me dad you did it wrong oh sorry and my dad said my dad got up before the church one day and he said I have preached from Genesis to Revelations I have preached from Revelations to Genesis and you still can't get it he told us he was whacking us from the pullit he said what I'm going to do he said for one year he goes we're going to listen to brother bram's tapes for one whole year in this church and back in 2010 we heard tapes of brother brandham on Sunday and on Wednesday and the next Sunday brother bandham again on Wednesday brother B again for a whole year we heard brother brand and people thought we had converted to tapes only but they didn't realize the pro that that that the pastor did it for a reason because he wanted us to be held accountable that on that day we would have no excuse church we have no excuse we've heard it all amen we've read it all amen we've gone to many church services we've heard God preach and speak to us we'll have no excuses and he told us at the end of the year then I'll start preaching again and so for a whole year brother BR him in our church we got criticized but you know what the pastor will have to answer for that that was his doing and I'm glad he did it amen because there's no greater voice to hear than the prophet that's why when I preach I'm always quoting from the prophet where else I'm going to get my message from if not from the prophet the message of the hour and then at the end of 2010 on January the 1st when he got to the pulpit he started preaching a message entitled unconcerned and talk about getting quacked again and he even told in that message that he was leaving and no one paid attention to that and he preached unconcerned three times and then the Lord took him home why because he had a burden in his heart for the people that they had to get stable or they have to stand on this word of God and he always pointed us to the word of God and he was so Adam that that that that we come to church why are we here we're here to get fed spiritually so we can grow spiritually because we all want to go home church amen we should leave in the house of God happy not condemned or sad we should leave the house of God happy knowing that God is speaking to us in this last hour even in dreams God speaks to us church I was I I uh one of the brothers from the church sent me a video of a of a 88y old woman who was in the late stages of dementia and they asked this woman in the video they asked her if she knew what her address was and she said um no I don't know where I live at and they asked her well do you know what you ate last night and she was like uh no I don't know what I ate last night an 88y old woman and they asked her well do you know who Linda is and she's like uh um Linda no I don't know who Linda is well do you know who Paul is no I don't know who Paul is and they asked her well do you know Jesus and she said oh he's the one that died for me and he lives in my heart and one day he's going to take me home I thought wow forget the world forget your family not in a bad way forget everything in life forget how much money you have in the bank and don't ever forget Jesus though because when you come to the end of your life that's all that's going to matter brother is this in you when you're breathing your last breath you're not going to be thinking about oh my inheritance my my my my properties no you're going to be thinking Lord I'm going to see you soon I'm going to see you soon Lord Jesus it be the most glorious hour for you why Christ Living in you uh the the the definition of song Doctrine in closing is sound Doctrine is teaching it's it's it's a teaching that rightly explains what God has revealed to us in his work B is what sound Doctrine is sound Doctrine is essential to the church and to a Christian life because our founder who is Jesus Christ left for us an empty tomb because it is a central means of which we grow to maturity in Christ and the more you have of Christ the more you grow to be like Christ after a while that's all you think about is Christ and about getting home one day and you and you prepare yourself to get ready for that glorious day when you are going home church when whenever I preach at a funeral service it's not for the dead person it's for the ones that are still alive and I tell them this is to remind us that one day we too will be here amen and that's all right death is all right if you're ready to go meet the Lord my mother had a meeting with her sons about five months ago and she told us here is all my will my death papers who's going to get what what what what's going to go to you when when the death comes when the time comes where I want to be buried that uh the funeral Serv who's going to speak and she says and she goes if I I I'm start to die and and and and I die do not resuscitate me she said do not bring me back to life she said leave me alone because all my life I have prepared for this moment I thought wow what what words of a mother that all her life she's prepared for what to go meet her savior Lord Jesus Christ the word will do that church in you if the word is in you that's what you'll live for not for your next promotion not for your next you know brand new car you know you know when I was growing up and they were preaching Jesus is coming I used to think man I'm never going to get married Jesus is coming it's not fair then I became a teenager and you know and then I fell in love with my wife and we got married and I thought and we're still preaching Jesus is coming I'm thinking well I'm never going to have children Jesus is coming now I got three children and then we're still preaching Jesus is coming and I thought I'll never have grandchildren now I got two of them and guess what we're still preaching Jesus is coming but you know what it's closer now than when it was when we began our journey the first time amen you know sometimes some of my most inspired messages come at 1:00 in the morning when I'm laying in bed and and I'm talking to the Lord in in Simplicity because I I don't try to be fancy I just started be my Simplicity with with him and I begin to speak to the Lord in in in in there at 1:00 2:00 in the morning and and and in and speaking in Simplicity to the Lord I I begin to feel his presence and I start to cry because I'm thinking about his word at 1 2 o'clock in the morning you know and and I I'm trying to be quiet because my wife is you know sleeping next to me and and and I don't want to wake up and I just stay I just cry and like wow what a blessing when we can find ourselves in Heavenly places when you can realize that nothing matters around you but his word his hope that he gives to us nothing matters in the world but living for him church one day it's all going to come to an nend church one day the last message will be preached maybe from this Pulpit maybe the last day will come when there'll be no more churches open and you better have enough of Christ in you to endure that squeeze church because by yourself will not make it Christ has to be in us what is endure it is lasting over a period of time it's durable to endure to to be able to withstand the the trials of Life the the hardship of Life endure them a sound Doctrine the bride will know her word she will know her Jesus the world cannot deceive the bride neither can Satan de deceive the bride this is why it's so important to know where you stand and if your doctrine that you believe is sound amen there's nothing wrong with the the the word of God God sent his word and then he sent a message and this message points to the word of God and this word of God points to the message there is no confusion there there's a lot of things I don't understand I can't explain but I believe it why did God do it a certain way I don't know but his plans are perfect amen God's plans are perfect and all I can do is stand on the word of God let me say this in closing the end time messenger and the message should meet the end time conditions don't you think so the pram says that the end time message and the conditions they have to meet the end time conditions the message could not have been preached 40 years ago no no the end time message and the messenger has got to meet back there in them days they had it probably it wouldn't have worked but it's got to cope with end time conditions be converted believe the gospel signs that's the message of today wash your souls in the blood of the lamb and believe the gospel that the end time signs are here the seed of the Gospel has been taking place we are living in that hour Church look at the conditions around us it's worse than Sodom and gomorah Sodom and Gomorrah was confined to one city today it's a disease spread throughout the whole world it's worse and and who is that a signed for it's a signed for the bride to let us know that it's later than we think when you know know who you are when you have recognized who you are and you hear this message it should make you cry it should make you H it should make you tremble it should make you shout should make you jump make you pray more if there was a time that we need to pray it's today church amen I tell I tell the church you guys can pray throughout the day you don't have to be on your knees pray in your heart when you're driving Pray when you're going to work Pray when if you have a time pray pray pray G get that communication between you and God open again it's clogged up right now but open it up because God wants to hear from us God wants to move in our midst church but he's limited with our unbelief get closer to him and cry out glory to God I am a believer of malakiah 45 Isaiah was talking about me in this hour the only thing that's going to make a difference in this hour Church church is his word amen God help us to recognize it God help us to examine Our Lives daily that we can draw close to him I don't know about you but I need more of the Lord Church yesterday's blessings were good but today I need more blessings and if God get me tomorrow I'm going to need blessings tomorrow as well church amen God bless you this morning what a what a privilege it has been to be in the house of God to share with you his word I trust that it'll be a blessing to you pray for your pastor amen you know um when when he leaves I hope you miss him when he leaves I don't know you do or not whenever I take out to the field they'll tell me you're taking off again I'm like yeah I'm go preach why you got to go again you know and and then when I'm there they don't show up to church so I'm thinking like well then I'm leaving then you know but if you're really love your pastor pray for him he has a tremendous job responsibility in this hour to preach the sound Doctrine as well amen pray that God will give him strength pray for the ministry here pray for the bride everywhere amen there there's there's a struggles going on in in in this world today amongst the bride brother we need to know where we're standing at in this hour God help us to recognize the hour that we're living in amen God bless let us stand to our feet this morning as to go before the Lord there's a scripture the Bible that says one thing I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple to me this is one of the most glorious places to be is in the house of the Lord church we can come and speak to him from our hearts he knows what we need but he wants to hear us

brother Israel coming back on this long trip home and Lord will give him strength and help him this project we got going on I know he wants to be here and it's been nice to see each one even if you just stop by and say hi and uh it's been real good at the church come stop by and see it coming along my understanding it was it was an Apostolic church is that right brother John and Pilgrim Holiness uh even better I guess I don't know but really founded on the word and they've maybe gotten away from that a little bit but the Lord knew this was our church from the foundation of the world so we're starting at the bottom the the whole floor is out up to the ceiling it's all getting kind of fixed up and so we just continue to work through that together and um so Aaron will be there uh tomorrow morning and she can use some help so talk to her about what she's doing if you can help or maybe every day this week I don't know but the work day is Saturday the morning 8 to 12 8 to 3 something like that so uh if you could just touch Bas and and she's got a list that we need to work through just keep working through everything to get her get her ready um Wednesday we will have a worship in the morning if you can sing a song or do something that we're we're singing about the Lord we're talking about his birth let's come worship him if you're able to like to do that on on Wednesday and again church tonight at 5: brother Chris is that everything I miss anything Brother Scott brother Chuck Aaron so I think we got her covered so we'll continue the the lovely name of Jesus keep our sister Deborah on your heart and your prayers the Lord will just bring her through you're dismissed yes and one a lovely name the name of our Jesus reaching higher far than the brightest star oh yes it's
