it's good to be back in the house the Lord we'll be listening to the remainder of a thinking man's filter tonight and finish up that message that we started last week and I was reflecting today Saints on just I was just thinking about where I would be if God hadn't sent a prophet in this day and uh have you ever done that just thought about what might happen What Might Have Been of your life if if God hadn't to called you and God hadn't pulled you out and and I was thinking how thankful I am that God sent me a message and give me ears to hear it and a heart to receive it and because if he hadn't I would my estimation I would either be dead or in prison somewhere and I thought also about where would a church be tonight without a message without a TI poost without an absolute where would the church be what condition would the church be in well you can just look at every Church in the world today and tell where we would be and so how thankful we should be that we've got the voice that we have tonight and we don't come here and and have to listen to a tape we come here and get to listen to a tape and I'm so grateful that we got a voice that that that that no matter what any other voice we hear and politics and religion and the world today there's a voice that we can tie ourself to that we know will put us in a Rapture and so for that I was I'm so grateful you know for the elect's sake he did that and part of the portion of the message that we listened to last week brother Braham said my eyes cannot deny my hand and he said my foot or my toe or any part of me they can't deny it and neither can a man that's a part of the word of God or a woman deny one part of the word of God and he said that women when you think you can have bobbed hair and come into presence of God you're wrong you see he said you're wrong you can't come through God's filter whether you're Washed by the Water of the word he said then you enter into the fellowship by the washing of the water the word he said we enter into fellowship with him and he says you think that you are but you can't be until you come through the word and every little spot every little word of God he says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word it's got to come through that filtration aren't you thankful tonight for the filtration that no matter what anybody else says you can run it through God's filter and see if it's right or not he says and that gives a righteous man's taste he says because that's what he's looking for is that what you're looking for tonight Saints he says looking for something to cleanse him and that's what we want tonight Saints is to be cleansed by the word of God and he goes on and he says the word of God is a thinking man's filter and it makes a righteous man's taste and he says we know that's true filters all sin of unbelief out there's no more disbelief when you come through the filter because it's it's a true believer's taste and a True Believer wants to be right regardless a True Believer wants to be right Saints if we're wrong we want to be right if we want to be if there's something in our life that's off we want to be corrected but but our heart's desire is to be right tonight do y'all believe that amen let's just sing only believe as we listen to God's Prophet finish this message of a thinking man's filter oh only be only be all things are possible only believe only believe only be all things are possible only be amen God bless you tonight as we hear God servant and Prophet brother brand you may be seated a thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of God my sheep you hear my voice a stranger they will I for down in there is life and life connects with life sin connects with sin and sin is so H hypocritical until it thinks that it's saved when it isn't S it's in the very depths of hypocrisy church members want a denomination filter so that they can have their own desire and still still be class religious people you hear say oh very religious in Africa out there one day and it's talking about these some of the kids that talk about these rock and roll songs at Elvis Presley and Emma sing and Pat Boon and whatever more Ricky Nelson and all them others I said there are a bunch of Renegades some little girls said well he's very religious I said so was Judas I said Judas only got 30 pieces of silver Elvis Pressley got million dollars they both sold out their birth right I said there nothing the very worse than denate the nation's God still just as deceiving as the filter of the cigarette these denominations let those members come in they ought to even be a there ought to be a law that they couldn't sing religious songs against or be against the law from to do it but the whole thing's become one great big pile of hypocrisy there's where they St today the truth for the soul says if you love the world are the things of the world the love of God's not even in you see you can't you can't say rock and roll is of the world is of the god rock and roll is of the world any of those dances and filtered nasty filthy things rather is of the world all of the world you can't say that bobbed hair for a woman is of God the Bible says this not so it's a filth of the world and if you love one Speck of the world the love of God's not even in see what's that what's drawing it it's something down on the inside drawing the soul is drawing your resource to the outside down through the spirit into the soul and if the soul loves the world it's dead I don't care how much anointed it is out here how righteous it is I hear down in here it's dead for he that loves the world are the things the world the love of God's not even in him no matter how religious the true filter that way will will set all those things out and bring nothing but the tress of God the word into their real true Soul they're like Esau out okay Esau was religious on the outside and when it comes to religion it see to be more religious than Jacob was you see to be a better man than Jacob was but the inside of him what he was his outwardly the religion but his thinking was not filtered he didn't think right of the birthright he he didn't think that God the birthright meant as much as God said it did D voice said I'm hungry what difference it make about the old birth right you can have it if you want it oh my see I go to church I'm just as good as you are my denomination just as that's one of the greatest in the world my mother belong to it my father belong to it all this that and the other my pastor was educated he's got so and so that putch in that much farther from God that ain't a thinking man's filter if it would how could Peter ever been what he was when he couldn't sign his own name but he packed the thinking man's filter notice oh my Esau thought that that birth right didn't mean what God said it did that was the difference between life and death and so like Eve and like Judas sold their Birthright for a satisfaction of the taste of the knowledge of civilization that's exactly what Eve sold her birthrights for she sold it for a little taste of science a little taste of worldly knowledge a little better church a little better glass of people today it would be called see and Judas sold his birth rights for 30 pieces of silver to make a few extra dollars my congregation can pay me better over here and I'll just preach over here see sold up I become a preacher well they said brother BR we believe that message is the truth but we can't accept it if we did well where would we preach at the world brother that's the parish certainly well none of the Brethren would back me up I I ain't looking for none of the Brethren to back me up I'm looking for Jesus Christ to back me up because he stood by he's the one who said it and when the true Birthright the blood filled out by the word of all sin and the world and church and denominations and sectarianism is Left Outside education civilization church denomination system sin of all types is left outside when a thinking man takes a thinking man's filter in God's estimation there's nothing left in it when a man draws his his life through a God's filter notice here your life is all messed up with sin because you were borned in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies I'm going to say something as brother mull used to say listen to me when you come in this world you were born in sin you didn't even come with a Fighting Chance you were borned in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lives within your own Spirit the desire of sin a lover sin because you were born in sin you didn't have a chance but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that be to draw if you know it but something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read his word and you took the church you took their ideas when you was told better then you'd never use the thinking man's filter but when you use God's filter which is the thinking man's filter because all other filters will pass away but mine shall not and when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter a thinking man's filter there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost now if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is when that soul of your align with the word of God in every respect shows you draw your life through the thinking man's filter God filter notice is that God's filter he said we was Washed by the Water of the word and when God gave Adam and Eve a filter in the Garden of Eden he said don't you draw none of this in there but Satan punched the hole in say oh it's a little bit won't hurt just one drop too it's all it took to St death into the human race that's all it takes just one take the nicotine then they're gone there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost and then that shows that in you was that predestinated seed down in you that makes you hungry for God all the father has given me has given me to redeem they died with me at Calvary they raised with me in the resurrection all that he has given me will come to me they'll be placed in the body where foot arm nose mouth whatever it is they'll be placed in there and they will come to me in their season oh my There Is that real filteration of all the sin of the world and the love of the world is dead and the soul is drawing only one thing here it is don't remember don't forget it all you out there on the telephone set this down in your mind when a thinking man but begins to think who he's going to stand before and what the word of God is when he begins to think then when he draws to that there's nothing can get to it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning sty here drawing the seed life the seed is in your heart before ordination Hallelujah the seed is already in there by the for knowledge of God predestinated and when it draws it can't draw through nothing else but the word and then it's the taste of the thinking man the righteous man the holy man who sees the Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever what comes into that place down there that word that's in the heart of hid Thy word in my heart that s not against what is it when it's drawing through the word there's only one thing will pass through the word that's the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that can pass through the word is the Holy Ghost and a thinking man's filter gives a holy man A Taste then he's tasted of the Heavenly P he's got the word of God in his heart he sees it manifested before him and his whole Soul's wrapped into and the world and all things is dead around him a thinking man's filter of religion and I'm thinking of filtering religion now when a thinking man's filter gives a holy man's taste see it satisfies his taste he sees that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there it is see right before us doing the same things he did it satisfies the holy man's taste his thinking he knows then that he's pass some death into life and he loves and and it loves for the world to be confirmed and wants the word to be confirmed and Vindicated in each age he waits for it for he is a holy man and he's got a desire to see God others just wants to join church this man wants to see God he don't see him in a bunch of Creeds he don't see him in big fine pipe organs or Cathedrals and high crosses are polished up Scholars with their collars turned around he doesn't see him in theolog in a theologian he sees him in the confirmation of his word I seen him in the watch firir of my eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord he's tramping out the Vintage where The Grapes of Wrath are stored he's loose of faithful lightning with his terrible Swift sword his truth keeps marching on it will to the end yes sir see what I mean a filter man or thinking man's filter a man that wants to stand in the presence of God what was God's filter his word that day you eat thereof that day you die don't care what's happening out here don't you pass that word washed By the Waters of the word a thinking man's filter not a denomination not a Creed not a church not a cathedral but a thinking man's filter for you're going to be judged by the word a thinking man will think that a foolish man or a taste of the world will just take anything a substitute why a substitute when there's a real one think just think of it a minute a woman speaking in tongues with bobbed hair and lipstick on and then the church still holds to it that's the evidence the Holy Ghost or a preacher from a seminary or some Bible School using the trinitarian baptism or compromising with the words of some Creed or denomination is that a thinking man's filter not the way I see it brother it's a foolish man drawing through that right could you imagine that instead of using God's word as a filter for his soul letting that old Creed and denomination piling on top of him like that instead of taking God's word for a filter and then he's all contaminated and let him induce into him doctrines of man doing things almost deceiving the very elected and neglecting the word when he could draw to his own soul if there's anything in there to draw about but if that predestinated seed don't miss this if if that predestinated seed is not in there it will not draw through there because it'll draw for its desire if a smoking man wants a smoking man's taste and if he got a hold of a stick I say suck your finger and he's stood there stuck in his finger well he said that's silly why his taste is for nicotine so he's not a thinking man see but he said I don't I don't taste nothing I want to taste the I want to taste the backa I don't taste the thing give him a clo pin let him suck on that they suck on that he said I don't taste nothing what you sucking on it for then you've got a desire to taste nicotine and when you're sucking on a church Creed and still you women wear bobbed hair painted faces and is sexy dress and you man look at them and all these other things and carry on the way you do what is it what's in there the world still in there and you got a taste you're pulling on it for a taste I go to this church and don't ever name that thing they don't say nothing about this nothing about that none of these things are brought up our preacher is more wide minded than that we don't say things like that what is it you've got the taste of the world you're sucking for right but a thinking woman won't take that kind of a thing she knows she's got to be holy and the only thing that you can draw through God's word is the spirit the quickening power to make the word itself which is in you live to manifest Jesus Christ in the age of your living Hallelujah brother if that ain't the truth I don't know what the truth is I've lost my mind if that isn't the truth it is the word itself in your heart predestinated there that's drawing and spits out that world it don't want it but when it gets over here in the word it begins to draw and when it draws to the word it can be nothing else but the holy ghost that Quicken that word than a thinking religious man's filter is the word and it satisfies that Holy taste that's in his heart a thinking man's filter a holy man's taste oh my what we're into instead of using God's filter for his soul he's letting Satan deceive him by some denomination or Creed just exactly like the tobacco companies are deceiving you people who smoke cigarettes you just get more members and that's all oh let me close in a few minutes saying this blind lay your how blind can we blind L your see the leading the blind of this age under false pretense under false Creeds under dogmas is false under denomination it's false under Creed books it's false oh Blind Lady leading the blind you're all headed for the ditch change your filter to tonight preacher don't draw that denominational nicotine into your system of dogmas and Creeds which Jesus said whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it when you tell your congregation right them women to do that those men to do it and all these things that other as long as they stay true to this and do that and keep these Creeds and things aren't you ashamed of yourself blind Pharisees Jesus said and Jesus Christ blind Pharisees the Holy Spirit My Own Heart Tonight cries Blind Lady oia how God would have give you a Revival but now your time has come it's too late now how did you laugh and make fun of the people that God sent to you but now your time has come oh United States in United States how that God would have hovered you as a brw h do there br but you would not now this voice is going from coast to coast from north to south from east to west how God would have hovered you but you would not now your time has come nations are breaking the world is falling apart, 1500 mile chunk of it three or 400 miles wide we're sank hundred or maybe 40 miles down into that great fall out down one of these days and waves will shoot come out to the state of Kentucky and when it does it'll shake the world so hard that everything on top of it will shake down oh hide me in the Rock of Ages God let me let me breathe upon me Lord Spirit of the Living God Breathe on Me Let Me Take God's filter and live under that Lord let me breathe the fresh air of the Holy Ghost into my lungs and my soul each day that I sin not against you oh Lord breathe on me Holy Spirit Breathe on Me I let me plant the word of God in my heart and purpose there that I'll not turn to the right hand or to the left hand away from it but I'll live true to it all the days of my life oh Father God then sent down upon me the Holy Spirit of life to Quicken those words to me that I might manifest Jesus Christ before those who are before me to looking forward to happen that's my prayer oh my no how they do to in those churches sucking the people to those denominational Fields Into The ecumenical council why why for it gives them the desire of their heart organization they have a taste for organization they'll do it every time God send them Revival they what they do they organize it that right so they got their kind of filter because they've got a great taste and now God's go to give them their desire their taste he's going to give them they're sucking them right into the ecumenical council and then they get their organizational taste then they got it coming oh Church of Lady AA don't be deceived in this age by their deceptions old Pentecost you who've gone into lady OA you who are part of Lady oia the church dead through Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian just a ritualistic form but you Pentecostal who can still once in a while say Amen who can play a lot of music up on a platform and have Bob head women dancing all over the place and still do believe in Divine Healing how off God would have tuck you but you tuck another filter a denominational filter how off God would have tuck you how deceiving it was Matthew 24:24 Jesus said that the it would deceive the very elected if it was possible how close that you are just like Eve just leaving off one or two little things that you wouldn't receive because you're organized and can't receive it that's all that takes us might as well take the whole thing part to offend in the least is guilty of the whole oh Pentecost Pentecost pass thy thinking through God's filter not your denominational dreams and you will come out with a holy man's taste the true baptism of the Holy Spirit could you imagine a man letting his wife cut her hair wear shorts or wear slacks and say he's coming through a thinking men's filter could you imagine a man doing a thing like that can you imagine a preacher standing the pulpit because he's paid good by a congregation that Pats him on the back calls him doctor brother Reverend takes him out to all kinds of parties where he mixed bathing and everything else on the beaches could you imagine a man claiming he's coming through a thinking man's filter and some of those women on a platform with their dresses above their knees and cuts of tight and shows every Farm every move they makeing their underneath clothes showing through their dresses just as bad as is wearing sharks bikinis or anything else you Pentecostal Blind Lady of sin preachers how long will God suffer you I don't know be God be merciful to your to your blind eyes he's got eyes sa tonight to open your eyes that you might see as I said this morning we're in the seeing age the top there's no more faculties above that that you can move outwardly to know you from your nose you can smell from your lips you can speak from your hands you can feel and reach and your feet and so forth but you can't go farther than your eyes Malachi 4 has come sight it shall be light about the evening time oh walk in the light we'll walk in the light that beautiful light that comes for the DW drops of Mercy are bright shine All Around Me by day and by night Jesus the word the light of the world Len pass through it oh brother and you will come out a with a holy man's taste with a holy ghost oh woman just pass your modern thinking of dress pass your modern thinking before you got out on the street before men you young women you old women before you go out on the street where your clothes to tight pushed out in the back and front I'm not critical I'm your brother I stand between the living and the dead and realize what I'm saying before you enter out and know that your body is a sacred order a sacred cast that God has given you before you enter the street dress like that pass your mind through a thinking woman's filter and let it remember that whosoever looks upon you to lust that you you have committed adultery with him already remember that sister and brother before you turn your head to look at her on that Second Glance pass your mind through a thinking man's filter you'll come out with a holy man's Taste of doing what's right notice if you pass your mind through a thinking woman's filter you'll come out with a holy woman's dress that's right you'll come out brother with a holy man's look now that's just one thing everything that you do pass it through the filter of God's word see if it's right or wrong you'll come out with a holy woman's dress with long hair decently dressed a quite humble Spirit not up brawling and fighting and carrying on a quite Meek Spirit which is a great treasure from God the Bible said so now I want to ask you something out in the lands we're going to close in a few minutes now let us all tonight check our desires and then you can see what kind of a filter you've been drawing through let's check each one of us here and out Across the Nation check your desires what you want really in life check what you're fighting for check what you're here for check what you go to church for what makes you it's good to go to church but don't just don't go to church only that won't save you he just check just a few minutes say is my objective what what kind of a filter am I drawing to anyhow and if you won't cope with the word of God and your soul don't do it then need something wrong for it shows up your taste that the life what kind of a life is in you if it's a holy discreet honorable it'll come out that way if it isn't you've got another taste in you you're drawing from exactly right if the taste is the word of God and the will of God then you know what what's in you what's drawing The Taste shows you are a part of that word that word is in you drawing from the word what's it drawing it's drawing through the word because you are a part of the body of Christ of this age and if that word is in you it can only draw through the word the spirit that quickens that word that's in you this the word alone won't live that's the reason all the father has given me will come to me and if I be lifted up I'll draw all man unto me see see the Father the part of the body of Christ that's in the world predestinated put into the heart any man that's a real Christian born again today knows since he was a little kid or a little girl either that there was something in you that hungered for God and you tried joining churches and everything else it wouldn't work why was it it was that word you was hunting for a filter and one day ADV before you you seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that satisfied The Taste because life is in you drawing see the life in you is drawing it's it's telling what desire you got you're you're pulling you can't pull through this and that and the other you've got to find that right filter because you're a thinking person if you're a thinking person you are predestinated or filtered for from the for the foundation of the world and if a denominational Minister hears this I hope that he takes the thinking man's filter if he's a denomination Minister then he'll throw down that denominational pack that's sure to perish because it's a word of man and accept God's filtered word that can never fail nor pass away and it will suit the holy man's taste and like Jacob will sacrifice all the world and the appetites of every denomination or fame that there is in the world where you can be Bishop Cardinal where you can be a state preser or Pastor some great church you'll sacrifice everything that there is not like Esau to become part of the world but like Jacob you'll give everything you got to obtain the birth right the filtered of the thinking man because it'll give you the holy man's taste and it will satisfy and it be satisfy and will sanctify with the Eternal Taste of the Holy goodness of God remember Satan punched the first hole through Eve's mind or her thinking to let the taste of his wisdom and knowledge get through now think of this I'm closing Satan punched the first hole through because all she could draw was the word that was the spirit through the word of God because she's said as long as you breathe through this filter you'll never die but you take a breath of this I hear it you'll die see and Satan said but you don't know nothing here but you take a little taste of this year and then you'll know you'll be like God see he knows right wrong you don't and if you just take a little taste of this and she let him punch a hole in it just one little hole now you see why I say say why don't you teach women and so forth how to receive gifts and things like that I said how can you teach them algebra when they won't even learn their ABC one little hole all it took he took the world's wisdom and when he did it set death to the whole family wanting to taste of wisdom now look at the filter and certainly it expressed her taste her taste was for the world that's what she's got that's what it is today they love the the world and the things of the world with a form of godliness but denying the power thereof see Satan let him speak in tongues he let him shout he let him have Divine Healing service he let do all these kind of things he say many will come to me that day and Lord have not I cast out Devils have not I done many things done this he say I didn't even know you you worker of iniquity when the word was placed right before you and you still sucked that old filter of the world see shows the taste that was in the heart doves cannot eat a Caren they cannot eat it they don't have any Gall a crow can eat the seed like a dove and can eat a car like a crow see because he's a hypocrite but a dove is not built like any other Bird that's why God represent himself as a dove descending from Heaven see it cannot it cannot stand the stink of a can it's not vulture the reason it don't have any Gall it couldn't digest it it would kill it if it eat it and a dove never has to take a bath a Dove's body puts out oil from the inside that keeps it clean it's a life that's in the Dove it generates in it an oil that keeps the feathers clean and so is a Christian there's a life within him that keeps them clean it's filtered oh notice now look at he at the filter and certainly you can see the taste thereof of what they're doing today look at this modern Church look at the filter you can see what they love see what they got the love what do they love miss lady oia which is hated for God's judgment that's right the love the church love today is for lady oia a great organization a great setup a great poer thing F dressed people highly cultured full of wisdom full of the devil am under the deceit of the Church of Christ there's only one word ought to be in there Antichrist or everything that Christ taught they're against practically everything just enough so they can call themselves that now if you are a thinking people tonight here and out in the land where the message is going your desire will be a Bible taste not a denominational taste for you will be judged by the very Bible the word that I'm asking you to filter your soul through and to reject one word of it and not let your soul pass through that one word you'll be turn down for a man shall not live Breathe by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God it will be brought into you predestinated and when the Lord breathes upon you his spirit will Quicken that word to a reality and you'll see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh my leave the world's denomination religious pack let it lay like that cigarette pack in the woods Let It Rock in the Cain it's it's a wrong filter and take the word which is Christ that gives and reaches and preserves the taste of eternal life to everyone that will take it eternal life the word if you're are predestinated you SI there's no way to hide it from you you look there and say watch this plain before my face I look at it there it is I'm looking right at it I see it there it is the word every word just word by word living out then there's a taste of eternal life that you want and when you breathe through that what can come through that God's filter nothing but the spirit no world at all no unel at all it's God's filter and when you breathe through that nothing can get through that but the Holy Ghost now you got the evidence of the Holy Ghost see uh God holy man or woman's taste they want to live they got eternal life and because it's words quickened to them they live a thinking man's filter and a holy man's taste don't take the world like them cigarette companies under deception but take the real thinking man's filter filter the breath that you breathe the food that you eat everything that you are breathing through God's word and you'll have a holy man's taste for it will produce that for he's the same yesterday today and forever and I know whether we are whether we are not I believe that we are but if we are not there's somebody in the world today that's part of the body of Christ and it will live only by the word of God every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God for this age that we're living in now and I can't see where denomination of those words so plainly in the Bible said it would happen and the things that would be in here we are living right in it now I can't see where it could be anything else for this church I realize I've got to stand with you in the Judgment someday father be it for me to ever tell you anything wrong for popularity I don't want that if I had my desire i' just my human desire I'd take my rifle and go to the woods and build me a cabin and trap the rest of my life I'm getting old tired weary and broke down but I can't quit there's something in me grinding W unto me if I don't tell the truth and the whole truth War to me if I don't stand here till the last breath of body has left me I must stand regardless of what anyone else says I'm responsible before God and I truly believe that the thing that we're preaching is the truth not because it's me preaching it no my brother no sir God knows my heart I would like to sit out in the congregation and listen to to the anointed preach how much easier it would be on me certainly because I'd have eternal life as same as the man in the Pulpit I'm a part of it as same as he is I go to the same heaven have the same privileges how easy it would be for me to sit out there and not take all these bruises and beats and carry on how easy it would be we're out there all night with no sleep an hour and a half or two hours wrestling all night with things that's come up how easy it for me to do that take up my gun the next morning my fishing rod and go fishing or hunting how easy it would be brother if my lot God help me to never shun my post of Duty but to stand loyal and true and produce to you a thinking man's filter that'll give you a holy man's taste the thinking man filter is the Waters of the Waters of Separation it's a purification from sin which is the word of God and the thinking man the man that knows he's got to stand before God knows he's got to answer for every word of the Bible it'll satisfy that taste that's in your heart may God help us to receive it as we bow our heads dear God another hour or two has passed on the clock has moved around now the message now goes into history and it's recorded on the book we all have to answer now for this every move that we made every word that we said every thought went through your mind the record is still playing and it'll play on till life is over and then we'll answer at the day of the Judgment oh God the great creator of heavens and earth whom we do believe I pray for this people of this day I pray for myself with them that Lord Jesus that you'll hold your filter and if I'm saying anything sacriligious Lord I in my heart I don't know it I pray that if it's wrong for me to take your word and use such a thing as that you forgive me for it but Lord I thought when you spoke to me there in the woods you know the time in the morning it just I couldn't get it off my mind I accepted it as coming from you so father God I have already spoken and I pray God that you'll let it be in the way that I thought it to be that the thinking man the man if he's got any thinking at all he'll know he has to stand in the presence of God and he won't take into his soul anything that contaminates or it's contrary to the word of God father we realize that as I compared it with these organizations of the day not to be different Lord you'll judge me someday from my heart and I pray God that you'll see that it wasn't to be different but it was to be honest to try to be sincere realizing I hold the purchase of your blood from coast to coast right now in my hand and many of them has believe the report God Of Heaven May there not be one of them lost I claim them everyone and hold before them the filter from sin the Waters of Separation the blood of Jesus Christ the word made flesh Grant it Lord May the Holy Spirit pour through every promise into our souls and may we be living representatives of the Bride of Jesus Christ in the time of the eyes of the seeing in the evening light for we present it to you in Jesus Christ's name praise the Lord did you enjoy the message tonight amen like brother Brandon said now we know the truth and the whole truth I was uh I was thinking about this quote that he that he um mentioned there he said any man that's a real Christian born again today knows since he was a little kid or a little girl either that there was something in you that hungered for God and you tried joining churches and everything else and it wouldn't work what was it he said it was that word you was hunting for a filter and one day it flashed before you and you seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen no matter what your testimony is Saints I think we all probably knew there was something different about us amen prayer request tonight um looks like a sister Deborah mcti may be in the hospital right now or heading to the hospital is that right and so we want to

was bothering me just struggling to to move and work and everything I did hurt sitting or standing laying whatever hurt and I come in for a communion service the last communion service and my back was just coming in two and I said if I can just get through that communion line I feel like the Lord will touch my back and so we had communion that night and while the sisters was still back in the back I come up and asked brother Israel to pray for me and so we had a little word of prayer there and I went back uh to my Pew there and and God is my witness Saints a hand touched me on the back or grabbed my shoulder from behind and I turned around because I thought it was brother John but brother John and sister Joy wasn't here that weekend there was nobody back there but a hand touched my back and uh and so that was right here right at Communion right after communion these and so I knew for sure that God was going to touch my back and so I went went home that night with it hurting just as bad as it ever did and when I got up the next morning I'd forgotten all about it and I didn't remember it until I was getting dressed and realized that I was getting dressed painfree and by the grace of God not one ounce of pain in my back since that time amen so he's the same yesterday today and forever amen maybe we could sing that little Song Glory Glory Hallelujah that was brother Randon
