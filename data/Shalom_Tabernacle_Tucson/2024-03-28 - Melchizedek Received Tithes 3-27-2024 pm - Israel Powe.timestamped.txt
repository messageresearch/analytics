[27:22] word of prayer Lord Jesus we thank you
[27:24] for bringing us together once again Lord
[27:27] we thank you for the atmosphere of your
[27:30] presence Lord the Praises of your people
[27:33] you inhabit the Praises and Lord is a
[27:37] sacrifice many times but receive our our
[27:41] the fruits of our lips give him praise
[27:43] Lord receive that tonight Lord we give
[27:46] you the honor the glory and all the
[27:49] praise we ask your blessings upon each
[27:51] one father in Jesus name amen amen God
[27:57] bless each of you we're so happy to be
[27:59] in the house of the Lord with you this
[28:01] evening like to welcome all our visitors
[28:03] and friends and Saints of the most high
[28:07] God give you welcome you to the house of
[28:11] the Lord this evening we wanted to
[28:14] continue just a little bit a little
[28:17] series we started on conduct order and
[28:19] Doctrine and then uh we didn't we went
[28:23] through just to give it a title I guess
[28:26] conduct and then so tonight I wanted to
[28:29] go through the orders and I'll start
[28:31] that tonight and we'll see how far the
[28:33] Lord will bring us through that I felt
[28:36] definitely led to do it when I started
[28:40] it and I didn't know exactly how to
[28:43] approach it but the Lord has just led me
[28:47] um thus far with it I believe it's for
[28:50] our little group of people here that
[28:52] worship here I don't believe we we have
[28:55] our own tape Ministries to go around the
[28:57] world
[28:58] I believe that you're called to a little
[29:00] local Fellowship as as we are here then
[29:03] we're responsible to that amen and I
[29:06] thank God for that amen and so while
[29:09] we're standing we'll take the scriptures
[29:11] and turn into
[29:15] Hebrews chapter
[29:27] 7
[29:29] in verse number
[29:38] four now consider how great this man was
[29:42] unto whom even the patriarch Abraham
[29:45] gave the tenth of the spoils verily they
[29:49] that are of the sons of Levi who receive
[29:52] the office of the priesthood have
[29:54] commandment to take tithes of the people
[29:57] according to to the law that is of their
[30:00] Brethren though they come out of the
[30:02] loins of
[30:03] Abraham but he whose descent is not
[30:06] counted from them received tithes of
[30:09] Abraham and blessed him that had the
[30:11] promises and with all and without all
[30:14] contradiction the less is blessed of the
[30:17] better and here men that die receive
[30:20] tithes but there he receiveth them of
[30:23] whom it is witness that he liveth and as
[30:27] I may so say Levi also who received
[30:31] tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was
[30:35] yet in the loins of his father when MDC
[30:39] met him amen we'll take one more Old
[30:42] Testament scripture Malachi chapter
[30:56] 3
[30:59] verse number
[31:06] seven even from the days of your fathers
[31:09] you have gone away from mine uh
[31:13] ordinances and have not kept them return
[31:16] unto me and I will return unto you
[31:18] sayeth the Lord of hosts but you said
[31:21] wherein shall we return will a man rob
[31:25] God yet ye have robbed me but you say
[31:28] wherein have we robbed thee in tithes
[31:31] and offerings you are cursed with the
[31:34] curse for ye have robbed me even this
[31:37] whole nation bring ye all the tithes
[31:40] into the storehouse that there may be
[31:42] meat in my house and prove me now
[31:45] herewith sayeth the Lord of hosts if I
[31:48] will not open you the windows if I will
[31:52] not open you the windows of heaven and
[31:56] pour you out a blessing that there shall
[31:58] not be room enough to receive it and I
[32:02] will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes
[32:05] and he shall not destroy the fruits of
[32:08] your ground neither shall your Vine cast
[32:11] her fruit before the time in the field
[32:14] saith the Lord of hosts and All Nations
[32:18] shall call you what does it say blessed
[32:22] for ye shall be a delightsome land saith
[32:26] the Lord of host
[32:28] amen we'll ask God's blessings on this
[32:31] portion of his word you may be seated
[32:33] amen so
[32:36] tonight
[32:38] very um solid and uh trivial I'd say
[32:44] Elementary uh portion of the word and
[32:48] that is tithing the pain of tithing and
[32:52] the title of my message tonight will be
[32:55] mezc receive tithe
[32:59] so as we look into this text of
[33:03] scripture there is a group of protestant
[33:07] Christians that don't believe that
[33:09] tithing is for the New Testament Church
[33:13] they believe that was an Old Testament
[33:14] law and that was one of the laws that
[33:18] was done away with in the Old Testament
[33:20] which is not true because Genesis 14 is
[33:24] the first time we hear of tithes being
[33:26] paid and that was Abram before his name
[33:30] was changed now Abram paid ties to MDC
[33:35] before Moses was even on the scene his
[33:38] son Jacob grandson Jacob also in Genesis
[33:42] chapter 28 he paid tithes also before
[33:47] his name was
[33:49] changed and so this was
[33:54] preaw that the uh 10th or or this order
[34:00] of tithing was instituted now for the
[34:05] believer um there's so many quotations
[34:07] for us in the ministry we know what
[34:10] brother vam said about it but it's still
[34:13] a touchy topic that pastors don't want
[34:15] to talk on I think this is my first time
[34:17] to bring a subject on it but don't get
[34:20] mad at me get mad at the
[34:24] quotes well if you're going to get mad
[34:28] get mad at the quotes Okay this should
[34:31] be one of those Revival type
[34:35] sermons and Revival means to kick up all
[34:38] the trash clean up so I I I I'm taking
[34:44] this portion in in the word of God
[34:47] because
[34:49] of the orders part now we took a message
[34:55] last week Wednesday and we read for you
[34:57] or replayed a portion of the tape in in
[35:00] that message I believe it was questions
[35:02] and answers on
[35:06] um
[35:09] um see pardon me law having a shadow
[35:13] questions and answers and brother bandam
[35:16] says this in that message paragraph
[35:18] number seven he says this last evening
[35:20] after the service was over there was a
[35:23] man came to the platform which was a
[35:25] Christian Scientist man been attending
[35:28] the meetings and what a
[35:30] great compliment he passed when he said
[35:33] he never heard that type of teaching he
[35:37] never heard the Bible so well explained
[35:40] and just go to show I walk right out at
[35:43] the church and someone standing out
[35:44] there and said that guy sure is an
[35:46] impostor well of course that someone
[35:49] that backslid from the Tabernacle here
[35:52] and went away with that group not long
[35:55] ago three or four of them pulled away
[35:58] let this church hear this pastor and all
[36:02] regardless if those people who left this
[36:04] church they went out from us because
[36:06] there was wasn't of us said the Bible
[36:08] see that's right and we went to them
[36:10] with brotherly and godly love one after
[36:13] another trying to reconcile them to the
[36:15] church and um they wouldn't listen they
[36:19] taking groups uh and went with them they
[36:23] wouldn't listen then we told it to the
[36:25] church and the Bible says let them be as
[36:27] a heathen Publican that's right they
[36:29] cannot come back in the church without
[36:31] first coming before the church and
[36:34] repenting before the church and then
[36:36] repenting before God and then be brought
[36:39] back and see how they act after that
[36:42] they cannot come back unless the Bible
[36:45] That's Bible teaching we must stay with
[36:50] this Bible and I thought that was a very
[36:53] solid quote brother brandham puts in
[36:56] there he also remember there's a nice
[36:59] hot one on on um birth control all right
[37:03] I mean remember that it's very brother
[37:06] Bon was very clear on that and then uh
[37:09] and so um those are things that are in
[37:13] the word that we look at and you start
[37:17] with that first now there's exceptions
[37:20] to the rules and you have your reason
[37:22] and you have your uh the way you handle
[37:24] your family matters and all that that
[37:27] kind of stuff but you always start with
[37:28] the word first you don't do things
[37:31] because everybody else is doing it and
[37:33] the point of it is you stay with what
[37:36] the word of God has given to us and this
[37:38] message brother random is dealing with
[37:41] the church and he's talking about or the
[37:43] Neville and the pastors and he was
[37:45] talking about the people there how they
[37:49] um how we could have a a more complete
[37:51] Church wouldn't you want that how many
[37:53] remember the tape and and and so he was
[37:57] dealing with the people on that and
[37:58] pointing them into that direction and so
[38:01] he continues in that same message in
[38:03] paragraph number 12 and he says this and
[38:06] before we start the morning Sabbath
[38:08] teaching which I hope not to take too
[38:11] long whatever the Lord will then I want
[38:13] to answer this now remember Church you
[38:18] every one of you know what this church
[38:20] stands for you absolutely understand now
[38:24] we don't have any membership we just
[38:27] have Fellowship see because if we have
[38:30] membership then we bring the people like
[38:33] to an organization which we are strictly
[38:35] inter
[38:36] denominational unorganized only one
[38:39] thing to lead us that's the Holy Spirit
[38:42] and we believe that the Holy Spirit
[38:44] leads through our
[38:47] leaders if God set a holy spirit Holy
[38:51] Spirit set a teacher in the church then
[38:54] if the Holy Spirit wants the church to
[38:56] know something theme he'll speak through
[38:59] the teacher for the Holy Spirit that's
[39:02] what the teacher is ordained to do is
[39:06] that right it's ordained that gift is in
[39:09] the church as a teacher and we should
[39:12] all listen to it until that gift goes
[39:15] proving something that isn't right in
[39:17] the Bible then we have a right to
[39:19] question it as long as it's not you go
[39:23] saying well there's no such a thing as
[39:25] water baptism there's no such a thing as
[39:27] this that or the other or the baptism of
[39:29] the Holy Ghost then question that see
[39:32] but now the Holy Spirit leads now the
[39:35] church believes in the bapt in baptism
[39:38] in water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[39:40] Christ for the remission of sins after
[39:43] repentance it believes in baptism of the
[39:45] holy spirit with the fruits of the
[39:47] spirit following the fruits of the
[39:49] spirit longsuffering gentleness patience
[39:52] goodness meekness we believe in nine
[39:55] spiritual gifts all nine of them wisdom
[39:59] knowledge teachers Apostles prophets
[40:02] Gifts of tongues interpretation of
[40:03] tongues divide healing those things we
[40:07] believe we believe in church
[40:11] government and the government is ordered
[40:13] of the holy spirit in the Bible the
[40:16] pastor is always the head of the church
[40:18] the pastor is always that's God's Elder
[40:22] in organizations you have to come
[40:24] through the bishop there's no higher
[40:26] order in the Bible than the Elder of the
[40:29] church just tell me where it's at
[40:32] there's no higher order in the Bible so
[40:34] brother random says that we believe in
[40:37] church government and that's kind of the
[40:41] direction we'll go on this
[40:44] order now um the Lord sets in the church
[40:48] obviously leaders and taking sides with
[40:51] Jesus brother random calls ministers he
[40:54] calls them captains like in the Old
[40:56] Testament they were captains and they
[40:59] fought in the battle and they fought the
[41:01] War they were out there uh leading the
[41:04] way they had a charge they had um a
[41:09] responsibility there's a qualifications
[41:12] and these things are directly set up
[41:15] when you come into any organized group
[41:18] of people you'll find out real quick uh
[41:22] how they run things what they care about
[41:25] I was just buying Rock just the other
[41:27] day and uh I went into the place to buy
[41:30] some rock and I was really shocked at
[41:33] the the nice atmosphere that they had
[41:36] there this particular location and I
[41:38] bought and rock a number of times for
[41:40] for some stuff I'm doing at home and the
[41:43] other location just rough Grump
[41:47] Grumble um nobody's really happy it's
[41:51] like hurry up tell me what you want you
[41:54] get that that feeling and I noted that
[41:57] you know this really impressed me and so
[41:59] the guy that delivered the rock we was
[42:01] just chatting it up he's been to our
[42:03] house a few times and I ain't seen him
[42:05] in several months and I noted that to
[42:08] him and he and he told me he
[42:10] says uh the reason is that other office
[42:14] over there he knew exactly what I was
[42:15] talking
[42:16] about now nobody didn't do me wrong okay
[42:20] I got my rock I'm just buying Rock okay
[42:23] and nobody did me wrong but there was an
[42:25] atmosphere and an attit ude there and it
[42:28] was very clear that the office that
[42:32] where the people were very pleasant and
[42:35] nice I can guarantee almost guess what
[42:39] their boss would be like cuz that comes
[42:42] from somewhere that's not an
[42:44] accident I mean that's deliberate and
[42:48] it's the same way when you go to a
[42:49] church you go to a church there's
[42:52] Warmness there's people who love you
[42:54] people who care people who will reach
[42:56] out to you you um those are people
[42:59] that's really listening to
[43:02] tapes that's right amen I'm not talking
[43:05] about just playing a tape I'm talking
[43:07] about these are people that actually
[43:09] listen to the tapes that actually read
[43:12] their Bible and internalize what they're
[43:15] listening to and what they're reading
[43:18] all right amen and so you know these you
[43:22] know it it comes from somewhere and the
[43:25] way we our church is is ordered and
[43:28] structured that's because that's the way
[43:30] we are taught from the word of God now
[43:35] this uh
[43:39] message I'll take in the message God's
[43:41] provided way of healing and then I'll
[43:43] get into the little subject here just
[43:44] for a moment paragraph number seven
[43:47] brother ad says in the Old Testament
[43:49] there was three ways that they could get
[43:50] a message that was by a Prophet by a
[43:53] dreamer or by the law now if the prophet
[43:57] prophesied and on the breast of Aaron
[43:59] was the urum of tham if the lights flash
[44:02] on the urum of tham that Prophet was
[44:04] telling the truth but if the lights
[44:07] didn't flash on the urum thund then it
[44:09] was wrong if a dreamer dreamed a dream
[44:11] and told that dream and it didn't flash
[44:13] on the urum thund it was wrong the
[44:16] prophet if he prophesied all the lights
[44:19] didn't flash he was wrong and the urum
[44:22] Thum from the priesthood was taken away
[44:25] but here is the urum of Thum of the
[44:28] priesthood today the word of God if a
[44:32] dreamer or a prophet or a preacher or
[44:34] anything teaches contrary to this Bible
[44:37] it's wrong amen let him be a curse but
[44:40] it must but it must uh be built solidly
[44:45] upon this word thus sayeth the Lord and
[44:48] if this word is correctly set in order
[44:51] and taught by the minister God's
[44:55] solemnly under obligation ation to his
[44:58] son to answer that word and fulfill it I
[45:03] want you to believe that now let me read
[45:05] that again if it's correctly set in
[45:07] order and taught by the minister God's
[45:10] solemnly under obligation to his son to
[45:14] answer that word and fulfill it now
[45:17] that's the way I believe the Bible I
[45:20] believe every word of it now there may
[45:23] be times that I may not be able to set
[45:25] it together I don't believe there any
[45:27] mortal in the world can correctly set
[45:31] every word together but we only can as
[45:35] the Holy Spirit inspires us to do many
[45:39] times it's contrary to our
[45:41] teaching
[45:43] amen all right now the prophet of God
[45:48] said
[45:50] also that in that message questions and
[45:55] answers the law having in the
[45:58] shadow
[46:00] um I didn't pick it up here but if you
[46:03] can go back there sis to that one in
[46:05] paragraph number 17 I want to read
[46:07] something out of there he talked about
[46:09] you know he's getting he's kind of
[46:11] talking to his home Church
[46:14] there yeah go up just a little bit let
[46:17] me see what that was up there all right
[46:21] now in the order to the church we just
[46:23] trust that God will keep you perfect and
[46:25] your heart stayed upon him him and
[46:28] remember friend this glorious church
[46:30] that we've been talking about in this
[46:31] last week why can't we have that here on
[46:35] eth and Pin Street we got the
[46:38] qualifications we got the people who
[46:40] love God don't you believe that we got
[46:43] people in here I see stranger strangers
[46:46] in here that come in since brother
[46:48] Neville has been Pastor here fine people
[46:51] I meet them here at the altar people
[46:53] from Louisville people from Henryville
[46:55] new Aly and around
[46:57] people that I don't even know I've never
[46:59] seen them in my life wonderful people
[47:02] now wouldn't you all like to have a real
[47:04] Bible Church a real Bible Church where
[47:07] all the spiritual gifts were set in
[47:10] order yes everything making manifest
[47:13] just exactly the way it should be
[47:15] wouldn't that be wonderful now you're
[47:18] going to have to
[47:20] sacrifice not money okay you're going to
[47:23] have to sacrifice what some of your own
[47:26] IDE
[47:27] is you're going to have to sacrifice
[47:30] some time in prayer you're going to have
[47:32] to sacrifice maybe a stubborn
[47:36] will to break down in humility see
[47:39] you're going to have the whole Christian
[47:41] move is sacrificial he that will follow
[47:45] me let him deny himself take up his
[47:48] cross and follow me daily is that right
[47:51] how often do you have to
[47:55] sacrifice every day
[47:57] Paul said he died daily every day he
[48:02] died so the Christian Life is sacrifice
[48:06] it's
[48:08] giving it is actually an offering you
[48:14] offering
[48:15] yourself and the greatest offering that
[48:18] was ever offered the greatest gift that
[48:21] was ever given was displayed right here
[48:24] at Calvary yes sir that was an offering
[48:28] you'll never be able to beat that gift
[48:31] you can't beat god-given he he
[48:34] gave the best that he could give he gave
[48:39] himself for you and I what an offering
[48:43] what an offering our praise and our
[48:46] worship is just a little touch of what
[48:50] he gave we give the fruits of our lips
[48:53] in Praise it's offering it's worship
[48:56] ship that's what it is that's what the
[48:59] song service is all about it's not about
[49:01] singing in the right key and who's
[49:03] singing who's clapping who's not it's
[49:06] not about that it's about you giving God
[49:09] an offering from your lips giving praise
[49:14] to his name
[49:16] amen that was a great offering right
[49:19] there and so brother Ram tells us that
[49:22] our worship and offering that tithings
[49:26] is a part of our
[49:29] worship um many times we look at it like
[49:32] okay you're a Christian all right you
[49:34] got baptized you come to church you're
[49:36] Christian now you got a job you got to
[49:39] give a dime out of a dollar and I was
[49:41] just like you know that equation my mom
[49:44] would drill it in our head 10% you got
[49:47] to give that and it's an order yes it's
[49:50] a duty yes but really it's a worship
[49:55] that's right it's a worship amen what we
[49:59] give is a worship back to God and so
[50:03] brother bam deals with this sacrifice we
[50:07] start by giving in our life in the
[50:10] message
[50:12] um the adoption
[50:15] 1960 paragraph number 144 just right
[50:19] above 144 he says God has given to her
[50:22] she's a member of the body of Christ yes
[50:24] sir I believe that I seen that done and
[50:27] I know that's true but it is is get the
[50:31] church in order set in order so we can
[50:35] work brother man's talking about setting
[50:37] the church in order God hiding himself
[50:40] in Simplicity and revealing himself in
[50:42] the same the prophet of God says this
[50:45] here paragraph 45 and
[50:50] so now he's dedicating he's rededicating
[50:54] the church and look at what he says
[50:55] here's the morning when I dedicated and
[50:57] laid the Cornerstone there as a young
[51:00] man I prayed for its standing to see the
[51:03] coming of Jesus
[51:05] Christ and when I did owing thousands of
[51:07] dollars you can take up an offering in a
[51:09] congregation this size and get 30 or 40
[51:12] cents but I wanted to to bring that
[51:14] quote that you know like you know a
[51:16] church
[51:18] starting isn't a halfhazard thing if
[51:21] it's God that started the work and I
[51:24] believe that church that work should
[51:27] last until Jesus comes I want you to
[51:30] think about that for a moment if God's
[51:33] going to start a group or a church or
[51:36] get a a a a work his work preaching the
[51:41] Good News of the gospel and call and
[51:43] elect someone out of the qualifications
[51:46] of the fivefold ministry that's not
[51:48] something that starts today and then we
[51:50] quit and then I feel like starting again
[51:53] and then you know maybe not or maybe so
[51:55] that's too undeliberately
[51:56] God is very deliberate and here in
[51:59] brother bam dedicated the Tabernacle
[52:01] 1933 he prayed that it would last and
[52:05] stand until the coming of the Lord and
[52:08] it's still standing today isn't that
[52:11] nice so look at the longevity of it look
[52:13] at the long range vision of it as he
[52:17] brings it and so brother brandom goes
[52:21] forward and tells us that an altar is a
[52:25] church he says this and glorified Jesus
[52:28] he says Cain was an Infidel Cain Cain
[52:32] wasn't an Infidel Cain was a Believer
[52:34] Cain didn't come saying now I don't
[52:36] believe there is such a thing as God
[52:39] Cain come as a Believer he was trying to
[52:42] find Grace with God and Cain built an
[52:45] altar an altar is a church a place of
[52:50] worship then Cain built an altar and not
[52:53] only that but Cain brought an offering
[52:55] and made a sacrif ice and not only that
[52:58] brother manam continues on he says it
[53:00] again and I will restore
[53:02] 1955 paragraph number 16 he says now
[53:05] Cain and Abel both come to Worship the
[53:09] Lord Cain built a church he built an
[53:12] altar an altar is a place of worship and
[53:16] Cain brought a sacrifice and Cain
[53:19] believed God and Cain worshiped God so
[53:22] we see that an altar is a church and so
[53:25] we come to the church that's where we
[53:29] come to give our sacrifice the great
[53:32] sacrifice is ourself and we give the
[53:35] fruits of our lips giving praise we give
[53:37] our life and this is a very very
[53:41] deliberate we build a church you're
[53:44] building an altar an altar to the only
[53:48] true God
[53:50] Amen and so we see this that in the
[53:54] order of things you have to have have
[53:57] these leaders that God calls to be a
[54:00] part in this church we'll call them
[54:03] Gatekeepers we'll call them you know the
[54:06] authorities we'll call them First
[54:08] Responders or the Watchmen or the five
[54:11] ministering gifts you got to have
[54:14] somebody who has that Watchmen and
[54:17] groups of men that has this calling in
[54:19] their life to hold this word above
[54:22] anything else in the military there's
[54:25] ranks and there's orders to them and
[54:28] they they they have to know how to fight
[54:31] they have to know their weapon they have
[54:32] to know a strategy they have to know how
[54:35] to give orders and to take orders and
[54:38] that's just a military and you know and
[54:42] and God is constructing his church he
[54:44] has placed in the church these checks
[54:48] and balances and people that are
[54:52] Gatekeepers and watching uh uh over the
[54:55] direction of the church direction of
[54:58] people we don't come here with our
[55:00] blinders on not worried about other
[55:03] people that's not a true leader you
[55:06] don't come here thinking about just
[55:09] yourself Christianity is living for
[55:12] others I guarantee you when uh it's your
[55:16] last day here if you have time to take
[55:19] inventory of your life you're not going
[55:21] to be wishing you had more time to to
[55:25] run up and down in the malls or to do
[55:27] your you know to your your little things
[55:29] that you like to have fun about you're
[55:31] going to think about how did you help
[55:34] other people amen how did you contribute
[55:38] did you change somebody's life these are
[55:41] the important things did you leave a
[55:44] legacy for somebody to pick up did you
[55:47] start something that was actually
[55:50] beautiful that's blossoming and fruiting
[55:53] that outlives you that's that's that's
[55:56] what's the important thing so one of the
[55:59] quotes I got here I called a a precious
[56:02] brother he he he's he's got a death wish
[56:06] a death uh uh thing on him with this
[56:08] cancer and um brother Glenn tomson
[56:12] called him just the other day and I was
[56:14] already preparing this and I just
[56:15] greeted him was talking to him and he
[56:18] said brother Israel he said uh you know
[56:21] his life that he lived he served the
[56:23] Lord and he said that there was a quote
[56:25] he came AC cross and this really struck
[56:29] him was how brother brandom says that
[56:32] you can rob
[56:35] god with your
[56:38] time and I started to think about that
[56:40] CU you know we we try to put God on a
[56:43] Time budget and work God into our
[56:47] schedule when actually you wouldn't even
[56:49] be here or have any breath or life if
[56:53] God didn't give it to you amen and so if
[56:55] God gave gave you breath in life whose
[56:58] interest should you be concerned about
[57:01] first who should be first in your life
[57:04] when it comes to time not your career
[57:07] not what's com coming in your bank
[57:09] account not your friends or popularity
[57:11] it's him it's God first and that's what
[57:14] Jesus did he was about his father's
[57:18] business not Costco's business or uh uh
[57:22] what's that uh the the the thing that
[57:25] they sell things Amazon's business and
[57:28] everybody else's he was about the
[57:30] father's business and we can actually
[57:33] Rob god with our time I'll get to the
[57:36] quote here in just a minute if the Lord
[57:37] will help
[57:38] me but these thoughts came to him at
[57:42] this time in his life as he's numbering
[57:45] talking about brother Glenn as he's
[57:47] numbering his days he's calling for God
[57:49] to heal him he's asking God for more
[57:52] time but the real important thing is
[57:56] Lord the time that I have I want that to
[57:59] be the best quality time with you you
[58:03] see all the other carnal things that
[58:05] everybody are fighting about and suing
[58:07] people about and getting upset about and
[58:09] all that kind of stuff they can have it
[58:11] but for a Believer we've been called to
[58:14] something
[58:15] greater something so much greater this
[58:19] is why we're here
[58:21] tonight on a Wednesday night going to
[58:24] church you got the little bit Bitties
[58:26] getting them ready for church you got
[58:28] the little kid you got school tomorrow
[58:30] why y'all going to church what's going
[58:32] on with that don't you need some sleep
[58:35] don't you need to raise a you know a
[58:37] responsible parent to make sure the kids
[58:39] got plenty of sleep but we've been
[58:41] called to something greater than just
[58:43] getting plenty of sleep I want my kids
[58:46] to receive the Holy Ghost that's the
[58:50] most important thing most important
[58:54] Legacy it's the somebody get saved
[58:58] filled with the Holy
[59:00] Ghost
[59:01] yes
[59:03] yes and so this is an altar and we come
[59:08] and we bring to this altar I'll just
[59:10] read some quotes here brother bam talks
[59:12] about on tithes per
[59:15] and he says this here and let's see God
[59:20] 1959 paragraph 28 but you know I feel
[59:23] like this that a member of a church
[59:26] Church their first obligation is with
[59:29] their tithe and offering is to support
[59:31] their church if you are members of These
[59:34] Fine churches that's represented here
[59:37] you support your church that's your
[59:39] first duty to God bring your tith and
[59:42] offering into the storehouse and the
[59:44] storehouse you surely know what that is
[59:47] is where you get your food yeah so there
[59:50] is where you get your spiritual food and
[59:53] your obligation is to your church and
[59:55] not not to an evangelist like
[59:59] me question number 146 in God being
[1:00:05] misunderstood it's paragraph
[1:00:08] 111 brother brandham don't you feel that
[1:00:11] everyone who claims to be a Christian
[1:00:12] should pay tithes pay their tithes into
[1:00:15] the storehouse of the Lord please give
[1:00:18] scripture to this question all right if
[1:00:20] you will that is right the Bible said in
[1:00:23] Malachi the 4th chapter will a man Rob
[1:00:26] God and you say where have you robbed
[1:00:30] thee in tithe and offerings bring all
[1:00:32] the tithe and offerings into my
[1:00:34] Storehouse and prove me sayeth the Lord
[1:00:38] if I will not open up the windows of
[1:00:40] heaven and pour out a blessing that
[1:00:43] there will not be room enough to
[1:00:45] receive that's a challenge to any
[1:00:49] individual and if I only had time I
[1:00:52] would not get to this little scripture
[1:00:54] that I wish to about the next 10 minutes
[1:00:57] I would give you a personal testimony
[1:00:59] how that even hungry and my mother and
[1:01:02] them hungry and my daddy sick but I took
[1:01:05] my ties out first and give it to God you
[1:01:08] ought to see what happened I have never
[1:01:11] seen in my life that any man or woman
[1:01:14] that if you only make $1 a week will
[1:01:17] bring that 10 cents of that money and
[1:01:19] put it into the storehouse of of a
[1:01:22] church where you come if God don't bless
[1:01:25] that call call me a hypocrite yes sir
[1:01:28] that's a challenge to anybody and every
[1:01:31] Christian that goes to this other
[1:01:33] question every Christian should pay
[1:01:35] tithes that's right it should be done
[1:01:38] all right the redeem have this praise in
[1:01:43] their heart and their lips they have a
[1:01:44] praise that the Angels don't have they
[1:01:47] have the praise that the nothing else in
[1:01:49] creation has a praise like God that's
[1:01:52] right can't nobody worship like a
[1:01:55] redeemer son and daughter of God and
[1:01:58] when we get over there we will praise
[1:02:01] and worship and the angels will stop
[1:02:04] back and listen to us because they don't
[1:02:07] know what we talking about they don't
[1:02:09] know what it was to be lost but now
[1:02:10] you're found sick but now healed lost
[1:02:14] but now you've been forgiven and when we
[1:02:17] praise him the Angels brother B says
[1:02:20] they'll line the curvature of the earth
[1:02:23] and sit back and listen to us
[1:02:26] the redeemed of the Lord praise the name
[1:02:30] of the Lord amen CU he gives us that
[1:02:34] bless his wonderful name Hallelujah now
[1:02:37] brother
[1:02:37] vam he says
[1:02:40] that he he makes this statement and I
[1:02:43] thought this is really nice good to see
[1:02:44] brother Nathaniel back
[1:02:47] there he says this about the
[1:02:51] elected this is very sweet it's very
[1:02:54] nice images of Christ 195 59 paragraph
[1:02:57] 156 he says this oh lord it's in his
[1:02:59] prayer oh Lord your God and your God
[1:03:04] forever more oh my and we're so happy to
[1:03:07] know that you promised that you would
[1:03:10] have a Remnant when you come to the
[1:03:12] Earth regardless of what goes or comes
[1:03:16] there's going to be a people that's
[1:03:18] going to be ready we know that there is
[1:03:22] a Tiding that men gives to God and there
[1:03:25] is a tithing amongst the people perhaps
[1:03:29] maybe we would say a tenth of all the
[1:03:33] world's Harvest Through the Ages will be
[1:03:37] that elected that's been
[1:03:39] called so not only do we give a tithe we
[1:03:43] actually are the
[1:03:45] tithe we are part of the elected that is
[1:03:49] on the earth I love how the prophet
[1:03:51] brings that that of the elected this is
[1:03:55] the part that belongs to God we're the
[1:03:59] dime out of a doar to
[1:04:01] God that's the elected amen these are
[1:04:05] the elected ones throughout all of the
[1:04:08] world's history the redeemed out of the
[1:04:10] ages a large saved group but amongst
[1:04:13] that saved group there's an elected
[1:04:17] attent like
[1:04:18] Levi Levi was a type of the Bride
[1:04:22] they're selected they're that that
[1:04:24] elected por in the 10th part I thought
[1:04:27] that was really nice to think of
[1:04:30] yourself as a tithe to the Lord that's
[1:04:34] been elected to him the tithing is the
[1:04:37] Lord's not ours in the first
[1:04:40] place now brother random deals with this
[1:04:43] in the queen God hiding himself in
[1:04:45] Simplicity I got two quotes I read here
[1:04:48] paragraph 65 so that is inspired and
[1:04:51] directly hung in its right place and I'm
[1:04:54] so thankful to be the one on the right
[1:04:56] side I trust that he has forgiven me for
[1:05:00] I as far as literally stealing anything
[1:05:04] as I know I never did in my life but
[1:05:07] I've so misused his time till I stole
[1:05:10] that way and I've done many things that
[1:05:13] I shouldn't do and I'm grateful to God
[1:05:15] this morning that he has forgiven my
[1:05:19] sins have you ever thought about
[1:05:21] stealing God's
[1:05:23] time you thought about that amen I want
[1:05:27] you to internalize what would that look
[1:05:29] like you still in God's
[1:05:33] time what would that look like to
[1:05:35] you what would that mean to
[1:05:38] you you're guilty of stealing God's time
[1:05:41] what does that mean I mean you're just
[1:05:43] here existing you got to go to work got
[1:05:45] to go to school got to go do this and do
[1:05:47] this so you still in God's time how
[1:05:50] would you be still in God's
[1:05:54] time is it possible of course it's
[1:05:57] possible brother says I never really
[1:05:59] stole nothing in my life except you know
[1:06:01] he stole some of God's
[1:06:06] time so I think that's you know on as I
[1:06:11] say as our life goes through an
[1:06:13] inventory you have those near ending
[1:06:16] time near death experience or those
[1:06:19] serious moments of your life you really
[1:06:21] break down all of the things that most
[1:06:23] of the world calls important and these
[1:06:26] things right here is what's important
[1:06:29] brother bam continues on in the queen of
[1:06:32] Shiva paragraph 180 said that little
[1:06:34] Queen wanted it but the first thing she
[1:06:37] wanted to know was it scriptural or not
[1:06:40] she studied all the scriptures then she
[1:06:42] said I'm going to do another thing I'm a
[1:06:44] queen and if that message is right I'm
[1:06:46] going to support it yeah and she laid in
[1:06:49] camels with gold mirror frankincense and
[1:06:52] all kind of COS of Pearl and such she
[1:06:55] said if it's right if that God is real
[1:06:59] God then I'm I'm through with this thing
[1:07:03] I've been serving I'm going to support
[1:07:05] it with everything I got that's the
[1:07:08] attitude listen God is not concerned so
[1:07:11] much about your money but he wants you
[1:07:14] to support him with all you are he don't
[1:07:18] want 10% of your money so much as he
[1:07:21] wants your time your talent your test
[1:07:25] testimony and all that you are to be
[1:07:28] given into his hands so he can control
[1:07:31] you he wants to be your lord not only
[1:07:35] your savior but your lord lordship to
[1:07:39] govern you and so brother man continues
[1:07:42] on how many thank the Lord for that amen
[1:07:47] so God is wanting our time so tonight
[1:07:53] we'll have a we'll have a uh our brother
[1:07:55] George is going to the mission field
[1:07:57] there here in Jamaica we mentioned it
[1:08:00] Sunday that we'll be taking missionary
[1:08:02] offering to add to that little group
[1:08:05] there and I know some of you may be
[1:08:07] prepared or not prepared for to give but
[1:08:09] we'll give you the opportunity to do
[1:08:12] that tonight and if you have um
[1:08:16] something you want to give and you can
[1:08:18] put it on the note or
[1:08:21] in the offering deal there as a note and
[1:08:24] then
[1:08:25] take that from the fund put that in the
[1:08:28] offering and you can just bring it on
[1:08:31] Sunday the Lord willing right and so he
[1:08:35] says here in in giving like that to
[1:08:39] missionary
[1:08:40] work it's a quote I've always love and
[1:08:43] many of the brothers have quoted it over
[1:08:45] the years and I really like it he says
[1:08:48] paragraph 47 in the message end time
[1:08:50] evangelism he says that's the reason I
[1:08:52] chose today this subject for my last
[1:09:55] appreciate your fine love offering which
[1:09:57] will be given me after the service I
[1:10:00] will promise you there won't be any
[1:10:02] cigarettes any whiskey anything wrong
[1:10:06] it'll go for preaching the gospel in
[1:10:08] Australia and wherever the Lord will
[1:10:10] send me and a soldier born in the
[1:10:14] Kingdom there it'll be your credit that
[1:10:17] the day that I'm only following the
[1:10:20] leading of the spirit I must do that and
[1:10:24] you're sending me money your tithing is
[1:10:27] sending me brother banon says it'll be
[1:10:30] your credit we can all go but we can get
[1:10:34] credit for those who do go when we
[1:10:37] support them with our prayers with our
[1:10:41] little you know gifts that God has given
[1:10:43] to us amen God bless each of
[1:10:47] you
[1:10:49] tonight pray the Lord Jesus
[1:10:51] will bless you in your worship
[1:10:56] as mzd receives TI he still receives TI
[1:11:00] he does that today and you'll never be
[1:11:03] able to out out give God you start by
[1:11:07] giving your
[1:11:08] time God will increase your
[1:11:11] time you start by planting the seed that
[1:11:15] seed would outlive and it just produces
[1:11:17] more fruit to where you can't you mean a
[1:11:20] tree produces so much fruit you can't
[1:11:22] eat it all you got to share with others
[1:11:25] that's how the Lord God says give Jesus
[1:11:29] said give and it shall be given unto you
[1:11:32] good measure press down shaking and
[1:11:36] running over so men give into your goods
[1:11:39] that's what Jesus said how many know
[1:11:41] that that's the cycle of it when God
[1:11:44] gives to you you give back to him and
[1:11:47] when he gives you more you get more
[1:11:49] humble and He blesses you more he get
[1:11:51] more humble He blesses you more and then
[1:11:54] oh my
[1:11:55] thank the Lord for his goodness to us
[1:11:57] and what he give to us God bless you so
