that we can take a stand for you we ask you to bless us now and bless every heart that's gathered here Lord we may you rebuke every evil spirit on every hand Lord and move forward in your word now and bless your people we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless each of you uh tonight and we certainly enjoyed that play wasn't that nice praise the Lord Give the Lord hand of Praise amen it's a lot of hard work I can see that very very nice I read the script before I think a week or so and I just couldn't stop laughing as I was reading it and just really tickled me and then to see it go forward like that we certainly thank the Lord for our Sunday School School teachers and our parents Lord with the inspiration let's go right into the word of the Lord tonight we'll move quickly to go forward from where we were this morning St Luke chapter 22 we know we're in the battle zone is that right it's war on every hand and not everybody can make it through but the elect they'll be standing in that day brother Chuck the True Believer will always shine he'll come forward because of the word of God Amen St Luke chapter 22 first off did you enjoy the word of the Lord this morning sir amen it's so good to us Luke chapter 22 verse number 23 and they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing and there was also a Strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactor factors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is Chief as he that doth serve for whether is greater he that sth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sth at meat but I am among you as he that serveth amen verse 31 let's drop down there and the Lord said Simon Simon behold um let me see here yeah Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I pray for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brother amen what a a beautiful portion of scriptures our lord Jesus is leaving off the scene here and now the disciples started to inquire within themselves and actually started to dispute amongst themselves who is greatest who's in charge who's next and this argument rose up among them not just once this was kind of an ongoing issue that they had and Jesus had to put it in his place didn't he so the Lord bless you may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Ephesians chapter 6 is where we were taking our scriptures from Luke chapter 4 also we read the discourse that Satan had with our lord Jesus and then brother random takes the message Harvest Time and shows us the three tactics or the three temptations that Satan attacked Jesus ministers the church the organization and individuals amen and did you learn something this morning you know that's what the word of the Lord is for is to equip Us in the evil day the battle that you're raging against is not me it's not you but Satan is after every one of us and he's trying to get us off of the main path that God has called for us so simply put the scripture gives us the whole armor of God that we should put on the whole armor of God so that you would be able to stand in the evil day and brother Bandon brings it out that Satan has a A Punch coming to every one of us I don't care who you are and I asked the question it's a real question have you received your punch yet or are you being hit now or is that something in the future we everyone have our besetting sins the weaknesses of our flesh as Believers and brother random tells us that those areas we need to keep them covered in prayer is that right we got to keep those spots covered in prayer the minister and his wife came to him because they were nervous and brother bandam says that you got to keep th that area covered in prayer that everybody has a hit coming a blow an open shot that the way brother Randon put it he legally has a right to do it and um so we want to be prepared for that shot amen so here's what brother bam says in that message Christ is revealed in his own word and he says you read last month reader digest you'll notice the subject there it's on Billy Graham the great evangelist he got so tired he just couldn't hold his meetings he went to Mayo's clinic for a physical checkup there wasn't nothing wrong with him only just didn't doesn't do enough work and they put him to running physical exercise he runs a mile every day and then the article goes on to say that science has proved that today that the young children these little boys and girls hit their middle age at 20 years old and by 25 many times in many cases girls are out of menopause at 25 years old I don't know if you knew it or not but a few nights ago while the Holy Spirit speaking here in the meeting a little girl sitting down here that's exactly what was wrong with that child when it called out I looked at her the second time I looked again and seeing what was the matter I thought it can't be that child is too young but it was menopause about 20 years old 23 something like that see my mother your mother struck that age about 45 to 50 my wife struck that age about 35 now it's down to 20 the whole human race is rotten well if them physical beings of our body is tearing down like that from eating hybrid Foods tensions that rotten it does not that also rot the brain cell then when we can see how women can get on the street naked we can see how they can speed through the streets 120 miles an hour all these things it comes to a place where the whole nation the whole world not only this nation but everywhere mentally gone and then when we open up those the Lord willing on those seven vows and show those hideous things men will be so insane after a while till they'll imagine their seeing ants the size of a mountain it'll be tormenting women be locust come upon the Earth with long hair to torment women who cut theirs off hairlike women hanging down long teeth like a lion Stingers in their tail like a scorpion and so forth to torment men upon the Earth but then it'll be too late to do anything about it you get it right now you get right now tormenting so brother random is obviously referring to the scriptures in the Book of Revelation the seven last plagues I'm going to give you a reference and you can go read that when you get home it's in your Bible you don't have to understand it all but you should be aware you should become familiar wise with what your word says it's in Revelation 17 verse1 also found in Revelations 21 these seven last plagues the seven vows but he also speaking of the Locust with hair like women and there were horses actually Locust like horses that hair like women faces like men that's found in Revelations chapter 9 for those of you who want that reference and that's just a prefigure of the Demonic forces that have been poured out and opened up this is why the movie industry is so popular it's supercharged it's Anointed with media and the uh entertainment industry is tremendous because Satan has Unleashed himself and so we Believers are not we're not um ignorant of his devices because what because of the third poll because of the revelation of the Seven Seals because of the opening of the word Luke 17:30 it's called the message it's on tape you read it you hear it there is a preparation taking place every time you read it every time you hear it so let's go back a little bit into this conversation that Satan digs up with job it is in Job chapter 1 quickly maybe I'll just quote it I won't read it I I'll read it a little bit in verse number six there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that fearth God and and asseth evil then Satan answered the Lord and said th job fear God for not for nothing Hast not Thou made a hedge about him about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land hand but put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face so we see that Satan here has boundaries we see that Satan can't just go and move in on job he first had to consider him have you considered my servant job he's walking up and down the Earth to and fro he's not walking for the exercise either he's not walking just to see the Earth he's the great tempter he lost his position in heaven brother brandom says in marriage and divorce that he was co-equal with God had all the power that God had except he could not create he was the most beautiful thing that was ever created talented in music the stones that made him up the settings in Gold the topaz and the beauty that he had and his ability to even get a portion of angels to turn their back on the great Jehovah God the almighty God we'd say so his ability as we heard this morning to deceive he's not something to play with or to toy with you don't halfway fight him he's not in it to hurt you he's in it to destroy you if you can but he can't do it if God has got a hedge about you and this is my prayer for my life for my wife for my children for my Ministry for my Christian Journey Lord put a hedge about me on every side like all the way around every spot covered by the blood of him and only him that was worthy for praise hey satan can't get you when God's got you covered there is no security system or insurance plan like what I'm talking about right now the good Lord Is Watching Over Us all day all night we're sleeping at night watching us not thinking about it watching in our ignorance watching us and Satan was watching job and he saw that on every side he couldn't get in on this man he couldn't touch his Ministry couldn't touch him nowhere Satan telling God on every side you got to hedge about him there's a wall of protection around this man that's why he fears you that's why he's blessed oh my but God um takes the challenge and he allows Satan to move against him so we see this wall of protection now it's a beautiful thing to know that first of all we are on The Winning Side how many knows that we already won brother Tim it's a it's a game that's already been played it's like watching who won the Super Bowl last year we already know see we already won the victory is already won one I'm not praying to overcome we have already overcome because the lamb was slain not my righteousness not my goodness the lamb was slain and his blood covered me covers you and I so he gives us the grace and the power to overcome all evils let's look at another portion of scripture here in St Luke chapter 10 Jesus now sending 70 and remember these 70 are not going to stay with him but he's sending them and show you how the power of God works and how and we can't get into every aspect of it how Satan and his demons and Devils how they work and how there's a great battle that we are fighting and Satan don't like you and he don't like God and when you made a decision to serve him he put a bullseye on your back my sister my brother he's got a bull's eye on you and in Luke chapter 10 it says in the s0 return again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as Lightning falling from Heaven this is our Lord talking to his disciples to the 70 behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over over all the power of the enemy and nothing by any means hurt you nothing shall by any means hurt you amen there's nothing by any means can hurt you when you know this what are you worried about then when this reality strikes that you're on the winning side and that the lord gave you power to overcome nothing shall by any means hurt you not even the biggest baddest devil not 10 of them not 20 of them not 200,000 of them because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world nothing can hurt us nothing can harm us if he could stop us he would have stopped us but he can't Oh Glory sir not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven I wonder if we knew our names are written in heaven I wonder if that would help the song leader when it's time to praise and worship H I wonder if I got to pump that up I wonder if I got to push you and pull you through the song service drag you through the goodness of the Lord jump you grab you and physically give you a dance but I wonder if you knew your name was written in heaven before the foundation of the I wonder if that can even get a praise the Lord thank you Jesus yes I love you Lord don't Rejoice because the subject the devils are subject to you but Rejoice because because your names are written in heaven then in Luke 22 as we read Simon the Lord tells him the Lord tells uh Peter Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not okay so he's not going to just take the Temptation away he's not going to just take the battle away he's going to pray that your faith don't fail I pray for you that your faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brothers Acts chapter 26 can I move forward just a little bit this is the Apostle Paul coming to his conversion seeing that he's going to be a secret weapon in the kingdom of God he saw now chasing folks but we don't know what he looks like when he's turned to Paul but finally the Lord catches up to him knocks him off his horse and begins to reveal to him his purpose in life his purpose in the ministry and the scripture says in verse 16 but arise stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou has seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me you see the purpose that Paul was called he was called to go to the Gentiles so he had to be saved first his eyes the scales come off of his eyes but I called you for this purpose to go to the Gentiles that you might deliver them from the power of darkness and from the power of Satan unto God Amen What a Mighty Ministry did he do it yes he did he went into those little alleys and those dark places he was locked up in prison for it he went into places that others wouldn't go he went in those places knowing that God spoke to him he went in there deliberately turning Darkness to light grabbing hold of people that are bound with Satan and literally breaking them out of the darkness of Satan and bringing him over into The Marvelous Light is that what the gospel did to you is that what the message did to you it got you where you were and where you were and delivered you he said I can't do this I'm Bound by this I looked on this I did this my whole life the message just broke that all up and delivered you into His Marvelous Light amen yes so we see this is this great purpose that was in Paul now this Satan desires to have you but he can't have you so he's going to make it hard on you so when it's time to pray how many's ever been sleepy when it's time to pray you forgot you made a commitment but you forgot remember that I'm going to read through the Bible in the year this year forgot ran out of time whatever it was you know Satan's after you he's out to get you he know you ain't going to go out here and worship him or go out there but he's going to make it very difficult and hard for you but I have prayed for you Satan desires to sift you as wheat but I have prayed for you Satan desired to take you out but I got a head about you Joe he can't touch you nothing by any means shall harm you amen I'm talking about the gospel Saints I'm not talking about our Good Deeds I'm not talking about our ability but it is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ here what brother brandham says in this message speak to the Rock if I can take 10 more minutes now I want you to notice another thing before they went out calling out now the children of Israel was given a sign they went out and began to preach to them and we know the story and when Moses preached to them this is the message speak to this rock paragraph 28 God met him and he didn't want to go but he give him a sign to do a healing healing was one of the signs next was to perform a miracle with the stick and when that was done they believed Moses and started on the March all right they didn't go very far until they got into some trouble every time when you start to make a March for God look out you're headed for trouble huh you're headed for trouble the devil's going to lay right along the path there to get every foot in he can get in he will trip you upset you do everything mean he's a devil oh I just love to pour the scripture on him don't you yes sir say it's written the word of the Lord that's right God said so the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he's my enemy but as long as God's my friend I don't have no fear of him I just drive him right on back take the word of God and move right on back out of his out of the place that he thinks he's are holding he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just a devil and a password that's all he hasn't got no legal right to any man that that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped yes sir he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in disappointments he's whipped in everything he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is is a big old Shadow you know he has no legal right he has no power over you did you know that that's the word of the Lord he's a bluff he's a shadow he's a bunch of hot air but if you have taken a promise of God he has no legal right over you amen so we thank the Lord for that he would love to have you but he can't so Satan has tried this tactics many times we see him moving up to gain position and power let me ask you this what does Satan really want from you what does he really want from you brother will brother George sister Sharon what is what do you have that he really wants he wants something do you know what that is or we just pity Patty and just you know putting out fires as they come or do you know that there's actually a strategy against your life that it's bigger than tomorrow's washing or tomorrow's work that you have in your blueprint or your plans for the job or your vehicle whatever you got going on you know Satan has a plan against you to come after you brother Trevor yes he does and and he wants something from you he wanted it from Jesus remember he told Jesus I'll give this power to you I have the power to give it I'll give it to you if you just Bow Down and Worship me I don't care how holy the man is how anointed the group is how beautiful the talent is there's only one being that deserves our praise and our worship and that's the Lord Jesus Christ don't get it twisted there is nobody that we bow down in prayer it's the only one and that's him he's the only one that can say without me you can do nothing I built I created heavens and and Earth alone by myself besides me there is no other if you miss me you missed everything he's the only one that if I said that that would be Pride if you say that You' be off your knock but he says it it is true he's the only one that deserves our praise and wor but Satan wants us to worship Hollywood Stars basketball teams you are wildc cap for Life whatever it is Chicago Bears whatever it is Fanboy got the bumper sticker tattoos whatever it is there's only one fan we're we're the fan of the Lord Jesus that's the only horn I'm tooting it puts my faith in no man I'll put faith in myself put your faith in this man put your faith in this group that'll leave you bankrupt every time but he won't he won't he wants your worship he wants your time he wants your attention he wants you to say things that are not in the word and this is where he tried to get Joel to curse God in his face so what did the Lord do the Lord turned him loose didn't he go get him and look at what he did when he hit job can we take it just for a moment first thing he did he caused the sians to come and steal his Ox s and all his donkeys and then killed the servants second thing he did was he sent a fire they said a fire from God came down and burned up the sheep and all the sheph Shepherds and servants then he turns loose with the child Deans that came and stole his animals his camel and killed all his servants then a great wind from the Wilderness blew his son's house down that just so happened to have all of his children in that home it looks like it was a mistake it looks like it was an accident it was actually an agreement between God God said go get them you can get them and Satan said I'll get him to curse you and God said no you won't you can't do it he says well go get him just don't touch his life and he goes after him and he turns all of these you know natural disasters a great wind a fire The Neighbors come and start coming against him and then finally he strikes job himself with boils from the top of his head to the SES of his feet you know God is the healer is that right any sickness and disease comes from Satan all of it but God allows them sometimes is that right how many of you have ever known a Believer True Believer that had to bury a child huh pretty painful wouldn't you say what about more than one child what about all all of the children who was behind that yes Satan was behind it but who allowed it for all these years we were blessed and he anointed us and gave us wisdom and caused us to grow and caused us to prosper and then over one season Satan comes and takes all of my wealth all of my camels all of my family is gone in one season but what job say he said what a True Believer will say he said blessed be the name he didn't do like some of us some of us can't take what job went through we read about them but think about it if it was you would you still make it to service would you still have a helping hand to the Brethren would you maintain your integrity in the face of the challenge when these evils have happened to you you got to know where it's coming from brother sister stop weeping stop crying about it gge yourself with the knowledge of where it's coming from but somebody allowed it and the one that allowed it got you in his hands and he's watching you through the test through the trial through the situation yes sir heyen somebody allowed it Satan was responsible but God allowed it think about that then finally his health strikes him bottom of the SES of his feet the crown of his head he grabs an old piece of pottery 10 more minutes okay a piece of pottery and begins to scratch his boils laying on an ass sheep wondering what's going on can't get a prayer through no church members encouraging him he's got he's bewildered he don't know what's going on he doesn't he can't process what's going on you push him for an answer he'll got an answer and then his wife his lovely wife comes to him and she didn't bring a quotation from the word she didn't bring remember how good God has been to us she didn't didn't bring the strength that she should have brought to him what she bring to him exactly what Satan wanted him to say why don't you curse God was that a coincidence that she came up with that somebody told her why don't you curse God and die wow my what say somebody preaching from experience he ain't joking my We Won't Let You Preach in the parking lot in just a minute let me finish my sermon here tonight that's the true what he saying is some experience she spoke ain't nobody happy until Mama's happy right and she never really really is Lord help us all right we'll close in a minute I'm G close in a minute but I'm going get to this right here his wife said curse God and die die just curse him and die give up Curse God and die but job without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without 1200 sermons on tap without a Bible Hallelujah job held his Integrity blessed be the name of the Lord God gave it God took it blessed be the name I came here with nothing I leave here with nothing blessed be the name of the Lord I know exactly where it's coming from I know where it's coming from yes yes I know who's behind this I was crazy at first I was bewildered at first but I know exactly where this is coming from blessed be the name of the Lord he gave me everything when I was nothing now I think I'm something he takes it all from me blessed be the name of the Lord Lord don't you let the devil fool you you can only stay upset you can only stay bewildered for so long but as a Believer you'll start coming to yourself you pick up one of them tapes pick up a couple of scriptures you start coming to yourself you come up out of the you'll come up out of the little thing that you're going through H somebody can somebody help me is that true we are believers there is nothing that can harm us nothing that could take us out if it's here God allowed it what I am God made me what I have God gave me what I know he taught me blessed be the name of the Lord I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for God's grace so now I'm going to get upset because things don't go my way huh no no no no no no no no what you have God gave you where you're going God is leading you what you know God taught you where you came from he brought you blessed be the name of the Lord so we see this Satan we'll move right up can I take one more example all right I'm going to take the prophet of God here in the message well there's several quotations in the message wisdom versus Faith I'd like you to get that read I gave several references for you to get and read for yourself but let me pull over with this one right here now Satan can't make you do anything but he can sure encourage you or influence you he can't make you but you're giving the choice that's in the message greatest battle ever fought that's the grounds we're on wisdom versus Faith worldly wisdom versus Faith he can't make you do anything but you can make him back up God gave you that a power and that Authority he can't create but God has given us the power to create that's been placed in the man's hand and little by little we're creating more aren't we but let's take the prophet here just for a moment as I as I close there so many notes in wisdom versus Faith but we'll take this one here all right Saints where the little kitties at all the kids from Sunday school man they did a good job even made me a little sword that was so cute wasn't it oh my did I give that to you sis let me see think I have it here yes we'll take this here here brother bandham now in the beginning stages of his ministry he's telling us how Satan came to him now God is the author of Faith Satan is the author of wisdom no not that one I'm sorry what was uh this is wisdom versus Faith the last one that Joe brother Joe gave you on the paper there I want to read that one this is when he was going through his test and his trial I have it printed out here but I didn't um yes and no see can bring it life until it's dead and rotten and out of that rotten mess when there's nothing else left to rot it it's only the life that lives when the son comes to God he has given test plural I stood there that day I remember as I took my test when I've been days after days months after months and years four or five years on the streets Corners preaching the gospel and trying to do that which was right in God's sight and he let my wife go right out from under me my baby lying there dying and I got down to the baby I says Lord God don't let my baby die eight nine months old little baby I looked up and looked like a black sheet coming down he even refused to hear me he wouldn't even look at me I raised up about 23 years old there laid the wife in the morg he ref refused to hear me for her when all I had done I said God tell me what I've done if I've done wrong punish me not then I said what have I done work all day preach all night stand on the street corners what have I done tell me what I've done he wouldn't even tell me then Satan come up to my side he said then you'll serve him when one word would change the whole situation one word will save your your baby but he refuses to do it he won't do it then when one word then you'll go ahead and serve him all the human reasonings that's right why should i serve him if he won't even as much as just look down at my baby that'll take all it would take and as much as I as I had thought I done for him then he wouldn't even listen to my own baby that was the hardest temptation all all human reasonings have broke away why should i serve him if he can't do that much for me and I go day and night for him he even refuses to tell me what I've done well human reasonings is gone but oh when a man is born again that's something in there that holds it come down to that spot when I thought where did I get her where did she come from what am I anyhow where did I come from see all the human part had broke away then that real genuine spirit of God laid there I walked over to her put my hands on her head she was suffering so bad till her little eyes was crossing together I said sweetheart in a few minutes I'll take you and lay you on mommy's arms out there in the morg I'll bury you out here under the pine trees and someday Daddy will see you again I looked up I said God though you slay me yet I'll Trust you you gave her you taken her blessed be the name of the Lord for then all my human reasonings had vanished I was at the end of my road but when you come to the end of your road then there is that real spirit of God there to take you over at the time and lift you up how many believe that that whatever you have God gave you and what you don't have God has refrained from you getting it if I got everything I wanted in life I probably wouldn't be serving the lord I probably would have lost my mind by now and be dead or strung out on something if I have got everything I wanted in life that I think I wanted in life but when I gave my life to him everything I need I found in him I'm satisfied I thank the Lord I ain't lost my mind I can read his word it challenges me it challenge me today I still know how to repent I still know how to say I'm sorry there is no message I'm I'm afraid of I thank God for the that's the grace of God I wouldn't trade that for a million dollars I wouldn't trade that for the greatest amount of friends or anything I'm so glad that God gave me a revelation aren't you let me read one quote and we'll close here in the message wisdom versus Faith paragraph 479 amen paragraph 479 look at this he says then if Jesus defeated Satan Satan upon the faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready congregation says amen what about the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now you believe the bride is predestinated the predestinated bride of Christ now the church the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it now everything is in order the Holy Spirit has been given the seed has been solded the evening lights has been shining the sign of Sodom that Jesus Promised is here and Malachi 4 a predestinated church oh devil Church of the Living God here and on the tape in tucan I added the two part but here and on the tape too do you know where you stand do you know that you are called of God and that the Holy Ghost Reigns in your heart and every word of God is real to you oh brother how is Satan going to stand against that how is he going to stop that from growing how is he going to keep them signs from following him why you can throw them in jail then you could I don't care what you do they done tried it they rotted in jail they fed to liines they were saw asunder they were jerked to pieces you can't kill it right a church that's predestinated those who he forew like he did Jesus he was called those who he called he justified those who he has Justified he is already glorified pre destinated you can't lose Saints you can't lose if it's happening somebody allowed it to happen is that right if you have it it's because God gave it to you huh nobody has their own little show I'm going to do this next I'm going to do this and this I got this plan I got this this I'm doing the church is going to do this I'm going to make sure I got this God's in control of all of that you say if the Lord will is that right you have plans you have hopes you have dreams and things like that but it's if the Lord Wills if you don't want me to have it guess what I don't want it all the people that I need to be in contact with I'm in contact with them and the ones I need to be in contact with guess what they'll come my way I will find them just like you all I didn't go on Facebook to meet n one of y'all neither did I run to the library run to school or run let me go find some friends let me find some brothers that love me let me find some people I can trust people I can care let me run over here let me join school let me
