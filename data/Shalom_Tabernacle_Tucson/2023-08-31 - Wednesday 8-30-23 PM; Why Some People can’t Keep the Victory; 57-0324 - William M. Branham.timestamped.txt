[34:06] a new heart also will I give you and in
[34:11] this spirit that I have helped within
[34:14] you
[34:14] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[34:18] of your flesh and I will give you
[34:22] a heart or flesh and I will cut my
[34:27] spirit within you and you shall walk in
[34:30] my statues and keep my judgments
[34:34] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[34:36] reading of his word Ezekiel
[34:39] 36th chapter
[34:41] and uh the 26th and 27th verses
[34:47] now we wish to speak this afternoon
[34:51] all this Great Mighty philosopher
[34:55] Ezekiel and his prophecy
[34:58] and now
[35:01] you know the prophets of the Bible was
[35:04] fell off as God's Eagles
[35:09] now in study of nature since I've been
[35:13] preaching because it was my first Bible
[35:16] to lead me to Christ have you ever heard
[35:20] about 20 years old we've never seen a
[35:23] Bible before finally you know we wasn't
[35:25] religious at all
[35:27] my people formally were catholic
[35:30] and they let the church married out of
[35:32] the church and was gone and they didn't
[35:34] have any religion at all
[35:36] and then the Lord just by his grace
[35:39] picked me up
[35:41] and it makes me loving oh I can never
[35:45] there's something within me that holds
[35:47] the love of God
[35:49] now
[35:51] in studying nature it's about SeaWorld
[35:55] God's great wisdom was was to let me
[35:58] understand
[35:59] the natural things so without an
[36:02] education
[36:03] I could then be able to understand maybe
[36:07] just Supernatural for all other things
[36:10] in the Supernatural of the natural types
[36:14] of things in Supernatural I don't know
[36:16] whether you get that or not but that
[36:18] that is true everything in earth is made
[36:21] of something above and
[36:24] types and so forth It's Shadows our own
[36:29] shadow here on this Earth is what we are
[36:32] now is just a type of what we will be in
[36:36] a glorious Resurrection when all of the
[36:40] sin and sickness and sorrows and death
[36:43] that's finished
[36:44] and the eagle was a type of the prophet
[36:49] now the eagle is a mighty bird
[36:53] and one of the satisfied I ever seen in
[36:56] my life
[36:58] was one day at the Cincinnati Zoo
[37:01] my boy was telling me a few moments ago
[37:04] they've got one just across the lake
[37:05] here and some kind of a
[37:08] little place where we got some animals
[37:12] over there in the zoo
[37:14] and uh I don't even want to see
[37:17] if anything I hate to see is anything
[37:19] changed up
[37:20] and I hate to see Christians cage done
[37:25] if you give yourself
[37:27] [Music]
[37:32] making strong Wings if you won't get any
[37:34] rooms apply so that's what I'll take the
[37:37] Christian has been has caged out
[37:41] [Music]
[37:48] it's exercising our faith
[37:51] then I noticed this Great Mighty bird
[37:54] the eagle
[37:55] and how he would take these great wins
[37:59] and his feet against the the cage and
[38:03] he'd fall backwards and he'd look up
[38:05] towards the sky he would beat again all
[38:08] the feathers as off of his wings and and
[38:11] his head was all beat up and even later
[38:15] on his back when he hit that great bars
[38:17] and fly back he would look up
[38:19] his eyes were weary would look at the
[38:22] skies because he's a Heavenly bird
[38:34] [Music]
[38:44] he would die if he went up there the air
[38:47] is still thin he couldn't breathe it it
[38:49] perished and got to the Earth but the
[38:52] eagle is made of heaven-sowing bird
[38:57] now if you'll get what I mean this
[38:59] afternoon I intended to be a lesson to
[39:02] the people
[39:04] as the Lord will let me speak
[39:07] you see gifts and callings are without
[39:09] repentance
[39:10] we have feet of a Mockingbird we have
[39:14] need of the rain we have need of all the
[39:17] other birds and all the eagles but the
[39:19] eagle can't help it because he's an
[39:21] eagle God made him an eagle and there's
[39:24] no need or any other bird trying to come
[39:26] up with himself they just can't go that
[39:28] far neither could the eagle be quick and
[39:32] sharp like a little hummingbird but
[39:34] everything has its place and every gift
[39:37] of the church has its place
[39:39] just because one's an eagle and one
[39:42] something else you want something else
[39:44] that's all working together in God's
[39:47] Great economy for the jewelry everything
[39:50] but now if the hummingbird try to be an
[39:52] eagle he would ruin himself
[39:55] if the eagle tried to be a hummingbird
[39:57] he would lose himself see if the dog try
[40:00] to be a cruel
[40:03] you see and the Soul can't feel down so
[40:06] there you are we just different and God
[40:09] makes us this way
[40:12] but the eagle we're talking about him
[40:14] now
[40:15] God liking his Prophets The Eagles now
[40:18] the reason he lied to death because
[40:20] however you go the further you can see
[40:24] if you can get up so high above the
[40:27] Earth you can see the entire Earth as
[40:30] it's round
[40:31] and higher you get the further you can
[40:34] see and God and His prophets of the Old
[40:38] Testament which God in Central Time
[40:41] diver Sanders spoke to the fathers by
[40:43] the prophets
[40:45] but in this last day I spoke to us
[40:47] through his son Jesus Christ
[40:50] and I as the Old Testament prophets
[40:52] would raise way up in the spirit
[40:56] we have they can look far off and we see
[41:01] things that were coming God would raise
[41:04] them up and down if the eagle could go
[41:07] ever so high and his eye wasn't
[41:10] according to his his ability of his
[41:13] lying that he wasn't doing any good at
[41:15] all out there if he was blind when he
[41:17] got there
[41:18] believe his honor is made to compare
[41:21] with the rest of his eyes and when he
[41:24] gets up he sees me and he can look more
[41:28] on and the Old Testament Prophet will
[41:30] lies in the spirit and Below up and
[41:33] would see things that were coming to
[41:37] pass
[41:38] andrazito was one of God's Eagles his
[41:42] travels
[41:44] and he would go away
[41:47] and he could see far off and even seen
[41:51] all the way down to our age now
[41:55] about 2500 years away he could see as he
[42:00] lays up in the spirit of God
[42:02] and he seen the day that we're living in
[42:05] that's why he could write it we can
[42:09] watch it as it comes to pass what the
[42:12] Bible wants us said every word will be
[42:16] fulfilled
[42:17] sometimes we try for us to believe it
[42:20] but God will do it anyhow because it's
[42:23] his word and he's he's
[42:26] all wisdom if infants you understand he
[42:31] knows just what was and what will be
[42:33] therefore he could Destiny to make
[42:37] everything work for his Jews our man's
[42:40] on the basis of three more or less free
[42:43] moral agent and he cannot
[42:47] uh God could not take a man and say now
[42:52] I'm going to make you do this I'm going
[42:53] to make you be a Seville a lost man I'm
[42:56] going to make you be a saved man that
[42:58] would be the nature of God now he's not
[43:01] willing that Andy should perish but he
[43:05] wants all to repent
[43:07] but if he was being instant as he is he
[43:12] knew it from the beginning we would
[43:14] perish and who would not perish because
[43:17] he knew what would be
[43:19] he's not willingness to be that way he
[43:22] wants all to come back to him but he
[43:25] knows who will and you won't so
[43:27] therefore he could by poor knowledge he
[43:30] can make everything work right according
[43:32] to his Clinic well that's a happy for
[43:35] his father like that
[43:37] just think of every one of you in years
[43:40] of Davis got your name over the Lamb's
[43:42] Book of Life
[43:43] you never put it there
[43:46] and you're preacher another put it there
[43:48] your church person but God put it down
[43:53] and when did God do it it's written in
[43:57] the blood of the Lamb how many believe
[43:59] there
[44:00] there isn't enough
[44:03] remover or whatever it is
[44:06] [Music]
[44:09] God touch your name on The Book of Life
[44:12] at the foundation of the world said
[44:15] we're just nothing you never had nothing
[44:19] to do with it I never had nothing to do
[44:21] with it God himself did it at the
[44:24] foundation of the world when he slew the
[44:26] land about four dollars he knew that
[44:29] Christ would be here and he was called
[44:31] the Lamb of God slaying from the
[44:34] foundation of the world and the Beast
[44:37] will receive all the girls upon the
[44:39] Earth whose names are not written in the
[44:42] Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation
[44:44] of the world
[44:46] I wished you Pentecostal people could
[44:48] see this
[44:49] that's one thing you're assured him
[44:51] that's what brings fear and trouble to
[44:53] you or you saw those animals Raise Your
[44:56] Glass on the deep end of
[44:58] eternal security in all this oil you
[45:01] don't have to worry about energy keep
[45:02] your hat in the Bible it won't that's
[45:04] right it's a it's a word of God and a
[45:07] man so that I'm saved I just do what I
[45:10] always do what I want to do the Battle
[45:12] of my movies is wrong then how vertical
[45:14] vaccine longer because if God's in me I
[45:18] only want to do those things that please
[45:20] God it's the nature of the of the person
[45:24] that makes him do what he does
[45:26] that's the nature and God in the
[45:30] beginning knew every person that would
[45:33] ever be on the earth and to begin
[45:36] he knew ever fly ever seen everything
[45:39] that would ever be he's infant and he
[45:42] knew everything
[45:44] and so therefore the day of our names on
[45:48] the lands Book of Life will replace
[45:50] there before the foundation of the world
[45:53] and the gospel to be preached is nothing
[45:56] in the world but the sustaining all of
[46:00] the fish out of the lake as Jesus said
[46:02] the Kingdom of Heaven is a preaching man
[46:05] a preacher's gun is born to do he's got
[46:08] the kingdom of everything
[46:11] now there's so many fish in that Lake
[46:14] and when the last ones brought out
[46:16] that's the end of it
[46:18] now uh pretty sure he destroys in the
[46:21] net he pulled in that greatness the
[46:24] Bible teaches he blames in everything he
[46:27] brings in water spiders drugs snakes
[46:30] lizards Terrapins tadpoles fish
[46:41] but if you just watch them
[46:44] if you were just watching the nature is
[46:47] in I'm gonna prove what they are
[46:49] right
[46:51] exactly right you watch a gospel message
[46:54] go forth many will come up around there
[46:56] I will show the Nets got him just a
[46:58] little bit there'll be a little
[47:00] brother's Terrace
[47:02] yes didn't leave it in the beginning is
[47:05] it happened to starford
[47:07] that's all
[47:08] and the snake will say you know there's
[47:11] just something about that old horse
[47:13] ain't Snape to begin with that's right
[47:17] the old water spider
[47:20] broken
[47:29] [Applause]
[47:31] for fish
[47:33] God's the one to determine and that's it
[47:37] this Christian religion is to take its
[47:43] firm stand
[47:51] that's right
[47:53] if the Christian faith exists our own
[47:57] educational programs about denomination
[48:01] and so forth and the building of big
[48:04] buildings and whatever that we have
[48:06] today then we do not need the Holy
[48:10] Spirit to ruin God's Church
[48:12] right
[48:14] then the best thing for us to do with
[48:16] that is we're in the right program
[48:18] that's how every person that can get a
[48:21] denomination started let's do it let's
[48:23] build the biggest churches we can have
[48:26] and that's why the most smartest
[48:27] preachers we can get
[48:30] [Music]
[48:47] the brother
[48:49] this great new spirit that we're
[48:51] speaking about this great new church
[48:53] that Ezekiel fire was not to be run
[48:57] along Internationals it was to be run by
[49:00] the Holy Spirit
[49:02] and then if the holy spirit is to ruin
[49:06] the church we don't need so much
[49:08] question about denominations and about
[49:10] the intellectuals and who can say oh man
[49:13] the prettiest and dressed the best we
[49:16] don't need that then let's do what Jesus
[49:19] told us to do go into the streets and
[49:22] the bodies and get the lame whole blind
[49:25] door and write it over there and bring
[49:26] them in so the grace couples will be
[49:29] settled in these days
[49:30] we need that that's the type of religion
[49:34] that we need then we wonder how we get
[49:38] it that we never was commanded to
[49:41] produce fruit
[49:42] no sir God never said anywhere to
[49:46] produce fruit we are to Bear truth
[49:51] and there's quite a difference in
[49:53] producing and bearing
[49:55] now we produce education
[49:58] we produce psychology
[50:01] we produce intellectuals the outside
[50:04] phone
[50:05] but the bear the free interstate on the
[50:08] inside coming out we're trying to smear
[50:12] it on the outside
[50:14] but God's Church isn't guilt like that
[50:17] it's from the inside coming out
[50:20] the apple don't come from the outside of
[50:23] the tree it comes from the inside out
[50:26] the life of the tree shows what it is
[50:33] [Music]
[50:34] and the church will come today
[50:37] it's got an outside intellectual
[50:39] Seminary experience the best polished
[50:43] Scholars we ever had and the church has
[50:45] got the weakest will visit ever had in
[50:48] any age right
[50:50] is because we're trying to control it on
[50:53] intellectual that's not God's program
[50:56] God didn't intend it now look you said
[51:00] what can we do girlfriend what Matrix
[51:08] now notice now the church doesn't need a
[51:13] polishing
[51:14] it doesn't need a face lifting it needs
[51:18] a bird it needs a a conversion something
[51:23] got to happen not just the strengthen
[51:26] our borders not to bring in new members
[51:31] a Revival is not to get new members a
[51:36] Revival is to reside what we got
[51:41] that's what we saw family
[51:46] not long ago in Chicago I was standing
[51:49] out for the great famous Lake Michigan
[51:55] ways were leaping and jumping
[51:58] and have our own mother let's go to
[52:01] Revival today
[52:04] and I stood there there was someone
[52:06] standing with me they said Barbie
[52:08] girlfriend I said the lake has a Revival
[52:14] I said what do you mean by Revival I
[52:16] said look after anything and chubby
[52:19] pounding its ways back and forth and
[52:21] dashing against each other just relaxing
[52:25] and he said well what do you need a
[52:28] revolver is having a rejoicing time
[52:33] [Music]
[52:42] right now I'm jumping and shouting and
[52:46] praising God is wonderful if we can
[52:49] still have the same amount of water when
[52:51] we come down
[52:51] [Music]
[52:53] that's right
[52:55] the church is not built of those
[52:57] rejoicing about deviled things that is
[53:00] built around the baptism of the Holy
[53:03] Spirit the love of God
[53:06] when you say what good does a Revival do
[53:08] then if you notice every time the seed
[53:11] has a Revival or relate it just turns
[53:14] back and forth is to mark all the trash
[53:17] out of it as you get to revive whatever
[53:19] the trash is laying on the bank it
[53:21] cleans itself in a Revival and God knows
[53:25] the Church of the Living God needs a
[53:27] reasonable
[53:29] [Music]
[53:37] [Music]
[53:42] that's right the wind comes down from
[53:44] heaven and gives it a Revival that's
[53:47] what makes the church when a Russian
[53:49] Mighty Wind comes from Heaven one day a
[53:51] Pentecostal Revival broke out
[53:54] that's what we need to take into another
[53:56] Russian Mighty Wind on the Pentecostal
[54:00] Church the gift of little isms and
[54:03] little differences out of it so the love
[54:05] of God
[54:08] through all the trash out of the banks
[54:10] to clean her out let's get started again
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:16] used to be they used to take the girl
[54:20] before they had to smelter and the
[54:22] feeder would beat the girl turn it over
[54:24] it's beat it and beat it until they beat
[54:27] all the dress out of it and how he knew
[54:29] that it got down to a really good goals
[54:32] all the piracy tools Zone and so forth
[54:36] was beat out of it the feeder could see
[54:39] the reflection of himself in it then he
[54:42] noted had it clean
[54:44] listen my dear friends today when the
[54:48] Holy Spirit which is the Peter will beat
[54:51] the church with the gospel to the
[54:53] reflection of Jesus Christ shines into
[54:55] the church then she's pure again that's
[54:58] right but we got too much power right
[55:01] and copper and other things in us yet it
[55:05] must be brought out and only the cedar
[55:08] can do it a Revival is what we need
[55:12] now you cannot bring a message of this
[55:17] brand new Holy Spirit baptism into a
[55:22] giant formal treaty Church
[55:25] you just can't do it and I I remember I
[55:30] love you for all my heart have hope that
[55:34] God will let you know
[55:36] but I've got a little boy at home going
[55:38] on two years old if I've seen him too
[55:41] long and I didn't correct him I would
[55:43] love him Sudan you're your children now
[55:47] I want to say this there are great new
[55:50] of the Church of the Living God in this
[55:53] nation has become in two factions one of
[55:56] them is going so stiff and starchy and
[55:59] intellectual and the others went Plumb
[56:01] off at the deep end on the other side
[56:03] that's exactly the truth that's right
[56:06] went wrong to the phonetic side there's
[56:09] no middle of the road I made that remark
[56:13] some time ago when a good friend of mine
[56:15] Roy needed the State president of
[56:18] Indiana a descendants have gone he said
[56:21] I heard someone say that you should
[56:23] drive in the middle he said you know
[56:25] that's not good ethic a man in the
[56:27] middle of the road would get run over I
[56:29] admitting myself but look fine dear
[56:31] brother he just think so much of the
[56:34] things of the world that's the only way
[56:35] you can judge things by the witness this
[56:38] is a Runway Road there's nobody coming
[56:42] back you're going on or going home
[56:44] that's right
[56:46] you know I know the other you'll know
[56:49] either such horrible girl from Deep In
[56:52] This World we're all with Christ you
[56:54] don't care any come back no coming back
[56:55] you just move on we don't have any of
[56:58] them coming back now notice friends we
[57:03] need our uh yeah
[57:06] bunch of real consecrated people
[57:11] that's what we mean there are the
[57:14] message
[57:15] today perhaps that we were if the
[57:20] president would come to this city
[57:22] and he could say five words about
[57:24] something you ought to tear out this
[57:26] Lake out here and something another like
[57:28] that and we'll start dreaming that way
[57:30] because the president said so they ought
[57:32] to make a Subway over here or something
[57:34] other they would do just because the
[57:36] president said so but rather we are
[57:39] reading today from a book which is
[57:41] greater than any place of this word it
[57:44] is that a president takes your I love
[57:47] our president thinks he's a wonderful
[57:48] man he does them kind of things but of a
[57:52] national Affairs what I'm speaking about
[57:54] I'm talking not to the the city
[57:57] officials in the way of taking care of
[57:59] their city I'm talking to the Church of
[58:01] God by the word of God
[58:04] here's where we need to change now you
[58:07] can't hardly gets the message to the old
[58:10] form of believing Jesus spoke about long
[58:14] time ago in the Bible he says you can't
[58:17] put new wine and old bottles
[58:20] I often wondered what that meant what
[58:24] did our Lord mean when he said such new
[58:27] line in all Bible well
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] today we only have glass bottles and
[58:37] whether it is New or Old it doesn't make
[58:40] any difference but when I visit the
[58:42] Eastern countries the Orient I find out
[58:46] that the water bottles of that day was
[58:48] made out of animal schemes
[58:51] and then
[58:53] when the animal's skin will fresh in a
[58:58] new skin
[58:59] or when it got old and dry and set to
[59:04] take new unpremitted wine and put it
[59:07] into that new wine unformitted still has
[59:10] a dream of life in it and when it begins
[59:13] to fairness while the oil bottles that
[59:17] were so set and stiff uh there was an
[59:20] explosion it could not hold it and it
[59:24] would just burst open and you the line
[59:27] would perish in the bottle repairs now
[59:31] that's the way it is today you can't
[59:34] take this brand new heaven born
[59:37] Pentecostal lime and mix it up for the
[59:40] whole time Creed of some sort some
[59:43] little certainly died in the world why
[59:46] did you do you're going to preaching
[59:47] about the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[59:50] Divine Healing and signs and wonders
[59:53] that are all scared of trying to
[59:55] stretching it up the days of Miracles
[59:58] Just Dance
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:03] okay you can't do it let's just put new
[1:00:07] Pentecostal line you have to have new
[1:00:11] bottles right and these bottles this new
[1:00:14] skin has still got animal oil in it and
[1:00:18] that new skin will stretch
[1:00:20] and when you begin to preach the baptism
[1:00:24] of the Holy Spirit the love of God's
[1:00:27] Divine healings times and wonders of new
[1:00:29] skin from the Bible says Jesus Christ
[1:00:32] the same yesterday today and forever the
[1:00:36] new skin effects
[1:00:38] message
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:53] [Applause]
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:01] that busy cost is not at your
[1:01:03] denomination now
[1:01:05] Pentecost is an experience this modern
[1:01:09] denomination
[1:01:11] here he causes what you received and
[1:01:15] that's right it's for the method it's
[1:01:16] the best dissolution metabolic just as
[1:01:20] much Pentecost and sometimes a whole lot
[1:01:22] more religions
[1:01:25] right it's an experience when you can
[1:01:29] taste it oh and when that new life
[1:01:32] begins to hurt and you read in the Bible
[1:01:35] says I'm the Lord heals all my diseases
[1:01:45] I believe in God
[1:01:48] for now what if you're always
[1:01:49] documenting the loudest your environment
[1:01:52] fluid has been pumped into you then the
[1:01:54] first thing in her life you know I
[1:01:56] always feel sorry for everything
[1:01:58] I go around to some of them Lords and
[1:02:01] look at that I think the Man's dead when
[1:02:03] you take him in and then they shoot a
[1:02:05] lot of fluid into him to be sure he's
[1:02:07] staying dead and that's about the way it
[1:02:10] is that some of these churches today
[1:02:11] around over America yes
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:24] [Applause]

[1:03:11] was Justice or I don't know so starchy

[1:03:41] all too is to

[1:03:46] watch this or do that or take a little
[1:03:47] ride it's too hot to go to church or
[1:03:49] something like that I don't feel just
[1:03:51] good you're gonna be worse than that
[1:03:53] some of these days when you're condemned
[1:03:55] at the judges are right and there this
[1:03:59] little Manny knows she she wanted to go
[1:04:01] to church she said well honey where do

[1:04:19] mama down there in a little dress all up
[1:04:21] over her neck just when the long sleeves
[1:04:23] and when she walked in the ushers cup

[1:04:34] her hair buttons on the back of her head
[1:04:37] and then faced it as thick as a peeled
[1:04:39] onion and she walks down through there
[1:04:41] and sits down the minister congregation

[1:06:01] heart and you know I just wonder she
[1:06:06] might not have her knee might not have
[1:06:08] been so great in this earth that it was
[1:06:10] on who's who but I'll imagine it's
[1:06:12] written in the last book of life
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:19] yes I'm gonna have it on the land's Book
[1:06:22] of Life
[1:06:23] yes that's the place to get it
[1:06:26] some time ago I was up into Northern
[1:06:30] British Columbia and a scene came before
[1:06:33] me to just killed me first I was in
[1:06:36] chasing the world please repair on horse
[1:06:38] and your daughter was returning I wasn't
[1:06:41] going to take his picture but I thought
[1:06:43] I could but I couldn't get close enough
[1:06:45] training on a little about three year
[1:06:48] old horse and just been broken he was
[1:06:49] trying his best to throw me and all the
[1:06:52] gorgeous we went me trying to hit this
[1:06:54] little Barrel
[1:07:09] up there
[1:07:11] because you were 500 Miles without a
[1:07:14] world or anything so I said Twitter
[1:07:16] which way and it's kind of Cloudy even a
[1:07:18] little foggy and that's the reason I had
[1:07:20] to get close up to the old fellow to get
[1:07:22] a picture of him
[1:07:24] oh I'm sure this is the right direction
[1:07:27] I wrote a little long fall cleared away
[1:07:30] in the food came out and I thought well
[1:07:33] I can see my way to ride pretty good
[1:07:35] just too bad I'll just build up the
[1:07:37] Farms make the night of it so then after
[1:07:40] going a little round my little horse was
[1:07:43] slattering pretty well I tied him up
[1:07:45] come to an old blow dance
[1:07:48] a burn over rabbit and it was a blow
[1:07:50] down turned across the trees after a
[1:07:52] journey life went out of them many of
[1:07:54] them just slapped over each other when
[1:07:55] the winds blow then I stopped there and
[1:07:59] let me rest I got off and sit down there
[1:08:02] a little bit and tell you what I call
[1:08:04] Twitter jokes guys kind of big white
[1:08:07] clouds in the moon shiny pills I was
[1:08:10] going on and I thought well this is some
[1:08:14] place to stop and the winds were blowing
[1:08:17] as it had blown away the fogging not
[1:08:19] beginning to hear the most memorable
[1:08:22] noise I ever heard
[1:08:24] now so what is that going
[1:08:27] and that's why I heard it again
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:31] I thought what a spooky drink and just
[1:08:35] then the moon came out was great
[1:08:38] pine trees standing there and there was
[1:08:42] just through each white and that moon
[1:08:44] shining down on them looked like
[1:08:46] tombstones and it was our most weary
[1:08:50] sound I ever heard and I thought what a
[1:08:53] place for me to stop
[1:08:55] but I fought in love do you want me to
[1:08:57] stay here
[1:08:58] I had my little horse tied up and I
[1:09:01] stood down again to wonder I thought
[1:09:04] well that makes down her own trees
[1:09:06] moaning like that makes it so weary for
[1:09:10] a person passing through here
[1:09:12] oh my any travel passing through this
[1:09:15] would be scared
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:44] and all these little insects I was
[1:09:48] thinking on that that each of those
[1:09:50] insects are the same insect it's just a
[1:09:53] different experience one comes back is
[1:09:56] another the palm of one caterpillars
[1:09:59] locusts of all the same insects and then
[1:10:02] just a different stage of its land
[1:10:05] and I thought yes that's right well then
[1:10:09] I see why the Lord is stopping here
[1:10:11] these great big little trees launch for
[1:10:14] real trees and that reminds me of some
[1:10:17] of these good big starchy churches you
[1:10:19] know they stand way up high like that oh
[1:10:23] my Lord still there's still fire until
[1:10:26] it's so hot that's all over the city
[1:10:28] and not just about as dead as the tree
[1:10:31] was that all they were once trees deal
[1:10:35] with the spirit way back in the living
[1:10:37] Methodist
[1:10:40] area
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:54] back in the beginning that tree God's
[1:10:57] Heritage back there which was his bad
[1:10:59] history if some of the new church they
[1:11:01] had Fellowship love they had Bible
[1:11:05] Doctrine they had everything just right
[1:11:07] and a long time warning said to eat this
[1:11:10] afternoon eat better so it's become
[1:11:13] nothing but a great big old empty spooky
[1:11:16] looking place that's about right and
[1:11:19] then every time the wind blows they just
[1:11:22] move and I said that's right every time
[1:11:25] God repeats the Pentecostal experience
[1:11:28] the only thing these big old lords can
[1:11:30] do is dangle things Americans
[1:11:34] there's no such a thing as that just as
[1:11:37] spooky as it can be to try to dial the
[1:11:40] people who refunding
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:55] they'll never believe it
[1:12:03] [Music]

[1:13:14] experience in this church is either
[1:13:17] Living God I vote Lord will you do it
[1:13:20] that he never a bunch of backwards they
[1:13:22] call us you know the Splitters and all
[1:13:25] cats or whatever it is but they you say
[1:13:27] well they were green they might be
[1:13:29] dreams but they're sexable to the wind
[1:13:31] and they can give but then they got life
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:34] that's one good thing I thought what do
[1:13:37] you shake them so hard for every time
[1:13:39] you shake a tree it loosens up the roots
[1:13:41] around smoking throat how to get a
[1:13:43] better hope and every time we open up
[1:13:45] our horse and let the Holy Spirit Come
[1:13:48] into US it only shakes their Roots roots
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:14:00] in the savior's love
[1:14:03] that's the church thing today is opening
[1:14:06] up and get green don't try to be on

[1:14:12] mean anyhow do you do yourself and the
[1:14:15] Bible PD means
[1:14:18] very much

[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:07] that's what God's are doing
[1:17:10] the experience of Christ
[1:17:12] as a game warden I used to work by an
[1:17:15] old place where I I thought the happiest
[1:17:17] spring I ever saw in my life that little
[1:17:20] spring was in the building of the
[1:17:22] jumping all the time
[1:17:23] so one day when I was passing by I sat
[1:17:27] down I said little spring what makes you
[1:17:30] so happy why are you always respond I
[1:17:35] said maybe it's because deers drank from
[1:17:37] me that she could speak back and say no
[1:17:39] girlfriend no I say make the call of bad
[1:17:42] things when you make you happy the known
[1:17:44] for them isn't that I say well this is
[1:17:47] because I drink from you say no that
[1:17:49] isn't it but what makes you double is he
[1:17:52] could speak back he'd say telegram it is
[1:17:55] the news bubbling and some behind me
[1:17:57] pushing me and making me know every born
[1:18:00] begins son and daughter
[1:18:02] emotions there's nothing pushing in you
[1:18:05] giving you this
[1:18:10] yes that's what we need to do his
[1:18:14] experiences of the new birth now I want
[1:18:18] you to watch the order that is
[1:18:20] he said I will give you a new heart
[1:18:26] and I'll give you a new spirit
[1:18:30] and I'll put my spirit in you I want you
[1:18:34] to watch the three of us a new head I'll
[1:18:37] get the old story all the way
[1:18:40] that's a little different heart to have
[1:18:43] and I'll give you a new spirit now many
[1:18:46] times it's been a terrible mistake the
[1:18:50] people has thought sometimes of that new
[1:18:52] spirit was the Holy Spirit
[1:18:55] but it isn't it's a new spirit
[1:18:57] God gives you well you couldn't even get
[1:18:59] along with yourself with your own Spirit
[1:19:01] hang with your own the Holy Ghost
[1:19:04] God had to give you a new spirit so you
[1:19:06] can get along with the history
[1:19:09] and sometimes people can do that right a
[1:19:12] new heart
[1:19:13] a hard flesh
[1:19:14] so you will receive it that a new spirit
[1:19:17] in that part and then I'll put my spirit
[1:19:20] in fact you see new art new spirit and
[1:19:25] mind Spirit three things he spoke of
[1:19:29] yeah

[1:20:06] want whatever the Lord has for me amen
