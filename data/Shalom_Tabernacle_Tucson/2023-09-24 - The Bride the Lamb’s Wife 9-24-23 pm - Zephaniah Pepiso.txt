that's our resting place that's where we want to be we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight tonight and we're just looking forward to whatever the Lord has for us amen we have one of our own coming back home today that's the sister Minnie and brother Jordan Craven they have two little ones that they want to dedicate to the Lord and as they prepare to come Jordan is a he's a craven but he's a he's a stall too and the Stalls are very good friends of mine brother Albert Stoll and this is his nephew and he's the Lord has blessed them with these two children Rowan and Avery amen so let's sing that that that uh dedication song bring them in oh bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to dream amen let's all stand in Saint Mark chapter 10 verse 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuke those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer their little children who come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and bless them brother Branham says this in the message the way of a true prophet he says in the Old Testament they brought the children for fleshly circumcision the little males and the mother offered her offering for Pure purification two turtle doves or a lamb but in the New Testament the only place that I can find to commemoration of this great service it was a dedication they brought infants to Jesus and he picked them up in his arms and blessed them that was the parents that's what the parents did of his day and his life was an example of what we should do see these things he did for an example now we just take the little ones that bring them to us we just hold them up to God and ask God's blessings upon them and pray a prayer of dedication from the mother and father to God as they present their child and or dedicate them in the name of Jesus Christ until they're old enough to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and now he said whatever we do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so that's what we wish to do amen so I met these little children at the wedding venue and this little one is this what's it that's Rowan yeah he's quite something else and he was crying and crying but no tears he was just complaining basically and then Sharon he finally I held him I got him in my arms and then he looked at me and then he really started crying then I gave him I gave him the share and he kept crying and she kept going kept going and all he wanted I guess he wanted the right rhythm and then he finally fell asleep and when he fell asleep sister Minnie and Jordan came up missing they were like where's their parents so they had a nice safe place for him to rest and so that was really nice and so we'll take this uh well maybe we'll do Avery first and this is little Avery and uh and we'll dedicate him to the Lord you can just hold her I'll just Lord Jesus I bring this young child Avery into your presence yes as you give this child to brother Jordan and sister Minnie and Lord we ask that you would receive her as they give her back to you in the dedication Lord we do it in the name of Jesus Christ that at the age of accountability she would serve you repent of her sins and be filled with the Holy Ghost if the time but Terry we do that Lord we believe that it is the prescription of the day for salvation Lord and we simply do it by faith you gave it to us we give it back to you Lord and for the little Row in here I lay my hands upon him and the mother sister many and Lord we just pray that you would take him into uh your hands Lord and take his life and Lord may his life be oh God a beautiful testimony of your grace use him Lord for the kingdom of God is our prayer and bless the home that he will be raised in and reared in May the Holy Spirit be the governing author over all matters lead them and guide them when they're out of the parents care that your angels will watch over them protect protect them and keep them from all hurt harm and danger and we dedicate them and we we dedicate brother Jordan and sister many Lord their life of service to you that'll be glory honored in your presence we pray in Jesus name amen amen that's it God bless you see you Jordan amen amen I make you say praise the Lord father amen tonight we have a special treat our brothers Zephaniah from uh Eastern Cape Town there in South Africa he was here with us last Wednesday and he shared a greeting he pastors the church in a small town lady Frayer I believe it's the name of it's a small town and he deals more in the rural areas he has two or three groups that you know in those areas it's not a lot of work it's kind of out in the bush and in the rural areas and so a lot of the young people they get a certain age and they go into the bigger cities for schooling and so forth and so he has a a work also in the bigger area of Cape Town from some of those so there's a contact there and he's got a couple little groups that he manages I know some of the brothers I've never met brother zeph and I until he came here I know some of the brothers in South Africa and I call one brother and uh he said no he's a good brother he's he brings a good report and so I met him find spirit and he came in the back there he says brother Israel I don't have much to give I'm just I'm a nobody but he's been preaching for many many years and he's seen a lot of things and I believe the Lord has something for us here tonight and man you believe that will you make them feel welcome if he says something that's true what you're saying man I'm brother uh brother is his name is brother zappanaya papiso papisto I believe and so as he comes let's sing that song um Amazing Grace just take a portion of that amen [Music] is in Grace how sweet the sound [Music] like me I [Music] was lost but now I've found was blind but now see amen I'll

you know brother how long should I preach and just constantly where you know you get some younger ministers that come in they almost seem like they want to put their feet on your desk and and they

inviting me to come and see all these beautiful faces and praise God and worship with you tonight I am very very glad I bring greetings from back home from my wife I did speak for just a minute the other night when we were here I don't even know what I said but I am married I have four children three sons and a daughter oh well they're as big as I am now they all married they call their own kids I have many grandchildren I want to tell you how many um I came over to be with brother Roger Collins when he dedicated his newly found a tabernacle I had met him 25 years ago in South Africa when he was doing his Outreach work he was with a brother by the name of Theo Erasmus Pastor erasma said gone to be with the Lord yes now he actually lost his life when they were together with brother Collins and another brother going to attend meeting in Durban and they were involved in the car crash and that's our brother left the sin so I met him then and I was just interpreting for him I had been an interpreter translator for voice of God Recordings into my language is a xhosa want to hear me when I speak xhosa ikama ikama that is a deer the dear the animal Akama I just want to hear all those of you to hear all those clicks meaning the lamp foreign then they they made me interpret for brother Roger then that's how I met him and if you come my brother has rightfully said that I come from the rural area of South Africa and those are remote areas quite remote as remote as you never seen a remote area we the people just still build mad houses no running water and and all those things and we didn't have electricity for years which has caught electricity a few years back and start is um yeah no street lights no anything if you go out there you'll see all the the heavenly bodies you'll see the moon you see the stars clearly in the night so Brothers uh when uh I became a voice of God translator and I got to meet brother Billy Paul Brenham and when he met me he said brother what language are you doing I told him I'm doing xhosa and he says Casa he says brother that's one of the languages that my daddy liked so much when he came to South Africa because of all the clicks the clicks and and then when I met Brother Joseph Brenham he said to me brother remember when you translate this message my father said you must not live in Iota you must translate that as well and thought what is an Iota he says to me do you know what it is I said I don't know he says and I order I'll give you an example it's like the word pneumonia he says that's a Greek word pneumonia when you pronounce it it's like you're saying it's like you start with an N only to find out that it starts with a P but you don't pronounce the P you can say pneumonia you know um yeah well I tried my best to be the best in translating and I enjoy translating for brother prenup you know when we get into the little studio and you preach there you you visualize your audience and you know you just put yourself next to brother pranam where he shouts you shouts where he cries you cry where he does everything I did and the Lord really blessed me and and I remember in one message where prophetam says the battle is Raging so I just got it from God and I said The Petal is Raging you could have said it in in many other ways but that just came and the people when they pray and our people that they pray even those that can listen to English and knows how to speak English they quote that is the lord gave it to me so I love the Lord well I'm giving the pastor has allowed me to give a few testimonies and while I was doing the translations brothers and sisters those days we would take a an English manuscript blowed up to be A4 size or so A5 rather and then we would take a tape you listen to brother Branham why are you looking at that and you would take what is written in English you write it in closer and I'd say while I'm busy writing that's something within tells me you wrote a wrong thing wrong wrong wrong and you know that voice that small soft voice would become not small anymore it would be just like if something would push me the other way wrong wrong wrong and then I scratch it I would be riding like this and I scratch it like that if you could see my nose you would see many of those and right correct thing the Lord was just leading me and if any of uh the pastors like pasta po who goes over there to us I'm such a neck and I take them I say you don't go to the cities only not to Cape Town Johannesburg Port Elizabeth and all those you must come out there because especially people from America we believe that that's where the message came and then now when we look up to you and the these people are coming from the source from where the Prophet was so we want you to go out there and let the people that didn't hear some of the testimonies here from directly from the host's mouth as you put you you you are that horse all of you so we want to hear it from the horse's mouth so that's what I was doing and I would if I meet any of those and I would go out of my way if I hear there's one in town and I would go to Durban walk one day I walked on foot and it was so hot in Durban to get some Believers that were in a hotel or on on the uh oh what do you call this thing on the beach front so I went there and I got them and I made sure that I will take them all the way out to where I come from and let the people here so I would go there and I would hold in my hand some of the books like uh a prophet visit South Africa and William Brennan moments and from God and all those all books and I'm watching their Ministries to see if I'll see the blessings that that accompanied brother Branham and some of the venues would be places where program had been like in Port Elizabeth the further Market Hall and the brothers would go there and I would look for even trips of blessings you know like healings and that type of a thing and I saw many in the ministry of brother Roger oh I just love the Lord and that brought us together um I like people so much I really love people and people love me in the message I had to I one time brother pranam praying you might be acquainted with that he says Lord let the people love me so that I can draw them to you how many knows that I won't give you the spoken word you're supposed to know and when I pray I don't repeat what problem is saying that because I Feel So Unworthy and I say Lord because the people love me so much I love them and may that Lord draw me near to you so I put it the other way around so it's been happening all the time now uh I don't my wife's grandmother is one of those old Assembly of God believers she grew up in the Assembly of God when she was a young lady and then she had seen Prada Branham in 1951 that's my wife's father's mother so she had seen brother pranam but they didn't know anything about the message and then when I came in the message my wife went to visit Grandma and she had a spoken word book with brother premium's photo on the outside and when she saw that said that's exactly real and pranam because in that photo as young as he was back then and then he says exactly will and pranam the same man that spoke one day and a lady by the name of Eunice who had a big hump on her back the hump just vanished like that create my witnessed that and she says she had a what you know what in in her finger that was a long word each time she was busy cutting bread or something she was so careful that she wouldn't cut that what the day that she saw that Miracle of a hump on a person's back Vanishing like that the next morning she looked at the finger nothing no what whatsoever but you you know the Lord is so good she never seen the message the way we wanted her to see although my wife took some tapes for her to listen to and she was saying all is well all is well but she never called peptides until the Lord called her home and what I am so thankful with is that I first saw the light of the message then my wife came then her two brothers in fact it was her younger sister that saw it after her and then had to Brothers also came in while grandma just saw the prophet and she didn't come in but I believe she's part of the Bride of her own time so brothers and sisters um I I I I'm really glad um I I don't wanna take time on that seeing its awareness day night and people has to go to work uh just um whatever comes to my memory I will say I mean touching testimony things um yeah maybe I will go into those things as I speak I told the pastor that I'm not a preacher I'm I'm not a teacher and I'm not much of a Preacher I don't know what I am but out there the Lord uses me so much and get people in in fact I received testimonies while here that they baptized in one of our little branches seven people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in another one they baptized one to me that means so much amen although I was telling Pastor that there's a death in our little church and brother it's not an elderly brother that much because he's in his late 60s he felt sick and they reported it to me on Friday that he went to be with the Lord I trust to go back and do his funeral he was a humble brother a brother that loves the Lord so much and please bear with me if you don't hear well what I'm saying I also don't hear you [Laughter] but seeing that I'll be speaking from the Bible you'll catch here and there and that's what I will try and do and back home I really speak English I speak closer and the Lord sent me to the cause of people out there you know I like it so much and really the Lord is Blessing us um I want to read from the book of Revelations Revelations chapter 20 1. I'll just read a few verses may we stand dear God we are about to read your word tonight and I'm so thankful Lord to be with this dear Believers hear a lot to come and worship and praise your Holy Name tonight we are opening the holy Rich Lord Jesus our Prophet taught us Lord that each and every man with two hands can push back the pages of the Bible but Lord he says it takes your Holy Spirit to reveal what is contained in this Pages Lord God we pray that now Lord as we read it may the Bible speak to us itself Lord that when we go out we say he did speak to us touch Our Lives Lord we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't have much to say if you have anything Lord I know you do to say to your children through my mouth please Lord I Avail myself to speak Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I will read a few verses from verse 1. Revelations 21 verse 1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for defense Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no mercy and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband I want to read on and I had a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with man and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am the alpha I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the founding of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but he fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and Among Us and Sorcerers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake with which planet with fire and brimstone which is the second death verse 9 and they came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last breaks and talked with me saying come hither I will show you thee the bride the Lamb's wife you may be seated I want to talk about the bride the Lamb's wife maybe while talking about the Lambs the Lambs the bride the Lamb's wife I won't talk deep as you would expect to talk deep about the bride but all I know is that I'm standing here talking to the bride and it's not an easy thing amen somebody said if you stand behind this holy desk and you speak to the people you must know that you're not speaking to the people you're speaking to Jesus Christ himself you're speaking to God so it has to be God in you that will speak to God in you Hallelujah so I want to talk about this this Sprite The Pride is made as you know of many members from across the globe from all over different nationalities different walks of life and the Lord has chosen his own and he has called them he's he chose and he as we know that we were chosen before the foundation of the world Hallelujah we were in him amen we were praising him amen as I spoke this morning in another church and I said when Michael fought with the dragon I was there and I know which side I was I was on the side of my girl and we fought them devils and we kicked them out of Heaven Hallelujah and in this life again the lord gave me that opportunity the other can be here and chase them the same way I did that before the foundation of the world we were together brothers and sisters fighting that enemy and now before we get anywhere I will make it simple I'm a simple person and I want to us to go to the book of Let It Be The Book of Peter um it's gonna be it's gonna be second Peter I'm going to a scripture that you know so much the first chapter of the book of Saint Peter verse 1 says Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ is writing to them that have obtained like Precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so if he's writing to people with that type of faith he is writing to you he is writing to the Lamb's wife he is writing to the bride and brother sister you know all these things as our Prophet puts it I'll give you just two quotes maybe from the prophet but I'll be just talking but I won't talk wrong things you know brother our Prophet says the Bible is a love letter a love letter to the bride from him to the bride many people are carrying the Bible they pack the Bible to churches some of them they do Bible studies but they don't really get what is contained in the Bible because it's not written to them it's written to the bride it's a love letter between you and your groom amen now let's read and I want to get to a place that we you will think perhaps it's taking us back backwards but um verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world talking to us we came out of this corruption in the world we came to the word forgive me because I'll mention a few things of the corruption that is taking place out there people are so corrupt in the world that they are so after money everything is just money money money money to an extent that these people will go to even reading body parts from people yes they know a kitten costs so much thirty thousand dollars what is that they go up and down we meet at the airports they get caught some are selling drugs you know the the abuse of drugs I'm not talking about in South Africa we we call a drugstore a chemist we don't say drugs though when you talk about drugs the already we're thinking about the abuse of drugs but people will do all those kind of things they are so corrupt they will sell everything in order to get money and get rich and richer and they do the the the world is so corrupt but the Lord brings us in the world is so corrupt they then little male children they make them female and the female they make them men and now they are tired of that they make a gender that you you wouldn't even tell you can't say he or she he's just a thing I'm sorry I said it is a thing you don't know what to say that's what they are doing it's so corrupt but the Lord through his grace he brought us in he took us out of that corruption he brought us not into the church but he brought us all the way to the Living Word father pranam says if I take you out of your church where will I take you to will I take you to the pranam Tabernacle he says no where am I taking you to am I bringing attacking you to listen to me he says no I'm taking you and I'm pointing you to Christ that's why we belong brothers and sisters but bit by bit I'm gonna talk about this Pride now this bride that's been called to take all the word of God this bride my dear brother the scripture says Hallelujah first of all we are given unto us and kale carry on divide this Diva nature and verse 5 and beside this giving or beside this giving all diligence add to your faith now I'm gonna talk about this diligence I I see this is a witness Wednesday night and I see there's many that are here I don't know how many you are I want to give you a hand for that you know people don't come to church anymore they lack the divisions and since covet some people had never put their foot in church and I want to touch another thing and because of the screen what do you call it streaming people say that um for no good reason because they're gonna stream but the Bible never said stream Hallelujah the Bible encouraged us to get together forsake not you're gathering together you must be diligent you must be diligent to pray to read the word of God Hallelujah to listen to that voice and my brother I'm not taking you back but Paul was saying oh Peter rather here was saying to his groom that you are so diligent you come to church you know you pray you help each other you pray for another but he was saying you you are so diligent but today my brother my sister people are so lazy we are so lazy God help me we don't have that diligence but now when when he said that I am taking you back to the ABCs he said having all diligence I don't wanna rush but I won't be long he says having all diligence you give all that diligence and he says add to your faith now that's why I'm saying I'm taking you back to the apcs where brother Branham talks about the stage of a perfect man he says Where It Starts it starts there in faith brother sisters for the scripture says it's not possible to please God without faith right how many is Faith tonight well how much Faith do you have things like can you tell me but the Lord said if you would have have faith as big as the mustard seed that's all that God requires as little as that we are told that the mustard seed is the smallest of all the seeds but when you plant it it makes a th gigantic tree as big as this building that little mustard seed the Lord never demanded that we have too much faith what are you gonna do with too much faith if you don't have that little one that is the foundation you must have that faith I know Brothers we doubt ourselves many times whether we do have enough Faith or not but the scripture says that's the foundation that's the first thing that you must have you must have that Faith now brother sister brother Branham when he talks about the stage of a perfect man he talks about the stage of a perfect man in the whole church and he takes it down to be an individual thing amen you remember that one I'm sorry I'm not going to read a quote for it we sometimes becomes all spoiled that there will be a code for everything I don't know maybe like attacking the people but now that faith brother William says the devil Satan when he sees the weakest of a believer on his or her and he's praying you know what he says the devil trembles how many say I'm weak tonight I was wrong people think they are you using some many times you think you are so weak you can't defeat this the smallest of of an enemy attack but brother sister my Prophet says if the enemy the ark enemy the devil Lucifer himself sees you on your knees praying he doesn't say when you shout he doesn't say when you jump he just says when you are on your knees praying the devil trembles because the child of God has got that little faith that little faith in you brother sister I have seen people that won't even pray for a sick person because they doubt um one time in joburg a brother was so bold he went and prayed for a sick baby says I believe my God's Gonna heal this baby I'm gonna pray for this baby and he prayed and the baby died and Believers were saying yeah what did he think he is he was trying to make himself a prophet the brother says Brothers I didn't say Thursday of the Lord he says the prophet says if I pray for more than I don't know what number he said but many people and he says if I pray for those villains they all die I will still continue praying for them because we lack that faith you know we many times we let down down our savior so much we won't stand for the little thing we we know brother pranam says in in the stage of a perfect man says that Foundation you must save that Foundation must have faith without faith you cannot please God those that come to him has to believe that he is and he's a rewarder of those that seek him you know what we we do have do you have a little flesh I do have I do have the little faith but then brother Peter says don't stop there add to that faith you you you you you you you bear with me I'm not gonna be deep but I'm just gonna say this he says to the faith you add you know you can almost recite it is it there thank you very much to the faith you add now virtue and the prophet says what is virtue some people will think if you don't speak to anybody in the street you hold your dignity you know the ways that they think they have got virtue because they are not you can't you can't talk to them anyhow they're not light you must have a way of approach when you talk they think they have virtue thank you you're there for so much respect you know that you must give to them I don't know them giving to you but brother William says that's not virtue we all know but I want to go into it he was he says virtue you know what virtue is he says virtue is power virtue is strength and he says the Lord Jesus Christ when the little believing sister touched His Garment vesuant out of him [Music] the Revival was so big or so on there were so many people they were bumping into each other and he stopped the Revival and said wait a minute who touched me I would like to touch him that way you know he stopped everything he said who touched me and the disciples said Lord how can you say that many people are here and we're rubbing Soldiers with Pharisees and everyone many many people are here now Great and Small are yeah and now you say who touched he says I know the strength the power that went out of me you know when you only have faith and you don't have that strength you know what they do sometimes we young people when we go to church you hide your Bible so that they cannot tell that you are a Christian why do you do that I mean because you have not added virtue you don't want to see you because you know nowadays it's easy you know you can just carry your iPhone it's not an iPhone see it's mine is not an iPhone you carry your iPhone your Bible is there nobody knows that you are a Christian you hide it because you are lacking that virtue you you don't have that strength to stand for the word you cannot stand for Jesus you cannot stand for the message and the message today is attacked so much from right left and Center there needs to be people that will stand for this word hallelujah the brother that the Lord used to bring the message to me said brother we shouldn't be shy we shouldn't be ashamed of telling the people he said you think the people at the time of Moses we are ashamed to tell the people that Moses is their prophet they wouldn't say Moses it's my Prophet Moses is our prophet and when you add that virtue you tell everyone that God has sent us a prophet in this age you tell everyone Hallelujah that I followed a voice that called me out a voice that is a voice to this age you you you you now you you you can tell I I remember in the revivals back home some people would come to an evening service like this and then the newcomers the neighbors some people might not come to the prayer meeting but they are not asleep I tell you some complain that they are so tired from work and then when you get home you'll find them still awake they're not sleeping you my elder brother used to say you would come back from the fields you'd be working the whole day and he says by the time you is about to go to church he says my heart in my heart something says you are too tired he says it's my heart talking to you too tired to go to the service he says stand up and say you are telling lies heart I'm not gonna use you when I walk to church I'll use the feet and my feet are not complaining so it stands up when he goes to church one old sister that went to be with the Lord now says in one service she was almost 80. but she was so strong she would go to church and she says this one day when she got to churches it was like she had the pain on the head and neck such a terrible pain is as if the neck was going to be cutting through and she says oh no will I not serve the Lord because of that pain here he said if anything happened if it's a it's a end of my my life I said I said to this pain I said if you kill me kill me now but I'm going to serve the Lord anyway I'm going to the service now brother sister now this this this strength or this uh Power this that we must add you know if people would come to church in the Revival and to the neighbors would say I had not you were there last night you went to that group so how can you go to such a thing and they call it names they they can only go you know you know what a person should do if they say those things to you I don't know when you used to tell them out there maybe not you if they say no no you say to them oh well maybe I won't go again you can't preach to them because you don't have you have not added yet you still have that little faith and you are adding virtue you say and maybe I won't go you go again the next day they come ah we hear you've been there again how can you go and there's that devil let me call it a devil that uh covet that thing that took so many people from their loved ones that thing that kept people away from church until they do not go to church even now that thing that took love for one another amongst us that even if you go to the doctor the doctor don't want to come close to you that thing that cause that not to hug our brothers sisters not to hug the other sisters that think that devil brother sister we have to overcome that thing we have to come strong against it we have to show the enemy my brother my sister if you add now he says add virtue I remember an old brother in my church he was a Pentecostal pastor and he came into the message I baptize him and then now he kept telling me that when I die you're gonna preach my funeral my funeral service and I didn't believe him because he had so many friends pentecostalia Pentecost all day you guess what he died at the beginning of covet he didn't have no covet but he happened to die at that time he had cancer so now I must go and do the funeral and our funerals there out in the rural areas a big thing especially if they know the person everybody comes and we get a Pulpit to preach to them you preach along and a long message then it happened then I had to go and bear with his brother ahead and go and do that as police there's everyone there's people you know think that I'm gonna contract a what this thing covet if I speak if this one coughs next to me I'll conduct if people are in such fear fear fear everywhere fear and while I was busy preaching there here comes the police and they come there to me and tell me you must not make it long they say otherwise we lock you up must not make it look brother so many people that gather there and while I was preaching I just said well getting it from wherever I just said there's not a single person after this funeral that's gonna be with coffee where they were from all the different places and there were so many of them I tell you brother there was not a single complaint about covet I had to stand up for it you know where when you add that that uh virtue you stand up for the right thing Hallelujah I know I know your message Believers but there's splits in our little churches I'm sorry but Brethren will rise against the pastor they rise against a good thing that's being done in the church and I saw the choir singing so beautifully here praising God and I'm just and when I see you you stand and praise God I'm really touched you know you you find people I'm sorry I'm gonna say it you find people that won't praise God they will just keep their dignity and say I'm white I'm what I'm white I cannot be just like them people maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe I think brother random was white wasn't he unless you doubt him like the other people do you know when he's at that day when you first went to the Pentecostal meeting he said they called that old man to go and preach there he said I felt sorry for this old man how is he going to do why don't they call the young Brothers there to go and preach brother you know how he says it he says brother when he talked about job and he took it like that right where were you and he says that man preached he says he jumped and he carried on he said I don't man I'm young and I can't jump like that but if you think that's in that old man can get all of me I don't know what uh why why what I will do and he was jumping and he was praising God and he was carrying on I don't mean to praise no one so much you know when he you anyway as always he is if he talks she shakes his hand he carries on he he goes on he says when I sing that song Standing on the Promises I don't want to be sitting in the premises and you get this one and when I look at him I say this boy resembles he's dead so much now you add you you you you add now virtue you stand for the message you stand for the word of God you stand for the cause of Christ you stand for the right thing you tell it to everyone because now while you are hiding your Bible you are not strong yet you had not at it but now you don't hide your Bible you you want everybody to see I know I know no no you want to agree but some of us in their little Corners at work at school they they don't have you called brother hi brother and you fill you up I'm a brother John Echo sister at work and you you kind of you want to duck you you you you you you want scoot down you want because you have not added you must add virtue you know any Adventure I'm not gonna take all of it I know you know there's seven whatever versions but I'm gonna take only four you you know anywhere virtue the people around you get healed without you praying for them without you laying hands you are such a blessing that virtue just give gives itself out to the people yes sir problem says if you are a flower you are a rose you would let that bee come to you and that be is not looking for anything he's looking for that virtue and you will take the fish and go and make some honey oh brother sister we should have so much of that when we should add and then why is all doing we are growing I will tell you at the end of these four virtues that I'm gonna take that brother sister we think we do have them but sometimes we don't even know what we're talking about let's mingle with quotes let me get a coach three kinds of believers I don't know if the brother might help me 63 11. 24e and there is a three kinds of Believers how I love that message problem talks about three kinds of three kinds of Believers oh I like it I know you don't like it do you like it no I'm just pulling your leg I know you like you like you laugh all the words but the thing is when sometimes you you bring it even to to our believers that there could be three kinds of three kinds of Believers but brother have you got it up for me no three kinds of Believers 63 11 24 e and uh I was gonna I was gonna read up there if it was paragraph number is uh number fourteen one four if you could find it brother please yes is it there yes um is that a different one or have I written it wrong yes yes okay oh yeah although now where brother Graham says now he says you cannot totally annihilate and anything he starts by saying that I'm trying to get it here while they they're trying to put it up um why I I want to come to that one okay um but I will I will get to what I'm saying I don't know waste time in that um sorry sorry Brothers assistance now oh you can't find it brother um you get it yes thank you brother I wrote it wrongly now President says I was speaking to a couple this afternoon about you cannot totally and yield how do you pronounce it annihilate anything human beings cannot annihilate they can tear down but not annihilate and somebody said well what about taking it and burning a piece of paper does that alleviate it he says no sir I'm coming to where now I like it so much it's it only breaks the chemicals apart the heat of the fire it goes right back to gases what it was in the beginning you cannot annihilate and now I read I don't know how many saw it I don't know how true it is in the news that Israel take a note now just print foodstuffs how many saw it you did Brother just get some I'm not so much of a scientist I'm not into science but they get these little samples from animals and then take and print fish for you and somebody said I cannot eat that type of fish how do you know if you you have not been eating it all along is saying here he says you cannot destroy completely anything you cannot make it come to not it will always go back to where it come from so the scientists have got it and we still lack faith but they have so much faith that they will pray the fish for you they will print meat for you they will print you don't know how they do it they do it because they can know you cannot destroy completely anything it goes back to the gases where it comes from and it will come back but that's not what I'm preaching what I'm preaching here as you you can go up a little bit my brother says thank you God then if there is a resurrection to every thing back again and no annihilation there is a resurrection of the just you know my brother my sister that Resurrection does not start when you die the resurrection is in a Believer now [Music] does not come when he appears the Rapture is in you now there's nobody that is going to come to you my daughter was speaking to me while yeah when I was telling him in in Tucson Arizona you are behind with nine hours with us and she says Oh Daddy does it mean that we're gonna get the Rapture first we're gonna be the one in South Africa because it will be morning with us before it's morning with you but she was just throwing that we don't really believe that the morning but then that Resurrection uh where am I now thank you brother of the just yeah he says and we are we've got to come back that's all that there is there is no way of at all of doing no matter if you bend up if you're drowned wherever whatever takes place they cannot annihilate just remember that every part of you maybe I'll stop there every part of you was here when God spoke the word into existence he put your body here he put it right there and there's nothing can take it away except God you know brother sister I believe that so much I was walking down a Dusty Street of Soweto in Johannesburg so despondent so had broken many things were going wrong in my life that's when I saw the message and while walking there you know I tell you tonight the Lord spoke to me from within he says to me why do you worry about all these things that are happening in your life he says don't you know that your life no no not my life he says don't you know that the core of your life is in my hand I didn't even know what the word call means call c-o-r-e because when he spoke to me in English he was speaking from within and I could see the spelling of the word well don't know how that is done but it happens so I didn't know what it means he says the core of your life is in my hand he went on to say in fact that core of your life is me that's what he told me I don't know whether it's all right to tell you but when I got home I went in a consulted the dictionary that was long before Google so I went and consulted the dictionary and the dictionary was telling me that the word core means the center of something the inner part and it went on to say while the dictionary is telling me that and the Lord reveals to me now he shows me a grain of corn in that grain of corn maze there is that little thing that is in the middle of the seed and that's where if that little thing we call it in xhosa is Bindi will mean something like the liver but we don't mean liver in that way we mean that it's the center of that thing is this being the salando so he revealed to me that when that little things go out of that that grain you can plant it you can water it you can do what you like it will never grow because that core is not there he said it to me aren't you glad my brother my sister of your life is him the core of your life is in his hand you are part of him and brother many times he says you cannot die because God cannot die so I I'm I'm with those virtues thank you brother thank you now once you have added now I said I had only two that is left I'm gonna leave it there he said now to virtue at temperance is that so sorry no less sorry knowledge I'm left with knowledge and Temperance and knowledge you know that knowledge it's not the knowledge of all the quotes by head it's not the knowledge of what time the church starts and what time it goes because if the pastor preaches long you'll be looking at your ass because you know it so much you know all the church order and that type of thing and prophetam says we like to say church or the church order and he says what about Jesus is just order spit on the ground answer me as it only man you know we would say you'll catch coffee don't do that that's the order that we know but problem says Jesus had his his own church order you add knowledge that's when now I heard that there was a man's breakfast here and I missed all those blessings brother Collins was telling me how so much blessings and then when those Brothers ditched the word when they talk you you you you you you add knowledge you add knowledge you add knowledge Hallelujah and that knowledge will help you Hallelujah you know you add knowledge my dear sister brother pranam says we we have in fact the pastor I loved when you gave me this because I had a cold that I wanted to read where brother Branham says we we are all given gifts there's nine spiritual gifts that goes to all the church men and women boys and girls everyone has something that you can worship god with you have something that you can do how many of the sisters will bear witness with me that brother pranam says you can't preach but he says you can witness to the woman next door when you hang your washing he says you can even witness to the man that brings to you milk comes to deliver milk at your place you can do that and prophetam says all those nine spiritual gifts are for everyone amen everyone did you know that now some people would love to be like you they might say they don't like this message and they don't like your church they don't like your long dresses sisters they don't like you wearing long hair they might talk of all that but in a corner they there's many things that they see in you they say I wish away I wish I had what he had I wish I wish I wish I wish and do you know what problem says there is one to believe so much but they can't believe they've got nothing to believe with did you come across that one so to believe in myself something they've got nothing but praise God that you have that little thing that little faith that little something that you believe with and then you add now when you add knowledge they come can come tell you this and this I know let me put this in that there's so much attack of the message today you just switch on you you go into the internet you type the name William Branham first thing you you get is all the people that are texting me false prophet false this and this and again there are those that were with us they they are taking the message so much but your knowledge of the word will protect you your knowledge of the word you want just go with them you know brother sister many of them were raised in the message many of them were preaching the message many of them and they turn right so against the message and they attack the message they attack the message but if you feed from the word of God you will be able you have that knowledge Hallelujah they'll pick up one little thing and say brother name was wrong here he didn't say but what do they say about the whole lot that is the truth if we might agree with him and say okay you say he was wrong here okay let's say he was wrong but what about all the other things they don't know what to say but the knowledge of the scriptures the knowledge you know with knowledge you know where you come from you know how the Lord brought you you know you know saw your armed so much I don't know spend time with knowledge you know you you add that knowledge of knowing the Lord you know it preachers know that now brother pranam says nobody can be a preacher unless he has met him face to face in the bedding push you remember what he says myself depending push experience doesn't he say and while we see it as the congregation we say so and so might not might not have the the the the pointing push experience how can he preach to us how can he even sink how can he do that we doubt him if he ever had the penny push experience problem turns around and says in fact nobody can call himself a Christian unless he said he has that experience you must add that knowledge add the knowledge and the Lord is I'm coming to Temperance and I'm finished that's where I was coming with Temperance you know what with Temperance they think now you know like I said turn out to have temperances to you know kind of all your dignity don't talk to everyone don't talk loud and you know must be a lady gentleman like you have Temperance and problem it says says now with Temperance people think that is stopping drinking if you don't go to Dubai anymore you're done having a few drinks you don't smoke you think you have temperance problems Temperance is not that right temperance is to be able to hold your tongue we don't do it we don't hold our own tongues that's why these boys I'm sorry to call them boys but they are that's why they just open their mouths something comes out in the internet against the man of God against the prophet of God against everything they just talk because they don't have that temperance but brother sister have you been around people that will say we we went on Gossip we don't gossip brother but I want to tell you no no no no no it's not a gossip but really he is like this oh brother I was in a church and the brother was doing so well preaching and he brought a lot of codes uh about brother pranam says even if your brother is wrong instead of talking about it pray for him and the brother read some Causeway problem says if possible cover it up don't talk about it to somebody else you can go and correct him as I when the two of you are there you pray for him and today we gossip so much not here but I've seen many message belief of us that are gossipus now brother we don't gossip we don't go and they talk they talk little he throws a little he says no it's not a question but yeah it's the truth man she is like this and he is like you know when that evil thing has come amongst the people they will even go into gossiping about the elders in the church gossiping about somebody said there were times when they used to invite the pastor for lunch party says these days they have the pasta for lunch they used to invite him for lunch but now they they have the pastor for you know it's so terrible but it happened since I'm not here maybe in many places but then brother sister now talking about that you know in the Old Testament when the children of Israel were forbidden not to eat certain Birds certain animals you know what another birthday we're forbidden not to eat to you maybe no they were forbidden not to eat an eagle Sovereign were not supposed to eat each other we are eagles Hallelujah we supposed to protect each other we're supposed to help but the thing is we do not add that temperance if you add that Temperance you use your mouth so much in praying so much is blessed blessing the next one and brother pranam gave us a simple thing he says if you have if you don't have anything to say just say God bless you God bless you God bless you he made it so simple because how much we we we we we we should now revving up let me read this this one one one one quote again my brother if you may the same same message that you were on and now this one is uh was that paragraph 38 I might have Twisted no I have not um but I wrote a wrong one still oh I will see this one here I will see this one here sorry brother I'm just about to to sit down now in this one this is now uh I don't know if my paragraphs are correct it looks like it's paragraph 16 here but it's something else Joseph was another believer he couldn't help being what he was he says he was different from his brothers but he was different God made him what he is nobody else could take his place he says nobody can take your place no matter how little you say I'm just a housewife brother Brahm says nobody can take your place God in his great economy he says did you see it brother okay he says nobody can take your place no matter how little you say I'm just a housewife nobody can take your place God in his great economy has so said so the body of Christ in order till there is no one can take your place now why why what I would like us to to realize we know it that each and every one of us has got a role to play God calls into you into this church he's got a role for you to play in our own lives you know I'll drop this in I'm going on with that code and I'm closing you know Nelson Mandela a politician they ask him in his time when he was aging they said what if you were given a second chance to live again and relive your life what would you do I wonder if that question would be posed to all of us here what would be our answer given a chance that you must relive your life many Corrections you do many Corrections because we say if if the Lord had given me this message when I was young if I could have done this and this I have done so many mistakes you know what Nelson Mandela said when they asked him you can Google that one he says give in a second chance I would do exactly what I did and I thought what go to jail again for 27 years do all he says you know to me that showed me a man that had found his position when you find your position in Christ you know no one will take your place you you cannot you in that you rather put it up my brother please because because nobody can take your place yes thank you brother down a little bit okay thank you oh okay okay okay jumping on us now but nobody can take your place he says if you knew if you are a housewife and I want I want to read on and thank you brother thank you he says how I would like to take Billy Graham's place any of us ministers talking to the minister they would like to be Billy Graham he says but we cannot do it but just remember Billy cannot take our place as well see we are all we all have a place some of us are evangelists some of us are prophets some of us are teachers some of us are pastors is that all the fivefold ministry evangelists prophets teachers pastors what did I not mention past us pastors okay Apostles oh thank you brother thank you oh that's what I like so much well I don't know why I like it well in this God problem talks about it Apostles pastors the fivefold but rather how many of us Brothers now promised propranam says it's only to men 35 for Ministries given how many of us know what we are you an apostle brother are you an evangelist my brother are you but if we could brother know our position in Christ no one is going to take our place I like it when he goes down he says he says even yes ah prophets we we whatever we are some Housewives some mechanics you know you just MBM again says it's your position the Lord put you there as a mechanic he says some farmers some of this in fact where when I close I didn't mean to to keep you so long when I close that very Nelson Mandela I was quoting here saying I would do exactly what I did here is in 1970s 78. I'm standing in front of a store they're selling newspaper and all those things Mandela is in jail he's been there for long and while reading this newspaper on the other side of of the window I read an article talking about Nelson Mandela and says Nelson Mandela who is serving life sentence on Robin Island that day brother I'm not telling lies I'm standing there the Lord says to me if I spoke from within says no no he won't die in jail he's gonna come out you know when God gives you anything when he talks to you about I don't know why he told me that but he did so I came out of that place and I'm working I know Lynn Salman hella will come out from jail later he's suffering with cancer he's sick he's being poisoned or whatever they called and a lot of other things but something inside me says well the Lord told me he's coming out of jail he will come out of I don't know why the Lord did it but that man in his capacity as a politician is that he stopped a lot of bloodshed I know people are not pleased with that some they say he compromised too much and I want to believe that but he stopped a lot of Bloodshed in the country now we as brothers and sisters you know what problem says about these virtues you can add and add an ad until you get to loving the the brothers you add you brotherly kindness kindness you add your head until you go to charity you can add until maybe you go past charity but problem says you know what these virtues are not all your virtues to begin with that's why sometimes you think I've grown up to here and all of a sudden you see the building has fallen I'm back where I thought I wasn't says it's not your virtue to begin with it's God's faith hallelujah it's not your faith When You Adventure it's not your virtue if it's you you're such a coward you know yourself but when you have that virtue you are so bold you speak about it anywhere anytime because it's not your factory sees virtue when you add that what's his next brother after Adventure knowledge when you have that knowledge you don't go around boasting that I know so much I know this message I can sit you down I can tell you don't do that sometimes you forget those things and the Lord brings them up when they ask one time I'm preaching in Johannesburg and open a meeting and while preaching that the Lord told me to and I'm preaching there and he has done the guy there while I was so busy I'm on fire I'm preaching he says to me hello sir may I ask a question now I thought he's disturbing me and normally you don't give him a chance so but they always go outside to me give him so I gave him the chance to ask a question he says where is the kingdom of God coming now I said to him well it's in the future but the word that I'm preaching to you now is making you a candidate for that Kingdom when it comes and he says to me now you don't know what I'm talking about I'm talking about the government when Jesus is going to be king and sit on the floor when is it coming I repeated myself and I tried to explain he says no man let the BFS where is the verse that says that where do I get that verse I'm busy with some other verses I'm preaching the people are listening the crowd is where do I get it you know what an angel stood up somebody from the crowd that I didn't even know where he came from I don't know where he went after that here's to there shot his whitish man stood somewhere there in the crowd he says here is the verse and he read it from The Book of Luke that the kingdom of God does not come with observation for the kingdom of God is within you I just said there you are you depend on him he's as Moses where when he made that that first miracle he threw down the this his stick and tend to it to a serpent and then the Pharaoh says ship magician trick Janice jambres come here throw your sticks as well so they did and Moses said to just depend on God on God's grace all the other serpents were swallowed by Moses's stick I just said there you are there's the vest and this guy says you can't tell me anything I'm a Bible scholar oh I went on him brother sister and I said you know what Jesus said to the Bible scholars of his day he said you Generation of Vipers and the man was so angry he comes to me he says you call me a Generation of Vipers I said no sir and I felt the Holy Ghost covering me like that I thought even if he hits me with his fist I won't feel it and he says he said you called me a Generation of Vipers I said no no you didn't get me I said Jesus said to those of his days you Generation of Vipers and he turns around he says that Bible is a liar he had attracted so many students that were coming from school they were there to see this preacher being defeated by an infidel and now he says that Bible is a liar and they were on him now they say you just said you're a Bible scholar and he says the Bible is a liar and they get it on and on and on brother I don't know what happened that day I'm just thinking about this thing that when I left I went to pray and from that day onward I couldn't walk on that spot I would be you know we used to as young men run down and up and down Johannesburg and he would be running rushing for a train and when I got to that spot something would so much fear that I would turn around and not walk there I don't know I don't know what happened there I don't know I would love to see that angel one day that should have been read that verse for me oh I'm convinced didn't no way he came from I Didn't I don't know where he came from I don't know where he went he just read the scripture and how soon he could have seen the scripture because he was not part of the preaching not part of that thing but he stood up he says here is a scripture brother sister the bride has made herself ready how many say we are ready problem says if you one day when we know who we are in Christ The Rapture will take place once you know so the bride is making herself ready we
