[0:00] Jo of stimulation of new wi that's and
[0:03] that's what it was on Pentecost when the
[0:06] word was Vindicated now look now Jesus
[0:11] told them Luke 24:49 behold I send a
[0:15] promise of my father upon you but you go
[0:18] up to Jerusalem and wait until what was
[0:21] the promise of the father Joel 2:28
[0:24] while we find out he's going to pour out
[0:25] the spirit in Isaiah 28:19 how there be
[0:29] stammer lips and other tongues and all
[0:30] these things they went up there and as
[0:32] we went through it maybe one said I
[0:35] believe we waited long enough let's just
[0:36] accepted by faith as good Baptist
[0:39] Doctrine but it didn't work with them
[0:40] brothers so then the first thing you
[0:42] know it had to become a reality and they
[0:45] waited on their Ministry for the word to
[0:49] be Vindicated right and when you come to
[0:52] seek the Holy Spirit you do the same
[0:54] amen yes you can't accept it by faith
[0:57] you have to accept Christ by faith
[0:59] that's exactly right and you accept the
[1:01] Holy Spirit by faith but then let the
[1:04] Holy Spirit come and give the
[1:06] circumcision as a witness that he's
[1:08] accepted your faith you see and see
[1:11] Abraham believed God it was a beauty to
[1:13] him for righteousness but God gave him
[1:15] the sign of circumcision as a
[1:17] confirmation he had accepted his faith
[1:20] so that's the same thing we must do we
[1:22] must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's
[1:24] done something not necessarily because
[1:26] we spoke in tongue not because we dancer
[1:28] we got emotional we shouted until we
[1:30] were
[1:31] changed until something actually
[1:33] happened I don't care what form it
[1:50] come seen Wizards speaking tongues and
[1:53] dancing the spirit sure lay a pencil
[1:56] down it right in unknown tongues and
[1:57] somebody interpret it right and tell the
[2:01] truth that's right look this exactly
[2:03] what happened and it was just exactly
[2:06] that way see them throw dust on their
[2:07] head and cut themselves in knives and
[2:09] covered all with the blood of a wied
[2:12] beast or something and and sure see and
[2:14] caught on the
[2:16] devil so you see that don't speaking in
[2:18] tongues doesn't do it though I speak
[2:20] with tongue of men and angels and have
[2:22] not charity if profit me nothing see
[2:24] though I could do it see so those things
[2:27] doesn't mean that you have the Holy
[2:29] Spirit but when he the
[2:31] person the The Immortal Spirit of Christ
[2:36] becomes your personal Savior and changes
[2:39] you and throws your views right straight
[2:42] into Calvary into this word something's
[2:45] happening sir something has
[2:49] happened no one will have to tell you
[2:51] about it you'll know it when it happen
[2:54] and the new wine when it brings
[2:56] Revelation then it it's revealed and
[2:59] that's way was at Pentecost they know
[3:01] that that there's supposed to be a
[3:03] spirit poured out upon them and they
[3:05] waited till this happened and when the
[3:08] Vindication of the Revelation took place
[3:11] then stimulation was on
[3:13] them they sure did they steamed up too
[3:16] they right out into the streets where
[3:18] they was afraid and had the doors shut
[3:20] and they were out in the streets where
[3:22] they hadd been afraid of a group of
[3:23] people are preaching the gospel to them
[3:26] that's right see something had happened
[3:28] because the TRU Word of Promise was
[3:32] Vindicated now let's stop
[3:35] here if that brought such positive to
[3:38] them man that they they nearly every one
[3:41] of them seal their testimony with their
[3:45] blood no matter what come along as long
[3:48] as they live they never got over it it
[3:51] stayed there because it was the True
[3:54] Word of Promise
[3:56] Vindicated the Revelation become a
[4:01] Vindicated and they died sealing your
[4:04] testimony with their own blood now look
[4:07] at the promise of the last
[4:10] days and here we sit
[4:13] Vindicated right before the the present
[4:17] coming of the Holy Spirit and the works
[4:19] that he was supposed to do and we find
[4:21] it right Among
[4:23] Us oh we should oh my how can we er
[4:28] something takes place I tell you friend
[4:30] when the real true sincere predestinated
[4:35] believer when that light strikes upon
[4:37] that seed something burst forth to a new
[4:40] life that little woman that the whale
[4:44] one those scholar priest had said well
[4:46] that's the Devil he's a fortune teller
[4:48] he's he's just telling those people it's
[4:50] fortune and he's he's a devil but when
[4:53] that little woman with that
[4:55] predestinated seed now you think that's
[4:57] not right but Jesus said no way can come
[5:00] except my father draw me and all the
[5:02] father has given me will come and he and
[5:06] the Antichrist the last days is going to
[5:09] be able that Antichrist spirit that
[5:10] we're studying in denominationalism and
[5:13] proven denominationalism is Antichrist
[5:17] amen amen now Beyond any man can walk
[5:20] with me like that he it is something
[5:22] wrong yes still believe that the
[5:24] denominational system is an antichrist
[5:27] when it's absolutely proof from
[5:30] history from everything there is plum
[5:32] through God's Bible and everything else
[5:34] it's
[5:35] Antichrist and Rome is ahead of it and
[5:38] the daughter churches follow right along
[5:40] and both of them are cast into
[5:42] hell right so we see this thing
[5:46] Antichrist the spirit of it and the day
[5:49] that we're living in and why it should
[5:52] bring joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[5:55] that little little woman as soon as that
[5:57] struck her my the seed BL first now
[6:00] remember the Bible says that in the last
[6:02] day that this Antichrist would deceive
[6:05] the whole world am there will only be
[6:13] a before the foundation of the world and
[6:17] when that true Vindication of the
[6:21] revealed truth of God's word strikes
[6:24] that
[6:28] heart St
[6:34] doing
[6:51] IIs the
[6:58] beginning
[7:07] and everything the same thing with human
[7:10] being a chist when
[7:13] all moved
[7:28] away
[7:34] can't
[7:53] found about what irus said I irus long
[7:58] way to
[8:00] he said when that
[8:02] last of the body has
[8:14] come beond was really stimula I think
[8:19] anyone let a moment let's think about
[8:22] got
[8:28] stimulated
[8:32] what he in spirit
[8:39] heet he was AET and he was in the spirit
[8:43] and he seen the resurrection if you like
[8:46] to read
[8:48] Psalm
[8:50] 8 he
[8:53] said glad our rest
[8:57] in because
[9:17] running over in 2 Samuel you got your
[9:20] pencils out 2 Samuel 6:14 they've been a
[9:23] dry spell they took the ark the enemy
[9:26] had come in and got the Ark of the Lord
[9:28] and they took down and set up before
[9:30] Dagon and Dagon fell on his face and
[9:32] tuck in another city and plags broke out
[9:35] that's the hottest thing they ever had
[9:36] on their hands down there and they
[9:38] couldn't get rid of it because it's out
[9:39] of its place now when they put it on the
[9:43] ox cart and start it back and when David
[9:46] saw the ark coming you know what he did
[9:50] he he got so full his cup got running
[9:53] over the stimulation when he seen the
[9:55] word being revealed back into Israel
[9:58] again he d in the spirit all around
[10:01] around around around around yeah his cup
[10:03] got to running over you see why he saw
[10:07] the word returning I think that would
[10:10] make anybody get a little stimulated
[10:12] when to see after all these years and
[10:16] then the True Word by the promise that
[10:19] it would be being brought forth and
[10:22] Vindicated what a time what a time
[10:26] now let's read I I get all talking I
[10:30] won't get to this and I have you all
[10:32] here till 10:30 I let you out early last
[10:35] night so I ought to keep you a good long
[10:38] time no I was just teasing you see we
[10:42] just want just as the Lord will lead now
[10:46] and when he had opened the fource seal I
[10:49] heard the voice of the force Beast say
[10:52] come see now when the lamb had opened
[10:55] the fourth seal let's sto there now the
[10:58] fourth now who opened it the lamb was
[11:01] anybody else worthy no one else could do
[11:03] it no the lamb opened the fourth seal
[11:07] and um the fourth Beast a living
[11:10] creature Like an Eagle said to John come
[11:14] see what the fourth mystery of the uh
[11:19] Plan of Redemption has been hid in this
[11:22] book because the lamb is opening it in
[11:24] other words that's what he was saying
[11:26] there's a fourth mystery here I've oan
[11:29] symbol now John I don't know whether you
[11:32] understood or not but he wrote down what
[11:34] he saw but it was a mystery so he wrote
[11:37] what he saw the lamb was breaking the
[11:39] seals and God still wasn't going to
[11:41] reveal it it was left for the last days
[11:45] am now we had symbols and we pred at it
[11:48] and done very good sometimes see but we
[11:51] know it's moved right on but now in the
[11:53] last days we can look back and see where
[11:56] it has been and that is supposed to be
[11:58] done that at the end of the church age
[12:01] just before the Rapture
[12:04] amen how anyone can get the church going
[12:06] through the tribulation I don't know but
[12:09] what it got to go through the
[12:10] tribulation for when has got hasn't got
[12:12] a sin I mean I don't mean the church the
[12:14] church will go through the tribulation
[12:15] but I'm talking about the bride the
[12:17] bride oh it has got a sin against it at
[12:20] all it's done been bleached out there's
[12:22] not even a uh not even a smell of it
[12:24] nothing left they're perfect before God
[12:28] so what's the to purify them but the
[12:30] others do the church does go through the
[12:32] tribulation but not the bride now now we
[12:37] just took it in all kind of symbols now
[12:39] like uh the the church Noah the car over
[12:42] type went on out into sin see now they
[12:46] did go over but Enoch went first that
[12:49] was the type of the saints that would go
[12:52] in the and before the tribulation period
[12:55] now we find out this lamb open the seal
[12:58] now the first Beast we find if you
[13:01] notice the first Beast we find was the
[13:06] oh the first Beast was
[13:08] alive the living creature found that in
[13:12] the book of the of the church ages and
[13:14] then the second beast I believe was the
[13:18] the face of an ox or a
[13:22] calf and the third Beast was the face of
[13:26] a
[13:27] man but the fourth Beast was a face of
[13:30] an eagle now that's exactly the way we
[13:33] got him routining just exactly like that
[13:37] and that's exactly the way they're even
[13:39] placed in the book here and that is a
[13:41] great teacher at one time in Florida
[13:43] teaching saying that that the the book
[13:46] of Acts was just merely a a scaff work
[13:49] for the U for the church the church was
[13:52] found in the four gospels and we find
[13:55] Vice from that that it's the four
[13:59] gospels that guards the book of Acts
[14:02] it's from those four gospels that the
[14:04] book of Acts is written the acts of the
[14:07] holy spirit in the
[14:08] apostles and we find over the book that
[14:11] them guards are sitting there watching
[14:13] east north west and south remember how
[14:15] we draw it out here how beautifully and
[14:18] perfectly everything hit just to its
[14:19] spot now I want you to notice said come
[14:23] and see John I want you to notice again
[14:27] before this now this here is the last of
[14:32] the
[14:33] writers to reveal the working of the
[14:36] Antichrist tomorrow night strikes the
[14:39] souls under the altar the next night the
[14:42] judgments next night the going away of
[14:45] this of the End of the Age end of time
[14:47] of all things when she's taken up
[14:50] therefore right in that seven seal there
[14:52] pours out vows and everything else are
[14:54] poured out what they are I don't know
[14:57] notice but now on this year we find that
[15:02] this fell here is an eagle this man that
[15:05] or this living creature that's U poured
[15:08] for here now or in other words there's
[15:10] four different ages of it there was an
[15:13] age of the line and uh we find out this
[15:17] being the fourth Ag and he said come and
[15:20] see the fourth mystery of the book of
[15:23] redemption that's been hidden in this
[15:25] book come see and John went to see and
[15:31] he saw a Pale
[15:34] Horse and again the same rer upon this
[15:38] Pale Horse now he has a
[15:42] name called
[15:45] Death now notice none of the other Rider
[15:50] none of the other horses or no time that
[15:52] this rider ever wrote they didn't have
[15:55] that man had no
[15:57] name but now
[15:59] he is called death it's not
[16:03] mentioned he's revealed now what he is
[16:07] is death well how we could Linger on
[16:10] that for a sermon and make it real plain
[16:14] but anything that's anti that's against
[16:18] the real has to be death because there's
[16:20] only two subjects that's life and
[16:24] death and that proves that the holy
[16:27] spiritual revelation of this and this
[16:29] day is exactly the truth the
[16:32] anti he's death because the word as
[16:37] we'll see later here is life amen and
[16:41] this man is called death now it was um
[16:46] not mentioned of the other times of this
[16:49] writer but since now it is mentioned
[16:54] that he's called
[16:56] death but uh under the revelation of the
[17:01] line I watch I I want to read this post
[17:05] so I be sure R down play stand here
[17:08] under not under the revelation of the
[17:12] lines
[17:14] age or of the first age the early age
[17:19] this wasn't revealed the next age was
[17:21] the age of the ox which is the Dark Age
[17:25] the middle age it wasn't revealed as
[17:28] what was now the manlike Beast of wisdom
[17:34] representing the reformers Luther and
[17:36] Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed
[17:39] but in the eagle age the last age the
[17:43] prophetic age were there is to rise
[17:47] prophetic
[17:49] utterance
[17:51] see through whom the secrets always
[17:55] comes now there's where we just we go to
[17:58] a l on that a little while tonight so
[18:00] that you'll thoroughly understand now
[18:03] most times you realize these I'm just
[18:06] not speaking of this group here these
[18:07] tapes go
[18:09] everywhere and I must make it clear
[18:11] because somebody just get one tape and
[18:13] then if you don't get the rest of them
[18:14] they're all hung up
[18:16] see God has promised this see for this
[18:22] day for the last ending up of all these
[18:26] different things that's gone on and
[18:27] being mixed up we are we've had Elijah's
[18:31] garments we've had Elijah's robes oh
[18:34] there's been people it's John Alexander
[18:37] Dow is buried up there wrapped in a a
[18:39] robe he said he was Elijah and we've had
[18:42] all kinds of things like that what is it
[18:45] anyhow it's only to take away a truth
[18:48] that is going to be presented amen amen
[18:51] they had false Christ before Jesus time
[18:55] see they always do that it's Satan
[18:57] running out of Counter
[19:00] to upset the minds and the faith of the
[19:02] people before the thing actually
[19:05] happens that's all didn't Gia say the
[19:08] same thing to the Jews that day said
[19:10] wasn't there a man raised up professed
[19:12] to be this and they tuck 400 out in the
[19:13] wilderness they perished and so forth
[19:15] said every branch that my heavenly
[19:17] father hasn't planted Jesus that'll be
[19:19] rooted upia said let them alone if they

[59:56] uh we've never I never really talked to

[1:00:08] him a little bit and he was interested
[1:00:11] and so I took him to brother osorio's
[1:00:13] Barber barber shop there on the south
[1:00:17] and brother Isaac Osorio took the
[1:00:19] Spanish Bible and uh compared the
[1:00:22] scriptures with him and he saw that he
[1:00:25] needed to be back baptized in the name
[1:00:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so
[1:00:29] we're so happy to to hear those news and

[1:04:54] 5
[1:04:58] verses number one and I

[1:05:04] the throne a book written within and on
[1:05:08] the backside sealed with Seven Seals and
[1:05:12] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with
[1:05:15] the loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:05:18] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[1:05:22] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[1:05:25] under the Earth Earth was able to open
[1:05:27] the book neither to look thereon and I

[1:05:33] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:05:36] neither to look thereon and one of the
[1:05:39] elders said unto me weep not Behold The
[1:05:42] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:05:46] David have prevailed to open the book
[1:05:49] and to loose the Seven
[1:05:51] Seals
[1:05:53] thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst
[1:05:57] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[1:05:59] in the midst of the elders stood a
[1:06:01] lamb as it had been
[1:06:03] slain having seven horns seven eyes
[1:06:07] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:06:10] forth into all the Earth and he came
[1:06:14] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:06:16] him that sat upon the throne and when he
[1:06:20] had taken the book The Four beasts and
[1:06:23] 420 Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:06:28] having every one of them Harps and
[1:06:30] golden vials full of odors which are the
[1:06:34] prayers of the Saints and they sung a
[1:06:36] new song
[1:06:38] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:06:41] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[1:06:45] was slain and H has redeemed us to God
[1:06:50] by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue
[1:06:54] and people and nation and has made us
[1:06:58] unto our God Kings and Priests and we
[1:07:03] shall reain on the earth how many can
[1:07:06] say praise the Lord for his word let us
[1:07:10] pray Lord Jesus we thank you for the
[1:07:12] words of Life as we have read out of the
[1:07:16] book of life we pray father that you
[1:07:19] would bless these efforts and words that
[1:07:22] will be spoken this morning to your
[1:07:25] people people Lord let us only speak
[1:07:28] that which you have for us to say and to
[1:07:31] hear bless each Heart Lord The Young
[1:07:34] Ones the older ones the new ones and the
[1:07:38] mature believer just each one may they
[1:07:40] receive their portion from you is our
[1:07:43] prayer we ask in Jesus name amen God
[1:07:47] bless you you may be
[1:07:49] seated amen amen amen a re a year of
[1:07:54] release the year year of release we read
[1:07:57] about this year of release it's also
[1:08:01] mentioned in Deuteronomy chapter
[1:08:03] 15 and Exodus chapter 21 speaking of the
[1:08:08] abond servant or when the Hebrews would
[1:08:12] come into the land and they have their
[1:08:15] own Brethren that would borrow money or
[1:08:19] need to borrow because they have fallen
[1:08:23] into debt and so they would hire them or
[1:08:26] they would become servants to their own
[1:08:29] Brethren but it wasn't the intention
[1:08:33] that for them to always stay a servant
[1:08:36] so there was a year of release and this
[1:08:39] year of release was every seven years
[1:08:43] and then s years times seven years it
[1:08:46] would be a jubilee year a land a year
[1:08:50] for rest to the land to the animals all
[1:08:54] creditors would be um all debtors would
[1:08:58] be released from their debt and the Lord
[1:09:02] says that even even if no matter what
[1:09:06] they owed if a one let's say brother
[1:09:10] owed another brother in the seven year
[1:09:13] of release or in this Jubilee year of
[1:09:16] release he's to let him go for free he's
[1:09:20] to um Wipe Out the debt and he's to not
[1:09:24] send them him away empty-handed even
[1:09:28] he's to uh bestow him with Bountiful
[1:09:31] gifts as he releases him and the Lord
[1:09:35] says to do this and do it happily and
[1:09:38] freely because I will bless you and
[1:09:42] what's this intention the intention is
[1:09:44] that that we don't want none of our
[1:09:46] brothers living under this pressure of
[1:09:49] being in debt all the time under bondage
[1:09:53] so he offers the year of release it's a
[1:09:58] natural law that was established by God
[1:10:01] to the
[1:10:02] Hebrews remember they came out of Egypt
[1:10:06] and they were in bondage for 400 years
[1:10:10] plus and they were uh slaves for years
[1:10:15] and years and their whole bodies were
[1:10:19] slaves they were um in bondage to the
[1:10:23] Egyptians and so the Lord Lord now in
[1:10:26] their release they're being set free
[1:10:28] from in from Egypt through an exodus the
[1:10:33] Lord is now establishing these laws in
[1:10:35] Israel so they don't become like their
[1:10:38] former
[1:10:40] abusers as as you could see that happens
[1:10:43] many times many times people they're
[1:10:46] under debt and they're in stress and
[1:10:48] they have problems and then soon as they
[1:10:50] get released from that they go out and
[1:10:52] they start uh making other
[1:10:56] they become a Taskmaster themselves so
[1:10:58] the Lord was trying to or not trying to
[1:11:01] the Lord was establishing these laws so
[1:11:04] that these folks these people our
[1:11:06] Brethren would not live under this
[1:11:09] bondage of debt if he owed something you
[1:11:11] had to pay it but then there was a year
[1:11:14] of release that the Lord released you
[1:11:18] now in the book of redemption that we
[1:11:22] read from the book The Bible was the
[1:11:25] book of redemption and we've been
[1:11:27] sharing that with you the last few
[1:11:30] Services before Easter on the things
[1:11:34] that Adam
[1:11:35] lost and brother Adam says that the book
[1:11:39] was the book of redemption and that this
[1:11:42] strong Angel cried out with the loud
[1:11:45] voice who is worthy to take this book
[1:11:48] and John wept and why did he weep he
[1:11:52] wept because there was no man in heaven
[1:11:54] or Earth
[1:11:55] and all the worthy men that have gone on
[1:11:58] before no one was worthy to take this
[1:12:01] book and to loose the seals well what's
[1:12:04] so important about this book well this
[1:12:07] book had the um Freedom rights for
[1:12:13] Humanity and so if this book can be
[1:12:16] released and put back into the hands of
[1:12:19] the original man then we can all go free
[1:12:23] but if there's no one worthy if there is
[1:12:25] no one that can fit the laws to even
[1:12:28] read the book let alone open it and
[1:12:32] begin to release it out he couldn't even
[1:12:35] look at the book no man was found worthy
[1:12:38] so John wept and then the voice that
[1:12:41] strong angel said weep not John for the
[1:12:45] lion has prevailed the lamb has come
[1:12:50] forth and he's worthy to take the book
[1:12:54] and to open the seals thereof and when
[1:12:57] John saw that and the 24 elders and all
[1:13:01] of the hosts that heard that they begin
[1:13:03] to sing a new song and they fell down
[1:13:07] and begin to worship the lamb because he
[1:13:10] was worthy yes I wonder this morning as
[1:13:14] we've been preaching on the Wednesday
[1:13:16] nights on our gifts and how we give I
[1:13:18] wonder this morning if you gave an
[1:13:22] offering of praise to the Lord this
[1:13:24] morning morning I wondered if it was a
[1:13:27] duty for you to sing those songs of Zion
[1:13:31] or if it came from a willing Heart of
[1:13:34] Thanksgiving and coming to offer the
[1:13:37] fruits of your lips through the altar of
[1:13:40] God praise and thanksgiving for all that
[1:13:44] you've done it it can become a chore it
[1:13:48] be it can feel like a duty but when you
[1:13:52] get past all the requirements and you
[1:13:55] get past of making sure we're all in key
[1:13:58] and you get past we make sure the song
[1:14:00] is up on there and we got the song right
[1:14:03] when you get past all of that what
[1:14:04] everybody's wearing who's singing and
[1:14:07] who's not singing when you get past all
[1:14:09] of that and you can see him who saved
[1:14:12] you then you can worship then you can
[1:14:16] give him praise and offer Sacrifice from
[1:14:21] your lips to God in worship and praise
[1:14:25] and that's what they did they saw the
[1:14:28] book restored back to men and they begin
[1:14:31] to praise and offer
[1:14:34] sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving
[1:14:37] and they sang a new song didn't they and
[1:14:40] so we know that this book of redemption
[1:14:44] is is the key to everything that Adam
[1:14:48] lost now we won't go deep into it but
[1:14:51] I'll read one or two quotes that I
[1:14:54] didn't read on what Adam lost in the
[1:14:58] message who is god brother brandom says
[1:15:01] this it's a very hard listening to
[1:15:03] listen to because the recording on it is
[1:15:06] not that good but if you get a chance to
[1:15:09] hear that message who is God right in
[1:15:11] the beginning brother Brandon begins to
[1:15:15] uh go back he said a a billion years
[1:15:20] before creation and then he said go back
[1:15:23] another billion after after that billion
[1:15:26] and then he's talking about that time
[1:15:28] frame there and he says this here in
[1:15:32] paragraph
[1:15:38] number 13 now let's look who God is just
[1:15:43] a little bit I'm feeling for something
[1:15:47] tonight I've asked God something and I
[1:15:49] believe he's going to Grant it to me I
[1:15:52] believe it with all my heart now you
[1:15:54] being in prayer I can't speak until he
[1:15:57] speaks let me stop here for a minute do
[1:15:59] you ever ask God for anything and then
[1:16:02] you're waiting for him to give it to you
[1:16:05] have you done that this morning you can
[1:16:08] ask God to show you something this
[1:16:10] morning that you've never seen before
[1:16:13] it's a little key it's a little portion
[1:16:16] that'll help you for tomorrow you can
[1:16:19] ask God for that and he'll give it to
[1:16:21] you some of us need that some some of us
[1:16:26] let's say all of us need something from
[1:16:30] the Lord and that comes by asking him
[1:16:33] well the Lord knows what I need no you
[1:16:35] have to ask him Lord I'm having a
[1:16:39] difficulty with this is there something
[1:16:41] in this morning's message that will take
[1:16:44] that away is there something and then go
[1:16:47] to looking for it you ask him and then
[1:16:49] go to looking for your amen spot amen
[1:16:54] all right Saints and so he says I can't
[1:16:56] speak in a till speak let's just take
[1:17:00] back and find out just a minute who God
[1:17:02] is let's look back at the beginning of
[1:17:05] time this is a little picture I want to
[1:17:08] draw so you can get some conception of
[1:17:11] who this being is in our midst tonight
[1:17:14] that's moving among us if you can only
[1:17:17] realize who that is healing would be
[1:17:20] secondarily or a minor thing to you if
[1:17:23] you can just see who he is now let's
[1:17:27] take back a hundred billion years ago
[1:17:30] and then take back a 100 billion years
[1:17:33] before that and just keep on going back
[1:17:37] here not long ago I was in California at
[1:17:39] the observatory they had a glass there
[1:17:42] and they could see 120 million years of
[1:17:45] light space let's drop down a little bit
[1:17:48] but let's think of before there ever was
[1:17:51] anything there was God he was in the
[1:17:54] beginning let's see him and picture him
[1:17:56] out there in space that's Jehovah we're
[1:17:59] speaking of and watch how the Trinity of
[1:18:03] God comes to man just for a moment and
[1:18:06] there that great space where no one can
[1:18:09] fathom in their mind beyond that that
[1:18:12] space eternity that's Jehovah God out
[1:18:16] there and we're taught in the beginning
[1:18:18] that the logos or the Son of God went
[1:18:22] out of God now I do not believe in
[1:18:25] Eternal sunship that's even radical to
[1:18:28] even mention such a thing Eternal
[1:18:30] sunship how he had an eternal sunship
[1:18:34] way it's even Eternal how could it be a
[1:18:37] son he had to have a beginning see so we
[1:18:41] he first was god Jehovah and out of him
[1:18:45] let's just picture now as a little drama
[1:18:48] so you can get it let's see coming out
[1:18:51] of space where there's nothing let's
[1:18:54] make it a little white light like a
[1:18:57] Mystic light light like a Halo and that
[1:19:01] was the logos that went out of God in
[1:19:03] the beginning that was the son of God
[1:19:06] that came out of the bosom of the father
[1:19:08] that was was that was what was in the
[1:19:11] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:19:15] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:19:18] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:19:21] in the beginning was God and then out of
[1:19:24] God came the logos a part of God that
[1:19:27] went out of god let's notice this now I
[1:19:31] have to make this before going back into
[1:19:34] just a little picture drama here for you
[1:19:36] a moment in order to get one point to
[1:19:39] you what is in our midst
[1:19:43] tonight and in there now see this is
[1:19:46] just like a child playing before the
[1:19:48] door it was the Son of God the
[1:19:52] logos and I can see him out there and he
[1:19:54] spake and said let there be light there
[1:19:57] was nothing but there was something
[1:19:59] happened and an Adam turned there and
[1:20:02] begin to whirl around this way the sun
[1:20:05] begin to come into existence because he
[1:20:08] said let there be there's the
[1:20:12] authority where did he make it from I
[1:20:16] don't know there was nothing to make it
[1:20:17] from but he believed his own word and
[1:20:21] there was light I can see a peace fly
[1:20:24] off of that it's a meteor after a few
[1:20:28] million years or hundred billions of
[1:20:30] years if you call it it's circled way
[1:20:33] out I see him standing there watching it
[1:20:36] it falls down here he stops it after it
[1:20:40] falls a few million years lets it hang
[1:20:43] over there in orbit here goes another
[1:20:45] one flying off the sun it goes over here
[1:20:49] and hangs down stops it there what's he
[1:20:52] doing riding his first first
[1:20:55] Bible notice notice the human beings
[1:20:59] once look towards the heavens and he
[1:21:02] puts all the stars in the heavens the
[1:21:05] Zodiac starting off with the Virgin
[1:21:07] ending up with Leo the Lion first coming
[1:21:09] of Christ Second Coming came by the
[1:21:12] Virgin come again as the lion of the
[1:21:14] tribe of Judah there he puts the first
[1:21:22] Bible oh my
[1:21:25] amen oh back in those days of the
[1:21:27] ancient days they looked at those things
[1:21:30] today we got his Bible wrote here but he
[1:21:33] wrote it in the heavens that man would
[1:21:36] look up and realize that Jehovah the
[1:21:39] Creator lived above and then I can see
[1:21:42] him he looked I can see him speak to
[1:21:45] this world hanging there as a icicle
[1:21:48] whatever it was way away and he moved
[1:21:51] over here I can see This little light go
[1:21:54] out
[1:21:55] now we got two now the
[1:21:57] father and out of the father came the
[1:22:00] light the son and I can see the light
[1:22:03] moving over here and pull the O Earth
[1:22:07] over near the sun to dry it off and he
[1:22:09] begin to raised the water up separating
[1:22:12] the land Earth from the water and so
[1:22:15] forth then he began to create he made
[1:22:18] the fishes of the sea the vegetable life
[1:22:21] he put the cattles on the hill it all
[1:22:23] looked good to him then he said let us
[1:22:26] make man in our own image after our
[1:22:29] likeness is that right all right so he
[1:22:32] made a man God was Spirit he had to be a
[1:22:36] spirit Man Made In His Image he put him
[1:22:39] here on the earth to lead the animal
[1:22:41] life and so forth like the Holy Spirit
[1:22:44] should be leading the church today that
[1:22:48] was man then when he put him there's no
[1:22:51] man to till the soil so he put him in
[1:22:54] five sense is there there's where
[1:22:56] scientists they're fearful mixed up he
[1:22:59] might have give them a hand like a
[1:23:01] monkey foot like a bear put whatever he
[1:23:03] wanted to but he put his spirit in him
[1:23:07] and made him a soul there's the
[1:23:09] difference we're not coming from an
[1:23:11] animal life no sir we're not any senses
[1:23:14] of animal life God made us that's right
[1:23:17] then however brother B drops to
[1:23:20] paragraph number 20 and then we're going
[1:23:22] to make this second man the first man
[1:23:26] you can't see him God the second man was
[1:23:30] a Halo now he takes a third man and
[1:23:34] makes him like a little white cloud
[1:23:37] coming over we can see him Holy Spirit
[1:23:40] coming down he's all man that's the soul
[1:23:45] of man Eternal then and after this man
[1:23:49] sin he marred the soul uh Blackness
[1:23:52] Darkness come into him and then God came
[1:23:54] down and lived in man suffered with man
[1:23:57] to redeem man and the Holy Spirit comes
[1:23:59] in man and drives that Blackness and sin
[1:24:02] away from him and brings him back into
[1:24:05] perfect Fellowship a part of God now we
[1:24:08] by the blood of Christ who cleanses us
[1:24:11] from sin we become Sons and Daughters of
[1:24:15] God who is God the one that stood there
[1:24:18] and roll the Stars off of his hands Rose
[1:24:21] worlds out of his hands and made things
[1:24:24] which do not appear deity deity himself
[1:24:29] lives in man the Creator made heavens
[1:24:33] and earth lives in
[1:24:36] mankind the Bible says we are Sons and
[1:24:39] Daughters of God so here you know
[1:24:42] brother banam is saying that these are
[1:24:46] all men the first man you couldn't see
[1:24:49] him called God the second man you can
[1:24:53] see him little white Halo the third man
[1:24:57] was the spirit that was leading the
[1:24:59] animal kingdom but they're all three men
[1:25:02] as he calls them and uh that's beautiful
[1:25:05] when you read that because it takes you
[1:25:07] back further than just your Earthly
[1:25:11] Journey here and the Bible is the one
[1:25:15] that reveals to you far beyond just your
[1:25:18] Earthly journey journey uh uh um your
[1:25:21] Earthly Journey here Adam
[1:25:24] was uh before he was a man like you
[1:25:27] could see in flesh here he was a spirit
[1:25:30] being and he was in the image of God and
[1:25:34] in that image he had all authority and
[1:25:38] God had given him that and not only was
[1:25:41] he in the image of God and God was in
[1:25:45] was ma had made him in his own likeness
[1:25:48] he gave this man the same Authority that
[1:25:52] he had God's Authority he gives it to
[1:25:56] man over all of
[1:25:58] creation now this is what Adam lost this
[1:26:02] is what he forfeited and this is what
[1:26:05] needs to be redeemed back to the
[1:26:07] believer in this day in this hour we uh
[1:26:12] we find out what our rights were through
[1:26:14] the word of God the word of God shows us
[1:26:17] what our Origins are what our beginnings
[1:26:20] are now what I just read to you was a
[1:26:23] Vindicated Prophet going back a billion
[1:26:26] plus another 100 billion years before uh
[1:26:30] creation started and science all they
[1:26:32] can go back is look into the history of
[1:26:35] Bones and calculate rocks and matter and
[1:26:38] they they do what they do and they come
[1:26:40] up with their creation uh theories and
[1:26:44] but the really the only one that knows
[1:26:45] what happened was God himself and he
[1:26:48] reveals that and so as a man comes to
[1:26:52] Christ his origin his understanding of
[1:26:55] who he is will only be made known as he
[1:26:58] develops a relationship with the book
[1:27:00] here The Book of Life is the revelation
[1:27:04] of the book of your life it opens up the
[1:27:09] origin of you it doesn't just reveal
[1:27:13] it's nice to know that Daniel who he was
[1:27:16] and Moses and who he was and all of the
[1:27:20] great prophets and who they were but you
[1:27:22] have to know who you are and the word of
[1:27:26] God reveals that to us doesn't it and we
[1:27:30] know that this Satan tries to pervert
[1:27:35] that original word uh to the believer
[1:27:38] this is what he does he first tries to
[1:27:41] get you to move ahead of God and to do
[1:27:45] something prematurely and then he also
[1:27:48] wants you to stay in the back and fail
[1:27:51] to move forward once he reveals his will
[1:27:54] to you there is a danger in not moving
[1:27:59] forward there is a time element there
[1:28:02] you see when the Jubilee year sounded
[1:28:06] that was specific everybody knew it this
[1:28:10] is the seventh year and the way they
[1:28:13] would it would be identified is by the
[1:28:15] priests coming through and blowing the
[1:28:19] horns the silver horns the trumpets and
[1:28:23] these trumpets
[1:28:24] were were blown at length and they
[1:28:28] denoted a specific happening a specific
[1:28:32] time this was the year of release this
[1:28:36] was time you know after seven years or
[1:28:38] let's say even 49 years you can quickly
[1:28:42] and very easily get used to uh living
[1:28:44] your living condition seven years is a
[1:28:47] bit of time if you think of it you know
[1:28:50] and and one of the laws in that is if
[1:28:53] this man was taken in and he was married
[1:28:57] then the year of release he can go out
[1:29:00] with his wife but if this man came in
[1:29:03] single and his master provides a wife to
[1:29:07] him and then he has children with that
[1:29:10] wife at the year of release he can go
[1:29:13] out but his family would have to stay
[1:29:16] and so it was a decision that he would
[1:29:18] have to make as to whether you got to
[1:29:20] watch who you marryed now as to as to
[1:29:23] whether you going to stay with the
[1:29:25] master with your family you can you say
[1:29:28] arguably year one he's married year two
[1:29:31] he has one two three you can have six
[1:29:33] kids in this seven-year period and now
[1:29:37] the trumpet is blowing and young man you
[1:29:40] have to make a decision are you going to
[1:29:42] go free or are you going to stay with
[1:29:44] your family well I kind of need another
[1:29:47] year to think about it no that was last
[1:29:49] year thinking about it was last year
[1:29:52] today is the day that a decision has to
[1:29:56] be made and we all know that as
[1:29:58] Believers there's times that we meet
[1:30:01] these cross rolls in our life that we
[1:30:04] have to make a decision when you hear
[1:30:08] his voice Harden not your heart today is
[1:30:13] the day of salvation you say brother
[1:30:16] Israel when do I make a move on the
[1:30:17] Revelation you make a move when it's
[1:30:20] revealed to you when the Revelation
[1:30:23] comes that's time that means it's let's
[1:30:26] go and what's the Revelation the
[1:30:29] Revelation is the sounding of the
[1:30:30] trumpet it's called the year of release
[1:30:34] the Year of Jubilee so there is a danger
[1:30:39] zone and waiting too long and there was
[1:30:42] a danger zone and moving too quickly
[1:30:45] let's take this moving too quickly just
[1:30:48] for a moment I think we spoke on it a
[1:30:50] couple of Sunday
[1:30:51] evenings um talking about Eve getting
[1:30:55] ahead of God she couldn't wait brother
[1:31:00] vam says it here in the message spoken
[1:31:03] word is the Original
[1:31:05] Seed he says this
[1:31:09] here in paragraph number
[1:31:15] 52 or
[1:31:17] 178 I apologize it's always a little
[1:31:20] different in our system in the back
[1:31:22] there says they could not hold it for
[1:31:25] that past the 50th day cuz that was the
[1:31:29] day of Jubilee when everything went back
[1:31:31] to its original beginning the power of
[1:31:33] God was taken back to his original the
[1:31:36] 50th day the Year of Jubilee when all
[1:31:39] things went back now there will come
[1:31:42] another Year of Jubilee and and and
[1:31:46] we've had it just about this time if you
[1:31:48] notice Pentecost has been falling in
[1:31:52] America for about 50 years somewhere on
[1:31:55] that time just about 50 years ago
[1:31:58] Pentecost Begin to Fall now what's
[1:32:01] happening the church is receiving the
[1:32:04] seven seal Book of Revelation of Jesus
[1:32:07] Christ of the Seven Seals and not one
[1:32:10] tenth of them can receive it my but when
[1:32:14] you begin to see the Year of Jubilee
[1:32:16] where we don't have to fuss and strain
[1:32:18] and pull like this but we've already
[1:32:21] secured in Christ we already had have
[1:32:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:32:26] baptism we have all of these great
[1:32:28] Mysteries that we're going to bring up
[1:32:30] in these Seven Seals and prove to you
[1:32:33] that them was seals that they were
[1:32:35] sealed from the eyes of the people of
[1:32:39] God being my helper I'll prove to you
[1:32:41] that they could not that that by the
[1:32:44] Bible then sure if the Bible said so
[1:32:47] you'll believe it that they could not
[1:32:49] see nothing but Father Son and Holy
[1:32:52] Ghost until
[1:32:54] this time they could not see that there
[1:32:57] was no eternal hell until this time they
[1:33:02] could not see that there was an eternal
[1:33:03] security uh I mean for the real believer
[1:33:06] of course there's been a mock of of it
[1:33:09] all the way around an uncertain sound
[1:33:12] they give that's the
[1:33:14] reason uh the people they say why look
[1:33:17] at the Presbyterians so forth they smoke
[1:33:19] and drink so I'm sorry that was in the
[1:33:21] message Revelations chap 5 part two but
[1:33:24] brother Bram is saying there that this
[1:33:26] Jubilee year the sounding and the
[1:33:29] revelation of the word couldn't come
[1:33:31] until this particular time and so what
[1:33:35] time is that that's the time that we're
[1:33:37] in now that's the preaching forth of the
[1:33:40] message the the the revelation of the
[1:33:42] seven sealed book well this is the book
[1:33:45] that was sealed with Seven Seals it was
[1:33:49] sealed by Mysteries it was sealed some
[1:33:53] like we stood some we didn't but when
[1:33:56] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:33:58] angel shall begin to sound the mysteries
[1:34:02] of this book should be revealed the
[1:34:06] seventh Angel's Ministry is to reveal
[1:34:09] the Mysteries that surround the book
[1:34:11] that's how we know how to baptize Angel
[1:34:14] today it's because the Mysteries have
[1:34:16] been revealed we know what hell is like
[1:34:18] we even know what it looks like beyond
[1:34:19] the curtain of time because the seven
[1:34:22] sealed Ministry
[1:34:24] has brought that to us now
[1:34:27] Eve she she couldn't
[1:34:31] wait she had to move forward in um
[1:34:36] making the word do something that she
[1:34:40] believed would be the right order Satan
[1:34:43] told her do this it's time do it like
[1:34:47] this and she listened to it you'll be
[1:34:50] wise um you you you know the Lord knows
[1:34:54] that you'll be like a god you have a
[1:34:57] great anointing come over you and she
[1:34:59] should have just waited because it was
[1:35:01] going to happen and there was a great
[1:35:03] mystery coming forward but she could she
[1:35:06] couldn't wait Satan got in there and got
[1:35:08] her to move ahead of God and that's what
[1:35:11] people do many times they'll come to the
[1:35:13] Lord and they know they should receive
[1:35:15] the Holy Ghost and so they'll make
[1:35:18] themselves like speak in tongues or do
[1:35:20] something and it's not even genuine and
[1:35:23] you don't have to manufacture anything
[1:35:26] the Lord will do it the one who called
[1:35:29] you he'll do it if he wants you to do
[1:35:32] whatever you got to do he'll let you
[1:35:34] know that amen but the enemy always
[1:35:37] trying to push someone I've had it as as
[1:35:39] a young Minister I didn't know what it
[1:35:41] was then but as a young Minister you're
[1:35:43] tempted to see deeper things because you
[1:35:46] hear others preaching deeper things so
[1:35:49] you get up and you want to jump and
[1:35:51] preach something deeper and it really do
[1:35:53] that's not even you you're not even
[1:35:55] living there preach where you're living
[1:35:58] preach what God showed you it there
[1:36:01] nothing to be ashamed about
[1:36:04] that you don't know the Thunders you
[1:36:06] don't know
[1:36:07] them and so that temptation is there as
[1:36:10] a Ministry is there I'm telling you as a
[1:36:13] as a as you know as a personal witness
[1:36:15] that temptation is there to get on
[1:36:17] subjects and preach on things that God
[1:36:20] hasn't thoroughly settled it in your
[1:36:22] heart yet you don't have to say Amen
[1:36:24] there something that you don't
[1:36:25] understand God's not forcing you to to
[1:36:29] see something that he didn't show you
[1:36:31] how crazy is that how is God going to
[1:36:33] force you to see something that he has
[1:36:36] to show you if he shows you he don't
[1:36:39] have to force
[1:36:40] you can I get a witness but then when he
[1:36:44] shows you you don't have to wait for
[1:36:46] everybody else to say Amen
[1:36:48] either amen you run with it don't you
[1:36:52] I'm out of here
[1:36:54] I'm going to the ark hey wait brother
[1:36:56] wait wait you want think about it time
[1:36:57] no I ain't thinking about nothing
[1:36:59] talking about nothing I'm getting in the
[1:37:00] ark cuz it's about to rain when that
[1:37:04] Revelation strikes if you're a
[1:37:07] giraffe you're going to get in Noah's
[1:37:09] Ark when it strikes all the other ones
[1:37:11] out there eating this other one doing
[1:37:13] this over there but you're going to move
[1:37:15] when the Revelation strikes you and you
[1:37:18] don't have to make that happen so moving
[1:37:21] forward going ahead head of God is a
[1:37:25] danger now there is also a danger in
[1:37:29] waiting
[1:37:31] behind you know when the Jubilee year
[1:37:35] trumpet begin to blow into sound you
[1:37:38] know it's interesting that the Lord made
[1:37:40] it so it's kind of drastic it's kind of
[1:37:43] you know it's really critical it was a
[1:37:46] hard um like time or decision it's like
[1:37:50] okay you're in bondage for seven years
[1:37:52] all right six years this is the seventh
[1:37:54] year now is your opportunity to be set
[1:37:58] free okay I understand that be set free
[1:38:01] okay so so if I leave now I'm free I
[1:38:04] don't owe nothing you don't owe nothing
[1:38:06] you start over it's a complete
[1:38:10] reset okay let me think about that okay
[1:38:12] all right internalize that if I leave
[1:38:15] now I'll be free completely free I don't
[1:38:18] owe anything no strings attached you
[1:38:20] don't owe anything in fact your Master
[1:38:23] will give you a little something to to
[1:38:25] get you going okay what happens if I
[1:38:28] don't
[1:38:29] go well if you don't
[1:38:33] go you will bring you to the all altar
[1:38:37] to the to the post of the priest of of
[1:38:40] of the Tabernacle and we'll take this
[1:38:43] sharp
[1:38:44] all a tool and we're going to bore that
[1:38:48] through your
[1:38:50] ear your master has to do it in front of
[1:38:53] the priest
[1:38:54] bore it through your ear and from that
[1:38:57] day on you you really like it here if
[1:38:59] you really like it here this is your
[1:39:01] only opportunity you will never hear the
[1:39:04] sound of the trumpet again or you'll
[1:39:07] hear it but it'll never be like this
[1:39:09] time so it's a it's a real it's a
[1:39:12] decision time it's like if I don't do it
[1:39:15] if I don't do it I get to stay and boss
[1:39:18] has kind of been good to me and I got
[1:39:20] kids and I'm and I got comfortable I got
[1:39:22] used to it he we understand each other
[1:39:24] okay if you want to live like that this
[1:39:27] is what you got to do go to the priest
[1:39:30] bring all the witnesses and will bore
[1:39:32] you in your ear and you'll never go
[1:39:36] free
[1:39:39] right that's pretty
[1:39:42] strong what I believe the Lord is
[1:39:44] establishing here that every man was
[1:39:49] made to be
[1:39:51] free you made that
[1:39:54] way it's inherit it's inside of you to
[1:39:58] be God made men men make
[1:40:04] slaves and some people give up their
[1:40:07] freedom because they feel protection
[1:40:11] under some master or under some
[1:40:12] organization or denomination know some
[1:40:15] Pastor some ministers they link up with
[1:40:19] people because there's a protection in
[1:40:21] knowing that I got some boys that can
[1:40:23] can support my Revelation but can I am I
[1:40:26] willing to stand out there when nobody
[1:40:28] else can see what you
[1:40:31] see there's a freedom that comes with
[1:40:35] that but it's also a price too now you
[1:40:38] got to go to work you got to save your
[1:40:41] money you got to watch the weather
[1:40:43] you're not asking the boss what we doing
[1:40:45] today we're going to ask you what we
[1:40:47] doing today your boss will tell you what
[1:40:49] to eat now you got to tell you what to
[1:40:52] eat
[1:40:54] big difference isn't it it's amazing how
[1:40:57] people they got it all figured out until
[1:40:59] they're the
[1:41:00] boss
[1:41:02] mhm yes they know all how they would do
[1:41:06] it how they would run it until it's in
[1:41:08] their
[1:41:09] charge we was uh talking about oh I
[1:41:13] don't want to get sidetracked but let me
[1:41:15] let me be I'm at home right we we had
[1:41:18] this Union Gospel Mission there in
[1:41:20] Sacramento Brother Gary Silva started it
[1:41:23] and we would go once a year or or we did
[1:41:25] that for a year and so what did we do
[1:41:28] the way it was set up that these these
[1:41:30] folks at the mission couldn't eat until
[1:41:33] after they heard the preaching so and
[1:41:36] these different groups would come and
[1:41:37] they liked us and they let us put the
[1:41:39] prophets books out there and people
[1:41:41] would come and take it and so you come
[1:41:43] and you'd be preaching to this crowd
[1:41:45] brother John that doesn't look like this
[1:41:47] here it's a very different crowd and
[1:41:51] people with their arms folded
[1:41:53] some of them upset some trying to sleep
[1:41:56] some waiting for you to say let's all
[1:41:59] close so they can get something to eat
[1:42:02] the kitchen is right next door by the
[1:42:03] way you can hear whatever you smell
[1:42:05] whatever they're cooking and I you the
[1:42:07] preachers up here preaching and they
[1:42:08] like okay get to the point
[1:42:10] man and there is no amen crows there is
[1:42:13] no so but that you know that was really
[1:42:16] good for me brother bons really
[1:42:18] developed me to you know to stop looking
[1:42:20] at people in the eyes and when they roll
[1:42:22] their eyes at you so when you do it
[1:42:24] today it hurts a little bit but I'm like
[1:42:26] man it's been a lot worse for me so most
[1:42:30] of y'all do real good all right but this
[1:42:33] was a this was a tough crowd and so
[1:42:35] there was a brother in the church too
[1:42:39] there was one brother is an EV an
[1:42:41] evangelist and many of you know him so I
[1:42:43] won't go too far some of you know him
[1:42:46] real strong evangelist uh gentleman he
[1:42:48] came through the city Fireball of the
[1:42:52] preacher they took him and put him up
[1:42:54] into that platform brother
[1:42:56] Joe and it shocked him he couldn't
[1:43:00] preach it numbed
[1:43:02] him because when you're always preaching
[1:43:05] to folks who are friendly and nice and
[1:43:07] Christian that's kind of easy to do not
[1:43:10] easy no don't let me discredit it's not
[1:43:12] easy but it's
[1:43:14] easier then the house these big grown
[1:43:17] healthy men looking at you
[1:43:20] crosseyed a a and worldly people look
[1:43:22] like they can just come up and get you
[1:43:24] people look like they just got out of
[1:43:26] somewhere or on their way to
[1:43:29] somewhere and it shocked him I forgot
[1:43:32] all about that Gary reminded me of that
[1:43:34] we laughed and then there was another
[1:43:36] young brother in the church that really
[1:43:37] felt like he had a call to preach he was
[1:43:40] kind of a deacon and they put him up
[1:43:42] there and and this scared him straight
[1:43:47] he got up and try to preach to these
[1:43:49] people and after
[1:43:51] that no more he never tried it again
[1:43:55] like he just ran from it and so it's
[1:43:59] something how those little experiences
[1:44:01] will will show and and develop you um as
[1:44:05] to why was I talking about that well
[1:44:08] that's just my own taste yeah who knows
[1:44:11] the Lord knows but you see this this
[1:44:15] this this year of release there was a
[1:44:17] time window there and once that that
[1:44:20] that time window was granted to you or
[1:44:23] given to you then yes you can go free
[1:44:27] it's very strong it's very drastic it's
[1:44:30] very hard and what I was saying was it
[1:44:32] it looks easier than perhaps you
[1:44:35] realize it looks easy to get up and
[1:44:39] preach or to lead or to be a boss or be
[1:44:41] in charge or something but then when
[1:44:44] that responsibility is placed to you you
[1:44:47] have to you know for for many of us and
[1:44:49] I've understood this over the last two
[1:44:51] years in particular many of us can't
[1:44:55] understand why certain people will live
[1:44:57] under a false Doctrine for many many
[1:45:00] years and you say you know here the
[1:45:03] brother brandham says it right there why
[1:45:05] won't they make a
[1:45:06] move well it takes a lot of
[1:45:09] courage to leave from what you were
[1:45:13] doing for for so many years we're on
[1:45:17] this side of it takes a lot of courage
[1:45:19] to interrupt a a a a meal plan that is
[1:45:23] always going to be there a schedule a
[1:45:27] boss carrying over you and now you got
[1:45:30] to you got to go make it work yourself
[1:45:33] now now you know in that case you can
[1:45:36] always got somebody to
[1:45:39] blame but when but when you've been set
[1:45:41] free and you still ain't getting it
[1:45:43] together you can't blame nobody now so
[1:45:47] it's so easy when you you need to this
[1:45:50] is what empathy is you need to change
[1:45:52] roles sometime that's
[1:45:55] good switch seats just for a moment and
[1:45:59] see if you can handle the
[1:46:01] pressure
[1:46:02] huh yes and so this was a challenge if
[1:46:06] the Lord put it in there and he made it
[1:46:08] a challenge like if you don't get this
[1:46:10] right then not in the next seven years
[1:46:13] you'll get another opportunity no this
[1:46:15] is for
[1:46:16] life if you want to stay here you're
[1:46:18] going to stay here for the rest of your
[1:46:21] life but but if you want to be free you
[1:46:25] can be free for the rest of your
[1:46:27] life isn't that
[1:46:30] beautiful it really takes courage to
[1:46:32] serve the
[1:46:34] Lord it really takes courage to see
[1:46:38] something that God will show you from
[1:46:41] his word and then you go act upon
[1:46:44] it because you have people your friends
[1:46:48] and people around you that are going to
[1:46:51] see your new behavior and you got to be
[1:46:54] able to explain
[1:46:55] yourself and so this year of
[1:46:59] release was the year that it came so in
[1:47:03] this Jubilee brother brandom explains it
[1:47:05] very well many places throughout the
[1:47:10] message and we'll take this one here in
[1:47:13] the message the second seal paragraph
[1:47:15] number 214 in the Old Testament when a
[1:47:19] man had been sold to slavery there come
[1:47:22] a year of Jubilee every 50 years 49th
[1:47:26] year and then the Year of Jubilee and
[1:47:28] when the slave heard this and he wanted
[1:47:30] to go free there isn't nothing can keep
[1:47:34] him from going free he can throw down
[1:47:37] his hoe and say so long go back home the
[1:47:41] trumpet sounded that's right but if he
[1:47:43] didn't want to go and he was satisfied
[1:47:46] with the slave master then he was taken
[1:47:48] into the temple and they take an all you
[1:47:52] know what an all is is they press his
[1:47:54] ear and put a hole in his ear and it's a
[1:47:57] Mark that he can never go back is that
[1:48:00] right he has to serve this master for
[1:48:03] all times I don't care how many more
[1:48:06] times the Jubilee sounds whatever
[1:48:08] happens he absolutely has sold out his
[1:48:13] birth rights of being
[1:48:16] free and when a man turns down the
[1:48:18] gospel truth Satan marks him
[1:48:23] where at his
[1:48:25] ear he deafens him so he can't hear the
[1:48:29] truth no more and he's finished he stays
[1:48:33] with the group that he's with if he
[1:48:37] won't hear the
[1:48:38] truth there's a lot of people in church
[1:48:41] today that have this Mark on them
[1:48:44] there's a lot of people following around
[1:48:46] claiming they're in the word or in the
[1:48:48] message and they have this Mark on them
[1:48:50] how you know they got the mark on them
[1:48:52] cuz when you show them the word it means
[1:48:53] absolutely nothing to them they can't
[1:48:56] hear nothing else no matter what you
[1:48:59] tell them no matter what you show them
[1:49:01] they're not going to change and if the
[1:49:03] word of God won't change them then then
[1:49:07] then they're deaf
[1:49:09] spiritually very sad position to find
[1:49:12] yourself in I think a True Believer
[1:49:15] should always be humble enough to say
[1:49:17] you know what I don't know it all right
[1:49:20] and there might be something I'm missing
[1:49:21] on this truth
[1:49:23] Lord if there's something in here that
[1:49:25] you have for me your word will declare
[1:49:27] it and if the word produces the
[1:49:30] quotations then you need to
[1:49:32] change right I believe that's a true
[1:49:35] Ministry I think that's a True Believer
[1:49:38] we seen it in the prophets life in the
[1:49:40] prophets of the Bible that when truth or
[1:49:43] greater light comes to them they walk
[1:49:46] with that truth amen because we know
[1:49:50] that to be deaf
[1:49:53] spiritually is um you can't grow you
[1:49:57] can't go any further with God if you
[1:49:59] can't hear him speak and if you stop
[1:50:01] where he has uh was trying to take you
[1:50:04] to then you're you're just stuck a lot
[1:50:06] of Christians are stuck right here they
[1:50:09] know some scriptures they know some
[1:50:10] quotes but they're not going on any
[1:50:12] further paragraph 223 he says don't take
[1:50:17] Satan's unbelieving Mark he'll put it on
[1:50:21] you tonight if he can do it
[1:50:23] he'll poke you up against the wall and
[1:50:25] you walk out and say I don't know about
[1:50:28] that look at what he says paragraph 224
[1:50:31] many message people don't do this you go
[1:50:33] home and study
[1:50:34] it and then be sincere and then
[1:50:38] what well what we need to pray for I'm
[1:50:41] predestinated if you're predestinated
[1:50:44] you're predestinated to
[1:50:48] pray I'm predestinated what do I need to
[1:50:51] study for if God's going to show show it
[1:50:52] to me he okay so he he goes
[1:50:55] painstakingly goes through all the
[1:50:57] effort to give you this Bible here but
[1:50:59] you're not supposed to read it what
[1:51:01] about the seven seal book
[1:51:05] huh he reveals that to us but we're not
[1:51:08] supposed to read
[1:51:09] it and this attitude you've seen it
[1:51:12] amongst people because they know that
[1:51:14] there there are quotes where it talks
[1:51:16] about you know don't take your own
[1:51:18] thought just live a simple Christian
[1:51:20] Life and then but the Bible says to
[1:51:22] study to show yourself
[1:51:25] approved you're not we're not in a race
[1:51:28] here to see who who learn more than the
[1:51:30] next person you're here to learn more
[1:51:33] from him
[1:51:35] personally and if there's anything in
[1:51:37] our life that we can learn more
[1:51:40] personally from him he'll give that to
[1:51:42] you that's available to all of
[1:51:45] us amen so brother randam says take it
[1:51:48] home you go home and study it then be
[1:51:50] sincere and pray cuz everything is too
[1:51:54] too perfectly scriptural at this very
[1:51:57] hour this sacred hour in time it's done
[1:52:01] been for years prove come right up to it
[1:52:05] and this is the hour this is the time
[1:52:09] and now don't let him poke that in your
[1:52:11] ear his unbelieving Mark cuz we he was
[1:52:16] an unbeliever to begin with he was he
[1:52:19] doubted it all right oh don't let him
[1:52:22] take that scripture with his wisdom and
[1:52:24] twist it and pervert it with his own
[1:52:26] wisdom into reasoning Powers you just be
[1:52:29] humble and say God said so that's all
[1:52:32] there is to it
[1:52:35] amen all right here what the prophet of
[1:52:38] God says it paragraph
[1:52:40] 291 in the message 10 virgins and
[1:52:45] 144,000 amen how many love the Lord this
[1:52:47] morning amen now there come a time that
[1:52:51] was called
[1:52:53] every seventh year that was six years on
[1:52:56] the seventh Year Bible students
[1:52:59] ministers and things setting around here
[1:53:01] knows this to be true it was called the
[1:53:04] seventh year was called the Jubilee year
[1:53:07] everything rested there's no crops
[1:53:09] planted on the seventh year the land
[1:53:12] rested everything they just gleaned see
[1:53:16] everything rested on the seventh year
[1:53:18] and on the seventh year there was a
[1:53:20] priest that sounded a trumpet
[1:53:23] and if a man had been a slave I don't
[1:53:25] care what his debts was he was free now
[1:53:30] that's a type of the Gospel trumpet you
[1:53:33] might have served the devil all these
[1:53:35] years in Chains with drinking smoking
[1:53:38] gambling sin dirty things no matter what
[1:53:42] you've done but when you hear the gospel
[1:53:44] trumpet sound it's a sign that you can
[1:53:48] go free you can go faith cometh by
[1:53:54] hearing hearing of the word of God now
[1:53:58] you've heard the Full Gospel you don't
[1:54:01] have to stay bound any
[1:54:03] longer how many can receive that this
[1:54:06] morning Faith cometh by hearing yes sir
[1:54:09] hearing
[1:54:11] what hearing the
[1:54:13] news hearing what the past was hear what
[1:54:17] everybody else is saying Faith cometh by
[1:54:20] hearing and hear in comes by the word of
[1:54:23] God when you hear the gospel trumpet
[1:54:26] sound it tells you you can go
[1:54:29] free it tells you that you're a Believer
[1:54:32] it tells you what your name is it
[1:54:35] actually gives you
[1:54:38] instructions and in the instructions
[1:54:41] there's
[1:54:42] correction and with the correction
[1:54:44] there's
[1:54:45] protection that's 2 Timothy 3: 6 16 that
[1:54:51] the word of God was given so that the
[1:54:54] man can be fully furnished he'll be
[1:54:57] corrected instructions that he can be uh
[1:55:00] foolproof basically that's what the word
[1:55:03] of God is it's
[1:55:04] instructions and in those instructions
[1:55:07] there is correction let's take that word
[1:55:11] correction just for a moment it's
[1:55:13] correct don't you want to be right so
[1:55:16] you get corrected so you can walk on a
[1:55:20] correct path and that that is is the
[1:55:22] road that we are walking on this gospel
[1:55:25] truth is the correct road that's what it
[1:55:29] is it's the correct road and it is
[1:55:34] corrective that same word comes from
[1:55:36] there correct and this is what will
[1:55:39] correct your life is the word of God it
[1:55:42] is instructions and in those
[1:55:44] instructions are Corrections like daily
[1:55:49] Corrections Pride doesn't want to be
[1:55:52] corrected you think you know the answer
[1:55:55] but you don't know the answer yet you
[1:55:58] think you Haven it figured out but who
[1:56:00] does have it we don't have it figured
[1:56:02] out this is why we stay in the word
[1:56:04] because the word instructs us and in
[1:56:07] those instructions are Corrections and
[1:56:10] then when we're instructed right and
[1:56:12] we're corrected right then we will be
[1:56:15] protected right that's right your
[1:56:19] protection ain't you uh developing a way
[1:56:22] to to sense danger your protection ain't
[1:56:25] you protecting yourself your protection
[1:56:27] is the word of God that protects a
[1:56:31] Ministry that protects a family that
[1:56:34] protects a covenant that protects any
[1:56:37] man or woman that's on the correct way
[1:56:40] is when they stay with the word amen
[1:56:43] let's take that scripture just for a
[1:56:45] moment what did I call Second Timothy
[1:56:51] 3 how many young people will in here
[1:56:53] this
[1:56:54] morning let me see your hands all the
[1:56:56] young
[1:56:58] people now some of you thank you brother
[1:57:00] Chris I like that Chris raised his hand
[1:57:03] see that's on you if you want to be old
[1:57:07] that's on you I am a young person now
[1:57:11] how many young people here this morning
[1:57:13] oh y some some of y'all still want to be
[1:57:15] old go
[1:57:19] on age is just a number
[1:57:24] second Timothy chapter 3 verse number 16
[1:57:28] says this all scripture can we read that
[1:57:31] as a class all together read it
[1:57:34] forcefully all scripture is given by
[1:57:38] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:57:42] Doctrine for reproof for correction for
[1:57:47] instruction and righteousness why why
[1:57:51] that the man of God may be
[1:57:54] what
[1:57:56] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:58:00] good works that's what the word of God
[1:58:03] does for a Believer it corrects you it
[1:58:06] instructs you it reproves you that you
[1:58:09] can be perfect and thoroughly
[1:58:12] furnac in
[1:58:15] righteousness
[1:58:17] now Satan knows this so he's got to
[1:58:21] discredit the word in your midst the
[1:58:24] word of your day and what he does he
[1:58:27] tells you to
[1:58:29] wait put it off don't do it
[1:58:33] now you know I'm looking at this some of
[1:58:36] the reports on this Eclipse that's
[1:58:38] supposed to happen
[1:58:40] tomorrow and it's a real
[1:58:42] deal the science can see it they nailed
[1:58:46] the time when it's supposed to happen
[1:58:49] it's not a joke I don't think I think
[1:58:51] it's quite quite serious you remember
[1:58:53] the blood moons a few years
[1:58:55] ago remember in brother R's Ministry he
[1:58:58] talked about the
[1:58:59] blackouts there was times there was
[1:59:02] blackouts the entire nation going on and
[1:59:04] he he would equate those to spiritual
[1:59:07] things happening you know droughts and
[1:59:10] diseases and famines those are all signs
[1:59:13] that Jesus said in Matthew 24 he said
[1:59:16] there will be signs in the heaven
[1:59:18] pestilence famines
[1:59:20] Wars rumors of Wars the love of many
[1:59:24] with wax cold how more hateful can we
[1:59:27] get publicly they're so
[1:59:30] hateful there's mean people out there
[1:59:32] they'll shoot you for no reason they'll
[1:59:34] shoot you over a traffic
[1:59:37] infraction just hateful the Bible said
[1:59:40] it would be that way so we as Believers
[1:59:43] you know it's a real happening they you
[1:59:46] look at this um this Eclipse that's
[1:59:49] supposed to take place you know the the
[1:59:51] last one was was s years ago 2017 and
[1:59:54] this one's going to cross his axis right
[1:59:56] on the point there brother Joel Jensen
[1:59:58] sent me a nice article on it it was very
[2:00:01] good and sister Margie oampo sent
[2:00:03] something and the internet is full of
[2:00:05] stuff and and then they you know they
[2:00:08] they want to
[2:00:09] predict that's a
[2:00:11] Temptation he's coming he's coming it's
[2:00:14] going and then it's like why do people
[2:00:16] want to predict want to be the first one
[2:00:18] to say
[2:00:20] whatever why why can't we predict what
[2:00:23] he already
[2:00:25] predicted to get ready for the coming of
[2:00:28] the Lord that's the prediction that
[2:00:32] Jesus is coming and you might not even
[2:00:34] see
[2:00:35] tomorrow talking about tomorrow you
[2:00:38] might not even make it
[2:00:40] tomorrow your coming of the Lord might
[2:00:43] be
[2:00:44] tonight so we're not getting ready we
[2:00:47] live ready we live in a ready State of
[2:00:51] Mind because the word of God corrects us
[2:00:55] to live
[2:00:56] ready that we can be perfect and entire
[2:01:00] Lord wanting
[2:01:01] nothing
[2:01:04] amen this
[2:01:07] is this is the time the hour that we
[2:01:09] live in so the word of God opens up to
[2:01:12] us these things I'm going to take 10
[2:01:14] more minutes okay and this that's good
[2:01:18] brother Sean said take 30 minutes when a
[2:01:21] young man man tells you that then I must
[2:01:23] be well no it's not me all
[2:01:26] right thank you brother Sean I'll take a
[2:01:28] few more minutes anyways in the message
[2:01:32] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:01:36] 1948 what a 1965 paragraph 48 what a
[2:01:41] perfect example it is of the Gospel of
[2:01:44] Jesus Christ when it's
[2:01:47] preached the acceptable time and the
[2:01:50] time of Jubilee
[2:01:52] anybody no matter who you are what color
[2:01:56] you are what denomination you belong to
[2:01:59] how it's How how it's far you stooped in
[2:02:03] sin or what's wrong with you you can go
[2:02:06] free when you hear the gospel trumpet
[2:02:10] sound out you are
[2:02:14] free but if you turn your back upon the
[2:02:17] message and refuse to hear it notice you
[2:02:20] were bored in the ear with the awe that
[2:02:23] means to say that you have crossed the
[2:02:25] line between grace and judgment you'll
[2:02:28] never hear the gospel again you'll never
[2:02:31] get any further you must be a slave to
[2:02:34] the system you're in the rest of your
[2:02:37] days if you refuse to hear the
[2:02:40] acceptable year how many would want to
[2:02:42] say this morning
[2:02:44] Lord open my ears to
[2:02:47] hear the word of the
[2:02:50] Lord why don't you to say that with me
[2:02:52] Lord open my
[2:02:54] ears to hear the word of the Lord the
[2:02:57] word of the Lord that's all I'm here to
[2:03:00] hear I like to hear singing I like to
[2:03:02] see you folks but I'm really just here
[2:03:03] to hear the word of the Lord CU When I
[2:03:06] hear the gospel trumpet sound the gospel
[2:03:09] word
[2:03:11] sound the Bible voice sound the sound of
[2:03:15] his voice speak that's a sign that I can
[2:03:18] go free it's a sign that I
[2:03:22] am now living in the
[2:03:25] Jubilee I'm a product of the Jubilee all
[2:03:28] of us are there some folks wanted to run
[2:03:31] and continue on with their slave master
[2:03:33] they wanted two more years in the world
[2:03:36] I'll get right one of these days or one
[2:03:37] of these days but some of us heard the
[2:03:39] gospel son the trumpet sound in our life
[2:03:43] and we went out free gone free and we
[2:03:48] thank God for it it's a choice it's a
[2:03:51] time to choose
[2:03:52] brother bam tells us this year in this
[2:03:56] message here you see it's paragraph
[2:03:59] number
[2:04:00] 37 you have also a
[2:04:02] choice this is choosing another bride I
[2:04:05] believe when you choose this church you
[2:04:07] can choose whether in this church
[2:04:09] whether you'll choose a church that will
[2:04:11] guide you to your Eternal destination
[2:04:13] you can choose a church that has a
[2:04:15] certain Creed that you might think that
[2:04:17] Creed is just what you want or the other
[2:04:20] church has their Creed
[2:04:22] and then there is the word of God you
[2:04:26] have a choice of you have to make the
[2:04:28] choice there's an un rooten law Among Us
[2:04:32] of choosing I believe it was Elijah one
[2:04:35] time upon Mount Caramel after the
[2:04:38] showdown in a great hour of the crisis
[2:04:41] that we're just about to come to right
[2:04:43] now and perhaps it may be to you or I
[2:04:48] tonight that we make this Choice like
[2:04:51] Mount carel experience the Mount Carmel
[2:04:55] experience
[2:04:57] frankly I think it's gone on worldwide
[2:05:00] now but there will soon be a time where
[2:05:03] that you'll have to make a choice and
[2:05:06] you men here your denominational
[2:05:09] churches just believe this that the hour
[2:05:13] is right on you when you're going to
[2:05:15] make a
[2:05:16] choice you're either going to go into
[2:05:18] the World Council of or World Council or
[2:05:22] you're not going to be a denomination
[2:05:24] anymore you're going to have to do that
[2:05:27] and that choice is coming soon and it's
[2:05:30] a dangerous thing to wait till that last
[2:05:33] hour too because you might take on
[2:05:37] something that you could never shake out
[2:05:40] of you know there is a time when you can
[2:05:44] be
[2:05:44] warned then if you step across that line
[2:05:47] of warning then you're already marked on
[2:05:50] the other side branded remember when the
[2:05:54] Jubilee year come and the priest roll
[2:05:57] with his trumpet sounding that every
[2:05:59] slave could go free but if they refused
[2:06:01] to accept their freedom then he had to
[2:06:04] be taken to the temple to a post and an
[2:06:07] all bore him through the ear then he
[2:06:10] served his master always it was put on
[2:06:13] his ear as a type of hearing Faith
[2:06:16] cometh by hearing he heard that trumpet
[2:06:20] but he didn't want to listen to it and
[2:06:22] many time men and women hear the gospel
[2:06:25] truth they see it Vindicated and
[2:06:28] proven truth but yet they don't want to
[2:06:31] hear it there's some other reason
[2:06:33] there's some other choosing but they
[2:06:35] have then then to face up to the truth
[2:06:38] and facts therefore their ears can be
[2:06:41] closed to the gospel they'll never hear
[2:06:44] it again my advice to you when God
[2:06:48] speaks to your heart you act right then
[2:06:52] Elijah gave them a choice which they
[2:06:55] should choose ye this day whom ye shall
[2:06:59] serve God if God be God serve him but if
[2:07:03] B be God served
[2:07:06] him so we have this there's a time there
[2:07:10] where you can wait too
[2:07:12] long you Satan can push you to move
[2:07:14] forward ahead of time and there's a time
[2:07:17] you can wait too long but the hour of
[2:07:20] your deliverance God always reveals that
[2:07:23] to you through his word and we're glad
[2:07:27] for that tonight this morning we're glad
[2:07:30] for that in this evening
[2:07:33] time
[2:07:34] yes this is the time that God has laid
[2:07:37] out for us Hebrews chap 4: 7 let's read
[2:07:42] that quickly today if you hear my
[2:07:49] voice maybe sister can pull it up for me
[2:07:52] Hebrews chapter
[2:07:56] 4 again he limited a certain day saying
[2:08:01] skip up one more let me see what verse
[2:08:03] six says seeing therefore it remain that
[2:08:06] some must enter therein and they to whom
[2:08:09] it was first preached enter not in
[2:08:11] because of unbelief again he limited a
[2:08:15] certain day saying in David today after
[2:08:18] so long time as it is said today if you
[2:08:22] will hear his voice Harden not your
[2:08:26] hearts for if Jesus had given them rest
[2:08:29] they would have not afterwards have
[2:08:30] spoken of another day so today is the
[2:08:34] day that we react to the word when do
[2:08:38] you react to the word you react to the
[2:08:40] word when you hear it and I'm not
[2:08:42] talking about hearing my voice in the
[2:08:45] background in the service or hearing the
[2:08:47] preacher or hearing the prophet's word
[2:08:49] in the background or hearing the Bible
[2:08:52] but when you hear it when it's being
[2:08:53] revealed to you that's the time that God
[2:08:58] is speaking to you and that's a time
[2:09:02] that you can go free from whatever has
[2:09:05] been binding you up
[2:09:10] remember this Jubilee release was all
[2:09:14] about this man getting his property back
[2:09:17] it was about him receiving his
[2:09:19] authority and some Sons and Daughters of
[2:09:22] God this book of redemption the seven
[2:09:24] sealed book of redemption that was
[2:09:27] preached and given to us was all about
[2:09:30] us receiving our inheritance that we now
[2:09:34] are Sons and Daughters of God and
[2:09:37] whatever we say whatever we ask in his
[2:09:39] name we can have it we we call on him
[2:09:44] for restoration of our families we call
[2:09:47] on him for healing of our bodies or
[2:09:50] whatever the situation is in the church
[2:09:52] but you know it's really coming back to
[2:09:54] our inheritance as a son or daughter of
[2:09:57] God what was that inheritance Adam had
[2:10:00] the power over creation and you have the
[2:10:03] power over your little life in the way
[2:10:07] you can create so let me ask you Adam
[2:10:10] and Mrs Eve that's sitting here this
[2:10:12] morning that have this opportunity to
[2:10:16] take God at his word the the situation
[2:10:19] that you're in God has giv given you the
[2:10:22] power he's equipped you with the
[2:10:24] creative power to change those
[2:10:27] circumstances and it starts with the
[2:10:29] right attitude it starts with never
[2:10:32] being negative always positive it starts
[2:10:35] with saying what the word says about you
[2:10:39] and about your situation it's not about
[2:10:41] how you feel it's not about others tried
[2:10:44] it and failed it's not about you know
[2:10:46] all the negative things markers that are
[2:10:48] around you it's all about you are a son
[2:10:52] or daughter of of God and God has giv
[2:10:55] you the power to create over that
[2:10:58] circumstance and that starts with your
[2:11:01] attitude and that atmosphere that you're
[2:11:03] living in you can call on God to believe
[2:11:06] for the things that are not as though
[2:11:10] they
[2:11:11] are that is what faith is and Faith
[2:11:15] cometh by what by hearing and hearing by
[2:11:19] the word of God and so the word word of
[2:11:21] God tells us that you know he he would
[2:11:25] he would he would give us the desires of
[2:11:27] our heart if we would Delight oursel in
[2:11:31] him he would give us the desires of our
[2:11:34] heart and what is your greatest desire
[2:11:38] today you know many times as you mature
[2:11:42] your greatest desire won't be something
[2:11:45] you know tangible or natural out there
[2:11:47] something carnal it's going to be
[2:11:49] something like seeing some of your
[2:11:50] family members come back to the lord
[2:11:53] it's going to be something like some
[2:11:55] kind of Redemptive restoration of your
[2:11:57] property your family belongs to you and
[2:12:00] so we believe that you have that power
[2:12:03] everybody can't can't walk the message
[2:12:06] like you everybody couldn't be Joseph
[2:12:09] there was one Joseph but Joseph's life
[2:12:12] saved his family's life and actually not
[2:12:16] only his family he saved all of Egypt he
[2:12:18] saved everybody so he had to go through
[2:12:21] that that test or that trial and he made
[2:12:25] it through and look at the Bountiful
[2:12:26] fruit that came out of his life it
[2:12:30] totally Liv outlived him his life that
[2:12:33] he lived that's what Christianity is is
[2:12:36] living for others and what about Moses
[2:12:39] and what about Ruth in the book of
[2:12:41] redemption Ruth lived her life and after
[2:12:44] she's dead and gone uh God was looking
[2:12:47] for a king he finds a king out of the
[2:12:50] house of Jesse the youngest one who was
[2:12:52] that it was David that was Ruth's great
[2:12:55] grandson or her her relative down the
[2:12:57] road you see that it was in the
[2:13:00] Commonwealth same thing with Rahab Rahab
[2:13:02] saved her house same thing with the with
[2:13:05] the Italian and Acts chapter 10 saved
[2:13:09] his house and all the workers and those
[2:13:12] around him because he had come in
[2:13:15] Channel and come in line and things are
[2:13:17] are made right and sometimes we want to
[2:13:19] see everybody do what we're doing
[2:13:21] everybody come in the same time we're
[2:13:23] coming in we're not all required to do
[2:13:25] the same thing God might just call one
[2:13:28] out of a family brother mam says it like
[2:13:30] this that many people don't know that
[2:13:34] the judgments are being withheld on this
[2:13:36] country because of Holy Ghost filled
[2:13:39] people now they're not called to live
[2:13:41] that you are everybody can't be an
[2:13:45] Abraham true everybody can't be a Levi
[2:13:50] you know Levi was blessed and born you
[2:13:53] know from the cradle up he was born in
[2:13:56] the Commonwealth he got credit for
[2:13:58] paying
[2:13:59] tithes while he was in the
[2:14:01] loins it wasn't even named yet but he
[2:14:04] got credit for paying TI he said well
[2:14:07] everybody can't be an a a Levi but but
[2:14:10] you can be an Abraham though and
[2:14:13] Abraham's the one who started that going
[2:14:15] and from Abraham's life it blessed the
[2:14:18] life of others and this big this year of
[2:14:21] jubilees was about a man that was bound
[2:14:24] that come into recognition of what was
[2:14:27] being sounded and that his inheritance
[2:14:29] can be given to him and he can have his
[2:14:31] entire family is that you is that me
[2:14:36] absolutely that's who this is that's

[2:14:50] Angel comes down down and the book is

[2:14:59] revelation of what those seals were
