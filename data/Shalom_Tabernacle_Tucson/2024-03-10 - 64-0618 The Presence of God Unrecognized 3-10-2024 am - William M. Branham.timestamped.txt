[1:58] amen
[2:00] Revelation 6 verse
[2:03] 5 and when he had opened the third seal
[2:06] I heard the third Beast say come and see
[2:10] and I beheld and lo a black horse and he
[2:13] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[2:16] in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the
[2:19] midst of the four Beast say a measure of
[2:21] wheat for a penny and three measures of
[2:24] Bley for a penny and see thou hurt not
[2:27] the oil and the wine
[2:30] we'll be uh starting at paragraph 134 to
[2:34] 189 to be about 20 minutes let's just
[2:38] sing only
[2:43] believe only
[2:48] be
[2:49] only
[2:53] biley all things are
[2:58] possible oh
[3:00] only
[3:03] believe
[3:04] only
[3:08] believe
[3:10] only
[3:13] be all things are
[3:18] possible
[3:20] only
[3:23] be you may be
[3:28] seated
[3:58] for
[4:01] all
[4:02] right God has promised this
[4:07] church this Pentecostal Church knowing
[4:09] she would do it like it did to Eve God
[4:13] has promised the Pentecostal church do
[4:16] you believe that she sold her
[4:17] birthrights before uh her virtue when
[4:19] she left over there do you believe that
[4:21] she sure she did then what good is a
[4:24] Creed not based on this Bible I want
[4:28] somebody to find What's called the apost
[4:29] Creed or even one word of it in the
[4:32] Bible that's a Catholic Creed not an
[4:34] Apostles Creed read acts 238 that's
[4:37] Apostles
[4:40] Creed now that's what they used all time
[4:44] anyhow so if you see so they sold out
[4:48] their birth rights not only that
[4:50] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[4:52] Pentecostal rest's done the same she
[4:55] formed a denomination Rome what made her
[4:58] do that she formed a nomination and put
[5:00] man at the head of it and the Methodist
[5:03] Baptist Pentecostals and everyone's done
[5:05] the same thing put a group of man at the
[5:07] head of it no matter what God says they
[5:10] you got to do it the way they say do it
[5:13] but what is it it's nothing in the world
[5:15] but spiritual
[5:19] prostitution wrong type of woman that's
[5:23] Creeds ly Creeds man-made then she
[5:27] became when she did that now I'll prove
[5:30] this she became a to
[5:34] God you believe the Bible says that this
[5:38] her daughters has done the
[5:41] same now in Revelation 17 you want to
[5:43] mark it down John was taken in the
[5:46] spirit and saw a great horor setting up
[5:49] on and we read it last night and there
[5:51] was the seven heels and exactly what you
[5:53] done and she had given the world her
[5:56] filthy
[5:58] fornications that right and all the
[6:00] kings of the earth committed
[6:02] fornications with her cheating stealing
[6:04] lying
[6:06] paying for repentance and and novenas
[6:10] and every other thing when I remember
[6:13] she had
[6:15] daughters well if she become a
[6:18] body under an organizational system then
[6:22] the whole system's wrong amen amen amen
[6:26] in of Eve disobeying God thr everything
[6:29] into death that was under and every
[6:32] church that organizes throws everything
[6:34] to death under that's right exactly
[6:38] whole thing's
[6:39] gone that's exactly according to the
[6:41] word here read Revelation
[6:43] 17 and the Bible said that he would burn
[6:46] her with fire and all her children with
[6:49] her amen right amen that means every
[6:52] organization system will burn with the
[6:56] hor that sounds flat and uh I I know
[7:01] you'll hear from it I I want to hear
[7:03] from it
[7:04] amen and I that's right old amen the
[7:08] Bible said so so that makes it
[7:10] right she became a you can read
[7:13] Revelations the 17th chapter she what
[7:16] did she do she committed
[7:19] fornications against her own
[7:23] husband well you say no that's the Bible
[7:26] the word is God Amen and if you take one
[7:30] thing would you want your wife kissing
[7:32] some other man if she didn't do no more
[7:34] than that you wouldn't want her doing it
[7:35] she'd prove her un truess whosoever
[7:37] shall take one word away from it or add
[7:40] one to it Hallelujah Christ his life
[7:44] pure with the
[7:45] word way she must
[7:48] be oh nothing not one hot or one jle or
[7:52] anything or TI will pass from that law
[7:55] for that book Co it's all fulfilled
[7:57] Jesus said both heavens and earth will
[7:59] pass
[7:59] but my word shall never
[8:02] pass don't put any private
[8:05] interpretation to it he wants a pure
[8:08] unadulterated not even a
[8:11] flirt I wouldn't want my wife flirt to
[8:13] some other man and when you go to listen
[8:15] to any kind of reasons beyond that
[8:17] you're listening you're FLIR with
[8:20] [Music]
[8:21] Satan
[8:23] hallelujah amen don't make
[8:27] feel Hallelujah
[8:30] God wants you to stay unadulterated stay
[8:32] right there in that
[8:33] word stay right with it all
[8:37] right God promised to her as he did to
[8:40] Eve in the Garden of Eden to this uh
[8:44] last Eve here which the Pentecostal
[8:47] Church the beginning of the church the
[8:50] church itself is the mother of all of
[8:54] the living people because as long as
[8:56] they go in there but you see when they
[8:59] they take up her sins they die with her
[9:02] amen here comes a little fellow along he
[9:04] say I want to serve God they say well
[9:07] here's what you do go down there and
[9:08] repent all right I'll do it glory to God
[9:11] go down there and repent now come Jo
[9:13] there there you are I got it TR died
[9:17] right with
[9:18] it that's that's what this book is
[9:21] teaching see not what I'm saying because
[9:23] it says you're Soul all right now God
[9:27] has promised her as it did Eve he told
[9:30] Eve there would come a time that there
[9:32] would the word would come back to her
[9:34] again how you remember that what she
[9:37] lost from it would be restored because
[9:39] there's only one thing can restore and
[9:41] that's the
[9:42] word exactly I said shoot a gun if you
[9:46] don't hit the target find where it went
[9:48] off at you got to come back there and
[9:50] start again and if you go back you go to
[9:53] Nia it's where you start again see go
[9:56] back W them organizations W all that
[9:58] church we've been seeing these seals us
[10:00] perfectly always wanted all my life why
[10:02] I was so against the organizational
[10:04] systems not the people no the people are
[10:07] just like me or you or anybody else but
[10:09] that
[10:10] system that denominational system now I
[10:13] see it right here never know it till now
[10:16] that's
[10:17] right God promised the spiritual Eve as
[10:21] same as it did the natural Eve again the
[10:24] word would be restored to her in the
[10:26] last days he would restore
[10:30] to the church to the original word
[10:36] again I'll watch real
[10:39] close I I want you to be sure now God
[10:43] promised the eve the time would come
[10:46] when the word would be restored by her
[10:49] seed
[10:51] amen the word itself would become
[10:56] seed and when they give her a substitute
[10:58] she help that
[11:00] substitute and when the word come to her
[11:02] what she do I don't want it was too
[11:05] humble didn't look right to her wasn't
[11:07] polished enough a stable oh my my a guy
[11:12] like that not a day in school I could
[11:15] accept that that's no Messiah a Godly
[11:17] guys kick him around like that then call
[11:18] it Messiah let him put a rag around his
[11:20] face and hit him on the head he called
[11:21] himself a prophet a real Prophet raised
[11:23] up that they didn't know prophets Jesus
[11:25] said so amen he said if you have known
[11:28] the ET you know
[11:32] me I noticed but when the word came to
[11:35] her the way just exactly the way God
[11:37] said it would come she had figured out
[11:39] some other way amen I'm talking about
[11:42] the bride the Jewish bride the Hebrew
[11:44] bride that was Eve to begin with now
[11:46] when it come out here she didn't want it
[11:48] she want to stay with her substitutes
[11:50] now God promised spiritual
[11:53] Eve at Pentecost told it even before it
[11:57] happened 400 years years before the
[11:59] church ever fell that they would fall
[12:02] away and they would do what they've done
[12:05] but he promised in the last days he had
[12:09] s the word
[12:10] [Music]
[12:12] again Jesus spoke the same thing when he
[12:14] was on
[12:16] Earth he was s it
[12:19] again and what is what will it
[12:24] find it'll find the same thing that it
[12:27] found when it come first am right
[12:30] they've got they want their substitutes
[12:32] they want their
[12:33] denomination they want their Creeds they
[12:36] want to live just the way they want to
[12:37] and they want well I'm so and so I
[12:39] belong to so and so don't make what
[12:41] God's doing how much he manifest himself
[12:44] he could raise the dead he could tell
[12:46] the secrets of the hearts he could do
[12:48] everything that the Bible said he would
[12:49] do that don't make a bit of difference
[12:51] if it ain't connect with my organization
[12:53] is nothing to
[12:55] it same thing that Hebrew
[13:00] right yeah that's right see they
[13:03] listened to their substitute and God
[13:06] promised them the real and when the real
[13:09] come they didn't want it it was too
[13:11] humble amen that's the same thing
[13:14] today when when it rises on the scene
[13:16] now God said in Malachi 4 that he would
[13:19] send the message in the last days that
[13:21] would
[13:26] restore God Joel said I will restore all
[13:30] the ears everything that Rome eat up
[13:32] everything the Methodist eat up
[13:34] everything the Baptist eat up all that
[13:36] original Pentecostal Branch God said I
[13:38] will
[13:39] [Music]
[13:45] restore and he can send this such a
[13:47] person that we'll be the only thing that
[13:51] God ever sent his word to as a
[13:54] prophet not to reformers to prophets
[13:57] amen it wasn't the hour fart now it's
[14:00] getting to be the hour and that's the
[14:01] Reon we watching F to come it'll be so
[14:04] humble and gentle and so oh my you think
[14:07] them aristocratic Methodist Baptist and
[14:09] Presbyterian Pentecostals will ever
[14:11] receive it oh you said Pentecostals the
[14:13] Pentecostals is the Lady or
[14:15] sins rich and have need of nothing it
[14:18] said you don't know that you're poor
[14:21] might be building millions of dollars
[14:22] buildings but you're still poor
[14:25] spiritual poor oh you say I see it all
[14:28] you're
[14:31] or you say bless God I'm covered
[14:34] [Music]
[14:37] naked I sure are boys we got seminaries
[14:40] we and don't know
[14:43] it now that's just vice versa now if the
[14:47] Bible said that the lady of sinan church
[14:50] would be in that condition and there's
[14:53] no person on Earth could deny that this
[14:55] isn't the last age because the lady of
[14:58] sin Church age or the seventh Church age
[15:00] and here we
[15:02] are the second 2,000 years is
[15:05] finishing there's no more Church ages
[15:08] that's you Lin brother couldn't start
[15:10] another organization is go to
[15:12] beor right it's at the
[15:19] end can't be no more Church agents it's
[15:22] all over but then if the
[15:25] Pentecostal message was the last message
[15:28] which justification sanctification the
[15:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost the last three
[15:33] messages the last three Church
[15:35] ages forms a complete birth it's like
[15:39] when a woman is have to go to have her
[15:41] baby the actual first thing happens is
[15:43] water next thing's blood next thing he's
[15:45] life when they killed Jesus At The Cross
[15:47] the substance come from his body to make
[15:49] up the new to make up the the birth they
[15:51] stuck his side blood and water came out
[15:54] and into thy hands I command my spirit
[15:57] what came from his body was water water
[15:58] blood spirit first john7 tells you about
[16:02] that there are three that bear record in
[16:03] heaven the Father the word which is
[16:06] Christ and the Holy Ghost and these
[16:08] three agree in one they're not one but
[16:10] they agree in one and there are three
[16:12] that bear Rec they are one I mean I'm
[16:15] mistaken and the three that bear record
[16:17] in Earth is the water blood and spirit
[16:20] and they agree in that you can be
[16:22] Sanctified without being justified you
[16:24] can be justified without being
[16:26] Sanctified you can be a Sanctified
[16:29] without receiving the Holy Ghost exactly
[16:32] the disciples in John 17:17 was
[16:34] Sanctified and given power cast out
[16:36] Devils still didn't have the Holy
[16:38] Ghost had to go up to Pentecost and wait
[16:41] till the Holy Ghost come that's where
[16:43] Judah showed his color see how that
[16:45] Spirit worked its way through
[16:46] justification and sanctification but
[16:48] when it come to the end he showed his
[16:49] color that's right now notice now here
[16:54] we are at the end time in spiritual Eve
[16:57] just as that's as Hebrew Eve was
[17:01] promised the Hebrew bride was promised
[17:04] the word to return and the spiritual
[17:08] bride from Pentecost when she fell at
[17:11] NAA then she's promised in the last days
[17:14] that the word will come again now you
[17:16] see and you want to know the scripture
[17:18] take over here at Revelations 10 and
[17:21] said in the hour the time of the the
[17:26] last Angel the seventh angel
[17:29] seventh messenger am begins to sound the
[17:33] mystery of God is
[17:35] finished the restoration back to the
[17:39] word the Bible said that this messenger
[17:43] of the last days would be restore them
[17:46] back to the original Faith again back to
[17:48] the faith of the father but do you think
[17:50] they receive it no sir last days he
[17:54] would restore the original word again as
[17:57] said in Malachi 4
[17:59] but she had forfeited now she forfeited
[18:02] that word at
[18:04] NAA e forfeited in
[18:07] Eden Eve rejected hers a
[18:11] Calvary and Nas's group is rejecting it
[18:15] in the last days that's the
[18:18] same M but when the word came in human
[18:22] flesh she Eve the Hebrew Church mother
[18:27] of all Spiritual Living at then she
[18:30] rejected
[18:31] it she was so dead in her traditions and
[18:36] dogmas that she missed it so is this one
[18:40] exactly all right they miss him the
[18:43] Living Word manifested In the Flesh by
[18:47] the word that is Promised the word
[18:51] promised to do these
[18:52] things the promise was made that it'll
[18:55] be like this in the last days amen as it
[18:59] was in the days of Sodom so shall it be
[19:01] in the coming of the son of man now
[19:04] watch what happened to Sodom as it was
[19:06] in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[19:08] the coming of the son of man watch what
[19:11] happened then see now I said it be the
[19:13] same thing and we live in that day well
[19:16] it could be I guess I could get 600
[19:18] Promises of them like that out of the
[19:20] scripture just referring to it see now
[19:23] but they rejected she held to her Diss
[19:26] and substitute and stood of the the
[19:29] sheld to the substitute blood instead of
[19:31] the real blood uh Jesus the word said
[19:35] when it was manifested to her because
[19:37] she help to these Traditions Jesus the
[19:40] manifested word said to the bride Hebrew
[19:46] bride because you hold to your
[19:49] Traditions you make the word of God
[19:52] without any effect to
[19:55] you it can't be effective now now that's
[19:58] what's the reason today that the the
[20:01] Revival that we're supposed to have we
[20:03] have denominational revivals we have had
[20:06] a real stir no no no oh sir don't think
[20:11] we got Revival we haven't oh they've got
[20:14] millions and millions and millions of
[20:16] church members but not a Revival
[20:21] nowhere the the bride hasn't had a
[20:23] Revival yet there's been no Revival
[20:26] there no manifestation of God to stir
[20:28] the bride yet see we're looking
[20:31] for it'll take those seven unknown
[20:33] Thunders back there to wake her
[20:36] up he'll send it he promised
[20:39] it why now she was she was dead and now
[20:46] if the churches would forget their
[20:48] Creeds and forget their dogmas and just
[20:51] take the Bible plead the promise then it
[20:54] would come effective to him but see
[20:57] Jesus Jesus said you with your
[20:59] Traditions make the word of God not
[21:02] effective to you well that's the same
[21:04] thing today with spiritual Eve see the
[21:08] spiritual bride of today so-called the
[21:11] church she takes the word of God and she
[21:14] won't accept it and she accepts dogmas
[21:16] instead therefore the word's not
[21:18] affective to
[21:20] her because she tries to inject her
[21:23] Creed with the word and it won't
[21:27] work now what we need today uh just keep
[21:31] reading this sh heral of his coming
[21:33] across the headlines we need a prophet
[21:36] to return we need a prophet to return
[21:39] and I guess when he does return they'll
[21:41] know nothing about it that's right it's
[21:43] always been that way we need everything
[21:46] you talk about we need a prophet to
[21:49] return who will bring the word of the
[21:50] Lord Fearless we be the Bible promising
[21:54] uh I know brother brother more eating
[21:58] his house and everything else the editor
[22:00] and he's the finest man walks and Sho
[22:03] Lea I guess one of the finest see he
[22:06] knows that we got to have that and
[22:08] Sister Moore one of the finest women
[22:11] little poor little fell they sacrificed
[22:13] and that's one of the best papers on the
[22:15] field in my opinion is the herald of his
[22:17] coming but you find out they keep
[22:19] blasting that we need a prophet we need
[22:21] a prophet
[22:24] see that's what they talk
[22:26] about
[22:28] and then here we are today and like
[22:31] yesterday and today announcing on the
[22:33] radio that in the Baptist churches and
[22:35] so forth that we're not to take in with
[22:38] the Catholics but we're to kind of
[22:39] fellowship with
[22:41] them and right you're the message going
[22:43] out right here to stay away from that
[22:48] poison how could you walk together L
[22:50] they be
[22:52] agreed light and dark can't Fellowship
[22:54] together when light comes in dark goes
[22:56] out okay most powerful you can't put
[22:59] light out with dark but you can put dark
[23:02] out with light that's right and he is
[23:04] the light and he is the word there you
[23:06] are right straight back you can't make
[23:08] it lie or do anything wrong it comes
[23:10] right straight back to the spot again
[23:12] yes sir it's just like some guy start
[23:15] try to fuss with you if you know where
[23:16] to stand know what he believes it's just
[23:19] like taking a rabbit and turning him
[23:21] loose in a pen and you got every hole
[23:23] stopped up you st the gate he's got to
[23:24] come
[23:26] back he have come right back to the gate
[23:29] again cuz that's the only way he can get
[23:31] out he'll stick his head to here and
[23:33] almost break his neck go over there and
[23:34] over there can stand watching he come
[23:36] right back that's that's the only way
[23:39] you stay with that

[50:25] Lord Lord
[50:27] Jesus amen I just felt like singing
[50:30] songs this morning that were happy songs
[50:33] we have just so much to be thankful for
[50:35] so much to bless his name for
[50:38] and I was listening to something
[50:41] yesterday on the radio just really
[50:44] really touched me it was a super athlete
[50:48] that was being interviewed and this was
[50:50] a super athlete that was a
[50:53] swimmer and and
[50:56] the climbing World they have this Seven
[50:59] Summits that's kind of the the the the
[51:03] peak no pun intended of of of that sport
[51:07] it's Mount Everest and six others that
[51:09] they want to they conquered the Seven
[51:11] Summits and so this was a swimmer that
[51:13] was a distant swimmer that had there's
[51:16] seven oceans it includes the Brit
[51:18] British Channel um one of them's from
[51:22] Los Angeles over to Catalina Island
[51:24] they're all 20 to 30 m swims and so they
[51:28] were talking to him about one of the
[51:30] swims that he did and it was um over
[51:34] near
[51:35] Japan and it was a it was a swim that
[51:38] should have taken about eight hours to
[51:40] do and it just talking about the
[51:42] adversity that immediately started as he
[51:45] was getting ready to launch off on the
[51:47] swim he got caught up in some some waves
[51:50] and kind of threw him up and he beat up
[51:52] his you know knees and his hands like
[51:54] the start of it but he's you know I just
[51:56] feel like I have to do this still today
[51:58] my sponsors are behind me so he set off
[52:01] for the swim and he started swimming an
[52:04] hour 2 hours 3 hours go by and he just
[52:08] times he felt like he was Treading Water
[52:11] he say just you know these foot waves
[52:13] that are going you feel like you're
[52:14] never really catching the water
[52:16] sometimes you're just catching air as
[52:17] you're swimming so he got
[52:20] about halfway through what he thought
[52:22] and he asked the people in the boat he
[52:24] say you know how much further is it he
[52:26] said well we're showing 5 hours okay
[52:28] well we we'll keep going it's taking a
[52:29] little longer than we
[52:31] thought goes another hour what are you
[52:33] showing now we're showing five hours
[52:36] another hour of swimming we're still
[52:38] showing five hours he just realized he
[52:41] just been caught in this little whal
[52:43] pool just this Little Edie that
[52:46] just just sucks you into it you don't
[52:48] realize it but if you keep doing the
[52:50] same thing you're just going to stay
[52:51] there and so somebody in the in the boat
[52:54] said you got to spr Sprint and he's like
[52:56] I've been I've been swimming for 7 hours
[52:58] and I got to Sprint yeah you got to
[53:01] Sprint so he does he goes into the
[53:03] Sprint mode and he was able to get out
[53:06] of that pool that he was in and continue
[53:09] on towards the goal and he says then you
[53:12] know the sun sets you're swimming in
[53:14] total darkness he says there are times
[53:15] you see something large swimming
[53:17] underneath you you know you've got you
[53:20] don't know what it is but it's it's
[53:21] something that could uh they're giants
[53:24] that are in path is what they are but he
[53:27] just he kept his mind focused and 16
[53:31] hours twice the amount of time it should
[53:32] have taken he he reached the goal
[53:35] and and then they you know that's just
[53:38] how how can you overcome that in your
[53:41] mind and he says well I always travel
[53:44] there's a couple of boats that are with
[53:45] me when I'm when I'm there and he says
[53:47] on one of the boats he says that's kind
[53:49] of my you know the one that I have to
[53:51] have there and he says on it he said you
[53:55] know sometimes I have friends that are
[53:57] on there that are cheering Me on he says
[53:59] but a lot of times he says I'm imagining
[54:02] my loved ones that maybe you know
[54:05] Grandpa that's gone on and some others
[54:07] that are standing there and and are just
[54:09] encouraging me and he says I'm just I'm
[54:11] I'm doing it for them and I just
[54:13] couldn't help but think you know we've
[54:14] got a Heaven's
[54:16] grandstands are full this morning and
[54:19] just saying come on come on keep going

[1:11:04] Pharisees answered saying Master we
[1:11:07] would see a sign from
[1:11:22] thee
[1:11:24] for as Jonas was three days and three
[1:11:26] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[1:11:28] son of man be three days and three
[1:11:30] nights in the heart of the
[1:11:44] earth Al together the queen of the South
[1:11:47] shall rise up in the Judgment with this
[1:11:50] generation and shall condemn it for she

[1:14:51] Revival means to re that what you've
[1:14:54] already
[1:14:55] got a
[1:14:57] Revival I watched one time at the
[1:14:59] seashore where a wind was blowing and it
[1:15:02] was just shaking well it wasn't the
[1:15:03] seashore is the is up Lake Michigan I
[1:15:06] standing out there watching the waves as
[1:15:09] it come in and and all that sea was the
[1:15:11] jumping or the waters are jumping and
[1:15:14] and the boats are rocking and I thought
[1:15:16] what is that going on I thought wow the
[1:15:18] Lake's having a Revival that's it it's
[1:15:21] jumping and shaking wild these a Russian
[1:15:22] mighty wind coming down on it I thought
[1:15:25] well you know what there isn't one more
[1:15:28] drop of water in it right now than what
[1:15:29] it was when it's perfectly
[1:15:31] still no more water in it it's just all
[1:15:34] stirred
[1:15:35] up what's it stirred up about you know
[1:15:38] what the stirring up in the water does
[1:15:39] washes all the trash out of it up on the
[1:15:41] bank that's what we need a washing of
[1:15:44] unbelief out on the bank let the word of
[1:15:46] God have preeminence this that's what we
[1:15:48] need a Revival wash all the unbelief out
[1:15:50] and all the bugs and superstitions and
[1:15:53] things come out and see that God's still
[1:15:55] God Amen that's what we have revivals
[1:15:57] for the Lord help us as we choose this
[1:16:00] text and read it for tonight may the
[1:16:03] Lord bless the reading of his word found
[1:16:05] in St Matthew the um the 12th chapter 38
[1:16:10] and to the 42nd
[1:16:12] verse and my text tonight is the
[1:16:17] presence of God
[1:16:20] unrecognized last night we were talking
[1:16:23] of Jesus being the same yesterday today
[1:16:26] and forever and seeing that he was the
[1:16:28] same yesterday today and forever now his
[1:16:30] presence if he is the same is
[1:16:33] unrecognized let us read then certain of
[1:16:37] the scribes and of the Pharisees
[1:16:39] answered saying Master we would see a
[1:16:42] sign from thee but he answered and said
[1:16:46] un them an evil and adulter his
[1:16:47] generation seek after a
[1:16:49] sign and there shall be no sign given
[1:16:52] unto it
[1:16:53] but the sign of the Prophet
[1:16:57] Jonas for as Jonas was three days and
[1:17:00] three nights in the whale's belly so
[1:17:04] shall the son of man be three days and
[1:17:05] three nights in the heart of the Earth
[1:17:08] the man of Nineveh shall rise in the
[1:17:11] Judgment with this generation and shall
[1:17:13] condemn it because they repented at the
[1:17:16] preaching of
[1:17:17] Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas's
[1:17:22] here and the queen of the South shall
[1:17:24] rise up in the Judgment with this
[1:17:26] generation and shall condemn it for she
[1:17:29] came from the uttermost parts of the
[1:17:30] Earth the year the wisdom of
[1:17:32] Solomon and behold a greater than
[1:17:35] Solomon is
[1:17:39] here the unrecognized presence what
[1:17:44] could these people be thinking
[1:17:46] of God has always it's been that way
[1:17:49] every time he come when Jesus was sh the
[1:17:53] first time he said uh you you whiten and
[1:17:57] you garnish the walls and the tombs of
[1:17:59] the prophets and you put them in there
[1:18:02] see something happens and it passes by
[1:18:05] and God hides it from the eyes of wise
[1:18:08] and prudent and reveals it to Bab such
[1:18:10] as will learn Jesus thanked the father
[1:18:12] for doing such see it goes right by the
[1:18:16] people and they don't know it for
[1:18:17] instance you Catholic people here
[1:18:19] tonight do you remember a few years ago
[1:18:22] Jonah Ark in France the little lady that
[1:18:25] was really she led the Revolutionary in
[1:18:28] France but she was really a a servant of
[1:18:32] Christ what did your church do to her
[1:18:35] burnner at the stake as a witch because
[1:18:38] she seen visions and was spiritual the
[1:18:41] Catholic church burned her as a witch at
[1:18:44] the state because she was spiritual in
[1:18:47] seen Visions a few years afterwards they
[1:18:50] found out that that woman was a saint so
[1:18:53] of course you done great Penance you dug
[1:18:55] up those priests body that condemned her
[1:18:57] and burned her and throw him into the
[1:18:59] river of course that you done great
[1:19:01] pentant for that for digging up this
[1:19:03] priest's body now in the days of the
[1:19:06] prophets what
[1:19:08] happened they did the same thing they
[1:19:10] didn't recognize him till they had done
[1:19:13] come Ministry had finished took out of
[1:19:16] that the elected and
[1:19:18] then after they were gone they
[1:19:20] recognized that they had been a prophet
[1:19:23] among them Jesus he came to the Earth
[1:19:26] that endowed within him was the father
[1:19:30] God I am my father a one my father
[1:19:33] dwelleth in me it's not me that doeth
[1:19:35] the works but my father and if I do not
[1:19:37] the works of my father believe me not
[1:19:41] now if you notice when he came about one
[1:19:46] one 90th of the world knew that he is
[1:19:50] even on Earth at that time and yet the
[1:19:52] savior of the
[1:19:54] world and then they never recognized who
[1:19:56] he was even the church or no one else
[1:19:59] heart until they crucified him buried
[1:20:01] and rose on the third day before they
[1:20:04] ever knowed who he was it comes in and
[1:20:08] goes out and people does not recognize
[1:20:11] it until it's
[1:20:12] passed and they because that it never
[1:20:16] fits their theology it never fits the
[1:20:18] time of the day you see what it is
[1:20:21] they're always living in a glare of
[1:20:23] another
[1:20:24] age
[1:20:26] always the reason they didn't accept
[1:20:28] Jesus because they were living in the
[1:20:30] glare of the
[1:20:31] law and when Jesus came was not contrary
[1:20:34] to the law but come to fulfill the law
[1:20:37] well they couldn't accept him because
[1:20:39] his message wasn't exactly the way they
[1:20:40] had it all created out and it was called
[1:20:43] then
[1:20:44] traditions and they he didn't come
[1:20:46] according to the Traditions he didn't
[1:20:48] keep their traditions and really he
[1:20:50] upset it and tore it up and and done
[1:20:53] things that was contrary to it in so
[1:20:54] much as it thought he was breaking up
[1:20:55] the churches and they couldn't receive
[1:20:58] him because of his message and we all
[1:21:01] know today that he come exactly in the
[1:21:03] line of God's prophecy amen but they
[1:21:06] didn't know it then and it could happen
[1:21:08] again and we wouldn't know it I imagine
[1:21:11] if he had actually appeared tonight it
[1:21:13] would be so contrary to what we got all
[1:21:16] figured up on our charts and in our
[1:21:18] schools and things that be very few
[1:21:19] would recognize what was going on he
[1:21:21] said it would be
[1:21:23] how he come now Jesus being there so
[1:21:26] scripturally identified by the
[1:21:29] scriptures and the scribes and Pharisees
[1:21:32] of that day could not recognize him why
[1:21:34] didn't they why didn't they do it
[1:21:37] because they had it figured out some
[1:21:39] other way that's where Jesus told him
[1:21:42] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:21:44] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:21:47] they that testify of me amen see now he
[1:21:50] come exactly with the scriptures but
[1:21:52] they had it figured out maybe that if he
[1:21:54] would come uh uh the Messiah would
[1:21:57] probably do what Moses did or what an
[1:22:00] Noah did build him an arc or something
[1:22:02] else but we reason he come the way he
[1:22:04] did they hadn't figured out in the
[1:22:07] scriptures with their traditions did not
[1:22:08] teach them so the people were so
[1:22:10] confused they didn't know what was going
[1:22:12] on wonder if that could happen today I
[1:22:16] wonder if it could be different than
[1:22:17] what our Traditions has taught us and it
[1:22:20] could come and something had passed
[1:22:22] through and we never even know until
[1:22:23] it's already passed and then it's over
[1:22:26] that's just about the way it'll come do
[1:22:28] you know when John the Baptist came on
[1:22:30] the scene that have been predicted all
[1:22:32] the way from the book of Isaiah hundreds
[1:22:34] of years about 800 years Isaiah
[1:22:36] prophesied I think before the coming of
[1:22:38] Christ did you know John came exactly
[1:22:41] the way Isaiah said he would come he
[1:22:43] come exactly the way Malachi said he
[1:22:45] would come and even the apostles didn't
[1:22:47] recognize it one day in Matthew 11 John
[1:22:52] was was in prison and the apostles uh
[1:22:54] some of his disciples went over to ask
[1:22:56] Jesus was he the one or or should they
[1:22:59] look for another I notice Jesus did not
[1:23:03] uh give him a book of how to behave
[1:23:05] themselves how to behave himself in jail
[1:23:07] or how to conduct his character he said
[1:23:09] stay around and watch what happens and
[1:23:12] go show John the things that you seen
[1:23:15] happen that was the evidence that the he
[1:23:19] was that
[1:23:20] word and I remember the word always
[1:23:23] comes to a prophet we all know that God
[1:23:26] does nothing without showing it to His
[1:23:28] prophets that's the reason the book of
[1:23:30] the revelation of Jesus Christ is the
[1:23:32] full fullness of Christ right here
[1:23:34] before it's the book now he'll have to
[1:23:38] same one someone to confirm that book
[1:23:40] reveal it open the seals and so forth
[1:23:43] but as far as any further revelation of
[1:23:45] Christ is already recognized right here
[1:23:47] he's the fullness of this of the
[1:23:49] Revelation now notice never does it fail
[1:23:53] but the word comes to the prophet look
[1:23:56] at John standing in the water predicting
[1:23:59] the prophet that the Messiah was right
[1:24:01] then among them he said there's one
[1:24:02] standing among you now that you don't
[1:24:05] know he'll baptize you with the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost and Fire now remember he was
[1:24:10] standing right among them the Bible said
[1:24:12] so and they didn't recognize it one day
[1:24:15] when Jesus came walking down John
[1:24:18] recognized him he said Behold the Lamb
[1:24:19] of God that takes away the sin of the
[1:24:21] world I watch before he was recognized
[1:24:24] by anybody he came to the prophet he was
[1:24:29] the
[1:24:30] word John was a prophet I remember my
[1:24:33] old Baptist teacher told me said you
[1:24:35] know what happened said Jesus baptized
[1:24:38] John I said I don't think so he said
[1:24:40] sure John was never baptized he come
[1:24:42] preaching baptizing nobody was worthy to
[1:24:44] baptize him Jesus baptizing I said I
[1:24:47] don't know him one day while in studyed
[1:24:49] the Holy Spirit revealed it like this
[1:24:51] see watch watch he walked out of the
[1:24:53] water he said why comest thou unto me I
[1:24:56] have need to be baptized to thee Jesus
[1:24:58] said suffer that to be so watch but thus
[1:25:02] it is becoming to us behooving us that
[1:25:05] we fulfill all righteousness John being
[1:25:08] a prophet knowing the word the sacrifice
[1:25:11] he was must be washed before presented
[1:25:13] then he was baptized John baptized him
[1:25:16] because it's becoming to us that we
[1:25:18] fulfill all righteousness the word came
[1:25:22] to to the prophet in the water and then
[1:25:24] when he was baptized still the people
[1:25:27] and the Holy Spirit came down not
[1:25:29] everybody saw it John saw it the angel
[1:25:33] of the Lord can be right here tonight
[1:25:35] and maybe one person see it no one
[1:25:37] else that light that star that come over
[1:25:41] every Observatory where the the wise man
[1:25:44] followed no Observatory knows anything
[1:25:47] about it no one else saw it at all but
[1:25:48] those wise men because it was far them
[1:25:52] to see see it amen they saw it it was
[1:25:54] real to them when the light the pillar
[1:25:56] of fire smoke Paul down on the road to
[1:25:58] Damascus he recognized that he was in
[1:26:01] the presence of God now that Hebrew
[1:26:03] would have never called any other Spirit
[1:26:06] Lord besides he know it that was the
[1:26:07] same Pillar of Fire that led his people
[1:26:09] out of the Wilderness he said Lord who
[1:26:11] are you Saul Saul why persecutest thou
[1:26:14] me he said I'm
[1:26:16] Jesus Jesus said I come from God and I
[1:26:18] return to God he was that fire that was
[1:26:21] in the burning bush that led Moses to
[1:26:24] the Wilderness and he returned back to
[1:26:26] that and now here he was on the road
[1:26:28] down to Damascus was stricken down and
[1:26:31] all the man was with him they never saw
[1:26:33] that pillar of f it was so so real to
[1:26:36] Paul till he put his eyes out and he had
[1:26:37] to be led down to the street called
[1:26:40] straight in Damascus he was blind ananas
[1:26:44] a prophet down there saw a vision went
[1:26:47] laid hands on him and he received the
[1:26:48] Holy Ghost and the scales fell from his
[1:26:50] eyes and he could see again
[1:26:53] it was so real to him to put his eyes
[1:26:55] out and yet none of the rest of them
[1:26:57] recognized it being there could see it
[1:27:00] so so is it tonight there's somebody
[1:27:04] sitting right there can bring God on the
[1:27:06] scene when the other don't know nothing
[1:27:08] about it
[1:27:09] amen recognizing God Jesus when he was
[1:27:13] here on Earth and had fully perform the
[1:27:16] sign that the Bible said that he would
[1:27:19] do but they didn't recognize it because
[1:27:23] it wasn't according to their tradition
[1:27:25] for that age he wasn't to come and do
[1:27:28] what Moses did he was to come and be
[1:27:31] born of a virgin and he according to
[1:27:33] Deuteronomy 18:15 he was to be a prophet
[1:27:36] and exactly he did those works and
[1:27:40] signs the Jews always sought signs they
[1:27:43] were taught to never to depend on
[1:27:46] intellectual
[1:27:48] speeches the Jews know better than that
[1:27:51] the Greeks taught that but not
[1:27:53] intellectual speeches but upon signs
[1:27:56] show us a sign these people want said
[1:27:59] Rabbi or master show us a sign they want
[1:28:02] to know and he had already showed them
[1:28:04] the sign and they wanted a different
[1:28:06] kind of sign but he could only do the
[1:28:09] sign of that age so does he today this
[1:28:13] pouring out of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:28:14] sign of his appearing amen even in this
[1:28:18] age as he promised they want a sign
[1:28:22] and he had given the scriptural sign but
[1:28:25] they wanted a different sign that's
[1:28:27] where so many people today is going to
[1:28:29] be confused you know the Rapture might
[1:28:31] take place and just think of the sadness
[1:28:34] of it let me go back to where Jesus or
[1:28:37] John sent his disciples over to see
[1:28:40] Jesus if he was the Messiah or not that
[1:28:44] hour he done many things when he
[1:28:46] returned back to the disciples to tell
[1:28:48] John what they had seen Jesus said to
[1:28:50] those sitting there said what went you
[1:28:52] out to see in the wilderness what went
[1:28:55] you out to see when John was preaching
[1:28:57] did you go out and see a man clothed in
[1:28:59] white Raymond and so forth or or S
[1:29:02] framan said they are the in King's
[1:29:04] palaces they bury the dead and kiss the
[1:29:07] babies and marry the young and so forth
[1:29:10] that they don't know the handling of a
[1:29:11] two-handed sword said what did you go
[1:29:14] out to see then a reed shaking with any
[1:29:16] wind somebody some group will offer him
[1:29:18] a little more money and he'll go to this
[1:29:19] one in instead of going to the calling
[1:29:21] of the Lord not John somebody could
[1:29:23] twist him around and say we'll give you
[1:29:24] more if you'll uh deny this and take
[1:29:27] this not John he said what did you go
[1:29:30] out to see than a prophet he said I say
[1:29:33] unto you more than a prophet and if you
[1:29:36] can receive it this is who who the
[1:29:38] prophet said behold I send my messenger
[1:29:40] before my face which will prepare the
[1:29:42] way and that was Malachi 3 where he did
[1:29:45] it on day the disciples asked and said
[1:29:47] why did the scribes say that Elias must
[1:29:49] first come Jesus said he's already come
[1:29:52] and you didn't know
[1:29:54] it and they understood that it was John
[1:29:56] the Baptist those elected Apostles still
[1:30:00] couldn't see who he was that was the
[1:30:03] Elijah amen now look you know the the
[1:30:06] coming of the Lord is going to be a
[1:30:07] secret coming he said there'll be two in
[1:30:10] the bed and I'll take one and leave one
[1:30:12] that's where the the night is two in the
[1:30:14] field I'll take one and leave on you
[1:30:17] know there's so many people disappear
[1:30:18] every day off the face of the Earth that
[1:30:20] nobody can account for
[1:30:22] one of these days it might be that
[1:30:24] people might say well you mean the
[1:30:26] tribulation of things on us now I
[1:30:27] thought the church is to go before the
[1:30:30] tribulation they don't realize and
[1:30:33] understand that the Rapture could take
[1:30:35] place and they know nothing about it
[1:30:36] it's a secret going of the church amen
[1:30:39] and think people go right on preaching
[1:30:41] saying they believe they're getting
[1:30:42] saved and adding in the church and
[1:30:44] building churches and going on just like
[1:30:46] they did in the days of Noah and so
[1:30:47] forth and not know it and the Rapture
[1:30:50] done pass amen it's already happened and
[1:30:54] you didn't know it there hundreds of
[1:30:56] people disappear from the earth and
[1:30:57] people know nothing about where they
[1:30:59] went through they can't account for it
[1:31:00] somebody was going somewhere they never
[1:31:02] hear from them no more and that could be
[1:31:04] the
[1:31:05] Rapture I tell you friends just because
[1:31:07] that we are members of the church or
[1:31:09] something like that that doesn't mean
[1:31:12] too much to us you better buckle up that
[1:31:15] armor amen you better take that whole
[1:31:18] word of God and hold on to it and quit
[1:31:20] this Hollywood acting around here it's
[1:31:24] got right into the church and it's a
[1:31:26] shame but Hollywood go just makes a
[1:31:30] bright light and the church today is
[1:31:32] trying to compare with Hollywood Christ
[1:31:35] is not in Hollywood amen Christ is in
[1:31:37] the
[1:31:39] individual Hollywood glow Hollywood
[1:31:41] glares while the gospel glows with
[1:31:44] humility got in in these great fine
[1:31:47] fancy places and all this stuff that we
[1:31:49] see he comes in in humility in form of
[1:31:52] meekness and gentleness pass right
[1:31:54] through and if you're acquainted with
[1:31:56] the word you'll see
[1:31:58] it he that has an eye to hear Let Him
[1:32:01] hear what the spirit sayth to the
[1:32:03] churches thing now now today which was
[1:32:07] identified he identified himself
[1:32:09] properly to the Believers that they them
[1:32:11] who were looking for it look at Peter
[1:32:14] and Andrew look at Nathaniel no question
[1:32:18] in his mind look at the woman at the
[1:32:20] well there was no question but these
[1:32:22] Pharisees a few days before where our
[1:32:24] text this tonight saw him do that and
[1:32:27] then called him be elub a devil The
[1:32:31] Works have been done they had to answer
[1:32:33] their
[1:32:34] congregation so the only thing they
[1:32:36] could do would call it a evil spirit be
[1:32:38] Els was a devil like a fortune teller or
[1:32:41] something and anyone knows that fortune
[1:32:43] telling is of the devil and they was
[1:32:46] comparing where he was the word that
[1:32:48] know the secret of the heart and and
[1:32:51] proving he he was that Prophet that was
[1:32:53] to be raised up to us in this day the
[1:32:55] Redeemer prophet and when he did that
[1:32:59] the church in that day declared him to
[1:33:02] be be you see what there was he said
[1:33:04] you're blind leading the blind amen they
[1:33:08] won't come in neither will they let them
[1:33:10] it's under them come in what we want to
[1:33:12] do today is find out the
[1:33:15] truth we've got to know the truth is he
[1:33:18] the same is he here to fulfill what he
[1:33:21] promised to fulfill search the
[1:33:23] scriptures and find what he's supposed
[1:33:25] to do today amen that's the reason that
[1:33:28] John Wesley or Martin Luther couldn't go
[1:33:30] on with Wesley's message they organized
[1:33:32] it that's as far as he could go along
[1:33:34] come Luther out of Catholic church and
[1:33:37] he they is a crank to them but he had
[1:33:40] the message of justification because it
[1:33:42] was a word of God a promise then they
[1:33:45] after his death they organized the
[1:33:47] Luther organization then what happened
[1:33:49] it got all cuddled up again and
[1:33:52] according to the scripture there's got
[1:33:53] to be another church age raise and when
[1:33:55] it did the Philadelphia Church age raise
[1:33:57] John
[1:33:58] Wesley what it happened kept coming
[1:34:00] Westward all the time and when it
[1:34:02] happened there was the church age and
[1:34:05] John Wesley raised up but Luther could
[1:34:07] not receive it because he already
[1:34:09] organized to justification he could not
[1:34:12] accept sanctification then when the
[1:34:14] wesing organized the way they did and
[1:34:16] the little branches went off which did
[1:34:18] Along come the Pentecostal message of
[1:34:20] the restoration of the gifts none of
[1:34:22] them can move there's already organized
[1:34:26] now the pitiful part of it is the
[1:34:28] Pentecostal so organized amen look at
[1:34:31] the day we're living in what's promised
[1:34:33] for this day where are we we've moved on
[1:34:36] up the pillar of fire moves and the
[1:34:39] children of Israel move with the pillar
[1:34:41] of fire or they went back to Egypt we've
[1:34:44] got to move with the
[1:34:46] word and today we're getting so slothful
[1:34:49] the church is getting so whirly so
[1:34:51] indifferent and so their mind so muddled
[1:34:54] up with television and we love Susi and
[1:34:56] some of these old things and staying
[1:34:58] home that shows where the people's
[1:34:59] hearts
[1:35:00] are you can tell them these things are
[1:35:03] wrong and they think you're
[1:35:05] crazy what is it lovers are pleasure
[1:35:08] more than lovers of
[1:35:10] God all the greatest pleasure I know of
[1:35:13] is to be to pray until I can realize
[1:35:17] that I'm in the presence of God and
[1:35:19] recognize it I think that ought to be
[1:35:21] the Trill of the
[1:35:22] church is the presence of the Holy
[1:35:25] Spirit seeing the god that made the
[1:35:28] promise standing among
[1:35:30] us feel his presence and see his word
[1:35:33] and see it Vindicated it ought to give
[1:35:35] Faith to make cripples walk blind see
[1:35:38] death hear dumb
[1:35:40] speak I stood in South Africa where had
[1:35:44] some 200,000 people at the Durban
[1:35:46] Racetrack and when they seen one time
[1:35:49] that happen like that after explained it
[1:35:51] to them just a little a mile form and
[1:35:54] they seen one thing take place of that
[1:35:57] revealed and
[1:35:59] 25,000 people was instantly healed at
[1:36:02] once they taken Seven band loads trucks
[1:36:06] as long as mere six and 18 wheelers like
[1:36:09] that and piled them full of old crutches
[1:36:11] and things heathens that didn't know
[1:36:13] which was right and left hand the next
[1:36:16] day Mr Sydney Smith the mayor of Durban
[1:36:18] called me and said go to your window out
[1:36:20] towards the Indian Ocean you'll see
[1:36:22] something you never seen there was the
[1:36:24] police escort coming down with seven of
[1:36:27] those big band loads with hundreds of
[1:36:29] people walking behind it the day before
[1:36:32] was in the stretchers and cots and
[1:36:35] carriers that they had singing only
[1:36:37] believe all things are
[1:36:39] possible a week before that they were in
[1:36:41] war with one another native war and
[1:36:44] there they was walking arm in arm hand
[1:36:46] in
[1:36:48] hand why they recognize the god of
[1:36:51] Heaven had appeared before them in the
[1:36:53] form of his
[1:36:55] word we intellectual Americans set
[1:36:58] they'll rais in the day of the judgment
[1:37:00] and condemn this generation for what
[1:37:03] we've
[1:37:04] seen reminds me of a woman in Lille
[1:37:06] Kentucky not long ago had a little baby
[1:37:09] walking around in the 10 cent store and
[1:37:11] she was doing little things trying to
[1:37:12] get it to notice and the little baby
[1:37:14] kept staring straight out and finally
[1:37:16] she picked up a little bell anything
[1:37:18] that would ought to attract the
[1:37:19] attention of a little fellow about that
[1:37:21] size and she shook the Bell and the
[1:37:23] little fell just stared right straight
[1:37:24] in front and she begin screaming and
[1:37:26] fell over and some of the people come to
[1:37:27] help her she said oh no it can't be it
[1:37:30] can't be said what's the matter said the
[1:37:32] doctor said the baby was better said
[1:37:34] what's the matter with the baby lady
[1:37:36] said well it took a spell about 6 months
[1:37:39] ago that just sits and stares no matter
[1:37:42] what it is ought to attract the
[1:37:43] attention of that baby it won't attract
[1:37:46] its attention it just set some stairs
[1:37:48] the doctor told me he thought it was
[1:37:49] better and I brought it down here to
[1:37:51] pick up little gadgets that ought to
[1:37:53] attract that child and it doesn't he
[1:37:55] still sits and stares that's the way the
[1:37:57] church is getting God shook every
[1:38:00] promise in the Bible before
[1:38:02] them still we just sit and stare looking
[1:38:05] what show me a sign and it's going on
[1:38:08] all the time right around
[1:38:10] us bringing the presence of God it ought
[1:38:14] to illuminate us God made a promise he
[1:38:17] stands by that
[1:38:19] promise yes sir
[1:38:22] after Jesus had so proven his Messiah
[1:38:25] sign that he was that Messiah yet face
[1:38:29] of all that show us a sign see they
[1:38:32] didn't recognize they were staring
[1:38:34] straight ahead of them it wasn't in them
[1:38:36] to believe is my old southern mother
[1:38:39] used to say you can't get blood ey a
[1:38:41] turnup because he's none there still
[1:38:43] didn't recognize him so blinded by their
[1:38:46] Creeds and and and so forth that they
[1:38:49] had that day they never knew the
[1:38:51] scriptures of the promise because the
[1:38:53] Creeds had covered it
[1:38:55] up their Creeds and traditions of that
[1:38:58] day had covered up the scripture promise
[1:39:01] if they had been taught according to the
[1:39:03] scripture that that was supposed to be
[1:39:05] the sign that followed the Messiah how
[1:39:08] many believe that he come in his right
[1:39:09] sign sure he did he come according to
[1:39:13] the promise but they have been taught a
[1:39:15] Creed we believe in this and we believe
[1:39:17] in that all of them believe in God all
[1:39:18] of them today we Americans especially we
[1:39:21] think that we're going to be excused
[1:39:23] because we build big churches and have
[1:39:25] fine pastors and things remember if that
[1:39:27] was so God's unjust if he takes us in
[1:39:31] like that for Cain and Abel the two
[1:39:34] first worshippers outside of Eden they
[1:39:36] build an Al to the Lord both of them
[1:39:38] made sacrifice both of them offered
[1:39:40] gifts both of them prayed but one was
[1:39:42] right and the other was
[1:39:44] wrong notice we must have the truth and
[1:39:47] the truth is God's word always now now
[1:39:51] the same today people become so blinded
[1:39:54] to say I say are you are you a Christian
[1:39:56] or I belong to certain certain things
[1:39:58] see that don't have nothing to do with
[1:40:00] it I ain't got nothing against that but
[1:40:02] that's not what I'm trying to tell you
[1:40:04] belong to any church you want to your
[1:40:06] brand don't make any difference I was
[1:40:08] telling a pastor this morning up in
[1:40:10] Colorado used to ride round up and so
[1:40:12] forth and I used to sit there my leg
[1:40:15] across the saddle like that and the
[1:40:17] troubles River uh Herford Association
[1:40:20] grazes a troubl from River Valley then
[1:40:22] you got up the top of the valley you got
[1:40:24] the the East and West for all the cattle
[1:40:26] from here up in the association grazes
[1:40:29] the West Fark and and the group that I
[1:40:31] was with graze the East Fark then they
[1:40:33] had the drift fence there to keep the
[1:40:35] cattle off of the private property and
[1:40:37] up into the mountains through the summer
[1:40:39] and we'd round the cattle up four or
[1:40:41] five different brands eight or 10
[1:40:42] different brands on the river would
[1:40:43] round up our cattle in the spring take
[1:40:45] him up there and I used to sit there my
[1:40:47] leg across the Horn of the satellite we
[1:40:49] got all the cattle is all branded and
[1:40:51] everything starting to back up on the
[1:40:52] pasture and the ranger stood there he
[1:40:55] was counting them as he went through and
[1:40:57] I noticed there's all kinds of Brands Mr
[1:41:00] Grimes had the the uh the the Diamond
[1:41:04] Bar and just above us had the turkey TR
[1:41:07] we had the old tripod and there
[1:41:09] different brands went through there but
[1:41:11] the the ranger didn't notice the
[1:41:13] brand he noticed the blood tag in the
[1:41:15] ear there was nothing could go on that
[1:41:17] pasture to keep the breeding Association
[1:41:20] that their cattle true to the breed
[1:41:22] nothing could go on there but a third
[1:41:24] bread Herford it had to be tagged in the
[1:41:27] ear by the blood Mark that's way it'll
[1:41:29] be at the Judgment he's not going to ask
[1:41:31] me if I was a a Methodist Baptist
[1:41:33] Presbyterian what brand I have won't
[1:41:35] mean nothing to him it's nothing but a
[1:41:37] born again bloodborn Christian of the
[1:41:40] blood of Jesus
[1:41:41] Christ that'll be what'll go in nothing
[1:41:44] less then that will go in now we want to
[1:41:47] remember remember that now when he not
[1:41:51] recognized his power is all is always
[1:41:55] not revealed when he's not recognized no
[1:41:57] matter how much God standing present
[1:41:59] you've got to believe it that's all like
[1:42:02] the woman with the blood
[1:42:03] issue all them people passing by and all
[1:42:05] of them stand up saying there goes a
[1:42:07] rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a
[1:42:09] Prophet this is the fanatic and all such
[1:42:11] as that but what happened this little
[1:42:14] woman had an issue of blood and she had
[1:42:16] heard about him and when she come down
[1:42:18] there regardless of what anybody said
[1:42:20] she recognized who he was and she said
[1:42:24] if I can only touch His
[1:42:26] Garment see and when that genuine faith
[1:42:30] in God became a positive thing to her
[1:42:34] what did it release it released his
[1:42:36] power to heal her it touched him in such
[1:42:40] a way he turned around and told her what
[1:42:42] was wrong with her and said your faith
[1:42:44] has saved you what did Faith other stand
[1:42:47] there might been sicker than she but you
[1:42:50] see she recognized his presence she know
[1:42:53] that was her opportunity if we could
[1:42:56] only do that tonight people if we could
[1:42:59] only realize that he's appearing to us
[1:43:02] in these meetings for one purpose that's
[1:43:04] to release our desires that we have in
[1:43:08] him to us but we've got to recognize his
[1:43:12] presence and now how you recognize his
[1:43:14] presence is when the promised word for
[1:43:17] this age is made manifest amen not the
[1:43:20] promised word of moses' age or any the
[1:43:23] other ages the promise of the word for
[1:43:25] this age now we find out he went right
[1:43:28] on and Jas a little fell up there with a
[1:43:30] dead daughter she he believed what he
[1:43:34] said was the truth now remember he was a
[1:43:36] priest and he was forbidden because he'
[1:43:38] been strictly told anybody that
[1:43:39] associated with him would be put out of
[1:43:41] the synagogue well whether he was put
[1:43:43] out or whether he wasn't he was
[1:43:45] satisfied that God was present in Christ
[1:43:49] and that was the word amen what did it
[1:43:52] do it release to him the resurrection
[1:43:54] power that was in him amen brought forth
[1:43:58] a girl that was dead and laid out
[1:44:01] because he recognized that God was in
[1:44:04] Christ and his presence was in his
[1:44:07] house but in the city where he was
[1:44:10] brought up at that same power was in him
[1:44:14] in the city where he was brought up at
[1:44:16] but uh they never recognized him his
[1:44:19] presence to them didn't mean nothing
[1:44:21] maybe some fanatic where is these things
[1:44:25] they tell me that you do so and so let
[1:44:27] me see you do them here haven't you
[1:44:29] heard that if there you bunch of
[1:44:31] Pentecostals and you people of you
[1:44:33] believe in Divine Healing here's so and
[1:44:35] so over here let me see you heal him
[1:44:38] that's that same old Evel the same one
[1:44:40] said if thou be the Son of God command
[1:44:43] these stones to be made bread the same
[1:44:45] old devil when he had his eyes covered
[1:44:47] up he hit him on the head with a stick
[1:44:48] and said now pass the stick one to the
[1:44:50] and said tell us who hits you and we'll
[1:44:52] believe you if you're a prophet you
[1:44:53] never you don't clown for anybody amen
[1:44:56] same one when he was on the cross said
[1:44:58] if thou be the Son of God come off the
[1:45:01] cross and prove that you're the Son of
[1:45:02] God he could have done it they paid him
[1:45:05] the greatest tribute he ever had there
[1:45:07] but they didn't know it they said he
[1:45:08] saved others himself he can't save if he
[1:45:11] would have saved himself he couldn't
[1:45:12] have saved others he gave himself so he
[1:45:15] could save others they didn't recognize
[1:45:18] the presence of God that's all now it
[1:45:21] releases the power to heal and what
[1:45:23] it'll release the power to open your
[1:45:25] eyes to recognize him or blind your eyes
[1:45:27] so you'll never recognize it what opens
[1:45:30] the eyes of one Clos the eyes of the
[1:45:32] unbeliever but the city they didn't have
[1:45:34] no confidence in him at the Pharisees
[1:45:37] house he invited him down at Simon a
[1:45:40] Pharisee and he made a great supper and
[1:45:42] Pharisee wanted to prove to him he was
[1:45:43] no Prophet so he was back there toasting
[1:45:46] with his glasses and his goblets and all
[1:45:48] the fine perfumes in the house and Jesus
[1:45:51] had got in past the foot wash flunky and
[1:45:54] had sat down here and dirty the stink of
[1:45:56] the the field on him where the animals
[1:45:59] have been along the path and his
[1:46:00] garments that's the reason they worh
[1:46:02] feet in them days and you see the first
[1:46:04] thing when you're invited to to home
[1:46:07] there in Palestine when they wore those
[1:46:08] sandals the first thing they did was to
[1:46:11] wash your feet and then give you
[1:46:13] something to walk on their carpets the
[1:46:14] great Persian rugs and things was
[1:46:16] beautiful and next thing they done they
[1:46:18] they give you some oil in your hand it's
[1:46:20] got out of a little apple it's found way
[1:46:22] in the mountain a rose Apple after the
[1:46:24] rose is gone it leavs the apple and fine
[1:46:26] perfumes and they they rub it over their
[1:46:28] face and that direct raise of the
[1:46:31] Palestinian sun is horrible and you see
[1:46:33] that pru an odor and and then when you
[1:46:37] do then the host comes to the door and
[1:46:40] he kisses them on the neck and makes
[1:46:41] them welcome how did them flunkies ever
[1:46:45] let Jesus get by without washing his
[1:46:47] feet or or giving him oil to anointing
[1:46:50] himself or even kissing welcome but
[1:46:53] there's a little prostitute out on the
[1:46:55] street all them religiousness there now
[1:46:58] the whole company did not recognize him
[1:47:00] and a little woman of ill Fame she
[1:47:02] looked in through the perhaps the gate
[1:47:04] and she seen him sitting like a
[1:47:06] Wallflower that's the way he is today
[1:47:08] amongst a bunch of religionist too a
[1:47:10] Wallflower unwelcome unwanted filth
[1:47:13] dirty Holy Roller they call him some
[1:47:16] kind of a a person that is in the right
[1:47:18] mind a fortune teller telepathy or some
[1:47:22] kind of an evil name but Jesus I'll get
[1:47:23] to it in a few minutes said speak a word
[1:47:25] against the son of man it shall be
[1:47:26] forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost has
[1:47:27] come to do the same thing one word will
[1:47:30] never be forgiven you but there that
[1:47:32] little woman SE needed service and she
[1:47:35] rushed in real quickly went and got an
[1:47:37] albaster box full of oil probably bought
[1:47:40] it with the money from her prostitution
[1:47:43] but what was it she might have thought
[1:47:44] he is a he is a prophet but I remember
[1:47:47] another woman in my fix another
[1:47:49] character like mine she had the
[1:47:51] opportunity she recognized him and she
[1:47:53] was
[1:47:54] forgiven up there at the well of SAR
[1:47:56] last night we talked of it and if I can
[1:47:59] only get to him I know who he is I'll do
[1:48:02] him a service if the rest of them I
[1:48:04] don't care what they do I'll do him a
[1:48:06] service I recognize he's the son of God
[1:48:09] she running she got real close to him
[1:48:11] and she felt so guilty that's her way a
[1:48:14] real pent of Sinner feels in his
[1:48:15] presence guilty and the tears begin to
[1:48:18] fall and she's trying to hide him and
[1:48:19] dropped on his feet she's go to
[1:48:20] anointing but the tears dropping on his
[1:48:23] feet and she began to wipe him and
[1:48:25] crying and and him with her hands and
[1:48:28] and his feet was all getting mused up
[1:48:31] with the dirt that was on it and and if
[1:48:34] you want to really believe it with a
[1:48:36] stink of the animals off the trail every
[1:48:38] one walked the same Trail and there it
[1:48:40] was the stink on him sitting there and
[1:48:42] her tears was dropped on his feet and
[1:48:43] she was trying to wipe them off and she
[1:48:45] had an old towel what is a woman's
[1:48:48] Beauty and honor is her hair
[1:48:50] that's the reason many of you women
[1:48:52] today cut it all off that's wrong she
[1:48:56] she tuck her hair and began to wash the
[1:48:58] his feet and wipe him her the her pretty
[1:49:01] hair taking the stink off of him upon
[1:49:04] herself bearing his reproach oh my
[1:49:08] that's when you recognize who's in your
[1:49:10] presence our sisters would have to
[1:49:12] almost stand on their head to get enough
[1:49:13] hair to do that so we there she washed
[1:49:16] his feet and wiped him with the hairs of
[1:49:18] her head and she kissed his feet and
[1:49:21] there old Simon standing back there said
[1:49:24] oh I can just see him blow up he didn't
[1:49:27] recognize who he was said I told you he
[1:49:29] wasn't a prophet if he was a prophet he'
[1:49:31] recognize what kind of a woman that is
[1:49:33] around him Jesus never moved a foot he
[1:49:35] just watched her and she was scared then
[1:49:38] after he got through she doing the
[1:49:40] service to him he looked over said Simon
[1:49:44] I've got something to say to
[1:49:47] you you invited me here
[1:49:50] you brought me here in other words a
[1:49:52] trump up his sleeve you want to show me
[1:49:55] off you want to prove that I wasn't what
[1:49:58] I
[1:49:59] am and you when you brought me here you
[1:50:01] should have had my feet washed but you
[1:50:03] never you should give me oil to anoint
[1:50:05] my head but you didn't you never kiss me
[1:50:07] welcome and this woman ever since I've
[1:50:10] been here has washed my feet with her
[1:50:12] tears and wiped him with a with her hair
[1:50:16] and constantly has kissed my feet since
[1:50:20] have been
[1:50:21] here I have something against you Simon
[1:50:24] then he turns to her I just imagine seen
[1:50:25] her stand there in her big pretty eyes
[1:50:28] all stained up in her face worse that
[1:50:30] grease and and dust off of the road on
[1:50:32] her face and she thinks now have I done
[1:50:35] wrong have I done wrong he said and I
[1:50:37] say unto her her sins which are many
[1:50:39] what was it she
[1:50:41] recognized she recognized her
[1:50:44] opportunity see she did it she did him a
[1:50:47] service the Pharisees didn't do it she
[1:50:50] he saw it and she recognized his
[1:50:53] presence and what did it do it washed
[1:50:56] what did it release to her
[1:50:58] forgiveness released to her forgiveness
[1:51:01] of her sins what did it do also it also
[1:51:05] released the power of God to show to
[1:51:07] them unbelievers that he was a prophet
[1:51:09] he know who she was amen it also
[1:51:12] released joy and power and eternal life
[1:51:16] it released that but the one who called
[1:51:20] CA a great huge nail to be droven them
[1:51:22] precious
[1:51:25] feet he never recognized the presence of
[1:51:28] God in him he also wanted to do some
[1:51:31] cheap trick for him some entertainment
[1:51:34] that's what the world wants today is a
[1:51:35] bunch of
[1:51:36] entertainment don't want the gospel they
[1:51:38] want to be
[1:51:39] entertained and S pilate said uh I'd
[1:51:43] like to desire some miracle from him or
[1:51:45] something like that bring him up here
[1:51:47] right in the presence of God and turned
[1:51:51] it down
[1:51:52] because what that he appreciated the the
[1:51:57] opinion of the public more than he
[1:52:00] appreciated having the opportunity to be
[1:52:02] in the presence of God what happened the
[1:52:06] woman was forgiven and given eternal
[1:52:08] life but he lost his mind and went inan
[1:52:11] and committed suicide by Drowning
[1:52:14] himself up in switzland now car so
[1:52:18] carried away with the poer opinion of
[1:52:20] that day that he was a BLB he just a
[1:52:22] make belief it wasn't really nothing to
[1:52:24] him he what did he do he forfeited it he
[1:52:28] forfeited his opportunity in the
[1:52:31] presence of God he could have been
[1:52:33] forgiven yes he said I have power to
[1:52:37] crucify you I have power to release you
[1:52:39] he said you have no powerless it comes
[1:52:41] from my father he ought to have known if
[1:52:44] he had know the scripture and him being
[1:52:46] a Jew should have known that but you see
[1:52:48] the Traditions had got being taught down
[1:52:50] that's the way it is today if he had
[1:52:52] only been taught right if a man had
[1:52:54] would have believed what the scriptures
[1:52:56] had said but his tradition got him off
[1:52:59] of it same as it is today people will
[1:53:01] take the real gospel where the Holy
[1:53:03] Ghost is coming in the power and glory
[1:53:05] of God releasing sinners from sin and
[1:53:07] making them free and baptizing them in
[1:53:09] the Holy Ghost and healing the sickness
[1:53:11] showing signs and wonders and people
[1:53:13] walkway H you know what my church please
[1:53:15] that's nonsense see you're forfeiting
[1:53:18] you're selling your birth rights amen
[1:53:21] another Esau so many get the same
[1:53:24] opportunity today to stand in his
[1:53:26] presence as they did then and still
[1:53:29] because of popular opinion they turn it
[1:53:32] down standing in the presence of God I
[1:53:36] wonder friend tonight if we people who
[1:53:40] are Christians in his presence and are
[1:53:42] sick if we don't turn down the
[1:53:46] opportunity to be
[1:53:48] healed but just believe believeing him
[1:53:50] will you claim to believe him don't
[1:53:53] recognize really his presence what he
[1:53:55] promised to do today Vindicated by the
[1:53:58] promise for the day Jesus was rebuking
[1:54:01] that generation for not believing his
[1:54:03] Messiah sign we see here he was rebuking
[1:54:06] him calling him a be elub they wanted
[1:54:09] him to do the sign of Moses maybe open
[1:54:11] the Red Sea they did want him to do the
[1:54:13] sign of David take the throne in the
[1:54:15] government but the old scripture said
[1:54:16] that he would do that he was to be a
[1:54:20] Prophet he's coming the king he was to
[1:54:23] be Prophet then and he done the sign
[1:54:26] that God said he would do in them days
[1:54:28] and they still was wanting him to do
[1:54:30] some sign that pleased
[1:54:32] them and I just wonder if we're not
[1:54:34] looking too farward ahead for something
[1:54:37] that's right by us wonder if it could be
[1:54:39] the same way if we could pass by our
[1:54:41] opportunity remember as the old types
[1:54:44] the types can never break the last sign
[1:54:48] According To Jesus he said as it was in
[1:54:51] the days of
[1:54:53] Sodom so shall it be in the days when
[1:54:56] the son of man not Son of God now when
[1:54:59] the son of man is being revealed look
[1:55:02] here where it's setting today friends I
[1:55:04] could tell you some things here was not
[1:55:06] right for me to tell you but it would
[1:55:08] startle you I want to ask you a little
[1:55:10] question while we stop before we
[1:55:11] continue on with this service just a few
[1:55:13] minutes I wonder if I could ask you this
[1:55:16] anyone knows that the world positionally
[1:55:19] everything's set in order for his coming
[1:55:23] earthquakes in diverse places the moon
[1:55:25] spitting out red blood or red volcanic
[1:55:27] all over Covenant as Jesus said watch
[1:55:29] for that sign in the last days sea a
[1:55:32] roar man's heart failing for fear and
[1:55:34] perplexed of time distress between the
[1:55:36] Nations look at the perversion on the
[1:55:39] move today look at it a 40% increase in
[1:55:44] California of
[1:55:45] homosexuals natural affections already
[1:55:48] lost amen look at all look at today how
[1:55:52] the people will stay home and call
[1:55:54] themselves Christians and listen to such
[1:55:56] characters as Pat Boon Elvis Presley
[1:55:58] Ernie Ford and those who sang hymns on
[1:56:01] Sunday and look at them things that look
[1:56:03] at them kissing them women and things
[1:56:05] out there when no man should ever kiss a
[1:56:07] woman till he's married to her that's
[1:56:09] male and female glands Crossing will it
[1:56:11] be wherever it may be it's wrong it's
[1:56:13] potentially a sex act when male and
[1:56:16] female glands touch it's a sex act it's
[1:56:19] a man kiss a man in a mouth and make him
[1:56:21] vomit or a woman a woman why is the
[1:56:23] different it's a it's sex act
[1:56:26] potentially that's right a type of
[1:56:28] Christ kissing his bride you should
[1:56:31] never do that but look at today all
[1:56:33] these movies and things if one big con
[1:56:35] glamor of kissing and hugging it's
[1:56:37] absolutely almost public adultery
[1:56:39] everywhere and the people so blind they
[1:56:41] don't see it amen that's right
[1:56:45] everything's in a Sodom condition
[1:56:47] sodomite everywhere is the Bible said so
[1:56:50] many things look at this days what he
[1:56:51] said would take place look at the
[1:56:54] promises that he made would take place
[1:56:55] this day and then examine it of what's
[1:56:57] going on and see where we're at then you
[1:57:00] see whether he's still in his word or
[1:57:01] not they wanted to see the sign of Moses
[1:57:04] It's The Sign of David that was not for
[1:57:07] their age it was promised for Moses age
[1:57:09] and them age the promise for this age
[1:57:11] has to come to pass he had clearly
[1:57:14] showed them he by the scripture and
[1:57:16] invited them to search the scripture to
[1:57:18] see what day they we're living in he's
[1:57:21] doing the same thing right now search
[1:57:23] the scripture you who believe the Bible
[1:57:26] what's supposed to take place right here
[1:57:28] before he's coming look at the world in
[1:57:30] the position now that's the world look
[1:57:32] at the church where it is look where
[1:57:34] it's at Falling Away lukewarm lady OA
[1:57:38] putting out the word whole thing going
[1:57:40] into the big Council of churches the
[1:57:42] World Council of churches forming the
[1:57:44] mark of the beast which a Bible
[1:57:46] proclaims is wrong and all those things
[1:57:48] and yet the Protestants driving right
[1:57:50] into it headlong not knowing the
[1:57:52] scripture their tradition oh they're
[1:57:54] wanting a a a a Power Man and they'll go
[1:57:58] to get one they'll see that they get it
[1:58:00] he had look but Jesus had perfectly
[1:58:04] declared himself exactly who he was and
[1:58:07] it proved to them who he was and his age
[1:58:10] and the same thing today now look at
[1:58:12] let's take that setting of Luke 17 as it
[1:58:15] was in the days of
[1:58:17] Sodom look at the world
[1:58:19] look at the church a sodomite condition
[1:58:22] look where lot was at when those men
[1:58:25] even tried to tried to press in the door
[1:58:27] to these angels these men notice look
[1:58:31] here there has look Abraham was up on
[1:58:34] the mountain he wasn't in Sodom that's a
[1:58:38] type there's always three classes of
[1:58:39] people in a religious gather Believers
[1:58:42] make Believers and unbelievers always
[1:58:45] them three and there they was there's
[1:58:46] the unbelieving sodomite the make
[1:58:48] believer a lot and Abraham the elected
[1:58:50] church now watch their Messengers in
[1:58:53] that day two Messengers went down and
[1:58:55] preached to Sodom they didn't do any
[1:58:57] Miracles only just smot him blind the
[1:58:59] preaching of the word does that but
[1:59:01] watch what kind of a miracle this Angel
[1:59:02] did that stayed with Abraham amen he had
[1:59:05] his back turned and told Abraham his
[1:59:07] name had been changed called him Abraham
[1:59:09] instead of Abram he could not have the
[1:59:12] baby till his name was changed neither
[1:59:14] Sarah he told him what their name was
[1:59:17] the angel told him that and he said and
[1:59:20] he was going to visit Sarah according to
[1:59:22] the time of life and Sarah laughed about
[1:59:25] it and when Sarah laugh the man with his
[1:59:28] back turned a man eating flesh of the
[1:59:30] calf and drinking the milk from the cow
[1:59:33] and eating bread a man dust on his
[1:59:35] clothes a traveler was God
[1:59:39] himself and Abraham recognized it
[1:59:42] because he knew the thoughts that was in
[1:59:43] Sarah's heart behind him he said why did
[1:59:46] Sarah say within herself how can these
[1:59:48] things be is anything too hard for God
[1:59:51] and Sarah run out and tonight he said
[1:59:53] yes but you did now he' have tucked
[1:59:54] Sarah's life right there but for the dis
[1:59:57] but see she's a part of Abraham and our
[1:59:59] unbelief and his great manifestation in
[2:00:01] this hour We're part of Christ you just
[2:00:05] see he he has to keep it now notied
[2:00:09] there has never been a time in history
[2:00:12] of the church
[2:00:14] age and I know of one real student I'm
[2:00:17] talking to a historian
[2:00:20] there's never been I asked any student
[2:00:22] of the Bible to tell me one man that was
[2:00:25] ever sent to the church age in this
[2:00:27] church since the crucifixion of Christ a
[2:00:30] worldwide Ministry that his name ever
[2:00:32] ended up with h m like a b r a h until
[2:00:36] this
[2:00:37] day amen sanky finny Moody Knox Calvin
[2:00:41] but wherever was there gr a m the four
[2:00:45] Billy Graham the great evangelist out
[2:00:47] there with the denominations is in
[2:00:50] Sodom Hallelujah
[2:00:52] never there's a modern old Roberts out
[2:00:55] there with the Pentecostals the same
[2:00:57] thing you know that amen but h a m now g

[2:01:06] a h a m is seven
[2:01:08] letters six is man's number man's
[2:01:11] organization man's doing but a b r a h a
[2:01:14] m is seven letters now notice in the
[2:01:18] church Church elected is pulled out not
[2:01:20] those denominations but the elected
[2:01:22] churches stand out it's to get a
[2:01:24] messenger too in this last days amen
[2:01:27] what's going on down there what's going
[2:01:31] on up here compare it with what Jesus
[2:01:33] said never be for in history as we ever
[2:01:36] said and the same signs that would be
[2:01:39] done amen don't you realize friends and
[2:01:42] recognize it's God come down in the
[2:01:46] gospel in his
[2:01:47] people make making yourself known can't
[2:01:50] you recognize the hour we're living in
[2:01:53] have we just got ourselves off to clap
[2:01:55] our hands a little bit play the piano
[2:01:56] and recite this and and got away from
[2:01:59] the word you we're that blind to it
[2:02:02] surely we're not let's recognize the
[2:02:05] hour that we're living
[2:02:06] in Peter Nathan and Nathaniel rather in
[2:02:11] the woman they recognize it they um they
[2:02:15] they recognize his sign Messiah sign
[2:02:17] same now as these things I'm saying
[2:02:19] then to this age Jesus said now watch
[2:02:22] He's referring back now telling them of
[2:02:25] an age God in any age when he sent his
[2:02:28] message which was his word and
[2:02:30] identified it to that age the people
[2:02:33] that believed it it was a great time for
[2:02:35] him the people who did not believe it
[2:02:37] went into chaos it's always been like in
[2:02:40] the days of Jesus same thing watch him
[2:02:42] standing here now he
[2:02:44] said as it was in the days of Jonas
[2:02:49] Jonah for as Jonah was in the belly of
[2:02:52] the whale three days and night so much
[2:02:53] the son of man he said a wicked and an
[2:02:56] adulter this generation will seek after
[2:02:58] a sign now you know what I think he was
[2:03:01] doing he was prophesying a wicked an
[2:03:05] adulter in his generation I wonder if
[2:03:08] any man in his right mind could deny
[2:03:11] that we're not living in a weak and an
[2:03:13] adulter inous generation when homosexual
[2:03:16] perversion and the divorce rates in
[2:03:19] America is higher than any other nation

[2:03:30] divorced around taking the whole thing
[2:03:32] around uh in 10 years of

[2:03:38] again marry again divorce marry again
[2:03:41] they were eating drinking marrying wives
[2:03:43] and given in
[2:03:44] marriage look at the hour we're living
[2:03:46] in when was it ever in such a chaos oh
[2:03:48] Wicked and an adulterate generation will
[2:03:51] seek after sign notice and they will
[2:03:54] receive a sign amen what this
[2:03:57] generation for as Jonah was in the belly
[2:04:00] of the whale three days and nights the
[2:04:02] son of man must be in the heart of the
[2:04:03] earth three days and night what sign
[2:04:06] will that Wicked and adulterous
[2:04:08] generation receive the sign of the
[2:04:10] Resurrection amen and today after 2,000
[2:04:14] years we still see Jesus Christ in the
[2:04:18] power of His Resurrection standing Among
[2:04:20] Us doing the things that he did then and
[2:04:22] promised to
[2:04:23] do a wicked and an adulterous generation
[2:04:27] will seek after a sign always wantan to
[2:04:29] show me this and if you can do this do
[2:04:31] this they'll get it the sign of the
[2:04:33] Resurrection he's the same yesterday
[2:04:35] today and
[2:04:36] forever the word made manifest dwelling
[2:04:40] Among Us how we should thank God for his
[2:04:43] great sign notice he referred to
[2:04:45] something else there he said and as the
[2:04:47] queen of the South shall rise R up
[2:04:49] that's the Queen of Sheba listen close
[2:04:51] now the queen of the South shall rise up
[2:04:54] in the Judgment with this generation and
[2:04:56] shall condemn
[2:04:57] it for she came from the utmost parts of
[2:05:01] the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[2:05:04] and behold or greater than Solomon is
[2:05:06] year notice let's refer to that a few
[2:05:09] minutes he was reading the same Bible we
[2:05:11] read about Jonah and he's reading about
[2:05:13] Solomon now when Solomon's Age come on
[2:05:16] he had a he had a gift of deser
[2:05:19] and all the people the whole nation
[2:05:22] believed it everyone was one heart and
[2:05:24] one Accord everybody believed it if
[2:05:27] everybody tonight if all America would
[2:05:29] just turn back to God and believe God
[2:05:33] it's the best assurance that we have
[2:05:35] it'll be all the bomb shellers and
[2:05:37] everything else nobody fool with Solomon
[2:05:40] they were afraid of him because he was A
[2:05:44] Gifted Man and the people believed him
[2:05:46] so he was sent from god Till They made
[2:05:49] him their King yes all the nations
[2:05:52] feared him not because of their military
[2:05:55] power but because God was with them and
[2:05:59] if this nation who claims to be
[2:06:01] Christianity if it could only all of
[2:06:03] them together playing around this great
[2:06:07] gift that's been given us in this last
[2:06:09] days of Holy Spirit of God upon the
[2:06:12] church not the Creed the spirit of God
[2:06:16] not by power not by might but by my
[2:06:18] Spirit saith
[2:06:19] God the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ in form
[2:06:23] of spirit upon us the same yesterday
[2:06:25] today and forever making this word live
[2:06:28] what he said it would
[2:06:29] do watch closely now all the news went
[2:06:33] out through the world they didn't have
[2:06:35] television and radio and things in them
[2:06:37] days so it went from lip to ear after a
[2:06:40] while the great Caravans came plumbed
[2:06:42] down across the Sahara Desert which is a
[2:06:45] 3 month travel from Palestine down to
[2:06:48] where where she lived and Faith cometh
[2:06:51] by what hearing hearing the word of God
[2:06:54] and she had heard about this great
[2:06:55] meeting they were having up there and
[2:06:57] any time a caravan come from that way
[2:07:00] she' questioned had did you come through
[2:07:02] Palestine yes oh what about that oh it's
[2:07:05] it's beyond anything you never seen such
[2:07:08] discernment and it's just like a god
[2:07:11] sitting there their God is representing
[2:07:13] a man called Solomon well Faith cometh
[2:07:16] by hearing the little queen's heart
[2:07:18] begin to hunger to go up and find out
[2:07:20] about it see she was ordained to life
[2:07:24] notice now the first thing to do now her
[2:07:26] being a pagan she had to go get
[2:07:28] permission from her priest to go so I
[2:07:31] can imagine s go over to a priest and
[2:07:33] say Holy Father uh I hear they're having
[2:07:36] a great Revival up there in in Palestine
[2:07:38] I like permission to go up and see for
[2:07:40] myself now my child now you don't want
[2:07:44] to get mixed up and after all we're not
[2:07:46] cooperating in that Revival so you you
[2:07:48] you cannot go see that's just a bunch of
[2:07:50] nonsense there's there's nothing to it
[2:07:52] then people claim they've come through a
[2:07:54] red sea and they've done all this
[2:07:56] there's nothing to it if there was
[2:07:57] anything like that happening it would be
[2:07:59] right you're in our
[2:08:01] church we still got pagans so we find
[2:08:05] out that she began to hunger she said
[2:08:09] now look she said they tell me that
[2:08:12] their God up there is represented in a
[2:08:14] human being and his wisdom is beyond
[2:08:17] anything is deser is wonderful oh
[2:08:20] there's nothing to that she said but I
[2:08:23] I'm well look you're a queen you can't
[2:08:25] be Associated a bunch of people like
[2:08:27] that that's you can't do that that bunch
[2:08:30] of people knowing all the world is
[2:08:31] religious Fanatics you can't do that but
[2:08:33] you see when God goes to dealing with a
[2:08:36] human heart all right there's nothing
[2:08:37] going to stop it husband wife children
[2:08:41] Pastor nothing else can stop it when a
[2:08:43] person's really hungering for God
[2:08:45] they're going
[2:08:46] anyhow so she got ready to make ready
[2:08:49] well he'd say well I'll just give you I
[2:08:51] have to excommunicate you from our
[2:08:53] fellowship well you can just do that I'm
[2:08:55] going anyhow I'm going to find out for
[2:08:57] myself about all this and see she
[2:08:59] brought up Scrolls and she' read what
[2:09:01] Jehovah should be about His prophets and
[2:09:03] what he must do how that the word of God
[2:09:05] would make manifest how it would know
[2:09:07] these things when it was represented
[2:09:09] veiled in human flesh what it would do
[2:09:11] and she' read all these things so um I'd
[2:09:15] hear him say Well look our book says
[2:09:17] this he said yes look
[2:09:19] I my great great grandmother stood in
[2:09:22] before them same Idols she stood and
[2:09:24] said prayers day after day there never
[2:09:26] was one move one mutter or nothing else
[2:09:30] and I'm tired this old dead Farm I want
[2:09:33] to go see if there is a living God it's
[2:09:36] too bad we Ain got more of them queens
[2:09:37] today so she got ready to go now when
[2:09:41] she come to this spot where she must go
[2:09:44] now remember she had a great difficulty
[2:09:48] it wasn't as easy as it would be to you
[2:09:52] now notice what she had to do here's
[2:09:54] another thing I don't want to leave out
[2:09:56] she said this I'm going up there and I'm
[2:09:58] going to take some money I'm going to
[2:09:59] take some gifts and if it is the truth
[2:10:02] I'm going to support it if it isn't the
[2:10:04] truth then I can bring my money back
[2:10:07] that woman could teach
[2:10:08] Pentecostals yes sir support things out
[2:10:11] there laugh and make fun of Divine
[2:10:12] Healing and yet you support the radio
[2:10:14] programs instead of your own church
[2:10:16] that's right life and make fun of the
[2:10:17] very things you believe in but she said
[2:10:20] I'll take it and if it isn't right I can
[2:10:21] bring it back I remember with all this
[2:10:24] wealth on there on these camels and now
[2:10:27] remember the fleet Riders of ishma was
[2:10:30] Desert robbers is out there what an easy
[2:10:32] thing would have been for them to fall
[2:10:34] in on on this prey and why they would
[2:10:37] have kill them few Unix was with her
[2:10:40] took that money and been gone but
[2:10:42] there's something about it when you are
[2:10:44] really determined and God's revealing
[2:10:46] himself you're determined to see Christ
[2:10:49] there's no danger before you you don't
[2:10:51] even pay any attention the doctor says
[2:10:53] you're going to die you don't even
[2:10:55] notice
[2:10:56] it when you're pressing you know there's
[2:10:58] something there something down in our
[2:11:01] heart burning in faith this
[2:11:04] God months to travel over Sahara desert
[2:11:08] not in an airconditioned Cadillac no no
[2:11:11] she took three months across the Sahara
[2:11:14] Desert maybe traveling by Night reading
[2:11:16] the Scrolls and always in the daytime
[2:11:19] until she arrived now no wonder Jesus
[2:11:22] said she'll stand in the last days and
[2:11:24] condemn this generation for some of them
[2:11:27] won't walk across the street and are
[2:11:29] greater than Solomon is year the Holy
[2:11:31] Spirit
[2:11:32] himself no wonder she'll raise in the
[2:11:35] last days and condemn the
[2:11:37] generation watch she finally arrived she
[2:11:41] didn't come like many people some people
[2:11:43] come to a strange meeting she come and
[2:11:46] took her camels and went out into the
[2:11:48] the courtyard put up her tents and she
[2:11:50] was going to stay there till she's
[2:11:52] convinced most people will come except
[2:11:55] maybe 5 minutes maybe 25 soon as an
[2:11:58] evangelist or somebody says something
[2:12:00] that's contrary to what she she thinks
[2:12:02] that her Creed says or her his Creed out
[2:12:04] they
[2:12:05] go not even manners no wonder she'll
[2:12:09] condemn this generation she come to stay
[2:12:12] till she was convinced I can imagine the
[2:12:15] first service that morning when the
[2:12:16] trumpets all sounded Pastor Solomon came
[2:12:19] out she may have been sitting way back
[2:12:21] at the bank she said now I'll see for
[2:12:23] myself I know that's what Jehovah was
[2:12:24] supposed to be man can make claims but
[2:12:26] I'll find out so she sat there that day
[2:12:30] and she watched and she seen everyone
[2:12:32] coming to the platform she seen that
[2:12:34] discernment was perfect finally let's
[2:12:37] say her prayer card was called which
[2:12:39] probably wasn't but her time come to
[2:12:41] come before Solon and the Bible said
[2:12:44] that when she come to stand before Solon
[2:12:46] that God let Solon know all her Secrets
[2:12:50] there was nothing hid then the miracle
[2:12:53] was done on her then she turned to the
[2:12:56] audience and she said all these things
[2:12:58] that I have heard is true and it's even
[2:13:00] greater than I heard about see oh there
[2:13:03] was more more life left in her her
[2:13:06] breath was taken from her CU sheer was a
[2:13:08] man that didn't know her right a
[2:13:12] stranger reveal the things that she
[2:13:14] wanted to
[2:13:15] know oh and Jesus standing there which
[2:13:19] was more than Solomon he was the
[2:13:22] fullness of the godhead bodily he was a
[2:13:25] spant born son of God and clothed up on
[2:13:29] him and Jehovah himself manifested in
[2:13:32] the flesh amen and Yu was stand there in
[2:13:34] the fullness and they said they wouldn't
[2:13:37] believe him a greater discernment see he
[2:13:40] was Solomon plus David plus all the rest
[2:13:43] of them was all in him all the prophets
[2:13:46] was wound up in him a greater than
[2:13:48] Solomon and to even at that day he said
[2:13:50] if you speak them words against me I'll
[2:13:52] forgive you but when the Holy Ghost
[2:13:54] comes it'll be greater than it is now
[2:13:57] more condemnation and here we stand
[2:13:59] today seeing that very same God do the
[2:14:03] very same
[2:14:05] thing amen I believe she'll rise in the
[2:14:08] day of judgment and condemn this
[2:14:11] generation because she
[2:14:15] repented and believed the message that
[2:14:18] Solomon was preaching and believed on
[2:14:20] God she's seen something real you know
[2:14:23] what's the trouble today there's people
[2:14:26] many people with a people that's belongs
[2:14:29] and just go to church and have a Creed
[2:14:32] see they've seen so much just fault so
[2:14:35] much just statues and so much of big
[2:14:38] fine buildings and and we let's not
[2:14:41] let's not never get off in that kind of
[2:14:42] a tantrum see God don't dwell in big
[2:14:44] buildings he dwells in your heart amen
[2:14:47] see God don't dwell in intellectual
[2:14:49] education he's far from it he dwells in
[2:14:52] humility in your heart he dwells in his
[2:14:55] word and his word comes into your heart
[2:14:57] and speaks itself out and de he
[2:14:59] interprets his own word through you he's
[2:15:01] trying to find somebody and get a hold
[2:15:03] up to show that he's still
[2:15:06] God and he's he'll do that if he can
[2:15:08] just get somebody he can speak you if
[2:15:10] you can get another woman with a blood
[2:15:11] issue he can still speak the same thing
[2:15:14] he can still do the same thing making no
[2:15:16] and declaring we're in the presence of
[2:15:18] God not recognize it reminds a little
[2:15:21] story I might have told it to you once I
[2:15:22] don't know to Bear right now as you all
[2:15:25] know I I hunt big game and I was up in
[2:15:29] the Northwoods used to go up there
[2:15:30] hunting all the time and I had a friend
[2:15:32] up there named Burt call he was a fine
[2:15:35] Hunter about a half Indian never had to
[2:15:37] worry about him he wasn't going to get
[2:15:38] lost and we really were Chums but that
[2:15:40] was the wickedest man the heart I ever
[2:15:42] seen he just had no heart at all he used
[2:15:45] to shoot little fawns that's little baby
[2:15:46] deers just a make me feel bad and he'd
[2:15:49] say all you preachers you're chicken
[2:15:51] hearted Billy you'd be a good Hunter if
[2:15:52] you wasn't a preacher I said you're too
[2:15:54] chicken-hearted I said Bert that's not
[2:15:56] chicken harded now it's all right to
[2:15:57] kill a fawn if the law says so Abraham
[2:16:00] killed a calf and fed it to God it ain't
[2:16:02] the size of it or the sex of it but it's
[2:16:04] just to be evil with it and he would
[2:16:07] just shoot them pawns and just laugh
[2:16:09] make laugh because I felt bad about it
[2:16:12] well now he he did that and one year I
[2:16:15] went up there and he invent himself a
[2:16:17] little whistle and he could blow like a
[2:16:18] little fwn hot calls you know for his
[2:16:21] mama and so he said hey Billy before we
[2:16:24] start this morning said I want to show
[2:16:26] you something I got and he showed it to
[2:16:27] me I said B you wouldn't use something
[2:16:29] like that he said oh get next to
[2:16:31] yourself and a fell had eyes is like a
[2:16:33] lizard like some of these women try to
[2:16:35] paint their eyes you know like that he
[2:16:37] all look at me them lizard looking eyes
[2:16:38] and I it almost scared me and um and I
[2:16:42] said to Bert don't do that he said oh
[2:16:44] you chicken-hearted preachers so we was
[2:16:46] August a little late getting up that
[2:16:48] time and those Northern white tail your
[2:16:50] mule de here he'll walk up to you but
[2:16:52] not one of them guys whenever he's been
[2:16:54] shot at he's a you talk about Houdini
[2:16:57] being The Escape Artist he's an amateur
[2:16:58] to them so it was late and they' been
[2:17:00] shot at and them deer would hiding down
[2:17:03] feeding it night in the Moonlight and
[2:17:04] bedding out in the day we walked all the
[2:17:07] way up Old Jefferson Notch clb up to
[2:17:08] Mount Washington was about 6 Ines snow
[2:17:11] on the ground good tracking weather
[2:17:12] never even seen one track he said what
[2:17:15] do you think Billy I said you all scared
[2:17:17] them all out of
[2:17:18] the old machine guns you're shooting and
[2:17:19] so we went on after a while about 11:00
[2:17:23] we always carried a a little one of
[2:17:25] those thermos bottles full of hot
[2:17:27] chocolate it's if you get hert or
[2:17:28] something other that's stimulation and a
[2:17:31] sandwich so it's about 11 11:30 I
[2:17:33] suppose we come to an opening about the
[2:17:35] size of this Arena here this building
[2:17:38] and um no Timber so he just kind of sat
[2:17:41] down set his rif up against the tree
[2:17:43] started reaching back here and I thought
[2:17:44] he was going back to get his to get his
[2:17:46] thermos spot I thought well we'll eat
[2:17:48] usually we get up top of the mountain
[2:17:49] and eat and one go one way and one
[2:17:51] another and come back and we know the
[2:17:53] way around good and if we got a deer we
[2:17:55] just hung it up then we know went help
[2:17:57] each other get him in so I thought he
[2:17:58] just going to eat his lunch and we'd
[2:17:59] park because he was almost up the timber
[2:18:01] line so I he reached back and I started
[2:18:03] getting for my thermos bottle get my
[2:18:06] chocolate and started getting out like
[2:18:08] that and he pulled that little whistle
[2:18:09] out of his pocket and he gave it a big
[2:18:12] blow like that looked at me with them
[2:18:14] lizard looking eyes again and blowed
[2:18:16] that whistle and when he did just about
[2:18:18] far as across this building a great big
[2:18:20] dough stood up now if some of the our
[2:18:23] sisters might not know the D is a mother
[2:18:25] deer and see that whistle was a baby and
[2:18:29] it cried and this big door stood up
[2:18:33] right about 11:00 in the day anyone
[2:18:34] hunts deers knows that's a bad time
[2:18:37] they're bedded so she stood up and
[2:18:39] looked around I could see just this
[2:18:41] plane he looked back at me and he blowed
[2:18:44] again and instead of of running she
[2:18:48] walked right out into that open now
[2:18:50] that's unusual they won't do that any
[2:18:53] hunter knows that and they and they
[2:18:55] won't do that but she walked out there
[2:18:57] why she was a mother that was a baby it
[2:19:01] was it just borned into her to be a
[2:19:03] mother and that baby and Bert looked
[2:19:05] down pull that bolt back let it down on
[2:19:09] that 306 and he was a dead shot I see
[2:19:13] him level down like this and I know he'd
[2:19:16] blow her faithful heart Plumb through
[2:19:17] both sides 180 grain mushroom bullet and
[2:19:21] I thought how can you do it Bert how can
[2:19:23] you be so evil to call that mother deer
[2:19:25] right out there and then shoot her heart
[2:19:27] right out of her and her trying to find
[2:19:28] her baby how can you be so brutal as to
[2:19:31] do that I was thinking that and I seem
[2:19:33] level down like that I could I couldn't
[2:19:34] look at it it's just too much I guess I
[2:19:36] am chicken harded I just turned my back
[2:19:39] I thought God how can you do it how can
[2:19:40] a human being be that mean to do that
[2:19:43] just to shoot that poor faithful
[2:19:45] mother's heart right out of her now she
[2:19:47] was wasn't trying to act on she wasn't
[2:19:48] putting on a show she was a mother she
[2:19:52] seen the hunter when he throwed that gun
[2:19:53] down but did she run no sir her baby was
[2:19:56] in trouble and she was trying to find
[2:19:58] her baby I turned my back as I said and
[2:20:01] started I said Lord God how can you do
[2:20:03] it I noticed it waited waited the gun
[2:20:06] didn't fire I turned around and looked
[2:20:09] the gun was going like this he couldn't
[2:20:11] hold it no more he turned around that
[2:20:13] big old lizard eyes had changed tears
[2:20:15] had run off his cheek you threw the gun
[2:20:18] on the bank you said Billy I've had
[2:20:19] enough of it lead me to that Jesus

[2:20:41] she standing right in the face of death
[2:20:42] nor just any minute that bullet would
