So let let's remember him and uh that uh all pain be taken away and and he would be in comfort and and comfort the family and and let the will of the Lord be done. We we want him to be healed but whatever God wants wants to do. So we'll keep him in prayer and also the the people that are traveling also for traveling mercies and uh being the the great communion night tonight. you know that I was thinking at work about this communion week and I was thinking that uh the prophet said remember his death and the prophet taught us that Jesus died at the garden of Gethsemane. He gave up his will, right? His human will because he had a will because he said, "Not my will but thy will be done." And he he was able in the garden of Gethsemane, he died to that will to that human will. So he when he went to the cross, he was already dead in his human will. He was already dead. That's why the that's why he could be so obedient. It was the the God that was in them took over. And really, that's what we got to come to. We got to come to that where we can be able to die to our human will. That God because we have an attribute inside of us like the woman at the well. We have an attribute and that attribute is going to take over when we can die to our human will. And that attribute is the word of God inside of us. So help us. Help us here this evening, Lord. We we're in a we're in great expectation like this like this morning. We're hearing that something's going to happen. You know that it's the lull before the storm. So help us help us to get ready for what's coming. And uh let's not be scared. Let's let's take courage. We're a very privileged people. So with that, let's let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, Almighty God, I come to thee this evening here. There's a great communion night, Lord, knowing that we have to come to a death, Lord. Even I heard the the prophet said, "The Brandom tabernacle needs a killing along with me in it." He wasn't talking about a physical death. He's talking about what Jesus went through in the garden of Gethsemane, which is his will. We need to let go of our human wills that your word can take over our lives. Oh God, we love you, Lord. We pray for uh brother words, Lord, that you would help him, Lord. Make him comfortable, take away all pain, Lord, and give him peace in his heart. And the loved ones are ones that are hurting. I know sister Barbara loves him a lot. Give her peace, Lord. I pray thee, Lord, that everything is going to be done according to your will, Lord. We love you and we appreciate you, Lord. We want to thank you for giving Sister Heather a job, Lord. I was so happy when I heard that. Thank you, Father. We love you and appreciate you. Be with us here this evening, Lord. Be with brother uh Israel. Whatever you have for us tonight, Lord, we're here with open hearts, Lord. And we know that your will is going to be done. This great communion night. Prophet also taught us that it's a it's an inventory time to check up on ourselves, Lord. That to make things right, Lord, and and try to live right for you, Lord. That our wills can be disappeared, Lord. That's my that's my desire, Lord. That my own human will would be done away with and that germ that's inside of me would come forth and take over, Lord. That's my desire. Thank you, Lord. We bless you. We give you honor and glory, Lord. We ask all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. [Music] Mine's off.

My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood his mercy reigns. It's unending love. Amazing grace. The Lord has promised good to me. His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion.

A glorious day that'll be. What a day that'll be when my Jesus I shall see. And when I look upon his face, the one who saved me by his grace. And he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land. Oh, what a day. Glorious day that'll be. There'll be no sorrow there. No more burdens to bear. There will be no sorrow there.

So, I have a good friend here, a good friend to this church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A good friend in the good in the Lord, a minister, Brother Armando Rivera. And he brought with him another good friend of mine, my old friend, Brother Alex Moreno. God bless you. Stand, Brother Alex. He's from the Sacramento area in California. It's been many, many years. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to hear that he's still on the battlefield for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask brother Arando come to come and greet you and uh just say hello. And as he comes, let's give the Lord a hand of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I was reading the prophet said when you are in the church, you have protection. &gt;&gt; He said there is protection when you are in the church. &gt;&gt; So, we have protection. &gt;&gt; If we're not in the church, then we are without protection. &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, we are protected. &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's good to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I just stay here. Amen. So that's his wife and some of the children coming in. God bless them richly. Amen. We're going to listen to a portion of the message um desperations starting from paragraph 43 to 155. And um I want to sing a little bit of this song. We'll stand. It's kind of a hand clapping song. I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. Amen. I'm on [Music] for my Lord. Yes, I am. Oh, I'm on the battlefield. Oh, my Lord. One day I promise him that I I'm going to serve him. Oh, I'm on battlefield for my Lord. Yes, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. And I promised him that I would serve him for the rest of my life on the battlefield. for my Lord. Won't you play that? [Music] [Music] [Music] One more time. Let me hear you sing it with all your heart. I for the Lord. I'm fighting for the Lord. I'm fighting for the Lord and I promise him that I I'm going to serve him until I die. I'm on the battlefield for my Lord. Amen. You ever get a song in your spirit and you just got to let it out? That one was in my spirit, so I had to let it out. So, God bless you. Um, we're going to go right to this message here. Brother Random is taking the scripture in Jeremiah chapter 29. So, if you want to turn there as we prepare to go there and we'll sing that old hymn that always introduced the prophet. It's the dinner bell for the believer. &gt;&gt; Only believe. Brother Al stole used to say that it's the dinner bell for the believer. Ding ding ding. When you hear only believe, amen, you're going to hear the word of the Lord. Remember he used to say that. Brother Alto stole say only. [Music] And all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. [Music] All believe. All things are possible. Only Lord I believe. And Lord I believe. [Music] Lord I &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. [Music] Lord, [Music] God bless you. You may be seated, brother. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to give you my text while you're you're you're turning. My text tonight is desperations. And uh desperation. And now you know what desperations is. And now we're going to read from Jeremiah the 29th chapter, the 10th verse. For thus saeth the Lord, that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to turn to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you. Isn't that sweet? Sayaeth the Lord. though thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you accepted end. Then shall you call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart. and I will be found of you, sayaeth the Lord, and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all nations, and from all the places where I have drove you, sayaeth the Lord, and will bring you again unto unto the place which I cause you to be carried away captive back to Pentecost. I put that in myself. It doesn't say that's what I was meaning to the church. Luke 16 again 15th verse all the 16th verse. The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it. every man presses into it. Not just simply walks into it easily, but it's got to be pressed into. &gt;&gt; See, now when you seek me with all your heart, then I'll be found. &gt;&gt; And he promised that he would return and bring the people from scattered all over the earth after those seven years back into Jerusalem where they left from. And he did it just that way. That's right. Now, we're going to talk on on desperations for a few minutes now. Usually, it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation. &gt;&gt; It's too bad it has to do that. &gt;&gt; But human beings are so slothful in their mind that it takes an emergency. Something arises. And when they do, then it throws them into that desperation. And really in doing that, in desperation, it brings out that real thing that you are. &gt;&gt; It shows what you're made out of in the time of desperation. It usually pulls out all the good things that's in you. In time of death, I've heard people when they know they were dying and things that they kept secret all their life, they in desperation, they were trying to confess it. See, and trying take this and make it right. Go, please go do See, in desperation, they ought to have done that beforehand. See, not wait till the time of emergency. Will you do so and so for me? The emergency causes desperation when we ought to do it without the emergency. Now, we notice tonight that we're taking the symbols of the Passover and the Passover was taken in emergency in times of desperation. You notice in in uh Exodus the 12th chapter and the 11th verse of the 12th chapter, I believe it is, it says, "Eat this Passover with the shoes on your feet, with your loins girded up and with the staff in your hand. See, you're eating in desperation." They had seen the great hand of God. They saw all of his miracles. And then they come under the sign of the token. And while they were under the sign of the token, they' taken the communion in in desperation. For they knew at that time God was fixing to strike the judgment. And it was a shaking time. It was a time where every man was examining himself because the word of the prophet had not failed one time. It had been proven to be true. Whatever he said, it kept him just exactly the way he said it. The pillar of fire was still there. And then the prophet had announced that God would only pass over when he saw the token at the door. And it was a desolation. I'd imagine the children were when they saw those big black wings drop down from the sky like a smoke settling over the city, the screams coming from every house. The children might have went to their daddy and said, "Daddy, are you sure that we're under that token?" And he could go to the door, look up on the post a little, said, "Son, that's according to his word. &gt;&gt; Remember, I'm your oldest child. Daddy, are you positive? I am positive. That's according to what the prophet told us. And he has the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Say, when I see the blood, I'll pass over you. Take a lamb for the house. I brought all you children in. You're my oldest, but my firstborn. That's the one that's dying all out in there. But there is a blood. That's what thus sayeth the Lord was. So rest, my son. Rest at ease because God made the promise. See? Well, daddy, why you got your shoes on? Why you got the staff in your hand? Why have you got a piece of bread in one hand and a lamb in the other hand? Why is them bitter herbs and things? What are you eating? What's the sweat running off your face about, son? This fixing a stripe. See, it was in a time of desperation. Now, I believe that we're living in the days that we're or otherwise the days that we're living in should cause the church to go completely into desperation. &gt;&gt; I believe since the message this morning from God, not me. I believe that order to draw into our congregation into desperation &gt;&gt; that we have played long enough. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've went to church long enough. &gt;&gt; We got to do something. &gt;&gt; How is it that we can see other great signs and wonders done on others than what about us? &gt;&gt; It's just Paul's in a state of desperation &gt;&gt; that we are determined before God. the signs of his coming should bring this entire congregation when we've read it from the word and the Holy Spirit has told us go at a certain place such and such a thing will happen not tell us what it was but it would happen we go there it happens that way the newspapers pack it the magazines pack it show the picture of it come back here and see those great mysteries hidden in the Bible open up to us on a new field that we never know before and perfectly blends into the coming of the Lord Jesus. Then at the end of the message, see the action of the great Holy Spirit. See him come down visible before people. Even take pictures of it. See it working and showing that it's not a man. It's not just a preacher. It's not a certain congregation. It's the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ. Now it's embodied in the body of his bride. &gt;&gt; It should throw us into desperation. Those people had seen the hand of God and that night of the communion they took it with in desperation because they know that something was fixing to happen. And we know something's fixing to happen. I remember the coming of the Lord will be a sudden secret going away. &gt;&gt; You'll come and take her like a thief in the night. And I think that if somebody all of a sudden there's members of our family gone and you're left behind, &gt;&gt; it should throw us into desperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God, we'll not be left back behind &gt;&gt; because anything I don't want, don't be don't leave me, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; A few days ago, I was hearing Mel Johnson sing that song, remember me when tears are falling down. &gt;&gt; Yes. Remember me when friends are not around. When I cross over this river Jordan, when you're calling the road, remember me. &gt;&gt; And on the lamb's book of life, I want my name wrote. I want him to remember me when the ro called. and it throws me into desperation. That is like Paul said, after I preach the gospel, shall I be a a store away? Shall I be a a cast off? It could happen. So it chose me into a desperate state, desperation to think of after all these years of preaching, would I could I a place come where I could fail him? What's the next move? What must I do next? And it throws me into a nervous stage that what can I do? It throws me to the mountains and to the valleys. It's hard &gt;&gt; because when I'm with the people, I've got to be all things to all man that I might win some to Christ. Yet put that token always before me thing. And I see things that's coming up and you can't tell the people. You see different things and you're forbidden. Then visions that they call on and sometimes you'd be sorry if you did tell them and you know better than to do it. And then you go so far in visions to everything becomes a vision. It throws you into a nervous stage. You you look say now I'm out of vision like right here. Is this a vision? Where am I really standing at? You you overwork yourself. You over tax yourself and you find out things about people that you wish you didn't know. The people that desires these things to know these things, they don't realize what that type of ministry costs. &gt;&gt; You don't know what goes with it. &gt;&gt; Then it throws into desperation. Lord God, I don't have to answer. Jack Moore said to me one time, I'd hate to have to answer like you have to at the day of the judgment. that God has put these people into your hands and you're going to give an account for every one of them. &gt;&gt; You're going to answer for your ministry. That's been about 15 years ago or maybe 18. And since then, I've been in desperation. What will I do? Let me say only what you say, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me tell them what's the truth or don't say nothing. It throws me in desperation. Then seeing these signs coming, seeing the Holy Spirit take us out there and bring these seals and lay them in like that. Bring the church ages and lay them in. Then come down in a great big pillar of fire back there and reveal himself. Then come down on the next thing on the seven seals and reveal it even put it in the papers and magazines. Then come in and take the angels of God, them seven angels with seven messages and confirmed it exactly what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then during that time come up and bringing those seal of those signs flashes of the end time and bring it up to the people and tell them what it was and all about it and the Lord working right there showing himself present and then right now like this morning come up and require that token on every person &gt;&gt; then you're my people. You're the ones that I love these and them listen to the tapes and so forth. Then you see what desperation puts me in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Desperation. Signs of his coming should throw every member of Christ into desperation. Now about our souls, about our our our welfare for hereafter. Well, what are we going to amount to if we gain the whole world? &gt;&gt; What are we what are we living for? &gt;&gt; What are you worth for? &gt;&gt; What are you eating for? What are you struggling for to live? What are you living for to die? And you're not fit to live until you're fit to die. &gt;&gt; It's true. And we see so many miracles of healing. It should put us into desperation. If that little boy am I looking at Miss Peck and Paul now? Is this Mrs. Peck and Paul? Are you the one that had the boy here or something? Well, here's a woman sitting around here I was talking about. I just have to look over and see her. Now, if God can do that for that little boy, &gt;&gt; it ought to throw you into desperation. &gt;&gt; Uh, a man from New Albany, he may be here tonight. He's a friend to my brother, uh, Roersonson had a little boy here. I think his wife had cancer once and was healed. And and now the little boy's got asthma was so bad. He's just in bad shape. Little fella almost cancer throat himself. See, and then Uh he brought the little boy. Yeah. I see his hand up in the back back there. Was praying for her this morning. You see desperation. When the wife was about to die with cancer, he know that God could heal her. And if God could heal the wife, God can heal the boy. &gt;&gt; And throws it into a state of desperation. See, you must come. And when you're desperate, then God's going to listen to you. &gt;&gt; But if you're just sloping, you don't care whether it does or not. Well, then that's different. You say you do, but it takes desperation to do it. I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love. God, the love of God, I think that the love of God causes desperation. If God is in you, the token inside of you, and you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way they are, it'll throw you into desperation. I believe it will. Now, the word plainly states, if you don't put this down in Galatians 5 and 6, that faith workketh by love. &gt;&gt; See, faith workketh by love. And the only way that you can have faith is have love uh first because after all faith is love's incentive incentive. That's exactly what what faith is. It's an incentive to love. Now you if you don't have love, you can't have faith. See, how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her? &gt;&gt; That's in theio. Now, how about agold to God? &gt;&gt; How can it be if you don't love God? &gt;&gt; If you said you love your wife and never tell her about it, never sit down and make love to her, express her to her, kiss her, hug her, and tell her she's the best cook in the country and all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her. If you don't do that, she'll never know it. &gt;&gt; That's the way if you do love her, you express it. &gt;&gt; That's the way we do to God. and we love him. We tell him about it. We sit down and we adore him and worship him. And see, love drives us to that. Now, what if something's got to be done for your wife? What I throw you into desperation to get it done? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What if somebody says your wife's got cancer? What if somebody says your your wife's got TV, she's fixed to die, yet you you you'll do anything. See, it'll throw you into desperation. That's the same thing that it is. We must have love before we can have faith. And faith, when we have genuine love, what does it do? It pushes our faith out on the battlefront for God. &gt;&gt; Genuine godly love for God and for his word and for his people will push faith out there. &gt;&gt; Love just takes a hold of faith and just, oh, let's go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And out it goes. because that's what love does. John 14:23, Jesus said, "If a man loves me, he'll keep my words." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't keep his words without having faith in what he said. &gt;&gt; So, you see, if he loves God, then he keeps God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he said, "I'm the Lord." And he'll leave, he believes that. &gt;&gt; Love makes him believe it because love dominates all. Though I speak with tongue of man, shows have not love, it's nothing. See, though I have faith to move mountains and have not love, it's nothing. Love dominates all cause. God is love, &gt;&gt; a God of love. Now, yes, sir. If Jesus said, "If a man loves me, he will keep my words," we know it is true that God will meet a desperate soul. We all know that. But it usually takes something to drive us into that uh to that despair to the desperation. It takes something to do it. We find out in James 5:15 that the Bible said that the affectional fervent that's desperation affectional fervent prayer of a righteous man availth much. Amen. &gt;&gt; When a righteous man, a good man gets in travail or soul travel or travail, I I think travel is a better word. Travail or travel, either which one you want to call it. But when a a soul gets in in desperation, intervailing and affectional fervent prayer of a man that can show the token, it does something. &gt;&gt; Notice what the Bible said here also in James 16:16 says, "If confessing our faults, getting right, making ready for it, confess our faults one to another." Amen. &gt;&gt; Having no faults that ask people to pray for you, confessing our faults one to another and praying one part or the other. &gt;&gt; There you are with love. Love that I got confidence I can confess to you my wrong. You can confess to me your wrong. I love you well enough and I'll pray for you and you pray for me. And we'll stay with it with a special fervent prayer until it's answered. &gt;&gt; That's that's desperation. That's what we should have all the time. Let's take some scriptural examples of that. What happened now for another about 15 minutes? The Lord will Jacob. He was the man. He was first a kind of a carefree boy. He thought in his own mind that he knew that the birthright meant everything to him. And he didn't care how he had to get it. Just so he got it. And after he got it, he thought everything was all right because he had the birthight. He thought the thing was settled up to his brother when he was hungry coming in from the field from working with the cattle and hunting the deer. And his brother he needed a big pot of pottish wild peas and and things together. Might have been very tempting when a man's hungry had to walk it all day. And his brother said, "I'm just about ready to feed. give me some of this. And he said, "Well, uh, if you swear to me, I get the birthright." See, he didn't care how I done it. Just so he got. And he thought when he got the birthight, that's settled. Pentecost. That's why you failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You thought because you were born of the spirit. Born of the spirit of God, the birthright. That settled it. But it only starts it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember in the message of of hear ye him how that the child after it was born in the family become a son. It had rights to the birthright but it had to be proven child and then it if it did not prove out to be an obedient child to the father's will then it must be uh did not get the the was not uh become heir. It aired nothing. Yet it was a son, but he aired nothing if he wasn't interested in the father's work. And so when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people and they begin to restore back the gifts and things that was in the church, they thought because they were born of the spirit that settled it. But you see, there's a placing of a son. And after this son proved to be a real son, then he was taken to a public place and then was set up and changed robes and set up there. And then there was a placing of the son that he had and of everything the father had. &gt;&gt; God did the same thing by his son on Mount Transfiguration. He was overshadowed by the the uh cloud and was transfigured and his rain had shine like the sun. And a voice said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." Moses and the law had failed and this is him. He was placed. See, now Jacob thought because that he had the birthight that everything was made. So did the Pentecostal people and they began to organize the the oneness and trinitarians and all kinds of organizations and fussing and pulling one another proved that the token wasn't shown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Malice, envy, strife. See? Well, that's where it got to. Now, see, Jacob thought the same thing, but in fear one night of his own life, desperation took a hold of him. when he thought that just across that river yonder my brother's waiting to kill me. He's going to see the birthright that he had gotten was the thing was going to cause his death. And sometimes that very thing that you receive as the Holy Spirit and is and are born again of the spirit. If you don't watch that same thing will condemn you at the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. The very waters that saved Noah condemn the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; The thing that that you would call fanaticism might be the very thing that condemns you at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Now, Jacob knew that his life was closed at the end. He had a messenger come told him that his brother with 400 armed men was coming to meet him. Notice he was on his road. Fear took a hold of him. He sent man on ahead with ox and cattle and sheep to make a peace offering with Esau. Then after that he started another group with another load of stuff. Then he started another group with another load of stuff trying to meet him first to try to turn his wrath. Then he got to thinking that won't stop him because he's probably richer than I am. He doesn't need it. Then he took his wives and his little children and set them across that Esau would see them little children and his wives and surely on his own little nieces nephews he would not slay. Then he still couldn't do it. God knows how to get a man. Jacob crossed the brook got down on his knees. No he kind of been a kind of a little shyer before that. Excuse expression but kind of a little he was a Jacob. Jacob needs a deceiver and that's what he was. &gt;&gt; But they somehow had to happen to him there in desperation there when death laid before him. There may be men and women sitting here tonight. That's death lays right before you. And the only way that you'll ever be able to achieve the thing that you're wanting is to desperately come. I must have it tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; I get it now or I'm finished. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow's too late. I must have it now. &gt;&gt; When you pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the token, don't say, "Well, I'm going to try." Lord, I'm a little tired. Oh, mercy. Stay in your seat. &gt;&gt; Don't even Don't even make an attempt. If you come say, "I'll pass through the prayer line. Put the oil away. I see if it does me any good." Might as well sit where you're at. &gt;&gt; I told you get to that place. until the whole church gets your place. &gt;&gt; That is between death and life. You've got to have it now or parish. &gt;&gt; Then God will move on the scene. &gt;&gt; It takes desperation to bring God on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jacob cried like never before. Desperately he called until he got a hold of God. And when he did, he wrestled. Not for 15 minutes. He wrestled to keep him in his soul all night long. And still he knew he didn't have the blessing. And he was able to hold on until the blessing come. &gt;&gt; He wrestled desperately until the blessing come. Then and when he seen until God came on the scene and then in despair, I'll not let you go. When you begin to feel the blessing coming out on me now people say, "Glory to God. I got it now." Now you're deceived. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Somebody say, "Oh, I just feel so good, brother. I went I prayed. Oh, shivers run over me and that might have been God. I saw a great light before me." That still might have been God, but that ain't what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Hebrews the 6th chapter, the rain fallth on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just the same. Now you take wheat and take weeds and put them in the field and the rain is actually sent for the wheat. But the rain falls on the weeds the same as it does the wheat. And the rain is the weeds is just as happy about the rain as the wheat is. And it's the very same rain. Amen. &gt;&gt; The very Holy Ghost can fall upon an unbeliever and make him act just exactly the same way a believer acts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But by the fruits they are known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm speaking of. That's a token. &gt;&gt; And David and Jacob rather in desperation he said, "I know. I feel you. You're here with me. But I'm not going to let you go. Somebody seems to find the first little sensation. Jump up, down, up, up, down, and say, "I got it. I got it. I got it." Oh, no. No. Jacob stayed there until something happened that made him walk different, made him a different person because he stayed until that happened. And he was able. The Bible said he held until he prevailed. &gt;&gt; How can a man prevail over God? &gt;&gt; But you can do it. You can do it. A man can prevail over God. One time there was a man named Hezekiah. Had been told by the prophet, "Thus sayeth the Lord, you're going to die." Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and in desperation he wept out. Lord, consider me. I've walked before you with a perfect heart, and I need 15 more years after God had told him that something's going to happen. He's going to die. And in desperation, he changed the program of God. &gt;&gt; Desperation, he wept bitterly in desperation. Jacob stayed there until the blessing came and changed his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. from a deceiver to a prince with God. &gt;&gt; Even the nation was called by his name. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What was it? The results was because he got desperate about the thing. &gt;&gt; And the next day when he met Esau, he didn't need any guards. &gt;&gt; He walked right out and met him. &gt;&gt; See &gt;&gt; why? He had gotten desperation till he got the assurance. And you get desperate until you get the assurance. If you don't, don't even come to be prayed for. Don't even come to guard the altar. Wait till it's between life and death to you. Then something happened. Certainly desperation. Ruth got desperate one time. When she stand, would she have to go back to her people, to all that she loved and all that she she worshiped, her gods and her people? Or would she cleave to Nema? What must she do? And she got in desperation and she cried out, "Where you go, I'll go. Where you live, I live. Where you die, I'll die. Where you're buried, I'll bury. I'll be buried. And your God shall be my God. There you are. Desperate. God blessed her. Gave her a son. Obie forgot Jess. Jess got through just come Jesus. Because desperation like the little harlot rehab. She was desperate. She knowed that deathly before she's under judgment and she got desperate said I'll hide you spies I'll do anything only swear to your god and my house will stand &gt;&gt; there you are he said I if you take this token it will eler got desperate when a responsibility was placed upon him the heart of bride for Isaac elar of Damascus was a great man he was favored by Abraham and he was trusted by Abraham to go out and hunt a bride, a ripe type of a bride for his son Isaac. Through that would bring forth Christ. Now, Ela Ezer being a spiritual man knowed what it meant. The right kind of a woman had to be that that man's wife. &gt;&gt; How would he chose it? And the hour of his desperation when he arrived at the city, he prayed and said, "Lord God," that's the day when you get desperate, go to pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord God, let the first maid that comes forth and waters the camel and gives me a drink be that. He prayed in the hour of his desperation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rebecca, the beautiful maid came water the camel and then he said, "Don't delay me in my weight." She had to come to a time of decision. Whether she would go, she was a type of the bride. Was she was she go and marry a man who she's never even seen. Now, that's a great thing. Never even seen him. Yet, you'd only heard by his servant. That's a type of the bride. You've never seen Christ, but you hear by his servants what he is. &gt;&gt; You sell out everything. You leave your homes, everything else it takes to go to find him. Now notice, as she made the decision, the tie for the bride, left her denominational home, see Jonah th overboard in the time of a storm in the bottom of the sea, in the belly of the whale. All hopes of survival was gone. But it happened to come on his mind that Solomon in dedicated the temple said Lord if the people be in trouble anywhere and they'll turn towards this temple and pray then here and turning over in the belly of the whale manag to get somewhere to his knees I imagine with the bomb of the whale all over him very praying in desperation &gt;&gt; and in that desperate just a few breaths of oxygen is all he had in the whale's belly. And in that few breaths that he was drawing, maybe he didn't know which way he was, but said, "Lord, I believe I'm looking up for Dodger Temple." And with just a few breaths to go, in desperation, prayed under those circumstances. Never been done before, but he was desperate. &gt;&gt; He prayed and God kept him alive for three days and nights and delivered him at the place to deliver his message. desperation. &gt;&gt; Hannah, a barren woman in the Bible, she wanted a son and she got to fasting for him and she fasted and prayed until even the priests at the temple thought she was drunk. She was in such desperation with the rest of the women watching what kind of a bonnet the other one had wore. And you know how it goes. and the other one seen what kind of clothes they had on and talking about the things going on on the farm. But not Hannah. She stepped right through the whole crowd and went to the altar. She'd been fasting. She wanted her reproach taken away. What a difference it is. It's almost a reproach to have a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That it was a it was reproach not to have one. And she got on her knees and she noticed the dignity of the temple. She never noticed the dignified priest as he walked out. She was in such distress, sort of tears rolling down her cheeks and she was crying in desperation. Oh Lord God, give me a son. Give me a son. Notice she wasn't selfish. When God heard her and answered her prayer and gave her a son, she gave him back to God. And because that she was willing not to be selfish after Darth answered her prayer, he gave her a prophet. &gt;&gt; That was an extra blessing. Oh, he's just full of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those little extra things that he gave. Not only a son, but a prophet. And there had been no open vision for many, many years in Israel. Samuel the first prophet for many, many years. Because a mother got desperate that she could have no children and she was past the age of probably 60 70 years old and she prayed with desperation. She must have this child. Why is it? God had spoke to her. No doubt. &gt;&gt; You can't be desperate. The God speaks to you. Oh church, rise and shake yourself. Pinch your conscience. Wake yourself up in this hour. We must be desperate or perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's coming forth something from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anoint thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's coming forth something and we better get desperate. &gt;&gt; It's between life and death. It'll pass through us and we won't see it because that she wasn't selfish. She was given a prophet. The Shonomite woman had a little boy that the prophet had spoke the word of the Lord over though she was old and her husband old. They had no children but she was kind to this this prophet and she knew that he was a man of God. She perceived that he was honorable a real man. He come into the house husband not there and whatever more he was a holy man. They could see that he was an honorable person. She'd watched him do signs and wonders. She'd heard him tell things that happened. He was an honorable holy man. She said to her husband, "I perceive that this man that stops with us is a holy man." The lady of the house. She know that he was a holy man. And she built a little house out there for him so he wouldn't be embarrassed. He could come by when he wanted to and so forth. She put a a little bed out there and a and a jug of water and so forth so he could wash himself and have something to drink. and she'd probably send a maid out or somebody to book her with with some food to feed him and come by and bid the the day to him or something. And so when Elijah saw this kindness done to him and it's written, "What you do to my little one, you do it to me." &gt;&gt; So, uh, she saw that the woman was honoring God as she honored this prophet, as she seen God in the prophet. And so, uh, she wanted nothing for it. It wasn't her heart for anything. She just done it because she loved God. She didn't do it for any blessing. She just done it. Now, now Elijah said, "Go ask her shall I speak to the king for I'm a personal friend or the chief captain. I know him real well as some favor, something I could do for her. I want to give her something for a while. She's been to me. She's she's fed me. She's let me sleep in the beds and and she's been real nice to us. Now, what can I do?" She said, "No, I just run among my people. We're we're well off. We have a living and that's all. We don't need nothing. And Gahasa said to him, "But she doesn't have any children." No more. Gahesa saw it. No doubt. The prophet saw a vision. For he said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, go tell her in the appropriate time or the proper time. A year from now, she'll embrace a son." And the son was born. When he's about 12 years old how that old couple must have loved this little boy, their only child. And one day is out cutting wheat with his daddy. Must have been about the middle of the day. He had a sunstroke, I suppose, because if you're going to holler in my head, he got sicker and sicker. His daddy had to take him from the field. And it's such an emergency there that he sent a servant, sent him in. The mother held him on her lap until noon time and he died. Notice her only child that had been given to her by the Lord through the prayer and the promise of a prophet. and thus sayeth the law. She know there was something wrong somewhere. It just wouldn't work. How would God give her that son and let her love come to that baby? Yet she never asked for it. She was too old to have it. The hand of God had to pronounce it. A man spoke at the prophet. And there this baby in this condition had died, her only son. So she said to the servant, "Sat on me a mule and you ride and don't you stop. If anybody's tries to stop me, don't you say a word and you drive straight to Mount Carmel up there in a cave somewhere pulled back. There's a servant of the most high God. The one who told me thus sayeth the Lord will have the baby. I want to know why gods did this." So he said, "Go straight forward and don't check that new lady mind. This is hard as everything's in him. Let him run till you get there. Desperation. &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet raised up, looked and said, "Here comes that shinomite and something wrong with her. God's kept it from me. I don't know what's wrong." Said, "Go beat her." I got hurry. There's something wrong. Desperation set in on the prophet. Desperation on the woman. See, they were coming together. One wanting to know what the word of the Lord was. The other didn't know what the word of the Lord was. There you are. One to know it, the other didn't know it. The woman wanted to know it, and the prophet didn't know it. Said, "God's kept it for me. I don't know what to tell her when she gets here." So, she's almost there. Then he raised up his hand. He said, "Is all well with thee? All well with the husband? Is all well with the child?" Now, the woman had reached the end of her desperation. She said, "All is well." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All is well. Her desperation's over. She had found the servant of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you had been there, she's still been in desperation. &gt;&gt; But you see, he was there. She said, "All is well." Elijah thought, "Well, what's going on now?" So, she run up and fell down at his feet. That looked kind of uncommon. So, Gahesa just lifted her up. Said, "Let her alone. Don't do that. Elijah said to his servant, "Don't do that. Let alone there's something wrong. God keeps it from him." Then she revealed to him that the baby was dead. Now the prophet didn't know what to do. He said, "Ghesa, take this staff that I've walked on." He know that whatever he touched was blessed cuz it wasn't him. It was God in him. He knew who he was. He knew that he was a prophet. So he picks up this staff and said, "Gesa, you take this and you go and lay it upon the child. If anybody speaks to you, you get desperate. Don't you sleep nobody and let go. Just keep going on. Don't speak to nobody. Put it up on the child." But the woman, that didn't end her desperation. That didn't satisfy what she come for. She said, "As the Lord God lives, I'm I'm not going to leave you until you go minister to the child." &gt;&gt; And Elijah got desperate. Here he went down the road, him and the woman. And when they got there, the all the people were out in the yard screaming and crying. And the woman had done the most appropriate thing could be done. She tucked the baby and laid him on the bed where Elijah had laid him. &gt;&gt; That was as good as that. and he didn't wake up there so the thing wouldn't work. She wanted to know something different. The prophet went in now he's in desperation. Now what's he going to do? And we find that the Bible and he walked up and down the floor. Desperate. I don't know nothing else to do, Lord. Yeah, I am. You told me to speak back to that woman. And thus sayeth the Lord is exactly the way I told her because you told me. Now there she's in trouble and I don't know what to do. There lays a dead boy. What can I do, Lord? No doubt the Holy Spirit said, "If the God is in you, then lay yourself on the baby." First thing you know, he stopped, run, put his hands upon his hands, his nose upon its nose, his lips upon its lips. And when he laid himself over, the baby sneezed seven times. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Desperation was over. &gt;&gt; Amen. The baby come to life because of desperation drove the woman to the prophet and desperation drove the prophet to the baby &gt;&gt; and desperation both of them drove God on the scene &gt;&gt; with love of God and love for his people brought the love of God down and throw faith out on the battlefront and the work was done &gt;&gt; case closed. Amen. That said desperation does it. Certainly she wasn't going to leave. Blind Barnameus thought Jesus was going to pass him by sitting out there at the gate blind beggar for arms. The first thing you know he heard a noise. Jesus is passing by. He said who passes by? Somebody shoved him down. He said please somebody. Who's passing by? One of them maybe a kind little disciple woman said to him said sir don't you know who that is passing by? No. I hear some of them say there's a whole graveyard full of dead people up here. If you raise the dead, go raise them. Is it a blasphemer or somebody? No. Have you ever heard of that prophet of Galilee, that young prophet called Jesus of Nazareth? No. Well, you know in the Bible it says in our scrolls that the son of David will be raised up to settle. That's him. Is that him? &gt;&gt; Is that him? But he's passing by. &gt;&gt; Amen. Desperation drove him to scream. Oh Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy upon me. &gt;&gt; Pass me not, oh gentle savior. Hear my humble cry. While all others are calling, do not pass me by. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, some of them said, "Shut up. You make too much noise." But he was desperate. &gt;&gt; If he got by, he might never have another opportunity. &gt;&gt; We might not either. That's right. &gt;&gt; This might be the last night. &gt;&gt; Desperation, he screamed out. Oh Jesus. No matter who told him to stop, he cried just the same. That much more louder. When they told him to shut up and made him get louder. He was desperate. Nobody could stop him. Thou son of David, have mercy on me. And he screamed in desperation. And the son of God with the sins of the world upon his shoulders going to Jerusalem to be offered up right then for a sacrifice for the world stopped in his tracks. &gt;&gt; Desperation, a desparing cry stopped the son of God. Said, "What would you have me do for him?" Oh, said, "Lord, that I might receive my sight." Said, "Go your way. Your faith saves you." &gt;&gt; That was enough. &gt;&gt; Desperation. When desperation is to receive something, the faintest little touch, faith grabs it. You just said, "Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on. Just let me see if I can see now. I don't see my hands for many years. Let's see if I can see it." I don't see nothing yet. When Jesus said, "Thy faith has saved thee." That was enough. &gt;&gt; That's all he wanted. Desperation calls for a subject. And when the subject, no matter how faith it is, it's received. It's believed right there because faith catches when desperation is pushing it. &gt;&gt; See, love in there, mixes with it, and brings it to it. Desperation does. Blind Barnameus caught the vision quickly. Peter is all steamed up one night on the sea when he got in desperation and he begin to cry out, "There's something wrong. I see a spirit come walking to me." The ship was about to go down. He said, "If it be you, Lord, let me come to you on the water and he stepped down out of the ship and started." And he got scared when he got started. And he started to sink in desperation, though a mistake in trying to follow the commandments of God. &gt;&gt; I hope the church gets it. &gt;&gt; The man was doing what God told him to do. Now you Christians tonight, you're in the line of duty trying to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and a cancer grabs you or a a death grabs you, a cancer, tumor, whatever it is. In the line of duty, you have the same right that Peter had. &gt;&gt; Lord, save the oral perish. Desperation called out and a hand reached and picked him up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have the same name, but he screamed out, "Save me, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He heard my desparing cry from the waters lifted me. Now, safe am I. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's it. When you cry out, maybe this woman, mother, whatever it was to her little son or grandson or nephew, whatever it was, cried out in despair, got hurt. Then we find out that in the sinking God he hurt him. In the line of duty he started to sink. He failed. No matter if you fail that don't have nothing to do with it. We all fail. We're failure to begin with. But we got somebody standing down with a strong hand who can reach us and take us above the water. &gt;&gt; If you made a mistake, some woman made a mistake. Some man made a mistake. Some boy girl made a mistake. Don't sink. Scream out &gt;&gt; in the spirit of the Lord. Save me or I'll perish. &gt;&gt; Get desperate about it. God will hear you. He always hears a desperate soul. That's what I'm trying to tell you about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our dear Lord, Jesus himself in the world's greatest battleground, Gethsemane. He cried out in despair. Should he take the sins of the world? Or should he just remain on earth with his beloved disciples? What he wanted to do? But what's his humility as he humbled himself? Not my will but thine be done. Humbled himself to the word, the promised word of the God of heaven. Notice then he went a little further. And if he went a little further, how much more ought we to go a little farther? And notice the scripture says here in Luke that he prayed earnestly. Brother and sister, if Jesus had to pray earnestly, how much more have we got to pray earnestly? &gt;&gt; If Christ the God of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly, then how much more are we sinners saved by grace? Pray earnestly. [Music] If if the decision throw the son of God into despair, what will it do to you and I? Desperately, we must cry. God in these last days has manifested himself so to us by his great signs and power should make us desperate. That's right. and is willing to heal us and save us or to throw us all into desperation to get to that healing stone. &gt;&gt; That's right. Look, if Florence Nightingale, the great granddaughter of the late Florence Nightingale that founded the Red Cross, you see her picture in the book, weighed about 30 lbs. Cancered eat her up in London, England. They brought her from Africa, London, England. And there in despair, brother Boss wrote back to her and said, "We can't come to Africa." She wrote back, I had to nurse her right and said, "I can't be moved. I can't do it." Showed the picture. You've seen the picture. &gt;&gt; Only we had to put a little piece over it. It just had a small card around. I thought maybe somebody putting the book might criticize because she was her body was so exposed there. And we put a little thing across her here. She just had a a little rag towel laying across across her hips. But up above there was nothing. And even but we thought we put a little piece of paper in there and photographed the photograph back to keeps people who not got right kind of a position in their mind thinking that they wouldn't criticize me putting that picture in paper. And then when the doctor said that she can't even move and she knowed I was going to visit England, she had them to put her on a stretcher and pack her to a plane and bring her to London, England and send a guard out to the plane before going down to Buckingham Palace. Send a guard out there to come pray for her. And she was so far gone until she couldn't even speak to me they had to raise her hands to put it in mine. You know how London is some of you soldiers been there. It's always so foggy and I knelt down there by the side of a window and she the tears running off. She wanted to I don't know how she even got enough moisture to let tears come. It's just only bone skin over and her her legs up here at the hips wasn't over about looked to me like about 2 in across or 3 in her veins was collapsed. How she's living I don't know. You've seen her picture later. I knelt down by the side of the bed. Now she was desperate. Whether I could come or not, they're going to bring her anyhow. And I got down there. My heart was a bleeding within me. uh the faith of that poor little dying creature and I prayed with all the heart that I had and while I started to pray a little turtle come through on the window be to walk up and down could I thought it was a pet I hadn't been in England about an hour just coming from the airport down there and I thought it was a pet and when I raised up said amen it flew away and I started to ask the brethren did they hear that dove and they were talking about it And when I start to say that you see what that devil means to come out, thus sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; you'll live and not die. &gt;&gt; She's living today. &gt;&gt; Why? Desperation. Amen. Desperation drove the woman to take a stand. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Desperation. A race that she got there at the same time I did. And a token from God. He sent a dove to give thus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Desperate. &gt;&gt; When Sister Hetty Waldro of Phoenix, Arizona, she's coming up the sidewalk in my first meeting. The intern and her husband is bringing her cancer of the heart. She made her stand to try to get there to the meeting, but she was so bad she was couldn't breathe no more. The blood is dropped back to her heart. Well, the cancer eat into her heart. a cancer of the heart. That's about 18, 19 years ago, maybe 20. 1947 is when it was now. She said to her husband and turn, "If no, I die in this line. Take me up there." Desperation. &gt;&gt; She lost conscious. I don't think she was dead. She claimed she was. Now, she might have been. She may hear this tape and see now I I I she claimed she was dead. I don't know. They told me she's a dead woman coming up the line. And when the woman come by, she was lifeless. And when they brought her up there, the word of the Lord came and I went and laid hands up on her and she rose up &gt;&gt; and went home walking. &gt;&gt; This has been about I'd say safely 18 years ago. And she's just as healthy and hotty. She'll be at Tucson to meet me when I get down there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Desperation going on the road till we get down there. &gt;&gt; He healed others. He'll heal me, willing. Let our hearts be filled with love in this day. That be earnest in a desperation. After a while, it may be too late. Jas one time had a little daughter that was dying. He was a borderline believer. He believed Jesus, but he's afraid to confess it because they put him out of the synagogue. But the doctor come one morning and says, "She's dying now." Desperation set in. He couldn't afford as his position to be caught with Jesus of Nazareth because he'd lose his position as a priest. But I'll tell you, when emergency come, it throw him to desperation. I can see him hunting for his little preacher's coat and hat and slipped it on. Here he come down through the crowd, pressing around where there's a woman just touched his garment and so forth. And there's all shout, but he went and said, "Master, my little girl's laying at the point of death. Master, master, my little girl's laying at the point of death." And if you just come lay your hands on her, she'll live. Oh my. Desperation makes you say things sometimes. Makes you do things. It puts you into action. His daughter was saved by the desperation. Let's be desperate. Like that little woman with a blood issue. The Bible said she'd spent all of her money with the physicians and yet they couldn't help her. She starting time of menopause to flooding and a blood issue and they wouldn't stop. They maybe stole the farm, the mules, the horses, whatever it was. And nothing could help her. And their priest had told her never go around such as that. But one morning she looked down. She lived up on the bank up there where a farm was and she seen a great bunch of people gathered around a man down there and they said, "What is that?" Said, "That's Jesus of Nazareth." Desperation said in &gt;&gt; she said, "I'm kind of insignificant. I But if I can only touch the border of his garment, I'll be made well." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she passed by every critic and everything else. But then she got to the spot. She touched his garment in desperation. And when he did, he turned and said, "Who touched me?" &gt;&gt; And they all denied it. But he looked around. He was possessed with a great gift of God. He was God. And he found the little woman and told her blessed issue had stopped. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Desperation drove her to do that. It was desperation. The girl drove the queen of the south. She heard that the gift of God was working through Solomon. &gt;&gt; Desperation drove her to that. desperately. That's human beings like you, like me. They wasn't any different from you and I. They had five senses to eat and drink and so forth like we do. Live and die. They were human beings. It drove her into such desperation till she took part of her kingdom. It drove her to a place that she didn't think about that Ishelites would rob her on the desert. Her 90 days on the back of a camel across the Sahara Desert. desperation. She's going anyhow. &gt;&gt; And when she got there, there was nothing help from Solomon but what he told her. The things that she wanted to know. Desperation. Jesus said she'll rise in the day of the judgment, but this generation condemnth are greater than Solomon this year. Desperation. In closing, I might say this. Not long ago down in Mexico, I seen something desperate. I just got to the platform there in a big arena and people been there since 9:00 that morning and it's nearly 10:00 that night. An old blind man the night before totally blind for about 30 years received his sight. Was going around the city that day testifying and all a rick of clothes laying for maybe 30 40 yards that high. this old shaws there maybe 40 50,000 people there and old hats and shawls who they belong to I guess they have to decide that among them they're pouring down rain and they let me down a rope over a wall I got on the platform the min the man that sat here that brought in him and his daughter come down from Michigan a few minutes ago talked about brother A we remember him here he's on the streets of glory tonight brother A was there and took his over coat off and stood in the and give it to brother Jack Moore to put on because Jack was shivering a southerner who's about to freeze that cold rain there in Mexico and there he was standing there and really Paul come to me my son said daddy you'll have to do something there's a little Mexican woman down there with a dead baby that died this morning I ain't got enough ushers to hold her out of the line laying hands on that blind man give me sight laying hands on her dead baby but give it sign she was a Catholic And she they couldn't hold her back. And brother Espinosa told her that we have no more prayer cards. You'll have to wait till another night. She said, "My baby's dead. It's been dead since this morning. I must get in there." &gt;&gt; And she was coming prayer card or not. And they lined up about 300 ushers there and she'd go right on her legs and jump up on top of her backs and run with this dead baby and fall down among them. Did it make any difference to her? She was trying to get there. She was desperate. God had spoke to her heart that God could give sight to give life. &gt;&gt; Oh my, she was desperate. Something was burning in her. &gt;&gt; Oh sick people, you let that burn in you for a few minutes. Watch what happens. That kind of a desperation. Amen. The God that could heal this little boy the other night could heal that day of cancer, heal this man, this park, get all the tens of thousands. He that undisputable evidence raising the dead and healing the sick and everything else. If he's God can do that, he's God yesterday, he's God today. &gt;&gt; You're desperate. Then you'll get something done. Then in that desperation, she kept rushing. I said to brother Jack Moore, I said, "She don't know me. She's never seen me. She don't know who it is up here on the platform." That little Catholic woman couldn't speak a word of English. How does she know who it is? I said roll down, pray for the baby, and that'll satisfy and she'll go on. Said they won't call. It's just constant roller down there. She'd jump up and everybody be screaming. She'd run over top her shoulders and fall right down on them. She'd gain a few feet and then they try to put her back out and here she come right through the lace homeless baby upset users and everything else. They make her she's getting up there. She had to get there. It don't make a difference what it was. She's going to get there. Had to minister. Now, isn't that just a story like the Schumanite woman? Only that wasn't 3,500 years ago. That was about three years ago or four. See, they can be the same thing tonight. When the same desperation rises, I'll throw love and faith up there to the battlefront to claim what you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's a promise of God that you can have it. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I turned me the minister, the evangelist at the place, I turned. I felt sorry for the woman, but there's no desperation. See, I turned and thought, well, your brother Jack will pray for her and that that settles it. I turned. I said, as I was speaking, now Faith looked out there and there was a vision. I seen a little baby sitting a little blackfaced Mexican baby with no teeth. It was laughing at me, sitting out there. I said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute." Her desperation &gt;&gt; drove the Holy Spirit to Jesus. Jesus, show me her baby. Sitting there and sent the spirit back. I said, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Bring me the baby." Here she come with a little wet soaking blue and white blanket, a little dead form about that long. She fell with a crucifix in her hand or a rosary to say these Hail Marys. I told her, "Put it up. That's not necessary. And she come up close to where I was and she spinning hard. Padre, which means father. I said, "Don't say that. Don't say that. Do you believe?" And he said it in Spanish to her. Did she believe? Yes, she believed. He asked her, "How would she believe?" She said, "If God can give that old man his sight, he can give my baby the life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Desperation to it. &gt;&gt; Not a thing on my part. I just saw the vision. And I said, "Lord Jesus, I saw a vision of a little baby. It might be this one about that time." He kicked it. [Applause] I said, "Follow her to the doctor. Get a rap written statement from the doctor. That baby died." And the doctor wrote the statement, "That baby's respiration heart stopped this morning in my office at 9:00. Die with double pneumonia." Oh, the babies are living in Mexico tonight, as far as I know. The desperation sitting on a little mother's heart, crying for her child that had seen God do heal a man's blind eye and know he could raise a dead baby. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Desperation. When thou seekest me with all thine heart, they're not hearing. See the kingdom, the law, and the prophets were until John. Since then, the kingdom of heaven's been preached, and man press into it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't just stand up and say, "Pick me up with the collar, Lord. Push me in." You press into it. &gt;&gt; You get desperate &gt;&gt; between life and death. &gt;&gt; Wish I had time for another story, but I was thinking right now of a woman, a girl dug a wrong road and how she turned new pages and things. I said, "Sister," she got up and said, "I I believe I'll be all right." I said, "No, no, stay there." Then first thing you know she started praying a little bit and directly she got louder and louder after a while she got desperate said oh God save me alcohol synonymous couldn't cure it nothing else could do it but that big black eyes looked at me the tears dropped over her cheek something's happened yes sir &gt;&gt; something happened she got desperate &gt;&gt; let's be desperate about this between death and life &gt;&gt; you can't get desperate don't come through here. If you are desperate, come here and watch you. You'll get it as soon as you get here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; In desperation, &gt;&gt; watch for the kingdom of God. It'll come up on you. &gt;&gt; And we thank God for the word. We can give the Lord a hand of praise for his word. [Applause] As we prepare to go to the table of the Lord, let us sing that song. All is well. All is well. [Music] All is well. All is well we have heard message shalom all is well for bless Perfect breast [Music] for all is well. &gt;&gt; How many believe that all is well? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, she was at the very darkest time of her life and she went through all the trouble to get her dead baby to the prophet and the prophet asked her, "Is all well?" And she said, "All is well." And we have that testimony tonight. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Corinthians chapter 15. Let's all turn there as we go to the uh table of Corinthians 11. Sorry. We'll stand to our feet. Of course, everyone is welcome. I know that we have visitors here tonight and if they wasn't prepared to take the supper that's fine but the Lord is good to us. 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and he said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." And when he uh and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily, eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tear one for another. If any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Amen. So, we'd like to take a moment to pray for one another. You pray for me, I'll pray for you. Pray for the one next to you, behind you. Pray for your families. Pray for the church and all the needs in the body of Christ that you can think of. Someone that is not here, pray for them. Someone on your heart, in your mind, pray for them. Pray for me. I'll pray for you. Let's all pray for one another. Silent prayer. Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold this bread that was made for this service, Lord. It was prepared without any leaven, Lord. And it was prepared for this service that represents your body. It is not your body. It represents your body. It's a symbol. You commanded us to do it. And Lord, we do it in obedience to you. And because of that obedience, Lord, there's a blessing when we partake. We believe there's a promise. And we pray, Father, that all that partake, as they examine their lives, may you bless them. and may the blessings that come with the obedience and all the types and shadows of the lamb in the Old Testament giving strength to the bodies for the travelers the clothes didn't even wear out Lord the prophet of God said the spiritual and physical strength is in these oracles tonight and Lord we receive that by faith We ask you bless it for this service in Jesus name. Amen. Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the cup of the New Testament of your blood, the blood of the grapes. The grape was pressed. It was squeezed and the life was taken out and it produced the blood of the grape. It goes through the process to ferment. Life returns back into it and it has a stimulation. And Lord Jesus, it's a type of your blood that was shed at Calvary. And Lord, we bless the cup. We bless the wine. We bless these elements. And may everyone that partake of it, Lord, not be a formal or a form or tradition, but may it be life unto us as we receive it, Lord. So many testimonies of healing after this service. And Lord, may others even tonight be healed as they partake of the bread and the wine. Lord, you served this to Abraham after he delivered Lot and Melzdc. And Lord, we are here tonight for you to serve it to us tonight. Bread and wine. May each one that partake receive the blessing. I ask the blessing on the cup in Jesus name. Amen. You be seated. Please follow the directions of the usher. Okay. [Music] Open. [Music] Oh, heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Follow me. [Music] Oh, [Music] hey. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Come on. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] This portion of bread that remains will be burnt with fire before the rising of the sun. Amen. Let's stand. Take our Bibles and turn into St. John chapter 13. I had lunch by myself today and um just fulfilling a gift card that we had and I saw some saints from one of the churches here in town. And after I got ready to leave, I sat down and and spoke with them just a little bit. They called me to come and sit down. And after we fellowshipped a little bit and they said, "Brother Israel, Brother Paul, we want you to know that we love you and we believe the message." They wanted me to know that they believe the message. So I said, &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, it's so good to hear that. I I like hearing that." &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John chapter 13 verse two supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper he laid aside his garments he took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples eat and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, what I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter? Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet, but is clean every wit, and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore said he, ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, had taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and you say, well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent, greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. So the Lord gives us an example. And we're not greater than our Lord. If the Lord washed the disciples feet, we're not greater than our Lord. &gt;&gt; And he said, "You'll be happy if you do that." So, we're happy to do that. Let's sing. There's like three songs that Brother Brother Man referenced on that tape there. They were all hymns. All is well with the Shunomite, Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior with the the Blind Man. And then he quoted Love Lifted Me. So, let's sing a little bit of that. Love lifted me. As before we dismiss, the sisters will go to the room next door. The brothers will remain. I was singing and said far from the peaceful sure we sang within seeking to rise. Oh my god. [Music] Now say I receive on your heart. [Music] Oh, love that. And when nothing else could help me, love me. Yes, it was lovely when nothing else lifted me. And all my heart I give. ever to him. Let me hear you sing it with all your heart again. [Music] Amen. Ever is gracious. His love is love so true. There is my soulless song. Faithful loving service to him. All your heart love me. Love me when nothing else me love me. Yes, it was lovely [Applause] when nothing else [Music] lifted me. [Music] Amen. God bless you, Richie. We had a wonderful time with brother Armando on Friday. They welcomed us and brother Andy was there, my wife and brother Art, sisters and his wife. We had a wonderful time. That's why I don't hardly have any voice because they pulled it out of me.

Brother Armando had a testimony for us and I wanted him to come and share that. Amen. and I think it'll be a blessing to us. Amen. Come forward, brother. Uh first of all, I want to ask you to forgive me for not taking the supper or participate in communion. But uh I it's not me alone. I have my wife and a friend and you know and uh to me this is very intimate &gt;&gt; and I want to respect that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't I don't want no other thoughts to come up. Uh I've been sad for for about a week or two maybe and I work hard uh for souls.

Everybody wants them, you know, like when they already know how to tie, how to offer, you know, that they already know them. They want them already productive. So when so you know doing this clean up with babies is hard. &gt;&gt; And uh and uh so there was a there was a beautiful girl 20 years old that came uh with a family. His bro her brother is right there. Can you stand? uh uh Jixon that's the brother and uh the whole family and uh you know they they they want to work and all like that so we allow her to go to work to this place and it wasn't that long you know when the devil did his job because I I tell people that the devil has good preachers &gt;&gt; they know how to preach &gt;&gt; and they know how to really changed people's minds you know and so this girl about I think it is two weeks ago two weeks ago something like that she left she left the house she left the house of the family to go with this with these people I don't want to say other words but I have other words for these persons you know but uh I'll say these people you know and uh because they're are demonpossessed brothers Do you believe that &gt;&gt; there's no other thing? How can you say, you know, &gt;&gt; and so they they start talking with this girl, you know, and and she was going to church, baptized, everything. And then all of a sudden her mind changed &gt;&gt; and she left. She went and the brother the brother with whom she was leaving called me. She said, "Pastor, uh, my my sister left, you know, and then everybody start like the heart, you know, and I already knowing the the the system, you know, the the the the the movement. I I knew what was going on, you know, and so she left and and things just went on and on and on and uh and so I I've been dealing with this and coming with brother Alex. There were I was on the phone like three times I think brother Alex you know and brother Alex says huh they are not leaving you alone you know and she and he's like they're not and I'm like yeah yeah and I said brother Alex right now forgive this expression but I said right now I am like Rambo I have a weapon a 60 mm you know gun and I am in a trench &gt;&gt; cuz right now I'm fighting you don't know what powers I'm fighting it's not just the human. It's powers, you know, &gt;&gt; and I was, you know, I was coming and then they she went to to this to the sister and they negotiated with her, you know, kind of to stay with them and like that to get out of that place and uh and they called me and they said, "Brother Armando, pastor, the uh this girl uh my sister says that she want to stay now here." And I said, "Well, that's fine, but we I I got to deal with something else. There's not just coming. &gt;&gt; I I I got to there there has to be conditions, &gt;&gt; you know, and I'm happy that she was doing that decision, but at the same time, it's like, is this just going to be like that?" &gt;&gt; So, and I and I said to her, you know, this is the condition. And they have me on a speaker. And so she told the the the the brother-in-law said, "Let me talk to to the pastor." So she got the phone and told me, she said, "No, I'm not staying. I'm not going to stay under conditions." And boom, my heart went back again, brothers. I'm like, "Man, this is getting hard, you know." And at that time, I was driving. I think I was by uh by uh Pik the Yeah. Pikachu pig and I was you know and I said Lord this is too much father you please this devil you know father this I need your intervention Lord and this needs to be settled now and and I got to do this please father I'm putting this in your hands you know and and only people who have who have uh you know fought for souls and Satan has come and take them. You know, you know what what how hard it is. You know, uh parents who have lost children to Satan, you know, they know how hard what a scar left in the heart, &gt;&gt; you know, and so I said, "No, Lord, this is it cannot be this way." And so I left it like that and I was come I know I was coming to church, &gt;&gt; you know, and and and then the the Lord I said, "Lord, you know, I'm going to church. are going to your place of worship, you know, and and so I I came and and then I was sitting over there and I put my phone on silent, you know, and just uh vibration and there were two phone calls in there. I didn't pick them up. I said, "Lord, we are worshiping you and I'm not going to get out." &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, you're going to take control of this thing. So when I when you were uh doing the washing and everything, I took time to get out. So when I got out, I called the number and it was an unknown number cuz she even had a new phone number and I called the number and she said, "Pastor, I'm calling you to let you know that I am staying that I am back &gt;&gt; and that tomorrow I'm going to go and pick my things from the other place." &gt;&gt; I say, "God bless your heart. You have made the right decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I wanted to share that with you. This is this is fresh right now. &gt;&gt; We have won the battle. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; It's a soul, brothers and sister. It's a soul. &gt;&gt; You know, so the Lord is powerful. Amen.
