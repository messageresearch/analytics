you want to make [Music] ready like a rose trampled on the ground you took the fall and thought of me above all amen you may be [Music] seated amen just before we sing just wanted to share something that God is just appreciate he speaks to us that still Small Voice and just couldn't get a scripture out of my mind yesterday and that was man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and and just thinking on that through the day and then you know just we need to you need to have that more in our mind where it's accessible we don't have access to our phone we don't have access to the Bible but is it in our heart and then just being challenged to to to study more to read more and then the sermon this morning was right in line with that and so just pulled up a the in the table just did a quick search on live by bread alone over 200 results came up and there were um so I went to two or three of them and just this one paragraph and all saying it's was in Satan's Eden brother brandham says to his congregations sometimes these little crude Expressions bring us to something that gets us to study and puts you to reading the word that's what I want all my congregation to do man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so read the word study it and study with the eyes of God to give your intellectuals understanding of how that we should live in this present day so just love it when God speaks through different ways to you and and just lets you know he's mindful of you and points you in the direction that you need to go so I know for me I need to spend more time in in prayer I need to spend more time in his word and just for him to let me know that in in multiple ways it's just his his goodness to us so amen this is a song that brother Shelly wrote years ago first time I heard it it was just a special song to me it came on my heart a couple weeks ago and trusted to blessing to you [Music] tonight I was standing on a mountain looking toward the sky when I saw a storm approaching and I feared that I would die I saw God's Crees run and seek a better place too high I heard the Thunder roll down in my soul then I bow my head and cry now the clouds were moving faster and the lightning was Flash flashing bright and the clouds so dark they hid the sun and it seemed that it was night when all it was there was a feeling like I'd never had before up above the storm you could hear me sing God has given me eagles wings so spread your wings little all e go and fly you weren't Born to Live down in that Valley you were born to live in the sky don't let your troubles get you down or drive your spirit low to the ground just Mount up with wings little eagle and fly all at once

bless everyone I ask father remember the Saints Lord in Phoenix Lord and those on the stream and just bless each one we ask in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you amen so good to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight and we trust the Lord will bless you with something something very special as we look into his word I'd like to ask you to stand and turn into your scriptures and um we Chang the title of that sermon this morning to write it down because I didn't get to uh the title that I was working on uh wrestling with the rulers but it's still the subject of put on the whole armor of God and so we'd like to go to Saint or to Ephesians chapter 6 one more time I thank the Lord for each of you the songs of Zion and the testimony that the Lord is blessing us with his presence and helping us amen amen just a few uh quotes and notes notes that I have here for tonight and um and I'll play a couple portions in the message so you can hear these places where brother Adam talks about the yellow and black serpent the Black Mamba and the Great White Horse and so in Ephesians chapter 6 for our scripture we'll take for we wrestle verse 12 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God all of it that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins GT about with what truth and having in the breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Revelations chapter 10 verse 7even but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen God bless you you may be seated put on the whole armor of God in the the title The Serpent the Mamba the Great White Horse it almost sounds like The Lion the Witch and the Warlock but these are spiritual things that have come to us in this day and I want to um bring them to remind us the reminders of these spiritual happenings that took place now this third poll that we have been touching on a bit and it's just such a blessing to us and as I have shared a few places with you in looking away to Jesus and then also the present stage of my Ministry 1962 as brother bandham kind of just smizes or brings us up to speed on what the third poll is what to look for uh there was a a question that was asked about this third pool in questions and answers number one 1964 and this puts you kind of in mind of where the people were in their mind and their thought patterns as brother Ram was constantly bringing this to the people and not having all of the message the people didn't in that day uh access to it in print format or search format where you can comprehensively study it through those Saints um that were actually in the Tabernacle to hear these things hear bits and pieces um you know we have access to all those sermons The recorded ones and so it gives us a little more information and draws us closer to what this great subject is amen amen and so we can comprehensively just look at it honestly and as we shared this morning that when something is recorded or written down the Lord puts Commandments around the written word to keep it um intact by adding do not take away and don't add to it so everybody can hear it the way it originally came out is that right so you know when if I'm writing a story and I'm a reporter and I've got a dog in the fight then I'm going to skew that story based on my personal experience you see a lot of that in the news today you have news that are far right news that are far left and news that's just any and everywhere and then you follow up the person you find out oh yeah he's a Democrat you follow oh he's a republican you could tell by their you the radio program but the word of God is not so that you know when Moses wrote about he told the Jews told every bad every good thing all the details in between it's a real truth and when brother Ram ministered the word he gave you know he's on the field preaching in one place he said that he got so anointed under conviction that he preached himself under conviction you see you don't come up here with the anointing or the fire of God and just going to preach your own thing and stop when you want to stop no no no that's not a true gift a gift is submitting yourself and then the Lord takes over and now the prophet he said he preached the message and he preached himself under conviction you don't put that in your notes I'm sorry that's that happens under the inspiration and this is what you know this Dark Age that we're looking at as I said that young lady that was shot and killed and it was horrible the former president shot at and almost you know uh murdered assassinated and then one of our young young men there brother Dylan shot at on the job and then it's it's just total darkness it's crazy on every level we know that this is the darkness that the scripture talks about that evil and darkness would persist in this last day that's where we are Saints and this is where we're living and so the admon admonition of the Lord is to put on the whole armor of God that's all of it and I don't want to I don't want to to make you feel like you're not studying enough or you have to be a Bible scholar to catch what the third pull is that's not the point of it it's you're sitting down for whatever steak dinner whatever kind of meal and you're just eating from his table all right and that's what you're eating from and there's something for everybody that's God's word that's these Visions it's all of it and the example for us as human beings for the first time it was expressed this third pull on human beings was on wasn't a minister wasn't a scholar was somebody who handled the word that can you know there was a great scholar in the midst the do Lee Veil great man and others that followed the ministry but when God wanted to express this third pull on human beings what did he use a little widow woman that had Brokenness in her life hurt poor but she had a heart that wanted to give and she's sitting there listening to a story that's absolutely ridiculous I mean how many people can believe that a man spoke a squirrel into existence you tell me how that's going to go over at your job or wherever you work how what kind of conversation is that you know you can't talk like that unless you talking to another crazy we got to it's crazies that talk like that and we know when we got crazies that's when we talk like that but we zip that up at the family functions don't we the homecomings and the you know the non-believers they don't understand that a third pool spoke a squirrel into existence but here the little sister heard it and she did something that we all can do she said that's nothing but the truth now I don't know if she was a notetaker or not I don't know what kind of Bible she had I don't know how many books or tapes she had of the Prophet but she had that's nothing but the truth and that is enough and this is where we just take what God has given us we read it we internalize a part that applies to us we say Amen to it and God does the rest we're not trying to make Scholars every or I'm guilty because I need to know to be able to explain the third pool I just I'm dealing with the attitude the shrug shoulder attitude that like you don't even look at it to me that's a tragedy because the Lord spent his time to get it recorded so you can hear it and then you're going to shrug your shoulder no I think the attitude is wrong so if we approach it with the right attitude then there's always something in there for everybody so now this this um question that was asked just to put you in frame of some of the people's thinking back in 1964 this is question number 248 it's paragraph 1 158 in the message questions and answers number one this the third pull and it's speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the Rapture in the Resurrection the son of man this is so or is it not and if you would do this if Pro and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not Escape all these things it's got a ditto there Escape all these things and stand before the son of man now that question sound like somebody that was listening that's somebody who was like listening to what he's talking about like where you get this question from Brother random didn't pose the question somebody posed a question this third pool that you're talking about you speaking the word the squirrels and all these things you're talking and happening it seems like you can speak and totally speak a man ready for the Rapture and what did Brother R says absolutely not no that's not what he said that's not what he said what he said now my dear friend see now I think here that you got you got uh you got a good statement yes sir yes sir now that would be so you said brother bandam in other words here's what I don't think I I don't polishing up on what you said but I believe I can make it a little clearer to people you're believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here witnessed the squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given yes I never asked him that's it Lord let me do this Lord let me speak these things like that do these things there I never asked him that he by own Divine will came to me and said go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down in Egypt but God but was God that sent him down to Egypt drop down to paragraph number 161 what would I do if it was in my power it is in I have the authority to do it but I have to wait for orders to do it see I have to be just W as willing to die this morning on that sorry I have to wait I have the authority from God to do it but now when he gives the orders she'd go back home well see I know that is the truth see just be as willing to die this morning on that as I be in anything see that's the truth so brother Banner makes it very clear that that question coming from the people you get those questions they come from somewhere they're hearing something which brings those questions and brother bandam deals with this third pool and that it is in existence how many heard that this morning we have it here it's inexistence I believe it has something to do with the Rapture he said how many remember that from this morning and so these are beautiful things they're wonderful things they're not the devil wants to make scarecrows out of them or areas that like we don't have to have the answer to everything but we can say what he said and it's beautiful the pillar of fire is with this message it's Vindicated God already Vindicated so I don't have to vindicate nothing I don't have to feel apprehensive about talking about something that the Lord already Vindicated it's true I'm on that side I can't explain it all but I know this is the side I'm on I'm on this side over here I'm with the prophet that's where I'm staying with that's where you are amen and so we approach it that way now this um the purpose of reading these kind of quotes it's to stimulate your faith and I think I did as a minister I think you would have done a good job if the people leave the meeting wanting to go into the word about what you was talking about not you know he's a great preacher do what did you get out of the service did you did it make you go okay let me listen to that tape now and that is effective that's what that's what when I'm listening to the message it makes me want to get closer to God and that's the whole purpose of it all and so whatever level you're on this word is there for that and you know the the the the word comes and these things are there to stimulate something that's already there brother Bram talks about that how many Christians they have faith they don't know it and then the prayer line when he's um operating the gift he's there trying to stimulate their faith to raise up their faith that's laying dment and um he says that in many places here I won't take any more time on it but he deals with it in questions and answers 1957 and um that word doormat it means I I think I got a definition on it here real quick I did something is laying there having normal physical function suspended or slowed down for a period of time in or as if in a deep sleep temporarily inactive or inoperative doormat it's capable of becoming active and sometimes we have faith and these quotes those of you are raised in the message you've kind of heard Whispers of some of these quotes I've been in the message for a number of years I've heard statements on the third pool and those things but when you go back and you start to read them for yourself that L that brings something that was inactive back active again and then you start looking like putting the time constraints of where we are and how evil it is and the next step is the rapture then the third pool should be somewhere getting ready to jump off um to get us ready for the Rapture or great sweeping move to get us ready for the body change and the Rapture and that's what this third pool is and that's what these things are now brother brandom uh deals a little bit with this he brings out something talking about this as I brought this morning how the evil forces have gathered themselves together to become more evil and you know if and you know so and even you know we're fighting a battle there's dark Spirits they'll come even in a church while you're preaching those spirits will have your mind on something else people are streaming movies or texting or emailing and the word of the Lord is going forth they'll do it in a tape service they'll do it because that's the hour that we live in but the word of the Lord the word of the Lord commands attention from everyone and in this and in these three experiences of brother brandham he show shows us how these Spirits work but here he says in the message indictment 1963 in paragraph number 70 he says this here and this just puts us in a time frame a Time block okay and it places us somewhere paragraph number 7 he says I must show and will show that The Same Spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucifixion and doing the same thing I must do that if it's going to be a crucifixion that they've crucified I must show to the people that that the same attitude in the people today is doing the same thing spiritually that they did physically then they crucified physically Jesus Christ the son of God and now today by the same word by the same Holy Spirit and the same word I wish to show the church is they're where they stand that they are doing the same thing today and the Bible said they would do it and prove that this is the day that we're living living in look at what he says he says it could not been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago it could not been done but today this is very timely it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago but it came can be done today because the time is run out we are at the end time and I believe as a servant that we are just about to cross from this land to another now he makes this statement in 1963 so 50 years from that would be 1913 it couldn't happen 10 years from that 1953 it couldn't happen but he says today is the day that this could happen this put Jesus Christ uh to death crucifying the word he places that time frame so he really narrows it down doesn't he he brings it down to show that this is the day that we are just about to cross over into another land so that's the time frame that we're living in we showed you that the third pool is in existence but won't fully be made manifested until the s squeeze happens so he giv us those time frames we're looking for the rapture we see the squeeze about to happen and all of the evil coming up now in this message um I'll bring them in order so in 1961 he talks about this yellow and black Serpent and this message here he had to leave the ministry because there was an element of people that said he was uh the anointed Messiah the Christ and he said that it was a spirit that gets on people so but look how God is expressing this now he's going to give an experience to the prophet with the with this black and yellow snake and so let's go right to the tape there I believe I gave my sister the the the the portions of where it should be where we'll stop and start I think that one is 7 minutes or so and thank you your church down there Billy and mornings there these licensed from all over the country here I say yep one here and one there that's where I think the bride will be two in the field I'll take one leave one so forth and I I don't want paragraph number 25 24 this is in the message Revelations chapter 5 number one is that it no that's Paradox so it's the it's the other one we'll get to that one later this is in the message Revelations chapter 5 number one 1961 June the 11th paragraph number 25 all right maybe she has to download it see paragraph 25- 43 and because of that it forces me to say I'm leaving the ministry uh is because that there is something arose up amongst the people that's caus me to do it that is that I have been taken from my bracket of a minister or a brother and being called Jesus Christ and so uh call and that would brand me as an antichrist and I'll meet God as a quitter before I would meet him as an Antichrist to take away from him uh I heard of it a few years ago and I thought it was a joke and I met a couple of Brethren which I don't see neither one of them in the meeting this morning two or three of them one time in a fishing trip and they approached me by the subject of saying brother brandom aren't you the anointed Messiah the Christ and I put my arms around the neck of both Brethren or all of them and I said Brethren as much as I have tried to be a true servant of Christ I would not that you would say such a thing as that and if it would ever be said of me then I will leave the field with a clear conscience and you who do that will be responsible for every soul that I would have saved during that time see for taking me from the field and I thought that ended it and I heard it a few more times but it wasn't so and the other day in Canada a brother showed me a little ticket of a thing he's packed in his pocket said William brandham is our Lord baptizing in the name of William brandham and a little a precious it been an enemy if it had been my enemy I would have know it was a joke but a precious darling brother come up to confess his sins and his wrongs and his faith in me as being Jesus Christ and I have got letters at home and calls from Chicago and different places asking me if I believe that Dogma now I got all kinds of letters that's come in the last few days and calls some different places so uh uh saying that I was Christ Brethren that is a horrible disgraceful ungodly life of the devil I am your brother now that would run any person from the field that would make anyone that loves Christ run from the very thing I went to the Lord here not long ago when I first heard it about a year ago and then I went to the Lord and He referred to me to the scripture that when John came forth of preaching that they hadn't had a prophet on the earth for so many years until it would uh they was All Amazed in their hearts thinking maybe John was the Messiah so then I John they went and asked him and he said that he was not you read that Luke the third chapter 15th verse and so then but that kind of quietened down so I let it go like that but then when it come to this then I know that something must be done now I say this that the visions and the angel of the Lord that appeared at the river if this is to be my last message or last thing to the Church of the world those things are truth as far as the angel of the Lord anointed Christ or something that was too much for me so I just couldn't stand that and so then about I come after leaving the meeting at Canada I found out that way up in the eskimos or the Indians up there it got among them and so it just tore me all up in the hunting trip that I had planned so long I could not take it I was afraid of a hunting accident if you understand what I mean I got so shaky worse than I am standing here now and I just couldn't stand it any longer to think that 31 years of ministry went down the devil's gutter pipe into the When I'm Gone what would they say there he is that's exactly what it was all the influence that it had upon the people then you see where to be I be an antichrist and I just couldn't stand it I thought I'd rather die here in the woods like I fell on my gun or something and and I seen I was then I thought about my little Joseph and so forth that had to be raised and I was no conditioned to hunt so I just left the woods and come home and I've been before about eight or 10 days in such a fix I thought I was losing my mind and I just asked everybody stay away from me and let me alone because I'm in such a fixed and nervous and upset and all tore to pieces and I wondered if it would have been some enemy in mine it would have been all right but I would just laughed at it and went on but when it come to be precious Brothers precious sisters then that's what hurt me and I said Lord the great things too great for me I'll just have to walk out leave it in your hands I I don't know nothing else to do a few nights ago to make it sure I had a a visitation from the Lord and I seen a precious one a baby a serpent which was yellow and black and telling me and right along and and the thing struck me on the leg but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect on me and I looked down there's where been bit before and I turned quickly with a gun and shot this the thing and it hit it right in the middle of the thing and a brother said I turned with my gun to shoot its head off and he said don't do that just pick up the stick L there by and when I turn my back to pick up the stick it wiggled into some water just a small puddle of water I said Well it can't hurt very much longer now because I believe the brother realizes the Brethren that what would happen I said it'll it's morly wounded so it'll die and I asked many of my members of my church here in this Tabernacle brother Neville and I Has Come approaching me with that same question brothers sisters haven't I tried to be a true servant of Christ before you have not I tried to be your brother wherever it is it's a spirit on precious people many people has asked me that but it's it's a spirit but I hope that the day that it receives a deadly wound and will die out quickly so I can return back to the ministry until then I'll ask you each one pray for me I don't know what I'll do got place up for sale I just can't stand it I I I stay around I'll go completely start MTH and I'm I ask you to pray for me and remember if you've ever believed me if youve ever believed me to be a servant of Christ remember that is an eror it's falsely thus sayth the Lord it is wrong have nothing to do with it I am your brother amen can the church say Amen so we see that brother bam identified that it was a spirit that gets on precious people and the Lord gives them this experience with this black and the yellow snake amen and so this um next one on this the Black Mamba we've I'm sure we've played it a number of times and we've laid it out for you we' like to play that for you here it's in the message Paradox 1961 this is about 7 or N9 minutes or so we'll play this one then we have one more and then North it not is that okay Amen in the message Paradox and this is where the whole start of because later on in the ministry brother R talks about I'll ride this Trail again in the street ports meeting in Louisiana I'll ride this Trail again well this is where it starts and so it's brother um um I'm sorry I'm sorry that's the last one that's the Great White Horse shorter but this Paradox message is where brother Ram is talking about this mamba snake and I'll let him go into that so I think our sister has the the parts on that so we'll play it amen and then I came to myself I thought could I possibly have could it been that I was dreaming uh causes night time see a vision is something that you see with your eyes open just like a dream you're looking right at it and you're you're conscious that you're standing like you're on the platform and you're you're standing here but yet you look like you're in a dream you can't explain it there's no way to do it see it's God's works and God's ways are unexplainable amen they have to be accepted by faith then as I uh sit there a little bit the side of this chair down all of a sudden hear it come back again then I knew then it was vision and then when I come into the vision again it seemed that I was lifted up and setting on a a highway a narrow Highway with some brother I never knew who the brother was I looked around I said now I am sure and know this is Vision the Lord God is here and seemed like everybody was afraid I said what's everybody so afraid of and a voice came and said there's such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you and I heard the weeds mashing down and I looked and here come A huge monster snake crawling through the weeds I thought now knowing this is Vision then I shall see what this uh this animal or this Beast is and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a Mumba now Mumba is an African snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is there's nothing as poison as a Mumba and the snake of course represents s death and uh there is the the we have in this country the rattlesnake and the copper head and the cotton mouth moccasin many of those snakes that if you're in bad health and want to bite you it would perhaps kill you but if you didn't get a of some sort right away and then uh then we go into Africa and India and we find the cobber there's a black cobra he's a bad snake he's a death bite too and there's the yellow Cobra Which is far beyond him and the Yow Cobra uh the patient dies with such a horrible death it dies from suffocation it it paralyzes the breathing system and they they can't breathe and just open their mouth and gapping trying to and die like that and that was the Tye of snake was just one lick from getting Billy Paul when we got the snake in Africa and then then comes the Muma he's dead just when he he's so fast you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with the back of his tail just and he's gone hitching the face usually stands up high and Strikes hard and when he hits you you've just got a few breaths till you're finished turn re it don't only paralyze to get the bloodstream it gets nerves everything you just die just in a few seconds them native boys and track boys you can say mum they'll butt their heads together and scream cause it it's death just in a few seconds see when one hits you and here he was on the highway I thought well this is it so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when he got right close to me he'd run up fast and then he'd get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something hold him off he couldn't bite me and he turn around on the other side and try to approach from this side and he' get back get a start his whst right towards me gets slower and slower and slower and then to a stop then just shake like that and move back he couldn't strike then he turned and looked at my friend and away he went after my friend and I seen my friend just jumping way in the air over him and over him and over him trying and thing was striking at him I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death no wonder everybody's so scared because when this thing hits you it's an instant death and and it was just striking like that I threw my hands up I said oh God have mercy on my brother I said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him and just then the serpent turned to me when I said that and look at me again and a voice came from above me and said you have been given power to binding the worst or any and I said well God what must I do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity and when I raised up my hands to him again and there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like it my whole body was charge with something and uh I looked at the serpent and then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent of blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made that sign like a s capital s made backwards an an sign an means bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head when he made this backwards s that and sign like a conjunction you see choked it to death and the brother was free and I went over and mashed on it I said now I've got to find out about this because it's vision and I hit on the on the thing and it turned like that looked like a handle on a a glass handle on a pitcher just made it solid Crystal now I said think of that how quick that blue smoke was life and everything it left it all the elements and it's turned to Glass and just then a voice came again and said you can unbind him also so I said then Satan that I might know I unbind you and when he did he started coming to life again wiggling and I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ CHR and when it did the smoke flew out of him again and he choked himself right back again and turned to Crystal and then when he did that that boy said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this Oh Glory then it left me and I was standing in the room Hallelujah a few moments I heard a clock go off and my wife had got getting up the children you know how it is I guess it's your house one what am I go to where day Mama books and what did I do you know you just like any home you can't hear yourself thank Hardy for all of them trying to get ready at once and and so I slipped off into the den room and I got out on my knees and I said Lord Jesus I don't know these things and what must I do and the children be calling me take them to school in a few moments what must I do and I looked around in my Bible was laying there and I said Lord if you will forgive me I do not believe in just opening up the scripture and taking something out of the Bible and saying that but there is times that when God can comfort you by such a thing and I said Lord in this case of emergency right now before your spirit leaves me and I I don't know what to do the kids will be an hour yet before they' be gone would you just show me if that was something you're trying to get to me Heavenly Father then let me know and I took this Bible and just pull it open like that and my thumb was laying at First Corinthians the 5th chapter the eth verse when something reads something like this when you come I was planning on taking a fast to the Lord I told him I'd go out and fast said when you come to this Feast which a fast in the body is a feast with the Lord we know that so when you come to this Feast don't come come with the old 11 or the 11 of malice and so forth but come with the the unel bread of sincerity and Truth just exactly what he had told me in the vision come God is my solemn judge come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that is the word then I see what as say Amen to that praise the Lord so now we'll take this last one here on this Great White Horse a dream given to brother Walker and he approaches brother brandham um paragraph 257 or whatever note I gave you there sis the starting place there 257 through 280 amen he said Mr brandom I realized I got to stand before God he said I don't know where I sleep or what happened he said I dreamed I'm going to say as asleep and I dream said I thought my son in a market stuck his hand in a a sack and said when it is a sack of apples and they all turned over said when I went to pick them up there all green apples with one bite taken out of them said I was pick them up put them back in the sa said some of them rolled out and rolled down so I went to try to get them and on the grass and said they rolled under one of these chain Lock Fence and there's a big super highway running there I looked back east and he said the the the chain was hooked against a big rock back in the East I went back there I thought I'll let this chain down then go over and get the apples for the man said I started Let The Chain down said I boy shook the whole earth said the Earth shook from under my feet I said after quit shaking I Heard a Voice and said brother BR was your voice said I know just something said that to him so it said I'll ride this Trail once more and instead I started looking up the rock like this look on into past the clouds and way up there standing on a rock that reached from the East to the West in a pointed shape like that like a pyramid run back here to the East and said there he would stand there on a horse that I never seen anything like it in my life Great White Horse white man hanging down and said you're dressed like an Indian chief with all the things the Indians use said he had a breastplate and bangles on the arms and all down around like that said you had your hands up like that and said that horse standing there like a military horse with a prince like this walking he standing still and said you pulled on the Rings went riding off towards the West said I look down there and there's a whole lot of scientists and the next morning that was Saturday on the next morning I preached on scientist you know being of

big horse turned around way as far West as you could said he stood and raise your hands up like that and he started crying said brother B see that horse stand war on it and everything like that and said that breastplate and everything shining said you held your hands up a little while and said you looked down again picked up the rain said I'll ride this Trail just once more so the whole earth Shook Back and Forth like that and said there was no more life after me I just fell down side The Rock and I woke up said what does it mean sir I said I don't know next morning Junior Jackson Who dreamed about the pyramid you know when it went out West you remember that he called me a month or two before that he had a dream this Burning he had to tell me and I said Billy there's about 20 standing out there he said Junior Jackson said he had to tell you that dream I said send him in just about five minutes he brought his wife in and he said it for a witness he said I dream brother Brandon me and my wife was out riding and said I looked back in the East and I saw look like a spot like one of them flying saucers see the world don't know what that is you know you know it's on we

the horse is gone and he was worked up then day before yesterday three days ago come Leo Mercer coming down with exactly the same dream not knowing nothing about it about trying to breed a big white stallion to a black man and they couldn't do it nervous so I walked up there said Leo and told him what I did I don't want to say it here see I told him what I did said don't you see not to know this I didn't know Ed Dalton had a son-in-law and a son-in-law had a dog with this name you'll know Leo as your dreaming but when you wake up remember it and said I never heard such a command about that time Roy Roberson come in and said brother Bram you remember back before you left the church the first time we I seen you sitting like in Palestine with all the board and everything sitting like the large supper table and then you talk you you wasn't sure what she talking about said a white cloud come down and got you packed you away how many remembers the the dream of brother Roy and said the White Cloud packed you away and said then you was gone I walk through the streets screaming and crying when I come up out here and that little arm crippled up like was reading this he dropped the r

couldn't find you nowhere I screaming oh brother B don't leave that a white cloud coming and got you and packed you away from us towards the West as before the pyramid or anything said packed you towards your way and I cried and I walked the streets and de while I went and set the table I had to look up there at the head of the table so I can just see that much of you Snow White that you stand there and said you spoke with authority was guess into it that every man understood exactly what she was saying oh my brother sister now every one of you conscious I know what that means just watch stay close to Christ let me warn you now as a minister the gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're writing Christ because that's the only thing that's going to because we're in the most deceiving age that we ever lived in it would deceive the very elected if it was possible because they have anointing they can do anything like the rest of them clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said not I I mean like your house Ren stuff you got to do it get all your things off your hands get everything right make ready get ready remember in the name of the Lord something's fixing to happen amen praise the Lord that's the good news that's the word of the Lord that's what we're looking to amen God bless you richly how many enjoy the word of the Lord these are there to remind us to this is where was that was August 65 it's August after the seals after those great tremendous messages that he preached he he say well he was talking about bringing his this is after all of that the Lord called him home just a few months later so how am I supposed to interpret that okay so we say what he said and he said to clean your lives up and don't imagine nothing and don't go for no foolishness if it ain't on the word then leave it alone and it's just I'm crazy to believe it just like he said it amen it's nothing but the truth God bless you so much amen we love him if the musicians will come amen and that's putting on the whole armor of God that's taking everything all the word and there's so much more that's just a fraction Saints that's just a little bitty bit and if you take that whole message that he preached from the beginning and let him develop it and bring it all the way through there's so much in there to take amen and it's for our preparation for the Rapture let us pray one more time lord Jesus thank you for these words Lord it just touches my heart every time I hear it the seriousness the Simplicity of it oh God just to clean my life up my heart to to to be more sincere Lord that there'll be no evil thinking evil nothing in my heart in my mind
