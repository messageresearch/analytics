========================================

open four seal I heard voice the say come and see I looked the for name was power was given us them over the part of the earth to K with [Music] sword ho be all things are possible [Music] only all things are possible lift our hands and say Lord I you Lord I believe Lord I believe all [Music] are I Lord I oh [Music] and while something ENT in Among Us is working its way through and U now we're going to try tonight by the gra of God to take this fourth seal and um see what the holy spirit will have to say to us in it now I'm going to read the uh Revelations the 6th chapter and beginning with the seventh verse seventh and eth is always two verses the first is the announcement and the second verse is what he saw and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of of the Force fourth Beast say come and see and I look and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set on him that set was was death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto them over the four parts of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with beast of the earth now Lord help us now to understand this it's a mystery now just a little preview to back up as we did the church ages these Riders and these breaking of these seals now so we just get it in our mind talk a little until we feel that it's appropriate time to speak now we have noticed now that the breaking of the seals it's the seal book of redemption and then the book is rolled up like a scroll like the old way was it wasn't a book of this type because this is just recently come in these kind of books in the last oh I guess 150 years or something 200 and then they' roll it up then leave the end Loose as I told you how it was done in scriptures were to find it and and Jeremiah and so forth then the next was rolled around there the end left loose and like that each one was a seal and it was a seven sealed book and it was um no one when they was is the seven seal book of redemption pardon me and then no one in heaven or in Earth or beneath the Earth was worthy to open it or even to look upon it and John wept because he could find no man because if that book was not taken out of the hand of the original owner where he had been lost by Adam and Eve and went back after they forfeited their rights of the word the promises their inheritance they remember they control the Earth he was a he was an amateur God for he was a Son of God and a son of God is a uh an amateur God now that ain't contrary to the scripture I know that sounds strange but Jesus said if you call them who the word of God came to and what does the word of God come to Prophet prophets if you call them who the word of God come to uh Gods how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God see and um now they were gods and man if you become born in the family of your family name you are a son and part of your father and then then When sin came in we found out the man crossed the chasm and B up bulls and goats covered but did not remit until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to places and send it back upon its original uh perverter that was Satan when it got back to Satan he waits his time of Eternal annihilation uh that shows What We believe We believe that he will absolutely be done completely away and annihilated I believe that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the bases of the blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping a drop of black ink and a bunch of Clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it Plum back to where it come from and that's the way the blood of Jesus Christ does then that sets a man across the chasm again as a Son of God understand then he's then he becomes uh uh while even he the creative power of God is in him and at least whenever God can commanded to be done it'll be done and we get back that when the the Moses under the blood of bulls and when he met that light the pillar of fire in that burning bush and he stood down there on a commission God had give him and he was a prophet and when the word of the Lord came to him he spoke and even things created by the word and I F to do that under that the blood of bulls what about the blood of Jesus not covered but remitted all together you stand in the presence of God as a redeemed son now see the church is far beyond it standing of living and I think too many times we're pring instead of really coming out and facing the issue I got something I want to say and I I will at the time and I notice that there's something wrong somewhere in the churches and I think it's the denominational systems that's Twisted the people's minds and so forth until they don't know how to do it that's right but we're promised that it would be revealed amen now the Seven Seals that this book is sealed with and those Seven Seals now and then after these Seven Seals are completed we find in Revelations 10 there was seven mysterious Thunders that John was commissioned to write but then forbidden to write those amen and at the time of those Thunders we find Christ or the angel come down with a rainbow and put his feet on on the land and sea and swore that time had run out at that time and then we V find out that in the revealing of the seals that uh the lamb had left his moral work as an intercessor and had come forth now to claim his rights amen all that he had Redeemed by his death and then no one could open the book no one understood it it was a book of redemption and God the Father Spirit had it in his hand because Christ was at the throne as a mediator the only mediator therefore there could be no saint no Mary no Joseph no nothing else on that altar because it was blood and only the blood of Jesus could make the atonement so nothing else could be standing as a mediator that's right there was nothing else so all this idea of interceding with Jude for politics and interceding with St Cecilia for something else that's nonsense that's not I don't say that people are not honest and sincere I don't say you're not sincere and you do if you do but you're wrong you're you're sincerely wrong and anything they say well this uh uh this Angel this is appeared to to St bonifer and said this that and the other and they should say this I don't doubt that a bit in my mind what somebody seen the vision I'm I don't doubt what Joseph Smith saw the vision but it wasn't according to the rest of the word so therefore to me it's wrong it has to come with the rest word that's the way the church ages and seals and all the rest of it I When anybody thinks that he has those seven Thunders if it don't compare with the rest of the word there's something wrong it's got to come thus sayth the Lord for this is the book am this is a re ation of Jesus Christ in his entirety now I believe then that the lamb came forth they didn't know John was weeping he couldn't find nobody in Heaven and Earth CA all is other side of the chasm see sin there's no man and an angel of course he'd be worthy but after all it had to be a Kinsman it had to be human being and there was no such a thing because every man had been born by sex had taken one Bor without it so God himself took that in the Virgin bur and becoming manual his blood was for the one that was worthy and when he crossed this Chasm himself and paid the price and Bridge way for the rest of us then he sat down to be mediator amen and he's been sitting there and the book is actually been closed all that time it's there but it's still in symbol they seen it John even saw it the announcement when the first come forth he said a white a horse went forth he had a ride on had a bow in his hand that's symbol that isn't revealed no it's just a symbol as far as any man upon the Earth that's all he could say that's right he might stumble and stagger no doubt hit somewhere here or there and after a while but we find out then that in the book of the Revelation at the seventh Angel's message the Mysteries all the mysteries of it should already be revealed but that time that's Revelations uh 10 1-7 that it should be revealed according to that time at that time when he did then the seven Thunders utter their strange voices and John was going to write but John knew what it was but he he didn't write it because he's forbidden to write it that's absolutely an all together mystery is not even in symble or nothing we just know he it thundered that's all and now in studying this now don't forget now suay uh Sunday morning we omitted the healing service because of having the answers to the uh to the people's question now I want you to have a question on these Seven Seals if it's bothering you something you don't understand let's have it on the Seven Seals then I can tell by Saturday night worries enough to to answer him or not you see and then just I just say Well about something else or should I do this or my I had a dream them them's all worthy things I remember they're worthy things but let's stay right with the Seven Seals that's what we're right on that's that's what the the meeting is designated to the Seven Seals let's stay right with that I got to go home got have a few meetings out in the west I'll be back again then in a little over a month or two or something like that and maybe the Lord will permit that we can have a something else on that maybe healing service or something that or whatever we're whatever is that we got seven trumpets here to come forth yet you see and that all comes in there to and the Seven vials see to be poured out so and it all blend right in here but it's all mysterious yet now last night we find that the first seal went forth and the Rider and the Lord so help me I never knew it before none of these things have I ever known before that's right and I just don't just go up there and take the Bible and sit down and sit there until when it goes to Breaking forth like that I pick up my pen and start R and just stay there maybe for hours till it gets uh it gets finished then I go back and I find out as I see where he said this I well looks like I've seen that somewhere I get my conard just go look back there something like that and here it is right here here and then here it is over here again here it is back here and down here and over here then I just tie it right in I know that's God as long as it's comparing scripture with scripture that's what it has to do it's like putting a building together the stones has to fit Stone by Stone now last night we had the opening of the um of the third seal first was a white horse and the next was a red horse and then a black horse and we find out that the Riders were the same Rider all the time and that was the Antichrist to start with he didn't have no no Crown but he receive one later on and then we find out that then he was given a sword to take peace from the earth and we find out that he did that then he come in with the dogmas of getting the church with money by weighing a penny of for this and two pennies for that but he forbidden to touch the O and the wine which was a little it was left and then we give left off last night with the illustration of what the oil and wine was and what the effects that it had and it might sound a little rude but uh it just exactly the truth amen now we left off on was just a few moments review of that now and then um we left off on the power of um the wine what the oril represented spirit I guess you all got it all down you'll find it on the tape if you didn't and um where to find the scriptures that the all always symbolizes the Holy Spirit like the foolish virgins of no or wise virgins with or which is the holy spirit then on back in and the the prophets and so forth and now of course I don't try to pull out every scripture in there and these things that you can't even speak about take too much time but I try to place out here with scriptures and so forth just enough to give the people so it'll let them know and see the picture of it but if you sit down with one of them seals why my you could take a month's sermons every night right on that seal and still not even touching see on one of them and that's how how much there is to it but just hit the high spots of it and then you can you can see what it's all about now as oral symbolize the Holy Spirit then we find out that oril and wine is connect Ed in worship always connected in worship and uh wine uh said which come to me that the wine symbolizes that it was the power of was a power of stimulation by Revelation and uh that's when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer Hallelujah because it's presented by Revelation see it's something that God has said it's a mystery they can't understand it see and after a while God comes down and reveals it and then vindicates it remember if the truth is revealed the truth is also Vindicated God constantly no matter how smart the person might be how brilliant he might be in his mind if God don't back up what he's saying something wrong right because it's the word now when Moses went out there under the inspiration of God and said let flies come flies come said let frogs come frogs come see what if he said let flies come they didn't come see then he he didn't speak the word of the Lord see he only spoke he spoke his own word he might have thought they ought to be flies but they didn't any flies come because God hadn't told him so and when God tells you anything and says you go do this and I'll be right with it for this is my word and he shows it in the Bible then God stands right behind that and if it's not written in the Bible God stands behind it anyhow if it's God's word amen and then if it's outside of that it's revealed to prophets we realize that all the mysteries of God is made known to two prophets and them alone Amos 37 now now the power of uh Revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate see it's to to bring a person that's all slump down to stimulation well then uh now there's the power of the revelation of the word gives stimulation of Joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's Vindicated it's proved it's called in the scripture as we want to refer to it as new wine we always refer to it like that as these are drunk on new wine see all right are Spirit spiritual wine I think the best interpretation be be on spiritual wine as the natural wine reveals itself in stimulated power so does the new wine as it reveals the word of God which is spirit amen there that's a see the word itself is Spirit you believe that just read it let's read St John 6 let's just then you then you want say well somebody said that let's let's see who said it and then we'll know where it's truth or Not St John the 6th chapter and um the 6th chapter and I believe it's a 60 63rd verse all right I think this it yes it is the spirit that Quicken the flesh profit nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form and then you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work in Acts because that now look here a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word and then when a thought is presented it is a word now this is the God's uh thought that he has placed in the word and then when we receive it from him it becomes a word god revealed to Moses what to do Moses spoke it and it happened see that's it when it's really comes from [Music] God [Music] I [Music] [Music] oh [Music] in [Music] oh all [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] J [Music] so Hallelujah to the Lamb of God Church he's coming back someday to take us home home with him to stay his glory forever we will share and when that last trumpet sounds we will all be glory bound up there to live forever more oh Hallelujah to the lamb

chapter 16 and we'll read this scripture as a class um brother galante's mother is here and let's all be seated except for her I'm sorry I wanted to acknowledge to stand up sis now she's sitting down stand up sit down this is Brother this is Brother galante's mother and we welcome her in the house of the Lord amen and there's another visitor sitting next to Sis there God bless her too this is my friend Janet hi Janet God bless you welcome amen so now we can all stand and we'll turn into Mark chapter 16 I'll read the first verse and then the class can read the second verse and then we will read verse 20 all together and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salom had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the supper they they saw that the stone very and entering into the supper they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed the long white garment and they were frightened isid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you and from the were amazed neither said they anything to any for they were afraid now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week that's a Sunday he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and they when they had heard that he was alive and he had been seen of her belied not after that he appeared in another form of as they and the and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature heed he that believe not shall be and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues them they shall lay hands on the SI and they shall Rec so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen amen that is the Easter message we'll take one more scripture found in Isaiah 53 I want to greet the Saints there in Mesa brother art and the Saints there that are gathered Isaiah 53 verses number one and two who have believed our report and to whom is the armor of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him let us pray Lord Jesus oh God as we hear the sirens in the background of some trauma taking place Lord we are so thankful to be in your presence this morning Lord we rather be here than the finest hospital or care home or rest home to be in your presence Lord there's fullness there's joy and as we've gathered in your name we ask you to speak to our hearts and may you speak to the young ones and the old ones alike our visitors our friends and Lord may we draw all draw closer to you is our prayer we ask father that you would move away any unbelief any Hardness of Heart any attitude that's contrary and Lord may we receive the engrafted word of Truth in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated to title of the message uh this morning the answer to pain Easter the answer to pain Easter the answer to pain now we live in a time where there's so many medications and medicines that will relieve pain but Easter will actually kill the pain it's not a pain reliever it's a pain killer it deals with the symptoms it deals with the sickness it deals with the attributes and the reasons why and in Isaiah 53 if we took time to read it all through verse number 12 there are uh 13 pains that I call them in Isaiah 53 that Calvary took care of his he had no form no caless no Beauty he was despised rejected Sorrows grief stricken smitten Afflicted wounded bruised chastised Stripes oppressed and cut off those are the the verbs or what would those be verbs adjectives thank you that for the teach a teacher maybe he can help me out he's a school teacher these are the descriptions of what took place in Isaiah 53 very horrible very hard very harsh happening but in the end it says that his he was numbered with the transgressors and he beared the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors and that's us we are the transgressors right and he bore our sins at Calvary so that we can be free today and that's worthy of a lifetime of giving God thanks and praise I amen I I can't think of anything greater this is the greatest of holidays contrary to the little kitties you might think Christmas or some would say Thanksgiving or 4th of July or Cinco Deo or whatever whatever the holiday Canadian day but the greatest of all of the holidays if we had one would be Easter our founder was bruised he was rejected he was despised and then he was sent into his grave and his disciples didn't understand it they didn't have it all together it looked like he lost it looked like Satan won but that was only Friday that was only Friday keep living Saturday is coming and then Sunday is coming Resurrection morning is coming amen so sometimes we look at our tests and our trials and it's so hard it's so difficult it's so Troublesome but it's only Friday it's only Friday Sunday is coming yes the grave can't hold him can't hold him no no no no and so this is a special time of the year for the believer I'm just going to take my time this morning if the Lord will help me but there's a quotation in the true and false Vine and it just deals with this time of the year and brother random says this here paragraph number three and in this Cru great crucifixion time and Resurrection time how it seems to be that heaven just hangs near the Earth during this time I've always thought that Jesus Second Coming would be in the spring of the year just in all Resurrection he was born in the spring of the Year anybody would think he was born December 25th is mentally upset how could the Shepherds be on the hills of Judea in 4 foot of snow watching their herds at night or something like that no the real Orthodox Believers don't believe that he was born along April or May somewhere like that in the springtime like all other nature he was the very creator of nature he come with nature and so I believe he was born in the spring I don't know that he will come in the spring but I have a feeling that it will be some beautiful spring morning when when he appears whenever it is I want to be ready no matter what time it is if it's midnight or daylight or spring or fall winter whenever it is I want to be prepared to meet him amen so it's beautiful how brother random takes this time of the year and he says it just seems like heaven hangs near the Earth during this time why is that because the great cre Creator had given his life during this time of the year the great Creator the king of kings and Lord of lords Ransom his life to answer the sin question for all of humanity if this doesn't work nothing else will work if the Redemption that come through Christ never that message never reaches you then you'll always be incomplete your life will never make sense you'll never mature to what you should be you'll always you'll always be empty and left without that's why this book The Book of Life the Bible is the Mysteries and there's names that were written in the book that had to come forth you remember when brother Brandon brought the Seven Seals and as he was bringing it that angel the the the angels caught him up into the constellation and he saw seven angels appear before him 1 two 3 four five six seven and the seventh one meant more to him than all the other ones and then brother Rand makes a statement like this he says the thing I wondered about my whole life see the question of his life is now being answered when the answers in the Bible begin to be answered in his life same thing with you it only makes sense when when this starts to make sense to you this is the main piece missing in anybody's life they think it's this and go over there and make more money and go over here and go over there until you get this right here revealed in your life you'll still be missing you still come up short you're still empty-handed still not happy but once you get this book in your life and the author of the book begins to open up the understanding oh it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor it doesn't matter if they like you or they don't like you oh my I found the answer to my life and all my heart's desires her being fulfilled and met in the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so it seems like heaven hangs down a little lower during this time now now these pains that killed our lord Jesus we think of the wounds on his side The Thorn and his brow and we think of the pains how they beat him and they spit upon him they punched him in the face they beat him up like a little lamb a defenseless little lamb and we can see that this was a major pain major blow but brother bam goes deeper into the message and he shares with us that it wasn't those pains is what killed him he says that our lord Jesus died of a broken heart his heart was broken and there's nothing more there's nothing more painful than those kind of emotional pains like rejection or someone lie on you or to someone to do something in in that you know you know in that uh and that sense of of working in your spirit to cause you to be nervous or to cause you to stress the great killer today is stress the great issue today is mental unbalance mental health issues and and people can't keep it together up here they're losing their mind they need something to stay medicated or help them to cope they need another movie they need another drug they need something to keep them you know stabilized but we know that the answer to any kind of a pain or any kind of trauma or answer to any kind of imbalance is Easter the answer is the Lamb of God the Lamb Of Glory he deals with those pains of rejection and he deals with it in a very very deep way and brother Adam says this here in the message the mighty conqueror 1958 he says they smacked her so we'll go up a little bit let me take this in here 19 um 56 sorry he says in paragraph 118 many times 19 many times that people judge people by the way they dress or by their State statue man is not judged by how big he is or how strong he is his muscles man is judged by character and character alone I've seen men that weigh 20000 lb that didn't have an ounce of man about them man is judged by character what he is in his heart and Christ was not judged by a physical strength but he was judged by character never a man ever Liv like him or never a man could ever die like him never a man could Ascend up on high like him because he was God I am no man he he made himself of no reputation did you ever think the man that made an artificial eye made a reputation the man that made false teeth made a reputation the man that made a wooden arm made a reputation for himself but but the man who made the original eye the man who made the original arm the man he made himself no reputation but become a servant a bondsman unto men who were Sinners that he might win them back How could a man in his right mind know the gospel truth of that and reject the man reject the offer God has give to save the man from a life of sin how can he do it I just can't understand it how that you could reject such a one when he's not here to make anything that you have to do for him but just offering you a way of escape from the things that you're going to and become that for you when he did when he was dying Yonder at Calvary everything had rejected him they had spit on him his face was full of mockery spit they had a rag around his eyes they hid him in the head and said if you're a prophet tell us who hit you a little woman run in the midst of them and says what has he done but heal your sick and raise your good they smacked her in the mouth and said would you listen to that woman instead of your priest away with such a person and his own Dear Mother walking in his bloody Footprints God let me walk that same way as he went Yonder to Calvary down in her heart was a wondering when she seen her darling child die Yonder a man 33 years old and look like he look like 50 the Bible said his strain and where he probably turning gray and the grim look on his face to where he was suffering not so much physically but as it was Agony the Bible said that his blood and water separated from each other and any doctor anything can tell you that knows the chemistry of blood that only show that that only sorrow will do that he never died from a Roman spear neither did he die from a nail drove in his hand or his feet but he died of a broken heart being rejected he came to his own his own received him not he said brother brandham I wish I could have stood there that dead Calvary brother you're standing in a better place today you're standing in the presence of the resurrected Lord Jesus who has proved himself triumphant so let me think of this you know brother Billy Paul gives a testimony about his dad how if he would cut up and act up he says that said Billy we're going to go to the Woodshed later he's talking about he was going to correct him and spank him he says then later on that when brother bham would instead of spanking him he would talk to him and he said he would much prefer to take a spanking than to have brother bam verbally deal with him you see because of spanking you can slap me hit me and I'm like I can shake it off but emotional something in the heart Agony rejection I've disappointed you you don't like me anymore or I don't love you anymore those emotional strains are far harder to deal with and this is part of the crisis of our day there's an emotional crisis going on there's a a deep problem an issue with people today just on their emotions and I just want to tell the Saints here today that he's still the Healer of your body and not just your body we're talking about your brain and the way you think the Bible says he'll keep you in perfect peace if you keep your mind stayed on him there's enough things out there going on that a man or woman would lose their mind amen but we got a sound mind today because the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ Keeps Us grounded gives us perspective we don't get upset like they get upset out there we have a right we have a home in glory and we know God has a purpose for our life so we can deal with the trauma deal with the issues as they come and so brother random says it again here in the message living dying buried Rising coming 1959 he says it's been some time ago I was speaking to someone about this it was a scientist that said there's only one way that could have happened it was not because of the Roman spear that he died and neither was it the loss of blood that he died because there was still blood in his body what he died of was not because of a Roman spear or the nails that was drove in his hands or the crown they placed on his head but because he died of grief he came to his own and his own received him not he died of a broken heart when he know that the very creatures of time that he would die to redeem had spit in his face and he was rejected of men David 800 years before it happened cried with the very voice that he cried at Calvary my God my God why H has Thou forsaken me so to be forsaken to be left to be abandoned to be rejected is far more painful to a human being and Jesus died of a broken heart Saints he died of this oppression now I counted it amount there's of these 13 pains in Isaiah 53 there six of them are emotional seven of them were physical pains that he went through in Isaiah 53 and so we see that he died of a broken heart and we see that this age is a nervous age and it's a neurotic age brother brandom deals with it in Elijah the prophet 1956 amen can I take a little time all right we sang for an hour and a half we should be able to preach for at least that do we have service tonight there's no service tonight I got plenty of time brother John amen all right take your time you know the visitors always say that take your time I want to hear from the Home Folks brother Israel take your time God bless you all right thank you in Spanish and in English take your time all right here what the prophet of God says here in this message talking about nervousness and how serious it is in paragraph number 69 in this message Elijah the prophet he says now look son he's dealing with this this is in a prayer line he's talking to a young man that has nervous issues and problems in his life he says now look son nervousness is the hardest thing there is to fight worse than cancer because you can't mentally balance yourself right you see you can't get your mind running right but now you start from right now knowing that you're standing in the presence of God and say this hour right now I am healed and go out saying the same thing say it till you actually believe it see till you really believe it and then you'll get well do you believe that now go rejoicing and let me know what happens to you amen I like that here the prophet of God in the message 1952 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever paragraph 39 I want you to say I want to say there's so many people passing through here that's suffering with mental oppression demon manifestation but oppression Satan I seen a vision break before me of a young lady she went back there and sat down a few minutes ago that thinks she's crossed the separating line don't let Satan tell you that as long as you love God God still loves you it has to be a Creator to create that creation in your heart to make you love God don't you believe that see go believing with all your heart that Christ loves you amen how many loves the lord well somebody put that in your heart to love him the Creator put that in your heart to love him and he loves you too so we see this mental oppression we see the nervousness we see that these are issues that people have to deal with and I I won't say it it's because you're not spiritual I won't say it's because you're not a Christian it's just what you have to deal with brother bradam had to deal with it and he dealt with it it it it was a nervousness that would come over him every seven years and it would make him get discouraged and the doctors would look at him and they examined him and he details this in the message on the wings of a snow white dove so the prophet had to deal with oppression he dealt with rejection it's not a spiritual the thermometer it's not saying you're not spiritual it's just that you have to deal with it and God already dealt with it and he dealt with it one Easter morning when he got up out of the grave and this is the answer to all of your problems pains and troubles don't let the devil Sidetrack you and think you're not not a good person or you need to be a better person no we're not talking about your person we're talking about the person that got up out of the Grave he was worthy he was a good person he was a nice guy we're not talking about you being a nice guy he's the nice guy and that's all we're talking about he's the one we're preach about and when he comes inside of you he begins to deal with all of this so brother bam takes us in the message letting off the pressure and he says this in paragraph 24 see it's just built up pressure it's the age that we're living in a neurotic age where people don't know what to do where they're going and the doctors don't have the answer for it because the psychiatrist is being doctored by the psychiatrist so they have not the answer that's right right but there's some answer surely somewhere we can deal on it for hours but I was thinking that God has the answer if they can just set in a place like this takes off the pressure SE with people who are entertained into eternity we're not going into we're already in it that's right praise the Lord he continues on in the same message paragraph 54 and then the nervous neurotic age that we're living in you know in all of this the doctors don't have the answer cuz they're plagued with it too they don't have the answer they don't know what to do you say oh doctor I'm just about to blow my head I don't know what to do well he'd say I am too well there is nothing you can do he could give you a tranquilizer when that wears off you're more nervous than you was in the first place like a drunk man taking an extra drink to get over his drunkenness you see you can't do it there's no answer they don't have it but God has the answer amen that's what we want to talk about to have the answer God has got the answer he is the answer Christ is the answer to every problem we got now we're going to talk about him now so God's got the answer Saints he is the answer so many times we listen to what the world tells us what we need to be doing now and what the answer is today but we already have the answer and that answer has been given to us through his word we thank God it's the most valuable thing you got when God gives you faith in his word the enemy comes to steal kill and dest destroy your confidence in God's word he wants you to leave it on the shelf and try something else wants you to try to get good yourself you can't get good yourself but he's got a way that you can get good it starts by an oldfashioned altar it starts by coming to him with nothing in my arms I bring only to your cross do I cling that's where it starts oldfashioned altar seems simple doesn't it seems like it's more to it than that that's what man will do they want to make it more than that but you come to him and he's got the answer to all of your problems I'm so glad about that because there's some problems in this life how many's ever had your heart broken how many's ever had your confidence taken away how many ever felt like you've been rejected Ed that's not a good feeling is it that's not something you could just roll your eyes at and just like shake it off it's something you have to really go through and God has the answer for that and we're so glad that he died not just of the physical pain but there was nobody that can die like he died he was the king of glory he who knew no sin became sin that we might be made the righteousness in him that's what the Bible says he became sin he who knew no sin that we might be become the righteousness of God in him he became sin amen he became ugly he became disfigured and disformed he was rejected on all levels his closest men that he called there was 12 of them and one of them ratted him out one of him one of his own men one of his own boys turned their back on him and then when he said he was going to rise up on the third day when he rose up nobody stood for him right the Two Sisters went and saw him in the grave they said he's risen and nobody believed him rejected on all levels reject Ed here on Earth rejected in his neighborhood couldn't even preach in his neighborhood who is he the farmer who is he the carpenter son where he was rejected on all levels the ministry the priesthood they rejected they all rejected him certainly did it was the poor and those that were the least of Sinners that actually would listen to him every now and then so he came to the poor and the broken amen he went into the hood amen cuz that's where they received him yes sir amen you all know what the hood is don't you amen neighborhood okay it's the hood it's a neighborhood without neighbors or not friendly ones anyways he goes into these areas where they're rejected are because he's rejected and he preaches a gospel message and they hear his voice and they are affected by his ministry and so he's the rejected one he's the one that was taken out of you know he he was unpopular he made himself of no reputation he stood in the back all the time and they rejected him they should have all embraced him and you know what he's still rejected today am you know the Lord Jesus can come down in the form of the Holy Spirit into a meeting like this and begin to touch hearts and people will begin to weep and cry and the educated and the m and the great leaders of the day will reject that they always do amen they reject the moving of the Holy Spirit they want the picture of the Lord Jesus but they don't want the manifestation of the Lord Jesus when he comes down and he breaks you down and you begin to cry Lord save me amen you cry out in a lot of churches you can do that in when you get so happy that the Lord set you free and you want to go dance and you want to go run ain't a lot of places you can do that in but you can do it in his presence because in his presence he welcomes that amen amen amen amen he still rejected a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief now this day we call Easter this year it fell on what is today's date the 31st of March it may or April or March or April and um brother bandam I like the way he brings this here I have one page or so of quotes that I want to read and then we'll be done he talks about this evening time message and how this Easter these two women and one scripture has three but the two women which is the witness they see Easter for the first time but actually job saw Easter thousands of years before and job he saw Easter not when everything was going well in his life he saw Easter when he lost everything and job himself was rejected he was rejected by his friends rejected by church folks rejected by people that he probably spent most of his time helping ain't nothing worse than being rejected by your own right you expect the stranger to reject you but one of your friends one of your family members your spouse when they reject you there's no pain like the rejected pain and Jesus knew what this was and job knew what it was and here he was rejected and he loses all his family he loses his cattle his donkeys his sheep he loses it all and then he loses his health not enough money to to cure what job had he didn't have an answer God didn't speak to him his mind battles are probably raging high on what did I do wrong where did I mess up at he's trying to reconcile what's going on all job did was live right job sacrificed continually for his family the Bible says he did that continually not because he saw trauma or problems in his family he did that per chance there was problems in the family right the Bible says he did this does this continually then finally a deal was made between Satan and God and they put a contract out on job job didn't even know it that God was betting for him and Satan was betting against him he didn't even know it he's just living his life all of a sudden things start to change and layer after layer after layer of problems come as I said this morning many times your problems are sandwiched between peoples and circumstances it's not all people and it's not all circumstances but it's a mixture it's some people that I I if you just if I just show told you a picture of some people that got on your nerves they'll still get on your nerves tonight this morning you know more feeling will come over you're like I love them but and job's tests were sandwiched in between these situations the first tests were people the civilians came and took his animals the next test was a fire from God from Heaven the next test was was the Chaldeans came another group of people and then the next test was the great wind and then the final hard test was his wife so you see these these human and Circumstance sandwiches that God makes and delivers to job packages of blessings packages of gold yes that's what it is a test is more pre ious than go say what the Bible says these trials are more precious than what and what we want is more gold don't we you said you wanted more money more gold and God sends you a test or a trial so let me let me bring this here so job sees Easter for the first time when he sees Easter he screams out I know my redeemer lives amen he didn't say that before but the test and the trial squeezed it out of him you know sometimes we don't say Amen until we going through something really really deep yes sir amen you don't want to say Amen now he knows how to get one out of you you don't think the prayer meeting is important you don't think praying to God is important there's a circumstance there's a test that you will go through that will put you on your knees how many know what I'm talking about there's tests and trials that will develop a prayer life in you they don't come just by you thinking about it no you're going through something you feel it it's painful it hurts and you're going through and all you can do is pray yes and call on the name of the Lord he allows that for a purpose and he's got a purpose that purpose that word purpose means the reason for which something is done the reason something is created it's the reason that it is it even exists that's what that word purpose means now brother bam takes in this message the evidence of the Resurrection I'm trying to keep this at 10 minutes okay all right huh oh you make me feel so good when you say that keep going it's all right take your time that's why I ask you know you know I'm going to read the quote anyways I ask you but I'm going to read it anyways it just feels better when you say go ahead and read it God bless you all right so in the message the evidence of the Resurrection he says this here in paragraph 180 well what am I telling you Jesus Christ has raised from the dead he's alive he's here amen this is Easter and it's been Easter for 2,000 years but evening lights are shining now it's Shin in the east then it's shining out in the west now so how long has it been Easter for 2,000 years Easter is an experience amen Easter is a person yes am Easter is an answer right that's what it is paragraph 501 and the restoration of the Bride tree says this here but it's the top part where I will restore sayeth the Lord I'll send forth the evening light it'll bring back bring back the word making it manifest I will restore all that I promised all that I promis the same holy spirit will bring bear the same side I'll have a Easter a resurrection for the bride just the same as I had for the bridegroom see evening lights come out to shine same as in the morning same signs same things the same light will produce the same fruit that they had there if it's shining on the same tree amen proves his word now fulfilled I will restore yes amen amen amen amen in the message restoration of the Bride tree says this here paragraph 5:23 father God into your hands I commend this message though it's been chopped up some way I pray that your Holy Spirit would go with it on these tapes and across the nation and if I shall be taken from the earth may this live Lord It's Your word let the evening light shine Lord bring forth this glorious bride of Christ bless it Lord may it not return to you void may it accomplish that what it was been purposed for granted father all Praises shall be thine now did he answer that prayer did the Lord answer that prayer he answered it in you Hallelujah he answered it in me amen he said don't let it return vo but let it accomplish his purpose what what was his purpose his purpose was so I can hear it I can hear this message and it'll bring forth an Easter am a resurrection to me Lord amen amen praise the Lord you know the more you get into the Bible the more you get into the message you realize that you've been related to it all along huh glory to God it's identifies who you are you know for years you go look at the family album who my grandpa was who my great grandpa was and who this one was but that really don't fulfill nothing there you go am ancestry.com I'm 2% this and 7% that and 12 what does that do for you a little something a little chip maybe a little identification some of y'all got some Nigerian in you you didn't know that or Hebrew or whatever ancestry.com why do we want to know where we come from that's because we are Eternal beings and

got off the streets I'm so glad I'm not on drugs anymore I'm so glad I'm saved but he had a deeper purpose than just you getting off the streets Glory he had a purpose for you far greater he had a word out there trying to identify you righten that you were known in him before the foundation of the world as brother Tito said in the back part of God's mind you know there no message like this

them though two more quotes ad Monto listen here what what did the prophet say here look at what he says here the identified Masterpiece of God he says the great sculpture is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires in the last days our pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ is
