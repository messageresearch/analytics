with you tonight it's always nice to see the Wednesday night crowd they are a special group of people y'all really got to be church folks to come to church on a Wednesday but uh praise the lord I can't think of a better place to be and we certainly like to greet each of you and we just pray God's the blessings will be upon you while you're standing we're going to take just a portion of scripture and then I'll have a an announcement or two um or maybe I'll bring the announcement at the end or maybe I'll bring it now so Numbers chapter 25 God bless you um uh we'll take our scripture in Numbers Chapter uh uh uh 23 actually very familiar portion of scripture see actually let's move back a little bit further and go to Numbers 22 and the children of Israel set forward pitched in the plains of Moab the side of Jordan by Jericho and BAC the son of zior saw all that is had done to the amorites and Moab was so afraid of the people because they were many and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel and Moab said unto the Elders of Midian now shall this company lick up all that are around about us as the ox lith up the grass of the field and baik the son of zior was King of the moabites at that time he sent Messengers therefore to balam the son of of beor pior which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from Egypt Behold thy they cover the face of the Earth and they abide over against me come now therefore I pray thee curse me this people for they are too Mighty for me pre Adventure I shall Prevail that we may Smite them and that they may drive them out of the lamb for our what that he whom thou blesses is blessed and he whom thou curses is cursed let's jump over to verse number 10 verse n and God came unto baalam and said what men are these with thee and balum said unto God BAC the son of zippor King of Moab had sent unto me saying behold there is a people coming out of Egypt which cover cth the face of the Earth come now and curse me then pre Adventure I shall um be able to overcome them and drive them out and God said unto balam Thou shalt not go with them Thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed one last scripture and verse number 20 and God came unto balam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up go with them but yet the word which I shall say unto thee Thou shalt thou do and balam Rose up in the morning saddled his ass went with the princes of Moab and God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him and tonight we're going to take a little uh our title will be um um our subject is Bam heart our title is word revealed will there's a word revealed will brother Brandon makes that statement but we're going to deal with balam's heart just for a moment let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on the word of the Lord tonight bless each one that's gathered here we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated the word revealed will and the subject is balam's heart you know this is a very very interesting script portion of scripture as you read it again here um the strategy of BAC wasn't to hire other armies to go defeat Israel but his strategy was to get God to curse them and so he calls and hires a prophet who had a gift of Prophecy and this Prophet had a uh relation relationship with the Lord actually he can see Visions this was god-given gift and so this is a a maneuver he uses you know all the other nations went out to fight against Israel went out to fight against him they thought they were mightier thought they were stronger but Bayo did something different he he didn't fight with them head-to head he simply wanted God to curse them so they hire balum and balum goes to the Lord and the Lord speaks to him and tells him not to go with these men very clear brother Ram tells us that that was God's original will that's right that was the perfect will of the Lord and then as we read there in verse 20 and God comes to Bam again and tells him go with these people and then when he goes the Lord gets mad at him that's right but the Lord told him to go but then he gets mad and sends an angel to stand in the way keep your Bibles with you let's read that just a little bit the angle verse 22 the anger God's anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him and the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balam smoked the ass to turn her into the way but the angel of the Lord stood in the path of The Vineyards and a wall being on this side and a wall on that side and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed Bam's foot against the wall and he smote her again you can see I'm getting mad now and the angel of the Lord went for further and stood in the narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or or to the left and when the ass saw the angel of the Lord she fell down under balum and balam's anger was kindled and he smoked the ass with the staff now balam is mad but really who's the one that's mad in the text God is mad that's but bam can't see that he's angry at an animal and God is angry at him it's so much deeper than the text and so this animal is getting beaten by balum and verse 28 and the Lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balam what have I done unto thee that thou H has smitten me this the animal can count too now all right thou has smitten me three times and Bam said unto the as because thou has mocked me I would there were a sword in my hand for now would I kill thee could you imagine this animal is saving this man's life but he can't see it he's so mad he's so upset that if he had a sword he would kill the animal first you're having a conversation with an animal you never had a conversation with before and then this opens up if God would open the mouth of your animal what what would your animal say and this this is this is very powerful this is this is the word of the Lord you know you're riding on this Beast you got the permission to go first he said no then he said go cuz you asked him twice it's like you you talk god into changing his mind you know he said no first but I prayed again and the Lord told me so I'm good to go now but like God doesn't play games like that God don't need to change it I changed my mind you change your mind God don't change his mind asking God a second time to repeat himself for the purpose of him changing his first answer that's a Dangerous Ground that's a dangerous ground and here in this text we see the two Wills of the lord we see the perfect will of God and we see the permissive will of God God bless you Angel good to see you back there is Angel's birthday the other day happy birthday to him and but we see these two wheels that are working God's perfect will and his permissive will brother brandom brings this out to us so so so wonderfully look at the scripture and then then the Lord verse 30 and the ass said unto balam am not I thine ass upon whom thou Hast ritten ever since I was thine unto this day was I ever want to do so unto thee and he said nay then the Lord opened the angel the the the Lord opened the eyes of balam and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way his sword drawn in his hand he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face and the angel of the Lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold I went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me now God is dealing with this man's heart now your ways are perverse now just if you continue on with the with the B Bible story and the biblical account basically balum is hired to come and curse this People Israel or Jacob and he's hired by baleo who was the king because he feared them uh Israel didn't do anything to them but he feared them and instead of fighting with them he tried this other way to get God to curse them and in balam's hiring he goes and he offers sacrifices to the Lord it shows that he was scriptural in his sacrifices there was there was a ram that he used there was a a burnt offering that he used seven Rams he built it off the the the the the altar properly it was in order it's not random every every time you approach the Lord it is not random there's an order to approaching the Lord you can't approach the Lord with an uninc heart you can't approach the Lord with your own ideas it will humble you there is a sincerity that is required if you really want to hear from the Lord and he said a broken and a contrite heart I will not turn it away so if your heart is right he'll hear you if your heart is right and even you ain't right in what you're doing or what you're caught up in but your heart turns you can be in the middle of doing wrong but your heart turns God will hear your prayer amen and this was um balum offering the offering so as he offers the offering we're all familiar with the text that he now begins to bless the people he was hired to curse and so this raises a very beautiful Point there's three major blessings three or four blessings that balam pronounces over Israel the last one in Numbers chapter 24 he actually this man this man actually got him under the anointing of God and and produced a prophecy he prophesied a word of the Lord and pronounced that a a star would rise out of here and that that whoever would bless these people they will be blessed whoever will curse them they will be cursed and their their seed will flourish he said exactly what God told Abraham he wasn't in that conversation what he told Isaac he wasn't in that conversation what he told Jacob balum wasn't even alive but he got into the anointing and in that anointing had to bless the enemies his enemy and God caused it to be such so what do we see in this text we see that God has a perfect will he has a permissive will and no matter what side you fall on God's will will be done his will will be done with you Amen in spite of you even without you even because you of you and even for you his will is going to be accomplished if you're a part of it if you're not a part of it because you're here because you're not here because you're upset because you're happy his will will be will be accomplished you can't stop the will of God Amen and when the enemy comes in to bring a curse God can turn your enemy to use him to be the best asset for your life amen you need a good enemy sometimes you need an adversary especially one like this here Amen to get a blessing and look at look at what the Lord tells balam and his first offering to the Lord he's trying to get a curse on Israel a curse on Jacob and Look What the Lord says the Lord says I have not found any iniquity in Jacob it's like wait a minute Lord if we just repeat what you said a few chapters ago these people was getting on your nerves since they left Egypt they they have murmured they have complained they've done all the evil you can think of but when he looked down upon them he said I don't see no iniquity I've got to bless them wow and whosoever the Lord blesses they indeed will be blessed and so the prophecy so let's let's go deeper into balam's heart just for a moment to get a good picture of who balam is let's go through the scriptures just for a moment we won't read them all but I'll quote Su second Peter 2:9 the scripture says that balum loved wages Jude 111 says that they call it the error that balum made the error of balum Revelations 2:14 calls it the doctrine of balum who actually taught bik to cast a stumbling block so so here and in Joshua 13:22 they actually call him a sser now this balum had a relationship with the Lord and what I what I'd like to bring out here just for a moment I'm going to read some quotes for you that though balam was trying to curse Israel and though Bao's Ministry B's um purpose was to curse Israel God wouldn't hear a curse going upon his people but how did they succeed how they succeeded is so so it's like this here I can't make God get mad at you unless I get you to do something to make God mad so me just being mad at you can't make God mad at you or because I don't like you God please don't like him either because I don't like him no any more than that well look at all this fals look at all this mistakes H look in the mirror all right everybody got him uhhuh so you can't even be you you can't not even on the strength of the evidence that somebody is wrong that they they did this wrong they they're all jacked up they're all messed up even based on that God can't touch you he won't touch his child but if he gets you to mingle and mix see this is where he this is where he was successful balam and Bao was was when he got them to intermingle in marriage and committing adultery eating things from Another Altar and when that mix happened then God got mad sir then judgment came down so what a testimony we have for today now let's go into the message just for a moment you had to help me out sis just for a minute and these quotes I'll try to read repeat my a read slow so you can pick it up this is in the exposition of the seven Church ages the res the the resume of the ages brother bam says this or it's written this way I'll say he had the prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto God as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the clean Beast yet he was not a true word Prophet for when God told him not to go honor bao with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by his Lust For Gold and Prestige so God let him go the perfect will of God gave way to the permissive will of God because the heart desire of balam God actually said go ahead did God change his mind no sir God had God had his way regard less of balum going balum did not an know the will of God God had his way regardless it was balum who was the loser for he bypassed the word and today we have the very same thing women preachers organization false Doctrine Etc and people worshiping God manifesting in the spirit and going right on as did balum claiming that God has spoken to them even when the commission received is opposite to the revealed word and I will not deny that God spoke to them but it was just like when he spoke to balam the second time as he knew that balam wanted his own heart desire above the word and he gave it to him yet all the while in the end having his own way even so today God tells folks to go ahead in their own heart's desire for they have already rejected the word but the will of God will be done regardless amen can I get an amen the will of God will be done regardless I hope you see this it will not only clear up much of what is seen in all ages but it will especially help in this last age which has so much manifestation and external blessings when the whole period is so against the word revealed will of God that's our title this evening the word revealed will our subject is balam's heart you know we are really going to do what is in our heart you can you can even do what's right action wise but if your heart isn't right then it still in right you can even give the greatest amount or the greatest sacrifice you can do and be whatever uh others would call you to do but if your motive for doing for giving for sacrifice isn't correct then it's all in vain Jesus said in vain do they worship me teaching the doctrines of men the Commandments of men so really everything that we do our praise our giving our worship our ministry is a heart derived it's got to be according to our heart so as we look a little bit deeper we'll see there that down in balam's heart he had a desire and just for conversation sake he went to the Lord and he asked of the Lord if you if you read the entire chapter's proceeding you'll see that you know balum really didn't do anything that wrong you know he he asked the Lord the Lord said no he asked him again cuz something was in the heart and the Lord said go and and then when he went the Lord got upset with him almost slay him with an angel but then the angel said go ahead and go turn him again to go and then so he goes and when he goes he ends up blessing the people because God was using them as a tool we need these words spoken over you Israel and we're going to use your enemy to do it he'll be an anointed one and actually his heart is one thing but his prophecy is another his prophecy was thus sayeth the Lord but his heart was he didn't like those people to begin with brother Brandon brings this out very clearly to us can I take 10 more minutes here what he says here yes sir this is in the message does God ever change his mind about his word you say paragraph 121 you say well oh I could take it vice versa so could Bic balum see but God identified Moses and then what was the proof the word of God and he heard the plain cleancut decision of God don't you go don't try to curse what I've blessed them is my people but you know what balam didn't like them people to begin with oh what how many balms is there in the world today he didn't like that group to start with now after he got God's cleancut decision don't you go but you see instead of doing it it was the same thing like Cain like cor he was jealous he wanted to a reason to go anyhow and your heart will create a reason for you to do what you really want to do all right you'll find an excuse but it's really in your heart to do it anyways but now by reason oh here's an opportunity amen because if it's not in your heart you wouldn't do it you wouldn't ask the second time and this is bringing out what really was in balam's heart you know if you just take the Old Testament record of balum you don't get the gravity of what he did but then all the other prophets after this is what they said about him greedily after the wages he ran in the era he was you know all of the negative things that is said about him his Doctrine and how he taught the children to stumble right you see paragraph 122 now after he got God's clean-cut decision don't you go but you see instead of doing it was the same thing like Kane like cor he was jealous he wanted a reason to go anyhow no no his denominational headquarters after he sent back and said nope don't you believe it I nope don't believe I'll go down don't believe I'll have anything to do with him I won't debate with them people cuz God's done told me they are his people and I don't believe I'll go if he have stayed with that but down in his heart he didn't like them see they wasn't of his group and anything that didn't belong in his group wasn't right to begin with see and he looked down on them and said there has been some awful things them people did surely a holy God would curse such a people as that they're they're illiterate they're not educated like us we're smarter people oh they claim to serve God but look at them what are they a bunch of what we bunch of slaves mud dobers that the Egyptians run out down there why God would never have anything to do with a dirty Bunch like that prophet of God continues in paragraph 143 so we see what's in the heart of balum paragraph 143 of that same message there was one group come to a prophet one time named job they couldn't talk him out he saw the vision he know what was right balum saw the vision and still didn't stay with it so it isn't that he didn't know what the vision said job saw the vision and he stayed with his sacrifice balam sees the vision and he failed to stay with it you see the difference because his heart wanted to go this way anyways you say well if if God would come down and reveal himself I if there was a miracle take place like the raising of the Dead that would change people's hearts and Minds no a man coming from the dead won't change people's hearts and Minds a miracle is not going to change your heart and mind if your heart has a heart to believe you'll believe whether there's a miracle or not you just believe amen and it's a heart issue you try to prove this and prove that and then you prove that that ain't enough and then you prove this to him that ain't enough and then you prove that to a scholar that still isn't enough it ain't about proving nothing it's about does your heart believe and if you have a heart that will believe you'll follow with the word does God change Chang his mind about his word brother bner continues on and says this here paragraph 144 no matter how much his church group said oh job you ought to do this you ought to do that even his wife he said he talking like a foolish person see I know what the Lord said I know what he required and that's what I've done see he stayed with what God told him notice bam using this phony text for his conscience see he said well I'll find out I'll try again now there is where you come secondarily how many BMS have we got tonight that likes to use the phony text of Matthew 28:19 just for their conscience sake how many wants to use Malachi 4 for their conscience sake how many wants to use Luke 17:30 just for their conscience sake how many wants to use these things yet will I tell you I believe they're all mixed up on that see so are these scriptures true yes they're true Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 ma Matthew 28 are those scriptures true yes but if you're using it for conscience sake it's not true to you you're using it for the wrong reason and here balam in his heart he didn't like these people brother random brings it out the rest of the prophets John the Revelator brings it out Jude brings it out Peter brings it out they all bring out what was really going on in balam's heart in Revelations 2 says that he actually taught Balo who was the king how to get the people to make God mad at him this is how you do it don't stand up and curse him don't stand up and curse them but just send some the Midian itish women in there and invite them over to a party and we all you know Brethren anyways and just invite that and then you know one thing leads to a nest a drink here a drink there and then this one's running with that one and this one is mixing with that one that's when God got upset and this is where Satan will catch you and I today is to get us to mix or mingle the word that we already know it's true yes how do we know it's true it's on the tape yes sir it's on the tape it was on the tape before I was born it'll be on the tape when I'm gone it's still it's the word of the Lord but for conscious sake people will play with those words yes they'll play with it try to make it say something it doesn't say and then what he does it is trying to work on your unbelief a false teacher causes more problems than these people out here in the world a balum a dayon a core there the worst things can come in your congregation because they actually weaken your faith amen you know the the worldly schools I can deal with but it's the Christian Schools that's supposed to be Christians and they're worldly they're worse of an influence I've seen it it's true because they're Christians ain't supposed to be Bible Believers they're worse amen so this mixing this blending in yes to get God mad and God got upset with them and that's where the Judgment came down now how did balum end let's go a little bit further here in the message paragraph 147 oh the BMS in the world tonight promised positions popularity my oh my they numb their conscience by them because of their denominations they say if you do that out you go I know you're a good man we love you and he's a good man we love you but you can't preach that our Doctrine says you can't do that Dr so and so said this is the way it is now you got to believe it this way if you stay with us now if you want to I know you had a hard time well I'll see if I can't get you promoted maybe change churches oh you ba that's right when you know the will of God you do it when you hear the will of God on tape do you do you wait for everybody else to say Amen sir or do you say Amen yourself that's right you do it God ain't going to change his mind no no let everybody else change God ain't changing repurpose it resay it represent s it repr preach it retell it God is not going to change his mind about his word that's right we can explain well that Vision was spiritual no it was literal no that came in the past say what you want to say do what you want to do God ain't changing his mind about his word you know when God sent the prophet a vision did you know he sent it to him on purpose did you know that he knew we would be here in 2023 did you know there'll be questions surrounding the vision but God ain't changing the vision for nobody he's not going to re-edit it or cut it out he said it and a believing heart will believe it an unbelieving heart will look for an excuse that's right yeah but a believing heart knows that God said it and if God said it it's his respon responsibility to make everybody like it or not that's right well if I believe that they won't like me brother Josh if I don't I if I say that brother Joe they won't like me no more I can't say it like that who whose job is it to get people to like you isn't that God you think God is worried about folks liking him please he's the god of Glory by him himself he created the heavens by himself he needs no counselor he doesn't need an advisor he doesn't need a second group a team to talk it over with him he is God and what he says is true his word is true and you can Bank your soul on it amen amen amen amen all right God bless you so much now this this brings out a couple of couple of beautiful things just this uh text in and uh uh of balum and him trying to curse Israel Numbers chapter 22 brings it all out how God wanted to pronounce a blessing on Jacob so he uses the enemy to do it he uses Bic and balum to do it now let's take our Bibles quickly and turn into Numbers chapter 31 now if you keep reading you'll see where belck and Balo actually got over on Israel at B peora remember that did remember they got in a party they got all whipped up they got all anointed they got all revelated they got all they were having a great time time this got to be God cuz this feels so good this dancing with these people man this just got to be the will of the Lord how you feel about or I feel the same way just because people agree with you don't mean it's right all right just because everybody else is doing it it's probably a sign that you shouldn't be doing it call it the herd mentality there nobody else helped her out nobody else said nobody else witnessed to her I just assumed that brother George was going to tell her the truth well I assume that Pastor was going to tell I thought the brother and sister did you tell him the truth well I saw what he was doing but I just didn't want to say nothing did you tell him the truth that's your responsibility yes yes everybody waiting on somebody to do what anybody can do I'm waiting on anybody some I'm waiting on somebody I'm waiting on everybody somebody anybody who who who are you Lord open my eyes and let my heart let my heart be right and that I can have this word uh revealed will revealed to me your will revealed to me by your word now numbers 31 just quickly and the Lord spake unto Moses and saying Avenge the children of Israel of the midianites after shalt thou be gathered unto thy people and Moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves unto war and let them go against the midianites and Avenge the Lord of Midian look at verse number seven and though they wared against the midianites as the Lord commanded Moses and they slew all the males and they slew the kings of Midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely Eevee Rim Zur Hur Reba five Kings of Midian balam also the son of buor they slew with the sword the children of Israel took all the women in Midian caps and their little ones and took the swell of their cattle and all their flocks and all their good look at this look at this guy this man balum just for moment when he went to curse the people it was in his heart to curse him manyways that was in his heart but when the Lord got a hold of him he had to prophesy a blessing that was in God's heart so the permissive will actually caught up with the perfect will you you you shouldn't be be up here trying to curse these people get up on look at him at this angle no look at the back parts of them look at them at this angle and C you shouldn't even be here but but and that's the permissive will that you're here but now that you're here let me step in now and that's exactly what God did he took the permissive will and flipped it and we see God's perfect will calling a blessing on Israel that's still in effect today you can't mess with God and come out on top he's he he he's got it all he's got the story written over and over again all right amen amen right amen so God has tools did you know Satan is a tool yes that's right Satan is a tool in God's hands to perfect his perfect will mhm exactly right so balum in the end he slain with the sword even Bic didn't even give him an offering didn't promotes him to a a position the Bible says he he goes onto his own place you think he's living his own life doing his own thing but then God before he takes Moses off the scene first he takes Aaron then before he take Moses off the scene he says before I take you up Moses let's go deal with the midianites and they arm themselves a thousand out of each tribe 12,000 and they go in and they slay them because the Lord want to wanted to avenge what they had did to Israel and in the end he was the loser in the end God's perfect will was accomplished God uses whatever he wants to he uses tools to accomplish his perfect will and so we thank the Lord for that tonight don't we don't we want our heart to be right we want our heart to be what God wants it to be and not use a quote for conscience sake not use a statement for cons like I was bringing a message on how we emotionally will be tied to something we do it this way because we feel like this is the right way to do it but what if you have the word of the Lord on it yes sir then you need to change the way you feel right but for conscious sake we say well we're just doing what we'll just do what we'll just do we'll just do but what does the word of the Lord say that's true God told B so it's a beautiful text on God's perfect will and God's permissive will once God reveals his perfect will to you it's dangerous to try to ask him if he can revise it for your special circumstance very dangerous we see this in this in this text I um was bringing on Sunday how God has last few weeks how God has relationships with other people and other groups that he deals with and he had a relationship with balam when he went into the spirit the Lord spoke to him he said who are these men with you he gave him instruction his eyes were open he had a gift he was this was a relationship everybody knew it that's why they called him and here he makes this turn in his life in his ministry because his heart wasn't right and even though all the other prophecies might have been good and all the other things he did his heart caught up to him his real heart's desire caught up to him and that's what it will do to us today and if our heart really is to serve the Lord and do the good things of God that's what God will allow us that opportunity to do that amen God bless you God bless you amen I wanted to uh just share with the church a little bit first uh brother Bonza is going to he'll be flying I think he's he left the Phoenix tonight he flies out tomorrow and um we wanted to he's the first one in I think four generations in his family that's married properly all his dad is great is Grandpa his great grandpa none of them were married properly with one wife one husband he's the first one in his generation to do that he's taking a stand some of his fathers and uncles have tried to curse him and bring the Doom and Gloom on him a lot of the people in his condition if they they're under a certain livelihood in in Africa and they come to the states many of them they turn from the message they turn from from the word cuz they have all these Liberties and freedom I met I met a gentleman at Marshalls or one of these uh big not Big Lots but this Burlington c c Factory congales we start talking I know the congales know the prophet and I brought up the prophet to this gentleman oh he knew the message he knows all about it but when he comes here can't serve the Lord can't do too many freedoms too anything but I've seen this little character and I don't think he's streaming the service and I I say this um I seen um I'm trusting the Lord will continue to bless him that he'll continue to grow he he went in for he's in a program where cyber security and it was a um it was through the UFA um by scholarship mainly by invitation and he applied for it had no business applying for it but he said his name is confid confido confidence and he prayed and he he said he went in for the interview and they interviewed him they said well we'll just go through the formality of it because this is By Invitation you're applying for something that you're not even qualified for he said he told him he he said sir if you give me this scholarship you will be so proud of what I'm going to do with it I'm going to make your I'm going to raise your the the value of this class and I'll make it I'll make it you know he started talking and they couldn't believe his the confidence that he had they gave this this brother this scholarship gave him a scholarship just a couple weeks ago he uh he tested the highest in some uh class test that they had and so I don't know it didn't win a trip but they sent him to Washington DC all expenses paid he sent me a text Brother Israel how do you get to see the picture where the profet is I said where are you I'm in I'm in DC I said what are you doing in DC he says my school paid all expenses includ uded I won this thing in my class see when the blessing of the Lord is with you that's all you need that's all you need and so we've seen I've seen them grow so I really appreciate and and what I like is is a brother or a person are they teachable are they correctable and if they are you can work with them right no matter how bad or how rough or how tough if they're teachable approachable correctable then they can grow that's right if they're not then then no you can't do nothing with that it's too arrogant it's too much they're correctable they're teachable and he has expressed those qualities and I've had to we' have to Fellowship about some things before so and I say from the last first time he spoke to the last time he spoke I think he did a good job so amen oh I see some growth there amen and so when he talked about his wedding and all the things that's going on I thought well maybe he was so happy the brother uh brother um Robson and gave him a little card he thought that was really nice and the Lord worked it out for Sharon and I will be able to go to his wedding God willing that's the plan and I thought if you wanted to um put something together to help him with the expenses of the food in his wedding you could do that on Sunday all right so he's one of us he's not an outsider he's one of us so okay for brother bons and then for you hear me greet the Saints in Phoenix and um the little group there I know there's questions about what is are we starting another church there um what's going on there well the way the group and and I believe they're streaming tonight the way the group in Phoenix started was because brother AR with his job situation and and so forth he wasn't able to to sojin her here with us as he did before he's a deacon in our church all you I don't have to tell you how how faithful Brother Art was five and a half years even the weekday he was here solid 100% And so him and his family dilemma I love them so much the girls and you know all of them all of the Flores all of them but their their dilemma was okay how can we best serve for the art so he would stream the service at home and then he go and try to visit and he just prayed he fasted I fasted I prayed with him he prayed wasn't an overnight decision and and this is where he we talked about if he could um go to a place uh it would be easier for them to stream and that's where they go to the hotel and um and that's what we do for that so brother George is here been a big help he's been able to go I have gone they uh I've served them communion on the first Wednesday twice we've served communion to them on the Wednesday night because they couldn't be here sometimes brother Ezekiel is there as well but the the whole work is born from uh he's one of our brother arst and he's never stopped from paying his tithings and the tithings that and offerings that come in over there support itself this church is not supporting that group the expenses that come in over there they they never stop paying and that's what it is and I I don't know exactly what the future holds for it but I um definitely if there was a scripture or quote to show that we were wrong then I certainly would have gotten it by now I would have loved have gotten it by now but but um and and like I said Brother Art is one of ours one of our own so my heart was to how can we serve their family the best way we could and that's where this born from and there's a small group of others that have come that haven't gone to church you all know my position on prelighting I I'm very firm against that I'm not into that at all if this was a if this was a disgruntled church member calling me and they've have called me to come and to preach over here over there because they left this group and I don't go I wouldn't go to that this isn't that this is Brother Art and his family who was one of us and this is um this is where it is right now so that's I'm making you aware of that so you can pray for that situation I believe God has an answer I I believe that if if there is any proel liting to do it should be from the streets and I love to I'd love to see some folks in South Phoenix come to hear about the word of the Lord through that Ministry through this ministry and we just don't know how God is going to lead so what I do is you know if it this mistake God will correct a mistake but I can't see the mistake in the word okay and the other thing I was just listening I shared this to brother George and brother Joe I shared this with him as well I was just listening to the tape the other day and brother B was talking about how he was um going down to miltown and that sister um Georgie Carter was the piano player in his church which he said I am the pastor of the miltown Baptist church and then he said he was the assistant pastor to brother George Moore George Moore is that his name Jack Moore they're probably close to the same Southerners all the Moors no but Jack Moore and so you know what what does it what will it develop to I don't know I told this Brother Art and I'm willing to do whatever God says to do or not to do but I am not going to just close my door on my brother that has a need there and feed I'm not going to do that so I know it might be misinterpreted but God knows my heart and the other ministers they'll know as I get the chance to tell them as well so I trust that that will give you something to pray about to pray about I know you might think this I know this might come across your mind but to pray about it and then the the other thing I'd like to bring to you is that and I'm taking so much time excuse me is on the church building so I know there is I'm very nervous about it I might not look like it but I'm very it just very nervous about where's our building at where are we going and um with the school here they've been great to us and the way the time has turned it was supposed to be because the property is under contract to be sold something to that effect and we had like six months from so that would have been in December would have been our six months or so but that time has been extended because the contract didn't fully go through but the John helped out with finding out some of those deadlines and stuff and I just a little relief on that but then I started to think back how we found this church this building right here uh I don't know of another building of this square footage that we could pay what we're paying for this and and this was God that allowed us to get this place and I was you know same trepidation same nervousness same but this isn't my church this isn't my burden the Bible says to cast your cares upon Him because if if if you figure it all out you'll have the reward and the pride to say you know I thought of this and I had this under I don't have it under control I didn't have this under control the pews you sitting on was all God this bank it was all God the way it's all set up today it was the Lord that did that and I'm grateful to it so I'm going to put my faith in the one that has brought me this far and doing that is better than be stressing about things I don't have control over amen so I just want to refocus are we are believers we walk by faith and that's what we do and I believe the Lord has something in store for us I I don't mean we should be we shouldn't be Reckless we have to plan we should look forward we should pray and look and where I found this place I was looking at of schools because they ran out schools and so forth and the lady that was looking for schools for us to go to cuz we wanted to get out of that hotel especially when they're having swimming parties on Sunday morning and we need to get out of that hotel and then so the lady was looking she was like hey there's a building that used to be a church are you interested sure and she gave me the address and I pulled up I was like brother Caleb used to be in this building that's available oh yeah sure they were gracious and they let us come in here raised our rent only once we've been here for seven years if this was a land owner they would have been after us for this that and the other and I almost complained about the AC but then I think it could be a lot worse we're at a very nice location and it it's been good to us now I don't I I mean I could brag about it cuz this is what the Lord has given us and I could complain about it too but soon as I get ready to complain yeah know the sound is [Music] horrible I'll take this over that hotel any day any day thank the Lord for this old old bank or whatever you you know so it's in God's hands pray with me I I'm praying I know the Lord has something for us if our heart is right if our motives is right he has something better than you could imagine sir I believe that so let's pray that way we'll pray that and I trust that the Lord will help us and so God bless you so much we'll take some our prayer requests I think I left those on my desk if you can get those for me brother George maybe I put them here no left them on my desk so thank you brother I know there's many traveling as we said brother bons will be traveling we travel on Monday Sharon and I quite a distance and then so keep us in prayer and the Lord will continue to bless you and bless uh these requests here brother Trevor is not feeling well um this of course the shranos are traveling sister Sheila I guess she's not feeling well or yeah something like that and then this sister Rebecca's friend um Lynette is the one that this this person needs a kidney transplant and so she's on the list for for a transplant we know the Lord is able and we trust God will do that that for them please pray for traveling Merchants okay we got that sanos amen was there another request that we wanted to make mention tonight I know brother Angel's up
