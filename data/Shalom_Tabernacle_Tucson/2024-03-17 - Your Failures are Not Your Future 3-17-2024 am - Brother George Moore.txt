saved by grace but Lord You've loved us so much that you gave yourself for us Lord we just welcome you here this morning and ask you just meet with each one of us in Jesus name we pray amen let's sing only believe as brother Brenham comes believe only believe all things are possible only believe only be believe only believe all things are possible only be you may be seated brother brother just like some guy start trying to fuss with you if you know where to stand know what he believes it's just like taking a rabbit and turning loose in a pen and you got every whole stopped up you stand at the gate he's got to come back he have to come right back to the gate again cuz that's the only way he can get out he'll stick his head to here and almost break his neck go over there and over there can stand watching he come right back that's that's the only way to stay with that word you can B all around your Creed just break your neck everywhere but you got to come right back to [Music] this now see they they they they don't want it they don't want God's word because she held her Traditions she kept the word of God from being of not effect the same now on spiritual Eve she don't want she wants to keep her traditions and get away from the word of God she holds uh again to the denominations and her Creeds in Traditions of her Elders instead of taking the word of God and when the promise of the word in the last days is brought to her she will not receive it because with her Traditions like the Hebrew bride did the real word though manifested proven Vindicated amen amen you won't have it why won't you because there's your time amen she can't do it that's right she can't beat her type see it's predicted she' do it so how you go to keep from anything now the only thing you do just be happy you're in that's all W for Lord all right God promised in the last days that he would manifest and would vindicate his word to her and still she wouldn't do it all that God promised her by his servants the prophets God promised through Jesus Christ God pro Joel God promis who Paul God promis who Malachi John God promised to John the Revelator all them prophets just did exactly what the last message would be to her now if you want to write them down of course you all know them Jesus is John 14:12 and Joel Joel 238 Paul 2 Timothy 3 uh Malachi 4th chapter and John the Revelator uh Revelations 10:17 1- 17 exactly what would take place now amen and to the church what is it the Incarnate Word made flesh amongst his people again and they just don't believe it amen you know what Jesus said when he seen when he done them Miracles before them and proved that he was God proved that that what he was doing he was he had done exactly he he said to them he said oh you capernium who is exalted into heaven if the works have been mighty Works have been done in Sodom that's been done in you would be standing today that's right and and Caper him he never done nothing but heal a few people and told them the secrets of their hearts and walked out am that's all see they don't know what Mighty works are they think it has to be a great big program where everybody gets up the judge makes a speech and and the bands playing the colors flying and the well-dressed women tering and all the PHD llds the big call hats and turned around collars and everything they all had to walk in that's something great God says that's foolish and he brings up a little something don't know what difference between Maybe ABCs Harley and performs something it just sets the real Church a fire and the rest them a bunch of Holy Rollers God calls that great and the world calls it foolish the world calls that great God calls that foolish just vice versa and the thing that God has promised God will and has done amen here we are now still she remains as she did the Hebrew Eve she just wouldn't do it you could raise up the dead you could see the spirit of God Jesus came down Vindicated himself to be the Son of God first he started preaching well they thought well kind of odd likee fell uh who is he anyhow well the first thing you know people going to say of course it said before when his Forerunner come John they said are you the Messiah said no but he's standing among you somewhere see why he know when his message taken place what he was to do am he knowed what he was going to do just like Noah kept watching Enoch when Enoch went Noah said better get close to your Ark the time is at hand Noah kept watching Enoch see and John watched for the sign that Jesus told him or God told him to watch he said he's standing right here now somewhere among you I don't know him but I will know him stand there they said why you the Messiah said we were sent from the headquarters said um the elders and all sent us down here if you're the Messiah won't you come up and make yourself KN up there not down here in this bunch of stuff down here just come up there and make yourself know what he said I'm not the Messiah he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness that went as far over their head as they can go they didn't know nothing about him and yet that's all looking for him to come but it couldn't be a guy like that oh my that would be terrible what school are you from none have you got your fellowship card what is it he was anointed of God said one thing I have the ax is laid to the RO of the tree now that's all that's all he had he talked in terms of a Woodsman not the terms of a clergyman viers axes trees and so forth he didn't talk in ecclesiastical terms but Jesus said there never was a prophet like him never a man born of a woman like him until he's day right he was more than a prophet he was a messenger of the Covenant stood right between the the the two dispensations coming in see more than a prophet and so then um then they didn't know him they didn't understand him was kind of odd like s fell so they just missed him see and um when Jesus come then and surely they wasn't going to accept him this Carpenters boy there wasn't nothing like that with a black name behind him of illegitimate even they see a fell like that but U but look what God did he took the unlearned poor fishermen Woodsman farmers and harlots and left the dignitary set there why what why did he do do it why did he do such a thing could you imagine because that them people recognize him to be the word hallelujah now let's just watch him just a minute here's an old ignorant fisherman can't write his name the Bible said he was ignorant and unlearned he brings his fish up and sets it down goes down there and sees what all this noise is about but way down de inning he knew that the Bible say said that the Messiah all Hebrews look for the Messiah because there was to be a scriptural thing happened when he comes there had been a lot of Messiah raised up said I'm he and let him off with the hundreds and and Parish and everything but see that was a throw off the real one when it comes we've had Elijah's Manel and coats and every other thing but that that's that's that's just to throw off the real thing when he does come that's right all kinds of people it's wore the robes and the garments and been buried in all kinds of hoods turned around and everything else I don't that just only vindicates like a bogus dollar shows there's a good one somewhere if he just find so here he come now these dignitaries come out they were so on their substitute well they said now if the Messiah comes he'll certainly come to cesis he'll come to our denomination he'll come to the Pharisees the Sadducees that's what you think he'll come to the Sadducees there they was see the same thing they have today now but when he come it was strange he would come oh very contrary to what they thought but he come according to the word and they didn't know the word let me say that real so you it'll sink way down I want this to get it that's what's the matter with you today you don't know the [Music] word Jesus said you can discern to face the but the signs of time you can't discern so we Moses said if you know Moses you know me didn't know Moses and therefore they didn't know they just know a Creed that they hatch down amen now let's take this old fisherman sets his basket down PS his Gray beard down walks down see who it is brother said come on let's go down here that's that same guy said guy they said the other day I stayed all night with him last night you know John I was talking about yeah that Wild Man Down down there yeah I heard about him well uh old s know I heard about him down there yeah been two three months ago down there yeah what he said and one day he was standing there he said an odd thing he said you know Harry comes right now they said how do you know looked her it's an ordinary fellow standing there he said I see the spirit of God like a dove coming down I hear a voice saying this is him this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in then he walked out the water and back and so forth well there he said he knew him oh I don't know Simon said I've heard all that long of time but here he comes up the down in his heart was a predestinated seed Jesus said so amen right amen walks up to him walks up I'll go down to meeting and see walks up there Jesus standing there just an ordinary little fell walked up and said why your name is Simon and your father's name was Jonas that in why that little eternal life seed struck in there yes sir wait a minute how's that you never did see me neither did you know my dad cuz he' been dead for years but here you come tell me that now I know that the Bible says now I have to not go back what the Elder says but the Bible said that the Messiah would be a prophet there he is that's him one day he passed through Samaria going down through there with a bunch of Jews you left them and this little ill Fame Woman come out maybe a pretty little lady you know and she been turned out on the street as a kid and she was going through maybe she was thinking about something she walked up there set the bucket down and she started to let the Windle down you know get the water and she heard a man say bring me a drink she looked around there said kind of a middle-aged Jew she said say aren't you a Jew you shouldn't do that it's not customary for you to talk to me I'm a Samaritan said but if you know who you're talking to you br you'd ask me to give you a drink said where's your bucket where's your string well he said the water that I give is life what see why she said um well you all want to Worship in Jerusalem our fathers worship I said that's right but said we Jews know what we worship but said you know the times's coming when when uh man will not worship in Jerusalem or in this mountain that's right he said uh they going to worship God in the spirit because he is a spirit Spirit and Truth well she begin to study you know he said go get your husband and come here she said my husband I haven't got any husband I said that's the truth said said you've been running around with five got the sixth one now and said you've had five and and you you know you told the truth watch what was it that light struck that seed been laying there that was spoke by God yes sir the seed was on the earth when God moved the water away and the sun HD it it come up that's all it needed was Sun the life yes sir and then when the Holy Spirit in him moved away her past life sh show it to her that light struck and she said sir I perceive you're a prophet she said we know I know it that when Messiah comes that's what he's going to be and we ain't had a prophet for hundreds of years we have never had a true Prophet for hundreds of years and she said H you tell me about my husband and told me how many have had and so forth well I said I don't understand this said when Messiah cometh well he's to do that but who are you said I'm me that was it a Hallelujah and the priest looked around said well they have to answer to the congregation don't fool that fell he's he's possessed of a devil that's the difference that's the same thing today same thing today it's just exactly y yes sir she she knew it because the light Struck it they them fishermen Woodsman farmers Tax Collectors harlots they seen in him what the simple scripture said he would do and the Pharisees couldn't see because of their tradition amen they couldn't see because of traditions but the prostitute the farmers and all them they saw it all that was predestinated when the doubts rolled away the seed went to Growing that's right what did she do she said well I'm glad I met them oh no brother right into the city she went she forgot about the water she said come see a man who told me the things that I've done isn't this the very thing that the scripture says messiah's going to do isn't this exactly that and the people could see that same thing as Jesus Jesus Christ said in St John 14:12 it will happen again he said it also in Luke when he said as it was in the days of Noah how God manifested himself in a man and told who was behind him and what uh Sarah did laughing in the tent and all these scriptures of Malachi and so forth predicted in the last days am Hebrews 4 said when the word comes back Malachi 4 said it would return back the Hebrews 4 said the word of God discerns the thoughts that's in the heart and they can see it done and walk right away from it their Traditions hide it makes it nonaffective well we're just here that's all you know he could do the same thing today he'd come right on the scene and produce the same things he did then as he said he would see he promised to do it yes amen he promised to do it and if he would do the same thing the lady OFA messenger is supposed to do it and then if the lady of see a church sees it done they'll do just exactly like the Hebrew Church did the [Music] beginning no matter how well Vindicated is oh it do it anyhow oh my now it says that we would return to the original word and be made manifested his promise to restore again the faith original Faith again and if he made himself knowing that he was dwelling amongst his people by doing these things he could even have his picture taken scientifically Pro it and still they don't believe it he could let the mechanical eye of the camera catch him standing there that same same pillar fire same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 to show that it's scientific in every other way scientifically in the spiritual Realms and every way it could be Vindicated is Vindicated and you know that probably do the same thing they probably just walk right away and do the same thing as they did oh God help us we'll just stop here God help us to see now my prayer as we come now because a don't want to keep you too late God help us to see I believe maybe the spirit upon us to be right now that he' help us to reveal open up this seal that's as we see the state the church is in we see where it has been seeing what they did seeing where it was supposed to come see it there and see what they're supposed to do they did just that now you see where we're at you do the judging I can't judge I'm just responsible for bringing this word just it's just give to me I can give it until it's give to me I can't give it no one else can and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see it and I beheld in law a black horse and he that set on him at a pair of balances in his hand and I heard the voice in the midst of the four Beast saying a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny but see thou hurt not the oil and wine now the Lamb's got the book in his hand breaking the seals broke the first one second one now he breaks the third one and as he breaks it the lamb breaks it the third seal the third Beast now how many know what the third Beast look like look like a man the first look like a lion the other looked like a calf or ox and the third one looked like a man is a man and he heard the the living creature the the Beast living creature like a man said to John come see what it is this mystery it's been hid all down through the years of redemption since the foundation of the world is being hid under this seal what's going to happen now come look what it is and so he opens it up a thunder blast and the lamb opens the seals [Music] m [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h h [Music] h h [Music] all the days all the days of of my [Music] life surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days all the days of

flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the Bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereupon thou standest is Holy Ground more over he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I notice the Lord said I and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land a good land and a land uh large uh unto a land flowing with milk and honey Amen to that unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou H has brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God Upon This Mountain Amen Let the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word let's just bow our heads father we thank you today for the the precious word word that we have read and Lord that we thank you for the songs that's been sung we thank you for these specials that we had today Lord and Lord we just thank you for Lord a place to worship you and a house dedicated to your service and we ask oh God that you would bless the further part of this service now I pray that you would watch over me and Lord bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you may be seated I'd like to take a little text this morning of your failures are not your future the Lord your failures are not your future and we read this scripture this morning that Moses was on the backside of the desert and he was tending his father-in-law's sheep and he probably felt like this was just how things were going to end up for him for 40 years he'd been out on the back side of the desert for 40 years he'd been hurting these sheep and he hadn't seen anything hardly of God since and he probably felt like he'd messed up to the point to where the Lord couldn't use him anymore right and then one day as he was heard those sheep he looked up on top of the mountain and he saw a bush and the bush didn't burn and the and and and God was attracting Moses's attention to the bush and he and he goes up to the bush and the bush speaks to him and says I am that I am and he says go down into Egypt and you tell them that the I am has sent you and he said you go to the Elders of Israel and you gather them together and you say that the Lord has visited you and you tell them that you will bring them out prise God that was a commission and he said then you go tell Pharaoh that the Lord spoke to you and told you to to lead his people to this mountain to worship and he said and and and and let me stop right here and just say this everything with God is Supernatural Saints we we can't explain God we can't organize God we can't put God in our box everything that God does is Supernatural and he does things the way he wants to do them amen and we can't explain what he's doing we don't understand all that he's doing but we have to trust that God is in control is that is that right this morning Saints and everything with God is Supernatural and and we find that the Lord said when you go down this is this is the crazy part he says when you go down I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go he's not going to listen he's not going to do that when I tell you to go do it you're he's not going to do what you tell him to do and he says but I the Lord will stretch out my hand and I will Smite Egypt with all my wonders and then he'll let you go amen oh and by the way you're not going to go empty you're not going to go empty-handed as a matter of fact you're going to tell them to give us your gold give us your oh God give us your reignment and and and give and we're going to take the the the stuff off of their sons and put it on our sons amen yes and God gave Moses this Great Commission and the God made it clear that he God Alone was going to deliver the people is that right out of Egypt now I think sometimes this is a lesson that we all got to learn Saints it's not us it's all him it's all God it's not our job to figure everything out it's not our job to work it all out it's his job he's in control it's not my place to to figure out how God's going to do it I just have to believe that he's going to do it see but God does use man to do things God does use women to do things God uses young people to do thing God uses old people to do things God uses people but it's still God Amen if God gives a gift in the church that gift is is a blessing but that's not the person that's God that the gift is in the person because God put that gift there it's God doing it it's God doing these things it's God orchestrating all of this we're just here acting out the play Saints but it's God who's got the program so the Lord told him to cast his rod on the ground and it became a serpent and he told him to put his hand in bosom and became lepos and then he healed him of that leprosy and then and then he said if they won't believe those two signs he said then you will Smite the river and it'll be turned to blood and they will believe that sign so here we have a man that had probably counted himself out now that happens to all of us for time to time Saints where we think you know what I I've wasted too much time I've made too many mistakes I've failed too often and was the feelings that Moses was dealing with Saints but but when Moses was 80 years old and had been a failure but God hadn't even got started with him yet on he Ain even got started yet sa now now now how many of you in here are 80 years old okay we got one that direction all right and there who's over 70 let me see your hands over 70 how old are you brother Rick 76 76 Moses was four years older than you and he still hadn't even got started yet how old are you brother Chuck 6 12 years older than you brother Chuck and he hadn't even got started yet how many years you been 68 Chuck he hadn't even got started yet now you say where they lived a lot longer well Moses lived 120 years I did the math on it this morning that means he would have been a roughly 50 4 years old in our time and he hadn't even started yet his whole life had been a failure and he hadn't even got started yet come on is that right Saints is that the Bible hadn't even got started yet brother brand said this what is that in your hand he said Moses had been a total failure God come on somebody and there may have been men he said there may be men here this afternoon maybe ministers that's been total failure maybe you've been a housewife maybe you've been a student at school maybe you've been a child to your parents whatever you have been let that be has been and start from today that's right there's nothing I can do about what I have been Let It Be has been and start from today there's nothing you can do about how you did there's nothing you can do about the mistakes you made there's nothing you can do about the vaults that you got but you can start today you might have had ups and downs you might have been in and out and you might have failed over and over and over again but let that be has been and start right now you say well my life has been a mess well it has been but start right now I say well I ain't been the kind of father I want to be well start right now being the kind of father you want to be I hadn't been the kind of student I hadn't been the kind of daughter I hadn't been the kind of son that I want to be start right now let there be has been as start from today God a got started with you yet he said oh I've been addicted to drugs I I've been an alcoholic let that be has been and start today but the main thing is we got to start we got to start somewhere it's got to start maybe it starts with a prayer maybe it starts with reading your Bible maybe it starts with picking up the scripture one nights maybe it starts with Gathering your family together and apologizing for the life you've lived and say I'm starting today I'm going to try my best to do [Music] better maybe maybe you hadn't been a winess like you should have been maybe you hadn't talked to your co-workers about the Lord maybe you hadn't done any of these things start today amen amen come on somebody Gooding see your failures in your past don't dictate your future amen the things youve done wrong don't have to be the things you continue to do wrong you can start today Moses had been a total failure up to this point but he was just getting started and brother Brown says this no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe you failed to go on with God He said if it has been take note to what I'm going to say in just a few moments about this Moses failed down in Egypt and when he was born to be a deliverer to bring the children up out of Egypt why because he did it himself sa anytime we try to do it oursel we will fail anytime we try to get rid of a problem ourself anytime we try to clean oursel up we'll fail anytime we try to get good enough to come to church will fail come to church and he'll get you good enough amen right amen give it to him and he'll take care of it but when we try to do it oursel just like Moses will fail Saints if you got problems in your life and you got things about you that's not pleasing there's can you change them so why do we try when it's him that's got to do the changing I can struggle with something and struggle with it and struggle with it or as brother Brown said I can just turn around and walk away from it and resist the devil and he'll flee from it amen but we're the ones we find getting in God's way brother Bram said it's hard for me to believe but brother Bram said he was the greatest problem that the Lord Jesus had in his life we're the greatest problem the Lord's got trying to meddle with everything that he's trying to do trying to interrupt his plan and our life is that right Saints amen we're messing up God's plan we got to learn to let go and let God have it let go and let him take care of it let go and let him handle the situation yes sir because when we get involved we mess it up amen the you know I preached on it Saturday Sunday night David said this is not my battle the battle is the Lord's this Goliath this giant that I'm fighting it's not my giant to fight it's the Lord the battle is the Lord's now Lord is going to use me the Lord's going to use you but the battle is his amen and he don't lose battle Saints amen Moses was a total failure but all of a sudden he saw a pillar of fire and he saw God speak directly to him and God told him I'm going to do this yeah God tells him exactly the way he's going to do it but notice immediately after this as soon as God explains it all to him and tells him how it's all going to be done immediately Moses starts questioning himself and his human ability and he says well I Lord I don't even know your name he said I am the I am he said they won't believe me they won't listen to me they won't believe that you appeared to me I'm not as care I can't even talk right I can't thank God you don't have to talk right Saints There's Hope for me yet I'm the king of the double negative if you had to talk right I wouldn't be able to make it is that right Saints I you oh I'm not as charismatic as the other preachers I I don't know as much as the other preachers I I can't sing as good as the other singers I'm not as gifted as the other musicians come on somebody we start questioning and doubting our personal ability but the battle's not not mine it's the Lord's see that was just his past mistakes and failures that was doing the talking then and see we got things that we've done wrong and we've made mistakes and we've made we we've come up short and when the Lord calls us to do something all of those things the devil's there to remind us of everywhere we fail right and so this was Moses's m Stakes doing the talking lord I can't do it I'm not smart enough I can't speak good enough and he goes on see we we find that as you go through life scars build up as you go through battles you get scarred as you tested you get scarred and sometimes these scars can turn into complex and then we start fighting the greatest battle ever fought right up here in the old Noggin and as long as we're fighting a battle in our mind the devil don't have nothing to do and the Lord said to him in Exodus the 4th chapter 11th verse the Lord said unto him you're you're whining about your mouth that you can't speak good but who made that mouth that's right the Lord said look north south east and west and who made everything you're seeing am I not the Lord am I not the almighty has there ever been a time sister that I've been less than Almighty that's right that's right has there ever been a time that I hadn't been God and you're whining to me about your mouth that you can't talk good come on somebody and the Lord said unto him who made man's mouth who maketh the dumb the deaf or the sin or the blind have not eye the Lord now therefore go and I'll be with your mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say so the Lord said I'm going to do it you go but I'm going to do it the Lord said who's running all this who's in control here who made man's mouth who's the one that that fashion that ground you're standing on who's the one that knew you before the foundation of the world who's the one that predestinated you to this and if I predestinate you to this am I not able to do what I predestinated you to amen GL amen who made man's mouth amen can I can the Lord handle your problems today Saints is he big enough to handle your trials and your tests and the things going wrong in your life there's never a time when he's not Almighty and this is where Moses said something he shouldn't say the Lord had allowed him to do all this whining and complaining and the Lord didn't say too much but then Moses said Lord just send somebody else and that was a wrong thing to say because the Bible said that the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses see whatever plan the Lord has for you you're the ones got to do it nobody can take your place brother Trevor no nobody can do what God's called you to do whatever God has fashioned now you say well I don't know brother it's a free moral agency don't you think God knows the end from the beginning don't you think his for knowledge shows him what all is going to take place all the way to the end of time all the way to the end of Eternity don't you think God knows and if he knew don't you think he's in control see whatever God has for us to do nobody else can do it nobody can take your place nobody can do what you do you say brother George I just come to church and say amen that's all I do nobody can say Amen like you do that's right oh I'm just I'm just I'm just here I don't think I God maybe not yet maybe maybe you hadn't got 80 years old yet but God's got something for you to do oh I made all kind of mistakes that he's done with me no no no no Moses had made all kind of mistakes but Moses was just getting started is that right nobody can do what you do nobody can take your place it's critical you're a part of the plan of God right see God equips his people perfectly for the job that he has for them to do he made you to accomplish that what he set aside for you to accomplish see nobody could free Moses uh Egypt but Moses there was one man on the earth that could free Egypt and that was Moses now Moses failed Moses messed up Moses come up short and Moses spent 40 years roaming around watching sheep on the back side of the desert but he was still the only one that could free Egypt what about you and me today Saints whatever it is whatever the plan is you're the only one that can do it Lord see there was one man that would call a bride out of a church in this day and he's the only one can do it now you say oh well it's in a bride now brother George he's still the only man that can do it Saints right that's right it's the words of this message that calls a bride out of a church now I might can tell you what he said but it's not my job to call a bride out of a church he already did it is that right say come on somebody now brother Brown says in personal experience with God he says we think of Moses when Moses in a burning bush this sheep herder one morning walking along the old path where he' walked many times and there he was attracted to a burning bush come to find out the angel of the Lord was in the bush now he speaks to Moses and Moses had been a bitter failure see that's what brother Ram said about a Vindicated prophet of God he'd been a bitter failure what about you and me Saints and he says and yet knowing that God was going to deliver the children of Israel by him so you can know God's called you to something but you still hadn't quite figured out how he's going to do it yet yet trying to do it within himself 40 years before that he became a failure and this is a part that struck me he says and he lost all the vision of Victory come on somebody lost the vision of Victory all the church has been dry for a little bit oh we've been struggling for a long time it ain't never going to get no better see all these battles all these failures sometimes we lose the vision of Victory and he said he said uh and the free and of the freedom for the people enslaved see Moses's personal failures had caused him to lose the feeling for people that are in bondage and see Sint sometimes when you're going through the battles and you're going through the trials and you're going through the test and you're in the heart of the battle it makes you lose sight of the fact we're here to help somebody come to Christ that's right all that we can do in our lives don't mean nothing if we can't bring somebody else with us right Lord he says and I just wonder sometimes if we the church knowing that God promised to deliver the church from its sins and from its sickness and to make us a people of salty people that the Earth will hunger and thirst after I wonder if our human efforts and our theologies and so forth and our great fine buildings and so forth that we as we triy to present to the people many years ago we found out that it failed because we took it upon ourselves to do it saints Saints all these programs and stuff that the church has got today we can't keep up with that Shalom Tabernacle we we'll never have as many youth programs and youth activities and we'll never have the kind of facilities that the Baptist Church down the street Scott yes sir but it ain't doing them no good no way that's right see we're in the business of see lives changed amen those things don't change your life programs Don't Change Your Life The Gospel changes your life the Holy Ghost changes your life if we start focusing on all these programs and everything everybody else is doing says we can't keep up with that but we're not called to keep up with that you don't have to have a a youth program to have solid youth you got to have the Holy Ghost in the youth oh come on [Music] somebody he says the Earth will hunger and thirst after I wonder if our human efforts in theologies he says he says we took it upon ourselves to have new schools to educate our ministers and so forth and we left off the real principle the real thing that God told us to receive was let the Holy Spirit lead the church he says we left off of that we've lost our divine Joy he said the vision is dull now people are not looking for the coming of the Lord and yet atomic bombs is hanging in hangers everywhere and these things will destroy the world at once but people has lost their vision of the Lord because we've set times that the Lord would come in a certain time and and we've done all these things and Saints I'll tell you we've times in the message I can't tell you how many times I've heard people preaching on the coming of the Lord is going to be in it was going to be in 2000 y 2K brother Chuck then it was going to be in 2013 when the Mayan calendar ended but I'll tell you Saints it's liable to be in the morning amen but I don't know if it's not in the morning I'm going to be looking forward to next morning but we got to go ahead planting our potatoes amen amen but we can't lose our vision that the end is coming the Rapture is coming amen the church is going up soon and if we lose the vision of that and we lose the vision of of God delivering his people and we lose the vision of the Holy Ghost in the church and we lose all of that what have we gain Saints see he he said it has to happen we know that the Lord is coming but do our lives prove evidence that we believe that see if we truly believe that the Lord was coming in the morning what would it look like tonight before we went to bed if you knew the Lord was coming in the morning what would you read your Bible tonight before you went to bed would you pray tonight before you went to bed what would you do would you be trying to prepare see there's got to be evidence when you go to the court of law there's got to be evidence against against you to convict you of something now when we look out in the world today we see plenty of evidence that we are at the end time when you look out on the street and you see what's going on in the world there's all kind of evidence that the end is near that the cup of the amorites is almost full there's plenty of evidence to support that the coming of the Lord could be in the morning do we have the same amount of evidence could we be convicted of being a message believer today is there if we talk to my the people I work with is there evidence to convict me of being a message believer if you talk to my family if you talk to my children is there evidence to convict me of being a message believer would anybody know if you listen to me talk outside of church would there be evidence to convict me of being a message believer these are just things to think about Saints because there's all kind of evidence that it's going home time amen now we find people in this day we live in a fast food Society we want everything convenient we want everything easy we like everything at our fingertips we don't even have to go to the grocery store anymore if if instacart has got the free in delivery deal yes sir we just order the groceries and they show up at the front door you you don't have to and since I'm guilty of it too I'm not going to fight Walmart as long as I got Amazon on my phone am I don't need that aggravation in my life there's not a time I go to Walmart I don't lose my temper but we live in that kind of society where we want convenience and we want easy and we and we want everything handed to us we live in a society that way and we take so much for granted you know the fact that you can go to your refrigerator and open the door and there's food in it that we take that for granted the fact that we got a bed to lay down and sleep in at night we take that for granted because everybody doesn't have that but that's the world that we live in here the the the poorest of us is Rich compared to the rest of the world and that's the world that we live in and we're used to convenience and we're used to fast and we're used to easy and we and we we want to see that bleed over in the church sometimes Well church ain't easy coming together with a group of people trying to accomplish a a common goal that ain't easy getting everybody to sing in the same tune that ain't easy getting everybody to on the same beat that ain't easy getting everybody to agree on something that ain't easy Church ain't easy Saints it's not meant to be easy it's not supposed to be easy but in a day and time like this it's got to be a primary source of our life it it can't be it can't be unless there's a ball game on it we want to watch or unless there's a TV program we want to see it can't be unless there's something else better going on yes sir everything's got to take a backseat to this now why is it this way well because it's a lay of the sin Church age Revelations 3:15 says I Know Thy works so neither cold or hot and I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing now you you always see this even in Believers to where they just kind of float along and they coast along until tragedy strikes until something goes really wrong and then you'll see them they you see them want to consecrate their life amen it takes those trials sometimes to get us where we need to be amen now what's a cure for this Leo to see and Spirit keep in mind we're not in leot deia Saints this is the bride age for you and me it's a dual dispensation but we're running above leoda and Moses had been a bitter failure brother Bram said and but out there now we see his attention attracted to a burning bush and he looks to the burning bush to find out what the trouble was I love that Moses looked to the burning bush to find out what the trouble was and see we got that same Pillar of Fire that was in that bush that came to this church and gave this church age the same kind of message and we got to look to that message to find out what the trouble is and we're walking close he says fire usually brings an attraction usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in a manner of fire attracts the attention to people and when Moses turned aside to consider the Burning Tree that would not burn up God spoke to him by a fresh Vision By An Angel I'll tell you Saints we had the same kind of vision spoken to us by an Angel Today that's right he said now watch Faith take a hold right quick the old things are passed away but Moses now has a new vision see Saints you can be converted and you can be justified and you can be Sanctified and you can even receive the Holy Ghost and get stagnant and get stale and we need a fresh vision amen he said he has a revelation we need a revelation we need a revelation that tomorrow could be the last day we're on this Earth we need a revelation that there's somebody out there that needs what we got we need a revelation that this is important that coming here and Gathering here and fellowshipping with Believers and hearing the gospel preached is important we need a fresh revelation of that and he has an experience he had met God is that what you want Saints an experience that you've met God an experience that he gave you a revelation an experience that you got a new vision and he talked to God before that he had not met God he'd only read and knowed what his mother told him say you can't be a grandchild you can't come here because Mama comes here you can't come here cuz Daddy comes here you got to come here cuz you got an experience that's what the church needs tonight he says is just stop studying so much Theology and get down to the Altar and pray until a personal experience burns down in the human heart and burns out all the dullness and gives a new vision is that what you want today Saints let me just say this the devil's been trying for years to get you and he's been trying for years to to to make you doubt he's trying for years to to stop you from accomplishing what God wants you to do he's he's tried for years to make you doubt your calling to make you doubt your election but you're still here he ain't stopped you yet you're still here this morning you're still serving the lord today you might have made some mistakes but you're still here you might have done some things wrong but you're still here he hadn't stopped you from coming yet Lord see Moses had feelings of insecurity but God's always faithful to his Saints he's always faithful he's he's never how many times Saints have we almost been killed in an accident but almost don't count does it how many times have we almost got oursel into a mess but almost don't count Saints God is faithful to us am amen how many times has he kept us out of something and we and maybe we wanted to be in it but he kept us out of it and it was a reason for it how many times has he put us in contact with the right person at the right time how many times have you needed something and you come to church and the message that we heard was exactly what you needed how many times have you read your Bible and it was exactly the word that you needed how many times he's always been faithful always been faithful to us he's never left us he's never forsaken us oh we make mistakes we come up short but he never makes his mistake he never comes up short and these feelings of insecurity it's the devil's plan to try to make us feel insecure and and to try to make us think we're not good enough to be part of God's program to make us think we've gone too far that God can't use us no more but none of that matters because God's not looking at you he's looking at Christ thank you Lord and God accepted Christ and Christ accepted you there's a quote where brother brandom says that when you pray God don't see you he sees Christ but he hears your voice so he's hearing your voice when you pray but he's saying the blood that's how we can come boldly to the throne of grace amen amen but insecurity like Moses was dealing with it can cause us to look at what other people's doing it can cause us to look around at what everybody else has got going on it can even caus us to look at other message Believers sa you you can't look at what other message believers do to justify what you do well that brother goes to this game it must be all right that brother does this he's got this hobby it must be all right that sister does this it must be all right well brother so and so lets his family watch this it must be all right right remember brother BR said we all had to be led by the Holy Spirit right that's right and just I don't care what the message kids is doing it don't make it all right for you all right there's a tremendous pressure on you and I to be right brother Brown said it people preach it like we give our heart to the Lord and it's going to be a FY bet of ease but he said it's right the opposite when he said when you give your heart to the Lord it adds pressure because you're constantly wondering am I doing something to be pleasing to the Lord is this pleasing to him am I in his perfect will and being a Christian adds pressure yes amen and so if we have insecurity and we're looking what everybody else to does to validate what we do see nobody else can make your calling and your election sure but you see oh God this herd mentality that people get and that's to look around and see what the crowd is doing and go follow that that'll always get you in trouble see it was a her mentality that crucified Jesus it was it was a bunch of people all tore up about something and they were all yelling out in the crowd crucifying CR crucify him I guarantee you there were people there that really didn't know what was going on but when you look around and everybody's yelling crucify him you say well that must be right and they yelling crucify him and today they got the blood of Christ on their hands for following along along what's what the crowds doing the Bible said they stirred up the Jews it doesn't make one bit of difference what anybody else is doing we got to go as the Lord shows us it don't matter what any church in this town's doing we got to go as the Lord shows us it doesn't matter what anybody in your family is doing you got to go as the Lord shows you amen don't let the devil use that insecurity let God use that insecurity see brother brandham said in perfect strength by Perfect weakness he says we get these feelings we think that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it but then if we'll just listen to the call of God that's the very thing that God wants us to get into that kind of a shape where you feel like I can't do it I'm insecure I I don't think I can do it I he said just listen to the call and when you're insufficient ourselves then we're subject to yield to God's spirit see if we get insufficient we say Lord I can't do it then we got to say you do it for me Lord amen I can't handle the situation you handle it for me Lord I'm not smart enough to get myself out of this you handle it for me Lorden I don't know what to do here Lord I don't know what to do with my family you handle it for me Lord I don't know what to do to help them kids you handle it for me Lord Lord let me you tell me Lord I'm listening you tell me and I'll do it so when we get insufficient then God can use us brother brandham said he says but when we get to a place where we think we can't do it then we yield ourselves to God and he does it so then if it's us trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll just yield oursel to God then God can't fail and there's only one thing God cannot do and that's fail he cannot do anything else but fail he cannot fail so as long as we're trying ourselves and depending on our abilities that's right and so forth we'll do nothing but when we get to a place to where we know we're nothing then God can use us so when the devil tells you you don't have the ability you can say praise God I'm right where God can use me when it says you're not smart enough to figure it out you say praise God then he can use me God can figure it out for me y'all remember that shunamite woman she said all is well but all wasn't well but she said all is well but all wasn't well her child was laying in Elijah's bed stoned dead and she said all is well amen but all wasn't well cuz all was well all was well cuz God still God all wasn't well cuz all was well all was well cuz he's never been less than Almighty her Miracle didn't start that day her Miracle started a long time before that her Miracle started way back when that Prophet was coming by and she' say hey won't you come on in here let me fix you something to eat baby let me get you something to drink let me fix you a meal here let me take care of you here see you can't do anything for God he don't recog iiz it her Miracle started way back when she told her husband you know what would be nice if we just built a little lean to on the side of the house here and we put a little bed in there and a little wash basin in there and then when that Prophet comes by he can take a little rest he can have a little something to eat he can clean himself up and he can be refreshed see all wasn't well cuz all was well all was well cuz she knew who she served she knew the life she'd been living she knew what she'd done the Bible say she was a great woman ain't that what you want said about you so oh I'm a great that was that's a great man that's a great woman the Bible says she was a great woman and she taken care of Elijah she had taken care of the things of God all wasn't well cuz all was well all was well cuz she knew where she was standing she knew the message she believed and she knew whatever that Prophet said was going to come to pass just like he said it yes amen that's why all was well cuz she knew that was a Vindicated Prophet she was [Music] following amen glory see we can't let our mistakes and our faults and our failures take our minds off of the life of service that we're living amen you're living for the Lord today you're serving God as best of your abilities today and don't let little mistake derail you don't let your faults derail you it don't make a you make a mistake so what right who doesn't make mistakes you know what tomorrow I'm going to do probably make a mistake I'm probably going to fail some more I failed a lot but there's probably a lot more failures coming but it doesn't change the fact that I am serving a living God a God who who is rich in Mercy a God who has a blood shed that's covering me and when I make a mistake guess what I'm still a Believer right when you make a mistake you're still a Believer amen if you say something wrong you're still a Believer if you do something wrong you're still a Believer don't let your faults affect your future don't let the things of your past affect what you do tomorrow amen we still got chance we still got breath we still got we still got life in US Saints and we can still do something for the Lord y'all love him this morning Martha in St John 11 called for Jesus because her brother Lazareth was dying they called for the Lord and it looked like he got there too late see they called for him and the Lord stayed two more days wherever he was at and while he was St carried where he was at Lazarus passed away but she said even now Lord all is well even now why she knew it wasn't her job to raise Lazareth this battle is the Lords whenever Jesus gets there he's right on time he's never too late is that right Saints he's never too late in our situation it's never too far gone if you can get Jesus on the scene now I'll C you this David the Bible said encouraged himself in the Lord he come home to ziklag to find it burnt on fire his children taken his wives taken all of his stuff taken all of his men's families were taken and his men turned on him and spake of stoning him and the Bible said David encouraged himself in the Lord see sometimes Saints you're going to have to walk by yourself and you going have to encourage yourself cuz ain't no nobody coming it's not anybody else's job to encourage you it's not anybody else's responsibility and Moses had to realize that the calvary wasn't coming to save him it was on Moses to go deliver Egypt yes sir and when he met that Pillar of Fire and he got that fresh Revelation and he got that fresh vision and he got that fresh understanding when he left that mountain nothing was going to stop him see there ain't no backing up with God there's no reverse in this vehicle it's only yay and amen it's only speak and go forward we can't let our failures dictate our future no matter what's happened there's no backing up in God if they all turn on you just go forward if your family turns against you keep going forward if nobody else sees it but you keep going forward if they call you a Holy Roller just keep on going forward if they say you can't live this life today keep going forward if Mama says you lost your mind keep going forward if they won't let you come to their church just keep on going forward if the doctor says it's cancer you just keep on going forward if they say you'll never get well just keep on going forward they say oh it's depression you never get over just keep on going forward they say the anxiety is too intense keep going forward but this is an individual Affair nobody can walk it but you yes sir nobody could deliver e Egypt but Moses nobody could deliver the children of Israel but Moses nobody can do it but him and nobody can walk your walk but you nobody can nobody can give you a revelation nobody nobody can guide your footsteps but you Hallelujah nobody can receive this message for you now Sam ear in church age I've read this to you many times there's a reason for that because it's my favorite quote but he says in every single Hour Bar None it says the very same thing to the opening and closing message to each age unto the messenger of Ephesus samna pergamus thar Sardis Philadelphia leosia write these things saith he etc etc he let he that has an ear let him singular hear what the spirit says to the churches now notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age so Jesus by revelations you can read that in Revelations 3rd Chapter address himself to only one person in each age is that what the Bible says Saints well that person for our age was this man right here not a not a group of people not a bunch of Believers one man he addressed himself to one man is that what the Bible says Saints are we just reading that out of the Bible unto the angel of the Church of Lea unto the angel of the Church of samna Unto the angel of the Church of Ephesians is that right so he he addressed himself to Only One messenger for each age and only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all so if you got a problem listening to tapes it's then broadcast to all but though it's broadcast to all who come within range of the message that message is is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way oh God aren't you glad to be part of a certain qualified group that has the ability to hear what the messenger saying in a certain way each individual of that group here it goes each individual so we are collectively a group and we are collectively a group receiving what the messenger says but each individual in this group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger see one of you can listen to the message and say that was God speaking and the next person can listen to it and say well it wasn't it wasn't nothing to me why you've got the ability to hear what the messenger is saying those who here are not getting their own private revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God nobody can receive this for you you have to receive it for yourself oh we can broadcast the message to all I can preach the message to all but each one of us has to receive it as an individual yes see we can't be in the message cause Mama's in the message and we can't be in the message cuz our Daddy's in the message we got to be in the message cuz we're in the message and we got the message in us now that being said it sure is nice it sure is an encouragement when the Lord sends you somebody who sees what you see it sure does make make you feel better you might have been walking what you thought was alone but you're not alone and it sure is nice to when you run into a brother and talk to him a little while and he says the same things you think it sure is an encouragement it sure is nice to be struggling and then somebody send you the right quote or somebody sends you the right scripture or you get a call from somebody and they say the right thing it sure is nice but whether anybody calls or not at the end of the day whether anybody sees it or not you got to stand on what the Lord is showing you amen so if God shows you that he's a Healer don't be scared if God shows you what he's going to do don't don't fear it's not you it's him I if God shows you that you're going to be delivered fear not the Bible said if it shows you that the Cancer's gone fear not If he if he shows you that no matter what he's going to find a way to pay that light bill next week fear not he's going to do it if he if he shows you a promise in the word fear not don't let people scare you don't let people be a make you afraid be aware of that herd mentality that's going around be aware of that group think that's going on just because a bunch of people say the same thing don't make it right there was 400 prophets prophesying to josaphat Ahab said go on up and take raymo Gilead every one of them was wrong there was only one right so just CA a bunch of people all say the same thing don't make it right amen can the musicians go ahead and come we'll close you love the Lord this morning don't be afraid today Saints to stand flat-footed on what God is showing on you when Moses left that burning bush he left a different person he left with a revelation and not only did he leave with a revelation but he went and did all that God had him do that's right he accomplished the purpose that God had for his life and you and I Saints we're going to accomplish what God has for us we're going to do what God has for us to do amen you got a song sis just play God's covenant with Abraham brother Brown said Jesus constantly fear not fear not I am he that was dead and alive forever more fear not fear not for I am with thee always even to the end of the world fear not and the Christian keeps sitting back and say oh I just wonder oh oh he says oh my turn loose get all the things away from you say Mr Satan you're defeated I read you this quote the other night Mr Satan you're defeated Jesus Christ stripped you of every Power you had when he died at Calvary every Power he had was stripped at Calvary and he says you're nothing but a bluff and you can't Bluff me amen I'm made out of stuff that don't Bluff that's what come from Calvary Hallelujah I it don't Bluff and don't receive it he said so just step aside and I'm moving on for Christ amen he says you'll see the red light go over the hill where the devil's leaving he says that's right God will take care of his own that's you Saints God will take care of his own and all things work together for good to them that love him he moves on let me ask you something Saints is God going to lose a one God ain't going to lose a [Music] one let me ask you this if you need to see something will God show you yes he does if you need to see it God will show you let me ask you this if God don't show you can you see it we can only see what we see now if you go along with something cuz everybody else is saying it then you're just a miserable hypocrite you got to see what you see you can only see what you see and trust this Saints if God needs you to see something he'll show you if you keep an open mind you keep an open heart you're seeking the Lord You're praying God show me what I need to see show me where I need to go show me what I need to do Lord show me where I need to make a step show me where I need to turn show me where I need to God will show you but until he shows you stand right where you're standing stand on the word that he has shown you and if he wants you to see something else he'll show you that also but don't be scared at what everybody else is doing don't be scared at what everybody else is saying you stay with what God has shown you you can only see what you see in Moses's failures God did not leave him on the back side of the desert in Moses's faults God did not leave him on the back side of the desert and we can't let our mistakes and our failures dictate our future speak and go forward settle it in your heart this morning that you are God's Property you belong to him and you will fulfill the desires of his heart and there's no devil in hell that can change it your failures do not dictate your future can we bow our heads just with our heads bowed this morning and with our hearts bowed to the Lord if there'd be anyone and you say brother George I I've made some mistakes and I have been a failure and I I don't know that I'm serving the lord today but I want to serve him and I want to be a part of this Kingdom and I want to receive it as an individual and I want a revelation
