town there so amen I y'all surprised I remembered your names I am too really pretty proud of that amen so God bless you all just welcome tonight amen amen good to have everyone in the house of the Lord amen amen amen we'll get right into the word tonight if you want to stand and turn your Bibles to Matthew the 19th Chapter I want to take up too much time you enjoy that message this morning amen Thanksgiving in the golden AG age and uh my how it ought to be the Golden Age of Thanksgiving for us amen I was thinking about these reports and stuff that's come up and 10p part series slandering the prophet and Saints I'll just be honest with you I don't care what a reporter says I it don't mean nothing to me uh I know what this message means to my life and I I know that God Vindicated it to me early on and I had looked for nothing else since and so I don't care what some reporter says or what some news article says I I believe what the word of God says and I think if there's a question about it we should do what Jesus said and search the scriptures not searching Google or searching uh searching uh uh some repor uh some something like that but let's search the scriptures and see if the message is true or not amen Matthew the 19th Chapter 16th verse and we'll read down through the 22nd and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments and he said unto him which and Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness on thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and the young man sath unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet and Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions and over in Mark the 12th chapter we'll read and the 29th verse so brother random brings this out that this young man had been keeping the Commandments but he knew that there was something that he still didn't have he knew even though he'd been keeping the Commandments he knew that there was something that that he did not have eternal life and mark the 12th chapter 29th verse Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is hear oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and there is none other commandment greater than these shall we bow our heads Heavenly Father we're so so grateful tonight to be here with the purchase of your blood the redeemed Lord of this age Lord the Bride of Jesus Christ and Lord It's a privilege to be assembled here Lord in your presence and father we thank you for the songs that we've heard we thank you for the musicians we thank you for the worship oh Lord we thank you for all these good things Lord as a they approaches of Thanksgiving we give you thanks for these things oh but Lord it would all be for not unless you come and visit with us Lord and oh God it's our desire to suck with you tonight Lord we invite your presence Lord in to our midst father that you might minister to our needs Lord we long for your presence we long to be in your presence Lord and father we just pray that you would grace us and bless us with your presence tonight Lord we pray that you'd watch over the further part of this service I ask you to bind my lips before I speak anything unpleasing to you and will commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you may be seated the title of the message tonight is heart soul mind and strength and the Bible says in Matthew the 22nd chapter that the Pharisees came tempting Jesus and asked him what the greatest commandment in the law was and Jesus knew that they were tempting him when he gave them the answer and Jesus told them to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength and he said the second commandment was the same it was to love thy neighbor as thy so turn to your neighbor and says the Bible says I got to love you tonight the Bible says I got to love you whether when you're in a good mood or when you're in a bad mood I got to love you when when you're easy to get along with or when it's hard I got to love you when I'm agreeing with you or when I'm disagreeing with you I got to love you when you're in the right or when you're in the wrong I got to love you in the good times I got to love you and in the bad times I got to love you because the Bible says I got to love you is that right and it said no commandment was greater than these two no commandment was greater he told them that on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets all the books of the law all the books of the prophets I'm going to go ahead and tell you that's all the word Saints and and on the on these two laws of loving the Lord thy God and loving your neighbor as yourself honoring your brother brother and sister all the word is hanging on those two Commandments tonight and he and no commandment is greater he said and and it's a pretty big deal is it and and all of these things and so this entire word that we believe is hanging hinging on two things that we love him with all of our hearts all of our soul all of our mind all of our strength and that we love our brother and sister all the words hanging on it and you remember the Pharisees they came and they were tempting him and Jesus answered knowing what he was doing and you remember the Rich Young Ruler Jes Jesus knew exactly where to get the Rich Young Ruler at he knew where to get him he knows where we fall short Saints we ain't got to tell him he already knows he said honor your father and mother he said oh I've done that Lord check don't kill I haven't killed check don't don't bear false witness I haven't bore false witness check I've I've done all these things since my youth don't commit adultery check Lord I'm I'm in good shape but then he said sell all you got and give it to the poor four and the man said whoa you went too far that time you went too far you meddling now preacher because there was a part of him that he wasn't willing to let go of now to him it was money but to you and I it might be something different might be a pride it might be a grudge that we got we're not willing to let go might be some amusement or some worldly fashion or or some of the world that we like to do that we're not willing to let go but make no mistake he knows is that right and so notice all these items that Jesus was listing to this young man were just the Commandments he's said honor your father and mother don't kill don't bear false witness don't commit adultery now there is no Commandment that says to sell all you have and give to the poor that's not a commandment but Jesus told him if he wanted eternal life he had to do it because there is a Commandment that says you have to love the Lord with all your heart all your soul all your mind all your strength there is a Commandment that says you got to love your neighbor as yourself and that and and selling all you have to feed the poor that's part of it is that right Saints now you don't have to do those things to have eternal life unless it's something that you're not willing to do okay see he wants to be our Lord not just our savior but also our Lord and he knows where we're holding back at and and so he wants it all doesn't he now if you notice uh all you single ladies in here tonight this was not a bad guy this was a really good guy this was a nice young man the kind of young man you wouldn't mind taking home to Mom and Dad this was a nice young man he he he was he was he honored his father and mother he fed you know he did all kinds of good things brother Ram said he was a good church member and and he was serving the lord pretty well H but he just couldn't give Jesus everything he couldn't let go of the money now whatever that is to you and I it might not be money but but it might be our time that we can't let go of you know sometime we want our personal time we want to have our time our downtime our relaxation time and if you're serving the lord sometimes brother Israel it's inconvenient it'll mess with your personal time amen but he wants our time also doesn't he amen and notice after this interaction this Young Ruler he didn't get poor after this interaction he he didn't get worse after this interaction he didn't have this interaction with Jesus leave away sorrowful and get worse that his life went into shambles no no he he got he got better he he got more money he got more stuff he had to build more barns he had to get more uh uh uh stuff to house all of his his stuff he had to have bigger Barns and so forth but the Bible found him in Hell asking for Lazarus to cross the chasm and dip his finger in the water and put it on his tongue because the Flames of hell were tormenting him and this was a good young church member because we have to serve the Lord with our heart soul mind and strength and you cannot do that without the the love of God in your life it it it takes a conversion to serve the Lord tonight it takes a conversion you can't live this life without being converted you can't serve the Lord without being converted you you you can't expect for people that do not love the Lord to operate under Christian principles under Christian values you know people get we we seem like we get shocked when we see the things that go on in the world SS we shouldn't be shocked at what goes on in the world those people are just doing what their nature dictates they do they're just being like a good pig if you will see we were all pigs at one time but we had to have a nature change and he said you can't blame a pig for wallering in the mud for eating slop you can't do it you got to change his nature to that of a sheep is that right Saints and so you find things in the world it's shocking and and and you know we try to talk to people in the world and and if you talk like for example marriage and divorce if you're in this world today and and and you're married and you're living a worldly life and something happens that you don't like it's nothing in the world to put your wife or put your husband away and go find you another one now you can't deal with those people the way we deal with it as a church because they don't understand what we're talking about because on all the law and the prophets are hinging on the love of God so we don't act shocked we got one set of rules and the world has another we got one thing that we abide by the world has something else see but Believers shouldn't be operating like the world either should they now there's a young lady at my work that she talks to me about her marital uh issues and things and and wants counseling and so forth and she's like what do I need to do here what do you and your wife do and I just tell her I said there's nothing I can tell you what we do but it won't mean anything to you because we're Believers we're Christians and and you you got to start right there first before I can help you because the things that apply to our life don't apply to yours because we have a common Faith that's why prison Ministries that I used to work in they they didn't work well because they would try to pick some kind of curriculum that's based on the Bible and Bible principles and they would try to teach the inmates these Bible principles well you can't give an inmate a set of laws and expect him to obey it he's an inmate that's what he's in jail cuz he couldn't obey the law to begin with you got to have a conversion you you got to change the nature and if you change the nature it's not a law no more now we can't expect our family members that don't believe this message that don't love the Lord Lord we we can't expect them to understand what we're talking about they can't understand this this is based on our love to God it's based on our love to each other and our love to God they don't understand what we're talking about but if there's a conversion takes place even young believers that haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost you cannot expect a young believer or a believer that does not have the Holy Ghost to operate at the same capacity as someone that has it now is that right Saints you you can't expect it you would not take a child that's learning to walk and spank him every time he falls down he's a child he's learning to walk he don't know what he's doing yet you got to let him grow you'll ruin him if you whoop him every time he falls down now if he's 40 years old and he's still walking on your feet then then then you got a problem there you need to do something about it but while he's a child while he's growing let him grow now we find this is it's it's you can live a holy life on your own is called legalism you can clean yourself up you can wear the right kind of clothes and say the right kind of words and talk the right kind of talk and and you can do all of those things and you can can live a fairly holy life but you're just going to be grumpy all the time you're going to be grumpy Saints because you're working yourself to death trying to do all of that and and it makes you tired and it makes you grumpy don't tell me cuz sometimes people around the message can be mean they get grumpy they get mean they because they're tired cuz they trying to live a life and they wore out trying to do it but Jesus J wants us to cease from our works and enter into the rest is that what he said Saints he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I'm meek and lowly and heart and you'll find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light Saints when I give my heart to the Lord it was easy when I tried to quit doing stuff on my own I couldn't do it but when I gave myself myself to the Lord he took it from me and when he fixes it it stays fixed you can't live by laws without a regeneration of the baptism of love because all these laws are hinging on the love of God so when you see worldliness or lack of Holiness in a in a church or in an individual it's not because the people are unbelievers or they're bad people it's they just have to be filled with the mainspring now Jesus said that this mainspring would lead and guide you in all truth John 16:12 he said I got many things yet to say unto you but you can't bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you in all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come now I know this is talking about the Holy Ghost Saints is this talking about the Holy Ghost but my goodness that sounds like what brother brandham did he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you and all these things that the father hath are mine therefore I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and you shall not see me again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father so it takes an infilling of the Holy Ghost to see God it takes an infilling of the Holy Ghost to to understand this word to understand true righteousness to understand what Holiness is and what it looks like and how to attain it it takes makes an in feeling of the Holy Ghost it's God's love placed inside of each and every one of us and all of a sudden things start to come together for you things you didn't understand in the word will start to come together things you didn't understand in your home will start to come together now I don't preach the Holy Ghost like it's a get out of jail free card and you get the Holy Ghost and all of a sudden you're never tempted and all of a sudden you're never tested and all of a sudden you never got a trial again I don't preach it like that Saints cuz that's not the world that we live live in if that's the case why did brother brandom have a a cross hanging in his car window but I do believe that the Holy Ghost inside of you when something happens that you did that you know you shouldn't do the first thing on your mind is repentance it's a it's a control tower that says oh you shouldn't have did that oh you shouldn't have did that oh you need to go over here or you need to go over there or you need to do this or you need to do that it'll guide you and Lead You In Truth and in righteousness and when you make a mistake it'll convict you thank God it'll convict you I want to be convicted I want to be told when I'm doing wrong because I want to be right is that right and you can't say you believe the word you can't say you believe the message and not have this love in your heart the love for God and the love for God's people you can say it but You' be lying because it takes the love of God and if you love God you love his people now this message is hanging on our love to him amen when a man and a woman are courting or whatever they call it now when they're dating or going together or talking or whatever it is the girls used to come home and tell me I say what about this boy you're dating and they say oh we're not dating Dad we're just talking well it looked like dating to me but apparently there's a distinction pastor and I said well what's going to change in the relationship with when you stop talking and start dating I mean we in the message right pastor preached on that this morning ain't too much going to change but talking is about all you're gonna be doing but when they're date and when you're talking when you when you when you're talking before this your significant other it's it's a h huge investment in time and in energy and and and in your in your bandwidth of your brain it's it's a huge investment sometimes it's a big investment in money too and then and it's always in the Forefront of your mind it's always a primary thought when you're talking to somebody when you're dating somebody and and and and so it it's something that that both people both parties are are they're going to do all they can all they can do to put their best foot forward to present themsel in the best light possible you know he he ain't gonna he ain't G he's gonna keep his hair cut and he's gonna keep shaved up and and he's going to keep a shower going he ain't going to stink everybody's going to smell good he'll go to the gym he'll work out he wants that belly not to get too big she's going to have her hair fixed right her clothes are going to be just right she ain't going to show up looking like she been shot out of a cannon because you're going to put a lot of energy a lot of effort into that trying to build a relationship word to the wise if they ain't willing to do it when you're talking it ain't going to get better once you get married to them cuz you getting the best they got right there and if the best they got's pretty bad cut them loose oh my here we go all right but there's a lot of investment in that he they'll spend a lot of time communicating with one another asking questions sisters he'll even listen to what you're saying because you're trying to develop a relationship you're trying to grow a relationship and you'll do whatever you can to build upon that relationship and and and then after the marriage after the wedding life begins to happen you know it's a amazing to me when people get a divorce in the world as soon as they start to go through that divorce they'll start to lose weight start going to the gym start getting their clothes fixed and start to look nice they'll start to invest a lot of energy in taking care of them if they' put that energy in on the front side there might not be a divorce but when you start going through the trials of life oh I'm telling you living in this world is a trial Saints and and and and and if you start going through those things and you start going through issues at the job and issues at work and issues at the home and when the kids come along that's a stress isn't it I mean y'all's kids not my kids my my kids was perfect but it's a stress raising kids it's a stress having all that stuff dirty around the house they touch everything they don't leave stuff alone they go into your office and mess around brother Israel it's a stress it's a stress on a young man when finally one day he wakes up and realizes he's going to get up and go to work every day for the rest of his life it's a stress hit me like a ton of bricks one day because when you're young you know and you're growing you're looking forward to stuff I'm going to get my driver's license or I'm going to graduate higho school or I'm going to become an adult or or I'm going to graduate college or I'm going to find somebody to marry and and then one day you do all of that and all that's left is to get up go to work every day whether you feel like it or not oh it's stressful is that right it's stressful to run a home sisters it's stressful stressful to raise children it's stressful to be wore out ladies and still have a mountain of clothes to wash or a bunch of dishes to do it's stressful it's stressful to find the will of the Lord for your life it's stressful to do those things and and it's stressful to to belong to a church I mean not this church I'm talking about all the other churches represented here some of the best training you ever get is dealing with issues in the church you say well I want to all to stay home where you wouldn't get this training at home you got to come here to get it you got to look at somebody you don't want to look at and say God said I got to love you some of the best lessons in life you get in church and some of the best lessons is when things ain't going right and if you're not careful you let those trials and tests take your eye and your mind off of the original relationship and Things become common and you get into a mode where you're just getting by you're getting up every day and you're just getting by every week you're just getting by every month you're just getting by and we can start to let things slip and it's the same way with the Lord you know when you first give your heart to the Lord Ain't nobody got tell you come to church when the oh God when the scales first fall off your eyes Saints when you wake up one day and you realize that you're in the pig pin and you've been living off corn husk and you realize there's a better way that your father has got servants that's living better than you are and the scales fall off your eyes and you realize I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and he rolls out the red carpet and welcomes you back and puts a fatted calf out he puts a ring on your finger he puts a robe on you and he takes care of you Saints nobody's got to talk you into coming to church then Ain't nobody got to talk you into worshiping the Lord then nobody got to talk you into praying Ain't nobody got to talk you into hearing the tape ain't nobody talk you into coming because you're working on the relationship you're willing to do whatever it takes to build on that relationship you you make every efforts oh can I get can I get 15 minutes to talk to him can I get 20 minutes to talk to him can I have 15 minutes somewhere to read my Bible can I have a can I have 30 minutes to hear a tape oh it's Wednesday night I got to go but then the trials of Life Hit the the battles come brother Bram said stand in the Gap he said I've been preaching for years and I've become an old man an old veteran preacher had a lot of hard battles come on somebody tonight had a lot of hard battles come on somebody tonight had some battles and maybe I'm all scarred all cut up on the inside from fights because my life that the lord gave me was not back to kiss the babies and to marry the young and bury the old but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the Battlefront against the Ws of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and to fight it with the word of God till I seen the enemy defeated he said I've been cut deep many times and Saints you've been called to this same gospel tonight oh you might not be a prophet oh but you've been called to hold a two-handed sword you've been called called to represent Jesus Christ to this church to this state to this country you've been called to it and there's going to be battles if you called to this way but thank God you're called thank God that he predestinated you to this thank God he put something in you that says I don't care what no reporter says I don't care what the world says I don't care what Google says I want to know what he says thank God it's in there and if you believe that there's going to be fights David was a warrior and he's the one that said restore unto me the joy of my salvation all those battles brother Tim all those fights all those Hard Times all those long nights all those sleepless nights amen all of those battles they wore him out and he said Lord restore unto me the joy Lord let me feel like I felt that day when you come into my life let me feel like it was the day I first was converted but Saints the fire is still there the fire is still there we just need to refocus we need to put some effort back into the relationship Naturally Speaking Saints there's nothing more important to me than my family there's nothing more important to me than my children if you mess with them children you're messing with me cuz they're my babies come on sisters they're my babies right or wrong if they're smart or dumb they're my babies if they're doing right if they're doing wrong they're still my babies they'll always be my babies and I'll always love them now what are you to God today what do you mean to him I think he's proved by his actions what you mean to him amen now many times we feel distance from the Lord but when we peel back the layers of the onion so to speak when we we peel it back you can see things are a lot simpler than we think they are oh I feel distant from the Lord I don't feel close to the Lord right now well how's your prayer life when's the last time you talk to him if you went a month and didn't talk to your wife you'd be distant from her wouldn't you well if you don't talk to him you feel distant from him if you don't have a relationship with him how's your how's your time listening to tapes how much time have you dispense consuming the word of God sometimes it ain't hard sometimes it's real easy if you're not praying and you're not listening to the message and and and you're not reading your Bible it's easy to feel distant brother Brown said God keeps his word he said read the word read the word he said some of you don't read once a week he said you ought to read chapter after chapter every day he said meditate if you if you'd get your head out of them old magazines and things you're reading out of this old so many papers and so-called religious literature that ought not never be on the market he said that's that's just as bad as reading some of the other magazines stuff that's false Doctrine and all kinds of dogma and bi and it's basing it upon the truth now Saints I don't read a lot of magazines but but man is Pham news articles and social media and all kinds of other I'm not saying it's sinful I'm not saying it's wrong but but but Saints it's not the main thing the mainspring is the main thing amen and I don't say that you you sure you can't ever look at stuff like that but you can't do it instead of looking at the word the words got to come first you can't look at the news until you've read the good news oh come on somebody tonight Church attendance how's that going he said if you don't have a church you must identification go ahead and put it up there yeah if you don't have a church you must is that what a prophet said he said see you'll die spiritually you'll just dwindle away I didn't say that a prophet said it if you don't have a church you must you'll die spiritually now when was the last time when was the last time that we read our Bible when we prayed last time we was at church when was the last Holy Ghost outpouring we were in oh let me tell you something Saints don't let nobody shame you for wanting to be in a holy ghost service don't let nobody try to talk you into that being bad I'm G Saints I know it's the word I know it's based on the word it takes the spirit to Quicken the word oh it ain't nothing wrong you feel yourself getting starchy and you feel yourself getting wound down you got to get in a holy ghost meeting somewhere now you say oh brother GE I I don't believe that I don't want to be manufacturing nothing say I I don't want to I don't want to be doing that you know people will sit there grumpy and grouchy and saying if God wants me to say Amen he'll come on me and make me do it well he ain't never going to if he wants me to shout he'll come tell me to do it if he wants me to run the aisles he'll make me do it well he ain't coming like that Saints you'll never do it there is nothing wrong with wanting to see the spirit of God move I long to see the spirit of God move I crave it Saints I want to be in that atmosphere an atmosphere where children can be born where Sinners can be saved where the righteous can be refilled where the spirit of God can move throughout the building I've been helped by it I've been healed by it I've been touched by it I've been delivered by it I crave it I want to be around it how can you be a Christian and not long to be in the presence of almighty God oh I don't like it when things get out of hand I want things to get out of hand get them out of hand long enough to get somebody saved he said holy ghost outpour what about the last time we had some good codly Godly Christian Fellowship Saints it's important that we have fellowship with one another there's a lot of Christians that spend more time with the world than they spend with other Christians you you need Godly Fellowship you need to be around brothers and sisters you need it the Bible said so much more as the day approaching we need it Saints I need to be around my brothers and sisters you need to be now you might say you don't but that's a lie because the message says you do identified Masterpiece of God he said I think it's when we can get together with this type of Fellowship it does something to us what's it do that draws us closer to each other and as we get closer to each other we also get closer to God for Jesus said in so much as youve done to the least of these my little ones you've done it unto me remember the everything's hinging on two rules love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and love thy Brother Love Thy Neighbor you know the best way to increase your appetite now I never had no problem with this but I got a girl Emma I don't want to call her out but if y'all was wondering which one it was it's Emma that from the time she was little bitty on up I'd have to make her eat eat she didn't want to eat and I say Emma eat and she start eating well now you know she's all big and stuff she don't have to listen to me and she'll go and she won't eat and so I told her she was like I'm just not hungry for I said you got to eat some breakfast when you get up you got to get some protein in you and you got to have some breakfast breakfast and she's said well I'm just not hungry I said eat anyways you know the best way to increase your appetite is to eat I'm not hungry well eat anyways I I don't feel like it or eat anyways and she started doing that and then the next thing I know she says I got to eat soon as I get up in the morning CU When I get up I'm starving to death now because the best way to increase your appe it is to eat more do you know the best way to increase your appetite for God's word is to eat more of it oh God Saints if you'll start listening you want to keep listening you might not feel like it oh I don't want to listen this morning well just listen to 30 minutes of it and then the next morning listen to 30 more and then pretty soon you'll be like Oh I'm going to go an hour and then pretty soon you'll be like I got to hear the word this morning or read a chapter make yourself do it make yourself do it the next day make yourself do it the next day and pretty soon you get up you say I feel hollow I hadn't read the word yet oh come to church and the more you come the more you want to come the best way to increase your appetite is to eat more come on somebody today now brother Jason Watkins mentioned a study brother Israel mentioned it here a few weeks ago and this study I went and looked it up and read through it it's very interesting and it was studied by the center of Bible engagement and it studied 40,000 people ages 8 to 80 so pretty broad spectrum 8 to 80 and it and it and it and it and looked at how they were engaging in the scripture and they compiled their research findings and the study indicated that when people engaged in the scripture one time a week which could include the pastor instructing them to open their Bibles there was negligible effect on their life so when they engaged when they open the Bible once a week there was no effect on their life now this is just a world this is just a secular study when they open the Bible twice a week there was no effect on their life when they opened up the Bible three times a week there was very little almost no effect on their life but when they got to four times a week or more the the effects were incredible incredible now you would think one time a week here and then twice a week a little bit more and three times a week a little bit more but that ain't what it was there was almost no effect until it got to four times a week or more and when they reached that level the effects spiked in an astounding way when they got to four times a week feelings of loneliness Dr dropped by 30% anger issues come on somebody dropped by 32% so if you're feeling lonely or you're feeling mad give it four or five times a week see what happens bitterness in relationships dropped 40% I know we ain't got no bitterness in this church I'm just maybe this will help somebody else alcoholism dropped 57% sex outside of marriage dropped 68% feeling spiritually stagnant dropped 60% oh I just don't feel like I'm growing I don't feel like I'm getting better I don't I don't feel like the Lord's dealing with me like he should well open your Bible four times a week or more and 60% % of the time viewing pornography dropped 61% sharing your faith jumped 200% discipling others helping another one along jumped 230% now it looks like it would have went in in an order but what they found was is that the people that looked at the Bible once or twice a week felt as though they were looking at the Bible four or five times a week and they felt like that no effect was good effect and they they didn't realize that they they thought they were being good Christians but in actuality their their lives were no different than people who weren't Christians at all and so limited activity in in your in your brain your brain will mess with you your brain will play tricks on you limited activity in their in their minds was elevated to the same effect as consistent activity when actually the same it was the same as no activity so I read an article one time on working out and it said that if you can it's studied people and it it found that when people just thought about working out they felt better better about yourself when they just thought about working out they eat more calories than because just the thought of working out made them feel good enough they felt like they should get a reward so why four days a week I don't know I don't know but I wonder if it's not this you can go to church you can go to church and and the pastor can tell you to open the Bible now now most churches have two or three services a week so you could go to church and open your Bible three times a week but in order for you to open four times or more you would have to make a conscious decision to do it yourself now brother Ram says this rejected King he said they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody that will tell them just how to do it and all about it now is that what the prophet said they want somebody to do it for them they want somebody to tell them what scripture tell them what message to listen to tell them what what Bible scripture to read they want somebody to make them do it but Saints it doesn't work that way you have to make the decision you have to decide for yourself this is my house and we're going to read the Bible in it this is my house and we're going to hear the prophet in it this is my I'm going to listen to the T Ain't nobody got to make me do it I'm going to do it nobody's got to tell me to do it nobody's got to tell me to read my Bible I'm going to read the Bible cuz I'm a Christian that's who I am that's what I do seek out the Bible says your own salvation with fear and trembling amen unveiling reality is the Living God he said they want to live just like they want to live and they want to continue right on living the way they always live but yet be very religious and go to church and be a member thereof and get they can go on Sunday morning or whatever time it is and have a 15minute sermon from the pastor that will walk with them away from there kind of halfway satisfied that they've done their religion for the week that settles it and go back to doing anything they want to do the rest of the week Saints this ain't something we do on Sunday this is something we do every day it's something we live every day it's something that consumes our life it's the mainspring in our heart the mainspring in our church now so they examined the LifeWay Research Institute study found that the biggest factor for predicting the spiritual health of young adults ages 13 to 17 the biggest factor in their health was their engagement when the scripture the biggest factor for predicting the spiritual health of young adults is whether they read the Bible regularly as kids now Saints this this is just secular this sit in this is just I'll tell you everything has to has to confess this word now the other list of spiritual health indicators you want to you want to hear what they are it said that the number one was a child regularly read the Bible while growing up so we want to help our young people we want our young people to do well we want to see our young people filled with the Holy Ghost and serving the lord we want to see that don't we come on somebody say Amen if you want to see it we want to see our young people doing well the number one indicator was the child regularly read the Bible while growing up number two was the child regular spent time in prayer while growing up number three was the child regularly served in church while growing up number four was the child listened primarily to Christian music while growing up so this is all the message he said you got to have a church you wither away and die he said if you don't have the Holy Ghost that rock and roll music will get them number five was the child participated in church mission trips or other projects number six was the child's best friend was an influence on them to follow Christ you want your kids to be Godly get them around Godly kids number seven spiritual indicator was a childish female you sisters got a hand up on us number eight was the child connected with several adults at the church who intentionally invested in them see it ain't just the parents job it's everybody in this Church's job to find find a kid and invest in them number nine was the parent typically asked for forgiveness when they messed up we don't like doing that in the message number 11 for some reason another was each additional sibling was a spirit ual positive indicator so brother Joe keep on going buddy the more kids you got the better indicator it is negative indicators was the child did not want to go to church as a teen the child was rebellious growing up number three was the child listened primarily to secular popular music and number four was the drop in level of family church service attendance while growing up we're all negative indicators on a child spiritual well-being brothers and sisters we're Christians tonight this is what we do and nothing's more important than this he says why uh and what is why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live a Christian Life he says and they watch and that watch spring makes all the rest of the movement M just tick just exactly to place keeping perfect time when the Holy Spirit is in the middle of your spirit it makes every action of the Holy Spirit In You tick off just exactly according to God's time piece the Bible he says you don't lie you don't steal you got Associates and you're lovely and you got peace Joy longsuffering goodness meekness patience while all the fruits of the spirit just ticks right with that mainspring you see what I mean now it's it's the mainspring that does it it's the holy spirit that does it it's your church that does it it's it isn't your it isn't your church that it's the holy spirit that does it it isn't your church that does it it isn't your pastor that does it it isn't your shouting that does it it isn't your speaking in tongues that does it it isn't your healing service that does it it's the holy spirit that does it God's holy spirit in the middle of your new spirit it makes the whole church operate just exactly one big bun of love now just closing just just for can I have five more minutes can I have five preacher minutes just enclosing the Commandment was to love the Lord with all your heart soul mind and strength now he didn't say that for no reason see we're a triun being Soul Bo spirit and body and he said our body it's it's contacted by SE taste feel smell in here and that spirit is contacted by conscience memory reasons affections and imaginations and then he said there's a soul in there that that only is controlled by faith or doubt and Jesus commanded us to love him with every one of those faculties heart soul mind mind and strength thinking man's filter he said and that shows that in you was that predestinated seed down in you that makes you hunger for God so you're blessed just to hunger for him tonight you're blessed just to have a desire that you want more of him and he says all the father has given me uh all the father has given me has given me to redeem they die with me at Calvary they raised with me in the resurrection and all that he has given me will come to me and they'll be placed in the body where foot arm nose mouth whatever it is they'll be placed in there see see God expects all of his members to be profitable and all the members of our body are expected to be profitable also he says and they will come to me in their Seasons oh my that is that there is that real filtration of all the sin of the world and the love of the world is dead and this soul is drawing only one thing here it is do don't remember don't forget it so what a prophet says remember don't forget it all all you out there on the telephones settle this down in your mind when a thinking man begins to think who he's going to stand before and what the word of God is when he begins to think then when he draws through that there's nothing can get to it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning standing here drawing the seed life the seed is in Your Heart by foration Hallelujah the seed is already in there by for knowledge of God predestinated and when it draws it can't draw through nothing else but the word and then it's the taste of a thinking man the righteous man the holy man who sees the Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what comes into that place down there it that word that's in the heart I've hid th th word in my heart that I sin not against thee what is it when it's drawn through the word there's only one thing will pass through the word that's the Holy Ghost and there's only one thing that can pass through that word it's the Holy Ghost and a thinking man's filter gives a holy man's taste so we take all these circles and we draw them three circles brother BR said and and and all of these circles we have to draw them through the word by the holy spirit is that right so so if your conscience doesn't pull through that filter or if your if your eyes can't pull through that filter or if your tongue can't pull through that filter or if your ears can't pull through that filter we got to make that right don't we now we we got we got contacts to our Earthly home see taste feel smelling here Saints we got a ser God in every one of those faculties we got to we got to use these hands to serve the Lord with see sometimes we want to serve god with our hearts but we don't want to give him our eyes or we don't want to give him our ears or we don't want to give him our mouth come on somebody tonight oh my God some we want to serve the Lord with our heart or maybe we want to serve him in our mind but our eyes are looking at things they don't need to look at or our ears are listening to things they don't need to listen to but he wants those too he can't you got to pull those through that thinking man's filter also you got to pull your eyes through it are my eyes looking at the word are they looking at the promise are they looking at the things they need to look at or they looking at things that's that's not according to the word you can have your heart but not have your eyes you can have are your ears listening to the kind of music they don't need to listen to is your mouth saying the things it don't need to say or is it praising God it's made to praise the Lord with he gave us this mouth to praise the Lord with is it saying amen or is it gossiping we got to pull the mouth through that thinking man's filter our eyes through that thinking man's filter our ears through that thinking man's filter you hear all kind of stuff amen if you don't know it don't pull it through your ears if you don't know for sure let it go but he gave us these ears to hear the word with he gave us this mouth to preach the word we got to pull it through the thinking man's filter we got to listen to the right things we got to let him have our heart not just our mind we got to let him have our conversation we got to let him have all these things Philippians 68 says Brethren whosoever whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things give them your mind think on the things of God don't think about all this worldly stuff we spend all that time you can you can change what you think about Saints you can choose to think on the things of God you can't you can't pull these worldly thoughts through a thinking man's filter is that right Saints giving you reasoning and if you're reasoning he said come let us reason together God gave us ability to reason so that we could reason out this word come let us reason together but if our reason is contrary to this word you can't pull that through a thinking man's filter if we could just take one example of imagination that's one of the contacts to their Spirit you got to serve god with that also that imagination was given to us to serve the Lord with but those imaginations bring a man down now Romans 1:21 says because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became V vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened now that word vain means foolish morally Wicked or idolatrous now the word imagination comes from the word damos which is also the same word as dialogue comes from and it's an internal discussion with oneself your imagination is an internal discussion with yourself it's internal consideration or reasonings so we see that a person can become idolatrous in their imaginations in their ideas brother Paul read the quote on that that we can allow our ideas to become Idols to us now the Bible ask the question why do the Heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing see God gives us this imagination as a means of establishing hope not not hope like a verb brother BR said Hope was the greatest enemy Faith ever had not not hope like I hope God can heal me no no no not not not hope like I hope I'm going to be saved or I hope I'm going to be delivered no that's that's an enemy to Faith but hope like a noun like like the like like my hope is in the Lord the I the hope of our calling it's it's a physical thing it's a tangible thing hope is real saints Hebrews 6 Paul was speaking of the promises that God made to Abraham and and he said God could not lie and that God's promises were certain that's what Paul said in Hebrews 6 and then he makes this statement which hope we have as an anchor to the soul Paul said that those promises and the fact that he made those promises and the fact that he couldn't lie and the fact that he couldn't change would it built in us a hope so by loving the Lord through our imaginations we can have hope now you say what are you talking about brother George well it's like this Saints I don't know for a fact what it looks like beyond the curtain of time but given the information that I have my imagination gives me hope I don't know for sure what that Holy City looks like but I can imagine what it looks like and that gives me hope I I I don't know for sure what it's going to be like when I'm reunited with my loved ones one one day but I can imagine what it's going to be like and that gives me hope God wants us to serve him with every part of our being as the musicians come sister Sharon you were playing there's none like you this morning can we just play that remember the Rich Young Ruler he served the Lord mostly he he kept the word of God mostly he was raised a good boy mostly but he was lacking one little bit he was lacking one little thing there was one little part of his life that he wasn't willing to surrender but the Lord instructed us to serve him with all of our heart all of our soul all of our mind and all of our strength he let a little part of his life become an idol to him you say an idol brother George an idol would be anything that you would put ahead of the Lord he let a little part of his life become an idol to him he he wasn't willing he he was willing to do it mostly but he wasn't willing to give God everything the money meant more to him than eternal life did Saints we got to be willing to put it all on the table today shall we bow our heads and just with our heads bow Jesus is worth more than we're afraid of loseing Jesus is worth more than we're afraid of Letting Go no matter what it [Music] is eternal life is worth it [Music] all and maybe we all been struggling as we search Our Lives tonight we think about these things maybe we serve the Lord with our heart but maybe we hadn't given him our eyes maybe we haven't given him our ears maybe we've allowed the devil to use those ears maybe we've been vain in our imagination dreaming of building our own kingdom maybe we've let our memory betray us kept us from forgiving kept us from letting go of something kept us in a root of bitterness maybe our hands have been idle we haven't been using them to serve him whatever it is tonight tonight we want to go all the way tonight we want to serve God with all of our hearts all of our soul all of our mind all of our strength all that's in us we want to give him all that we can it's too late an hour to give

we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separate herself from the things of the world all of our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all the dead religions I'm speaking Across the Nation and all the dead Creeds until what separated us and opened us a new land a new message for this day Pentecost dried up and died like Luther Wesley and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together good people in there yet it's got to be come out what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message did you notice that the Seven Seals which all the mysteries of the seven church agels are seal with Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their days they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the Seven Seals it's open to to us in this last days from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona how I ask God why you doing me out here in this desert did you know Moses wrote the New Testament or the Old Testament he certainly did first four books gives the laws and everything Genesis Exodus Leviticus and deom he wrote the Old Testament to do that he had to leave all of his associates and loved ones and go into a desert Paul wrote the New Testament that's right he wrote Romans Romans and all the rest of there HEB and Timothy and so forth and to do that he had to separate from himself and go down into Arabia into a desert for 3 years get the revelation of God all you say about Matthew Mark Luke and John they were scribes that just wrote what Jesus did Paul separated and put the word together that's right well then look if it taken that and they had to go to a desert away their loved ones remember what what time is it sir how many you ever heard it say Amen was it exactly right then we've got the Revelation in this last days or the message of the Lord God together his bride together no other age has it been promised it's promised in this age Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 St John 14:12 Joel 238 those promises are justed exactly like John the Baptist identified himself in the scripture Jesus identified himself what they say way was such a person John's a wild man the church wasn't able to receive it that's the pattern neither will the church receive it to days but to the elected God's calling Hallelujah to the elected they know it amen calling The Virtuous bride the word the last day Church the elected Lady of our Lord Jesus Christ word if Jesus is the word how many believe that all right then the bride is always part of the bridegroom so the bride will not be a denomination it will have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ he promised to do it he said how he never uses loses his pattern he always did it by the pattern he's done it every time by the pattern he does it again calling out his virtuous bride in the last days the lovely Rebecca waiting for her ISAC what a beautiful time here it brings into view the two books that's going to be Myst it's Thanksgiving
