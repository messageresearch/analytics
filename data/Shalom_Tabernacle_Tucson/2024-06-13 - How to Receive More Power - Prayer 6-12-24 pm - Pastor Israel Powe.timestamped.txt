[28:25] country here we thank the Lord for them
[28:27] I look forward to meeting them so God
[28:30] bless them we welcome you to the house
[28:32] of the Lord here tonight yeah we can
[28:34] give the Lord a hand of praise for them
[28:36] amen
[28:39] amen I have a portion in the scripture
[28:41] I'd like to turn to in Acts chapter
[28:46] 1 and Sunday morning we spoke on how to
[28:50] receive more power and I want to
[28:53] continue just a little bit into that
[28:56] message here tonight how to receive more
[28:59] power and I'm going to focus in on the
[29:01] prayer because this is a prayer
[29:04] meeting and I'm just trusting the Lord
[29:08] to be a blessing to
[29:11] you Acts chapter
[29:14] 1 verse number
[29:17] eight but you ye shall receive power
[29:22] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[29:25] you and ye shall be Witnesses un to me
[29:29] both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in
[29:33] Samaria and into the uttermost parts of
[29:36] the Earth take one more scripture found
[29:40] in James chapter 4
[30:18] yes in verse number
[30:22] three take verse number two
[30:25] sorry you lust and have not you kill and
[30:30] desire to have and cannot obtain you
[30:33] fight and War yet you have not because
[30:37] you ask not you ask and receive not
[30:42] because you ask aiss that ye may consume
[30:45] it upon your
[30:48] lust ye adulterers adulteresses know ye
[30:52] that the Friendship of the world is
[30:54] enmity with God whosoever therefore will
[30:57] be a friend of the world is the enemy of
[31:01] God Amen thank God for the reading of
[31:04] his
[31:05] word um God bless you you may be seated
[31:08] amen praise the Lord so in this
[31:13] message we took on Sunday morning that
[31:17] scripture in Acts and then I believe we
[31:21] got
[31:23] into uh the message that brother bandam
[31:26] entitles the countdown
[31:29] and he started to bring out in science
[31:33] how in science they have achieved great
[31:37] things and that those scientific
[31:40] achievement actually are related to our
[31:43] spiritual walk and their spiritual
[31:45] achievement as well because the man is
[31:48] made up of
[31:50] Body Spirit and soul that's what makes
[31:53] up a man and no matter how much anointed
[31:56] you are with the Holy Ghost that
[31:58] anointing has to fall upon your body and
[32:02] this is how the word of the Lord comes
[32:05] it starts out by reading it's carnal it
[32:09] seems outwardly but that's for the
[32:12] purpose that it reaches down into your
[32:14] soul and that's where the anointing
[32:16] takes place that's where Revelation
[32:19] happens and so um they're definitely
[32:23] related and I like the way brother
[32:24] brandham brings it in the message there
[32:27] to countdown and he says this in
[32:29] paragraph number 35 he says let's take
[32:32] for one let's take for One
[32:35] Transportation first the transportation
[32:39] was by horse next it was by
[32:42] automobile then science built us an
[32:45] airplane but you see it is first was a
[32:50] horsepower the car was made 20
[32:53] horsepower the airplane goes up to
[32:56] hundreds of horsepower see what it is
[32:59] just as we come on with the horse then
[33:03] an automobile was made then the next
[33:06] thing was an airplane we just keep
[33:08] achieving on higher and higher going
[33:11] greater and greater this is the
[33:14] achievement of science this is a
[33:18] forerunner of the spiritual things
[33:21] that's happened of God by his Spirit has
[33:26] been in his promised word so brother vom
[33:29] is now taking the achievement of a man
[33:32] which we're all men and women here today
[33:35] and those great tremendous achievements
[33:37] that they have achieved the 20th century
[33:40] the 21st century and there's just been
[33:43] an advancement in their um findings it
[33:47] just keeps accelerating it's like it
[33:50] it's moving faster than it ever has been
[33:54] and he types that to spiritual things so
[33:57] so if the
[33:59] scientists have
[34:01] increased year after year even month
[34:05] after month even every time you get a
[34:09] new phone there's updates they update
[34:12] that version that you have and it's a
[34:14] constant moving upward What About Us in
[34:17] the spirit where where should we be and
[34:21] I gave the example and I mentioned him
[34:23] just a little bit this gentleman Elon
[34:25] Musk we all know of him he's a little
[34:28] out there got his own opinion Beats by
[34:31] his own drum beat people say he couldn't
[34:34] do this and they criticizing for this
[34:36] and that do you think he's worried about
[34:39] what other scientists are telling him he
[34:41] can't do no no they can hate they can
[34:46] just you know discredit him and say what
[34:49] his motives are and so forth he's still
[34:51] doing his thing and he'll probably
[34:54] continue doing his thing as long as he's
[34:56] here on Earth
[34:58] that's his that's his mind that's his
[35:01] achievement that's what he is that's
[35:04] what he does and so what about us the
[35:06] True Believer
[35:08] now in the prayer and because this is a
[35:11] prayer meeting and I I I don't want to
[35:14] hold you too long I think that as we
[35:17] take James chapter 4 just a little bit
[35:21] we'll see
[35:22] that um you don't have because you don't
[35:26] ask
[35:29] and then brother random ask adds he says
[35:32] you have not because you ask not you ask
[35:37] not because you believe not brother vam
[35:40] adds that in there he says it many many
[35:43] times you ask not because you believe
[35:46] not but look at this prayer in James
[35:49] chapter 4 and I think many times we
[35:52] might
[35:53] misapply prayer because we know that no
[35:57] matter where you are or what you're
[35:59] doing or you're standing prostrate hands
[36:02] raised on your knees whatever it's
[36:06] always appropriate to pray you're never
[36:09] out of order when you're in prayer you
[36:12] can pray while you're having a
[36:13] conversation with someone you can pray
[36:16] like you could be praying right now you
[36:18] can go down on your knees and pray you
[36:19] can pray prostrate you can pray with
[36:21] your hands up pray standing pray
[36:23] kneeling it's always appropriate can I
[36:27] get a witness there is no you pray too
[36:30] much now you could preach too much talk
[36:32] too much laugh too much sing too much
[36:36] eat too much we could do a lot of things
[36:40] too much but prayer is one of those
[36:43] things you can't do too much of and so
[36:45] what I think because we know we can't
[36:51] pray as far as time goes we can pray at
[36:54] any time I think we might misunderstand
[36:58] that we can pray wrong though there is a
[37:02] wrong way to
[37:04] pray and because we know that it's
[37:07] always appropriate it's can happen at
[37:10] any time we might not understand that
[37:13] there is a prayer that is
[37:16] incorrect and James deals with it in
[37:19] James chapter 4 if we'll go back to it
[37:21] just for a moment
[37:31] can't find James tonight for some
[37:35] reason and it says
[37:38] here you have not because you ask not
[37:43] you ask and receive not because you ask
[37:48] a Miss now that word a Miss is used in
[37:50] many places throughout the Bible the
[37:52] Greek word there and it's it's used for
[37:56] a sickness it's it's used for uh it's
[38:00] wrong you ask wrong and many of the
[38:03] people that come to Jesus to be healed
[38:05] they use this word they were aiss they
[38:08] were sick so our prayers can be you know
[38:13] the one interpretation is it it's sick
[38:15] it's not a healthy prayer and why is
[38:18] that that you may consume it upon your
[38:23] lust so you're you're praying for
[38:27] something
[38:28] so it can advance you versus advancing
[38:33] God's perfect will in your life so we
[38:36] shouldn't be you know I'm praying for
[38:38] this position on my job so that I can
[38:42] make more money or I can live in a
[38:45] bigger house or but that I you know you
[38:48] know that's that can be that can be
[38:50] misguided that can be misguided he says
[38:53] that you pray and you're not getting
[38:55] what you ask for because your prayer is
[38:59] prayed with the wrong
[39:02] motive and I think that our prayer we
[39:05] really should internalize what we doing
[39:08] when we pray prayer prayer is an act
[39:11] adjective prayer is not something that
[39:14] or it's a verb it's not something that
[39:16] you just you know you're just thinking
[39:18] about the next day's task or the
[39:21] conversations of the Day prayer is
[39:24] getting in the channel of the spirit so
[39:27] the Holy Spirit can get a hold of you
[39:30] and pray things that you normally
[39:32] wouldn't pray for prayer isn't about you
[39:36] getting more money so you can have this
[39:38] that and the other sometimes we want the
[39:41] power of God in our life for the wrong
[39:43] reason I'm going to show you that in the
[39:45] scripture here in just in a moment and
[39:47] so you know what's your motive and what
[39:50] you're praying for Lord I need this or I
[39:53] want this and you're not getting it your
[39:55] prayers are not being heard because you
[39:58] pray
[39:59] aiss
[40:01] now the other reason why we're not
[40:03] getting what we asked for
[40:05] because we don't
[40:09] ask you said brother Israel there's
[40:11] nobody from my job ever comes to church
[40:14] but how many people did you ask when was
[40:17] the last time shame on us now for a
[40:19] minute I'm G give you a shame moment
[40:21] when was the last time we invited
[40:24] someone to church from our neighborhood
[40:28] from our job from our class or whatever
[40:32] and you know if you don't ask that's
[40:34] probably a good reason why you wouldn't
[40:36] get it you say well brother Israel we
[40:39] got to keep it professional on our job
[40:41] you know we got to keep it professional
[40:42] I don't want to you know you know
[40:45] religion and and how much money people
[40:48] make and who you vote for those are kind
[40:50] of personal questions right George how
[40:53] much money you make n how much money you
[40:55] got in the bank like wa over this bro I
[40:58] love you but man you getting you know
[41:00] who' you vote for who would I vote for
[41:02] why you know this and getting out of
[41:04] personal and we made that personal
[41:07] because the world out there has made it
[41:10] personal about people's soul and if they
[41:13] come into church or not or where they go
[41:15] to church or is everything go right with
[41:17] you and the Lord we have something to
[41:20] offer them and you know a good portion
[41:23] of the reason why according to the
[41:25] scripture here we don't have have is
[41:28] because we don't
[41:30] ask you don't have it because you didn't
[41:34] ask for it now Elisha asked for a hard
[41:39] thing but the lord gave it to him didn't
[41:42] he and when Elisha asked for that how
[41:45] many people after that would have loved
[41:48] now to think of asking for something
[41:50] like that and you know uh this is how
[41:54] this this the you know th those those
[41:57] those um those desires come from
[42:00] somewhere you know he ask him what can I
[42:02] do for you today a double portion of
[42:05] your spirit that's what I want so the
[42:07] Lord granted that to him and so we know
[42:10] in the scripture here in Acts chapter 1
[42:13] verse eight that it's the holy ghost
[42:16] that comes upon us is where we receive
[42:20] the power and this power is the power to
[42:25] live a clean
[42:27] Christian Life we need this power in our
[42:31] life and this is not a one-time event
[42:34] that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and
[42:36] you receive power this can this is
[42:39] unlimited now it's up to you do you want
[42:42] more power have you asked for more power
[42:46] do you feel that you need more power
[42:49] this is a cry this is a prayer that is
[42:51] in my heart this is not a prayer where
[42:54] I'm asking other people is it okay to
[42:56] pray for this is a prayer that I'm
[42:59] asking for for myself personally I would
[43:02] love for everyone else to ask for that
[43:04] prayer I would love for everyone in the
[43:06] church to get the same burden same
[43:08] vision but if they don't I'm going to
[43:11] ask for myself Lord give me another
[43:16] portion of the power of God in my life
[43:21] so that the power of God
[43:24] increases in my life the way I I pray I
[43:27] want it more powerful the way I preach
[43:30] more powerful the way I believe the way
[43:32] I see the word more powerful and you
[43:36] have not because you ask not
[43:39] now this scripture in Acts chapter
[43:44] 8 deals with this uh gentleman Simon go
[43:49] there
[43:50] quickly he
[43:52] is very interesting character here how
[43:56] what God is
[43:57] done through this example in Acts
[44:00] chapter chapter 8 if you want to turn
[44:03] there uh well I'm going to ask you not
[44:06] to turn there just this one time this is
[44:08] one of the rare times I'm going tell you
[44:10] not to turn there in your Bible but if
[44:12] they can just pick up on the screen acts
[44:15] 8 and verse
[44:21] number is it
[44:24] 19 yes
[44:27] acts 8:19 thank you brother somebody
[44:29] following
[44:31] me look at this who says this saying
[44:35] give me also this power that whomsoever
[44:39] I lay hands he may receive the Holy
[44:41] Ghost powerful prayer when you say
[44:44] powerful
[44:46] request this is a man or a woman
[44:49] asking for the power of
[44:52] God so when I lay hands on somebody they
[44:57] received the Holy Ghost how could that
[44:58] be
[44:59] wrong how could that be
[45:03] wrong see what's wrong is his motive and
[45:06] his objective the prayer is right but
[45:09] his motive is wrong and this man had
[45:12] already been baptized he was a sorcerer
[45:15] he repented he got baptized he followed
[45:18] Phillip and he saw the moving of the
[45:21] Holy Ghost working upon the people and
[45:23] this is what his prayer was but now
[45:27] let's go a little bit further in the
[45:28] scripture there and look at how Peter
[45:30] handled him and he
[45:33] says verse he says give me all this also
[45:36] this power that whomsoever I lay hands
[45:38] he may receive the Holy Ghost but Peter
[45:41] said unto him thy money perish with thee
[45:45] because thou has thought that the gift
[45:48] of God may be purchased with
[45:51] money thou Hast neither part nor lot in
[45:54] this matter for your heart is not right
[45:57] in the sight of God repent therefore of
[46:00] this wickedness and pray God if perhaps
[46:05] thou the thought of thine heart may be
[46:07] forgiven thee for I perceive that thou
[46:09] are in a gall of bitterness and in the
[46:12] bond of iniquity then answered Simon and
[46:15] said pray ye that the Lord for me that
[46:18] none of these things which you spoken
[46:21] pray for me pray for me he he repented
[46:24] but you know he's asking for the power
[46:26] power of God to come on him so that
[46:29] whoever he lays hands on they too would
[46:32] receive the Holy Ghost but it's the
[46:35] wrong motive it's the wrong objective I
[46:38] wonder if this can be applied to
[46:42] Ministries today who study deeper
[46:46] subjects with the wrong motive in mind
[46:49] they want to be interesting they want to
[46:51] be they want to stand above the crowd
[46:54] they want to be better than the next
[46:56] fellow
[46:57] they want more they want they want their
[46:59] Church to grow not be so the kingdom of
[47:02] God can grow they want it to grow so we
[47:05] can say I have 300 people here now our
[47:08] church is bigger than it was last year
[47:11] the motive is not right is it good for a
[47:14] church to grow yes is it good for the
[47:16] Holy Ghost to follow somebody yes but if
[47:20] my motive is wrong it would be better
[47:24] that no power would come upon me and my
[47:27] heart will stay right before God Before
[47:31] He blesses me any
[47:34] further because you can get in trouble
[47:36] with these things you get lifted up you
[47:38] start thinking it's you doing the
[47:41] healing it's you that's doing it's you
[47:44] that's the anointing it's you your
[47:46] bigger it's happened to Greater men than
[47:49] you and I greater men than you and I so
[47:54] do we want the power of God in our life
[47:57] yes but not without the humility not
[48:00] without the love of God not without
[48:02] submitting oursel to every word of God
[48:06] amen amen so so Lord increase this power
[48:12] in my life but let it come with your
[48:15] grace and your mercy yes let my face
[48:20] remain in the
[48:22] dust of nothing and knowing where I come
[48:25] from Lord Keep Me in the
[48:30] humility that's
[48:32] required to be a true servant of the
[48:36] most high God because many times when
[48:39] God blesses a man or a woman most of the
[48:42] time it gets them off
[48:45] track it gets them they get Sidetrack
[48:48] they get a little better position they
[48:50] get a little bit more money they get
[48:53] more blessed and you see their attitude
[48:55] change I've seen it I've seen it someone
[48:58] working in their little Ministry or
[49:00] whatever it is and then they can play
[49:01] the piano kind of good and then they
[49:03] start learning to play better or the
[49:06] organ or song leading or preaching
[49:08] whatever it is and they start learning
[49:10] to get PR and then that little Spirit of
[49:12] pride gets in there have you seen that
[49:16] yes if you look in the mirror you might
[49:18] see it yes just as soon as the anointing
[49:22] comes as a blessing comes and you get
[49:25] raised up and you know it's oh yeah this
[49:27] is good this is a gift now and you start
[49:30] to recognize that you got to fall down
[49:32] on your
[49:35] knes if you ever needed a prayer meeting
[49:40] it's when God blesses you get back to
[49:43] the Altar and humble yourself when God
[49:48] shows you something humble yourself
[49:51] every time he blesses you fall down on
[49:54] your knees tell them thank you tell them
[49:58] I'm not worthy of it but give me more
[50:01] Lord absolutely that's the right
[50:03] attitude any other attitude you're out
[50:06] of here like I said greater men than you
[50:10] and
[50:12] I we've seen them
[50:14] fall I'm not even going in the Bible I'm
[50:18] not even go I'm not even going to go
[50:20] secular I'm going to look right in the
[50:22] Realms of our
[50:24] message you can look around in whatever
[50:26] country
[50:27] including this one as some of the big
[50:30] name
[50:31] Ministries who have
[50:34] grown preaching the message and after 10
[50:38] years 15 years something comes out of
[50:41] their camp and you're like what did that
[50:43] come
[50:43] from it's
[50:46] off it's off the
[50:49] word we've seen it we act like we a't
[50:52] seen we've seen it I've seen it with my
[50:54] eyes and you wonder how how could it be
[50:57] you started so humble you had nothing
[51:00] then your church grew then you have to
[51:01] buy a bigger church then a buy a bigger
[51:03] and then you and then people streaming
[51:05] and more people streaming and you start
[51:06] a second church and the third church and
[51:08] then before you know it they know more
[51:11] about it than the prophets I've seen it
[51:14] too many times amen so it would be
[51:16] foolish for us not to
[51:18] think that that is a tremendous Trav yes
[51:22] siren we want more power but for what
[51:26] what I want more power
[51:28] for I want more power so I can make the
[51:34] Rapture and the Rapture ain't coming
[51:36] with no Spirit of
[51:38] Pride thinking we're greater and
[51:41] better amen so let's take one more
[51:45] example it's in Acts chapter number
[51:50] 19 these Sons seven sons of ska
[51:59] verse number 11 and God wrought special
[52:01] Miracles by the hands of Paul so that
[52:05] from his body were
[52:07] brought so let's go back to Acts chapter
[52:10] 8 for a minute I don't want to miss this
[52:12] Acts chapter 8 so here Simon
[52:17] repents verse 24 then Simon answered and
[52:21] said pray ye to the Lord for me that
[52:24] none of these things which have spoke
[52:27] which ye have spoken come upon me and
[52:30] they when they had testified and
[52:33] preached the word of the Lord returned
[52:35] to Jerusalem and preached the gospel in
[52:38] many villages of
[52:41] Samaria so we
[52:44] see that the word of the Lord continues
[52:46] on and this man got the correction that
[52:49] he needed Acts chapter 19 quickly
[52:58] and God wrough special Miracles by the
[53:00] hand of Paul so that from his body were
[53:02] brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and
[53:05] aprons and diseases departed from them
[53:08] and evil spirits went out of them then
[53:11] certain of the babon Jews exorcists took
[53:15] upon them to call over them which had
[53:18] evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:23] saying we adure you by Jesus whom Paul
[53:28] preached and there were seven sons of
[53:31] ska of one ska a Jew a chief of the
[53:35] priests which did so and the evil spirit
[53:37] answered and said Jesus I know Paul I
[53:41] know but who are
[53:43] you and the man in whom the evil spirit
[53:47] was leaped on them and overcame them and
[53:51] prevailed against them so that they fled
[53:55] out of the house
[53:57] naked and wounded one translation says
[54:01] the man gave them a
[54:07] beating that one man put his hands on
[54:09] them all seven of them when he got done
[54:13] left him wounded beating and naked what
[54:18] were they trying to do so the power of
[54:21] God is above any other power all the
[54:25] other powers are underneath that power
[54:28] it's the power of the Holy Ghost it's
[54:30] got the power over demons Devils the
[54:33] Dark World and the dark things of the
[54:35] world and God gives you power over that
[54:39] but here these men now approach this
[54:43] demon this evil possessed man and wants
[54:46] to cast him out I wonder if they would
[54:49] have just left him alone the demon maybe
[54:51] would have just left him alone but they
[54:53] approach him wanting to cast this devil
[54:55] out of him by way of Paul and
[55:00] Jesus and this demon knew Jesus I wonder
[55:03] how he knew Jesus this demon knew Paul I
[55:06] wonder how it knew Paul yes knew them
[55:09] says I know Jesus and I know Paul but
[55:11] who are you and this demon attacked them
[55:16] and beat them showing that they didn't
[55:20] have the power over this demon like they
[55:23] thought they would have had I mean it
[55:25] looked great to to cast him out but they
[55:27] didn't have the power to do it and this
[55:30] was known verse
[55:32] 17 this was known to all the Jews and
[55:34] Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear
[55:37] fell on
[55:39] all and the name of the Lord Jesus was
[55:44] magnified and many that believed came
[55:46] and confessed and showed their deeds
[55:48] many of them also which used curious
[55:51] Arts brought their books together and
[55:53] burned them before all men and they
[55:56] counted the price of them and founded
[55:59] 50,000 pieces of silver silver so
[56:03] mightily grew the word of God and
[56:06] Prevail so how does the word grow the RO
[56:10] word grows in its effect as it manifests
[56:14] as others receive it that same word we
[56:17] want that word to grow in us too now
[56:22] we I'll take a few places here in the
[56:25] message
[56:26] message
[56:31] and of course Romans 8:26 tells us that
[56:35] we don't know what to pray
[56:37] for but the spirit gives us what to pray
[56:41] for with groanings that cannot be
[56:46] uttered in the
[56:48] message first Peter 3 or or in the
[56:51] scripture 1 Peter 3 1-8 it says of
[56:56] course is talking about wives being
[56:58] subject to their own
[57:00] husbands those that don't obey the word
[57:03] they may without the word be won by
[57:05] their conversations he talking about how
[57:07] the wives they should you know their
[57:10] their their their their conversation
[57:12] they're being watched should be coupled
[57:14] with fear how they should Adorn
[57:17] themselves but look at verse S it says
[57:19] likewise your husbands dwell with them
[57:22] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[57:25] the wife as unto the weaker vessel as
[57:28] being HS together of the grace of life
[57:32] that your prayers be not
[57:35] hindered and so we this is where we want
[57:39] to really approach our
[57:43] prayers with the with the correct
[57:46] attitude that my motive for what I'm
[57:50] asking for is a scriptural motive
[57:52] there's a scriptural reason for it but
[57:55] then my heart 's motive behind that
[57:58] scripture manifestation what really is
[58:01] that what really am I asking for Lord if
[58:06] you bless me to sing with the power of
[58:10] the anointing well if he did that would
[58:13] that change would that change you would
[58:16] that cause you to now start to look at
[58:18] yourself in a way that's that's aiss
[58:22] it's sickly it's not healthy it's not
[58:27] the road to uh you know to um to a
[58:31] complete H adoption our body change
[58:35] remember we have a body change first and
[58:38] then there's a Rapture our next move is
[58:41] a body change so as we pray we get into
[58:45] the spirit of prayer we have not because
[58:48] we ask not and we ask and don't receive
[58:53] because we ask aiss
[58:56] the reason why we're asking I think that
[58:59] needs to be on the examination table I
[59:03] think that needs to be really at the
[59:07] Forefront of what I'm asking for and why
[59:10] why is it my prayers being answer what's
[59:13] going on here husbands treat your wives
[59:17] so that your prayers be not hinder these
[59:19] little points in the word are all part
[59:23] of this prayer and our prayer life how
[59:26] it connects to the power of God in our
[59:28] life and so you know that's the value of
[59:31] a little little prayer meeting or a time
[59:33] in prayer the prophet of God says this
[59:36] in the message Jesus on the authority of
[59:38] the word
[59:39] 1954 he says for instance many times
[59:42] there are people come in the line and I
[59:44] pray for them I never know what's going
[59:46] to happen I just pray for them and there
[59:50] is a power in
[59:52] prayer prayer will even change the word
[59:55] of God
[59:57] that was a striker wasn't it but it's
[59:59] the truth the word of the Lord and he
[1:00:03] goes and he tells that story about
[1:00:04] Isaiah and Hezekiah and the message
[1:00:07] expectations he says this here paragraph
[1:00:09] number six right at the beginning of the
[1:00:11] message he says now a minister any
[1:00:14] Minister has just as much right to pray
[1:00:16] for the sick or Ley just as much as
[1:00:19] anyone else because he said confess your
[1:00:22] faults one to another and pray one for
[1:00:25] another
[1:00:26] that you might or may be healed for the
[1:00:30] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:00:32] man availeth much I do believe that
[1:00:36] there's power in prayer I've seen some
[1:00:40] very direct answers to prayer but never
[1:00:43] healed anybody in my life but I've seen
[1:00:45] God do a lot of it so I believe that
[1:00:48] it's the individual's faith in a work
[1:00:51] that's already been completed
[1:00:54] Amen brother bam continues in the
[1:00:57] message the token and he says this here
[1:01:01] talking about the Holy Ghost which is
[1:01:03] the
[1:01:04] token he
[1:01:06] says that the token paragraph 338 the
[1:01:09] token is a sign that the purchase has
[1:01:12] been made and been accepted now you
[1:01:15] can't get the token from the railroad
[1:01:16] Fair until you pay the price and the
[1:01:19] only way you're going to you're going to
[1:01:22] pay the price is pay it that's right
[1:01:26] what believe it accept it full obedience
[1:01:31] to the whole word of God will entitle
[1:01:34] you to the Token full obedience not the
[1:01:38] part of it as far as your denomination
[1:01:41] goes but all of it full obedience to the
[1:01:45] word which is Christ brings you into
[1:01:49] Christ amen that's in the message the
[1:01:53] token he continues on in paragraph 349
[1:01:56] maybe it's a different number back there
[1:01:58] but it's in the message to the Token
[1:02:01] 1960 um 1963 I believe it
[1:02:05] is at any rate he says when we
[1:02:09] pray then we must present the
[1:02:13] token Lord I have obeyed you fully I
[1:02:17] have repented of my sins I feel that you
[1:02:21] have forgiven me I've been baptized in
[1:02:23] the name of Jesus Christ the holy spirit
[1:02:26] is upon me now I have need of certain
[1:02:30] thing a certain thing for your glory
[1:02:34] Lord I ask for it it's mine now then
[1:02:38] there is something anchors back here pH
[1:02:42] it's yours that does it then it's all

[1:03:05] forth we apply the blood believe it
[1:03:09] that's all
[1:03:11] right amen so we know that full
[1:03:15] obedience to the whole word of God
[1:03:18] entitles us to the Token
[1:03:20] complete full obedience to the word the
[1:03:25] whole word of God entitles us to the
[1:03:28] token and then when we have the token we
[1:03:31] present the token in our prayers like
[1:03:34] we're going to do tonight and then we we
[1:03:36] have something that we we're actually we
[1:03:39] have a goal we have we pick a spot we
[1:03:41] have a Target it's not random it's like
[1:03:45] you know like I gave the example here
[1:03:46] before like when the first deer I shot
[1:03:50] uh the brother that took me out there is
[1:03:52] out here and I was so excited i' been to
[1:03:55] the SHO shooting range I cided the gun
[1:03:57] in and I knew how to shoot I had a good
[1:04:00] little idea and then we go up early we
[1:04:03] ready looking for something we finally
[1:04:06] see a deer and I was ready to
[1:04:09] shoot and then the brother he said uh
[1:04:13] okay where you gonna shoot it at I was
[1:04:15] like oh okay yeah I gotta pick a spot
[1:04:19] don't I yes so it's you know you you got
[1:04:24] all the preparation there you have the
[1:04:26] gun set you see the animal now pick a
[1:04:30] spot that you're going for it's specific
[1:04:34] it's not random it's like well maybe
[1:04:36] I'll hit it or maybe I won't no no it's
[1:04:39] a you pick your spot you call that name
[1:04:42] out of that child or co-worker or spouse
[1:04:47] you call their name out don't be afraid
[1:04:49] to ask God to do the miraculous and to
[1:04:53] do what is impossible to be done and you
[1:04:57] you present that and and why are you
[1:05:00] asking for it what is your motive behind
[1:05:02] it Lord I Want It For Your
[1:05:06] Glory I want your name to be
[1:05:09] glorified I want to be able to give a
[1:05:11] testimony of your power and your glory
[1:05:15] that you're the same yesterday today and
[1:05:18] forever
[1:05:20] amen you find that spot you pick that
[1:05:24] spot and you squee off that shot and if
[1:05:27] you missed then you do it again you try
[1:05:29] it again if you missed then come back
[1:05:32] next year and try it again you keep
[1:05:34] going until you hit the target and
[1:05:37] that's the way our prayers are they're
[1:05:38] very specific it's not random it's not
[1:05:41] you know we we're just going to go to
[1:05:42] sleep we're g you know you know we go
[1:05:44] down our knees the soft music will play
[1:05:46] I'll kind of look over this way I look
[1:05:48] are they done praying is everybody done
[1:05:49] then I'm done no that ain't prayer no
[1:05:52] are you praying who you praying to what
[1:05:55] are you praying
[1:05:56] about what are you zeroed in on what is
[1:06:00] the motive and the objective to it and
[1:06:03] then we know that in prayer is where God
[1:06:09] will give us more power in the message
[1:06:12] what was the Holy Ghost given for the
[1:06:14] prophet of God says this
[1:06:22] here paragraph 94 that's the purpose of
[1:06:25] the Holy Ghost that's what God sent the
[1:06:27] Holy Ghost
[1:06:28] for the Holy Ghost come to give you
[1:06:33] power I got so much so more scriptures
[1:06:37] here just a minute the Holy Ghost come
[1:06:40] to give you power you can find this I'm
[1:06:44] just too much away tonight give you
[1:06:47] power power in prayer you take a person
[1:06:52] that's lived a good life but they're
[1:06:53] always defeated or tell you're a good
[1:06:56] person oh sure I love the Lord but
[1:06:58] brother bandom always defeated they
[1:07:01] never get a prayer answer you feel that
[1:07:04] little woman with the Holy Ghost one
[1:07:06] time watch what takes place when she
[1:07:08] goes before God she's not defeated she
[1:07:12] comes boldly to the throne of God
[1:07:15] believing she has a right because she's
[1:07:18] a daughter of God by a birth take that
[1:07:21] little man so cowardly that the bosss
[1:07:24] kick him all over the place say wait a
[1:07:26] minute here now something changed see
[1:07:29] he's got the Holy Ghost it gives you
[1:07:32] power your life is full of power it
[1:07:36] gives you power in your
[1:07:41] speech amen he gives you the
[1:07:45] power
[1:07:47] yes he says it again
[1:07:55] yes he'll give you power the power in
[1:07:58] prayer that's what he'll
[1:08:02] do and that's what the Holy Ghost was
[1:08:04] given for and you shall receive power
[1:08:07] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:08:10] you it's another horse power another
[1:08:15] level of power that we all need this is
[1:08:18] the power that's going to Rapture us
[1:08:22] this is the power before the Rapture
[1:08:24] that's going to change change our bodies
[1:08:27] it will Quicken our mortal bodies so why
[1:08:30] is there this huge gap between the holy
[1:08:33] ghost coming Upon Our natural bodies and
[1:08:36] then we think the Rapture just going to
[1:08:38] happen like that and we resist the power
[1:08:41] of God all the time or don't even ask
[1:08:43] for it not expecting it don't pray for
[1:08:46] it in the Holy Ghost there is power and
[1:08:50] we need that power you know that Holy
[1:08:53] Ghost Power attracts the attention of
[1:08:56] three kinds of Believers it does but
[1:09:00] it's for the True Believer and this is
[1:09:02] what I am Desiring this is what we need
[1:09:06] in our church uh uh this is what we need
[1:09:08] in our Ministries this is what we need
[1:09:12] every time we meet every service we need
[1:09:16] the power of God In Our Song service the
[1:09:20] power of God in our preachings the after
[1:09:23] the sermon the power of God the fall on
[1:09:25] the Altar and then those hearts the
[1:09:28] power of God coming upon people and they
[1:09:31] begin to change their ways and change
[1:09:34] their life we don't need to pray for
[1:09:36] more power we need to live such a Godly
[1:09:39] life he says we don't need more power we
[1:09:41] need to surrender and control that life
[1:09:45] so that the power of God that's in you
[1:09:48] can can come to a greater manifestation
[1:09:52] that's our desire and I believe that's
[1:09:55] real prayer that's a true prayer you say
[1:09:57] brother Israel I got all I need that's
[1:09:59] on you that's on you but I believe for
[1:10:02] me for me I'm praying God to give me a
[1:10:07] double
[1:10:08] portion another portion like the the the
[1:10:12] anointing that I hear on the tapes that
[1:10:14] prayer line that discernment I don't
[1:10:16] have the gift of discernment but I want
[1:10:18] the power that's causing that
[1:10:20] discernment to work I want that in my
[1:10:23] prayer closet I want that in my Ministry
[1:10:26] I want that in my life so that he would
[1:10:28] be glorified and let me say it like this
[1:10:32] if getting more power is going to cause
[1:10:34] me to be a stuffed shirt or to backslide
[1:10:37] then I don't want no more power I don't
[1:10:41] and and I don't want the power until I
[1:10:43] can handle
[1:10:45] it I don't want more power or more
[1:10:48] anointing till I can handle it so I want
[1:10:51] my life crucified with Christ I want a
[1:10:54] humble my ways I really want to look
[1:10:57] deep into the heart of what I really
[1:11:00] want what I really desire for this
[1:11:02] church for my family for my own little
[1:11:07] life really what do I really really want
[1:11:11] I want it for a name do I want my
[1:11:13] children saved just so they don't
[1:11:16] embarrass me or do I want them saved so
[1:11:19] I can be with him in the eternities you
[1:11:21] want your family members saved so you
[1:11:23] can brag and say my old families in or
[1:11:26] do you want your family saved for the
[1:11:28] glory of God you want to see the church
[1:11:31] full so we can say we got the biggest
[1:11:33] church we got more people than last year
[1:11:35] or do we really internalize seeing
[1:11:38] another Soul come to the kingdom of
[1:11:44] God Simon wanted to lay hands so
[1:11:47] somebody would receive the Holy Ghost
[1:11:49] and he was in the bitter G he was in the
[1:11:52] evil dark place and he needed to repent
[1:11:56] and just writing it down it was a pretty
[1:11:58] you know decent re I want to lay hands
[1:12:00] so people receive the Holy Ghost your
[1:12:02] motive isn't right you need to
[1:12:07] repent that's what that's what that's
[1:12:09] what Peter told him I want us to
[1:12:11] internalize that so how what's our
[1:12:14] approach when we come to prayer now
[1:12:16] what's our approach first thing we
[1:12:19] should do brother brandom says we should
[1:12:21] start our prayer with worship you get
[1:12:25] into the spirit of worship father I love
[1:12:28] you I thank you you're my father it's
[1:12:32] our approach of course he's a friend
[1:12:35] like no other of course you'll be your
[1:12:37] brother your sister but Jesus said they
[1:12:39] said teach us how to pray not just to
[1:12:42] pray but how to pray he says when you
[1:12:45] pray say our father the approach is
[1:12:51] right just don't run up and call you
[1:12:55] know somebody you know that he's a he's
[1:12:58] a pastor or Reverend or brother or
[1:12:59] sister you just don't call him by their
[1:13:01] first name you don't know him like that
[1:13:04] come with respect just in the natural
[1:13:07] you come before God there's a respect
[1:13:09] there's a
[1:13:10] reverence and Our Father which are in
[1:13:14] heaven holy is your
[1:13:18] name thy will be done not my will thy
[1:13:23] kingdom come the the power and all the
[1:13:26] glory is thine this is the right
[1:13:29] approach you know coming and Wheeling
[1:13:32] God around so you can get a bigger
[1:13:36] contract so you can have a bigger truck
[1:13:39] than the next fellow on your street and
[1:13:42] you can have a better this and that
[1:13:44] that's the American
[1:13:46] way and and we get influenced by that
[1:13:49] huh am I right Saints is it wrong to
[1:13:52] have a big truck no go get it it's fine
[1:13:56] long it's it's a Ford I mean I mean you
[1:13:59] can get whatever that's not the point
[1:14:01] whether it's a truck or car or moped
[1:14:05] whatever it is a scooter but if your
[1:14:08] motive isn't right then you ain't right
[1:14:10] you're just not right we want the power
[1:14:12] of God want the anointed to come in our
[1:14:15] church we want the we want the people
[1:14:17] see pour out of the Holy Ghost for what
[1:14:21] bragging rights no no no no no no no
[1:14:25] Lord help us get our approach right and
