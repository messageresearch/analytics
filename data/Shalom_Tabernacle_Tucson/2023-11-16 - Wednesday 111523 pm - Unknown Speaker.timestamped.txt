[17:42] says Amy man I want to thank the Lord
[17:45] for the meetings we just come through
[17:48] it's been a tremendous success in my
[17:51] opinion I feel like the Lord was blessed
[17:54] and he really uh the Lord did it has
[17:58] done done and is doing some mighty great
[18:01] things for us through those through the
[18:04] ministering Gifts of his word the
[18:06] presence of the Lord and so we certainly
[18:09] appreciate that I want to just take a
[18:12] two places in the scripture St John
[18:18] 1426 and just maybe touch on a few
[18:23] things from the meetings this
[18:26] weekend as
[18:28] a reminder What the Lord Has Done For Us
[18:31] St John 14 verse
[18:36] 20 six we take
[18:39] verse number
[18:43] 23 if a man love me he will keep my
[18:46] words and my father will love him and we
[18:49] will come unto him and make our Abode
[18:51] with him he that loveth me not keepeth
[18:54] not my says and the word which you hear
[18:57] is not not mine but the father's which
[19:00] sent me these things have I spoken unto
[19:03] you being yet present with you but the
[19:07] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[19:10] the father will send in my name he shall
[19:12] teach you all things and bring all
[19:16] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[19:19] have said unto you amen thank the Lord
[19:24] for the comforter that will teach us
[19:27] second Peter
[19:29] chapter
[19:30] 1 this was kind
[19:34] of one of the keynote themes of our
[19:37] meetings it's the statue of a perfect
[19:40] man uh where brother bam takes this
[19:42] scripture and preaches the statue of a
[19:44] perfect
[19:45] man and in
[19:50] verse
[19:53] um number
[19:56] four we take take verse three blessed be
[19:59] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[20:02] Christ which according to His abundant
[20:04] Mercy hath begotten us again unto I'm
[20:08] sorry uh let's see pardon me second
[20:12] Peter
[20:14] yeah chapter
[20:18] one verse two Grace and peace be
[20:22] multiplied unto you through the
[20:23] knowledge of God and Jesus our lord
[20:27] according as his divine power have given
[20:30] unto us all things that pertain unto
[20:33] life and godliness through the knowledge
[20:35] of him that ha called us to glory and
[20:39] virtue whereby are given unto us
[20:42] exceeding great and precious promises
[20:45] that by these you might be partakers of
[20:47] the divine nature having escaped the
[20:50] corruption that is in the world through
[20:52] lust this is what brother Paul was
[20:54] bringing on Saturday
[20:56] morning and besides this is giving all
[20:59] diligence add to your faith virtue to
[21:02] Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance
[21:05] to Temperance patience patience
[21:07] godliness to Godliness brotherly
[21:09] kindness to brotherly to brotherly
[21:12] kindness
[21:13] charity for if these things be in you
[21:16] and abound they make you that ye shall
[21:19] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[21:22] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[21:25] he that lacketh these things is blind
[21:28] cannot see a far off and have forgotten
[21:31] that he was purged from his old sins
[21:34] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[21:38] diligence to make your calling and
[21:40] election sure for if you do these things
[21:43] you shall never fall for so an entrance
[21:47] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[21:50] in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[21:52] and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will
[21:57] not be negligent to put you always in
[22:00] remembrance of these things though you
[22:03] know them and be established in the
[22:06] present truth amen and that's what we
[22:09] just want to bring you to remembrance of
[22:12] some of these things though we may know
[22:15] them but they are to establish Us in the
[22:18] present truth God bless you you may be
[22:20] seated and thank God for the reading of
[22:22] his word amen we certainly as I said
[22:26] appreciate the the meetings that we had
[22:29] and of course they didn't come without a
[22:31] sacrifice and without a a test and
[22:34] without great cost um physically and so
[22:38] forth there's a number of folks that are
[22:41] out sick tonight and weary in their
[22:44] bodies I tell you on Saturday night I
[22:48] had a headache that I hadn't had for I
[22:50] don't know I don't remember having a
[22:52] headache that bad for years terrible
[22:55] splitting headache and I know was part
[22:57] of my my tiredness and part of the
[22:59] stress and the hustle and bustle of the
[23:02] meeting and I know my face didn't look
[23:05] too good I tried to make it look good
[23:08] but I know my head was hurting so bad I
[23:10] got in the back office with Brother John
[23:13] and we prayed for the service as we
[23:16] normally do and he got out he started
[23:19] singing I was just going to wait back
[23:20] there and I decided to come out as we
[23:23] start singing I think it's the first
[23:25] song we started singing I lifted my hand
[23:28] it started just to Worship the Lord and
[23:30] it just immediately broke off of me and
[23:33] I just enjoy the rest of the service and
[23:36] quite frankly I enjoy the rest of the
[23:37] meetings and so I thank the Lord for
[23:40] that amen um but on Friday night as we
[23:44] know brother whisper brought that
[23:45] beautiful message on zerubba Bell and uh
[23:49] part one and then part two and really
[23:53] the message if you bring them both
[23:55] together he was bringing this message of
[23:59] the stature of a perfect man the new
[24:02] birth being filled with the Holy G ghost
[24:06] being born again making our way to the
[24:09] adoption and I'd like to encourage you
[24:14] to go back and listen to three primary
[24:17] messages that will help you and one of
[24:20] them was the message that he was quoting
[24:21] out of the message of Grace We're going
[24:24] to play a portion of that for you
[24:26] tonight the message of Grace
[24:28] preached in um 1963 I believe 62 63 and
[24:34] the other is uh statue of a perfect man
[24:37] and blasphemous names and blasphemous
[24:41] names really the first part of it
[24:44] because the message Blasphemous names
[24:47] he's going to go into uh Revelations and
[24:51] talking about the names of blasphemy and
[24:54] the denominational churches but really
[24:55] the first part of the message
[24:58] he is opening up what he brought in this
[25:01] message a statute of a perfect man so I
[25:04] call it part one and part two statue of
[25:07] a perfect man and then Blasphemous names
[25:11] go back and hear those again I just love
[25:14] how the new birth and the baptism of the
[25:17] Holy Ghost is a continual yes sir and
[25:20] it's an experience upon experience and
[25:23] we had meetings here on the Holy Ghost
[25:26] we had a prayer line for that we
[25:29] listened to those last messages of
[25:32] 1959 for the purpose of bringing us
[25:36] into receiving the Holy Ghost brother
[25:38] banam did it for his own Tabernacle and
[25:41] there's a lot that goes with it and I
[25:43] think and I believe that bringing all
[25:46] that together will be a blessing to
[25:49] you brother Paul takes the scriptures in
[25:54] uh Luke
[25:56] 17:26 Genesis chapter 6 and 2 Timothy 3
[26:01] chapter 1 talks about the perilous times
[26:05] and the Darkness of the age what I would
[26:08] uh like to encourage us to do is to go
[26:11] back and go through those messages that
[26:13] we heard because what what will happen
[26:17] is it was good it was nice but then we
[26:20] won't adjust or change our lives based
[26:23] on what we heard and that was a lot that
[26:25] we heard and I I have to say that they
[26:29] were not running the owls jumping
[26:32] dancing like that and I think we only
[26:35] had one alter call for the whole service
[26:37] meetings that was the Saturday night of
[26:39] course the altar is always open so it
[26:41] wasn't one of those Services where all
[26:44] the young people came up it wasn't one
[26:46] of those Services where we had a prayer
[26:49] line uh where we emptied every road and
[26:51] pray for the sick like that but I think
[26:54] it was one of the major messages or
[26:57] meeting meetings that we have had and I
[27:00] really don't want us to miss that you
[27:02] know sometimes the great powerful things
[27:06] move very quietly oh yeah like the
[27:10] sunrising the Sun that huge ball of
[27:13] energy it rises without saying one word
[27:17] and everybody knows it's rising and it
[27:19] does tremendous effect and what happens
[27:22] if it doesn't rise then we'll all be
[27:25] done so the great powerful things many
[27:27] times like I say they're they're not
[27:32] always drastic but they're like getting
[27:35] a an adjustment from a
[27:38] chiropractor and you get on that table
[27:40] and you'll just adjust a few little
[27:43] things and it makes a tremendous
[27:44] difference and I'd like you to go back
[27:46] and get those messages and I like you to
[27:49] take those uh messages of the Prophet
[27:52] the message of Grace stature of a
[27:55] perfect man and Blas Blasphemous names
[27:58] now I feel to tell you that it's up to
[28:01] you uh to to do it all right that's my
[28:05] encouragement to you I think there will
[28:07] be a blessing for you one of the
[28:09] questions maybe came up on with brother
[28:12] whisper message on zerubabel I've heard
[28:15] some people say a couple different
[28:17] things uh first I want to say uh what he
[28:21] preached I believe it exactly that way
[28:24] exactly 100% there was nothing in the
[28:27] teaching or the preaching that I did not
[28:31] agree with and furthermore I'll take
[28:33] another step to say that there is a
[28:37] growing element amongst the leadership
[28:40] pastors I'm talking about that would
[28:43] have a
[28:44] problem with maybe what he brought or
[28:48] the delivery method and of course his
[28:51] deliver is quite different than is
[28:53] brother Ferguson is quite different than
[28:55] brother Paul they're all very different
[28:56] for all Faith they're all very different
[28:59] can I get a witness I'm different and so
[29:02] an artist like I can look in the mirror
[29:04] and try to draw myself and I wouldn't do
[29:07] a very good job but an artist can draw
[29:09] me better than I can draw myself and so
[29:11] that's a gift that's a talent and so if
[29:14] I'm trying to speak on
[29:16] something my delivery would be different
[29:20] and all Brothers brother George whoever
[29:22] their delivery would be different but
[29:25] you go back and you hear the content
[29:27] that's being said and and I set in the
[29:30] back normally I don't I'm usually in the
[29:32] front right in front where the preacher
[29:34] can see me but I sit in the
[29:36] back and uh that's probably why I don't
[29:39] sit in the back because I see a lot of
[29:41] reactions I see visitors I say woo how
[29:44] they take that statement woo how they
[29:46] and I really should just be feeding on
[29:47] the word that's why I like sitting in
[29:49] the front uh sitting in the back you see
[29:51] too much stuff yes okay but I sat in the
[29:55] back and uh he had a picture up of
[29:58] brother
[29:59] brandham and on the T on the top of it
[30:03] said that that was Z rubab Bell and I
[30:06] was like yes say it beautiful wonderful
[30:10] because I'm coming from a student of the
[30:13] word position and I've studied it and
[30:16] I've actually read those quotes from
[30:19] that very message to this church but my
[30:21] delivery would be different and then
[30:23] time and all of that some of you may not
[30:26] uh remember but he started to read those
[30:29] quotes in there and there's one quote in
[30:32] paragraph number 52 I believe I know he
[30:36] had it there to read it he did not read
[30:38] it it didn't take away from anything but
[30:41] I want to read it for you here too
[30:44] because it might it might have seemed a
[30:47] little drastic to say that brother ranam
[30:49] was the the
[30:51] zerubabel but we would have no problem
[30:55] if we said he was eler
[30:58] but we know we're talking about a type
[31:00] of
[31:02] elaser so you have to show Grace on all
[31:04] levels just don't be you're not
[31:07] comfortable with it because you didn't
[31:08] hear it before but he was saying of
[31:11] course he couldn't be the elaser of the
[31:13] Bible uh he had a father and so forth
[31:16] but he was saying in type okay so follow
[31:19] all the way through so the grace to say
[31:22] that brother vam was elaser we know I
[31:25] shouldn't have to qualify that every
[31:27] time to message people that you know
[31:31] that I'm talking about he's a type of
[31:33] elaser can I get a witness all right so
[31:36] in this message the message of
[31:39] Grace sis help me out thank you brother
[31:42] random says this
[31:46] here we're going to play this part of
[31:48] this for you that it will be a blessing
[31:51] to
[31:54] you it's one of my favorite quotes the
[31:56] anoint anointing jacket spiritual
[31:59] thinking anointing jacket I love that
[32:01] how brother R brings that but it's in
[32:04] the message of Grace and brother brandom
[32:06] says in paragraph number 48 he says we
[32:08] are all acquainted with this scripture
[32:11] that reads the Bible we know that this
[32:14] was during the time of the preparation
[32:17] of the temple and zerubabel was a great
[32:20] Prince amongst the people who had laid
[32:23] the foundation of the building now you I
[32:26] want you to put on your spiritual
[32:28] thinking anointing jacket this morning
[32:32] as we think and this great Prince had
[32:35] determined to rebuild the house of the
[32:37] Lord then when he did he laid the
[32:40] foundation stone and as we read on
[32:43] further we find out that that God said
[32:46] zerubabel has laid the foundation with
[32:49] his hands he also shall bring forth a
[32:51] headstone I want you to notice he never
[32:54] said he shall bring forth a Cornerstone
[32:57] he shall bring forth The
[33:00] Headstone and we know that the scripture
[33:02] says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone
[33:06] now this is this is where brother
[33:08] whisper stopped he didn't read this
[33:10] paragraph 50 and I want you to read this
[33:12] now so he's talking about zerubabel he's
[33:15] talking about Zachariah 4 he reads the
[33:18] scripture and brother Ram if you
[33:20] continue reading he says and we know
[33:21] that the scripture says that Jesus is
[33:24] the Chief Cornerstone and he's also The
[33:27] Headstone now and now if we will think
[33:30] for a few minutes that the seventh
[33:33] Church messenger was to restore the
[33:36] faith of the children back to the father
[33:39] in other words rebuild the church again
[33:43] under the power of the spirit not by
[33:47] power not by might but by my spirit
[33:50] sayeth the Lord not by organization not
[33:53] by denomination but by the Holy Spirit
[33:55] God will bring forth the chch Church in
[33:58] the last days so here he's talking about
[33:59] Z rerel Zechariah chap 4 and then he
[34:03] brings in the seventh Church age
[34:05] messenger why is he doing that well you
[34:08] got to have your anointing jacket on and
[34:11] you got to have your spiritual thinking
[34:13] on he set you up for that put on your
[34:17] spiritual anointing jacket and then he
[34:20] brings in the seventh angel messenger
[34:23] paragraph 56 he says this according to
[34:27] the prophecy there will come The
[34:29] Headstone and I want you to notice that
[34:31] when The Headstone comes the prince
[34:34] that's going to cry out the message will
[34:36] cry Grace Grace for it's by grace are we
[34:41] saved that not of Works lest any man
[34:44] should boast and the message of Grace
[34:47] has been traed under fooot under men
[34:48] until it's become a disgrace some of
[34:50] them runs into eternal security some
[34:52] runs over into everything but the true
[34:55] message of Grace remains the same and
[34:58] there's where Satan tries to knock it
[34:59] out from the church but it's the grace
[35:02] of God that we're all saved by amen so
[35:09] that's beautiful the title of his
[35:11] message was a message of Grace then he
[35:13] says this great Prince is going to bring
[35:17] the message of Grace and then he refers
[35:19] to the seventh angel
[35:22] messenger that's going to bring not by
[35:25] power not by mind which is Zechariah 4
[35:29] so who is he speaking of he's not
[35:31] talking about Billy
[35:33] Graham he's sh talking about Ora
[35:36] Roberts he's not talking about Pastor
[35:39] Reverend s who is he talking
[35:41] about and so to get the full context of
[35:44] it I want you to listen to that message
[35:46] it's in that message that the Holy
[35:49] Spirit speaks to him about the Jehovah
[35:54] of the Old Testament is Jesus of the the
[35:57] new those three rainbows we're going to
[35:59] play that for you just for a moment it's
[36:01] a very very important uh uh uh
[36:06] Revelation to know that the three are
[36:10] one not that they just agree in one but
[36:13] the three are one that the Lord Jesus
[36:18] Christ is Jehovah the heavenly father
[36:23] and they're not three persons it's one
[36:26] person's
[36:27] with those attributes and that's a
[36:28] tremendous revelation we kind of just
[36:31] step over it and we quote it but the age
[36:34] lost that and the Z zerubabel anointing
[36:39] had to restore that and the zerubabel
[36:42] and the Bible had to restore the
[36:44] building of the natural Temple um as the
[36:48] zerubabel in type would restore the
[36:52] spiritual house that God dwells in
[36:55] that's this message for this last last
[36:56] day I trust that was a
[36:59] blessing uh to you how he brought it I
[37:02] know there's some you know newcomer new
[37:04] voice a new delivery it could throw some
[37:07] people off but if you're a student of
[37:09] the word you'll know where and I do
[37:12] agree I don't agree with saying Amen to
[37:14] something that you don't understand keep
[37:17] quiet until you do understand and uh
[37:20] keep the criticism quiet too until you
[37:22] understand and so you get an
[37:24] understanding and then pick pick up the
[37:27] message go listen to it for your that's
[37:30] on you that's your diligence to do that
[37:33] amen you don't wait till don't hey what
[37:35] did you think about what brother what
[37:37] did you think about what the P what do
[37:39] you think did you open that did you even
[37:41] take any notes from the message that was
[37:43] brought and did you go back and hear it
[37:45] for yourself now whose responsibility is
[37:50] that we say it all the time say what the
[37:52] tapes say how can you say what the tapes
[37:54] say if you're not playing the tapes
[37:57] and so if any question comes then pick
[37:59] up the tape teaching and go back look at
[38:03] your notes pray and ask God to bless you
[38:07] and help you and he will amen amen and
[38:12] so and then Peter brings this sobering
[38:15] message and he really brings a warning
[38:18] to us and um that warning was that all
[38:23] the plagues of Egypt the Israelites
[38:26] escaped except for the last plague that
[38:30] struck everybody and that last plague
[38:33] was death and today it's spiritual death
[38:37] and he talked about how that came in and
[38:40] he brought the quotations about how
[38:42] Hollywood was brought in and he really
[38:46] brought in this the quote how brother
[38:48] vam talked about that spirit that was on
[38:51] the Nazi Germany that caused him to
[38:55] persecute the Jews that same spirit will
[38:58] persecute the last day bride the last
[39:01] day church it's a Roman Spirit it has
[39:05] nothing to do that the Bible or their
[39:07] Christians it's the spirit and that
[39:10] Spirit persecuted the Christians then
[39:13] that Spirit persecuted the Jews and then
[39:16] that Spirit was
[39:18] Unleashed on the bride 200,000,000
[39:23] Horsemen spiritual Chargers released out
[39:27] of the river Euphrates upon the bride
[39:30] that's the age that we live in it's not
[39:33] a it's not a joke it's a prayer meeting
[39:36] message it's a message to strike your
[39:39] prayer meeting he brings up brother Paul
[39:42] did the asbery Revival and he thought
[39:45] well could this be the foolish virgin
[39:47] looking for oil well if the foolish
[39:49] virgin is looking for oil then we know
[39:53] for the bride it's lamp trimming time
[39:56] time amen now I wonder how many bride
[39:59] members people that follow the message
[40:02] looked at the Asberry thing just as a
[40:04] news piece or something to talk about I
[40:07] wonder what they're doing or they're not
[40:09] in the word or it's false I wonder it's
[40:11] going to come out of curiosity versus
[40:14] identifying it in the scripture that it
[40:18] could be the foolish virgin looking for
[40:20] oil so what what am I supposed to be
[40:22] doing missing more Church missing more
[40:26] prayer
[40:27] meetings no serious Saints and so the
[40:30] these these messages now God sends a
[40:33] gift it sends a humble little gift tall
[40:36] guy Paul durksen we've seen him before
[40:38] handsome guy lovely wife comes up there
[40:41] preach very common but if you don't see
[40:44] the gift of God that that that that's
[40:46] the Lord speaking to you you will miss
[40:49] your day in its message and the warning
[40:52] that come from that you know and it
[40:55] could be said said well Lord give me a
[40:58] second chance why didn't you warn me I
[41:00] brought a man all the way from a
[41:02] province of Saskatchewan flew him all
[41:05] the way down drove him down here to
[41:07] preach to you a message and you rode and
[41:11] you said amen but you kind of rolled
[41:13] your eyes like he ain't say
[41:16] nothing prayer life didn't change Bible
[41:19] study didn't change tape time didn't
[41:21] change nothing changed but we had
[41:23] special meetings you know I believe
[41:25] God's going to hold me accountable and
[41:28] hold us
[41:30] accountable so brother whisper comes all
[41:33] the way from England brother Ferguson
[41:34] all the way from can Montreal the other
[41:37] ones that come and then they stand
[41:39] behind the pulpit the song specials the
[41:41] word that was preached the scriptures
[41:44] that were given and many people didn't
[41:46] take one hair of a
[41:49] note well maybe we have our memory so
[41:52] great we don't need to take
[41:54] notes so this is not a I'm not bashing
[41:58] you don't take it that way I'm just as
[42:00] reminding you amen though you know these
[42:04] things amen so it's recorded it's on
[42:07] tape it's beautiful you can go back and
[42:10] hear them and say Lord what what are you
[42:12] trying to say to me through those
[42:14] meetings whether Paul brings in that the
[42:17] last plague was spiritual death can I
[42:19] take five or 10 more
[42:21] minutes brother Ferguson brings a
[42:24] message on the ministry of
[42:25] reconciliation
[42:27] you talk about a beautiful message
[42:31] on
[42:32] justification and being
[42:35] forgiven and he separated what it meant
[42:38] to be
[42:39] pardon and these truths will never leave
[42:42] a True Believer
[42:44] these I mean I can't think of anything
[42:48] more beautiful than being forgiven if
[42:50] you can't be forgiven then you can't be
[42:53] saved you can't come back to God God so
[42:57] he makes a way for forgiveness but then
[43:00] he moves us even past forgiveness he
[43:04] justifies us and justify means you never
[43:08] even done it in the first place God
[43:11] makes you righteous and who can lay
[43:15] anything against the elect who can bring
[43:17] a charge or an accusation against the
[43:22] elect a beautiful message he shared with
[43:25] us about how we should be reconciled to
[43:29] our brothers if there's a riff there
[43:32] there's an issue and also the word wants
[43:35] us reconciled back to God as a human
[43:38] being we need to be reconciled back to
[43:39] God but in the ministers meeting he
[43:42] brought out a point that I thought was
[43:44] beautiful and that was reconciling the
[43:47] word with the word that there are no
[43:51] conflicts in the word has some people
[43:53] make try to make you pick sides on a
[43:56] Doctrine or an issue all of it is on
[44:00] God's side and so people want you to say
[44:03] well you know what do you believe these
[44:05] quotes or th those quotes and just tell
[44:07] them I believe all the quotes you
[44:09] believe Jesus or Peter or I believe all
[44:12] of the Bible it's only the devil that
[44:15] doesn't want the scriptures to reconcile
[44:17] and dovile and say the same thing when
[44:20] you know the scriptures say that then
[44:22] you don't have to be afraid of any
[44:25] Doctrine or any Scripture or any
[44:28] quotation you don't have to be afraid
[44:30] because you know it doves tails with the
[44:33] rest of the message amen so A beautiful
[44:37] thought and then on Sunday night brother
[44:40] feron
[44:41] Fay picked up the token again he was
[44:44] preaching out of the message the token
[44:45] to apply the blood don't just say you're
[44:49] part of it get in it he brought the
[44:53] seriousness of it it's time to stop
[44:55] playing Church it's time to apply the
[44:58] token not just come to church not just
[45:01] pay your tie not any of that it's apply
[45:04] the
[45:05] token and beautiful that these messages
[45:11] should in should have encouraged us and
[45:14] I believe they did to really be sealed
[45:19] place and
[45:21] adopted because that's really what God
[45:23] has called us to we're predestinated to
[45:25] to adoption and you know all these
[45:29] things that are holding us back the
[45:32] things that we have fallen
[45:35] into um brother Ferguson brings his
[45:38] scriptures out of 2 Corinthians 51
[45:41] 17 and Corinthians 15:
[45:45] 21-23 and then brother Fay brings his
[45:49] scriptures out of Luke 17 same scripture
[45:51] that Paul brings and then Revelations 10
[45:55] 7 seven so those three messages if you
[45:58] have a time or actually if you're alive
[46:01] you have time so I want you to take the
[46:05] time to get into those messages statue
[46:09] of a perfect man Blasphemous names
[46:12] you'll see that in the blasphemia names
[46:16] that the reason why brother bam opens it
[46:19] up even further is because a sister has
[46:22] a dream and she was worried whether she
[46:25] had the holy ghost or not very human
[46:28] very believer type issue we have
[46:32] Believers with that do I have it or not
[46:35] do I really have it I know I love the
[46:37] Lord I know I believe the word I try to
[46:39] do everything I could am I sealed am my
[46:42] place where am I and she had that she
[46:45] falls on her she falls asleep on her bed
[46:48] thinking that the Lord gives her a dream
[46:50] a beautiful dream and sees brother
[46:53] brandom with his sleeves rolled up the
[46:54] messenger of the age with his sleeves
[46:56] rolled up pouring water down a mountain
[47:00] and clear water and it's just flowing
[47:02] through and then sees that messenger
[47:05] take a bucket of honey and pour that
[47:07] through a rock box and just like a dream
[47:11] but a dream
[47:12] interpreted is thus sayeth the Lord
[47:15] that's what it is it's just like your
[47:17] Bible interpreted is the word of the
[47:20] Lord so I encourage you to go back to
[47:22] that we've all how many of us have heard
[47:24] that know what I'm talking about yeah to
[47:26] do us good to hear it again it just
[47:29] reminds us it sets us on course for what
[47:34] these brothers brought uh uh during the
[47:38] meetings and I was so happy with how the
[47:43] Saints really uh pulled together to feed
[47:47] the people and the host of people and
[47:49] all the things I mean the brothers are
[47:51] just so impressed with the church and
[47:53] the love and the um
[47:57] and the you know the way we work
[47:59] together to get things done and so we
[48:01] certainly appreciate that the songs the
[48:04] choir the musicians you know my wife and
[48:07] the organists and the different song
[48:09] leaders and the people that the kept
[48:12] things clean and straightened up I thank
[48:14] you for that I really appreciate it
[48:17] there's no way I I mean everyone had
[48:20] something to do it seemed like and then
[48:22] others were doing just kept going I
[48:25] really really thoroughly appreciate it
[48:28] could we have done it better sure could
[48:30] have delivered and could have been
[48:32] communicated some things a little bit
[48:35] more um Lord will help us we'll we'll
[48:39] get better at doing that but in the in
[48:42] the grand scheme of things the messages
[48:46] that were brought were
[48:48] absolutely exactly what I believe the
[48:51] Lord wanted us to
[48:52] hear and um I would V value that and go
[48:57] back and really glean from what the Lord
[48:59] said in those meetings and I believe uh
[49:03] you'll be blessed and strengthened by it
[49:06] amen
[49:08] so let's play this little portion of the
[49:11] tape it's about 15 minutes or so it's a
[49:14] message of Grace brother Brand's going
[49:15] to give this experience of seeing these
[49:18] three rainbows is paragraph 21 through
[49:22] 57 and then we'll bring our pray
[49:26] request to the Lord in praying
[49:30] amen amen God bless you last year as all
[49:35] of you know which is on print and also
[49:37] in testimony and in the tapes I was
[49:41] sitting at a place here in Indiana where
[49:44] the Lord God came down and spoke to me
[49:46] that my second Ministry that was ready
[49:49] to take place in the near
[49:52] future and there was spoken into
[49:54] existence Three Squirrels all of you
[49:57] know the story I'm
[49:58] sure somehow going up the road I why I
[50:02] let the rest of the boys off going
[50:03] hunting I I had a strange feeling to go
[50:07] to this place again it was before
[50:10] daylight
[50:11] raining I didn't even know whether they
[50:13] get to hunt or not but that I would get
[50:16] over in the field there hunting means to
[50:19] get along to yourself to
[50:24] pray and I
[50:26] stopped the car and got off and walked
[50:28] across the road and went over into the
[50:31] bush and just before it would have been
[50:34] daylight it's kind of gray
[50:36] Dawn I'd stopped and i' offered a little
[50:39] word of prayer as usual in telling
[50:41] father that just what I have need of to
[50:44] provide it I don't believe in wasting
[50:46] anything or destroying never shot a
[50:49] burden my life for a target practice or
[50:51] anything else what a hun I eat or give
[50:54] to someone that that does eat
[50:57] it I don't believe in wasting anything I
[51:00] don't believe in doing those things
[51:02] because it's not
[51:05] right then as I turned and started along
[51:08] a familiar little pathway by the side of
[51:11] a pasture that crossed over to an L
[51:13] shape in the woods
[51:15] and something strange took
[51:19] place all my experiences I've never had
[51:22] anything like
[51:24] that I looked at the top of the hill to
[51:28] my left from where I was standing and
[51:30] there're coming up out of a black the
[51:33] top of the hill came three
[51:37] rainbows and they were running some 30
[51:39] foot
[51:41] high first I looked and seen the light
[51:44] and I just turned back because I thought
[51:46] it might be the sun
[51:49] raising on the second thought it wasn't
[51:51] towards the sun it was towards the South
[51:53] and another thing it was smooth cloudy
[51:56] rain raining all over that was August
[51:59] the 25th last Friday morning and you
[52:01] know how it was
[52:03] raining and it's smooth clouds
[52:06] everywhere and I looked again and there
[52:09] it was growing taller and taller three
[52:13] rainbows I took off my
[52:16] hat I sat down my
[52:19] gun I started walking towards it with my
[52:21] hands
[52:23] up something is seem to tell me this is
[52:26] close
[52:28] enough I was going to sit down and take
[52:30] off my boots that I had on to see if I
[52:32] could walk a little closer but I got
[52:35] within a few yards of it and I seen the
[52:39] color of it misting like a
[52:42] fog moving
[52:44] around I Stood Still for a few moments
[52:47] just coming right out of the top of the
[52:49] little
[52:50] mountain and I watched as the three one
[52:53] to the right one to the left left and
[52:55] one in the center running down into one
[52:57] bow
[52:59] L every what it was was
[53:02] alive it was moving and making its
[53:05] motions and I stood there just as it was
[53:07] graying
[53:08] Dawn I turned and looked again and I
[53:11] screamed out oh
[53:12] God what would you have your servant
[53:15] know just then the spirit of the Lord
[53:19] came
[53:20] in and said Jesus of the New Testament
[53:24] is Jehovah of the
[53:26] old he only changed his mask from Spirit
[53:30] to
[53:33] man that was confirming of course my
[53:36] message of
[53:39] him letting me know as sure that these
[53:42] 31 years hasn't been in
[53:44] vain as I started to approach it began
[53:47] to go away went down into this bow like
[53:50] Affair and then
[53:52] disappeared I walked up close I was
[53:54] afraid to go any close closer because
[53:56] he' stopped me before I got
[53:58] there I turned and notice that that
[54:02] light the way it was shining for me was
[54:04] just exactly in line with the tree where
[54:06] I sat last year where the squirrels
[54:09] appeared some 35 or 40 minutes later I
[54:13] went down through the woods and over the
[54:16] creek bottoms and so forth to I got to
[54:18] this tree that separates in four
[54:21] directions east north west and south
[54:23] four prongs of the tree running out and
[54:26] I climb into this prong and sit down
[54:28] where I was when he told me of that
[54:30] scripture if you say to this mountain be
[54:34] moveu and as I stood there a little bit
[54:37] not thinking yet of the rainbow it had
[54:40] left my
[54:41] mind I stood there and this has been a
[54:44] very bad year for squirrel hunting
[54:47] everything is late no
[54:50] squirrels I thought right here is where
[54:52] God gave
[54:54] me them squirrels last year to speaking
[54:57] to
[54:58] existence I took off my hat
[55:01] again and I said Lord
[55:05] God you are still the same
[55:09] Jesus you are still
[55:13] God and something said to me how many do
[55:16] you need this
[55:19] time I said just as I did the other time
[55:22] the
[55:24] limit
[55:26] and then I said I shall have this limit
[55:28] before 10:00
[55:30] today and strange as it seem just then I
[55:34] was in a very
[55:36] bad mosquito area where it was invested
[55:40] with mosquitoes and kind of swamp land a
[55:43] great big mosquito came to bite me right
[55:46] by the eye and I said not one of them
[55:48] will bother me this day no repellent or
[55:52] anything with
[55:53] me and before I knew it I said the sun
[55:56] will shine within 30
[55:58] minutes and no more than i' said that
[56:01] till just behind
[56:03] me a squirrel exactly like that in last
[56:07] year young red jumped out on a limb
[56:09] about 70 yards away and began
[56:12] barking I turned around at those long
[56:15] distance I could barely through the
[56:17] powerful scope see his eye just shocked
[56:21] that's all I didn't even have aim at no
[56:23] more than over the squirrel and the
[56:25] bullet was just exactly smacked with the
[56:28] eye where it was the other
[56:30] time on down through the woods I went
[56:32] and at
[56:34] exactly 3
[56:36] minutes of 10:00 I shot my third
[56:40] squirrel just it like it was last year
[56:42] just exactly the same at 3 minutes
[56:44] before
[56:46] 10 God being my solom judge not one
[56:50] mosquito even Buzz all day long right
[56:53] where there just tons of them I suppose
[56:55] if they could be weighed out and I never
[56:58] even seen or heard one I was listening
[57:01] for them to see if I could and I heard a
[57:03] huming I thought there's one somewhere
[57:05] and I listened and it was a truck way
[57:07] back on the
[57:08] highway and exactly 30 minutes from that
[57:11] time the sun Shone out good and
[57:15] bright and I came back to the
[57:18] place and I've been thinking when I said
[57:21] limit that meant five squirrels which is
[57:24] the limit in
[57:26] Indiana but I remember last year when he
[57:28] asked me how many did it take for me a
[57:30] mess I said three and I just got the
[57:34] three so yesterday I went back was going
[57:36] to the same place again and something
[57:38] said do not go across the
[57:41] road and at
[57:43] exactly 10:00 on the exact dot 10:00
[57:48] with my watch I shot the Indiana limit
[57:51] the fifth squirrel amen I want want you
[57:54] to notice there was three
[57:58] rainbows and there was three things said
[58:02] Three Squirrels
[58:03] gotten there was three things Three
[58:06] Squirrels by 10:00 no mosquitoes the sun
[58:09] would shine in 30
[58:11] minutes and
[58:13] U there were three to give witness of it
[58:17] brother Banks Woods my son Billy Paul
[58:22] and his son David to give Witness to it
[58:26] when I seen them
[58:28] rainbows about as wide across as that
[58:31] Halo is that angel of the Lord but there
[58:34] were three of them running into
[58:38] one oh how it help my
[58:42] heart to know that
[58:47] God Jesus is not just a
[58:50] man as people think he
[58:53] is just a prophet as this modern idea
[58:58] today thinks that Jesus is just a
[59:01] prophet he's Jehovah of the Old
[59:05] Testament made flesh and dwelt among us
[59:09] hallelujah there that sure did comfort
[59:13] me then thinking on that subject that
[59:17] God had s so many people now there is a
[59:20] group of people call themselves The
[59:22] Oneness or the Jesus only I don't agree
[59:25] with them upon their
[59:27] Theory neither do I agree agree with
[59:29] that trinitarian group that says that
[59:32] there are three different gods the
[59:34] extreme of the
[59:35] trinitarian but I believe that the three
[59:39] Father Son and Holy Ghost is one that
[59:43] there are three offices of one God he
[59:45] lived in the fatherhood in the pillar of
[59:48] fire he lived in the sunship in Jesus
[59:51] Christ and he lives now in the Holy
[59:53] Ghost in his church
[59:55] the same Lord Jesus that was made flesh
[59:58] and dwell Among Us is with us this day
[1:00:01] amen Among Us in the form of the Holy
[1:00:05] Spirit Hall of all the experiences not
[1:00:09] turned first and SE thinking first it
[1:00:12] could be the sun peep through a cloud
[1:00:15] somewhere but it was before the sun time
[1:00:18] that when I turned back again and seen
[1:00:19] it wasn't a light it was
[1:00:22] rainbows and then when I looked and seen
[1:00:24] that I become numb all over just someone
[1:00:28] said to me did not you feel like
[1:00:31] shouting no I didn't feel like shouting
[1:00:35] those experiences never make you feel
[1:00:37] like
[1:00:37] shouting they just make you feel
[1:00:40] anchored just where that you know that
[1:00:44] there's something that tells
[1:00:46] you just a satisfied feeling now those
[1:00:50] things are truth I know we have things
[1:00:54] that say said that many times some
[1:00:55] people say I don't believe in such stuff
[1:00:57] as that I can't voucher for that I don't
[1:00:59] know I can only voucher for what I know
[1:01:02] to be the truth and God Almighty who
[1:01:05] wrote this Bible and I am his servant he
[1:01:09] knows that that is the
[1:01:12] truth think of it that the day that we
[1:01:14] are living
[1:01:16] in just before the coming of the Lord
[1:01:20] Jesus said there will be signs in the
[1:01:22] skies and in the Earth
[1:01:26] great sights flying saucers missiles
[1:01:29] perplex of time distress between the
[1:01:32] Nations and fearful sights upon the
[1:01:35] Earth and we're living in that day to
[1:01:38] see those things now for the message
[1:01:43] this morning I have chosen I want you to
[1:01:45] turn with me in the scriptures over to
[1:01:49] Zachariah it was my Zachariah the the
[1:01:53] fourth chapter I is my desire to tell
[1:01:56] you these things many times things
[1:01:59] happen that I don't U don't speak it
[1:02:03] don't say it but this was too
[1:02:06] outstanding for me to keep it from the
[1:02:08] church amen it must be
[1:02:12] told and before God who I stand it's the
[1:02:16] truth
[1:02:19] hallelujah I know that there is a
[1:02:23] God I know that Jesus Christ is the Son
[1:02:27] of God
[1:02:29] Emmanuel dwelling amongst his people
[1:02:31] today in the form of the Holy
[1:02:35] Spirit and I know that the coming of the
[1:02:37] Lord is drawing
[1:02:39] nigh when signs and wonders are
[1:02:42] appearing we just got through the seven
[1:02:45] Church ages and learning that we're in
[1:02:47] the last and Lady of seean church age
[1:02:49] when the church is be indifferent get
[1:02:51] cold
[1:02:52] denominate be organized organizations
[1:02:55] would take it over eat it
[1:02:57] up but a promise that there'd be a
[1:03:00] little Remnant left there would be a
[1:03:03] church it would be scattered abroad
[1:03:04] everywhere but God would gather it
[1:03:06] together and Rapture it into glory amen
[1:03:09] a little Sanctified group somewhere
[1:03:12] waiting on the
[1:03:14] Lord then the other day when I got
[1:03:16] Daniel 70 weeks standing right here in
[1:03:19] the pull pit something struck me I've
[1:03:22] never been able to get away from it
[1:03:24] to see the hour that we're living in I
[1:03:27] want to go somewhere and do something
[1:03:29] else keep it off my mind I got too many
[1:03:31] loved ones that's
[1:03:33] unsaved knowing what can I do to get
[1:03:36] them saved what Israel I can do I have
[1:03:40] preach the
[1:03:41] gospel God has done great signs and
[1:03:44] wonders like he's never done since the
[1:03:45] world since the days of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:48] as he never did it in all the history of
[1:03:51] time and around the world it's went and
[1:03:54] still the world continually gets
[1:03:57] worse but then I have to remember that
[1:03:59] we're living in the lady oan Church age
[1:04:02] where they will get worse and it said
[1:04:05] they
[1:04:06] would then I chose this morning Ben that
[1:04:09] that message was so attacked and another
[1:04:12] thing that I'm so gotten after about is
[1:04:15] preaching
[1:04:17] Grace I want to speak on that this
[1:04:19] morning as I read the fourth chapter of
[1:04:23] Zechariah a portion of it and the angel
[1:04:26] that talked with me came again and
[1:04:29] wakened me as a man that is waken out of
[1:04:32] sleep and he said unto me what seest
[1:04:35] thou and I said I have looked and behold
[1:04:39] a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl
[1:04:42] upon the top of it and his seven lamps
[1:04:46] there on and seven pipes to the seven
[1:04:48] lamps which are upon the top thereof and
[1:04:52] two olive trees by
[1:04:55] one upon the right side of the bow and
[1:04:57] the other upon the left side thereof so
[1:05:00] I answered and spake to the angel that
[1:05:02] talked with me saying what are these my
[1:05:05] Lord and the angel that talked with me
[1:05:09] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[1:05:12] not what these be and I said no my Lord
[1:05:17] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:05:20] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:05:23] zer able saying not by might nor by
[1:05:28] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[1:05:30] of
[1:05:32] host do you see the message will not
[1:05:34] come by some great mights or Powers but
[1:05:37] by the spirit of God last verse seventh
[1:05:40] verse who art thou oh great Mountain
[1:05:44] before
[1:05:46] zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[1:05:48] plain and he shall bring forth The
[1:05:51] Headstone thereof with shouting crying
[1:05:55] Grace Grace unto
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:00] Grace Grace unto
[1:06:06] it we are all acquainted with this
[1:06:08] scripture that reads the
[1:06:10] Bible we know that this was during the
[1:06:15] time of the preparation of the
[1:06:17] restoration of the
[1:06:20] temple and zerubabel was a great Prince
[1:06:24] amongst the
[1:06:25] people who had laid the foundation of
[1:06:28] the
[1:06:30] building now you want you to put on your
[1:06:33] spiritual
[1:06:35] thinking anointing jacket this morning
[1:06:38] as we
[1:06:39] think and this great
[1:06:42] Prince had determined to rebuild the
[1:06:46] house of the
[1:06:50] Lord and then when he did he had laid
[1:06:53] the foundation Stone and as we read on
[1:06:56] farther we find out that God said
[1:06:59] zerubabel has laid the foundation with
[1:07:01] his hands he all so shall bring forth
[1:07:04] The Headstone
[1:07:07] amen I want you to
[1:07:09] notice he never said he shall bring
[1:07:12] forth the
[1:07:15] Cornerstone he shall bring forth The
[1:07:19] Headstone and we know that the scripture
[1:07:22] says that Jesus is the ch
[1:07:25] Cornerstone and he's also the
[1:07:30] headstone now if we will think for a few
[1:07:34] minutes that the seventh Church
[1:07:37] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:07:40] the children back to the fathers in
[1:07:43] other words rebuild the church again
[1:07:46] under the power of the spirit Hallelujah
[1:07:49] not by power not by might but by my
[1:07:52] spirit sayeth the Lord Lord not by
[1:07:55] organization not the denomination but by
[1:07:58] the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the
[1:08:00] church in the last
[1:08:03] days zerubabel the prince with Joshua
[1:08:08] was the one that was to bring forth this
[1:08:10] headstone he had laid the foundation he
[1:08:13] had tuck the people back to the
[1:08:14] foundation in tight which we all know
[1:08:17] that these candlesticks and so forth
[1:08:19] represented both Jewish and church they
[1:08:22] were Olive branches the ible said here
[1:08:25] and the Olive Branch we are the wild
[1:08:27] branch that was grafted into the root of
[1:08:30] the Ted Olive Tree gentille and out of
[1:08:33] these two branches come sensor pipes
[1:08:35] going into the seven golden candlesticks
[1:08:37] to give light to the seven Church
[1:08:41] ages now remember in our teaching on the
[1:08:44] lessons that we just been through that
[1:08:47] we T the Great Pyramid and studied that
[1:08:49] for a while that Enoch must have
[1:08:52] buil and The Headstone was never put in
[1:08:55] the pyramid I've been there the
[1:08:58] architectur of it could never be
[1:09:00] replaced to this day we have no machines
[1:09:02] that could build a pyramid no powers
[1:09:05] less the atomic power that could build a
[1:09:08] pyramid because it's too gigantic stone
[1:09:12] that will weigh tons and tons and tons
[1:09:15] stands way in the air so put together
[1:09:18] that even a thin razor blade cannot and
[1:09:20] they're not cemented they're just cut so
[1:09:23] that they Join one with another that's
[1:09:26] the way the body of Jesus Christ should
[1:09:28] be so cut by the Holy Spirit but God's
[1:09:32] Great instrument and tool that we be
[1:09:35] joined as one person we are not
[1:09:39] divided we should be one
[1:09:43] person and it goes to show that no
[1:09:45] Machinery can do that that way it takes
[1:09:48] God to do that no mechanics of
[1:09:51] organization no lodges none of these
[1:09:54] things can ever do it as good as their
[1:09:56] intentions are they can never do it
[1:09:58] because that it takes God to do this the
[1:10:01] Holy
[1:10:02] Spirit I don't think I have a dollar
[1:10:05] bill in my
[1:10:06] pocket but there is yes I do I have a
[1:10:10] dollar bill I'm sorry on the back of
[1:10:13] this dollar bill you'll see the Seal of
[1:10:15] the United States on the left
[1:10:18] side looking towards you from me it be
[1:10:21] on the left side yours it's right it's
[1:10:23] the
[1:10:24] eagle and also in there the coat of arms
[1:10:27] and so forth but on this side here right
[1:10:31] side to me you see the
[1:10:35] pyramid and you notice above the pyramid
[1:10:38] is the
[1:10:40] Capstone and beneath there says the
[1:10:42] Great
[1:10:44] Seal even on our
[1:10:47] currency that we have to recognize no
[1:10:50] Infidel can stamp out Christianity
[1:10:54] every letter that you date dates the
[1:10:57] birth of our Lord every calendar
[1:11:00] everything speaks
[1:11:02] of even on our curreny The Headstone
[1:11:05] which is
[1:11:07] Christ why did not they put the
[1:11:09] headstone on the pyramid because the
[1:11:11] headstone was rejected when he
[1:11:13] come but now according to the prophecy
[1:11:18] there will come The
[1:11:21] Headstone I want you to notice
[1:11:24] that when The Headstone comes the prince
[1:11:27] that's going to cry out the message will
[1:11:29] cry Grace
[1:11:31] Grace Hallelujah for it's by grace are
[1:11:34] we
[1:11:35] saved that not of Works lest any man
[1:11:38] should boast Hallelujah and the message
[1:11:40] of Grace has been trapped under the feet
[1:11:43] of man until it's become a
[1:11:45] disgrace some of them runs out into
[1:11:47] eternal security some runs out into
[1:11:50] everything but the true message of Grace
[1:11:53] Remains the Same and there where Satan
[1:11:55] tries to knock it out from the church
[1:11:58] but it's the grace of God that we're all
[1:12:00] saved
[1:12:01] by so in the deity of Jesus Christ if
[1:12:06] the Lord God could come there and
[1:12:07] confirm that that is the truth not only
[1:12:10] that but by his word he confirms it the
[1:12:12] truth and by signs and wonders he
[1:12:15] confirms it the
[1:12:17] truth then all so Grace is the
[1:12:22] truth then why could anyone
[1:12:25] criticize and say that
[1:12:27] Grace is wrong that we're saved by works
[1:12:32] we are saved by
[1:12:34] grace that through faith not by works
[1:12:39] works shows that you have been saved but
[1:12:42] what saves you is the grace of God grace
[1:12:46] saves you Grace is what God does for you
[1:12:50] works is what you do for God to show
[1:12:52] appreciation of what God did for you but
[1:12:56] by grace are you
[1:13:08] saved amen thank God for his word amen
