[27:52] richly amen I had a little place in the
[27:54] scripture I like to read in Hebrews
[27:58] chapter
[27:59] 5 I we'll just take um a few moments on
[28:02] that little message
[28:04] no uh no mortar between
[28:07] us in Hebrews chapter 5 the Apostle
[28:13] Paul in verse number 11 take a scripture
[28:17] reading
[28:18] there we've been in the Statue of a
[28:20] perfect man and blasphemous names and
[28:23] those messages and we trust that the
[28:26] Lord will bless us even further here
[28:30] tonight of whom we have many things to
[28:32] say and hard to be uttered see in year
[28:36] dull of hearing for when for the time
[28:40] you ought to be teachers you have need
[28:42] that one teach you again which be the
[28:45] first principles of the Oracles of God
[28:48] and are become such as have need of milk
[28:52] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[28:55] useth milk is UN skillful in the word of
[28:59] righteousness for he is a babe but
[29:02] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[29:05] full age even those who by reason of use
[29:09] have their senses exercised to discern
[29:13] both good and evil amen take one more
[29:17] scripture in 1 Corinthians chapter
[29:22] 12 and that
[29:26] is talking on the body of
[29:32] Christ gets into the gifts there chapter
[29:35] 13 chapter 14 and chapter 15 1
[29:39] Corinthians chapter 12 let's see what
[29:41] verse we wanted to
[29:44] take in
[29:46] verse
[29:51] number we'll take number 18 but now hath
[29:55] God set the members every one of them in
[29:58] the body as it ha pleased him and if
[30:02] they were all one member where were the
[30:04] body but now are they many members yet
[30:08] but one body and the eye cannot say unto
[30:11] the hand I have no need of thee nor
[30:15] again the head to the feet I have no
[30:17] need of you nay much more those members
[30:20] of the body which seem to be more feeble
[30:23] are necessary and those members of the
[30:26] body which we think to be less honorable
[30:30] upon these we bestow more abundant honor
[30:33] and our uncommonly parts have more
[30:36] abundant
[30:37] cess for our cly Parts have no need but
[30:41] God ha tempered the body together having
[30:45] giv more abundant honor to that part
[30:48] which
[30:49] lackthe no Schism in the body but that
[30:54] the members should have the same Care
[30:56] One for
[30:58] another amen we thank God for the
[31:01] reading of his word you may be seated
[31:03] God bless you I wanted to just touch a
[31:07] little bit before we go to our prayer
[31:08] meeting in the stature of a perfect
[31:12] man and on this word Schism in the body
[31:17] that word Schism means a split or a gap
[31:20] that there be no division there be no
[31:23] Gap there'll be no split in the body and
[31:27] we were sharing with the church on
[31:30] Sunday that as we become one with the
[31:32] word one with Christ that there is no
[31:36] mortar in between those great stones
[31:39] that make up the pyramid brother bam
[31:42] tells us that the Great Pyramid which we
[31:44] believe was built by Enoch those tons
[31:46] and tons of great massive Stones were
[31:50] placed together without a mortar joint a
[31:54] razor blade can't even get between there
[31:57] he said and that's how God builds things
[32:01] he takes the leaks out he seals it and
[32:04] it's a finished work and that's what
[32:06] we're we're achieving we're trying to
[32:08] achieve that in our life but in the
[32:10] Statue of a perfect man uh brother
[32:13] vandom says this here and I read it for
[32:16] you I think last time but paragraph
[32:18] number 4:12 is at the end of the message
[32:21] towards the end he
[32:23] said see it's true don't let it Escape
[32:27] you hold on to it children hold on to
[32:31] that remember build upon your faith
[32:34] virtue knowledge patience now here I
[32:37] think I had a piece of paper here if I
[32:39] haven't dropped it somewhere when I was
[32:41] preaching right here it is thank you
[32:43] brother thank you very much if you want
[32:45] to look on it and see there's something
[32:47] here that you might be able maybe it's a
[32:49] little better pattern than it is there
[32:52] that you might be able to
[32:54] copy uh C copy uh this off I'll just
[32:58] tack it up here and you can sure look at
[33:01] it and type it off here here's what he
[33:03] says and I want you to take it and study
[33:06] it and compare it and then act upon it
[33:10] okay don't just study it compare it but
[33:14] act upon it when you do take it
[33:17] sincerely to yourself don't say well I
[33:20] enjoy listening at it I did too but to
[33:23] listen at it and then receiving it is
[33:25] different see is different see so
[33:29] brother Ram goes on and he tells us not
[33:33] to just study it but to study it and
[33:35] compare it and then as we compare it we
[33:38] act upon it and let me ask you a
[33:40] question the people that heard this for
[33:43] the first time in the Tabernacle when he
[33:45] preached it them studying it then and US
[33:49] studying it today do we have more
[33:52] resources today than they did yes sir we
[33:56] absolutely did did he we can take these
[33:59] two messages and put them side by side
[34:02] uh statue of a perfect man and
[34:04] blasphemist names and compare them back
[34:06] and forth flip one page to the next page
[34:10] the people that heard this study it um
[34:14] the requirement for their study I would
[34:17] say be a little bit different than our
[34:19] requirement
[34:20] today we have been given the message the
[34:23] word in a very comprehensive way that we
[34:27] can study it is that
[34:30] right no other age no other people that
[34:33] followed the message was ever this close
[34:36] to the coming of the Lord amen no other
[34:39] people had the technology that we have
[34:42] today and the access to the message like
[34:45] any other so I if if we were to say you
[34:48] know back then well I studied it brother
[34:50] bandam I just got a few scriptures and I
[34:53] couldn't afford that tape when it first
[34:55] came out it took a month or so for me to
[34:57] get it and then maybe you know I was
[34:59] building up my library then finally I
[35:01] got blasphemia names and then I finally
[35:04] understood what you were saying and I
[35:06] mean it's years of catching up just
[35:08] right there so for them to study it and
[35:12] compare it he still admonished him to do
[35:14] it what about you and I I don't think
[35:17] the message was there just for us to
[35:20] hear it and not study it to study it and
[35:24] not compare it because that's exactly
[35:26] the opposite what he told us to do he
[35:28] said to study it and compare it and then
[35:32] act upon it of course he's just talking
[35:34] to the preachers right he's just talking
[35:36] to the Sanctified folks right the ones
[35:39] that was born in it right no he's
[35:41] talking to everybody who's listening to
[35:43] it yes sir now if you're not studying it
[35:46] that's on you if you're not comparing it
[35:49] that's a you problem if you're not
[35:51] acting upon it you can't say God didn't
[35:53] tell you because he did tell us and he
[35:57] given us the resources to do it by
[36:00] that's we know that this age that we're
[36:02] living in we're coming up through um the
[36:06] justification sanctification and the
[36:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost so let's go
[36:12] into spiritual food in due season in
[36:14] paragraph number 66 brother bam makes
[36:17] this statement here we find out that
[36:20] when a man comes sent from God ordained
[36:23] of God with the true thus sayeth the
[36:26] Lord the message and the messenger are
[36:29] one and the same because he he is sent
[36:33] to represent thus sayith the Lord word
[36:36] by word so he and his message is the
[36:41] same a denominational man under
[36:43] denominational opes he in the church is
[36:46] one a theologian under theology May by
[36:49] some denomination he and his message are
[36:52] one Church of Theology of Theologian is
[36:56] correctly then when a man comes with
[36:58] thus sayith the Lord he in the message
[37:01] is one can you say praise the Lord
[37:05] praise the Lord let's drop down to
[37:07] paragraph number
[37:10] 70 to number 91 paragraph 91 now he says
[37:15] it again the same message now we find
[37:17] out that Elijah could say that because
[37:19] the message of the hour and the word of
[37:22] God the messenger the message
[37:27] the message and the Word was exactly the
[37:30] same thing the prophet the word the
[37:35] message messenger message and message
[37:39] was the
[37:41] same Jesus said if I do not the works
[37:44] written of me then don't believe me
[37:46] that's good any man in his message is
[37:50] one that's why today that they do not
[37:53] believe in doing the works of God
[37:55] because they do not accept the message
[37:58] of God they don't believe the message
[38:03] but those who believe God's hour that
[38:05] we're living in these things are hidden
[38:08] food yes sir just think God has so hid
[38:12] it that they look right at it don't see
[38:15] it the same way Elijah blinded the
[38:17] Syrian Army the same way that God blinds
[38:20] the unbeliever from the true Genuine
[38:22] Food of the child the believer but the
[38:25] random Contin in paragraph number
[38:29] 1 uh 26 the same message we notice here
[38:34] again if the word is in us and has come
[38:37] to us as it did Elijah in that day it'll
[38:40] do the same thing that he did he would
[38:42] feed on the secret things of God which
[38:45] is hid from the world oh again it makes
[38:49] the message and the messenger as one the
[38:54] spiritual food is ready it's in the the
[38:56] season now and each one of you can have
[38:59] this food if you wish it amen if you are
[39:03] willing to steal away from all of the
[39:06] unbelief of this hour if you are ready
[39:09] to come into Christ and come into his
[39:11] promise and remember his promise in
[39:14] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 St John 14:12 and
[39:19] how many more scriptures telling us Joel
[39:21] 22 238 and all that he would do 228
[39:25] rather that he would do in these last
[39:30] days and how that the prophet said it
[39:33] would be like light in the last days and
[39:35] how it would work what it would do all
[39:37] the scriptures pointing to this last
[39:40] days and that is Christ if you can hide
[39:43] away in that now in that secret place
[39:46] you can eat and see the goodness and the
[39:49] mercy of God if you're sick there is
[39:52] healing there praise the Lord now
[39:56] that's that's that's very clear brother
[39:59] random says it all throughout that
[40:01] message that the message and the
[40:03] messenger are the same there's an
[40:06] element today that wants to separate
[40:08] that they want to separate the message
[40:11] from the messenger because we don't want
[40:13] to find ourselves following a man and we
[40:16] don't want you find ourselves you know
[40:18] we got to follow the message elzer came
[40:22] now put him to the side and follow Isaac
[40:24] you hear that said all the time
[40:27] but you can't separate the message and
[40:28] the messenger you can't separate him
[40:31] preaching in the pulpit and when he's
[40:33] out hunting in
[40:35] Colorado or in the great state of
[40:37] Arizona there's a whole bunch of great
[40:40] great tremendous nuggets you have to
[40:42] erase if you take out all the hunting
[40:44] trips it wasn't just him preaching
[40:46] behind a pull pit his very life that he
[40:50] lived the way God expressed and used the
[40:53] vessel for our day make him the message
[40:58] and the messenger the same one and the
[41:01] same amen we'll get into something here
[41:03] in just a moment the message
[41:06] leadership brother brandom says this in
[41:08] paragraph number
[41:12] 56 uh paragraph number 57 I'll take that
[41:16] your teacher can give you an education
[41:19] she can teach you you have to learn it
[41:22] your mother can teach you to walk you
[41:24] have to learn to walk
[41:27] your father can teach you how to be a
[41:28] businessman or what you have to learn
[41:31] that but only Jesus can give you eternal
[41:34] life see your priest your leader and so
[41:38] forth can teach you your religion you
[41:41] can learn the message that we are trying
[41:44] to teach but still that won't give you
[41:47] eternal life you've got to accept the
[41:51] person Jesus Christ you understand that
[41:54] all of you got to accept the person
[41:57] Jesus Christ to have eternal life amen
[42:01] but sometimes other leadership gets so
[42:03] much influence on us till we don't know
[42:06] what to do then when that time comes so
[42:11] the
[42:12] teacher but you have to learn your mom
[42:15] can teach you but you have to learn and
[42:18] you can try to learn the message and you
[42:19] can read a quote or read the scriptures
[42:22] but until the scriptures become one to
[42:24] you the Holy Spirit has to teach that to
[42:28] you and this is the the hour that we're
[42:31] living in it's bringing us up to a place
[42:34] now I want to take that I'm going to
[42:37] deal with that scripture in Hebrews 5
[42:38] and I'll get back to this that we read
[42:41] and and brother brandom is talking about
[42:44] in Hebrews chapter 5 number six and he
[42:47] says this about the scripture that we
[42:50] read you know I know some people are
[42:52] maybe uh shy when it comes to teaching
[42:54] you think of sitting behind behind a
[42:56] desk you think of hours and hours of
[42:59] study but you know uh the Bible says to
[43:02] study the word of God David said that he
[43:06] hid the word into his heart so he
[43:09] wouldn't sin against God he read the
[43:12] word he he he he he fed on the word so
[43:16] he can become one with that word here's
[43:19] what brother vam says about that
[43:21] scripture in Hebrews chapter 5
[43:24] paragraph 40 nine we're going to start
[43:27] on this our regular study I read the
[43:29] rest for a moment the 11th verse of whom
[43:33] we have many things to say hard to be
[43:36] uttered seeing you are dull of hearing
[43:41] for when the time you ought to be
[43:42] teachers you have need that one teach
[43:45] you again which be the first principles
[43:48] of the Oracles of God and are become
[43:51] such as have need of milk instead of
[43:54] strong meat for everyone that uses milk
[43:57] is unskillful in the word of
[43:59] righteousness for he is a babe that's
[44:02] Hebrews 5:13 he's reading and I hope
[44:04] that the holy spirit is taking that
[44:07] right down in the bottom of you now for
[44:11] he that uses milk is unskillful in the
[44:13] word of righteousness for he's a baby
[44:17] you give a baby strong meat you kill it
[44:20] that's the reason so many people say ah
[44:23] I don't believe that and walk away still
[44:27] babies they just can't understand they
[44:31] can't grasp that truth it kills them
[44:36] Great Mighty things the church should
[44:38] know today but you couldn't teach it
[44:41] they they stumble over it they don't
[44:45] know what to do with it Paul speaking to
[44:48] the Hebrew group yet Scholars he is
[44:50] speaking to now Scholars well learned
[44:54] find out in a few moments very scholarly
[44:56] but the Deep spiritual mystery the
[44:59] church is still blinded to it he said
[45:02] when you ought to be teaching others
[45:05] you're still a
[45:06] babe oh I know there's many rise up and
[45:09] go out and say oh I don't need to go to
[45:11] church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost
[45:13] has come he's the teacher when you get
[45:15] that idea you're just wrong for why did
[45:18] the Holy Ghost set teachers in the
[45:20] church if he was going to be the teacher
[45:23] see they there are first apostles office
[45:26] teachers evangelist pastors the holy
[45:28] spirit sets teachers in the church so he
[45:31] could teach through that teacher and if
[45:34] it isn't according to the word God
[45:36] doesn't confirm it then it isn't the
[45:38] right kind of teaching it must compare
[45:40] with the entire Bible and be just alive
[45:44] today as it was then there's the real
[45:47] thing made
[45:50] manifest and so this teacher that wants
[45:55] to teach us the great the church should
[45:59] know the the they they can't grasp it
[46:03] the Great Mighty things the church
[46:05] should know today but you couldn't teach
[46:08] it but you know as we hear this word and
[46:12] we have access to the message and we see
[46:14] where the Prophet is actually giving us
[46:17] instruction to study the word and I
[46:20] believe that's for the youngest one to
[46:21] the oldest one and we don't all feed the
[46:24] same way but God is the one who does the
[46:27] teaching he is our Shepherd he's the one
[46:30] who's doing the leading and when you go
[46:33] to him you open up your word and you go
[46:35] to him it is his responsibility to open
[46:39] the word to you you can't make yourself
[46:42] see anything you you can't give anybody
[46:44] a revelation but he who opens the eyes
[46:48] he's able to give that understanding to
[46:52] the word that's needed did you know that
[46:55] the real problem of the age in
[46:57] Revelations chapter 3 was the big
[47:01] problem for the age was that they had it
[47:04] need of
[47:05] nothing they um they uh thought they
[47:08] were Rich they thought they had all but
[47:11] the counsel was I I counsel thee to buy
[47:16] gold that you'll be rich and I counsel
[47:20] thee to purchase garments that you won't
[47:23] be naked and then I C thee to anoint
[47:27] your eyes with what Isa so you can see
[47:32] and there's a blindness in this age it's
[47:35] very loose it's a very loose attitude
[47:39] it's it's in the organizations and in
[47:40] the denominations we kind of laugh at
[47:43] Catholic people some of us do that they
[47:45] don't know their Bible but they know
[47:47] Church they know what time mass is they
[47:50] know how to pray to Mary they know the
[47:52] rosary but they don't know their Bible
[47:54] and then you laugh at the Jehovah
[47:55] witnesses that they have a twisted Bible
[47:59] and then you know the type of version
[48:00] that they have and then we talk about
[48:01] the other groups remember there's only
[48:04] one holy book and that's the Holy Bible
[48:07] and we think of all those groups that
[48:08] are ignorant scripturally but think of
[48:10] it what about us today all right what
[48:13] does that lazy uh attitude get upon us
[48:16] today not to search it brother Brandon
[48:19] will tell us as we're listening to the
[48:21] tape you'll say now go home and take
[48:24] these scriptures and
[48:26] them and many of us act like he ain't
[48:28] even say it or he's talking to them on
[48:30] the tape no he's talking to you he's
[48:33] talking to me so when it's to study it
[48:37] and to compare it and to act upon it the
[48:41] holy spirit is the teacher that will
[48:44] accompany you when you're reading his
[48:47] word you don't have to be afraid of the
[48:49] seven seal you don't have to be afraid
[48:51] of any of the tapes any of the Mysteries
[48:54] it's God's word word you're his child
[48:58] Lord give me what I have need of it's
[49:01] his job to open up the word and it's our
[49:04] job to ask him
[49:07] amen yes sir it's a very loose
[49:11] attitude in study as it comes as it
[49:14] pertains to
[49:16] study you know the preacher get up or
[49:18] the prophet takes uh two hour sermon
[49:21] three- hour sermon with all the notes
[49:23] and all the comparison and we'll listen
[49:26] to that and not won't make one mental
[49:29] note one scriptural note no pen and
[49:31] paper no notes at all no study at
[49:35] all and I just think and I believe that
[49:38] we're going to be held
[49:40] accountable you know and I can see if
[49:42] you didn't have the tapes and you can
[49:44] say well I don't have the tapes when I
[49:47] came in the message it was $5,000 to buy
[49:50] the entire message that's what it cost
[49:52] and I had my own little library that I
[49:54] was building I didn't never get my own
[49:57] but then God by his grace and his Mercy
[49:59] we all got it now and here we have this
[50:02] command for us to study it what do you
[50:04] think God's not going to hold us
[50:07] accountable to that
[50:09] word when the equipment was there for us
[50:12] to have so let's go a little bit
[50:23] further so it's the unbelief of the hour
[50:25] and the last day word is bringing us up
[50:29] to this great Capstone let's take this
[50:33] message have not I sent thee brother
[50:35] bandam says this in
[50:37] 1962 why didn't that they never put a
[50:41] cap on the stone I've been there at that
[50:44] at the pyramid why didn't they put a cap
[50:47] on it because it was
[50:50] rejected that was the Cornerstone where
[50:52] all the other Stones was fit together it
[50:55] it was speaking of the church age look
[50:58] way down here at the Lutheran age way
[50:59] back in the majority back there just to
[51:01] confess Christ was my just means to be a
[51:05] Christian justification Along come
[51:07] Wesley sanctification a little narrower
[51:10] sanctification then Al come the
[51:12] Pentecost baptism of the Holy Ghost what
[51:14] is it shaping up justification
[51:18] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:21] now what's he doing that's got to be
[51:23] honed out so perfect that church brought
[51:27] into such a place that the stone that's
[51:30] coming to fit on top of it see what I
[51:33] mean that pictures the church and
[51:36] through it all is the church now that's
[51:39] just makes a parable I'm talking about
[51:41] don't try to go into it then the next
[51:44] Bible the real Bible is this this is our
[51:47] word just them signs and things had back
[51:50] there but notice how perfect that
[51:54] stone it was rejected they never did put
[51:58] it on why and if you go there them
[52:00] Stones up in uh up in that pyramid that
[52:04] weighs tons and tons that is so closely
[52:07] fit together you can't put a razor blade
[52:11] and no
[52:12] mortar it it's so perfectly honed
[52:15] together then if that had to be like
[52:18] that that to make each age fit together
[52:21] then what's it going to be when the
[52:24] coming don't don't you see the church
[52:26] shaping up Luther justification Wesley
[52:31] sanctification then come the Holy Ghost
[52:34] and now Church getting honed and fixed
[52:39] then without a spot or a wrinkle so him
[52:42] that had no spot or wrinkle can come
[52:45] down and connect it together for the
[52:48] resurrection for the Church of the
[52:50] Living God to take its flight into Glory
[52:53] see yes now we're living in in that day
[52:56] John was looking for that to come he
[52:59] said I'll know him he's out there I
[53:00] don't know where he he's standing out
[53:02] there maybe some Bishop walked up and
[53:05] and so brother Adam continues on he
[53:07] takes Blasphemous names in 1962
[53:11] paragraph number 72 and he says this
[53:15] here so we see that we are in no spot no
[53:20] wrinkle that's our
[53:23] requirement not even a blemish
[53:26] our age is the age of perfection Jesus
[53:29] said be ye therefore perfect even as our
[53:32] father and your father in Heaven is
[53:34] perfect that's an age requirement that's
[53:36] not for them back there that's for us
[53:39] here today and it's a very serious
[53:42] requirement and God's not going to wink
[53:44] at nothing because he's given us the
[53:46] tools to reach the stature of a perfect
[53:48] man he's been good to us hasn't he we
[53:52] know when we listen to the message we
[53:54] got a clear clean word our food is not
[53:58] contaminated we know that it's not a
[54:00] question at all but you know and God's
[54:03] been good to us and we don't realize how
[54:06] good it's been until we get something
[54:08] that's contaminated maybe but here
[54:11] brother vom he takes this have not I
[54:13] sent thee in Phoenix
[54:16] 1962 paragraph I'm sorry Blasphemous
[54:19] name sorry paragraph 72 Enoch completed
[54:23] in his day or back in that day the
[54:25] Pyramid of course we haven't got time to
[54:28] background and and show you how that
[54:29] that pyramid come up through the
[54:31] chambers and so forth it speaks right to
[54:33] the end time now I read this for you
[54:36] Sunday they're in the king's chamber now
[54:39] by the measurements but the headstone
[54:42] never was put on the pyramid and that
[54:44] sets perfect
[54:47] architecturally or masonry until even
[54:50] the little thin razor blade they don't
[54:53] know how they ever built it don't
[54:56] understand it could ever a razor blade
[54:59] slice along the sides where the mortar
[55:02] should be and there's no mortar in it
[55:06] it's just perfected put together so
[55:10] that's what it is when Christ and the
[55:12] church become one there's no mortar
[55:16] between there's nothing between just God
[55:19] and the person God Christ and the person
[55:25] now but the headstone you'' never found
[55:27] it and and and brother Adam continues on
[55:31] and this paragraph 75 he says notice the
[55:35] American dollar bill on the American
[55:37] dollar bill on one side the left side is
[55:39] the American seal and eagle with the
[55:42] Spears in his hand and on the second
[55:45] side this is called the Seal of the
[55:47] United States but on the next side is
[55:50] the pyramid and above it a great eye and
[55:53] under here it says the Great Seal why
[55:57] would it be the Great Seal in this
[55:59] nation even above the Seal of our nation
[56:02] see no matter what you ever do God makes
[56:06] it speak just the same see he makes the
[56:09] Sinners speak of it he makes the nation
[56:12] speak of it everything has to speak of
[56:15] him whether you want to believe it or
[56:17] not it's right there now notice there's
[56:20] a eye in that the eye of God and because
[56:25] that the cap didn't come off the head
[56:27] seal because it was rejected which was
[56:30] the Son of God the Cornerstone of the
[56:33] building the head seal of the pyramid
[56:36] all this now and brother brandom
[56:41] continues on so our money
[56:44] testifies it's on the dollar bill the
[56:47] founding fathers Founders the the
[56:50] designers of it they have the eagle and
[56:52] they have the pyramid and then they have
[56:54] the C happen they put an eye up there
[56:56] and it looks like oh that's a nice
[56:58] design that's kind of neat it's sharp
[57:01] beautiful they didn't know they working
[57:03] in the hands of God why because it
[57:06] showed that the the Capstone wasn't put
[57:08] on there why because it was
[57:11] rejected now it it's getting it's being
[57:14] rejected again
[57:15] today
[57:17] yes can I go a little bit
[57:20] further and
[57:23] now the Christ that they're
[57:26] rejecting not not the Hoffman head of
[57:29] Christ picture is this Christ this is
[57:32] the one they're rejecting this one right
[57:35] here yeah so they put him out of the
[57:38] church in Revelations chapter 3 and he's
[57:41] on the outside trying to get back into
[57:43] the church and that is repeated again in
[57:47] the rejection of the great headstone
[57:51] which is this message here what the
[57:54] prophet of God says here and why I'm
[57:56] against organized religion yes and
[57:58] you'll see why the church is try to cool
[58:00] away from brother brandom and his
[58:03] message they want to preach it they want
[58:05] to teach it but they want to leave the
[58:07] man part out of
[58:09] it but they are men themselves
[58:14] preaching yes sir can I go a little bit
[58:16] further here paragraph number 73 and why
[58:19] I'm against organized
[58:21] religion but what n Nicodemus had to
[58:24] learn to what many people today of the
[58:26] denomination of this day has to learn
[58:28] what Nicodemus ought to have know is
[58:30] what the people today ought to have know
[58:33] of these denomination he was more than a
[58:36] prophet he come to him to find to tell
[58:40] him which way to life and Jesus himself
[58:45] was life he that hath the son of has
[58:49] life so he didn't he must have come to
[58:52] try to learn to teach him mustn't come
[58:55] to try to learn a teach him he must come
[58:58] to accept the person that's what it is
[59:01] tonight the Chief Cornerstone is
[59:04] rejected
[59:05] again what is the Chief Cornerstone it's
[59:09] the word of course Christ is the word so
[59:13] here brother bam is telling us this is
[59:16] November of 62 this is the message after
[59:20] statue of a perfect man Blasphemous
[59:23] names and then why I'm against organized
[59:25] religion it's right in that same line so
[59:27] he's talking about The Headstone that
[59:29] was rejected and he said that it was
[59:31] rejected again so it's not just the
[59:34] rejection on the day of Pentecost
[59:36] they're rejecting The
[59:38] Headstone Ministry the message of the
[59:43] hour and they want us to feel ashamed to
[59:45] preach about it or talk about it we
[59:48] don't have nothing to be ashamed of this
[59:50] is what God showed us and revealed to us
[59:53] it it's your message message but it's
[59:55] got to be my message it's got to be
[59:58] personalized to me the prophet that
[1:00:01] coming this day it's my Prophet you can
[1:00:04] have him too but he's mine and I handle
[1:00:08] him like he is mine I believe him like
[1:00:11] he is mine and I hold on to his word
[1:00:14] like he is mine and the next man can do
[1:00:16] whatever he wants to do but when it's
[1:00:20] revealed to you that it's the word for
[1:00:22] the day you handle it as such am amen so
[1:00:27] we see that the
[1:00:28] rejection
[1:00:30] happens in this age
[1:00:34] again this message turn on the light oh
[1:00:38] let's take conferences just for a moment
[1:00:40] I have 10 more minutes or so the message
[1:00:43] conferences says this
[1:00:47] here paragraph number
[1:00:50] 255 God being infinite he cannot say
[1:00:53] well I was mistaken 2,000 years ago God
[1:00:57] is eternal he never did begin he never
[1:00:59] will end and the only way you can ever
[1:01:02] be like him is be part of him on the day
[1:01:06] of Pentecost that great Pillar of Fire
[1:01:09] that followed Israel or Israel had
[1:01:11] followed it through the Wilderness see
[1:01:13] the great Pillar of Fire was God the
[1:01:16] angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ Moses
[1:01:20] esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
[1:01:23] than the treasures in Egypt so he
[1:01:24] forsook Egypt and followed Christ notice
[1:01:27] on the day of Pentecost what did God do
[1:01:30] he taken that big Pillar of Fire and
[1:01:32] divided it that was himself tongues of
[1:01:35] fire fork tongues clothing tongues come
[1:01:38] down Fork it tongues set upon each one
[1:01:42] and oh when we ought to oh when we ought
[1:01:46] to be ashamed to let our organization
[1:01:48] divide us when God divided himself Among
[1:01:51] Us that we might be one amen this will
[1:01:55] all men know that you're my disciples do
[1:01:58] you hear that brother and sister God
[1:02:00] divided himself we are never divided one
[1:02:03] another because we're parts of
[1:02:06] God just let this fire come to this fire
[1:02:10] and after a while you'll find out it'll
[1:02:11] move that it's come through Luther
[1:02:15] Wesley Pentecost find out the pyramid
[1:02:18] will be capped one of these days you
[1:02:21] know it never was capped the pyramid on
[1:02:24] the back of your dollar the Great Seal
[1:02:26] it says and we America here is the
[1:02:29] American seal on this side but why did
[1:02:31] it say the Great Seal the one that Enoch
[1:02:35] made not pyramid doctrines now cuz I
[1:02:38] don't believe in that kind of stuff but
[1:02:39] they never did cap the pyramid why the
[1:02:43] Capstone was rejected but it will come
[1:02:46] again someday praise the
[1:02:49] Lord I hope it's coming to
[1:02:52] me I hope I get a visitation from the
[1:02:56] Capstone I hope the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:59] comes down in a greater measure to
[1:03:01] me because we represent that pyramid
[1:03:04] don't we Capstone was rejected but it
[1:03:07] will come again someday praise the Lord
[1:03:11] and see in that pyramid I've been there
[1:03:14] it's hon so close so even you can run a
[1:03:17] razor blade there's no mortar between it
[1:03:21] it's just perfectly set together like
[1:03:23] the same Stone and when that church gets
[1:03:26] honed into a perfect image of Jesus
[1:03:28] Christ he will come resurrect all the
[1:03:32] saints when he comes and take them with
[1:03:34] him the Church of the Living God will be
[1:03:38] caught up amen turn on the light
[1:03:42] 1964 he says this here in paragraph
[1:03:46] number 99 oh of loose Luther and Wesley
[1:03:49] and all of them can see that that
[1:03:51] yesterday's stuff can only be used as it
[1:03:55] goes through a process when the Holy
[1:03:58] Ghost reveals the light from
[1:04:00] justification to sanctification to the
[1:04:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and now the
[1:04:05] last hour of the coming of Christ is got
[1:04:09] in it the profile not of the queen but
[1:04:14] of the king of Heaven that represents
[1:04:17] himself as the church has has become
[1:04:21] closer into the minority like the
[1:04:24] Ministry has to be the same kind of
[1:04:26] ministry that he had what did he say
[1:04:30] there the church has to have the same
[1:04:32] Ministry that he had no flaws in him
[1:04:35] right he was anointed right he did the
[1:04:38] father's will right we got to have that
[1:04:40] same
[1:04:42] Ministry amen do we have an example for
[1:04:44] it yes we do like the ministry has to be
[1:04:47] the same kind of ministry that he had
[1:04:50] those who died in Luther's age down at
[1:04:52] the bottom of the pyramid like not a
[1:04:54] pyramid teaching but just for an example
[1:04:57] that pyramid is so perfect if any of you
[1:05:01] has been there you can't run a razor
[1:05:03] blade hardly they had no mortar in it
[1:05:07] and as far as we know the architect of
[1:05:10] it was so great now they lost The
[1:05:12] Headstone they don't know where it's at
[1:05:15] now when The Headstone returns it'll be
[1:05:18] just like the rest of it it will blend
[1:05:21] in with the stone that's left left open
[1:05:26] if you should put the headstone on it it
[1:05:28] have to be that way and when Jesus
[1:05:32] returns he'll find a church that's
[1:05:35] washed without spot or wrinkle it'll be
[1:05:39] the same Ministry he had it'll bring
[1:05:43] back The
[1:05:45] Headstone now praise the Lord that's a
[1:05:48] mighty statement there that when Jesus
[1:05:51] returns he's returning to a church
[1:05:55] that's not halfway ready a church that's
[1:05:59] not arguing with one another over some
[1:06:03] scripture over some you know little
[1:06:06] offense of a carnal matter some little
[1:06:10] thing that happened a year or two ago or
[1:06:12] something somebody looked at me sideways
[1:06:15] and somebody just off you did it the
[1:06:17] wrong way somebody out somebody and we
[1:06:20] just conflict after conflict after conf
[1:06:23] is that the church he coming back for
[1:06:26] was that the example that was set for us
[1:06:29] stop looking at church members and look
[1:06:31] at the headstone look at the sheep that
[1:06:34] was way before us like I said Sunday
[1:06:37] morning it's not about looking at other
[1:06:39] church members it's about me in my
[1:06:42] prayer closet looking at the word face
[1:06:46] to face and coming into that image you
[1:06:49] know
[1:06:50] um we might lose some things we might
[1:06:52] not have all things friends and and and
[1:06:56] things like that relations and we we
[1:06:58] might have to you know go the the extra
[1:07:01] mile and we might have to pay a better a
[1:07:04] bigger price but is it worth it to make
[1:07:07] Heaven your home I mean look come on
[1:07:11] there is no group of people that has
[1:07:13] ever been in our
[1:07:14] position no group of people ever been
[1:07:18] this close to the coming of the Lord no
[1:07:21] group of people saw the laws Chang
[1:07:24] overnight the churches change overnight
[1:07:27] and if the denominations are my example
[1:07:31] and we're using that for our example
[1:07:34] then God have mercy you should have
[1:07:36] stayed in that all right God never sent
[1:07:39] an organization or denomination to be
[1:07:41] our example how to lead worship how we
[1:07:44] should run our church and how we should
[1:07:46] build and how we should that
[1:07:48] denomination has never been our example
[1:07:50] but God sent us an example and that was
[1:07:54] his word
[1:07:55] amen it's high time it's lamp trimming
[1:07:58] time sir it's no mortar time it's no
[1:08:03] Schism no division in the body it's no
[1:08:07] leaven Among Us that's the hour that
[1:08:11] we're living in it's a very sober hour
[1:08:14] yes it it's a very serious hour and if
[1:08:18] you hear the word of the like I hear the
[1:08:20] word I don't know the the the prophet's
[1:08:23] message makes me want to go
[1:08:25] pray fall down on my knees and call out
[1:08:30] to God for more of this word that's been
[1:08:34] represented to
[1:08:36] us you know he's coming back for a
[1:08:38] church without
[1:08:40] spot without a
[1:08:43] blemish without a wrinkle can I finish
[1:08:47] this message and the message turn on the
[1:08:50] light here the prophet of God says here
[1:08:52] in paragraph 103 like my hand here in a
[1:08:55] shadow it's a shadow only it's darker as
[1:08:58] my hand becomes more it's negative here
[1:09:00] positive here as a negative and positive
[1:09:03] it gets denser darker darker darker and
[1:09:05] finally it claps together and negative
[1:09:10] and positive become one that's when
[1:09:14] church and Christ unites together as a
[1:09:18] bride with the same spirit that was in
[1:09:21] him will be upon her when the church
[1:09:24] comes from justification sanctification
[1:09:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost into the last
[1:09:29] days and honing her down now for the
[1:09:32] coming of the Lord oh don't be the rough
[1:09:36] part on it Pentecostal brother shine up
[1:09:40] with the word believe every bit of it
[1:09:43] don't get out into these isms and things
[1:09:45] who he talking
[1:09:47] to isms and things we have isms today oh
[1:09:51] yeah we have things yes can I tell you
[1:09:54] what some things
[1:09:55] are no it's Wednesday night I ain't
[1:09:57] going to mess with you isms and
[1:10:03] things somebody said get into
[1:10:06] it yeah we send these little messages
[1:10:10] back and forth you we don't have we
[1:10:13] don't have time to be arguing with
[1:10:15] nobody think about it you got time to
[1:10:18] argue with somebody about
[1:10:22] what we barely got enough time to pray
[1:10:27] right and to study
[1:10:30] it and to compare it and then act upon
[1:10:35] it it's not about studying it so you can
[1:10:38] preach it studying it so you can argue
[1:10:40] it study it so you can study it so you
[1:10:42] can act upon
[1:10:44] it because he's coming back for a church
[1:10:47] without spot blemish or wrinkle our
[1:10:50] requirement is different than their
[1:10:51] requirement they without us cannot be
[1:10:53] made perfect do you see what I mean it's
[1:10:57] Christ now taking the rags of yesterday
[1:11:00] the Lutheran the Methodist Presbyterian
[1:11:03] and so forth he's putting it through a
[1:11:05] process what kind of a process a process
[1:11:08] of the Holy Spirit what they had
[1:11:12] plus making it till he is pressing his
[1:11:16] own image when the church and Christ
[1:11:19] become one in Union God granted I trust
[1:11:23] you see it if you do see it reminds me
[1:11:26] of a story of great Welsh Revival was on
[1:11:29] some great men here in the nation
[1:11:31] throughout thought they would go over
[1:11:34] and see the Welsh Revival what would be
[1:11:35] taking place and as they went over to
[1:11:37] find out they see what building it was
[1:11:40] held in when they got to the whales they
[1:11:42] went around begin to ask about where the
[1:11:44] building was they seen a happy little
[1:11:47] officer standing on the corner with his
[1:11:49] little Tommy hat on was swinging his
[1:11:51] Club around around like that and so
[1:11:53] these men walked up to him and said sir
[1:11:56] could you tell me what building the
[1:11:58] Welsh Revival is held
[1:12:00] in he said yes sir I'm it I'm it why he
[1:12:07] was shedding forth the joy and the light
[1:12:11] of the Welsh Revival within him so ought
[1:12:15] the Church of Pentecost today asking who
[1:12:19] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:12:22] and forever his life of his gospel ought
[1:12:24] to be shining forth with the word of
[1:12:27] this age revealing Jesus Christ to the
[1:12:31] nation just like he was then he was so
[1:12:34] filled with the Welsh Revival till he
[1:12:36] was the Welsh Revival we ought to be so
[1:12:39] filled with Christ till we reflect him
[1:12:41] in the power of His word that's lotted
[1:12:45] to us this
[1:12:49] day Brethren don't be stooped in the
[1:12:51] things of the world sir don't these
[1:12:54] cares that take you away stay with the
[1:12:56] gospel watch every word don't go back to
[1:13:00] what some father said let's go right now
[1:13:03] what Jesus said was to take place in
[1:13:05] this day yes sir we're supposed to be
[1:13:08] the light of this age manifesting the
[1:13:10] gospel Luther was his light Wesley was
[1:13:13] his light Pentecost was his light but
[1:13:16] we're farther up the road now we're
[1:13:18] coming into the bride called out
[1:13:22] elected
[1:13:25] so remember this is the seventh Church
[1:13:28] age the lady oan Church age according to
[1:13:31] Revelations 3 they reject Christ of
[1:13:34] every Church age that was mentioned in
[1:13:36] the Bible the leot was the worst of all
[1:13:39] of them it turned him out rejected him
[1:13:41] put him on the outside do you see the
[1:13:43] Moon black out brother bam continues on
[1:13:47] so we have to become one with the word
[1:13:51] amen and when Christ returns s he'll be
[1:13:54] coming from back to a church that had no
[1:13:58] spot no blemish no wrinkle he'll be
[1:14:02] coming back to a church that is Jesus
[1:14:07] Christ repeated
[1:14:09] again let me take this last quote and
[1:14:12] God hiding himself in Simplicity and
[1:14:14] brother random says this my last quote
[1:14:18] here many people
[1:14:20] say if I were to live back there no
[1:14:24] you would have took the same
[1:14:27] attitude because today in the very same
[1:14:30] thing being reproduced again today only
[1:14:35] in another form they stumble over it
[1:14:38] today just like they did then no doubt
[1:14:42] in them days they had plenty of
[1:14:43] preachers but Noah was inspired of God
[1:14:47] and Noah could look out and see what was
[1:14:50] fixing to happen and know that an
[1:14:52] adulterous and Wicked generation like
[1:14:54] that that God would not let stand so
[1:14:57] what can we do today but see the same
[1:15:00] thing a modern Sodom and gomorah see
[1:15:04] Wicked adulterous people so Polished in
[1:15:08] scholarship that they stumble over the
[1:15:10] Simplicity of God's manifestation of his
[1:15:13] being his word showing his word there's
[1:15:17] not a person in the world that can say
[1:15:19] that Rosella that can say that we don't
[1:15:22] see with th the very word of God made
[1:15:24] manifest the very promise of the last
[1:15:27] days the very
[1:15:29] evening lights that was to shine we are
[1:15:32] privileged people amen thank the lord we
[1:15:36] know that it's later than we
[1:15:38] think and um this comes to my
[1:15:42] mind start thinking of our dear brother
[1:15:44] Billy Paul he had a dream one time I
[1:15:48] didn't give you this to you sis but
[1:15:49] let's see if I can find it here real
[1:15:51] quick where he was
[1:15:57] um and it shook him
[1:16:00] up and he went to his dad and he talked
[1:16:04] to him about it and he said that uh I
[1:16:06] was in my other other phone but he said
[1:16:10] that he
[1:16:11] had uh Fire coming out of his eyes how
[1:16:15] many remember
[1:16:17] that
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:22] um knowing them in the back they
[1:16:24] probably find it faster than
[1:16:26] me
[1:16:29] but there's a man that can turn on the
[1:16:31] light paragraph
[1:16:33] 138 and this just really just shook me
[1:16:37] how brother Adam dropped this dream in
[1:16:39] there on there how quickly things just
[1:16:42] and just really the the impression of
[1:16:45] the hour he says my son Billy Paul he
[1:16:48] talks in his sleep but he doesn't have
[1:16:50] dreams very often he had one the other
[1:16:53] night that shook him up said he dreamed
[1:16:55] he was in a church and I hadn't come in
[1:16:58] yet said when I come in fire was flying
[1:17:02] out of the eyes and I said the time is
[1:17:05] here it's over and everybody begin
[1:17:09] screaming I can't my children and even
[1:17:13] my wife said I can't get Sarah to ask
[1:17:15] the blessing at the table and so forth I
[1:17:18] said he said I got to go get Lois and
[1:17:20] the baby I said Lois can't come now now
[1:17:23] the baby is too young to know Billy the
[1:17:26] hour is here we must go I said it's
[1:17:31] midnight now before daylight Jesus will
[1:17:34] be here if it isn't then I'm a false
[1:17:38] witness of Christ and somebody spoke up
[1:17:40] and said no man knows the minute or the
[1:17:42] hour I never said minute or hour I said
[1:17:46] sometime between now and daylight and I
[1:17:49] said let's go I said but we're at the
[1:17:52] time let's go we got in the car and
[1:17:55] started we started up the mountain and
[1:17:57] when we did it was looked like the light
[1:18:00] was coming in the skies but dark upon
[1:18:03] the Earth he said I pulled off the side
[1:18:06] of the road held up my hands over like
[1:18:09] this fire still flying from the eyes and
[1:18:13] he said I said Lord I have did this at
[1:18:16] your command I have did this just
[1:18:18] because that you told me to do it this
[1:18:21] way I have did these things according to
[1:18:23] what you've told me and I motioned to a
[1:18:27] big Granite Mountain and a light without
[1:18:29] hands cut a stone out of the mountain
[1:18:33] weighing hundreds of tons and here it
[1:18:35] come I said turn your heads don't look
[1:18:38] it'll all be over just in a few minutes
[1:18:41] said then a great holy hush come
[1:18:43] everywhere as the stone come towards the
[1:18:47] place it may be later than we think
[1:18:50] there see that's exactly script RT see
[1:18:54] the stone without hands cut out of the
[1:18:56] mountain and so one of these days it's
[1:18:59] going to be that way when you're going
[1:19:02] to scream for something I said to them
[1:19:05] you've already had that time God has
[1:19:08] constantly warned you time after time
[1:19:12] yeah I said it's even if it's my own kid
[1:19:16] or whoever it is the hour is here I can
[1:19:20] only say what he's told me to say and
[1:19:23] it'll be there and it was then all of a
[1:19:26] sudden brother random claps his hand
[1:19:28] here we come the Storm come out of the
[1:19:31] mountain without hands Daniel saw that
[1:19:33] you know back many years ago Billy know
[1:19:35] nothing about that but it was a dream
[1:19:38] sent to him from the
[1:19:43] Lord you know what sobering about that
[1:19:47] is that it's then you want to get ready
[1:19:51] or let me pray now let me get
[1:19:54] consecrated he said you've already had
[1:19:56] that
[1:19:57] time the hour is
[1:20:00] now and so brothers and sisters that's
[1:20:03] you know this is my this is my vision
[1:20:06] this is my calling this is my
[1:20:09] destination is to be one with the word
[1:20:12] amen I want to shed everything off of me
[1:20:15] I don't care I'm wrong you want to argue
[1:20:17] with me okay I'm wrong you're right I
[1:20:19] don't care that's whoever is Right
[1:20:21] whoever is wrong I don't care I want to
[1:20:23] be right with the Lord I want to make
[1:20:25] the Rapture I wanted this great
[1:20:27] headstone and this ministry to seal out
[1:20:31] all the weaknesses all the leaven all of
[1:20:33] the mortar all of the
[1:20:36] insincerity and all of the looseness and
[1:20:40] I want my lamp
[1:20:42] trimmed and I believe God has given us
[1:20:46] yes he said to study he gave us
[1:20:48] something to study didn't he tremendous
[1:20:51] lifetime not home work but life work for
[1:20:55] the rest of your life God bless you
[1:20:57] trust the Lord will bless you and
[1:20:58] strengthen our hearts with those few
[1:21:02] words the musicians will come we like to
[1:21:05] take our prayer requests this young man
[1:21:08] that was shot he was a preacher
[1:21:10] preaching there in in in the Phoenix
[1:21:14] area brother Hans I believe his name is
[1:21:19] and he's in critical condition still I
[1:21:21] believe not sure if they made any arrest
[1:21:24] or
[1:21:25] not but you know we say well he wasn't
[1:21:28] in the message you think the shooter
[1:21:31] cared what message he was in he was
[1:21:34] preaching like I'm doing right
