[39:55] I have learned
[39:58] to depend upon his word.
[40:02] Now I thank God for the mountains.
[40:06] I thank God for the mountains
[40:10] and I thank him for the valley.
[40:14] I thank him for the storms he's brought
[40:18] me through.
[40:22] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[40:28] know that he could solve them. I never
[40:32] know what faith in God could do.
[40:39] So I can say that through it all. Yes,
[40:43] Lord.
[40:45] Through it all,
[40:49] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[40:53] I have learned to trust in God.
[40:57] [Music]
[40:58] Through it all,
[41:03] through it all,
[41:06] I've learned
[41:08] to depend upon it. One more time.
[41:13] Through it all,
[41:16] it's through it all.
[41:21] Through it all,
[41:24] I learn to trust in Jesus. Jesus,
[41:29] I've learned to trust you. And my God is
[41:34] through it all.
[41:39] Through it all,
[41:42] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[41:48] Yes, I've learned. I've learned I've
[41:52] learned to depend upon his word.
[41:59] Amen. Is that your testimony tonight?
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can depend upon his word.
[42:07] Amen. And we're coming to the portion of
[42:09] the service where we're hearing the
[42:10] preaching of the word of God. Amen. The
[42:13] most important part of this service. And
[42:15] we certainly enjoyed that meeting this
[42:17] morning.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; I really enjoyed it. It was so good. I
[42:21] thank the Lord for it and uh got so many
[42:23] good things out of there. My heart was
[42:26] really blessed and like I said that the
[42:28] Lord Jesus was here this morning
[42:30] &gt;&gt; and he promised he would gather where
[42:33] two or three would be gathered in his
[42:34] name. He said he would be there
[42:37] &gt;&gt; and he's here tonight.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Are you going to receive from him?
[42:44] &gt;&gt; And that's our expectations. I'm not
[42:46] expecting to receive from brother Mark
[42:48] or anyone else but from him.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; And I believe he has everything we have
[42:52] need of for this life's journey.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; And we don't know when this journey is
[42:56] going to end, do we
[42:58] &gt;&gt; on this life? We don't know.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; But we're here now. And we're here to
[43:02] receive whatever the Lord Jesus has for
[43:04] us. Amen. And so we appreciate our dear
[43:07] brother Mark. He's here with us. And his
[43:10] original plan was to stop by this
[43:13] morning and be gone. and I squeezed on
[43:17] him a little bit and uh so he's here
[43:18] with us tonight. Did I do a good job?
[43:20] But keep I think I did a good job. I he
[43:24] said he got bamboozled.
[43:27] So we appreciate brother Mark. Um I took
[43:30] a trip I I think I went to West Africa
[43:33] that time and I asked Brother Mark to
[43:35] come. I couldn't think of any um you
[43:39] know there's several ministries you can
[43:41] have come in while you're gone and he
[43:43] was one of those that I can have him
[43:45] come in and take the services for us. I
[43:47] have a lot of confidence in him and his
[43:50] spirit and the way he does things and
[43:52] they have meetings next weekend ones
[43:54] that we'll spend eternity with. Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So as he prepares to come and as
[44:00] he just takes his time we'll sing
[44:02] Amazing Grace.
[44:04] Why don't you reach over and shake
[44:05] somebody's hand and let's start that
[44:08] part. When we
[44:11] been there
[44:14] 10,000
[44:16] [Music]
[44:18] years,
[44:20] Christ shine
[44:23] as
[44:25] the sun
[44:29] may
[44:30] sing grace.
[44:33] How sweet
[44:36] the sound.
[44:38] [Music]
[45:10] Amen.
[45:12] The part that says a wretch like me,
[45:16] it's easy to point and say, "Yeah, a
[45:18] wretch like him
[45:20] or a wretch like her." You they came
[45:22] from the world, you know, they they're
[45:23] wretches. But when you can recognize
[45:25] that you were the wrench
[45:28] and before the foundation of the world,
[45:30] you were in his mind, that makes you a
[45:34] worthy wrench.
[45:36] Washed by the blood of Jesus.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; And when you've been washed, the wrench
[45:40] part is dropped and you become worthy.
[45:43] That's why when we sing that song, we
[45:45] should recognize, hey, this is for me.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; He died for me. You know, what did I do?
[45:51] Nothing. But he did it all. No wonder
[45:54] brother Ram liked that song. Amazing
[45:56] Grace. How sweet the sound. Amen. God
[46:00] bless you. Welcome to Tucson, Arizona.
[46:04] Shalom tabernacle. Um I'm glad most of
[46:08] you came back.
[46:10] You must love the message around here. A
[46:13] lot of times we'll take a nap in the
[46:14] afternoon. We won't wake up in time. You
[46:16] know, because I used to hate taking naps
[46:17] when I was young. I I just that was for
[46:19] old people. And then I turned what past
[46:22] 25 and I'm like I gotta have a nap after
[46:24] Sunday morning because if not I wouldn't
[46:26] make it through the day. But you know
[46:28] how many really enjoyed that word this
[46:31] morning?
[46:32] &gt;&gt; You know I was the interpreter and I
[46:34] really enjoyed it. I don't know about
[46:36] you but I was I was having a good time.
[46:38] I said forget them. I'm getting the
[46:39] blessing myself right now. Double
[46:41] blessing.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; A blessing in Spanish and then a
[46:45] blessing in English. And I I love it
[46:47] when the minister is inspired when he
[46:49] knows what he's talking about
[46:51] &gt;&gt; and he believes what he's talking about
[46:53] that makes it even more precious because
[46:55] the word of God should quicken us.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; It should it should make us the most
[46:59] happiest people in the world. There's
[47:01] something about when God's anointing
[47:03] comes down and you're hearing the
[47:04] message and it's like
[47:07] &gt;&gt; that's for you.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; You're like, "Wow, praise the Lord. I
[47:11] feel no wonder Brian used to say I feel
[47:13] religious right now." Why? because a
[47:16] spirit would come down and it would
[47:17] remind him you were in my mind
[47:20] &gt;&gt; in the beginning and you have a job to
[47:22] do. You have a message to preach and you
[47:26] know God uses so many different
[47:27] ministers. I mean there are so many
[47:28] different ministers in this world.
[47:30] People that have been preaching for
[47:31] years, people that are dying to preach.
[47:34] Those ones I got to pray for. I'm
[47:35] thinking why would you want to preach in
[47:37] the first place? But they're dying to
[47:38] get up here. I don't know why. You know,
[47:40] this is not a highpaying job. You know,
[47:42] we don't have a retirement plan with
[47:43] here on the earth church. you know,
[47:45] we're working 24/7,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; but I think everybody has their own
[47:50] grace
[47:51] &gt;&gt; to speak to the people. And the brother
[47:54] one, I've known him for a couple of
[47:55] years, and I love the way he speaks, his
[47:57] Spaniard accent, you know, and uh I
[48:00] thought to myself, one day, I would love
[48:01] to have him preach at our convention,
[48:02] and God granted it this year.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; He's preaching for us on Sunday. So, if
[48:06] you can't make it, you know, um you can
[48:08] watch it on live service after you
[48:10] finish doing your church service, okay?
[48:12] Don't don't don't be skipping to come,
[48:14] but just it's there on on the website.
[48:16] Brother Paul Ball says, "That's right."
[48:17] Brother Paul says, "So, uh, anyway, so
[48:19] we're looking forward to having a
[48:20] wonderful time in the Lord." And I love
[48:22] fellowship. I really do. I love being
[48:23] around people. Like brother Paul said,
[48:25] we're going to spend an eternity
[48:26] together. If we can't get along now,
[48:29] &gt;&gt; one of us ain't going to heaven.
[48:32] It's as simple as that. That brother, I
[48:34] don't know about that brother. Well, you
[48:35] better watch that, brother. Because if
[48:36] it was Saul of Tarsus here in the church
[48:38] this evening, nobody would want to sit
[48:40] by him
[48:41] &gt;&gt; because he's a murderer. He's a
[48:42] persecutor. You know, he's he hates
[48:45] God's people, but yet he's religious.
[48:46] And we want to distance ourselves from
[48:48] him. But look at the grace of God
[48:51] &gt;&gt; that God takes this wretched man, Paul,
[48:54] and he converts him and he changes his
[48:56] heart. And who would have thought that
[48:58] he would have been the first messenger
[49:00] to the first church age? And who would
[49:03] have imagined that our prophet would
[49:04] have said what Paul preached?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; I have preached
[49:09] &gt;&gt; what a blessed people we are. This is
[49:11] why we should be the most happiest
[49:12] people on the earth.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; That's why when you come to church,
[49:15] please come with a smile
[49:17] &gt;&gt; because when I'm up here, I can see all
[49:18] of you.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; I can see everybody of you, you know.
[49:21] Are you happy? Yeah, I'm happy. No,
[49:23] don't be lying. Smile. Well, this is
[49:24] this is my smile. Get used to it. Like,
[49:27] okay. But we should be happy to be in
[49:29] the house of God because this is life
[49:32] for us.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; We were born for this church. You
[49:35] weren't born to be rich or to be a star,
[49:37] to be a famous singer, you know,
[49:39] Hollywood actor, you know, forget them.
[49:40] They're all going to hell. If they don't
[49:42] get converted,
[49:44] &gt;&gt; but you were born for a reason. You were
[49:46] born to praise God.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; You were born to serve. You were born to
[49:52] to suffer in life, to get sick, to to
[49:55] get tempted, to get tried, to get kicked
[49:57] around. How many of you been kicked
[49:58] around before? It ain't a very good
[50:00] feeling, church, get kicked around. But
[50:02] you know what? Get up and, you know,
[50:03] dust it off and get keep on pressing on
[50:06] because this ain't home.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what, we're almost
[50:09] home, though.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Look at the signs around us at the time.
[50:13] They're getting darker and darker and
[50:14] man has lost his mind.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; He's gone crazy. The the black is white
[50:19] and the white is black and it's like,
[50:21] what's wrong with our world today,
[50:23] &gt;&gt; you know? But thank God that this never
[50:25] changes.
[50:27] Hallelujah.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached a message
[50:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[50:31] and forever. He preached that message 28
[50:33] times.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; What does that tell you? How important
[50:37] it is to know that Jesus Christ is the
[50:38] same yesterday,
[50:39] &gt;&gt; today, and tomorrow. And if you live to
[50:42] be 100 years old, Brother Levi, if you
[50:44] do, the day you die, because you're all
[50:46] going to die one day, not now, but
[50:48] hopefully later. the day you die, he's
[50:51] still the same yesterday,
[50:53] &gt;&gt; today,
[50:55] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; But when we die, we go to eternity and
[50:58] we become eternal. Amen. So, we don't
[51:00] want to talk about death because that's
[51:01] a very scary thing. We're going to talk
[51:03] about seed work this evening. And uh if
[51:05] you just bow your heads real quickly,
[51:07] we're going to pray, then you can be
[51:08] seated. Heavenly Father, we are so
[51:10] thankful to be in your house of worship
[51:11] once again.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, we say that this is the most
[51:14] happiest place that we wouldn't rather
[51:15] be anywhere else. Lord, even though we
[51:17] got problems,
[51:18] &gt;&gt; we got trials, we got tomorrow, some of
[51:21] us got to work, we don't want to go to
[51:23] work, we're probably even thinking of
[51:24] calling in sick. We don't know, Father,
[51:27] but we don't know how long we're going
[51:28] to be here. But we have a promise that
[51:29] when we hear your word, there's
[51:31] something that tells us it's not very
[51:34] far away.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And we hear a small still voice within
[51:38] this message that speaks to us and tells
[51:41] us, "Hold on, my child.
[51:44] Joy comes in the morning.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; One day there's going to be a
[51:49] resurrection.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Dead in Christ going to rise and we who
[51:52] remain shall be caught up together to
[51:54] meet our blessed to meet our blessed
[51:58] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Father,
[52:01] bless this church, the sanctuary. Lord,
[52:04] it's a this is a gift to your people.
[52:06] Father, this is your house. Lord, it's
[52:09] been dedicated for your service. Father,
[52:11] bless your people. If a bystander would
[52:14] come in one day, a wanderer would come
[52:16] in. Lord, may you find hope, may you
[52:18] find presence and know that here you
[52:21] dwell amongst your children. Father,
[52:23] your word is already blessed, but we are
[52:24] the ones that need the blessings.
[52:25] Father, if we're tired, take away our
[52:27] tiredness. If we're sad, give us joy. If
[52:29] we're depressed, give us, Lord, victory
[52:32] in the name of Jesus. Father, I commit
[52:34] myself into your hands and this church
[52:36] and this ministry and your bride
[52:38] throughout the world. Lord, in the
[52:40] precious name of Jesus Christ, we ask
[52:42] it. Amen. Let's read real quickly the
[52:44] book of Amos 3:3 3-7. Uh the the title
[52:49] of this message is
[52:52] seed word.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; For something to grow, it's got to be a
[52:56] seed.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; And for the seed to grow, it's got to be
[52:59] water. And we know that the natural
[53:01] types is spiritual. The the the the good
[53:03] fertile ground is a good heart that will
[53:05] receive the word of God. And the water
[53:06] is a Holy Spirit that will make that
[53:08] person grow. You know, there's something
[53:09] about somebody who loves the Lord that
[53:11] you just love being around them.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; I I I have found people in Colombia that
[53:14] I just love being around. Why? There's
[53:17] something about them that just attracts
[53:18] me to want to hang out with them. You
[53:21] know, take them to buy drink some
[53:23] coffee, buy coffee for them, you know,
[53:24] buy him a a donor or something, but just
[53:26] hang out with them because these are fun
[53:28] people to be around. These are children
[53:29] of God, you know.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; You know, and you know, your your
[53:32] pastor, he's one of our our our favorite
[53:33] ministers. uh and uh because we we just
[53:37] love brother Paulo and you know I think
[53:39] he's a message believer he's I think
[53:40] he's a Christian too you know there's
[53:42] something about that we just really
[53:43] enjoy your pastor and uh thank you for
[53:46] the opportunity to to speak even though
[53:48] I feel I was bamboozled into this one
[53:50] but I already preached this morning in
[53:52] English you know but the good news is
[53:55] that I have nothing good to say
[53:58] &gt;&gt; this is not my word that's right
[53:59] &gt;&gt; one day when I stand before God he's
[54:01] going to ask me what did you do son I'm
[54:02] going to say
[54:04] nothing.
[54:06] Cuz what I preached, it wasn't even my
[54:08] word. It was your word.
[54:12] What did you accomplish in life?
[54:14] Nothing. You nothing. You You didn't do
[54:18] a great accomplishment. No, I didn't do
[54:19] nothing. I I did the best I could do,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; but I did did make one decision. The
[54:24] only thing I could give God was my
[54:26] heart.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I gave him my heart. and he took it and
[54:31] he changed it and he mold it and he's
[54:33] still working on us church
[54:34] &gt;&gt; because we have not reached perfection
[54:36] because if we have reached perfection
[54:37] we'd have been gone a long time ago.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; But something is holding us back church.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe the last one hasn't come in yet.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe the last one is you.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's me. I don't know. But when
[54:49] the last one comes in, and the prophet
[54:51] has said it before, the doors of mercy
[54:54] will close to the Gentile people
[54:56] &gt;&gt; and God will turn to the Jews, the
[54:58] original ones that were looking for him
[55:00] &gt;&gt; because we weren't looking for him,
[55:02] &gt;&gt; but grace found us. Aren't you glad
[55:04] about that?
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. My father used to go me and say,
[55:07] "Boy, read the scripture and sit them
[55:09] down."
[55:11] So, I'm going to do that because I can
[55:12] still hear his voice right now. Amos
[55:14] 3:es 3-7. And the question is, can two
[55:18] walk together except they be agreed?
[55:21] Will a lion roar in the forest when he
[55:24] hath no prey? Will a young lion cry out
[55:28] his den if he hath taken nothing? Can a
[55:32] bird fall in a snare upon the earth
[55:34] where no jin is for him? Shall one take
[55:38] up a snare from the earth and have taken
[55:41] nothing at all? Shall a trumpet be blown
[55:44] in the city, and the people not be
[55:46] afraid? Shall there be evil in a city,
[55:48] and God hath not done it? Surely, the
[55:52] Lord God will do nothing, but he
[55:55] revealed his secret to his servants, the
[55:59] prophets. Hebrews 13:8:9 reads, "Jesus
[56:03] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[56:07] forever. Be not carried away with divers
[56:10] and strange doctrines. For it is a good
[56:12] thing that the heart be established with
[56:15] grace, not with meat which have been
[56:18] profited them
[56:20] and
[56:26] have been occupied therein. Heavenly
[56:28] Father, we know that your word is
[56:29] blessed. We are the ones that need the
[56:31] blessings. Father, as we as we for a few
[56:34] moments speak about you, Lord, may you
[56:36] just come down and touch our hearts.
[56:37] Father, we want to leave from here,
[56:39] Lord, strengthened and encouraged by
[56:41] your word. Father, we want to have that
[56:43] hope that when we wake up tomorrow,
[56:45] Lord, that hey, I can make it. God's
[56:47] grace has brought me this far, and God's
[56:50] grace will take me even farther, Lord.
[56:52] We need you now more than ever. And we
[56:54] ask all these things in the precious
[56:56] name of Jesus. Amen. God bless you. You
[56:58] may be seated.
[57:00] I I I always tell the church because the
[57:02] prophet has said it before that we
[57:04] should be the most happiest people in
[57:06] the world.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Now when you when you when you define
[57:10] what happy is is somebody who always is
[57:12] full of joy like a little bubbling
[57:13] spring. Something is always bubbling in
[57:16] him. And I think to me uh when I was
[57:18] growing up you know as young people very
[57:20] young we we always couldn't wait for
[57:22] church to end
[57:24] &gt;&gt; because we wanted to go outside and play
[57:25] basketball because basketball was very
[57:27] important for young people to bond with.
[57:30] until somebody started losing. They got
[57:32] tempered got out of control.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And then we grew up and after a while we
[57:35] we got a more of a revelation that this
[57:37] is the best place to be is in the house
[57:38] of God.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Because we we are here for one purpose.
[57:41] We are here to be strengthened. We are
[57:44] here to feed the spiritual man.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; You know this morning our souls was
[57:49] rejoicing. We've heard it before.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing new. But we're reminded by the
[57:55] spirit that this is God's word. And so
[57:57] we rejoice this morning.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. and almost, you know, we didn't
[58:00] want to dismiss. We wanted to stay here
[58:02] for a little bit longer.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Well, the ones that weren't hungry did.
[58:06] And, you know, it just bubbles in our
[58:08] hearts when the word of God is spoken.
[58:10] There's something about that it just
[58:11] brings us to life. I I always remember
[58:14] my father. My father was, you know, he
[58:16] he loved this message with all his
[58:18] heart. And when he when he pressed
[58:21] forward, he made the commitment, I'm
[58:23] pressing forward, not going backward.
[58:26] And whenever he would testify to new
[58:28] conference in the church and he would
[58:30] speak about the the the creation of the
[58:32] squirrels, you know, and the stopping of
[58:33] the storm, my father always told that
[58:35] story like it was for the first time
[58:37] with so much anointing. And I used to
[58:40] love hearing my dad talk about the
[58:41] squirrels. He get
[58:44] praise the Lord. The creative word, our
[58:47] prophet called the squirrels and then
[58:49] the voice tells him, didn't you ask for
[58:51] three year? You know, and my my father
[58:54] was he with so much enthus. He never got
[58:56] tired of saying it. And I think that a
[58:58] child of God, the closer you get home,
[59:01] the more spiritual we should be, the
[59:03] more happier we should be. Church,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; you know, I tell the church, I'm not
[59:07] looking to fill up my church with
[59:09] people. I'm looking for the people to
[59:10] get filled up.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; You know, a bonfire doesn't take 50
[59:16] matches. It takes one match.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I have an analogy. One day
[59:24] I was cleaning the yard. I don't do it
[59:27] very often because it takes inspiration
[59:28] and sometimes I don't get enough
[59:29] inspiration. So, but that one day I got
[59:31] inspired to clean my yard cuz my wife
[59:33] said, "When are you going to clean the
[59:34] yard?" So, I got inspiration really
[59:36] quick. And I started cleaning the yard
[59:38] and I'm I'm out there whacking. I'm
[59:40] sweating. Nobody brings me a glass of
[59:42] tea, but I'm out there cleaning the
[59:43] yard, you know, clean the yard and rake,
[59:45] you know, and when I got done, I just
[59:47] felt led to start a bonfire.
[59:50] It was nice cooling. I thought, man, I'm
[59:51] gonna start me a bonfire, Brother Po,
[59:54] and I'm gonna enjoy the bonfire by
[59:55] myself because I deserve it. So, I
[59:59] gathered wood and I thought, I don't got
[1:00:02] time to wait for it to ignite. So, I'm
[1:00:04] going to get a gallon of gas.
[1:00:08] Hello.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Like brother Juan said this morning.
[1:00:10] Okay. Okay.
[1:00:13] And so, I got a gallon of gas and I
[1:00:15] drenched the wood and I'm thinking, this
[1:00:18] is going to be good, brother.
[1:00:20] Oh, I'm going to enjoy this fire. And I
[1:00:21] drenched the wood and I just, you know,
[1:00:24] then I I I sat back, you know, and I got
[1:00:26] a match and I waited for the fumes to,
[1:00:28] you know, kind of raise up, you know,
[1:00:31] and it reminded me of this. How many of
[1:00:34] you have been in the message for more
[1:00:35] than 20 years?
[1:00:38] 30, anybody 30, 40,
[1:00:42] 50,
[1:00:44] 55?
[1:00:47] And I thought, how many messages
[1:00:50] have we heard in 50 years?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; And every time I heard a message,
[1:00:55] brother, there was life in that word.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Didn't matter if an evangelist came from
[1:01:00] Mexico or Colombia or Spain or whatever,
[1:01:03] when he spoke the word of God or he
[1:01:05] preached the word of God and he brought
[1:01:06] forth the message, there was inspiration
[1:01:10] in that message. Even if you go back and
[1:01:12] listen to a message from 1946, the
[1:01:14] prophet preaching, the inspiration is
[1:01:17] still there, church.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Whenever you feel tired and weary and
[1:01:21] depressed, put in a tape from 1946, and
[1:01:24] you're still going to feel the anointing
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; and that's going to tell you that the
[1:01:27] word of God, it is still bubbling.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And it reminded me of this wood here's
[1:01:33] all these fumes. This all that flames
[1:01:35] are igniting.
[1:01:37] For years, we've been hearing the
[1:01:38] message. We're so ignited with so much
[1:01:40] message, message after message. I've
[1:01:42] heard I've heard this many tapes. I've
[1:01:44] I've heard this many quotes. You know,
[1:01:45] we got to the point that when if I start
[1:01:47] to to mention the verse in your mind,
[1:01:49] you can already finish it.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Ah, see why I know the Bible. I've known
[1:01:58] it for years. And here's all these fumes
[1:02:01] just evaporating, but something's
[1:02:04] missing.
[1:02:07] And I sat there for a while and waited.
[1:02:09] I could see I could see the the fumes
[1:02:10] from the gas just rising like this is
[1:02:12] going to be good. Real good. And I got
[1:02:16] back, brother. And I just got that match
[1:02:17] and I went,
[1:02:21] you know what I heard?
[1:02:26] And I said, I have created this.
[1:02:32] And I sat down and I enjoyed my bonfire.
[1:02:35] It was burning like, "Oh, it's just
[1:02:38] beautiful."
[1:02:39] And I thought for years we've been
[1:02:41] sitting in church listening to messages,
[1:02:43] beautiful inspired messages. You know,
[1:02:45] we just be dowed with so much gas.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Quote after quote, you know, Brother
[1:02:50] Bram quote something and we can finish
[1:02:52] the quote. Why? I've heard it before.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; I've heard that before. Yeah, that's a
[1:02:57] beautiful quote. I love that quote. And
[1:02:59] that's as far as it gets. And year after
[1:03:02] year, just quote after quote and quote
[1:03:04] and scripture and scripture and we know
[1:03:06] all these songs about the prophet end
[1:03:07] time message and just and brother we're
[1:03:10] just sitting there like a pile of wood
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; with so much fire but something's
[1:03:15] missing. I thought Lord if you could
[1:03:18] just send a spark
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; upon your church
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; brother would be an explosion.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; God doesn't need a full church to have a
[1:03:28] revival. He needs one person.
[1:03:31] who's a religious arsonist
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; who loves the Lord.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; And when that brother gets full of the
[1:03:37] fire, brother, he'll come to a church
[1:03:39] ignited
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; and his life will will inspire you,
[1:03:43] brother.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; There was a sister in our church that
[1:03:46] hadn't come for a while and she went to
[1:03:47] the world when she came back. And I
[1:03:49] would see her in church and and you
[1:03:51] know, in my church, I I'm one of the
[1:03:52] musicians and I'd be watching her
[1:03:54] because a pastor can do that,
[1:03:56] okay?
[1:03:58] I would watch her and you know she she
[1:04:00] would would raise up her hands and she
[1:04:02] would begin to cry. Man, that blessed
[1:04:05] me. I thought here is a child of God
[1:04:08] that's crying
[1:04:10] and her and her worship to the Lord. It
[1:04:12] inspired me and I'm the pastor. I'm
[1:04:15] supposed to inspire you. And here was a
[1:04:17] member inspired me because her fire her
[1:04:20] her spirit to worship to praise God. She
[1:04:23] didn't care no what she got to do. She'd
[1:04:24] raise up her hand. They start crying and
[1:04:26] I thought, "Wow, that inspires me." If
[1:04:28] it all could be like that, that we'd
[1:04:30] come to church and forget who's here.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not ashamed to cry,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want to bite you to see me.
[1:04:38] What's wrong, brother? No, I got
[1:04:39] something in my eye, brother. Well,
[1:04:41] there sure is a lot of it cuz there's
[1:04:42] tears everywhere.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; You know Jesus when he wept, he didn't
[1:04:46] hide behind. No, he wept like a man
[1:04:48] because he his heart was broken. He had
[1:04:51] been rejected. the creator had been
[1:04:53] rejected by his creation
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; and it broke his heart and he cried, you
[1:04:58] know, he weep over Jerusalem. Why?
[1:05:00] Because he had emotions and and I think
[1:05:02] to myself, when the presence of God
[1:05:03] comes down, why do we got to be so
[1:05:06] uptight?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Why we got to be, you know, well,
[1:05:09] someone's going to see me. Let them see
[1:05:11] me.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Who cares?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; You know, I was I was made for a reason.
[1:05:15] I was made to I was made to praise God.
[1:05:17] I was made to worship God. Maybe I don't
[1:05:20] have the the best voice in the church,
[1:05:22] but I don't care if I can sing from my
[1:05:24] heart. By the time my song gets to
[1:05:26] heaven, God is rejoicing
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; and he's saying, "Oh, what a beautiful
[1:05:30] song this my son is singing." He's
[1:05:33] singing it from his heart.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; He might be getting condemned by the
[1:05:37] other church members because he can't
[1:05:38] sing worth a hoot,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; but I but his but his praises, his
[1:05:43] adoration have reached my presence
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; and I'm receiving them.
[1:05:48] That's what God wants.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; He wants your praise.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; When you're tired, when you're weary,
[1:05:52] when when you feel, oh, I I don't feel
[1:05:53] like going to church till Wednesday. I
[1:05:55] had a rough day. You know, God will
[1:05:56] understand. Will he?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; When you get to when you get to the end
[1:06:02] of your road and you're breathing your
[1:06:03] last breath, will it matter how much
[1:06:05] money you had in the bank? Will it
[1:06:07] matter how much property you had or how
[1:06:09] many times you you shout amen in church
[1:06:12] and really didn't mean it?
[1:06:15] You know what will matter the most? If
[1:06:17] in your heart there's a beating and that
[1:06:20] beating is Jesus
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; and something tells you you're a few
[1:06:24] beats from eternity.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the most glorious age for a
[1:06:29] believer when he comes to the end of his
[1:06:31] road and he has lived his best for the
[1:06:34] Lord. He's given his all. Lord, I I like
[1:06:36] what brother Brandham said. If the Lord
[1:06:38] were to offer me a thousand years of of
[1:06:40] of of riches, you know, and have power
[1:06:42] and all these things, you know, but at
[1:06:44] the end lose everything or ask me, do
[1:06:47] you want a hundred years of misery? You
[1:06:49] know, who wants misery? Every time we
[1:06:52] pray, we're always saying, Lord, bless
[1:06:54] me.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, give me, Lord, open the door. We
[1:07:01] never say, Lord, close the door. or
[1:07:03] Lord, can you please send me another
[1:07:05] trial? Because yesterday was easy peasy
[1:07:08] like my grandkids say. Easy peasy
[1:07:10] whizzy. Even squeezy, grandpa. It was
[1:07:11] easy. You know, we were always praying
[1:07:14] for blessings. We're always saying,
[1:07:15] "Lord, bless me. Give me, give me, give
[1:07:17] me."
[1:07:19] But when we get to the end of life, what
[1:07:21] really matters? I I I still can hear the
[1:07:24] words of my mother. Mikosh, she said,
[1:07:26] "All my life, I have prepared for this
[1:07:28] moment
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; to die, to go see Jesus." And I'm
[1:07:33] thinking, what a what a revelation that
[1:07:35] that's why we're here.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; We're preparing to go home, not to stay
[1:07:39] here.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; You know, we're not looking for an
[1:07:41] extension in life to to live longer. You
[1:07:43] know, you know, this world has nothing
[1:07:44] to offer.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart or the our
[1:07:48] system is broken. Our money system has
[1:07:50] no value.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Morals have gone. Our politicians are
[1:07:54] more crooked than crooer.
[1:07:56] And and then our president that we have,
[1:07:58] you know, I don't know who voted for
[1:08:00] him, but he's Poco Loco,
[1:08:04] but yet the people are even crazier
[1:08:07] because they voted for him, you know.
[1:08:09] And I'm thinking this world is so messed
[1:08:11] up that we don't care who's in office as
[1:08:13] long as we get whoever we voted for, you
[1:08:15] know. And we're so consumed with life
[1:08:18] and the problems in life that we forget
[1:08:21] why we're here. And when we come to
[1:08:23] church, we're so filled with problems of
[1:08:25] life and oh, if you only know my
[1:08:27] problems and here's Christ talking just
[1:08:29] wanting to have a few moments with you.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Burbam said, "If you gave if you told
[1:08:35] God, you know, if you gave him second
[1:08:36] place, he would take second place.
[1:08:39] You gave him third place, he would take
[1:08:41] third place.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He'd take fourth, he take fifth place in
[1:08:44] your life,
[1:08:46] but he should be the first place." Come
[1:08:49] on.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; When we when we think about who we are,
[1:08:54] what we're doing in this age, and we ask
[1:08:56] ourselves, why is it that God chose to
[1:08:58] live in this most glorious age? You
[1:09:00] know, we we've done nothing great. You
[1:09:02] know, the message we preach was one that
[1:09:05] was given to us already.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; When a brother said, "Brother Castile,
[1:09:08] that was a tremendous message to
[1:09:10] preach." I'm like, "Yeah, well, it
[1:09:11] wasn't mine. I'm just repeating what the
[1:09:13] prophet said.
[1:09:15] God sent a prophet
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; in this last hour to bring a message to
[1:09:19] call out a people to prepare a people to
[1:09:21] take his people home to live with his
[1:09:23] people forever.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Who doesn't want to live forever?
[1:09:25] Churchmen,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; we should be happy. And the reason that
[1:09:29] I mention that is because on June or
[1:09:32] July the 6, the quote of the day said
[1:09:36] this and it said, "God don't want you to
[1:09:39] be frowny.
[1:09:46] God wants you to be happy.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; The human heart was made to be happy.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; What makes you happy? Jesus loves me.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Should that be the most glorious thing
[1:10:00] that Jesus loves me? That that I've been
[1:10:02] so blessed to to have a message brought
[1:10:04] to me in this last hour
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; that I have access to the message at any
[1:10:08] hour of the day.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You know, when I can't sleep, you know
[1:10:11] what I do? I put on the tape of Brother
[1:10:12] Brandham and then I fall asleep within
[1:10:14] 10 minutes.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Well, that that that's not very good.
[1:10:17] No, it is good
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; because the anointing it relieves my
[1:10:20] stress and it knocks me out.
[1:10:24] How many want to get knocked out today?
[1:10:26] I do
[1:10:28] by the Holy Spirit.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; and he says temper will cause cancer.
[1:10:36] Yeah.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You know, I I have battled with a temper
[1:10:38] for when I do a certain job because I
[1:10:41] don't like to make mistakes. And I've
[1:10:43] learned to just be I say, "Lord,
[1:10:49] temper." Why? He says, "Because temper
[1:10:53] will cause cancer.
[1:10:57] Don't ever be upset.
[1:10:59] Just walk in his love."
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. knowing that you're walking in him
[1:11:06] and nothing can harm you.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can harm you.
[1:11:10] There's neither powers, things present,
[1:11:13] things future,
[1:11:15] nothing can separate us from him. We're
[1:11:18] in him and we never come in our own
[1:11:20] will. He by choice, like this morning,
[1:11:24] he
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; by choice elected us and brought us to
[1:11:29] him.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's his business to take care
[1:11:36] of me.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; No man can pluck them from my father's
[1:11:44] hands cuz he's the greatest of all them.
[1:11:47] Amen. It's the father who care who takes
[1:11:49] care of it who's got any more power than
[1:11:52] God. So what kind of power have you got
[1:11:55] over you to take care of you? The whole
[1:11:57] powers that created the universe. Amen.
[1:12:00] that took the solar system and blew it
[1:12:03] like that and every star went into its
[1:12:06] place. Sure. And he watches over you.
[1:12:09] Amen. That's the kind of father
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; that we have.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; You know, I have three grandkids. The
[1:12:18] newest one came about a month and a half
[1:12:20] ago. Her name is Rosalia Castillo.
[1:12:23] Beautiful little girl.
[1:12:26] My granddaughter. I've been waiting for
[1:12:28] years for this one. And my my oldest
[1:12:30] grandson, you know, there there's
[1:12:32] something about grandsons, you know,
[1:12:33] they I love them to death. And sometimes
[1:12:36] my kids think, you know, you never loved
[1:12:38] us like that. I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I
[1:12:40] did. I did." But there's there's
[1:12:42] something special about grandkids. And
[1:12:43] my oldest one, he whenever I see him,
[1:12:46] you know, sometimes he misbehaves
[1:12:48] and he gets out of control, but I still
[1:12:50] love him. There's something about his
[1:12:52] character that, you know, he he can walk
[1:12:54] up to me and say, "Grandpa, can I live
[1:12:56] with you forever?" And just by saying
[1:12:58] that, all the wrong that he's done, it
[1:13:00] is erased.
[1:13:02] And I say, "Yes, you can, me, let's talk
[1:13:05] to your dad. Let's get your social
[1:13:07] security and you can come and live with
[1:13:08] grandpa forever." Cuz he said, "I want
[1:13:10] to be with you forever." You know, and
[1:13:13] their day when when we went to go eat,
[1:13:14] he he said, "Grandpa, I need to go to
[1:13:16] the bathroom, but he only wanted me to
[1:13:18] take him." So I took him. He goes and he
[1:13:20] sits in the toilet, locks the door
[1:13:22] because he needs privacy now. He's 5
[1:13:23] years old. Grandpa, I need privacy.
[1:13:24] Like, okay. So he goes inside, locks the
[1:13:27] stall, sits down on the toilet, and
[1:13:28] starts singing from his heart. I'm
[1:13:31] thinking, who sings in the toilet at a
[1:13:34] restaurant, but his heart is so sincere,
[1:13:37] you know, and and and and he writes his
[1:13:39] own songs. I don't know where he gets
[1:13:40] the words, but he writes his own songs.
[1:13:42] And next, they know I'm here and there,
[1:13:44] and he loves my heart.
[1:13:49] He come back and he loves my heart.
[1:13:54] And I'm thinking, "Wow,
[1:13:57] little kid so small singing to the
[1:13:59] Lord." I wondered what was God thinking
[1:14:01] at that moment. What a beautiful child
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; praising me. And then even when you get
[1:14:06] to the end, he would say, "And loves my
[1:14:10] heart."
[1:14:12] I'm thinking, "Where do you get that
[1:14:13] part from?" You know,
[1:14:15] and and so so sincere, so so so pure,
[1:14:19] you know, that they they that they so so
[1:14:21] wonderful children, you And I'm thinking
[1:14:23] if a grandfather can love his child like
[1:14:26] that with all the mistakes
[1:14:29] because sometimes they do get to
[1:14:31] control. They get too loud. We got to
[1:14:32] say, "Hey, all right, that's enough.
[1:14:34] Shut up.
[1:14:36] You're too loud." You know, they're they
[1:14:39] they're going in my truck and one of
[1:14:40] them was singing one of the Christian
[1:14:41] songs and the other brother was saying,
[1:14:43] "Hey, you're singing too loud. Shut up."
[1:14:46] and my grandson would sing even louder,
[1:14:49] you know, and I'm thinking, you know,
[1:14:50] all the imperfections, I love them. And
[1:14:54] and and if we could love our children
[1:14:55] like that, I thought, what about the
[1:14:57] love of God
[1:14:59] that he loved us so much that he would
[1:15:00] think about us before we even came here
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; and we have everything in its place for
[1:15:06] us to come and enjoy of his blessings.
[1:15:10] And I thought, you know, what a
[1:15:12] privilege that in this hour we got to
[1:15:14] have the privilege of of of knowing a
[1:15:17] prophet that God sent with the message
[1:15:19] to prepare us for that day. You know,
[1:15:22] you just cannot imagine what awaits us,
[1:15:25] church. You can see a picture of heaven
[1:15:28] and think, well, that's a beautiful
[1:15:29] picture of heaven, but it does not
[1:15:30] compare to what it is. And then God
[1:15:33] sends a prophet because God does nothing
[1:15:35] unless he talks to a prophet first. If
[1:15:37] it was not for that, we wouldn't have a
[1:15:38] message today, church. But you know even
[1:15:40] the prophet was so humbled that he would
[1:15:42] say I'm not a preacher or a great public
[1:15:44] speaker but from my heart I'm trying to
[1:15:47] introduce you
[1:15:49] to Jesus Christ.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; today and forever. You know the prophet
[1:15:56] never said me me me me me me me me me me
[1:15:57] me me me me me me me me me me me me. He
[1:15:57] always said he.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And so he asked the question, what kind
[1:16:03] of a sign will the seed sign be at the
[1:16:06] end time? And so I believe that we're
[1:16:08] living in the end time church.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; I believe now more than ever we should
[1:16:11] be getting close to the Lord, not
[1:16:14] farther away. Uh there's so much that's
[1:16:16] taking place in this world. It seems
[1:16:19] depressing, but I remind myself that
[1:16:21] it's not God's word that has failed or
[1:16:22] the message. It's humanity that is
[1:16:25] filled.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And so God promised to say in this last
[1:16:28] time a word seed. That's why this
[1:16:30] morning when I was hearing the word of
[1:16:31] God, I was rejoicing because there's
[1:16:33] something about the word of God that it
[1:16:35] quickens us, that it inspires us, and we
[1:16:38] can say, "Wow, amen to the word of God."
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be wonderful to live in that
[1:16:42] kind of an atmosphere all day long?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine going to work saying,
[1:16:46] "Woo, glory, hallelujah, at work."
[1:16:48] just constantly praising God, you know,
[1:16:50] and when they yell at you, okay, boss,
[1:16:52] praise the Lord,
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; you know, just being so happy, you know,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; that God sent a prophet with his word,
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; to restore us back to our original
[1:17:02] condition.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; And the more you you you walk in the
[1:17:05] presence of the Lord, the more you love
[1:17:07] being in the presence of the Lord.
[1:17:10] Brother Bram says in the message the
[1:17:11] exposition of the seven church ages part
[1:17:14] four the smir the smearian church age he
[1:17:20] says as the eternal god
[1:17:23] was manifest in the sun and in Jesus
[1:17:25] dwelt all the fullness of the godhead
[1:17:28] bbodiedly. How many of you heard that
[1:17:30] before?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that and that eternal one was
[1:17:35] the father manifest in flesh and thereby
[1:17:38] gained the title of son.
[1:17:41] Even so we eternal in his thoughts
[1:17:48] in
[1:17:53] eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:17:54] became the many membered spoken word
[1:17:58] seed
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; manifest in flesh
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and those eternal thoughts are the sons
[1:18:04] of God even as we are so-called now we
[1:18:08] did not become
[1:18:10] seed by the rebirth.
[1:18:13] We were seed and therefore we're reborn.
[1:18:16] For only the elect can be reborn
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; because we were seed
[1:18:23] is the reason we could be quickened
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; in nonseed. There is nothing to quicken.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; So when when I see all that God has done
[1:18:35] for us, you know, we ask ourselves, what
[1:18:37] do we do to deserve this?
[1:18:39] What do we do to merit God's grace? And
[1:18:42] it should make us realize, hey, we
[1:18:44] should be happy for what God has done
[1:18:46] for us. Now, everything on earth today,
[1:18:50] its origin started in Genesis, the
[1:18:52] prophet says. And we have today
[1:18:56] and now we have things today that did
[1:18:58] not begin in Genesis because it's been
[1:19:00] hybrid. Anything hybrid is a phony. It's
[1:19:04] no good. It cannot produce itself.
[1:19:06] Anything that's hybrid is man-made and
[1:19:09] cannot bring itself back again.
[1:19:12] Take corn for example, hybrid.
[1:19:15] Make it great big ear and what does it
[1:19:18] do? All right, if you want to eat it on
[1:19:21] the big ear, but what happens to it?
[1:19:23] Plant it back again and it cannot
[1:19:25] produce itself. It's no good. It's dead.
[1:19:29] Therefore, anything that wasn't spoken
[1:19:31] by God in the beginning is a hybrid.
[1:19:35] That's why it's so important that as
[1:19:37] believers, we should know our message.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; We should know our scripture
[1:19:42] because many times when a pastor gets up
[1:19:44] here on the pulpit or a visiting
[1:19:45] minister, you don't know what he's going
[1:19:47] to say.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I was telling the church,
[1:19:50] you know, if it's the word of God, it
[1:19:51] should be amen to the word of God.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; And so, I asked him 10 questions, one of
[1:19:55] our Bible studies, I'm going to ask you
[1:19:56] 10 questions. Whatever is God's word,
[1:19:58] say amen. Whatever is not, don't say
[1:20:00] amen. So, I was testing the church. I
[1:20:03] said, "Okay, the first question.
[1:20:07] In the beginning, God created the
[1:20:08] heavens and the earth." Everybody said,
[1:20:10] "Amen." I said, "Good. We're off to a
[1:20:12] good start. One for all." And asked him
[1:20:15] 10 questions. Then I got the one that
[1:20:16] said that there we are expecting an
[1:20:19] eighth messenger.
[1:20:21] And nobody said, "Amen." I said, "Glory
[1:20:22] to God."
[1:20:25] Somebody's being paying attention.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself, after I asked
[1:20:28] the 10 questions, I thought to myself,
[1:20:30] "These people know their message.
[1:20:33] But if they know the message, why aren't
[1:20:34] they saying amen to it?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; If it's the word of God, it's either
[1:20:40] amen or it's not.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You know, whenever I study and I find a
[1:20:45] quote, I think to myself, wow, this is
[1:20:47] powerful.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; The church is going to love this one.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; It's inspired. And and I get and I
[1:20:53] preach and I read it, you know,
[1:20:54] inspiration. And I hear a few, amen. I'm
[1:20:57] like, did I read it wrong?
[1:21:01] Is that what the prophets? And I go
[1:21:02] back. Wait a minute. Wait, that's what
[1:21:03] he said. All I got was just two amens.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; There there's something wrong be 40
[1:21:10] years,
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; 30 years hearing this message. Brother,
[1:21:13] we need a spark in the church.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; We need a revival
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; to be revived.
[1:21:21] Homie had bring it back again, church.
[1:21:24] You know, but but the devil knows that
[1:21:26] that his time is running out of out of
[1:21:28] time and he's he's fighting us tooth and
[1:21:30] nail to hold us back from the blessings.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; You know, I have so many blessings for
[1:21:35] my grandsons. So many blessings. But you
[1:21:39] know what holds me back is their
[1:21:41] attitude.
[1:21:43] They misbehave. I hold them back. Every
[1:21:45] time I go to the store, I'm looking to
[1:21:46] buy them something. You know, my shoes
[1:21:48] are falling apart, but it's okay. Got to
[1:21:50] buy the toy for the grandkid.
[1:21:52] Why? looking to bless them and God the
[1:21:55] same way too. He wants to bless us but
[1:21:57] we're we're not ready for the blessings
[1:21:59] church.
[1:22:01] No prayer being should be a revival
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; because prayer is one of the most
[1:22:05] powerful tools that we have is prayer.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; There's nothing more glorious than
[1:22:10] breaking the barrier
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; and entering into his glory and praising
[1:22:16] God.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; But to get there it's a battle.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when we come and kneel down
[1:22:21] at the altar, you know, it's got carpet,
[1:22:24] it's comfy. And then we kind of just
[1:22:26] kneel against the the stepping, you
[1:22:27] know, we get more comfortable and we
[1:22:29] start praying. After a while, you know,
[1:22:31] the leg falls asleep,
[1:22:33] then the other leg falls asleep, and
[1:22:35] then after a while, we fall asleep. Why?
[1:22:37] It's comfortable, you know, but prayer,
[1:22:41] it's it's a job to pray to break
[1:22:43] through. Why? The devil knows, hey, if
[1:22:45] they can break through, I have lost the
[1:22:47] battle.
[1:22:51] And that's the way that people get gets
[1:22:54] away from the word of God. It becomes an
[1:22:56] hybrid affair.
[1:23:00] It must die. It cannot bring forth of
[1:23:04] its kind to life again. The church that
[1:23:07] will refuse to believe the word of God
[1:23:10] is a hybrid church with dogmas and
[1:23:13] creeds and doctrines that's not
[1:23:15] scriptural. That church cannot bring
[1:23:17] forth a spiritfilled child because it's
[1:23:20] hybrid.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; You know, as a minister, we have an
[1:23:25] obligation, a duty to bring only what
[1:23:27] God has already said.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You know, when people are looking for
[1:23:30] something new, there's something wrong
[1:23:32] with you. I wonder what new he's going
[1:23:34] to bring. You know, like if you've heard
[1:23:36] all the message already, you're looking
[1:23:38] for something new. You know, go back and
[1:23:40] hear the tape that you heard again last
[1:23:41] week and you're going to find something
[1:23:42] new that you missed. That's right.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; You know when when my father passed
[1:23:46] away, I started playing these tapes on
[1:23:48] Sunday morning at 9:00 and my mom would
[1:23:50] say, "Miho, I am so embarrassed. I was
[1:23:54] there." I don't remember your dad saying
[1:23:55] that. And that was a pastor's wife.
[1:23:59] Why? Because as humans, we get, you
[1:24:02] know, distracted and we don't hear
[1:24:04] things.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; But you go back and hear that same type
[1:24:07] again, you're going to get another
[1:24:08] blessings church.
[1:24:10] The church cannot bring forth a
[1:24:12] spiritfilled child because it's hybrid.
[1:24:14] It's no good. It might be bigger,
[1:24:17] great big walls and fine pews, big
[1:24:20] bowels, you know, and plush seeds. But
[1:24:21] that doesn't mean one thing. It's
[1:24:23] spiritually dead.
[1:24:26] That's right. It cannot bring forth
[1:24:28] spiritfilled children because it's dead
[1:24:30] itself.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Take the message this morning and take
[1:24:34] away the spirit, the anointing that was
[1:24:36] there. And what was it? it would just be
[1:24:38] a talk to us.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; But when you got the spirit quickening
[1:24:42] in his word, brother, it's live to you.
[1:24:44] It's telling you, hey, this is not
[1:24:45] hybrid. This is my word, church,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; and it's for you.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; He relates his testimony. Abraham says
[1:24:54] in the message
[1:24:56] the end time sign seed he says
[1:25:00] here some time ago I was out west and I
[1:25:04] was standing in a man's house that
[1:25:05] invited me out for dinner and he said
[1:25:08] Mr. Bannam I see you admiring that
[1:25:11] sculpture that painting or not painting
[1:25:14] but it was kind of cart out of wood uh
[1:25:17] plaque like or over the fireplace. I
[1:25:20] said yes sir I am. And he it was an old
[1:25:24] ox cart or covered wagon with oxes, a a
[1:25:27] man in front, a little boy sitting on
[1:25:29] the seat with his mother and they were
[1:25:31] traveling and he said that was my father
[1:25:35] and mother and the little boy on the
[1:25:37] seat was myself. He said we come here in
[1:25:41] an ox cart. He said but since then we
[1:25:45] have so prospered.
[1:25:48] He said I want you to step out here in
[1:25:50] the yard. He said I I forget how many
[1:25:52] thousands of acres that he owned there
[1:25:53] on a ranch. He said I brought brought I
[1:25:56] bought that in my young days. And he
[1:25:58] said then after that the adjoining ranch
[1:26:01] on to the west I own the adjoining ranch
[1:26:04] to the south I own. He said you see the
[1:26:06] smoke over there. He goes yes sir said
[1:26:08] that's a city I forget how many property
[1:26:10] he owned in that city there. He said,
[1:26:12] "I'm the president in that bank there
[1:26:14] telling me what all he had and I
[1:26:16] listened for a while."
[1:26:18] And I said, "I would like to ask you one
[1:26:21] question,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; sir. You have pointed to the east,
[1:26:26] to the west, showing the ranches and to
[1:26:29] the the city. I would like to have you
[1:26:32] look up this way and see and tell me how
[1:26:37] much you own up there."
[1:26:40] That's the main thing
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; because someday you're going to leave
[1:26:44] every bit of this down here and then
[1:26:47] where do you go from there? That's the
[1:26:49] main thing.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; This is a a short stay here, church.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; We're here for a little time. You know,
[1:26:56] we're we're you know, life goes by so
[1:26:58] quickly.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Goes by fast. You know, when we were
[1:27:01] young, we couldn't wait to get older,
[1:27:02] you know, more mature. Now that we're
[1:27:04] old, we can't wait to get young again.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Why? because we're we're dying. Church,
[1:27:10] the natural man is dying. But but that's
[1:27:12] all right. Don't let the spiritual man
[1:27:14] die.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; You keep feeding him with the word of
[1:27:17] God. You keep you keep filling that that
[1:27:18] soul with the word that is eternal. That
[1:27:20] seed that that plants seeds of joy, of
[1:27:23] happiness, of eternal life, but that's
[1:27:26] an eternal state, he says. So I think we
[1:27:28] ought to consider where we are going for
[1:27:30] eternity.
[1:27:32] if we can so supply and fix our families
[1:27:35] and so forth here on earth with homes
[1:27:37] and houses and comfort that education
[1:27:40] that's the things we should do but the
[1:27:43] one of the main things we should do we
[1:27:45] leave undone till we get to the end of
[1:27:48] the road and drown ourselves in in
[1:27:50] eternity knowing nothing about God
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; about his plan of salvation and
[1:27:59] redeeming grace of Jesus Christ. It's
[1:28:02] pitiful that we do, but we do.
[1:28:07] You know,
[1:28:10] to me, I I think that the the one of the
[1:28:12] most inspired words of this hour is this
[1:28:14] message of this hour, church.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And to me, you know, when when you hear
[1:28:17] the prophet preach, he he's preaching
[1:28:19] from his from his heart, from his soul,
[1:28:21] trying to reach a people
[1:28:24] to give them something that will be
[1:28:26] eternal in their lives
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; and a seed that that will grow in you.
[1:28:29] You know, I heard the prophet say the
[1:28:30] other day, you know, I'm not here to
[1:28:32] judge you. I'm here to help you. I'm
[1:28:35] here to bring forth the word that that
[1:28:36] God has given me to present to you that
[1:28:39] you might grow in grace and grow in love
[1:28:41] one another that you might have
[1:28:43] something in you that others will desire
[1:28:46] to have as well.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; The thumb will say, "Brother, I just
[1:28:50] love being around you. There's something
[1:28:51] about you. There's an anointing. There's
[1:28:53] a spirit around you that I want to be
[1:28:56] with you for eternity.
[1:28:59] I was thinking of Jesus Christ when he
[1:29:01] had gone whipped 39 times. He'd been
[1:29:04] whipped. All that he had suffered, you
[1:29:06] know, all that he went through, he
[1:29:07] should have been dead by now.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; All that burden, all that blood he had
[1:29:12] lost should have been dead by now.
[1:29:16] The suffering, the burden, just the
[1:29:18] pressure of life and having to carry his
[1:29:20] own cross
[1:29:22] to his own death. And I thought that
[1:29:24] when they put him on the cross, you
[1:29:26] know, he he he uh they put nails in him,
[1:29:30] they added more infliction upon what he
[1:29:33] was already carrying. And I thought only
[1:29:36] God's son could endure such punishment,
[1:29:39] such such pain. But then I got to
[1:29:41] thinking, he couldn't die yet.
[1:29:45] He hadn't reached the last soul yet.
[1:29:48] There was still one soul that had to
[1:29:49] come in.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; It was a dark, cloudy day. Satan and his
[1:29:53] angel had gathered together to see this
[1:29:55] Jesus crucified. It was a dark cloud, a
[1:29:58] dark thick moment. It was it looked like
[1:30:00] a time of depression that the son of God
[1:30:02] was about to be crucified and all of
[1:30:04] Satan's angels had showed up at Calvary
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; to see him get crucified.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; But Jesus couldn't die because he had
[1:30:12] one more soul to reach.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; His job wasn't done yet. And I think
[1:30:18] today he hasn't come for his bride
[1:30:20] because there's still one more soul left
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; that needs to be reached.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about that that that
[1:30:27] thief on the cross, you know, when when
[1:30:28] when he came he he came in a borrowed
[1:30:32] vessel. He he had to be born in Mary. He
[1:30:34] he was he was born in a borrowed
[1:30:38] uh manger.
[1:30:41] When when he died, he had a borrowed
[1:30:43] tomb to be buried. And then when he gets
[1:30:46] ready to get crucified, he's hung
[1:30:47] between two thieves.
[1:30:50] And in some parts of the scripture, it
[1:30:51] says that they both rallled upon him.
[1:30:54] And I was thinking about one there on
[1:30:56] the right that maybe when he was growing
[1:30:58] up, his his mama told him, "Son, one day
[1:31:01] God is going to send a king, a savior
[1:31:05] for his people, and he'll be a king to
[1:31:07] to to us and he'll restore our kingdom."
[1:31:10] And maybe that that young man as he was
[1:31:12] growing up he he heard the message but
[1:31:14] you know somewhere in life maybe he got
[1:31:16] away from God got successful. You know
[1:31:18] sometimes we think that being successful
[1:31:20] is a sign from God
[1:31:23] and we think that you know I got to work
[1:31:24] more. I can't be in church because I
[1:31:26] have to work. When you put anything
[1:31:28] before God
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; you're creating a God church. That's
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And this young man through life he maybe
[1:31:34] he got away so away from God that he
[1:31:36] became a criminal.
[1:31:38] one of the best criminals.
[1:31:41] My dad used to say, "Man, if you're
[1:31:42] going to be something good, be the best
[1:31:43] at it. You're going to be the janitor,
[1:31:45] be the best janitor. If you're going to
[1:31:47] be the best musician, be the best, but
[1:31:50] do it from your heart for the Lord and
[1:31:52] give him your all. You're going to be a
[1:31:53] worshipper, be the best worshipper."
[1:31:57] And this young man, he he's there on the
[1:31:59] cross. And then another scripture says
[1:32:00] that when he when he's seen the other
[1:32:02] one rallying him against him, he said,
[1:32:03] "Hey, what's wrong with you? Why do you
[1:32:05] think we're here? We deserve to be here.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Look, look at our lives, the choices
[1:32:11] that that we made, it led us to be
[1:32:13] crucified as well. We deserve what we
[1:32:15] getting.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; But this man,
[1:32:19] he's innocent. He's done nothing. And I
[1:32:21] was thinking maybe that when they nailed
[1:32:24] the sign in his car that said king of
[1:32:25] the Jews,
[1:32:27] maybe that thief, remember what his mama
[1:32:29] had said, one day guy is going to send a
[1:32:33] king to his people and he'll be their
[1:32:36] savior. And when he sees that sign,
[1:32:39] maybe he says, "This is the one." And he
[1:32:42] looks to him and he says, "Remember me
[1:32:46] when you come into your kingdom."
[1:32:49] And Jesus says, "This day you will be
[1:32:52] with me in my kingdom."
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; He had reached his last soul.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; And when he did, he went home, church.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; We're we're still here for a reason. You
[1:33:02] know, the rapture should have taken
[1:33:03] place a long time ago.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; After all that, we've been preaching all
[1:33:06] these years, all these quotes. You know,
[1:33:07] it should have happened a long time ago,
[1:33:09] church. But it seemed that as the time
[1:33:11] to get more extended, the churches get
[1:33:13] more emptier.
[1:33:15] people get more colder, find more
[1:33:18] reasons to to not go to church, you
[1:33:20] know, and they don't like the way the
[1:33:21] pastor preach, you know, or agree to him
[1:33:23] in the line and all that. And after a
[1:33:25] while, they get so cold. And after a
[1:33:27] while, you know, the pastor is
[1:33:28] struggling
[1:33:30] with the peoples. Now, I'm not saying
[1:33:32] here, don't don't misjudge me. I'm just
[1:33:35] saying in general, it's a battle church.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; It's a battle. But we have the assurance
[1:33:43] God promised he was going to have a
[1:33:45] bride in this last hour.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; When the last message is preached, when
[1:33:50] the last soul is preached, church, God
[1:33:52] is coming for his bride.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; He sent us a prophet with a glorious
[1:33:59] message.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Glorious message, church. You know, and
[1:34:02] when you the more you hear it, the more
[1:34:04] you ought to fall in love with Jesus.
[1:34:06] Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; The more you should be inspired, you
[1:34:08] know, because you'll find yourself in
[1:34:10] that message that was meant for you,
[1:34:12] church. You You can go to any church you
[1:34:14] want, big mega churches, you know, and
[1:34:16] they they spend half of the time singing
[1:34:18] and lights flashing. When it comes time
[1:34:19] to preaching, it's a real simple
[1:34:21] message, but this message was preached
[1:34:24] to to prepare a people.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; We we we should be the most educated,
[1:34:29] spiritual people upon the face of the
[1:34:31] earth because we've been given a
[1:34:32] glorious message, church. a glorious
[1:34:35] message.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord this morning?
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; We we are living in a time where we have
[1:34:43] a a weak generation but a very smart
[1:34:45] generation.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You know our kids today they they come
[1:34:50] up with some phrases like where did they
[1:34:52] get that phrase from? When I was young I
[1:34:53] never said stuff like that. And one day
[1:34:56] my grandson walked into the house. We're
[1:34:57] having a celebration. Three years old
[1:34:59] and he walks in. He goes, "What's going
[1:35:02] on here?"
[1:35:04] We're like, "None of your business,
[1:35:05] boy." You know, language of of he he
[1:35:08] says things, you know, and he holds you
[1:35:10] accountable for things, you know.
[1:35:13] You know, I made a promise to my
[1:35:14] grandson, you know, and I told him I
[1:35:15] I'll fulfill my promise if you do such
[1:35:17] and such. Well, he didn't do such and
[1:35:19] such, so he didn't get the promise. You
[1:35:21] know what he told me? But grandpa, you
[1:35:23] promised me. I go, "Yes, I did, but you
[1:35:26] didn't do your part." And when we don't
[1:35:28] do our part, God can't fulfill his
[1:35:30] promise if we're not in our part,
[1:35:32] church.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Now, in order
[1:35:37] in redeeming sickness,
[1:35:39] in order in redeeming, Barraham says,
[1:35:41] "Now, in order in redeeming sickness,
[1:35:44] we'll have to apply sickness as a result
[1:35:46] of sin." Sin sickness is not something
[1:35:49] your you your sin direct, but the
[1:35:52] sickness that you have is indirect.
[1:35:54] Maybe you inherit it from sick from sins
[1:35:57] of your parents or your forefathers.
[1:36:00] Each generation gets weaker and wiser
[1:36:03] because we inherit the differences and
[1:36:06] the sickness and the diseases of the
[1:36:08] body as it keeps handing down from
[1:36:10] generation.
[1:36:11] One one man was made and he lived almost
[1:36:14] a thousand years. Next one he come down
[1:36:17] it shortened his days keep shortening
[1:36:19] his days and on down to an average life
[1:36:22] now is around about 40 to 45 years old I
[1:36:25] suppose see we keep getting weaker all
[1:36:27] the time but wiser all the time just to
[1:36:30] fulfill what God's word said was going
[1:36:32] to happen in this last days church
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; now God does not change God cannot grow
[1:36:39] in wisdom we heard this morning the
[1:36:42] first words that he says must be the
[1:36:45] last words because he is the same
[1:36:48] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; And we are so blessed in this hour that
[1:36:53] we have access to God's message, to his
[1:36:56] throne at any hour of the day. You're
[1:36:58] struggling in life, come to the Lord.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; You need something from him, come to the
[1:37:03] Lord. Seek him. You You feel tired and
[1:37:06] weary and depressed, hear a message.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the best answer is listen to a
[1:37:13] message. But the battle is have actually
[1:37:15] going to push the button
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; because the devil tells you, "No, don't
[1:37:19] because your fingers hurting. Don't push
[1:37:21] the button. Just just just think about
[1:37:23] something else." But the minute you push
[1:37:24] that button, you hear the voice of the
[1:37:25] prophet, brother, you begin to be
[1:37:27] blessed
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; because God sent a prophet
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; with the message
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; to bless us, church.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; God, help us to wake up. May we come to
[1:37:39] a place that we are so on fire for the
[1:37:42] Lord that we can't wait to get to
[1:37:44] church.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; How many of you are waiting to be in
[1:37:47] church on Wednesday?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Brother, we ain't even there yet,
[1:37:49] brothers. Give me a break to rest two
[1:37:50] days. No, we should be on fire for the
[1:37:52] Lord church
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; every day seeking him.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; The more you talk to the Lord, the more
[1:37:57] spiritual you become
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; and you start walking in a higher level
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; of spirituality. After a while, you
[1:38:03] don't see the things of the world. You
[1:38:04] just see Jesus. Like when brother Brand
[1:38:07] was at that cafe and they had that
[1:38:09] worldly music playing in the background,
[1:38:11] Babe Paul tells his dad, "Dad, isn't
[1:38:13] that a beautiful song?" And brother Bram
[1:38:15] says, "What song?" The one that's
[1:38:17] playing on the jukebox. He goes, "I
[1:38:19] can't hear it." He goes, "Dad, you are
[1:38:21] so in tune with Jesus that you don't
[1:38:23] hear nothing else." And I thought, "Oh,
[1:38:25] if we could get to that place
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; that all we see is Jesus, nothing
[1:38:30] matters in life. If I didn't get the
[1:38:32] promotion, who cares? I still got Jesus.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; If I can't find you home, who cares? I
[1:38:38] still have Jesus.
[1:38:40] God, help us to want more of Jesus
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; because we need him now more than ever.
[1:38:48] Amen.
[1:38:50] God bless you this evening. Amen. Keep
[1:38:54] pressing on, church. You know, I can't
[1:38:56] promise you that it's going to get
[1:38:57] better. It's probably going to get
[1:38:58] worse.
[1:39:00] That sound like really depressing news.
[1:39:02] It's going to get more worse. You know,
[1:39:04] you're supposed to be encouraging. I am
[1:39:06] encouraging you
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; to get closer to God
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; because we're going to need it, church.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; You know, the little trials come and we
[1:39:12] get so discouraged with little trials.
[1:39:14] What's going to happen when a real trial
[1:39:15] comes?
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; We have to be grounded, church.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And what do we have to be grounded to?
[1:39:20] His word that we've been hearing for
[1:39:21] years.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Our feet have got to be planted in God's
[1:39:26] word.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He has to be living in us, not around
[1:39:30] us.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; You know, I I love feeling the
[1:39:32] anointing. It's beautiful.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; But that anointing has got to be in me,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; not just around us. Amen. And when you
[1:39:39] hear the word of God and it it ignites
[1:39:41] you, makes you want to say, "Wow, I I
[1:39:43] want to keep pressing on."
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Beautiful to hear the word of
[1:39:47] God. Amen. God help us this evening. God
[1:39:50] help you in your journey in life. May
[1:39:52] God bless this church as you move
[1:39:54] forward. Uh I know there's still more
[1:39:56] souls to to bring in here in Tucson.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got loved ones that are not
[1:40:01] serving the Lord. Uh for God there's
[1:40:03] nothing impossible. Claim them in the
[1:40:06] name of Jesus. Amen. God will bring them
[1:40:09] in. How? That's not my job. I just got
[1:40:12] to claim them. Got to believe it.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; You know, he loves them. Bring him in.
[1:40:16] Amen. God help us to show more love and
[1:40:19] to be more like him. I like, you know,
[1:40:21] brother Batman had gone to the point
[1:40:23] where people thought he was Jesus.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Why? It's life. It's not that he had a
[1:40:29] beard and he had, you know, a palm print
[1:40:31] or with nail prints. No, his life, his
[1:40:33] spirit reflected that of Christ. Paul
[1:40:36] said it is no longer me living, but it's
[1:40:38] Christ living in me.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God, help us to be
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; like Christ living in us. Like Paul,
[1:40:46] brother Brandham, like Christ can live
[1:40:48] in us and we can grow stronger.
[1:40:52] Amen. Let us stand to our feet. God
[1:40:53] bless you this evening.
[1:40:57] Pray one for the another. How many of
[1:40:59] you love one another?
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me ask you again. How many of
[1:41:05] you love one another?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Even in our perfections, we have to
[1:41:12] learn to love one another. Amen. As God
[1:41:14] loved us in our imperfections, we have
[1:41:18] to learn to love one another as well.
[1:41:19] Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Nothing outside of love can enter in to
[1:41:23] the kingdom of God. We need more of him.
[1:41:26] Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for
[1:41:27] this day you've given us to have spent
[1:41:30] and Lord honoring the day of the
[1:41:31] resurrection.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful place to have spent in
[1:41:34] your house of worship Lord and with the
[1:41:36] freedom of spirit to to worship and to
[1:41:38] praise you Lord and to rejoice with your
[1:41:40] word and to be reminded even though
[1:41:43] we've heard it before that this is your
[1:41:45] word Lord. Father, we just ask for your
[1:41:47] guidance. Father, speak to our hearts
[1:41:50] when we find ourselves, Lord, uh
[1:41:52] troubled, weary, maybe sad, maybe
[1:41:57] backsliden.
[1:41:58] Father, may we have the knowledge or the
[1:42:01] wisdom to understand that we can still
[1:42:03] call upon you, Lord, and we can say,
[1:42:05] "Father, I'm struggling right now. I'm
[1:42:08] going through trials, Lord, of I can't
[1:42:10] seem to get the victory, but I know your
[1:42:13] victory, Lord. I know you already paid
[1:42:15] the price, Father. I was on your mind in
[1:42:17] the beginning, Father. And I know you
[1:42:19] say in your word that everyone that the
[1:42:21] Father has given you, you have not lost
[1:42:24] one.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm believing, Lord, that I'm one of
[1:42:27] those that have been written, engraved
[1:42:31] in the palm of your hands, Father, and
[1:42:33] in my in simplicity, Lord, my my
[1:42:35] humbleness, Father, I come before you
[1:42:37] with nothing to offer you but my broken
[1:42:41] heart, Lord. Father, take it and shape
[1:42:44] it and mold me and use me. Father, give
[1:42:47] me joy, Father. Let me wake up in the
[1:42:48] morning, Lord, and to be reminded by
[1:42:50] nature that because the sun rises, you
[1:42:52] have risen also, Father, that there's
[1:42:55] life in you. That beyond the river,
[1:42:58] there's a life that awaits us, Father.
[1:43:00] We want to be like you, Father. We want
[1:43:02] to live for you, Lord, and be as close
[1:43:05] as we can, Father. Forgive our sins,
[1:43:08] Lord, our trespasses, our imperfections,
[1:43:10] our sinful ways, Lord. sometimes our
[1:43:12] slothful ways. Forgive us, Father. And
[1:43:15] Lord, just cover us by the precious
[1:43:17] blood of Jesus. Lord, we stand before
[1:43:19] you, Father. We ask all these things for
[1:43:22] this church, Lord, your loved ones, the
[1:43:24] bride across this world. We present him
[1:43:26] in your hands in the precious name of
[1:43:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:30] Amen. God bless you, church.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:37] Thank you
[1:43:41] Jesus
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:46] for the grace that you have

[1:50:48] [Music]
[1:50:50] Amen. I just want to share something
[1:50:51] with you. kept coming through my my mind
[1:50:54] during the service and it was something
[1:50:56] that just
[1:50:58] the freedom that we wanted. We just sang
[1:51:00] about that. There's freedom in his
[1:51:02] presence. There's joy in his presence.
[1:51:03] But we look out. We're singing about
[1:51:05] chains that had us bound,
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; but we're not singing it with our heart.
[1:51:10] And we're still we're still singing like
[1:51:12] we're bound. We're still singing like we
[1:51:14] don't have that joy unspeakable.
[1:51:16] And I was just I was thinking of at our
[1:51:20] wedding when Joy and I got married, we
[1:51:22] we sang a duet and it was something that
[1:51:25] I just stressed about. I couldn't get
[1:51:28] the harmony part and I was like, why did
[1:51:31] I why did I agree to do this? So
[1:51:35] night before the wedding was practicing
[1:51:38] the part instead of thinking about our
[1:51:40] life together. And then the wedding day
[1:51:42] comes and
[1:51:45] I was thinking about this. I'm I I just
[1:51:47] don't want to blow this. It's my wedding
[1:51:49] day and I don't want to get up and blow
[1:51:50] this. So looking at the video
[1:51:52] afterwards, I I felt it, but you could
[1:51:54] see once the song was done. It was just
[1:51:58] like this burden was lifted and I could
[1:52:01] just relax
[1:52:03] and and the rest of the time it was
[1:52:06] wonderful and what I was looking forward
[1:52:08] to on our on our wedding and but I just
[1:52:12] think sometimes we have got that burden
[1:52:14] that's on us. But we started the service
[1:52:17] tonight singing that song. He is our
[1:52:19] peace. Cast all your cares on him.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't need to sing this
[1:52:24] special. I'll do it for you.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; You don't need to fight this fight. I'll
[1:52:28] fight it for you.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; You don't need to carry that load. I'll
[1:52:31] carry it for you." Maybe we just go back
[1:52:34] and sing that song we opened with
[1:52:35] tonight. He's our peace. He's broken
[1:52:38] down every wall.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And cast all your cares on him. There's
[1:52:42] nothing like the presence of the Lord.
[1:52:44] He's here tonight. I mean, just let it
[1:52:46] let go. Let Jesus this evening,
[1:52:50] he is our peace
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:56] who has broken down every wall.
[1:53:02] Lord, you're my peace.
[1:53:05] You are my peace.
[1:53:10] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:53:12] You are
[1:53:14] my peace. Peace.
[1:53:20] You are my peace.
[1:53:25] You have broken down
[1:53:28] every wall.
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:34] You are my peace.
[1:53:41] Lord, you are my peace.
[1:53:47] Cast your cares on him tonight. Oh, just
[1:53:50] cast all your cares on him.
[1:53:57] For he cares for you.
[1:54:04] He is our peace.
[1:54:09] Lord, you are my peace. You are my
[1:54:14] peace.
[1:54:18] Oh, just cast all your cares
[1:54:23] on him.
[1:54:27] He car for you.
[1:54:33] [Music]

[1:54:40] All he is
[1:54:43] our peace.

[1:58:40] the the the Andre family wants prayer
[1:58:42] because their children are going back to
[1:58:44] school and so we want to pray for them
[1:58:46] and we'll just have all the young people
[1:58:48] come forward and the parents behind
[1:58:49] them, the elders, everyone come forward
[1:58:51] and just pray for uh these ones.
[1:58:58] You're in school, just come right on
[1:59:00] forward. Just pray the prayer of faith
[1:59:02] over all of our children, our young
[1:59:05] people, fathers, mothers.
[1:59:10] You don't have to come forward, but if
[1:59:11] you're a brothers, mother, just come
[1:59:14] forward and pray. Thank you, brother
[1:59:15] Mark. Why don't you lead us in prayer?
[1:59:17] Come forward.
[1:59:19] We'll all bow our heads. These are our
[1:59:21] young people, and they need the the Lord
[1:59:24] Jesus to watch over them.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; And um and he's the one that watches
[1:59:29] over our children. and the dangers that
[1:59:31] are out there. We don't see them, but we
[1:59:35] need the Lord Jesus. And um and he's the
[1:59:39] one who cares for our children. Amen. He
[1:59:42] cares for our families.
[1:59:44] There's a lot of there was I just heard
[1:59:46] a not a testimony, a story just
[1:59:49] yesterday of this family that lost their
[1:59:53] little one that had gone away, was
[1:59:54] missing, and they found him. He had
[1:59:56] drowned in the neighbor's pool there.
[1:59:59] just think of a family to lose a family
[2:00:02] member like that. And so we know it's
[2:00:04] not our strength and our wisdom that
[2:00:06] watches over our children. It's the Lord
[2:00:08] Jesus Christ.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; And I say, Lord, please don't take your
[2:00:11] hand off of my life, over my children's
[2:00:15] life, over our ministry, whatever we
[2:00:18] think we're secure.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, please
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; don't take your hand off of me.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; We need that. So we'll just pray for
[2:00:28] don't we love our one another? We love
[2:00:30] our children. We just ask God to bless
[2:00:32] them. Brother Mark, why don't you
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; let us bow our heads? Heavenly Father, I
[2:00:38] always remember the scripture when you
[2:00:39] were preaching and the children wanted
[2:00:40] to see you and they came to you but the
[2:00:42] disciples pushed them back.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, it displeased you and you said
[2:00:46] suffer the little ones to come unto me
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; because the kingdom is theirs too,
[2:00:51] Father. And Lord, in this hour, there is
[2:00:54] a bride that you are preparing, Lord,
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; with your word, Father. And the bride
[2:00:59] has children, Lord, that we we've got to
[2:01:01] send them to school in such a perverse
[2:01:03] hour, Lord. But, Father, we're not
[2:01:05] trusting in the system. We're trusting
[2:01:07] in you, Father. And we're taking them,
[2:01:09] Lord. We're saying, Father, you've given
[2:01:11] them to us, but now we're giving them
[2:01:12] back to you in the name of Jesus.
[2:01:14] Father, when they wake up in the morning
[2:01:16] to go to school, may they feel their
[2:01:18] angel, the anointing that goes with
[2:01:20] them, Father. other when they're in
[2:01:22] school and they would want to do
[2:01:23] something wrong, may the angel remind
[2:01:25] them, you are a child of God.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; I've been sent to watch you, to watch
[2:01:30] and protect you, Lord. Give them grace,
[2:01:32] Father, in their classes, Lord. Give
[2:01:34] them wisdom, Father. Give them a
[2:01:36] testimony that other children can see
[2:01:38] that they are different, Lord. And they
[2:01:41] are different, Father, because they're
[2:01:42] not from this world, Lord. Bless the
[2:01:45] parents. Give them grace, wisdom, trust,
[2:01:48] Lord, to trust in you, Father. We've
[2:01:51] committed our children into your hands,
[2:01:52] Lord. Watch over them and protect them,
[2:01:54] Father, in the precious name of Jesus.
[2:01:57] Lord, we ask all these things. Amen. God
[2:02:01] bless you.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. God be with you.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
