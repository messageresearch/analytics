[0:37] [Music]
[0:42] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?
[0:45] Another beautiful day in the house of
[0:46] the Lord. Let's open up in prayer.
[0:50] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to

[0:55] our right mind, Father, and a healthy
[0:58] body, Lord, and knowing anything uh
[1:02] contrary, Lord, that you would overcome.
[1:05] Thank you for healing us, Lord. Thank
[1:07] you for the blood of Jesus. Father, all
[1:11] things have passed away and all things
[1:13] have become new. You've made us new
[1:15] creatures in Christ, Father. You're not
[1:18] just a patchup job, but a a new unit and
[1:21] we're grateful for that, Father. be with
[1:24] us in this Sunday school class and for
[1:26] the children and theirs, Lord.
[1:28] Everything that would be done this day,
[1:31] Lord, the preaching of your word. We
[1:33] pray, Lord, that your Holy Spirit would
[1:35] just rest upon everyone, Lord. Give us
[1:38] that spirit of worship for you seek such
[1:40] to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[1:44] Lord, and we'll give you all the glory.
[1:46] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:48] ask. Amen.
[1:51] We're going to be continuing with the uh
[1:54] message future home of the earth,
[1:57] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:59] bride. We'll start at paragraph 125 and
[2:03] end after 181. And this comes from the
[2:06] scripture second Peter chapter 3, the
[2:08] whole chapter in Revelation 21 1-7.
[2:13] Can we sing only believe?
[2:16] Only
[2:18] believe.
[2:21] Only
[2:23] believe.
[2:24] [Music]
[2:27] All things are possible.
[2:32] Only
[2:34] believe.
[2:37] Only
[2:38] believe.
[2:42] Only
[2:44] believe.
[2:47] All things are possible.
[2:52] Only
[2:56] &gt;&gt; you may be seated, brother Brandham.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; See the earth redeemed goes back to its
[3:05] original owner again.
[3:09] It took he took it from Satan. He pulled
[3:13] taken the earth away from Satan just
[3:15] like he took you away from Satan.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Like he took the little woman at the
[3:19] well away from Satan.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; There stood the priest thought he was
[3:23] with God and he had nothing.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; See, I'd like to draw that for you just
[3:29] a moment.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Now, we want to get this real clear. So
[3:37] now watch close now on this teacher.
[3:53] Now this shirt here is God. God which is
[3:59] the eternal
[4:01] without there's no one but him. But in
[4:04] God he had attributes.
[4:07] Now this here represents the word,
[4:10] the word of God which is made flesh to
[4:12] dwell among us in the person of Jesus.
[4:16] Now this year fellow here we're going to
[4:19] make him like this.
[4:28] Now this is called the woman at the
[4:32] well. This is the priest Pharisee and
[4:35] where you see this open blackboard means
[4:38] grace and salvation. Now in the
[4:41] beginning was the word
[4:45] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[4:46] among us.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; The three stages it was an attribute
[4:50] first was in God that he thought of
[4:52] himself as being human and that
[4:55] transmitted him down to be Jesus.
[4:59] Now, if you'll ever be there,
[5:02] you was with him then.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; For there's only one form of eternal
[5:08] life.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; And you had to be a part of God at the
[5:15] beginning.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Not what you just chose down here. He
[5:21] chose you.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Now look at this preacher. We find his
[5:28] bottom part here, his back life. Back
[5:30] behind him is predestination back here
[5:32] is sinful. Here's hell down here. Now
[5:36] this little part in here looks like the
[5:38] blackboard that represents is purity. He
[5:42] was a priest. He was an honorable man.
[5:45] That represented this.
[5:48] He was also had to be a good man or he
[5:51] couldn't be a priest.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; But you see how he got it was
[5:54] intellectual learning. Yeah.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Now, this little woman, her first life
[5:58] up here, she's a prostitute. She was all
[6:01] marred up. But way down in here with
[6:04] just a little bit of understanding. I
[6:06] know when Messiah cometh.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; That was there. Notice when Jesus came
[6:12] and manifested the word because the word
[6:15] discerned the thoughts that was in the
[6:16] heart as Hebrews 4 uh says it will 4:12
[6:22] that he would the word was a discerner
[6:25] of the thoughts of the heart and he came
[6:27] as the son of man the prophet what
[6:29] happened this priest with only
[6:32] intellectual learning said it's a devil
[6:36] &gt;&gt; because that's what his denomination
[6:38] called it.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; What did he do? He had no
[6:40] representation, so it blacked him out.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; But this little woman had nothing to
[6:45] present. She's as filthy and dirty as
[6:47] she could be.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; But notice way down in her,
[6:52] she's got representation.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; And then she was looking for this to be
[6:59] made flesh.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; And when he said, "Go get your husband
[7:03] and come here." She said, "Sir, I have
[7:04] not." Said, you said the truth cuz you
[7:07] got five and one you have now. It's not
[7:09] yours. You've had five. That makes six
[7:10] you had.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; She said, "Sir, you're not be ely
[7:17] &gt;&gt; I perceive that you are a prophet."
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Now, we know the Messiah which is called
[7:22] Christ will come.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; And when he does, he'll do this.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm he."
[7:29] &gt;&gt; No more doubt.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; It saw it.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Away she went. Why? What did it do to
[7:38] her? It redeemed her.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Now watch. He came to be a redeemer.
[7:44] That's right.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; What does redeem mean? Bring back.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he get the priest? He never
[7:48] was up there.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; See, he had no representation.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that which had fallen.
[7:58] Paul, this got messed up with that girl.
[8:00] But God had her in his thinking before
[8:03] the foundation of the earth. And he come
[8:05] to cleans her. Hallelujah.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Then he shut. Why? See where the priest,
[8:11] what did it do to him? It sent him right
[8:12] back to his destination.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; He had nothing to be good. Only
[8:16] intellectual learning.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Now listen, friend. If the only thing
[8:20] you've got is just intellectual
[8:22] learning. You get something different
[8:24] from that.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; And you'll never be able to get it
[8:26] unless you got representation.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I believe you come
[8:33] from the east and west, north and south.
[8:35] Amen.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; The were living made manifest.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Notice now
[8:42] &gt;&gt; how he makes his way known by his
[8:44] prophets in the beginning. He's never
[8:47] changed it.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Salvation. He justified a man,
[8:55] sanctified him, sent the Holy Ghost and
[8:57] fire, burnt the sin out of him and dwelt
[8:59] in him himself. He does the earth that
[9:02] he's going to use in a plan of
[9:03] redemption the same way. It repented and
[9:05] was baptized in water in it by Noah.
[9:08] Jesus come and sanctified it by dripping
[9:11] his blood upon it and claimed it. And in
[9:13] the new earth is to come. It's to have a
[9:15] holy fire baptism to clean it of every
[9:18] devil, every germ, every sickness.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Everything that there is and make it a
[9:22] new.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; You become a new person.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Not just an old one patched up. by
[9:34] joining church or trying to turn a new
[9:36] page,
[9:37] &gt;&gt; but you are a complete brand new unit.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; God takes the old man and burns him
[9:45] completely out
[9:46] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost and fire and it
[9:48] comes himself.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Sends down your representation.
[9:53] No man can come to me except my father
[9:55] has drawn
[9:56] &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will
[9:59] come to me.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; You see it? Amen.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Same plan, same weight. Satan was will
[10:08] be taken from the earth.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Just exactly like Satan was taken from
[10:13] you.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot
[10:18] bother or he can tempt. But he cannot
[10:20] get a bornag again Christian.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; For God from the foundation of the world
[10:27] foresaw him
[10:28] &gt;&gt; and sent Jesus to redeem him. And the
[10:31] blood speaks fine.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; How can he sin when it can't be seen
[10:36] even by God?
[10:38] &gt;&gt; He don't even The only thing he hears is
[10:40] your voice.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; He sees your representation.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; See,
[10:50] &gt;&gt; by the same means for the world is one
[10:54] of his attributes
[10:56] just the same as you are one of his
[10:57] attributes. Amen.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; The world becomes one of his attributes
[11:02] because it was God's thinking
[11:04] &gt;&gt; in the beginning to have a world
[11:07] &gt;&gt; to be on a throne
[11:09] &gt;&gt; to be a king to be a redeemer
[11:11] &gt;&gt; to be a healer.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; That's his attributes.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Just like an attribute of you. I can't
[11:18] say a post less I think a post.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; I can't say man less I think a man.
[11:25] That's right.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; And when I think a man then say man, the
[11:29] thinking is my attribute and the
[11:31] expression is a word.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; See like Isaiah,
[11:38] how could he say that a virgin was going
[11:40] to conceive?
[11:42] &gt;&gt; What is a thought? Now many of you
[11:44] wonder how them that discernment comes.
[11:47] I'm going to tell you. See, it's a word
[11:51] that I say and it isn't my thinking
[11:53] because I don't know.
[11:56] I don't know the thinking of it. How can
[11:58] I tell you who you are and where you
[11:59] come from when I don't know you?
[12:01] &gt;&gt; How can I tell you what you done 10
[12:02] years ago and I never seen in my life?
[12:04] &gt;&gt; How can I tell you where you do and what
[12:06] you'll do 10 years from now? How do I
[12:08] know the future? But it is somebody
[12:10] else's thought.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Let the mind that was in Christ be in
[12:15] you.
[12:20] Let the mind that was in Christ be in
[12:22] you.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; See, then it isn't your thinking.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; And you're not expressing your own
[12:31] words, you're expressing his words.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; That's how many times a brethren gets
[12:35] confused on interpretation of tongues
[12:37] and things. See, they say things that's
[12:39] not right. They don't realize that
[12:40] that's Satan.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; You say in the garden of God, just wait
[12:44] till we get through.
[12:46] find out if it's not or not. The weeds
[12:48] and the wheat grow in the same field.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; They both live by the same sun in the
[12:52] same rain.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; But if there be one among you who's a
[12:57] prophet, I the Lord will speak to him.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; And if what he says happens, then that's
[13:02] me.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Course he's not expressing his own.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; He's expressing my thoughts. My
[13:08] attributes are the things that has to
[13:10] come. I'll use his mouth to express them
[13:12] by. And after he said them, they've got
[13:14] to come to pass.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but my
[13:19] word shall never fail.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[13:23] That settles it. She's going to
[13:24] conceive. What God said, he does.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, make known by his prophets all of
[13:31] his manifestations because it's his
[13:33] attributes of his thoughts expressed.
[13:35] Now, here was this little woman. She was
[13:38] one of his attributes. Amen.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; See, and there was a priest representing
[13:43] the light.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; He had learned it from the Bible. He had
[13:47] learned that God was God. He had learned
[13:50] that holiness is right. He was learned
[13:52] that there was a law of God. He had
[13:54] learned it because of an intellectual
[13:56] conception. And he was born in the right
[13:58] lineage. He was a Levite. But he only
[14:01] know it by intellectual conception.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; And when the light of the hour, see, he
[14:07] learned it. what had happened,
[14:10] &gt;&gt; not what was happening,
[14:12] &gt;&gt; what had happened.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; And when he found what was happening,
[14:17] his denomination said nothing about it.
[14:20] Therefore, you had no representation of
[14:22] it.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; But here was a redeemer on earth at that
[14:25] time to redeem those attributes of God.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; And she received it.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; She never questioned it.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; She said, "When Messiah come and say,
[14:34] you'll do this now. Settle it."
[14:36] &gt;&gt; And she's seen it done. So he said, "I'm
[14:38] the Messiah." So that's settling.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; No more questions. She's what telling
[14:41] everybody else, "Come see who you are
[14:43] found."
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; These processes make us clean a temple
[14:48] for his dwelling place. Justification,
[14:51] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[14:53] Ghost with fire that does the cleansing
[14:56] of this temple. So as old world frame
[15:01] did not destroy by the waters when it
[15:04] was washed off. the frame of the planet,
[15:10] the old frame,
[15:13] the all the dirt, all the uh stuff that
[15:17] God put on the earth was not destroyed
[15:21] when the first world was destroyed in
[15:23] the Bible said it was destroyed.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; But it never destroyed the frame.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; It just destroyed the sin and sinners
[15:32] that was on it. Amen.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; The framework remained. But you see, as
[15:37] justification, as you baptism Methodists
[15:40] want to think of it, just justification,
[15:43] believing and being baptized, that's not
[15:45] enough.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; You wander right back into the things
[15:49] world, blob your hair and wear shorts
[15:50] and everything else.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing happened yet.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; You just look back and seen you done
[15:56] wrong.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; What did justification do to the world?
[16:02] never done a thing to it. Started right
[16:04] off again. Just as much sin as it ever
[16:06] was.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; That's the way a man does. And that's
[16:09] all the farther he goes.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; That's way the great evangelist Billy
[16:12] Graham to see. He said, "I'll go and
[16:14] have 30,000 converts come back in a year
[16:16] and a got 30."
[16:17] &gt;&gt; That's all the farther they went.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; See, they surely they repent. I believe
[16:24] they repent. Most of them or some of
[16:26] them at least. But that isn't what it
[16:28] takes. It proves it here. Now, so the
[16:32] old world framework was not destroyed by
[16:34] the water. The world was only washed
[16:36] off.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; That got us baptism.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; It was baptized.
[16:42] So will the framework remain though it
[16:45] be burnt by fire.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; It don't destroy the earth. See, it just
[16:51] destroys the sin that's on it.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Notice here some of you Bible students,
[16:56] especially Dr. Dale, looking at me.
[16:58] Notice in Peter in the second chapter of
[17:00] Peter your third chapter rather he uses
[17:02] the word world as a Greek word cosmos
[17:07] which means the world order
[17:10] the earth shall pass away melt the
[17:14] elements with fervent heat. See, doesn't
[17:16] mean that the earth, the planet's going
[17:18] to pass away, but the world cosmos, the
[17:21] politics, the sinners, the systems, sin,
[17:25] disease, germs, everything that's wrong
[17:28] will pass away.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Everything that once God shook the
[17:33] heavens, but this time he said he'll
[17:34] shake the earth,
[17:35] &gt;&gt; heavens and earth, he shook the earth
[17:37] rather than this time he'll shake the
[17:38] heavens.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; See, for we receive a kingdom that
[17:41] cannot be moved.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; It's a eternal kingdom. Watch how it
[17:45] goes to it. Notice here Peter said, "And
[17:48] will melt with fervent heat, and the
[17:50] works therein
[17:52] burn up."
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Not the planet, the works therein.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; The works of man, all their politicians
[18:00] and their schemes and all their
[18:02] denominations and man-made schemes will
[18:04] all go with it
[18:06] &gt;&gt; when it burns. And and heavens will pass
[18:10] away with a great noise. Did you notice
[18:12] here? Heavens will pass away with great
[18:14] noise. Listen, the whole earth will be
[18:17] on fire and will ignite the gases that's
[18:20] in the earth and explode it.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Talk the Bible said here, Peter said,
[18:26] "And the heavens will pass away and
[18:29] earth with a great noise."
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Such an explosion will rock it. Oh my.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Cause it's got to kill every disease,
[18:38] every thistle, every thorn, everything
[18:40] there is to be done. The fire will burn
[18:42] it up.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; And remember, it's not altogether just a
[18:45] literal fire. It's also a holy fire.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; See, that will take away Satan. All of
[18:52] his,
[18:53] &gt;&gt; all the devils, both heaven and earth,
[18:56] amen,
[18:58] &gt;&gt; will pass away, killing all the germs,
[19:00] all insects, all natural life on it and
[19:03] around it. Even the H2O, the water will
[19:06] explode.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Talk about a noise.
[19:12] You think that little noise I hear in
[19:13] Tucson was something when he opened the
[19:15] six seals that shook the country around
[19:17] about and caused the talk. Wait till
[19:20] this earth receives our baptism.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; You know when a man receives the baptism
[19:26] of fire, there's a lot of noise around
[19:27] there.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; They think that's shame to hear people
[19:31] scream and shout like that. Just wait
[19:32] till this earth gets her baptism.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:37] It'll explain exploit the H2O, the
[19:40] water. For the Bible said here in
[19:41] Revelation 21, and there was no more sea
[19:46] exploit. This will change the whole
[19:49] surface of the entire earth.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; She'll burst and blow to pieces.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; All the outside the crust and for
[19:57] hundreds of feet below it, it'll just
[19:59] simply be completely demolished. That's
[20:02] right.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; The atmospheres, the gases that's in the
[20:06] earth now where they're finding these
[20:08] missiles that can't get to it. A great
[20:10] sphere up in there way up in some kind
[20:12] of a sphere that there's all kinds of
[20:13] gases they say and that'll burst.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; The holy wrath of God will come upon it
[20:21] &gt;&gt; and will cleanse it.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Will change the entire service. Now,
[20:27] many of you won't put on this word, the
[20:29] Greek word pass away.
[20:32] It comes from the word I had to find. I
[20:34] thought, how's this world going to pass
[20:36] away? And yet, we're going to live on
[20:37] it. But if you'll notice, some of you
[20:40] people wants to put it down and I'll
[20:41] spell it for you. I couldn't pronounce
[20:42] it. P A R E R E C H O M I A. I don't
[20:49] know how to pronounce it. Now that way
[20:51] as I said when I get the inspiration
[20:53] strikes me for something
[20:56] then I go back to find out the word now
[20:59] here I can't spell the word I can't I
[21:01] can't pronounce it but in that the Lord
[21:03] is still give me a way I go and find out
[21:06] what that word means then I got it
[21:09] &gt;&gt; then I got it again see heavens and
[21:12] earth will pass away now this word means
[21:15] passing from one form to another
[21:18] &gt;&gt; it does not mean annihilation
[21:21] as the English word would mean pass
[21:23] away. It's annihilated. But the Hebrew
[21:25] word or the Greek word here does not
[21:27] mean pass away. It means from passing
[21:30] from one thing to another. Look, but to
[21:33] pass from one condition, it says to
[21:35] another. Now notice Paul used it. If you
[21:38] want to read it now, put it down, you
[21:39] can read it later. And Titus 3:5, Paul
[21:43] is using this same word means
[21:46] regeneration of man. that man has passed
[21:49] from a sinner to a saint.
[21:52] Not completely annihilated. When a man's
[21:55] changed, he isn't annihilated, but he's
[21:57] a changed person.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; He's been changed from what he was to
[22:01] what he is.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Not annihilating. Jesus used the same
[22:06] word in Matthew 19:28.
[22:10] Now, not 28:19 now. 19:28.
[22:14] He said to them, "You're set with me in
[22:17] my father's kingdom regenerated." You
[22:20] see, changed. When you're changed, he
[22:22] used the same word. And he used the same
[22:25] word when he said to the colt that loose
[22:27] the colt and let him go. Said the same
[22:31] thing at the resurrection of Lazarus.
[22:33] Loose him.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Change him.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; He's been tied. Let him go.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; What does it mean? The earth will be
[22:43] loose from the grip of Satan.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; It'll be loose. It'll be loose from
[22:49] politics. It'll be loose from
[22:50] denominational religious systems
[22:52] &gt;&gt; to be used for the kingdom of God
[22:55] &gt;&gt; to be established here on the earth. But
[22:59] as long it's in the hands of Satan,
[23:01] politics, Satan the ruler of the earth,
[23:03] he owns it. It belonged to him. But now
[23:05] Christ has redeemed it.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; One time I was his property, but not
[23:09] now. That's right.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; One time that little woman was his
[23:12] property, but not now.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; He come to loose the grip of it.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; He loosed the grip of sin, of Satan upon
[23:19] my life, upon your life, and now we're
[23:22] not his

[33:32] Then I fell down at his feet and they
[33:36] came so sweet. Now

[50:20] Lord Jesus, for this preaching of the
[50:23] word that is going to be coming before
[50:25] us. May the sounding go out. May it fill

[53:53] Come
[53:55] in thy strength and thy power.
[54:03] Won't you come
[54:06] in your own special
[54:10] way?
[54:15] There's nothing like the presence,
[54:20] nothing like the presence,
[54:25] nothing like the presence of the Lord.
[54:31] Oh,
[54:34] nothing like the presence.
[54:38] There's nothing like the presence.
[54:43] Nothing like the presence of the Lord.
[54:50] There's joy in the presence. There is
[54:52] joy in the presence.
[54:56] Yes, there's joy in the presence.
[55:01] There's joy in the presence of the Lord.
[55:10] There is joy in the presence.
[55:14] Yes, there's joy in the presence.
[55:19] There is joy
[55:21] in the presence of the Lord. And how
[55:25] many can say this morning, there's
[55:26] freedom in his presence? There is
[55:29] freedom in his presence.
[55:33] There is freedom in his presence.
[55:37] There is freedom in the presence of the
[55:42] Lord.
[55:45] [Music]
[55:46] There is freedom in the presence.
[55:51] Yes, there's freedom in the presence.
[55:56] There's freedom in the presence. One
[56:00] more time. There's nothing like his
[56:02] presence. Oh no, there is nothing like
[56:07] the presence.
[56:10] There's nothing like the presence.
[56:14] There's nothing like the presence of the
[56:19] Lord.
[56:23] Oh, there's nothing like the presence.
[56:28] There is nothing like the presence.
[56:33] There's nothing like the presence of the
[56:38] Lord.
[56:42] I feel Jesus in the room.

[58:29] morning? He's here. He can deliver.

[59:03] Just one last time. I feel Jesus.
[59:06] I feel Jesus in the room.
[59:11] I feel Jesus in the room.
[59:16] I feel Jesus in the room
[59:20] today.
[59:25] And when he's in the room,
[59:30] things won't stay the same.
[59:34] I feel Jesus in the room.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing like the presence.
[59:54] There's nothing like the pres of the
[59:59] Lord.
[1:00:03] There's nothing like the presence.
[1:00:08] There's nothing like the presence
[1:00:16] of the Lord.
[1:00:19] Just one more time as the musicians
[1:00:21] play.
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:30] Have your way, Lord. There's nothing
[1:00:33] like the presence of
[1:00:36] the Lord.
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:44] Hallelujah.

[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:06:00] Amen. How many enjoy the music?
[1:06:03] Praise the Lord. We thank the Lord for
[1:06:05] our musicians.
[1:06:11] Song leader of the worship. Praise the
[1:06:13] Lord. Amen. We come here for to worship
[1:06:17] him in spirit and in truth. We like to
[1:06:20] welcome each of you to the house of the
[1:06:21] Lord. It's always a privilege to be
[1:06:24] gathered together in his in his
[1:06:26] wonderful name. Amen. Are you happy to
[1:06:29] be here? We're so happy to have each of
[1:06:32] you here. So, we pray that God will
[1:06:34] bless you richly.
[1:06:37] We uh will have an announcement at the
[1:06:39] end of the service. So, uh don't leave
[1:06:42] immediately.
[1:06:44] And um for those that are streaming on
[1:06:48] the um book up there, the stream, the
[1:06:52] service will end right towards the end
[1:06:54] there. Don't think it's a dysfunction,
[1:06:57] but uh we'll have an announcement. And
[1:06:59] so the group in Phoenix, we like to uh
[1:07:04] send our greetings to brother Art and
[1:07:06] the saints there. Um, I don't appreciate
[1:07:09] brother Stevie as much as I should
[1:07:11] Stevie Flores, but I was thinking about
[1:07:14] him and his hard work that he, of
[1:07:16] course, we all know brother Art puts in
[1:07:19] a lot of uh he's a very great
[1:07:24] um helper to us and to keep the the work
[1:07:28] going
[1:07:30] in um
[1:07:33] in Mesa and it's really a a commitment
[1:07:36] uh the musician
[1:07:38] you know, you really a lot goes to it.
[1:07:40] And so we appreciate Stevie Flores and
[1:07:43] Sister Angela and all the saints there
[1:07:46] and Mesa. So uh I think Stevie sings a
[1:07:50] special every service on Thursday night.
[1:07:52] Just be two people, five people, 15
[1:07:55] people. He takes time and sings a song
[1:07:58] special. And I certainly appreciate
[1:07:59] that. I was just thinking about him
[1:08:01] today, thinking about each of you. Amen.
[1:08:05] And so, um, let's go right to the word
[1:08:07] of the Lord in the scriptures.
[1:08:13] Also, I thank the Lord for the good
[1:08:15] speeds. We don't see them, but they
[1:08:17] stream the service, so I just wanted to
[1:08:20] say hi to them.
[1:08:23] And why don't you all say hi to them.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Good speeds. Whenever
[1:08:29] they stream, um, they always send their
[1:08:33] support here.
[1:08:34] And um I mean to greet them, but I never
[1:08:37] do. So we'll greet them.
[1:08:41] Now in the
[1:08:43] Old Testament, Genesis chapter 32, we're
[1:08:46] going to take our scripture reading.
[1:08:56] Of course, we know this is the life of
[1:08:58] Jacob
[1:09:01] and his life leads him to this place
[1:09:04] that we find him here.
[1:09:09] In verse number
[1:09:19] 20,
[1:09:29] verse number 22, we'll just start right
[1:09:32] in the middle there.
[1:09:36] And he rose up that night and took his
[1:09:38] two wives and his two women servants and
[1:09:43] his 11 sons and passed over the Ford
[1:09:48] Jabbok. And he took them and sent them
[1:09:51] over the brook and sent over
[1:09:55] that he had.
[1:09:57] And Jacob was left alone.
[1:10:00] And there wrestled a man with him until
[1:10:02] the breaking of the day.
[1:10:05] And when he saw that he prevailed not
[1:10:07] against him, he touched the hollow of
[1:10:09] his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's
[1:10:12] thigh was out of joint as he wrestled
[1:10:15] with him.
[1:10:17] And he said, "Let me go, for the day
[1:10:19] breakth." And he said, "I will not let
[1:10:22] thee go except thou bless me." And he
[1:10:26] said unto him, "What is thy name?" And
[1:10:28] he said, "Jacob."
[1:10:30] And he said, "Thy name shall be called
[1:10:32] no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a
[1:10:36] prince has thou power with God and with
[1:10:38] men, and has prevailed."
[1:10:42] Amen. Take a scripture also in Jeremiah
[1:10:46] 29
[1:10:52] verse number 10.
[1:11:05] When you have that, say, "Amen."
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It's nice to hear the Bible's turning
[1:11:13] pages, turning to the Holy Scripture.
[1:11:17] Verse 10. For thus sayeth the Lord, that
[1:11:19] after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:11:22] Babylon, I will visit you and perform my
[1:11:25] good word toward you, and causing you to
[1:11:28] return to this place. For I know the
[1:11:30] thoughts that I think toward you, saith
[1:11:34] the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of
[1:11:37] evil, to give you an expected end. Then
[1:11:41] shall you call upon me, ye shall go and
[1:11:45] pray unto me, and I will hearken unto
[1:11:48] you, and ye shall seek me and find me
[1:11:53] when ye shall search for me with all
[1:11:56] your heart.
[1:11:59] Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask
[1:12:01] your blessing on your word today. Lord,
[1:12:04] bless me. Bless your people. We know
[1:12:08] your word is already blessed. We know
[1:12:10] that you are the great one. You're the
[1:12:12] lifegiver and you have the power to
[1:12:15] change our circumstance.
[1:12:18] And Lord, just one word from you is all
[1:12:21] any mortal needs.
[1:12:24] Just to hear the words of the heavenly
[1:12:27] father.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, speak to my heart. Speak to our
[1:12:30] hearts today. In the mighty name of
[1:12:33] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God bless
[1:12:36] you.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. May he speak to
[1:12:39] our hearts and may we listen.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:45] I think they're trying to still work on
[1:12:46] my mic there. Now, in the scripture,
[1:12:51] there is known in the book of Jeremiah
[1:12:56] 30:7
[1:12:58] uh called Jacob's trouble. Alas, for
[1:13:01] that day is great, so that none is like
[1:13:03] it. It is even the time of Jacob's
[1:13:07] trouble, but he shall be saved out of
[1:13:10] it. Now, Brother Brandham makes a
[1:13:12] reference to that scripture or that
[1:13:15] phrase Jacob's trouble, and he calls it
[1:13:19] and he identifies it with the great
[1:13:21] tribulation.
[1:13:22] We know that up ahead of the road is a
[1:13:27] great tribulation. It's going to fall
[1:13:30] upon the earth and there's all sorts of
[1:13:32] tribulations and judgments that are
[1:13:34] taking place even as we speak. And the
[1:13:38] title of my message this morning is
[1:13:40] something is fixing to happen.
[1:13:44] Something is fixing to happen. And
[1:13:47] that's a fact.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Now the question is what is that
[1:13:50] something?
[1:13:52] Um something's fixing to happen. I'm
[1:13:56] fixing to start preaching.
[1:13:58] Uh, some of you are fixing to start
[1:14:01] sleeping.
[1:14:04] Some of you are fixing to start
[1:14:06] listening.
[1:14:08] But something is fixing to happen. And
[1:14:11] in this great term, Jacob's trouble
[1:14:15] known as the great tribulation. We know
[1:14:18] that is a future event.
[1:14:21] But here Jacob now in his life. How many
[1:14:25] are familiar with the story of Jacob?
[1:14:28] getting the background of what he done
[1:14:31] to lead him to this point here. He's
[1:14:35] actually separating himself from his
[1:14:38] family. He's sending them forward.
[1:14:41] He sends them forward in orders. He
[1:14:45] sends them forward in groups and he has
[1:14:47] to separate himself from them. And I
[1:14:51] like what the scripture says. I think
[1:14:53] it's verse number 24.
[1:14:56] And Jacob was left alone.
[1:15:01] Leave me alone.
[1:15:04] Some of us need that time alone.
[1:15:10] Those precious moments where Jacob was
[1:15:13] left alone.
[1:15:15] And now he's beginning to look at where
[1:15:18] he is today and how he got to where
[1:15:23] to where he is. Let's follow him just a
[1:15:26] moment. Let's look back just what
[1:15:28] brought him to this point. Remember
[1:15:30] Isaac was 60 years old when Jacob and
[1:15:33] Esau were born. They were twins. Esau
[1:15:38] was the firstborn. Jacob was the second
[1:15:42] born. Esau had the birthright. He had
[1:15:45] the blessing. He had all the privileges
[1:15:48] of what a firstborn came with. And Esau
[1:15:53] is uh number one. Jacob is number two in
[1:15:57] the birth order in the family in the
[1:16:00] structure. There was nothing that Jacob
[1:16:03] could do to change his birth order. This
[1:16:06] is the order and this is how you were
[1:16:09] born. And by the way, your name is
[1:16:13] Jacob.
[1:16:16] Then the scripture tells us that in
[1:16:19] Genesis 25
[1:16:22] that um Jacob actually purchases the
[1:16:25] birthright from his brother. Doesn't
[1:16:28] give us a direct age. He was some of the
[1:16:31] the commentaries, some of the scholars,
[1:16:34] some of the traditions say they're in
[1:16:35] their teens about 15 years old or so.
[1:16:38] Doesn't don't know if it matters, but
[1:16:40] they were young people, young men. and
[1:16:44] he sells or purchases his birthright
[1:16:47] from his brother. Then in Genesis 27,
[1:16:52] he's about 70 years old. So he leaves
[1:16:55] from being a teenager to about 70 when
[1:16:58] his dad is about to cross over and he
[1:17:01] steals the blessing from his brother.
[1:17:07] He's got to leave to go to um his family
[1:17:12] because Esau is quite upset.
[1:17:15] His life is in danger. He's 70 years
[1:17:18] old. And this is where he has his first,
[1:17:20] we'd say, one of his major visions of
[1:17:24] the ladder going up and down heaven, the
[1:17:27] angels ascendings and descending.
[1:17:31] He that's in Bethl. He arrives in Haran
[1:17:34] and he meets his wife to be Rachel.
[1:17:39] He marries Leah and Rachel. He's about
[1:17:41] 77 years old at the time.
[1:17:45] He begins to have children from the age
[1:17:48] of 77 to about 90 years old. He's having
[1:17:51] all of these sons, the sons of Israel,
[1:17:54] the sons of Jacob.
[1:17:56] He leaves Laban after 20 years in
[1:17:59] Genesis 31. He's about 90 years old. And
[1:18:04] here we find him at 90 years old,
[1:18:07] Genesis 32, wrestling with the angel of
[1:18:12] the Lord.
[1:18:13] The Bible says it was a man that he was
[1:18:16] wrestling with. Now, Brother Bham takes
[1:18:19] the scripture that we read in Jeremiah
[1:18:22] and he preaches a message entitled
[1:18:24] desperations.
[1:18:25] And he tells us that the reason why
[1:18:28] people are not desperate today is
[1:18:30] because a lack of love
[1:18:33] and that we should be desperate.
[1:18:38] And there's things that should cause us
[1:18:40] to be desperate.
[1:18:43] And after all that God has done for us,
[1:18:47] we really are living in whether you
[1:18:50] believe it or not, whether you receive
[1:18:52] this or not, the church, the world,
[1:18:55] we're living in a state of emergency.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It is really, really dark. We heard it
[1:19:00] on the Sunday school where brother says
[1:19:03] that the atmosphere is filled with
[1:19:04] demons and devils
[1:19:07] and God's got to purify that. Where
[1:19:10] these evil thoughts come from? Where's
[1:19:12] the imagination? Why are we thinking
[1:19:14] these things? How is Hollywood able to
[1:19:17] make these movies and they're so graphic
[1:19:19] and they're so real and and the music
[1:19:22] and the church world and just trying to
[1:19:25] be by yourself. Evil thoughts will come
[1:19:28] to you.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; How many know what I'm talking about?
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; You're filled with the precious Holy
[1:19:34] Ghost. Yes. But the evil, nasty devil
[1:19:37] still tries to anoint your thoughts.
[1:19:39] Amen.
[1:19:41] And we're living in a we're living in a
[1:19:44] a state of emergency. Um I mean if you
[1:19:48] just go back and I did a casual search
[1:19:50] of what our life was like before 911
[1:19:54] and all of the laws that were enacted
[1:19:57] afterwards
[1:19:59] and now today it's just become
[1:20:01] normalized to us the way we travel. We
[1:20:05] the security they they didn't used to
[1:20:07] tap our phone conversations. They didn't
[1:20:10] have the legal right to do it. They
[1:20:12] weren't able to surveillance we uh
[1:20:16] American citizens with our freedoms the
[1:20:18] way they do today. But after 9/11, they
[1:20:21] changed a lot of laws where they can
[1:20:23] watch you without asking for your
[1:20:26] permission. And you don't even know
[1:20:28] you're being watched.
[1:20:30] The average American, the American
[1:20:32] citizen that we're walking around in our
[1:20:34] freedoms and our great freedoms
[1:20:36] everywhere is a video camera watching
[1:20:40] you, watching your steps.
[1:20:43] The airport travel alone. I mean, you
[1:20:47] used to be able to say goodbye to your
[1:20:49] loved ones at the gate. You can't even
[1:20:52] walk them up to the gate to say goodbye.
[1:20:54] You can't bring a drink of water. A
[1:20:56] mother can't bring too much breast milk
[1:20:58] through security.
[1:21:01] You got to take your shoes off. I think
[1:21:03] they just told us we could put our shoes
[1:21:04] back on this year
[1:21:07] just to go through security. It's a
[1:21:09] straight up hassle
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; just to fly on an airplane. And we've
[1:21:14] all they they the Homeland Security they
[1:21:17] called it.
[1:21:20] They enacted these laws
[1:21:23] and they dropped them on us. Americans
[1:21:27] and we're living with it right now as we
[1:21:29] speak.
[1:21:31] They they called it the US Patriot Act,
[1:21:35] the Aviation Transportation Security
[1:21:37] Act, the Homeland Security Act, Enhanced
[1:21:42] Border Security, and the Visa and the
[1:21:45] and even traveling from one country to
[1:21:47] the next has all been heightened. It's a
[1:21:50] great long process and this only really
[1:21:54] affects the noncriminals.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You're talking about putting a gun law
[1:22:02] in in practice. The gun laws are only
[1:22:05] going to hurt the good guys
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; because the criminal ain't going to obey
[1:22:10] the law. I don't care what the law is.
[1:22:13] You can't have a gun. He's like, "Okay,
[1:22:19] a criminal is not listening to no laws.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; The only one it affects are people that
[1:22:25] actually obey the laws."
[1:22:28] This crazy law, I call it crazy, the
[1:22:30] seat belt law. And they're protecting
[1:22:32] us. Put your seat belt on. I was in
[1:22:34] Liberia.
[1:22:36] Every vehicle in Liberia, the windshield
[1:22:38] is cracked.
[1:22:41] Like this way, like this way, like that
[1:22:42] way.
[1:22:44] And I looked over at I didn't ask him
[1:22:45] about the windshield because we can get
[1:22:47] a ticket for that, our safety, right? I
[1:22:51] looked at the brother. I says, "Is there
[1:22:54] any laws for wearing a seat belt?" He
[1:22:56] looked at me and laughed. He says, "Yes,
[1:22:58] we have laws." He says, "But look
[1:23:00] around.
[1:23:02] People on motorcycles, people on any
[1:23:04] kind of vehicle,
[1:23:06] you can't enforce that.
[1:23:09] And by the way, who really cares about
[1:23:11] whether I have my seatelt on or not
[1:23:13] anyways?
[1:23:15] What difference does it make? But it's a
[1:23:16] law. We've we've given that up. All of
[1:23:19] these act the public health and security
[1:23:22] for bioteterrorism and intelligence
[1:23:26] reform because um of this great attack
[1:23:30] that happened on 911 which are coming up
[1:23:33] to its another anniversary to it. Also
[1:23:36] that was my brother Jay's birthday. I
[1:23:38] always remember that September 11th,
[1:23:41] Real ID Act 2005 was put into place.
[1:23:47] This is why, brother John, your birth
[1:23:49] certificate that you had all these years
[1:23:52] is not valid because the G was faded in
[1:23:55] one part of his birth certificate and
[1:23:56] they told him, "No, this is not you need
[1:23:58] to go verify this." Like, man, I feel
[1:24:00] like hitting somebody in their stomach.
[1:24:06] Like, I'm driving. I've been living
[1:24:07] here. I am
[1:24:10] John. What's your middle name? Gregory
[1:24:13] Yarro. That's who I am. But he went to
[1:24:16] renew his passport. I didn't put your
[1:24:17] business out there, John. He went to
[1:24:19] renew his passport. And there's the way,
[1:24:22] you know, the birth certificate was
[1:24:24] creased like that. One little spot where
[1:24:26] the G is. Everything else is correct,
[1:24:28] but the G. And there's another G in the
[1:24:30] front. And you, if you put it together,
[1:24:32] hey, that's a T.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:24:37] enhanced
[1:24:39] security.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; You want to take care and make sure you
[1:24:42] ain't a criminal.
[1:24:46] And
[1:24:48] so we've got along with that. We live
[1:24:49] with that. That happened. And then COVID
[1:24:52] hits in 2000s, right? What year did CO
[1:24:55] hit us?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; 2020, right?
[1:24:59] And after COVID hit,
[1:25:02] there was a direct effect. And I and I
[1:25:05] say it it absolutely went against the
[1:25:07] scriptures for us laying hands on the
[1:25:10] sick and us coming together. And look at
[1:25:14] the crowd of people that stay home
[1:25:18] when they can get in their car and
[1:25:22] actually be in the house of the Lord. We
[1:25:26] have given them the option to stay at
[1:25:28] home and stream the service.
[1:25:31] And not just this service, any service.
[1:25:34] And you can sit in the comfort of your
[1:25:36] home and listen to the pastors from all
[1:25:39] over the world
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; and feed on that
[1:25:46] and find that in the word of God where
[1:25:48] that applies to the little local
[1:25:51] fellowship and how you're supposed to be
[1:25:54] gathering together. That was a direct
[1:25:57] attack. We didn't have a streaming
[1:25:58] service in our church until co that's
[1:26:01] when we developed our ability to stream.
[1:26:04] It is a blessing. Yes, it can be useful.
[1:26:07] Yes. And the saints use it. Yes. But
[1:26:09] there there can be a mentality and an
[1:26:12] abuse with it, too. Let's be real.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Let's let's be for real.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Um some saints travel two hours or more
[1:26:22] to come to gather here. Like they
[1:26:25] they'll travel to come to church here.
[1:26:29] And then there's other saints that live
[1:26:30] right here, including me, including
[1:26:32] whoever live right here. And we have the
[1:26:36] convenience of not being there. Co with
[1:26:41] this mandate that you must stay home,
[1:26:44] that you can't gather, was a nice
[1:26:46] opening
[1:26:49] for you to stay home
[1:26:51] from the house of the Lord. And I want
[1:26:55] you to I want you to show me or prove to
[1:26:58] me any other place of gathering where
[1:27:02] people should gather more important than
[1:27:06] the little local church in your
[1:27:07] neighborhood.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; I mean, think about it in your mind.
[1:27:10] What is what is more important to gather
[1:27:14] at for a group of people?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Think of one.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me. Give me the answer.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Not the movie house. Not over here. some
[1:27:24] theme park, not at the mall.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; We're all going to meet in traffic.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; But there is a place that God designed
[1:27:36] for the Christian to gather together.
[1:27:42] Many Christians will do this here. I
[1:27:44] know I'm not in my space, but I'm in
[1:27:45] your space now. But Christians, many
[1:27:48] Christians will do this right here.
[1:27:49] They'll take a career. They'll take a
[1:27:51] job. They'll take an appointment that
[1:27:54] directly affects
[1:27:57] this place that they should be in the
[1:27:59] house of the Lord. And it used to be the
[1:28:01] old-timers would say, "If you can't be
[1:28:03] in church, you don't need that job."
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; How much time do I got?
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We come to church,
[1:28:15] we sit back,
[1:28:17] we'll judge what's being said,
[1:28:20] we run it through the filter of our
[1:28:22] mind, and every thought you're thinking
[1:28:24] is being recorded.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And every word and every deed will be
[1:28:30] given an account for. It's exactly the
[1:28:32] truth. You all know that's the truth.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; What has it done? has created this
[1:28:38] atmosphere of church people very
[1:28:41] difficult to pastor very difficult to
[1:28:43] worship very difficult to lead very very
[1:28:47] difficult to please
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; we're competing with the internet and
[1:28:53] all that it has to offer
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; and this co made it easier
[1:29:00] they they mandated it
[1:29:04] now if there's a country or the law said
[1:29:06] that you should stay at home, then you
[1:29:09] should give Caesar what Caesars's
[1:29:11] because coming to church doesn't save
[1:29:12] you. We understand that.
[1:29:16] And uh but if there's an opportunity to
[1:29:19] be there, I think that um you should be
[1:29:21] there. I think that should be the
[1:29:23] atmosphere. But it it's been made very
[1:29:26] very easy, very very convenient
[1:29:30] to transgress
[1:29:33] that one little portion there of coming
[1:29:35] together.
[1:29:37] Co allowed that and the laws that were
[1:29:40] changed and all of our thought processes
[1:29:45] when it comes to that. But, you know, I
[1:29:47] love our brother uh that came here and
[1:29:49] spoke a couple of Sundays ago and he he
[1:29:52] took those five planets or what was it?
[1:29:54] Seven planets.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Seven planets that had lined up right
[1:29:57] here in February of this year and lined
[1:30:01] them all up. And then he read a
[1:30:02] quotation where brother Brandham said
[1:30:04] that something is always happening and
[1:30:07] that these things mean something.
[1:30:09] Although we don't know exactly what they
[1:30:11] mean, but they mean something. And then
[1:30:13] you look at the accumulation of the word
[1:30:16] and the darkness of the age that you and
[1:30:19] I live in.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; You know, we can sit in our car and go
[1:30:24] on a long trip for two hours or whatever
[1:30:26] hour or so. We can sit in our bedrooms
[1:30:30] for hours and multiple hours at a time
[1:30:33] doing whatever we do in there.
[1:30:35] We can stand in the kitchen. We can
[1:30:37] stand on the job site for hours and
[1:30:39] hours at a time to get a task done. and
[1:30:42] you come to the house of the Lord and
[1:30:44] you got to get up every 30 minutes and
[1:30:46] leave
[1:30:48] even when the tape is being played.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; They It's background noise to them.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Um the Sunday school starts at 9:45. The
[1:30:59] greatest preacher of our generation is
[1:31:02] being played.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a call to attention
[1:31:08] for the soldiers of the cross,
[1:31:12] Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have time to hear the prophet.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Something is something is off there.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about me. Something is off
[1:31:28] there.
[1:31:32] Now, brother Brandham takes the message
[1:31:34] desperations
[1:31:36] and he uses Jacob as an example.
[1:31:40] In part of that message there, I want to
[1:31:42] read something that he says right here
[1:31:44] in paragraph 52, 1963. Now, I believe
[1:31:49] that we're living in the days or
[1:31:52] otherwise the days that we're living in
[1:31:54] should cause the church to go completely
[1:31:58] into desperation.
[1:32:00] I believe since the message this morning
[1:32:03] from God, not me. I believe it ought to
[1:32:06] throw this entire congregation
[1:32:10] into desperation
[1:32:12] that we have played long enough. We went
[1:32:15] to church long enough. We got to do
[1:32:17] something. How is it that we can see
[1:32:20] other great signs and wonders done on
[1:32:22] others? And what about us? It should
[1:32:24] cause in a state of desperation that we
[1:32:29] are determined before God. The signs of
[1:32:32] his coming should bring this entire
[1:32:36] congregation
[1:32:37] when we read it from the word. The Holy
[1:32:40] Spirit has told us go at a certain place
[1:32:44] such and such a thing will happen. Not
[1:32:46] tell us what it was but it would happen.
[1:32:49] We go there. It happens that way. the
[1:32:52] newspapers packet, the magazines packet,
[1:32:56] shows the picture of it. Come back here
[1:32:59] and see those great mysteries hidden in
[1:33:01] the Bible open to us on a new field that
[1:33:06] we never know before and perfectly
[1:33:09] blends into the coming of the Lord
[1:33:11] Jesus.
[1:33:13] Then at the end of the message, see the
[1:33:15] action of the great Holy Spirit. see him
[1:33:18] come down visible before people. Even
[1:33:21] take pictures of it. See it working and
[1:33:25] showing that it's not a man. It's not
[1:33:28] just a preacher. It's not a certain
[1:33:30] congregation. It's the Holy Spirit
[1:33:34] showing the same thing it did when it
[1:33:37] was embodied in the body of Jesus
[1:33:40] Christ.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Now it's embodied in the body of his
[1:33:45] bride.
[1:33:46] It should throw us into desperation.
[1:33:55] So the prophet of God is now
[1:33:57] highlighting the message the token that
[1:34:00] he preached that morning and now he's
[1:34:02] bringing this message desperation which
[1:34:05] was a communion service message
[1:34:09] and he's highlighting the things that
[1:34:11] had taken place in his ministry
[1:34:14] and it really you know
[1:34:18] if you're not listening to it if you're
[1:34:20] not hearing it You won't be desperate.
[1:34:22] You won't know the signs of the time.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And remember, the signs of the time are
[1:34:29] multiple. There are many signs that take
[1:34:32] place. But the coming of the Lord is a
[1:34:35] secret quick going away.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; When it happens, it happens. When the
[1:34:40] door closes, it closes. But the signs,
[1:34:44] there's years of signs, years of
[1:34:48] warning. like Jacob had years of an
[1:34:52] accumulation
[1:34:54] of these behaviors that he finally had
[1:34:58] to deal with.
[1:35:00] He took from his brother. He deceived
[1:35:02] his daddy. He got the blessing. He
[1:35:06] deceived his father-in-law. He got on.
[1:35:08] He kept moving forward. And God is
[1:35:10] speaking to him. And then finally he
[1:35:12] gets the word that Esau
[1:35:16] is coming to see you with 400
[1:35:21] men.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; They're coming to see you.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; They're not going on vacation.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; I want to meet you. I want to see you. I
[1:35:31] want to talk to you face to face.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; And Esau was a strong man. Esau wasn't
[1:35:37] playing games.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Esau was serious. That message came to
[1:35:42] Jacob and it shook him.
[1:35:45] He had been going along like this too
[1:35:48] long.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; You know, we read the scripture on on
[1:35:52] Wednesday, the effectual fervent prayer
[1:35:54] of a righteous man availth much. Brother
[1:35:56] Brandham says the effectual fervent
[1:35:58] prayer is a prayer of desperation.
[1:36:03] When a saint prays
[1:36:07] in desperation,
[1:36:09] God will hear their prayer.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Israel, there's
[1:36:14] nothing to worry about. There's nothing.
[1:36:15] Just relax." We have a couple of
[1:36:18] different schools of thought around the
[1:36:20] message that I've been a I've been a
[1:36:22] part of. I've seen it. There's this one
[1:36:25] uh school of thought is that we have
[1:36:29] everything that we need and just relax.
[1:36:33] There is no more move of God going to
[1:36:36] happen. There is not going to be a great
[1:36:39] outpouring before the rapture.
[1:36:41] Everything is on the tape. The
[1:36:43] stabilizers have been set and we're just
[1:36:46] going to cruise right on into the
[1:36:48] resurrection and the rapture. Just stay
[1:36:51] faithful. Pay your tithes and offerings.
[1:36:53] come to church. And even if that means
[1:36:55] you make your own church at home, just
[1:36:58] do that. Listen to the tape. Relax. If
[1:37:02] you listen to your tape, you're good to
[1:37:04] go. God's not going to leave you. Long
[1:37:07] as you're playing those tapes, you're
[1:37:08] good to go. That is a lie from the
[1:37:12] devil.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; That is not on the tape. Listening to
[1:37:17] the tape is listening to what the tape
[1:37:19] said and then actually doing
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; doing what the tape said.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; No more than the Catholic priest at his
[1:37:31] time of reading of the scripture that
[1:37:34] everybody's okay just because he read
[1:37:37] the scripture.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; You're not obeying that word. How many's
[1:37:40] ever been to a Catholic uh church
[1:37:42] service? Brother Chris was raised. I've
[1:37:44] been to one. Every time I've been to a
[1:37:47] Catholic thing, I've been blessed
[1:37:49] because the priest reads the scripture.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And then they might, you know, they have
[1:37:53] their little bells and little things and
[1:37:55] all the other stuff. You just let that
[1:37:57] roll off. But the scripture was nice.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; The scripture was on.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; And if you actually listen to it,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; you can walk out of the Catholic church
[1:38:10] with a praise in your heart.
[1:38:14] Thank you Jesus for the word.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; That's where the word of God is.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; But just listening to the word,
[1:38:24] listening to the priest, listen to the
[1:38:26] Bible is not enough. You got to have you
[1:38:28] got to hear that word
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; and then in hearing it will move move
[1:38:32] you and motivate you. So the prophet is
[1:38:34] taking this um desperations and he's
[1:38:38] putting it on the people in a very
[1:38:40] humble simple way and he's calling their
[1:38:42] attention to the things that just
[1:38:44] happened in our generation.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Remember these pictures that we see in
[1:38:50] the prophets ministry. Remember the one
[1:38:52] in San Jose where that glory of the Lord
[1:38:55] is surrounding him and the picture there
[1:38:58] of the what he said was Ezekiel
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; from the waist upward a amber light
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; in the scripture. You you don't get that
[1:39:09] picture every day.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; It's not a churches didn't have that
[1:39:12] picture. Science progressed and we can
[1:39:15] now see
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; what's going on.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; It ought to throw us in desperation.
[1:39:22] Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Something's fixing to happen, saints.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; The signs are here upon us.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; The darkness is upon the nations.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; We see that there is a time where the
[1:39:40] believer must examine himself.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord will be a sudden
[1:39:48] secret going away. There won't be
[1:39:51] special meetings to remind you that the
[1:39:55] coming of the Lord is happening today.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Won't be no texts or no email. The
[1:40:03] coming of the Lord is going to happen
[1:40:04] today. It's a sudden secret going away.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; But the signs, the wonders, the signs,
[1:40:12] the signs, the signs are pointing to it.
[1:40:14] Pointing that's multiple. That's years
[1:40:17] and years of signs. But when it's time
[1:40:20] for them to go, swoop
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; and the door was shut.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Just like that.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close just now.
[1:40:36] But let me let me
[1:40:42] let me read something else out of
[1:40:44] desperation. Paragraph 55. Those people
[1:40:47] had seen the hand of God that night of
[1:40:50] the communion.
[1:40:52] They took it with desperation because
[1:40:54] they know that something was fixing to
[1:40:56] happen. And we know something is fixing
[1:40:59] to happen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; And remember the coming of the Lord will
[1:41:04] be a sudden secret going away.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; He'll come and take her like a thief in
[1:41:10] the night. And to think that if somebody
[1:41:13] all of a sudden there is members of our
[1:41:16] family gone
[1:41:18] and you're left behind,
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; it should throw us into desperation.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; That by the grace of God will not be
[1:41:28] left behind.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; If there's anything I don't want,
[1:41:35] don't leave me, Lord.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Is that your prayer today?
[1:41:41] Lord, don't leave me here.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Please don't leave me here.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; It ought to throw us into desperation.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Here the prophet of God,
[1:41:54] paragraph 59, he says this.
[1:41:58] This lays the prophet. I have two more
[1:41:59] quotes. Is that okay?
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Or three. All right. He says, "Jack
[1:42:03] Moore said to me one time, I hate to
[1:42:06] have to answer like you will have to
[1:42:08] answer to at the day of judgment. God
[1:42:12] has put these people into your hands and
[1:42:15] you're going to give an account for
[1:42:16] every one of them. You're going to
[1:42:19] answer for your ministry." That's about
[1:42:22] 15 years ago or maybe 18.
[1:42:26] And since then, I've been in
[1:42:29] desperation.
[1:42:31] What will I do? Let me say only what you
[1:42:35] say. Lord, let me tell them what's the
[1:42:37] truth or don't say nothing. It throws me
[1:42:40] in desperation. When you hear Brother
[1:42:42] Brandon preach, does he preach like a
[1:42:45] man in desperation?
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Does he preach like a man on fire?
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Does he preach like he's sin in another
[1:42:53] dimension?
[1:42:55] when he's screaming out against the
[1:42:57] worldly isism that creeped into the
[1:42:59] churches. That's a man that's that's
[1:43:03] preaching under desperation.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; That's a man that knows the hour that
[1:43:09] we're living in.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; I thank God for a ministry like that.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Not lulling me to sleep, but every
[1:43:18] single tape catching me,
[1:43:22] building me
[1:43:25] molding me into the stature of a perfect
[1:43:28] man.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 60. Then seeing these signs
[1:43:32] coming, see the Holy Spirit take us out
[1:43:35] there and bring these seals, lay them in
[1:43:38] like that. Bring the church ages, lay
[1:43:41] them in, then come down in a great big
[1:43:44] pillar of fire back there and revealed
[1:43:48] himself.
[1:43:49] then come down on the next thing on the
[1:43:52] seven seals and revealed it. Even put it
[1:43:56] in the papers in the magazine. Then come
[1:43:58] in and take the angels of God, them
[1:44:01] seven angels with seven messages and
[1:44:05] confirmed it exactly what the Bible
[1:44:07] said. Then during that time, come up and
[1:44:10] bring those seals, those signs, uh
[1:44:14] flashes of the end time and bring it up
[1:44:16] to the people.
[1:44:18] Tell them what it is all about it. The
[1:44:21] Lord working right through showing
[1:44:23] himself present and then write down like
[1:44:26] this morning. Come up and require that
[1:44:28] token on every person. Then you're my
[1:44:31] people. You're the ones that I love
[1:44:34] these and them is listening to the tapes
[1:44:37] and so forth. Then you see what
[1:44:39] desperation it puts me in.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:50] You see what desperation it puts me in.
[1:44:57] Took my towel. Paper towel.
[1:45:00] Grab me a paper towel quick. Somebody
[1:45:01] quick.
[1:45:03] Levi just grab it. Thank you.
[1:45:08] So here the prophet is bringing this
[1:45:11] desperation
[1:45:13] showing that these things accumulated.
[1:45:17] He's bringing it up all the time. Is
[1:45:19] that right? The signs of Holy Spirit and
[1:45:22] bringing it in desperation. It ought to
[1:45:25] throw us who are listening into
[1:45:28] desperation. Thank you, son. It ought to
[1:45:31] throw us into desperation.
[1:45:35] Is that right?
[1:45:40] Or do we want a more comfort sermon? We
[1:45:42] want a, you know, a nice, comfortable,
[1:45:44] don't get into that. Don't mess with me.
[1:45:46] Don't push on that. Don't, you know
[1:45:48] what? That's just not reality.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; That would be disrespectful to you and
[1:45:53] your soul.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; That wouldn't be right.
[1:45:57] Look,
[1:45:58] look at this. What if what if you're
[1:46:01] responsible for a group of people that's
[1:46:05] listening to you?
[1:46:07] What if you each individual at the end
[1:46:10] of the day he's going to pull you to the
[1:46:12] side and says you are responsible for
[1:46:15] all of these people here 5 10 20
[1:46:17] whatever you're responsible for them.
[1:46:21] See it throws you it's a different
[1:46:22] atmosphere
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; than just falling asleep than just you
[1:46:27] know taping out some quotes and then
[1:46:29] just throwing them out there. No, no,
[1:46:31] no, no. You got to be down on your
[1:46:34] knees.
[1:46:36] You got to be in prayer constantly.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And then at the end, you want to you
[1:46:50] want to clear you want a clear
[1:46:51] conscience,
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; right, Brother Caleb? You want to clear
[1:46:57] you want to be able to say, you know, I
[1:46:59] did what I was supposed to do. I did
[1:47:01] exactly what you told me to do. You put
[1:47:03] it on my heart. I didn't know it, but I
[1:47:05] said it the way you I felt like you
[1:47:07] wanted me to say it. And then you're
[1:47:08] clear. I'm free from all men's blood.
[1:47:13] And then it's in God's hands then,
[1:47:15] right? And that's what this message has
[1:47:17] done. Now, he says this in paragraph
[1:47:21] 127, God in the last days has manifested
[1:47:23] himself so to us by his great signs and
[1:47:26] power, it should make us desperate.
[1:47:30] That's right. And is willing to heal us
[1:47:33] and save us ought to throw us all into
[1:47:36] desperation to get to that healing
[1:47:39] stone. That's right. One final point I
[1:47:44] want to bring in this in the me in the
[1:47:46] same message desperation says now it
[1:47:48] ought to throw you into desperation.
[1:47:52] It ought to electrify this place and
[1:47:56] touch a not just be like a a match to a
[1:47:59] barrel of powder. Certainly, it ought to
[1:48:04] um
[1:48:05] No, just be like a match to a barrel of
[1:48:08] powder. Certainly. And it ought to
[1:48:11] explode the faith
[1:48:14] and love and desperation drive them
[1:48:18] people right into the kingdom of God to
[1:48:21] believe with all their heart. Do you
[1:48:23] believe now every one of you? All right.
[1:48:27] Now, here's what brother Vanom gives us.
[1:48:30] The reason why we're not desperate.
[1:48:33] Okay. This is the reason why it's so
[1:48:36] easy for us to lull away and tiptoe and
[1:48:41] relax and as the scripture says sleep in
[1:48:44] Zion. Um in paragraph 67 he says this
[1:48:48] here. I believe that the reason we don't
[1:48:51] have desperation
[1:48:53] is because
[1:48:55] it's a lack of love.
[1:49:00] God, the love of God, I think the love
[1:49:03] of God causes desperation.
[1:49:07] If God is in you, the token inside of
[1:49:10] you, and you see the condition of the
[1:49:12] times and people waiting in sin the way
[1:49:16] they are, it'll throw you into
[1:49:19] desperation. I believe it will.
[1:49:22] You remember after 911,
[1:49:25] September 11th, when the when the Twin
[1:49:29] Towers were attacked in New York? Do you
[1:49:31] remember the You remember the the entire
[1:49:33] news cycle? It it engulfed all of the
[1:49:37] news. That's what everybody talked
[1:49:38] about. Do you remember how the churches
[1:49:40] were full?
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; You remember how people got baptized?
[1:49:45] Do you remember that? Do you remember
[1:49:47] their awareness and the awakening
[1:49:50] that you know what I need to be right
[1:49:52] with God?
[1:49:53] But what happened to that awakening?
[1:49:57] What happened to that awareness?
[1:50:01] I wonder if we could see when the sword
[1:50:06] came down in the prophet's hand right
[1:50:09] here in Sabino Canyon.
[1:50:11] and we could see that message going
[1:50:14] forth in its fullness.
[1:50:17] I wonder if we was at the tabernacle and
[1:50:20] God could open our eyes like he did to
[1:50:22] brother Billy Paul one time in that
[1:50:26] hotel room.
[1:50:29] Brother Brandham covered his face with
[1:50:30] the pillow
[1:50:32] and he says that his daddy woke him up
[1:50:36] two or three o'clock in the morning.
[1:50:38] He says, "Billy, the the the the the
[1:50:41] being the man that I I talked to you
[1:50:43] about that he's always company my
[1:50:45] ministry." Yes, Daddy. He says, 'Well,
[1:50:48] he visited me tonight this morning.
[1:50:51] And I asked him
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; if I can show you and show Howard
[1:50:59] uh who you were. He says, "You can show
[1:51:02] Billy."
[1:51:03] He says, "So, his daddy took his
[1:51:05] pillow." Now remember, Brother Billy
[1:51:08] knew his dad wouldn't lie to him.
[1:51:10] Brother Billy knew that his dad was
[1:51:12] telling the truth. Brother Billy saw the
[1:51:13] signs, wonders, and miracles, but he had
[1:51:16] never seen that man.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And then Brother Bam, Brother Billy
[1:51:21] says, Brother Bam took the pillow off of
[1:51:24] his face. He said, "There standing in
[1:51:27] the corner was a man
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; with a rainbow over him.
[1:51:37] And he said that from that time
[1:51:41] forward,
[1:51:43] if he was in the meeting, he can tell
[1:51:46] when that man came into the room again.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Billy Paul was a great
[1:51:53] witness of this message.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He He witnessed this message like a man
[1:51:58] who saw an angel in the room.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Was he a true witness? Amen.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Sure he was.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; He wasn't playing with this message.
[1:52:13] And
[1:52:16] some of us have met Brother Billy. How
[1:52:17] many's ever met Brother Billy Paul?
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; How many's ever shook his hand? Was he
[1:52:22] real? Was he a Christian?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Was he believable?
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You think he's lying?
[1:52:28] Now, I never met Brother Brandham, but I
[1:52:30] had the privilege of meeting Brother
[1:52:31] Billy Paul. He lived right here in this
[1:52:33] city.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; And like out of all the people that can
[1:52:39] live in the city where brother Billy
[1:52:41] Paul, God honored you to be a part of
[1:52:43] that.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Have you been up to his den room? How
[1:52:49] many been up to brother Madden's den
[1:52:51] room? How many How many's been up to
[1:52:52] Sabino Canyon? Do you know how many
[1:52:55] believers in South America and and in
[1:52:59] Africa would love
[1:53:03] to be in Sabino Canyon?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Would love
[1:53:08] to go to Sunset Mountain.
[1:53:16] And when they come here and you're with
[1:53:19] them for the first time, it rejuvenates
[1:53:23] your faith.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; It ought to throw us into desperation
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; that we actually saw something. We're
[1:53:31] actually a witness of something.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; We are the believers that actually
[1:53:37] follow what these brothers hear about on
[1:53:39] tape.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; God help us. God bless us.
[1:53:47] We should be living in desperation. Now,
[1:53:50] we know something's going to happen.
[1:53:51] What's it going to be? What's the next
[1:53:53] one? Huh? Has all the national
[1:53:58] tragedies, have they all been filled up?
[1:54:02] How many people prophesied that COVID
[1:54:06] would happen?
[1:54:10] Huh? How many of us knew exactly this is
[1:54:14] going to be a worldwide crisis and some
[1:54:17] of us would even criticize one another
[1:54:20] for going to church or leaving our doors
[1:54:22] open? How many knew that was going to
[1:54:24] happen? Well, brothers and sisters,
[1:54:27] something else is going to happen. It's
[1:54:30] it's always that way there. What's the
[1:54:33] next move? What's the next
[1:54:36] thing going to happen?
[1:54:42] God help us this day of trouble that
[1:54:46] Jacob found himself in or Jacob's
[1:54:49] trouble. We'll call it Jacob's troubles
[1:54:52] cuz he had many of them. And they led
[1:54:55] him up to that spot where he got
[1:54:59] desperate.
[1:55:01] You go forward. I love you, but you go
[1:55:04] forward. I love you, too, but you go
[1:55:06] forward. And the Bible says Jacob was
[1:55:09] left. Let's read it real quick one more
[1:55:11] time as I close. Genesis chapter 32.
[1:55:14] What verse do I want, saints?
[1:55:18] Huh?
[1:55:24] My brother said verse 24,
[1:55:29] Genesis 32:24.
[1:55:32] And Jacob was left alone.
[1:55:36] And there wrestled a man with him until
[1:55:41] the breaking of day.
[1:55:45] Brothers and sisters, we all need this
[1:55:48] happening to happen to us.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; We need to get a hold of something that
[1:55:55] is real.
[1:55:57] Something
[1:55:59] that can change our name.
[1:56:03] something that can change our
[1:56:05] circumstance, our situation,
[1:56:08] something that I I'm willing to wrestle
[1:56:11] with all night long. I wonder what that
[1:56:14] wrestling match looked like.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the privileges I would
[1:56:18] like to have on the other side. But I'd
[1:56:20] like to be able to go back and see some
[1:56:22] of the events of the Old Testament,
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; like when Moses parted the Red Sea and
[1:56:27] Jesus Peter walked on water and all the
[1:56:30] great miracles. I would love to see
[1:56:34] this battle between a a a
[1:56:38] sster,
[1:56:41] Jacob, a deceiver
[1:56:43] and an angel.
[1:56:46] Brother Brham says that he actually
[1:56:51] prevailed over the angel.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; And he asked the question, can a man
[1:56:56] prevail over God?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; What's greater, a man or an angel?
[1:57:06] Come on, somebody.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Huh? Who told you that?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Dr. James Doppson didn't tell you that.
[1:57:14] The great leaders out there didn't tell
[1:57:15] you that. They they can't tell you that.
[1:57:18] They got things to say that are helpful,
[1:57:19] but they can't tell you this. The
[1:57:22] prophet said that a son of God has more
[1:57:26] authority
[1:57:28] in heaven than an angel that's never
[1:57:30] sinned. I'm talking about a son of God,
[1:57:34] a daughter of God, a man that's been
[1:57:37] washed in the blood,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; has authority,
[1:57:47] All these demons and devils in these
[1:57:49] neighborhoods and on our job sites and
[1:57:51] on our computer systems, we got the
[1:57:54] power to overcome every one of them.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God,
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; if it takes all night long,
[1:58:09] how many of you wrestling with something
[1:58:11] right now?
[1:58:12] Don't give up.
[1:58:15] The angel The angel pulled one on him.
[1:58:17] The angel
[1:58:19] tow out his oblique or two out. I don't
[1:58:20] know what that muscle would be called,
[1:58:22] but he touched him. Crippled him up.
[1:58:25] John, did he quit.
[1:58:28] I going to let you. The angel said, "Let
[1:58:30] me go, man.
[1:58:34] Come on, Jacob. Stop playing. The sun is
[1:58:36] coming up. Stop. I'm not playing with
[1:58:38] you.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Let me go, man. I can't let you go. Let
[1:58:42] me go. I can't let me go. I will not.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; I won't let you go until you bless me.
[1:58:52] Until you heal me, until you deliver me,
[1:58:56] until you change me, until you make me
[1:59:00] more like I'm supposed to be.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] Amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:10] I'd love to see that.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Jacob wrestling with an angel. That'd be
[1:59:18] worth seeing, right, Father Tim? I
[1:59:20] wonder what strategy he used. Got him in
[1:59:23] the headlock and just flip him over. Try
[1:59:28] to take off. No, come here. I ain't
[1:59:29] done.
[1:59:31] Roll around. Get back. Get back over. I
[1:59:33] ain't done talking to you.
[1:59:36] Angel's like, "This conversation is
[1:59:38] over." over. No, it is not over.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; I can't let you go till you bless me.
[1:59:43] What's your name? My name is Jacob.
[1:59:45] Okay, here's the problem. I'mma change
[1:59:48] your name and I'm going to bless you.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; And when the Lord changed his name
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; and blessed him, now I can meet Esau.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to meet Esau with 400.
[2:00:05] Nothing to be afraid of now. Is that
[2:00:08] right, somebody?
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; It's a dark terror of terrible age that
[2:00:13] we're living in.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Terrible age that we're living in. But
[2:00:17] greater is he that is in you
[2:00:20] than he that is in the world. And God
[2:00:24] will always hear a desperate soul, a
[2:00:28] desperate prayer. And I'm just talking
[2:00:30] about throwing a prayer out. I'm talking
[2:00:31] about a desperate prayer
[2:00:34] where it's between life and death.
[2:00:37] God help us. God bless us.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; May God keep us. Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Family need that in your life.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, I won't let you go till you bless
[2:00:52] me.
[2:00:54] You got to get alone with God sometime,
[2:00:56] huh? You got to get alone. I love coming
[2:01:00] to church. I love the worship and
[2:01:02] fellowship with you. But every Christian
[2:01:05] in order to survive in this age, mom,
[2:01:08] dad, young person, whoever you are, you
[2:01:11] have got to get alone with God
[2:01:16] and find those sacred moments
[2:01:19] where he can reveal himself to you. Can
[2:01:22] you hear me on that? Can you saints hear
[2:01:24] me on that?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; It's not a church experience. You can't
[2:01:27] live off of each camp meeting or each
[2:01:30] special meeting. You got to get along
[2:01:32] with God. And Jacob was alone to himself
[2:01:36] and there he met a man. And that's what
[2:01:38] we need to do tonight. I have one last
[2:01:40] quote I want to read for you. It's in
[2:01:42] the message the invisible union. And the
[2:01:44] prophet of God says this here.
[2:01:50] There's several places we can go talking
[2:01:53] about this last day in the end time
[2:01:55] signs.
[2:01:57] And he says
[2:02:04] paragraph 28 in the invisible union the
[2:02:07] then the solemn warning in the last book
[2:02:11] of revelation of Jesus Christ. Whosoever
[2:02:14] shall add a word or take a word away his
[2:02:16] part will be taken from the book of
[2:02:17] life. Oh God, knowing seeing how fragile
[2:02:22] we are, knowing that we're walking on
[2:02:26] the brittle threads of life of this
[2:02:28] mortal life, not knowing what time that
[2:02:30] we're going to be summoned to answer on
[2:02:33] high. Let us, oh Lord, lay aside
[2:02:36] everything in our heart, everything in
[2:02:38] our mind, and look straight to your word
[2:02:41] tonight for you to come and interpret it
[2:02:45] with living oracles. Granted, may your
[2:02:49] spirit fall upon us and anoint the word
[2:02:52] to our heart that we might go from here
[2:02:56] this evening better people than we are
[2:02:58] now. That we might have a closer insight
[2:03:02] on Jesus Christ. Granted, Lord, that we
[2:03:06] might understand the day that we're
[2:03:09] living in and the preparation of God for
[2:03:12] his people in this hour, this great,
[2:03:16] crucial, dark time that we're now living
[2:03:21] in. God, anoint us not only speaker, but
[2:03:26] hearer, and together make our hearts to
[2:03:30] tremble at your word. For the fear of
[2:03:33] God is the beginning of wisdom.
[2:03:37] Grant these things, Father, we ask in
[2:03:40] Jesus' name. Amen.
[2:03:44] May he quicken us to the time that we
[2:03:46] now live in. Something great is fixing
[2:03:49] to happen. There's a there's just a, you
[2:03:51] know, there's darkness. There's things
[2:03:53] taking place. We see it. We know that
[2:03:56] something is happening. Something's
[2:03:57] going to happen. And we
[2:04:01] uh want to be ready now. Amen. That's
[2:04:04] what the scriptures do us. They prepares
[2:04:06] us before the tragedy strikes because
[2:04:10] tragedy is going to strike. And some
[2:04:12] people say, "Well, when it strikes, then
[2:04:13] I'll go pray." No, your time to pray is
[2:04:15] now. Your time to study is now. Your
[2:04:17] time to be aware and to be awake is now.
[2:04:21] Amen.
[2:04:23] and this message.
[2:04:25] The rest of Tucson, I don't know what
[2:04:27] proportion of Tucson has heard the
[2:04:28] message of William Brandham. A great
[2:04:30] portion, many, many people know nothing
[2:04:33] about what happened in Sabino Canyon. I
[2:04:36] mean, thousands of visitors go there
[2:04:38] every year. We go up there, there's
[2:04:40] people going up there, they're jogging,
[2:04:42] they're for their exercise, they're
[2:04:44] visitors, they're going up. They have no
[2:04:46] idea what took place up there.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that something?
[2:04:51] But we know what took place
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; and that's why we live the way we live.
[2:04:54] And so God bless us and help us to
[2:04:57] continue to live deeper closer closer
[2:05:00] walk with him. Now if the musicians
[2:05:03] would come
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; tonight we'll be observing the Lord's
[2:05:06] supper.
[2:05:08] Appreciate brother Art Salceto. He'll be
[2:05:10] coming down to help with that. We
[2:05:12] certainly miss brother Joe and pray that
[2:05:14] the Lord will bring him back him and
[2:05:17] Timmy back safely.
[2:05:19] and we will observe that tonight.
[2:05:25] And we just like to say to the saints on
[2:05:28] the stream, we certainly appreciate
[2:05:32] you joining us together with the service
[2:05:34] uh today. We will look forward to you
[2:05:39] coming and being a part uh with our next
[2:05:43] meeting, our next service time. But we
[2:05:46] will
[2:05:48] uh close this service and ask God's
[2:05:51] blessings upon each of you. Amen. Let's
[2:05:55] sing that song.
[2:05:57] Um
[2:05:59] when the world's on fire, Lord, let my
[2:06:03] your pillow be my bosom. What's that
[2:06:05] script? What's that song?
[2:06:07] My loving brother. When?
