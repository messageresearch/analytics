[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] According [Music] to my according to my promises I can stand. You are upon my heart. The truth that sets me free according to thy word onto me. [Music] Good evening and God bless you all. Let's all stand and like to take the opportunity while I ask our brother Art if you could come up in the service with a word of prayer. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, Father God, thank you Lord for allowing us to be in this house, Lord, to come and to worship you, Father, to give you thanks. And as always, Lord God, we realize as a prophet has stated it so many times, there's nothing that we could ever do to merit your grace. And we know God, we fall short each and every day. As our our prophet taught us, Paul said, "I die daily." So first Lord God, we want to ask that you forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings even Lord as the scripture says that we forgive those that trespass against us. Father we invite your presence because we know Lord God if we come and you don't meet us the service is in vain. Lord you said where two or three were gathered in your name that you'd be there in the midst. And father there's more than that here. And father, our desire is to come and to worship you, to receive from you, God, to get strength, to help us, Lord, to live a life where the gospel. Please God, take away any doubt, thoughts, fear, pain, whatever might be struggling or battling the people with and ask Lord that you would come in each and every heart. Cleanse us, Father. Help us to focus on you to get ourselves out of the way. God, we commit this service. We ask a blessing in your anointing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for that glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's just take a few moments just to worship Almighty God. Amen. Let's go to the key of C. It's beginning to rain. Hear the voice of our father. [Music] So ever drinking of his water. He promised to pour his spirit out on his son and his daughters. [Music] If you're thirsty and dry, look up to the sky. It's beginning to rain. [Music] The turtle doves are singing sweet songs of mourning. Leaves of the trees turn to silver clouds to the sky. The silent clouds up above are beginning together. There's thirsty and so am I. It's beginning to rain. Hear the voice of the father. He's saying whosoever will come drink of this water. He promised to pour his spirit up on his sons and his daughters. If you're thirsty and dry, look up to the sky. You may be seated. We'll sing that chorus one more time. It's beginning to rain to the voice of our father. He's saying whosoever will drink of this water. [Music] He promised to pour his spirit out on his son and he's on earth. If you're thirsty and dry, look up to the sky. It's beginning to rain. [Music] Go to the key of B flat. [Music] Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. He invites his chosen people come and lie with his men and supplies their every need. Oh, too sweet to suffer with Jesus all the time. Come and die. The master of fallen. Come and die. [Music] [Music] Oy Christ's command for the master to come and die. There they found their hearts desire. bread and fish upon the fire. Thus he satisfies the hungry every time. Come and die. The master call it come and die. You made feast at Jesus table all the time. He who fed the mult turn the water into wine. To the hungry callth now. Come and die. Come and die. The master callth. Come and die. You make feast at Jesus table all the time. [Music] He fed the multitude. Turn the water into wine. Hungry calling. Now come and die. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's go to E flat. We find many people who can't understand why we are so happy and free. We've crossed over Jordan to Canaan fair land. And this is like heaven to me. Oh, this is like heaven to me. This is like heaven to me. I've crossed over Jordan to Kadan land and this is like heaven to me. So when I get happy, I sing and I shout. The devil don't believe it, I see. But I'm filled with the spirit. There isn't a doubt. And that's what's the matter with me. Oh, that's what's the matter with me. That's what's the matter with me. I've crossed over Jordan to spare them. And that's what's the matter with me. We've heard the sweet music, the heavenly cord, glory land over the sea. A so thrilling message from Jesus our Lord. And this is like heaven to me. Oh, this is like heaven to me. This is like heaven to me. I crossed over Jordan to Maryland and this is like heaven. One more time with all your heart. Oh, this is like heaven to me. This is like heaven to me. I crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair land. And this is like heaven to me. Let's go to the key of G. [Music] I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore, very deeply sane within, sinking to rise no more. But the master of the sea heard my despairing cry from the waters lifted me. Now say am I love lifted me. Love lifted me and nothing else could help. Love lifted me. Love lifted me. Love lifted me. When nothing else could help lifting me souls in danger above, Jesus completely saves. He will lift you by his love out of the hairy waves. He's the master of the sea. Fills his will oy. He your savior wants to be saved today. Love lifted me. Love lifted me. [Music] When nothing else would love, love lifted me. Love lifted me. Love lifted me. When nothing comes good, love lifted. [Music] As we prepare to change the order of the service, let's all stand. In Christ alone, my hope is found. He is my light, my strength, my song. This corner stone. This solid ground firm through the fiercest ground and storm. What heights of love? What depths of peace? When fears are still, when striving cease. My comforter, my all in all. Here in the love of Christ I stand. In Christ alone who took on flesh fullness of God in helpless faith. His gift of love and righteousness [Music] scorned by the ones he came to save. Till on that cross as Jesus died, the wrath of God was sisfied for every sin. On him was laid. Here in the death of Christ I live. There in the ground. His body laid. Light of the world by darkness lain. and bursting forth in glorious day. Up from the grave he rose again. And as he stands in victory. Sin's curse has lost its grip on me. For I am his and he is mine. Bought with the precious blood of Christ. [Music] No guilt in life. No fear in death. This is the power of Christ in me. From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my death. [Music] No power of hell. No scheme of man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home. Here in the power of Christ I'll stand. [Music] Give me the key for day star. Liy of the valley. Let your sweet aroma fill my life. Rose of Sher show me how to grow in beauty in God's sight. [Music] Farest of 10,000. Make me a reflection of your life. Day stars shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. [Music] Lead me, Lord. I'll follow. Anywhere you open up the door. Let your word speak to me. Show me what I've never seen before. [Music] Lord, I want to be your witness. You can take what's wrong and make it right. [Music] Day stars shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. [Music] When I seen a world that's dying, wounded by the master of deceit. [Music] Roing in the darkness, haunted by the years that paste [Music] standing near me, shining With compassion in your eyes, in your eyes, [Music] let your love shine through me in the night. [Music] Lead me, Lord, I'll follow. Anywhere you open up the door. [Music] Let your word speak to me. Show me what I've never seen before. [Music] Lord Lord, I want to be your witness. You can take what's wrong and make it right. Take it right. Day star shine down. Let your love shine through me in the night. Day stars shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. [Music] Amen. God bless you saints. So good to be in the house of the glory with you tonight. Amen. welcome you to the house of the Lord. Amen. Are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. So happy to see each of you. A pleasant surprise to see brother Art and Sister Annabelle and each of you. Amen. This is our prayer meeting tonight and we'll take a few moments to go into the word and um trust it to be a blessing to you. We'll turn in the scripture. Sorry. Yes. We're turning to scripture in Revelations chapter 1 and also Matthew 28:19, the great commission. And we're just going to take a simple but deep subject on water baptism. And we all know what it is. But how important is it to us? And this is what we should be preaching. Go into all the world and preach the gospel. Now in Revelations chapter 1 verse number we'll start with verse number three. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand. Sorry, my Bible. John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was which is to come from the seven spirits which are before his throne. From Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. had made us kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him. And they also which pierce him, and all kindreds of the earth shall because of him. Even so, amen. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, sayaeth the Lord, which is, which was, &gt;&gt; which is to come, the Almighty. Take that verse. He says it again, saying, verse 11, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. And what thou seeest write in a book, and send unto the seven churches, which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, unto Smyrna, unto Pergamus, unto Thyra, unto Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia. Verse 17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not. I am the first and the last. I am he that liveth and was dead. Behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. And have the keys of hell and death. Amen. So, we know who's speaking there in Matthew 28, the great commission. And one of the more controversial um issues amongst the denominations when it comes to water baptism is this scripture right here. Matthew 28 verse 19 verse 18. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever things I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. Amen. And let's pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessings on this service tonight. Ask your blessing on this portion of the word, oh God, and just help us, Lord, to say what you place on our hearts and help us to, Lord, to receive from you, the great Holy Spirit. We commit our ways to you, Lord. We ask you to come on the scene and meet the needs that we have. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. Water baptism. Simple subject. But that is what was on my heart this morning. I got up this morning and was going through some of the scriptures and um I realized the great debate amongst you know most Christians in the Christian church baptized in these titles father son and holy ghost. And they use this scripture here in Matthew 28:19 to do so. Now, in the book of Acts all the way through Acts chapter 2 on, you'll find that the disciples Peter being there that heard this great command and great commission that everyone that was baptized was baptized in the name of the Lord or the Lord Jesus or the Lord Jesus Christ. In the King James version Bible, it brings that um I think the Lamza Bible takes the Pacetta which is um taken from the Syriak language which is a dialect from the Aramaic. Brother Random speaks of this um and of this in translation Dr. Lamza, I can't think of his first name. Anyways, and also the Greek dialogue when you go to those scriptures, Dr. Lamza puts right there in Acts chapter 2, Acts 8, Acts 9, the Lord Jesus Christ. So in your King James version, it'll say Lord Jesus or the name of the Lord. But in none of them are there the titles father, son and holy ghost when the individual is getting baptized. This is very clear. It is um not debatable. Many of the scholars, even the trinitarian scholars will agree that the and the Catholics will agree that the original church when baptizing they used the name of the Lord Jesus. But as the church grew on in what they call revelation and they instituted doctrines and forms on how to do things, they begin to 100 years, 200 years after they begin to take on these titles of father, son, and holy ghost. And I thought that was quite interesting that many of them will agree that the original church did it this way. Um the book of Acts shows that they did it this way. So why are we doing it a different way today? Why are many churches doing it a different way today? And it's simple that you know truth gets lost when you don't stay with it. &gt;&gt; And you got to stay with the original truth that came. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if all of the apostles and the apostles after them all went into the water and baptized these individuals in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, why would we change that? Who has the authority or the power to change it? And they have done it. So most of the churches, in fact, most many Christians, if you ask them how they were baptized, some of them don't even know how they were baptized. It's very interesting that you ask them how they they'll say, "Well, I was baptized in water because the teaching and the understanding that uh there is a correct formula to be baptized." And you say, "Well, water baptism doesn't save you." And that's true. Water baptism doesn't save you. Your faith in Jesus Christ is what saves you. But if you are saved, Jesus said, "Go therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them." So this baptism is a must for the Christian. &gt;&gt; So let's take Acts chapter 19 just for a moment and we'll see if it really makes a difference. Okay? &gt;&gt; Now, many of you all can come up here and preach this sermon for me, &gt;&gt; or you should be able to. All right. &gt;&gt; If you can't come up here and preach it, you should be able to preach it on your job &gt;&gt; or on the streets. Acts 19 verse one. And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coast came to where? Ephesus and finding certain disciples. So, let's back up a minute. I'm moving a little ahead of myself. Who are these disciples that they found? So, let's go to Matthew. This is at the beginning of John the Baptist's ministry. Matthew chapter 3, just for a moment in verse number one. When you have that, you can say, "Amen." Amen. In those days came John the who? &gt;&gt; Baptist. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? &gt;&gt; John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his path straight." And the same John had his raignment, camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair, leather gutter about loins, and his meat was locust and wild honey. then went out then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round about Jordan and were what? &gt;&gt; Baptized &gt;&gt; baptized of him in Jordan doing what? &gt;&gt; Confessing their &gt;&gt; confessing their sins. So here's John preaching to all of Judea and all the region about very popular ministry. He had a ministry amongst the worldly folks, the kings, the the the uh the leaders in charge knew who John was. He had a reputation. He preached. He was out in the wilderness eating locust and honey. A wild man, preaching baptism, something we had never seen before. He comes out of nowhere. Brother Random describes him as an eagle that lands on the banks of the Jordan. Like an eagle that lands there. He lands in Jordan there. Prophet 400 years, no prophet. And here comes John the Baptist in the spirit of Isaiah in as Isaiah said he would come as the voice of one crying in the wilderness. And he's baptizing many many people. In verse number 11 says this, he preached his sermon, the axes laid to the root of the tree. And he's telling them to repent, bring forth fruit. And he's preaching his ministry. In verse 11 says, I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. you he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. And so we see John the Baptist's ministry moving forward. He is baptizing the whole region. Mark 1 verse4 says this verse three the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord makes his path straight. John did baptize in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. And there went out unto him in all the land of Judea. And they of Jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan confessing their sins. It wasn't a little ministry. It was a tremendous ministry. and his ministry was getting the people to repent &gt;&gt; and to be baptized. Now this uh baptism in water is an outward uh symbol and it is an outward uh uh work an outward emotion is what brother Vanom calls it that an inward work has taken place. It is essential. It is what we preach is what we do. Jesus himself was baptized. John is com commanded to go and preach repentance and he's bringing in all of these souls in all of the region around to be baptized. He baptizes them unto repentance. Now, it's interesting how the Lord knows that this ministry or this baptism would one day have to be changed. And here it is in Acts 19. Let's go back there and see where this change took place. So Paul now after his conversion, the Holy Ghost have been given out in Acts chapter 2. And here Acts 19, Paul comes to the upper coats of Ephesus. It's one of the largest cities of all of the seven or eight churches there. The Corinth, Ephesus, Thara, all of those churches that we read about in Revelations there. Ephesus was the largest and where one of the first churches were born. They were more mature. They had a lot of um believers there. Paul started the work there. I think it was two years he settled in and preached in in in during the daytime and would um and and go into synagogues and teach and preach and many people received him and many rejected him. But Ephesus is now he's finding these disciples here. Verse two. And he said unto them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" And they said unto him, "We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost." And he said unto them, "Well, it doesn't matter. Just let me pray for you so you can receive the Holy Ghost." Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; That is not what he said. &gt;&gt; What did he asked them? &gt;&gt; He asked them, "How what? How were you baptized? If water baptism doesn't make a difference, why is the Apostle Paul asking these people, "How were you baptized?" &gt;&gt; It is a question you need to know. You need to know why you were baptized the way you were baptized. You need to know how you were baptized. This is the truth, saints, that we all have received. And this is not the truth that we receive and just sit on it. This is the truth that we receive and we go tell it to other people because most people don't know this truth. &gt;&gt; They don't understand that this even exist. Acts 19. Most people think, well, water baptis, it doesn't matter. As long as I gave my heart to the Lord. That is not what Paul said here. &gt;&gt; Paul asked him, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? You're believers. Thank God for that. You've come a long way. Praise the Lord for that. Have you received the Holy Ghost in your journey?" And he said, "No, we haven't received that. What are you talking about?" He says, "Okay, well, let's let's go back. Let's back up here. How were you baptized?" Very nice. And he said unto them, unto what then were you baptized? And they said unto John's baptism, John's ministry caught us. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, they that should believe on him should come after him, that is on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. So, here's believers that had to get rebaptized. How many of you have been baptized more than once? Yeah. It was necessary, wasn't it? Um, when the truth comes your way, it came their way. They didn't fight with it. They didn't know what the Holy Ghost was. Paul just simply tells them you're he didn't discredit what their their journey. He didn't discredit their journey. He said John baptized with repentance. But John's ministry was exactly right. That's what you were supposed to do. But he was preaching of something coming. And that something coming has arrived. &gt;&gt; And that something that was coming was the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now you need to be rebaptized again. Now look at this. Paul said, "And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied. And all the men were about 12." So we see it just just doesn't end at baptism, does it? We got to go to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; John said it in his ministry. I wonder not everybody caught it. Maybe not all all all the people understood it. Maybe certainly these uh disciples didn't catch it because John said, "I am baptizing you unto repentance, but the one coming after me, he's mightier than me. He'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire." So Paul brings that to those disciples. Luke 3:16, John said, 'I indeed baptize you with water. John 1:26, same thing. John St. John 1:31 all the way through is John speaking of the Holy Ghost that would come after him. But he had a great ministry and he caught a lot of disciples under his ministry. But still the truth of God had to come their way. And what was that truth? water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. All of the disciples did it this way. All of the disciples that heard this great commission in Matthew 28:19, they performed water baptism just this way. you know, Jesus was baptized by John and um um and the importance of the believer coming to get into a pool of water, a body of water, whether it's muddy or dirty, whether it's cold or warm, whether it's a natural tributary or some metal tub, whether it's a tank in a sign synagogue or wherever it is, the command to to be baptized is there among all of us to be a believer moving forward in your Christian journey. And I wonder if this isn't a nice piece for us to step in and witness the gospel to somebody who doesn't know this truth because it is a truth and many people don't know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus is dealing with this alpha. I'm alpha and omega. I'm first. I am the last. I'm he that was alive and then I died, but I'm living again. I have the keys of death in hell. It is witnessing. It is speaking of who he was in this great father, son, and holy ghost um dilemma that we have here. Matthew 28:19 says, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." Now, in the book of Acts, this is what they did. Let's turn there. Acts chapter 2, where the day of Pentecost was fully come. They were gathered in one place. The Holy Spirit falls down upon the cites, the Arabians, the Assyrians, strangers, people from different parts of Asia in Judea. No doubt many of these came under the ministry of John as well. And in verse number 37 says, "Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized." How many of you? &gt;&gt; Every one of you. In the name &gt;&gt; of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Well, he does it. He does it in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. Now, I've heard many people say, "I would rather listen to Jesus than to listen to Peter." And they're quoting this out of the Bible. I would rather listen to Jesus than listen to anybody, too. That's right. But who is speaking in this Bible right here? That that is Jesus that is speaking. In Acts 2:38, what Peter did, he did exactly what Jesus told him to do. There's no contradiction in the word. I mean, if we're going to separate the Bible that way, my good luck moving forward and just deciphering, you know, I could take this Paul. I heard our old church that we come out of and I was in the organization, the the bishop would say that there was uh people that would uh talking about women and their dress and the order of the church. And there were people that would say that Paul was he hated women. He had a problem with women. That's why he was so hard on them. Could you imagine somebody saying that about you know this is a Bible character. This is the Apostle Paul. This is what he laid out. Here's Peter doing exactly what the Lord told him to do. He baptizes them in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we know it is essential. How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Let's take an Old Testament scripture. It doesn't really um the Old Testament doesn't share or show us water baptism, but there are some places where the priest had to be washed. Exodus 19 and 10. And the Bible says this here. It's not baptism, but you can kind of see that this approach to the Lord, even the sacrifice, had to be a certain approach. It wasn't just coming any kind of way. There's a way to come. In verse 10, Acts 19:E 10, and the Lord said unto Moses, "Go unto the people and sanctify them today, and tomorrow, let them do what? wash &gt;&gt; wash their clothes. You say, "Well, Lord, I'm just coming. It's my heart." But the Lord commanded them to wash their clothes. Exodus 29:4 says this. and Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall wash them with water. Leviticus 8:6. Take one more scripture here showing the use of water in the Old Testament. Not just on the sacrifice, not just in a clean place, but the the the priests and the Levites and the ones that's coming forward, they had to be washed with water. The people's clothes had to be washed as they come forward in the learn. These are just shadows and types. We understand that. But it's still the same God who gave these commandments. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ex Leviticus 8:6. And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and wash them with water. Leviticus 14 verses number 8 and N. And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair, wash himself in water, that he may be clean. And after that he shall come into the camp and shall about carry abroad out of the tent seven days. But it shall be on the seventh day that it that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows. Even all his hair he shall shave off and he shall wash his clothes also. He shall wash his flesh and water and he shall be clean. This is the law of a leper coming back. Leviticus let's take numbers 19 verse number 7. How many like these quotes? &gt;&gt; You know these are quotes too. Now, how many you like this quote book? Leviticus 19 verse number 7. Then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. So this is the priest. I believe this is referring to the red heer and offering the sacrifices for the sins of the people and then he would go forward and have to be cleansed himself. The Lord dealing with Naaman told him to go wash in Jordan, the Jordan River and dip seven times. Gave him those instructions. Didn't fight about it. Didn't argue about it. He did kind of flex against it, didn't he? He told him that Naam na wanted to get healed from this leprosy. The Lord gave him the answer to go wash in Jordan. He says, "Well, where I'm from, our rivers are nicer. They're cleaner. I I like going there anyways, and I can maybe, you know, can't we can't we just do it?" He says, "My brother, if he would have told you something this, that, or the other, wouldn't you have done it?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Aren't you trying to get healed? Yeah. So, what what's with all of the what's with all of the you know, you you want to pick out your own river to get baptized in or wash your clothes or do you want to be cleansed? And he thought about it. Yeah. And he goes into the Jordan in obedience and dips seven times. And when he comes up out of the water, he was clean. His skin came back to him completely healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was just obedience. And I believe this is one of those deals. It is the obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; Okay. What kind of water are we baptizing them in? Is it is it water from the river? Is it water from the the municipality? I mean really how important is this water? This water I can drink it. What what different you know it's the obedience and obedience is better than sacrifice and there's a type and there is a outward um to the people in the fellowship that witness this great event taking place. It it it might I mean theologically or or logically speaking, what does that have to do me getting into a pool of water and having somebody dip me in the water? I mean, how what what's the big deal? Is it really that serious? I say yes. Is that serious? &gt;&gt; Jesus commanded the disciples to do it. And all through the scriptures, believers coming to Christ were commanded to do that. It's not a nothing, saints. It is a something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is actually the first something when you're dealing with someone that wants to come to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or that needs to come to the Lord. I think water baptism is one of those. It's nice. It's easy. It's many many people have already been baptized. Many Americans know the order of it. If they were Catholic, of course, they were baptized as children. They had no clue about it. This is a wonderful opportunity to just open up your Bible and share with them the importance of water baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But not just baptism in water. After baptism in water, it's the baptism of the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost in fire that is to take place next. Now look at Acts chapter 10 quickly. This are these are the Gentiles coming in. Cornelius from the Italian band. He was a centurion, very important man. He was a military man, a Roman and um a part of their army. A centurion has the authority over a hundred men or 80, just depends on um and you know it takes a certain character to be to have that many people under you. He's a man of authority and he sends and but he's a religious man. And he has some kind of heart towards the Lord. He praised, the Bible describes him as a devout man and a man that feared God with all of his house. And he gave much arms to the people and prayed to God always. Um, this is Acts chapter 10 verses 1 and two. You know, this this man doesn't even have the the laws of Judeaism or the laws of Moses in his life. He this man doesn't even know the message, but I think he would probably do good for some of us in the message. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's a pretty nice resume to have and not know what he didn't know. And &gt;&gt; it's amazing how we'll criticize many of the elders that they was in deep or they did this and but but their ministries have reached hundreds and thousands of people and many converts come in under their ministry with what they didn't know. &gt;&gt; And we know so much &gt;&gt; and we have produced very little. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. &gt;&gt; We're so deep. We're so revelated. We have all the quotes. We know where everybody missed it. But a lot of the people that we flex against, they're they're the easy they're the easy target because they're highly they're visible and everybody else is throwing at them. So, I'm going to throw at them, too. &gt;&gt; Right? And it's easy to do. It's easy to target. They ain't here to defend themselves. And by the way, I have a personal testimony of what brother did and what this brother did and how they messed up. But look at their life work and compare your life's work with their work. and then you'll stop talking. &gt;&gt; And and if this man is so off, he wasn't that off. He prayed always. He was devout. He feared God. And guess what? The Lord was hearing his prayer all along. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's one of them that like Elijah didn't know who the 7,000 were. the he he he's another one. You know, the the the the the Jews, the the religious church, the the the Holy Ghost fil church, they don't know who this man is. They don't know he he, you know, when when he goes to send to go get Peter because the vision told him to go send for this man Peter, Peter says, "Lord, we don't hang out with them people." The Lord had to send him a dream two, three times and deal with Peter. You know, Peter had an issue working with the other race. Y'all get quiet for a minute. &gt;&gt; Peter had a problem. Remember, he he he was with the Gentiles warming up and talking, chopping it up with them. Everything was fine until the Jews showed up and then he he separated himself from them. Well, we don't do that in 2025, though. You know, the Bible deals with every spirit that you see going on today. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; And all of us has a spirit that the Bible is trying to deal with even tonight if we'll just be honest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we say, "Lord, help us." Right? Lord, help me. And here he is. He sends to Japa. Peter comes uh reluctantly. The Lord tells him, "Don't call anything uncommon or unclean." The vision kind of preparing him for it. Then he comes, sends men to Cornelius's house. Cornelius gathers his family in to uh hear their guests come. This Jew, this Jewish man to come into his home. Probably the first time the Jews didn't do that. and he comes into his home and verse number 34. Then Peter opened his mouth and said of a truth, I perceive that God is no respector of persons. But in every nation he that fearth him and workketh righteousness is accepted with him. Every nation. The word which God send unto the children of Israel preach in peace by Jesus Christ. He is Lord of all. That word I say you know which was published throughout all of Judea and began from Galilea after the baptism which John preached. How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil. For God was with him. This is Peter preaching in this man's house. And we are witnesses of all these things which he did both in the land of Jews and Jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree. Him God raised up the third day and showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. Peter was an eyewitness. Verse 42. when he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the judge of the quick and the dead. To him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. Very basic message you would say very simple but it's true. These things happen. This is what Peter is saying. John's baptism. Jesus came and preached the Holy Ghost. They took him and hung him up on the tree. He died, but he rose three days later. And there's witnesses. I'm one of those witnesses. I saw him. I ate with him. There were witnesses that these things are true. And while Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all of them which what? &gt;&gt; Heard the word. &gt;&gt; Which heard the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people are in church and they don't hear anything. &gt;&gt; There's a song. It says they come emptyhanded. They come emptyhearted. And they come empty-headed. And they leave that way. It's okay to come empty-headed, but you should leave with something in your head and in your spirit that the Lord did for you. &gt;&gt; You came in here blank, but you don't leave out of here blank. Something happened. I received something &gt;&gt; from the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the word. And they of the circumcision which believe were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then answered Peter, "You all have the Holy Ghost. You don't need to get baptized cuz you already have the Holy Spirit." Is that what he said in verse 47? &gt;&gt; No. He says, "Can any man any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which has received the Holy Ghost as well as we?" And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of what? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord. Then pray they him to tarry certain days. So here's a group that actually receives the Holy Ghost before they were even baptized. And Peter still commands them even after they received the Holy Ghost to be baptized in water. Is it important? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it truth? &gt;&gt; Then go tell somebody the truth. It is the truth. And many people have missed this truth. And we don't want to leave them out there like that. Water baptism is a truth. The truth of God. And the way to be baptized is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And there's no other way for today. It's true. Uh there's disciples that get baptized. The Bible showed that they were baptized before uh the Holy Ghost came out, but there was a change and that change is in Acts chapter 19. So you use that in in while you're witnessing. Now can I take a few places from the prophet here? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now this water baptism even goes deeper. I know that the trinitarians or the trinity that word I don't have a problem with the word it it just it means three and um but when they define it that there's three separate persons in the godhead. Well, that's an argument. That's a debate that great smart men have debated that for years and years and years. And actually the definition of the trinity or the doctrine of the trinity has changed even amongst the trinitarians over the years. They have changed and their explanation of the trinity is quite similar to the way we would explain the oneness of the godhead. That the father, the son, and the holy spirit is the lord Jesus Christ. And many some trinitarians say that Jesus is God and that um it was the the father dwelling in him doing those works and all of the the words and the the explanation around it is very similar. You you won't find I haven't find there's a few that will actually believe in three gods that they say they believe in three gods. They'll say there's one God manifested in three persons co-equal co-eternal. They all have the same power, the same omniscience. Co-equal co-eternal three the three um distinct persons in the godhead. The three persons but the three are one is the way they'll explain it. And it's very close. Fine. No problem. They can explain it that way. They can say it that way. They quote the scriptures, the same Bible that we quote. But when it comes to water baptism, there is no compromise with that. It's either the disciples did it in the name of the Lord Jesus or they did it in the father, son, and the holy ghost, you know, order in the water. And if they did it that way, show it in the Bible. That's what you would have to that's the position that we take because it answers the question who the father is, who the son is, who the holy ghost is. When Peter baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, Jesus said, "Go ye therefore teach all nations, baptizing them in the name." That was the command of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. That was the command. And what did they do in obedience to the command? They did exactly what he told them to do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, which fulfills the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to back down on that. That's the scripture. It doesn't matter. Most of the churches doesn't don't do it. Doesn't matter that no one's heard it that way before. This is what the Bible says. It's very very clear. And if it doesn't matter, then why would Paul ask the question, how were you baptized when the subject of the Holy Ghost came up? H I would even ask the question uh today even in the message. You might have been baptized correctly, but if I asked you the question, how were you baptized? and you're blank and you don't understand it, then I would go back into those scriptures and make sure you get an understanding why you're baptized the way you're baptized because it's the understanding of what you're doing &gt;&gt; that you want. You want the Lord to reveal that to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I take 10 more minutes? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here, the prophet of God in questions and answers says this here. He's speaking a bit on communion. We just had that on Sunday night. He says just eat of the bread. Now I know Jesus is the bread of life. That's true. But this is a symbol just like baptism. Baptism doesn't save you. Baptism is only a sign that you're witnessing to the congregation that you believe in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It doesn't save you. Water will not save. It's your faith that saves you. But baptism is an order and it must be carried out because God can't say be baptized and then turn around and say it doesn't need to be done. &gt;&gt; He cannot issue taking communion and turn around and say there's no need to taking it. You've got to do it. It's an order forever with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message communion 1965, the prophet God says this right here in this city. He says this. Now we only have three physical divine orders left to us. One of them is communion, feet, washing, water, baptism. That's the only three things. That's the perfection of the three. See, and that's the only three orders we have. We realize that that was the issue given by St. Paul in the New Testament. Now, if we would say communion should just be taking the word, I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord's supper until he has taken the word of the Lord into his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, because I'm going I'll read something for you in a few m moments and you'll see. Now, notice then why then on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army. They do not believe in any form of water baptism and says we don't need it. Now if we don't need water baptism, why are we baptized? Said the water can't save you. The blood saves you. I'll agree with that. That's right. The blood saves you, not the water. But we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inwardly work of grace has been done. See? So we so must we on communion. Now this is a strong one I'm going to read here. Now I'll save the strong one for later. All right. Paragraph 8. You somebody said later. I thought you was done. I am done just about. Paragraph number 89 in the message ordination. The prophet says this. I think that is one of the most beautiful verses. I have given you an example that you should do as I've done unto you. We should do to each other in commemoration. This it's been a practice of of the church of this group of people gatherings ever since we began and before this tabernacle was ever built when we were yet a cottage prayer meeting. We practice feet washing. Our sisters go to the room in the back. Our brethrens go to the room at the right. We observe feet washing. Strangers, if you're with us tonight, we're only happy to have you fellowship in these ordinances of God. I might explain, as I said a few minutes moments ago, the thing that God left for us to do. Water baptism, one article, communion, and remember that's only two. God is perfected in three. Feet washing is the third. See? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we remember that years later, even in the Bible, some people try to say it's not necessary. Certainly, I don't mean to say that people's feet need washing. That isn't it. Maybe theirs didn't. Not either. But it was an act of humility. It's an act of doing just as essential as water baptism. because he has said here that I have given you an example that you should do to each other as I have done to you. We find out that a widow could not be brought in among the people unless she had large strangers and had washed the feet of the saints, showing ourselves humble. That if anything we want to be is humble because that's the secret. That's the secret to power is through humility. You're always happy when you come out of these things of doing them. It's a blessed order of fellowship that we observe here at the church. Now, the prophet of God takes um so we'll take one scripture and then I'll read this last quote in St. John 11 where feet washing is mentioned. Sorry. St. John 13. Yeah. With the Lord's supper uh instituted. This is the night of our Lord's um he uh had the Passover and then Jesus washes the disciples se feet. In verse 7 St. John 13:7 Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know him hereafter." Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me." Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, "He that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet, but is clean every with, and ye are clean, but not all, for he knew should betray him." Verse 12, he says, "Know ye what I have done to you." Verse 13, "You call me Master and Lord, you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do do them. So Peter is like, Lord, I'm not going to wash you. You you'll never you'll never wash my feet. And the Lord tells Peter, "If if I don't wash your feet, you have no part with me." Jesus instituted it and showed the importance of why he instituted it. And the prophet of God said, "The foot washing is as important as water baptism." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just read it for you. &gt;&gt; It's part of what we do. Let me take this last quotation here and show you the deception behind this father, son, and holy ghost baptism that the enemy has slipped into the church and they lost this truth. They lost the truth of water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So many scripture whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord. You lay hands in the name of the Lord Jesus. You call on his name in prayer. It's um it's what we do. It's how we seal our prayer. We go, we come in the name of Jesus Christ. And when we get baptized or married or whatever we're doing, it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Satan doesn't like that name. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Satan wants to take it out. Lily of the valley, bright morning star, name of the father, name of the son, name of the holy ghost, the alpha, the omega. All of those things are true. The true, the one, the only. All those things are true. But what is his name? His name is Jesus Christ. And that name, demons tremble at the sound of that name. And there's a power in that name that the Apostle Paul when he saw these disciples when those believers got the understanding of what the true baptism was, he baptized them in the rebaptized them by the way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then laid hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is 1958. The baptism of the Holy Spirit, the prophet of God says this here. Let me tell you a little personal experience. Switzerland, Germany, in the places where I've been. How does fortune tellers work? How does evil spirits travel? I want you to believe me as your pastor because you're the one I'm speaking to. Devils travel in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. They cut feathers and everything else and throw spells on each other through the name father, son, and holy ghost. Call it the three high names. The mother of it is the Catholic churches. They go to these little statues and kneel there, cut a feather with scissors, turn it backwards, throw spells on their neighbors, and so forth where they've burnt to death and everything else for it. So you know when we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are baptizing in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost and alpha and omega and the lily of the valley and all of those. And brother Bam gives a a detail. I'm not going to take your time to read it, but he gives us testimony how the witches came against him and called up a storm in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. and and and I had this friend he he's been he's come to the way of the of partial way to the Lord he but he used to he came here uh he visited us here one time and he was always had a cross in his hand every trouble every problem he he would hold on to that cross and he pray even when he was a thug out there in the streets and when I gave my heart to the Lord he would tell me he'd give me little testimonies how the cross healed saved him and and so forth. I never challen I never said nothing to him. And then later he got saved and he realized there was no truth to it but his faith in that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we were talking about that. He's like, "Israel, you never, you know, you never challenged me on that. You just I was so ignorant. You never told me how dumb I was." I says, "Well, it you it didn't come up to to to really uh you know to bring it out to you that way." But he says, "I realized." And I was like, "Curtis, where did you you he says, I I got that from Hollywood, from watching movies, the C, get the cross in the name of Father." He, you know, he didn't read the Bible, didn't know the Bible, but the movie showed him and told him, "This is how you approach the Lord." Funny, huh? But he come to the way of the truth. Now he was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And that is a tremendous truth that we know is the truth. Go sharpen your sword with these scriptures. Amen. Go sharpen your sword and be a witness to somebody. You know, Paul found those those other uh uh disciples. He didn't criticize them. He just went right along. Some some of these people come to the great, you know, um you know, these great conferences that these denominations have and they come up to the altar and they come because they want to get saved and something strikes their hearts and these big conferences over the years that these mega fest and and they pull in all, you know, the the men's keepers or the promiseke keepers and they've done a great work and they bring loads and loads of people to the altar and brings them to Christ and they want to get saved. And when they get to be get baptized, they typically will baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And when you meet these people, they're good people. They're Christian people. Thank God that you got baptized. Wonderful. Beautiful. But Paul goes deeper and shows them something deeper to their experience. Hey, brother, you know, there's a baptism here in Acts 19. Jesus said and you know you just bring those scriptures in a loving way. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God bless you richly that was on my heart tonight. I trust it to bless you and God be with you. We have a few prayer requests tonight. We want to go. Thankful for the healthy baby. Brother Joseph and Sarah had a little baby boy, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I saw that picture. Very nice.

[Music] Brother Joe is requesting if I sang my song that I wrote. So, let's go to the key of A. Sometimes I do this one B flat, but I feel like it's still too high. So, we'll try A. So for everything that's good is made by the hands of God. He's the author of it all. Whether big or whether small, like the little baby laughing, or the gentle cool green, or the smell after the rain, it's all him. I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus in the clouds. I see Jesus in the sunlight and the moon and the stars. I see Jesus in the good times. I see Jesus in the bad. He is there no matter where we are. He's the same yesterday and today and tomorrow. You will find him in simplicity. You don't need to look far. He's in brotherly kindness. Peace and joy. He's in faith. Give a chance. You'll get a glance of him. I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus in the clouds. I see Jesus in the sunlight and the moon and the stars. I see Jesus in the good times. I see Jesus in the bad. He is there no matter where we are. And he was there on sunset mountain as a mighty whirlwind. He was in the burning bush, but it was not consumed. He was there as a pillar of fire. He was there as a pillar of cloud. He washed away all my sins. Praise. Let's take the last verse. He is knocking on the door to enter into your heart. If you let him in today, his presence won't depart. Simply ask him to reside and give him full control. He will never be the same again. I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus in the clouds. I see Jesus in the sunlight and the moon and the stars. I see Jesus in the good times. I see Jesus in the bad. He is there no matter where we are. I see Jesus in each rainbow. I see Jesus in the clouds. I see Jesus in the sunlight and the moon and the stars. I see Jesus in the good time. I see Jesus in the bad. He is there no matter where we are. Amen. The Lord gave me all those verses in like maybe four or five minutes and just I wrote all them down in the course and I was like, "Oh, thank you, Lord." And it's just been a blessing to me. So, Brother Edward, it's so good to see you. Could I pull on you to dismiss us with a word of prayer? [Music] God bless you. It's good to see each and everyone. Let's go to the Lord in prayer tonight. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, it's good to be in your house, Lord, and to worship you, feel your presence, Lord, and to Lord, to hear the word. Thank you for the name that you put above every other name, Lord. Lord, the authority in that name, the power in that name, Lord, the victory that you won through that name you gave to the church, Lord. And it's through that name, oh God. Thank you for a restoration, Lord. The truth to seal it, Lord, and to use it, oh God. We It would be no good to us if we didn't know how to use it, Lord. And you've instructed us and showed us the way, Lord. Grateful for that, Lord. Thank you for each one here, Lord. These prayer requests that have been brought before you tonight, Lord, through sincere hearts, Lord, sincere needs, Lord. God, you allow things into our lives, Lord, to draw us deeper into you, Lord, through need, Lord. Sometimes through sorrow, sometimes, Lord, through hard times, but it's for a deeper walk with you, Lord. We commit each and everyone into your hands tonight. Go with each one. Bless us, Lord. Keep us close to you, Lord. Keep our eyes on you. Raise us up, Lord. A step higher, Lord. A step closer to you, Lord. Let us be like Enoch and walk with you. And one day, Lord, Lord willing, we won't be found. Pray these things tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] Let's go to the key of E flat. [Music] As I travel through this pilgrim land, there is a friend who walks with me. [Music] Leads me safely through the sinking sand. It is the Christ of Calary [Applause] and this would be my prayer. Dear Lord, each day help me do the best I can. For I need thy light to guide me day and night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand. Jesus, hold my hand. I need thee every hour. And through this filled man, protect me by thy saving power and hear my feeble feet. Oh Lord, look down on me. When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand and let me travel in the light divine that I may see the blessed way. [Music] Keep me that I may be holy.
