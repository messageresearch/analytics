But in the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. Oh, trouble's coming, but I'll not be afraid. Oh, trouble's coming, but I'm not troubled. Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on its way. But in the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. Trouble's coming. I'll not be afraid. In the days of Sodom, Sodom and Gomorrah, they were sinning left and right, sinning night and day. They wouldn't listen, so they were blinded. When trouble's coming, best get out the way. Oh, trouble's coming, but I'm not troubled. Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on its way. But in the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. Trouble's coming. I'll not be afraid. In the days of Noah, well, they were scientific. They could shoot the moon and say there was no rain. They didn't need no prophet Noah. So God sent Wormwood to wash those foolish men away. Oh, trouble's coming, but I'm not troubled. Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on its way. But in the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his famil. Trouble's coming, but I'll not be afraid. In the days of Moses, they were a stiff necked people. They could see the hand of God, but still complain. And there were those who spoke against the prophet. Evil's coming, but I'm not troubled. Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on its way. But in the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. Trouble's coming. I'll not be afraid. In the days of Elijah, well, there were many prophets, 450 of Baal worshiping the sun. But only one man could pray down the fire. He took them down to the river and he slew them. Everyone, oh, trouble's coming, but I'm not trouble. Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on its way. But in the time of trouble, he'll hide in his pavilion. Trouble's coming. I'll not be afraid. Now, there are those who say they knew our prophet. But they say he made mistakes. Oh, what a shame. What kind of watered down message do they follow? I say the prophets's right and Jesus Christ is still the same. Oh, trouble's coming, but I'm not troubled. Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on its way. But in the time of trouble, he'll hide me in his pavilion. Trouble's coming. I'll not be afraid. Oh, trouble's coming, but I'm not troubled. Trouble's coming.

Troules coming. I'll not be afraid. Amen. Thank you. It's a blessing to be here again today. And I want to say um this is going to be our last service here with you. And uh it's been kind of refreshing both physically and spiritually with our feet under your tables at the various places and the times we've had both natural and spiritual fellowship. It's been great. And uh thank you so much. If we don't uh cross paths again on this side, we'll we'll be looking for one another. I kind of thinking of how brother Bram said about him going and sister hope and said uh when I come just start hauling Bill and I think that's maybe I don't know what it'll be just like when we get to the other side but I think we'll be look for me for I'll be there somewhere maybe it take a thousand years well well the first thousand years we'll be here but but we're looking for that's the greatest consolation we have the body change how marvelous how wonderful Oh, give me a key of C. Start there. See, a little higher. I stand up. Keep what was that key? See, try a little higher. C D E. I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarine. And I wondered how he could love me a sinner condemned. I guess I don't know that one. How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. For me it was in the garden. He prayed not my will but thine. Oh, he had no tears for his own griefs but sweat drops of blood for mine. Sing it with me. How marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be. How marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love for me. Yes. How marvelous, how wonderful, and my son shall ever be.

We certainly welcome each of you and we certainly welcome the sweet Holy Spirit in our midst. and we come to receive from him. So, God bless you, saints. Is I had a change in my plans. I felt to stay back for I was supposed to be in Colombia. So, but the Lord worked it out for me to be here tonight and I postponed that trip. And so, God is in control of all things. And Amen. And so, we're happy to have a good friend uh to our ministry and good friend and to the body of Christ is Brother Gerald Hughes. from Columbia, South Carolina. I was supposed to be in Colombia, South America, but the Lord sent the pastor from Columbia, South Carolina to be with us tonight, and we we'll take all that the Lord has for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we welcome each of you to the house of the Lord. Let's stand to our feet and we'll sing a uh a little bit of that old hymn of the church, Amazing Grace. I'll let him just come right forward and make himself at home. Amen. See grace, how sweet the sound that save like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. Was grace. Was grace. Oh my heart to fear and grace. Grace fears freely. our prayer. It's just that grace grace appear the hour I first be God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we've been up there 10,000 years Bright, shining as the sun, &gt;&gt; we've no less days &gt;&gt; to sing God's praise &gt;&gt; than when we first begun. &gt;&gt; Won't that be wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. wish a future home of the earthly bride and the heavenly bride. Where is your break ground? If you have your Bibles, turn with me to the book of Ephesians, chapter five. And I'd like to draw your attention to verse 32. And uh you should never come to Sunday school class without your curriculum. Always bring your textbook. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's good to see all these Bibles. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We greet you in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And it's just a real honor for me to be here. Amen. To &gt;&gt; uh testimony of the grace of God in my life. &gt;&gt; And I really do deem this a very special privilege, &gt;&gt; a real honor to me to stand in the presence of God's children and especially with my good friend, brother Israel Pope. Now, one verse of scripture here and then I'll let you be seated. If you promise to stay awake, &gt;&gt; okay? Otherwise, well, I can sit down. You can I'll keep you standing. We don't want you going to sleep on the preacher. &gt;&gt; You know, there's only one thing worse than going to sleep on the preacher. &gt;&gt; That's for the preacher to go to sleep on the congregation. We don't want that to happen. I got a little nap today, so I'm okay. Have to get a little power nap once in a while. Some of these old-timers know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was real short, but it was sweet. Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 32. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Let's bow our heads for just a word of prayer now. And uh perhaps you've already had prayer requests, but with our heads bowed, I want you to ask just look into your heart and say, "What's in your heart?" With your eyes closed, say, "Lord, what's my purpose of being here tonight? And what do I need from thee? What do I need from you, Lord?" And then our thoughts, remember now our thoughts, your thoughts, my thoughts, they speak louder in heaven than our words do on earth. &gt;&gt; So God knows the need of your heart. He knows the burden of your heart. And he's able to minister to that need right here in this service tonight. Amen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Sure he is. Heavenly Father, we've read your word and we submit ourselves to you now, endeavoring, Lord, to submit ourselves, surrender ourselves, but Lord, yet it takes you to consecrate us. And we pray now that you'll uh just minister to every need that is among us. We're all needy people, Lord. Some might need healing, some might need financial blessings, Lord, spiritual blessings, whatever it might be. And it's not difficult for us to ask this because it's written in your word. &gt;&gt; You've expressed your desires. You said, "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prosperth." &gt;&gt; So, we're here seeking first the kingdom of God in his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Our righteousness is as filthy rags, Lord. We don't want to trust in that at all. We don't bring that in our prayer. We don't think of our our we have none Lord but your righteousness &gt;&gt; Lord is what we want imputed to us in this prayer and in this service tonight help us we pray minister to us continue to bless this assembly Lord uh with their new church and oh Lord I pray that you'll just fill up every pew Lord and just pour out a blessing Lord that we wouldn't have room to contain it &gt;&gt; and each little liquid fire that has come tonight. Lord, may it manifest as the pillar of fire in our midst. Grant it, Lord. The person of the pillar of fire, the love, the lovely Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Grant these blessings. Look into every heart. Minister to every need through your word. &gt;&gt; We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If you'll shake your neighbor's hand, I'll let you be seated. Or behind you or in front of you, say, "God bless you, pilgrim. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. First of all, I wanted to bring a good report because the Lord uh has certainly been answering prayer and um there's so many things of course that we could say about that. But uh the prayer request was made last night. a very very special prayer request for me. And uh it was uh it's it's this thing is a lot like my token. It's my passport. And I got a fresh one this morning right here from Tucson. And I'm so thankful because this is part of my purpose of being here today was just to get this passport. And um I just uh what happened? I'll try to be real brief, but um I've had to go in I've had passports lost in the mail so often that they reported it as stolen. Then then whenever you report it stolen, then they they don't want to give you another passport. You know, somebody stole it or you misusing it or whatever. So the last passport I got, they only gave it to me for one year because of that. And so this time I gathered up all all the passports that I could find. &gt;&gt; One, two, three, four, five, and now I got number six. And I think there's the number seven they kept up there. So I've got about seven or eight passports. None of them, as far as I know, have ever been stolen. Okay? But when I showed them all these passports, they gave me a fresh one. Guess what? This is a great blessing. And I the devil really tried to make me doubt. It's okay to doubt if you doubt your doubts. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. Brother Brandham was quoting brother Bosorth on that one. I think he said it's okay to doubt as long as you just doubt your doubts. &gt;&gt; But uh this passport is good for another 10 years. January 14th of January. Is today the 14th? &gt;&gt; 14th of January. Uh 2026. the 13th of January, 2036. And this old-timer will be 80 in the month of May. And um in the month of May, 10 years from now, I'll be 90. So you pray the Lord just keep me pressing the battle. I appreciate your prayers. the the brothers prayed last night that we'd be able to get this passport and it came one of the easiest um answers to prayer, you know, and of course, uh the enemy has fought me today, but we won't go there. We don't want to give the devil any do. Is that right? We don't want to We're not here to praise the devil. We're here to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the devil all he all he is is just a big bluff. Amen. Just a big bluff. &gt;&gt; He was absolutely stripped of any right or authority power that he had at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was stripped. And uh so tonight I I want to share with you. I uh just a little brief testimony and then we'll go right into the message. you know, uh I think it was Hudson Taylor or one of the great missionaries might have been uh him I believe it was brother Brennham quoted a young man asked him should I now that I've got converted should I go to Bible college and four years and this that and the other get my degree oh he said no son don't do that he said why don't wait till the candle is have burned out just go tell how your candle got lit &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and so uh I um I didn't know what to do, but in I'd heard a few tapes in 1960, well actually the Lord got a hold of me in 1964. And I mean, he had to do a a real work on me. He brought sanctification into my heart and life. Took away uh alcohol and nicotine. And by the grace of the Lord, I never did get hooked on drugs. But um he and just by the grace of God, but he he changed my desires. &gt;&gt; You know, I drink all I want to and I smoke all I want to, but I just don't want to. &gt;&gt; He took away the want to. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it happened real, you know, supernaturally. &gt;&gt; And um that was in ' 64. I'd been so mean and stubbornheaded and hard-hearted. It took about a year of fasting and praying and trying to, you know, where I could even really believe I could be saved. I I so, you know, but I felt his presence and I knew, oh, I knew he was real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so then, uh, I had worked with brother Bud Chambers. Some of you might have heard of him, a tent revivalist in there in the latter part of 64 and 65. Then I was drafted into the military. I didn't get to meet brother Brandham. Uh I was drafted in during the Vietnam era and instead of however sending me to uh Vietnam. Now if they'd have got a hold of me a little bit sooner, I'd have been ready to shed blood. But after the Lord got a hold of me, I actually uh it was during the draft, mandatory draft. And so I registered as a conscientious objector. I'd shed enough blood, you know, and uh but now they didn't pay any attention to that. They throwed a rifle in my hand and put me out there and taught me handtohand combat and how to familiarize with the old M14 and so forth. And uh I thought, sure, it looked like they was going to send me to Vietnam, but they sent me to Germany. Uh two months of advanced uh two months of basic training in Fort Benning, Georgia. Two months of advanced individual training. We called it AIT in Fort Leonardwood, Missouri. And then they sent most of my unit, that's the Army Corps of Engineers. And they sent most of my unit to Vietnam and most of them didn't come back. Okay, that's the truth. But they God by his grace sent me to Germany. And so there the Lord blessed me tremendously. I had surrendered to the Lord and was subject. It was those two years in Germany was good for me. And they gave me a honorable discharge, believe it or not. And uh a good conduct medal. In fact, and now it wasn't me at all. It was just the grace of God. You understand? I hadn't even recognized the message yet. But they also chose myself and one other soldier as the two outstanding soldiers of the whole 237th Engineer Battalion. And I got to come home free on a on a 40 day 30 40-day leave. And uh but I said all that to say this. I really didn't get my candle lit until I come to the light of this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got out of the army in ' 67. Drifted in ' 65, last part of 65. Got out in the latter part of ' 67 and uh started my public ministry. I well actually they wanted me to reup. They offered me quite a bit of money if I would reup um take another two or three years stent with them. But I said no I uh I said I'm feeling in my heart that I've got to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; And I said I can't do it as a GI government issue. It's got to be a God issue. &gt;&gt; And I I have to take my orders from him not from you all. Amen. And so um then uh I got out started my public ministry in 1967 and uh it really trend in my concept you know uh didn't have any revelation of water baptism but then as the Lord began to unfold the scriptures to me and uh I ministered mostly in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas just mostly little independent churches. They tried to get me to join the UPC and the Assembly of God churches, but I just oh I just something in my heart said, "No, you better not do that." And so anyway, I just said that to say this that uh eventually then uh I I seen water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 238, &gt;&gt; Acts 6, Acts 19, you know, it's all through the scriptures. And no, no in titles, father, son, and holy ghost. I seen the importance of the name of the lovely Lord Jesus. Well, when I started preaching one God and water baptism and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I become a false prophet to all my trinitarian friends. &gt;&gt; And my popularity went way down real quick. But I believe that I had to walk in that light. You understand? And if you don't walk in the light God reveals to you, regardless of how little it is, what it is, you must walk in that light. &gt;&gt; Okay? Then God began to open up more light to me. And that's whenever, now I see I'm just slow and uh actually right after I was the Lord had got a hold of me when I was 17 years old, one of the first books that was given to me was a man sent from God. I read that. But I want you to remember now that really doesn't place brother Brandham in the scriptures. It's an outstanding message book. Uh Gordon Lindsay uh was helped him with that and so forth. But then in 19 after hearing a few tapes uh there uh still in Northwest Arkansas. Uh but after hearing a few tapes of brother Brandham, I still didn't catch it. I couldn't I I knew there was something special about that. And then uh this thought of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth. And um so then uh I was invited to a service where brother Junior Jackson, you've heard brother uh brother Brandham speak of brother Jackson. &gt;&gt; He was ministering over in Prior Oklahoma in 1968 at brother Ever Thornton's church. And I I was invited to go to that and my friend of mine uh came into the message about the same time with me. We went that night. Brother Jackson preached a message entitled royalty introduced. And of course he was showing Jesus Christ is royalty, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; But he showed he also he had to have an introduction. Proper royalty must have a proper introduction. And so he showed John the Baptist all the scriptures pertaining to his first advent. Malachi 3, uh, Isaiah 40, except the voice one crying in the wilderness, all these scriptures speaking of John's ministry. &gt;&gt; But he said, if you'll notice, John's name wasn't in the Bible until after his ministry. Okay? And so then after he said, now if he is the same, Malachi 3:6, I'm God and I change not. Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and if he's God and he doesn't change his way or his tactics whatever his mannerism you know his principles doesn't change then he must have a forerunner at his second advent and here we are now at the second advent but where is the forerunner where is the message that's the do the forerunning and he began to show then all the scriptures oh my Luke 17, Revelations 10, Malachi 4, all of these scriptures. And then I I seen then Brother Brennham's ministry right in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You understand? And not just Brother Brandham's ministry, it's your ministry. &gt;&gt; It's our ministry. &gt;&gt; Do you realize um I'm going to embarrass myself. I had such a good time last night with the brothers from Canada and so forth. And um uh right, how do you pronounce that last name, brother? &gt;&gt; Ding. &gt;&gt; Ding. Ding. Ding. Brother Dingwall. And of course, brother Minnow. He's a he's been a fish for a long time. Ma. He at one time he was a Ma. Now he's a big rainbow trout. But I had such a good time over brother Israel's and sister Po's place last night and they are well I better be careful. You all be invading their kitchen. But I surely did enjoy that meal too. And we had a wonderful time of fellowship and then I slipped off. Uh we had a little longer service last night than what we're going to have tonight. I'm I've already set my alarm here. So you help me. Uh if you'll listen real fast, I'll try to get done real fast. Okay. And that clock on the wall is not right back there. Something's off, I think, because it's it says 41:22, but I've got a clock right here, and I have no excuses for holding you over time, and I realize it's Wednesday night. Okay, so uh brother uh the brother gave me he gave me a an hour. I asked and he gave me a whole hour. Sometimes back home, I only get 45 minutes. But tonight, but I've got I've got my alarm set. And I told him, I said, "Now, if I should happen to go overtime a little bit, I want you to pull my coat. You can pull it. I'm going right there." Where was I at? Okay. But look, uh, &gt;&gt; say it again. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um, yes. God used brother Jackson. And how many believe God still uses preachers? &gt;&gt; As long as you're saying the same thing, &gt;&gt; you're prophesying again &gt;&gt; as to say the same thing. Eat the book, John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you must prophesy again for many nations and kings and so forth. &gt;&gt; And the word prophesy means to say the same thing. You've got thus sayaith the Lord. So, uh, anyway, from there on, I really I just, you know, of course, I'll always appreciate Brother Jackson, and I expect to spend eternity with him, but I had to come right under Brother Brandham's ministry, you understand, and stay with the tapes and the the teachings there. And so, I started pastoring a little church there that Brother Brandham was instrumental in starting. Uh, he had come to Columbia, South Carolina twice. You'll find about four different messages recorded there, but I again I didn't get to meet him. Brother Ned Iverson was the first pastor there. And brother Jack Palmer, you've heard brother Brandham speak of brother Palmer. He invited me uh to go over and minister in his church in Mon, Georgia. And then he took me over to South Carolina where I ministered a couple of times there. And then Brother Ned resigned right after that. And um then they asked me to come back and pastor uh there. So actually um yeah, I pastored the same church since 1973. And so um that uh that doesn't make me a better pastor than anybody else. It just makes me more wore out. Okay? And I I'm I should be more without excuse than anybody else having had that opportunity so long. But then while I was there uh pastoring uh actually when I let me back up just a little bit when I got out of the army and this is going to be tying in with my message. Okay. &gt;&gt; I want to read a scripture now before I go forward in my little testimony and let's let's read um uh Song of Solomon chapter 8 and verse eight. Song of Solomon. You've got um Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and then I believe Song of Solomon. All right. And so chapter 8 is the last chapter and um verse eight. See if I can find it here myself. Yes. I want you to notice this and if the brother um yes here we are on the screen as well in case you uh can't find your Bible right quick. We have a little sister and she hath no breast. No breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? Now before we go forward, I want to remind you that in the message Christ the mystery of God revealed, brother Brandham said if you can read one scripture in the Bible and you don't see Jesus Christ in that scripture, you need to read it again. &gt;&gt; So everything should be focused on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's the principal theme of the Old Testament. He's the principal theme of the New Testament. And uh brother Brandham didn't really get to speak as much as I'm sure that he would like to have uh concerning uh this um but I'm going to ask my brother to skip forward just a little bit in this group of quotes that I've got. And I said I sure don't want to put my own interpretation to this scripture. So, I found where brother Brennham is referring to the Song of Solomon in the message uh future home of the earthly bride in the heavenly bridegroom. And um this is the only place that I could find. I'm not saying he didn't minister on it anywhere else, but I'm wondering if we could pull up that quote um on the screen if you will, my dear brother. And I want to I want to speak tonight. I want to speak on the subject of the mystery of marriage. Okay. How many people in here, husband or wife, that you are or have been married? Oh, that's the majority by far. Okay. Hands down, how many would need to like to be married? Okay. Well, that's that's good. Wonderful. Praise the Lord. You girls say these hands up front. You these boys don't look back. Okay. But now we all want to be married to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We should all say, "Amen. I want to be a member of the bride of Christ." Above all, God is a man. &gt;&gt; God wanted a bride before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; It's a godly attribute for a young man to want a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. and a young lady to want a a a husband. The best gift that God could give a man outside of salvation, the best gift that God could give a woman outside of salvation, a good husband or a good wife, a Christian one. But remember, he said, "You be sure they believe just exactly like you." Amen. If you get them before they get the Holy Ghost, you might get a &gt;&gt; you might instead of getting &gt;&gt; you you might get water in your blood. Amen. So, we don't want that. And so, here while I was there um in our brother be pointed that quote. It's from um future home of the earthly bride where brother Brandon refers to the Song of Solomon. It's among those little group of quotes that I gave you uh brother Nathan. now. But while I was there pastoring in Colombia, okay, uh confession that I actually uh was um pastoring for about two years before I got married. In those days, I was kind of uh oddball in so much that I was probably the youngest minister in the message. Now, I'm kind of oddball because I'm one of the oldest ministers in the message, but I'm certainly glad to be identified with brother Minnow. He's he's up there. He's my elder. And uh but I said that to say this that I'm not recommending somebody to pastor before they get married. Okay? Even though Paul, you know, he was I guess more than a pastor in so much that he was an apostle and setting the churches in order. But I I I ended up they wanted me to come and pastor. And so I went I said I can't do that exact exactly like that. But I said I'll minister for you for about six months and we'll take a vote and see how you know if you think you can put up with me and vice versa. I might not want to put up with you after six months. So we had a little six months trial and it was about 99%. you got to have some opposition. But it was about 99% that I should stay and pastor. And so, but I didn't really have a residence. And I was living in the church. Amen. A little church that they had bought in 1966. Uh, Brother Brandham had told Brother Arnett, uh, find a building and follow the leadership of the Lord. Brother Brandham had, Brother Arnett had asked Brother Brandham, should we start a church in Colombia? And so that's what they did. And I'm living in the back of this church. And uh while I was there, I had got 300 seed tapes from brother Perry Green. He was uh promoting the old real toss in those days, making them more available and so forth. And that was in our tape library at the church. And um that was that was my spiritual meet at due season. And uh then a good old fisherman uh there that he and I fished a lot together. Brother Kushman uh he was a real message believer also. Uh he I think he and brother Kelly had been to some of the meetings when brother Brandham had come to Colombia and so forth. In fact, brother Kelly told me he said I was sitting behind brother Brandham and I said in my heart, "Well, Lord, I would just like to shake the man's hand." you know he and brother Brennham turned his head away from the audience, reached back and shook his hand just soon as he thought that. He said, "God bless you, brother." Went back to preaching. But yeah, those were my fishing buddies. And uh but brother Kushman drowned. Uh I don't know if he had a heart attack while he's out fishing or whatever, but and his wife really wasn't didn't seem to be that um interested in the message. So she gave me all of his tapes. Now I've got 390 tapes. All reals to real. Well, I'm listening to one of these new tapes and um got to back up a little bit because and I'm trying to weave this into my message uh when I um was um before I was draft actually yeah before I was drafted into the army. This would have been in 1964 here. I'm 17 years old and I'm um the pastor's daughter was very beautiful. and she looked like an angel. She sung like an angel. &gt;&gt; She's only 16 years old, of course, but u I was infatuated with the pastor's daughter. We didn't get engaged, but we talked about marriage. And I mean, she could sing like an angel, come to the altar, speak in tongues like a an angel. I thought surely you know this is what I'm you know but I I I then as it come in I knew I was up for the draft and I knew if I got married I'd have to leave her perhaps you know and I sought the Lord about that and the Lord gave me a scripture over in Deuteronomy I believe it is now I don't remember the exact location of that scripture but you can do a little Bible search and under the law in Israel um it was forbidden to draft a man into the army that had just got married because he had to have two years at least to stay home with his wife and make a bond, you know, of that marriage. But they couldn't take him into into battle if he had just got married. That's uh was a law. The Lord gave me that scripture. I knew that law didn't exist in the United States. So I said by that, "Well, it's not the perfect will of the Lord for me to get married, at least at this time." Okay? But I did consider it. Okay? Then I was drafted. And to make a long story a little shorter, by the time I got out of the army back from Germany, my little dove had flew the coupe. She had uh was as her own mother told me, it was a forced marriage. Of course, now when I got out of the army, uh, they was making her available for me, but I knew that was not God's program. She had already gotten married. It was a forced marriage because she'd become expecting before the marriage. They had to get married to kind of cover up, I guess, the reproach and so forth. But you don't want to ever get involved in something like that, children. And then by the time I got out, she was already divorced, backslided, wearing pants, whatever, had a little child and of course was very available and even her. But when I learned that now, now listen, you can have an infatuation, you can have a feeling, that don't mean it's of God. You better check your Bible. You better check the message. Amen. You don't go by by infatuations, emotions, you know, sensations. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; You better take it to the word. &gt;&gt; And so I knew that was not God's program for me. And when I seen how close I come, brother Israel, &gt;&gt; to making the wrong choice. Yeah. How close I came to making the wrong choice. Now remember, if a good wife is the best thing God can give a man outside of salvation, then you need a revelation. If salvation is a revelation, you need an understanding and and the leadership of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We need to pray about these things. We need to be sure where we stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. But I had made a vow now in 1967, I believe is when I made this vow. And I said, "Lord, I'm not getting married unless or until you speak to me in an audible voice." This was before I come to the message. &gt;&gt; Okay? I knew God had a voice. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, unless you speak to me in an audible voice, showing me that that's the girl that I'm supposed to marry, I'm just not going to get married." I mean, I was because, hey, this little girl, I would stay awake of the night thinking about her. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was something there. I had I thought I had her in my heart, you know, and then I'm so disappointed. I'm so so I vowed God almighty. And I know the importance of a vow. You don't It's better to never make a vow than to make a vow a vow and break a vow. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Well, then from 67 forward. I didn't get married till 75. September 7th of last year, 2025. Just a couple of months ago, my wife and I had our 50th anniversary. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you real quickly how it happened. Uh the I'd heard brother Brennham say on t on on one of those tapes that I had, I am God's voice to you. &gt;&gt; Now I'd always wondered, in fact, I had hoped, brother Minnow, that I I I wish I hadn't made the vow. There was times I wished I hadn't made that vow, but the vow kept you kept me. As I kept the vow, it kept me kept me out of a lot of trouble. Okay? And because there back in those days, believe it or not, I thought I was handsome. They thought I was too. But nonetheless, the vow kept me. Okay. And uh I by the grace of the Lord, I kept the vow. Oh, but then I was in Jeffersonville in 63. 63. No, not 63. Let's see. Wait a minute. I said 60. No, it'd be about uh three years before it would be 73 because I didn't get married till 75, 1975. So in about 1973, I believe uh is when I I was introduced to this young lady in during one of the services brother Billy Paul would have uh in those days with brother Collins. I think was is right after I believe it was after brother Neville had passed on. I did get to meet brother Neville, but didn't get to fellowship with him personally. Uh I've been in brother Collins home. Uh he was the longest serving pastor, you know, about over 30 years there at the pastor at the Brandon Tabernacle. Been in his home several times. But um there uh I had um I'd made this vow and listening to the tapes then I heard brother Brandham say I am God's voice to you. &gt;&gt; But I'd met this young lady and um then her daddy was a minister and they had services in their home. I'd been in their home and ministered also. And I knew there was something special about this girl, but I didn't dare, you know, I I I still very, you know, I remembered my vow. And so then u I believe it I'd known her for two or three years and we conversed a little bit um and but really didn't didn't get close and so forth. But then uh I invited her father down to minister for us and the she happened to come along with her mother and so forth. And u so I had the opportunity then to tell her about my vow. I said now uh this is what I vowed to the Lord and kind of what happened there. And I said, "But now if if the Lord should show me that you was the one, you know, big if there would would you marry me?" Oh, I was expecting her to. Well, of course, of course. No, no, no, no, no. She didn't do that. &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, probably." I said, "Probably." She said, "Well, I you if it's the Lord's will." Yes, if it's the Lord's will. I said, "Well, you wouldn't want it and I wouldn't want it either if it wasn't the Lord's will." &gt;&gt; Okay. But I just wanted to share my vow with you there and show you to understand maybe why I wasn't, you know, communicating anymore or whatever. All right. So, she went back to Michigan with her parents and I said, "Be pray. Pray." Okay. So during that time, I'm living in the back of the church and I'd got these extra uh 90 tapes and I'm listening to the tapes. We're doing a little outreach down in Charleston and so forth area um on Tuesday nights, you know, three services, four services a week was having them. And you know, the Bible says so much the more as we see that day approach. And so, but anyway, uh I was searching one of the tapes to get some inspiration to minister the next night down in Charleston, I believe it was, uh on the coast. And uh so I get this new tape. I never heard it before. Secret sudden going away at the church and I already knew, brother Brennham said, "Now I am God's voice to you." He said, "Now I I felt somebody resent that, &gt;&gt; but I when the angel of the Lord moves down, I am God's voice to you." He said, "That was him." said it that time. &gt;&gt; All right. So, this was in the back of my mind, but I didn't know, you know, I I it stood out to me. But, uh, here I am now listening to the, uh, well, I've got to weave this in real quick. My u sister Cheryl is my wife's name. And we had wrote one or two letters. And in this after after the uh after me telling her about the vow, she writes this big long letter, four or five pages, and she says, "I'm sorry. God will never show you anything about me. I'm unworthy to be your wife." That was a real let down. I thought, "Well, she knows I'm a a minister. She knows a minister supposed to marry a virgin. She knows the message." I thought, "Well, maybe maybe she's not a virgin. Maybe this, maybe that." And so, I get on the old crank up telephone, you know, called her up and and uh I didn't know how to cross-examine her exactly, but oh no, Brother Hughes, I've never known another man, nothing like that. But God's just he'll never show you anything about me, you know, and uh I'm just unworthy. Okay. Well, I that was the all the way through that telephone conversation, it concluded like that. I'm unworthy. After getting a letter, saying she's unworthy, I called her up and then at the conclusion of that, I'm unworthy. Okay. So, now I'm listening to this message. I'm up in the middle of the bed with my legs crossed and um have this Sony realtore and I just got it a new tape. I used to have an old Wallen sack and I and about worry it out. I got a new uh Sony from brother Perry Green and u uh so I'm listening to this old realtore tape and brother Brandham is telling about the armor meat packing boy that went west to look for a wife and he tells it different on different tapes you know a little bit different uh so forth and uh but on this particular tape he he he knew that that wasn't the kind of wives that he wanted them shoot them up you dancers and so forth. And so he went out and sit on the corral in disappointed uh you know I think it was from Chicago area. But anyway uh he sees this little uh the little was it a nephew or niece or something little orphan girl throwing out the dishwater and he said now that's the kind of wife I'd want somebody to go stay in the kitchen stay in the home. By the way, did you know what brother Brennham said? When you take the woman out of the kitchen, you take her out of the will of the Lord. He said it. Don't put them out here on the on the motorcycles trying to be a police lady. Okay? Keep them in their place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he wasn't legalistic and you and I'm not trying to in insert something new or different. You understand? But we need This is what he was looking for. He's looking for a housekeeper. He's looking for a wife. looking for a mother for his children. Amen. Somebody to help build a home. He didn't want these dancers and flurers and so forth. And so he asked her, you know, do you know why I'm here? He got out there, you know, and stood between her and the house whenever she was throwing out the dishwater. She was embarrassed, barefooted perhaps, and so forth. And he said, would you you know why I'm here? She said, "No." She said, "I'm looking for a wife." I'm paraphrasing now. You can go listen to the tape. I think it's secret sudden going away the church. Something like that. And uh so he said uh uh uh would you marry marry me? She said, "Oh, I I'm unworthy. I'm unworthy." I stopped the tape. It was one of those twist knobs. I put it on rewind. I played that part again. She said the same thing. I'm unworthy. And I thought, you know, people hear what they want to hear on tape and they people hear what they they they they read what they want to read out of the Bible, too. See what they want to see. Now, I don't during this two or three weeks after telling her and we'd start praying, I had some dreams. I I seen her name in the Bible and my name in the Bible, and that's all. But that wasn't my vow. See, that was the only thing that was in this particular Bible that I seen in my dream was her first name and my first name. Cheryl and Gerald, big deep letters, like in the Old and New Testament. That's the only two names in the book. I could have said, "Oh, this is Oh, praise the Lord." You know, this is God speaking to me. But that wasn't my vow. the vow that I made. Lord, you'll have to speak to me in an audible voice and I'll have to know that it's you and you'll have to tell me that's a girl. And so I I rewound the tape two or three times. You know what it said the third time that I played it? &gt;&gt; Exactly the same thing. The tapes always say the same thing. You can't make them say anything different. But I I Lord, are you talking to me? Could you be speaking to me? I cut off the tape right there. I went in out of the little bedroom area into the auditorium of the church like through the room here and just the light shining uh the main I didn't turn the main lights on, just let it shine through the door. I started praying. Lord, I know that people hear what they want to hear, but is it possible that you could be speaking to me through this tape, &gt;&gt; through this? Well, I didn't tell anybody. And so, but I had I had some assurance there while I was in prayer that that was the that was the Lord. Well, it just so happened the next day or so they was having a a meeting in in Hardy, Arkansas. I think his brother Earl Martin's church, you've heard brother me speak of him. And u my parents uh my future father-in-law and mother-in-law didn't come, but my future wife to be was there with her brother-in-law and and sister. And so I I learned that and I I I got my little old I had a little old Jeep Commander U convertible hard top. I jumped in that little six-cylinder Jeep and I headed for Arkansas and u I got permission to take her home that night and I we found a place to park and I told her just what had happened and we talked about my background, she talked about her background and that night we if it's okay with daddy now uh I said and then she said, "Oh yes, yes, I will." That's the Lord. It's the Lord. And I said, "But we got to call your daddy." We got him out of bed. His name was Charles. How many heard the last story how Brother Bannon got married? &gt;&gt; And uh his I think that was with Hope, the first one, his father-in-law's name was Charles. &gt;&gt; Well, my father-in-law's name was is Charles was Charles. He's passed on now. Uh Brother Charles Ray Davis, a great minister of the gospel in this message. And uh but he he was already a bit asleep and I I got him up on the phone and uh and uh uh he answered the phone and I said, "Would you come out on the porch and talk to me a little bit?" He didn't catch it, you know. So I finally had to ask him um I I the reason I'm calling, could I marry your daughter? And um why son? He said, "I can't think of another man that I'd rather have as a son-in-law than you." And he said, "In fact, the Lord showed me that you was going to be my son-in-law." &gt;&gt; So, a father is very responsible. Young man, don't bypass the daddy of the girl you're courting. Okay? &gt;&gt; Respect. Amen. Don't just go and honk the horn. &gt;&gt; Amen. You show respect. Okay? But here I want I want to kind of leave that real shortly there. I will say this that uh she's been a real jewel and um she has bore born nine children. We had three uh sons and six daughters and by the grace of the Lord they're all serving the Lord except at right now except my youngest daughter. I want you to remember her in prayer. Shakina Joy Melvin and she lives down in Destin Florida and they've been out of church for some time. So please remember them in prayer. But all of our children and grandchildren are serving the Lord in the light of this message to the best of their understanding. I don't have a doctrine that you have to come to my church to be saved. I didn't require that of the son-in-laws that were asking for my daughters, you know, and uh so but I u we had let's see two years ago in November, not November of 25, but November of 24, we had a a kind of a family reunion and um I was really blessed to realize that we hadn't had a single death in our family for all these 50 years. 50 years. And um with with the son-in-laws and the daughter-in-laws and the grandchildren, there's 45 of us. We have 26 or 27 grandchildren now, I think. And then the uh son-in-laws and daughter-in-laws, everybody there. Uh we had a total of about 45 in the in the Hughes tribe. And so I am so thankful. I don't get to testify to that very much. But I want to come back to my message and wrap it up here now. Um because I know this phone is going to keep its tone here. Um you help me please because this thing don't look like it. What I did this evening, the reason I was about a couple minutes late at the church, I set the alarm and I must have put PM instead of or AM instead of PM because it never did go off and I was a couple minutes late. So anyway, how many will give me five more minutes? &gt;&gt; 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Oh, I can preach a long time. &gt;&gt; No, no, not really. We've got a brother down in South Carolina. He's a little African-American brother. And um he'll preach about five or 10 minutes and he'll say, "I'm closing." He preach about an hour later, he say, "I'm closing." Preach another hour. I'm closing. They said, "Why do you keep saying I'm closing?" He said, 'Well, I don't like to preach to people that's asleep. Every time I say I'm closing, everybody wakes up. I want to wrap this up, bring it to a little point here. U you know, marriage is sacred. Marriage, the prophet said, belongs in the church. And um I in Revelation chapter well look at this. Okay let's look at this. Can is it okay if we just play this little portion of this little clip? Okay let's God's servant and prophet brother Brandham. Let's just play this little clip right here. Wish we had time now. I got March here. Solomon courting this girl, the bride. Oh, we just have to admit it's getting too late. I'll get it again. When he tries to get her, but she's engaged to a shepherd boy. Some Paul thought that was a song he sang. Oh, no. Solomon was a throne uh inherit of David. Yeah. &gt;&gt; On earth, but showed that kingdom had to pass away. was a type of Christ in love with the bride. See, notice that Jesus said John 14, now go and prepare a place. Oh, what will it look like? Did you ever think now, bride, what it will look like? It is prepared and designed by the divine architect. &gt;&gt; What will that city look like? Now, we're going to talk about it for a few minutes. The divine architect has prepared it. Designed it. &gt;&gt; And look, he's designed it with tender hands for his beloved bride. &gt;&gt; What's it going to look like? &gt;&gt; Could you imagine a man marrying a wife that's able? How he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touch? Just what she'd like. Amen. Now the divine architect has designed the new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch. &gt;&gt; No wonder the apostle said eye has not seen the ear is not heard but neither has ever entered the heart of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can probe into it just for a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See what it's going to look like. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the &gt;&gt; brother. Thank you. I just now I did you catch that? See, it's a type of Christ and the bride. Now, when when when you read the Song of Solomon, be sure that you're thinking of Christ. See, you need a pure heart to read the Song of Solomon. You need cleansed mind to read the Song of Solomon properly. And so uh here now I I want to uh just see if we can bring in something here and uh I'd like to endeavor to speak just by inspiration for a few minutes. Um, I want you to notice and brothers if you will just bring these quotes up as I refer to them and uh we'll try to condense because what I'd like to leave with you tonight is how that uh in 19 6 or was it 63 that he preached seed is not not seed is not air with spoken word is original seed. In that message, spoken word is original seed. He read what the Holy Spirit told him to write. Take up your pen and write. And in reading that and weaving it in on the tape, he said, "Here's the secret of this. &gt;&gt; The word is in the bride." &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, that's on tape. &gt;&gt; The word. Now, remember, the word is the original seed, the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Okay? Not just the written word, but the spoken word. It's got to be spoken. All right. Now, then when the church age book came out in 1965, he had already preached the seals. And interwoven into the church age book is the revelation of the seals, even though he's just dealing with the church ages, chapters 1, two, and three of Revelation. But now in there, he adds a little word to it. Check your B. Check your check your uh Now, he's not adding to the word. But it's a further information, a little deeper understanding. Okay. So now when the when he pre when he writes a church age book, he records that same thing again. Take a pen and write where. Okay. And in there he said the word is in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; And that's in parenthesis. Okay. As it was in Mary. Okay. My question, how did it get in Mary? The angel Gabriel brought it to her. &gt;&gt; How did the word get in the bride, &gt;&gt; the angel of Revelation 10:7, &gt;&gt; spoken word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Vindicated &gt;&gt; puts the word. See, and he said the word is in there. Okay. But now here's my thought tonight. &gt;&gt; And I, you know, he will not marry an immature bride. &gt;&gt; We have a little sister. What shall we do for her in the day that she spoke? This is the day. Okay. We must mature spiritually and we must m ripen in the presence of the Lord &gt;&gt; to come to this invisible union. &gt;&gt; Now, I I I've got these quotes and I won't take time to read them tonight. I won't have time and we've got some different scriptures. I won't take time to do that. But if you'd like to get the quotes, I've given them to brother Nathan. And here I'm just going to refer to some of them. Okay. Now, in the message proving his word, listen to this. I just caught this a year or so back, the depth of it, the sincerity of it in the message proving his word 604. Uh, and he preached that twice. So, be sure you listen to the right one. But there brother Brandham said the union see comes right through this when the son of man comes down and is manifested in flesh. Okay. And that unites the the the bride and and Christ together the church. And he said we go to the there he said we go to the wedding supper not the marriage. &gt;&gt; He's making a distinction. go to we go to the weddings. She's already united here. &gt;&gt; All right. This this ties in perfectly with the message entitled the invisible union. &gt;&gt; The invisible union of Christ, you know, and his bride. &gt;&gt; Okay. So then, like I said, my own little testimony there is is is relevant. If the if the lady is pregnant before the marriage, something's bad wrong. Something's way out of order. Somebody got too close. Okay. But God is a God of order. Fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife. He told Joseph. So the engagement is is the marriage in God's eyes. But that doesn't give you right to that young lady or vice versa. &gt;&gt; Amen. you you should never even kiss until the veil is lifted in the marriage uh at the marriage ceremony. Is that right? Is that what the prophet taught us? And forsaking all others will thou cleave only to this man. And forsaking all others, will you cleave only to this woman? &gt;&gt; Amen. That does away with your polygamy and all that stuff, you know, in the wrong way. But now watch here. He he says the the when that lifegiving flow comes in, the womb is sealed. &gt;&gt; Now, we're speaking spiritually. The womb of your heart, the womb of your mind, the womb of your soul is sealed. She can't commit adultery. &gt;&gt; So, the invisible union has to take place here. &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual union. And brother Brandham calls it a marriage. Do your word search. She's already married to the virtuous son of God. He said, "Never sinned in the first place." &gt;&gt; Amen. He will not marry a fallen woman. &gt;&gt; God see gave Adam a bride. But before he could marry her, she had fallen. He gave Christ a bride on the day of Pentecost. And brother Brandham in this church age book there he says and before he could marry her she also had fallen &gt;&gt; this day. See God saved the best of last. &gt;&gt; This is a greater day than that was. It was not ordained in the program of God for a marriage to take place between Christ and his bride 2,000 years ago. In the great plan of redemption, God reserved it for this day. And this message coming forth creates a bride. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom himself creating his own bride. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We've got to come and realize that we're already Hey, listen. The the what was in the womb of Mary? Isaiah 9:6. A son is given, a child is born. His name shall be called counselor, prince of peace, mighty God, everlasting father, etc. All right. That's what's in you. That's what's in the true bride today. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; But listen, here's what I'm going to say now in closing. We can't leave it in the womb. &gt;&gt; The word that was way back in six, that was 60 years ago when brother Benham said it's in the bride as it was in Mary. &gt;&gt; But see it, we can't leave it there. We've got to It's no It's no longer Christ. Amen. In the uh in the in in the cradle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's no longer It can't be Christ in, you know, somewhere else. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; And and we must come to this fullness of the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; To the perfect man.

That little Where is John? uh our song leader uh yeah come my dear brother if you will brother Noah and uh let's just bow our heads for a moment heavenly father we do know one thing &gt;&gt; that we the testimony of Jesus Christ is a spirit of prophecy and Lord if We can just tell how our candle got lit. Sometimes it means more than all of our theology. Our experiences, Lord, if they come from you, they were ordained from before the foundation of the world. And Lord, we know that your word can never return void. in my own mixed up way. Lord, I pray you'll take this little testimony tonight. These few scriptures we've referred to, these few quotes that we've referred to. And Lord, I pray that you would just embed them deep into our hearts and cause us to be more sincere, more hungry, have a greater capacity to hear the word of God, seeking revelation in a a more simple way than ever before. remembering how your servant and prophet said the need for divine revelation by the spirit can never be overemphasized. And Lord, we know revelation is sovereignly given. It doesn't come through the preacher. It comes through God. And Lord, we know you use the preacher, but yet Lord, it takes you. So may we seek you, seek your face. The first recorded words, how is it that you sought me? the first recorded words of the word when the word was made flesh. Knowest thou not that I must be about my father's business? Lord, let us seek you with all of our hearts. Love you. You're our eternal soulmate, Lord. You're you're our breath. You're our life. You're our sunshine. Let us love you more than our husband, more than our wife, more than anything, Lord. You come first, oh God. This is the name whereby she shall be called to the Lord our righteousness. We have none of our own. Lord, it's yours. Father, I pray that you'll minister to every need that is in our midst tonight. Now, with our heads bowed just a moment, I wonder if there might be somebody here, you'd say, "Brother Hughes, I I really realize that I I need a deeper walk with God. I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost." Lift your hand high. I want to pray for you. Heavenly Father, you see these hands, several hands, and you know their hearts. Lord, we just want to love you more. If we just fall in love with you, everything will work out just fine. As your servant prophet said, you have your day at Calvary and God will have his way with you. Lord, let us die to our own desires, our own motives, our own objectives, Lord, and let us be filled with your love and your spirit. Oh granted, heavenly father, give us a greater capacity to receive your word, the living word of God, grant it, dear God. &gt;&gt; Minister to every need, physically, spiritually, financially, whatever the need might be. Lord, you said whatsoever thing you desire when you pray, believe you receive it and you shall have it. Grant it, Lord. Minister to every need now as we worship you into my chambers. And we can say praise the Lord. Amen. We thank God for the word tonight. I believe that was for every one of us here uh married or single that um we certainly thank the Lord for the word. Amen. You know, it's uh it's really special the way the Lord does things. He it's just a mystery how he minister to what we have need of. We might think this or that, but he he uses the foolishness of preaching to give us what we have need of. Amen. And we just receive that. Amen. I receive that tonight.
