[53:08] 29 Matthew chapter 26 verse
[53:12] 17 now the first day of the Feast of UNL
[53:15] bread the disciples came to Jesus saying
[53:19] unto him where will thou th we prepare
[53:23] for thee to eat the
[53:25] Passover and he said go into the city to
[53:29] search a man and say unto him the master
[53:33] saith my time is at hand I will keep the
[53:38] Passover at thy
[53:40] house with my
[53:42] disciples and the disciples did as Jesus
[53:46] had appointed them and they made ready
[53:48] the
[53:49] pass now when the evening was come he
[53:52] sat down with the 12
[53:56] and as they did eat he said verily I say
[54:00] unto you that one of you shall betray
[54:04] me I hope it's not you
[54:06] tonight and they were exceedingly
[54:09] sorrowful and began every one of them to
[54:12] say unto him Lord is it I and he
[54:16] answered and said he that deeth his hand
[54:19] with me in the dish the same shall
[54:21] betray me the son of man goeth as it is
[54:25] written of him but woe unto that man by
[54:28] whom the son of man is betrayed it had
[54:31] been good for that man if had not been
[54:33] born then Judas which betrayed him
[54:37] answered and said Master is that is it I
[54:41] he said unto him thou Hast said and as
[54:45] they were eating Jesus Took bread and
[54:47] bless it and break it and gave it to the
[54:49] disciples and said take itat this is my
[54:53] body and he took the cup and gave the
[54:56] thanks and gave it to them saying drink
[55:00] ye all of it for this is my body for
[55:03] this is my blood of the new testament
[55:06] which is shed for many for the remission
[55:09] of sins but i s but I say unto you I
[55:12] will not drink henceforth of this fruit
[55:15] of the vine until that day when I drink
[55:18] it new with you in my father's Kingdom
[55:22] the Lord had is blessing to the reading
[55:23] of his word amen amen let us take our
[55:29] seat well with this uh scriptures
[55:33] brothers and sisters we want to speak on
[55:36] a short topic tonight Christ and his
[55:40] table
[55:43] companions well this inspiration came
[55:46] when uh I heard that there is going to
[55:48] be a communion
[55:50] service and I said
[55:52] oh if that Lord then what will will you
[55:55] help me present to your people something
[55:58] to encourage
[56:00] them something to make them know that
[56:03] Christianity is
[56:06] real Christianity is not a
[56:09] camouflage but it's something real yes
[56:13] that whether the world believe it or not
[56:15] that's
[56:16] right is going on Amen Hallelujah so the
[56:21] Lord laid upon my heart to for us to
[56:23] discuss this Jesus Christ with his
[56:26] stable
[56:28] companions now we know on that day he
[56:32] knew exactly what was going to
[56:35] happen and as it
[56:38] is the Bible says that he told his
[56:43] disciples to go and prepare a place
[56:47] where he was going to D for the last
[56:50] time in this flesh with his
[56:53] people and and they sat around the
[56:56] table amen they sat around the
[57:00] table and Jesus Christ begin to tell
[57:04] them things and the Bible said that they
[57:06] became so
[57:08] sorrowful oh
[57:10] Hallelujah why did they become so
[57:13] sorrowful because he said one of you
[57:15] will betray
[57:18] me and the disciples started asking
[57:21] Jesus question Lord is it I
[57:26] Peter asked Lord is it
[57:28] I Matthew asked Lord is it I but ask
[57:33] Lord is it I all of them asked Lord is
[57:36] it I until he came to Judas is scariot
[57:40] he said Lord is it I he said yeah thou H
[57:43] has said
[57:45] it so definitely there was somebody
[57:47] among them to betray Jesus
[57:50] Christ
[57:52] Hallelujah and Jesus is it what I love
[57:55] with this is the verse
[57:57] 28 he
[58:01] said he said for this is my blood of the
[58:05] new testament which is shed for many for
[58:08] the remission of sins but I say unto you
[58:11] verse 29 I will not drink henceforth of
[58:14] this fruit of the vine until that day
[58:17] when I drink it new with you in my
[58:19] father's
[58:21] Kingdom so it means there was going to
[58:26] be another step of this table that
[58:30] Christ was having with his people at the
[58:33] outper room right amen he said from now
[58:36] I'm not going to D with you again but
[58:39] till the
[58:40] kingdom Hallelujah so it means the
[58:44] disciples have to
[58:45] overcome the situation and the condition
[58:48] of their time to make sure that they
[58:51] register their position at the table of
[58:54] Jesus Christ rise in his
[58:56] kingdom so you see we can say definitely
[59:00] that this experience or this ordinance
[59:04] that we are going to take tonight it is
[59:06] for Overcomers amen hallelujah is it for
[59:10] Overcomers in fact if you overcome this
[59:13] world then you are able to die with the
[59:15] Lord Jesus Christ that's
[59:18] right until you deny the world yes until
[59:22] you condemn sin and you defeat The
[59:25] Temptations and trials Amen Hallelujah
[59:30] Jesus Christ knew exactly that what was
[59:33] going to happen but he just
[59:35] asked now to
[59:38] overcome is to means to conquer
[59:42] amen and like the prophet asked how can
[59:45] you conquer or how can you choke a
[59:47] victory when you have not
[59:48] fought that's true there must be a
[59:52] battle yes amen there must be a war that
[59:56] you will fight amen and conquer the
[59:59] enemy Hallelujah now one time I remember
[1:00:03] when
[1:00:05] uh
[1:00:08] Abraham on that day when there was
[1:00:11] strive between Abraham's servants and
[1:00:13] that of uh
[1:00:15] lot and Abraham said that oh my brother
[1:00:19] you are my nephew but I call you my
[1:00:21] brother it's not good for our servant to
[1:00:24] quarrel among themselves look at the
[1:00:26] land V very big Arizona is very
[1:00:30] big so just look
[1:00:34] around take a place and go and dwell
[1:00:37] there so that there will not be RI
[1:00:40] between me and you right and the Bible
[1:00:43] says
[1:00:44] that his nephew
[1:00:46] lot lift up his
[1:00:49] eyes and he looked towards
[1:00:53] Sodom
[1:00:55] he looked towards Sodom
[1:00:57] can because the place was green and he
[1:01:01] thought that it will benefit his
[1:01:06] cattle we know that usually when when
[1:01:11] things are going to be divided between
[1:01:14] uh the younger one and the elderly one
[1:01:17] the younger one supposed to tell the
[1:01:19] Elder take
[1:01:21] first but lot didn't do that that's
[1:01:23] right lot didn't say oh Uncle you are my
[1:01:27] father so why don't you make your choice
[1:01:29] first before I
[1:01:31] do but Abraham said you take it and you
[1:01:35] chose towards Sodom Abraham said no my
[1:01:38] son that place is
[1:01:40] dangerous the people over there are sin
[1:01:43] sinful they don't believe in the Lord
[1:01:45] right a whole lot of Dy character lord
[1:01:47] said that is where I
[1:01:49] want and Abraham said okay that is up to
[1:01:53] you you can go
[1:01:55] and possess the land and he went and
[1:01:58] possessed the land and that place was
[1:02:00] near
[1:02:01] Sodom and what happened it was not quiet
[1:02:05] long that's right when five nations
[1:02:08] gathered themselves together and attack
[1:02:10] Sodom they destroy Sodom they conquered
[1:02:13] Sodom and Lord and his family were taken
[1:02:18] captive
[1:02:20] Hallelujah and the Bible says
[1:02:22] that one of the people
[1:02:26] escaped and ran to Abraham and told him
[1:02:30] what has
[1:02:31] happened oh
[1:02:33] brother if perhaps it were to be me and
[1:02:37] you we will say oh don't mind that young
[1:02:41] boy that's good don't mind the young man
[1:02:44] I told him I warn him that that place is
[1:02:48] not good and he didn't respect me as his
[1:02:51] father and he went so let me leave him
[1:02:53] and do whatever ever whatever happened
[1:02:55] to him that's up to him if it were to be
[1:02:57] you and I perhaps that is what we have
[1:03:00] said but Abraham didn't do that that's
[1:03:03] right amen hallelujah because he had the
[1:03:06] spirit of God in him and the spirit of
[1:03:09] God is in you to fight the world yes the
[1:03:13] spirit of God is in you to fight
[1:03:15] unbelief amen the spirit of God is in
[1:03:18] you to project love towards one
[1:03:21] another Hallelujah and like the prophet
[1:03:23] said he said the only thing that is
[1:03:25] going to make us make this rupture is
[1:03:26] love and genuine love love for the word
[1:03:29] of God love for Jesus Christ and love
[1:03:32] for one
[1:03:33] another Abraham said well what will I do
[1:03:38] let me pursue and fight and rescue my my
[1:03:42] nephew yes and the Bible says
[1:03:45] that Abraham had only 318 men in his
[1:03:51] house they were not trained soldiers
[1:03:53] that's right right they have never
[1:03:55] fought any battle before but Abraham
[1:03:58] said we are going to war we are going to
[1:04:02] fight and bring my nephew Lord back amen
[1:04:06] and when they set off oh my god brother
[1:04:11] sister whenever you are taking a step
[1:04:13] take it in faith and God will be with
[1:04:16] you like the sisters were singing about
[1:04:19] the Lord Jesus Christ if you want Jesus
[1:04:22] to be around you wherever you are just
[1:04:25] mention the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:04:28] Christ will be with you amen hallelujah
[1:04:31] forget about talking about what is
[1:04:33] happening and and the politics and and
[1:04:35] you know talk about Jesus Christ when
[1:04:38] you talk about Jesus Christ Christ will
[1:04:40] appear around
[1:04:41] you so Abraham and his servants went and
[1:04:47] chased this five nations can you imagine
[1:04:51] 318 soldiers going to fight five
[1:04:56] nations
[1:04:59] H God is amazing
[1:05:01] God and he always fight our battles for
[1:05:04] us
[1:05:06] hallelujah what happened in the short is
[1:05:08] that Abraham was able to conquer the
[1:05:11] five nations with the 318
[1:05:14] men and he rescu
[1:05:17] lot Hallelujah and that was the time
[1:05:21] when he was coming back home he met a
[1:05:24] man on the way Hallelujah the man's name
[1:05:28] was
[1:05:29] madc the Bible says that he has no
[1:05:32] father he has known mother today
[1:05:34] theologians even don't know who that
[1:05:36] mcedc was that's right Seminary don't
[1:05:39] know what that mchis was but thank God
[1:05:42] for your life Hallelujah because you are
[1:05:45] living in the time of Jesus Christ you
[1:05:47] know who madc is madc is no less a being
[1:05:51] but the Lord God himself
[1:05:54] and the bible say that he came down and
[1:05:57] met Abraham on the way and gave Abraham
[1:06:01] communion he said Abraham yes what you
[1:06:03] have done you have shown a great love
[1:06:06] therefore you deserve to take communion
[1:06:09] from my hands that's good he said you an
[1:06:13] overcomer you have overcome your enemies
[1:06:16] you have overcome Temptation and you are
[1:06:19] portraying love towards your son
[1:06:22] therefore you are a winner take the
[1:06:25] communion and mad gave Abraham the
[1:06:29] communion my brother my sister in the
[1:06:33] life of Jesus
[1:06:35] Christ that question that he asked them
[1:06:39] it was a time of trial yes he said I
[1:06:43] know one of you is going to betray
[1:06:47] me and when he said that they themselves
[1:06:52] were so much troubled
[1:06:54] and they begin to find out Lord is it
[1:06:59] me is it me Peter that is going to
[1:07:02] betray You Phillip said Lord is it me
[1:07:06] Phillip that is going to betray you
[1:07:09] Thomas said the same
[1:07:11] thing almost all the
[1:07:15] disciples Jesus didn't say
[1:07:17] anything but when it came to the man
[1:07:21] called Judas is kariot
[1:07:25] Lord is it me Jesus said thou have said
[1:07:30] it
[1:07:32] Hallelujah he sat with Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ he was a
[1:07:38] companion he at with Jesus Christ he
[1:07:42] preached with Jesus Christ he commit he
[1:07:45] he performed Miracle with Jesus Christ
[1:07:48] but he betrayed Jesus Christ brother
[1:07:51] sister
[1:07:52] tonight we can ask the same question yes
[1:07:57] Lord who is going to betray you is it I
[1:08:01] Daniel is it I
[1:08:04] Israel is it I
[1:08:06] Nathaniel is it I is it I is it I we can
[1:08:12] all add the same question but thank God
[1:08:16] Amen that you and I we cannot betray
[1:08:20] Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ can you say Amen here we can
[1:08:24] never betray Jesus Christ because we are
[1:08:27] part of Jesus Christ and Christ is part
[1:08:30] of us in fact without us Christ cannot
[1:08:34] be complete that's right hallelujah oh
[1:08:37] one time we went to church and uh there
[1:08:40] was one
[1:08:42] sister who didn't come to church that
[1:08:45] day so we made an announcement that the
[1:08:49] following day we were going to have not
[1:08:51] the following service day we were going
[1:08:53] to have Service uh with another
[1:08:56] church and she was not around so she
[1:08:59] didn't hear this announcement so the
[1:09:01] Sunday she went to church and nobody was
[1:09:05] there
[1:09:08] H so the following Wednesday which was a
[1:09:11] evening service we went to church and lo
[1:09:14] and behold she came around and said
[1:09:16] pastor I came here and uh there was
[1:09:19] nobody there I said yes because you
[1:09:20] didn't come to service the other time we
[1:09:22] made an announcement that we're going to
[1:09:24] have Fellowship somewhere so I asked her
[1:09:28] were you afraid that the Rapture have
[1:09:30] taken
[1:09:32] place to my un surprise the sister said
[1:09:36] pastor I am not afraid because I know
[1:09:39] the Rapture cannot go without me I say
[1:09:43] sister God bless your heart she knew
[1:09:45] that she has overcome the world she knew
[1:09:49] that he have overcome sin she knew that
[1:09:51] he has a part in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:53] Christ so the rupture can never go
[1:09:56] without she being a Rapture and tonight
[1:09:59] brother sister I assure you that the
[1:10:02] rupture cannot take place without you
[1:10:05] you have also booked your position in
[1:10:06] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that is
[1:10:09] why if you are Jesus Christ tonight Lord
[1:10:12] is it I who is going to betray you the
[1:10:15] Lord will say no you cannot betray me if
[1:10:18] you are Jesus Christ Lord am I going to
[1:10:20] betray you the Lord will tell you no you
[1:10:22] can't betray me because he know that
[1:10:26] where we have reached there is one
[1:10:28] Accord between us and Jesus Christ Glory
[1:10:31] Hallelujah he said that day you know
[1:10:34] that I am in the father and you in me
[1:10:39] and I in you we are one with the Lord
[1:10:42] Jesus
[1:10:43] Christ and this
[1:10:45] experience that we are going to have
[1:10:48] tonight is
[1:10:50] signify the prophet said that it's an
[1:10:52] open communion and it is Overcomers that
[1:10:56] take it we have overcome this world we
[1:10:59] have fought a battle and we have won

[1:16:28] cities have turned to be
[1:16:32] women my who told Rahab
[1:16:37] this I mean who preached to
[1:16:42] Rahab it was by
[1:16:45] Revelation that this woman accepted the
[1:16:48] messengers of a day amen that's right
[1:16:52] Hallelujah yes and you know what
[1:16:55] happened when everything was
[1:16:59] done and this woman accepted the servant

[1:17:05] happened to her
[1:17:07] experience that was her
[1:17:11] repentance and a woman that some few
[1:17:15] minutes ago she was called a
[1:17:19] prostitute straight away request
[1:17:23] something durable from the men of God
[1:17:27] she said before you leave me I want you
[1:17:31] to give me a true
[1:17:33] token oh
[1:17:35] Hallelujah not just a token but a true
[1:17:42] talking not just the word of
[1:17:45] God but the true word of
[1:17:49] Goden oh
[1:17:52] Hallelujah and the brother said
[1:17:55] woman you have asked and we are giving
[1:17:59] it to you amen the

[1:18:10] hear that we are coming tie it on the ls
[1:18:14] of your window and that will be your
[1:18:17] token and make sure that you go and tell

[1:18:24] colleagues your perhaps your
[1:18:26] acquaintances your father and your

[1:18:41] amen and they told
[1:18:44] her if you don't do
[1:18:47] that don't blame us that's right and
[1:18:50] because Rahab believed
[1:18:54] rightly look the moment the man
[1:18:57] descended from her house she TI the
[1:19:00] token on the Lal amen amen because the
[1:19:04] token you cannot hide it it must be
[1:19:08] displayed listen any time God give a
[1:19:12] token to his people he give it in
[1:19:15] secrecy that's right he give the token
[1:19:17] to them in a secret but when they want
[1:19:20] to apply it they apply it openly amen oh
[1:19:23] Hallelujah so it was flying at the
[1:19:26] windows of Rahab it was going up and
[1:19:29] down it was going up and down it was
[1:19:31] going up and down and Rahab went out to
[1:19:35] his father's house and told the father

[1:28:02] 23 the Apostle Paul speaking of his
[1:28:06] receiving from the Lord these
[1:28:08] instructions going deeper into what our
[1:28:11] brother the scene that our brother read
[1:28:15] there the night of the crucifixion they
[1:28:18] broke bread there's many details that
[1:28:21] they the Lord never revealed to them but
[1:28:24] Paul received from the Lord and this is
[1:28:27] going to pick up what he received but I
[1:28:30] have received of the Lord that which
[1:28:33] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:28:36] Jesus the same night in which he was

[1:29:19] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[1:29:22] worly eateth and drinketh Damnation to
