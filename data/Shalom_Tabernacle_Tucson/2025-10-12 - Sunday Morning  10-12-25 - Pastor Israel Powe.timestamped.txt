[3:03] [Music]
[3:06] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?
[3:09] We'll open up in a word of prayer.
[3:13] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're honored and
[3:16] grateful to be here this morning, Lord,
[3:18] washed in thy precious blood. Lord,
[3:21] thank you for the grace that you
[3:22] bestowed upon us. Thank you, Lord, for
[3:25] the things that we can hear from your
[3:27] holy prophets. Lord, we're looking for a
[3:30] new heaven and a new earth where
[3:32] righteousness dwells. Father, as we hear
[3:36] some of that today, Lord, we pray that
[3:38] you just sink it deep within our hearts,
[3:42] Lord, and more of a reality than it's
[3:44] ever been before, Lord. Those that may
[3:46] be on the way, we pray you guide them in
[3:48] all safety, Lord. Thank you Lord for
[3:51] that faithful
[3:53] ones Lord that have come to offer the
[3:55] sacrifice of praise and we'll give you
[3:58] all the glory for it in the name of
[3:59] Jesus Christ we ask we're going to
[4:02] continue
[4:04] with the future home of the heavenly
[4:06] bridegroom and the earthly bride we'll
[4:08] start at paragraph 424 and end after 483
[4:12] be about 20 minutes
[4:15] amen
[4:17] [Applause]
[4:19] Believe.
[4:23] Only
[4:24] believe.
[4:28] All things are possible.
[4:33] Only
[4:35] believe.
[4:38] Only believe.
[4:43] Only
[4:44] believe.
[4:48] All things are possible.
[4:53] Only
[4:54] believe.
[4:57] You may be seated. Brother Brandon,
[5:01] &gt;&gt; that time just don't stop. No, we're in
[5:04] time. Wait a while. We'll go to
[5:05] eternity.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, holy mountain. There will be streets
[5:10] of transparent gold, avenues, and houses
[5:13] and parks. If you want to read this,
[5:15] Revelation 21:18, the tree of life will
[5:18] be there. 12 different manners of fruit,
[5:20] one each month will be born on it. The
[5:22] people who eat these fruits, you'll
[5:23] change your diet every every month. And
[5:26] it's it's from
[5:29] for only the overcomers.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know that
[5:34] &gt;&gt; it isn't for the denominations?
[5:37] &gt;&gt; You say you mean that, brother? Let's
[5:38] turn to Revelations 2 just a minute.
[5:40] Fine.
[5:44] Revelations 2 and 7. Let's find out now
[5:47] where it's really the truth or not.
[5:49] Revelations 2 and 7 reads like this. And
[5:52] he that has an ear, let him hear what
[5:54] the spirit, now remember he's not
[5:55] talking to the Jews. Now,
[5:58] this is the church, the gentile. He that
[6:01] has an ear, let him hear what the spirit
[6:03] says to the churches. To him that
[6:04] overcomemeth, I will give to eat of the
[6:07] tree of life, which is in the midst of
[6:10] the paradise of God. Amen.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Overcomers only that overcome the beast.
[6:17] Overcome his mark.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; That's Catholicism, Protestantism,
[6:21] denominationalism.
[6:23] Who overcome the beast, his mark, the
[6:24] letter of his name, you'll have a right
[6:27] to the tree of life to enter into the
[6:28] gates where nothing that defiles can
[6:30] ever go in. See, think of it just a
[6:34] minute now as we go just a little bit
[6:35] farther. Tree of life will be for the
[6:37] overcomers only. The leaves will be for
[6:40] the healing of the nations. That is the
[6:42] kings that live in there bringing their
[6:43] honor in. When they bring their honor in
[6:45] and lay it before the throne of God,
[6:48] just like the outside the 10 11 tribes
[6:52] brought in every one of them a tenth to
[6:54] Levi.
[6:55] Hey, when they bring their honor into
[6:58] the from the blessed land in that,
[6:59] they'll reach from the tree of life,
[7:02] break off a holly leap or tree of life
[7:04] leap and they'll walk out together.
[7:07] There's no more war.
[7:08] Everything's at peace.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; The leaves are memorial for the healings
[7:14] of the nation.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; The same tree, not like Adam, there was
[7:17] a tree of life in the garden of Eden
[7:18] that he might have eaten from if he
[7:20] hadn't fell. That tree of life reminded
[7:23] him all the time that his knew his youth
[7:25] was continually going on. See, same with
[7:28] the nations. These will be for the
[7:30] healing of the nations. Notice not the
[7:33] sickness. Now, you'd have the same
[7:34] rights to have like the dove with the
[7:37] holly leaf. is all each king taking a
[7:39] leap. Notice the river of life. Perhaps
[7:42] many little streams making it up. Now in
[7:47] this earth, I'm going to close just in a
[7:50] few minutes. In this earth, I'm just
[7:52] going to stop. That's how much more
[7:54] notes he's got. About 30 pages.
[7:58] In this in this life, I have never seen
[8:02] nothing so quenching as to be in the
[8:05] mountains and find as I preached on the
[8:08] other night that stream bubbling up.
[8:10] It's lifegiving resource. You'd be tired
[8:12] and thirsty. Fall down by a good stream.
[8:15] Way down where germs can't go. Way down
[8:19] hundreds of feet in the earth is
[8:21] bubbling forth pure genuine lifegiving
[8:24] water.
[8:25] We appreciate that. That's little. Now,
[8:28] the earth has its many streams with
[8:30] refreshing water. When you're thirsting
[8:32] and dying, you get a good cold drink
[8:34] from that, it'll it'll help you to live.
[8:37] But look where this one comes from.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; From the throne.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; There's where it gets its lifegiving
[8:50] resources.
[8:52] comes from under the throne of God where
[8:55] God sits. All of it, all of this earth,
[9:00] this earth here we live in now,
[9:02] everyone, whether it be Christian or
[9:03] pagan, has temples.
[9:06] Did you ever think of that? Churches.
[9:08] All of them. But this one doesn't have
[9:12] any. The Bible said, "And there was no
[9:14] temple there,
[9:16] but the Lord God and the Lamb is the
[9:20] temple of it." Amen.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; The lamb is a light. The lamb is a
[9:23] temple. The lamb is a throne. The lamb
[9:26] is alive.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; He is that temple.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; See, all these temples have an object
[9:33] they're worshiping. But in this city, he
[9:36] is the object.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; He's with his people.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; His spirit light floods the pyramid city
[9:45] like Peter and John up on top of the
[9:47] mountain. The light covered the top of
[9:50] the mountain and a voice spoke said,
[9:52] "This is my beloved son." In Revelations
[9:54] 21:3 and 4, the tabernacle of God
[9:59] is with man.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; God has tabernacled in man
[10:04] &gt;&gt; by redeeming him by these three
[10:06] processes. Now God is going to redeem
[10:09] the earth and tabernacle in the earth
[10:12] with his subjects of the earth
[10:14] &gt;&gt; which he brought forth from the earth
[10:16] and through sin it fell. But the he had
[10:20] to let it go on but now he sent Jesus to
[10:22] redeem that fallen earth which we are
[10:25] part of.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; Though not one hair your head will
[10:28] perish.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus said so. He said I'll raise it up
[10:33] again at the last day.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; See why? You're part of the earth know I
[10:38] had the little joke about my wife
[10:39] telling me I lost my hair. I told her I
[10:41] hadn't lost one of them. See where they
[10:43] at? I said well that's where I got them.
[10:45] Everywhere they was a substance.
[10:47] Wherever they are they're waiting for
[10:48] me.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; I'll go to them one day. This old body
[10:52] wrinkling and falling dwindling over his
[10:54] shoulders and aching and knees and and
[10:57] horse in the throat. That's all right.
[10:59] You're going to be in the sea but the
[11:01] trumpet will wake me when she Yes, sir.
[11:04] We're going to change one of these days.
[11:06] I'm part of this world that's redeemed.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; You're in the world, but nothing of the
[11:12] cosmos.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; You're in a different order, a redeemed
[11:16] order. Notice
[11:18] the tabernacle of God will be with man.
[11:21] Notice the former things has passed
[11:24] away. This this thing has passed away.
[11:27] This means that heaven has come down to
[11:31] resident with man.
[11:34] Heaven and earth are embraced just
[11:37] exactly when the dove came upon part of
[11:39] the earth which was Jesus. He was the
[11:41] dust of the earth.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Man, God coming from that one little
[11:45] life germ by creative power. And that
[11:48] blood that was in that the life that was
[11:50] in that blood extended back to God. But
[11:52] the blood dripped up on the earth to
[11:54] claim it
[11:55] &gt;&gt; because of the blood that was brought
[11:57] through from the germ cell from Cain.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now he comes back with a creative
[12:02] power just like he did Adam creating
[12:05] Adam. Here's the second Adam.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; And through that breaking cell there
[12:09] where sin Cain broke that blood cell
[12:11] upon the just. See now this blood cell
[12:14] because he killed Abel. But Abel was
[12:17] born sex.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; But this wasn't born sex. It was a
[12:21] creation of God. the beginning of it
[12:24] &gt;&gt; and it redeemed the earth and all of the
[12:27] calcium pish petroleum cosmic light that
[12:30] you're made out of is redeemed.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Not one hair shall be harmed.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; I'll raise it up again at the last day.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Then what? God comes down to resident
[12:42] upon the earth which he is a part of it.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; His own body.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; He raised it up for our justification.
[12:50] But we're justified believing that
[12:53] accepting that. Notice in types Jesus
[12:57] becomes
[12:58] uh in the type Jesus
[13:02] becomes man God are predestinated to
[13:05] take his place to redeem us to make all
[13:08] these things possible. Notice outside of
[13:12] its beautiful walls of this city. Now
[13:15] have you got the city? Amen.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; See, it's a holy mountain. Nothing shall
[13:21] hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain,
[13:25] sayeth the Lord.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; The city is not a cube. It is a
[13:30] mountain.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; And the the width by the breadth by the
[13:37] height or equal.
[13:40] See,
[13:42] &gt;&gt; 1500 miles this way, 1500 miles that
[13:45] way, 1500 miles all the way around, and
[13:47] 1500 miles high.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; So, it's just a great mountain like the
[13:52] pyramid, and the city is on the
[13:54] mountain.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; There's the paradises of God.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; The light of the world.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. That perfect kingdom,
[14:08] not the seventh day, the eternal one.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; See, not the millennium, the new earth.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; See,
[14:18] &gt;&gt; while it's going through the millennium,
[14:19] it's going through its sanctifying
[14:21] process,
[14:22] which still must be burned.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Which the blood redeemed the people as
[14:27] shows memorial the price is paid that
[14:30] thousand years. But then it has to be
[14:32] cleansed by fire just like you were as
[14:34] delegates of this city, the delegation.
[14:37] So if you die
[14:39] or if you live, what difference does it
[14:41] make?
[14:43] &gt;&gt; If it comes today or it comes 100 years
[14:45] or a thousand years,
[14:47] &gt;&gt; I'll only rest though my change.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; So old man, old woman, don't you be
[14:54] discouraged.
[14:56] If you are representation of here in
[14:58] this attribute of God, this God, if you
[15:01] have if you're representing the earth,
[15:02] you can not you're in the eternal. And
[15:05] if you've crossed from that seventh day
[15:07] into the eighth and got into the eternal
[15:09] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[15:11] you're included in this. Now, if you're
[15:13] just trusting upon a sensation or jump
[15:15] up down or I do this, I keep a seventh
[15:17] day, I don't eat and eat and things like
[15:18] that, that's going to perish in
[15:22] &gt;&gt; But this is the eternal.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; This is the eternal. Right.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; The feast after the feast of
[15:27] tabernacles. See, the feast of
[15:30] tabernacles was the last feast,
[15:32] the seventh feast. We're worshiping now
[15:35] under the feast of the tabernacles, the
[15:38] seventh church age.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; In the millennium, we'll be under the
[15:41] feast of tabernacles again in the
[15:42] seventh day. But then after the seventh
[15:45] day, we have a holy convocation.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Go back into the eternal. How?
[15:53] by the eternal one
[15:55] &gt;&gt; that came and redeemed us and taken us
[15:57] back.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Let us recognize that we were a part of
[16:00] this.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Now, how do you know you're a part?
[16:04] Because that the word of the hour,
[16:08] &gt;&gt; the promise of the day. What is it? A
[16:11] restoration back to the first day. The
[16:14] first and he shall restore the hearts of
[16:17] the children back to the father.
[16:21] bringing a restoration again of the
[16:23] Pentecostal genuine not sensations
[16:27] &gt;&gt; and will manifest the evening light. The
[16:29] same sun that showed in the morning
[16:30] &gt;&gt; light
[16:32] &gt;&gt; as promised for the day.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Where are we friends?
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Where are we? Just waiting now to get
[16:40] out of the way so Revelations 11 can be
[16:43] made to known to the Jews.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. The rapture coming. Watch.
[16:49] Outside the gates of the walls, spread
[16:51] across the new earth. Nations will dwell
[16:54] in eternal peace.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Honored kings will bring their glory
[17:01] into it. No sin can be there.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; No more bob-haired women will enter that
[17:07] city.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; I'll guarantee you that.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; No more short wearing cigarette smoking.
[17:14] Amen.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Whoreongers, or liars,
[17:17] idolattors, whatever they was, won't
[17:19] enter that city.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; No, it'll all be over.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Sin will be gone. Nothing to defile its
[17:26] holiness shall enter there.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. All has passed away
[17:31] forever.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Look,
[17:35] &gt;&gt; out in its fields
[17:37] and around its gates,
[17:39] &gt;&gt; yes,
[17:40] &gt;&gt; the bear will be gentle.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; The wolf will be tamed. And the lion
[17:45] shall lay down with the lamb.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; And the beast from the wild will be led
[17:50] by a child.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; I'll be changed for the creature that I
[17:54] am with this death worked in my mortal
[17:56] body. Old age sitting. I'll be changed.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; You've heard the song.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; The bear will be gentle.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; The wolf will be tamed.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; He'll not jump up and rare up and try to
[18:09] kill you.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; He'll walk with you down the path.
[18:15] Thank you, Lord.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Who's going to inherit it?
[18:19] &gt;&gt; The redeemed.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Who would it be? Notice,
[18:26] I can only teach my types now.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Notice, brother Lee,
[18:30] who come out on the new earth with Noah
[18:33] the prophet. Those who went in with him
[18:36] in the ark.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[18:39] &gt;&gt; That's who walks out on it.
[18:42] Those who went in with Noah by his
[18:45] message was the one who walked out upon
[18:48] the new earth after his water baptism.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; The one who goes in with Jesus. Now, how
[18:55] do you get into him? By one spirit.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; And he is the word. You become part of
[19:00] him. What part of him are you? The word
[19:02] living of this hour recognizing
[19:05] &gt;&gt; you walk out with him in the millennium.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; That's when you walk out.
[19:12] Notice
[19:13] not a new generation,
[19:16] a transplanting.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Brandon,
[19:24] &gt;&gt; notice if God could raise up Elijah
[19:29] and take him up 2500 years ago to
[19:32] transplant him back into the earth again
[19:34] to be a prophet for the Jews, how much
[19:37] more can he do the bride?" Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; After Noah came out of the ark, notice
[19:45] what was said to Noah after he come out
[19:47] of the flood just like it was with Adam
[19:50] before after come out of the new earth.
[19:53] Said multiply and replenish the earth
[19:55] after the flood. Notice was to be
[19:58] fruitful. Replenish the earth as Adam at
[20:01] the first. Now you can see exactly here.
[20:05] Now listen real close.
[20:08] Adam was to multiply and replenish the
[20:10] earth. That right?
[20:13] &gt;&gt; Noah was after the new world destroy it
[20:15] was to multiply and replenish the earth.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Get it?
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Now can't you see what the serpent seed
[20:23] is?
[20:25] What? Replenish the earth.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[20:33] You see how Satan got to Eve now?
[20:35] That's why death has reigned on earth
[20:38] ever since.
[20:40] And heaven's, earth, beast, atmosphere
[20:44] is all cursed of God because of it.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; That's the curse because Satan got to
[20:50] this first. Jesus came to redeem it back
[20:54] to the father.
[20:57] In order to do this, he became part of
[21:00] it as I've just went through. And from
[21:03] that very dust, the part Jesus was
[21:05] himself being redeemed. Through him, all
[21:09] of the attributes of God are redeemed
[21:11] with the earth.
[21:14] He was a spoken word.
[21:17] We who are redeemed is part of him. Then
[21:20] if you can recognize,
[21:23] see the Pharisees claimed they were, but
[21:26] you see my first illustration, there was
[21:28] only that by intellectual. They couldn't
[21:30] recognize the word when it was made
[21:32] manifest right before them. They said,
[21:34] "This man's an evil spirit."
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Now today, we're called false prophets.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; We're called every dirty thing could be
[21:40] called
[21:40] &gt;&gt; by religious people. See,
[21:43] &gt;&gt; by great Italian man.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; See, they just don't understand.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; See,
[21:52] it's water baptism wasn't sufficient to
[21:54] cleanse it. Neither is theirs.
[21:56] Sanctification of the blood brought it
[21:58] back. claimed it, but the baptism of the
[22:01] far cleansed it like it did his bride.
[22:04] Like justification, sanctification,
[22:06] baptism, the Holy Ghost never promised
[22:08] to raise up a new race as I've said, but
[22:10] he promised to redeem the fallen. Then
[22:12] that was the the predestinated inherit
[22:16] it as he has promised. And he is the
[22:19] unchangeable God. We know that. Remember
[22:22] God took Elijah after the rapture and
[22:24] translated transplant him back among the
[22:26] people to take the place as a prophet
[22:28] among his people pretty soon. He will do
[22:30] that and has kept him alive these 2500
[22:34] years.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; He's to appear again.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Notice again he raised up Moses from the
[22:41] dead.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Where's his grave? Can anybody find him?
[22:45] Read the book of Jude.
[22:48] See Satan, the archangel disputing with
[22:51] the archangel Satan and said, "Thus the
[22:54] Lord rebuke you, disputing over the body
[22:56] of Moses." And here Peter, James, and
[22:58] John stand there looking at him have
[22:59] transfiguration
[23:01] &gt;&gt; right there in the land where the
[23:02] mountains to be raised up to dwell in
[23:04] seeing he come to redeem it. See, there
[23:06] was the rapture church stand
[23:08] represented. There was the lamb that are
[23:10] asleep represented.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Whereabouts?
[23:14] In the city.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Up on top of the mountain.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was Peter, James, and John
[23:19] looking on three, a witness. There was
[23:23] Elijah, Moses, and Jesus.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; That's a heavenly witness. See, and then
[23:29] there was Moses, the dead have been
[23:31] raised up. There was Elijah, the
[23:34] rapture, was still alive.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; And it was both represented on this holy
[23:38] mountain.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; And Jesus, the redeemer, when God up
[23:41] above him like this overshadow him,
[23:43] said, "This is my beloved son."
[23:45] You remember Jesus said about a day
[23:48] before that he said, "Verily I say unto
[23:51] you that some who are standing here now
[23:53] will not see death until they see the
[23:55] kingdom of God established in hell."
[24:00] &gt;&gt; What was it? The resurrected dead and
[24:03] the raptured saints together caught up
[24:06] together to meet him in the air with God
[24:08] overshadowing and Jesus standing there
[24:09] in the shadow saying, "This is my
[24:11] beloved son in whom I'm well to please.
[24:13] the order of the new kingdom.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister,
[24:19] &gt;&gt; death doesn't change you.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Death only changes your dwelling place.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; See, remember Samuel when he was dead
[24:28] and been buried for two years. He was in
[24:31] paradise. And the witch of Endor called
[24:33] him up and Saul recognized him as she
[24:36] did too and fell upon her face. He
[24:38] hadn't changed one bit. Amen.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; He was still the same Samuel after being
[24:43] dead two years. And he was still a
[24:45] prophet.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Tomorrow you'll fall in battle
[24:49] and your son with you, but this time
[24:50] tomorrow night you'll be with me." And
[24:52] that's just what happened.

[36:35] day.
[36:39] Amen. We've got a little problem with
[36:42] the microphones. Going to switch them up
[36:43] so they match. So you guys aren't
[36:44] completely confused this morning.
[36:47] Brother Ezekiel, would you come and open
[36:50] our service with a word of prayer?
[36:53] [Music]

[37:23] house
[37:25] and uh so we pray for the service that
[37:27] night and we had a wonderful service.
[37:32] It was just a refreshing of my soul and
[37:35] and uh everything we were talking our

[37:41] church. It was like somebody told

[40:00] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe you could just greet
[40:06] somebody around you before we're seated
[40:07] this morning.
[40:14] Good question.
[40:17] [Music]
[40:21] As brother Ezekiel said, what
[40:22] expectation do we have when we get
[40:24] together? And this next song is what my
[40:28] expectation is is we're together again.
[40:30] Something good is going to happen.
[40:32] Something good is in store. So, we know
[40:35] that he's here. We've invited him. We've
[40:37] made him welcome.
[40:39] Well, we're together again
[40:43] just praising the Lord.

[41:56] ring.

[42:38] And I'm standing on the promises that
[42:42] cannot fail.

[42:48] fear assail,
[42:51] by the living word of God, I shall
[42:55] prevail. For I'm standing on the
[42:59] promises of God.

[45:11] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[45:19] Amen.
[45:21] Amen. Brother Green always used to say,
[45:24] "I'd rather believe what the word of God
[45:26] says about me than when I know to be
[45:28] true about myself." That's standing on
[45:31] the promises of God this morning. That's
[45:32] where I want to be found guilty of doing
[45:35] that. that Lord, I just trusted you.
[45:36] Your word said it and you are your word.
[45:39] We can trust that. We can count on it.
[45:42] There's no shadow of turning with him.
[45:44] If he's done it in the past, he'll do it
[45:46] again today. Amen. I'm standing on the
[45:49] promises of God. Amen. I'm glad to be
[45:51] here today. We have a couple song
[45:53] special. Sister Lulu, if you could

[46:05] store for us today. We're not going to
[46:07] be picky eaters, but we're going to say,
[46:08] "Lord, I I know you know just what I
[46:10] have need of, and you know better than
[46:11] what I do." So, well, Jesus has a
[46:14] tablespread where the saints of God

[46:22] come and die.

[53:42] not owe. Brothers, come up for the
[53:44] prayer requests.
[53:46] He paid a debt. He did not. Oh, I owed a
[53:53] debt. I could not pay. I needed someone
[54:00] to wash my sins away.
[54:05] [Music]
[54:06] And now I sing a brand new song. It's
[54:11] amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[54:17] paid a debt that I could never. He paid
[54:22] a debt at Calvary.
[54:25] He paid a debt at Calvary.
[54:30] He cleansed my soul. He set me free. I'm
[54:35] glad that Jesus
[54:38] did all my sins erased.
[54:43] [Music]
[54:44] I now can sing a brand new song. It's
[54:50] amazing
[54:51] grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[54:57] paid a debt that I could never. And one
[55:01] day he's coming back for me.
[55:04] One day he's coming back for me. I'll
[55:09] live with him eternally.
[55:14] Won't it be glory
[55:17] just to see him on that day?
[55:23] I then will sing a brand new song.
[55:29] Amazing grace. All day long, Christ
[55:34] Jesus
[55:35] paid a debt that I could never pay.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Hey, this morning.
[55:48] So glad he paid for my debts this
[55:50] morning, church. The ones that I've
[55:52] done, the ones I'll do today, the ones
[55:54] I'll do tomorrow. That
[55:56] &gt;&gt; all powerful blood. I'm so thankful for
[55:58] it. So thankful to be with each one of
[56:00] you this morning. and worshiping our
[56:02] savior and to be in his presence. We had
[56:04] a good crowd of children in Sunday
[56:07] school, 11 kids, 10 Bibles, and three do
[56:10] uh $3 for the offering this morning. We
[56:12] have some new congregants, I think,
[56:14] today. Certainly of David, and maybe we
[56:16] have Joseph. I'm not sure. Do we have
[56:18] baby Joseph here, too? So, that's pretty
[56:20] cool. Very thankful for healthy babies
[56:22] and mamas today. Thankful for the rain
[56:25] in this part, the desert, too. So, just
[56:28] praise the Lord for that. We will be
[56:29] having a workday this coming Saturday,
[56:31] the 18th. I don't know all the details,
[56:34] but I know we need all the help we can
[56:35] get. So, we've got some upcoming
[56:37] meetings. We'll be in prayer for those
[56:38] when we just want to take care of the
[56:40] people and be as accommodating and as we
[56:43] can. The Lord's given us a good place to
[56:45] take care of. So, please help us do that
[56:47] if you can on Saturday.
[56:50] For our prayer request, our precious
[56:52] brother John Martin was in an accident
[56:55] in up in Utah. He's had surgery on his
[56:58] arm yesterday. Sister Rea was telling me
[57:00] we want to hold him up in prayer. That
[57:02] went well, but he's in surgery as we
[57:04] speak for his pelvis and on his hip. May
[57:06] the Lord just help him through that.
[57:08] Guide the doctor's hands and give him a
[57:10] quick recovery. Our precious sister Lisa
[57:12] is in route to Utah and the storms and
[57:15] things are um in her way. So, let's pray
[57:19] the Lord will guide her on the way up to
[57:21] Utah. Sister Lisa, the family.

[57:37] Timothy and Lydia are headed up there.
[57:39] Just want to have a experience with the
[57:41] Lord and be born have that born again
[57:43] experience they need. Want to continue
[57:46] to uphold our precious brother Bobby
[57:48] Worth in prayer his trial sister
[57:50] Jennifer and the family. I know you're
[57:51] doing that. Our precious sister Lorie
[57:53] Snow, Brother Randy, she's wanting to be
[57:56] here for the meetings. We want her to be
[57:57] here for the meetings and just the
[57:59] perfect mind and the will of God in all
[58:01] things. If you've got a desire in your
[58:03] heart, let us go before the prayer
[58:05] answering God this morning as we lift
[58:07] those things to heaven. Dear God, we're
[58:10] so thankful to be in church this
[58:11] morning. many places we could be. But
[58:13] just to be in your presence, Lord, is so
[58:16] important. So blessed people we are to
[58:19] to be able to do that this morning,
[58:21] Lord. This late hour, the son of man
[58:23] revealing the Leodysian church age, God,
[58:26] the tremendous times that we live. We're
[58:28] thankful, Lord. We're grateful,
[58:29] children. We want to be in line with the
[58:31] word. We look in the mirror. Don't
[58:34] always like what we see, Lord. But we
[58:35] pray that you'd work on us again today.
[58:37] This word, Lord. We humble ourselves
[58:40] before you, before the word, nor in
[58:42] we're handling the word of God, the mind
[58:43] of God, Lord Jesus. And we can't
[58:46] comprehend it or understand it, but
[58:48] would you help our understanding a
[58:49] little further along the road this
[58:51] morning through our precious brother
[58:53] Israel? Lord, we want to be humble,
[58:54] reverent, and in action. Lord, as we've
[58:56] been taught, just help us, Lord, as your
[58:59] people very feeble at times, but we call
[59:02] on the strength of Almighty God for our
[59:04] precious brother John Martin, Lord. and
[59:08] not a young man anymore and having the
[59:10] surgeries, Lord. But we know you'll
[59:12] guide the doctors and make things right
[59:14] and help him in his life through this
[59:16] test, Lord. This trial for sister Lisa
[59:18] in route that you bring her safely to
[59:20] him together to just work through things
[59:24] together, Lord God. Brother John Allen
[59:26] there as well. Bless them, Lord, the
[59:28] camp for my children, for all children,
[59:30] for the leadership there, Brother Jason
[59:33] and Saints.
[59:36] We love our brother Bobby so much. Oh
[59:38] God, he's done much for your people and
[59:41] we know that you're the healer and just
[59:44] call upon the name of the Lord Jesus to
[59:46] comfort him, to bring them through this
[59:47] trial. Sister Jennifer, Lord, his family
[59:50] as they bring put their faith in you.
[59:52] May they have no doubt, Lord, in the
[59:54] word of God that is stands the test of
[59:56] time, Lord, standing on these promises.
[59:59] So thankful to these people that have
[1:00:00] been a part of our lives and we were
[1:00:02] able to fellowship and be with them. And
[1:00:04] so we're just praying for the Lord's
[1:00:05] perfect will and those and all things
[1:00:07] for our precious sister Lori that you've
[1:00:09] raised from the dead. Lord, you've
[1:00:10] called her into worship with us and
[1:00:13] she's into rehab and wanting strength
[1:00:15] for her legs, Lord, to walk again. And
[1:00:16] we we know you've done so much already
[1:00:19] and we're believing for a full recovery
[1:00:21] and help for her helpmate Lord Brother
[1:00:24] Randy and them that they'll just grow
[1:00:27] together, grow stronger in the Lord and
[1:00:29] the word and their physical healing that
[1:00:31] they need, Lord. And we've raised our
[1:00:32] hands to heaven in faith believing a
[1:00:34] perfect word, a perfect God, Lord,
[1:00:36] praying for all things to be in the
[1:00:40] perfect will. Lord, give us strength,
[1:00:41] the courage, Lord. And today as we hear
[1:00:44] the word of God, help us to have an open
[1:00:46] ear to hear that we know we will hear
[1:00:48] from you. Now, can we go home a better
[1:00:50] person? Lord, it's up to us to receive
[1:00:52] it. So, we bring our tithes and
[1:00:54] offerings, Lord, knowing you own all
[1:00:55] things, you have all things, but as
[1:00:56] cheerful givers trying to support the
[1:00:58] kingdom all in all ways that we can. We
[1:01:01] thank you for it. Thank you for this
[1:01:02] time in the wonderful name of our Lord
[1:01:04] and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, all
[1:01:06] God's people say, "Amen."
[1:01:11] Sister Heather and Sister Abigail also
[1:01:14] have a special prepared this morning.
[1:01:15] So, we could just sing a chorus as they
[1:01:17] come up. This goes along with what
[1:01:19] Sister Lulu just sang. And where else
[1:01:23] could we go? I've decided to follow
[1:01:24] Jesus. There's no turning back. I have
[1:01:27] decided
[1:01:29] to follow Jesus.
[1:01:32] I have decided
[1:01:35] to follow Jesus.
[1:01:39] I have decided
[1:01:42] to follow Jesus.
[1:01:45] I won't turn back.
[1:01:48] I won't turn back. The cross before me
[1:01:54] and the world behind me. The cross
[1:01:58] before me. The world behind me, the
[1:02:04] cross before me and the world behind me,
[1:02:10] I won't turn back.
[1:02:13] I won't turn. You can take this whole
[1:02:15] world. You can take this whole world.
[1:02:19] But give me Jesus.
[1:02:23] Take this whole world. But give me
[1:02:26] Jesus.
[1:02:28] You can take this whole world, but give
[1:02:32] me Jesus.
[1:02:35] I won't turn back.
[1:02:38] I won't turn back.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; I just if I if it's okay, I have a two
[1:02:51] minutes for a testimony. Okay. I guess
[1:02:54] you all know I just went through a
[1:02:55] really difficult trial with unexpectedly
[1:02:58] losing my job. I had a seven years at
[1:03:01] this place. Never had a single mark
[1:03:02] against me. Um, you know, no writeups,
[1:03:05] no disciplinary action. Boss acted like
[1:03:07] a friend, shared lunches, you know,
[1:03:09] bought each other chocolate and all of a
[1:03:11] sudden she got something against me and
[1:03:13] said, "Today's your last day." Said,
[1:03:15] "Okay." So off I went. So that um but I
[1:03:18] knew the Lord was doing something. So I
[1:03:21] um you know went home, decompressed a
[1:03:24] few days, thought, "Well, what do I do
[1:03:25] now?" And talked to a lot of you and
[1:03:27] everybody was encouraging. The Lord's
[1:03:29] got something better for you, Heather.
[1:03:30] Every single one of you. Every one of
[1:03:32] you said, "He's got something better for
[1:03:33] you, Heather. And we're praying for
[1:03:34] you." It was really encouraging to have
[1:03:37] all that support from every one of you.
[1:03:39] I really appreciate it. And um Sister
[1:03:41] Brandy says, "Go update your LinkedIn
[1:03:43] account. George just got a really good
[1:03:45] job doing that." So I was like, "Okay,
[1:03:47] I'll I'll do that." So I did. I updated
[1:03:49] it, wrote a bio and, you know, rewrote
[1:03:52] my resume, started applying for every
[1:03:54] job I could find, signed up for every
[1:03:56] platform I could find that would send me
[1:03:58] emails for jobs, wrote so many
[1:04:00] iterations of my resume, I got got tired
[1:04:03] of it, but and um finally after about,
[1:04:06] you know, 7 weeks, I um I had had just
[1:04:08] one interview, had another one coming
[1:04:10] up, and like all the pressure of it just
[1:04:12] kind of came down on me. I just felt
[1:04:13] like, Lord, I can't take another
[1:04:15] rejection. I've had so many say, "We're
[1:04:17] not moving forward with your resume."
[1:04:18] Interviews that didn't turn into
[1:04:20] anything. And I just thought, I got to
[1:04:22] get away. I'd spent the whole day, Labor
[1:04:24] Day, um, studying this company that I
[1:04:27] was going to have this second interview
[1:04:28] with and studying the people on LinkedIn
[1:04:30] that were going to interview me and try
[1:04:32] to find something intelligent that I
[1:04:33] could say, you know, and and just the
[1:04:35] pressure was a lot. So, I thought, I'm
[1:04:37] just going to get away. I'm going to go
[1:04:38] look at the mountains. So, I drove north
[1:04:40] toward the Catalinas and just kind of,
[1:04:43] you know, cried it all out. Let it all
[1:04:44] let it all come out. I was like, "Lord,
[1:04:46] I I can't handle this pressure. I don't
[1:04:48] know what to do if this doesn't work
[1:04:49] out. I've applied for every job I can
[1:04:50] find and I just need your help." And um
[1:04:54] started to get dark. So, I thought,
[1:04:55] "Well, I'll go back home, make myself
[1:04:57] some dinner, and I'll turn on the voice
[1:04:59] radio while I'm making my dinner." And I
[1:05:02] turned it on and Brother Brandham was
[1:05:04] preaching the uncertain sound. And he
[1:05:06] was talking about how uncertain
[1:05:07] everything in life is. Was going down
[1:05:08] the list, home life, and he goes and
[1:05:11] right away he says, "And take our jobs
[1:05:12] for instance." He said, "There's no
[1:05:13] security in jobs." He said, "Somebody
[1:05:15] could get something against you. You
[1:05:16] lose your job, you're gone." And I was
[1:05:17] like, "Well, that's just what happened,
[1:05:19] you know." And he went on talking about
[1:05:21] it for about 90 seconds about how
[1:05:23] uncertain the jobs were. And I just felt
[1:05:26] all of that builtup pressure just just
[1:05:29] completely relieve. And I realized my
[1:05:33] hope is not in the job. My hope is in
[1:05:35] Jesus Christ. And I have got him and all
[1:05:37] is well. And I did have the interview
[1:05:39] the next day. It did turn into an offer.
[1:05:41] I've been there almost a month and it's
[1:05:44] phenomenal. I I love it. It's It's just
[1:05:46] way better than what I had before. So,
[1:05:47] he did have something better for me. I
[1:05:50] believe he honored all of your words and
[1:05:52] I want to thank you
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:08] I've had a dollar to my name and I've
[1:06:12] had friends who walked away
[1:06:16] and I've even lost myself a time or two.
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:23] There were bridges crossed and burned.
[1:06:26] But through all the wreckage I have
[1:06:29] learned,
[1:06:31] there's one thing that I can never lose.
[1:06:38] If I got Jesus,
[1:06:42] I've got all that I could ever need.
[1:06:47] Take the world away from me and I'll be
[1:06:52] okay if I got Jesus.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; There's a hope that's living deep
[1:07:01] inside. A joy that I can never hide. A
[1:07:07] safe place to fall. If I got Jesus,
[1:07:13] I got it all.
[1:07:23] I've seen weakness turn to strength and
[1:07:27] I've seen failures met with grace.
[1:07:31] And it's not from what I have done. It's
[1:07:35] Christ in me.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; A miracle I can't explain.
[1:07:42] Oh, he's given me his name. I'm the
[1:07:47] richest now that I could ever be.
[1:07:53] If I got Jesus,
[1:07:57] I've got all that I could ever need.
[1:08:02] Take the world away from me and I'll be
[1:08:07] okay. If I got Jesus,
[1:08:13] there's a hope that's living deep
[1:08:16] inside. A joy that I can never hide. A
[1:08:21] safe place to fall. If I got Jesus,
[1:08:27] I got it all.
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:32] Someday that trumpet's going to sound
[1:08:39] and the king of heaven will ride upon
[1:08:43] the clouds coming down.
[1:08:47] I'll hit my knees.
[1:08:50] [Music]
[1:08:53] I'm going home.
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:57] If I've got Jesus,
[1:09:01] I've got all that I could ever need.
[1:09:06] Take the world away from me and I'll be
[1:09:11] okay if I got Jesus.
[1:09:17] There's a hope that's living deep
[1:09:20] inside. A joy that I could never hide. A
[1:09:25] safe place to fall. If I got Jesus,
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:31] I got it all.
[1:09:35] If I got Jesus,
[1:09:39] I've got it all.
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:46] I got it all.
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:51] [Applause]
[1:09:53] Beautiful.
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:09:59] Amen. You can remain seated. We'll just
[1:10:01] sing a verse and a chorus of that song,
[1:10:04] Bula Land. I'm longing for you.
[1:10:08] Turn the service over to our pastor this
[1:10:10] morning.
[1:10:12] I'm kind of homesick
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:20] for
[1:10:22] a country.
[1:10:26] How many can say that this morning? To
[1:10:29] which I've never
[1:10:36] been
[1:10:37] before.
[1:10:43] No sad
[1:10:45] goodbyes
[1:10:49] will there be spoken
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:58] and time won't matter
[1:11:06] anymore.
[1:11:08] more
[1:11:13] of you the land
[1:11:20] I'm longing
[1:11:23] for
[1:11:25] you.
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:29] And someday
[1:11:36] on thee I will stand.
[1:11:44] There my hope
[1:11:51] shall be
[1:11:54] eternal.
[1:11:58] Oh, beautiful
[1:12:01] land.
[1:12:06] Sweet
[1:12:09] land. Just worship as the musicians
[1:12:11] continue to play it.
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:30] [Music]
[1:12:40] Bye-bye.
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:13:02] Heat.
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:08] Heat.
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:15:12] Amen.
[1:15:15] Let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:15:16] prayer.
[1:15:18] Lord, we thank you.
[1:15:21] We thank you, Father, thinking of that
[1:15:23] song, Bula Land that we're homesick for,
[1:15:27] that country,
[1:15:29] Lord, where we'll never grow old
[1:15:32] to that place, Lord, that the prophet
[1:15:34] spoke of in the great millennium.
[1:15:37] That's where we're headed, Lord. And we
[1:15:40] thank you that you've gone to prepare a
[1:15:42] place for us now, Lord, as we come to
[1:15:45] this portion of the service to minister
[1:15:48] your word. And I pray your blessings
[1:15:50] upon each one. Father, may the Holy
[1:15:54] Spirit come now and speak to us and give
[1:15:57] each of us what we have need of. Lord,
[1:15:59] bless the saints there in Mesa and the
[1:16:02] others that are streaming the service.
[1:16:05] Lord, Father, we just commit ourself
[1:16:08] into your hands for your service. Lord,
[1:16:11] we have nothing of our own. Simply what
[1:16:14] you've given to us. Now, we pray that
[1:16:17] you'll bless us. Now we pray in Jesus
[1:16:20] name.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Welcome to the house of the
[1:16:24] Lord everyone. So good to be in the
[1:16:26] house of the Lord with you. Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; And so we just uh greet you the lovely
[1:16:32] name of our Lord and Savior the Lord
[1:16:34] Jesus Christ. And I believe the all the
[1:16:36] announcements have been mentioned for
[1:16:39] the um coming uh work day and so forth
[1:16:42] that we have coming forward. And um we
[1:16:47] want to
[1:16:49] actually be in prayer for our meetings
[1:16:53] that we're preparing for. I think we
[1:16:54] just have three more Sundays and uh and
[1:16:58] then the meetings will be on. So um not
[1:17:02] a lot of time, but I'm certainly looking
[1:17:04] forward to the Lord pouring out his
[1:17:07] blessings upon us. Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. it's easier just to show up to
[1:17:13] special meetings. It's far more
[1:17:15] difficult to host them. And so, um, even
[1:17:20] when we have our meetings to host the
[1:17:23] meetings, it's always a little weight.
[1:17:26] And so, we just pray for the local for
[1:17:29] the local saints. We just pray that the
[1:17:31] Lord will give us the strength to um
[1:17:34] honor him in this great um feast time
[1:17:39] that we would just thank the Lord for
[1:17:41] we'll dedicate the building and then
[1:17:43] we'll just thank the Lord for another 10
[1:17:46] another set of years to to worshiping
[1:17:50] him and praising his name. Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And so we make that available. We try um
[1:17:57] sometimes we try to shorten the
[1:17:58] services, but it seems like we end up
[1:18:00] adding more,
[1:18:02] but um we certainly know that we'll get
[1:18:06] our rest on the other side. You work
[1:18:09] today, we rest on the other side. Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; So, God bless each of you. So nice to
[1:18:14] see each of you. God bless you
[1:18:16] originally. Everybody's feeling well.
[1:18:19] Amen. I didn't get to hear s all of your
[1:18:21] testimony, Sister Heather, but I'm sure
[1:18:22] it was good. and I'll go back and hear
[1:18:25] it. The Lord has done some great things
[1:18:28] there. Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Wow. Now we can go forward into the
[1:18:33] word. Let's all stand and turn in the
[1:18:36] scripture to first Peter chapter 5 and
[1:18:44] I'll take another scripture
[1:18:47] over in First Kings 17.
[1:18:54] Pardon?
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no. We have a baby
[1:18:58] dedication to do.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; So, please, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh
[1:19:03] my. Okay. We have a new nice young man,
[1:19:08] David.
[1:19:11] David McFaten.
[1:19:13] And um, Brother Edward and Sister
[1:19:16] Bethany. The Lord has blessed them.
[1:19:19] David Bellamy McFaten. And so as we
[1:19:23] prepare to go to
[1:19:26] dedicate this baby, let's get a
[1:19:29] scripture in Matthew
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:41] chapter
[1:19:44] actually take Mark chapter 10. Verse
[1:19:55] number 13.
[1:19:58] And they brought young children to him
[1:20:01] that he should touch them. And his
[1:20:04] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:20:06] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[1:20:10] displeased and said unto them, Suffer
[1:20:14] the little children to come unto me, and
[1:20:16] forbid them not, for such is the kingdom
[1:20:19] of God. Verily, I say unto you,
[1:20:21] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:20:23] of God as a little child, he shall not
[1:20:27] enter therein. And he took them up in
[1:20:30] his arms, and he put his hands upon
[1:20:32] them, and blessed them.
[1:20:36] quotation here. Brother Brandham says,
[1:20:39] "And God keeps his word." 1957, he says,
[1:20:43] "And now the Lord has given to you this
[1:20:45] lovely little one. Now you are
[1:20:48] dedicating it to him, putting it into
[1:20:50] his arms that God who has give you are
[1:20:55] returning back to him, giving it to him
[1:20:58] that he might bless its little life and
[1:21:01] make it a life of service. make it. Pray
[1:21:05] that God will make it a child that will
[1:21:08] bless your heart when you're old. And if
[1:21:10] Jesus terries, be a great worker for
[1:21:13] God. And you'll be proud of this. He
[1:21:16] says, "Little girl, we'll say, little
[1:21:18] boy, may God grant it now as we take her
[1:21:23] to bless her." It's a quote. And we pray
[1:21:26] God will bless
[1:21:28] little David. We'll read one more in the
[1:21:30] way of a true prophet. Actually,
[1:21:33] we'll read this one. In Joseph meeting
[1:21:36] his brethren, he says, "Because the baby
[1:21:39] as far as sin has none. Jesus died to
[1:21:43] take away the sins of the world. And the
[1:21:45] baby has done no sin. Only it's a
[1:21:48] sinner. It's born in sin. But when
[1:21:51] Christ died at Calvary, he took away the
[1:21:53] sins of the world. And the baby is not
[1:21:56] responsible until it becomes the age of
[1:21:58] accountability. And any little baby, no
[1:22:01] matter how sinful the parents are, as
[1:22:04] soon as it dies, it goes straight to the
[1:22:06] arms of Christ. See, because he paid the
[1:22:10] price. No matter if the baby's born in
[1:22:12] sin, by adultery, or whatever it is, it
[1:22:16] makes no difference at all. That baby is
[1:22:19] safe with Christ because he died to take
[1:22:22] away the sins of the world. And when it
[1:22:24] gets old enough now that it's done
[1:22:27] personal sin, then it has to repent for
[1:22:30] what it has done. But it has no personal
[1:22:33] sin until it's old enough to commit sin
[1:22:37] to know which is right and wrong. But
[1:22:38] now we always try to stay just as close
[1:22:41] to the Bible on these things as we know
[1:22:44] how.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; So we're going to dedicate our little
[1:22:47] brother David
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; um came to the men's prayer meeting this
[1:22:52] Saturday.
[1:22:54] Edward wanted him to be here. He came to
[1:22:56] his first prayer meeting and um early in
[1:23:01] the morning and the brothers surrounded
[1:23:02] him and we prayed for him and we thank
[1:23:05] the Lord for for that and another
[1:23:09] blessing. So let's sing that song as
[1:23:11] brother Edward and sister Bethany come.
[1:23:13] Bring them in.
[1:23:16] Bring them in.
[1:23:19] Bring them in from the fields of sin.
[1:23:25] Bring them in.
[1:23:28] Bring them in.
[1:23:31] Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[1:23:38] The first time I held him was yesterday
[1:23:40] morning and he was nice and snug over
[1:23:42] there at the house. But we stood right
[1:23:45] in the circle right here, a group of
[1:23:47] brothers, seven or eight of us. and we
[1:23:49] prayed the prayer of faith over his life
[1:23:53] and we thank God for that opportunity.
[1:23:55] Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, Sister Bethany, Brother
[1:23:58] Edward, bring little David to dedicate
[1:24:01] him to the Lord. So, let us pray. Dear
[1:24:03] Lord Jesus, in my hands I hold the
[1:24:07] fruits of a marriage that you brought
[1:24:10] together these two hearts, two
[1:24:12] believers.
[1:24:13] Lord, through much prayer and much
[1:24:16] consideration, Lord, they made the
[1:24:19] choice to follow you together. And you
[1:24:22] bless this home with this child, little
[1:24:25] David. Lord Jesus, I pray that the Holy
[1:24:29] Spirit would govern his life.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; lead him and protect him from all evil,
[1:24:35] all dangers. And Lord Jesus, if he grows
[1:24:39] older and time should tar, may he be a
[1:24:43] great worker for you. May his life be a
[1:24:46] testimony of your grace and your mercy
[1:24:48] moving forward the great message of the
[1:24:51] hour that you're the same yesterday,
[1:24:53] today, and forever.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Bless him. Bless this home. In the name
[1:24:58] of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at that baby. Isn't that
[1:25:04] nice? Well, look, he put his little hand
[1:25:06] up. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:25:09] you. All right, let's give the Lord a
[1:25:12] hand of praise.
[1:25:14] Amen.
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:19] All right.
[1:25:21] Thank you, deacons, for not letting me
[1:25:24] let that one by. Okay.
[1:25:27] So, in the scriptures,
[1:25:30] we want to take in
[1:25:38] I gave you two, right? Go to Revelations
[1:25:41] or First Peter chapter 5.
[1:25:44] Take that one first.
[1:25:52] Verse one. The elders which are among
[1:25:54] you I exhort who am also an elder and a
[1:25:59] witness of the sufferings of Christ and
[1:26:01] also are partaker of the glory that
[1:26:04] shall be revealed. Feed the flock of God
[1:26:07] which is among you. Taking the oversight
[1:26:10] thereof not by constraint but willingly
[1:26:13] not for filthy lucer but of a ready
[1:26:17] mind. neither as being lords over God's
[1:26:20] heritage, but being in samples to the
[1:26:23] flock. And when the chief shepherd shall
[1:26:27] appear, ye shall receive a crown of
[1:26:30] glory that fadeth not away. Amen. First
[1:26:34] Kings 17,
[1:26:43] the prophet of God takes the scripture
[1:26:44] in Kings and ministers a message
[1:26:50] um
[1:26:56] spiritual food in due season.
[1:27:06] And verse number two,
[1:27:08] and the word of the Lord came unto him,
[1:27:10] saying, Get thee hence, turn thee
[1:27:13] eastward, and hide thyself by the brook
[1:27:16] Cherith that is before Jordan, and it
[1:27:19] shall be that thou shalt drink of the
[1:27:21] brook, and I have commanded the ravens
[1:27:23] to feed thee there. Brother Brham makes
[1:27:27] a note and he highlights that not
[1:27:30] someplace else but right there. So he
[1:27:33] went and did according to the word of
[1:27:35] the Lord. For he went and dwelt by the
[1:27:37] brook Cherith that is before Jordan and
[1:27:41] the ravens brought him bread and flesh
[1:27:44] in the morning, bread and flesh in the
[1:27:46] evening. And he drank of the brook. And
[1:27:49] it came to pass after a while that the
[1:27:51] brook dried up because there had been no
[1:27:54] rain in the land. Amen. Let's take one
[1:27:58] more scripture just of the third
[1:28:00] confirmation in Revelations chapter 2
[1:28:03] quickly.
[1:28:20] and verse number 16.
[1:28:24] Repent or else I will come unto thee
[1:28:28] quickly and will fight against them
[1:28:32] and will fight against them with the
[1:28:34] sword of my mouth. He that hearath an
[1:28:37] ear, let him hear with the spirit saith
[1:28:40] unto the churches. To him that
[1:28:43] overcomemeth will I give to eat of the
[1:28:45] hidden mana and will give him a white
[1:28:48] stone. And in the stone a new name
[1:28:51] written which no man knoweth saving he
[1:28:54] that receiveth it. Amen. May God add a
[1:28:57] blessing to the reading of his word. The
[1:29:00] title of our message this morning is
[1:29:02] feed my sheep.
[1:29:04] Feed my sheep. God bless you. May be
[1:29:06] seated.
[1:29:09] Amen. spiritual food in due season.
[1:29:12] Brother Random takes a number of
[1:29:14] quotations there and he deals with
[1:29:20] Elijah and how the Lord provided a place
[1:29:25] for him to eat good food, clean food
[1:29:30] while the drought was on. He called for
[1:29:33] the drought and the prophet goes forward
[1:29:37] and tells us this is in 1965
[1:29:40] that we are in a spiritual drought
[1:29:43] today. There is a drought in the land
[1:29:46] but God has provided food for us during
[1:29:49] this drought.
[1:29:51] We know that the answer to the drought
[1:29:55] is food is water. when there is a
[1:29:58] drought, God uh the cry is for natural
[1:30:02] in the natural to have water so that it
[1:30:06] this would uh bring life to us. And no
[1:30:10] matter how many other drinks that are
[1:30:13] out there, we can't have any drinks
[1:30:16] without water. That is the main drink.
[1:30:19] That's the main source. So when that
[1:30:21] gets polluted, contaminated and grows
[1:30:24] scarce, then we could say that is a
[1:30:26] drought. And we are in a spiritual
[1:30:29] drought today. The prophet of God makes
[1:30:31] that very clear to us. And he shows it
[1:30:33] to us and the scripture shows us that we
[1:30:38] are in this drought. There is a drought
[1:30:40] in the land today. now.
[1:30:45] But I'm so glad that God has provided
[1:30:48] for us spiritual food in due season.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:30:57] um we had a wonderful service on
[1:30:59] Thursday night there in Mesa.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um um just thinking back on
[1:31:06] some of those things about the food that
[1:31:09] we're eating today in the food industry
[1:31:12] and the lies that are being told to us
[1:31:16] through the people that sell us food.
[1:31:20] Um they might say it's healthy. They
[1:31:23] might put a little heart on there that
[1:31:25] looks healthy
[1:31:27] and it might have all of the signs of
[1:31:30] being good for you to eat, but they will
[1:31:33] lie lie lie to you to get you to buy
[1:31:39] something and to consume something
[1:31:41] that's really not good for you. It's
[1:31:43] actually poisonous for you. But because
[1:31:46] of the advertising,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; and the the lust for conveniency,
[1:31:53] we will find ourselves eating at places
[1:31:56] that really is not good for our body.
[1:31:59] And oh, by the way, they're going to
[1:32:01] build a new place to eat here soon.
[1:32:05] They're constantly building these little
[1:32:08] places that you're supposed to eat and
[1:32:12] you're supposed to sustain your life
[1:32:13] with. They'll take that can of soda and
[1:32:17] they'll put a strawberry on there and it
[1:32:20] says strawberry soda.
[1:32:23] And you know what's not in the
[1:32:24] strawberry soda?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Strawberries.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Strawberries.
[1:32:28] But the picture says it's a straw. It's
[1:32:30] natural apple soda and and all of the
[1:32:33] deception that goes with the food
[1:32:37] administration
[1:32:39] and the food that has been contaminated
[1:32:41] over and over and over again. And we've
[1:32:45] heard it, haven't we?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And we kind of know it, don't we?
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; But it's so convenient just to stop and
[1:32:51] get a quick meal when you're hungry.
[1:32:55] I'd say it's probably better for you not
[1:32:57] to eat than to eat something bad.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Unless you are starving,
[1:33:03] which all of us are starving. How many
[1:33:07] use that term Americans? I'm starving.
[1:33:12] What are the people that are really
[1:33:13] starving doing?
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Um, it's an epidemic in the natural
[1:33:20] types, the spiritual.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; It's um really it's really um you're
[1:33:28] really being victimized.
[1:33:31] You don't know it, but somebody's got
[1:33:33] the gun trained at you
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; and trying to nail you.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; So, good to see you, Sister Barbara.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Welcome back. God bless you. And he is
[1:33:43] after you. He's after your dollars. He's
[1:33:46] after He doesn't care about your health.
[1:33:48] Doesn't care about the future for you.
[1:33:50] Doesn't care about any of those things.
[1:33:52] He's after the money. He's after your
[1:33:55] pocketbook.
[1:33:56] And so, it's just uh you know, that's
[1:33:59] the natural. We can go on and on and on
[1:34:01] about that. But it's a type of what is
[1:34:05] going on spiritually. Also,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God makes this statement
[1:34:10] in God's power to transform, paragraph
[1:34:12] 137. And he makes this statement here,
[1:34:14] and I have several. I can go down this
[1:34:16] line, but I'm not going to. I'm just
[1:34:18] going to read this one. Now, how the
[1:34:20] poison has struck the church, struck the
[1:34:22] earth, earth, Satan's poison upon the
[1:34:25] seeds has put cavities in it, and cause
[1:34:29] it to be deformed more and more. He
[1:34:33] sinks deeper into the hearts of the
[1:34:35] churches and in the hearts of the people
[1:34:38] and everything science science until
[1:34:41] it's become a place where the human race
[1:34:45] by being interbred I believe every seed
[1:34:48] should bring forth of its kind and the
[1:34:51] human race and the plant and all being
[1:34:54] interbred has brought us to a place in
[1:34:57] eating our food from the earth which our
[1:35:00] bodies has made hybrid
[1:35:03] It's put our whole minds
[1:35:07] now if our bodies are failing from 20 to
[1:35:11] 25 years old because of degenerated
[1:35:14] cells by hybrid foods. Don't our brain
[1:35:17] cells degenerate?
[1:35:19] Isn't that cells also?
[1:35:22] That's why Ricky runs through the street
[1:35:25] here with this hot rod while Ricetta
[1:35:29] Elovita and many of them as we would
[1:35:32] call name out here half naked before the
[1:35:35] people mentally gone.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; No more conceptions of decency or
[1:35:42] morals. Right.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; So, here the prophet of God is bringing
[1:35:46] to us
[1:35:48] um spiritual things and and this isn't a
[1:35:52] a teaching doctrinally.
[1:35:55] This isn't a a seven seal uh a teaching,
[1:35:58] but he's actually bringing us knowledge
[1:36:02] as to what's behind these these special
[1:36:05] these uh uh uh the hybrid foods that we
[1:36:08] have today. Amen.
[1:36:11] And he even connects it to the increase
[1:36:14] of homosexuality
[1:36:17] and to and the mental decline
[1:36:20] among
[1:36:23] the people today. They're mentally gone.
[1:36:26] I am just so sad to as our brother Art
[1:36:30] has a family member that has gone on.
[1:36:32] It's a really sad story. was in the
[1:36:34] public news there where this father and
[1:36:38] his two his two sons had had took the
[1:36:40] life of this father and I want you to
[1:36:43] pray for that family. Brother Art put it
[1:36:45] in the chat there. I don't have the name
[1:36:46] before me but we're supposed to do that
[1:36:49] funeral for this man and his two sons
[1:36:53] uh in their 20s
[1:36:56] um ended up
[1:36:59] allegedly murdering their father. So
[1:37:01] there's all these men are gone out of
[1:37:03] this one home and one sweep just like
[1:37:07] that. And it's sad, isn't it?
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; But the mental, you know, people can't
[1:37:12] take no for an answer.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; And the people can't, they have no
[1:37:17] patience to just really just even just
[1:37:20] just take a a normal disagreement or
[1:37:23] even an argument. They'll move a regular
[1:37:26] argument and they'll go from one to 10
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; and they're ready to pull out something
[1:37:31] to hurt you and physically harm you over
[1:37:34] a space in traffic
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; over just, you know, looking at them
[1:37:39] sideways or something and you can lose
[1:37:41] your life. And this young lady held the
[1:37:45] door open for this older uh woman
[1:37:48] hearing the news. And um the old lady
[1:37:52] held the door open and the young lady
[1:37:54] didn't even say thank you or didn't say
[1:37:55] anything. And then the grandmother said,
[1:37:57] you know, something back to her that you
[1:37:59] should at least say thank and that young
[1:38:01] woman took out a knife and killed this
[1:38:03] woman or gun or knife. I can't remember
[1:38:05] what it was, but she murdered her over a
[1:38:08] little disagreement of who opened the
[1:38:09] door. You didn't say thank you. You
[1:38:12] can't even say anything to anybody
[1:38:14] today.
[1:38:16] It's it's even in the churches. It's
[1:38:18] even in the churches. The people they'll
[1:38:21] call you the you know you're my father,
[1:38:24] you're my mother. You're supposed to
[1:38:26] care and concern over us. You're
[1:38:28] supposed to protect us. And then when
[1:38:30] you try to give that instruction to
[1:38:31] them, no, they want to flip that.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And they'll call you the pastor until
[1:38:36] you that you disagree with them. and the
[1:38:39] pastor tells them, "No, I don't agree
[1:38:41] with that." And then they'll turn and
[1:38:43] they'll flip that. And so you can't even
[1:38:45] you you're walking on eggshells, you
[1:38:47] know, you say one little thing, it's on
[1:38:49] your heart, this is bad behavior, and
[1:38:51] you go address the young man or the
[1:38:52] young lady, their feelings are so hurt,
[1:38:54] they won't come back to church no more.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sensitive. Really? Really? That's
[1:39:01] the That's the time we're living in. And
[1:39:04] the Bible said it would be that way. And
[1:39:07] the hybrid hybridation of the food is a
[1:39:12] great reason why. And the doctors will
[1:39:14] tell you this,
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; the mental health decline, the obesity
[1:39:20] crisis, not just outward obesity, but
[1:39:23] inside the organs, the the stress on
[1:39:27] your kidneys and your lungs and your
[1:39:29] heart are taking a hit because of this
[1:39:32] stress. and the foods that we're eating
[1:39:35] and the garbage that we're eating and
[1:39:39] it, you know, something has to give away
[1:39:43] for that. And the the drugs and all of
[1:39:47] the medications that are available for
[1:39:50] every little problem. We want the quick
[1:39:54] fix or the quick answer to get rid of.
[1:39:58] you know, they have this and I'm not
[1:40:00] against it, but they have these, you
[1:40:01] know, newer ways of what what whatever
[1:40:04] it is. If it's for your health, for
[1:40:07] losing weight, whatever, it's always the
[1:40:09] faster route that we want to take. And
[1:40:13] you know, if it's if it's good, if it's
[1:40:15] healthy for you, I say go for it. But I
[1:40:18] do I I would warn you to examine to see,
[1:40:22] you know, if it's really healthy for
[1:40:24] you, if it's really good for you. I was
[1:40:27] looking on the can of Coke. I I I
[1:40:29] mentioned this to the church. I think a
[1:40:31] Coke has 39 grams of sugar in it. And
[1:40:34] then I looked at Pepsi. And Pepsi
[1:40:36] usually wins the taste test in short
[1:40:38] measures. You know why? Because Pepsi is
[1:40:41] sweeter. Who How many Pepsi people here?
[1:40:43] How many Coke people say you're more
[1:40:45] Coke than Pepsi? Okay.
[1:40:48] It's all poison.
[1:40:50] Okay. So,
[1:40:53] 39 grams in the Coke.
[1:40:56] 41 gram in a Pepsi. 41 gram of sugar. 10
[1:41:01] tablespoons of sugar. A teaspoon. 10
[1:41:04] teaspoon of sugar in a cup that big. 12
[1:41:08] oz.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; And one ain't enough for us. We need 32
[1:41:14] ounces of that. We need a super size of
[1:41:17] it. The coolers can't get big enough.
[1:41:20] It's like, who's drinking out of that?
[1:41:24] You the the little camel. What we gonna
[1:41:27] do next? Put one of those camel
[1:41:29] backpacks on and fill it with a Pepsi.
[1:41:33] And when you read what's in that thing,
[1:41:35] it's poison.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Your doctor will tell you, your dentist
[1:41:41] will tell you this. They will tell you
[1:41:43] it's not good for you,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; but we do it anyway because it tastes
[1:41:48] good.
[1:41:50] And this is a crisis. It really is.
[1:41:55] Really, I'm not here to teach or preach
[1:41:56] to you on how on healthy eating
[1:41:59] naturally, but I will say that God gave
[1:42:02] you one body.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And when that heart stops, you stop.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And when those kidneys fail,
[1:42:11] go good luck finding some more.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And when your body starts to break down,
[1:42:17] the one you're supposed to serve the
[1:42:18] Lord in.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; So, who's behind all of this?
[1:42:22] Okay, that's in the natural. What about
[1:42:25] in the spiritual?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; What about in the spiritual?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah 28 that all
[1:42:32] tables are full of what?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Vomit.
[1:42:39] What kind of illustration is that there?
[1:42:41] You're coming to the table to eat
[1:42:43] something good, something clean, and
[1:42:46] there's vomit on the table. Now, I can
[1:42:48] eat some old food. I can eat some food
[1:42:50] that don't taste good. We can eat food
[1:42:52] that's not seasoned well, but I am not
[1:42:54] eating any vomit.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; You are not either.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And why does the prophet use this
[1:43:01] illustration that all the tables
[1:43:05] are full of what?
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Vomit and there's not one clean place.
[1:43:15] But God has provided
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; some hidden food
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; in a special place.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; He told Elijah, "Go over here. I'm going
[1:43:25] to feed you
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; there. Over there. Right there. That's
[1:43:31] where I'm going to feed you.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, what you going to do? You're going
[1:43:35] to send a Uber out here?
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You're going to send some kind of uh
[1:43:39] delivery service? I I got you covered.
[1:43:42] Elijah,
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; I have commanded the ravens.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; One place the crows even
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; the ravens,
[1:43:52] little black birds, to bring you bread
[1:43:54] and flesh in the morning, bread and
[1:43:57] flesh in the evening.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; God blessed the ravens.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; And he kept the voice of Elijah alive.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; What about you and I today? God has
[1:44:09] given us hidden food
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; in due season.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; All the tables are full of vomit except
[1:44:17] for the table.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; You get that? The table app.
[1:44:24] There's a clean place to get the word of
[1:44:27] the Lord
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; and it's in this message
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; and it's hidden from the unbeliever or
[1:44:34] the makeeliever.
[1:44:36] But this is why we still have our minds
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; and the soundness of our mind.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; It's not because we're smarter than
[1:44:47] anyone else, but because of the food
[1:44:50] that we're eating. It's keeping our
[1:44:53] minds right,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; keeping our thoughts pure, keeping us
[1:44:59] healthy,
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; able to withstand
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; and the most wicked of all the ages.
[1:45:06] This is the most wicked age of all the
[1:45:08] ages.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; It's the worst one.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; But God has given us hidden food.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Spiritual food in due season.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God makes this statement in
[1:45:20] spiritual food in due season. Paragraph
[1:45:23] number 90 says this here. Now the carnal
[1:45:26] mind wraps up the thing in their own
[1:45:27] ideas. Then God sends down and unfolds
[1:45:31] the thing by his power. Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what took place here in
[1:45:36] the days of Ahab. Now, we find out that
[1:45:39] Elijah could say that because the
[1:45:41] message of the hour and the word of God
[1:45:46] or the messenger, the message, the
[1:45:50] message and the word
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; was exactly the same thing. the prophet,
[1:45:56] the word, the message, messenger,
[1:45:59] message and message
[1:46:02] was the same.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If I do not the works that
[1:46:06] was written of me, then don't believe
[1:46:08] me." That's good.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Any man and his message is one.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; That's why today they don't they don't
[1:46:18] believe in doing the works of God
[1:46:20] because they do not accept the message
[1:46:21] of God. They don't believe the message.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; But those who believe God's hour that
[1:46:28] we're living in, these things are hidden
[1:46:31] food.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Just think, God has so hidden that they
[1:46:36] look right at it and don't see it. The
[1:46:38] same way that Elijah blinded the Syrian
[1:46:41] army. The same way that God blinds the
[1:46:43] unbeliever from the true genuine food of
[1:46:47] the child, the believer.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; What they call Noah, a fanatic, building
[1:46:51] an ark. His eyes were open to the word
[1:46:53] of God and the promise. The very thing
[1:46:55] that they call fanaticism saved Noah and
[1:46:58] his family. See, the very same thing,
[1:47:01] the thing that people laugh at, is the
[1:47:04] thing that we pray for.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; The thing that people calls crazy, we
[1:47:08] call great.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; What the world calls great, God calls
[1:47:12] foolish.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; And what the world calls foolish, God
[1:47:16] calls great.
[1:47:18] It's just exactly the contrast between
[1:47:21] right and wrong. Jesus Christ is the
[1:47:24] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:47:27] Remember,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; he went into his secret place by the
[1:47:31] plan of God, by the call of God
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; and the word of God.
[1:47:40] Elijah entered into his secret place by
[1:47:43] God's fornowledge plan and the call upon
[1:47:48] his life according to the word. And that
[1:47:51] if that ain't what we entered in, I
[1:47:54] don't know what we get there.
[1:47:57] So this is the plan of God.
[1:48:01] This is your health care plan.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; This is the stability for your mind.
[1:48:10] This is the psychiatrist for the
[1:48:13] believer.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; This is the drug that we can't do
[1:48:18] without.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; I am the healer.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; I am your healer.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I am Jehovah Rafa.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; He's the healer of your mind, your body,
[1:48:37] your soul. He's the healer of everything
[1:48:41] associated with the believer
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; and his name is Jesus Christ.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; You know, this crisis has hit the
[1:48:50] people.
[1:48:52] It's hit the churches. It's hit the land
[1:48:55] that we're in right now. But God has
[1:48:58] provided
[1:48:59] some food for us, the true believer
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; that we can feed on.
[1:49:05] Now he uses the office or the ministry
[1:49:09] of the shepherd, the chief shepherd
[1:49:13] which is Christ Jesus and then the
[1:49:15] prophet shepherd which is the messenger
[1:49:17] to the age and then the local shepherds
[1:49:21] is what God uses to feed his sheep.
[1:49:26] Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Let's take a scripture in um
[1:49:33] St. Luke
[1:49:37] John chapter 21 actually St. John 21,
[1:49:49] you turn there to John 21. And if you
[1:49:52] could on the screen, give me 1 Peter 5:4
[1:49:55] just one more time quickly.
[1:49:58] Sis, I want to read from there just
[1:50:01] quickly as a quick note. And when the
[1:50:02] chief shepherd shall appear, so let's
[1:50:05] start with verse one. And here the
[1:50:09] apostle Paul he said the elders which
[1:50:12] are among you I exhort who am also an
[1:50:18] elder. So he as an elder is exhorting
[1:50:23] the other elders.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; And then in verse number four he brings
[1:50:28] in the chief shepherd
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; and he's telling the elders to feed the
[1:50:33] flock which is what a shepherd does.
[1:50:36] So we see this order of Paul,
[1:50:39] the local elders, and the chief shepherd
[1:50:43] all in this verse here. Can you see
[1:50:45] that?
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Paul, I'm also an elder. To the elders,
[1:50:50] feed the flock of God is what he's
[1:50:52] telling them. Now, St. John chapter 20
[1:50:55] uh says this and take verse number
[1:50:59] which one I want verse number 17, I
[1:51:02] think.
[1:51:10] John 21. Thank you. Yes. Verse number
[1:51:16] Thank you so much. Yes.
[1:51:19] Let's go up just a little bit.
[1:51:23] Verse 15. So when they had died, Jesus
[1:51:26] said to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas,
[1:51:29] lovest thou me more than these? He said
[1:51:32] unto him, "Yes, Lord, thou knowest that
[1:51:35] I love thee?" He said unto him, "Feed my
[1:51:38] lambs."
[1:51:40] He said to him again the second
[1:51:42] time,"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
[1:51:44] me?" He said unto him, "Yes, Lord, thou
[1:51:47] knowest that I love thee?" He said unto
[1:51:49] him, "Feed my sheep."
[1:51:51] And he saith unto him the third
[1:51:53] time,"Simon,
[1:51:55] son of Jonas, lovest thou me?"
[1:51:58] Peter was grieved because he had said
[1:52:00] unto him the third time, let's just stop
[1:52:03] there. Peter, you denied him three
[1:52:06] times. It's only fair that you confess
[1:52:08] him three times. He said unto him the
[1:52:12] third time, "Lovest thou me?" And he
[1:52:14] said unto him, "Lord, thou knowest all
[1:52:16] things. Thou knowest that I love thee."
[1:52:18] Jesus said unto him, "Feed my sheep." Of
[1:52:23] course, we know the sheep are the
[1:52:25] adults. The lambs are the younger sheep.
[1:52:29] So he's commanded to feed the adults and
[1:52:33] the little ones.
[1:52:35] This is what the true shepherd is
[1:52:38] supposed to do.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; This is what a local shepherd, this is
[1:52:41] what the prophet shepherd does.
[1:52:44] He feeds the sheep sheep food.
[1:52:48] He doesn't she feed them um um he
[1:52:53] doesn't kick the sheep. He doesn't drive
[1:52:55] the sheep. He doesn't um feed the sheep
[1:53:00] just anything. He feeds them sheep food.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bam answers this question
[1:53:06] and questions and answers. I like the
[1:53:10] the the detail of it is uh uh uh 1961
[1:53:14] questions and answers. Question number
[1:53:15] 50 153. Brother Brandham, what did Jesus
[1:53:18] mean in St. John 21:15-17
[1:53:21] when he asked Peter if he loved him and
[1:53:23] told him to feed his lambs then he said
[1:53:26] feed my sheep and in the 17th verse he
[1:53:28] said again feed my sheep so well that is
[1:53:32] merely this see Christ is the shepherd
[1:53:35] he was going away he was leaving the
[1:53:37] commission of his sheep which any
[1:53:40] shepherd feeds which is his flock his
[1:53:43] church he was leading or leaving the
[1:53:46] commission with these disciples to
[1:53:48] continue to feed the flock, to be a
[1:53:50] shepherd, feed the sheep. In other
[1:53:53] words, like this, if you look out here
[1:53:55] this morning, that's what I'm doing.
[1:53:57] Now, sheep will only grow as you give
[1:54:00] them sheep food.
[1:54:03] Now, if you would fry up a big hamburger
[1:54:06] and give it to a sheep, he couldn't grow
[1:54:07] on that because, see, that's not sheep
[1:54:10] food. And if you would fry up, have a
[1:54:13] nice t-bone steak fixed up, give it over
[1:54:16] to the sheep, it's not sheep food. He
[1:54:18] just couldn't eat it, that's all.
[1:54:20] Because he's a sheep. But sheep like
[1:54:23] sheep food. Well, then when you're to
[1:54:25] feed the flock of God, don't feed them
[1:54:28] on some manmade theology.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Feed them on the word.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; That's where the sheep grow from.
[1:54:39] Feed the word.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Be a shepherd, a true shepherd. Feed my
[1:54:45] sheep. Lambs is the little ones, of
[1:54:48] course. Sheep is the adult. So, both
[1:54:51] young and old, feed the flock of God.
[1:54:55] See, and feed them with the word. The
[1:54:58] word, you see, it's the truth. Jesus
[1:55:01] said, "My uh man shall not live by bread
[1:55:04] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[1:55:05] out of the mouth of God." Is that right?
[1:55:07] So then if man is to live and they are
[1:55:10] the flock of God, this the church, then
[1:55:14] they are to thrive upon the word and
[1:55:17] manner of God.
[1:55:20] This is his mana
[1:55:23] in the Bible. We can just come through
[1:55:25] it over here in the churches. Jesus is
[1:55:28] the hidden mana. Christ is the church's
[1:55:31] mana. What is mana? Mana in the Old
[1:55:34] Testament was what come down from heaven
[1:55:36] fresh every night to sustain the church
[1:55:39] in its journey. Is that right?
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Now in the New Testament, what is the
[1:55:44] hidden mana? A little while and the
[1:55:46] world seeth me no more hidden yet ye
[1:55:49] shall see me. For I'll be with you even
[1:55:53] in you to the end of the world. And
[1:55:55] Christ is the hidden mana
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; that comes from God out of heaven. A
[1:56:01] fresh every day. every day.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; You know, when you're feeding on this
[1:56:05] mana, there's a mystery to your life.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; The outsider looking at you can't really
[1:56:11] figure you out.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; They don't know how you're thriving.
[1:56:14] They don't know how you things are
[1:56:15] moving for you. You have the same issues
[1:56:18] and problems like others, but you keep
[1:56:20] moving right on. Why?
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; It's directly associated to what you are
[1:56:27] eating on. The reason you can stand
[1:56:30] today,
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; if you have a praise, it's because of
[1:56:34] what you're feeding on.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; If you have strength in this hour, it's
[1:56:38] because of what you're feeding on.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; If you are a believer in this hour, it's
[1:56:45] because of what you're feeding on.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; You are what you eat. Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; And we're eating on the hidden mana from
[1:56:57] Almighty God.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; You can't get this anywhere.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; It's not anywhere, but it's in a special
[1:57:15] place. It's hidden mana, hidden from the
[1:57:18] world.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:23] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Sheep grow from
[1:57:32] that's where they grow from. You feed
[1:57:33] them the word. Be a true shepherd.
[1:57:36] We can't say, "Well, two weeks ago I had
[1:57:39] a great experience of God."
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 84.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; What about right now?
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; See, every day fresh, a new blessing. A
[1:57:50] new blessing.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] Like like bro, you was doing that dance
[1:57:54] last week. Well, this is a new dance
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; because I got a new blessing
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; every day. Another fresh blessing.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Where when she going to stop dancing?
[1:58:10] She ain't going to stop dancing. When he
[1:58:12] going to stop d ain't going to stop
[1:58:14] dancing. It's blessing after blessing
[1:58:17] after blessing.
[1:58:19] I'll bless the Lord at all time.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; His praise
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; shall continually be in my mouth.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; It's a new blessing.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't get old.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; You waiting for us to be quiet. We just
[1:58:36] going to get louder.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; You waiting for us to stop. We just
[1:58:39] getting started.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; You're waiting for this to calm down. I
[1:58:44] can't calm down.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; The blessings
[1:58:49] keep overtaking me.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Go to sleep in my night in the night
[1:58:55] sleep. I'm sleeping. I'm blessed.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; I wake up in the morning. I'm blessed.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; On my way to work, I'm blessed. I'm
[1:59:03] blessed in the city. I'm blessed in the
[1:59:06] field. I'm blessed when I lay down. I'm
[1:59:09] blessed when I get back up again.
[1:59:12] Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[1:59:14] Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I'm
[1:59:17] blessed
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; and I'm eating the hidden mana.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; The mana from on high.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; This blessing you can't take from me.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; You didn't give it to me. You can't take
[1:59:31] it from me. The world didn't give it to
[1:59:34] me
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; and the world can't take it away from
[1:59:39] me.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; It's hidden mana.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; It's mana. I didn't know it was this
[1:59:45] strong.
[1:59:47] I didn't know it was that powerful.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; I was just sitting in church listening
[1:59:51] to the tape
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; and I heard something that was good and
[1:59:54] I said amen.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; And when I said amen, that thing hit me
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; and got a hold of my life.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; It be to work in my body,
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; doing for me what I couldn't do for
[2:00:08] myself.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:18] Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; This word is doing for me what I
[2:00:24] couldn't do for myself.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just feeding on it.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Saying amen to it.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Then I get out in the out of out in the
[2:00:34] streets there and there's a strength
[2:00:37] that comes within
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; that I don't know where it comes from.
[2:00:40] It's hidden from the world. Hallelujah.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; It's hidden from even your own mind.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; You can't figure out how God has kept
[2:00:48] you and blessed you and sustained you
[2:00:52] and kept you clean
[2:00:56] and such a dark hour.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; It's directly a
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; because of the food that you're eating.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; We are feeding on
[2:01:12] the body word of the son of man.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; We're feeding on the words of the son of
[2:01:18] man.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Eat my flesh and drink my blood and you
[2:01:23] will have life in you.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; This is what we're feeding on. Satan is
[2:01:27] not just coming to church.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; We're not just paying our tithe and
[2:01:30] coming to church. We're actually eating
[2:01:33] something
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; and being sustained by the food that
[2:01:37] we're The food that we're eating is
[2:01:39] supernatural.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; It's got vitamins the world don't know
[2:01:44] about. It's got power that the world
[2:01:46] don't know about. It's got energy that
[2:01:50] the world knows nothing about.
[2:01:53] It'll make a old man young again.
[2:01:57] He restores his strength.
[2:02:01] Amen.
[2:02:03] [Music]
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; It's the food of God.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; It's energy.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; There's vitamins.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; And one of these mornings,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; you'll be eating so full.
[2:02:18] Then your body will be changed and
[2:02:22] you'll go on the rapture.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; You put on
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; immortality.
[2:02:32] Hallelujah.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; And your body
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; will be changed
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
[2:02:42] This is what we're eating, saints.
[2:02:45] It's powerful.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; It's powerful.
[2:02:56] Talk about an energy drink,
[2:02:58] an energy bar,
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; all these little energy things and eat
[2:03:03] this and stay awake. No, no, no, no, no.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Get This is the energy right here.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; This is where This is
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; This is This is going to keep you alive,
[2:03:12] man.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; This is will sustain you.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; This will keep you moving
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; in the army of the Lord.
[2:03:25] God help us
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; to move forward in this
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; now. This is hidden to the world.
[2:03:34] It's hidden to the makebeliever, but the
[2:03:36] true believer can catch it. Is that
[2:03:39] right?
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; You know these shepherds, Moses was a
[2:03:43] prophet shepherd. Exodus 3:1 tells us
[2:03:48] that he was tending the sheep of his
[2:03:52] father-in-law and God calls him
[2:03:57] and that's Exodus 3:1.
[2:04:00] In Ezekiel 34 2-4,
[2:04:04] it gives a woe to the shepherds that
[2:04:06] don't feed the sheep properly.
[2:04:10] In Exodus 34 23,
[2:04:13] it gives
[2:04:15] a prophecy of the shepherds that I
[2:04:20] will set up shepherds for you and give
[2:04:23] you shepherds after my own heart.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; And these shepherds will feed the the
[2:04:28] church of God.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; You know, there's some false shepherds
[2:04:31] out there
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; and there's some bad food out there.
[2:04:34] Yes, I agree. And there's some false
[2:04:37] things out there. But there's something
[2:04:38] true.
[2:04:40] that God has given to us in this hour.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; And my question to you is, what are you
[2:04:45] eating on
[2:04:47] will determine what kind of a spiritual
[2:04:50] strength you have?
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; It's directly connected.
[2:04:56] David was a prophet. The Bible calls him
[2:04:59] that. In one sense, he was a prophet. In
[2:05:02] another, he was a king as well.
[2:05:05] Acts chapter 2 verses 29-30. Let's read
[2:05:09] that just quickly.
[2:05:13] My fingers will be in the back there.
[2:05:16] Thank you. Men and brethren, let me
[2:05:18] freely speak unto you the patriarch
[2:05:20] David that he is both dead and buried in
[2:05:22] his supplicers with us today. Therefore,
[2:05:25] being a what? a prophet, knowing that
[2:05:29] God has sworn with an oath to him that
[2:05:32] of the fruit of his loins according to
[2:05:34] the flesh, he would raise up Christ to
[2:05:36] sit on his throne. All of those
[2:05:39] prophecies
[2:05:40] in Psalms were a prophetic utterance
[2:05:44] that Javid got under the anointing. We
[2:05:47] know in the grander sense of the word of
[2:05:51] what a prophet is. If you just take the
[2:05:53] message trying to do God a service
[2:05:55] without being his will, we see that
[2:05:57] David was not a prophet in the sense as
[2:05:59] a major prophet. But he came under the
[2:06:02] prophetic anointings and he prophesied
[2:06:06] true things.
[2:06:09] By the same sense, a New Testament
[2:06:11] preacher is considered a prophet as
[2:06:13] well.
[2:06:15] He's not a prophet in the sense of a
[2:06:18] prophet uh of of the office of a prophet
[2:06:22] like um what we call a major prophet but
[2:06:26] he's prophesying the prophetic
[2:06:29] utterances of the scripture and bringing
[2:06:32] in the word of the Lord. Brother Benham
[2:06:34] says in Elijah and the meal offering, he
[2:06:36] says this in paragraph 113.
[2:06:39] He makes this statement.
[2:06:44] Bless all the ministers that are here
[2:06:46] tonight.
[2:06:49] You precious prophets.
[2:06:52] We pray we pray that you'll anoint them,
[2:06:56] Lord, and may they be the one you bless
[2:07:00] bless the homes of these people. All
[2:07:02] right. All right. So, brother Adam is
[2:07:03] referring to the ministers here and he
[2:07:06] calls them prophets.
[2:07:09] But are they prophets in the sense of uh
[2:07:12] prophet shepherd?
[2:07:14] Well, we'd have to say no. We see that
[2:07:18] there is the office of a prophet and
[2:07:20] there's a gift of prophecy and there's
[2:07:23] the prophecies that a minister would do.
[2:07:26] A and minister is prophetic. It's word.
[2:07:30] It's absolutely true. And God has
[2:07:33] established that in the church. So what
[2:07:35] do we have here? We have the chief
[2:07:37] shepherd. First Peter chapter 5. We have
[2:07:40] a prophet shepherd. Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And then we have the local shepherd.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; And the prophet shepherd can't be
[2:07:52] misinterpreted for the chief shepherd.
[2:07:55] If you say he's the chief shepherd, then
[2:07:58] you're saying something that he did not
[2:08:00] say.
[2:08:02] and actually going contrary to what he
[2:08:04] did and what he said.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ is the chief
[2:08:09] shepherd.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd of our souls. A
[2:08:14] prophet shepherd comes under the chief
[2:08:17] shepherd. Can I get a witness?
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; And then under the prophet shepherd is a
[2:08:22] local shepherd. Now, that local shepherd
[2:08:24] is not a prophet shepherd. Doesn't have
[2:08:28] the authority that the prophet shepherd
[2:08:30] has. And you don't you can't mix those
[2:08:32] up. Amen.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And so with the local shepherd, they're
[2:08:37] still God's sheep that that local
[2:08:40] shepherd should be pastoring or leading
[2:08:44] that flock to the word of God.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And just like the pastor or the
[2:08:52] local shepherd is not called
[2:08:55] to shepherd over the prophet, neither
[2:08:57] are the sheep called to shepherd over
[2:08:59] themselves.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I brought that last because that's
[2:09:04] where it's going to get tighter.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. the local sheep. We have many of
[2:09:08] them that sheep and shepherd themselves
[2:09:12] and they want to hold the local shepherd
[2:09:17] accountable but they themselves have to
[2:09:19] be held accountable too.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; God has established a church and that
[2:09:24] church is set up with pastors, pastor,
[2:09:28] pastors, apostles, preacher uh teachers,
[2:09:31] evangelists and those five ministering
[2:09:33] gifts that we find in Ephesians.
[2:09:36] And while the age might change and
[2:09:40] people may change,
[2:09:44] God's word is not going to change.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; And these shepherds
[2:09:56] are
[2:10:00] commanded to feed my sheep. So the care
[2:10:05] and the concern of the sheep is the
[2:10:07] responsibility of the great shepherd.
[2:10:10] And with this great shepherd which is
[2:10:12] called also the chief shepherd he has a
[2:10:16] prophet shepherd. And through that
[2:10:19] prophet shepherd he brings the message
[2:10:21] down to the people and in that people
[2:10:25] group is a local shepherd. The chief
[2:10:28] shepherd Jesus Christ is the leader of
[2:10:30] all the shepherds. We can call him as we
[2:10:34] would say king of kings. We call him
[2:10:35] shepherd of shepherds.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; And we can we can look at him as God the
[2:10:46] one who sent Elijah the prophet to be
[2:10:49] the prophet shepherd for this age. Amen.
[2:10:54] with that Elijah the prophet and all
[2:10:57] those that are called to be a part of
[2:10:58] that great ministry. They uh they find
[2:11:02] their place, they find their position.
[2:11:05] So what do we see today? We see
[2:11:08] scattered sheep,
[2:11:10] scattered shepherds,
[2:11:12] scattered just doing their own thing.
[2:11:14] Like in the book of Judges, every man
[2:11:16] did what was they thought was right in
[2:11:19] their own minds.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; They're just doing their own thing.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the accountability
[2:11:26] is nowhere. They they have no account.
[2:11:29] But it's it's easier to do. It's what
[2:11:32] they it's what it's what is allowed now.
[2:11:35] But the word of God is still there. And
[2:11:37] I don't know the exact recourse. But I
[2:11:40] do know if you devi
[2:11:46] somewhere down the line.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; You can't build this house on part of
[2:11:50] the word. It's got to be all of it.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; And you can't um uh um fail from
[2:11:58] bringing all of the word. So, it's not
[2:12:00] it's not only what the shepherds are
[2:12:02] saying, it's what they're not saying.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; If they fail to preach the whole council
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; of God, they'll be held accountable.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; You're not feeding the sheep properly.
[2:12:16] You're feeding them the part that you
[2:12:18] wanted to feed them that was convenient,
[2:12:20] that's popular for the day.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; But all of the word of God is sheep
[2:12:25] food.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; And all of the word of God has vitamins
[2:12:29] in it
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; that is necessary for the body change
[2:12:34] and for the rapture.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; It's all necessary.
[2:12:38] All the visions, all the quotations, all
[2:12:41] the scriptures
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; are necessary to be on God's table
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; for his people to eat from. Amen.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; It's the call of God to feed my sheep.
[2:12:54] It's the demand on the life of a
[2:12:56] shepherd to feed my sheep.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; What do you feed them? You feed them the
[2:13:00] word of the Lord. Huh? You know, a sheep
[2:13:04] can eat other foods. You know that.
[2:13:07] And there's some foods that's not
[2:13:09] balanced for him. That's I looked up
[2:13:11] just quickly. What's the best food that
[2:13:15] you can feed a natural sheep? And the
[2:13:17] best food is is primary feed. The best
[2:13:21] feed is pasture raised feed.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Can we spell that word pasture for you?
[2:13:29] Do we
[2:13:31] pastor-raised feed?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; This is the feed that's growing. It's
[2:13:36] still alive. If it's out there growing
[2:13:38] in the field, you let the little sheep,
[2:13:40] you let the limbs go out there and you
[2:13:41] go eat. It's a harder process.
[2:13:45] It's longer. It takes more energy to
[2:13:48] sustain that.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; But it's the best I in and for the human
[2:13:53] being, it be from the soil to your
[2:13:56] table.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; That's the best food you can get. I just
[2:14:01] picked it off the tree and it's at my
[2:14:03] table. I'm eating it now. But what the
[2:14:06] food industry has done today, we have
[2:14:08] all these middlemen
[2:14:11] that from the ground it goes into a
[2:14:14] warehouse and then another place and
[2:14:17] then another place and they inject it
[2:14:19] and they spray it and they duplicate.
[2:14:20] They want it fatter. They want it faster
[2:14:22] and then send it to another place to
[2:14:24] another place and you don't know. You
[2:14:26] don't know where them beans came from.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; You don't know where your food came
[2:14:33] from.
[2:14:34] Huh?
[2:14:36] If you grew it yourself, you would.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right, Brother Chris?
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:43] Takes more energy. Takes more time. You
[2:14:46] got to be involved. Your fingernails got
[2:14:48] to get dirty.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; You got to be a part of the little
[2:14:52] seedling coming up.
[2:14:54] You're interested in it from the
[2:14:56] beginning to the end.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; And this is how the word of the Lord
[2:15:00] works.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Can I take 10 more? All right, mermaid.
[2:15:04] What time is it? 12:00.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord is a seed
[2:15:10] and it has to mature and it has to grow.
[2:15:15] So let let me let me pull off this
[2:15:18] message here just for a moment. I have
[2:15:19] to stop here. God bless you so much. But
[2:15:22] let me get into something here. I didn't
[2:15:25] give you this in the back, sis, but this
[2:15:27] is in
[2:15:30] the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:15:33] that the prophet preached on
[2:15:38] bringing the church ages. All right.
[2:15:43] In there
[2:15:47] in paragraph number 70 and this will
[2:15:49] help us with some of the prophecies.
[2:15:51] I've talked to different ones and people
[2:15:53] who are concerned. He said, "Brother,
[2:15:55] there's these quotes and why isn't our
[2:15:57] church or why isn't the church thriving
[2:16:00] like it should?" We have these quotes of
[2:16:02] what should be taking place. You don't
[2:16:04] see them, right?
[2:16:06] And but there's an element to a seed
[2:16:09] that you have to that we must consider.
[2:16:12] Okay?
[2:16:15] And this is paragraph number 70D in
[2:16:18] Revelations chapter 1. It's the brother
[2:16:22] uh
[2:16:24] brother Mammal's version. So it's going
[2:16:26] to be a little bit further back. So I'll
[2:16:28] start to read it and you can find it for
[2:16:29] me. Okay.
[2:16:30] All right.
[2:16:34] Now, the third verse, he announces the
[2:16:36] blessing. Look, listen at this. Blessed
[2:16:39] is he that readeth and they that hear
[2:16:41] the words of the pro this prophecy and
[2:16:43] keep those things which are written
[2:16:45] therein. For the time is at hand.
[2:16:50] Revelations chapter 1.
[2:16:53] What time is at hand? Question mark. The
[2:16:56] time these things take place. when this
[2:16:59] revelation of Jesus Christ is completed
[2:17:02] in each church age. Now the reason he
[2:17:06] wrote it like this if he' said well now
[2:17:10] they was looking for him if it had been
[2:17:13] revealed
[2:17:15] if it would have been revealed to John.
[2:17:18] Thank you. I'll wait because you all
[2:17:20] don't listen until it's on the screen.
[2:17:22] You guys been trained that way. So let's
[2:17:23] get to 113. That's where it's at.
[2:17:26] What time is at hand? The time these
[2:17:29] things take place when this revelation
[2:17:32] of Jesus Christ is completed in each
[2:17:34] church age. Now the reason he wrote it
[2:17:37] like this if he had said well now they
[2:17:40] was looking for him if it had been
[2:17:42] revealed if it would have been revealed
[2:17:45] to John that he was going to come as
[2:17:48] soon as those churches there was
[2:17:49] finished. That's the way John thought
[2:17:53] it.
[2:17:55] But it was them churches soon as they
[2:17:58] was finished. If he knew if he had if it
[2:18:01] had been revealed to him there was going
[2:18:03] to be seven long church ages, several
[2:18:06] thousand years or several hundred years,
[2:18:09] then there wouldn't be no reason of
[2:18:11] waiting. They just live their church
[2:18:14] age. Therefore, God spoke it and it
[2:18:18] wasn't revealed to them. It wasn't
[2:18:20] revealed to Martin Luther. the things
[2:18:22] that John Wesley knew about the
[2:18:24] scripture. It wasn't revealed to the
[2:18:26] Baptist what the Pentecostal knows about
[2:18:28] the scripture because it's in a
[2:18:30] different age. This is a different time.
[2:18:33] And God reveals his things just in the
[2:18:36] season.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't plant corn in the
[2:18:40] springtime and reap it at the same time.
[2:18:44] You plant a seed and it grows to
[2:18:47] maturity. Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; God plants his word and then it grows
[2:18:52] right out. Then we look back and say,
[2:18:54] "There it is."
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Sure, we see it after it's been
[2:18:59] revealed.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Can we say that the first gener
[2:19:04] generation saints
[2:19:06] things that we see today, they didn't
[2:19:08] see?
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Could we say that?
[2:19:11] just following that pattern. Those in
[2:19:13] 1970 didn't see what those in the 80s
[2:19:17] maybe saw.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; And then in the 2000s when the t table
[2:19:22] app and the message become more
[2:19:23] available, maybe the ones before didn't
[2:19:26] see that they not that they don't
[2:19:28] believe, but they just it's just a
[2:19:29] different age, different time. Same
[2:19:31] seed, but it's maturing now.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; And this is what a revelation does for
[2:19:36] you.
[2:19:38] You have to let the seed develop.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; When you take a hold on the seed of the
[2:19:44] word of God,
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; you say amen to it whether you
[2:19:48] understand it or not.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; But you know the source that is coming
[2:19:52] from is the word of the Lord. So you
[2:19:56] stand on it
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; and it will be revealed
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; in its season.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. in its season.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; This goes to when brother Brandham says,
[2:20:11] "I hope I live to see a church
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; that he can walk in and there'll be no
[2:20:16] sin in the place."
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; If he lived long enough, he'd like to
[2:20:20] see it. He He would desire to see it.
[2:20:22] You can't make the seed develop. You
[2:20:25] can't plant the seed and then um reap
[2:20:28] from that same seed at the same time.
[2:20:30] Can I close with one last scripture?
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Let's take one last scripture as I
[2:20:34] close. It's in the New Testament.
[2:20:36] And it's part of what we started with.
[2:20:39] Did we read that in
[2:20:43] St. Luke chapter 2? Yeah. This is a
[2:20:46] coming of our Lord Jesus.
[2:20:49] Like a Christmas message, you would
[2:20:51] think at his first coming. Luke chapter
[2:20:54] 2. Remember all the Old Testament saints
[2:20:57] was waiting on
[2:20:59] this prophecy of Isaiah. A virgin shall
[2:21:04] conceive.
[2:21:06] There is coming a light
[2:21:09] to destroy
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; the Gentiles.
[2:21:13] There's coming a light among us. A great
[2:21:16] king will be born.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Huh? And those Old Testament saints were
[2:21:20] waiting on that. There was there was
[2:21:22] waiting on they were waiting. They were
[2:21:23] waiting. Generation after generation
[2:21:25] waiting, waiting. And then when John
[2:21:27] came, they said, "Is this the one?" He
[2:21:30] says, "No, I'm not him,
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to baptize you in all."
[2:21:34] The Bible says, "All the region," we had
[2:21:36] it on Wednesday night. All the regions
[2:21:38] of people were being baptized.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; How many remember that Wednesday night?
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Several regions of Judea and all of
[2:21:46] Judea heard John's baptism. They got
[2:21:49] baptized in water. And guess what? They
[2:21:51] had to be rebaptized again.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Why would God do such a thing as that?
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Because God's road is like this. We're
[2:21:59] traveling on the road and there's some
[2:22:00] turns you got to make and you need a
[2:22:02] prophet on those turns.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; Stay in the turn with the prophet.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Don't turn with Reverend so and so,
[2:22:09] pastor so and so. You stay on the path
[2:22:12] with the prophetic shepherd.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; That's where our food is. So, let's take
[2:22:18] this Luke here as we close. We started
[2:22:20] late, but we'll finish.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 2,
[2:22:26] verse 21. Look at this.
[2:22:29] this verse 20. And the shepherds
[2:22:31] returned glorifying, praising God for
[2:22:33] all the things that they had heard and
[2:22:36] seen, and it was told unto them. Let's
[2:22:39] get these shepherds a little deeper.
[2:22:41] They got something to say here in verse
[2:22:43] 15. Let's see what they say in verse 15.
[2:22:46] And it came to pass as the angels were
[2:22:48] going away from them into heaven, the
[2:22:51] shepherd said one to another, what they
[2:22:54] say? Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,
[2:22:59] and see the thing which has come to
[2:23:02] pass, which what? Read it with me. Which
[2:23:05] the
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; us
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; the what did what to you shepherds?
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Which the Lord has made known to us.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:16] The Lord's still making things known
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; to shepherds
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; and people that can't even read maybe.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; This is the beauty of a revelation.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; A revelation has nothing to do with your
[2:23:31] IQ or your intelligence.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; A revelation has nothing to do with how
[2:23:36] smart your parents are or how poor or
[2:23:39] how wealthy. But when a revelation
[2:23:42] comes, it's the most beautiful thing
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; that can happen to a believer.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; It's when God drops a revelation
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; to that believer.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the scripture here just
[2:23:59] for a moment. I have to close here
[2:24:03] in verse 21. And when eight days were
[2:24:06] accomplished for the circumcising of the
[2:24:09] child, his name was I his name was
[2:24:12] called Jesus, which was so named of the
[2:24:15] angel before he was conceived in the
[2:24:17] womb. And when the days of her
[2:24:19] purification according to the law of
[2:24:21] Moses were accomplished, they brought
[2:24:23] him to Jerusalem to present him to the
[2:24:26] Lord. Verse 23. altogether.
[2:24:30] As it is written in the law of the Lord,
[2:24:33] every male that open the womb shall be
[2:24:36] called holy to the Lord. Continue. And
[2:24:39] to offer a sacrifice according to that
[2:24:42] which is said in the law of the Lord, a
[2:24:45] pair of turtle doves or two young
[2:24:48] pigeons. And look at this in verse 25.
[2:24:52] And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem
[2:24:56] whose name was Simeon.
[2:24:58] And the same man was just and devout,
[2:25:01] waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[2:25:03] And the Holy Ghost was upon him.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; And it was revealed unto him,
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost
[2:25:12] that he should not see death
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; before he seen the Lord's Christ. And he
[2:25:18] came by what?
[2:25:21] Somebody brought him there.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody took him there.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; He came cuz somebody forced him to be
[2:25:26] there. He came by what every one of us
[2:25:31] should be coming to the house of the
[2:25:33] Lord by. Coming by the spirit.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; The spirit led me.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; The spirit brought me.
[2:25:43] The spirit of the Lord
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; moved upon that old brother
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; been revealed to him.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; He gets up from where he's at.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; No church document.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Nobody's there pushing or forcing him.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Same one that led him led Abel in the
[2:26:04] Garden of Eden
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; to offer the proper sacrifice by a
[2:26:10] revelation.
[2:26:13] Come on, somebody.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; He's led by the spirit,
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; came by the spirit,
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; entered the temple. When the parents
[2:26:28] brought him into the child to Jesus to
[2:26:31] do for him after the custom of the law,
[2:26:33] then took he up in his arms and blessed
[2:26:38] God and said like we did little David
[2:26:41] this morning. Amen.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, now let us thy servant depart in
[2:26:45] peace according to thy word. For my eyes
[2:26:49] have seen
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; thy salvation.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; A revelation. Let me close with this,
[2:26:56] saints. A revelation is personal.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; It's personal.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; You either got one or you don't. If you
[2:27:07] got one, you can stand alone.
[2:27:11] If you don't have one, you're following
[2:27:13] a group.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; But if you got a revelation and it comes
[2:27:18] from above,
[2:27:20] that is what the entire church is built
[2:27:23] upon.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; The spiritual revealed truth of the word
[2:27:27] of God. And this revelation is what
[2:27:30] we're feeding on.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; There's a quote where brother Banner
[2:27:33] says, "God never called the shepherds to
[2:27:35] educate his sheep, but to feed the
[2:27:38] sheep." Amen.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; And part of the message, yes, it's
[2:27:42] education. Yes, we read it. We read the
[2:27:43] quote. We read the scripture. But that
[2:27:45] scripture, that quote needs to become a
[2:27:48] revelation.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; And when it becomes a revelation,
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; it becomes food.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; And it's food that keeps you alive.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; God richly bless you.
[2:28:05] Amen.
[2:28:07] God
[2:28:09] richly bless you. Let us bow our heads a
[2:28:12] word of prayer.
[2:28:15] Hallelujah.
[2:28:18] Is there anyone here today that needs a
[2:28:20] revelation?
[2:28:21] Oh my.
[2:28:23] Did you know not not only is the church
[2:28:26] built upon it, every individual is built
[2:28:28] upon it, the entire Bible
[2:28:33] is built upon the revelation
[2:28:35] of Jesus Christ?
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Is there anyone here that needs a
[2:28:39] revelation?
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Or have you received all the revelation
[2:28:44] that you need?
[2:28:46] There's more revelation for you, my
[2:28:48] brother, my sister. There's a revelation
[2:28:50] for you. And when it's revealed to you,
[2:28:53] it's the hidden mana. It becomes food.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Food
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; down in your soul to give you that
[2:29:01] healthy diet that you need to overcome.
[2:29:04] Heavenly Father, thank you for the hands
[2:29:06] that are raised here this morning. I
[2:29:09] pray, oh God, that you would open up
[2:29:12] your word to each one from the little
[2:29:14] lambs
[2:29:16] to the bigger sheep. Lord, may each one
[2:29:19] refine find some pasture-raised grain
[2:29:26] food from that's alive
[2:29:29] for the sheep as my prayer.
[2:29:32] Oh God,
[2:29:33] forgive us where we have failed you,
[2:29:35] Lord.
[2:29:37] But establish us in this hidden mana.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Establish us, Lord, with the healthy di.
[2:29:43] establish our mind, our our bodies
[2:29:48] on the word of the Lord. It's my prayer.
[2:29:51] May you grant these blessings to each
[2:29:53] one. We love you, Father.
[2:29:56] Oh God, hear and answer our requests,
[2:30:00] our needs. I fed on the word of God and
[2:30:03] found out that you was a healer. I fed
[2:30:05] on the word of God one day and I found
[2:30:07] out you was a savior.
[2:30:09] I fed on the word and I found out you'll
[2:30:11] be a friend when I didn't have one. I
[2:30:15] fed on the word of God and I found out
[2:30:17] that you love me, Lord. Oh God, I just
[2:30:21] pray that you'll bless each one to move
[2:30:25] forward in Jesus name we pray.
[2:30:30] Amen.
[2:30:31] Amen. God bless you, brother John. Thank
[2:30:34] you.
[2:30:37] [Music]
[2:30:46] Amen.
[2:30:52] Amen. Maybe we could just stand together
[2:30:54] this morning.
[2:30:56] I was thinking of that of course. Fill
[2:30:59] my cup, Lord. Bread of heaven, feed me
[2:31:02] till I want no more.
[2:31:04] Just fill my cup,
[2:31:08] Lord.
[2:31:11] I lift it up,
[2:31:15] Lord.
[2:31:16] [Music]
[2:31:18] Come and quench
[2:31:23] this thirst in
[2:31:26] my soul.
[2:31:29] [Music]
[2:31:33] Bread of heaven,
[2:31:37] just feed me till
[2:31:41] I want
[2:31:45] no more.
[2:31:47] Here's my cup.
[2:31:52] Fill it up
[2:31:54] and make me whole.
[2:32:00] Sing it one more time. Just fill
[2:32:04] my cup,
[2:32:06] Lord.
[2:32:09] I lift it up,
[2:32:13] Lord.
[2:32:17] Come and quench
[2:32:22] this thirsting
[2:32:24] of my soul.
[2:32:29] Oh,
[2:32:32] bread off of heaven.
[2:32:37] Just feed me till I want
[2:32:44] no more.
[2:32:46] Here's my cup.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; Fill it up
[2:32:53] and make me whole.
[2:33:02] Amen. I wasn't able to pull it up, but
[2:33:03] just thinking this morning Ezekiel 34
[2:33:07] and maybe you could put up there. I
[2:33:09] think it was about verse 23. I'm not
[2:33:11] able to get connection on my on my iPad,
[2:33:14] but this was a
[2:33:16] chapter in the Bible that was an
[2:33:18] admonition to the shepherds of Israel.
[2:33:21] And it was a warning to those that
[2:33:25] didn't
[2:33:26] feed God's sheep, but also promises to
[2:33:29] the sheep. And so this is towards the
[2:33:33] end of the chapter, it starts. It says,
[2:33:35] "I will set up one shepherd over them,
[2:33:37] and he shall feed them. Even my servant
[2:33:39] David, he shall feed them, and he shall
[2:33:40] be their shepherd. And I, the Lord will
[2:33:43] be their God, and my servant David, a
[2:33:45] prince among them. I, the Lord, have
[2:33:47] spoken it. And I will make them a
[2:33:48] covenant of peace, and will cause the
[2:33:50] evil beast to cease out of the land, and
[2:33:52] they shall dwell safely in the
[2:33:54] wilderness, and sleep in the woods. And
[2:33:56] I'll make them, and the places round
[2:33:58] about my hill of blessing, and will
[2:34:00] cause the shower to come down in his
[2:34:02] season. There shall be showers of
[2:34:04] blessing. So, I am just so thankful for
[2:34:06] that. And I wanted to sing that song
[2:34:08] this morning. But just in context of
[2:34:10] there shall be showers of blessings.
[2:34:12] It's this fresh mana that we're getting
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; and pasture-raised food. There shall be
[2:34:19] showers of blessing.
[2:34:23] This is the promise of love.
[2:34:28] There shall be seasons refreshing
[2:34:33] sent from the Savior above.
[2:34:38] Showers
[2:34:40] of blessing.
[2:34:43] Showers of blessing we need.
[2:34:48] Mercy drops round us are falling.
[2:34:53] But for the showers we flee.
[2:34:58] There shall be showers of blessing.
[2:35:03] Precious reviving again. Over
[2:35:09] the hills and the valley,
[2:35:13] it's the sound of abundance of rain,
[2:35:18] showers
[2:35:20] of blessing,
[2:35:23] showers of blessing we need.
[2:35:28] Mercy drops round us are falling
[2:35:34] but for the showers we flee
[2:35:38] and there shall be showers of blessing
[2:35:44] send them upon us oh Lord
[2:35:49] grant to us now a refreshing
[2:35:54] come and now honor thy
[2:35:58] Yes. Showers
[2:36:01] of blessings.
[2:36:04] Showers of blessings we need.
[2:36:09] Mercy drops round us are falling.
[2:36:14] But for the showers we plead. The last
[2:36:18] verse. And there shall be showers of
[2:36:22] blessing.
[2:36:25] Oh that today they might fall.
[2:36:30] Now as to God we're confessing
[2:36:35] now as on Jesus we fall.
[2:36:40] Showers
[2:36:42] of blessing.
[2:36:45] Showers of blessings we need.
[2:36:49] [Music]
[2:36:50] Mercy drops around us are falling
[2:36:55] but for the shower. Listen to the words
[2:36:58] of this one. And there shall be showers
[2:37:02] of blessing

[2:43:25] Amen. And just was you're you're
[2:43:27] dismissed. We'll sing one song. But just
[2:43:29] thing I saw sister Barb right before
[2:43:31] service. And brother Chuck, we missed
[2:43:33] you, too. I know your wife was the only
[2:43:34] one that got was missed, but I I missed
[2:43:36] you. It's good to have you back. But I
[2:43:39] saw Sister Barb before service. She's
[2:43:41] walking out to the car and just so
[2:43:43] burdened for her natural brother,
[2:43:46] Brother Bobby. And I just thought, you
[2:43:48] know, we've got a spiritual family and
[2:43:50] we if if we could just have that same
[2:43:52] level of burden for those that are
[2:43:54] spiritually sick among us. And we heard
[2:43:56] brother Joe this morning asking us to
[2:43:58] remember his kids that are going off to
[2:44:00] camp. And it's just like if we just have
[2:44:02] that same burden for those that that
[2:44:04] that she has for her natural brother and
[2:44:07] and I know she does for for her
[2:44:08] spiritual family as well. I'm not I'm
[2:44:10] not saying that, but just to just it
[2:44:12] just tugged at my heartstrings this
[2:44:14] morning that we've got this wonderful
[2:44:16] family that God's given to us. And let's
[2:44:18] not just be concerned about the natural
[2:44:20] well-being, but about the spiritual
[2:44:22] well-being of our brothers and sisters.
[2:44:24] So, amen. You're dismissed. Let's sing
[2:44:26] that song as we go. He set me free. Once
[2:44:29] like a bird in prison, I dwelt. Key of
[2:44:32] F.
[2:44:35] Once like a bird in prison I dwelt. No
[2:44:40] freedom from my sorrow I fell.
[2:44:45] Then Jesus came and listened to me. And
[2:44:51] glory to God. Oh he set me free. Yes he
[2:44:57] set me free. Yes he set me free. Oh, he
[2:45:03] brought demons of prison for me. Well,
