shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all amen for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then good success how many want to be successful you know theyve written books 10 points on success seven steps to success but for for Joshua the success was to meditate on the word that I wasn't just reading it that was meditating on it not turning from it to the left or to the right and I have my title this morning is just kind of a odd title but it's Romans 7 Luke 23 and acts 5 that's my title and these are some of the last day prophecies that brother Bram brought to us Romans chapter 7 Luke 23 acts chap 5 so let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon the word this morning we thank you for the opportunity to read your word now Lord I pray you'll settle our nerves and our anxiety Lord Lord to hear you to speak what you have us to say and may each heart be blessed father there's no one like you there's nothing greater than your word and we're leaning and depending upon that this morning you have never failed you've never lost a battle and we have confidence in that today that you'll do exactly what you said you would do we claim these promises now in Jesus name we pray amen amen why don't you shake somebody's hand and tell them praise the Lord so good to be in the house of the Lord tell them we'll be shaking hands again a couple times during the service we'll look at one another and say praise the Lord God bless you you may be seated thank you God bless you doesn't that feel better when you warm up with one another yeah you was looking at me but now we shook hands so now we can warm up a little bit all right so God bless you amen Romans chapter 7 Luke 23 acts 5 now these um these scriptures I have brought them here to the church a number of times in different messages and as I was in uh Tanzania um some of the messages had come back to me and just really impressed upon my heart again and this last one here in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ is one of the most to me one of the more profound latterday messages that brother Brandon preached in uh November of 1965 he preaches this message as a Thanksgiving message so it's kind of uh preliminary Before Christmas it's kind of this time of the year it was a Thanksgiving message he wasn't in his own home pull pit so there's there's little background stories on that brother Palmer which was a deacon for brother Al sto his daddy was brother L Palmer who brother Ram speaks of on the tape there and there were some testimonies in the background where that brother uh Jack did not want he was going to councel brother R from preaching one or two of the services there um but he couldn't find his hotel room and you hear Brother bam talk about that they were supposed to pick him up for lunch but they couldn't find him they were going to try to shift him from taking that service is what I was told in the background brother Jack Moore did not fully embrace the message is what we could call embracing the message although he was a friend to the prophet and he opened the door to him in many many ways and so you'll hear brother brandham at the beginning of this series a tremendous series that he is um warning in the Brethren there not to take it personal but this message is growing across the land and it's not so much pointed to the local Ministry there he's very very careful brother brandham is about how he handles another man's Pulpit he's very very respectful in other territories and working amongst people he's always very gracious about the men that have gone on before him as you hear him talk um and I'm I'm quite sure if some men had the gifts that brother random had you probably couldn't even have lunch with them because of their attitude and with what power and pride does it it will lift you it will change you power will change you it's very addictive and you think you'll remain the same but you just soon as your little Financial thing changes a little bit soon as your friends change then people change it happens that way so it really takes the Lord Jesus Christ to keep you humble when he blesses you brother brandom says just as soon as God blesses a man he begins to think that he's an angel yes and as soon as you get blessed you're talented you're gifted you have whatever is going good for you you start to think it's you and that's a human flaw it's not about you know what what group what race what country that's a human flaw and this is why we have to stay on our knees amen everybody if the Apostle Paul was sent a messenger to keep him humble because of the revelations what about you or I what do you think you think receiving this message there's a a chance that we can think ourselves above someone else sure so Lord help us so but this this tremendous series that brother Brandon brings and I'll just take the last uh I'll take 1965 sermons that he preached okay so in November 21st he preach right here in the City of Tucson what house will you build me and we're going to quote out of that scripture out of that message there I think they have a quotation out of there then he goes to uh uh shreport and he preaches on the 25th the invisible Union of the bride of Christ the 26th works is Faith Express the next day he preaches on the 27th trying to do God's service without it being his will that evening he preaches I have heard but now I see um on the 28th in that same series there God's only provided place of worship these are are some tremendous messages you can go and hear them and one kind of overlaps into the other one you can kind of get a theme or thought of what the prophet had in his mind because you never really finish a message you you have your notes Here you never really finish it'll kind of bleed over into the next sermon if you follow the prophet's messages then he preaches that powerful message 1965 on the wings of a snow white dove now in December the 4th he preaches the message Rapture and then the message things that are to be modern events made clear by prophecy and then the last message that he preaches right here in our city uh communion now when he takes the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he takes Romans chapter 7 and he opens that scripture to us now you can quote a lot of people let me say this I quote from the prophet because I know what the revelation of who he is to me is that's what that's I don't quote from the prophet because more people would come to this church uh that's my Revelation if more people come if less people come the Revelation is for me to to preach what God placed upon my heart I know some people they'll include a tape service because that might include more people coming to their church or they might put the pictures up or take them down based on whether who's going to come to their church or not come to their church but um trust you want to follow a revelation and you do what you do by a revelation and whoever comes they come whoever stay whoever go that is what it is amen and so this Romans chapter 7 I can't handle Romans chapter 7 any other way than the way the prophet has brought it to us now that he has opened it up to us and this is what he says about Romans chapter 7 in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ first he says this in paragraph 22 he says now we are looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation I am not looking for Revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation now in Romans 7 trusting that you have your Bibles open everywhere now across a country we want you to read closely now this message out of here it seems like it's on marriage and divorce but it really isn't to me it's a prophecy for the church in the last days now uh Romans chapter 7 he's pretty much dealing with verses 1-6 is talking about that you know that Brethren how that the law haveth dominion over a man as long as he liveth and for the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if that husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband sounds like the Apostle Paul is talking about marriage and divorce and he is in one sense and he's talking about the law of the Old Testament law and he's bringing it over and he's talking talking about being married and being divorced and then the adultery and brother random now takes this scripture and says that he believes that it is a prophecy for the church in the last day now if it is a prophecy for the church then I'm interested in it because I am a part of that church um some people are interested in the next president that's coming up or the politics that's going on or the next Blockbuster movie or are taxes going to go up or what's the best way to live the best newest diet but as a Believer our Interest really should be on the things that pertain to the coming of the Lord and the Readiness of his church because we have been given a word of Prophecy not just you know just that one statement that he says there and where he says we're not looking for Revival in our generation we're looking for the coming of the Lord in our gener how many denominations are looking for a Revival today they're praying for one they're thinking there's a great move coming yet there not too late for America we could still have a a worldwide Revival and we know that's not going to happen Elijah said it's not going to rain for three years guess what it did not rain for 3 years because Elijah called for the rain when when he said it would come it came when he said it would stop it would stop that was the ministry of Elijah and so just that little thought right there we people who follow the message we're people we're prophetic people so we we take the warning of the Lord today so It prepares us for tomorrow and we're not waiting to see okay let me see what's going to happen next no the word has already been given to us to prepare our hearts for what's going to happen next so there's nothing coming out of Washington that's going to shock any of us amen they all lost their minds and they're not going to get their minds back they're not going to somehow repent we know this and so when we hear the craziness yes it hurts us but it doesn't shock us we know which way this is going it's going downward and it's not going to get better amen but for the believer there is the coming of the Lord for the believer there never was an age like this age and I want to I want to embrace that I want to take that in into my heart as a prophecy so he he he he shares with us that Romans chapter 7 is a prophecy of the church in the last days I would behoove you to read that pray read it slowly consecrate your heart read it again go back read it again and let the Lord bless you in that so later in the message he brings us this prophecy in Luke chap 23 and this is speaking of the day he picks up what Jesus said in Luke chapter 23 how the the great company that followed him and they begin to whail him and um Jesus turning unto them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children foro for behold the days are coming so he's speaking of a future event can I get a witness today speaking of the days are coming Jesus pointed to the Future the days are coming that they shall say blessed are the barren in the womb that never bear and the pths which never gave suck it sounds like a natural you know Jesus just a natural which it is he's speaking of birth control he's speaking of birth control and brother Ram talks about it and he crosses it over that day would come with that would be so prevalent that they would take a dog or a cat or some little animal but they didn't want to be pampering a newborn baby they didn't want a baby and this was a prophecy that Jesus is giving to us per the brother random says here in paragraph 120 says think today a disgrace for her to have a child see then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and the hills cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall they do in a dry speaking of the day when women wouldn't no more want children they want a dog or a cat or something like that but she don't want children anymore why she's old mother hubber see she has the child that's the remarks of Hollywood they don't want it don't want its woman to be an old mother hubber so she'll have some operation performed on himself or her one that'll keep them from having children they don't want no children Jesus spoke of it what did he say at that time they'll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on us see they're losing their minds and that's the age that we live in great tremendous age of this um women not wanting to have children that's one thing if you can't have or some reason why you can't but then to actually not to want to have children so this this quote I read for you many many times we've heard it many many times I read it in Tanzania many many times my last a flight coming home was from Atlanta to Tucson it's a straight flight beautiful flight just a direct no stops three and a half hours something like that and we got we got ready to board and leave and this little baby start crying I mean it wasn't like this little baby crying it was like wailing it was so deafening that everybody just got quiet I put my head sets my noise cancels on and this baby was so loud it's not like a laptop you can't turn it off that baby was on and the oh it had it captured the whole airplane and so one lady sitting next to me she looked at me she says well we ain't getting no sleep on this flight and I says well you're not but I got my headsets on so I was kind of teasing her she said yeah go ahead tease and so we were just joking and the next lady sitting next to me she was a mother and she was like well we know how this goes he'll get tired and then the baby will go finally go to sleep yeah we'll we get over it well there was a young teenage girl probably in her 20s maybe 30s American obviously she couldn't take it so she started cursing and swearing at the situation and so the um the flight attendants got up to you know see what was going cuz she's cursing out loud and started to direct this towards the parent and um so they warned her to stop and she wouldn't stop so they stopped our flight we were already taxing turned that plane around and kicked her off the plane proceeded to kick her off the plane and so while while all that's going on they're going back and forth the baby goes quiet and goes to sleep and then they kick this girl off and she starts crying so the baby stops crying and the girl getting kicked off starts crying you tell me what that's about I but that's what babies do yes they're not electronic they're not they're human beings and that that's probably the most complicated species in the universe is a human being you can't and there's other babies on the flight you say well be like the other babies some of the other babies were quiet but not this one and that's how human beings are and this is where uh uh brother brownon is giving this illustration and pulling it out of the scripture where Jesus said don't weep for me but the days are coming where they wouldn't want babies or children in their church and you take that spiritual application many many mature believers who have come through into the Holy Ghost wants to leave the service early and cancel the altar service because that's where the babies have to be born through that takes patience it takes time it's a sacrifice but somebody needs to be there Hallelujah to Foster the atmosphere so another son or daughter can be born into the kingdom of God it might be my brother it might be your sister hallelujah amen amen that's right is it worth it yes is it something the church should be as their focus as their goal yes not the music program not how well we sound not filling the pews but filling the altar with babies being born into the kingdom of God and many people won't even move a finger Soul come to the won't pray won't move a finger look at their clock ready to go eat lunch amen it's a problem so Lord help us amen amen it's a prophecy they don't want those blabbering babies brother brandom goes forward and says this is a true picture of the modern church today neither do they want the modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young around her yeah she don't want any of them hooping crying screaming and why such a child would immediately put her out of her denom mintion they had one like that in one of the churches why they throw her out quick why are you letting such as this go along so you see she's pregnated with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her you how many how many of our message churches today let's just say in this state I won't pick on our city let's just say this state it if a if a child will be born like acts 238 in their service it would interrupt their service it would bother them I'm talking about mature I'm talking about people who know this message who's read the Seven Seals in the church A's book I'm not talking about people who don't know I'm talking about people who supposed to be armor bearers of the word holding up the light they are the ones give your heart time God have mercy upon us but I don't want to be a part of that Saints I really don't I got to be by myself I don't want to be a part of that no no no no no no you got to change the diaper change that diaper how many's never changed a diaper before let me see your hand never changed never change a diaper check yeah we need to work on some of y'all yeah yeah yeah they don't want to raise their hand but we can see it on your face you never change no diaper yes it's an experience yes paragraph 132 they're pregnated with son something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time they don't want the acts 238 babies they they want they want nice fine members Brother Scott that's already went through that stage and they're well they're nice tithe payers they come to church they sit quiet and they could just add no problems that's the members we want let them you know they go through all of those stages and work out all their drug problems and their backslidings and they're messing around we got to pray them through through go bail them out of jail and go pick them up and this and that and then pray through and pray through and then finally they get an experience and then God deals with them and delivers them now all the churches wants that believer but you can't get that believer if he ain't a baby first instead of taking the member all the way up through the rearing and the child training up to adulthood we want to proelite some adult members huh yeah that's what they want to do yeah yes sir but they don't want the altar open they take it out of the church so they don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth so that's speaking of a day Jesus spoke of it the prophet picks it up and he speaks of it now this last prophecy that was Romans 7 that was Luke 23 let's take this last prophecy here in Acts chap 5 and then we will move on to what Joshua is now brother random in the message the token I'm sorry in communion the last message he preached paragraph uh number uh 59 he preached the just under an hour I believe on the message communion right here in Tucson last recorded sermon on the tape I thank God it is recorded cuz these quotes become my quotes now and uh somebody can say Brothers we we don't do that we don't handle the word that way we don't do that way well just show me the quotations that we don't handle it that way show me where the Prophet didn't preach it that way amen and so our Liberty is in the word I'm free to believe whatever is in this word and whatever is in the message I'm free to go take that amen and I don't want to be limited by somebody else's unbelief or what they can't see or what they believe and what they their hangup is I already have my own hangups I don't need to adopt anybody else's hangups my Liberties comes from the word of the Lord and for the rest of my life that's what I'm determined to go after what the word of the Lord has for me that is my goal my goal is the WRA the body change I want to get up out of here I'm not here to make more friends or or be up you know be upset or make myself a great I want to make the Rapture I want to get out of here amen I want to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant that's what I want to hear from him amen and brother random tells us in paragraph 59 how many believe like that how many want to hear from him to say Well done good and faithful servant amen that's all that matters paragraph 59 in the message communion the prophet says s that's the trouble of us today what I think I'm saying us me and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours that we're believe that we believe we're living in the closing time we believe that God has G us a message it's been ordained of God it's been proven of God it's been showed of God now we must come to him with reverence and with love with purity of heart mind and soul you know the hour will soon arise when right Among Us the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananas and Safar remember see that hour is is arriving see and now you just remember that see that God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now now who said that brother random said that when did he say that 1965 December the 12th all right and so what did he mean what he said is it true or is it false you got to you got to process that does that apply to us or not was he just saying that just to be saying it and if he's just saying it just to be saying it what else did he just say just to be saying and if that doesn't apply today what else doesn't apply today you see I have to handle this word some kind of way I have to approach it some kind of way before the Lord before the Lord as I'm handl it I have got to approach it in a way honest ly with my heart as as I would present it to other people and I've got to process that in order to be honest with myself with what I'm reading what is in the word and whoever I'm talking to now if I'm going to play games I can play games but if I really want to be serious I have to say well did he say it or did he not say it I don't care what the vision is I don't care what the statement is if I'm following this message I have to really process did he really say that and if he said it is it really true and if it is really true am I responsible for it and if I am responsible for it then it's worth me living the rest of my life trying to let God by his grace to let me live that word that I'm hearing amen Lord amen amen so this is one of those quotes where you know we we can brush it off we could take it out we can say no it didn't mean that we you know that was you know that was under the second pool but you can't do that with this quote here you can't say this was the second pool here can't say he was you know just saying that to visitors no no no no no no he said the hour is approaching what hour Acts chapter 5 let's turn there quickly now this is the story of ananas and safire all right said brother isra we heard this before yes we need to hear it again it's the word of the Lord and it had a it had a it had a result that happened because of it it wasn't just a nothing it was really a something and and in Acts chapter 5 we'll see that ananas and survived they sold a certain portion they agreed to tell this portion to Peter just one of the brothers you know we know Peter he even has his own faults so we can tell him whatever verse eight and Peter answered her and tell me whether you sold the land for so much and she said yes for so much now they had already buried her husband he lied they buried him and then when she comes Peter didn't say now look sis your husband just lied and the Holy Spirit no Peter didn't do that Peter just asked her the same question and he offered this to her and she said yes for so much verse n then Peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out then fell she straight down straight away then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost brother Brandon said it was a heart attack that's what he said and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband look at verse 11 and great fear came Came Upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things now you'll see this great fear coming again if you can turn there quickly to Acts chapter 19 quickly in verse number 13 the same time you know these Jews they wanted to cast out Devils they were imitating Paul and um verse we'll pick it up from verse 14 and there were seven sons of onekea a Jew chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are ye and the man whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out that house naked and wounded and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and what happened fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord was magnified and many that believe came and confessed and showed their deeds and many of them also which used curious art brought their books together burned them before all men and they counted the price of them found 50,000 pieces of silver so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed so this Acts chapter five brother bandam highlights this out of the books of book of Acts and he says that that day is coming again and let me ask you the question now ananas and safire didn't lie on somebody it wasn't adultery it wasn't fornication it didn't steal from anyone there was no crime that they committed against another believer it was just a lie between a husband and wife and they agreed to to do this lie and tell this and it was it was like a cheap lie or it was a lie that really I mean it wasn't even about the amount really when you examine what was going on you know if you sold it for 10 or if you sold it for 20 that would have been the price you sold it for right and that's what you're were going to give somebody else sold whatever whatever whatever but it was the lie that they told and let me ask you amongst the Church Believers there's 3,000 that were just added to the church new converts do you think there were any other believers that maybe told a lie that week or they were the only ones that lied but you see the lord caught their lie and when this was heard that this had been done that's what caused the Great fear to come upon everyone else now I'm sure and I've heard of people and folks doing things that were far worse than what ananas and Safara did here amen and they've done worse and even come and taking communion they have done worse and even come and taking the pull pit huh so here here is the prophet of God now in the spirit now he's at the last of his ministry closing in his tape Ministry is now that hour is s will soon arise when ananas and saf will be dwelt among among us again so you take the example with ananas and Safar what really did they do that was wrong that hurt anyone and so great fear Came Upon all the people all of them that heard this um this is the church that's coming in the future this is what the word of the Lord is producing in the hearts of Believers today a church that is that that that where sin can't enter into the building and I don't know how many of us really want that how many of us are really ready for that or do you want to go to a church or go to a place where they're just put up with you and not mention the sin I mean it's far it's far I mean it's easier for someone to mention your sin and embarrass you but then to pack you out dead and we and we get criticize and we get the side eye from even preaching against sin what about being struck yeah because of this unbelief like this here and this is the coming Church um there's no other age like this is the greatest of all the ages and this is one of the prophecies to come so now This Book of Joshua types the Believers today and this types the last day the end time um the end time messenger the Holy Spirit and the um the True Believer the messenger the Holy Spirit and the True Believer so now brother brandom takes the message the spoken word is the Original Seed and he brings this to us here paragraph number 88 oh 808 sorry and the prophet now is being called into the spirit he preaches this in spoken words The Original Seed remember that portion where the Holy Spirit tells him to pick up his pen and right and then he also uh uh rehearses that again in the church age book and I know some people have a problem with the church age book but brother bam said it was my book he says that and and the church age book came and was finally printed after the seals had been preached so there's other things that was included in the church AE book you can fight you run whatever you want to I'm going to take what the prophet said about the church a book that's me personally and I can take what Reverend so and so said and this one I heard said and this one heard says but on the tape that's right he already told us what the church age book was you could take a private testimony and maybe that's what God called you to take is a private testimony I'm going to take the testimony that's recorded on the tape teaching God bless you amen all right so here he says now let us stand let us stand like Joshua in Caleb how many's interested in that who is Joshua and Caleb now watch close he says this is going to have a spiritual background now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua and Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua God started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so so did the last day Church notice how God did not move Israel until his own appointed time now listen this is going to mean something Joshua waited for that time no how matter no ma no much people people might have said God gave us the land the promise let us go now and take it they might have said Joshua you lost your commission you're all washed up why you're not doing something you used to to do no thus sayith the Lord in a moment and what was the will of God but this wise God sent Pro but but this wise God sent Prophet knew the promise of God but also knew to wait for that promise a clearcut decision from God for his time see these Parables now watch when the time come God gave it to Joshua who would stay with him by the word for he could not trust others he could trust him so will it repeat so here in this quotation here 1962 brother mam tells us that Joshua is a type of the end time leader and he also tell us that Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua can somebody say Amen now in the message the adoption he types Joshua as the Holy Spirit and also in the message blind bardus 1960 he types it as the holy spirit let me read those two for you here so I can just give you the clear uh you know know a balance of of what the prophet said about it all right paragraph 114 and adoption Moses being a type of Christ led the children up to the promised land then Moses did not take the children in the promised land Joshua took the people in and divided up the land Jesus Paid the price LED them up to the Holy Spirit God sent the Holy Spirit down and he positionally put the church in order each man filling him with the presence of his being see what I mean all in Christ Jesus how God predestinated this to the to the calling of this gospel so there Joshua is typed as a holy spirit let's take this message blind Bemus 1960 paragraph 163 the prophet of God says this here Joshua the Great Mighty Warrior who took Moses's place a type of the Holy Spirit now taking see Moses didn't bring the children into the promised land he was a lawgiver but he didn't bring the children into the promised land Joshua took them over see and the Holy Spirit is the one that takes them over now Christ made the way and the plans was The Giver of the law and so forth but the Holy Spirit takes the church to the promised land the Rapture taking it up the Holy Spirit In The Rapture how many can say Amen to that so it's the holy spirit that takes you into the promised land and devise the land so what was the Book of Joshua the Book of Joshua was about the real estate it was about land ownership the book of Joshua is about property was it about a promise that God had given Israel to divide the land now these Patriarchs were determined and and um they were um separated through Jacob through through their two his two wives and then the midwives that were associated with those two wives and there was a great stress in bringing those women the stress that they had in bringing forth those children in the labor pains and brother bam tells us it was by inspiration that those Hebrew mothers named those boys Reuben and Gad and Dan and and the different names that they were called they were it was a stress behind them and that stress was Rachel and Leah it was you know uh Rachel had Jacob's heart Leah was fertile and had Jacob's children and they would they were conflict these two sisters were conflict between uh the love and through you know having children with with Jacob it was a stressful thing and brother Brandon brings that out in a number of messages but he brings it out in the message the adoption and he says this in paragraph 48 in the message adoption number one and so this that just gives you a background of what's going on in the Book of Joshua and so now notice this Burns our hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study if we could only go into in details which would take hours after hours some days when we get our church Church fix I like to come and take a solid month or two and just stay right in it watch when each of those mothers when she called out Ephraim when she was in labor positionally placed him where his feet was setting in oil just exactly every one of them wherever they were at and Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after being in the promised land give each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there how that God has set some in the church through what through the labor pain you see through the birth oh they get tremendous sometime let me say this you don't want a minister in your church that hasn't been born again that's right you don't want a song leader that hasn't been born again trustee or Deacon or board that doesn't know what the new birth is right if you have been born again you'll have a burden for somebody else being born again I guarantee you that you'll be interested in it yes yes you're not a hireling there's no price no you'll stay with the you'll stay with that original burden and those labor pains they get tremendous sometimes he talks about how a church in its labor pains what is this church labor laboring for what are the labor pains of this church here you tell me what are the labor pains in your heart Saint you sitting in the pews there what's the burden in your heart is it applied to a scripture or a quote or is it some burden out here in the world or something what's causing your burning what's what's burning your heart what's driving you what do you really want in your life is it connected to the scriptures is it connected to the quotations or is it something out here some worldly Affair labor pains oh how the church should be in labor pains today amen they go how that how that God had set some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous sometime when a church is groaning under persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains when was the last time it don't have to be in this church it can be in your closet it could be wherever when was the last time you groan in the spirit for something in the word to be fulfilled in your life cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally born in the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set some in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists then he give in there speaking with tongues interpretation of Tong knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles now this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but don't do that he says so he deals with these labor pains can I take a few more moments all right yes these labor pains so let's stand like Joshua and CBA if you take the Book of Joshua and I just did went through it again I'm gonna go through it again here where Joshua in many cases they would they would cast lots before the Lord he would bring the elders and then he would bring the priest and they would stand at the door of the Tabernacle and it would cast lots before the Lord as he was making making the decision on placing whatever family whatever group needs to get placed and then it got to one place I think it was seven families that never received their inheritance yet and Joshua kind of got on them he said like how long will you all be here and not go possess the land it's like seven seven of you families have not taken the land that God gave you amen right how long you going to be here and not go possess your land what do you really want that's good what's in your heart what do you really desire I'm talking about scripture and quote connected desire I'm not talking about any other desire I'm talking about something connected with scripture something connected in this word that you're laboring for what do you really want am amen what do you desire Lord help me to align my desires with your word amen amen amen so let's stand like Joshua and Caleb let's look at Caleb just for a moment as I close here we got time for one in Joshua chapter 14 let's look at Caleb just for a minute Chapter 14 verse number six see if I can find it here quickly verse six then the children of Judah which Caleb was the tribe of came to Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of jeffa the kenite said unto him thou knowest that the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cades Baria 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from kades barnea to aspy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my Brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly follow the Lord my God isn't that nice amen isn't that a beautiful testimony to have man and Moses swear that day saying surely the land wearing thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy childr forever because thou H has wholly followed the Lord my God now now behold the Lord hath kept me alive and he has said these 40 and what happened to the brothers that went with him they're about his same age they were leaders of the tribe but they're dead but not Caleb's Not Dead the Bible says the Lord you kept me alive it was 40 years ago I was ready and it's 40 years later and I'm still ready to go take the land that you promised me and the strength I had then is the strength I got right now let me take my Mountain God has showed me Grace it's Giants on the mountain but let me go get my mountain that is what the holy spirit will lead any Caleb to do he'll find the promises in God's word and they're connected in the word of the Lord and that becomes a labor to that man or that woman and he'll make it happen in his life amen and there's others that'll just hang around and kick it around but not Caleb how many wants to be a Caleb today give me that mountain give me my Mountain yes sir amen I'm ready to go out to go out and come back in Man of where I'm 80 years old now I was 40 seemed like I could have got a gun done back then but I'm 80 but age is just a number strength comes from the Lord huh amen if the Lord anoints you strength comes from the Lord amen I'm ready to go you know Caleb wasn't asking for no help either give me my now when you can take this scripture in uh uh what do we read there Joshua what 14 yes amen 146 and you internalize that scripture for you the believer today and the prophet said let us stand like Caleb Dan can you see your approach to the word huh can you see your approach to the word now can you pick up the sword and go get those promises that God gave to you he gave them to everybody but not every everybody's going to take it I've given you the land now go possess it I've given it to you now you go out there on Saturday and get the rake and the wheelbarrow and move them cactuses and stuff like we did yesterday right he gave us the land but now you got to go dress it up you go clean it up you go take the land he gave us the scripture he gave us this message now you go take the land and this is just one portion of these three great prophecies that apply to the Church of the last days don't you love him am God bless you richly I'm not done but I'll close here okay now in Africa they would have told me to keep going Hallelujah but somebody said we ain't in Africa God bless you oh I know you very well God bless you if the musicians will come Lord
