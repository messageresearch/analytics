[44:44] of times in that uh in that book there
[44:47] in uh verse number six he says wherefore
[44:51] I put thee in remembrance that thou stir
[44:54] up the gift of God which is in thee by
[44:58] the putting on of my hands for God hath

[45:05] power and of love and of a sound mind
[45:10] amen the spirit of
[45:12] fear um doesn't belong in my mind God
[45:15] has given me a sound mind to believe his
[45:18] word in John 3 verses 1 and
[45:23] two or verses two
[45:27] John 3 the
[45:31] little smaller John's there says

[45:41] even as thy Soul Prosper amen we thank
[45:46] God for the reading of the word you know
[45:48] while I have you standing let's take one
[45:50] Old Testament scripture I think I have
[45:52] it's in
[45:53] judges or Numbers chapter 32
[46:01] yes
[46:08] Numbers chapter 32 quickly right see
[46:12] what that
[46:25] is yes
[46:32] talking about this spirit of
[46:34] fear and how it encourages and
[46:40] discourages verse number
[46:45] six you have that you say Amen Moses
[46:50] said unto the children of GAD and the
[46:53] children of ribbon shall your brethren
[46:55] go to war and shall ye sit
[46:58] here and wherefore discourage you the
[47:02] heart of the children of Israel from
[47:04] going over into the land which the Lord
[47:07] hath given them thus did your fathers
[47:10] when I sent them from Kadesh barnea to
[47:13] see the land for when they were up unto
[47:16] the valley of eshkol and saw the land
[47:19] they discouraged the heart of the
[47:21] children of Israel that they should not
[47:24] go into the land which the Lord hath
[47:28] given them amen let us pray father we
[47:31] thank you for your word tonight ask your
[47:34] blessings to come upon us anoint us with
[47:37] your Holy Spirit Lord we always desire a
[47:41] double portion of your spirit father
[47:44] every day every hour that we're here we
[47:47] want to magnify your name and we need
[47:50] the holy the Holy Ghost to do that and
[47:52] you grant that we pray in Jesus name
[47:55] amen amen amen God bless you you may be
[47:57] seated tonight praise the lord it's
[48:00] always good to see those come out Sunday
[48:02] night Wednesday night and Sunday morning
[48:05] that's our gathering times those are the
[48:07] meeting times we choose to come together
[48:10] I read that scripture in the Old
[48:12] Testament because here is Dan and
[48:16] Gad um they're part of the tribes of
[48:19] Israel and as they're crossing over to
[48:23] the promised land before they get to
[48:24] Jordan before they cross over over and
[48:27] actually take their inheritance they
[48:29] approached Moses with a personal request
[48:32] and they weren't they were not
[48:34] disrespectful they just simply realized
[48:37] that they were Cattlemen and they had
[48:39] lots and lots of cattle and this area of
[48:44] land that they were coming through was
[48:47] very very good for their
[48:49] cattle so they approached Moses and they
[48:51] said
[48:53] Moses um if we have found favor in your
[48:56] sight you got got to read the chapter
[48:58] and see the context that they come in if
[49:00] we have found favor in your sight we
[49:02] won't go with Israel to fight those
[49:04] battles for their inheritance we'll stay
[49:07] here and we'll be satisfied with our
[49:10] inheritance here on this side of Jordan
[49:13] and you know that upset Moses and he
[49:15] warned them and what Moses did is he
[49:19] equated their
[49:21] request on the same level with the spies
[49:24] that came back with an evil report
[49:27] and I want you to catch this because
[49:30] fear and our power to influence is so
[49:33] tremendous our actions and so what Moses
[49:36] said when if you if you stay back and
[49:40] you decide to stay back that's going to
[49:43] discourage the rest of us that are going
[49:45] to fight that's right and you're not
[49:47] even saying anything hurtful you're not
[49:50] saying the land is not there you're not
[49:52] saying it's true you just refrain to go
[49:57] and fight with us to get our property
[50:00] you know there are things that we have
[50:02] to push ourselves through and fight
[50:04] through even though we don't want to
[50:06] because the big picture is this this is
[50:09] in sight and if you know I've got a
[50:12] cancel a ball game or cancel meeting
[50:16] with someone for political Rally or
[50:19] something like that okay fine but
[50:22] but but the things of the Lord are the
[50:25] most important
[50:28] and these are the things we want to keep
[50:30] in our focus at all
[50:33] times and um our children follow us they
[50:38] watch
[50:39] us if we are studying and in the word
[50:42] and taking it in they can see that they
[50:45] can see us when we check out because I
[50:47] can see it you can see when I'm checking
[50:49] out if you're talking to me and we're
[50:51] talking like this and I start picking up
[50:53] my phone and start looking and looking
[50:55] outside and looking over here you're
[50:57] like well brother Israel I'm talking to
[50:58] you well I'm I'm right here but I really
[51:01] don't have your attention my eyes see
[51:04] you your eyes see me and our little ones
[51:07] see
[51:09] that and um this uh this this warning
[51:14] was to them thank the Lord they heeded
[51:17] the warning they say you know what no we
[51:19] don't want to be associated with those
[51:22] that pumped fear into all of Israel and
[51:25] let's let's just look at that just for a
[51:27] moment Israel leaves out of Egypt they
[51:30] come through the land fighting the we
[51:32] all brothers were cousins nephews we're
[51:36] all related we're not mixed with other
[51:38] nations we're all Israelites we have the
[51:41] same burdens have the same trauma
[51:44] troubles and but God has been good to us
[51:48] he delivers us with the mighty hand
[51:51] there is a pillar of fire and every
[51:54] night we can see it out there there is a
[51:57] pillar of cloud he's given us the laws
[52:00] he's given us all these things and here
[52:03] we come to the promised land and these
[52:05] Representatives go over to spy out the
[52:08] land and in spying out the land they
[52:11] come back with a
[52:13] report now we can all go we couldn't all
[52:16] go all of Israel couldn't go it wasn't
[52:19] designed for them to go but the Lord
[52:21] sent
[52:24] influencers he sent represent
[52:27] atives he sent people who had a word to
[52:30] go see with their own eyes and come back
[52:33] and tell us what you see they were
[52:35] reporters but they came and their report
[52:38] was brother Chris fake
[52:44] news it was fake news what made it fake
[52:47] because the word of the Lord told us we
[52:50] can take this land the Lord told us that
[52:54] and in their news and getting the word
[52:56] out there and then one family heard it
[52:59] and the next family heard it and then
[53:01] the next group until the entire
[53:04] congregation
[53:06] decided to go with the news that these
[53:09] gentlemen these men had spoke Joshua
[53:13] Caleb and Moses tried to steer them away
[53:16] they couldn't do it and so this fear is
[53:21] contagious it's dangerous it's
[53:24] detrimental anything that is going to
[53:27] take you away from your faith I would
[53:29] check that in the box of getting it out
[53:32] of your life anything that's hindering
[53:34] your faith if it's bothering you if it's
[53:37] causing a question in your life get it
[53:39] out of your life don't ask me don't ask
[53:41] someone else if it's causing a question
[53:43] in your faith between you and God get it
[53:46] out of your life and maybe later if it's
[53:49] something the Lord will introduce back
[53:51] to you you let him do that but don't
[53:54] don't fight
[53:57] within yourself with something that's
[53:59] hindering your faith so we we stopped
[54:02] here in this message uh this morning on
[54:05] enticing spirits and brother banam says
[54:08] this about the fourth dimension that
[54:10] every disease is from the fourth
[54:13] dimension he says it in paragraph number
[54:16] 40 he says just recently even cancer has
[54:19] been declared a fourth dimension disease
[54:22] that it's in another dimension sure it's
[54:27] demonology every disease is a fourth
[54:30] dimension disease the beginning of it
[54:33] now but now cancer in the body or cancer
[54:37] in the soul the demon can come in either
[54:40] place there's many times many people
[54:43] with good thoughts good people who try
[54:46] many times to rest upon some little
[54:49] theology they have or something they
[54:51] have been taught since a child and still
[54:53] they find that down in their being down
[54:55] in their soul
[54:57] they still have something that's not
[54:59] right you many are here this morning no
[55:02] doubt whether you where wherever you
[55:05] find Christians gathered together you
[55:06] find people who has those Spirits in
[55:09] them it's
[55:11] undesirable they don't want them they
[55:14] say oh if I can only quit lying if I can
[55:17] only quit lusting if I can only quit
[55:20] this or that how many can say Amen how
[55:23] many know what the prophet is talking
[55:24] about now that is devil
[55:27] and now they come in the form of
[55:29] religion many time being it's Sunday
[55:32] school it's a time of teaching so let's
[55:34] look into this now they come in the form
[55:38] of religion many times so brother bam
[55:41] and we're going to get back into that
[55:43] message because he gives us an answer on
[55:45] how to
[55:46] overcome that and how to deal with that
[55:49] and as we've been talking with you
[55:51] Saints about the three ringed man
[55:57] a three ring Circle that how the prophet
[56:00] talked about that I don't know if we
[56:01] have an image of that we don't or do we
[56:05] yeah thank you and there's so our our
[56:09] soul our spirit and our body
[56:15] now we don't separate those they they're
[56:18] they're separate because they do
[56:19] separate things but they work
[56:24] interchangeably and um
[56:27] what the Lord wants to do is heal every
[56:31] level of the human being of the human
[56:33] heart he wants to heal your heart he
[56:36] wants to heal the way you process things
[56:38] the way you think about other people the
[56:40] way you think about yourself the way you
[56:43] think your attitude that inner Spirit he
[56:48] wants to heal that he wants to get his
[56:51] hands on that there and um your body
[56:55] your spirit in your soul and so brother
[56:57] manam goes into the message enticing
[57:00] spirits and he deals with the human
[57:02] being and he said that the FBI they use
[57:06] this with the lie detector test this is
[57:09] what it's working on he says you are
[57:11] made in the image of God you're not even
[57:14] though you're Fallen you're a sinner
[57:16] inside of you your conscience knows when
[57:19] you're telling a lie and brother random
[57:21] says you were not made to tell a lie
[57:26] sinner or Saint whoever you are a human
[57:28] being he has that conscience in there
[57:31] he's not made to tell a lie and so when
[57:33] he tells a lie there's a reaction that
[57:35] takes place they're able to document
[57:38] this and they call it the lie detector
[57:40] test so brother branam brings that in
[57:43] and and this just is a is just a visual
[57:45] to show you Soul spirit and your
[57:49] body and he takes the message faith is
[57:53] the six sense preached it in 19 60 you
[57:57] all going to pray with me just for a
[57:59] moment and he says this in paragraph
[58:01] number
[58:04] one he says now these senses was given
[58:07] to you to only to contact your Earthly
[58:10] home that you might see taste feel smell
[58:13] and hear but there're by no means to
[58:15] lead you and now many times what if I
[58:19] refuse to look anymore and I just bind
[58:23] my eyes and say I refuse to look all
[58:25] right my my eyes can't serve me no more
[58:29] I'll finally go I'll go blind and then
[58:32] when my Boy comes on I'll tie his eyes
[58:35] up and say no sir there's no such a
[58:37] thing as sight I'll just tie his eyes up
[58:39] don't let him see he said my father told
[58:42] me there's no such a thing as sight so
[58:44] I'll tie up my boy's eyes well the first
[58:47] thing you know our generation would be
[58:49] born
[58:50] blind that's right if you don't use your
[58:54] six senses they become dormant they
[58:57] won't act at all what do they call that
[58:59] when you lay up in the bed and you you
[59:01] don't use your muscles atrophy atrophy
[59:04] you're not using them they're there the
[59:06] same muscles are there the same you is
[59:08] there but if you're not using them you
[59:10] begin to lose them and this is why the
[59:13] Simplicity of a message on Divine
[59:15] Healing the the message of Divine
[59:18] Healing is not my message that is a
[59:20] Heavenly message God sent the message of
[59:24] healing of our body to us that belongs
[59:28] to us we're not asking God to heal us he
[59:31] already declared that we're healed so
[59:34] when we approach him it's not like Lord
[59:36] give me a favor or Lord I'm lucky maybe
[59:38] I'll win the lottery or maybe I'll win a
[59:40] healing ticket and maybe I might get no
[59:43] that's not that's not it at all he's
[59:45] already purchased healing for you it's
[59:48] already
[59:50] yours am and if we can come with that
[59:54] assurance and have that Assurance in our
[59:57] mind and in our hearts then we just
[59:59] receive it and we claim it by the blood
[1:00:02] of God by the word of God and it becomes
[1:00:04] a reality to us to us and so he
[1:00:08] says they'll you'll lose them they won't
[1:00:11] act at all and he says this brother
[1:00:14] that's what the church has done to the
[1:00:18] six since God put them in let me ask you
[1:00:20] this let me ask you a
[1:00:22] question in this church here let's say
[1:00:26] we are we are called what what they call
[1:00:28] a message church and I take all the
[1:00:31] tapes and all the sermons recorded
[1:00:33] sermons of brother ranom and I'm having
[1:00:35] I I stack them up on the wall cre create
[1:00:37] a nice little rack over there and I have
[1:00:39] all the tapes over there then we have
[1:00:41] the good old Bible
[1:00:43] here and we have all the word of God
[1:00:46] it's all sitting there and you come into
[1:00:48] that church and it's dead I mean no life
[1:00:53] in it at
[1:00:54] all now now is that an indictment on the
[1:01:00] message sir is that an indictment on the
[1:01:04] Bible but have we seen
[1:01:07] that this is a man that has healthy
[1:01:10] muscles but he can't walk because he's
[1:01:13] not using them to
[1:01:15] walk and the the ability to walk is all
[1:01:18] there the prescriptions how you need to
[1:01:20] exercise how you need to practice it's
[1:01:23] all hanging up on the wall we have the
[1:01:24] instructions there it's all here we have
[1:01:26] witnesses we have evidence if you are
[1:01:29] not walking that is not an indictment on
[1:01:32] God that is not an indictment on his
[1:01:36] word that is not an in that's not
[1:01:38] because we have turned a corner that is
[1:01:41] because somebody chose to not let these
[1:01:45] things happen or work in their
[1:01:48] lives the Bible said that he put the
[1:01:50] gifts God gave gifts unto men he put
[1:01:54] those gifts in the church did he ever
[1:01:56] take those gifts out of the church
[1:01:58] they're in God's Church they might not
[1:02:00] be in your church but they're in God's
[1:02:02] church because they're in the Bible
[1:02:04] Church and when God wants to use those
[1:02:06] gifts he
[1:02:08] will as he chooses and he wants to so as
[1:02:12] a minister as brothers and sisters we're
[1:02:15] simply you know just going through the
[1:02:17] attic of what really belongs to us I'm
[1:02:20] going through the attic of mom and dad
[1:02:22] stuff and seeing what really belongs to
[1:02:24] me and that's the way you have to
[1:02:27] approach this word what really belongs
[1:02:30] to you I I don't want to sit in the same
[1:02:33] condition that I've always been I want
[1:02:35] to move on up a little bit higher a
[1:02:39] little bit more anointing a little more
[1:02:43] Victory a little more Victory can you
[1:02:46] use a touch of a touch more victory of
[1:02:48] Victory in Jesus that's all I want I
[1:02:51] just want another touch more and God has
[1:02:54] it for me he has it for you too he said
[1:02:58] that's what they done with the six sent
[1:03:02] brother the church has done the six
[1:03:04] sense God put him in he's just placed
[1:03:07] Faith Off In Miracles and signs and the
[1:03:10] things that contacts God gives him the
[1:03:13] Holy Ghost and things he's placed that
[1:03:15] off over there back over here somewhere
[1:03:18] till the thing has become dead you know
[1:03:22] some people they eulogize the quote it's
[1:03:24] a live quote it's aive scripture but the
[1:03:27] way they present it is dead like a
[1:03:30] eulogy the scripture didn't die the
[1:03:32] scripture is a liive it's on fire you
[1:03:36] might be dead but if you put it in the
[1:03:38] hands of a True Believer that thing will
[1:03:40] work just like it's always work yes you
[1:03:44] know I can claim my family because I
[1:03:46] seen others claim their family it worked
[1:03:49] on them it'll work in my family now the
[1:03:52] unbeliever will say well my familyes
[1:03:54] they're Hypocrites that's your family
[1:03:57] that is not our family here we believe
[1:03:59] in the token here we claim our loved
[1:04:02] ones you say it's going to take a
[1:04:04] miracle to save him exactly it took a
[1:04:07] miracle to save you and God is the
[1:04:12] miracle working God he's the one that's
[1:04:15] got the power to create a way when there
[1:04:19] is no way you can't see a way he'll
[1:04:22] create one amen
[1:04:26] yes cuz the word of God is alive and
[1:04:30] don't let the churches eulogize this
[1:04:32] word it's not dead it's
[1:04:35] alive so brother Brandon brings us in
[1:04:37] faith as a six sense and he says this
[1:04:40] right towards the end of the message in
[1:04:42] paragraph number 45 he says this here
[1:04:44] all right are you ready to receive your
[1:04:47] healing all of you you're going to put
[1:04:51] your six sense to work what is the six
[1:04:54] sense now it's faith and faith is the
[1:04:58] substance of things hoped for the
[1:05:00] evidence of things that makes Missouri
[1:05:03] wrong I'm from Missouri you have to show
[1:05:06] me you know got to see it faith is that
[1:05:09] thing that subdues kingdoms that rots
[1:05:13] righteousness that does all kinds of
[1:05:15] Miracles and signs of the six sense wake
[1:05:19] it up take the bandage off your
[1:05:23] spiritual eyes look look around see if
[1:05:27] you can't see that God Still Remains God
[1:05:31] take the bandage off your ey you're a
[1:05:33] Believer here you are a Believer and
[1:05:37] every word of God belongs to you take
[1:05:40] the bandage off your eyes you can see
[1:05:43] these
[1:05:44] promises I love that and reading these
[1:05:48] quotes the bandages are coming off my
[1:05:50] eyes I don't know if I get too fired up
[1:05:53] I might have to leave here yeah
[1:05:58] would you come with me where are we
[1:06:00] going I'm going up yonder I'm getting up
[1:06:03] out of here this is not my home all the
[1:06:06] news they talking about it's garbage but
[1:06:09] there's a place there's a land where
[1:06:11] this message came from that's where I'm
[1:06:14] going back to by the glory of God by the
[1:06:17] grace of God you know we can't stay here
[1:06:20] the
[1:06:21] same the position you're sitting in
[1:06:23] right now you can't stay the same that's
[1:06:25] right that's right we don't think of it
[1:06:27] that way but in five years some of you
[1:06:29] all will be married and maybe move on
[1:06:33] some of you you know will move on in
[1:06:36] your life in other areas of your life
[1:06:39] your careers even jobs you've had
[1:06:41] there's changes that always happen but
[1:06:44] there's one thing that will not
[1:06:46] change and this is what we don't want to
[1:06:49] change in our heart and in our Spirits
[1:06:51] the unmovable faith in God's word am you
[1:06:55] know all of the things out here are
[1:06:57] going to change the laws will change the
[1:06:59] pressures on the job will change how you
[1:07:02] can talk to people will change I talking
[1:07:03] to two of my friends they're in the
[1:07:05] corporate world and they work these
[1:07:07] nine-five jobs and and they were telling
[1:07:10] me that time of the year they have to go
[1:07:12] through
[1:07:13] their sexual harassment
[1:07:17] training I was like wow what is that and
[1:07:20] they explain all of the the things they
[1:07:23] have to be careful of now and my one
[1:07:26] friend he said at the end they asked if
[1:07:28] he could give a comment and he wanted to
[1:07:30] give a comment but his computer broke
[1:07:31] down he said he's kind of glad he didn't
[1:07:34] because giving a comment ain't going to
[1:07:36] stop
[1:07:37] nobody preaching on the corner is not
[1:07:40] going to stop them this great machine of
[1:07:42] where they're moving to that's right
[1:07:44] they're high on it they're anointed
[1:07:48] brother brandom says because the last
[1:07:50] day says they would do what they're
[1:07:52] doing with the
[1:07:53] loss and so us going after them and
[1:07:56] fighting them it's not going to St them
[1:07:58] stop them it's just going to give you
[1:08:00] heartaches and stress but if you pick up
[1:08:03] the Bible and begin to read that and you
[1:08:06] let that come into your spirit that's
[1:08:08] going to bring Health to your
[1:08:10] bones it'll bring peace in your mind
[1:08:14] it'll give you Clarity and you'll know
[1:08:16] how to stand when you're dealing with
[1:08:18] the foolishness of the day it'll give
[1:08:21] you a faith when when there's so much
[1:08:23] darkness and doubt and unbelief it
[1:08:27] always lifts you up to where he is
[1:08:31] because it's the word of the Lord it
[1:08:33] cannot fail and when we take God at his
[1:08:36] word he keeps his word he backs his word
[1:08:39] up and he will always be with you as you
[1:08:43] stay with his word amen so we can't stay
[1:08:46] the same we can't stay the same we got
[1:08:48] to move on but the word of the Lord will
[1:08:51] endure and the things that's going to
[1:08:54] change in me let them be the changes for
[1:08:58] the better my body my spirit and my soul
[1:09:03] can I get a
[1:09:04] witness now
[1:09:07] this six sense that he says to take off
[1:09:10] the bandage of your eyes so that you can
[1:09:15] see how many you got some bandages on
[1:09:18] your eyes that you need to see
[1:09:20] clearly you know we have times where we
[1:09:23] operate in faith and then we get
[1:09:24] discouraged and we go down a little bit
[1:09:27] but you know this is why we're in the
[1:09:29] word today this is why we're in service
[1:09:31] today not just to be seen I'm actually
[1:09:35] trying to find a word I'm trying to find
[1:09:38] a word of the Lord that will raise up my
[1:09:43] faith
[1:09:45] amen that's what I came here for that's
[1:09:48] what we're gathered here for to hear the
[1:09:51] word of the Lord and Faith cometh by
[1:09:53] hearing the word of the Lord the god of
[1:09:55] this evil age brother bam says this here
[1:09:57] paragraph
[1:09:58] 189 he starts in his prayer paragraph
[1:10:01] 188 and he's talking to the Lord and He
[1:10:04] how he he's trusting for great services
[1:10:06] and the power of God that there will be
[1:10:09] great signs and wonders let's read it
[1:10:11] paragraph 188 I was going to skip it but
[1:10:13] let's read that this is Brother Bron's
[1:10:16] prayer to the people here I think this
[1:10:18] is in
[1:10:20] Tabernacle and I trust Lord tonight that
[1:10:22] there will be a great service that the
[1:10:24] power of God will be here great signs
[1:10:27] and wonders as we heard the results from
[1:10:30] these last couple of meetings let me
[1:10:32] stop here sorry I hate to stop but I'll
[1:10:34] pick it back up what kind of prayer is
[1:10:38] that I mean I mean can I pray that
[1:10:41] prayer in this church and you all don't
[1:10:43] look at me weird I mean listen to the
[1:10:45] prayer listen to the prayer to his
[1:10:47] congregation and I trust Lord tonight
[1:10:50] that there will be a great service that
[1:10:52] the power of God will be here great
[1:10:55] signs and
[1:10:57] wonders as we heard the from the results
[1:11:00] from the last couple of meetings how
[1:11:02] tremendous see what happened I pray dear
[1:11:05] God that you'll give us a double portion
[1:11:07] tonight I pray it with a sincere heart
[1:11:10] Lord because it's my love for you and
[1:11:13] your word and for these people granted
[1:11:16] dear
[1:11:17] God and if out across the land or even
[1:11:20] in here now that there's some that's
[1:11:22] sick and Afflicted and has to be gone
[1:11:25] tonight won't be here or be out there in
[1:11:27] the churches or places where they'll met
[1:11:30] I pray you'll heal them now Lord but for
[1:11:33] the greatest of all healing if you'll
[1:11:36] heal uh if you heal their physical body
[1:11:40] from cancer TB pneumonia something
[1:11:43] they'll get sick again no doubt if they
[1:11:45] live very long for their body is still
[1:11:48] under sin the curse but let them get the
[1:11:52] real Divine Healing the the healing of
[1:11:55] the Soul which makes a new creature
[1:11:59] passes from Death unto life and then
[1:12:01] waiting in this old Tabernacle for the
[1:12:04] Redemption of the body after the soul
[1:12:06] has been redeemed granted Lord what a
[1:12:09] prayer what a prayer thank God for a
[1:12:13] prophet who prayed the prayer of faith
[1:12:17] amen and we can use that as our example
[1:12:20] is that right amen now this
[1:12:26] this enticing Spirit as we started in on
[1:12:29] the on that quote cancer in the soul and
[1:12:33] how brother banam is dealing with
[1:12:35] Christians that have evil things in them
[1:12:38] they don't want them there and then he
[1:12:42] starts to talk about that um aligning
[1:12:45] these things up and I've read these
[1:12:47] quotes before over the years and I read
[1:12:49] them I think earlier this year this
[1:12:51] particular quote out of the same message
[1:12:53] enticing Spirits we play the tape here
[1:12:56] for you but it's good to go back and
[1:12:58] hear it and see how he breaks down what
[1:13:00] he calls
[1:13:02] demonology and he's bringing in the uh
[1:13:06] um that was one of the things that I
[1:13:09] mentioned the the gentleman's name he
[1:13:10] did the eulogy for brother brandom's um
[1:13:13] um service in Phoenix what was his name
[1:13:17] Osborne but I was mentioning how his
[1:13:20] wife had gave testimony and she said
[1:13:23] that when brother random came up to the
[1:13:24] platform form and he started preaching
[1:13:27] she said something she never thought of
[1:13:29] she said he asked the question where
[1:13:33] diseases come from and so if you know
[1:13:36] the diseases come from Satan and you're
[1:13:39] a Christian then you can categorize that
[1:13:43] these things do not belong to me as a
[1:13:46] Believer that's the foundation where did
[1:13:49] cancer come from where did rheumato
[1:13:52] arthritis come from to burco Lois and
[1:13:56] pneumonia where did that come from
[1:13:58] blindness and all the diseases what is
[1:14:02] it a result of it's a result of sin and
[1:14:05] then tell me what this means right here
[1:14:07] that day on Calvary that was the answer
[1:14:11] to all of our sins all of our diseases
[1:14:16] everything that would ever ill a human
[1:14:18] being if he finds the cross he can find
[1:14:22] his healing right there at the cross God
[1:14:25] and so she he brings this to the people
[1:14:29] brother brandom does and then in in his
[1:14:31] message he brings this Triune being and
[1:14:35] and these men that we the three men that
[1:14:37] we was talking about Body Soul and
[1:14:39] Spirit and he goes deeper into this
[1:14:41] message and it just won't it won't take
[1:14:43] me long to get through this and then I
[1:14:45] want to take that message Christ is the
[1:14:47] mystery of God revealed and right at the
[1:14:50] beginning and many churches have it in
[1:14:52] the front a word to to the church how
[1:14:55] many read that heard that very nice
[1:14:59] and something that we want to hear and
[1:15:03] read so he takes paragraph 43 he says
[1:15:07] this
[1:15:08] here oh if people could only realize
[1:15:10] that's why I come this morning and ask
[1:15:12] you to remember me as I go overseas and
[1:15:15] all things pray someone came the other
[1:15:17] day and said brother random do you think
[1:15:19] it's wrong to do a certain
[1:15:21] thing I said why are you question me
[1:15:24] about see
[1:15:25] if there's a question in your mind leave
[1:15:27] it
[1:15:29] alone don't do it at all I wish I could
[1:15:33] show you that ring up there in your
[1:15:35] spirit if there's a question inside of
[1:15:37] you then don't do it at all there's a
[1:15:40] question inside of you down in your
[1:15:43] spirit from your soul there's a question
[1:15:46] is this wrong to do if there's a
[1:15:48] question in there and then your body
[1:15:50] goes and does it anyway there's a
[1:15:53] conflict there and you can't have faith
[1:15:55] where there's a conflict so if there's a
[1:15:57] question then leave it alone God's word
[1:15:59] wasn't presented to you as a question am
[1:16:02] I the Lord that healed no it declares I
[1:16:04] am the Lord that heals you I am your
[1:16:10] salvation it's a
[1:16:13] declaration it's clear it's not a
[1:16:15] question and he says now all
[1:16:19] things ought to be considered
[1:16:21] prayerfully first seek ye first the
[1:16:23] kingdom of God and his right
[1:16:24] righteousness and all these other things
[1:16:27] will be
[1:16:28] added I am positive sure this morning if
[1:16:31] men and women could only get into the
[1:16:34] position where their soul their thinking
[1:16:37] their attitude will be perfect in the
[1:16:40] side of God that would be one of the
[1:16:42] most powerful churches that ever
[1:16:46] existed watch for a few moments on the
[1:16:49] physical now we have many times in half
[1:16:52] for years what we call a lie detector
[1:16:54] you can put it on your wrist set it
[1:16:56] across their head you can get in there
[1:16:58] and try your best to make a lie sound
[1:17:00] like the truth and it'll register
[1:17:03] negative every time because the human
[1:17:06] was not made to lie lying is a deceitful
[1:17:12] hard thing evil thing I'd rather have a
[1:17:15] drunkard with me any day than a liar see
[1:17:19] a liar in your body wasn't made to lie
[1:17:22] no matter how sinful you are your still
[1:17:25] a fallen Son of God the most sinful
[1:17:29] person in this city today God didn't
[1:17:32] intend you to be sinful he wanted you to
[1:17:34] be a son or daughter of his you're made
[1:17:37] up in his own makeup but sin has caused
[1:17:40] you to do that and no matter how much
[1:17:43] you try to impersonate and try to make a
[1:17:45] lie seem right they've got a scientific
[1:17:48] instrument that proves that it's wrong
[1:17:52] you can tell it with all the Innocence
[1:17:54] you want to but it's still register
[1:17:57] negative because there's a subconscious
[1:18:00] down in a human being and that subc
[1:18:03] conscience knows what's
[1:18:06] truth and no matter what you're saying
[1:18:09] out here that subconscious knows that
[1:18:12] it's a lie and it'll register off the
[1:18:17] subconscious therefore if a man or woman
[1:18:20] could ever get their thoughts and their
[1:18:23] testimony and their lives so lined up
[1:18:28] with God Amen until the channel of the
[1:18:31] holy spirit will be perfectly one with
[1:18:35] God what would take place if the man and
[1:18:38] woman could get lined up where with the
[1:18:41] freedom from their heart with Faith from
[1:18:44] the innermost don't you desire that
[1:18:46] don't you long for that your inner man
[1:18:50] and your testimony and your thoughts all
[1:18:53] be lined up with the word of God isn't
[1:18:56] that what we
[1:18:57] desire these little conflicts that come
[1:19:00] within us and you know sometimes we're
[1:19:04] conflicted how many's ever I won't ask
[1:19:06] you to raise your hand but how many's
[1:19:08] ever known you knew at one time in your
[1:19:10] Christian Journey that you should have
[1:19:12] gone up for prayer when it was
[1:19:16] offered but something kept you in your
[1:19:18] seat now down inside of you you know
[1:19:22] good and well if there was nobody there
[1:19:24] you would have got up and said Lord help
[1:19:26] me right now I need a touch from you but
[1:19:30] see that conflict of your body and our
[1:19:33] Christianity and what they're going to
[1:19:34] think about me and all this and that you
[1:19:36] need to let that go and come clean
[1:19:40] before the Lord then we'll have a
[1:19:43] worship service that'll be from your
[1:19:45] heart and you won't be looking around
[1:19:48] seeing who's praising the Lord or not
[1:19:51] but God will be dealing with your soul
[1:19:55] in your heart in your
[1:19:58] life we're conflicted looking around
[1:20:02] religion produces that church atmosphere
[1:20:04] produces
[1:20:07] it but the word of the Lord sees right
[1:20:11] down through you anyways and his grace
[1:20:14] and mercy will still find you even when
[1:20:17] you deny him it'll find you and his
[1:20:21] grace will still catch up with you
[1:20:25] and give you another opportunity to say
[1:20:27] yes Lord yes Lord I'm so glad he's
[1:20:31] faithful when I'm not faithful he's
[1:20:34] honest when I'm not honest he's
[1:20:37] persistent oh when I deny him he still
[1:20:41] comes after me and he keeps on blessing
[1:20:44] me keeps anointing me thank you
[1:20:53] Lord prophet God continues he says our
[1:20:55] thoughts Our Testimony Our Lives to be
[1:20:58] lined up look at this in paragraph 48
[1:21:01] many people come to the altar to be
[1:21:03] prayed for they have intellectual Faith
[1:21:07] they confess their sins and join Church
[1:21:09] by intellectual Faith they believe it in
[1:21:12] their mind they believe it because
[1:21:14] they've heard it they believe it because
[1:21:16] they know it's the best policy but
[1:21:18] that's not what God looks at he don't
[1:21:21] look at your intellectual Faith he looks
[1:21:23] on the heart we on the inside God and
[1:21:29] when it comes from the
[1:21:31] heart all things said all things are all
[1:21:36] things all things are POS when it comes
[1:21:39] from the heart that's where I want to
[1:21:41] get to I want to get where it comes from
[1:21:43] my heart I believe it with all of my
[1:21:45] heart then all things are
[1:21:49] possible sir to them that believe that's
[1:21:51] what Jesus said that's what your Bible
[1:21:53] said is in the message
[1:21:55] message notice he
[1:21:58] continues but when your confession says
[1:22:01] one thing and your life lives another
[1:22:03] there's something wrong somewhere that's
[1:22:05] because you've got an intellectual faith
[1:22:07] and not a Faith from the heart and that
[1:22:09] shows the outside here is a knowledge of
[1:22:12] God but inside here is a
[1:22:17] demon ad
[1:22:21] doubting now I'm moving along quite
[1:22:23] quickly here but I'm going to slow down
[1:22:24] a little bit I might not get to the word
[1:22:27] of to the church I'm going to stop right
[1:22:29] at 6:30 all right but the prophet of
[1:22:34] God now says it's a demon
[1:22:39] doubting so we'd have to say it's not
[1:22:41] the Holy Spirit doubting causing you to
[1:22:43] doubt what's causing you to doubt where
[1:22:46] does sickness come from huh where does
[1:22:50] the sleepiness come from just when God's
[1:22:53] trying to speak to you
[1:22:56] I got to get my rest you know my body
[1:22:58] told me I got to get my rest you get
[1:23:00] your rest in the grave brother you get
[1:23:03] your rest on the other side over here
[1:23:06] we're working till Jesus come you need
[1:23:09] to drink a cup of cold water or pour
[1:23:10] some ice on your face wake up and then
[1:23:13] pray
[1:23:15] through huh somebody I get a head notot
[1:23:18] or something you know what I'm talking
[1:23:19] about how many's ever how many's ever
[1:23:22] you trying to get your sleep it's so
[1:23:23] sweet and at 2:00 3:00 in the morning
[1:23:26] you just wide awake can't go to sleep
[1:23:30] brother bam talks about that's the time
[1:23:31] that you should pray maybe God wants to
[1:23:34] speak to you but you want to stay
[1:23:36] committed to the body cuz I got to get
[1:23:39] my rest I got to work in the morning
[1:23:42] tell me what's more important God wants
[1:23:44] to fellowship with you and all the
[1:23:47] demons and everything else is sleep they
[1:23:49] all passed out from drinking and
[1:23:51] foolishness of the world everybody in
[1:23:53] the neighborhood sleep he says okay I
[1:23:55] want to talk with you wake him up wake
[1:23:56] him up and you wake up you roll over
[1:23:58] you're trying to get that sleep get that
[1:24:00] sleep you can't sleep rise up and grab
[1:24:03] the word of the Lord fall on your knees
[1:24:06] and pray and see maybe the Lord has
[1:24:08] something for you and so but he says
[1:24:12] it's a demon
[1:24:13] doubting um I believe in Divine Healing
[1:24:17] but it's not for me see oh I could be so
[1:24:21] but I don't believe it get it outside
[1:24:23] you say yes inside your conscience says
[1:24:27] no the same scientific thing would prove
[1:24:30] that that wasn't the right prove it
[1:24:35] notice paragraph 52 he says give me a
[1:24:38] preacher give me a Christian give me a
[1:24:43] housewife that's a Christian give me a
[1:24:46] farmer or a factory worker that will put
[1:24:49] God first in
[1:24:51] everything I'll show you a man who will
[1:24:53] be successful in spite of all the devil
[1:24:56] can put on him he seeks God first we
[1:25:00] must he must have first place so brother
[1:25:03] bam goes into this even further this
[1:25:08] message enticing Spirits I'm going to
[1:25:09] get to the answer of that I keep getting
[1:25:12] sidetracked pulled away a little bit but
[1:25:15] this is this is very good and paragraph
[1:25:18] 53 he says this and I want you to you
[1:25:23] you want to take time to go listen to
[1:25:24] that message it's very good I just took
[1:25:26] out these things how he brought in the
[1:25:29] cancer of the body and then he brought
[1:25:32] cancer in the soul and now he's talking
[1:25:35] about there's a demon
[1:25:38] doubting so this is this is what happens
[1:25:41] to True Believers this is a process that
[1:25:43] actually happens to us and is happening
[1:25:46] to us and um the prophet of God is going
[1:25:50] to help us through the word of the Lord
[1:25:52] to get through it paragraph 15
[1:25:55] 3 he says but they didn't do it they
[1:25:58] were clouded over because Ahab a great
[1:26:02] Bri Kingdom he had it done a whole lot
[1:26:04] of things drop down to paragraph 54 he
[1:26:06] says that's where the world is today
[1:26:08] that's where America stands today that's
[1:26:11] where the churches stand today we've
[1:26:13] built some of the best churches was ever
[1:26:15] built we have some of the best polish
[1:26:17] Scholars we ever had we've taught some
[1:26:19] of the best theology and so forth and
[1:26:21] learned to sing like Angels but yet
[1:26:24] there's a weakness somewhere there's a
[1:26:27] weakness because we've gone after man's
[1:26:30] Doctrine and enticing Spirits instead of
[1:26:34] coming back to the word of God they try
[1:26:36] to make things pattern like the world
[1:26:39] they try to put shining lights over it
[1:26:41] like
[1:26:42] Hollywood and brother bam goes on and he
[1:26:44] says how do you let go paragraph 96 so
[1:26:49] many people are wondering today saying
[1:26:50] well brother brandham how do you let go
[1:26:54] I know you heard a lot of theology on it
[1:26:56] let go a lot of people just work up a
[1:26:59] sweat trying to let go many people come
[1:27:02] around and say I was going on a 40-day
[1:27:04] fast so I can do something you don't
[1:27:07] need a 40-day fast you need to let go of
[1:27:10] the world and all these devilish things
[1:27:13] and take God's word in your heart you've
[1:27:16] got to be taught how to do that you
[1:27:19] don't do it by jumping up and down
[1:27:21] neither do you do it on a 40-day fast
[1:27:24] you do it by a surrendered heart to
[1:27:27] almighty God look at the example he
[1:27:31] gives us are you there
[1:27:33] tonight like a baby I noticed my little
[1:27:35] baby back there his mother trying to put
[1:27:37] his little jacket on him this morning he
[1:27:40] wanted to get his little old arm in the
[1:27:41] sleeve he couldn't put his arm in there
[1:27:43] he didn't know how you've got to guide
[1:27:46] his little arm he wants to get his arm
[1:27:48] in there but he's just beating all
[1:27:50] around it he never gets to the sleeve he
[1:27:53] knows he's not in the sleeve and so do
[1:27:55] you know that you're not right with God
[1:27:59] when you're still
[1:28:01] backbiting lying doing everything you
[1:28:05] can't be right with God I don't care how
[1:28:07] many churches you belong to until your
[1:28:10] soul becomes
[1:28:12] converted brother that's oldfashioned
[1:28:15] but that will boil down and put soup in
[1:28:17] your
[1:28:19] soul try to put his arm in he's got to
[1:28:22] have someone to direct him in how how to
[1:28:24] put his arm in then when he gets his arm
[1:28:26] in the little jacket he knows it's all
[1:28:28] right that's the way it is with every
[1:28:30] born again Christian when he's really
[1:28:32] gets into God he watches his life with
[1:28:35] God's word he realizes he's lined up
[1:28:38] with every bit of it he's got
[1:28:40] longsuffering gentleness quietness
[1:28:42] meekness power Faith love joy peace he
[1:28:46] ain't tossed about like the troubled sea
[1:28:48] he ain't worried about every little
[1:28:50] thing he ain't jumping here and there
[1:28:53] like a bottle stoer on the windy ocean
[1:28:55] he's set his heart is pure his thoughts
[1:28:59] is pure his intentions are pure his
[1:29:02] alternative is right and he knows he's
[1:29:04] lined up with the word of God all hell
[1:29:08] can't move him he's lined up by the word
[1:29:10] of God he's got Divine love Purity in
[1:29:13] his heart for every man and woman he's
[1:29:16] abstained from the things of the world
[1:29:19] they're dead to him he don't want them
[1:29:21] no more why you couldn't make a holy
[1:29:23] ghost girl put on a pair of them ungodly
[1:29:25] looking clothes and get out there for
[1:29:27] nothing no
[1:29:30] sir can I take one more paragraph
[1:29:32] paragraph
[1:29:33] 113 just to wrap this up and so brother
[1:29:37] banam is saying throughout the message
[1:29:38] and he makes this statement it's
[1:29:40] enticing Spirits versus the word of God
[1:29:45] that's what it is paragraph number
[1:29:47] 113 enticing Spirits versus the word of
[1:29:52] God let let loose let go how do you do
[1:29:56] it brother bam just let go that's all
[1:29:58] you have to do take God's word don't try
[1:30:02] to work up nothing don't get at the
[1:30:04] altar and beat on it holler God give me
[1:30:06] the Holy Ghost Lord give me the Holy
[1:30:09] Ghost um he ain't coming you beating on
[1:30:13] that altar that don't do no good no that
[1:30:16] ain't the way it comes it's taking him
[1:30:20] at his word why because the word has the
[1:30:25] healing virtues in it you take God at
[1:30:28] his word that's how it comes you
[1:30:32] surrender to his word and he does the
[1:30:35] rest of it is that right he deals with
[1:30:38] the fear the conflicts he deals with the
[1:30:42] enticing spirits that you know something
[1:30:45] isn't right you know it's not being
[1:30:47] honest but yet the lie detector would
[1:30:51] catch it and you know but yet we get by
[1:30:54] and we have that little conflict in
[1:30:56] there and we want that conflict to be
[1:30:58] removed we want our thinking our soul
[1:31:00] Our Testimony to be lined up how many
[1:31:04] know this doesn't have nothing to do
[1:31:06] with the Baptist Church or the
[1:31:07] Pentecostal church this has nothing to
[1:31:10] do with the other churches actually it
[1:31:12] doesn't have anything to do with anyone
[1:31:14] in this church this is between you and
[1:31:20] God you focus in on that
[1:31:24] and it becomes real to you you're
[1:31:27] walking with him one
[1:31:30] onone you're be getting into a deeper
[1:31:33] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:36] he's the one who called you and saved
[1:31:38] you and he wants to have the closer walk
[1:31:40] with you as I read the quote earlier on
[1:31:43] the if a man can get his soul and his
[1:31:46] thinking if he can get all those things
[1:31:49] lined
[1:31:50] up he says that that would be if he can
[1:31:56] get his thoughts his testimony his life
[1:31:59] if he can get his soul thinking his
[1:32:02] attitude in the perfect plan of God that
[1:32:04] would be the most powerful church that
[1:32:07] ever existed and when he's talking about
[1:32:09] a church he's talking about an
[1:32:12] individual if you can get a person lined
[1:32:14] up like that that would be the most
[1:32:16] powerful
[1:32:18] individual we think of church we're
[1:32:20] thinking of a group of people here let's
[1:32:22] everybody share this quote so we can all
[1:32:24] see this together doesn't work that way
[1:32:27] you got to see it for yourself that's
[1:32:29] good you have your own salvation you
[1:32:32] actually have your own
[1:32:35] testimony and can't nobody tell your
[1:32:38] testimony if they told your testimony
[1:32:40] they probably eulogize it yeah he did
[1:32:42] this yeah he's just Chang yeah but no
[1:32:44] that's not your testimony your testimony
[1:32:46] is on fire I was on my way to hell but
[1:32:49] somebody changed me somebody delivered
[1:32:52] me that's real
[1:32:54] that's what happened to me you don't
[1:32:56] tell my testimony I can tell my own
[1:32:58] testimony I lived it and I'm so glad
[1:33:02] that I'm saved and I'm so glad that I'm
[1:33:05] Healed in my mind my spirit and my body

[1:33:45] warning he says it twice remember my

[1:34:58] sit him down and cause him to fellowship
[1:35:01] with you under the quietness in things

[1:44:25] you my brother yes a moment ago I
[1:44:28] decided if you would call me up I
[1:44:30] mention a quote to you something that
[1:44:32] came to my mind during the yes the
[1:44:34] sermon tonight did you enjoy that did
[1:44:36] that help you along the way I so
[1:44:37] appreciate that that tonight let's
[1:44:39] praise the Lord praise
[1:44:43] tonight it's very simple so brother Joe
[1:44:45] can get it but uh what are these sermons
[1:44:47] God leaning man or something along those
[1:44:50] lines brother Brandon was talking about
[1:44:51] a sister here and a sister over here and
[1:44:54] he said the demon is calling to another
[1:44:58] do you remember what it's calling for to
[1:45:00] accumulate it's not to oppress you sure
[1:45:03] it's oppression is maybe bad thoughts is
[1:45:05] this and that and the other accumulate
[1:45:08] what is that one trying to accumulate
[1:45:11] you remember unbelief it's that simple
[1:45:14] we just believe and and uh just so
[1:45:17] powerful tonight that there's enough
[1:45:20] here that we can believe and maybe
[1:45:21] you're struggling with this something
[1:45:23] that demon yes it wants to oppress you
[1:45:25] but it really wants you to unbeli
[1:45:27] disbelieve the word of God that you know
[1:45:30] those 70 left eat my flesh drink my
[1:45:32] blood the Lord did not chase them down
[1:45:34] as I really didn't mean to eat this
[1:45:35] we're going to have a symbol and it's
[1:45:37] the blood and the life and the flesh
[1:45:39] didn't try to change that but he said
[1:45:42] are you going to go too no where will we
[1:45:45] go because we're Believers tonight and
[1:45:47] so if you got something in your life
[1:45:49] something oppressing you or a family
[1:45:52] member just apply that token tonight
[1:45:55] because the demons just want us to to
[1:45:58] disbelief to unbelief they're trying to
[1:45:59] accumulate that someh some way but we're
[1:46:02] Believers and we just call the name of
[1:46:04] the Lord together
[1:46:06] tonight dear God we're so thankful to be
[1:46:08] gathered in your presence Lord
[1:46:11] because you you just took a simple life
[1:46:14] like ours Lord and you allowed us
[1:46:17] to to believe Lord and to come together
[1:46:21] and when we have that Revelation doesn't
[1:46:23] matter what you say it doesn't matter
[1:46:25] what the prophet says Lord because we're
[1:46:27] Believers we don't always understand we
[1:46:30] want to walk straigh or we want to walk
[1:46:31] the narrow way Lord
[1:46:35] the with you Lord with one another and
[1:46:39] where there's a doubt or
[1:46:42] a maybe something we're not exactly sure
[1:46:45] of the Prophet just made it real plain
[1:46:47] and simple just stay away from that if
[1:46:49] you're not sure and and then let that go
[1:46:53] and then maybe some way down the road if
[1:46:55] you're strong or if something changes
[1:46:57] maybe the Lord will let you to bring
[1:46:59] that thing in or
[1:47:01] just or whatever it is in our lives we
[1:47:05] we don't want anything between us and
[1:47:07] you we just want to have a a real
[1:47:10] relationship with you tonight and so we
[1:47:12] just call upon the name of the Lord and
[1:47:15] Lord you said there in the word to the
[1:47:16] church at the end there the brother Isel
[1:47:20] read how that we want to be blessed Lord
