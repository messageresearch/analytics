[Music] C I can't let a day go by without praising his name I Can't Forget from whence I came I can't let a day go by without counting the cost I can't let a day go by without praising his name I can't let a day go by without praising his name I Can't Forget from whence I came oh I can't let a day go by without counting the cost can't let a day go by without praising his name I can't and let a day go by without praising his name I Can't Forget from whence I came I can't let a day go by without counting the cost I can't let a day go by without praising him his name brother God bless you church sometimes I'd like to forget where I messed up and came from Brother John but it's good to remember where you been and how far you come so we just love him and thank him for bringing us along and we shouldn't let a day go by without praising his name amen so it's just good to do that with you tonight God bless you of course we're missing the pose uh pray for strength encouragement for our pastors been a rough couple of months and off to the funeral so we'll miss him but we'll press on so we're pressing on with each one of you we're going to be playing the tape communion in here in Tucson back in December of 65 and don't uh Let It Low you because we've all heard it but may it be an opportunity maybe we'll catch something brother Chuck we haven't heard before know it surprises me maybe I have heard it and remembered it or usually don't remember but I'm sure it'll bless each one of us tonight and brother Trevor he escaped but uh really appreciate him letting us sing that song with him brother Chuck I saw him give him the old fist you know fist pump there on Sunday and I was right with you brother Chuck I sure appreciated that brother Trevor's been listening to the Lord and just put it down to H pen and paper and song so appreciate that brother Chuck uh and brother Trevor and Scott just so you know on Sunday I'm requesting it again if you don't have a full plate because now the Wednesday night crew knows it and we can help teach the Sunday crew so if that works great if not we'll get it again and we'll continue to learn it I love those message written songs the AOS and different ones the the fontains have some and you know they're just inspired because they believe this same message that you and I do so God bless you let's do the thing song only believe as we go into communion only be only believe that all things are possible only believe only believe [Music] only believe all things are possible only let's sing it Lord I believe you confess it to tonight Lord I believe oh Lord I believe believe that all things are Possible only believe yes and Lord I believe we're Believers Lord I believe believe that all things are possible yay Lord I nice to be with Believers tonight God bless you you can be seated dur message brother per gave us just then from the word of God how true it is that we limit God and time God and he's Eternal we can't do that so tonight we're facing something else now is a a communion three years I waited for a church to come in toan but it's here we're we're here so we thank the Lord he just let us wait till we can appreciate it now there's one thing that I want to say just before we start the communion is this that I believe that we have seen enough in our day that we live in that we ought to really give every all of our being to God we we should really serve God I believe that he has blessed us with the direct answer to scripture as brother Perry gave it a few moments ago that we we are we're at that time we're not blind we we we see that we're here we we've arrived and we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leading the people that we we can't stay too much longer we've been a complete insane institution the whole world would be see so we at the end time now as brother Perry ended up there seeing these things are true see that they are true they're not myth they're not just something that we imagine there's something that's been directly given to us by the word of God and manifested publicly before us that we know we are here we we don't know how long now because again we come back to a watch you see what time it is but we are we know we we've here we at the time whether God's time I'd imagine someone give a little analysis one time that said that if God put up with him U according if he was a lot time one 1,000 years is just one day so if a man lived 70 years old it just be a few minutes of God's time or it said if it' be 40 years that wouldn't even meantime hard get B di see just that's how quick it is the whole thing if it be lotted time which he doesn't have any time so he's just he Eternal I believe it was Sarah back I know Joseph the other night said to me brother Perry said daddy where when did God come on the scene where did he come from see he had to have a beginning didn't he didn't he have to start I said no anything that has a beginning has an end right but it's that which had not a beginning has no end of course he's 10 years old that was kind of a real mouthful for him see that how could he receive that knowing that something never did begin not only to him it is to me see it's a great big dose for me how did it ever begin now we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred I was called on a few days ago to some very fine Christian gentleman that uh that's never had this and he understood that we taken communion literally they take it what they call spiritual communion and U Which is far as communion I'd say all right because communicate is to talk to see and the brother gave me this scripture said brother BR don't you think now reason I'm saying this is sorry that reason I'm saying this so that you would understand what you're doing you don't if you walking in ain't blindly you don't know what you're doing you can't have even confidence if you don't know what you're doing but you must understand what you are doing and why you're doing it he said now if we take the word of God isn't that God that we're taking I said exactly right sir it's true but we read here that they actually Paul taught taking the literal Lord supper this do in remembrance of me said Jesus as often as you take it in remembrance of me you show forth the Lord's death till he come see now we are to take it we understand that St Paul who
