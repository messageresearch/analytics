[27:11] we're going to take just a portion of
[27:14] scripture and then I'll have a an
[27:16] announcement or
[27:18] two
[27:21] um or maybe I'll bring the announcement
[27:23] at the end or maybe I'll bring it now so
[27:27] Numbers chapter 25 God bless you
[27:32] um uh we'll take our scripture in
[27:35] Numbers
[27:37] Chapter uh uh uh 23
[27:41] actually very familiar portion of
[27:46] scripture
[27:56] see
[27:59] actually let's move back a little bit
[28:00] further and go
[28:06] to Numbers
[28:16] 22 and the children of Israel set
[28:19] forward pitched in the plains of Moab
[28:21] the side of Jordan by Jericho and BAC
[28:24] the son of zior saw all that is had done
[28:28] to the amorites and Moab was so afraid
[28:31] of the people because they were many and
[28:34] Moab was distressed because of the
[28:36] children of Israel and Moab said unto
[28:39] the Elders of Midian now shall this
[28:42] company lick up all that are around
[28:44] about us as the ox lith up the grass of
[28:48] the field and baik the son of zior was
[28:52] King of the moabites at that time he
[28:54] sent Messengers therefore to balam the
[28:57] son of of beor pior which is by the
[29:00] river of the land of the children of his
[29:02] people to call him saying behold there
[29:04] is a people come out from Egypt Behold
[29:08] thy they cover the face of the Earth and
[29:10] they abide over against me come now
[29:14] therefore I pray thee curse me this
[29:17] people for they are too Mighty for me
[29:20] pre Adventure I shall Prevail that we
[29:22] may Smite them and that they may drive
[29:25] them out of the lamb for our what
[29:28] that he whom thou blesses is blessed and
[29:32] he whom thou curses is cursed let's jump
[29:37] over to verse number 10 verse n and God
[29:42] came unto baalam and said what men are
[29:45] these with thee and balum said unto God
[29:48] BAC the son of zippor King of Moab had
[29:51] sent unto me saying behold there is a
[29:55] people coming out of Egypt which cover
[29:57] cth the face of the Earth come now and
[29:59] curse me then pre Adventure I shall um
[30:03] be able to overcome them and drive them
[30:05] out and God said unto balam Thou shalt
[30:08] not go with them Thou shalt not curse
[30:11] the people for they are blessed one last
[30:15] scripture and verse number
[30:18] 20 and God came unto balam at night and
[30:21] said unto him if the men come to call
[30:24] thee rise up go with them but yet the
[30:28] word which I shall say unto thee Thou
[30:31] shalt thou do and balam Rose up in the
[30:34] morning saddled his ass went with the
[30:37] princes of Moab and God's anger was
[30:40] kindled because he went and the angel of
[30:43] the Lord stood in the way for an
[30:45] adversary against him and tonight we're
[30:48] going to take a little uh our title will
[30:51] be
[30:54] um um our subject is Bam heart our title
[30:58] is word revealed will there's a word
[31:03] revealed will brother Brandon makes that
[31:05] statement but we're going to deal with
[31:07] balam's heart just for a moment let us
[31:09] pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on
[31:12] the word of the Lord tonight bless each
[31:15] one that's gathered here we pray in
[31:17] Jesus name amen God bless you you may be
[31:20] seated the word revealed will and the
[31:25] subject is balam's heart you know this
[31:27] is a very very interesting script
[31:31] portion of scripture as you read it
[31:33] again here um the strategy of BAC wasn't
[31:38] to hire other armies to go defeat Israel
[31:43] but his strategy was to get God to curse
[31:47] them and so he calls and hires a prophet
[31:52] who had a gift of Prophecy and this
[31:54] Prophet had a uh relation relationship
[31:57] with the Lord actually he can see
[32:00] Visions this was god-given gift and so
[32:04] this is a a maneuver he uses you know
[32:07] all the other nations went out to fight
[32:09] against Israel went out to fight against
[32:11] him they thought they were mightier
[32:13] thought they were stronger but Bayo did
[32:15] something different he he didn't fight
[32:17] with them head-to head he simply wanted
[32:20] God to curse them so they hire balum and
[32:24] balum goes to the Lord and the Lord
[32:26] speaks to him and tells him not to go
[32:29] with these men very clear brother Ram
[32:32] tells us that that was God's original
[32:35] will that's right that was the perfect
[32:37] will of the Lord and then as we read
[32:40] there in verse 20 and God comes to Bam
[32:43] again and tells him go with these people
[32:46] and then when he goes the Lord gets mad
[32:49] at him that's right but the Lord told
[32:51] him to go but then he gets mad and sends
[32:54] an angel to stand in the way keep your
[32:57] Bibles with you let's read that just a
[32:59] little
[33:00] bit the angle verse 22 the anger God's
[33:04] anger was kindled because he went and
[33:06] the angel of the Lord stood in the way
[33:08] for an adversary against him now he was
[33:10] riding upon his ass and his two servants
[33:13] were with him and the ass saw the angel
[33:16] of the Lord standing in the way and his
[33:18] sword drawn in his hand the ass turned
[33:22] aside out of the way and went into the
[33:24] field and balam smoked the ass to turn
[33:27] her into the way but the angel of the
[33:29] Lord stood in the path of The Vineyards
[33:32] and a wall being on this side and a wall
[33:35] on that side and when the ass saw the
[33:38] angel of the Lord she thrust herself
[33:40] unto the wall and crushed Bam's foot
[33:43] against the wall and he smote her again
[33:46] you can see I'm getting mad now and the
[33:49] angel of the Lord went for further and
[33:51] stood in the narrow place where was no
[33:54] way to turn either to the right hand or
[33:56] or to the left and when the ass saw the
[33:59] angel of the Lord she fell down under
[34:01] balum and balam's anger was kindled and
[34:06] he smoked the ass with the staff now
[34:10] balam is mad but really who's the one
[34:13] that's mad in the text God is mad that's
[34:17] but bam can't see that he's angry at an
[34:20] animal and God is angry at
[34:23] him it's so much deeper than the text
[34:26] and so this animal is getting beaten by
[34:30] balum and verse 28 and the Lord opened
[34:33] the mouth of the ass and she said unto
[34:36] balam what have I done unto thee that
[34:39] thou H has smitten me this the animal
[34:42] can count too now all right thou has
[34:45] smitten me three
[34:47] times and Bam said unto the as because
[34:50] thou has mocked me I would there were a
[34:52] sword in my hand for now would I kill
[34:55] thee could you imagine this animal is
[34:58] saving this man's life but he can't see
[35:01] it he's so mad he's so upset that if he
[35:05] had a sword he would kill the animal
[35:08] first you're having a conversation with
[35:10] an animal you never had a conversation
[35:12] with before and then this opens up if
[35:15] God would open the mouth of your animal
[35:17] what what would your animal say and this
[35:21] this is this is very powerful this is
[35:24] this is the word of the Lord you know
[35:26] you're riding on this Beast you got the
[35:29] permission to go first he said no then
[35:31] he said go cuz you asked him twice it's
[35:34] like you you talk god into changing his
[35:37] mind you know he said no first but I
[35:40] prayed again and the Lord told me so I'm
[35:43] good to go now but like God doesn't play
[35:47] games like that God don't need to change
[35:49] it I changed my mind you change your
[35:52] mind God don't change his mind asking
[35:56] God a second time to repeat himself for
[35:59] the purpose of him changing his first
[36:01] answer that's a Dangerous Ground that's
[36:05] a dangerous ground and here in this text
[36:08] we see the two Wills of the
[36:13] lord we see the perfect will of God and
[36:16] we see the permissive will of God God
[36:19] bless you Angel good to see you back
[36:20] there is Angel's birthday the other day
[36:23] happy birthday to him and but we see
[36:25] these two wheels that are working God's
[36:28] perfect will and his permissive will
[36:31] brother brandom brings this out to us so
[36:33] so so wonderfully look at the
[36:36] scripture and then then the Lord verse
[36:40] 30 and the ass said unto balam am not I
[36:43] thine ass upon whom thou Hast ritten
[36:46] ever since I was thine unto this day was
[36:49] I ever want to do so unto thee and he
[36:52] said nay then the Lord opened the angel
[36:56] the the the Lord opened the eyes of
[36:57] balam and he saw the angel of the Lord
[36:59] standing in the way his sword drawn in
[37:02] his hand he bowed down his head and fell
[37:05] flat on his face and the angel of the
[37:07] Lord said unto him wherefore hast thou
[37:11] smitten thine ass these three times
[37:15] behold I went out to withstand thee
[37:18] because thy way is perverse before me
[37:25] now God is dealing with this man's heart
[37:27] now your ways are
[37:31] perverse now just if you continue on
[37:34] with the with the B Bible story and the
[37:36] biblical
[37:38] account basically balum is hired to come
[37:43] and curse this People Israel or Jacob
[37:47] and he's hired by baleo who was the king
[37:50] because he feared
[37:52] them uh Israel didn't do anything to
[37:54] them but he feared them and instead of
[37:57] fighting with them he tried this other
[37:59] way to get God to curse
[38:02] them and in balam's hiring he goes and
[38:08] he offers sacrifices to the Lord it
[38:10] shows that he was scriptural in his
[38:13] sacrifices there was there was a ram
[38:15] that he used there was a a burnt
[38:17] offering that he used seven Rams he
[38:19] built it off the the the the the altar
[38:22] properly it was in order it's not random
[38:25] every every time you approach the Lord
[38:27] it is not random there's an order to
[38:30] approaching the Lord you can't approach
[38:32] the Lord with an uninc heart you can't
[38:35] approach the Lord with your own ideas it
[38:37] will humble you there is a sincerity
[38:41] that is required if you really want to
[38:43] hear from the Lord and he said a broken
[38:47] and a contrite heart I will not turn it
[38:50] away so if your heart is right he'll
[38:53] hear you if your heart is right and even
[38:56] you ain't right in what you're doing or
[38:59] what you're caught up in but your heart
[39:01] turns you can be in the middle of doing
[39:04] wrong but your heart turns God will hear
[39:07] your prayer amen and this
[39:12] was um balum offering the offering so as
[39:17] he offers the offering we're all
[39:18] familiar with the text that he now
[39:21] begins to
[39:22] bless the people he was hired to curse
[39:28] and so this raises a very beautiful
[39:32] Point there's three major blessings
[39:35] three or four blessings that balam
[39:38] pronounces over Israel the last one in
[39:43] Numbers chapter 24 he
[39:46] actually this
[39:48] man this man
[39:50] actually got him under the anointing of
[39:54] God and and produced a prophecy he
[39:58] prophesied a word of the Lord and
[40:01] pronounced that a a star would rise out
[40:04] of here and that that whoever would
[40:08] bless these people they will be blessed
[40:11] whoever will curse them they will be
[40:13] cursed and their their seed will
[40:16] flourish he said exactly what God told
[40:19] Abraham he wasn't in that conversation
[40:21] what he told Isaac he wasn't in that
[40:23] conversation what he told Jacob balum
[40:25] wasn't even alive but he got into the
[40:28] anointing and in that anointing had to
[40:31] bless the enemies his enemy and God
[40:35] caused it to be such so what do we see
[40:37] in this text we see that God has a
[40:41] perfect
[40:42] will he has a permissive
[40:46] will and no matter what side you fall
[40:51] on God's will will be
[40:55] done
[40:57] his will will be done with you Amen in
[41:01] spite of you even without you even
[41:07] because you of you and even for you his
[41:11] will is going to be
[41:13] accomplished if you're a part of it if
[41:15] you're not a part of it because you're
[41:17] here because you're not here because
[41:19] you're upset because you're happy his
[41:22] will will be will be
[41:25] accomplished you can't stop the will of
[41:27] God Amen and when the enemy comes
[41:31] in to bring a curse God can turn your
[41:37] enemy to use him to be the best asset
[41:40] for your life amen you need a good enemy
[41:44] sometimes you need an adversary
[41:46] especially one like this here Amen to
[41:48] get a blessing and look at look at what
[41:51] the Lord
[41:52] tells
[41:54] balam and his first offering to the
[41:59] Lord he's trying to get a curse on
[42:02] Israel a curse on
[42:04] Jacob and Look What the Lord says the
[42:06] Lord
[42:08] says I have not found any iniquity in
[42:12] Jacob it's like wait a minute Lord if we
[42:15] just repeat what you said a few chapters
[42:17] ago these people was getting on your
[42:19] nerves since they left
[42:21] Egypt they they have murmured they have
[42:24] complained they've done all the evil you
[42:27] can think of but when he looked down
[42:30] upon them he said I don't see no
[42:32] iniquity I've got to bless
[42:35] them wow and whosoever the Lord blesses
[42:39] they indeed will be
[42:41] blessed and so the
[42:44] prophecy so let's let's go deeper into
[42:47] balam's heart just for a moment to get a
[42:49] good picture of who balam is let's go
[42:52] through the scriptures just for a moment
[42:54] we won't read them all but I'll quote Su
[42:56] second Peter 2:9 the scripture says that
[42:59] balum loved
[43:03] wages Jude 111 says that they call it
[43:06] the error that balum made the error of
[43:09] balum Revelations 2:14 calls it the
[43:13] doctrine of balum who actually taught
[43:16] bik to cast a stumbling block so so here
[43:21] and in Joshua
[43:22] 13:22 they actually call him a
[43:25] sser
[43:27] now this balum had a relationship with
[43:29] the
[43:30] Lord and what I what I'd like to bring
[43:32] out here just for a moment I'm going to
[43:34] read some quotes for you that though
[43:37] balam was trying to curse Israel and
[43:41] though Bao's Ministry B's um purpose was
[43:46] to curse
[43:47] Israel God wouldn't
[43:50] hear a curse going upon his people but
[43:54] how did they succeed how they succeeded
[43:58] is so so it's like this
[44:00] here I can't make God get mad at you
[44:05] unless I get you to do something to make
[44:07] God
[44:09] mad so me just being mad at you can't
[44:12] make God mad at you or because I don't
[44:14] like you God please don't like him
[44:16] either because I don't like him no any
[44:19] more than that well look at all this
[44:21] fals look at all this mistakes H look in
[44:24] the mirror all right everybody got him
[44:28] uhhuh so you can't even be you you can't
[44:31] not even on the strength of the evidence
[44:34] that somebody is wrong that they they
[44:36] did this wrong they they're all jacked
[44:39] up they're all messed up even based on
[44:41] that God can't touch you he won't touch
[44:44] his child but if he gets you to mingle
[44:48] and
[44:49] mix see this is where he this is where
[44:52] he was successful balam and Bao was was
[44:56] when he got them to
[44:58] intermingle in marriage and committing
[45:00] adultery eating things from Another
[45:03] Altar and when that mix happened then
[45:07] God got
[45:08] mad
[45:09] sir then judgment came
[45:12] down so what a testimony we have for
[45:15] today now let's go into the message just
[45:17] for a
[45:18] moment you had to help me out sis just
[45:20] for a minute and these quotes I'll try
[45:23] to
[45:24] read repeat my a read slow so you can
[45:27] pick it up this is in the exposition of
[45:29] the seven Church
[45:31] ages the res the the resume of the ages
[45:34] brother bam says this or it's written
[45:37] this way I'll say he had the prophetic
[45:41] office he knew the proper approach unto
[45:44] God as demonstrated in the sacrifice of
[45:47] the clean Beast yet he was not a true
[45:51] word Prophet for when God told him not
[45:54] to go honor bao with his presence he
[45:57] sought to go anyway for he was motivated
[46:00] by his Lust For Gold and Prestige so God
[46:05] let him go the perfect will of God gave
[46:08] way to the permissive will of God
[46:12] because the heart desire of balam God
[46:17] actually said go ahead did God change
[46:20] his mind no sir God had God had his way
[46:25] regard less of balum going balum did not
[46:28] an know the will of God God had his way
[46:31] regardless it was balum who was the
[46:34] loser for he bypassed the word and today
[46:38] we have the very same thing women
[46:40] preachers organization false Doctrine
[46:43] Etc and people worshiping God
[46:46] manifesting in the spirit and going
[46:48] right on as did balum claiming that God
[46:51] has spoken to them even when the
[46:52] commission received is opposite to the
[46:55] revealed word and I will not deny that
[46:58] God spoke to them but it was just like
[47:01] when he spoke to balam the second time
[47:05] as he knew that balam wanted his own
[47:08] heart desire above the word and he gave
[47:12] it to him yet all the while in the end
[47:16] having his own way even so today God
[47:19] tells folks to go ahead in their own
[47:21] heart's desire for they have already
[47:24] rejected the word but the will of God
[47:27] will be done
[47:30] regardless
[47:33] amen can I get an amen the will of God
[47:37] will be done
[47:38] regardless I hope you see this it will
[47:41] not only clear up much of what is seen
[47:43] in all ages but it will especially help
[47:47] in this last age which has so much
[47:51] manifestation and external blessings
[47:53] when the whole period is so against the
[47:57] word revealed will of God that's our
[48:02] title this evening the word revealed
[48:05] will our subject is balam's
[48:09] heart you
[48:10] know we are really going to do what is
[48:15] in our heart you can you can even do
[48:18] what's
[48:19] right action wise but if your heart
[48:23] isn't right then it still in
[48:26] right you can even give the greatest
[48:29] amount or the greatest sacrifice you can
[48:31] do and be whatever uh others would call
[48:36] you to do but if your motive for doing
[48:39] for giving for sacrifice isn't correct
[48:42] then it's all in vain Jesus said in vain
[48:46] do they worship me teaching the
[48:49] doctrines of men the Commandments of men
[48:51] so really everything that we do our
[48:54] praise our giving our worship our
[48:57] ministry is a heart derived it's got to
[49:01] be according to our heart so as we look
[49:03] a little bit deeper we'll see there that
[49:06] down in balam's heart he had a desire
[49:10] and just for conversation sake he went
[49:14] to the Lord and he asked of the Lord if
[49:16] you if you read the entire chapter's
[49:19] proceeding you'll see that you know
[49:21] balum really didn't do anything that
[49:24] wrong
[49:26] you know he he asked the Lord the Lord
[49:29] said no he asked him again cuz something
[49:32] was in the heart and the Lord said
[49:34] go and and then when he went the Lord
[49:37] got upset with
[49:38] him almost slay him with an angel but
[49:41] then the angel said go ahead and go turn
[49:44] him again to go and then so he goes and
[49:47] when he goes he ends up blessing the
[49:50] people because God was using them as a
[49:53] tool we need these words spoken over you
[49:57] Israel and we're going to use your enemy
[49:59] to do it he'll be an anointed one and
[50:03] actually his heart is one thing but his
[50:05] prophecy is
[50:06] another his prophecy was thus sayeth the
[50:09] Lord but his heart was he didn't like
[50:12] those people to begin with brother
[50:14] Brandon brings this out very clearly to
[50:16] us can I take 10 more minutes here what
[50:18] he says here yes
[50:20] sir this is in the message does God ever
[50:24] change his mind about his word
[50:26] you say paragraph 121 you say well oh I
[50:30] could take it vice versa so could Bic
[50:33] balum see but God identified Moses and
[50:37] then what was the proof the word of God
[50:40] and he heard the plain cleancut decision
[50:43] of God don't you go don't try to curse
[50:47] what I've blessed them is my people but
[50:50] you know what balam didn't like them
[50:53] people to begin with
[50:56] oh what how many balms is there in the
[50:58] world today he didn't like that group to
[51:01] start with now after he got God's
[51:04] cleancut decision don't you go but you
[51:07] see instead of doing it it was the same
[51:10] thing like Cain like cor he was jealous
[51:13] he wanted to a reason to go anyhow and
[51:19] your heart will create a reason for you
[51:23] to do what you really want to do all
[51:25] right
[51:27] you'll find an excuse but it's really in
[51:30] your heart to do it anyways but now by
[51:33] reason oh here's an
[51:36] opportunity amen because if it's not in
[51:39] your heart you wouldn't do it you
[51:40] wouldn't ask the second time and this is
[51:43] bringing out what really was in balam's
[51:46] heart you know if you just take the Old
[51:49] Testament record of balum you don't get
[51:52] the gravity of what he did but then all
[51:54] the other prophets after this is what
[51:57] they said about him greedily after the
[52:00] wages he ran in the era he was you know
[52:04] all of the negative things that is said
[52:06] about him his Doctrine and how he taught
[52:07] the children to stumble right you
[52:12] see paragraph 122 now after he got God's
[52:15] clean-cut decision don't you go but you
[52:17] see instead of doing it was the same
[52:20] thing like Kane like cor he was jealous
[52:22] he wanted a reason to go anyhow no no
[52:25] his denominational headquarters after he
[52:28] sent back and said nope don't you
[52:30] believe it I nope don't believe I'll go
[52:33] down don't believe I'll have anything to
[52:36] do with him I won't debate with them
[52:38] people cuz God's done told me they are
[52:41] his people and I don't believe I'll go
[52:43] if he have stayed with that but down in
[52:47] his heart he didn't like them see they
[52:51] wasn't of his group and anything that
[52:53] didn't belong in his group wasn't right
[52:56] to begin with see and he looked down on
[52:59] them and said there has been some awful
[53:01] things them people did surely a holy God
[53:04] would curse such a people as that
[53:06] they're they're illiterate they're not
[53:08] educated like us we're smarter people oh
[53:11] they claim to serve God but look at them
[53:13] what are they a bunch of what we bunch
[53:16] of slaves mud dobers that the Egyptians
[53:19] run out down there why God would never
[53:22] have anything to do with a dirty Bunch
[53:24] like that prophet of God continues in
[53:27] paragraph 143 so we see what's in the
[53:30] heart of balum paragraph 143 of that
[53:32] same message there was one group come to
[53:35] a prophet one time named job they
[53:37] couldn't talk him out he saw the vision
[53:40] he know what was right balum saw the
[53:43] vision and still didn't stay with it so
[53:47] it isn't that he didn't know what the
[53:50] vision
[53:51] said job saw the vision and he stayed
[53:55] with his sacrifice balam sees the vision
[53:59] and he failed to stay with it you see
[54:01] the difference because his heart wanted
[54:04] to go this way
[54:05] anyways you say well if if God would
[54:08] come down and reveal himself I if there
[54:12] was a miracle take place like the
[54:14] raising of the Dead that would change
[54:15] people's hearts and Minds no a man
[54:18] coming from the dead won't change
[54:19] people's hearts and Minds a miracle is
[54:22] not going to change your heart and mind
[54:25] if your heart has a heart to believe
[54:27] you'll believe whether there's a miracle
[54:29] or not you just
[54:31] believe amen and it's a heart issue you
[54:35] try to prove this and prove that and
[54:37] then you prove that that ain't enough
[54:39] and then you prove this to him that
[54:41] ain't enough and then you prove that to
[54:42] a scholar that still isn't enough it
[54:45] ain't about proving nothing it's about
[54:47] does your heart
[54:48] believe and if you have a heart that
[54:50] will believe you'll follow with the word
[54:54] does God change Chang his mind about his
[54:55] word brother bner continues on and says
[54:58] this here paragraph 144 no matter how
[55:00] much his church group said oh job you
[55:03] ought to do this you ought to do that
[55:05] even his wife he said he talking like a
[55:07] foolish person see I know what the Lord
[55:10] said I know what he required and that's
[55:12] what I've done see he stayed with what
[55:14] God told him notice bam using this phony
[55:18] text for his
[55:22] conscience see he said well I'll find
[55:25] out I'll try again now there is where
[55:29] you come
[55:31] secondarily how many BMS have we got
[55:34] tonight that likes to use the phony text
[55:38] of Matthew
[55:39] 28:19 just for their conscience sake how
[55:42] many wants to use Malachi 4 for their
[55:45] conscience sake how many wants to use
[55:47] Luke
[55:48] 17:30 just for their conscience sake how
[55:51] many wants to use these things yet will
[55:53] I tell you I believe they're all mixed
[55:56] up on that see so are these scriptures
[56:01] true yes they're true Malachi 4 Luke
[56:05] 17:30 ma Matthew 28 are those scriptures
[56:08] true yes but if you're using it for
[56:11] conscience sake it's not true to you
[56:14] you're using it for the wrong
[56:16] reason and here balam in his heart he
[56:19] didn't like these people brother random
[56:21] brings it out the rest of the prophets
[56:23] John the Revelator brings it out Jude
[56:26] brings it out Peter brings it out they
[56:28] all bring out what was really going on
[56:31] in balam's heart in Revelations 2 says
[56:35] that he actually taught Balo who was the
[56:39] king how to get the people to make God
[56:43] mad at him this is how you do it don't
[56:47] stand up and curse him don't stand up
[56:48] and curse them but just send some the
[56:51] Midian itish women in there and invite
[56:54] them over to a party and we all you know
[56:57] Brethren anyways and just invite that
[57:00] and then you know one thing leads to a
[57:02] nest a drink here a drink there and then
[57:04] this one's running with that one and
[57:06] this one is mixing with that one that's
[57:08] when God got
[57:10] upset and this is where Satan will catch
[57:13] you and I today is to get us to mix or
[57:17] mingle the word that we already know
[57:20] it's true yes how do we know it's true
[57:23] it's on the tape yes sir
[57:26] it's on the tape it was on the tape
[57:29] before I was born it'll be on the tape
[57:32] when I'm gone it's still it's the word
[57:34] of the
[57:37] Lord but for conscious sake people will
[57:40] play with those words yes they'll play
[57:44] with it try to make it say something it
[57:45] doesn't say and then what he does it is
[57:49] trying to work on your
[57:51] unbelief a false teacher causes more
[57:54] problems than these people out here in
[57:55] the world a balum a dayon a core there
[57:59] the worst things can come in your
[58:01] congregation because they actually
[58:03] weaken your faith amen you know the the
[58:07] worldly schools I can deal with but it's
[58:09] the Christian Schools that's supposed to
[58:10] be Christians and they're worldly
[58:13] they're worse of an
[58:16] influence I've seen it it's true because
[58:19] they're Christians ain't supposed to be
[58:21] Bible Believers they're
[58:23] worse amen
[58:25] so this
[58:27] mixing this blending in yes to get God
[58:31] mad and God got upset with them and
[58:34] that's where the Judgment came down now
[58:37] how did
[58:38] balum end let's go a little bit further
[58:40] here in the
[58:43] message paragraph 147
[58:47] oh the BMS in the world tonight promised
[58:51] positions popularity my oh my
[58:55] they numb their conscience by them
[58:58] because of their denominations they say
[58:59] if you do that out you go I know you're
[59:02] a good man we love you and he's a good
[59:05] man we love you but you can't preach
[59:07] that our Doctrine says you can't do that
[59:10] Dr so and so said this is the way it is
[59:14] now you got to believe it this way if
[59:16] you stay with us now if you want to I
[59:19] know you had a hard time well I'll see
[59:22] if I can't get you promoted maybe change
[59:25] churches oh you ba that's right when you
[59:28] know the will of
[59:30] God you do
[59:32] it when you hear the will of God on tape
[59:35] do you do you wait for everybody else to
[59:37] say Amen sir or do you say Amen yourself
[59:40] that's right you do it God ain't going
[59:43] to change his
[59:45] mind no no let everybody else change God
[59:49] ain't
[59:51] changing repurpose it resay it represent
[59:54] s it repr preach it retell it God is not
[59:57] going to change his mind about his word
[59:59] that's right we can explain well that
[1:00:01] Vision was spiritual no it was literal
[1:00:03] no that came in the past say what you
[1:00:05] want to say do what you want to do God
[1:00:07] ain't changing his mind about his word
[1:00:10] you know when God sent the prophet a
[1:00:12] vision did you know he sent it to him on
[1:00:14] purpose did you know that he knew we
[1:00:17] would be here in
[1:00:19] 2023 did you know there'll be questions
[1:00:21] surrounding the
[1:00:23] vision but God ain't changing the vision
[1:00:26] for nobody he's not going to re-edit it
[1:00:29] or cut it out he said it and a believing
[1:00:32] heart will believe
[1:00:37] it an unbelieving heart will look for an
[1:00:41] excuse that's right yeah but a believing
[1:00:44] heart knows that God said
[1:00:47] it and if God said it it's his respon
[1:00:51] responsibility to make everybody like it
[1:00:54] or not that's right well if I believe
[1:00:57] that they won't like me brother Josh if
[1:01:00] I don't I if I say that brother Joe they
[1:01:03] won't like me no more I can't say it
[1:01:05] like that who whose job is it to get
[1:01:08] people to like you isn't that
[1:01:11] God you think God is worried about folks
[1:01:14] liking
[1:01:17] him
[1:01:19] please he's the god of
[1:01:22] Glory by him himself he created the
[1:01:26] heavens by himself he needs no counselor
[1:01:30] he doesn't need an advisor he doesn't
[1:01:33] need a second group a team to talk it
[1:01:35] over with him he is God and what he says
[1:01:38] is true his word is true and you can
[1:01:41] Bank your soul on it amen amen amen amen
[1:01:47] all right God bless you so
[1:01:50] much
[1:01:52] now this
[1:01:55] this brings out a couple of couple of
[1:01:59] beautiful things just this uh text in
[1:02:02] and uh uh of balum and him trying to
[1:02:07] curse Israel Numbers chapter
[1:02:11] 22 brings it all out how
[1:02:15] God wanted to pronounce a blessing on
[1:02:18] Jacob so he uses the enemy to do
[1:02:23] it he uses Bic and balum to do it now
[1:02:29] let's take our Bibles quickly and turn
[1:02:32] into Numbers chapter
[1:02:36] 31 now if you keep reading you'll see
[1:02:40] where belck and Balo actually got over
[1:02:44] on Israel at B peora remember that did
[1:02:48] remember they got in a party they got
[1:02:49] all whipped up they got all anointed
[1:02:51] they got all revelated they got all they
[1:02:53] were having a great time time this got
[1:02:56] to be God cuz this feels so
[1:02:59] good this dancing with these people man
[1:03:01] this just got to be the will of the Lord
[1:03:03] how you feel about or I feel the same
[1:03:06] way just because people agree with you
[1:03:08] don't mean it's right all
[1:03:10] right just because everybody else is
[1:03:13] doing it it's probably a sign that you
[1:03:16] shouldn't be doing
[1:03:18] it call it the herd
[1:03:22] mentality there nobody else helped her
[1:03:24] out nobody else said nobody else
[1:03:26] witnessed to her I just assumed that
[1:03:28] brother George was going to tell her the
[1:03:29] truth well I assume that Pastor was
[1:03:31] going to tell I thought the brother and
[1:03:32] sister did you tell him the truth well I
[1:03:35] saw what he was doing but I just didn't
[1:03:37] want to say nothing did you tell him the
[1:03:40] truth that's your
[1:03:43] responsibility
[1:03:45] yes
[1:03:49] yes everybody waiting on somebody to do
[1:03:52] what anybody can do I'm waiting on
[1:03:54] anybody some I'm waiting on somebody I'm
[1:03:56] waiting on everybody somebody anybody
[1:03:59] who who who are
[1:04:05] you Lord open my eyes and let my heart
[1:04:11] let my heart be right and that I can
[1:04:14] have this
[1:04:16] word uh revealed will revealed to me
[1:04:19] your will revealed to me by your word
[1:04:22] now numbers 31 just quickly and the Lord
[1:04:24] spake unto Moses and saying Avenge the
[1:04:27] children of Israel of the midianites
[1:04:31] after shalt thou be gathered unto thy
[1:04:34] people and Moses spake unto the people
[1:04:36] saying arm some of yourselves unto war
[1:04:40] and let them go against the
[1:04:43] midianites and Avenge the Lord of Midian
[1:04:47] look at verse number seven and though
[1:04:50] they wared against the midianites as the
[1:04:53] Lord commanded Moses and they slew all
[1:04:55] the males and they slew the kings of
[1:04:57] Midian beside the rest of them that were
[1:04:59] slain namely Eevee Rim Zur Hur Reba five
[1:05:05] Kings of Midian balam also the son of
[1:05:07] buor they slew with the sword the
[1:05:12] children of Israel took all the women in
[1:05:14] Midian caps and their little ones and
[1:05:16] took the swell of their cattle and all
[1:05:18] their flocks and all their good look at
[1:05:20] this look at this guy this man balum
[1:05:23] just for
[1:05:25] moment when he went to curse the
[1:05:29] people it was in his heart to curse him
[1:05:32] manyways
[1:05:33] that was in his heart but when the Lord
[1:05:36] got a hold of him he had to prophesy a
[1:05:40] blessing that was in God's heart so the
[1:05:44] permissive
[1:05:46] will actually caught up with the perfect
[1:05:50] will you you you shouldn't be be up here
[1:05:52] trying to curse these people get up on
[1:05:54] look at him at this angle no look at the
[1:05:58] back parts of them look at them at this
[1:06:00] angle and C you shouldn't even be here
[1:06:02] but but and that's the permissive will
[1:06:04] that you're here but now that you're
[1:06:05] here let me step in now and that's
[1:06:08] exactly what God did he took the
[1:06:10] permissive will and flipped it and we
[1:06:13] see God's perfect will calling a
[1:06:17] blessing on Israel that's still in
[1:06:20] effect
[1:06:23] today
[1:06:26] you can't mess with God and come out on
[1:06:29] top he's he he he's got it all he's got
[1:06:32] the story written over and over again
[1:06:34] all right amen amen right amen so God
[1:06:40] has tools did you know Satan is a tool
[1:06:44] yes that's right Satan is a tool in
[1:06:49] God's hands to perfect his perfect will
[1:06:54] mhm exactly
[1:06:56] right so balum in the end he slain with
[1:06:59] the sword even Bic didn't even give him
[1:07:02] an offering didn't promotes him to a a
[1:07:06] position the Bible says he he goes onto
[1:07:08] his own place you think he's living his
[1:07:10] own life doing his own thing but then
[1:07:11] God before he takes Moses off the scene
[1:07:14] first he takes Aaron then before he take
[1:07:16] Moses off the scene he says before I
[1:07:18] take you up
[1:07:20] Moses let's go deal with the
[1:07:22] midianites and they arm themselves a
[1:07:25] thousand out of each tribe 12,000 and
[1:07:28] they go in and they slay them because
[1:07:31] the Lord want to wanted to avenge what
[1:07:35] they had did to
[1:07:38] Israel and in the
[1:07:40] end he was the
[1:07:43] loser in the
[1:07:45] end God's perfect will was
[1:07:48] accomplished God uses whatever he wants
[1:07:50] to he uses tools to accomplish his
[1:07:54] perfect will and so we thank the Lord
[1:07:56] for that tonight don't
[1:07:57] we don't we want our heart to
[1:08:01] be
[1:08:04] right we want our heart to be what God
[1:08:08] wants it to be and not use a quote for
[1:08:12] conscience
[1:08:14] sake not use a statement for cons like I
[1:08:17] was bringing a message on how we
[1:08:18] emotionally will be tied to something we
[1:08:20] do it this way because we feel like this
[1:08:23] is the right way to do it but what if
[1:08:25] you have the word of the Lord on it yes
[1:08:27] sir then you need to change the way you
[1:08:30] feel right but for conscious sake we say
[1:08:33] well we're just doing what we'll just do
[1:08:35] what we'll just do we'll just do but
[1:08:37] what does the word of the Lord say
[1:08:39] that's true God told B so it's a
[1:08:41] beautiful text on God's perfect will and
[1:08:45] God's permissive will once God reveals
[1:08:49] his perfect will to you it's dangerous
[1:08:53] to try to ask him if he can revise it
[1:08:57] for your special
[1:08:59] circumstance very dangerous we see this
[1:09:03] in this in this
[1:09:05] text I um was bringing on Sunday how God
[1:09:09] has last few weeks how God has
[1:09:11] relationships with other people and
[1:09:13] other groups that he deals with and he
[1:09:15] had a relationship with balam when he
[1:09:17] went into the spirit the Lord spoke to
[1:09:19] him he said who are these men with you
[1:09:21] he gave him instruction his eyes were
[1:09:23] open he had a gift he was this was a
[1:09:25] relationship everybody knew it that's
[1:09:27] why they called him and here he makes
[1:09:30] this turn in his life in his ministry
[1:09:32] because his heart wasn't right and even
[1:09:35] though all the other prophecies might
[1:09:37] have been good and all the other things
[1:09:38] he did his heart caught up to him his
[1:09:42] real heart's desire caught up to him and
[1:09:45] that's what it will do to us today and
[1:09:46] if our heart really is to serve the Lord
[1:09:48] and do the good things of God that's
[1:09:51] what God will allow us that opportunity
[1:09:54] to do that amen God bless you God bless
[1:09:59] you
[1:10:00] amen I wanted to uh just share with the
[1:10:03] church a little bit first uh brother
[1:10:06] Bonza is going to he'll be flying I
[1:10:08] think he's he left the Phoenix tonight
[1:10:10] he flies out tomorrow and um we wanted
[1:10:14] to he's the first one in I think four
[1:10:17] generations in his family that's married
[1:10:20] properly all his dad is great is Grandpa
[1:10:24] his great grandpa none of them were
[1:10:25] married properly with one wife one
[1:10:28] husband he's the first one in his
[1:10:30] generation to do that he's taking a
[1:10:32] stand some of his fathers and uncles
[1:10:36] have tried to curse
[1:10:38] him and bring the Doom and Gloom on him
[1:10:42] a lot of the people in his condition if
[1:10:45] they they're under a certain livelihood
[1:10:48] in in Africa and they come to the states
[1:10:50] many of them they turn from the message
[1:10:53] they turn from from the word cuz they
[1:10:54] have all these Liberties and freedom I
[1:10:57] met I met a gentleman at Marshalls or
[1:11:00] one of these uh big not Big Lots but
[1:11:02] this Burlington c c Factory congales we
[1:11:05] start talking I know the congales know
[1:11:08] the prophet and I brought up the prophet
[1:11:10] to this gentleman oh he knew the message
[1:11:12] he knows all about it but when he comes
[1:11:14] here can't serve the Lord can't do too
[1:11:17] many freedoms too anything but I've seen
[1:11:19] this little character and I don't think
[1:11:21] he's streaming the service and I I say
[1:11:22] this um I seen um I'm trusting the Lord
[1:11:26] will continue to bless him that he'll
[1:11:28] continue to grow he he went in for he's
[1:11:32] in a program where cyber security and it
[1:11:36] was a um it was through the UFA um by
[1:11:39] scholarship mainly by invitation and he
[1:11:42] applied for it had no business applying
[1:11:43] for it but he said his name is confid
[1:11:46] confido
[1:11:48] confidence and he prayed and he he said
[1:11:51] he went in for the interview and they
[1:11:54] interviewed him they said well we'll
[1:11:55] just go through the formality of it
[1:11:57] because this is By Invitation you're
[1:11:59] applying for something that you're not
[1:12:00] even qualified for he said he told him
[1:12:03] he he said sir if you give me this
[1:12:07] scholarship you will be so proud of what
[1:12:09] I'm going to do with it I'm going to
[1:12:11] make your I'm going to raise your the
[1:12:13] the value of this class and I'll make it
[1:12:16] I'll make it you know he started talking
[1:12:18] and they couldn't believe his the
[1:12:20] confidence that he had they gave this
[1:12:22] this brother this scholarship gave him a
[1:12:25] scholarship just a couple weeks ago he
[1:12:29] uh he tested the highest in some uh
[1:12:32] class test that they had and so I don't
[1:12:35] know it didn't win a trip but they sent
[1:12:38] him to Washington DC all expenses paid
[1:12:42] he sent me a text Brother Israel how do
[1:12:44] you get to see the picture where the
[1:12:45] profet is I said where are you I'm in
[1:12:48] I'm in DC I said what are you doing in
[1:12:50] DC he says my school paid all expenses
[1:12:53] includ uded I won this thing in my class
[1:12:55] see when the blessing of the Lord is
[1:12:57] with you that's all you need that's all
[1:13:01] you need and so we've seen I've seen
[1:13:03] them grow so I really
[1:13:05] appreciate and and what I like is is a
[1:13:09] brother or a person are they teachable
[1:13:12] are they
[1:13:13] correctable and if they are you can work
[1:13:15] with them right no matter how bad or how
[1:13:18] rough or how tough if they're teachable
[1:13:21] approachable correctable then they can
[1:13:24] grow that's right if they're not then
[1:13:27] then no you can't do nothing with that
[1:13:29] it's too arrogant it's too much they're
[1:13:32] correctable they're teachable and he has
[1:13:34] expressed those qualities and I've had
[1:13:38] to we' have to Fellowship about some
[1:13:40] things before so and I say from the last
[1:13:44] first time he spoke to the last time he
[1:13:47] spoke I think he did a good job so amen
[1:13:50] oh I see some growth there amen and so
[1:13:52] when he talked about his wedding and all
[1:13:54] the things that's going on I thought
[1:13:56] well maybe he was so happy the brother
[1:13:59] uh brother um Robson and gave him a
[1:14:02] little card he thought that was really
[1:14:04] nice and the Lord worked it out for
[1:14:06] Sharon and I will be able to go to his
[1:14:08] wedding God willing that's the plan and
[1:14:11] I thought if you wanted to
[1:14:15] um put something together to help him
[1:14:18] with the expenses of the food in his
[1:14:20] wedding you could do that on Sunday all
[1:14:22] right so he's one of us he's not an
[1:14:25] outsider he's one of us so okay for
[1:14:28] brother bons and then for you hear me
[1:14:32] greet the Saints in
[1:14:33] Phoenix and um the little group there I
[1:14:36] know there's questions about what is are
[1:14:39] we starting another church there um
[1:14:42] what's going on there well the way the
[1:14:45] group and and I believe they're
[1:14:46] streaming tonight the way the group in
[1:14:48] Phoenix started was because brother AR
[1:14:53] with his job situation and and so
[1:14:57] forth he wasn't able to to sojin her
[1:15:00] here with us as he did before he's a
[1:15:03] deacon in our church all you I don't
[1:15:06] have to tell you how how faithful
[1:15:07] Brother Art was five and a half years
[1:15:10] even the weekday he was here solid
[1:15:14] 100% And so him and his family dilemma I
[1:15:18] love them so much the girls and you know
[1:15:20] all of them all of the Flores all of
[1:15:22] them but their their dilemma was okay
[1:15:26] how can we best serve for the art so he
[1:15:28] would stream the service at home and
[1:15:30] then he go and try to visit and he just
[1:15:32] prayed he fasted I fasted I prayed with
[1:15:35] him he prayed wasn't an overnight
[1:15:38] decision and and this is where he we
[1:15:41] talked about if he could um go to a
[1:15:45] place uh it would be easier for them to
[1:15:47] stream and that's where they go to the
[1:15:49] hotel and
[1:15:52] um and that's what we do for that so
[1:15:57] brother George is here been a big help
[1:15:59] he's been able to go I have gone
[1:16:03] they
[1:16:04] uh I've served them communion on the
[1:16:07] first Wednesday twice we've served
[1:16:09] communion to them on the Wednesday night
[1:16:12] because they couldn't be here sometimes
[1:16:13] brother Ezekiel is there as well but the
[1:16:18] the whole work is born
[1:16:21] from uh he's one of our
[1:16:23] brother arst and he's never stopped from
[1:16:27] paying his tithings and the tithings
[1:16:29] that and offerings that come in over
[1:16:31] there support itself this church is not
[1:16:34] supporting that group the expenses that
[1:16:36] come in over there they they never stop
[1:16:38] paying and that's what it is and I I
[1:16:42] don't know
[1:16:44] exactly what the future holds for it but
[1:16:48] I um definitely if there was a scripture
[1:16:51] or quote to show that we were wrong then
[1:16:55] I certainly would have gotten it by now
[1:16:57] I would have loved have gotten it by now
[1:17:00] but but um and and like I said Brother
[1:17:05] Art is one of ours one of our own so my
[1:17:08] heart was to how can we serve their
[1:17:10] family the best way we could and that's
[1:17:13] where this born from and there's a small
[1:17:17] group of others that have come that
[1:17:19] haven't gone to church you all know my
[1:17:21] position on prelighting I I'm very firm
[1:17:24] against that I'm not into that at all if
[1:17:26] this was a if this was a disgruntled
[1:17:28] church member calling me and they've
[1:17:31] have called me to come and to preach
[1:17:33] over here over there because they left
[1:17:35] this group and I don't go I wouldn't go
[1:17:36] to that this isn't that this is Brother
[1:17:39] Art and his family who was one of us and
[1:17:44] this is
[1:17:46] um this is where it is right now so
[1:17:50] that's I'm making you aware of that so
[1:17:52] you can pray for that situation I
[1:17:55] believe God has an answer I I believe
[1:17:57] that if if there is any proel liting to
[1:18:01] do it should be from the streets and I
[1:18:04] love to I'd love to see some folks in
[1:18:06] South Phoenix come to hear about the
[1:18:08] word of the Lord through that Ministry
[1:18:11] through this ministry and we just don't
[1:18:13] know how God is going to lead so what I
[1:18:15] do is you know if it this mistake God
[1:18:17] will correct a mistake but I can't see
[1:18:20] the mistake in the word okay and the
[1:18:23] other thing I was just listening I
[1:18:24] shared this to brother George and
[1:18:26] brother Joe I shared this with him as
[1:18:27] well I was just listening to the tape
[1:18:29] the other day and brother B was talking
[1:18:31] about how
[1:18:32] he was um going down to
[1:18:38] miltown and that
[1:18:40] sister um Georgie Carter was the piano
[1:18:43] player in his church which he said I am
[1:18:46] the pastor of the miltown Baptist church
[1:18:49] and then he said he was the assistant
[1:18:50] pastor to brother George Moore George
[1:18:53] Moore is that his name Jack Moore
[1:18:57] they're probably close to the same
[1:18:59] Southerners all the
[1:19:01] Moors no but Jack Moore and so you know
[1:19:06] what what does it what will it develop
[1:19:08] to I don't know I told this Brother Art
[1:19:11] and I'm willing to do whatever God says
[1:19:13] to do or not to do but I am not going to
[1:19:18] just close my door on my brother that
[1:19:21] has a need there and feed I'm not going
[1:19:23] to do that so I know it might be
[1:19:25] misinterpreted but God knows my heart
[1:19:27] and the other ministers they'll know as
[1:19:30] I get the chance to tell them as well so
[1:19:33] I trust that that will give you
[1:19:36] something to pray about to pray about I
[1:19:40] know you might think this I know this
[1:19:42] might come across your mind but to pray
[1:19:44] about it and then the the other thing
[1:19:46] I'd like to bring to you is that and I'm
[1:19:48] taking so much time excuse me is on the
[1:19:52] church building so I know there is I'm
[1:19:56] very nervous about it I might not look
[1:19:58] like it but I'm very it just very
[1:20:01] nervous about where's our building at
[1:20:02] where are we going and um with the
[1:20:06] school here they've been great to us and
[1:20:09] the way the time has turned it was
[1:20:11] supposed to be because the property is
[1:20:13] under contract to be sold something to
[1:20:15] that effect and we had like six months
[1:20:18] from so that would have been in December
[1:20:20] would have been our six months or so but
[1:20:23] that time has been extended because the
[1:20:25] contract didn't fully go through but the
[1:20:27] John helped out with finding out some of
[1:20:29] those deadlines and stuff and I
[1:20:32] just a little relief on that but then I
[1:20:34] started to think back how we found this
[1:20:37] church this building right here uh I
[1:20:40] don't know of another building of this
[1:20:42] square footage that we could pay what
[1:20:44] we're paying for this and and this was
[1:20:47] God that allowed us to get this place
[1:20:49] and I was you know same trepidation same
[1:20:52] nervousness same but this isn't my
[1:20:54] church this isn't my burden the Bible
[1:20:58] says to cast your cares upon Him because
[1:21:02] if if if you figure it all out you'll
[1:21:04] have the reward and the pride to say you
[1:21:06] know I thought of this and I had this
[1:21:07] under I don't have it under control I
[1:21:10] didn't have this under control the pews
[1:21:12] you sitting on was all God this bank it
[1:21:15] was all God the way it's all set up
[1:21:17] today it was the Lord that did that and
[1:21:20] I'm grateful to it so I'm going to put
[1:21:23] my faith in the one that has brought me
[1:21:25] this
[1:21:27] far and doing that is better than be
[1:21:32] stressing about things I don't have
[1:21:34] control over amen so I just want to
[1:21:38] refocus are we are
[1:21:41] believers we walk by faith and that's
[1:21:45] what we do and I believe the Lord has
[1:21:46] something in store for us I I don't mean
[1:21:49] we should be we shouldn't be Reckless we
[1:21:51] have to plan we should look forward we
[1:21:53] should pray and look and where I found
[1:21:56] this place I was looking at of schools
[1:21:59] because they ran out schools and so
[1:22:00] forth and the lady that was looking for
[1:22:04] schools for us to go to cuz we wanted to
[1:22:06] get out of that hotel especially when
[1:22:08] they're having swimming parties on
[1:22:10] Sunday
[1:22:11] morning and we need to get out of that
[1:22:14] hotel and then so the lady was looking
[1:22:15] she was like hey there's a building that
[1:22:18] used to be a church are you interested
[1:22:21] sure and she gave me the address and I
[1:22:23] pulled up I was like brother Caleb used
[1:22:25] to be in this building that's available
[1:22:27] oh yeah sure they were gracious and they
[1:22:30] let us come in here raised our rent only
[1:22:32] once we've been here for seven years if
[1:22:35] this was a land owner they would have
[1:22:37] been after us for this that and the
[1:22:39] other and I almost complained about the
[1:22:42] AC but then I think it could be a lot
[1:22:45] worse we're at a very nice location and
[1:22:49] it it's been good to us now I don't I I
[1:22:53] mean I could brag about it cuz this is
[1:22:56] what the Lord has given us and I could
[1:22:59] complain about it too but soon as I get
[1:23:01] ready to complain yeah know the sound is
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:06] horrible I'll take this over that hotel
[1:23:09] any day any day thank the Lord for this
[1:23:14] old old bank or whatever you you know so
[1:23:18] it's in God's hands pray with me I I'm
[1:23:20] praying I know the Lord has something
[1:23:23] for us if our heart is right if our
[1:23:25] motives is right he has something better
[1:23:27] than you could imagine sir I believe
[1:23:29] that so let's pray that way we'll pray

[1:23:35] us and so God bless you so much we'll
