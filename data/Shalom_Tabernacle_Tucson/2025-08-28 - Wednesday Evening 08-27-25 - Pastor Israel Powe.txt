As we stand here tonight, Lord, we ask you to forgive us of all of our sins, our shortcomings, our unbelief, Lord. Lord, let us come into your presence, the presence of your word, and to hear from you is our prayer. We commit ourselves to you this evening. We love you, Lord. We thank you. Ask your blessings now in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless each of you. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Good to see each of you. Billy, William, good to see you. Praise the Lord. Each of you, we like to go right into our scripture just uh for tonight. um while we have you standing. So happy to have you here tonight in um we'll take the scripture in Hebrews chapter number 12. in verse number five. We've been talking about training and um the orders of adoption and um uh moving forward into the new land that we're coming to the millennium and our reign with Christ and how he has to reign with us here in our heart so that we can reign with him over there and that everything we're doing and we're going through right now is the training mean that we're all in the training ground. Everybody is being tested. &gt;&gt; Amen. And verse number five says, "And ye have forgotten the exhortation which Moses speaketh unto you, as unto children, my son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him." For whom the Lord loveth, he what does he do? chasteneth and scourgeeth every son whom he receiveth. If you endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons. For what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers, then are you bastards and not sons? Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us. We gave them reverence. Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live? For they verily for a few days chasen us after their own pleasure, but he for our what? our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness. Let's read verse 11 alto together. Now no chastening for the present seemth to be joyous but grievious. Nevertheless, afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. Amen. One more Old Testament scripture. Genesis 14 verse number 14. And Abraham and Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive. He armed his trained servants born in his own house. 318 and pursued them unto Dan. I like the that those train those servants were trained. He armed his trained servants born in his own house. And that's what we're going to talk about for a few minutes. If we give it a title, we'll title it the training of men. The training of men. God bless you. May God bless the reading of his word. Excuse me. You may be seated. Now, we are all being trained right now. How many can say amen to that? Trained for a great battle, a great contest. I don't know how it came up, but I was started to read when Pearl Harbor had struck the US here um on the Second World War, the beginning of it there, and how our armies were not prepared. And it was a great I mean it caught us off guard and our planes our ships right there in uh on the coast there of Hawaii were um terribly attacked and damaged and we're a great nation and they were starting to work through some of the details on how and why I believe those generals that were in the Navy were were fired. they lost their job because of their lack of preparedness. And then I thought of this last um attack on the president when um they almost got him. They shot him and he turned his head a little bit and and that wasn't a game. That wasn't a for show. That wasn't for views. They almost took his head off. &gt;&gt; They almost got him. And it was then that our Secret Service came into view. And as we said, we don't really I mean, if we're talking about the Secret Service, that means somebody did something bad &gt;&gt; because we never talk about the Secret Service because they've done such a great job in protecting, which is as we spoke here some time ago on our immune system, how our immune system does a pretty good job. Those of you that are healthy, it's not because of your own. It's because God made your body to fight off germs and diseases. Germs and diseases that you probably don't even know the name of. And they're in every single public place or even at your home. Germs, diseases all over the place. But God put in your body an immune system that fights it off. And God has given his church the greatest weaponry to fight off any demon, devil, evil. Um so that the church, the believer is not caught off guard. &gt;&gt; And one of those defense me uh uh that defenses that he puts in there is forsake not the assembling of yourself together. &gt;&gt; It's a simple one. &gt;&gt; It's a long whole. It's an old one, too, but it it is so true. &gt;&gt; How many times has God spoke to you in the presence in an oldfashioned Sunday morning service, not regular meeting, special meeting, or even even a prayer meeting? How many times has he come down? &gt;&gt; And he made a promise that he would be with us when we come together. And so he is actually training us and equipping us. We do not come to church to see other people. &gt;&gt; We don't come to church to be seen &gt;&gt; by other people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that? Can everybody say how many how many didn't hear that? How how many know that's a reality? We actually do not come to church to be seeing other people. There's no scripture for that. Go to church to go see someone else. &gt;&gt; Or to be seen of other people, &gt;&gt; but he said when we come together, he said he promised he would be in our midst. And so on this trip to Colombia was a real blessing to me. As I went to all of the services, uh, my wife there and I and at the end there, they they had these little plaques that they give out for appreciation. And they gave me a a plaque for being a part of the meetings. Maybe on Sunday I I can bring it to you uh, and share that with you. This Sunday morning, Brother George Smith will be with us. I'll just announce that. He was already planning to come anyways. And so if I have a chance, I'll share a little bit more. But um I was just really taken back in their organization and the way they had things taken care of and the way things were done. And one of the um services, they asked all the ministers from the country that had been affected by brother Fabio's ministry to come forward. and it lined up I forget there was a few hundred ministers, pastors, teachers from the country all across the platform there. You know he's 80 years old. He he he's 50 years in the ministry and um he has followed this example out of the message taking sides with Jesus. And I know of some of the other churches, there's church groups around the message that use this um what they call an apostolic ministry where you have one pastor, he's an apos, he's an apostle, and he establishes other churches, sets them up, gets them going, and then they repeat and continue it on. Well, they get this uh uh this understanding. They get it from the message taking sides with Jesus. How many's heard that tape before? &gt;&gt; All right, we'll take a portion of it here tonight. We'll read from it. Well, in that message, taking sides with Jesus, Brother Brandham actually tells the ministry and the men in there to train young men that you see a call of God in their life. And he said that maybe you should set up an elder like brother Neville that would be like the leader among you and then the other churches come together and talk the deeper things of the scripture ministers and um and the like and it's a beautiful setup and brother Bandham says that's the way they did it in the book of acts he says so why don't we do it today this is 1962 too. And we don't see this format laid out very very well in many places because well there's probably several reasons for that. Um it it's almost the sense of when a person comes to Christ, they come to church and then they're sometimes left to figure it out on their own or we assume they understand what the next steps are. For example, the la the little sister that stood up and spoke in the service last Wednesday, remember her? She's not here, so I could talk about her. Um. Huh. &gt;&gt; God bless her. &gt;&gt; God bless her. Thank you. God bless all of us actually. And um she was not aware. Totally not aware. Had no clue. And after the service, I talked to Brother Joe and I says, "Maybe you can have your wife meet her and talk with her." Well, he didn't even have to do that. The next service, she came back. I didn't know I was supposed to get up and stand up in service and talk like that. It's just the way it went. Okay. And so sometimes we assume that people are learning or they're understanding. And many of us if if I told you you needed to be taught or someone to train you into something, many men get resentful of that. &gt;&gt; But I want you to take this tape in your own time and don't just floss over it because I mentioned it here. And don't let me play the tape for you to get it for yourself. That message, taking sides with Jesus, 1962, June the 1. The first, it's the whole message is good, but the first half he's dealing with ministers. And he sets up in order how young men need to be trained. &gt;&gt; Yes. And old ones, too. They need to be taught. There needs to be a training because we are facing the greatest battle ever fought. And when we come to the house of the Lord, the scriptures are given to us so that the man of God can be thoroughly furnished in the word of God. that the weapons of our warfare, they're not carnal. &gt;&gt; And you know, it's quite uh amazing how our Lord Jesus, he's the God of glory. He comes in the office of a baby and as 12 years old, as a teenager, he was subject to his parents. He was obedient to his parents and he is actually the Lord and God of glory showing us the example that as he was subject that we to every one of us here has to be subject to somebody. Sure. &gt;&gt; Every one of us &gt;&gt; and every one of us here has to be tested and trained and taught and ultimately it's the Holy Spirit that does the teaching and the training. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he uses men, he uses his word, he uses examples. And um brother Bam takes the scripture that we read in Hebrews 12 and he uses this terminology. He calls it child training. That we all need child training. We don't know it all. We've seen it where, you know, we've seen it where, you know, um this training um even even um the the scripture tells us don't don't be discouraged when he's training you. Don't don't get don't get offended when he's training you because he's trying to bring out the best in you. um we look at the circumstance or we look past it and really God allows it to bring something out in you. Can you survive in a hostile environment? Do you really need to be babyed in order to continue on? If all your friends leave you, are you going to quit? &gt;&gt; If the church turns its back on you and you don't get what you feel like you deserve, are you discouraged? All of these things happen. All these things happen in real time and they happen to all of us. How many's ever come to church and been disappointed? &gt;&gt; How many's ever been disappointed by Christians? &gt;&gt; How many's ever been disappointed by people you were hoping they would never disappoint you? But God allows that &gt;&gt; and our attitude and our atmosphere and the way we take that is part of the training. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me &gt;&gt; to be trained to be a soldier &gt;&gt; that can handle any environment you put me in. &gt;&gt; Not just the blessed Holy Spirit falling environments, &gt;&gt; but I'm talking about the hostile ones. I'm talking about the harsh environments, the environments where little water is, &gt;&gt; but there's no encouragement. &gt;&gt; The environment where um it's just hard to survive in. &gt;&gt; Lord, make me a soldier. &gt;&gt; Like one of these cactus out here in the summertime. They're just out there just like just standing. And they were made for that environment. You take a plant from the north, he couldn't handle it. &gt;&gt; You take a little baby plant that looks so cute inside the house, you put him outside, he can't handle it. And but the Lord is building and making and he's training men. Now, Brother Random tells us in the message Job, he says this in paragraph 29 says, "Moses looked over the lamb. He said, "Take a lamb, every one of you, for the house. It must be first put up and tried." Listen, you new converts. Now we thank God for many every night. And look, first thing comes along is a trial. &gt;&gt; As soon as you come to Christ, something's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Every son that cometh to God must first be tried, scouraged, whipped a little. But a few things happen to really try you out. Child training that's what it is. You believe in scriptural child training. The Bible speaks of training a child with tutors and so forth. Bringing him up, straightening him out, giving him what he belongs. That's what's the matter tonight. Preachers, preachers has let the congregation get by with anything. They need a little child training. That's right. That's what's the matter with the world today. The reason they got so much in the natural juvenile delinquency, we need some child training. I think it's a lot of parent delinquency. Paragraph 45, excuse me, in the message fellowship. I think it's the message fellowship. I think the sweetest scripture there is in the Bible is this scripture. Father, I sanctify myself because of them. He was a man. He could have had a wife. He was a man. He could have had a home, a place to lay his head. He had his rights to that. He was a man. He could have had good clothes. He was a man. But what did he say? Father, sanctify myself for their sake. What was he doing? He was training up 12 disciples that were going to preach the gospel in all the world. He put an example. And brethren, as ministers, I tell you, it pays us not to get too much of the world's goods and things hanging around us. &gt;&gt; You preachers I'm talking to, sanctify yourself for them that you're going to lead. That's what we need today is a complete consecrated sanctified life of ministers that walk upright before God does not entangle with the things of the world. Keep away from it. Father, I sanctify myself for their sake. Not because he had to do it, but he did it for their sake. So he said he was training 12 disciples. That's what he was doing. The prophet continues, "Belief from the heart." I think it's the tape. Every son tested would be sure that everything was tested perfectly before he put it in the bridge because of his character. I think brother Adam was talking about that that man that built the bridge uh in Sydney, Australia there. And because of his name, how much more how much more did our blessed heavenly father test every word that was ever said or wrote in the Bible? He tested every word, every prophet, and every son that cometh to God must be tested. The material that goes in this great highway, every rock, every material before it's placed into the body of Christ has to be tried, chasened. Every son that come to God must first be tried. No exceptions. Everyone, every prophet, before he could write in that Bible, he was tested by the Holy Spirit. How many thank God for this word that's proven to be tested? And &gt;&gt; thank God for the Holy Spirit and all the prophets and the prophecies. They have all been tested and so do you have to be tested. If you have not been tested, you're a child of God. You will be tested. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 34 and Why Christ speak? The prophet of God says this here, "What the schools had put in Moses 40 years, it taken 40 years to get it out. But one time in the presence of the anointing, one time in the presence of the burning bush, he knowed more about God than he had learned in the books in the 80 years of his life. God trains his men, then anoints them, &gt;&gt; gives them experience, &gt;&gt; takes them through the rigid training, down through the sands of burning punishment, trying, testing. Not only does he do that to his prophets, but he does it to his children. Every son that cometh to God must be chasened and tried, tested by his word. See, when the pinch come, the strong time, when it faces death, are you able to stand there on the word of God and say, "God said so." That settles it. So, we're being tested, saints. Everything you read about in the news, everything that's coming our way looks like a new situation, a new thing is happening. This one's getting arrested. This crime was committed. Now things are changing. Attitude, the laws are changing. Everything is us being tested. You are being put to the test, my brother and my sister. God's allowing the test over your life. And the test is there to prove um what kind of goods we are. Are we able to be a part of the material that he puts in the body of Christ? Can he depend on you to be that testimony in this late hour? You know, a lot of people are just jumping and doing their own thing, whether it's in the Bible or in the quotes or not. People are doing whatever they feel like doing. They feel like this is right. Yes, I've heard that, but I'm going to do my own thing anyway. That's all being put to the test. &gt;&gt; Pastors are being tested. Ministers are being tested. any officer of the church, anybody that's trying to lead a home, any father, any mother that's trying to lead a home, you're being put to the test. Um, any relationship, any young person, young people, you are being tested. And your test, I don't know about your test. I don't know what kind of test you've been. I had my test as a young person. I guarantee you the test that I had is in what you're facing. Um, it was hard for me, but I can't imagine the test that our young people are being tested with. A young lady being tested, young men being tested, your time, your loyalty, as we heard Sunday night and the great tremendous things that God has poured out to us. Everybody is being put to the test and somebody is going to give out grades. There's a grading time and there is a week. What if we were to give an account in how we performed as a Christian at the end of the week? What if there's a pop quiz saying I'm about almost ready? I'm getting ready. No, it's not about getting ready. No, it's time. The test is on. Will you pass the test as a Christian? You know, all these spirits that are in the land, as brother Bannon was bringing in our Sunday school, that the great holy fire will burn out all the demons and devils that are in the atmosphere, but he hasn't burned them out yet. So, they're there around all of us. You can't go anywhere. No place is off limits. It's not sanctified nowhere. Anywhere you go, you're going to see something. You might have determined in your heart to do what was right today. You determined to stay on the straight and narrow path. You determined that you wouldn't fall into those things again. But Satan will send you a text message or allow someone to send one or email or you'll see something or you hear something. It'll come up in your feed and that thing is there. I'm talking about the things you overcome. That thing is there to come back and let me check one more time to see if she's really got the goods or if he's really overcome. We're all being tested. Is that right? And um God has given us his word to train us. We are being trained right now. This is what the services are all about. This is what the Holy Spirit coming down in the meeting is for. When the Holy Ghost came upon Moses in that presence, he learned more about God in the presence of the Lord than all the years, the 40 years of training with the Egyptians. So his presence is where he trains us. &gt;&gt; So we want to come into his presence, don't we? We need to come into his presence. In his presence, he begins to unfold things to us, reveal to us, make things known to us wisdom. And his wisdom comes, he unlocks little keys to things, how to operate, how to prepare yourself, little warnings and little distraction that are coming up the road. The Holy Spirit is there to equip you for the battles that you're going to face that you're facing right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the praise. It's in the worship. It's in the anointing coming down. It's in the preaching of the word. It's in his presence &gt;&gt; that he begins to train us. &gt;&gt; That would be sad for me just to feel that presence and then walk out and didn't get any training. &gt;&gt; I didn't learn any maneuvers or tactics. Didn't learn how to fight better or strive better. that brain that word train means to teach a particular skill. It means to teach a particular skill and he's been training us. Here what the prophet of God says here in my last quote here that I have here then I want to go into taking sides with Jesus for a moment and I'm just about done here. Uh the contest 1962 paragraph 12. Now, I know that's an old saying, people. There's an old saying. It's not so old either. People don't believe in demons in this day. But the thing to do, to my opinion, is know your enemy. Know your enemy and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him. Because you're going to meet him. Know him. know what his strength is. Then train for this contest when you do meet him. For it's one thing sure you're going to meet him. So you train for the contest. Now training for the contest is just like a boxer. His enemy that he's going to meet out there in a contest to fight. A real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponents. Let me ask you this. How many young people here do not study? I'm not ask don't answer that question. I'm just throwing that out there. How many young men, how many young ladies that are Christians that don't study the word of God? You know, that's that's a um that's a a command. That's a demand on you to study the word to show yourself approved. Study is a part of being a Christian. Picking up your Bible and reading the word of God and then meditating on it. That's a part of your arsenal as a believer. You're not just I mean you're we're soldiers here. You know, the Apostle Paul uses sports. He's talking about training and sports and then he uses the military training training in an army. I give those analogies about sports all the time and the prophet uses one about boxing because we human beings we like the contests and we like a winner and a loser. We like a prize. We want a first place, second place, third place. We like these prizes and we like to grade one another on up our achievements. How fast are you? How can you jump? Can you throw darts? Who's the best in chess? Who's the best in checkers? Who's the fastest one in here running? Well, that would be me. I'm teasing. Of course, I'm teasing. But I'm kind of serious, too. Oh, no. No. But this is what we do, my friends. We did. We little pups, young pups coming up. We want to test and wrestle and find out. And the scriptures brings out this um uh playing by the rules. If you don't play by the rules, you don't get that prize. What if you're in the army? You don't train properly. You're not you're not a soldier ready to fight. And you are we are Christians today. We don't come to church and join a group of people that's going to heaven without a fight. We are in a battle. &gt;&gt; I'm in I'm fighting &gt;&gt; against somebody. I have an enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes, I have an enemy. And how would I know who he is? How do I train for him? How can I get this guy off of me, &gt;&gt; out of my space? He's always coming, always trying to catch me slipping. Always trying to catch me when I'm not prepared for him. It's a sneak attack. You know that Pearl Harbor was was a cold-blooded attack and when it got us it embarrassed our military. &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. I forgot how embarrassing that was. And we have all these characters of character of the Japanese and the jokes that the Americans would tell about them and laugh and joke and stuff. Wasn't laughing and joking when they dropped them bombs on us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And people got up and got upset and got ready. And then after that bombing, we became stronger than we've ever become because we learned a lesson, didn't we? 911 was another surprise attack, too. Really woke up the whole and the churches were full of fool Sundays after the 911 attack. How many remember that? &gt;&gt; How remember how god conscious we became as a nation? What happened to all of that? Where did that go now? &gt;&gt; Everybody wanted to pray. Everybody wanted God after that attack and we didn't see it coming and it coming and it it happened. And this happens to believers. This happens to ministries. It happens to people that are good people, good marriages, good homes, good men, good women fall because Satan hits them with a an attack they didn't know was coming and the oldfashioned prayer meeting has become optional. It's just a side service that I'll make it if I can. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if we knew the hour that we were living in, not only would we make it here, but we would gain the instructions necessary &gt;&gt; to build me into a soldier &gt;&gt; that can handle any attack of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Build me into a soldier, Lord. And we have to train. We have to study. I think that's a very good thing for Christians to do. Training for the contest, just like a boxer, his enemy that he's going to meet out there in the contest to fight. A real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent, studies his licks, knows where he fights for, whether he leans forward, hangs back, fights right-handed, left-handed. He studies all of this. And then if he's good, a good smart fighter, he gets him a sparring partner that'll fight just like his opponent fights where he'll know all of his licks when he gets to that place. And I think that's a very good thing for Christians to do. That's right. Now, if you want to start training, start with John 3:16. The golden rule. Start right out with that and that'll get you on the floor and then train for the knockout punches because you're going to have to use them. Everybody knows that you have to train to hit your enemy. And always God uses his word. We must remember that God uses his word to defeat his enemy. If God could think or could have given his people anything better to defeat the enemy with, he would have done it. So, as I've always said, when God makes a decision, the best that there is, he when God makes a decision, that's the best that there is. He never has to alter his decisions. So the first decision God gave his people, excuse me, in the Garden of Eden to combat the enemy was his word. They were fortified with his word. And now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word. And now Satan studied that all out so perfectly to when he come to Eve, he had the best strategy he could use upon her. And that was to reason with the word. And you never want to reason with God's word. Just believe it. Just believe his word. Is that right? Let's take a scripture in Colossians 1:28 quickly. It says this just to get a scripture. Where is Colossians? Say it. You don't want to help me out. Brother John. Colossians is after Philippians. All right. Thank you. Chapter one, verse 27. to whom God would make to known what is the riches of his glory of his of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man what perfect in Christ Jesus that doesn't happen without the teaching of the the word that doesn't happen without an acknowledgment of the word. Lord, I want to be perfect and I just want to I want to an angel or some mysterious happening just to make me perfect. No, his word is perfect. And you study that word and there's the perfection that you're going to receive comes through this word teaching us through the perfect word. We place our faith in that. We apply that to our heart and our life and that's where our perfection comes from. Whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. I take one more scripture 1 Peter 2:2 quickly. Where is Peter at? James, Peter, John, those three, those were the three that were on the mount with him, too. How many know that James 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse number one. Lay aside all malice and all gile and hypocrisies, envys and all evil speaking as newborn babes. Desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby. If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious. You know that John 3:16 that's the one of those baby scriptures we think and that's that first scripture that brother says to start training with that. John 3:16 that's the milk and we all need milk. But milk isn't the only thing. So as newborn babes, we desire the sincere milk of the word. But look at Hebrews chapter 5. We turn there quickly in verse number 13 quickly. verse 11 will take of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing. For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat. For everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word. This is a lot of Christians are unskillful. They're unskillful in the word. And skills are things you learn. You work on those skills. You memorize the scriptures that deal with salvation or temptation or so you can you be a witness to someone. You need to know your Bible. You need to know the word of God. Go through it. You read it and read it with a purpose. Read it as you're feeding yourself, but you're actually sharpening your sword and you're building up your faith and what you believe. Why do you baptize the way you do? Why are you go to church on Sunday and not Saturday? What are some of the questions that you believers come in contact with? Well, there's many Christians that are unskilled. And this is who Paul's talking to. He's not talking to the unbeliever. He's talking to those that should have been teaching by now. They can't teach Sunday school. They can't teach no how nobody come to the Lord. They can't teach. If a question comes in them, it's like, "Go ask my pastor. Go ask that brother. He knows." Well, you a brother too. You should know. You a sister, too. You should know, too. Is studying only for brothers only? Huh? Come on sisters, help me. Is studying for brothers only? Because if it is, I want the quote. I want the chapter. I want the tape title. I want the paragraph. For brothers are studying. It's for everybody. It's for Christians. The b the devil comes to all believers. We all get tested and we all being tried. And this is the greatest test that any other group of people that followed this message has never been tested. I can say this comfortably. I believe with all my heart. There's never been a group of people that followed this message that are being tested like we are being tested. Satan has really ramped it up. He has ramped it up on every level. You can't hardly even witness to anyone. They'll go online and they'll look up brother Brandham and the unbeliever has taken that name and they've done whatever they've done and it's just become difficult and very hard. They have judged the messenger and they haven't even heard his tape yet. And that's the age that we're living in. Hardest age to be a sister. Hardest age to be a brother. Hardest age to be a pastor, a minister. This is the hardest age to be a young person, to be a married person. How many's looking for a wife? Hardest age to find a wife, looking for a husband. Hardest age. Difficult, brother John. It's the worst of all the ages. Satan, brother says, he has reinforced himself. He's gathered up all of his tactics from the Garden of Eden. And I want you to listen to this for a minute. He's gathered all his tactics from the Garden of Eden after studying man, and he's reinforced it and brought it down into this age. But look what God did for us. &gt;&gt; He gave us a message like no other age. And it's stored up on the books. It's on the tapes. It's in your phone. But if you don't study, it won't do you no good. So we can study that. So, I'm not going to take time to go through taking sides of Jesus. There's some nice quotations in there, but um I'll let you do that. Did I finish that scripture? Hebrews 5:13. Did I finish it? He that had strong me. Um no, I didn't finish it. Verse 13. For everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But strong meek belongth to them that are full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern. What? Where does that come from? How does that happen? That happens through the skills of reading the word of God, studying that, being a part of it, read it again, hear it again. Can't get it all, but you can get something. The part you get, save it, retain it, believe it. God bless you so much. God bless you. What was the tape I encourage you all to listen to? taking sides with Jesus. Read one quote out of there. Brother Bam says this paragraph 83. And then in there, get training in your own groups, other ministers, men that you see that has a calling in their life for the ministry. Train them young men. bring them in here to the elder. All of you set together in a ministerial meeting and there teach the deeper things of God. Don't go on the bad end. Keep someone who you can have confidence in to be kind of like a leader for you that sometimes and brother Vanam continues on paragraph 84. And in there churches can go here and training up a group of men. If I'm in the evangelistic work somewhere, there's places I can place them worldwide. It was brother Bannon's desire to have young men trained and ready to go to other countries like India go there with a group of men and establish and strengthen the church. I want you to read that message and you ask you tell me where have you seen that done or even taught even talked and so um but it's still there still the quote is still there right amen God bless you the training of men we're all being trained tonight God richly bless you in the message or in the prayer request that we have is for brother Mike Wartz Brother Mike Wartz had surgery on his hand today and is in a lot of pain. Barb's brother Bobby Wartz is very weak and has started chemo treatments today. So remember brother Bob Wartz and brother Mike Wartz and was there another request that we had here that you had spoken request. Yes. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Text Roberts and brother Ted's knee replacement. Okay. All right. Someone else had a request here tonight like to make known. All right. So, always pray for one another. Pray for the services coming up week. Brother George Smith will be with us. Pray the Lord will bless those services. Also, Brother Bob's meetings are this week. They start on Friday, I believe. Or is it Thursday? I think it starts Friday. &gt;&gt; Friday. &gt;&gt; Friday. Yes. Brother Bob. a Christian or or landmark Christian fellowship having service. Pray for those services. The services in Mesa are cancelled this on tomorrow night and this weekend Sunday they are excuse me those services are cancelled. So pray for those brothers there. Let's all stand and we'll go to the Lord. And Jesus, look for his wonderful face. [Music] And the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light. Glory and grace. Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look for his wonderful face. And the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the line of his glory. And &gt;&gt; also remember brother Ben Surano. He um he had some thing going on with his eyes. They sent him home early from work today. So, he's not here tonight, but I know he would be if he could. And so, we'll pray for the Lord to touch our brother, heal him in his body. And those that you don't see that are here, remember them in prayer as as well. Amen. So, God bless you. The altar is open. You can pray right at your seat. God be with you. Amen.
