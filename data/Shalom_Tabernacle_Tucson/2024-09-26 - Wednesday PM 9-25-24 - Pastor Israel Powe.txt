already taken care of in him amen so we have no need to worry we just give him the praise we live our life we don't fight like they fight we don't stress over the things that they stress over because we're going to Eternity think about that so we're going to rush over here I'm going to be too late everybody's 30 minutes ain't the same 30 minutes he can stretch he can make your 30 minutes stretch out to get what he needs done in your life and everybody else trying to do their 30 minutes the way they want to do it and they'll never get nothing done because they didn't put their life in God's hands and so we thank God that we've done that this morning this evening amen amen we certainly greet each of you we're so happy to see you tonight we' like to go into the word of the Lord there's just three places in the scriptures Hebrews chapter 11 Romans chapter 10 and Deuteronomy chapter 30 Hebrews 11 so good to see brother George and sister Randy back and um each of you enjoyed the meetings over this weekend with brother Bates I thoroughly enjoyed that I believe it was the Lord speaking to us and encouraging our hearts amen verse one now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen take a scripture in Deuteronomy Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 verse number five the apostle Paul's bringing the sin for Moses described the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach amen take one more scripture in Deuteronomy chapter 30 really could read that whole chapter in Romans but the safe time Deuteronomy 30 verse number 11 this is the script scripture that the Apostle Paul was referring to that the word is n thee for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should us say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou sh should it say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it amen we pray God's blessing over his word actually let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we come before you tonight we thank you Lord for the opportunity to stand here with the elected the redeemed of the Lord that have been washed by your blood Lord we claim every promise that you've given to your bride in this last day and Lord though we may not see and even feel encouraged like we should your word is still true and we claim Every Blessing every promise you have for us raise us up out of whatever despair we're in if there's there's any negative or Darkness or just discouragement Lord just Lift us up we pray by Your Word tonight and encourage our hearts Lord we know that you've given this day to us it's a day that you made we'll be glad in it Lord and we'll worship you and we just pray your blessings now for each one the hearts that are on the stream and those that couldn't be here tonight remember them those that are maybe on their way we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated we've been talking about this whole man and being healed um but it sets up to what we had talked back in earlier this year in February March I I remember talking about a positive testimony and never letting your testimony be negative and that our words are seeds that we plant and I think I may made the statement that you need to go plant a garden plant go plant some trees go plant some things in your life and that planting happens through the word of God and brother random takes a message here in the message the resurrection of jerus 1954 and he says this now what is faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen you'd say that shirt is white yes well now if your faith says that you're going to be healed just as sure as just as true to you and just as real that your sight says that that's white there's no need of being prayed for you're already healed that's it you can go home so you're going to get well you can't keep from it see it's not just an emotional it's not something Mystic it's a fact a truth sight will fail everything else will fail but Faith Faith Can't Fail see because it goes into the supernatural Realms and it can't fail amen and um remember we were sharing with you and we listened to the tape I think on Sunday night no Wednesday night where brother Bram was talking to the doctor about and he told him they thinking about something good to eat and he said squirrel and pinto beans and then there's a reaction started to happen in his body he said what did that he said that that there w a wire in your brain sent a message down as he began to think about eating and this is this is the way our bodies are made and brother Brandon brings it out and the doctor tells him that the cases where Christians get these news that they're going to their life will be shortened or bad news and they just take the attitude well you know I got to go sometime anyways I'm going to heaven I'm a Christian I'm saved he said that attitude almost always retards the case because it's the attitude and it's the way we think brother bam tells us it's not mind over matter but it is a fact if you think something is helping you it probably is and if you approach something with the right attitude you'll get more out of it than with the bad attitude that's right that's right your your your waitress at the restaurant will say Amen to that just a good attitude is just beneficial for you it's your approach and this is just in the natural and and brother brandom brings this out and the scriptures brings it out to us they don't say that you know who's going to bring the word down from Heaven who's going to come from the sea to bring it to me so don't say that because the word is nigh thee it's already in you in your heart and in your mind Romans 10 goes on to say that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus that thou shalt be saved it's just a confession in in our natural you know the Natural Body you know your mind is here and your speech is here and your heart is here just just a short distance between what's in your heart and you speaking it out of your mouth and though we want to meditate on the right things and that's good and to read the right things and that's good but the confession is where it begins to take place when you speak it things begin to happen and this is these are laws as we've said before these are principles that God has established in his word he's established even in the laws of science they use certain laws like gravity and the different things that they use to to accomplish their equations to know how fast things travel how you know it's it's all God he he puts the universe together with atoms and there's a law there's an order to it there's a structure and when you go to study him he can reveal what that order and that structure is and when you do get that Revelation then you can operate better you'll know how to operate better and this is what science is they study nature they study animals they study people and then they come up with ways of doing things a bit better we the believer know that God has founded his word the Earth everything has been founded by his word he speaks his word and then it happens now a beautiful thing that the prophet introduces to us in um the message Jehovah Gyra many other messages he brings in the seven compound names of redemptions and the scriptures have it there very plain I'd like to read a few of those but before I do let's go into that enticing Spirits just one more time and brother random is talking about our soul our body and our minds and he says seek the first the kingdom of God I'll take paragraph 45 and he says this I I really believe this is very very important and I'm asking the Lord to help me and I pray that you would ask the same that these things will become a reality to you he says now all things ought to be considered prayerfully first seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul their thinking their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed so when we when he says churches think of individual that would be one of the most powerful individuals because when he's talking about churches he's talking about people why not me why not you be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed and as I've been thought on these things more and more brother George this has changed the way I Repent okay this has gone deeper into the way I repent and I'm processing what sin is you know of course you know we know the dirty ugly sins the outward sins malice enemies all those things like that but then when you start looking in the word and that word begins to examine your intentions and your motives so that's this has nothing to do with nobody else it ain't somebody else's fault the real problem is the man in the mirror and if if God can get if I can release my mind to God that where my soul my thinking and my attitude is lined up properly that's right right I'll be a better I'll be better in my Ministry I'll be better in my prayer life I'll be better in the way I handle you and everybody else so this has changed the way I Repent it's gone deeper than just you know getting by or look like I'm getting by because he sees everything anyways paragraph 46 he says watch for a few moments on the physical now we have many times and half for years we got what we call a lie detector you can put it on your wrist set it across their head and you can get in there and try your best to make a lie sound like the truth and it'll register negative every every time because the human was not made to lie lying is a deceitful hard thing evil thing I'd rather have a drunker with me any day than a liar see a liar and your body wasn't made to lie no matter how sinful you are you're still a fallen Son of God the most sinful person in the city today God didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or daughter of his you're made up in his own makeup but sin has caused you to do that and no matter how much you try to impersonate and try to make a lie seem right they got a scientific instrument that proves that it's wrong you can tell it with all the Innocence you want to but it'll still register negative because there's a subconscious down in a human being and that subconscious knows what's truth and no matter what you're saying out here that sub conscience know that it's a lie and it'll register off the subconscious therefore if a man or woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so lined up with God Amen until the channel of the holy spirit will be perfectly one with God what would take place if the man or woman could ever get lined up where with the freedom from their heart with Faith from the innermost so just think of those three rings the three rings that make up the man he looks on the heart we're on the inside God when it comes from the heart all things are possible then your confession meets up with your life your life speaks as loud as your confession does but when you confess says one your confession says one thing and your life lives another there's something wrong somewhere that's because you've got an intellectual faith and not of Faith from the heart and that shows that outside here is a knowledge of God but inside here is a demon of doubting I believe in Divine Healing but it's not for me see H it could be so but I don't believe it get it outside you say yes inside your conscience says no that same scientific thing would prove that that wasn't right prove it give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God first in everything I'll show you a man will be successful in the spite of all the devil can put on him he seeks God first now how many can say praise the Lord to that this is um this is so true so you know as we speak on the the confession and the words that we speak they mean so much and how your your words Ecclesiastes 52 says be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be Hasty to utter anything before God for God is in heaven and thou on Earth therefore let thy Words Be Few and the scripture goes on and says in Matthew 12: 3637 this is the Lord Jesus but I say unto you that every Idol word that meant shall speak can can you say Every Idle Word every is that every word this is Jesus he says Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned in the scripture so many places Proverbs 18:20 as we know goes even deeper now brother Ram mentions this here this a a quote that we all have heard before I want to read it again because it's still true and if reading the quotes make them less true then that's a devil that would tell you that actually read the more you read them the more they become more real amen because God is opening more to you this is in the message the law 1955 the prophet of God says this paragraph number 18 we'll go up just a little bit above paragraph 18 says so if we want a blessing let's be a blessing to someone else and a blessing will return like casting your bread upon the Water it'll return and that's true in all walks of life you'll find that you usually reap just as you sow so let's do good talk good be kind and people talk about us we'll say good things in kind things and good things will come our way if we'll give them out now Paul speaks speaking here of the Valley of the Shadow rather the law being a shadow of good things to come could never make the worshiper perfect then he goes on to show you what Perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I've got God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind mind if you can help it am I talking to anybody when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he can sure stop them from roosting and that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't don't don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confess that he has done it for you he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he said he's the high priest of our confession and we he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it can you say Amen now that's real negative thoughts come I mean they just come and sometimes they come when we're tired when we've been squeezed we been we we we put out everything we could and people don't appreciate us and then it happens again and we start building it up in our mind and it's just negative all around all of us are susceptible to that because we have a real enemy and the Battleground is in our mind but we don't have to permit it he says never permit it never permit a negative thought to just where you're entertaining it the scriptures Ephesians 2 says give no place to the devil don't give him any room to to start building something in your mind that's contrary to the word um you think sometimes it feels good to be a little NE we want to hold on to it we feel that carnal flesh of ours we want to stay mad just a little bit get into the emotion of being mad I want to feel this and someone wants to make it right with don't make it right with me yet I just want to feel this feeling and then we can make it right later you know we we ought to want to wallow in that yes sir and be justified in that because it's not pleasing to the Lord it not the Holy Spirit leading us to do do that and um he's given us the word it's nigh thee even in your mouth and in your heart and you have to confess that now brother bam brings this seven compound Redemptive names the scriptures do and brother Ram talks about it I'll just read them off there's the Jehovah Rafa Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Rah or Roy Jehovah situ Jehovah Gyra Jehovah shama Jehovah nii the Lord who heals the Lord is my healer the Lord is my peace or our peace the Lord is my shepherd or the Lord has provided a sacrifice the Lord our righteousness the Lord will provide my provider the Lord is there or is present the Lord is my banner Jehovah nii now these seven compound Redemptive names I like the way brother random puts it I got three quotes and then we'll we'll we'll go into prayer as we think about what these compound names are and what they mean and how they apply to us today here in the message uh 1957 Jehovah Gyra brother bam says this paragraph 15 I think of that sometimes when you're right in those Great Moments you see the god of Heaven step right in and change that scene oh it's so wonderful I think that the folks are home are praying now see we must we mustn't get in our minds that God just works with one individual he works with us as a body we're all one one's just as important as the other one we got to be together to make the body of Christ now I want to use my subject for just a little while if I maybe take my watch off that I won't get too long and I want to speak on the subject of Jehovah Gyra it's a very deep subject now Jehovah Gyra means the Lord's provided sacrifice now God appeared in the Old Testament in seven compound Redemptive names Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide a sacrifice Jehovah Rafa the Lord that Health all thy diseases Jehovah Manasseh Jehovah the armor the buckler the shield and so forth for seven compound Redemptive names those Redemptive names are inseparable you can't separate them because they each one apply to an attitude of Jehovah this is God's attitude each one of those um uh names of redemption apply to an attitude of Jehovah here what the prophet of God says in 1955 5 paragraph 18 He says here we want to make our quotation I have written out on the envelope here that carry the seven compound names of Jehovah in other words it was what Jehovah is is made up in the seven Redemptive names of his now God his attitude towards the people from Eden Back to Eden is wrapped in the seven Redemptive Nam names the first one be uh being Jehovah Gyra which means the Lord will provide a sacrifice the second one is Jehovah Rafa the Lord the Healer Manasseh our Banner Shalom our peace Roy is Shepherd our righteousness sham the Lord is present brother bam continues in the message Jehovah Jara 1955 and he says this my last quote he says this paragraph number five now I wish to continue my text and it was found in Genesis 2214 the text was Jehovah Gyra now God is God has seven compound Redemptive names now in these compound Redemptive names it was God expressing his present attitude for all his creatures what he would be for them in all all generations you cannot separate his compound name now in Washington DC my name is recorded it makes me they what what nationality I am who my father and mother was how much I weigh when I was born my description my prints my thumb you see it's the expression to the nation who I am and William brandom is recorded up there in Washington that's my the expression of me to the nation that is my name so when God came down from heaven to be king over the Earth he expressed himself to his subjects in seven compound Redemptive names Jehovah Gyra was his first name it means God will provide for himself a sacrifice the next compound Redemptive name is Jehovah Rafa Meine I'm the Lord that Health thee and he goes on Jehovah our Banner our peace our Shield our righteousness that's what he is to us so we can't separate those names if he still Jehovah Gyra he has to be Jehovah Rafa also he is he if he's our provided sacrifice he has to be our healer also so the names are inseparable we accept him as Savior we must also accept him as healer as our peace as our Shield as our Banner all these Redemptive names God's present attitude is to his people now the same now Sunday or two ago or few Services back I asked how many of us are saved and we would no problem can say we're saved if I ask you the same question how many of us are healed you think well yeah maybe I am healed or I'm kind of you know I'm feeling kind of bad maybe I will accept my healing well that's the wrong that's the wrong answer because just as saved you as you are you're just as healed it's not something that might happen it's not something that we're looking to take place it's not like a lottery ticket that you know God might smile on me and heal me no no no he's already Smiled On You and you're already healed just like you're saved the same blood it's in the same Covenant that he is my savior he is also my healer and these seven Redemptive names are seven Redemptive attitudes and I'll add one more to you there are seven Redemptive confessions that you ought to be making there're the confession that the believer should be speaking that the Lord Is My Savior My Healer my provider the Lord is with me he'll never leave me or forsake me all of my needs are already met in glory he has everything covered for he is my banner and this is the conversation of the believer because that's God's attitude towards the believer and if you can imprint these confessions into your heart and then speak them out of your mouth the word is nigh thee even in thy heart and in thy mouth and your body will ly up with that word this is not Hocus Pocus this is not a trick this is the word of the Lord this has already been settled it's called it's like the law of gravity but greater it's God created in the beginning he said it will be and it was let there be and it was and that is the word of the Lord to us that's God's attitude so if he is your savior how many of you saved tonight let me see your hand let me see that tired hand let me see that weary hand that struggling hand barely making it hand you can't get more saved Saints you either saved or you're not if you're saved today guess what you'll be tomorrow you'll be saved tomorrow and and guess what you'll be on the other side save what about your healing it's the same thing what about your peace what about him being your banner what about him fighting your battles what about him being your Shepherd what about him meeting all your needs what about him never leaving you never forsaking you I am Jehovah shama I'm always present that's the word of the Lord yes seven Redemptive names seven Redemptive confessions you know he is the savior and he is the Healer that's what he is he's the Healer and not only is he the Healer he is my healer how many can say praise the Lord to that and I can read to the Bible where he was someone healer he was this sister's healer he was this brother's healer I can look into this congregation he was this one's healer he was that one's healer but the confession isn't that he's just a Healer or somebody's healer yes sir but he's my healer my healer he's mine that's his attitude that's his attitude that's my attitude and my attitude is my confession if he's somebody's savior throughout the scripture he was savior to many and the many we know in this congregation he was a savior to them but not just that he is my savior so say it yes sir when the enemy comes in when the negative thoughts come say what the word of God says because the worlds were framed by these words because you're taking the words of the lord it's not your word it's not your strength it's not your power to bring it to pass it has nothing to do that that you can do within yourself you're quoting what the word of God said about you this is Jehovah's attitude towards you can I get an amen Jehovah Rafa he's my healer Jehovah Shalom he is my peace Jehovah raah Roy the Lord is my shepherd Jehovah sit Cano the Lord is my righteousness how many so glad it's not your righteousness the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down uh uh in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths of righteousness for whose name for his name's sake not for my name's sake my name has no righteousness but he is my righteousness my life was filthy rags but his life wasn't I was no good but he was good I wasn't worthy but he was worthy so his worthiness is now my worthiness by the blood of the Lamb That's My Confession now that's his attitude is my confession the Lord will provide Jehovah Gyra how many need the Lord to provide is he able is HE capable is he more than able yes the Lord is my provider I shall provide all your needs my God shall supply all of your needs according to his riches and glory the lord is here Jehovah shama that means the Lord is present he said I'll never leave thee or forsake Thee the Lord is always with you and Jehovah ni the Lord Lord is my banner the Lord is my banner you know that that Jehovah n the Lord is my banner was when Moses and the children of Israel were fighting against amalec and Joshua was down there fighting the battle and they started to lose and so Moses would put his hands up and as his hands got up then they begin to win the battle and then as he got tired they finally set him on the Rock and then they took two brothers and held up his hands and Moses couldn't hold up his hands he was too tired so two helpers held up his Moses's hand you say why was it Moses's hands because that's the way God set it up uh in other words y'all not going to win without Moses you're in the fight but you need somebody you need a prophetic covering so you can win this battle so they in the battle and you look up and you see Moses hands up oh yeah we got this if Moses hands is down it's like I don't know if we can make it when they in the battle fighting they look up on the hill they see Moses hands up it's like yeah we can do this boys and every time his hands was up they fought the Battle they fought they fought and they won the Victory and Moses called him Jehovah nii the Lord is my banner you need that on your job you know that you need that in traffic you need that in the courthouse you need that with the crazies get out here with their guns and their attitude they got attitudes but we got attitude too we have Jehovah's attitude and that attitude that the Lord is our Banner now they got a bad attitude and we can take a bad attitude and try to fight them but the attitude that God give us is Jehovah ni the Lord is my banner I don't have to fight F anybody the Lord's got my battles he's the fighter of my battles victory victory shall be mine if I hold my peace and let the Lord fight my battles Victory oh Victory shall be mine isn't that beautiful those are our confessions tonight that's the compound names they're Inseparable so if you're a little discouraged on him being a provider just always go back to that one you're sure of and that's he is my savior and if he is your savior they're compound they're Inseparable they all go together and he's all of these things to the believer at all times amen God bless you richly the Lord bless you give you what you have need of Amen so tonight we'll go to the Lord in prayer take time to pray Jesus just spent lots of time in prayer um as I said I've been repenting a bit different My Confession has been a bit different and you know my as I take inventory on the time that the Lord has given me here the time that he's given me that um you know it changes your how you'll pray and how you'll uh give your time and so we you know I talked about the other day if you you know how you can't sleep at night and you know it be nice to carve out that time and just praying Give the Lord a time in the we hours of the morning it's hard to do I've committed myself to trying to get up early I set my alarm but oh man this whole tired body is like man you do it next week we'll get it next time but you got to uh you got to kick the old man kick that tired man wake him up because there's something greater and you'll never there will be no regrets for the time you spend with the Lord in prayer there are no regrets now you can sleep too much and then you'll be regretful of it you can you can do a lot of things too much but you can't never what too much pray too much this is a little prayer meeting we thank God for the little place we have too pray we won't always have this time to pray we know that nothing stays the same changes happen we just don't know in in you know but tonight we have it so we thank the Lord for it and if um and we have more of more times that we can commit to the Lord in prayer and Jesus spent much time in prayer there's a whole set of quotes I have put together there where brother brandom talks about if Jesus the son of God had had to spend much time in prayer now he's qualifying it by an amount much time in prayer to fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more you are I and if you go back and you look at all the revivalists that had healing meet meetings and Ministries that God blessed them with as I'm going I'm looking at Oral Roberts and AA Allen I think AA Allen's son lives here right in the city somewhere I saw a testimony gave I don't know if he's still alive and then um um TL Osborne and these men would fast for days three days no food no water for their Healing Ministry that they had in an organization or denomination and God honored it and God blessed it and God was with him and then you look at brother brandham and the life that he lived and the time that he spent in prayer Jesus to and this is with the commission of an Angel minister to him now the lazy the lazy man doesn't want to pray that's right can I get a witness can we be honest we don't want you know to get down on our knees okay we we'll find a comfortable position to pray so we can slide right into our sleep but but I'm talking about me now now so don't get uptight with me I'm talking about me the the carnal man don't want to pray it's always a reason I got to do this it's too hard here you know it's not quiet enough it's too much I'll get it next time and so forth and so on but prayer is an absolute for the believer as we draw closer to him and if you want to speak to God and God speak to you you need to pray you there's no other way to do it you need to carve out that time and make yourself available to speak to the Lord get quiet with him however you do it a quiet time and spend time in prayer and let the Lord Jesus reveal to you secrets and things for your life keys for your soul for your life so you can overcome and I need that I need more of it God help us all amen if if this church would just increase in its prayer life alone my would it help us would it help our youth would it help when the preaching Goes Forth would it help the song leader you think you think it'll help the Sunday School do you think God might give dreams and visions and increase our healings in our midst for a church that prayed more what do you think it's all there in the word and it's free you can go get it tonight it's right there so Lord help us amen it's a little reminder God bless you

time so he's gonna fix it for me all right see I'll take this this white mic here um just want to make sure this it's on so um I want to describe how we caim the church and how we've done it for over the last 10 years uh we've asked uh two people each week to spend four to five hours cleaning the church and I just want to recog recognized those people that have blessed us for those years the king family uh both Sister Barbara and U brother Chuck they've been doing this for a long time and uh we're kind of running out of gas so we got you uh the PO family sister Sharon and and their family have been and uh cleaning the church and uh sister uh uh K and Carina would would clean the church and uh they after sister K passed then I've been helping Carina uh RC and her family they've been uh helping out uh now um the Morris family and Bazi family uh they've cleaned the Church also for a lot of years am I forgetting anybody thanks so we're going to change the format from once a week to cleaning it uh on Wednesday night so going from four to five hours but we want to go from to about 30 minutes and what we want to do is create uh a group of people that have about 10 to 12 tasks to occur to carry out and those tasks will be uh um dusting uh vacuuming uh mopping cleaning the bathrooms taking out the trash so what we'll do is most of the tasks will only take uh 10 to 15 minutes and after you're done with your tasks then you're done and so uh but if we can do it with a big group then we can really just knock it out quickly um so that's what we're asking people uh we want to get the whole church to do it we don't want uh just the people that have been doing it but we do want those people that have been doing it to train the new people how to do it so that you know because people won't know exactly what to not to not to uh uh do anything to this piano we know how to do that so there are some things that uh the the ways that we've been doing it so after church tonight

doing it we want to thank you all because you've done a great [Applause] job thank you brother Chris amen let's before we go let's sing that uh Holiness Holiness that's what I long for let's all stand
