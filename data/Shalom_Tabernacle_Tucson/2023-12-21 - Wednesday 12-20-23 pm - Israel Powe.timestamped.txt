[25:16] you it's in um uh
[25:19] 1965 uh before we do we'll read the
[25:22] scripture in second Peter chapter 1 if
[25:26] you take your Bibles and turn there we
[25:27] like welcome you to the house of the
[25:29] Lord
[25:30] always good to find oursel in the house
[25:33] of the Lord on a Wednesday night
[25:36] Thursday night Friday night whatever
[25:39] night you can find time to be in the
[25:41] house of the Lord I think that's a good
[25:43] time
[25:47] amen of course we know this is second
[25:49] Peter this is uh as we take the first a
[25:52] couple of verses it's dealing with the
[25:55] Statue of a perfect man I want to read
[25:57] from verses 12 through 21 I have two
[26:00] quotes I want to read and then play this
[26:04] portion of the tape for you tonight it's
[26:06] only uh 20 minutes but I trust it'll be
[26:09] a blessing to
[26:11] you this scripture in verse number 12
[26:15] Peter wherefore I will not be negligent
[26:18] to put you always in remembrance of
[26:21] these things though ye know them and be
[26:25] established in the present truth
[26:28] yeah I think it meet as long as I'm in
[26:31] this Tabernacle to stir you up by
[26:34] putting you in
[26:36] remembrance knowing that shortly I must
[26:38] put off this my Tabernacle even as our
[26:41] Lord Jesus Christ Christ has showed me
[26:45] moreover I will endeavor that ye may be
[26:48] able after my decease to have these
[26:50] things always in remembrance that's the
[26:54] third time he's saying that for we have
[26:56] not followed cunningly devised fables
[26:59] when we made known unto you the power
[27:02] and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[27:06] were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he
[27:09] received from God the Father honor and
[27:12] Glory when there came such a voice to
[27:15] him from the excellent Glory this is my
[27:18] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[27:20] and this voice which came from heaven we
[27:23] heard when we were with him in the Holy
[27:26] mount we have also a more sure word of
[27:30] Prophecy wherein to you do well that you
[27:33] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[27:36] in a dark place until the day Dawn and
[27:40] the day star arise in your hearts
[27:42] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[27:45] the scripture is of any private
[27:48] interpretation for the Privacy the
[27:51] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[27:53] will of man but holy men of God spake as
[27:57] they were moved by the Holy Ghost may
[28:00] God add a blessing to the reading of his
[28:02] word you may be seated just for a moment
[28:05] this
[28:06] um the uh the portion of the message I
[28:10] want to uh play for you
[28:13] tonight uh I'll give you two references
[28:16] where brother Branham as we were sharing
[28:18] with you on Sunday night a lan in the
[28:21] presence of the son and I titled it
[28:24] laying in the presence of the son of man
[28:27] showing
[28:28] that this great ministry of a son of man
[28:32] revealing the son of man in the day that
[28:36] you live in and how important it is and
[28:38] the reason why it's so important is that
[28:40] we see so many that are trying to flex
[28:44] against that Ministry and trying to
[28:46] bring it down the confidence and he made
[28:49] mistakes here this isn't true uh what
[28:52] happened at the bridge that didn't
[28:53] happen and this one we verified on the
[28:56] internet that didn't take place that
[28:58] didn't take place and so why why is that
[29:01] like that it has to be that way but when
[29:03] you have a revelation of what came down
[29:06] in our generation then you'll know there
[29:09] are no mistakes in what God does Amen
[29:12] when he sent a perfect word he sent it
[29:16] um for you to have a perfect faith in it
[29:20] amen I don't believe God wants us to
[29:23] read the Bible thinking that it there's
[29:26] questions in it
[29:27] or that is partially true or maybe
[29:30] that's not right I don't believe we
[29:32] should go to the Lord in prayer thinking
[29:34] that maybe this is right or maybe it's
[29:36] not I think those questions need to be
[29:38] dissolved and when we're listening to
[29:40] the message if it's the message of God
[29:43] then I don't believe the Lord wants us
[29:45] listening to that message trying to
[29:48] verify it by somebody online all right
[29:51] some other group of people or whoever
[29:54] whatever they've come before they've
[29:57] gone before but God has revealed to us
[30:01] this G glorious message and here Peter
[30:05] is getting ready to leave the Lord
[30:07] revealed that to him in verse number 14
[30:10] he says I I got to put off this
[30:12] Tabernacle the Lord Jesus showed me that
[30:15] so he knows he's leaving and he's
[30:17] telling the people to put these things
[30:19] in your memory and I played a portion of
[30:23] brother Billy Paul's uh that that dream
[30:26] that brother Billy Paul had had on
[30:27] Sunday night wasn't that nice it's a
[30:30] reminder to re to remember and so
[30:34] there's two places in the message and
[30:36] they're they've they've gone a
[30:38] controversy over the years but I don't
[30:41] want you to be afraid of any of these
[30:43] quotes and we'll get to the original
[30:45] when brother vom how this this
[30:48] terminology ride this Trail again
[30:51] there's three places in the message
[30:53] where brother bam is dealing with it
[30:55] it's all in 65 and the last two times is
[30:59] in the message God's only provided place
[31:02] of worship it's a morning service there
[31:05] in streetport and then in the evening
[31:07] service on the wings of the Snow White
[31:09] Dove and I want you to hear how brother
[31:12] uh I'm going to read this for you what
[31:15] brother vom says here this is at the
[31:17] beginning of the message he said I
[31:19] understand that in France this mornings
[31:21] there there's better than 2,000
[31:24] Frenchmen on a several day fast that
[31:27] will come bring the message to France
[31:29] and French the whole Protestant Nation
[31:33] Protestant part of the nation of France
[31:35] and so we are it's just begin blooming
[31:39] now just begin the Shucks pulling away
[31:43] so the weak can lay out there now see so
[31:46] just keep reverent keep praying see
[31:49] remember they that wait upon the Lord
[31:52] renew their strength now there's I was
[31:55] getting pretty old and and I thought
[31:58] will I will there be another Revival
[32:01] I'll see another time and just remember
[32:04] from the West will come a white horse
[32:06] rider we'll ride this Trail again that's
[32:10] right soon as we get ready it's a
[32:13] promise you
[32:14] see and then later uh in the evening
[32:18] service in in sh Port um Louisiana he
[32:22] says this in paragraph
[32:24] 225 this is toward the end of his
[32:27] message he said why me an old man
[32:30] suffered all my life why did he heal me
[32:33] now I believe I'll ride this Trail again
[32:37] I got to bring a message and I say to my
[32:41] father tonight as Junior scene in a
[32:43] dream the other night the wings of this
[32:45] Dove moving in these windows here Lord
[32:49] your servants reporting for service amen
[32:53] I'm ready and so I read those two quotes
[32:56] but those two Quotes come off of a Dream
[33:00] by Brother Walker and I let brother
[33:02] bandam uh give that um the importance of
[33:05] it in there it's clear he's wanting the
[33:08] people people to get ready that
[33:10] something's fixing to happen and look
[33:12] how he warns them to pay their debts to
[33:15] stop playing church because something's
[33:17] fixing to happen it's a it's a
[33:19] tremendous warning and um and you'll
[33:21] hear it for yourself all right this is
[33:24] in the message um so as we prepare to go
[33:28] there to this message in in uh paragraph
[33:32] 240 uh through paragraph
[33:37] 290 and that's in the message I'm sorry
[33:41] I can't see what message that is and
[33:43] knoweth it not and knoweth it not not so
[33:46] thank you musicians you may be seated
[33:49] we'll hear this portion of the message
[33:50] God bless you brother
