portion today as we commit the service and your fine care we pray in Jesus name amen Revelations chap 6 verse number one and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a Crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer amen let's sing only believe as we get into this portion of the word this morning amen only be only believe all things are are possible only believe only be only believe all things are possible oh let's sing Lord I believe with our hands raised to him [Music] Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe bless you you may be seated brother Brenham the church being caught up with those who are asleep Bene the Lord in the air and the rest of the church is carried over into the tribulation period they make nothing else out of it myself Enoch raptured no death now uh let's start studying a little now get down to L ice keep on that we never will get into the the seal now notice let's take now because we're going to have along maybe tomorrow night or next night get a trumpet now and then because the trumpet sounds at the same time the seals is just the same thing the church age opens just the same thing now a trumpet always denotes war or otherwise political disturbance the trumpet does a political disturbance and that causes War when you go to get mess in politics and get them all messed up like we got it now look out war is at hand but see the kingdom still belongs to Satan he still got this part in his hand because why it is Redeemed by Christ but he's doing the part of the kinsman redeemer taking his subject until the last one name is put on that book has already received it and been sealed away now you got it then he comes from his throne his father's Throne walks forward takes the book out of God's hand from the throne and claims his rights the first thing he does is call for his bride he amen then what does he take he takes his opponent Satan and binds him and cast him into the fire out there with all follow now remember it wasn't Russia no the Antichrist is a smooth fell just watch how smooth he is he's smart yes sir just take the Holy Spirit going in can out do him notice trumpets means political disturbance Wars Matthew 24 Jesus spoke of he said you'll hear of wars and rumors of War see all the way down through you remember this Jesus speaking that Wars rumors and wars and rumors and wars and come on down to the end now that's a trumpet sounding now when we get on the trumpets we'll go back there and pick up each one of them Wars and show you that they follow them churches show you they follow these seals wars and rumors of War but trumpet denotes political disturbance or as seals deals with the religious distur see a seal is open a message is dropped and then the church is always so set up in its own political ways and whatever more and all of its dignitary and when that real message drops down that messenger Goes Forth and he shakes into Jesus that's right it's religious disturbance when a seals open that's what's happened yes they get all at ease and Z the church gets all settled down and we got it all made just like the Church of England there all settled down the Catholic Church all settled down and longc come Luther there's religious distur yes sir sure was well the church went on office swingly and from swingly come on down to different ones and the Calvin and after while the angland church settle down and it was just at ease long C Wesley that was a religious disturbance right see it always denotes a religious disturb now the seal let's just read it a little bit now I want to get this this read it I get Talking of and I saw when the lamb open open one of the seals what happened and I heard is it was a noise of a thunder oh how I'd like to dwell on that just a few minute I hope now that all the people that know these things and are waiting for the consolation of the Lord will now study real close and on the tapes also that you'll think of this the first thing happened when that lamb broke that first seal of thunder roars now that's got a significance it's got It's it's got a meaning it's a meaning nothing happens without a meaning all right a thunder a thunder Lord wonder what that Thunder was let's read a little bit let's turn to Matthew no let's say St John first St John 12 chapter and just hold it a minute St John the 12th chapter and now let's begin with the 23rd verse of St John 12 now listen here I real close and you won't have to wonder no more what it is and Jesus answering them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified see you're at the end of an AG his ministry is ending the hour is come that's the son of man should be glorified what about the hour has come that when his bride must be taken away well the hour has come the time shall be no more the angel is ready to set one foot on the land and the other on the sea with a rainbow over him with feet and say times's run out and bide joh had raised up his hand and swore that time would be no more when this happened how how perfect is a warn affidavit to the church the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified verely verely I say unto you except the carnal wheat falls into the ground and dies and abides alone but if it die bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it un life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me where I am there also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubl you say well him coming to the end of the road and you got trouble what does it make you think when some great spiritual something happens that troubles you oh my now in my soul troubled what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I to this for this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again amen the people said that stood by that heard it they said it's Thunder then when the man took the book and broke that first seal God spoke from his eternal Throne to see what that seal was to be revealed but when it placed before John it was in a symbol when John saw it it was still a mystery why it wasn't even revealed right then amen it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but it come in a symble when the Thunder remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is a voice of God that's what the Bible a craap of Thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it part it was revealed to him see it was a thunder and notice the first seal opened the first seal when it was open in the symbol form it thundered now what about when it's open its reality it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back the seal and what did it reveal not all of itself first it's with God next it's in assemble then it's revealed three things it's coming forth from the throne first it can be seen heard or nothing is sealed up the Lamb's blood paid the price he thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out and it still was a symbol I watched he said it would be KNN in the last days but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it church amen it comes forth in a a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider amen and only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church notice now oh my that just makes me tremble I I I hope that the church truly understands it what I mean your people I'm going to call your bride yes that you understand it a voice is a Ponder The Voice came from where from the throne where the lamb had just left as in Stater now he's standing here to take his position and his clean but the thunder came from the inside of the throne thundered out and the lamb was standing out here the Thunder where the lamb had left left the father's Throne to go to take his own Throne amen Glory I don't miss it friend we all know as Christians that God swore to David that he would raise up Christ to set on his throne and give him an everlasting kingdom here on the earth he did it and Jesus said he that overcomes the Antichrist and all the things of the world shall sit with me on my Throne as I have over come and have set down on my father's Throne now someday he rises from the father's throne and goes to take his own Throne now he comes forth to call his subjects how does he go to claim him he's already got the book of rent Glory oh I feel like singing a hand soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side all the host of heaven will assemble be to watch that what will be a glorious sight all the saints and spotless white and with Jesus we shall Feast eternally talk about setting down in Heavenly places what will it be if we can feel this way sitting down here on Earth before the w comes in this condition that we're in now and we can enjoy stand up around walls and Stand in the Rain just to hear this what will it be when we see him setting there oh oh it'll be a glorious time left the father Stone came forth to his son to be the he is the son of David that's what the Israel thought he would do then you remember the serop woman said thou son of David remember blind Barney thou son of David and Jesus knowing what the plan was yet they didn't know it they tried to force him to make him take the throne and even pilot asked him but he said if my kingdom of this world and my subject could fight my kingdom is above but he said when you pray pray thy kingdom come thine will be done in earth here like it in heaven amen hallu how glorious the stra thing left the father's Throne to take his own drone he now has come forth from his intercessory work to claim his own Throne his redeemed subjects that's what he come forth from the throne to do it is then that the line like creature said to John come see what are you reading it one of the seal and it as if it was a noise of a thunder and one of the four Beast you know what the beasts were we tucked in one like a line one like a calf and one like a man and one like an eagle now this first Beast said watch each time is a different Beast so them four horse riders pass there four beast and this four har Rider notice each one of them Feast announced Matthew M Mark luk and John we're going to get back in and prove which one Matthew Mark which one Mark which one John each one as they went hello one out the Beast saying come see he heard the noise of the Thunder and one of the Beast said now come see in other words I hear stand the lamb and John stand out there watching it happen the lamb come up from the throne like had been slaying blood over him he was the one that was found worthy and when he reached over and Tuck the book then everything begin to shou and screaming and carrying on you see because they know Redemption was paid for now he's come to claim his own so he takes the bat stands out there before John and he pulls it back and breaks the seal amen pulls the seal down and when he pulls the seal down a thunder clack to the place and when a thunder no doubt John might have jumped up in the air when a thunder roared and then one of the four Beast said now come see what it is what's revealed beneath here oh John WR what you see so John goes to look see what it was John goes to see what the Thunder said it's then that this creature told John come see what what the mystery is under the first seal the Thunder the voice of the creator has uttered it he ought to know what's there oh but think now he wrote this but when he started to write those other seven Thunders he said don't write it he'd been commissioned to write everything he seen But when these seven Thunders over in Revelations 10 uttered he said don't write them at all amen there are Mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it do it'll get Faith for that Rapture and Grace for that church Mo we've just moved through everything that we know of through all the dispensations we've watched everything we've seen the mysteries of God we've seen the appearing of the of the great Gathering Together of the Bride in the last days but yet there's something in there that we just can't lighten ourself with there's something other but I imagine when that m my begins to come forth God said hold it back now wait minute I'll reveal it in that day don't ride at all John because it stagger over it just let's Let It Go but I'll reveal it in that day when it has even they never uttered for nothing no you remember like the little drop of ink everything is for a purpose everything were things for a cause but notice the Creator uttered and he uh he heard this voice and he went to see but now the lamb is showing John in the the symbol of of U of uh Church scripture like for the church know what to right just show now don't don't tell this just what it is don't go down John and say now this is just what this is now what's under this seven seal don't don't go down and tell that for if I tell John that then all down through the age the whole planet will be broke it's a secret he just wants he coming he said nobody's going to know when I'm coming I'm just coming that's all it ain't for my business no when I just to be ready you see so then he said now John went forth he thought I'm going to see it now and what did he do when John went forth he now what's he got to do now he's got to write this to the church age that's what he's supposed to do write it to the church agent right what you see of these seven golden candlesticks at the beginning write to this church and tell them all right and the Thunder went off John knew the voice of God and then the the lionlike creature said come see what it was John went forth now with his P to write what he was going to see now he never seen exactly what it was he never understood it but what he saw was what God was sending to the church for a time now he's got he will he always does he makes it plain when it's time to make it clean but he didn't make it plain then why because he's going to keep it a secret until the last age and the sounding of the last Angel's message was to get up these [Applause] Min make it clear but what John saw he just you know White Horse go out with a rider on it so that's what he wrote down when he did that's what he said come see so John went to see what he could see to ride to the church and when he did he saw a wine horse and him that sat on it had a bow and he went forth C to conquer and there was given to him a crown and that that's all John saw so he just WR that down now see that's in symol that's the way the church has received it but with the promise and at the last day he' reveal so what it is God help us to understand yes Lord Church agent but is not made fully known till the seventh message of the last Church age notice he starts this messenger of the seventh Church age if you'll notice it he doesn't start a denomination like the rest of them did you is he doesn't start no if you'll find out he's against it amen Was Elijah Was Elijah against it sure he was was John against it with Elijah's Spirit what kind of a spirit did Elijah have on him he was nobody knows much about him he just a man but he was a prophet he was hated my and what time did he rise right in the time of the popularity of Israel when it all went worldly and he got her out there and he was a woman hater sure was and he loved the Wilderness that was his nature and then people ought to know when that fell come out there with that same Spirit on him come out there this John not dressed all up like the celebrity as I said last night they kiss the babies

privilege to be gathered here I trust that the Lord will bless us with more of his presence amen amen God bless you we have a um a new member of the church to dedicate this morning and so if we don't witness to bring them in we'll just birth them in amen one by one and we know that the the Lord births into the church you know the membership and the qualities and the virtues but this is a natural birth and we're so thankful for it that the Lord has blessed the home of the Smiths and added to them a beautiful daughter and um and we certainly appreciate that and we love what the Lord adds to us and gives to us and this little child that come along in the life of brother Caleb and Sister Jesse ly we uh we certainly thank the Lord I've spent many times on the lake with brother Caleb and he's a very unique brother very special and uh when he was a single man I I know it was my prayer I know it was the prayer of his parents to see him married and see him settle the mystery has been revealed amen and that was Sister Jesse Lynn and it's been beautiful wouldn't you say it's just wonderful it's marvelous and so we thank the lord it's a great privilege and honor to be able to dedicate this child back to the Lord amen and so as they prepare to come I will read a scripture here in Mark chap 10 verse 13 and the Bible says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and bless them brother brandom says in the message God keeps his word he says now the Lord has given to you this little this lovely little one and now you are dedicating it to him putting it in his arms that God who has give you and you are returning back to him giving it to him that he might bless its little life and make it a life of service and make it pray and pray that God God will make it a child that will bless your heart when you're old and if Jesus T and be a great worker for God and you'll be proud of this little girl may God grant it now as we take her to bless her amen and so we're going to take this little baby Jewel waiver Smith and she indeed is a jewel I wonder if I can hold her for a minute if that'll be all right and oh oh she opened her eyes something might happen now I don't know we hold they're all beautiful amen God bless you Caleb Lord bless you richly sister jeline and we'll just bow our heads for a word of prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for this child you've blessed this home with oh God as the prophet said may it be a blessing to the home and Lord as it grows May the father and mother raise it under your tutorship and may if you T Lord may she be a great worker Lord in the kingdom of God and bless Caleb bless Sister Jesse Lyn Lord may you continue to use them and bless them for your service I pray I love you we thank you for in Jesus name amen this little baby is just squirreling is doing all kind of things in my arm right now so God bless her God bless you all right [Applause] amen amen praise the Lord amen so we like to go right to the word and we'll take I we'll take a scripture here and uh as I try to compose myself here for a moment all right you know babies do what babies do and I'll leave it right there all right so if you'll stand and take your Bible and turn in the scripture in Romans chapter 9 praise the Lord and in 1 Peter chapter chapter 2 and we'll take a scripture in Matthew 21 Romans chapter 9 and verse is right towards the end there in verse 29 and Isaiah said before except the Lord of Sabbath hath left us a seed we had been as Sodom and been made like unto gomorah what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of Faith but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law for they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen 1 Peter chapter 2 verse number one wherefore laying aside all malice all guile all hypocrisies enves and all evil speakings talking about that mortar we been talking about as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded amen we thank the Lord for his word one more scripture in the new uh in the uh under the gospels Matthew chapter 21 our lord Jesus speaking verse 42 Jesus said unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you talking to the Jews and given to a nation bring bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken but whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder amen The Headstone of offense is the title of the message this morning The Headstone of offense let's pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word this morning I pray you'll bless your people in a very special way way Lord move us out of the way and may you have your way as we pray remember the Brethren our friends and Phoenix Lord for the art and the families there all the visitors that are gathered here today and even our young people the youngest one Among Us may you grant blessings to each one we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated I see sister Maggie is here from Sacramento she's becoming a regular amen God bless you Sister Maggie sorry to hear about your brother we'll be praying for for him he passed on right so we'll keep him in prayer I know she was had been witnessing to him every time she comes here she's an old friend from Sacramento amen the Sacramento church and so headstone of offense and all of our other visitors we greet you our folks from Alaska and our different friends and it's good to see Josh back from his trip he made it back safely and each of you we trust the Lord will bless you um it's true the me the meeting on on Friday night was I thought it was success it was a good meeting for the Youth I think Levi did a wonderful job there speaking to them um and so I trust that uh someone's heart was encouraged and I was definitely was encouraged by some of the I heard and said there one of the points I I heard that Levi made it was it stood out to me was the difference between a decision and a commitment because your decisions can change you can decide and undecide but when you're committed to something and that's a bit stronger bit deeper and I enjoyed that and so we'll just pray the Lord will continue to strengthen him and um but this morning this headstone of offense actually we have been talking on the those messages the stature of a perfect man and this Great Pyramid the house that we're building and that this pyramid is a actually a uh witness of history The Church History it's a uh really a picture of who you are becoming those virtues are the virtues of Jesus Christ and as The Headstone nears and comes together there is a Unity that takes place that moves the funny things out from be in between the two stones so that the two actually become one and these are more than two stones there are seven stones that make this pyramid and then it's capped with Divine love and we've all been enjoying that have we we we think of we think of our life and how we can let that there would be no division in the body no schisms in the body but it's interesting in Matthew 21 how Jesus said that the the the the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to another and in First Peter that we read there the rock of offense he says that the Gentiles who were not a people are now a people of God and so we see this inheritance as we've seen it and we've talked about it how God has through the cross swapped the blessings from the Jews and put them on the Gentiles under this great salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ it was at the cross that this took place and so now we were not a people of God but now we are the people of God this is the season for it but that door is closing and we are in the day of the closing of the Gentile door where it goes back to the Jews again because they are his people let's be clear of that all the fighting going on over there we know who's going to win amen and we know there will be no peace no matter how many talks who votes in who who argues what there will be no peace until the headstone of Peace the Lord Jesus Christ comes down in there and fixes all those problems they'll argue they'll fight they've been fighting since I was a kid it's been in the news and it's been in news all of our life how many you know that's true it's always an uprising somebody who started it who whatever uh we know there will be no peace but we pray for the Peace of Jerusalem we pray for them we look at them their time piece they're a watch and it kind of tells us what's going on Amen and so we know that this uh Rock of offense Jes Jesus said that I am going to take this word and it's going to you you'll be replaced by another so let's take our and focus our attention a little bit on this uh lot that God has has given to us and I'm going to I'm going to I want you to take this lot for example as the time that's been given to you your space your time in life and and let me just clarify it just a moment uh today's group of people that's following the message there has never been a people to this close to the coming of the Lord like the people today right now another generation can take that claim later but now we can say there's never been a PE a people on the Earth that has followed the word that has followed the Lord that has been this close to the coming of the Lord I want that to sober you also I want you to to bear in mind when we say the message and what we're talking about how brother bam admonished us to study the message in the Statue of a perfect man he said take it and study it and compare it and then act upon it is that what he said that's what he said and let's be real clear them in 1962 acting upon on that as far as study is going to be different than us acting upon it and studying because we have more word I we have the word that's been um it's we can compare it we can highlight portions of the message we actually know how long the tape is going to be we can fast forward it and as I said some of you would want to fast forward me but you can't uh but you know after the message has been preached preach we can sit there and know how long this tape is know where the prayer line is know where need start the scripture reading who else was able to handle the message that way so when he talked to the people and says study it and compare it how about putting your life of study next to their life of study and I don't think um it's Apples to Apples in comparison we have been given the message in a format that we can study it now and we can compare it now it used to be brother Joe when I came into the message in order for me to study the statue of a perfect man first I had to get the tape all right and then if I wanted to compare it to Blasphemous names I had to get that tape but for example Caleb took it out from the church library so I have to wait till Caleb returns it back to the church library then I can get it and if he don't return it on time I got to wait another week I live through those times where wanting to hear a message was waiting constant waiting number one number two US listening to the message today then you can have the tape but guess what else you needed a tape recorder thank you so if your tape recorder ain't working in your car if you don't want to have one at home guess what you ain't listening to nothing you got the tape in your hand but it's a two component process that has been eliminated now we have the message instantly and I believe we're going to be held accountable not only that I believe we will be blessed because of it and we are blessed because of it if we can look at it that way so we've seen this change right before our eyes amen amen that's just technology that's just time and if time continues what more would we have before even in the last five years we'd say eight years how many were able to come to a church and actually see the quotes on the screen as it's being preached to you that happened right before your eyes and so these these are some of the points that is accelerating our time this is highlighting our our our lot in history okay and so our spot in history I cannot go back and refer to what pastors did 20 years ago I can't go back to that I look as a as an example I can glean from it the the Stepping Stones the mistakes and I can glean from it but my example is this word today present can I get a witness all right so let's go into the message uh turn on the light and brother Bram says this here this is just a little bit of a background and we'll go a bit further into this message paragraph 104 he says that's when 103 sorry like my hand here in a shadow it's a shadow only it's darker as my hand becomes more it's a negative here a positive here as a negative and positive gets denser darker darker darker and finally it claps together and negative and positive become one that's when church and Christ unites together as a bride with the same spirit that was in him will be upon her when the church comes from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost into the last days this is 1964 their last days ain't Our Last Days these are the last days right into the last days and honing her down now for the coming of the Lord oh don't be the rough part on it Pentecostal brother shine up with the word and believe every bit of it don't get out into these isms and things as we see going on today don't be astonished at that because the head Stone is coming crying ABA father pretty soon my God my God yes I believe that with all my heart do you see it you know what I mean it's Christ now taking the rags of yesterday the Lutheran Methodist Presbyterian and so forth and he's putting it through a process what kind of a process a process of the Holy Spirit what they had Plus making it till he is pressing his own image when the church and Christ become one in Union God granted so what was it was what they had plus do you have the plus the generations what they had plus do you think the other Generations would have loved to have access to the entire message I'm talking about in the seventh age I'm talking about 1966 on to the today do you think 1966 preachers would have enjoyed the the freedoms of being able to search the message the way we enjoy them today do you let's be for real yes it's a beautiful Freedom so we have what they had plus what are the pluses well you can fill in the blanks what the pluses are the pluses are are instant access the pluses are a more comprehensive study the pluses are I can compare where he said this statement once and then twice and then three or four or five times those are some of the pluses and what are the what does that do for me as a minister as a as a Christian believer what it does for me it puts me up closer to what brother bradam was saying we know he preached things that is own congregation did not understand we know he preached Mysteries and he refer to dreams that the congregation didn't hear the dream yet because they didn't hear the tape yet but now we're caught up to that now because we're hearing what he said all the way through the message I want to highlight the value of that I want you to see that that is a a unique place in history for the believer right and I want you to see that if they live holy without all of the search menu then how should we be living with all of the search menu look at the pictures of the sisters back then and then look at the sisters of the pictures today something ain't right we know more yes we can argue more yes but there's a difference something has changed what has happened does God words change no it didn't change it's still the same word but it makes us more responsible doesn't it amen so now it shows us that we are at uh what they had plus the generation before us plus let's skip forward and turn on the light and he says this here in paragraph number 109 so ought the Church of of Pentecost today asking who is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his light of his gospel ought to be shining forth with the word of this age revealing Jesus Christ to the nation just like it was then he was so filled with the wsh Revival till he was the wsh Revival we ought to be so filled with Christ until we reflect him in the power of His word that's lock it to us to this day so brothers and sisters we have a portion of the word that has been allotted to us please don't sleep on that please don't let that pass you by please don't ignore brother bram's admonition to study compare and add it to your life he said that and he said that to his congregation and his congregation I believe will obey him right and so the obedience is uh doing what he said to do if you believe me you keep my Commandments many people said brother Brandon we believe you're the prophet but they don't believe what he they won't do what he said do huh so the evidence in believing he's the prophet is to do what he said do now when he was talking to study it compare it and then apply it to your life was he just talking to the pastors was he just talking to the men no was he just talking to those that are in their 30s or 40s or was that for the young people too was that for a new church an old church a a church that's being established a church that's coming in the in its fullness of of perfection that's to all of us that is hearing the word and what was the message title the stature of a perfect man God's Building house that quo is meaning more to me than ever before and I hope and trust it means more to you paragraph 112 in turn on the light he says remember this is the seventh Church age the leodan church age according to Revelations 3 they reject Christ of every Church age that was mentioned in the Bible the Leo Dean age was the worst of all of them that's our age that we're in it turned him out rejected him put him on the outside did you see the Moon black out the other night before the pope went to Rome Rome to Jerusalem Jerusalem the oldest church the Moon is a type of the church always reflecting the light of the Sun in the absence of the sun and it blacked out I draw out that on the Blackboard here three or four years ago and show the churches hundreds and thousands of homes Across the Nation what was it a shadow the first time a pope ever left to come back here come in the name of Paul and so forth went down through those places had to bless the River to cross it and so forth what does the river need blessing what's what's the matter with this church age that we're living in today what would he say if he saw the churches today what's the matter with the church age that we're living in today can't you see it God declaring it in the skies declaring it in his word declaring it on paper declaring it amongst the people can't you open your eyes and see the hour these are they that Testify the truth this is the light of the hour what the great economical move is going into this Council up there now just for an image of the beast in Revelation 17 exactly what it said it would do you Pentecostal people going to sit still for that and go into it the forcing hour has come now is the time to rise and trim your lamps and shine with the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power as we heard on Sunday night amen is that right now is the time to rise and trim your lamps so why do people reject this Stone that's clearly been identified and I want to I just want to bring out a couple of ways that people uh will reject uh the stone or reject the word or the Revelation one way that they reject it is a very outward ver verbal rejection they'll tell you I don't believe it I don't see it that's incorrect I don't accept it it's very outward it's a matter of fact it's very clear but there's another way that we reject it and this is the more subtle way it's hard to identify it it's a way that many people can still maintain their Christian position and and composure but yet they're still still rejecting it through their actions this is a nonverbal rejection this is a rejection I don't know if you're getting it or not but your actions finally show us oh he's not getting it right right this is a subtle rejection and this rejection is um uh many times it's caused because we're uh we we we don't understand or we haven't been told more information as to what is being told us um this th this this rejection this quiet rejection it's in the heart it's in the spirit it's in the mind where we've heard the answer we saw it there we got next to the ark I sympathize with Noah I know he's a man of God I believe what he's saying is true but these are the people that came up close to the ark but they rejected it maybe not verbally but their actions prove because there is only eight of them in the ark and so when we look at the age of Noah the entire age rejected Noah now did the entire age write a letter of resignation no did they all publicly stand up and criticize Noah but by virtue of them not going into the ark they rejected it amen it's a subtle rejection it's a non-commitment it's a non-changing of your ways okay we see these two rejections and I believe we all understand what I'm saying right it's hearing the light seeing the light but not walking in it now brother random deals with this uh the teaching and he tells us in and I read this on on on Wednesday I'll read it again about Hebrews chapter 5 and there are some great tremendous truths that are in the message like like on the tape we're hearing for Sunday school tremendous quotes tremendous statements Let's Take One For example that I read for you on Wednesday night what about the dream of brother Billy Paul okay the dream of brother Billy Paul that brother Ram said came from the Lord look what it had in that dream just analyze it just a little bit now I'm not a prophet I can't interpret dreams but many times a dream gives you enough information to know that it's a warning and you might not be able to put it on the Blackboard and explain it all but there's enough details to know that somebody's in trouble or possibly or somebody needs to get their act together and that's what that dream did if you you you heard me read it for you is that right on Wednesday some of you did not I admonish you to hear that dream I think I let me give you a reference of where it is I had it here somewhere maybe later pardon me my I hate when I do that going to tell sister since you're walking in the back go get those quotes for me but let me see here but it it was in the dream there um probably on my desk brother Trevor but let's thank you but in that dream look at the components that were in it you're all Parton me I just misplaced things all the time I'm sorry so have mercy for me yeah there's a man huh man who could turn on the light thank you and in that message brother brandom says that brother Billy pauler dreamed in the dream brother brandham had eyes of fire so if you just look that up in the word you'll see that that's Revelations 1 there's a judgment there not only that he gave us a component of the scriptures in Daniel chap 12 where there was a stone heun out of a mountain that that had no hands and brother brandom takes that scripture and brings it that it's going to smash all of the Gentile kingdoms remember Daniel's dream the head of gold the brass the silver and then at the feet was iron and clay and this Stone heun out of the mountain without hands smashes the feet and it grinds it all together and that was Christ smashing the Gentiles to the end time that's speaking of of of our day and our time maybe it's on a printer clevor Trevor he's a clever Trevor all right and and these these components are there pardon me I hate that it's there yeah but I I needed those quotes but in that dream those components were there amen thank you yes sir I need to invite you into my office a bit more and you just know how to help me thank you pe and brother brand talking about how his son has dreams very often I won't take time to read the dream I'd like you to read it and then later on in the message he brings it up again but look at those components there's a a Stone come out it smashes this image and we see that there was the the coming of the Lord there was a a Time factor that it's too late now it's over and here this dream now uh maybe not fully interpreted on every single level but it there's enough in that dream for me to know as Brother brandham related it he said Lois it's too late for her to come the children are too young now even if it's my own daughter they won can't get her to pray it was just it was just anxiousness and he says you had that time before you've already had that time to get ready and so we see that this that the that this these dreams and how God will reveal through the through the dream enough for us to to accept it now now who would not be interested in what that dream meant that dream meant right who after hearing that knowing that it was at the end time knowing it was brother bam being used in this portion to give the final hour that between now and midnight the Lord is coming that was the final hour saints that was the closing time and so it's enough for us to to make ready and to look further into that but as it is with many other truths like that strong statements like that there are some people they hear it and they're not interested in going deeper to find out what significance does it play in my life and there's a reason for that now in the message um Hebrews chapter 5 brother is dealing with these uh those that are unskillful with the word and this is what he says he takes a scripture Hebrews chapter 5:3 he's reading from the 11th verse down he says therefore now the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again with the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk instead of strong meat for everyone that uses milk milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe I hope the holy spirit is taking that right down in the bottom of you for he that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a baby you give a baby strong meat you kill it that's the reason so many people say I don't believe that and walk away steal babies they just can't understand listen to this they can't grasp that truth it kills them Great Mighty things the church should know today but you couldn't teach it they they they they stumble over it they don't know what to do with it and it actually it creates a fear some of these great great great truths that people stumble over and now it creates a fear where people are not even interested like let's take let's take a controversial one let's take the the the vision of the T Vision brother Bam's T Vision now no one has a right to that quote alone there's no group that can franchise that quote there is nobody no Ministry produced that quote who's the originator of the vision first that's the question who originated the vision God sent the vision so if God sent it why should I be afraid of it somebody help me preach this morning why should I be afraid of speaking in tongues why should I be afraid of somebody getting blessed in the Holy Ghost why should I be afraid of an oldfashioned alter call Lord L God sent the gifts God sent the message God sent the Visions God sent the anointing so something's happened between God sending it and you being afraid of it Something's Happened there come on somebody Great Mighty things the church should know today but you couldn't teach it so so this teaching let's get into some of the teaching what the teaching does here here what brother Bram says here in the message marriage and divorce all right paragraph 284 this is an awful strong thing I didn't know how to bring it out what will I do when I got men women sitting in my congregation some of them has been married twice or three times good men good women all mixed up what done it help me preach false false teaching exactly not waiting on the Lord so false teaching is Kryptonite it's a killer a false understanding a false representation a misrepresentation false teaching created the tremendous problem in marriage and divorce that the prophet had people in his own church people in his own family people that had this issue had this problem and it's a great one it's a one of the problems of the day it's still a problem today yes and what created it was false teaching but let me take the other side to false teaching what about non-teaching people who are not taught cuz cuz the admonition was to teach your children not to go this way so a false teacher is off the word and a non-teacher is ignorant of the word oh my so they're like related yes sir one don't know and one refuses to know or reject it and I don't want to be in any of the camps I don't want to be a false under a false teaching and I don't want to lay on a teaching that's in Zion yeah that he's given to the church and me not enjoy the blessings of knowing what he's talking about this is the reason that the Holy Ghost is caught in this great battle today is because of of the teaching it's not taught properly can I go a little further here brother bam says here in the imparable Sin think of it paragraph 33 think of it no fear that's the greatest plague there is in the Christian church today is afraid and the reason they're afraid tell us brother Brandon the reason they're afraid is because they're what not taught right oh oh so fear comes from not being taught right is that what he said the reason that they're afraid because they're not taught right God have mercy upon us that's good no reason at all why this little place here couldn't be a beehive of the power of God buzzing with the glory of God flying from everywhere this little old hole in the wall here almost is known throughout the entire world this little spot you're sitting in tonight because not of William brandom but because of Jesus Christ who did it so here brother brandom is talking about the reason that people are afraid is because they're not taught and who is he talking to what church is he visiting in he's actually in the brandom Tabernacle who's the pastor of brandom Tabernacle I think the title ought to give you the name that he's the pastor of the brandham Tabernacle here he is in the brandham Tabernacle telling the people on the recorded tape that the reason why the people are afraid is because they're not taught right so let's explore down that just a little bit in questions and answers on Hebrews number one paragraph 57 brother brandham tells us paragraph 51 questions and answers on Hebrews number one he says now remember the Holy Ghost was not taught as the baptism of the Holy Ghost until after World War I we just celebrated our golden jubilee 40 years or the 40th year of the Jubilee so isn't that interesting that it wasn't even taught in the churches till after the first world war and then is isn't it amazing now how it's being taught then you see people start receiving it because it's now made aware to the people now there's always been people throughout all the ages that have received it but as a group as a whole the people were ignorant to it okay and they were ignorant to the power of God and bless blessings of God is such as all of us were until we come in contact with the message and the message makes us aware of really what the power of God is and what the anointing of God is in this little detail that brother Rood would even show us right there even that the gifts uh don't have anything to do with whether you're even in the will of God or not that the anointing can fall on a church and people can prophesy and be used mightily under a gift and still be false I I I don't know how valuable you don't know that that that is but that's very valuable for years people have have given people the right thumb of approval because of a gift in their life and then bypass all the false teaching and the ill living that they're doing only because of a gift but because the angel has come in our day and revealed to us that truth we can now walk and know how to handle a Gifted Man or a gifted woman that don't stay with the word right a dream that's not with the word we know how to handle it don't we why because we've been taught that amen so the value of teaching it's it's just tremendous as the Lord teaches you and the rejected King 1960 brother bam says this here paragraph 45 if that taking place tonight in every Church in the United States there would be a Revival in this nation I'll tell you whiskey joints will be broke up it will be one of the most grandest things that this nation's ever know if every preacher of all denominations would just follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and instead of some Creed or their denomination what some Bishop said or somebody else said somebody else said what somebody else said said has nothing to do into it God sent the Holy Spirit and he's our guide he's our leader but when they even see the Holy Spirit moving they get scared of it they don't know what it is it's a stranger to them because they're not taught in that line they're taught just Upon A Certain thing that the Church Believers believes and they go right like that and they go through life calling themselves Christians and go on with the things of the world and then when they come to die they say why my faith saves me so and people have their ideas about the dreams they have their ideas about God bless you little baggot God bless you idea about the dreams ideas about the gifts and they have these funny little feelings about uh you know what this is and that is it's because the way they're taught and if they're taught to embrace spiritual things they will be the benefactor benefactor of spiritual things like for example I'm so glad he did it he came down the Holy Spirit came down just before we came out in that last song how many felt that how many can see that the Holy Spirit was in that song he was in all the songs right he was in your prayer he was but this was a special anointing we all can sense it if you can't sense it that's you know God help you but most of us can sense that was the Holy Spirit he came past your Pew he came into your church he came into the song that you were singing but if you're not thought right you won't even lift your hands you won't embrace it you won't find out how God can feed you through that anointing Lord Teach Me How To Worship when you come into my church teach me how to praise you when you stop by my assembly glory to God Amen amen it's in the teaching you know the basketball game they get into the spirit the dancers they get into the spirit and they play another song and oh yeah that's my song and then the next song no that's really my song and then they start taking it get into the spirit and we come to church and think that the spirit is supposed to pick us up and force us to worship that's not a sacrifice of praise for a sacrifice of praise is thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for the word of God yes Hallelujah you got to be taught you got to be taught that and once it's taught to you you believe it then you will be the benefactor of it yes sir Lord if you come by my Pew one more time I will wash your feet I will wash your dirty feet if you come to my church Lord I'll make you feel welcome I'll put a smile on my face I'll whip up my hands I'll make you feel welcome am amen praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah praise God can we go a little bit further you know what's interesting and people say well I worship the Lord if if I feel like it I'm just kind of just who I am I'm kind of quiet but you're not quiet in all areas of your life when you get excited we've seen you we've seen you excited so don't run that one on me like the one brother said excuse me if I say this brother juel forny he said said the White Brothers tell them you black folks worship that way because you're black he says no I seen the prices right when y'all win a new car your hands go up you're jumping you're shouting had nothing to do with colored in it's about what you excited about don't try to run that on me no sir try to run that one in the message blasphemist names can you say praise the Lord paragraph 91 brother bam says this here now I believe that the reason that there is so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit is not correctly taught I believe that the baptism is taught and just say the baptism but then be like you say automobile but now I've got several mechanics in the church and I don't know one thing about it see if I make a mistake Brethren remember I'm not a mechanic there has to be coils plugs points Valves and everything that makes the automobile right Saints there's points there's plugs it might be a plug on page three there might be points on page 15 there's Sparks on page 32 and you got to go through that thing through that message and there is something for you it doesn't all come together at the same time but there's something for you and there's more than what you have right now that's right and so he the teacher has to accompany you when you're studying when you're reading and you believe that he's there with you so let's just take for a moment on the baptism now brother branner brings it out in those two messages that your birth into this your birth into this your birth into this how many remember that the seven births but let's go a little bit further than just the births there are baptisms upon baptisms and there's feelings and then there's refilling now I I know and I and I'll probably venture out to say this there's probably some people here in the building here that has never been what we call filled with the Holy Spirit and the idea or the thought is that the spirit is filling every fiber of you but it's not just maybe that's I would say it's a shower or the baptism of the Holy Ghost it' be like you being baptized in water and so that Holy Spirit comes upon you it's an anointing it's another atmosphere that you was in and that is what we long for more more of those in our Christian Journey um some of us have probably never felt what that is and I would say to you as a brother as a pastor as a I would pray for God to let me be baptized in the Holy Ghost one more time all right is that going to hurt anybody maybe some church folks are afraid of it but I'm not church folks Lord I'm your son I want to feel the blessing of the Holy Spirit one more time I want the baptism of the Holy Spirit to come down upon me just once more Lord I already believe your word I already a Christian but I want to feel your presence just one more time lord is that a is that an appropriate prayer is that a good prayer is that a righteous prayer am and so this is not a one time happening this is not just for preachers only this is this can happen to you this morning hallu another filling of the Holy Ghost so brother bam actually gives us an example of that in the message Lord show us the father let me take a a moment here and bring this for you show us the father 1953 paragraph one shall we bow our heads just a moment our heavenly father May that not only be from our lips but may it be from the depths of our heart Lord I believe and may today the Holy Spirit give us another baptism May our earnestness and the best that we have to give to God be be brought forward today he's he's he's actually praying to the father he's praying to the Lord see this is a prayer you're not looking around the rest of the church this is a prayer you're not worried about what everybody else is doing or not doing this is a prayer between a son and a father Lord send me another baptism another refilling of the Holy Ghost I needed in my walk I'm tired Lord I need it in my faith I'm discouraged I need another baptism Lord hallelujah the Journey's getting heavy on me I'm tired Lord I'm in this battle I've been tired I've been wearied I've been stressed Lord send a refreshing on me send it on my soul oh godall now that's a real prayer Saints and that's a prayer for the believer here what the prophet of God says here in the message the resurrection number 53 he says good oldfashioned Holy Ghost sent Revival men back to beli in the word of God that God will take care of us like he did in the old days he'll take care of us today do you believe that God will take care of us what we need today is another refilling another like the disciples three days some of you trying to test an experience or I trusted that they had 10 years ago that's all right but what about today you need one today today is the day sure a filling the disciples about three or 4 days after they received the Holy Ghost went back and got in one Accord and begin to pray again with one Accord until the Holy Ghost shook the building where they were sitting amen what we need why Christ speak 1959 paragraph 12 he says if you just accept him as your personal sa savior have not yet received the Holy Ghost I trust that tonight you'll receive it amen I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the big sister see one thing that the Tabernacle needs up there at our church at the Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost right everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church be filled with the power of God that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling David said one time ReStore in me the joy of my salvation not that he lost his salvation but the joy of it when it comes to a place that I can enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewhere because it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory I'm so glad one of them said taste to see that the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the Rock I'm so glad that I've tasted that the Lord is good I love honey a amen do we need another filling another baptism see you have to be taught that that's available to you not be afraid of it and don't be mad at at people that is getting it I mean that's a that's something you Embrace that's an opportunity when the Holy Spirit comes down that's an opportunity not to clam up but to open up knock the cobwebs off of your praise get the rust out of your your your your your your Hallelujah and your amens it flowing it's like anything else you get into the spirit but the spirit we're getting into is the holy spirit that great Capstone that's coming down to unite with the believer remember it's going to be a birth after birth after birth now in these baptisms the scriptures speak of the Holy Ghost and Fire in these baptisms of the Holy Ghost there is a cleansing fire that cleanses the sin from the heart of the True Believer it is part of the process it is how we overcome it's how we make the next step is how we get to the next stage is through another birth another baptism another T touch another Fire Fall in our lives in our hearts in our unbelief to make us more like him amen now we thank God for what we are today I love how brother George brought that Sunday night we're sincere but we want to be more sincere and we have the word but we want more of the word can I give you a scriptural example for a moment all right we're all sincere but we want to be more sincere turn to Acts chapter 17 we got into this Thursday night in Phoenix Acts chapter 17 quickly Acts chapter 17 I believe that's where it is look at these people here and I want you to classify yourself here acts 17:10 and the Brethren immediately sent Away Paul and Silas By Night unto Berea Who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews these were more noble than those in thessalonica and that they received the word with what all ready of mind and search the tapes search the scriptures daily whether those things were so therefore many of them believe also of honorable women which were Greeks and of men not a few so it's interesting how the Bible highlights the the men of Berea the people of Berea in contrast to the thes alians those of Thessalon thessalonia they were Noble but the men of Berea were what more noble why why what made them more noble were they taller were they shorter did they shout louder what made them more noble the same thing that'll make you more noble by searching the Scriptures Daily God sent you the scriptures so you can read them and then you read them and then you act upon them you believe them with all of your heart and you do that daily amen yes sir we need our nobility come on risen today on this great subject on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the great Capstone of perfection be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect is the age requirement but they have rejected it who is they the people the Ministries they have rejected this Stone and they've rejected it by a open rejection and they have rejected it by not accepting it and we don't want to be of that group that reject the word just with a casual cold shoulder or lifestyle of a lukewarm leoan the Leo Deans had so much they didn't need anybody to teach him they didn't need a prayer meeting Hallelujah they're so anointed they didn't need a h you know an extra service they didn't need to be a part of the special meetings they didn't need to come be a part of any prayer group they didn't need to fast I mean there's many Christians that don't eat I'm talking about people in the message that don't even fast yes what's nice about that prayer that we ask you to pray those that could Friday and Saturday is you're probably already fasting from 5:00 a.m. to 6: um breakfast is breaking of the fast you didn't have your breakfast yet I don't think um for most of us you know if you get up that early in the morning the last meal was the day prior so you get up you're on an empty stomach and then maybe you have to wash your face to get going right you got to get in the spirit you know you're going to pray for an hour those of you that did it and so maybe you took a shower to get woke woken up and then you take that hour and then you pray and the Lord does wonderful things when we do that and just think of that there's many people don't see the value of that or see the need of it of the day and it's because it's the way they are taught they're taught that tomorrow we can do it or we have a next day or just the spirit of the age has us you know just constantly putting things off but I'm so glad that the message is on the tapes and so I'm not out of line with what I'm bringing you because what I got was on the tapes and this is what the word of the Lord brought to us is what's on the tapes and so I don't have to be afraid of any of the gifts of the Spirit I don't have to be afraid of any of the quotes that people argue about or or get feel uncomfortable about why you feel uncomfortable when I say the tent Vision uh I could have said return Ministry but I don't even use that term but I said the ttin B what's the tent Vision well I don't know that's on you if you don't know oh I knew it's going to tight I didn't know it was going to tighten up but it tightened up brother and sister you got time to study that out go home and study it up for yourself and put in a tent Vision put it in there just study it oh if I do that I'm going to be a you going to be identified as a Believer if you do it exactly I use that one cuz that one is the sticky one that's the real aggressive one I you I love using that one because why what I got to hide for he said I didn't say it I never had a vision in my life he had the vision praise the Lord don't let people make you feel uncomfortable about a vision he had I feel uncomforable about some of these brothers Visions but not this one all right no sir say what the tapes say say what the Visions say and you hear those Visions they look complicated you just say Amen thank you Lord I'll receive what you have for me the part I need to know you'll open up what I don't know I still believe you I love you Lord amen can I take one more quote or two in the message earnestly contending for the faith brother bandam says this here here's what's the matter with you Builders you ministers standing out there that's what's the matter when they built the temple of Solomon they started putting the temple up and they found a freak Stone it was a freak quote everybody ain't smiling come on it's some quotes that will hey wait whoa what you trying to say there what's going on let me stop there all right let let me just let me stop there just to conserve time um but I'm going to take you to three scriptures in in the Bible and then we'll get to that another time all right on the builders the builders are the ministers and they're the ones who who failed to teach the people they're responsible and and it's all right here in the word I have it all right here and there was a freak stone that came and they got the building built so high and they couldn't go any further that's right and neither will you go any further until you include the freak Stone sir the stone that's been rejected the stone that all the criticism is around the stone that caes separation to them but it actually draws us together to be one with the stone The Headstone the Lord Jesus Christ amen so let's take a few scriptures as I close in Matthew St John chapter 7:43 good preaching God bless you St John 7:43 says this here and start verse 40 many of the people therefore when they heard this saying what's the saying what's the saying I'm going ask you a question it's a quote many of the people when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet others said this is the Christ but some said shall Christ come out of Galilee ha not the scripture said that Christ cometh out of the seat of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was so there was a division among the people because of him and there's still a division among the people because of him you see the picture we have in the foer there we had this company up the street here posters whatever framed that for us and they did a wonderful job the the man there I think he's losing his mind a bit now he came in here and we installed it right up here just to see it he was like what's with this picture what's he kept asking me that and I kept kind of shucking it I didn't answer him directly what's in that picture and then he he stood back he says hey there's a I see something in the picture sure he's still right there he actually used like a almost a semi swear word I mean he's a c he was a Catholic not that it's okay for Catholics to do that but he was like he beep he used a swear word there's a face in there see I see something I said what you see I want to hear him preach to me so bad what you see man yeah he said there's a face in there I said yes and I shared with him a little bit about the Angels coming down and he's like man I've never seen nothing like that in my life I wish some God speed and he went on do you see the face that's in there do you this has gone under attack here the last few years there was great division over over him in this message but we're not of those that are divided because of that we're actually gathered around it we're like that's the dinner table this something about to be said that's going to jump me off I'm about to put my praise shoes on I'mma run through here praising God when I when I hear he from this great headstone that's com in our day praise the name of the Lord we're not running from it we're running to it why because I've been taught to I've been taught to take one more scripture St John chapter 9 verse 16 verse number 12 then said they unto him where is he he said I know not they brought to the Pharisees him that a four time was blind and it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto them he put clay upon my eyes and I washed and do SE therefore said some of the Pharisees this man is not of God because he keepeth not the Sabbath day other says how can a man that is a sinner do such Miracles and there was a division among them we take one more and let's see St John 10 just right over verse 15 as the father knoweth me even so know I the father and lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold one Shepherd therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down I have power to take it up again this commandment have I received of my father there was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings so these sayings cause divisions amongst those that have not received these sayings and we're so glad that we're not being divided but we're being united don't you thank the Lord for that aren't you happy for the rock of offense to them amen it's a stumbling stone for for us it's the question to all the answers of my life it answered all the questions of my life was this headstone it didn't create a problem it created the answer for me it was the Lord Jesus Christ being placed in my life a stone that I had rejected for many many years and thought I can be better by doing this and better by joining Church better if I could just eat right or do right if I could just stop going out on Friday night if I could just stop running like this and stop drinking stop but over in the weed pile there there was a stone that I had rejected and in one day that stone was revealed to me and that answered all the questions in my life it will answer the question in your life today don't you believe that how many love the stone rejected by many but accepted by me the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word today we thank you for your people that's gathered around the word Lord I pray that you would break every Spirit of unbelief that would cause me to reject any truth that would cause me me to be of the crowd that would be a non acceptor nonacceptance through my actions through my coldness but Lord let me be like the bereans let me search the scriptures let me take them daily let me be more noble than I ever have been for these things where you have made it to where I can actually study the word and compare it in this day 2023 Lord what a time I can compare the message I can the sisters can compare it and in their lives the young people can compare ministers and father we just want to to take advantage of that today we love you we
