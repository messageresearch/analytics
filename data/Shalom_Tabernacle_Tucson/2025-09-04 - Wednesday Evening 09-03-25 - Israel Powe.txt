So happy to be in the house of the Lord with you. Like to welcome our visitors and all of the saints of God. Amen. So happy to have you here with us tonight at Tucant Tabernacle. Some of those folks are here. They're doing some remodeling and so I say keep on remodeling. We enjoy their fellowship. Amen. So praise the Lord. God bless you. We like to go. This is our Wednesday night prayer meeting. But we'd like to go into the scriptures in James chapter 5 for a moment. We'll take one Old Testament scripture, Genesis 14:14. The scripture says, speaking of prayer, let's take verse 15. James 5:15, "And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up. &gt;&gt; And if you have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. &gt;&gt; The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. Amen. We'll take one more scripture in Genesis 14. We read this the last couple of services, I think, but I just want to read it again. And when Abram, Genesis 14:14, heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, 318, and pursued them unto Dan. And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. Amen. Uh just for a title tonight, pray one for another is that title. Little prayer meeting. Pray one for another. God bless. You may be seated. This little uh subject of prayer is something that the Christian has to do and develop. To be a real good Christian, you got to learn how to pray. And it's something you develop. It's not something you do once or twice. It's a spirit you get into. And how many of us can say that prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; We know God has his will, his perfect will. And by the way, I didn't comment on brother George's ser sermon on Sunday, but he did an excellent job. &gt;&gt; I really really enjoyed that. It was a blessing. I didn't uh but he was talking about the will of God and how God has a will and there's a perfect will and a permissive will and we know that everything God already knows but he has put it into man's hands to pray one for another. Now this scripture in James chapter 5:e 16 says that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. I like it says confess your faults one to another. Pray one for another that ye may be healed. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And then the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. And then the scripture goes to say that Elias was a man subject to passions like we are. So he's bringing down that he had his ups and downs just like we do. And so a righteous man, brother Vanom tells us what a righteous man is. And in the message God's provided way or we'll take yeah God's provided way 1953 he says this quotes the scripture. He says, "The prayer of faith shall save the sick." And he said, "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man." Now, a righteous man is not a sinless man. For you notice, he said Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are. He had his ups and downs and his differences. And the scripture of his life proves that he had his ups and downs like we do. And he had his times of wondering and his times that his temper got away from him. And he had a lot of things there that went wrong. But he was still a righteous man because he confessed his unworthiness and believed in God. So that's what made him righteous. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of you have your up and downs? How many ever How many ever lost it? Lost your cool cuz everybody's cool, right? Until you lose your cool. And Elijah was like that. He was that kind of a man. And the scriptures tell us that the Lord heard his prayer and that this effectual fervent prayer uh that fervent prayer means uh an active prayer an efficient prayer a prayer put forth in power uh it's showing something that's working and the Greek word there breaks that down the effectual fervent prayer. Brother Bham continues in believing God 1952 and he says this paragraph 107. So therefore that's the reason said that the prayer of faith shall save the sick. An individual's prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. Oh, if you only knew that in your hand, Christ gave us the authority with his name by being Christians, the most powerful weapon the world has ever known. &gt;&gt; Prayer, it even changes everything. &gt;&gt; It'll change the mind of God. &gt;&gt; It did do it. After death was pronounced to a man, he prayed. God told the prophet go back and tell him I heard him. See there prayer. Hold on. &gt;&gt; In early spiritual experiences the prophet says this. Oh God you said the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man. And I know that a righteous man is not righteous in himself. But in trusting in the grace of Jesus Christ, I asked you to be merciful to her. And I said, "God, no more can I do, but I commit her to you." Now, that was a prayer brother was praying in Get the People to Believe, 1952, he continues. He says, "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for the other &gt;&gt; that you may be healed." &gt;&gt; The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man. Now a righteous man is not a sinless man. See a righteous man is a man who is confessing his sins in a righteous one. &gt;&gt; You see? See a righteous man. Now watch to prove it the next verse. And brother Vam continues on. God's provided way. He says this quoting this scripture again. Prayer of faith shall save the sick. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man. Now a righteous man is not a sinless man. For you notice he said Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are. He had his ups and downs, his differences. And the scriptures of his life prove that he had his ups and down. We read that one already, but we can say amen again. Downs like we do. And he had his times of wondering and his times that his temper got away from him and a lot of things there that went wrong. But he was still a righteous man because he confessed his unworthiness and believed in God. It's when it's when we try to justify ourselves, &gt;&gt; that's when we get in trouble. None of us are just. None of us are righteous. None of us have a a valid excuse &gt;&gt; for our bad behavior. &gt;&gt; But are you righteous? &gt;&gt; Are you righteous? You're not righteous in yourself. You're not righteous in your race or your nation. &gt;&gt; You're not righteous because of the church you go to or what you believe. &gt;&gt; You're righteous because you're confessing in somebody that is righteous. &gt;&gt; And that's what makes you a righteous man. Now, when that righteous man begins to pray, &gt;&gt; now something's going to happen. Now, &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a regular man. And I'm not talking about an unbelieving man. I'm not talking about uh disgruntled man or woman. I'm talking about a righteous man. And who is a righteous man? &gt;&gt; We just read it for you. Are there any righteous in here? &gt;&gt; If the righteous scarcely be saved, what's going to happen to the ungodly? There are some righteous people on the earth. &gt;&gt; And I thank God I'm friends with many of them. And if one of my righteous friends pray for me, I'm blessed. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's all I want. That's all I need is somebody righteous to pray for me because the Bible said the effectual fervent prayer, not just any man. Now, a righteous man availth much. &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. That's the message. Now the prophet of God continues here one more on this in the prayer line 1954 he says this here and you said the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man abelleth much and a man righteous is not sinless it's one who confesses his sins his he's righteous through the one he confesses through and I your servant confess my sins through Jesus thy son isn't That beautiful. &gt;&gt; I love that. That applies that scripture because, you know, we can look at that scripture and say, "Well, I'm not righteous. I made a mistake today. I was righteous last week, but not this week. I'll be righteous tomorrow, but I'm a little upset right now." No, no, no. That's not how Christianity works. If you're righteous, it's because you confessed in a righteous one. &gt;&gt; And if you're a Christian, you're a Christian today. And guess what? You'll be tomorrow. &gt;&gt; A Christian. And what about a hundred years from today? &gt;&gt; It's none of none of this. I'm a believer today, but no, I'm not a believer. You either are or you're not. &gt;&gt; And if you are, you're a Christian because you have confessed in a righteous one. Now, when that righteous man begins to pray, &gt;&gt; something begins to happen. Now, &gt;&gt; so we're just not we, you know, we we used to work out in sports. I played football and we had this one drill that we would um we're supposed to lay down on our back and press our backside into the pavement or the or the ground to strengthen our core, our muscles, right? It's one of those exercises that you can look like you're doing it, but you're not really doing it. It was a rest point. It's like it really if you did the exercise it would really help you. But with all the running around that was a break time for many of us our friends. We lay down we act like we're pressing our back into the pavement like strengthening our core but we were just resting. And I wonder if some of us pray like that. &gt;&gt; Like it's just like a nice quiet moment. Nobody's going to steal my purse. Nobody's going to mess with any of my stuff. I'm in a safe place. I just close my eyes and get a nice quick little nap. That's not prayer. &gt;&gt; Prayer is battles. &gt;&gt; Prayer is work. &gt;&gt; Prayer is unseen victories being won. &gt;&gt; Bringing things down, changing things in the atmosphere. Prayer changes things. And when a man or a woman, I don't care if he's a preacher, newcomer, oldtimer, when a believer gets down on their knees to pray, something is going to happen. &gt;&gt; Something begins to move. &gt;&gt; Something's got to take place. &gt;&gt; So, you see these saints pull over and they roll down. to go down on their their seat there or they maybe they're here at the altar and you know we have this it's quiet and it looks quiet. It looks innocent. No, there's something violent taking place. &gt;&gt; It's kingdoms of darkness being challenged. &gt;&gt; It's soldiers being made. &gt;&gt; It's real believers being equipped &gt;&gt; with prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can sing too much. We can preach too much. We can talk too much. But we can never pray too much. &gt;&gt; Prayer, the great weapon that God placed in our hands. Now the prophet says this here in the message, the token 1963, hold the token over your unmovable faith in his promise. Watch him go. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. See, see, take that token. That's what it's for. Satan is there to tempt you. So, when we go in prayer, we take that token with us and that effectual prayer of a righteous man. And a righteous man is the man that's confessing in a righteous one. When that man begins to pray with the token, something's got to take place. He says in desperations. We find out in James 5:15 that the Bible said the effectual fervent, that's desperations. Effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. When a righteous man, a good man gets in travail or soul travel or travail, either one. I think travel is a better word. Travail or travel. Either which one you want to call it. But when a soul gets in desperation and travailing an effectual fervent prayer of a man that can show the token, it does something. Look at this praying one for another. You know this Old Testament scripture, I've been reading it the last couple of services where Abraham Abram hears that his brother Lot had been taken. And the Bible says that he took his trained servants and armed them, 318 of them. And these were servants that were born in his house, 318, and pursued them unto Dan. And I like the scripture. I believe every word, every scripture has the details in there if you'll just slow down and read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes we read it already, but that's that's the problem many times. &gt;&gt; You need to read it again. And actually, you need to read it for the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; All of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And reading it over and over again doesn't diminish the power. To me, it increases the power &gt;&gt; because God is now witnessing that word to you. And I like that he took his trained servant. Did this take any servant? How were these people trained? What were they trained in? You know, he heard that his brother had been taken. The Bible didn't say he went and trained some soldiers and then went to go help lot. No, he went and got his servants that were already trained, the one that were born in his house, and gives the number 318 and gives the distance where he went to pursue them. Now, in the map, if you take where Dan was and where Abraham was, there's a distance there of about 140 miles or so. And then from Dan to Hoba was another 60 or 70 miles. This is 20 and something miles just looking at the map of him traveling to deliver his brother when he heard that he had been taken. Now, brother Bham tells us that Abraham was just a farmer. He says they were not fighters. They not they were not warriors. And so he he was just a an ordinary uh they they were just fighters out there, but they had to be able to protect themselves. And the scripture, the prophet says in possessing all things, he says this about Abraham. He stayed on that foundation promised word. He not an heir. He was heir. So he noted it. All right. After the promise had been vindicated to him, he had fellowship then with the promiser. I like that. After God made the promise, then Abraham had never had a test before. So he that kind. So he knowed it all belonged to him. And that was the promise. Yet yet he never had to fight an army. He didn't know nothing about it. He wasn't a trained man to fight. Abraham wasn't a fighter. He was a farmer. And Abraham could not do anything because he wasn't a soldier. His men wasn't soldiers. They were farmers. So the only thing he could do was just take God's promise. Put his faith upon the promise and move out and go after it. Then when Abraham seen that and got the promise and found out that God vindicated to him that he does keep his promise. Amen. There it is. &gt;&gt; And so we've been teaching here and preaching here about training men and how you're trained and but the training is not men training you. You're being trained by the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us in Galatians 6:1 that if a brother be overtaken in a fault, what are you supposed to do? Galatians 6, we'll find it here quickly. If a brother, brethren, if a man be overtaken in the fault, ye which are spiritual, do what? &gt;&gt; Restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Brother Ban says that Abraham was displaying or exercising in type the spirit of Christ when he went after a lot. Now this was not for any money. This was not to show off his skills and ability to fight. This was not Abraham looking for something to get into. He heard that his brother had been taken. So he goes to his men that were already trained and he arms them. 318 of them and they pursued after. Now when you read the scripture, you'll see that these there was three kings or five kings, I can't remember. three kings or four kings that had come together and they were taking each of these little towns and they traveled from the north coming south taking towns. Shelder was one of them and two or three other kings and they were just swooping up and capturing and taking and then they took Sodom and they captured Lot. These was a train outfit. These were real soldiers that knew how to take over and fight. They did it before and they were undefeated. They were undefeated until they took Lot. &gt;&gt; When they took Lot, they took something. The Bible says that one escaped out of there and ran and came and told Abram that your backsliding nephew, the one that gets on your nerves, the one that you got into it, your men and your men got into it. Y'all had to ser him. What's wrong, man? He's all messed up. &gt;&gt; He's in a He's in a spot where he can't even pray for himself. He can't help himself. And when Abraham heard this, he didn't do what some of us do. We say that's what he gets. He deserves that. But no, that's not what Abraham. Abraham trained his men, put his life on the line, pursued them to Dan, &gt;&gt; and then at night time he launched a night attack &gt;&gt; upon soldiers. &gt;&gt; The middle of the night, Bible says he divided himself. Say, you go that way, you go that way, you take the front, I'll take the back. You know, strategy. What we fighting for? The gold? No, no gold in this. Well, we going to take some property. No, we ain't getting no property. We We're going to put our name in the lights. No, no medals after this battle. It won't be no all stars in this battle. Won't be no shining names or new positions in this battle. What are we battling for? I'm praying for my brother. I'm going after Lot. &gt;&gt; I'm going after Lot. &gt;&gt; I got to go get him. And so he goes after him, pursues them 200 and something miles. What kind of car was he driving? It wasn't a Honda Accord. It wasn't a fine vehicle to drive, but he traveled those miles to go get his brother. And this is how we get our brothers. We get them by praying for them. &gt;&gt; Is there a better way? You think you can shame them to come to church? You think you can shame them or shun them to make them understand that you're right and they're wrong? You think getting into it with them and fussing with your family and going back and forth in these heated conversation, you think that's the way to do it? No. But prayer is undefeated. Prayer works and it works all the time. And prayer isn't just sitting down talking, mumbling a few things. Prayer is moving things. &gt;&gt; Prayer is powerful. &gt;&gt; Prayer. Prayer is stronger than the greatest fighter you can think of. going to these gyms here and these massively built individuals that are healthy and their muscles are big and they're they're a specimen of strength. You go to the Olympics, you see who the fastest human beings are, the most qualified, the most skilled, but really the strongest people are people that know how to pray. &gt;&gt; The strongest churches are the churches ain't the biggest churches. is the churches that know how to pray. The most powerful ministries, song worship leaders, deacons, trustees, or any member in any position, the best, the strongest ones are the prayer warriors. &gt;&gt; We call them prayer warriors because they fight a fight down on their knees. Amen. Now, when you pray for someone, I like that in James 5:16. Where am I at? Two more minutes. James 5, somebody said, "Take my time." James 5:16 says, "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth one much." And it says, "Pray one for another that what? Ye may be healed." There's something takes place when you pray for someone. Look at this quotation here. What the prophet says in questions and answers, paragraph 251. Now, we're all going to make mistakes. Just remember, and when you're looking at one another, don't look at the other person's mistake. See, don't do that because remember, you make mistakes, too. But look to Christ who is guiding this person. And if they need some help, then you pray for them. That's the way we get along. See, pray. And remember, when you are praying for somebody else, in that kind of a fix, God will honor and heal you when you're praying for somebody else. That's right. That's what Christianity is based upon. to help one another, do for one another, be kind to one another, understanding to one another. Now, if you see your neighbor's mistake, you see where they went wrong, don't go wrong with them, but just pray for them. Just keep praying and God will understand that he'll make everything right. In the message, Who is Jesus? 1964, brother Brandham says this. You see, when you go to praying for somebody, something goes to taking place. There is where we fail, friends. Not praying. Prayer is the key note. Ask and you shall receive. You have not because you ask not. You ask not because you believe not. Ask in abundance that your joy may be full. Ask and believe that you receive what you've asked for, then hold on to it. Don't leave it. If it's a promise in the Bible, if and it's been revealed to you that God is going to give it to you, hold to it. Now, this is what we want to do tonight. We want to pray one for another. Is that right? Because our prayers make a difference. Do you believe that? You have to believe that saints, you must believe that your prayer makes a difference. Many times the prayer request will come into an assembly and then we'll read that prayer request and we say, "Well, the pastor is going to pray and this brother's praying and that brother's praying." Well, the request was for the body of Christ to pray and your prayer is needed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman avaleth much. And so God allows us to pray this prayer. This effectual prayer is a prayer in desperations. Desperations is something you can't make yourself. But you can ask God to make you desperate. When the word of the Lord comes your way, that can make you desperate. The prophet of God says that even this age and all that has happened should throw us all into desperation. When we look at the age, we look at the time, we look at the hour that we're living in. If we're not desperate, I think something is probably wrong with us. I think if there ever was a time that the oldfashioned prayer meeting should the churches should be filled, that should be a time that those churches should be filled. Is it the oldfashioned prayer meeting? Because God uses that to accomplish his will. And Abraham did just that. He traveled from Hebrin to Dan and Dan to Hoba. And he was doing all this for the principle of saving his brother. He wasn't doing that for money. He wasn't doing that even for what some of us would do our good deeds for. You know, some of us if we did enough good deeds and no one told you thank you, you probably feel a little sideways, feel a little shafted or something. But really, Abraham, he did what he did. He put his resources on the line, 200 miles traveling on foot or however they traveled with 318 men. You have to account for water, food, and the care and the strategy of fighting. and the land is not yours. You you're working in the night. You got to come up with a plan. This wasn't a just a this was a this is a real deal. This was a task, but he did it. And what was he doing? He was displaying the attributes of Christ. And when he did that, coming back from that battle, the Bible says he met a king. &gt;&gt; And who was this king? He was a king that didn't have a father or a mother. You see, you can't beat God giving. &gt;&gt; And all of the sacrifices that you make, he sees every one of them. And there's a prize to be gained when you put your life on the line for somebody else. I mean, you're going out of your way to help somebody who's not worthy of your help. Think of it. That's Christianity. Not scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. No. No. You is trying to poke me in the back, but yet I'm going to pray for you. That's Christianity. You can't do that without a prayer life. Easier said than done, right? Can't do without a prayer life. The spirit of Christ has to be in you. What we going where? What we going to do? Abraham, we got to go get Lot. Lot who? My nephew Lot. We just got into it with Lot. He did his all day. He made his bed. He got to live in it. He made his decision. He He was wrong. He needs to come see you and apologize. Well, he can't apologize. He can't come see me. The boy's locked up. Let's go get him. Let's go get him. Come on. Now, now the Bible makes this detail and I love it. He says he takes his servants, brother John, that were trained, that were born in his house. This wasn't procelites. These wasn't outsiders with their own agenda. These are people that knew the master of the house. They were born here. They were raised here. And they had to know that this is just Abraham. This is how he does things. And they go after Lot. And they pursue him. Hard travel 200 and something miles a journey. Pursue them. Get them in Dan and fight them. And he not only fight them, then he pursues them. Dan is northern. and you you you pursue them all the way out of, you know, ran them off and come back and they want to give Abraham something. You say like, "No, just feed my men. This isn't about me. I don't need to be recognized. I did this because my brother needed it. That's what it that's why I did it. I did it because it needed to be done. It was the principle of it." And on his way back he met a king, King Melzdc, who blessed him abundantly. Gave him more than he'd ever would have. Cup running over. Lord, bless me like that. Bless me with an anointing to go after my brother, &gt;&gt; to go after my sister when they won't pray for themselves, but I will pray for them. &gt;&gt; Where they should be here, but they're not. But I'm here representing the ones that should be here. I'm calling on their name, Lord, like Abraham did. &gt;&gt; 200 miles. I wonder if we can give 20 minutes. 200 miles. I wonder if we can go an hour in prayer. Is an hour too long to pray? Well, we had a prayer meeting for a two-hour prayer meeting. Oh my. We have a two-hour dinner, two hour potluck or banquet, a twohour singing, a two-hour whatever. Two-hour prayer meeting. Who's going to be there? Huh? Roll up them sleeves. Son, roll them sleeves up. Take them slippers off and put some boots on. We're going to battle. I don't know how long we gonna be gone. We gonna be gone, but we're gonna go conquer something. &gt;&gt; Why? What's the prize? It's the principle &gt;&gt; that matters. Lord, help us. Now, God allows us to do this and many times he uses tension. And I'm going to close right here. All right. Was that my first 30 minutes? &gt;&gt; I'm still on. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I have plenty of time. &gt;&gt; Why y'all rushing me? God bless you. Let me close here. But tension. How many's under some kind of attention right now? Stress, heavy. And you think it's sister, her brother. He's heavy. She's heavy. You heavy. We all heavy stress. My stress just goes up every time I see you. Not you. I mean, people say that, you know. Yeah. You make my stress. I I just I don't know. Tension. You know, God allows tension for a purpose. And as a believer, when we understand that, then we use that as a key and stop complaining about it. But it allows us to move into that desperation that helps equip this scripture with the effectual fervent. Okay? So, it's not just a prayer, but the effectual fervent prayer of a right. We already identify what a righteous man is. You already know what prayer is. But what's the effectual fervent? That's a prayer under desperation. That's where the tension comes in. And let me bring that to you here just now. Brother Brandham says this in the message uniting time and sign 1963. You know what? Can we play that sis? Paragraph uniting time 1963 uh 8:18 paragraph 15 through 19. Let's let the prophet say. I don't know how long it going to take, but I don't think it's that that long. Take time to load. You got it. Thank you. Let's play it. &gt;&gt; Speaking of tension, I was praying about this morning. What would you do if you didn't have tension? Just think of it. Tension is part of living. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That kind of encouraged me when I thought that if you had no tension, you'd be like a rag doll. You wouldn't have no feelings. There'd be nothing you could work on. Like a husband and wife. Maybe she wants to do something and they're trying to work together. Especially Christians and the other want and then when you come together to you find out what she done she found out. See the tension really brings you closer together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And somebody tells you that well it said just think of the little wife that wanted her a lot of attention when he wasn't so good or the little husband wanted some tension when you wasn't so good. Then when it's all forgiven look how you feel about it. My you just see you got to have tension. That's all. And just think of feelings. What if you didn't have any feelings? No pain or nothing. Well, there'd be no pain at all. You'd have no feelings at all. See, and if you'd have no feelings, then one of your senses would be gone. See? So, see, everything's just right. Anyhow, so God, just give us grace to stand up to it. That's the thing. Just stand up with that grace and stand there and say, "We know that when this life is over, the great ones on the other side where we're looking to go to." And now we we remember that all these things that attention some people tries to introduce Christianity as you're free from where you're no you're free from tension. Oh no you add tension when you become a Christian. That's right &gt;&gt; because you was kind of a flop go happy golucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear from him then what's your own intention? put you on guard. That's what makes you what you are. So after all, tension is a blessing. &gt;&gt; This the way you're looking at it. That's the way you're looking at. See, if you just look the other side, there's another. No matter how thin you slice anything, it's still got two sides to it. You see? So you want to see both sides. So tension. I think, oh my, it's what's this tension? If I could have been born without this tension. Well, if I wouldn't had this tension, I wouldn't have been what I am. I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps. It was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ. So it's been a blessing thing to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the tension goes right into desperation. And Lord help us. I just don't want to pray a prayer. I want to pray an effectual fervent prayer. And I'm already confessing in the righteous one. And I believe he's going to hear my prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's pray one for another. You pray for me, I'll pray for you. We all pray for one another. Amen. God, may God richly bless you. There is a few requests we have here tonight that we'd like to take. Musicians come. Thank you. Thank you. This is from Sister Elise. My friend Sherry's grandson is suffering with radiation and chemo. He needs salvation. He is on hospice. 30 years old, two little girls and a wife. His name is Justin. Remember brother continue to pray for brother Bobby Wartz. The treat the treatment is making him very weak. Excuse me. Please keep his family in prayer as they support him as well. Remember, brother Mike works as well. Sister Lori Snow that the Lord will uh touch her and deliver her and bring her through her treatment and recovery. Amen. Is there someone else that has a request they'd like to make known tonight? &gt;&gt; Yes, sis. I'm going to be leaving for a few weeks to go see my sister Christie, but they've run all kinds of tests and she's been becoming crippled in her feet and can't walk and get out of bed and it's going on about three weeks now. She has good days and bad days. &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll pray for her. Christie. Yes, we'll do that. Someone else. Yes, brother Chris. &gt;&gt; My brother-in-law Brother, &gt;&gt; brother-in-law Troy Petty, real serious request. He's in the hospital. We'll pray for him. There's someone else here that had a request. But yes, sister Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's say praise the Lord. Thank the Lord for that, &gt;&gt; sister Martha. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, &gt;&gt; okay. Yeah, we'll pray for our dear brother. Um, the Lord will touch him and bring him completely. The Lord's brought him from a mighty long way &gt;&gt; already. I was reading this report where or actually brother Brandham says it and um that that when Christians are diagnosed with diseases that most of the time the doctors say that most of the time they do much better. They live a lot longer because they believe in in the power of prayer and that God is going to heal them. So their whole atmosphere is positive. And then when unbelievers get the same diagnosis and then they think, "Oh, I'm going down and negative," they almost always get worse. And so we thank the Lord for where he's brought brother Glenn so far and we just trust the Lord will take him completely through this cancer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Completely. &gt;&gt; Yes, sister. &gt;&gt; Sarahis &gt;&gt; Sarah. Oh, Sarah Gera. Yes. Brother and sister are driving home. &gt;&gt; Brother Lao and his wife are driving from Idaho for traveling mercies. Amen. There's someone else that had a request. Remember our meetings coming up.

But Lord, you've provided for every need. Every need, you promise you'd supply according to your riches. And Lord, we just ask you, Lord, forgive us for our unbelief. And we just are so thankful, Lord, for the encouragement tonight, reminding us, Lord, that we are righteous people. We're righteous men and women, and we have a right to take our pro our promises and our our our family and whatever it is, Lord, that Satan has tried to come and steal from us. Lord, we're we're claiming it and we're thanking you, Lord, for sending your enforcer. And Lord, how we just love you and appreciate your goodness to us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We just ask, Lord, as we go, Lord, that we would just help us to just be something different that people see in in us, Lord. It's it can be discouraging to to people that don't know you. And Lord, as brother Israel was talking tonight, those that are diagnosed with the sickness, those that don't know you and don't have that hope to claim on to, but Lord, may they see something in us that gives us an opportunity to share you with them and what you've done in our lives, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we just all need more of you. And we just ask you, Lord, just to help us to die out to ourselves so that you can fill us up with more of your love and more of your mercy, more of your grace that is manifested to others. Lord, we thank you for the opportunity to come and worship you this evening. We just ask Lord that you would be with us as we go. Keep us safe on the road. How we love you and we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Lord, brother John mentioned that what a friend we have in Jesus. Let's sing that.
