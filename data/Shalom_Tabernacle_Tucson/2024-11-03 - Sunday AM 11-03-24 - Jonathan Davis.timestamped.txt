[3:07] prophet the
[3:09] word faithful witness the Bible calls
[3:11] him a little
[3:12] later faithful witness is the prophet he
[3:15] was reations 153 and when he's priest
[3:18] now and when he comes he'll be king if
[3:21] you'll get over read Revelations 153 you

[3:49] Lord God Almighty just and true are thy
[3:53] ways Thou King
[3:56] of of the messah which was a prophet
[4:00] what was he on Earth
[4:02] Prophet how did the people know he was a
[4:04] prophet he done the sign of the Messiah
[4:06] which was a
[4:08] [Music]
[4:12] prophet how did they miss him because
[4:14] they were looking for something
[4:15] else and he' done the sign of the
[4:18] Messiah and they wouldn't hear it he was
[4:20] a prophet Moses said the Lord your God
[4:23] raise up a prophet like me they'll come
[4:25] to pass if they not hear this Prophet
[4:27] they'll be cut off amongst the people he
[4:29] was was a prophet on earth now because
[4:33] he was what the faithful witness of
[4:37] God's word came out he was God's word
[4:42] made manifest St John the first chapter
[4:45] in the beginning was the word and the
[4:46] word is with God and the Word was God
[4:49] the word and the Word was made flesh and
[4:50] God Among Us he was a true and faithful
[4:53] witness to God's Eternal Word he was the
[4:57] word
[5:01] and being the word he was a prophet for
[5:04] the word of God spoke to him only the
[5:06] thing I could do nothing Within Myself
[5:08] of what the father CHS me to
[5:10] do not me that doth the works but the
[5:13] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[5:15] works I am my father are one my father
[5:18] me Jesus the man the Tabernacle compound
[5:23] God got many titles Jehovah Jehovah JY
[5:27] RI Manasses oh many got seven compound
[5:30] Redemptive
[5:32] names got many titles R and Sh Valley
[5:35] Morning Star father son Holy Ghost all
[5:38] that but he's got one human name God
[5:41] only had one name and that was the Lord
[5:44] Jesus Christ when he was born Christ the
[5:47] lord eight days later the Holy Spirit
[5:49] called his name Jesus his mother had him
[5:52] circumcised and called him Jesus he was
[5:53] born to Christ like I was born to
[5:55] brandom I was a brandom when was born
[5:57] and give the name of William
[6:00] amen and he was born Christ the Savior
[6:04] and when he was 8 days old he was given
[6:06] the name of Jesus and he was The Lord Of
[6:09] Glory made manifest so he is the Lord
[6:13] Jesus Christ the god of Glory made
[6:16] manifest Among Us amen well there he
[6:20] is on Earth he was a prophet and Glory
[6:23] he's a priest coming he's the king oh I
[6:27] like that
[6:30] Prophet faithful witness of the word
[6:33] priest with his own blood before god
[6:36] king king of saints not king of the
[6:39] world he's king of saints we have
[6:41] Earthly Kings or than people but we have
[6:43] a king too and a kingdom that's the
[6:46] reason we act different like I said not
[6:48] long ago about my wife was going to the
[6:50] store up here and we seen a miracle
[6:53] almost in summertime a woman had on her
[6:55] dress I said that's a strange
[6:58] thing I said if I had my camera i' take
[7:00] the lady's picture see because we had
[7:03] first woman we s with a skirt on you
[7:05] know dressed like a lady ought to be all
[7:07] of she said well why is it bill that our
[7:09] people uh dress we're we're commanded I
[7:13] said it's not our people it's God's
[7:16] people God's people requires Holiness
[7:19] that's right said well don't they go to
[7:20] church I said there's a lady right there
[7:22] sings in a choir a certain church here
[7:24] well then why that I said because she
[7:26] isn't taught any different that's right
[7:28] exactly right that's that church call
[7:29] caral we'll get into this week Church
[7:31] Spiritual Church carnal they're all
[7:33] drifting right back to the manami
[7:35] churches the Bible said in Revelation 17
[7:37] they would do
[7:38] it they're returning back right now all
[7:41] of them acting like it organizing well
[7:45] we are certain we organize we're this
[7:47] and we're that it wasn't so at the
[7:49] beginning taking all the power out of
[7:52] the church and put it on a bishop or a
[7:54] pope God's in his church among these
[7:56] people manifes himself through the land
[7:59] and everywhere Hallelujah now but in
[8:02] this day she said well aren't we
[8:03] Americans I said no we live here but
[8:06] we're not Americans we are Christians
[8:08] our kingdom is of above if our lives
[8:11] come from up there then we act like that
[8:14] because we come our life is from a holy
[8:16] place it looks different it dresses
[8:18] different the women up there has long
[8:20] hair and they don't wear manicure on
[8:21] their face and they don't wear shorts
[8:24] they they wear skirts and long robes and
[8:27] dresses and they have long hair and
[8:29] things so the the nature of it from up
[8:31] there reflects back on us the man don't
[8:35] smoke shoe lie steel they come their
[8:38] spirits come from a holy place makes
[8:40] them act holy recognize one another as
[8:42] brothers that's it we have a kingdom and
[8:45] we have a king and he is the king of
[8:48] Saints and the word Saint come from the
[8:51] word of the Sanctified
[8:53] ones then when a person is Sanctified
[8:56] Christ the holy spirit moves into the
[8:58] heart and becomes king over that amen oh
[9:03] my go home hallelujah oh in the
[9:06] Sanctified desel of God Christ the King
[9:09] the Holy Ghost moves in and a king has
[9:12] his domain Hallelujah hey man if your
[9:15] whole being is ruled by the king of
[9:20] saints a kingdom than every Kingdom on
[9:25] Earth will be shook tore down by atomic
[9:27] power but the Bible says we receive a
[9:30] kingdom that cannot be
[9:34] moved hallelujah king of saints thank
[9:38] you Lord I want you to notice the
[9:40] symbols of Christ also in the Bible and
[9:43] here on Earth on the earth he was a
[9:45] prophet you believe that a prophet is
[9:48] the word we know that the word Prophet
[9:50] means a Divine interpreter of the
[9:54] word the Divine word is wrote and the
[9:56] prophet has the Divine spirit of God
[9:58] within him and you know the prophet in
[10:00] the Old Testament is called
[10:02] God how many knew that Jesus said if
[10:06] they call them Gods is it written your
[10:09] law they are you are Gods amen and if
[10:12] they call them Gods who the word of God
[10:14] came to the prophet how will you condemn
[10:17] me when I say I'm the Son of
[10:19] God because he was called God because he
[10:22] packed within in the word of God thus
[10:25] sayith the Lord hallelujah therefore the
[10:27] word Prophet means a his is
[10:30] interpretation isn't to be mingled with
[10:32] see if the God he says that there be one
[10:35] among you who spiritual a prophet our
[10:36] the Lord will speak to him what he says
[10:38] comes to pass and hear him because I'm
[10:40] with him but if it doesn't come to pass
[10:42] then don't hear him I haven't se him
[10:45] that's the way you know it and then you
[10:46] see the Divine interpretation of the
[10:48] word has to coincides with this last
[10:50] Revelation to the church he's God the
[10:54] almighty on Earth he was a prophet which
[10:57] is the eagle how many know that the
[10:59] prophet is considered an eagle amen a
[11:02] eagle is the strongest bird we got most
[11:05] powerful some of their wings stretch 14
[11:07] feet from tip to tip he can take and fly
[11:10] so high that if any other bird try to
[11:11] follow him he'd
[11:13] disintegrate feathers would fall out of
[11:15] him and he come
[11:17] apart because why he's built special and
[11:21] what good does it do him to get up that
[11:22] high if he can't see what he's doing
[11:23] when he's up there talk about a Hawkeye
[11:26] you see Eagle Eye
[11:29] a hul can might see a chicken that's
[11:32] right that's watch matter some of these
[11:34] hwks today but I tell you eagle goes if
[11:37] a Hulk tried to follow him he'd die he
[11:39] suffocates he can't get into those
[11:41] spheres that the eagle does and then
[11:43] he's got an eye that he can see so far
[11:46] he's got up there so that's the reason
[11:47] God called His prophets
[11:50] Eagles he gets up there and he's the
[11:52] eagle he can see well and Christ on
[11:56] Earth was an
[11:57] eagle when he died he was a priest so
[12:00] that made him a
[12:02] lamb is that right and when he comes
[12:05] again he's King so you'll be a
[12:09] line line of the tri of
[12:12] Judah
[12:14] amen he is a eagle a lamb and a
[12:18] lion amen Father Son and Holy Ghost
[12:22] Prophet priest and King he that was
[12:26] which is and shall come the Almighty
[12:29] Alpha and Omega from the beginning to
[12:32] the end the Eternal
[12:36] God I want to ask you some of you
[12:38] precious Catholic people who call that
[12:41] the Eternal sunship of
[12:44] God God Eternal sunship of Jesus Christ
[12:48] with God how can you say such a word I'm
[12:52] a dummy with a seventh grade education
[12:55] but I know better than that the word son
[12:58] has to have a beginning so how can he be
[13:00] Eternal and be a
[13:03] [Applause]
[13:04] son eternity has no beginning or
[13:07] end so it can't be a son and eternal son
[13:10] and then have a beginning because there
[13:12] is no such a thing as an eternal son a
[13:14] son had a beginning so he can't be
[13:16] Eternal amen you see he is the Eternal
[13:20] God not the Eternal
[13:22] son
[13:24] Glory
[13:27] Almighty Jehovah
[13:30] Jehovah
[13:31] RI made manifest in flesh in him dwell
[13:34] the fullness of the godhead
[13:36] bodily and on the day of Pentecost when
[13:39] that Pillar of Fire came down over the
[13:40] people did you notice it separated
[13:43] itself and tongues of fire set upon each
[13:46] one of them fire like tongues setting on
[13:49] each one of what was God doing
[13:51] separating himself into the church among
[13:55] each one giv the women the man and all
[13:57] of parts of his spirit
[13:59] dividing himself among his
[14:01] church how can a man come along and say
[14:04] the holy man is the Pope the holy man is
[14:06] the
[14:08] bishop the holy man is
[14:11] Christ the holy spirit in us how can you
[14:15] say the Ley has no word to say each one
[14:17] of you has something to say each one of
[14:20] you got a work to do each one of you got
[14:22] to carry a
[14:24] message the Holy Ghost separated itself
[14:26] on the day of Pentecost God separating
[14:28] him
[14:30] that day you'll know that I in the
[14:32] Father the father me I and you and you
[14:33] and
[14:34] me that day the Holy Spirit
[14:38] overall in all through all amen there is
[14:44] the holy spirit has a right to move
[14:45] anywhere that he wants to upon anybody
[14:47] he wants to you don't have to take what
[14:49] some bishop or some priest says he's our
[14:52] only
[14:53] priest right a high priest now Prophet
[14:57] priest and King
[14:59] now and Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[15:03] witness the first begotten of the dead
[15:06] again and the prince of the kings of the
[15:08] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[15:11] us from our sins in his own blood the
[15:16] word wash there actually in the Greek
[15:18] means to loose he loosed us from our we
[15:21] were tied to the Earth by our sins we
[15:25] couldn't see couldn't hear had no
[15:27] conception of Heaven or nothing but when
[15:29] the blood came down it cut the
[15:32] line and we got
[15:37] loosed I read a story one time it's uh
[15:40] may fit in good right here a farmer
[15:43] called a crow and he tied him and he
[15:46] said I'll teach the other crows a lesson
[15:49] so he tied the old crow and by leg with
[15:51] a string and a poor old thing like
[15:53] starve to death is so weak it could
[15:54] hardly walk around that's what some of
[15:56] these organizations and churches is tied
[15:58] to people people down just can't well
[16:01] this is all for you can go days of
[16:02] Miracles just pass yet you're just tied
[16:04] that's all there is no such thing as the
[16:07] Holy Ghost he don't speak in tongues

[21:36] won't get angry move away through the
[21:38] weak you you get the ni councils uh get
[21:41] the host to Bab get now Josephus history
[21:44] is all right but he only wrote one
[21:46] paragraph of Christ said there was a man
[21:48] named Jesus who ran un healing the
[21:49] people and he died pilot killed him and
[21:52] and her or put him to death and then the
[21:55] disciples went and stole his body away
[21:57] he out in each night to go cut a piece
[21:59] off of it and eat it so they were
[22:00] cannibals so it was taking communion you
[22:02] see the carnal mind Josephus is no one
[22:05] to listen to but take the fox book of
[22:08] the martyrs there's a good authentic fox
[22:11] book of Martyrs how many you ever read
[22:13] it uh the penman's early ages or or
[22:17] hoses 2 babblin or or some great
[22:20] authentic or the the most greatest we
[22:22] have is the Nan Council the pre- Nan
[22:25] Council and the Nan Council you find out
[22:28] there that was never mentioned no
[22:31] persons take the holy scriptures and see
[22:34] if there ever was anybody in the Bible
[22:36] ever baptized using those titles name
[22:38] Father Son and Holy
[22:40] Ghost it denotes three
[22:43] Gods it's for a pagan
[22:46] ceremony and Catholicism is nothing else
[22:49] in the world but a a pagan Farm of
[22:53] Christianity and from the Catholic
[22:55] Church come Martin Luther John Wesley
[22:57] Baptist Presbyterians and so forth but
[22:59] in the last days it was a door set
[23:01] between there that opened up the truth
[23:03] again that the Bible said so the great
[23:06] prophet was to come on the earth in the
[23:09] last days we believe he's coming
[23:12] watching he'll have a church now we'll
[23:15] see this now now remember this is the

[1:10:40] body your whole family has been God
[1:10:42] bless you this morning let's turn to the
[1:10:44] scripture uh in Genesis 22 to get
[1:10:47] started
[1:10:58] we'll start right there at the first
[1:11:12] verse and it came to pass after these
[1:11:14] things that God did tempt Abraham and
[1:11:17] said unto him
[1:11:18] Abraham and he said behold here I am and
[1:11:22] he said take now thy son thine only son
[1:11:24] Isaac
[1:11:26] whom thou lovest and get thee into the
[1:11:28] land of Mora and offer him there for
[1:11:31] burnt offering upon one of the mountains
[1:11:33] which I will tell thee of and Abraham
[1:11:36] rose up early in the morning and saddled
[1:11:39] his ass and took two of his young men
[1:11:42] with him and Isaac his son enclaved the
[1:11:45] wood from the for the burnt offering and
[1:11:48] Rose up and went onto the place of which
[1:11:50] God had told
[1:11:52] him then on the third day Abraham lifted
[1:11:55] up his eyes and saw the place a far off
[1:11:58] and Abraham said unto his young men
[1:12:00] abide ye here with the ass and I and the
[1:12:04] lad will go Yonder and worship and come
[1:12:06] again to you and Abraham took the wood
[1:12:10] of the burnt offering and laid it upon
[1:12:12] Isaac his son and he took the fire in
[1:12:14] his hand and a knife and they went both
[1:12:17] of them together and Isaac spake unto
[1:12:21] Abraham his father and said my father he
[1:12:25] said here I am my son and he said behold
[1:12:29] the fire and the wood but where is the
[1:12:31] Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham
[1:12:34] said my son God will provide himself a
[1:12:36] lamb for a burnt offering so they went
[1:12:38] both of them together you may be
[1:12:43] seated I'm going to read
[1:12:45] a another scripture in
[1:12:49] Jonah say
[1:12:53] Jonah first chapter
[1:13:15] and we'll uh read a
[1:13:17] couple verses at the top and then we'll
[1:13:20] jump down to the
[1:13:21] 17th so now the word of the Lord came
[1:13:24] unto Jonah
[1:13:26] the son of amiti saying arise go to
[1:13:30] Nineveh that great City and cry against
[1:13:32] it for the wickedness has come up before
[1:13:36] me and Jonah rose up to flee onto Tarsus
[1:13:40] from the presence of the Lord and went
[1:13:42] down to japa and he found a ship going
[1:13:45] to tarus so he paid the fair thereof and
[1:13:48] went down into it to go with them onto
[1:13:52] tarus from the presence of the Lord
[1:13:56] and then down to the 17th
[1:13:59] verse now the Lord had prepared a great
[1:14:03] fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was
[1:14:05] in the belly of the fish three days and
[1:14:08] three
[1:14:10] nights
[1:14:14] now I uh titled this message and we'll
[1:14:16] see if it goes together the way it's
[1:14:19] titled but God has provided prepared and
[1:14:23] purposed
[1:14:26] and you know I was just kind of praying
[1:14:28] through the night brother po texted me
[1:14:31] yesterday and then early this morning I
[1:14:33] wasn't really sure you know if this was
[1:14:36] happening but I I want to be
[1:14:39] ready and uh you know how it goes
[1:14:42] sometimes nothing's coming nothing's
[1:14:45] coming and this morning I was reading
[1:14:47] through the scriptures and I thought
[1:14:49] about I thought about these two servants
[1:14:52] of
[1:14:53] God and
[1:14:55] you know in life we most of us are
[1:14:58] Christians in here I believe and I
[1:15:01] believe we're all here for a purpose
[1:15:02] anyways and God knows why you're
[1:15:05] here and and you know I don't know where
[1:15:08] you're at in life sometimes I don't know
[1:15:11] where I'm at in life but we're all in
[1:15:12] different places in our
[1:15:14] journey and I and I thought you know
[1:15:17] when when God came to Abraham and we
[1:15:19] know the story about Abraham and how God
[1:15:21] promised a son and and then and then he
[1:15:24] got this promis and here he is what God
[1:15:27] asked him to do and and it was no doubt
[1:15:30] not a easy thing if you can put yourself
[1:15:33] in this place for a
[1:15:35] moment and I'm reading the scripture and
[1:15:38] it says you know that God did tempt
[1:15:42] Abraham and he said and he said to him
[1:15:45] he he said take up thy son Isaac who
[1:15:47] thou love Isaac and who whom thou lovest
[1:15:50] and get thee to the land of
[1:15:51] Mora uh and offer him for a burn an
[1:15:55] offering upon the mountain which I will
[1:15:57] tell of thee and the next scripture says
[1:16:00] and Abraham rose up early in the
[1:16:04] morning and he begin to do what God told
[1:16:06] him to
[1:16:08] do you see God had told him to do a
[1:16:11] really hard
[1:16:13] thing he he he however God chose to
[1:16:17] speak to him at that time Abraham knew
[1:16:19] it was God just like sometimes we know
[1:16:22] it's God and he chooses and he speaks to
[1:16:25] us and he tells us to do a hard
[1:16:28] thing now
[1:16:30] Jonah God spoke to him as
[1:16:33] well and he told him to do a hard thing
[1:16:37] maybe it was a different situation maybe
[1:16:40] it was uh uh different
[1:16:42] circumstances but nonetheless it was a
[1:16:44] hard thing you know we all like I said
[1:16:48] before we're in a different place in
[1:16:49] life God may come to you at a different
[1:16:51] walk in your faith I I don't know where
[1:16:54] Jonah was at in the walk in his faith
[1:16:56] but his response was to run from the
[1:16:58] presence of God and Abraham's response
[1:17:01] was to wake up early in the morning and
[1:17:04] begin to gather the things together to
[1:17:06] do what God told them to
[1:17:09] do you know and and I I was reading that
[1:17:13] in different situations you might think
[1:17:17] one's harder than the other but Jonah
[1:17:20] didn't know Abraham's situation he
[1:17:22] wasn't in that place
[1:17:25] Abraham wasn't in Jo Jonah
[1:17:30] situation but you see these two sons of
[1:17:33] God doing the complete
[1:17:37] opposite you know and we look at Abraham
[1:17:40] and we know his
[1:17:41] story and and and our lives are type to
[1:17:44] that
[1:17:45] story but I want to look at Jonah for a
[1:17:48] few moments because I my life is typed
[1:17:50] to Jonah as
[1:17:52] well I I know what it's like to run from
[1:17:55] the presence of
[1:17:57] God you know
[1:17:59] they it it it's interesting isn't it the
[1:18:03] two different responses to when God come
[1:18:06] and tell them to do
[1:18:08] something now you can only imagine you
[1:18:12] can only imagine what they were going
[1:18:14] through I I I think of Jonah we know he
[1:18:17] didn't want to go down there th those
[1:18:20] who knows what those people were going
[1:18:21] to do to him not only that God might
[1:18:25] save
[1:18:27] him Jonah didn't he didn't know if he
[1:18:29] wanted
[1:18:31] that so he he chose to do the total
[1:18:34] opposite but
[1:18:36] nonetheless nonetheless he was a child
[1:18:39] of God nonetheless God he called him for
[1:18:43] a purpose and a
[1:18:45] reason and I look at Jonah and I I look
[1:18:47] at my
[1:18:48] life because I I done the same thing as
[1:18:52] Jonah I was raised in the message my dad
[1:18:55] was the associate pastor to the same
[1:18:56] church I I associate
[1:18:59] now and he passed away when I was very
[1:19:02] young and I knew what was right you know
[1:19:06] the Bible says train up a child in the
[1:19:08] way he should go and it will not depart
[1:19:11] from him when he's old and I know that
[1:19:14] to be the
[1:19:15] truth I know that to be the word of
[1:19:21] God because I I I departed I
[1:19:27] departed I left the word I Le I left the
[1:19:30] church I left the body and I went out
[1:19:33] and I began to run from the presence of
[1:19:36] God I began to live a
[1:19:39] life you know that you might see these
[1:19:41] people on the street in Alaska the
[1:19:44] homelessness is bad as
[1:19:46] well and I I don't I can't look down on
[1:19:49] them out
[1:19:50] there I can't look down on them out
[1:19:53] there the ones that don't have their
[1:19:55] minds the ones that are are literally
[1:19:58] lost and don't know where they're
[1:20:00] at because I've been
[1:20:02] there I've been there out of my mind
[1:20:07] lost didn't know where I was
[1:20:10] at literally many
[1:20:15] times running from the presence of God
[1:20:19] finding myself in a in a place where I
[1:20:21] thought I would never
[1:20:22] be thought you would you could never do
[1:20:25] the things that you're doing you you
[1:20:28] could never choose to do the things that
[1:20:31] you do I don't know I'm I don't want to
[1:20:32] get into it but you you you're just in a
[1:20:36] dark
[1:20:39] place and I I like that I'm not the only
[1:20:43] son of God that had to go through a dark
[1:20:46] place I look at Jonah's life
[1:20:49] and you know he was there running and
[1:20:52] he's in the boat
[1:20:55] he thinks he's he thinks he's getting
[1:20:56] away with
[1:20:58] it like I like I
[1:21:00] thought doing doing what you want
[1:21:04] hanging out with the friends that you
[1:21:05] want talking the way you want walking
[1:21:08] the way you want listening to the music
[1:21:10] that you
[1:21:12] want and all the while you're headed
[1:21:16] into a
[1:21:18] storm all the while you know maybe it
[1:21:21] gets a little rocky here and there and
[1:21:23] uh it's not so bad
[1:21:26] it's not so bad it'll
[1:21:28] pass I spent nights in on my mom's couch
[1:21:31] cuz I was homeless I I chose to be
[1:21:34] homeless my mom always had an open door
[1:21:35] for me and when I absolutely had nowhere
[1:21:38] else to go I had no other options and I
[1:21:42] was sick of sleeping on the street I
[1:21:44] would go
[1:21:46] home and I would lay on the couch and
[1:21:49] and I would be going through
[1:21:52] withdrawals I'd be going through with I
[1:21:54] don't I if you know what those are but
[1:21:56] withdrawals from substance abuse and I'd
[1:21:59] be laying on the couch and I'd be
[1:22:01] hearing things and just evil things in
[1:22:04] your mind you hear them uh you hear them
[1:22:10] audiable and you I would just be laying
[1:22:12] there and I'd be seeing things
[1:22:13] hallucinating and I would just think
[1:22:15] it'll be better in the
[1:22:17] morning it'll be better in the morning
[1:22:20] it'll be better in the morning I would
[1:22:22] tell myself all night
[1:22:25] you know I don't know how how long they
[1:22:27] were in that boat maybe telling
[1:22:29] theirself it'll be better in the
[1:22:32] morning maybe they they were you know I
[1:22:35] don't know how long they were traveling
[1:22:37] along and the the boat was starting to
[1:22:39] rock and things were getting a little
[1:22:40] scary and and they thought you know
[1:22:43] we've been in a storm like this before
[1:22:45] but then it just kept getting worse and
[1:22:47] worse till maybe it got to a point where
[1:22:49] they've never been in a storm like that
[1:22:51] before and it was getting into a
[1:22:54] condition where they were getting
[1:22:55] desperate they were looking around who
[1:22:58] whose fault is
[1:23:00] this you know uh I could only type my my
[1:23:05] own personal experience to this may I
[1:23:07] was looking around and whose fault is
[1:23:10] this I'm in a place in life I'm in I'm
[1:23:13] in a condition in life that I've never
[1:23:15] been before and it looks like I'm headed
[1:23:18] to certain
[1:23:19] Doom I'm headed to uh I'm headed to
[1:23:25] a sure
[1:23:27] end and I I'm looking around
[1:23:30] and everybody else might be looking and
[1:23:34] not knowing what's going on with me and
[1:23:36] how did I end up in this place or what's
[1:23:38] going on and but I I'm I'm Jonah and I
[1:23:40] know what's going
[1:23:42] on they they see the boats Rock and they
[1:23:44] see the storm but they don't know
[1:23:48] why but deep down I know
[1:23:51] why you know as Christians as as sons of
[1:23:55] God as as somebody that has called for a
[1:23:59] purpose as somebody that God ha has
[1:24:02] decided to choose to set you apart to be
[1:24:06] an example to be a witness to be a
[1:24:10] light to be a representative as somebody
[1:24:13] that he's called you might not know it
[1:24:15] yet you might not know who you are what
[1:24:18] you're called to do but God if he has
[1:24:21] called you deep down
[1:24:26] inside you
[1:24:28] know why things are the way they are
[1:24:33] sometimes you know
[1:24:35] it and there comes a time where we got
[1:24:37] to be
[1:24:38] honest we got to be honest with oursel
[1:24:41] and I got a whole bunch of notes brother
[1:24:44] Po and this is not in any of
[1:24:47] them but I I just relate to Jonah so
[1:24:50] much I can't read the scripture without
[1:24:52] just falling into it just seeing myself
[1:24:55] in the boat going back to the places
[1:24:58] where I've been being on my mom's couch
[1:25:00] it'll be better in the morning and just
[1:25:02] darkness around
[1:25:04] me you know the the the Bible the Bible
[1:25:08] tells us what happens
[1:25:10] is but brother brandom goes into a
[1:25:13] little bit more detail about
[1:25:15] it I don't think I like I said it's not
[1:25:17] my notes so I don't have the exact quote
[1:25:20] but I'm sure you heard it before he he
[1:25:22] said that they bound up his hand hands
[1:25:24] and his
[1:25:25] feet they bound up Jonah's hands and his
[1:25:29] feet Jonah said I'm the problem it's
[1:25:31] because I'm running from
[1:25:33] God you guys will be out of this
[1:25:35] situation if you just toss me out and
[1:25:38] you know I find it interesting that
[1:25:40] Jonah didn't just jump
[1:25:42] out you know we know what needs to
[1:25:44] happen but it it takes maybe a brother
[1:25:47] or sister or somebody to tie us up to
[1:25:51] get to tie us up and put us in a place
[1:25:53] and say I I don't have the my own
[1:25:56] self-will Pastor pray for me you can't
[1:25:59] pray for yourself brother pray for me
[1:26:02] sister pray for me you can't pray for
[1:26:04] yourself I've been there I would say it
[1:26:07] was better in the morning but I couldn't
[1:26:09] pray because I didn't think God could
[1:26:12] hear me I didn't think God would take me
[1:26:14] out of that
[1:26:16] condition I just didn't know him good
[1:26:18] enough
[1:26:20] yet but they bound up his feet they
[1:26:23] bound up his hands and the storm was
[1:26:26] raging and the boat was rocking and and
[1:26:29] I thought often times you
[1:26:32] know if it was anybody
[1:26:35] else if it was anybody else in that
[1:26:38] condition getting tossed into the
[1:26:42] sea let me just back up for a moment try
[1:26:45] to get back on
[1:26:46] track said God had
[1:26:50] prepared a great fish to swallow up
[1:26:52] Jonah
[1:26:55] you see God he prepared a way for Jonah
[1:27:00] it might have not been the way that
[1:27:01] Jonah wanted see Jonah was called for a
[1:27:05] purpose and God didn't only he had he
[1:27:08] had a way prepared for Jonah to
[1:27:12] accomplish that
[1:27:15] purpose brother brandom said he don't
[1:27:17] believe Jonah was
[1:27:20] backsliding he's that's a quote like I
[1:27:22] said not in my notes but you find
[1:27:26] it he he took up for
[1:27:31] Jonah Bound in the midst of a storm
[1:27:35] thrown into the
[1:27:37] sea but God had
[1:27:39] prepared a great
[1:27:42] fish to swallow him
[1:27:45] up to anybody
[1:27:48] else they'd be a dead
[1:27:51] man not a chance
[1:27:55] not a
[1:27:57] chance to be thrown into the sea bound
[1:28:01] hands and feet and then a fish eats
[1:28:06] you you're
[1:28:09] dead if it was anybody
[1:28:11] else you see but it was
[1:28:14] Jonah and Jonah had a purpose in God's
[1:28:19] plan God had had called Jonah for a
[1:28:23] specific specific purpose and it didn't
[1:28:26] matter what Jonah's life looked like it
[1:28:28] didn't matter actually the decisions
[1:28:30] that Jonah made you know that because to
[1:28:33] us it looks like he made the wrong
[1:28:35] decisions he made the wrong choice he he
[1:28:38] ran away and Abraham if he was a Seed of
[1:28:41] Abraham the devil might tell you if you
[1:28:44] were a child of Abraham if you if you
[1:28:47] had real faith if you were really a
[1:28:50] Christian you would do exactly like
[1:28:52] Abraham did and you would get up early
[1:28:54] in the morning though it was
[1:28:57] hard though it was something you didn't
[1:28:59] want to do you didn't want to give up
[1:29:03] that it was an unthinkable
[1:29:07] ask the devil will tell you you're not
[1:29:11] saved you don't got
[1:29:13] it it's not for
[1:29:16] you if your life looks like
[1:29:19] Jonah but the word of God tells me that
[1:29:21] Jonah was a son of God
[1:29:25] and that God he had prepared a
[1:29:28] fish to accomplish his
[1:29:32] plan you see we know if if Jonah didn't
[1:29:36] end up in the belly of a
[1:29:38] fish he might have not
[1:29:42] converted the people of
[1:29:48] Nineveh I think of the wells belly that
[1:29:50] I've been
[1:29:52] in I think of the Walk that I walked I
[1:29:55] think of the things that the devil has
[1:29:57] told me I'm just telling you my
[1:29:59] testimony uh how how the Bible relates
[1:30:03] and I
[1:30:04] relate and whatever God can do for you
[1:30:07] you you allow him to do
[1:30:09] that you put yourself in the
[1:30:12] scripture maybe you're not Jonah maybe
[1:30:14] you're
[1:30:15] Abraham in this certain
[1:30:17] instance truthfully you're both you're a
[1:30:21] child of God you're part of this word
[1:30:24] you have a purpose God has provided a
[1:30:29] way I think of the the fish that I've
[1:30:32] been
[1:30:33] in I've been in a fish of
[1:30:37] alcoholism I've been in a fish of
[1:30:40] Despair uh brother brandom he says he
[1:30:43] says you think you have
[1:30:45] symptoms what about
[1:30:48] Jonah seaweed all wrapped around his
[1:30:50] neck fish vomit everywhere
[1:30:54] can't see he don't know which way's up
[1:30:56] which way's
[1:30:59] down I've been
[1:31:01] there I've experienced that not like
[1:31:05] Jonah I probably would have been dead
[1:31:07] that wasn't my
[1:31:09] purpose exactly like Jonah but my
[1:31:12] purpose was to be in the Well's belly
[1:31:14] that I was in and your and your purpose
[1:31:17] maybe you were in the Well's belly of
[1:31:19] some
[1:31:20] sort darkness and
[1:31:22] despair depression
[1:31:24] depression
[1:31:26] self-doubt I think a lot of us have that
[1:31:28] seaweed wrapped around our neck from
[1:31:30] time to
[1:31:32] time but don't be
[1:31:36] discouraged remember the promise do like
[1:31:41] Jonah do you like Jonah let me let me
[1:31:45] move a little on from
[1:31:47] that let's let's talk about Abraham
[1:31:50] now maybe
[1:31:52] Abraham's condition
[1:31:54] I want to point out that God prepared
[1:31:56] that way for for
[1:31:58] Jonah he prepared
[1:32:00] it now God provided a way for
[1:32:05] Abraham God provided a
[1:32:09] lamb in in the time that he needed
[1:32:12] it God prepared a fish for Jonah God
[1:32:15] provided a lamb for
[1:32:18] Abraham see God he provides he prepares
[1:32:23] and he
[1:32:26] purposed he's in control of all of
[1:32:29] it he has a reason for everything in
[1:32:34] your life in my
[1:32:37] life he has a
[1:32:41] reason I often thought about Abraham's
[1:32:44] ask what God was asking him to
[1:32:48] do I just can't imagine I have two young
[1:32:51] boys of myself I didn't have to to wait
[1:32:54] 25 years for
[1:32:56] them it w you know I
[1:33:00] didn't it didn't come to me like it came
[1:33:02] to
[1:33:03] Abraham they just showed up one of
[1:33:07] them what a
[1:33:09] blessing and I can't imagine I can't
[1:33:13] imagine what Abraham was going through
[1:33:16] we read the scripture and it seems like
[1:33:17] oh he just got up in the morning and
[1:33:19] here he
[1:33:22] goes and maybe he did that but I just do
[1:33:26] you know how the
[1:33:28] devil can you imagine the battle that
[1:33:30] was going on in his
[1:33:32] mind can you imagine the things that he
[1:33:35] was going through that
[1:33:40] morning brother bradam dramatized it he
[1:33:42] said that maybe he didn't even tell
[1:33:44] Sarah he couldn't bear
[1:33:49] to he got up got the things collected
[1:33:53] put the knife in the bag got the burn
[1:33:55] off got the wood chopped it up put it on
[1:33:59] Isaac's back and here we
[1:34:03] go ah it was a three days
[1:34:07] journey of this rolling around in the
[1:34:09] back of Abraham's
[1:34:12] head he was doing what God told him to
[1:34:16] do he had faith in God he he had
[1:34:20] Faith just like he told the young men
[1:34:23] his servants he said we're going to go
[1:34:25] up and we're going to go worship God and
[1:34:26] we will return he had Faith but even
[1:34:31] so how
[1:34:34] hard you can't bear to see your little
[1:34:36] child hurt you can't bear to see you
[1:34:40] your you can't I can't I can't bear to
[1:34:44] not only see him hurt but imagine doing
[1:34:46] it
[1:34:48] myself you
[1:34:51] can't and I just see Abraham he's he's
[1:34:55] walking there's the mountain but God
[1:34:58] showed me there it is it's getting close
[1:35:01] to the time that I have to do what God's
[1:35:03] told me to
[1:35:07] do I
[1:35:09] just I just can't
[1:35:12] even imagine your boy I just I just
[1:35:16] think of my little boy they're so
[1:35:18] precious they're so innocent they're so
[1:35:21] trusting they just believe that I have
[1:35:24] their best interest they just trust that
[1:35:26] I'm going to protect them and take care
[1:35:28] of
[1:35:31] them and Abraham he would do the same
[1:35:34] but God's asking him to do something
[1:35:37] hard Abraham would do
[1:35:41] anything for his boy but he would do
[1:35:45] more for
[1:35:46] God he put God above everything in his
[1:35:49] life he put God absolutely first and he
[1:35:53] had faith in the word of what God has
[1:35:55] promised that he would have the promised
[1:35:58] seed come forth from this young man this
[1:36:00] young
[1:36:02] boy but I see him walking up the
[1:36:04] mountain and it's just him and and the
[1:36:07] boy and you know how you have those
[1:36:10] conversations with just you and your son
[1:36:12] and sometimes they ask ridiculous
[1:36:15] questions but Isaac was thinking that
[1:36:20] day that was a valid question
[1:36:25] walking and maybe Abraham seemed a
[1:36:28] little
[1:36:29] down maybe his countenance was a little
[1:36:31] heavy and Isaac's noticing and he begins
[1:36:35] to
[1:36:40] realize
[1:36:45] Papa
[1:36:47] um looks like we're going up to
[1:36:49] sacrifice
[1:36:52] something I see the
[1:36:54] wood I see the
[1:36:58] fire where's
[1:37:01] lamb oh how that must ripped Abraham's
[1:37:03] heart
[1:37:07] apart how that must have hurt so
[1:37:11] bad but I believe
[1:37:14] faith in the time that Abraham needed it
[1:37:17] every time that Abraham needed
[1:37:19] it
[1:37:21] Faith would rise up and speak
[1:37:30] speak he said
[1:37:33] Son God will provide the
[1:37:38] sacrifice I I go back to a place in life
[1:37:41] where Faith some it rises up and it
[1:37:45] speaks you know when it's not
[1:37:47] you maybe you're praying and something
[1:37:50] comes out and that's not you
[1:37:55] I remember I was coming off of
[1:37:57] a just a horrible binge did all kinds of
[1:38:01] crazy stuff stole my my uncle's car my
[1:38:05] sister Sharon she was there they were
[1:38:07] out of town then I Disappeared for a
[1:38:09] week with the
[1:38:11] car without permission I was borrowing
[1:38:15] it
[1:38:17] but at the end of that I I I was in that
[1:38:20] despair again I just life got worse and
[1:38:23] worse wor and worse and worse and now
[1:38:25] I'm do like I said I'm doing things I
[1:38:26] never thought I would
[1:38:28] do my my uncle he gave me a house to
[1:38:30] live at he would feed me he gave me work
[1:38:34] and I would treat him like
[1:38:37] this you know that's how I I've seen
[1:38:40] Christ in people like
[1:38:43] that who though you treat him that way
[1:38:46] they still love
[1:38:49] you he he come home I was gone I'm I
[1:38:53] remember waking up one morning just kind
[1:38:55] of depressed and like I got to go face
[1:38:58] the music I got to go I can't live like
[1:39:01] this I got to go bring his car back and
[1:39:02] he's going to kick me out of the house
[1:39:04] and that's fine I'm I'm done anyways I'm
[1:39:06] done with the church I'm done with
[1:39:08] trying because I did try I went to
[1:39:10] church sometimes I
[1:39:13] tried but it wasn't working I
[1:39:17] thought some point you got to stop
[1:39:20] trying you just got to give it up
[1:39:23] I came home
[1:39:26] and I thought he was surely going to
[1:39:28] come out it was a Saturday night thought
[1:39:31] he's going to come out and it's it's
[1:39:32] going down like something's going to
[1:39:35] happen I don't know what
[1:39:37] something you know whatever happens
[1:39:40] happens he never came
[1:39:43] out early that morning Sunday morning he
[1:39:46] came out he said John I had to
[1:39:50] pray he said I was going to kill you
[1:39:56] he said I don't
[1:39:58] understand we we've all tried the
[1:40:01] pastor's tried I've tried your mom's
[1:40:04] tried everybody's tried and we thought
[1:40:06] you had it because I was doing okay I
[1:40:09] was putting on the face I was going to
[1:40:11] church I'd raise my hands I'd sing the
[1:40:15] songs and then all of a sudden just this
[1:40:19] curveball all of a sudden in Well's
[1:40:22] belly
[1:40:27] and he saidwhat do you want to do that
[1:40:29] whole night I thought of the things that
[1:40:32] I wanted to
[1:40:33] do just not not
[1:40:36] live I can't do
[1:40:38] that just disappear that's probably the
[1:40:42] best option just leave everything many
[1:40:45] everybody a lot of people do it I can do
[1:40:47] it too I don't need anybody these are
[1:40:49] the thoughts these were my own thoughts
[1:40:51] that I had
[1:40:53] but when he asked me the
[1:40:55] question what do you want to do without
[1:40:59] thinking about the answer I said I want
[1:41:02] to get
[1:41:06] up you know I believe Jonah was in that
[1:41:09] Well's belly and all it Revelation
[1:41:12] struck him and it said look to the
[1:41:16] temple remember the prayer of Solomon
[1:41:18] and look to the temple remember the word
[1:41:21] of God and get up
[1:41:27] oh I just same thing with Abraham I
[1:41:30] believe as he was walking and Faith just
[1:41:33] struck him and he said God will provide
[1:41:36] the
[1:41:38] lamb don't worry about it
[1:41:41] son you
[1:41:44] see I don't know how long Jonah was in
[1:41:46] the wells belly after he prayed the
[1:41:48] prayer we know he was in there for three
[1:41:50] days three nights we we know that but we
[1:41:53] don't know when he prayed the
[1:41:56] prayer did it happen an hour after he
[1:41:59] was in the belly a
[1:42:03] day I'm sure every day seemed like
[1:42:07] forever and maybe he didn't know where
[1:42:10] that he didn't I don't imagine the Bible
[1:42:12] doesn't say he knew it was swimming to
[1:42:16] Nineveh but he knew what he had to do
[1:42:18] when he stepped off on the shore and
[1:42:20] here he is oh that's Nineveh
[1:42:24] probably just face plet in the
[1:42:27] sand oh okay all right Lord I know I'll
[1:42:30] do
[1:42:34] it I want to get
[1:42:37] up I believe if you're a child of God
[1:42:41] you have the same thing inside of
[1:42:44] you no matter where you're at no matter
[1:42:48] where you're at in life today
[1:42:53] he said get up let's go to
[1:42:56] church so I did I went to
[1:43:01] church and they sang the songs the sing
[1:43:04] Amazing Grace and I there was times
[1:43:06] where I could feel the presence of God
[1:43:08] growing
[1:43:09] up I didn't feel the presence of God
[1:43:12] that
[1:43:13] time but I
[1:43:15] cried it's because I didn't feel his
[1:43:18] presence and I heard so often if you
[1:43:20] would just repent and ask for
[1:43:22] forgiveness that he would come and it's
[1:43:24] the truth but
[1:43:28] sometimes he'll make you
[1:43:31] wait sometimes he'll make you prove your
[1:43:34] faith just like
[1:43:36] Abraham see Abraham knew the lamb God
[1:43:39] would provide it but he still had some
[1:43:42] walking to
[1:43:44] do he still had some mind battles to go
[1:43:50] through it wasn't over right there on
[1:43:52] the
[1:43:54] spot Jonah he prayed the prayer and like
[1:43:57] I said I don't
[1:43:59] know but it probably felt like a long
[1:44:01] time before he got the
[1:44:03] answer and I sat in church and and and
[1:44:06] still feeling like I was in darkness
[1:44:08] still feeling like I was lost actually
[1:44:11] feeling like I crossed the line and now
[1:44:13] we were
[1:44:14] done and I'm asking God I'm sorry I
[1:44:18] don't want to be like this I don't want
[1:44:19] to do this
[1:44:23] uh we
[1:44:25] we'll we're just going to uh we're just
[1:44:29] going to get rid of the notes because uh
[1:44:33] they're they're
[1:44:36] gone you think you know what the Lord
[1:44:38] wants you to
[1:44:47] do I I cried the whole
[1:44:49] service I cried the whole service not
[1:44:52] filling the Pres you know you feel the
[1:44:53] presence of God and you cry appreciation
[1:44:56] maybe it's sorrow for you know you can
[1:44:58] do better and just whatever the reason
[1:45:00] you feel the presence of God and it make
[1:45:02] it moves
[1:45:03] you I was
[1:45:04] moved I it was not the same
[1:45:07] cry it's a different
[1:45:10] cry it was a cry
[1:45:13] of I felt like I was totally
[1:45:17] lost I knew it was the
[1:45:19] truth I know the truth
[1:45:24] and I I just believe Jonah he must have
[1:45:27] felt similar feelings he knew the truth
[1:45:30] and now he's in this fish's belly and
[1:45:33] it's
[1:45:34] over it's
[1:45:38] over service I got through it and they'd
[1:45:42] have potluck there in the fellowship
[1:45:45] hall
[1:45:46] and I went to the car and I just cried
[1:45:49] some more
[1:45:53] I just cried and cried and cried I I I
[1:45:58] don't know if you've ever been
[1:46:00] there you're
[1:46:04] lost we've all been there whether we
[1:46:06] know it or
[1:46:10] not my uncle he found me in in the car
[1:46:14] and knocks on the window and I roll it
[1:46:20] down he says I was looking for you
[1:46:25] and you know I don't got nothing to say
[1:46:26] really I'm just listening he said you
[1:46:28] know
[1:46:29] John God's a
[1:46:31] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[1:46:35] Him and if I look back on my life now at
[1:46:38] that
[1:46:39] moment I didn't know what was happening
[1:46:41] but if I look
[1:46:44] now that was
[1:46:46] a I had a little
[1:46:49] faith because I believed it
[1:46:53] you know the life the condition that
[1:46:55] you're in now might it might not look
[1:46:57] like you have
[1:46:59] faith the devil's going to tell you that
[1:47:01] you
[1:47:03] don't but I remember thinking I don't
[1:47:08] know what diligently means but I haven't
[1:47:10] done
[1:47:16] that and then he told me the story of
[1:47:19] the
[1:47:20] chicken peeping its way out of the EG
[1:47:24] and now he said that that was God's
[1:47:26] provided
[1:47:29] way he said there was no other way of
[1:47:33] doing it for that chicken to be
[1:47:36] born it had to
[1:47:38] scrape it had to
[1:47:41] struggle to be
[1:47:45] born and now he read me that quote gave
[1:47:48] it to me I read it
[1:47:51] myself and that night I went home and
[1:47:54] back into the shop that I was living
[1:47:56] in and I begin to try to diligently seek
[1:48:02] God many times in my life I
[1:48:05] tried grew up in and out of
[1:48:08] it many times in my life I didn't
[1:48:11] try many times in my life I try to make
[1:48:14] a deal with
[1:48:16] God how silly we are sometimes as if we
[1:48:20] have anything to offer God really
[1:48:23] well let me make a trade with you I'll
[1:48:25] be good if you be good
[1:48:29] her he is he is the best he is the
[1:48:33] greatest we can't out you can't ever
[1:48:35] outgive God but yet he so loves you so
[1:48:40] much he loves you so much that he won't
[1:48:44] leave you in the wells
[1:48:46] belly he won't he
[1:48:48] won't he won't leave Abraham without his
[1:48:52] promise
[1:48:53] being
[1:48:56] fulfilled I I did though I went back and
[1:48:59] I begin to
[1:49:01] pray I begin to seek God I begin to
[1:49:03] listen to brother bram's
[1:49:06] tapes I begin to read the Bible and just
[1:49:10] doing everything that I could do I don't
[1:49:13] you know it's not about the work but God
[1:49:15] wants to see a willingness to do his
[1:49:18] word a willingness to act upon the faith
[1:49:21] that he's placed inside of
[1:49:23] you and you will if you're a child of
[1:49:27] God there's no way around it Jonah could
[1:49:31] do nothing to get out of the will of
[1:49:35] God it's too bad for Jonah or too good
[1:49:38] for
[1:49:39] Jonah put him in a place that he didn't
[1:49:41] want to be put me in a place that I
[1:49:43] didn't want to be maybe you're in a
[1:49:45] place that you don't want to be
[1:49:48] today but God loves you
[1:49:53] God's allowed
[1:49:54] it he wants to bring forth his purpose
[1:49:58] in
[1:49:59] you he wants to fulfill a purpose that
[1:50:02] he has placed in you in this
[1:50:08] day I was in my room for three days kind
[1:50:12] of like Jonah's belly the the Well's
[1:50:15] belly I did get to go out of my room
[1:50:17] because I wasn't literally in the belly
[1:50:20] but I didn't eat nothing I couldn't go
[1:50:22] to work I went to work the one day I
[1:50:24] tried I went to work and I couldn't even
[1:50:27] sweep the
[1:50:28] floor couldn't do nothing so I just went
[1:50:31] back to my
[1:50:32] room begin to pray and cry and just Lord
[1:50:38] show me
[1:50:40] something I'm doing all I
[1:50:42] can I don't want to be
[1:50:45] lost I don't I don't want to be in this
[1:50:48] condition for the rest of my life I
[1:50:50] won't last long like this
[1:50:54] and I I I just
[1:50:57] remember it was that happened Sunday it
[1:51:00] was Monday Tuesday and it was Wednesday
[1:51:04] morning was late in the night Tuesday
[1:51:06] night Wednesday morning I don't remember
[1:51:08] what tape was playing I don't
[1:51:11] remember what I was thinking but I was
[1:51:14] there trying to seek
[1:51:17] God if you take anything and if you take
[1:51:20] anything away from this
[1:51:24] sometimes you got to diligently seek
[1:51:27] God and just like Abraham and Jonah had
[1:51:30] different responses and different
[1:51:32] Journeys my journey and your journey are
[1:51:35] going to be different it's not going to
[1:51:37] be exactly the same you might you might
[1:51:39] not have to do what I've done young
[1:51:42] people but God will show you what you
[1:51:45] need to
[1:51:47] do and then just do
[1:51:50] that rather than take the
[1:51:53] the other the long
[1:51:57] route but I was sitting there
[1:52:00] and all of a
[1:52:02] sudden I felt the presence of God like
[1:52:04] I've never felt it
[1:52:07] before maybe even
[1:52:13] since and it was the
[1:52:15] simplest the simplest thing that he told
[1:52:19] me he said I died for you
[1:52:27] there it was
[1:52:31] over Church of the Living God if you
[1:52:34] just if your
[1:52:35] faith could reach out and look to that
[1:52:39] sacrifice to look to that provided way
[1:52:43] to look to that prepared
[1:52:47] way and you look to the promise that was
[1:52:49] given to you
[1:52:52] you're going to hear the same words that
[1:52:55] I heard you're going to hear the same
[1:53:00] word I died for
[1:53:03] you and it wasn't like the Bible says
[1:53:07] the
[1:53:09] world it was for
[1:53:13] you it was for you it was for
[1:53:17] me it was my name in the book it was my
[1:53:21] name in the
[1:53:23] scripture I died for
[1:53:29] you I came from
[1:53:33] glory and I died for
[1:53:36] you that you could have this that you
[1:53:40] have
[1:53:45] now my life was never the
[1:53:48] same I told my sister Sharon the next
[1:53:51] day I don't I know if she beli me or not
[1:53:54] but I told her anyways and I told
[1:53:55] everybody said I have never been more
[1:53:59] alive this has never been more
[1:54:04] real I told my
[1:54:06] Uncle I'm telling him I'm just chatting
[1:54:09] his ear off riding in the
[1:54:11] truck you know how we
[1:54:15] get he's busy though he's driving we're
[1:54:18] working I'm just
[1:54:22] and then I stop I
[1:54:24] think I think I got the Holy
[1:54:29] Ghost I told him he said that's
[1:54:34] nice that don't stop
[1:54:39] me oh man he told me the devil's got a
[1:54:43] Punch coming I said all right thank
[1:54:48] you you know he was telling the truth
[1:54:54] God he has a purpose for our
[1:54:59] lives you know I
[1:55:02] I we might live our whole lives and you
[1:55:06] know as a minister you want to see
[1:55:07] people come to the Altar and give their
[1:55:09] life to God you want to see people's
[1:55:11] lives change you want to see all these
[1:55:13] things
[1:55:14] and but sometimes you're just there to
[1:55:19] help maybe it's just to help a Christian
[1:55:21] get through one one more day maybe it's
[1:55:24] just to remind a brother or sister he
[1:55:28] died for
[1:55:29] you he gave his life for
[1:55:45] you my life's never been the same
[1:55:50] since just like the devil brought
[1:55:52] brought me to places that I thought I
[1:55:53] would never go God has brought me to
[1:55:56] places that i' never thought I would
[1:56:00] go and the contrast is not even
[1:56:05] comparable one offers
[1:56:08] death one offers
[1:56:12] life Sister
[1:56:14] Jesse not a longwind at preacher
[1:56:17] especially when I Veer from my notes
[1:56:26] I
[1:56:27] believe God's
[1:56:29] children have
[1:56:32] faith maybe I will read one of my quotes
[1:57:03] just go ahead and
[1:57:05] uh put the one
[1:57:08] that's the rising of the
[1:57:14] sun know my
[1:57:16] notes had it laid out
[1:57:19] how God he he prepared your life
[1:57:22] the things that you go
[1:57:25] through and he provided the
[1:57:27] way which is his sacrifice that he
[1:57:32] gave for
[1:57:37] purpose it says Hebrews 138 said he is
[1:57:40] the same yesterday today and
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:44] forever we has beneficiaries are to
[1:57:47] prove his life is in us now the
[1:57:51] beneficiaries of this life the life
[1:57:54] there never was a life lived like
[1:57:57] it he was the son of God and he died and
[1:58:01] that shut it out but when he raised
[1:58:04] again from the dead on Easter morning
[1:58:08] then we as his servants are commissioned
[1:58:11] by him to go into all the world and to
[1:58:15] bring this good news to every person
[1:58:18] that is a
[1:58:20] living and how can we do
[1:58:23] it by word only for it is written the
[1:58:28] gospel came not by word only but through
[1:58:31] the power and the manifestation of the
[1:58:33] Holy Spirit to prove that he is
[1:58:37] alive now if there is another
[1:58:41] gospel as Paul spoke to one of the
[1:58:44] groups I am surprised that you turned to
[1:58:47] another gospel which there is no
[1:58:50] other but I make but a make belief
[1:58:53] gospel to a denomination fiction turning
[1:58:57] from the good news and because I live
[1:59:00] you live also and I live in you and the
[1:59:05] works that I do John 1412 The Works that
[1:59:09] I do will identify myself in
[1:59:13] you what a message no wonder we've had a
[1:59:17] dark world of theology but in the
[1:59:20] evening time there shall come light
[1:59:22] again there will be a resurrection in
[1:59:25] the evening time it shall be light at
[1:59:27] the evening time now the very essence of
[1:59:30] the message that was sent that he is
[1:59:33] risen from the dead we as
[1:59:37] beneficiaries who share the resurrection
[1:59:40] with him draw benefits from this by
[1:59:43] proving to the world that He Is Alive we
[1:59:46] cannot do it by word only we cannot do
[1:59:49] it by some tradition of man we only ref
[1:59:52] reflect exactly what we're pointing
[1:59:54] to I'm afraid today that too many of us
[1:59:58] are not getting people to Christ we are
[2:00:00] getting them to a church to a theory but
[2:00:04] we must get them to Christ he is the
[2:00:06] only one and the only one that has life
[2:00:11] he that has the son has life and if the
[2:00:14] life of man that's dead be projected in
[2:00:18] you you will live the same life life he
[2:00:20] lived if the blood of a man was a
[2:00:23] certain type and you took the blood of
[2:00:25] one man and changed the blood of one man
[2:00:28] into
[2:00:29] another he would absolutely be the that
[2:00:31] typed blood and if your spirit that's in
[2:00:34] you is wreck and dead and you are
[2:00:37] anointed with the life that was in
[2:00:39] Christ is upon you Romans 811 said if
[2:00:43] the spirit that raised Christ from the
[2:00:45] dead dwells in you it also quickened
[2:00:48] your mortal body that same life them
[2:00:52] same Powers them same
[2:00:55] beneficiaries that he had here on Earth
[2:00:58] from God he redeemed you a seed that was
[2:01:02] forn by God whose names was put on the
[2:01:05] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:01:07] foundation of the
[2:01:12] world mind if I read a couple more
[2:01:20] things this is in the church age
[2:01:24] book this is the
[2:01:26] purpose this is the reason you went
[2:01:28] through all the things you went through
[2:01:30] this is this is the reason that you're
[2:01:32] here
[2:01:33] today this is the reason that Abraham
[2:01:35] had a walk the walk up the hill this is
[2:01:38] the reason that Jonah had to spend time
[2:01:40] in the belly of the well this is the
[2:01:43] reason that brother brandham lived the
[2:01:45] life that he lived and went through the
[2:01:46] suffering that he went
[2:01:48] through this is the reason and purpose
[2:01:50] that God has
[2:01:53] Church age book uh page
[2:02:00] 336 but now he is standing in the midst
[2:02:03] of the church as he stands there
[2:02:06] revealing who he is in the last age he
[2:02:09] calls himself the author of the creation
[2:02:11] of God this is another creation this has
[2:02:15] to do with the church this is a special
[2:02:17] designation of himself he is the creator
[2:02:21] of the church of that church the
[2:02:23] Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[2:02:26] Bride As the spirit of God he came down
[2:02:30] and he created in the Virgin Mary the
[2:02:31] cells from which his body was born I
[2:02:35] want to repeat that he created the very
[2:02:37] cells in the womb of Mary for that body
[2:02:40] it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to
[2:02:43] Simply give life to a human oven oium
[2:02:47] supplied by Mary that would have been a
[2:02:49] sinful mankind producing a body
[2:02:53] that would not have produced the last
[2:02:55] Adam of him it was said Lo a body hast
[2:02:59] thou father prepared for
[2:03:02] me God not Mary provided the body Mary
[2:03:06] was the human incubator and she carried
[2:03:09] the holy child and brought him in birth
[2:03:12] it was a God man he was the son of God
[2:03:15] he was the New Creation man and God met
[2:03:18] and joined he was the first of this new
[2:03:22] race he is the head of this new race
[2:03:26] Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of
[2:03:28] the body the church who is the beginning
[2:03:30] of the firstborn from the dead that in
[2:03:33] all things he might have
[2:03:36] preeminence second Corinthians 5:17
[2:03:39] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[2:03:41] a new creation old things have passed
[2:03:44] away behold all things are become
[2:03:47] new there you can see that though man
[2:03:50] was of the old of the old order of
[2:03:53] creation or old order or creation Now in
[2:03:57] Union with Christ he has become the new
[2:03:59] creation of God Ephesians 2:10 for we
[2:04:02] are his workmanship created in Union
[2:04:04] with
[2:04:05] Christ Jesus onto uh good
[2:04:09] works Ephesians
[2:04:11] 4:24 and that ye put on the new man
[2:04:15] which God which after God is created in
[2:04:17] righteousness and true Holiness the new
[2:04:20] creation is not the old creation made
[2:04:23] over or it would not be called a new
[2:04:26] creation that is exactly what it says it
[2:04:28] is a new creation that is an it is
[2:04:31] another creation distinct from the old
[2:04:33] one no longer is he dealing by ways of
[2:04:37] Flesh that was how he dealt with Israel
[2:04:41] he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue
[2:04:45] Through The Godly Isaac
[2:04:48] line but now out of every kindred tribe
[2:04:52] and Nation he has purposed a new
[2:04:55] creation he is the first of that
[2:04:58] creation he was God created in the form
[2:05:00] of man now by his Spirit he is creating
[2:05:04] many sons unto himself God the Creator
[2:05:08] created himself a part of his
[2:05:11] creation now here it
[2:05:14] is this is the true revelation of
[2:05:19] God this was his purpose
[2:05:22] purpose this purpose took form through
[2:05:25] election that is why he could look right
[2:05:28] down to the last age when all would be
[2:05:31] over and see himself still in the midst
[2:05:33] of the church as author of this new
[2:05:36] creation of God his Sovereign power
[2:05:38] brought it to pass by his own
[2:05:41] decree he elected the members of this
[2:05:44] new creation he predestinated them to
[2:05:48] the adoption of children according to
[2:05:49] the good pleasure of his will by his
[2:05:52] omnicient and
[2:05:54] omnipotence he brought it to pass how
[2:05:59] else could he know that he would be
[2:06:01] standing in the midst of the church
[2:06:02] receiving Glory from his Brethren if he
[2:06:04] did not make sure all things he knew and
[2:06:07] all things he worked out according to
[2:06:11] what he knew in order that his purpose
[2:06:14] and good pleasure be brought to
[2:06:18] pass Ephesians 2:11 in whom also we have
[2:06:22] obtained an inheritance being
[2:06:24] predestinated according to the purpose
[2:06:26] of him who worketh all things after the
[2:06:29] Council of his own
[2:06:30] will brother brandham says hallelujah
[2:06:34] with an explanation point aren't you
[2:06:37] glad you belong to
[2:06:48] him I did want to point out one more
[2:06:51] thing
[2:06:53] God's
[2:06:55] purpose we see his purpose in
[2:06:59] Isaac we know that that lamb was a
[2:07:02] spoken word
[2:07:03] Ram brother brandom said it would have
[2:07:06] been eaten by wild animals there was no
[2:07:09] food up
[2:07:10] there there was no reason for that Ram
[2:07:13] to be there but God he spoke
[2:07:16] it we know that Jesus was that spoken
[2:07:20] word
[2:07:24] amen Jesus the spoken word is here
[2:07:28] today he wants to live in
[2:07:32] you he wants to manifest
[2:07:35] himself in
[2:07:38] you he has prepared a body for
[2:07:43] himself not just the life that you've
[2:07:46] had to go through but your life is a
[2:07:49] preparation of God
[2:07:51] he prepared your life these lives that
[2:07:54] we live all through history how he can
[2:07:56] see himself in the midst of the
[2:07:58] candlesticks because he was right in the
[2:08:00] midst of the body that he created for
[2:08:03] himself which you
[2:08:06] are you love him
[2:08:08] today you know what I love about him is
[2:08:12] I relate to Jonah and a lot of people
[2:08:13] think Jonah was not very
[2:08:18] smart but you know Jesus
[2:08:22] also related to
[2:08:24] Jonah he used that
[2:08:28] backsliding preacher's
[2:08:32] life the Bible says was running from the
[2:08:35] presence of
[2:08:36] God and he took that
[2:08:41] life and when the people were gathered
[2:08:43] thick together he began to say this is
[2:08:45] an evil generation they seek a sign and
[2:08:49] there shall no sign be given it but the
[2:08:53] sign of Jonas the
[2:08:55] prophet for as Jonas was
[2:08:58] in for for as Jonas was a sign onto the
[2:09:02] ninevites so shall the son of man be to
[2:09:05] this
[2:09:10] generation
[2:09:13] Hallelujah you know how God can take a
[2:09:16] broken vessel runner from his presence
[2:09:18] and make you a sign to this generation
[2:09:22] how we can take a backslid a backslider
[2:09:26] and a prophet would come and say he
[2:09:27] wasn't
[2:09:29] backsliding but God had a reason and a
[2:09:33] purpose for his life no matter what the
[2:09:35] condition look
[2:09:37] like you love him
[2:09:40] today walking in my
[2:09:46] shoes the Bible says a
[2:09:50] greater and Solomon is
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:09:55] here the Bible says that
[2:09:58] these same things that Jesus
[2:10:03] did you shall do
[2:10:06] also and
[2:10:08] greater and
[2:10:11] [Music]
[2:10:13] more he's called us out of the world
[2:10:16] he's called us out of
[2:10:18] Darkness he's called us out of our
[2:10:20] addictions he called us out of our
[2:10:23] depressions maybe you say oh I'm still
[2:10:25] in it no he's called you out of
[2:10:29] it yeah the the the symptoms might still
[2:10:32] be there the seaweed might still be
[2:10:35] wrapped around your
[2:10:37] neck maybe I don't know how he got out
[2:10:40] of the the bounds that he was
[2:10:42] in but God he released him at some
[2:10:48] point you may still feel bound you may
[2:10:51] still feel like you're in darkness but
[2:10:53] you're looking to the sacrifice you're
[2:10:55] looking to the promise you may be having
[2:10:58] the symptoms all around you but God has
[2:11:01] already set you
[2:11:04] free God has already spoke to your
[2:11:08] issue if you need healing he said by his

[2:11:41] you oh if you'd only look to that
[2:11:44] sacrifice if you'd only look to that
[2:11:47] cross if you'd only look to that spoken
[2:11:50] word that has has been
[2:11:52] provided if you'd only speak out the
