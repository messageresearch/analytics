We're looking forward to hearing the word tonight. Our good friend, Brother Bates. He's from the church there, the Saints, the Northern Lights Tabernacle. Northern Lights Tabernacle, brother. I We stole her. Yeah. I don't believe in proceliting, but if I did, &gt;&gt; yeah, you did it right. All right. So, Brother Ike McGowan is a pastor and him and his dear wife, Sister Karen, they would have loved to be here during our special meetings. they were not able to as they're working through the final process of her healing there in in in Texas and I spoke with brother Ike a little bit and they just working those details out and brother Bates comes from that little church there beautiful saints brother Davis is one of the assistant pastors there and we we al always appreciate brother Jonathan Davis and brother Ike and all those saints up there. And so we certainly appreciate the ministry and the saints. We love them. And so we're going to pull on that gift to God tonight. And um turn the service over to brother Bates. And let's give the Lord a hand of praise as he comes. Amen. Thank you, brother Israel. I just feel right at home here. &gt;&gt; Feel so comfortable. That was a really good presence this morning that was here. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. You know, I think &gt;&gt; if you, you know, sometimes as a minister, you know, I'll be at home praying hours before service and he meets you there. Sometimes I'll be back in the study and the songs are going and he'll meet you there. But he always never fails to meet me here. Sometimes he leaves me hanging till I get here, &gt;&gt; but he always meets us here, doesn't he, brother? &gt;&gt; You know, and then when he comes, then I feel like, okay, now I you know how brother Bram, I'm not I'm not comparing myself to brother Bram at all. just by even the skin on the bottom of his feet. But he'd say, you know, I'm waiting for something. &gt;&gt; We can't do anything without him. And so we we invite him. And I think we know he's here. We just want to make him welcome. He came with you. So he's here. &gt;&gt; We you know, we brought him with us. You brought him with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to turn in our scriptures. Appreciate Brother Poe. Good friend of mine. Someone I just came to love. The first time I I met him and heard him speak. I instantly in my heart just um we're kind of kindred spirits here. &gt;&gt; Two pe's in the pod. &gt;&gt; Love this man. &gt;&gt; Got a good pastor, but you know the devil doesn't want to keep it that way. &gt;&gt; So you pray for this man. Hold his hands up. You know, he's just a man, but he God placed him here and I know his heart. So you keep him in prayer &gt;&gt; and uh he doesn't tell me nothing, but I I'm just enough to pick up. I know what it is to try and, you know, labor for group of people. I think sometimes being a pastor is kind of like being a shepherd. It's nice to have sheep and they're all fuzzy, but there's a lot of clean up to do. So, that's part of a pastor's job as well. Yes, sir. Get the shovel out. All right. Let's go turn in our Bible to the book of Let's just go turn to Ephesians first. We're going to go to the book of Ephesians and chapter 3. just um little tonight. We'll keep it brief. Got the We got the the cool crowd here tonight. This is the Is this the cool the cool crowd? We got all these young people here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good. Well, then we can just share from our hearts. &gt;&gt; Don't have to worry about nothing. &gt;&gt; Just preach the word of God. So, Ephesians chapter 3, we'll just start reading out this first verse here and read down to verse 13. Ephesians 3. For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you, word, &gt;&gt; how that by revelation &gt;&gt; he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote a four in few words, whereby when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit, that The Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power &gt;&gt; unto me who am less than the least of all saints. Is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ &gt;&gt; and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery. which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ, to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places might be known by the church, the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. Wherefore, wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. Let's just pray. Gracious heavenly father, just reading the power of this word, a letter written by Apostle Paul, but it was written by you. He described it. Father, I had it scribed and now we get to read these words, and we're so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; We love you, Father. We ask that you would come, the inside teacher, and just break it to us, Lord. Help us, Father, just to see you in a in a mightier way. That we might know you in the power of your resurrection. And it might just change and transform our lives. That we could be more like you. That we could take this light to a lost and dying world. And they might know you as we know you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated. Kind of interesting. I don't mean this to pick at anybody, but to some of the spirits that are out there that would criticize maybe us playing a tape of the prophet in our church, would they also criticize us for reading a letter of Paul in church? &gt;&gt; I wonder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why are you reading the letter of Paul? &gt;&gt; You know, why would you take he was a man just like brother Maram? If you can believe that Paul was God's man &gt;&gt; and you could read his letter and and it's part of the Bible, &gt;&gt; then I believe that we'll we'll think about the the mystery of Christ that was brought to us in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I I think that um you know, the more I I've said this morning that the deeper it gets to me, the more I go in the message, but the simpler it gets. The message has never changed. is Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You know, and I think there's there's something that if you think about this message, it's it's so powerful when you see that there's one thing that God wanted you to see and he had it hidden. It was a mystery. What does the word mystery mean? something Rand said that that's been revealed that was previously hidden but still has an element of supernatural or mystery about it. We can't always understand everything that God does, especially the supernatural. But I want to read you this out of the crisis. The mystery of God revealed um 630728 paragraph 102 says, "Now God's secret mystery." This is what Paul was talking about this. He wanted everyone to see the fellowship of this be in fellowship around this mystery. What is our fellowship? Why do we come together? What brings us what is it that brings us together? What what is it that we commune around? Where the carcasses, the eagles gather? What is it we're feeding on? What is it that really? He says now this the secret mystery he had before the world began. So before there was ever a world, he had this thing hidden in himself. &gt;&gt; Now back in the back part of God's mind, there was something he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon, star, atom, molecule or anything. He was God, but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him. And now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery. And that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning. The hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how this unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living. See, &gt;&gt; then you'll understand clearly on what I believe what is being done. So this thing that God had, the whole purpose of everything that God created was to express one thing, all of it, all of creation, all the stories in the Bible, everything was one thing that he wanted you to see. Just one. God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knew anything about it. Even the angels didn't understand it. &gt;&gt; See, he didn't reveal it. That's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence. Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come. He said it it not even the son himself doesn't know when it's going to happen. See God has this all to himself. It's a secret. And that's the reason there was signs in heaven for a space of a half hour and seven thunders utter their voices. Now we we have how many of you have heard all these mysteries? There's the thunders mysteries and the this mysteries and those mysteries and all that. that Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God hiding in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Acting out something. And everybody goes off about all the details and they miss this hidden one thing he wants you to see. See, he said it's in the reason there was signs in him for a space of half hour, seven uttered voice and John was even forbidden to write it. See the coming of the Lord. Now look at this. this one thing he hasn't REVEALED YET OF HOW HE WILL come and when he will come. &gt;&gt; Not just it's a mystery of how he is going to come. Oh, how many of you seen him? You know there's this doctrine out there called Peruia. All that really means is that his presence because you know like there I think I can't remember what u what group it was back in the early 1900s but they were he's coming he's coming he's coming and when he didn't show up physically they said oh he came spiritually and they called it peruia it was not it was before the message they had this Peruja term it's a Greek word that just means his appearing or his presence brother Brandham preached the presence of God unrecognized &gt;&gt; brother Brham preached the real Peruja &gt;&gt; but people just go off and they want to say they want to make it spiritual if they can't do it this way or that way. &gt;&gt; But but he had to come in a way to his bride where we could see him. &gt;&gt; So he could reveal himself to his bride so we we would know who he was. &gt;&gt; He wanted to reveal himself to somebody that wouldn't be deceived by all the stuff that was going to come when he took his prophet off the scene. &gt;&gt; Someone who says, "No, that's not my husband because I know my husband. He revealed himself to me." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So he had to reveal himself in mercy before he comes in judgment. &gt;&gt; And so this whole entire message was something that God was doing and expressing. This wasn't brother Brandham's idea. &gt;&gt; Something that some man came up there and read his Bible and was just a good man and and and it was even more than a prophet. It was Jesus Christ saying, "I have hidden something that I wanted to hold off until the end." And I kept it sealed up from everybody &gt;&gt; of how he was going to come and when he was going to come. &gt;&gt; Now look what this next this next part is. He said how he come and when he come. It's a good thing he doesn't know. He showed or revealed it. And every type that's in the Bible. Every Bible story, every type has been hiding this one thing. See how simple it really is? You mean I I could see this great mystery if I He hid it in the type of Moses. He hid it in the type of Noah. &gt;&gt; In every age, it's been a one-man message. &gt;&gt; He sends on the scene someone that represents him, the word, to the word that needs to be redeemed for that age and pulls them out. &gt;&gt; It's been the same in every age. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there was someone he in Moses's day he said I personal pronoun have heard the cries of my people and I personal pronoun have come down to deliver them Moses you go &gt;&gt; and brother Brand said that was God going in the form of a man &gt;&gt; we don't worship brother Brandham &gt;&gt; but we know THAT IT WAS GOD &gt;&gt; EXPRESSING himself &gt;&gt; because who was Moses who was Noah Butterbraham said, "If you don't see Jesus Christ in every scripture of the Bible, go back and read it again. You've missed it." &gt;&gt; Because the whole thing was was was hiding and revealing one thing that he had in his heart, one purpose. I just love that he has showed or revealed it in every type of in the Bible. Therefore, THE ENTIRE BIBLE is a revelation of God's mystery in Christ. H the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and God's help will see it right here this morning what the Lord has in his mind all along and has expressed it. But Abraham said in this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He said if you ever miss it come back to this tape. Have you heard him say that? go back and listen to it and don't don't go out there and try to struggle with it and figure it out. Just say, "Lord, reveal yourself to me. &gt;&gt; I'm your child." And he'll give it to you. &gt;&gt; It's it's you know, it it can start with a I met this 10-year-old. You're you're 10, right? What was your name again? Rachel. So, I met Rachel. She's 10. Do you know Jesus? Yes, you do. Can you talk about all these great mysteries? Probably not. But you know him. and he will lead you once he reveals himself to you and you say, "I accept that." Then he'll give you more. You'll just keep accepting it. You'll never stop and say, "No, I don't believe that." Because you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; You're a believer. Believers believe the word. They say amen to every word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, you can't say, you know, because people say, "I just want Jesus and I do." It's Jesus only. That's what I believe. It's not Jesus plus anything. &gt;&gt; It's not even Jesus plus his bride because she is him. It's just him. We are Jesus. if we get in his you know right &gt;&gt; but you can't know Jesus apart from his word &gt;&gt; because he is the word in the beginning was the word and that's what was made flesh and walked among us full of grace and truth &gt;&gt; and went around doing what he did revealing who God was &gt;&gt; oh man don't you just love this &gt;&gt; amen you know it takes them it takes a you know because I think I was telling you like when um brother Brand preached the seals And then you know he starts with God of simplicity. God hiding in simplicity but revealing himself in the same. You watch a minister get up here in humility and in simplicity God can hide himself. But all a sudden God comes and you realize that wasn't that man. That's right. &gt;&gt; I remember Frank Dutton was a pastor of our church for years up there and his son D Ben Dutton was just, you know, the black sheep of the family and uh Ben was just, you know, he went to college and big big guy and like to fight in school and when he got back from college he got a a degree in criminal justice and he liked because they kind of think I'm not intellect but I'm really not but you know that they he he wanted to come cross with me a little bit intellectually and so we'd have conversations. Jesse remembers Ben, you know, watched him grow up. And one day he goes, he goes, "Jim, I know it's real." Because he says, "We know my dad." He's so add he can't keep a thought for five seconds. He goes, "Next shiny thing." You know, but he says when he gets behind the pulpit, he says, "It's like a quarterback in the pocket." &gt;&gt; He goes, "What is that?" Here's his own son recognizing something because he knew his dad better, you know, than a lot of people would. You know, sees all the backsides and the humanity of the man. But when when God comes on the scene and can hide himself in simplicity, he can reveal himself in the same. &gt;&gt; And God likes to do that. He likes to hide himself in the simple things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What makes God so great is he can become so simple that my friend Rachel can know him in the power of his resurrection &gt;&gt; and have faith in his word and move God on the scene. Right? You know, and so what I want to do this morning or this evening is just to think about this mystery that we have fellowship around and what it is to us. All right. So now let's get into another one. The unveiling of God 640614. He's talking about his daughter Becky and she was in this play called Carmen. It was a Shakespeare thing. They acted that in the in the school where she just graduated a few weeks ago. Now, maybe one person played three or four parts in order to do that. He changed his mask. Sometimes he comes out, he's this character. The next time he comes out, he's another character. But it's the same person all the time. And that's God. He changed himself from a pillar of fire to become a man. Then changed himself from that back in spirit again that he might dwell in man. God acting in man. What he really was. Jesus Christ was God acting in man. &gt;&gt; You want Jesus Christ? It's God acting in flesh. God was acting out the part of Noah. God was acting out the part of Moses. God acted out the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace. &gt;&gt; That was shadows and types. But then here comes in the fullness of time. And here comes Jesus Christ, the son of God. And in him was all the fullness and the whole expression of what God was. And he went to Calvary. But you know what? You were in him. Then &gt;&gt; hidden in that man was you. He hadn't separated the bride out of him yet. Oh, where did she come from? Who is the bride? We said that this morning about Adam. Called their name Adam. Male and female created he them and called their name Adam. And he said, and pick up your pen and write. How many you've read that? &gt;&gt; He said the reason why that he gave Adam a wife was to reproduce himself. And he said the reason why he gave Christ the bride was to reproduce himself. &gt;&gt; And if he's the word, then he has to reproduce the word. &gt;&gt; And when that word comes in you, a tabernacle that he could redeem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he could hide himself in simplicity in that. That's what give him glory. &gt;&gt; He wanted to he wanted to take a tabernacle that needed redemption. We s we read that this morning in the church age book 103. He predestinated you that he needed redemption so he could give himself reason and purpose of being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He said in the church age book that she is his work beaten gold. And he's going on he said and whatever she is he whatever he is she is to manifest. You remember that part? &gt;&gt; That's right. And he goes down and finally he says in fact in her in her is summed up and manifested the entire wisdom and purpose of God. &gt;&gt; How can we fathom? He says we can't. We have to accept it by faith. &gt;&gt; So he knew that he was going to predestinate part of his word that would fall out there in this dirt. That's you flesh. &gt;&gt; That he could redeem that by his word to his word. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And that you would be standing here today representing him on this earth. &gt;&gt; That's true. You know, and it doesn't always appear like what we should be. We read that scripture this morning. Now we are the sons of God, &gt;&gt; but we it doesn't really appear what we but he said, but one day we'll be like him because we're going to be in his we're going to see him face to face. &gt;&gt; So what we are we're struggling through this body that we're waiting for its redemption. We're waiting for the redemption of this body. &gt;&gt; But we are now the sons of God. We are now we're sitting in the heavenly places in Christ. We have this word right here. But we're waiting for a body change. How many wants the body change? Oh, but see now you remember I'm just going to give you a little quick little quick Sunday school lesson. Go back into the Old Testament. The the he was hitting in all these types. And Moses built this tabernacle. How remembers that? And all it was was just a a tent out in the wilderness. A tent to for God. See the type? Why wouldn't he just have Solomon build him a temple? But really, he was dwelling in a tent. And David had in his heart to build him a temple. He goes, "Why are you dwelling in a in a tent?" You know, when he goes, God said, "Look, I don't dwell in a temple made by man's hands." No, &gt;&gt; but go ahead. I'll let you build it. He says, "But a body hast thou prepared me." &gt;&gt; So this tent, you you go in there in the outer court and it's all subject to the weather. And then you go into the next, the holy place. And then it was a little bit more sheltered and you see the candlesticks and all that. But then there was the holy of holies, right? That was a type of something. God was acting out something. Where was he going to place his word? Behind some badger skin in a tabernacle showing that his whole plan. So now think about how you had to approach God to get there. &gt;&gt; You had to bring a sacrifice. Hallelujah. Man, I'm not a preacher, but I feel like I could preach right now. &gt;&gt; You had to bring a sacrifice because it required blood to come back and fellowship again with this word that you always were, &gt;&gt; but he had to bring you there. &gt;&gt; And so when you went in there, they had this this this altar &gt;&gt; and you had to kill the priest had to kill this lamb and blood was all over the altar. It was a messy thing &gt;&gt; and it was a mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Mercy was available. But then they had to cleanse the sanctuary. You ever heard of cleansing of the sanctuary? Go look it up. Go type it in your message search. Butterbrand said he had to cleanse the sanctuary washed by the water of the word. See, and then once the cle that that was then now a judgment seat. And when we get our new body, it's no longer going to be a mercy seat because his purpose of cleansing his sanctuary where he's going to dwell is done. So through seven church ages, he's been revealing what was in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On Calvary, when he got smitten, out comes seven church ages, showing each of those colors of the rainbow that was hidden in that diamond. Here's my attributes. Here's my gentile bride. Some from this age, some from that age, some from this age, but this is me. This is my bride. This is who. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She was hidden in him the entire time. &gt;&gt; He kept it a secret. But Greg, okay, now we're going to read another scripture. Okay, let me finish this this quote real quick. So he's talking about Carmen. He changed his mask. He comes out this character, but it's all the self-same person. And that's that's God. He changed himself from a pillar fire to become a man, then changed himself back again, right? And so he he might dwell in man. God acting a man. What he's really was Jesus Christ was God acting a man in a man. In a man, that's what he was. He changed from the pillar of fire. Then he come in which was a veil in the wilderness that God hid from Israel. Moses seen the shape of his body, but really he was hid all the time behind this pillar of fire, which was a logos that went out from God. But it's the same person all the time. The same person, God all time. In his way, he reveals himself to his people. And doing this, notice, see, he's revealing himself. What did he come in this form in our day for the same pillar of fire? The same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; the same logos, &gt;&gt; why would people be embarrassed about putting this picture on your wall? IT'S A PICTURE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND his prophet &gt;&gt; vindicating the word came to a prophet and that's how it came to us. &gt;&gt; You receive this word because you received a prophet. &gt;&gt; You can't receive the prophet, you can't receive the word. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. &gt;&gt; You want Jesus? How many want Jesus? &gt;&gt; Then we have to receive the one he sent. &gt;&gt; You want to do the works of God? Receive God. the one that God sends to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you were born to receive it because every age there was those who could receive the message for their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't very many. &gt;&gt; No. Noah's day was a very few. Moses's day, two, one in a million. Got into the promised land. Yeah. It's it's 120 in the upper room. Out of all Jesus's walk across, you know, his ministry, 120 in the upper room. How many out of this age? I don't know, but I believe there's a couple in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just say, "I'M ONE OF THEM." &gt;&gt; ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; You know, the doubter might start doubting, but he's a dissolver of doubts. Just say, "Lord, I want to move all this away and let that come forth right from here." &gt;&gt; Just say what he said. &gt;&gt; Confess his word. Love that. So, now let's read another scripture. Colossians. Where are we on time? Okay, we're doing good. Colossians chapter 1. See, because because when you see this, it takes away all this mysterious thing about Godhead and everything else, but God has to reveal it to you. It's sovereign. I can't reveal it to you. I'm just going to get you where you can find it, right here in the word. But you ask God to show you this. It's really simple. When you see it, you say, "Oh, I see that." Colossians chapter 1. Now, Abraham used this text for his crisis, the mystery of God revealed. He also um used it in knoweth it not. You should listen to him read it and knoweth it not. and knoworth it not that little message and if you remember that brother Neville had just asked brother Bram to speak like ad hoc he come in he says brother Bram and he's up there he goes um he said I was reading somewhere that was interesting to me where was that at he goes oh yeah here so brother Bram just contacts a scripture and preaches a whole entire message on knoweth it not but in in the middle of that message because he was he was reading that about um our church age that they were blind naked miserable poor and didn't know it said knoweth it not but in the middle of that he reads this scripture and you should hear him read it on there. Go play that part of the tape and knoweth it not and listen to brother Ram talking about this scripture we're going to read. He goes, "Who is this?" HE GOES, "BUTTER RAM ON TAPE." You know, just this is such a powerful scripture. So, we're going to start verse 12. Giving thanks unto who? &gt;&gt; The father. Okay, now we're talking about God the Father, which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear what? &gt;&gt; Son. So now, we were talking about the father. Now we're talking about his dear son. &gt;&gt; How many gods do we have? One. Okay, now listen to this. In whom, the son, we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. We talked about that this morning, right? We're forgiven. Who is this? The son who is the image &gt;&gt; of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. So this invisible God now had an image. He was expressing himself to the world through Jesus Christ who was the firstborn of every creature. &gt;&gt; The part of the body of Christ. If you're part of the body of Christ, you're Jesus. You're part of his body. You're just one of the members. Now listen. For wait, who is this now? This son we're talking about. For by him, who? The son. WERE ALL THINGS CREATED. WHAT? &gt;&gt; All things. &gt;&gt; How many things were created by the sun? &gt;&gt; All things that are in heaven. Where? And on earth, whether they're visible and in invisible, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers, all things were created by him and for him. So then who is the son? &gt;&gt; He's God. &gt;&gt; It's just an office that he was going to put where we could see him because we couldn't see the invisible God. So he had to become visible. So the word became made flesh so we could see who he was. And when you saw Jesus, they saw Jesus. They saw here's a simple ordinary little man, God hiding in simplicity, but look what he did. &gt;&gt; And and somebody saw that and said that's the one. I'm going to follow that. When you saw Jesus in our day come the word hidden in flesh again in a redeemed body you just said that's it that's God's voice I'm following it you were ordained for this &gt;&gt; to be part of this mystery now listen a little further and brother said when he's preaching this there in north he goes he says then before there was father son or holy ghost he was because he created all things thrones dominions powers principalities whether it was father son or holy ghost he created that he's the author of all of it. Now, so let's go a little further. And he is before all things and by him all things consist. Do you see who Jesus is? It's this invisible great God that had this this attribute in him that he wanted to express. And so out come this entire Bible showing what he had hidden in him which was Christ in you, the hope of glory. That's the mystery. That's the mystery that God had that HE COULD TAKE THIS WORD THAT'S CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH AND PUT IT IN you &gt;&gt; a redeemed vessel &gt;&gt; and say this is my bride because she is the word. &gt;&gt; She says nothing but the word. She believes nothing but the word. &gt;&gt; She says amen to every word because she is the word. Brother Brand said the reason why the bride can't be deceived is because she is that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She He said she doesn't know nothing else. She can't believe nothing else. &gt;&gt; Right. You can't be deceived not because you know you have some intellectual power. It's because you are the word. When you let the word go through you, you are the word. &gt;&gt; Now listen, he goes a little further. And he is the head of the body, the church. Let's just stop there for a minute there. Brother Bram said, there's only one provided place of worship. There's only one place we can come and fellowship around this mystery. And you know, you have all these, you say, well, why are there so many churches? That's okay. Churches are all good. I'm not against any churches. It's just a place where we can come and gather together. Bunch of rock tumblers is what I call them. Getting these rocks all He knows what church to put you in. He knows where to place you. But when we go up in the rapture, he said, "All these stones will come together perfectly." &gt;&gt; You know, when they built the temple, there wasn't a sound of a sammer, a hammer, or saw. That was all done in the rock core. That's where we're at right now. &gt;&gt; We're getting all the rough edges knocked off us. We're getting everything ready for the rapture. But when he calls us and we go in this this this this building is going to fit perfectly together. You're going to be right in your place where you're supposed to be and all the believers from every church is going to be in that. &gt;&gt; Right? So the church is just a rock quarry place where God put you for a while so we can get some of those things knocked off. Iron sharpens iron, brother Caleb, he'll come and say, "Brother Bates," you know, and he'll knock a little iron off of me and I'll knock a little back off of him. And but I love that because, you know, he made us that way. We're just men. We're just men and women. We're just humans. But but I like this because the head we have fellowship when we're our body connected to the same headship. So all these parts that are moving right now are all tied to this headship. That's the intelligence making it move. Your intelligence isn't making my hands move. So if we had the same head then we had the same revelation. If we had the same re that doesn't mean we're in the same spot. we progress, but it means that we had the same absolute. &gt;&gt; And so if I come to somebody and they they they they say, "Well, I can't believe that what brother said." Well, then I'm sorry you're not hooked to the same head I'm hooked to. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I I love you, but I can't fellowship with you around this mystery because you can't acknowledge the same headship. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; We're all one body. There's no shisms in this body. We're part of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; It is his revelation. It's his word. It's his revelation. We just get attached to it because we are part of it. And then if we are then that's what said the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost is that you say amen to every word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not understand it but you'll say amen to it. &gt;&gt; Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood. H that's a hard saying, you know. Well, then you're going to see the son of go. They started walking away. Goes to his 12. You're going to go to where are we going to go? &gt;&gt; Thou alone has the words of life. We're hooked to this headship. I don't understand it, but I'm going to believe it. I'm going to have a tent. People are like, "What? He said it. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO I DO WITH IT?" I just believe it. &gt;&gt; He's going to get a bear. It's twice as big as one as his den. Well, he broke the vision. He did. I don't They can say all they want to say. I don't need to do. All I know is what he said. I just say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about it. &gt;&gt; There's no fuss. There's no fight. There's no pressure. I just rested it. I'm resting on it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Say what's on the tapes." &gt;&gt; Amen. And so if there is something in us that's part of this body, the mystery of Christ is in you. You're just going to say amen to what he said. He's testing us. &gt;&gt; He's giving you the word test. &gt;&gt; Will you will you believe it no matter what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He told Abraham, "You're going to have a baby by Sarah. She was barren." &gt;&gt; And he let him go 25 years. Getting harder and harder and harder and harder to see it physically actually going to happen. But he believed it anyhow. Did he have his struggles? Like we we talked about this morning. He battled. The same devil wanted to sift him. He went with Hagar. He got Ishmael. He had all those things happen. He laughed. But when God wrote the record, he said he didn't stagger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He grew stronger in the faith. &gt;&gt; He believed God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what he's going to write about you. &gt;&gt; You didn't stagger. Well, yeah. You say, "Well, you don't see my struggle." I don't have to see your struggles. God knows. &gt;&gt; If you got that seed in here, it's going to say amen to every word. And and in the mystery of Christ is that word in us. We'll read a little further. It's right here. So that headship is so important. Who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence. So give him the preeminence. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When we come the church, give him the preeminence. What? What? And who is he? The word revealed in this hour. &gt;&gt; We're not ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; It's our life. &gt;&gt; It's him. It's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's our absolute. It's my everything. It's my all. I've given everything for this. &gt;&gt; I I've st my life on it. &gt;&gt; For it pleased the father that in him the son &gt;&gt; should all fullness dwell. &gt;&gt; Where's there any other fullness then? &gt;&gt; Where's there any other god then? &gt;&gt; And having made peace through the body blood of his cross by HIM TO RECONCILE ALL THINGS UNTO HIMSELF. By this I say, whether they be things in heaven or thing or on in earth or things in heaven. &gt;&gt; And you THAT WERE SOMETIMES alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were his enemy &gt;&gt; by our wicked works, separated from him, but he made a way to cleanse the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; So that he could dwell in there. &gt;&gt; So then what? We have to give him everything. We have to say I'm this is not my idea. It doesn't matter about what I think. It's his idea. &gt;&gt; I'm hooked to this headship. This finger doesn't get a thought. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It's not sitting there going, I don't want to go over there and grab that thing. It's just just it obeys the headship. &gt;&gt; Headship says live this way. We just live this way. &gt;&gt; We got that life in us. You know, have you ever laid on your arm &gt;&gt; and it you cut the blood off &gt;&gt; and then the head's telling to move and it's it can't there's no connection because the blood's been cut off. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden you you know you you get restored back to the blood again. You get restored back to the father. You get restored to the headship and all a sudden it starts tingling and hurting a little bit. &gt;&gt; But man, I'm telling you what, it'll start working again. And now I can I can I can communicate with my headship. &gt;&gt; He has preeminence. &gt;&gt; We have to keep the blood flowing. And go back to Calvary if you've missed it. &gt;&gt; It's where it all started right there &gt;&gt; where he made a bleach for us to be washed so he can cleanse his sanctuary so he could live in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go listen to invisible union of a bride. Washed by the bleeding word. Washed by the water of the word. No fault in you. the perfect sinless spotless bride of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How? By his word and you accepted it. He said, "How can you be washed if you won't? Let the word do it." So let the word have preeminence in your life. Here we go a little bit further. And you that were sometimes alienated to enemies in your mind by wicked works. Yet now the reconciled. So don't be putting other people out because they're enemies because they that you were an enemy once. &gt;&gt; We had that conversation. And now, you know, maybe maybe God can bring them in like he did you. &gt;&gt; So, just be careful. Be careful who you're talking about. It might be a Saul of Tarsus that might be Paul. It might be even Saul in the Old Testament who still went to paradise with Samuel. Even though he backslid, was chasing David around, he was still God's. &gt;&gt; Careful who you talk about. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; I have too much to worry about myself to worry about anybody else. &gt;&gt; My biggest I saw a little cartoon the other day. This guy was down there praying, "Lord, smite my enemies." And he said, 'Lord, smite my worst enemies with a plague of locust. And all a sudden, locus all over him. He goes, "Uh, let me rephrase that." His worst enemy was himself, right? No, this is the guy I got to worry about. This flesh, &gt;&gt; keep him down. Keep him dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. So now in this body of flesh that through death TO PRESENT YOU HOLY AND UNBLAMEABLE AND UNREPROVABLE in his sight. That's what he did all this for, was for you. If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which was preached to every creature under which is under heaven, where have I, Paul, made a minister, who now rejoice in my suffering for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake, which is the church, where have I made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me to for you to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery WHICH HAS BEEN HID from ages and FROM GENERATIONS, BUT NOW IS MADE MANIFEST TO HIS SAINTS, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of his mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. This mystery, this mystery was Christ in you. &gt;&gt; This word that created heaven and earth. This one that the son that was the kingdom of his dear son. And where's the where's the king's throne at? Where does he reign from? He sits and he reigns from the throne in my heart. Why? Because the word sits right here. &gt;&gt; This is now the control tower. Not this. Not reasoning, not motions, not conscience, not all my memories, but right here, the word of God. I just say, "Amen. I believe the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to understand it because there's no reasoning cap capabilities down here. &gt;&gt; You know that there's no reasoning in here. It's just faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't sit there and go, I wonder if Well, how could that be? When maybe that what? No. There's just I believe the word. You know, so when you hear these things that people make doctrines out of, well, if they're from the word of God, they're the word of God. They've been doing that for ages with the Bible. They did it with the message. So you hear all these things where they take a mystery and they make some mysterious thing where you have to have them. No, it's Christ is the mystery of God revealed to you. &gt;&gt; And how he reveals himself to you, you just take that and say amen and say, "Lord, show me more." And I'll say amen to it because I'm one of yours. I'm giving this place right here where it's a preeminent in my life where this word is my headship. So now he goes on and says um Christ in you the hope of glory. That's what it is. Who whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. That's what he was trying to do. That's what brother Brand was trying to do. He wanted to present you perfect as a bride to Christ. &gt;&gt; And he knew that it was going to be a struggle because he knew the devil was coming and all these distractions and all these false teachers and all this stuff and these, you know, antichrist spirit was going to come. But he said, 'I know the seed word of God will not fail because it's God's word. And where do he place it? Right here. Christ in you, the hope of glory. That's the mystery. The fellowship that we have is that we're believers. We have the same headship. I'll just read you a couple more things and then we'll be done. Who is this? Mazdc 652021E. Now notice, praise God for opening these seals is my prayer to know these things. Aren't you glad he opened the seals and revealed Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; He's just the word. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; He revealed it in every type in the Bible. And here we are. Now it's our turn. These are the these are the the flesh of this generation that he's using to act out his part. His final his final act. &gt;&gt; All the ages look to this age &gt;&gt; because it's the top of the pyramid. It's the it's going to bring the headstone. Aren't you excited? Does that make you excited? &gt;&gt; I love sister Sharon. She just she always has the same look on her face, but it's just like receiving the word and smiling about it. She's kind of quiet, not like her dad. He's a little more a little more noisy, &gt;&gt; but I like it, sister. God bless you. I feel that. You know, we're all part we're connected to the same headship and we can feel that. &gt;&gt; That's really good. Okay. So, what he said comes into view. So, he says, "Now the true revelation of Melzdc comes into view." What? He was God the Word before he became flesh. God the word because he had to be. No one else could be immortal like him. See, I had a father, brother. You did, too. Jesus had father and mother, but this man had no father or no mother. &gt;&gt; Jesus had a time he started. This man didn't. Jesus gave his life. This man couldn't because he was life. And it's the selfsame man all the time. I hope God reveals it to you. The selfsame person all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was hiding himself through all the entire Bible, showing his redemptive story through a one-man message in each age. But all that was a type of this age when he could finally bring his bride up and go, "Now this is her. I had this hidden me the entire time. I had hidden in me." So Satan was like looking like, "Who are these people? How is this possible?" You know, I I was able to get all the other wives to fail. I got Eve to fail. I got Israel, you know, to fail as a wife of God. I got the Jews to fail. You know, when Jesus came, I got him to fall in in in Ephesian church age when they started relaxing, drifting and the dickens came in and conquered the church. I was able to get in there and put my seat in there and make a bunch of hybrid church members. How is it that there's a word in this last age that won't spoil her skirts of purity &gt;&gt; because she can't be nothing else? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. MAN, I love that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, I just I as someone like me, a nobody from Alaska that was just a dead drunk in the gutter when he found me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But now I'm a dead badger and behind here is a shikina glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I start to think some days I get up in the morning, I go, "DO YOU REALIZE, JIM BATES, THAT RIGHT here is the one that created heaven and earth &gt;&gt; and your little problems about your bills or this or that and the other? What What are YOU THINKING? &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF HIS WAY." &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. And I don't care what happens. You can take You can take it all, but just give me Jesus. You can have my houses, my cars, my jobs. You can take everything. Just give me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because what what could be compared to this? There's nothing. We're almost there. We're right at the finish line, folks. We're right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right around the corner. Okay, let me read this and then I think we're going to wrap up. This is out of trying to do God's service without being God's will. 65 11127b. How many ever seen the picture of a cow in the bush? that you have to look and look and you know have you ever seen those ones where you have to kind of like there's like a pattern you got to go like this all a sudden boom there's some 3D pictures in there hidden &gt;&gt; and all a sudden you're like whoa you've seen those &gt;&gt; those pretty cool you're like well all that artist put all that together to hide one thing in there and then you have to look at it a certain way and all a sudden you see it and that's all you can see look at whatever says here he goes see that painter or he said like a picture of Christ in a bush or a sky or the clouds see that painter has got that so fixed up till you have to look at it a certain way well then once You see it, you can't see nothing else but that. Every time you look, there it is. How many seen those pictures? Well, sure you have. Well, that's the way Christ is himself. The gospel, the message is once you see the message of the hour, there's nothing else you can see but that. got all the creation. He spent all this time making this creation and all this time crafting all the stories in this Bible, but all of it was hiding this one thing. &gt;&gt; And all a sudden, you see it and you go, "Oh, I see it. It's Jesus. I can't explain it to nobody, but I see it. &gt;&gt; It's it's just it's the deep call to the deep." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I RESPOND TO THIS WORD. I RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE. I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; Isn't that something? &gt;&gt; You can't see nothing else. the rest of it's just a filler. Everything else is gone. You mean all these other things? And the people out here, you know, they're talking about all these details, but they miss him. &gt;&gt; They're arguing about what color his eyes are. Well, no, it's this kind of blue. No, it's that kind of blue. No, it's this kind of, you know, what color of hair did he have? Well, you know, but they miss him. &gt;&gt; They can argue about all the details, but that's just a filler. That's just something he was veiled in so that you could see who he is. This word for this hour. Don't get caught up in all this arguing and fussing over little details. Just say, "No, it's Christ and I believe it all." &gt;&gt; And if you're in this word, you should know your mate. Brother said that. That's feast of the trumpets. That's a freebie. Feast of the trumpets. He said, he said, "How is a bride going to know her mate, the revealed word, lest she's constantly in the word to know who he is?" &gt;&gt; You find him when you get in the word. So get in the word. &gt;&gt; It's your life. It's everything to you. You're part of it. Why wouldn't you want to be into it studying it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Get into Christ. &gt;&gt; Enter in. &gt;&gt; Push play and hear the voice every day. If you can read your Bible, &gt;&gt; say, "Lord, I this is me. &gt;&gt; I was hidden in you and this is me. I want to know more about it." And guess what? eternity is going to continue to reveal it on and on and on. Whatever's whatever's in eternity, there's no beginning or ending. So I I heard brother Brandon say all of eternity. And so I'll say all, but there's no all because eternity has no beginning or end. I think brother Brand just we have to use our little vernacular to be able to describe what we know. We're we're creatures of time. There's always yesterday and tomorrow, but with him it's just I am not I was or will be. I am. &gt;&gt; That's what you're part of. See now he says the rest of us just a filler. See once you see the message that's in Noah's time when Noah his group see when they saw the message nothing else mattered. Get in the ark. Right? When Moses's group saw it nothing else mattered. When John's group saw it nothing else mattered. When Jesus group saw it, nothing else mattered. When the apostles group saw it, nothing else mattered. When Luther's group saw it, Wes's group, Pentecostal group, nothing else mattered. But what about our day, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, he he he predestinated you for this age. &gt;&gt; And once you see it, nothing else matters. &gt;&gt; I I hear them all talking now, and I just feel like it's, you know, what was that Charlie Brown's teacher on the phone? It's like I I just It's soundproof to me now. I'm in the inner veil with Christ, the word, and all these people out here going, but what about this? What about too late for me? Sorry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't see nothing else. I can't hear nothing else. Nothing else matters. &gt;&gt; I found it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The girls in Alaska used to sing a little song, you know, I found him. What my soul, my soul had craved. Hallelujah. You know, I found it. &gt;&gt; The woman at the well, she was sitting there one day in her cage, a eagle in her cage, beating her head against the thing. married five times, living with some guy, no hope by the law. SHE WAS DONE. &gt;&gt; SHE WAS DONE. THE LAW SAID, "YOU'RE AN ADULTERESS. You're going to hell." &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Society had put her out. She couldn't go to the well at the same time as the other women. The church had put her out, and she probably put herself out, but Jesus didn't put her out. I have needs to go by Samaria because there's a little eagle there that was in me hidden before there was a world that I got to go bring a message to and she's going to receive it. &gt;&gt; And one day he came to her AND SHE SAYS, "OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I FOUND IT. BUT MY SOUL IS CRAVED. &gt;&gt; The deep calls to the deep." That's all. It's that simple. There was something needed to be quickened. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it quickened you to the word &gt;&gt; and the word is our absolute. It's our headship. I don't care if if my friend Rachel come to me and said, "Brother Bates, didn't brother Bram say,"Yes, ma'am. That's my absolute. I don't care who's packing it." &gt;&gt; I'm I'm submitted to the word. &gt;&gt; Now, you'll bring people will come to you with a quote. Now, that's just a devil. It's written. Well, it's also written, devil. It's also written. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what I love about your pastor. He's got such a balance in this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep him in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Devil always tries to pull you one way or the other, but that's finding a balance in this message. That's only the Holy Spirit can do that. See, so we were predestinated for things to happen for this day. That's the mystery of Christ. The fellowship we have is that he revealed to you message and that's all you can see and nothing else matters. We have a headship. We have an absolute that should give us something to rejoice about. I had one more quote out of Masterpiece, but we won't read it now. &gt;&gt; You want to read it? &gt;&gt; Read it. Okay, we're going to read it. Well, I sound like I got some believers in here. &gt;&gt; I remember when I You guys I I I think I shared a little my testimony with you, but I used to play in a rock band back in the 80s and up in Alaska and it had big hair. You sisters would be jealous. I had hair that looked like you put curlers in it. I'm not joking you. I'll show you a picture after church if you don't believe me. It literally looked like you put curlers in it. &gt;&gt; And I was embarrassed about that. So, I'd feather it out. And &gt;&gt; but you know, in in that state of mind, I I was still one of God's eagles. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, and I didn't know he was coming to me, but he was. &gt;&gt; I was an enemy to God with my my actions. But something on the inside of me quickened when he came to me. And out of all the people on the planet he could have picked, why did he pick me? &gt;&gt; You know, addicted to everything, just doing dumb stuff. But man, I'm telling you what, it changed my life just listening to one tape. It was a lead guitar player of my rock band that handed me my first tape. He didn't he didn't he his not even in this message but he gave me my first tape. There's a man here can turn on a light. &gt;&gt; I played that in my little truck and I had a stereo that would just rock the coffee off the top of the roof because I mean I had the the the blooper and the beater in my back. You know I could get a massage by the bass drum pedal. I'm I'm serious. &gt;&gt; I mean I had to open my windows at crack when I first turned it on because the air compression in there would like blow your eardrums out. Yet I put the prophet on that stereo. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a man that can turn on the light. That's my first tape. There's a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; I drove around listening to that for three days. And I started going, "Wait, I haven't smoked. When was I having my last cigarette?" I was smoking like probably a pack and a half to two packs a day. I haven't done any drugs. &gt;&gt; I haven't drank any alcohol. &gt;&gt; I go to work and they go, "What happened to you?" I go, "What do you mean?" They go, "You stopped swearing." Every other word was a swear word. I didn't have to quit anything. That was a miracle that God knew I needed. And it was the word coming to me and saying, "You're my son. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you up out of that mirror. I'm going to wash and cleanse you up and I'm going to fill you with my Holy Ghost and give you out there because this is me. You were hidden. You were you were one of my attributes." So this masterpiece, he says, "Behold my servant, the masterpiece that I have betrayed." So now he's talking about a masterpiece that God built through all these types in the Bible. He was building something that he had hidden. This invisible God there. So he said he he stands right before me a perfect there his own image reflecting God. So he created this image Jesus Christ and he looked down at it and he said it's perfect. &gt;&gt; He he said it's perfect. He said he said St. John 14 when you see me you see the father and he said in the beginning was the word was God and the word was God. Here there was that word made flesh. This very image of God. Now it was reflecting what God had in his mind all the time and said this is it. That's right. &gt;&gt; He stepped into it. &gt;&gt; He smoteed it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Speak." I love that. &gt;&gt; But I'm just going to skip down a little bit of this. He said, you know, in in in the word reflected in the masterpiece, in his own likeness, God back in his own likeness. The word form being reflected in the image of a man, the masterpiece, you know, the builder himself. He stepped into this. But I'm going to jump down here now and to about let's see paragraph let's go to paragraph um I'm I got some of this kind of skipped out on here so I'm just going to have to read it. You're gonna have to find it. So sorry you guys in tape room in the audio visual room. Let's see. He says here he says he spoke to the prophets that they were a potential image. see that he was hiding himself a potential image as he was bringing up to the head but when he came into the head it was all the image of God he was portraying himself then smitten for us now he's the masterpiece to us the gift of God Christ eternal I hope we never forget that you don't ever forget that he smiled him on Calvary for you &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; now listen what he says a bride that he might take him a bride so when his masterpiece was perfected then he had to smite it to take from him another piece not another creation but the same creation. What he was the beginning of the creation of God. By thing by him are all things created. By by him all things consist. But he was just taking another piece of himself. Now my brother, don't think bad about this, but think a minute. If he took from him the original creation to make the bride for him, he never made another creation. He took a part of the original creation. Then if he was the word, what must the bride be? It's got to be the original word. living God in the word. Now we see him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted the perfect lamb, sinner slain, a perfect masterpiece. Now for nearly 2,000 years, God has been asking him make again making him a masterpiece because he struck Adam. See, he struck Adam to get Eve out. He struck Jesus to get you out. &gt;&gt; And now he's building another masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Now she's the one that's been smitten and rejected &gt;&gt; just like he was. If they hated him, they're going to hate you. They persecuted him. They're going to persecute you. All that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. Right? It's just because it's the word in you. They're not rejecting you. They're rejecting the word. They love you, right? Oh, come on, man. Be one of us, man. Come and party with us. Come hang out with us. But that word's not welcome. Leave that at the door. &gt;&gt; Sorry. I can't go where he can't go. That's right. &gt;&gt; I I had friends in the world that thought were my friends. They the league guitar player, my rock band. Soon as I took to this message, they started dropping like flies. If I didn't have some pot to smoke or something, they Oh, we don't have any use for gym anymore. &gt;&gt; I had something the lily of the valley. I had something better. &gt;&gt; You want to get high? This is the kind of high you don't come down from. You You want to have peace? This is a piece that doesn't leave. &gt;&gt; Another masterpiece he struck at Calvary, got him a piece off. So, this New Testament has just been God revealing now the word in you, the ones he was redeeming to get back what he what was in him all along. This buying back what he already he had lost it, he's bringing it back to that word where what you always were in his mind. &gt;&gt; Never did it in the first place. justified, spotless, sinless. The the sanctuary has been cleansed. It's almost done. When he's completely cleansed the sanctuary, Brother said it's no more a mercy seat. It becomes a judgment seat. And if you get into the Revelation series, you'll see where Brother said he's going to come take his own throne. His father's throne was spirit God, the invisible in the heavens. He said his throne was in flesh. He's coming to dwell with his people. a thousand-y year millennium where it's going to be the bride and the groom together ruling and reigning for a thousand years with him in with him forever. Oh man. Hallelujah. I feel drunk right now just thinking about it. This is better drunk than I ever had. I'm not going to have a hangover in the morning. Hallelujah. It's the truth. A masterpiece for 2,000 years in making another m a bride for Christ. Another masterpiece. In so doing, he does it by his never-changing method. The same way he made the masterpiece, his word. That's the way he makes his masterpiece. So, he's making you by the word because you are the word and you have to let this word go through you. Just yield yourself to the word. Satan comes, just go back to the word. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. God gave you his word. That's all you need. I love that in the church age book where he said, "How can I overcome?" He said, "It's not so much what, but how." You don't have to worry about what the enemy is as long as you know how. And it's always the word. &gt;&gt; How did Jesus overcome? By the word. He comes to you and tries to tell you you're no good. Just give him the word. God said, "I'm righteous." &gt;&gt; You know, he became sin for you, your unbelief. We read that this morning about the unbelief that you could be his righteousness. &gt;&gt; I remember going through one of my biggest battles in life. And I was really, really going through it. And the brothers at church knew it. And so they were all kind of treating me with kid gloves like, "Hey, brother Bates, is everything okay?" I told his brother, I said, "Let me ask you a question." Said, "Can you tell me how righteous God is?" He's like, I said, that's how righteous I am. &gt;&gt; It's not anything I did to deserve it. &gt;&gt; But he said, he said &gt;&gt; he took my sin and I could be his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Put that coat on. &gt;&gt; Not mine. He gave it to me. He dressed me with it. It's not my right. It's his righteousness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why there's that's why you can't sin because his seed remains in you. It's because I can just say, "Look, I no I've accepted the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I've accepted it." And now I can say, "I'm sinless, spotless, brought living God." Not because anything I did, because I am in him. And in him there is no spot or blemish. If you can find fault in this message, then you're in trouble. &gt;&gt; But there's no fault in this sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Not any. It's perfect. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that little song. Um, I've accepted the word of the Lord. What is that? &gt;&gt; Can't you see why I'm happy? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can't you see why I'm happy? &gt;&gt; You guys want to know why Brother Bates is happy? &gt;&gt; Cuz somehow by God's grace, God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey son, I want to give you something. I've accepted it." He just give it to us. A gift. You just got to accept it. I like that. You know that picture of Jesus knocking at the door? Where's the doororknob at? On the inside. The the answer to everything is right there. He's knocking. You just got to open the door and accept it. Let him in. Okay, let's sing this together. Oh, can't you see I'm happy? Aren't you happy? I'm accepted the word of the Lord. A real word. Hallelujah. That was spoken. Hallelujah. Oh, come on. Sing it. Can't you see why accepted the word of the Lord was Oh, not a prophet of God. With all your heart this evening, can't you see why I'm happy? accepted the word of the Lord. The reveal word that was born by the prophet of Mia. Amen. Now, let's give our Lord a hand of praise tonight for that word. Amen. Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his face there to sing forever of his saving grace. On the streets of glory, he lift my voice. Here's all at last. Ever to rejoice as I journey through the land singing as I go into Calary to the crimson flow. Many arrows pierce my soul out with me. of my Lord leads me on him. I must win and know I want to see him. Look upon his face there to sing forever of his saving grace. on the streets of glory. Let me lift my voice.

But my Lord knows ahead and leads with every time. And though I want to see him look upon his face of his saving grace on the streets of glory, there lift my voice. Here's all pass. Home at last, never to rejoice. And when in the valleys, low I look toward the mountain high. And behold my savior there leading in the light. With the tender hand I'll stretch toward the valley.
