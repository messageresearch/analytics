[1:37] hair and the moon became as blood and
[1:40] the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth
[1:42] even as a fig tree casteth through
[1:44] untimely figs when she is shaken of A
[1:46] Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a
[1:49] scroll when it is rolled together and
[1:51] every mountain and Island were moved out
[1:53] of their places and the kings of the
[1:56] earth and the great men and the rich men
[1:57] and the chief captains and the Mighty
[2:00] Man and every Bond Man and every free

[3:20] Christian you don't die
[3:21] anyhow now Daniel 12 said that everyone
[3:25] that was found written in the book would
[3:28] be delivered
[3:31] here God is about to deliver his second
[3:34] son Israel after the tribulation see the
[3:37] second time Israel his Israel is his son
[3:40] you know that Israel is God's son so
[3:44] he's going to deliver him here in the
[3:46] tribulation period just exactly the way
[3:49] he did down in Egypt now let's stop here
[3:51] again and and get something else so
[3:53] before we bring it into home now watch
[3:55] here these two prophets look what
[3:57] they're going to do now just like Moses
[4:00] did down there and there was given me a
[4:02] read and um the third verse of the 11th
[4:05] chapter and I will give power unto my
[4:08] two witnesses that they shall prophesy
[4:10] 1,23 score days clothed in sackle these
[4:14] are the two olive trees you remember
[4:16] that zbell and so forth was rebuild the
[4:18] Temple and the two candlesticks to stand
[4:20] before the god of the earth If any man
[4:22] hurt them fire proceedeth out of their
[4:24] mouth remember out of the mouth of
[4:26] Christ come the sword word devire their
[4:29] enemies and if any man shall hurt them
[4:32] he must in this manner be killed now we
[4:34] know the fire in the 19th Chapter of the
[4:37] coming of Christ proceeded his sword
[4:40] from his mouth which was the word is
[4:43] that right the word oh if you get this

[11:42] Seal Pardon Me The Sixth Seal and the
[11:44] seventh seal the seventh chapter of

[12:00] 1313 and appears right here in the 13th
[12:02] chapter of
[12:04] Revelations that's right she's 13 and a
[12:08] woman now when he was about to deliver
[12:13] his only begotten son which was his only
[12:16] begotten Jacob is his son but this is
[12:18] his only begotten son Matthew 27 let's
[12:22] see what he did
[12:24] there Matthew the 27th
[12:27] chapter and I remember remember his son
[12:30] had been
[12:31] beaten and had been troubled and they
[12:35] had made fun of him and he was now
[12:38] hanging on the cross at
[12:40] 3:00 on Good Friday
[12:43] afternoon just about the take place
[12:46] Matthew 27th chapter of Matthew and the
[12:50] the
[12:52] 45th verse I believe it is now from the
[12:56] sixth hour there was Darkness over all
[12:59] the land until the ninth
[13:03] hour now notice just exactly what he did
[13:06] back here now in this sea and I beheld
[13:08] when he had opened the six seal alow
[13:10] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[13:12] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[13:14] the moon and the moon became his blood
[13:19] Blackness Darkness Egypt Blackness
[13:22] Darkness God delivering Jesus At The
[13:26] Cross just before he brought him up to
[13:28] the resurrection first
[13:30] Darkness sun went down in the middle of
[13:32] the day and stars wouldn't
[13:35] shine two days so many is going to raise
[13:37] him up with a mighty
[13:39] Triumph after the sun and moon and stars
[13:42] and everything in Egypt all these taking
[13:44] place he delivered Israel to the
[13:46] promised land here it is in the
[13:48] tribulation period here stands them
[13:50] prophets to who has the control of the
[13:52] word of God gives them they can only
[13:54] speak as God gives them the word amen
[13:57] now they're not Gods they're
[14:00] amateurly they are because Jesus said
[14:02] they were said you call them Gods who
[14:04] the word of God came but look that's the
[14:06] one God brings the word to and when he
[14:09] speaks it it
[14:11] happens that's all and here he is with a
[14:14] commission from God to Smite the Earth
[14:17] whatever he wants to oh my stop the
[14:21] heavens thank and he does what's the
[14:23] matter he's fixing to take the 144,000

[19:19] own City when beard Johnston
[19:23] prostitution and filth and scum like any
[19:27] other City
[19:29] why I believe God would be better off
[19:30] looking at the way he had it thousand
[19:32] years ago when the Ohio travel down they
[19:36] had no backwaters and floods they had no
[19:39] sin in the valley the Buffalo roome
[19:41] through here and the old Cherokee hunted
[19:44] him and made a decent living there was
[19:45] no trouble at
[19:47] all but man come
[19:50] in that's where sin comes in when man
[19:53] begin to multiply upon the face of the
[19:56] Earth then sin and violence set in yeah
[20:00] that's right always man right well I
[20:03] think it's a disgrace I standing the

[1:10:48] Bibles to Ecclesiastes the thir chapter
[1:10:51] and for our scripture reading today and
[1:10:57] I was listening in to some of the
[1:10:59] services from uh from Alaska there and
[1:11:03] it looked like brother Israel was uh it
[1:11:06] looked like he was having a good time
[1:11:08] looked like doing a good job there and
[1:11:10] so uh seemed like the people was was
[1:11:12] being blessed and so that's that's good
[1:11:23] Saints Ecclesiastes the third
[1:11:27] chapter pretty familiar scripture
[1:11:30] here Ecclesiastes 3 the first
[1:11:34] verse to everything there is a season
[1:11:37] and a time to every purpose under the
[1:11:40] heaven a time to be born a time to die a
[1:11:44] time to plant a time to pluck up that
[1:11:47] which is planted A Time to Kill a time
[1:11:50] to heal a time to break down a time to
[1:11:53] build up a time to weep and a time to
[1:11:57] laugh a time to mourn and a time to
[1:12:00] dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time
[1:12:04] to gather Stones together a time to
[1:12:06] embrace and a time to refrain from
[1:12:09] embracing a time to get a time to lose a

[1:12:20] keep silent and a time to speak A Time
[1:12:23] To Love and a time to hate a time of war
[1:12:28] and a time of Peace what prophet hath he
[1:12:32] that worketh in that wherein he labor I
[1:12:36] have seen the travail which God hath
[1:12:39] given to the sons of men to be exercised
[1:12:44] therein let me read that again I have
[1:12:47] seen the travail which God hath given to
[1:12:50] the sons of men to be exercised in it he
[1:12:55] hath made everything beautiful in his
[1:12:58] time also he ha set the world in their
[1:13:02] hearts so that no man can find out the
[1:13:04] work that God maketh from the beginning
[1:13:07] to the end I know that there is no good
[1:13:10] in them but for a man to rejoice and to
[1:13:13] do good in his life and also that every
[1:13:18] man should eat and drink and enjoy the
[1:13:21] good of all his labor it is the gift of
[1:13:24] God I know that whatsoever God doeth it
[1:13:28] shall be
[1:13:29] forever nothing can be put to it nor
[1:13:31] anything taken from it and God doeth it
[1:13:35] that men should fear before him that
[1:13:38] which hath been is now and that which is
[1:13:41] to be hath already been and God
[1:13:44] requireth that which is passed and
[1:13:47] moreover I saw Under the Sun the place
[1:13:49] of judgment that the wickedness was
[1:13:51] there and the place of righteousness
[1:13:54] that iniquity was there and I said in my
[1:13:56] heart God shall judge the righteous and
[1:13:59] the wicked for there is a time there for
[1:14:04] every purpose and for every work can you
[1:14:09] say Amen to the word this morning amen
[1:14:11] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[1:14:13] reading of the word you may be seated
[1:14:14] and uh I would title this this
[1:14:17] morning uh your season is
[1:14:21] coming and uh brother John of course he
[1:14:24] didn't know what I was speaking on this
[1:14:26] morning but I was listening to those
[1:14:27] songs and and U you know Saints there is
[1:14:32] a time appointed for you and I for all
[1:14:36] things can you say all things there's a
[1:14:40] time appointed to you and I for all
[1:14:43] things and ever since I gave my heart to
[1:14:46] the Lord's Saints I have been
[1:14:49] happy can you say Amen to that this
[1:14:51] morning but there are times in my life
[1:14:55] where I've been happier than others now
[1:14:58] I've always been happy but there's times
[1:15:02] where I have enjoyed myself more than
[1:15:04] others there's been good times and
[1:15:07] there's been bad times there's been easy
[1:15:10] times and there's been hard times
[1:15:12] there's been times of Plenty there's
[1:15:14] been times of famine there's been times
[1:15:17] where I was uh happy to get out of bed
[1:15:19] every day and then there's been times
[1:15:21] brother Miguel where I had to make
[1:15:23] myself get out of bed there's been times
[1:15:26] where I've enjoyed going to work and
[1:15:28] there's been times where I've hated
[1:15:29] every minute of it there's been times
[1:15:32] where uh my family's been doing good
[1:15:35] there's been times where my family has
[1:15:37] struggled there's been times where I've
[1:15:39] been doing good at work there's been
[1:15:41] times where I've struggled at work
[1:15:43] there's been times when the church is
[1:15:44] doing good and there's been times when
[1:15:46] the church has struggled there's been
[1:15:48] times when everybody's rejoicing and
[1:15:50] there's been some dry spells is that
[1:15:52] right Saints there's been times Saints
[1:15:54] there's been been times where my
[1:15:56] marriage has been better than others
[1:15:58] there's been times where my children
[1:16:00] have done better than other times
[1:16:02] there's been times where I've had a
[1:16:03] better relationship with the people
[1:16:05] around me than than I than I have at
[1:16:07] other times there's been times Saints
[1:16:10] where I've been a better Christian than
[1:16:12] I have at
[1:16:13] others there's been times where my
[1:16:15] prayer life has been better there's been
[1:16:17] times where it's been rough there's been
[1:16:19] times where I've I've read my Bible a
[1:16:22] lot more there's been times where I
[1:16:23] hadn't read it enough there's been times
[1:16:25] where I've heard the message a lot and
[1:16:27] there's been times where I haven't
[1:16:28] listened to it near enough there's been
[1:16:30] good times and there's been bad times
[1:16:33] and all of these times are ordered of
[1:16:35] the Lord can you say amen and so I I
[1:16:38] there's a time appointed for every
[1:16:41] season and every purpose under Heaven is
[1:16:44] that right Saints so if you don't like
[1:16:47] how things are right now today in your
[1:16:50] life just wait a minute cuz it's going
[1:16:52] to change amen if you don't like where
[1:16:55] you're at today just wait a little while
[1:16:57] and things are going to change amen or
[1:17:01] on the other hand of that if things are
[1:17:02] going great watch out because things is
[1:17:05] going to change amen things are going to
[1:17:08] change nothing's going to remain
[1:17:10] constant here we have no continuing City
[1:17:13] but we seek one that is to come and many
[1:17:17] times change you'll find is both good
[1:17:19] and bad is that right think about when
[1:17:22] you first got married sisters you might
[1:17:25] look at your husband today and say well
[1:17:27] he he's not as romantic as he was when
[1:17:29] we first got married well that may be
[1:17:31] true but he's probably not as big an
[1:17:33] idiot
[1:17:36] either so you take the good with the bad
[1:17:39] don't you sometimes things is good
[1:17:42] sometimes they're bad sometimes they're
[1:17:44] both is that right amen now brother Bram
[1:17:48] said in the believer's position in
[1:17:50] Christ in paragraph number eight he says
[1:17:53] God's Got A Time for all things he's got
[1:17:57] a time when he was he says we plant corn
[1:18:01] we got a time that we plow corn then at
[1:18:03] the time we harvest corn and the spring
[1:18:06] Rings crumb and the drought through the
[1:18:08] summer the fall rains the Snows and you
[1:18:10] can't just plant my wheat today and
[1:18:13] tomorrow go out and harvest it that's
[1:18:16] right you can't just plant today and
[1:18:18] tomorrow Harvest now there is a law of
[1:18:21] sewing and reaping but there's a time in
[1:18:24] in between and that time in between is
[1:18:28] ordered of the Lord is that right so
[1:18:30] everything has appointed times and the
[1:18:33] Lord's timing is
[1:18:36] perfect Saints there's not one thing out
[1:18:39] of cater it's all going according to the
[1:18:42] plan of God now you say well I don't
[1:18:44] believe so in my life brother George
[1:18:46] Well you may not understand it now but
[1:18:48] if you look back across your life you'll
[1:18:50] find that everything happened for a
[1:18:52] purpose
[1:18:56] now when you're going through some times
[1:18:58] when you're going through some struggles
[1:19:00] you might not think that everything
[1:19:01] happens for a purpose but it is for a
[1:19:04] purpose because the Bible said in Romans
[1:19:07] 8:28 my favorite scripture that all
[1:19:10] things work together for the good of
[1:19:13] those that love the Lord and so as long
[1:19:15] as you love the Lord you can have
[1:19:17] confidence that everything is working
[1:19:20] for your good is that right brother
[1:19:21] Chuck it might not feel like it's for
[1:19:24] your good but the Bible said it's for
[1:19:26] your good I choose to believe what the
[1:19:29] Bible says over what my feelings
[1:19:32] say amen and brother Braham said this
[1:19:35] God has uh believer's position in Christ
[1:19:37] and I'll tell you I'm going to read a
[1:19:39] lot from the believer's position in
[1:19:40] Christ today we heard this tape at a
[1:19:42] camp uh uh up in up in Canada there and
[1:19:46] it just blessed me it's only 40-some
[1:19:48] minutes long but it is a jam-packed
[1:19:51] 40-some minutes and so he says
[1:19:54] believer's position to Christ he says
[1:19:55] God has times for season and he has
[1:19:58] seasons for his word and he says he has
[1:20:02] times in the scripture where it said and
[1:20:05] the presence of the Lord was there to
[1:20:06] heal the sick and that's when Jesus was
[1:20:09] ministering to at the and at the
[1:20:12] presence of the Lord was there to heal
[1:20:14] the sick maybe at other times the
[1:20:16] presence of the Lord wasn't there to
[1:20:18] heal the sick now we don't like to think
[1:20:20] about that but I'm just reading what a
[1:20:22] prophet said he said maybe at other
[1:20:24] times the presence of the Lord wasn't
[1:20:26] there to heal he heal the sick and we
[1:20:28] find out that God works everything
[1:20:33] seasonally God works everything
[1:20:36] seasonally you remember how that the
[1:20:39] pool would be troubled the waters would
[1:20:41] be troubled and and when the waters were
[1:20:44] troubled if you was able to get in God
[1:20:47] would bless you now God was always a
[1:20:50] Healer but you could only be healed when
[1:20:52] the waters was troubled
[1:20:55] is that right so our job today Saints is
[1:20:58] when the water is troubled jump in amen
[1:21:01] don't stand back and watch and don't
[1:21:03] stand back and criticize but when the
[1:21:05] water is troubled jump on in there
[1:21:08] today amen so we understand that God's
[1:21:11] word that he was always a Healer he's
[1:21:14] always a Healer is that right and he
[1:21:17] says but there are times when the
[1:21:19] presence of the Lord was there to
[1:21:22] heal amen other times he may not be
[1:21:26] there to heal but remember I was
[1:21:28] thinking about this brother Brown talked
[1:21:29] about those two sisters or not two well
[1:21:32] were Two Sisters in Christ but the two
[1:21:34] ladies that went through the prayer line
[1:21:36] and one of them had an ulcerated stomach
[1:21:38] and the other one had some kind of tumor
[1:21:40] on her neck y'all remember that Saints
[1:21:43] and and and brother brandom said that
[1:21:45] that they were prayed for in the prayer
[1:21:47] line and they left out of there they
[1:21:49] were still sick and and one sister he
[1:21:51] said she just kept on testifying she
[1:21:54] kept on testifying how God had healed
[1:21:57] her and she kept on and she kept on and
[1:21:59] she kept on so much so that her husband
[1:22:01] who was a Baptist I believe brother brah
[1:22:03] said he he he got on to her and said
[1:22:05] you're you're bringing a reproach
[1:22:07] because you're sitting here sick you
[1:22:09] can't eat you can't you can't you can't
[1:22:11] hold nothing down and you're saying
[1:22:13] you're healed when it's obvious you're
[1:22:15] not healed and you're bringing a
[1:22:16] reproach but Saints she wasn't
[1:22:18] testifying to what she felt she was
[1:22:20] testifying to what the word
[1:22:23] said she wasn't bringing a reproach she
[1:22:26] was testifying to what the word of God
[1:22:28] said and brother BR said one morning she
[1:22:31] got up and she'd fix breakfast for the
[1:22:33] kids and there was some oatmeal left on
[1:22:36] the table and a piece of toast left on
[1:22:38] the table and she said oh that looks
[1:22:39] good but that just burned me up if I
[1:22:41] tried to eat
[1:22:43] that but she eat it
[1:22:46] anyway is that right is that what he say
[1:22:48] say she eat it anyway two months after
[1:22:51] she'd been prayed for she'd struggled
[1:22:54] for two months solid after she'd been
[1:22:57] prayed for and she got up one morning
[1:23:00] and that toast looked
[1:23:02] good amen I'll tell you they a't a
[1:23:04] morning of my life toast don't look good
[1:23:05] to
[1:23:09] me and she said she said I'm going eat
[1:23:12] it she ate it and she said I'm going to
[1:23:14] pay for that but I'm going to eat it
[1:23:17] anyways and he said a few minutes went
[1:23:20] by and she said she felt hungry again
[1:23:24] brother Brown say she scooped her out
[1:23:26] some more oatmeal and eat that oatmeal
[1:23:29] and a little bit later she was hungry
[1:23:31] again he said she fried her up some eggs
[1:23:34] and some bacon got her a cup of coffee
[1:23:36] come on somebody this morning got her a
[1:23:38] cup of coffee and she had her a
[1:23:39] gastronomical jubilee that
[1:23:43] day and she was so excited she ran down
[1:23:46] the street to tell her her the sister
[1:23:48] that was with her that had been prayed
[1:23:49] for also and she got to the house and
[1:23:52] she thought somebody died
[1:23:56] cuz she was heard all the screaming and
[1:23:58] commotion going on when she walked in
[1:24:00] that sister was fluffing out the
[1:24:03] sheets trying to find where that tumor
[1:24:06] went that was on her neck but it wasn't
[1:24:09] there she said I went to bed last night
[1:24:11] looking at that tumor in the mirror and
[1:24:13] it's not there today he said that
[1:24:15] healing angel had come through that way
[1:24:24] times and
[1:24:26] Seasons but God's always a Healer amen
[1:24:32] he said the very he said this I love
[1:24:35] this he said uh uh uh I'm sorry back
[1:24:39] there y'all on the message why I just
[1:24:40] want to read a little bit of this quote
[1:24:42] I'm gonna skip down a little bit he says
[1:24:45] when
[1:24:46] I he says now I got their names and
[1:24:50] addresses for documented statements now

[1:24:56] message today they don't ever bring up
[1:24:59] this we got names and addresses for
[1:25:03] documented statements where these
[1:25:05] sisters was sick and then God healed
[1:25:08] them and he said when that angel of God
[1:25:11] he said he said any B any now anybody
[1:25:15] that's a Bible student knows that
[1:25:17] sometimes God does not come right on the
[1:25:19] scene when he should come that we think
[1:25:23] he should you remember Daniel Prayed and
[1:25:26] it was 21 days before the angel could
[1:25:29] get to
[1:25:30] him that's right how many he knows that
[1:25:34] he says he says what happened the very
[1:25:36] angel of God that made the promise not
[1:25:40] me now I had nothing to do with it the
[1:25:43] very angel of God that spoke to those
[1:25:46] two sisters through brother Bram and
[1:25:49] told him that they were healed he said
[1:25:51] that very angel of God he says I didn't
[1:25:53] know him but it said thus sayith the
[1:25:56] Lord it taken him almost two months and
[1:25:59] he was passing through the neighborhood
[1:26:02] confirming what the word had been
[1:26:06] spoke see when the word is spoke it's
[1:26:09] going to happen amen it might not happen
[1:26:12] when we want it to happen it might not
[1:26:15] happen when we think it should happen
[1:26:17] but it is going to happen
[1:26:22] Saints but let me tell you this yes he
[1:26:24] was just as much healer after it was
[1:26:27] spoke as he was when the healing finally
[1:26:29] took
[1:26:32] place
[1:26:35] amen so the Lord doesn't
[1:26:38] change his times and seasons
[1:26:41] change amen you know when he does what
[1:26:44] you know when he does something when he
[1:26:46] wants
[1:26:48] to he does what he wants to do we're not
[1:26:51] in charge of God God's in charge of
[1:26:53] everything
[1:26:54] amen and and when he heals you when he
[1:26:56] gets ready to when he wants
[1:27:02] to now I was thinking also about that
[1:27:07] little brother running down the street
[1:27:08] holler praise the Lord for healing me
[1:27:11] when his eyes come open brother Bram
[1:27:12] gives an example of Moses he said he
[1:27:15] knew he was to be a
[1:27:17] deliverer and he said but he was trying
[1:27:19] and he was trying to do the right thing
[1:27:21] but he was at the wrong time so Moses
[1:27:24] was born and he knew he was to be a
[1:27:26] deliverer and he was trying to do right
[1:27:29] he was trying to deliver his people but
[1:27:31] he failed brother Bram said to recognize
[1:27:34] the time element of God he was trying to
[1:27:37] do the right thing but it wasn't time
[1:27:41] yet is that right Saints and he he went
[1:27:45] out and brother BR said he did it
[1:27:46] himself and he slew the
[1:27:50] Egyptian and that's where he failed and
[1:27:53] brother Brown said in a believer's
[1:27:55] position in Christ he says now he said
[1:27:57] in that Moses when he was here knowing
[1:28:00] that God made a promise and that he was
[1:28:02] going to deliver the children of Israel
[1:28:05] while Moses knowing that he was called
[1:28:07] for that purpose now when you have a
[1:28:09] call from God that doesn't all together
[1:28:13] mean you just jump right
[1:28:15] out let me read that again when you have
[1:28:19] a call from God it doesn't altogether
[1:28:22] mean that you just jump right
[1:28:24] out and he says and you're doing the
[1:28:27] will of God he says you have to find the
[1:28:31] will of God and the time of God to do it
[1:28:36] Moses thought well the children of
[1:28:37] Israel will understand now that I'm to
[1:28:40] be their deliverer so he starts out to
[1:28:43] do so and killed a man and he found out
[1:28:47] that it the children of Israel did not
[1:28:51] understand so Moses knew the word of the
[1:28:54] Lord and he knew that God had promised
[1:28:58] to deliver the children of Israel and he
[1:29:00] knew that he was called for that purpose
[1:29:04] but brother BR said we don't just jump
[1:29:05] right in there when we feel a calling of
[1:29:07] God on our life he didn't he didn't use
[1:29:10] the method that the prophet taught us of
[1:29:13] remaining
[1:29:14] neutral and going to the Lord in prayer
[1:29:17] amen and feeling how we feel led and
[1:29:21] then
[1:29:22] waiting and seeing how we feel led and
[1:29:25] then waiting some more brother
[1:29:28] Chuck and then brother Brown said then
[1:29:30] you commit it to the Lord in prayer and
[1:29:32] you go the way you feel led and you have
[1:29:35] confidence that if you make the wrong
[1:29:37] decision you're doing it in prayer and
[1:29:40] you're doing the best that you
[1:29:42] can and he said then you have confidence
[1:29:45] that if you make the wrong decision the
[1:29:47] Lord will straighten you out he said
[1:29:49] Paul started this way but he got a
[1:29:52] Macedonian call right that's right and
[1:29:56] if you're doing it in prayer you're
[1:29:57] doing the best that you can amen so many
[1:30:01] times we find people are paralyzed they
[1:30:03] don't want to do anything because they
[1:30:04] don't want to do the wrong thing and
[1:30:06] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:30:08] do but if you follow the steps and you
[1:30:11] follow the process do something
[1:30:17] Saints and he made the Assumption Moses
[1:30:20] did that a lot of us made he assumed
[1:30:23] that if it was in God's word it was
[1:30:26] God's will for
[1:30:28] him but he failed to recognize it must
[1:30:31] be God's time and season
[1:30:37] also now brother BR said Believers
[1:30:41] position in Christ paragraph 11 he said
[1:30:42] as Full Gospel people I think we've made
[1:30:46] many mistakes by looking into the word
[1:30:50] and say God said this and we failed to
[1:30:54] find the direct revelation of our life
[1:30:58] to fit this
[1:31:00] program my that's rich
[1:31:03] Saints he says when we find that then
[1:31:06] it's got to
[1:31:08] happen and I think there's where it has
[1:31:11] been failed
[1:31:13] see that's such a striking
[1:31:16] statement that as Full Gospel
[1:31:19] people and we are full gospel
[1:31:22] Saints he said
[1:31:24] we look into the word and we say God
[1:31:28] said this so it's his will for
[1:31:32] me and I'll tell you if we read
[1:31:34] something in the word it's got to fit
[1:31:38] the rest of God's pattern see we can't
[1:31:42] read something in the word and say well
[1:31:45] that must mean this it's got to flow
[1:31:49] through God's pattern this Bible amen we
[1:31:52] we can't just listen listen to the
[1:31:54] message and take one quote and say this
[1:31:58] means
[1:31:59] that because it's got to fit the rest of
[1:32:02] God's pattern it it's it's not only that
[1:32:05] when you figure out what it says and you
[1:32:08] think you understand what it means and
[1:32:10] you have it saying something contrary to
[1:32:13] what the Bible said you got that figured
[1:32:15] out wrong too because the message will
[1:32:18] not contradict the Bible now people will
[1:32:20] try to take part of the message and make
[1:32:22] it contradict this Bible but it cannot
[1:32:25] contradict what's already been
[1:32:29] spoken amen that's where the message
[1:32:32] gets blamed for a lot of falsehood that
[1:32:34] the message didn't do if somebody took
[1:32:37] something the message said and try to
[1:32:38] make it say something it didn't
[1:32:41] say see you can take a quote over here
[1:32:44] and a quote over there and piece them
[1:32:46] together and say well brother BR said
[1:32:48] these two things so that means this but
[1:32:50] if it don't run in continuity with the
[1:32:52] rest of the message it's not right see
[1:32:55] Saints you you you got to look at what
[1:32:57] he said before what he said after what
[1:33:00] kind of context was he saying it
[1:33:06] in what did he say the paragraph before
[1:33:09] the paragraph after what do he say the
[1:33:10] message before and the message after see
[1:33:13] if you listen to stature of a perfect
[1:33:15] man you'll get one understanding but if
[1:33:17] you don't listen to Blasphemous names at
[1:33:20] the same time you'll never truly
[1:33:22] understand the virtues of to
[1:33:24] God because he he he he he sheds more
[1:33:28] light on
[1:33:31] it now if you listen to recognizing your
[1:33:35] day and this message you'll find what
[1:33:36] brother Bram said about cutting and
[1:33:37] splicing these tapes it's pretty severe
[1:33:41] and we don't have to worry about cutting
[1:33:43] and splicing today so much what we got
[1:33:45] to worry about is copying and
[1:33:47] pasting but it's the same thing taking
[1:33:50] part of what he said taking this over
[1:33:52] here and try to add it to that over
[1:33:54] there amen we try to place things out of
[1:33:58] context I can't remember if I talked
[1:34:00] about this the last time I was here or
[1:34:01] not but I had a brother that used to
[1:34:03] minister for me and I asked him to
[1:34:05] minister and he said brother George I'm
[1:34:07] not ministering anymore he said I
[1:34:10] forfeit my right to minister to play the
[1:34:15] tapes
[1:34:16] now we all love playing tapes and we
[1:34:20] love hearing the word of
[1:34:22] God but I said said brother you're
[1:34:25] taking that type out of
[1:34:27] place because brother brandom when he
[1:34:30] said he forfeit your rights he said you
[1:34:32] got a right to
[1:34:34] smoke you got a right to drink you got a
[1:34:37] right to these things by the law you got
[1:34:39] a right to do it you get 21 years old or
[1:34:41] whatever the age is now you can you go
[1:34:43] buy legally you got a right to go buy
[1:34:45] alcohol or you got a right to go buy
[1:34:47] cigarettes you got a right to do those
[1:34:50] things you got a right to do it but to a
[1:34:54] Christian you forfeit your rights to
[1:34:57] serve God we forfeit our right to sin we
[1:35:01] forfeit our right to drink and smoke and
[1:35:04] we forfeit our our right I guess it's
[1:35:06] our legal right to say whatever we want
[1:35:08] to say whenever we want we forfeit those
[1:35:10] things we forfeit our right to those
[1:35:12] things because we're Servants of God but
[1:35:15] we do not forfeit our god-given rights
[1:35:19] I'm not going to Forfeit my right to
[1:35:21] preach the gospel I'm not going to
[1:35:23] Forfeit my right to be healed come on
[1:35:25] Saints today I don't forfeit my right to
[1:35:27] be saved today I don't forfeit my right
[1:35:30] to apply the token to my family I don't
[1:35:32] forfeit my right to God's
[1:35:35] word I don't forfeit the rights that
[1:35:38] Jesus Christ paid for that I might be
[1:35:41] blessed I'm not going to spit in his
[1:35:43] face and tell him I don't want the
[1:35:45] rights that he paid for yes sir it's all
[1:35:49] right Saints you got a right today to
[1:35:51] claim your healing you got a right today
[1:35:54] to claim your family you got a right
[1:35:56] today for the Holy Ghost you got a right
[1:35:58] to peace and love and joy it's your
[1:36:01] rights today we don't forfeit those
[1:36:04] rights we got a right to these things
[1:36:07] it's when you take something to Prophet
[1:36:09] said and you it might sound good but
[1:36:12] it's got to fit the
[1:36:20] pattern I've also seen Saints
[1:36:24] where many times when brother brandom
[1:36:25] says things and he's talking and he's
[1:36:30] trying I've always said brother Brown
[1:36:32] spins the first half of the message
[1:36:35] trying to explain to you what to look
[1:36:38] for trying to explain who he is and then
[1:36:42] he spends a laugh half
[1:36:45] demonstrating why he is what we should
[1:36:47] be looking
[1:36:48] for is that right he tells the people
[1:36:52] we're looking for this to come we're
[1:36:54] looking for this to come we're looking
[1:36:56] at these scriptures and we're seeing
[1:36:57] this to come and then that discernment
[1:36:59] line starts and he demonstrates why he
[1:37:02] is what he told us to look
[1:37:05] for and when he's trying to explain
[1:37:07] things many times he says things like we
[1:37:10] or
[1:37:11] us amen but he's talking about himself
[1:37:16] he's trying to get us to see who he is
[1:37:19] he's trying to get us to recognize he he
[1:37:22] can't just come right out out and say I
[1:37:24] am the Messenger of Malachi 4 I am the
[1:37:28] Messenger of Revelations 10:7 but he
[1:37:30] tells you what they are and he tells you
[1:37:32] what they'll do and then he demonstrates
[1:37:35] why he's
[1:37:38] that
[1:37:41] amen but sometimes he says it in a way
[1:37:44] where we think oh that's us
[1:37:45] too amen that man was
[1:37:51] special and I want to do my part
[1:37:54] but nobody can take his
[1:37:58] place trying to do God a service without
[1:38:00] being his will I love this he said
[1:38:05] there's five
[1:38:07] musts he said I want you to remember
[1:38:10] these I'm gonna skip down just a little
[1:38:12] bit to save time he
[1:38:19] said let me go down to paragraph 118
[1:38:24] paragraph 119 he said ' there is your
[1:38:27] five
[1:38:28] musts he said' it's got to be that way
[1:38:31] it's got to be his
[1:38:33] time his
[1:38:35] season when he said it would be and he
[1:38:39] says and the man he chose must be a
[1:38:43] prophet and he said and that Prophet
[1:38:46] must be
[1:38:48] Vindicated and if you don't have those
[1:38:51] five elements in place then you're
[1:38:53] placing it
[1:38:55] incorrectly
[1:38:57] amen now many times we find that we must
[1:39:01] wait on the
[1:39:05] Lord there's a
[1:39:07] law of sewing and a law of reaping and
[1:39:11] that law still stands
[1:39:13] today and but we don't know Saints when
[1:39:16] you make the deposit you don't know how
[1:39:18] long it's going to be before you get the
[1:39:20] interest on it we just don't know that's
[1:39:23] all in God's place and the reason for
[1:39:26] that is that we must learn as Believers
[1:39:29] today that we are helplessly dependent
[1:39:33] on the grace of almighty
[1:39:35] God there there there's not one thing
[1:39:37] that I have the ability to do in myself
[1:39:40] to deserve God's blessings I I can't
[1:39:43] work enough work for the Lord to be
[1:39:45] blessed of the Lord I I I can't I can't
[1:39:47] I wasn't good enough when I was born to
[1:39:50] be blessed to the Lord you wasn't good
[1:39:52] enough none of us was good enough we're
[1:39:54] all completely dependent on the grace of
[1:39:57] God today can you say Amen there there's
[1:39:59] there's none of us we we might feel like
[1:40:01] Oh I'm a good Christian and I'm a good
[1:40:03] well if you are a good Christian it's
[1:40:05] because of the grace of God we never
[1:40:08] earned that we didn't go looking for it
[1:40:10] God came found
[1:40:12] us so if there's anything good about us
[1:40:15] and I know we got a lot of good
[1:40:16] attributes and a lot of good qualities
[1:40:18] trust me it didn't come from me
[1:40:23] it only came from him I know because I
[1:40:26] know what I was without him I know the
[1:40:29] man that I was without him and I know
[1:40:32] there's anything good it only came after
[1:40:36] him we're dependent on the grace of God
[1:40:40] no matter how long we've been in the
[1:40:41] message you've been in the message 50
[1:40:43] years you're still dependent on his
[1:40:47] grace amen we're so tied up on works and
[1:40:51] I I believe in works we're so tied up on
[1:40:54] those things though people say well that
[1:40:57] brother told Brother Bram said I ain't
[1:40:58] preaching no clothline religion well we
[1:41:01] got to preach a clothline religion
[1:41:03] brother Bram said if you're not
[1:41:04] preaching a closed line religion then
[1:41:05] you're not preaching the
[1:41:07] gospel so we need some more of
[1:41:11] that but we still are dependent on the
[1:41:14] grace of God you can get the dress right
[1:41:16] you can get the hair right you can get
[1:41:18] all the the the verbalization right you
[1:41:21] can say the right things you can know
[1:41:22] the right quotes but you still got to
[1:41:25] have the grace of
[1:41:29] God now one of my favorite stories I
[1:41:32] shared it Thursday night in Mesa so if
[1:41:34] mesa's streaming in today listen to it
[1:41:37] again it won't hurt it ain't going to
[1:41:39] hurt
[1:41:42] nobody he says in key to the door he's
[1:41:45] talking about Papa Cox y'all know the
[1:41:48] story about Papa Cox he said this old
[1:41:51] man was a nice old man and he says I
[1:41:54] liked him well what would you give to
[1:41:56] hear Brother Brown say that about you
[1:41:59] amen he said I went to see him and I
[1:42:02] said Papa why don't you become a
[1:42:05] Christian and he said he loves me and he
[1:42:08] said brother brandom I would become a
[1:42:10] Christian when I can get good
[1:42:14] enough and he says I tell you what do
[1:42:16] Papa you look around till you find where
[1:42:19] you can get good enough then tell me
[1:42:21] where that place is and I want to go
[1:42:24] too is that right s now you can't work
[1:42:28] your way in there and he
[1:42:31] says he says I said Christ never come to
[1:42:35] save good man he come to save bad
[1:42:40] man well thank the Lord for that Saints
[1:42:43] Christ come for me and he says when you
[1:42:46] think that you're good he didn't come to
[1:42:49] save you he come to save them that he
[1:42:52] knows are bad
[1:42:53] right Christ died to save Sinners see
[1:42:56] and I said papa there's a line right
[1:42:58] here and he says well I I smoke these
[1:43:00] cigarettes I said I ain't going to even
[1:43:02] talk about them he said I've tried to
[1:43:05] give them up brother brandom I said all
[1:43:07] right we we ain't going to talk about
[1:43:10] cigarettes he says well when I can I
[1:43:13] said don't don't say no more about them
[1:43:17] that's right let him go he said I want
[1:43:20] to ask you a question he said all right
[1:43:21] what is it he said Do You Believe
[1:43:23] believe there is a God he said certainly
[1:43:25] I believe it he said I believe that as
[1:43:27] strong as you do I would guess brother
[1:43:28] brandom and I said do you believe that
[1:43:31] that same God crossed his strain and was
[1:43:33] made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the
[1:43:36] person of Jesus Christ in order to save
[1:43:39] save
[1:43:40] man he said yes I believe
[1:43:43] that and he said he died to save sinners
[1:43:46] like you and I
[1:43:48] see yes I believe that I said now it's
[1:43:52] just like this we're all in one big
[1:43:54] building over here and we're in
[1:43:56] jail and I can't stand over in this
[1:43:59] corner and say this will help me get out
[1:44:01] of jail I stand over in in that corner
[1:44:03] and say that will help me get out of
[1:44:05] jail we're all in the same
[1:44:07] fix and every man that was born in this
[1:44:10] world was born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:44:13] come in the world speaking lies he's a
[1:44:17] renegade to begin with now this is very
[1:44:20] interesting he says someone asked the
[1:44:22] other day said brother brandom if there
[1:44:24] would be any difference between Adam and
[1:44:26] Eve and their children today if they
[1:44:28] were all naked walking in would their
[1:44:30] bodies be the same I said no
[1:44:33] sir so I asked brother brand would there
[1:44:36] be any difference between Adam and Eve
[1:44:37] and us today in their bodies and he said
[1:44:41] no sir we was coming home from squirrel
[1:44:43] hunting brother Fred and I and a bunch
[1:44:45] of them I said no they wouldn't be the
[1:44:47] same said you mean Eve wouldn't be a
[1:44:50] woman like her daughters and Adam
[1:44:52] wouldn't be a man like his sons I said
[1:44:55] in many respects but not in all physical
[1:45:00] respects he said what would be the
[1:45:02] difference I said they wouldn't have any
[1:45:07] Naval they were
[1:45:09] created right they wasn't attached to
[1:45:13] nothing and as long as that bears there
[1:45:16] on everything that's born in this world
[1:45:19] it shows it's a renegade to begin with
[1:45:24] so Saints if you can look down at your
[1:45:26] belly today and you got a belly button
[1:45:29] you were born a renegade to begin with
[1:45:33] is that right as far as I know we all
[1:45:35] got one so there ain't no good no bad it
[1:45:39] don't matter brother John if it's an
[1:45:40] inie or an Aude if it's on there you was
[1:45:43] born a
[1:45:44] renegade you're born that
[1:45:49] way and he said
[1:45:56] he said sure there's a difference they
[1:45:57] wouldn't have an own Neal they wasn't
[1:45:59] connected to any female to come here see
[1:46:01] God created them now he says I want to
[1:46:04] say something every man in this prison
[1:46:06] house who's
[1:46:07] holy uh he said who is the one that
[1:46:10] wasn't born by
[1:46:12] sex so anybody that thinks they're holy
[1:46:16] anybody thinks they're righteous anybody
[1:46:17] thinks they're good he said who which
[1:46:20] one of us was born without sex
[1:46:23] and he says doesn't matter what he is
[1:46:25] we're all in the same prison but God
[1:46:27] made himself one of his creations and
[1:46:30] come Beyond sex through the Holy Blood
[1:46:34] that he created himself and through that
[1:46:37] blood he redeemed us I said you believe
[1:46:41] that Papa and he said I believe that I
[1:46:44] said Christ died for bad man like you
[1:46:48] now there's only one way to do there's
[1:46:50] nothing you can do he offers it to knew
[1:46:53] you you can't Merit it nothing you can
[1:46:55] do to get it he just gives it to you
[1:46:58] will you accept what he did for you to
[1:47:00] keep you from hell he said I'll do
[1:47:04] that he said but if I could just he goes
[1:47:07] right back to it again but if I could
[1:47:09] just get rid of these cigarettes he said
[1:47:12] the cigarettes will take care of their
[1:47:16] s he said you just I ain't asking you he
[1:47:19] says I'm not a legalist I believe in
[1:47:22] grace oh we need to read that in some
[1:47:24] message churches today Saints we're not
[1:47:26] legalists we believe in
[1:47:31] grace he says all the father was given
[1:47:33] has given me will come to me I said if
[1:47:36] you believe that with all your heart he
[1:47:37] said with all my heart I believe it then
[1:47:40] will you accept it on those basis that
[1:47:42] you're not worthy of it he's the one
[1:47:44] that's worthy don't look at yourself
[1:47:46] look at
[1:47:47] him cuz you ain't doing nothing for
[1:47:50] yourself look at the one that did
[1:47:52] something for for you that's who we look
[1:47:54] at
[1:47:55] today he said what about him he said oh
[1:47:57] he's worthy I said that's it then except
[1:48:01] what he gives you he said I do and I
[1:48:04] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:07] and him go out of here and light up a
[1:48:10] cigarette man he wouldn't make it
[1:48:12] through a message church today to save
[1:48:14] his
[1:48:15] life he baptized him in the name of the
[1:48:19] Lord Jesus Christ and he went out of
[1:48:22] there and lit up a
[1:48:25] cigarette is that right
[1:48:28] Saints
[1:48:29] now God has a time and season appointed
[1:48:34] for
[1:48:35] everything brother Bram goes on in that
[1:48:38] quote and I'm going to uh paraphrase it
[1:48:40] to save a little time he said a few
[1:48:42] weeks ago he was down at his home place
[1:48:44] and he saw a vision and then that Vision
[1:48:48] he he he saw basically what he saw that
[1:48:50] Papa Cox had fell and he mashed his back
[1:48:54] up and he found out that they went and
[1:48:57] took Papa Cox he was laid in the bed and
[1:48:59] they went and took his cigarettes to him
[1:49:02] and he
[1:49:03] said he said that uh they brought the
[1:49:07] cigarettes to him when he was in the bed
[1:49:09] and the desire had left him weeks
[1:49:14] ago see he got the first part right and
[1:49:17] the rest of it took care of itself amen
[1:49:23] he said put first things first don't try
[1:49:25] to get good you're bad to begin
[1:49:28] with so as long as we can look down and
[1:49:31] we got a
[1:49:33] naval we're going to be fighting this
[1:49:36] flesh we're going to be fighting this
[1:49:38] human
[1:49:40] nature and many times we're going to
[1:49:43] have to wait on the
[1:49:44] Lord and we don't like to wait in this
[1:49:49] flesh this flesh wants everything right
[1:49:53] now we live in a fast food society and
[1:49:57] we want it fast but they can't get it
[1:50:00] out the drive-thru fast
[1:50:02] enough we we we complain about
[1:50:06] everything we we we can't the the church
[1:50:08] is too hot I like it 68 degrees and it's
[1:50:12] 72 degrees and I don't like that I got a
[1:50:15] wait in line too long at the M
[1:50:18] McDonald's
[1:50:19] drive-thru and my internet's too slow
[1:50:26] and just everything's bad the pews
[1:50:28] aren't
[1:50:29] comfortable preacher preached too
[1:50:32] long service went too long what else was
[1:50:35] you going to do
[1:50:36] anyways service is too long so hurry up
[1:50:39] through service so we can get home and
[1:50:41] look at our phone for three
[1:50:43] hours it's a it's a day and age we live
[1:50:46] in Saints we we can't handle nothing
[1:50:49] can't handle no
[1:50:50] inconvenience that's that flesh that
[1:50:53] we're
[1:50:54] battling and that space of time between
[1:50:58] the sewing and the reaping we don't know
[1:51:01] we do know that if we seow we will reap
[1:51:04] good or bad if you cast your bread upon
[1:51:07] the Water it won't return void but we
[1:51:09] don't know when it will return and so
[1:51:12] there's a space there that we're waiting
[1:51:14] on the Lord and that makes us
[1:51:17] uncomfortable it's difficult to do
[1:51:19] that if if we stay with it though the
[1:51:22] Bible said they that wait upon the Lord
[1:51:26] will renew their strength so if we'll
[1:51:29] wait on the Lord we'll get stronger
[1:51:33] while we're
[1:51:34] waiting now that's what the word said
[1:51:37] that waiting does you good nobody wants
[1:51:40] to wait I don't want to
[1:51:45] wait but it does US good doesn't it you
[1:51:49] ever planted a garden I don't know how
[1:51:51] you would here
[1:51:54] I'm just talking about when I was back
[1:51:55] East when we had what they called
[1:51:59] dirt and I would plant a garden you know
[1:52:02] when you plant that Garden every
[1:52:04] afternoon you go back out there and
[1:52:06] check it brother John you go look see if
[1:52:09] it's grown any see if the tomatoes is
[1:52:12] blooming yet y'all got Tomatoes here all
[1:52:16] right they probably don't bloom in this
[1:52:17] heat but you go check it to see if it's
[1:52:21] blooming yet to see see if the fruit's
[1:52:23] ready yet to see if the vegetables are
[1:52:25] ready every day you go check it you tend
[1:52:27] to it and and you and you watch it but
[1:52:31] you can't just keep digging the seed up
[1:52:33] over and over again it'll never grow you
[1:52:35] got to plant it and leave it sometimes
[1:52:37] you got to forget about
[1:52:41] it but since you cannot Harvest a fruit
[1:52:45] or a vegetable from that Garden until
[1:52:48] it's
[1:52:49] time it's got to be time
[1:52:53] if you try to harvest in the spring you
[1:52:55] won't have a harvest if the spring rains
[1:52:58] come in the fall it ruin the crop
[1:53:01] everything has a
[1:53:03] time everything has a
[1:53:06] season and we can't Harvest until it's
[1:53:10] ready but we can be
[1:53:13] prepared for the Harvest remember Sarah
[1:53:17] and Abraham
[1:53:19] prepared now everybody thought they was
[1:53:21] crazy
[1:53:23] everybody thought they lost their mind
[1:53:24] but said they went to get the bird eyye
[1:53:26] I didn't even know what that was I had
[1:53:27] to look it up they got the bird eyye
[1:53:30] ready they got the booties ready they
[1:53:32] got everything ready today we would we
[1:53:35] would get the nursery ready we'd paint
[1:53:36] the room the right color and get all the
[1:53:38] stuff ready they got ready they were
[1:53:40] expecting the Harvest they were ready
[1:53:44] when the time
[1:53:46] came they were preparing the whole time
[1:53:49] whether it had come or not they were
[1:53:50] getting ready like it was coming it's
[1:53:52] like if you pray for rain you better
[1:53:54] bring an
[1:53:57] umbrella if you're going to ask God for
[1:53:59] something believe he's going to give it
[1:54:01] to
[1:54:04] you now we don't know the time but we
[1:54:07] got to
[1:54:08] believe we got to have faith that he's
[1:54:11] got Abraham waited 25 years and the
[1:54:14] Bible said he staggered not at the
[1:54:15] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:54:17] strong giving praise to God those little
[1:54:20] women that got prayed for in the pray
[1:54:22] waited two months but they didn't
[1:54:24] stagger they were told they were being a
[1:54:26] reproach they were told they were lost
[1:54:28] their mind
[1:54:30] probably that little blind brother the
[1:54:32] guy little catholic guy that guy prayed
[1:54:33] for he's
[1:54:35] blind and he went out and he he was
[1:54:38] still blind he come back brother BR I
[1:54:39] thought you said to God heal me he said
[1:54:41] I thought you said you believe
[1:54:43] me it didn't say when he healed
[1:54:47] you he said you just go testify he said
[1:54:50] he was on the street corner handing out
[1:54:52] newspapers saying extra extra praise the
[1:54:55] Lord for healing
[1:54:56] me extra extra praise the Lord for
[1:54:59] healing me he was testifying to what the
[1:55:02] word said not what his circumstances
[1:55:04] said not what his physical ability
[1:55:07] said not what his body was saying what
[1:55:10] the word
[1:55:11] said they put him in the barber chair
[1:55:14] making fun of him hey did John did did
[1:55:16] did did did the Lord Heal you yes the
[1:55:19] Lord healed me praise the Lord for
[1:55:20] healing me and his eyes
[1:55:22] came
[1:55:25] open he was preparing for the
[1:55:35] Harvest it was his
[1:55:37] season it was his
[1:55:40] time it was time for
[1:55:43] him well you say well I I'm in one of
[1:55:47] those bad Seasons right now I I'm
[1:55:49] struggling here I'm struggling there
[1:55:52] I'm having a tough time in my family I'm
[1:55:55] having a tough time in my home or I'm
[1:55:57] having a tough time at work or I'm
[1:55:59] having a tough time with my life right
[1:56:00] now I can't get it all
[1:56:03] together I'm in one of those
[1:56:05] seasons and then you say well I hadn't
[1:56:08] been I hadn't been like Abraham I hadn't
[1:56:10] been strong like that I hadn't been like
[1:56:12] those sisters I hadn't held strong to my
[1:56:15] faith I i' I've I've I've I hadn't been
[1:56:18] as graceful as I wanted to be I hadn't
[1:56:20] been I've been complaining too much come
[1:56:22] on somebody
[1:56:24] today well I want you to notice
[1:56:27] Moses hadn't done a super job
[1:56:32] either Moses knew he was supposed to be
[1:56:35] delivered but he got ahead of God and
[1:56:37] tried to do it himself and he slew the
[1:56:38] Egyptian he ran to the back side of the
[1:56:42] desert and and brother Brown said that
[1:56:44] when when he got back there believer's
[1:56:45] position in Christ paragraph 7 he said
[1:56:48] when he got On The Backs side of the
[1:56:49] desert he said Moses got back there he
[1:56:51] said then Moses lost all the hopes and
[1:56:55] all the power that he
[1:56:58] had the man that was sent here to
[1:57:01] deliver the children of Israel the man
[1:57:04] that was called to God to do it the man
[1:57:06] that knew he was called to God to do it
[1:57:09] he failed he had some
[1:57:12] troubles he messed up and he got back on
[1:57:15] the back side of the desert and he lost
[1:57:17] all the hopes that he had he lost all
[1:57:20] the power that he had thinking of the
[1:57:22] freedom thinking that the freedom wasn't
[1:57:25] for the children of Israel Moses the
[1:57:27] deliverer got to thinking that the
[1:57:29] freedom wasn't for the children of
[1:57:32] Israel he lost all thoughts of Freedom
[1:57:36] till God met him one day in a burning
[1:57:38] bush and then when God season came along
[1:57:41] just exactly then he revealed his plans
[1:57:44] to Moses now the reason that Moses had
[1:57:47] forgot about Freedom God's promise that
[1:57:49] he would free them but God hadn't forgot
[1:57:51] his promise
[1:57:54] so you might forget that you're being
[1:58:00] healed but God hadn't forgot about
[1:58:05] it the reason Moses forgot about it he
[1:58:07] had forgot about the promise Moses tried
[1:58:09] in himself and failed and that's what
[1:58:11] the church has done many times we've
[1:58:13] tried in ourself to do things when we
[1:58:16] fail to find God's element of time you
[1:58:19] say I hadn't been as gracious as I
[1:58:20] should have been while I'm waiting on
[1:58:22] the Lord I've been Moody I've complained
[1:58:24] a lot I've complained a lot about my
[1:58:27] situation I've complained about how bad
[1:58:29] I got it come on somebody and I I felt
[1:58:31] sorry for myself come on somebody felt
[1:58:33] sorry for yourself today I I think we've
[1:58:36] all been guilty of it you might even
[1:58:38] been angry with the Lord because he
[1:58:40] hadn't come when you thought he should
[1:58:42] come brother man said Moses even lost
[1:58:45] his feeling for the people in
[1:58:47] bondage he lost all hopes and he lost
[1:58:50] all the power he had and he'd forgotten
[1:58:52] about those people that was down in
[1:58:54] Egypt in bondage he' forgot all about it
[1:58:56] and sometimes Saints when you're in the
[1:58:58] middle of the battle you forget that
[1:59:00] other people are fighting the same devil
[1:59:03] too we forget when we're talking we're
[1:59:05] looking around everybody else but we
[1:59:07] forget that everybody else is fighting
[1:59:10] the same enemy we're
[1:59:12] fighting everybody's struggling in some
[1:59:15] kind of
[1:59:16] way when you're in the middle of
[1:59:17] something sometimes you can't seem like
[1:59:19] you can't see the end of the road you
[1:59:21] can't see that God's delivering you know
[1:59:24] I remember back you know when I first
[1:59:26] got married and and and and me and
[1:59:28] sister Brandon get into a spat or
[1:59:29] something I know the rest of y'all ain't
[1:59:31] never did that I'm just talking about me
[1:59:33] remember I was an idiot so so you find
[1:59:35] get into a spad and oh it just seemed
[1:59:37] like everything's bad everything's wrong
[1:59:40] the marriage is terrible everything's
[1:59:42] over we ain't never going to make it out
[1:59:44] of this and then 30 minutes later we
[1:59:46] make up and everything's great and never
[1:59:48] remember it no
[1:59:49] more see when you're in the middle of
[1:59:51] the battle everything seems worse you
[1:59:54] don't see how God can do it you oh I'm
[1:59:56] so sick in my body I don't see how I can
[1:59:58] get no better God can heal you and you
[2:00:00] don't even know he healed
[2:00:03] you people say it all the time Sister
[2:00:06] Barbara I got up and I didn't even know
[2:00:08] I just wasn't hurting anymore and I
[2:00:10] finally realized after a day or so hey
[2:00:13] my elbow's not hurting or my knee's not
[2:00:16] hurting or my chest ain't hurting no
[2:00:17] more or my back ain't hurting no more
[2:00:20] God does it so simple we we don't even
[2:00:22] recognize it
[2:00:31] sometimes brother said in believer's
[2:00:33] position in Christ paragraph nine he
[2:00:34] said God revealed himself to him in a
[2:00:36] burning bush and he found out that the
[2:00:39] very thing that was in The Burning Bush
[2:00:40] was the thing he lacked and the thing
[2:00:43] that's a whole lot with us today that
[2:00:45] many times we try to do the program our
[2:00:48] we failed to get what's in the burning
[2:00:50] bush the direct revelation of the will
[2:00:52] and time of God what God would what good
[2:00:56] would it do you to plant some corn out
[2:00:59] here today it would rot because this was
[2:01:01] preached in January he said uh nothing
[2:01:05] happened he said if no if it happened to
[2:01:06] sprout in the cold weather would kill
[2:01:08] the germ it wouldn't work he said we got
[2:01:11] to have a season for it so then when
[2:01:14] Moses found out now the real direct will
[2:01:16] of God and the real time of God and the
[2:01:19] revelation of everything to do now try
[2:01:21] to keep him out of
[2:01:23] Egypt he said now when when Moses found
[2:01:26] the real thing the real Revelation when
[2:01:29] he found the real plan of God he said
[2:01:31] then you couldn't keep him out of Egypt
[2:01:34] is that right he had a revelation then
[2:01:37] he knew that it was God's time then he
[2:01:39] knew that it was the season for it then
[2:01:41] he had that Revelation in his heart he
[2:01:43] couldn't keep him out of there he said
[2:01:46] right down into Egypt he went just as
[2:01:48] hard as he could go and so Moses knew
[2:01:52] what the word said about it and the Lord
[2:01:53] revealed to him that it was time and in
[2:01:55] the and in the man who once had given up
[2:01:58] on his people the man who had once lost
[2:02:01] all his power the man had lost the
[2:02:03] feeling for his people the man that had
[2:02:05] lost hope that man that had once done
[2:02:07] that all of a sudden the man was set on
[2:02:10] fire by the revelation of
[2:02:12] God and Saints that's what we need today
[2:02:16] is God to that's all it's going to take
[2:02:19] you might be struggling and you might be
[2:02:20] tested all going to take is a revelation
[2:02:23] for you all it's going to take is God to
[2:02:26] set fire to
[2:02:27] you and then you'll forget all about the
[2:02:30] trouble you forget all about your
[2:02:31] failures all you need is a revelation
[2:02:34] today all you need is God to show you
[2:02:36] it's time it's your time it's your
[2:02:39] season it's
[2:02:43] time when's he going to do it when he's
[2:02:49] ready so you might be discouraged
[2:02:53] or might have been
[2:02:54] discouraged but your season's coming
