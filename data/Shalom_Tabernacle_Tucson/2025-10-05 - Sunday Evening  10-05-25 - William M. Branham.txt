[Music] [Music] Heavenly Father, we are fortunate enough again to be in your presence, gathered together to take part in communion and footwashing as you instructed us to do. We are fortunate to be in the presence of your Holy Spirit here to help us, lead us and guide us in our way when we leave here today and all through the week until we can be back and be with you again. Please be with all of our brethren who are away traveling, who may be sick, who may be in some trouble, worry, and travail. We all have those times. But when we do, we have you to reach out to and grab hold of. For we know that you are always with us, standing beside us, with your hand on our shoulder, going through the troubles with us and giving us strength to walk through the storm. Thank you, Lord.

Cast your burdon on him and I cast your burden unto Jesus for he cares for you. Oh cast your burden under Jesus for he cares for you. How many want to do that tonight? Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. I I always think of my brother Jeffrey when we sang that song. So we had a we we had a convention years ago and this was before Jeffrey needed a walker to to get around with and he always loved that song. And so I saw Jeffrey come down from Phoenix. He was living with Jill and Robert at that time. And I said, you know, every time I I sing this song, even then, I think of Jeffrey. And he got up from the congregation, came up on the platform, and he wanted to do the the hand motions and everything. So, you see me smiling when I'm singing that song. It's just thinking of, won't it be wonderful? We get on that other side. We'll all have new body. He won't have to be walking around with his walker anymore. Won't have to be on the insulin for his diabetes. and and but he just cast his burden unto the Lord. And amen, that's one thing about Jeffrey is he uh he gives a 100% of the talents he's been given back to the Lord and worships him, loves him, and has been an example for me my whole life. So, burn, burn, Holy Spirit, burn in me. Oh, just set my soul on fire. Oh, just fill me with the Holy Ghost and God's holy desire. Oh, just make me like the Christ of all, healing and raising the dead. Lord, just give me the power that Jesus has through the blood that was shed. Yes. Burn. Holy Spirit burn in me.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that tonight? He's surely been good to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just slow it down a little bit. Appreciate the brother Tim, Brother Angel this morning on the drums. They've done such a good job and just sing a few of those uptempo ones.

Sister Sarah and Joe, the baby coming up, help with the baby and everything going well for them. the king's sister uh Barbara's brother Bobby were the meetings in November and Joe Yarboro. Let's all bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just come to give you honor and glory and praise your name, Father, for there's none greater than you, Lord Jesus. We we're thankful for the things that we heard today, Lord. Lord, we pray that you'd bring us back to that place.

Peace of God cover me through the stor. Bless you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise for his goodness and his mercy to us. Amen. Tonight we're going to listen to a portion of questions and answers 1964 and uh just to I don't think brother Brandham reads a scripture in starting that message but we'll read one in Hebrews chapter number 12. Welcome each of you to the house of the Lord. Just before we go to the table of the Lord, we wanted to hear this portion of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 verses number one and two. Certainly enjoyed the Lord this morning our service. always thank God for his goodness unto us &gt;&gt; and appreciate the songs singing the samuranos a portion of the samuranos. I thought all of them were going to be up there but that was take what we can get. Huh? So that was very nice. Appreciate that. Amen. Hebrews chapter 12. Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great cloud of witness, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Amen. And so there was um this just came to my mind to go into the questions and answers and I thought I'd start with the last one and there was the evening service but then I just took the one from the morning um from question number 325. I think that's the first question he starts, brother Random starts with and is directly with part of the millennium that he was talking about from the Sunday school this morning through question 332. 3:32. So let us sing onlyly believe as we hear the word of the Lord. only believe [Music] that all things are possible. Only believe. All [Music] things are possible. Only &gt;&gt; Can you make that confession? Let's lift our hands and say, "Lord, I believe I believe that all these are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Unless you can be seated, brother Brown. Do all who go in the bride have to live within the 1500 miles of the tabernacle? I believe I had that again last Sunday. I just have to pick them up and use them as I can. 1500 miles of the tabernacle as it sounds like on tape number two of the future home of the bride. I always thought that the bride would come out of all parts of the world at the time of the rapture. Am I wrong? No, my dear friend, you are not wrong. You're right. Now, if I said anything under uh the tape that would lead you to believe. Now, I haven't these are all new to me. Now, I've never looked in these series. See, these are new bunchs that I got the other Sunday. I didn't put him back in this envelope and laid him back in there. Now, in this, no, the bride doesn't have to be in any certain place. Many of them will be in the dust of the earth. They'll be around the earth. They'll be frozen in the the snow in the north and and dust of the uh tropical jungles and and all around the world. But when the trumpet of God shall sound, the dead in Christ shall arise, waken, and come out of the dust of the earth. no matter where they are. And now in this the resurrection will be a universal see every wherever creature on the ball of the earth it's in Christ will come forth with him when he comes. See, no matter where you are, just think of the arena and the days of the early martyrs that when those Christians were thrown into lion's den and those lines kill the Christians and eat up their bodies. See, yet they were scattered. Their bodies was in the wastage of the line across the face of the earth. No matter where it is, you can't see. You're made up of a substance that's unseen made material and God will will give that uh that substance back. See, now like you take a a cell, you break it down from a cell and it comes in there into a a cell in a cell and into an atom and a molecule and on down like that and finally it ends up into the unseen. It goes from a natural sampling. You put your hands onto gases, from gases into acids, acids into gases and gases on back like that to it finally all winds up to one little thing and that is spirit. And this spirit who has occupied these gases, it might not be the same gases, but the features of what you are will be exactly what they are. Again, see the spirit has controlled that. And now, in other words, when you become a young man or young woman and like God takes a picture of you. Now, no matter how old and wrinkled, how disfigured, whatever it will be, that line right on down to that body may be destroyed, disfigured, burnt, eat up the lines, whatever it is, but it was made up of gases, 16 elements of the earth. that was uh calcium and potachsh and petroleum and cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body. Now no matter that's the whole earth is filled with that but now this picture is the main thing. Then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things comes right back into the place and develops this picture again. Now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best. When was it taken? Before there was a foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was put in God's great vow and then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice. See then you become a servant of God. Him for knowing it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it. Then that picture is absolutely this is the negative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The negative part of life is where you are living now. And anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive &gt;&gt; before there can be a negative. Therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere. And this ain't the real thing. This is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come. &gt;&gt; Now you got it. &gt;&gt; So I don't care what they would do. They cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's great gallery up there. It cannot destroy this in heaven. You could burn it up, feed it to the lions, uh do it any way you want to. It'll come forth again just as sure as the two twos is for. Just as sure as God spoke it, it'll come forth. So no matter where you are now, if I I think if you'll play the tape, I don't know who wrote it. No name signs, just a little piece of paper with u blue ink wrote out of a little notebook. look like it's been tore off from a a little notebook. But remember on this in in this question now in the tape if you'll notice I said this something on this might not be word by word. Now if you check this tape with the other one I said for instance we are here this morning this city that we long to see will be some 1500 mile square. I said that would reach from Maine to Florida and from the eastern seabboard to 800 miles west of the Mississippi River 1500 miles square. I said think of it right here this morning. There's people sitting right here that has actually come from that much distance from 1500 miles square setting in here. Now, I don't know where the temple will set on the earth, but I have an idea that the temple will set right about where Palestine is now. That will probably be the top of the mountain right there. It'll reach out. Of course, there'll be no more sea then. See, this world's 25,000 miles around it. So, 1500 miles, not very much out of that. But this great city will set on this 1500 square mile mountain. Now the reason I believe that is because of the prophecies and things concerning Mount Zion in Jerusalem and those cities. And there's where Abraham the prophet was seeking for that city that was whose builder and maker was God. He looked for that city in that land. I believe it'll be where that land is. That land, you can hardly find it on the map. It's a little bitty dot. And look at the land that Russia and United States, South America, and all those places there. Why was God so zealous of that place? See, of that one place. That's the question. I can't prove it, but it just looks that way to me. But wherever it is, we're headed that way. &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord for that. Now, if you got the impression that I that I said it would be in uh around 1500 miles of the tabernacle, that was the wrong impression. You see, cuz it won't this tabernacle has this is just a little place that's going to be destroyed and and the world will be burn up and this will all be done away with and this Indiana and United States and everything will just melt and just wax out enter lava. See, all sin, all disease, all germs, all everything else will be destroyed. And I saw a new heavens and a new earth &gt;&gt; for the first time. Thank God with 6,000 years in building this world, putting it together, formed it. How did he do it? The Bible said he made it out of things which does not appear. That is, he created the earth. Now notice this is beautiful. The very creator that created the earth for a purpose. Satan defiled it. He come down to redeem what was left on here. and he has gone somewhere else and is in his business yet creating now. It taken him 6,000 years to make the the earth and he's going to take two days to create the city that goes on the earth. He's in my father's house are many mansions. &gt;&gt; If it was I saw, I would have told you. I'll go to prepare a place for you. Build a city out of transparent gold, the streets out of gold. What a beautiful place. Where will he get it? Is he any materials on the other earth or the moons and stars and things? He don't have to have it. &gt;&gt; He's a creator. &gt;&gt; He's gone to build the city. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good enough for me. Ain't you? That's good. For if he built this one and I enjoy this one, what's it going to be when he builds this new one? &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a wonderful thing. And so I'm glad that we're bound for that city. All right, Brother Brandham, I love the Lord, but for the past year, I have uh been I have been faced with a problem. Seems sometimes I've almost been out of my mind. What is it? Please pray for me uh and my husband. Well, if there is no if this person was on private interview like you people have been in there this morning, it would pull that out what it is. Whatever it is. See, the Lord would reveal what it is. But now that I don't know who you are and you're not sitting here, it just said a sister in Christ. Now, now if it is, if it's something that you have done that's wrong, it's bothered you, then check it with the Bible and see what you must do. But if you haven't done anything and you're not condemned of anything, it's perhaps your nerves. See, it could be many things that happened. Maybe some trouble back in your life. Maybe it's if a woman here might be in the menopause time. That's when everything is wrong with her. And there's nothing wrong with her yet. Everything's wrong with her. And she's not just putting on. She really feels that. It's just as real. Any person that's nervous is that way. Don't never disagree. You husbands to your wives when they're in that time of life. If you ever if she ever was your sweetheart, you let her be right then cuz she needs you. She really needs your help. She needs somebody to help her and understand her. Talk to her. Take her up in your arms like be like like like she was your sweetheart and she should be and and understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup is changing and you must be good to her at that time. I think that's why Mr. uh Rockefeller made a fatal mistake. He was loved by the nation, would probably been our next president. But when his wife took menopause and went in menopause and he left her and married his secretary, you see what happened? That shows you some real good thinking Americans yet. Now, I like Mr. Goldwater, I think, or Mr. Rockefeller. Uh he's a I like Mr. Goldwater, too. I like everybody, but I I didn't want to. Some of you, some of my brother Republicans sitting out there hear me say that. Notice, but uh I'm not a politician. I I want to be a Christian. See, and this is not a place for politics. And the whole thing's gone anyhow that way. But this that we're talking about is eternal. Democrat or Republican. Oh, it's such a mess. It can never be redeemed. It's over. So don't argue about that. The thing to do is live for this kingdom. For here we have no continuing city, &gt;&gt; but we seek one to come. Amen. That's right. Yes, sir. So, politics is one side of the fence. I'm on the other. I said, I I voted once. That's for Christ. I'm sure to win. That's right. See, you got a vote coming. See, God voted for you. The devil voted against you. Now, which way you cast your votes where you're coming out. So now I believe this person is just I'm going to think that it's just nervous. If there's nothing condemning you, go right on and just say get away from me, Satan. Just move right on. Take the initiative and live for God. Now is there ever any condition wherein it's u permissible to remarry after a divorce according to I see if this is a I think there's two or three questions on this. according to the scriptures. Um um if I do not uh if I do not remain married in pre from previous times it is there any group grounds for divorce that permits you even to remarry? I will be uh I will be the uh buying the tape. Yeah. To get this uh answered. Uh thank you very much. I'll look for it Sunday. Well, now I have said this, you see, don't don't uh let me just leave that alone, you see, until we get to a place where now where we'll this will all be straightened out and uh you just remember that's God willing, as soon as I come back again, next time I come, the Lord willing, I'll preach on that subject. See, and now and then we'll tape it anyhow. If it hurts, it hurts. If it clears up, it clears up. But you just be of a good courage. Dear brother Brandon, is it possible for one to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not to have the signs following at at least not until some future time and conditions appointed by the spirit? Now, that might sound like a mixed up question, but that's a good one. &gt;&gt; Very good. See now here gives me a little chance that I find that's working with my my family here now. See, I mean you, my family, and the family out in the world where we where our tapes go. Now, a great part of my congregation is made up of Pentecostal people. And uh because uh our Pentecost is the latest message that we have uh in the denominational ranks. And to me, I certainly agree with them more than any other denominational church. I hang towards the Pentecostal because it is a the later message. And all my converts that I bring to Christ, I try to direct them to some Pentecostal church, but I have condemned them in every way that I know how that they were wrong in the scripture by being a denomination and not willing to walk in light when light's presented to them. But yet, if I had to take my choice today to take any church in the world, I'd take Pentecostal when it come to denomination. But when it comes to individuals as men and women, there's genuine Christians and all them denominations, Methodists, Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, and so forth. But I'm talking about the systems that these people are in. Not never the individual, but the system that these people has been caught into in their denomination. They clearly understand that now. See that? I think the people if they're Roman Catholic, Jehovah Witness, Orthodox, Jew, whatever they are, that doesn't matter to me. But they are individuals to which Christ died to save and I I in agreeing with their systems that they're in. I believe it's just as many Christians out there in the Baptist as there is in the Methodists or the Presbyterians or whatever more. They're Christians, real believers. And right out in Roman Catholic Church, there's genuine people in there that's real men and women that love the Lord. And they don't join that church to be wrong. They join that to be right. But it's a system in there that directs their mind the wrong way. And if ever comes to a time that I make a denomination, I have deceived you and have brought you into a system. Farbid from me and may God keep me in my right mind to direct you to Jesus Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; Stay with that. But now this person here is asking the question about the possibility of having the baptism of the Holy Ghost without signs following them. Now it would um if you are born again, you are if you are born first as a human being and a normal human being. Now, I'm answering this in a in a a real juvenile way of doing it, but if you're born a normal human being, you will actually do the things that a normal human being would do. Is that right? When you're born as a human, the natural traits of a human being will follow you. You won't live in a tree and try to fly with your wings like a bird or or something like that. That isn't that wouldn't be a normal human being. The normal actions of a human being, the normal action of a human being would be to work, have marry, have family, and do these things. That's natural normal human beings because you're born that. Then when you're born a Christian, born of the spirit of God, you naturally take up the attributes of Christ. You see, now if we took here this morning and this congregation where you people sat here and listened day after day and so forth to the teaching, you'll find out you'd be different one from another because you you're different. Your your makeup different, your your appetites are different. You you eat different, but you all eat food. But now just from one individual being just like the other, you're different one from another. Christians do the same thing. You can't uh say now all do all speak with tongues do all prophesy to all. See you have to watch these things because a Christian takes up the the habits of a Christian and they live like a Christian. Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe. Notice in my name they shall cast out devils. They shall take up serpents or drink deadly things and they'll speak with new tongues and and them things just actually follow Christians. Now the person has a very good thing here. Or do we wait until the future time? Are the conditions appointed by the Holy Spirit? I like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See now you get the idea. When it's appointed by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God appoints things. And there I think if the Pentecostal people would try it at listens to this tape, you'll understand me if you get here why I different with you pressing that idea that they must all speak with tongues. &gt;&gt; Uh I I cannot see that right because to be I like cherry pie but there's no need and I'm a human being but there's no need of me trying to tell if you don't eat cherry pie you're not a human being. You see, but eating cherry pie is just one of the habits of a human being. See, you might disagree with me upon that, but but it's true. Now, one will eat this and one will do something else. Now, the Holy Spirit appoints these offices. But when you try to force yourself into it, if I said you had to eat cherry pie, what if cherry pie made you vomit? And yet you'd vomit and try to eat cherry pie. vomiting. See, you're you're you're hurting yourself. And that's the way you try to do when you try to force yourself to do something that's contrary to the spirit. &gt;&gt; He's got your life laotted for a certain thing. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and you when you're filled with the spirit, here's one of the best signs I know. You're so in love with Christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the evidence that you have the Holy Spirit and your life's full of joy and oh my everything's different than what it used to be. That's the Holy Spirit. Now these gifts are in the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if this congregation this morning, this uh just a nice snug church full with the overflow rooms of course is filled up. But in just not announcing we was going to answer these questions, but these people had just come in. Notice if every person in here was in perfectly harmony with the Holy Spirit, every one of you was filled with the Holy Ghost and in harmony with the Holy Ghost, these signs would just be multiplying among you all the time. &gt;&gt; See, it just be constantly going. But where there's confusion, &gt;&gt; where there's difference and where we set up, the Holy Spirit can't move itself. You see, it can't operate through the people. Amen. See, and there if I said now you uh each one of you, did you speak a tongues? Yeah. Well, you got it. Did you speak of them? No, you haven't got it. Now I'm making myself a judge. &gt;&gt; God is a judge of these things. But what if Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the groups that believe the whole nature of the Holy Spirit flows through them and all are full of love and joy and and just a great bundle of of of real godly fil people. See, that's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in there, they speak with tongues. On the occasion that tongues arise while necessary for that, they speak with tongues. And if there's a prophecy, it speaks and oh, it's just exactly perfect every time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ask those 15 or 20 people that went in their own interview this morning if it was one word anyway minced in anyway and perfect strangers what the Holy Spirit dig right down in there and get them things and bring them right out and tell it to them. See, see, there's not no mistakes in it. Tell them this exactly what this what this was and what that is and what this is to be done and things like that and what they've done and what they should do. See, that's just set it right in order. Now, they've got to act on that. The other night I was talking to a couple and uh I was at a a home where we was having a meeting or just a little sitting around a table talking and all at once the Holy Spirit dropped among us and I said to someone there I seen a certain man and he was confused in his mind about some things and I said like in the confusion and the and the the discernment I said now it's right here now. I said, "I know what you're thinking." And I went right back and just talked a roundabout way and answered every question that man had in his mind to him. And he nobody know what I was talking about but him. See, but he got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He know what it's all about. You see, and that was what to him showing him, confirming to him that the Holy Spirit was revealing to me what was on his mind. You see, and I didn't have to tell it to the rest of them. The man's listening at me right now. That's right. Now, you see how that is? That's a confirmation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if the whole church would work in harmony like that, then among us, we'd be casting out devils, taking up serpents, drinking deadly things, all kinds of things going on. But when you're trying to force that to individuals, &gt;&gt; then you get yourself that's Pentecostal again. Then you get babbling, confusion. &gt;&gt; You can't judge that. See, our hearts are full of joy and happiness and oh by the birds are singing, uh, everything's wonderful. my just full of the spirit of God and we're so in love with Jesus. We I want to pray all night. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now, I wouldn't embarrass this crowd or even myself to you. But I wonder if I could ask this morning, which one in this crowd of this people that had the Holy Ghost, it'd probably be 95% of you raise your hands that you had the Holy Ghost. Then I'll turn around and give you a Bible evidence. just one of Bible evidence and I doubt where there be one or two hands go up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; see, just could just tie it in such a place. But when you do that, see, you're also hurting your congregation. But you got to get them out of that babyhood and get them into manhood. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; like someone wrote the question the other day up here said about said something about brother Junior Jackson. Somebody went down there and they said, "You're going down to the dead beans or something really like that." Brother Jackson, because Brother Jackson's congregation, they let them speak with tongues just in the church wherever they feel the spirit, they want to speak in tongues, they go ahead and do it. Well, that's brother Jackson's church. That's perfectly all right. I've got nothing against that. Not a thing. Junior Jackson's one of my best friends and a real godly man filled with the spirit of God. And we're brothers. Now, he don't have to eat my cherry pie. I can or I don't have to eat his apple pie. See, but we're both eating pie. We both believe this message. Exactly. That's the order of the church. I said, I want my church to try to come together. I said, when we begin to break out, hear the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues and so forth. I said, somebody asked me and said, now, Brother Bram, is all that genuine? I said, I'm no judge. I said, tell you what, let's bring it to a spot. Let it go a while and bring it to the spot until the word is presented on it. Then watch it. If it's the Holy Spirit, it copes right with the word. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't, it won't. &gt;&gt; That's just the only way you can tell it. Then it it judges itself. You see? Well, it'll fly up. If it isn't the Holy Spirit, it'll fly loose. See? But if it is the Holy Spirit, it'll just meekly follow right in line because that's what it is. It's the Holy Spirit going right to its own order. Now, in this speaking in tongues and so forth, I wish every one of you spoke in tonesues. I sure do. And many times good Christians you see if I tell you that was on the program I found someone not program excuse me on the interviews this morning person I guess they're still here in the building that they about speaking with tongues the person is a genuine person a real person and they've lived right and they've heard me say that evidence the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't but I advise that person to ask God to let them either speak in tones are prophesying because it's the nature. The first thing I went to that person and found their birth place and what sign that they were born under and could tell what their birth was, which way it set in their natural nature sets them in a certain line. Then when they're reborn again, they're over here in another nature. And then when you find into this nature, that's the inside in conscience. Inside conscience, the outside conscience moves you in one way. That's your natural birth. Then they'll make up something that puts them what? Under a four and puts them in a split condition. They don't know what to do. They'll say, "The Lord wants me to do this. The inside, oh, I just know it's it's it lines up with the scripture." And they'll start to do it. And the first thing you know, Satan on this outside will show them all kinds of defects in it. Then they say, "Well, I guess see see they listen to Satan." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you got to take that inside something &gt;&gt; that what's on the inside of you is scriptural. &gt;&gt; And don't let Satan stand anywhere. It's that's his duty to stand there and pound at you like that. Don't you listen to him. But that person, I told him, I said, "Well, if I could just be sure of having the Holy Ghost, see, a dandy person, real loyal person with the Holy Ghost, but it would be good for her to say, "Father, uh, just give me this for something to stand up." Now, if I taught it like that, people would reach out and get a hold of that without having what that person's got. &gt;&gt; See, the Holy Ghost does speak with tongues. But you've got to have the Holy Ghost first before it can speak with tongues. &gt;&gt; Now, you get it. &gt;&gt; So, if you reach out and get a hold of a gift of speaking in tongues without, now remember that can be a genuine gift that could be the Holy Ghost speaking in you with unknown tongues and you'd be lost and go to hell. The Bible said so. You believe that? Would you like to have scripture on it? &gt;&gt; You want scripture? Raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Though I speak with tongues as men and angels. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Both the one that can be interpreted and that cannot be interpreted. Genuine Holy Ghost tongues. &gt;&gt; I am nothing. See, unless that other goes with it. &gt;&gt; You can have this. See, so don't reach after that without this. Get this first and then that'll actually follow it. Now the rain falls on the just and the unjust. The sun shines on the wicked and the good. The rain falls to right the crop. It rightens the weed also. The same rain the Holy Spirit can fall on a group of people and speak in tongues and make it exactly true. Spawn amongst the people and make it uh prophesy and be exactly true. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Sometimes you can go to a witch or a medium and they can tell you something that's exactly right. Look at the witch of Endor to Saul. It can be exactly true. That's still, isn't it? &gt;&gt; They're witches. &gt;&gt; Speaking in tongues. I've seen devils speak in tongues and right in unknown tongues. That don't mean anything. &gt;&gt; But the real thing is that word again, &gt;&gt; back to that word. &gt;&gt; So, you can do these things without the word, but when you get the word and it does it, then watch it just exactly come to pass. Exactly the right thing. See, man, you're exactly in. Yes, the Holy Spirit uses these people as it's appointed by his own divine wisdom. But the first thing now what? Let me just give you a little twister here in just a minute. I'd say how many has the Holy Ghost? All of you raise up your hand. I'd say all right, I'll see if you have. The Bible said that they that had the Holy Ghost sighed and cried day and night &gt;&gt; for the abominations done in the city. Now, how many hands will go up? &gt;&gt; How many of you can't rest at night? So full of joy, the power of God, &gt;&gt; and so sad for the people it's lost that day and night you weep and cry for the abominations you want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who would be that in the city? How many is that in the church? That's what the Bible said the Holy Spirit evidence was. &gt;&gt; He told the sealing angel, Ezekiel, that's right. He said, "Take, go through the city and set a mark upon those who sign cry for the abominations did in the city. The rest of them let the destroying angel destroy them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter how much members they was and how many things they done said, put a and a man with the inkorn rider dressed in white, which will represent the Holy Spirit, came forth and put a mark upon all them that sigh and cried for the abominations done in the city. &gt;&gt; Now you see, and watch what he said in there also. Slay utterly little children, old women, babies, kill them all. little children. Yes. When Joshua entered the land of Canaan, he said, "Don't you let one of them live." &gt;&gt; If it's a cute little baby, a little Amalachite or Amorite, kill it. &gt;&gt; You remember, he'll grow up to be an Amalachite. &gt;&gt; He'll pollute the camp. And when those little things come back like disagreeing with the word of God, get rid of that thing. I don't care what denomination belongs to. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, they're good." I don't care how good a people they are. If they're contrary to that word, get the thing out of you. &gt;&gt; It's a growing little Amalachite. It looks cute. Looks innocent. It looks like it's all right, but don't you have anything to do with it? You stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandon, I I go down here because well, I don't you just remember any Amalachite, anything that denies the word, stay away from it, &gt;&gt; have nothing to do with it at all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that's the truth? &gt;&gt; Sure is. See, stay away from it. &gt;&gt; The sigh cry for the abominations that's did in the city. Where do you see that? I can show you 10,000 speaking in tongues to one that's really burdened for sin that can't even pray an hour. But did you know the Bible said that Mark only those who sigh and cried for the abominations in the city? How many ever read it? &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the Holy Spirit come forth to mark the people and said to the destroying angel, "Go forth and destroy everything that doesn't have that mark upon them." And the mark of God is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a seal of God. Now, where is them people that's that interested? I can carry people that jump up and down and cry in the church. I can show you people shout and run over the building. I can show you people that prophesy and it comes to pass. I show you those who speak in tongues and run up and down the buildings and say things that actually interpret comes to pass. But where is that person that size and cries for the abominations did in the city? Where's that burden soul? &gt;&gt; You can turn some new leaves on there. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? Now, I've tried my best to to to tell you people and lead you like a daddy would lead his children. You are my children. I have begotten you to Christ through this gospel that I preach. See, and I I I want you to raise up fully matured kids or or children. I want to present you to Christ that day as Paul said, a chase virgin. &gt;&gt; You think that word, but what your heart will punctuate amen to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sin don't of course you'll do things wrong. But when the very first thing condemns you, Father, forgive me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this. Just looked at a person a few minutes ago. He was asked me by a fine boy the other day was hunting squirrels. That morning I got five. I left one for that afternoon. He only get six in the state of Kentucky. That's a limit. So this certain person said I got nine. Christian boy. Fine kid. I said you've done wrong. You did wrong. He said I said I had five that morning. Save one for that afternoon. And when I got that one squirrel, looked in a tree and counted five or six sitting right there where I could look at them. Walked out and left them. I said, I walked up in a tree not long. There's about 15 or 20 sitting there. I just took the limit and walk away and left the rest of them there. I said, if I come to this country preaching to you boys and you people here, the thing that's right, I've got to live that example. &gt;&gt; Christianity ain't what you say, it's what you live. What you do, it's an example. You're the salt of the earth. I said, "Then the law says, Jesus said, you give Caesar then things that belong to Caesar." If you break that speed law out there, what are you doing? You're doing wrong. You sin. &gt;&gt; Give Caesar what's Caesars's. And God, what's God say? Well, the law's wrong. I can't help what wrong it is. It's wrong to break Jesus commandment. And if you don't give Caesar the things of Caesars, then you did what Jesus told you not to do in a transgressor of the law of sin. Is &gt;&gt; that right? &gt;&gt; We're all guilty. We do it. But when you see yourself wrong, stop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People are watching you. &gt;&gt; People won't go to church, but they'll read you. See what you do. &gt;&gt; So get Christ in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's a real Christ. The Holy Spirit's the same thing. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit. Christ means the anointed one. And the Holy Spirit is that anointed. &gt;&gt; And you are the one that's anointed. &gt;&gt; See, and it's Christ in you anointing you. See what I mean? &gt;&gt; Man, you got the right thing. Then he can use you to anything he wants to use you because you're in the body and subject to any of those gifts. But see, to have one of the gifts outside of the body, it would do you no good. Though I speak with tongue of men and angels, have not charity, it profit me nothing. Though I have faith and can understand all the mysteries of God, profit me nothing. the lie uh give my body to be burnt as a sacrifice give all my goods to the poor though I have faith to move a mountain I am nothing see don't depend on those things the Holy Spirit is a being it's God &gt;&gt; God in you the person God that's lit your whole entire being you're changed &gt;&gt; you're a new creature any little thing that's wrong he'll tell you that's wrong don't do it &gt;&gt; father I didn't mean to do that you forgive See, and that's that's the Holy Spirit. I don't care how much you spoke in hung, how much you run, how much you jumped, how much you did this, that, the other. Hey, whatever you done, it wouldn't mean a thing if the Holy Spirit wasn't in there to condemn you on the things that's right and wrong. &gt;&gt; Now, that's reason this person here is right. Let the Holy Spirit do it. But now, you see, now what's causing this? Let me say it with love. sprinkled with love and and anointed with the word. If the genuine Holy Spirit was in you, you wouldn't question that. You know it yourself. It's an individual thing between you and God. See, you know that something's happening. You know that there's a change where there's any anything else. You yourself, you're the change. &gt;&gt; See, you're the one that's going to change it inside of you. And you know you have it. Whether you spoke a tong, whether you jump shouted or anything else, you know that God lives in you, &gt;&gt; that you don't walk with your own mind. It's the mind of Christ that leads you with that word just exactly the way it goes. Now, but I would if people say, "Well, then brother, you don't believe you ought to speak with tongues." See, then you get exactly backwards what I've just said. Sure, I believe you should speak with tongues. And some of you people see, but you get this and I get this like back here this 1500 miles. You see, being here at the tabernacle, just if you don't understand it, then ask me. See, write it back to me. If you don't understand, just say what I say here. You see, and I you, as Paul said, you follow me as I follow Christ. You see, then you see I'm wrong and get away from me. See, that's all because I I'd be the wrong person. See, please explain. People are saying, "Brother Brandom is more than a man. He can create and Jesus can look just like brother Brandon. Now let me the person said this whoever it might be I don't know but I am your brother. &gt;&gt; See Jesus is your savior. I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you. Now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth. The person that told this person this now it's just a looks to me like a woman's handwriting. Very beautiful handwriting. And I'd say that was a woman's handwriting. And I don't know who is see now brother Brandon uh could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that. One sense the word that's exactly the truth. Another sense the word is an antichrist. &gt;&gt; That's the difference between right and wrong. &gt;&gt; To make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist. &gt;&gt; See, for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high &gt;&gt; and will come again in great power and glory. &gt;&gt; But for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him, &gt;&gt; it's exactly the truth. and you become Christ. Remember my message on messiahs. See you are the word messiah means the anointed one. Now you are if you have the holy spirit you become the anointed one. See then there's all kinds of anointed ones. Now watch if it's a bible anointed ones. Many of them are anointed. See, the whole thing is in such a great conglomeration of every kind of a mixup and a and a a Satan with all of his cunningness coming and impersonated just to the dot almost to the dot. There's only one way you can absolutely be sure. Check the word by word, word by word. That's the only way you can. But to me as a a person William Brham or or any other man or woman to be the Lord Jesus Christ our savior that is an era. &gt;&gt; But to be anointed with his spirit which brings his own person of his life into you. It was so beautifully typed in Elijah and Elisha. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. when Elisha was taking up Elijah the old prophet going home and he's tired and weary and there's a chariot hooked across the river there and he uh to take him up home with horses of fire and um did you notice that when Elijah and Elisha crossed the river the school of the prophets is up there watching him and Elijah took his mantle and or struck the river and when it did it uh divided and he went across and he said to the young prophet uh what what are Follow me for what? What? What do you wish? He said that a double portion of your spirit come up on me. A double portion of that mighty prophet come upon me. He said, "You've asked a hard thing. But if you see me when I go away, then it'll come up on you." So you can imagine how he watched the prophet. &gt;&gt; Now in that day, that prophet was the word for he was the manifestation of the word &gt;&gt; to the word. And he know there had to be a greater ministry come because it required a greater thing. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus is here on earth, he was the Elijah. These things that I do shall you do also. Greater than these things shall you do because I go unto my father. Now how you going to do it? Watch him. Who is he? The word. &gt;&gt; See, watch him. Now when it comes to creation of things, it's true. Jesus never right straight out created anything. He brought it into existence. He took a substance first. He took water, made wine. He took bread and made more bread. He took fish and made more fish. &gt;&gt; But he promised that greater things of this would be done. &gt;&gt; See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see now why it's in a more evil day than it was when he was here. &gt;&gt; See, it's still him but using your tabernacle. See, and this person that's in you, which is your birth, you are John Doe. You were born in a certain month, and you were born under a certain star. You were born under a certain thing. And that has something to do with you. Certainly does. I know. I used to, Papa, you say, "I can't plant them potatoes at this time because the moon isn't right." You can't plant them potatoes, Billy. And I said, "I'm not planting them in the moon. I'm planting them here in the ground." &gt;&gt; He said, "All right, smart. Come on. You get a few bumps on your head, you learn something. I did. I did. I tell you, take a board and lay it down out there on the grass in the dark of the moon and watch what happens. That grass will die right now. Lay it on the light of the moon. You let lay there a weekend. Won't hurt it a bit. Watch that sea. When that moon changes shter, when the tide when the moon goes out, the tide follows it out and it's millions of miles from the earth. Not only that, go down here in the state of Kentucky and sink a rod down the ground till you get into the salt water and watch that pipe how deep it is when the when the tides in and watch how it goes out plum across under the earth. Certainly you plant something that spreads out on top of the earth in the dark moon. Watch it go right down make a like a reddish a turnup wheel and you plant it back the other way and watch it spread out on top of the earth. Sure, it's got something to do. Why did Aaron have on his breastplate the birth stone of each one of those patriarchs? Look at those mothers when they give the utterance. When that mothers and them Hebrew women and labor giving utterance to those children being born, it placed their name. It told their birth. It put them in the homeland and set them over to eternity. &gt;&gt; One of these days when I come in and stay a little, I'll take that subject. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And then watch Jacob when he was dying there, when he laid his hands up on the patriarchs and blessed them, he tell them exactly where they would be. And that's exactly according to their name and exactly according to their birth. &gt;&gt; Sure, it has something to do with you. Now, that's your birth path. That's what you are, a natural man or natural woman. But when you're reborn again, that's not the outside conscience. The outside is what you see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. But the inside of that is what you really are. &gt;&gt; Now, this out here, Satan's temption knocks you around everywhere here. But down here, he can't do it unless you let him do it. For in here, you've got faith. And faith don't come from the outer conscience. It's reasons. &gt;&gt; But in faith, there's no reason. You've got it from God and you know it's there. I don't care how much it looks wrong. You still owe it right. Thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's nothing going to bother that. &gt;&gt; Nothing can bother that. It's moving right straight on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Difficult means nothing to it. Wait right on through it. For it's a word and the word's a sword and a word cuts the sword cuts itself free from everything else. See, &gt;&gt; takes a hand of faith to hold that word. &gt;&gt; That faith got be now. See, when that inside conscience, here's the inside. Here's the outside. It's revealed in here. Truth is out here. It's reason. Now, don't it look reasonable if we just say we just all go over and join the assemblies. Now, I like the assemblies of God. I like the oneness. I like all those churches. Well, we just all go and affiliate with them. Maybe do some good. That's the reason the outside. But down on the inside, &gt;&gt; watch it. when you see out here this will this will disagree then look at the assembly many things that they do that I don't believe it's scriptural and can prove it to them it's not scriptural but there's so many minds packed up in it these thousands of those assembly brothers and sisters who believe this the word and don't believe what the assemblies teach to be right &gt;&gt; but they're in the web the Baptist the presenter the oneness and all the rest of them they're in that web where a group of man gets together and they reason and they so What's a prestige about a man? Here's a bishop sitting here. General overseer. He says anything. What's the little fellow going to say? He's afraid to say anything. I agree with you. Yeah, that's right. Uhhuh. Yes. Bishop or president or you're That's exactly right. He agrees with him. Here, let's take an alcoholic out here on the street that an ordinary citizen pass down the street and say, "Oh, bum." Nothing to him. Take him down here and put him on the police force and put a badge on him and a gun on him. Good morning, John. It's so nice to see you again. See, &gt;&gt; respect to one another. Jesus said, "How can you have faith?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you have respects that type, you know, uh slice of respects one, I don't remember just how the word goes there, but when your desire respects one from another. See, you can't do that. And when man gets together and organized down and the little man's afraid to say anything, goes, "The bishop said so." The preserver said so. But don't disregard the man. Believe him to be a good man. But always remember God's word is right and all others contrary is wrong. &gt;&gt; Let my word be true and every man's word be a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See it. That's what we want to do is believe that. Now remember, we are not the word but we are the word. &gt;&gt; Now you got it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not God, but he was God. &gt;&gt; He was a man, yet he was God. &gt;&gt; He could cry and yet he could raise the dead. He could cry for a man being dead and raise him back up again. &gt;&gt; He was Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Rapi, Jehovah Manasses. He was Jehovah completely. He was Jehovah. And yet he was a man. &gt;&gt; He owned the earth and made the earth and had not a place to lay his head. He said, "The birds that I made got nests and I ain't got a place to lay my head. The foxes that are created has holes in the ground. I haven't got one myself even to be buried in." That's right. He had to borrow somebody's grave to be buried in. He created every womb that was in a woman. He had no womb to be born in. He had to borrow a womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He created the earth and had not a place to be buried at. He had a bar hole in the ground to be buried in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Joseph of Arthia. See they had they had had to bar a place yet he was God. Proved that he was God. Now you understand we are not. We are messiahs but not that Jesus. He is our father. We're just anointed with his spirit and that's the reason his life. And that gets people see if you don't sit and think it through it gets people to believe well this guy would be the Messiah. Sure he is. This one over here could be. They both are. See? Well, how can it be two of them? There's thousands of them. See, but you see his life is separated on the day of Pentecost when that pillar of fire came down. It's separated like tongues and set upon each of them. God dividing himself among his people because the church in Christ is one. This is a husband and wife is one. Brother Brandham, how am I supposed to show my wife that I really care for her? And yet uh play or stay with the word that say stay with the word but still having a question like this said why don't you practice what you preach or believe. Well, then if the wife if the wife is saying this to you when she's has a right to say it, you better get right. &gt;&gt; Then if she is if she is saying it just to be evil, remember the Bible said it was better that a millstone was hanged at your neck and drowned in the depths of the sea than even to offend the least of these my little ones. That's just great. And maybe that this wife is not that type of person. Maybe she's a different or maybe she's a good person. Maybe she's just testing you to see what she'll do. Now stay in love with her and let her see Jesus in you. You do that. See, you just go on some I give a little illustration this morning about a person. One time this little woman had received the Holy Ghost. She was very sweet little person. She said, "Well, she had a hard life and her husband was an alcoholic." And so, um, she just kept on. She bore with him. He, "You want to go to church, honey? Take off." But I went out to Slooh down at the old Brown Derby down here. Going on. So, they hung out down there all the time. Used to be Bonifers. Many of you oldtimes you remember Bonifer had their own corner. It's called the Brown Derby now, I believe it is. So, hanging around down there and the first thing you know, one night come up question about church, about Christians. One of the old drunks sitting there said there ain't no such a thing as Christians anymore. There is no such a thing. All this bunch of hypocrites said seem smoking, drinking, doing the same thing that we do. And said call themselves Christians. There is no s. This one drunk raised up said just a minute. &gt;&gt; There's one that I know about. Said who is it? Said it's my wife. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See she become salty. He's catched it all the time. He said, "I bet she's up to the squeeze." He said, "No, she's still a Christian. I'll prove it to you." Said, "I tell you what, let's do let's go up home." Not sure whether she's Christian or not. Said, "Let's go up home now. Let's really be drunk. We're going to act like we're really drunk." Knocked at the door and come in staggering over everything and and why the chair sitting around this way and everything. And she set them all a chair and his guest, you know, and tried to make him just as welcome as could be. Said, "I want you to fix us some supper." And so they she went out fixed it and said, "We want ham and eggs." He know they had it. So they fixed the ham and eggs. When he got that table, he looked at him like that, picked up his plate and slammed the stuff on the floor, said, "You know, I don't like my eggs like that. Come on, boys. Let's get out of here." Anyhow, like that. Like that. They went out and sat down like that. You know, she come out. She said, "Dear, I'm I'm sorry I didn't get them fixed. I'll fix them over for Oh, nonsense. You know, I didn't want them that way in the first place. Just carrying on like that. They went out there, sat on, act like he was drunk. They heard her in there kind of snubbing to herself, singing real low voice. Must Jesus bear the cross alone. All the world will freeise. &gt;&gt; There's a cross for everyone. And there's a cross for me. This consecrated cross I'll bear till death shall set me free. &gt;&gt; One drunk deal said she's a Christian. &gt;&gt; She's got it. That little woman led her husband plus these others to Christ that night. Think why? &gt;&gt; Gus be real sweet. Just remember he knows all about it. So sister or brother, whoever it might be or brother it is here because he asked about his wife, you just be salty. She'll get thirsty. If there's anything in her to thirst for if it isn't, remember if you got the wrong person, you'll get the right one in the millennium. You just keep on going. All wrongs will be made right there. Brother Brandham, do you teach that the bride must not attend any church unless you are there preaching or else the tabernacle? Other words, the tabernacle got else means other word. Also, do you teach that we need not keep the the Sunday or holidays as working, fishing or so forth or I'd say Sunday it looked like Sunday to me like or Sunday I guess it is holidays or Sundays? Yeah, Sunday. Is that what it look like? Um &gt;&gt; holy days. &gt;&gt; Holy Sunday and &gt;&gt; Sunday and holies. No, you're mistaken. See, let me go and just answer this and come by. Do you teach that the bride must not attend any other church unless you are preaching uh preaching or else otherwise the tabernacle? No, I don't teach that. I don't believe that. I do not believe it. We've got ministers sitting here that's scattered all around through the country and I believe they are part of that bride. I believe that a man or woman can go to church anywhere they want to go that teaches the word. Now I believe if they don't teach the whole word and you can't go to church uh any other place where they teach the whole word, go where they teach half the word until you can get to where they teach the whole word. Go to church whatever you do do that also. Do you teach that we must we must need not keep Sunday or any holy day or or working or like working or fishing on Sunday? I believe it's a sin to fish and hunt and work on Sunday when you can go to church. &gt;&gt; I believe you're transgressing the laws of God. Is there a commandment to such? Yes, sir. Now, in the Old Testament, we had a type of the Sabbath day. It was Jesus did not come for you keep Sabbath days. The old Sabbath day was Saturday, which was the end of the week. Sunday is the eighth day or the first day of the week which Jesus rose on. I do not believe it's right to. Now, if you're way away into a wilderness somewhere and you're out there on a hunting trip, there's no church around or anything like that and there's nothing you can do. If you're fishing, I believe that would be all right. But if you're around in the city or around where church is going on, you should tend church by all means somewhere. And I believe as far as working, I believe if the ox is in the ditch, something has to be done on Sunday, you go ahead and do it. If it's something that you couldn't help, it had to work that way. But if you just do it and wait till Sunday to do it or just do it like that, you're wrong. See, we must not do that. We must respect that holy day. And now remember, go to church somewhere someplace. If I I could call a certain denomination a church, but I wouldn't do it because this church only thing I know what they teach that I believe is they say they believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God. Well, I do that. All their other teaching is they believe in and remission of sins is by water. Not is infinite oneness. They do the same thing. But I'm talking about them. They believe that at regeneration by water and so forth. And I don't believe that. And uh they oh they believe that anything's got divine healing in it is of the devil. And they believe in all they're the only they're the only thing that there is. And only thing you have to do is put your name on that book. And if you ain't got it there, you're lost. Now I don't believe that. But if there was no other church to go to, I wouldn't go there critical. I go there with the intention of my presence and me sitting by somebody that the Christ that was in my heart might influence somebody there. Go among them. But don't be partakers of their unbelief. Brother Brandham, I want amen to the word of God. Thank God for the questions and answers. They've always been a blessing to me in my spiritual walk. And as we prepare to go to the table of the Lord, um let's stand. Turn in our Bibles to 1 Corinthians 11. Amen. Conduct, order, and doctrine has always been a blessing to me. Just appreciate that tonight. God bless each of you. Amen. in the scriptures verse number 23 1 Corinthians 11 it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also So he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come." Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, so be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wilfor my brethren, when you come together to eat, tear one for another. And if any man hunger, let him eat at home. But you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Amen. Let's just sing a portion of that song. When he reached down his hand for me. [Music] When he reached down for me. [Music] When he reach down for me. I was lost in the land without for [Music] one for another. Brother Brandham, many times on the tape, we pray silent prayer as we pray. Terry one for another. You pray for me, I'll pray for you. Pray for the one in front of you, behind you, or next to you. And as we pray one for another in silent prayer just for a moment. Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold the bread that was made for this service. Lord, the bread, the unleavened bread as a type of your word, top of your body that was broken for us. Lord, as we partake of these parcels tonight, and we bless it, Lord, we know that it represents your body. It is a type of your body. It is not your body, but you told us to do it in remembrance of you. Now bless each one that partakes of it and bless the bread we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Heavenly Father in my hands I hold the cup of the New Testament of your blood. Lord as we hold these vessels that represents your blood that was shed for us. Lord we know that it represents your blood. is not your blood. And we thank you that we can partake. We know, Lord, that there's healing in the cup. There's deliverance as we partake. It is divine healing to us. And we believe that with all our heart as we've been taught. And Lord, now we just pray that you would bless it and bless bless everyone that partake of it. May they receive the benefit and the strength as they did in the Old Testament when they came out of Egypt. They partook, Lord, and you kept them strong and healthy. Even their clothes didn't wear out. You were Jehovah Gyra for them. And here now after Calvary, you shed your blood so that we can stand here today. We're not worthy, but you are. Now bless us, we pray as we partake in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can follow uh take your seats and follow the instructions. The ushers [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] burnt with fire before the rising of the sun. Amen. Let's all take our Bibles and turn to St. John chapter 13, the foot washing portion of the service starting with verse number two. Supper being ended, the devil having into the heart of Judas's Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God and went to God. He rised from supper, he laid aside his garments, and he took a towel and girded himself. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter? Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet, but is clean every wit, and you're clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I've given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. Amen. Are you happy to do them? Amen. It's a privilege to do them with the revelation in our heart of what we're doing. Amen. We thank the Lord that he has given us Such a tremendous word in this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song. Um, it shall be light in the evening time. Oh, go the race in the evening.
