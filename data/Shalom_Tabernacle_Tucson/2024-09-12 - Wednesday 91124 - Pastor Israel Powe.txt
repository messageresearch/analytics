heart that we've gathered here in your name and touch each one Lord that they would receive their portion Lord we thank you for bringing us together once again and Lord we thank you for making a way for us Lord to hear your word just one more time and to worship you in spirit and in truth speak to our hearts we pray May each one receive their portion we ask bless those saints that wanted to be here but they cannot and those that are traveling and Lord the ones that are not feeling well we pray that you'll touch them everyone we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless you so good to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening amen are you happy to be here so good to have you in the house of the Lord and he said he'd be here in the midst where we would Gather in his name and we come gather GED in his name we like to uh go right into the scriptures before we go to prayer this evening and there's a portion of scripture in the Old Testament Numbers chapter 32 and we'll take first Timothy 4 as we go along Ephesians 4 as well Numbers chapter 32 vers number six just really um meditating and going on over the message from Sunday some of those things that the Lord had placed upon my heart and uh really been going into the faith of God and how all things are possible if we can believe and then getting into the things that would hinder our faith and the battle that we're in and taking that message the um greatest battle of fought brother brandham breaks down the man and the woman how we're are a Triune being Body Spirit and soul and I just want to take this scripture in Numbers chapter 32 and verse number six and it says here verse start with seven and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadesh barnea to see the land for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them and the Lord's anger was kindled at same time and he swear saying surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall see the land which I swear unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob because they have not wholly followed me save Caleb the son of jeffner and the kisite and Joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the Lord so there was a group that did not wholly follow and then there was this group that Holy followed and then let's take one scripture in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 21 and this is the only scripture that uh I can see that mentions the body spirit and soul in one context typically it's the body and the Soul or the body and the spirit as Jesus talked about and but here the Apostle Paul grabs 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verses 21- 23 as a matter of fact I believe that's one of the Epistles that he commanded to be read among all of the congregation actually 1 Thessalonians 5:21 you have it say Amen prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word tonight a few moments before we bring our needs in prayer and really just set aside time to pray and meditate upon your goodness Lord bring us into the framework of what you have for us by the ministring of your word Lord we know that you promised that you would be in our midst and you said that the word would never your word would not return void and we know that is true Lord and we claim that tonight and we pray that you'll move aside every weight and our tiredness of our bodies the weariness of our mind the cares of life and may we receive something that our whole Spirit soul and body can receive receive in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated this whole man brother Ram in the message um um greatest battle OFA paragraph 72 he said if you'll sit down when you get home draw three little rings and you know those three rings represents the tri Unity of a man what a man is now when we come in here you just see me my frame I see you man man or woman but that's just the outside of us and that's the body um beyond the body is our spirit and in that Spirit the prophet of God tells us the conscience memory reasons affections and our imaginations are what is used to contact our spirit and our body is contacted through see taste feel smell and the things that we hear it's the outside body the third drink that makes up to man is his soul and the prophet of God makes it very clear that that is governed by either Faith or doubt and there's a channel that that is uh used to get to Faith or doubt and that's called free moral agency we are not robots We Are Not Angels and even some angels can choose because they did choose but human beings in particular makes us different than the animal kingdom is that we have the ability to choose and in this free moral agency is where the Battleground is we choose to follow the lord to do what's right we choose to read the things that are available to our see taste feel smell and he and through our conscience memory reasons affections and imaginations those are choices so it's really nice I wish I was a graphic artist and I wish I could put it up on the screen three rings or three bodies that actually make us who we are and when we talk about you know this Earthly Tabernacle science and medical the medical field can look at that body and run test on it to to tell you whether you have a healthy body or not or if something is weak in your body it's tremendous I I think it's one of the closest things on the natural level to one of God's works because healing God is the Healer and he uses doctors medicine and all of that for healing but our spirit conscious memory reason affections and all those things they uh we we make a choice to allow things to come in and out and I and as I was expressing to you all on Sunday that this goes further than you know just arguing with the other people or other churches or getting your Doctrine across you know this is arguing with yourself this is getting the the issues dealt out with inside of you your spirit if a man can control his Spirit or if he can't control his spirit it's like a city Without Walls I mean anything can go anything can happen and so I think that you know cleansing that man uh is the is what we really want to focus on now the scripture tells us that in 1 Timothy chapter 4 we'll read it for you verse number 11 says this and this is Paul talking to Timothy these things command and teach let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in Purity till I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by Prophecy with the laying on of Hands by the Pres meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them now we know and I brought it out before and brother bandam brings it out and the word of God tells us that we believe the whole word not part of it all of it and in believing all of the word we believe all of the word with all of who we are we take our body our spirit our soul the whole man and we believe the word not with just our intellect not just with our head but we want down in our subconscious the little man that's driving the boat as brother bam says you can't see him but he's turning the utter and people will come up in the prayer line yes I believe and they're saying that out of their mouth but something in their spirit in their heart is still doubting that's the man we want to deal with and we want that cleared out so Satan has a way of trying to make himself um uh manifested through us and to us so brother vam takes this and the greatest battle ever fought and I'd like to read for you here the sister can pick this up for us paragraph 72 if you sit down when you get home and draw three little rings you'll find out that the outside body has five senses it's contacted by that is C taste feel smell in here that's the five senses that control the human body inside of the body is a soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations conscience memory reasons affections that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit it only has one sense the spirit oh let's get it it the spirit has one sense and that sense is either dominates it is Faith or doubt that's exactly and there's only one Avenue to it that's free moral agency you can accept doubt or you can accept Faith either one you want to work on therefore Satan began at the principal part to cause the spirit of man to doubt God's word god began at the principal part to lay his word in that Spirit there you are that's what does it if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not be a feble person in our midst in another five minutes so we're all in one place physically but our Spirits some of us are at work some of us are forgot an email some of us are what we going to eat tomorrow some of us are stressing over whatever are we're here I see you here you see me here but my mind is over here my affections and it's drawing away but if if I can get the word in those channels and know that I came here for the word and the purpose that God would have for me all things are possible to them that believe I can have whatever God has determined in his word for me to have if that would line right up and so that's free moral agance that's a choice that you make that is on you as the prophet brings it out and brother bam he continues paragraph 76 remember it's not Christian Science Now mind over matter that the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and there Begins the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of God brought in the channel of your thought see it's not the thought as Christian Science makes it mind over matter no that isn't it but your mind accepts it it grasps it it's your mind what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that gots life in it it brings life into you oh brother when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of God is manifested in you if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you how many believe that tonight you know this is really really something I played the quote for you I read it for you first and I played it for you for again where uh brother banam was talking about those Beatles in their music and their whole thing that they were doing and that even people who had nothing to do with the Bible or church but they believed that something good could happen to them even be healed in their bodies and the Lord Lord honored that and so I was meditating on that a little bit further and I started to look when I first moved here here in uh it was the December or so of 1999 and then I think Sharon came over in January or 2000 she always corrects me on the dates but we got here about 2000 I took a little course at the Puma college and one of the English courses had us to a project to write a paper and I took the subject on um the effects of uh what was it not Divine Healing but um the effects of a positive attitude when you get bad results from the doctor and this is not Christian people at all these are medical doctors that have it documented that when you get bad news from The Physician if you just have a good attitude your chance of getting better increase by like 60 or 70% it's a major major the doctors know this the healthc care industry know this and so you know and I I I looked at that and this was 20 something years ago where well it hasn't changed and they it even goes even further with this um what they call the placebo effect you know they give these fake pills and then they're trying to test a drug and you know and it's just tremendous what when you think that you are getting something that helps you when you just think that now this is not the Bible this is not me preaching this is not a quotation from the Bible this is not religious people these these These are documented in journals that the manufacturers of drugs have hidden and one gentleman he he took the the care of Information Act and sued them and made them open up their numbers and they found out when they're testing these drugs that many of the people that's taking fake pills are doing better than the people that's getting the drug that they're trying to push it's not a joke it's not even like somebody's making it up it's not like a one like in hitting in a corner it's like a cross the board when you get a chance go use the internet and look up the placebo and then get your shouting shoes on because they not even quoting the scripture but I'm looking at it in the lens of the scripture if a man without the Bible can be healed by a green or a blue pill because somebody said this pill is going to help you what about God's word what about his word so so so I'm a I'm a tremendous proponent for the internet now okay because it's going to help you I I I was sharing this with a brother with this new found Revelation I got another Pastor in the city and I we was talking about the internet I said I changed my tune on the internet said how so I said well I think if you're using the internet to um to better your faith in the things of God then you'd have to say it came from God wouldn't you wouldn't you say the printing press in its use when the Bibles now you didn't have to copy copy copy you can now print the Bibles so who's mad at that we can print more Bibles and wouldn't you say in the grand of things that's why the printing press was created to print God's word huh think about it what about the tape recorder it wasn't to listen to Bluegrass I tell you that I'm always hating on blueg grass but or jazz or rap the tape recorder was invented so that you can hear the voice of God in this last day now I'm coming as a preacher as a believer in the word and that's my position uh that's because that's how I relate to it the tape recorder in my life is so I can hear the prophet's voice for this last day Revelations 10:7 to be fulfilled so let's go a little bit further with the internet so or the advancement of technology I can consume this word in a way like never before I can I can actually take this message and listen to it in Spanish English French or whatever language it's in download it and compare it and hear it in my own language every not a two component not a tape and then a tape recorder one component voice it's right there for me to listen to and that's from this so who's mad at that who's benefiting from that I can sit down and I can take the entire uh scriptures the Greek diet log the message of the hour and see what brother random says before 63 after I can take the third pull what he said about the seals break it down the prayer lines open it up put it back together again listen to the tape uh know how long the tape is going to be can really ice it and take it in Parts you could never do that with a tape cassette how many know what I'm talking about you get that tape cassette you try to find that spot on the tape good luck brother you have to fast forward if wir and you went too far and fast forward and you fast forward okay somewhere in there and wait them days are over so tell me who's mad at that I can handle the message in a way that I've never been able to handle the message so for me I embrac that and and knowing that Satan wants to use that as well so this this um not sure why I got on to that but this uh consuming this um uh uh the the the message in the and the way that God has brought it brought it to us with the seed taste feel smell and he and the different avenues that we can wholly believe it it's it's a greater way for us to do that today than it ever has been and it's up to you I mean you can use the technology the way you want to use it that that's on you but if you have the technology and you do now and we use it for other things why can't I use it for the message and I believe that's why it was created for me think about it think about it the grand scheme of things God allowed it to be not while brother Brandon was here he's going off the scene and here we are with the message and the way that we have it years and years ago we couldn't preach a sermon and have it on the screen for the audience to hear it too and see it too but we have that how many like that should we take it away now some we feel like we couldn't have church now because it's quotes aing on the screen where's the quotes at on the screen and so that who who who does that help how does that make it better are you consuming it better so if you take these three rings as as you do what the prophet said and you draw those three rings then you realize your body your spirit and your soul um needs to take these Avenues and here what brother Bram says I know I'm not going to finish this but he says this in paragraph 104 in the message the greatest battle ever fought fought what was the matter you had to open up the Channel first you got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the Battlefront that takes God's word he is the word and he stands there there's nothing going to stop it then there's nothing that's what I was talking about the placebo the placebo effect in how people who feel like and believe that they're being helped from their medical doctor they do far much better than those that have a negative attitude oh man I knew it why ises this happen to me this is horrible it happened to my dad I knew this kind of things always happen to me you know that negativity ain't going to get you anywhere there's no value in it at all we are believers we're Christians so our confession should always be positive and never negative and if the natural things can produce those kind of results what about us when we take the word of God now this first Thessalonians let's take Ephesians chapter 4 we read this for you on Sunday and I trust this will bless you again that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man Ephesians 4:22 which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust verse 23 and be renewed in what the spirit of your mind you need that to be renewed and that you put on the new man which is after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil one translation says don't give no opportunity neither neither give give no opportunity for the devil neither give place for the devil don't give him any opportunity any of your time any time that you could spend meditating on the Lord use it you know if you were sick or put on your bed of Affliction let's say your deathbed you had so much time to live you would go back and look at all the time you wasted and you should have been going in the things of the Lord that's what you would do as a believer you say oh my you know and I thought you know you know I got some bad I'm telling you testimony I got some bad news wasen bad news but it was just uh some stressful news uh this afternoon but this morning A friend of mine called a doctor a good friend of mine he called me young man and he said that he had he was diagnosed with cancer and it's like wow in light of him being diagnosed with cancer and then the bad news that I got really wasn't bad news that's bad news he has to take a month off of work for the treatment and he's got to go through all of the things and the fear and all of the thing with his family and all stuff and I'm thinking wow wow that's a that changes your day that changes your perspective and then you think well you know you have this whole day and it's some you get some news like that then you'll start to value did I really spend my time the way I should have neither give place to the devil your time here listen Saints you only got one life if you're not honest with God you're not gonna be honest on your job you won't be honest in your home you won't be honest in a lot of areas or if you're lazy here you'll be lazy over there you're lazy because you only got one life you don't have two or three different lives that you're living the life that you live is the life that that God gave you and if you take the life that he gave you seriously it'll translate in every Avenue of your life and these are just little reminders that the Lord gives us to put off concerning the former conversation neither give place to the devil verse 28 let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands of things which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption 1 Thessalonians 5 2123 says prove all things hold fasted that which is good of stain from all appearance of evil you know that's not just the appearance of evil like how you might see me looking at something that might appear evil or doing something that might appear evil this is in light of God in the whole host of Heaven this is the eyes there's eyes watching you little eyes little eyes be careful what you see ears what you hear you know there's eyes that are watching you in your daily life in your your task the things you look at the things you laugh and the things you indulge in and then we come and we want the Holy Spirit to answer our prayer but our Spirits have been clogged up with these other areas now you got the three ring man you draw that out in your own mind that that man has to you know you got to you want that man to be cleaned up you want the inner conscience that manant to be holy following the Lord holy following the things of the word Asain from all appearance of evil and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserve blameless until the coming of the Lord Jesus and this is the real test is my spirit blameless are my intentions my motives my affections are they blameless you know that Spirit man he sees that and that's really the the important part it's not the part that you all can see of me it's the part that he sees because before the word we are all naked in his sight he sees us he scans right through us and we might say praise the lord we might lift our hand or we might even do a good deed but our intentions and our motives there's some greed there's some pride there's some temper there's some anger there's some lust there and then we just let it go on but you know I I don't want to let that go on I want my whole Spirit to be cleansed by the word and when I stand before him it'll be like I'm standing before before like my whole life is laid out right before you all of my thoughts laid out before the word and then if I can do that before the word I can lay that out before you too my life will be a clear clean life I don't have to hide anything I don't have to you know you know some areas of my you know whatever I'm doing I have to hide those things and so Lord Jesus um help us to move into that so brother brandom makes this statement you all remember it I'm not going to read it but you remember the statement that a man totally surrender to God is omnipotent how many you remember that how you heard that that's totally surrendered that's his body his spirit and his soul surrender to God that man is omnipotent Jesus said a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand so part of you are quoting the word you believe the message you believe every word but there's another part of you the black dog that's feeding on things that's that's not right it's Leo deia it's like you like they rate the movies it's a PG it's only a PG PG according to who who who rated that because a parent ain't a parent anymore they're not the same what we call parents in the 70s ain't parents today the parents ain't a man in a woman anymore so there's a PG rating or it's rated for all audiences B based on who I mean they can't even get it together on what is saying or what is pure or holy or clean or any they can't get it together so why would I listen to what Hollywood said was a good movie or safe movie it ought to be my spirit if I heard one swear word that that I turn that movie off I'm done with it huh is that too much yes too much if if I want to play games okay but I don't want to I don't want the angel of the Lord sitting next to me and the whole host of e Heaven sitting next to me and then I I'm watching the movie and then they start swearing and I'm like okay I'll just fast forward that part and that's fine it ain't worth it it's just not worth it's a kingdom divided against itself I'm trying to I'm trying to make the Rapture like in my soul and in my spirit and in my conscience I want my whole being for the Rapture and then I'm I'm feeding this you know junk food on the side and then I'm going in and trying to work out with the personal trainer and it's like man you cheating on your diet is this a couple Twinkies it's like those are no NOS you said you wanted to you said you wanted yeah you said you wanted to get in shape you said you wanted to be able to run up the hill you said you wanted to be in maximum physical health then you need to dedicate yourself to this diet right here and the men that do it they get the results from it what about in your spirit what about in your spiritual diet the Lord's dealing with me I'm going this way and that's the way I'm going to go that's it I'm I'm I God forgive me for my foolishness I let things slip and slide and play I know they're wrong I didn't say it but I indulged in it so I like I was okay with it too but give no place to Satan give no place to the devil now let me take this quote here at 7:58 I want supposed to be done by eight and thank you brother Chuck that means so much much tell me to take my time because everybody doesn't say that but it's okay but thank you couple more two more most if I get most of y'all to say it then those that don't say it then make them feel bad we got all night amen your spirit wants me to take my time the carnal man wants to get out of here and get home to get some sleep you'll get your sleep in the grave that's where you catch up with all your sleep but right now we're trying to get our souls ready for the Rapture huh is that serious or what is that true yeah that's true that's true no matter how you slice it so but we we don't want to worry out because this is a prayer meeting and I want to just read this two places in the message greatest battle ever fought ever fought to encourage you brother random says this here paragraph number 108 107 you got your senses see taste feel smell here they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them now imaginations conscience memories reasons affections they're all right if they agree with the word word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it You' blow Fu right quick see if your reason disagree with the word get away from it that's right the engine if your memory if your imaginations if your conscience anything disagrees with that what's on the inside get rid of it what you got then you got a solar system hallelujah it's God set let the stars in order and said hang there till I call you they stay there nothing's going to move them when God can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscience everything cleaned out Lord clean it out clean it out Lord until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there that's right he come around and say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to God it shines out certainly just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God see that's the main thing there's your Battleground your Battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit you can have a little conscience and a little feelings and a little Sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just little Sensations and things but when it comes to really your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends God let none of them miss it I like that God let none of them miss it see how the prophet just tries to bring you right along he's bringing it he's bring said God let none of them miss it and it's on the tape there God let none of them miss it I don't want to miss it I sure don't no no no paragraph 111 he says it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out even every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle battle against it no we know that's true last place here paragraph number 128 last place I'll read all right there it is right there those channels you just get them open up don't just bypass them then if Satan can get through there get by these conscience and all these other things then he gets right down in here to the end of the soul and the mind now if he can just get you you'll never you'll never look at one of them until first you have to let him in here you have to let him in then when he gets in he gets control then what does he do he begins to use the conscience begins to use begin to use this Outlet what is it see taste feel smell he imaginations conscious so we let him in we stream it we download it we look at it it is our choice to do it you make the choice to look at what you look at feed on what you feed on uh subscribe to whatever you subscribe to that is that is on that's your decision to make it it's a horrible age yes it's so accessible it's terrible there's images there's all kind of things going on but you have to get get yourself to the place where you reach out and say yes I want to look at this and then when you look at that you open it up and then Satan gets in there and he starts doing whatever he wants to do and we have these mind battles and then our faith can't get where it needs to be and then we have temper and issues and little hates and little lust and little battles and then there just all kind of garbage clogging up our faith and we know that we know those things are wrong we don't want to do what's wrong but we're we're just in an age where it's so easy we slip right into it and the word of God comes forth to remind you to don't give place to the devil don't give him that time that place in your mind doesn't belong to him don't let him come in your mind and then you got to battle him out just keep that away you'll see enough without even looking at anything with your own efforts there'll be enough to battle just like that but it's just like it's just so polarizing the age that we live in and you know and I said this to the brother the pastor brother I was talking to I said brother 20 or 30 years ago the preachers in this message blasted the TV they call it the H Vision remember that the oneeyed devil how many remember that and many of us agree with that never have a TV in your home and we blasted that and the preachers blasted that and we agree with it and then like either they were wrong and Blasting it or they were right and what we're doing today is wrong I want you to look think about that just for a minute if it was wrong 30 years ago for a message Pastor let's put it in the pastor realm to sit up and watch a TV television movies on Saturday Friday whatever and you knew that would you have confidence him in him as a message Pastor 30 years ago think about it so if it was wrong then I'm just raising the point if it was wrong then wouldn't it be wrong today or or maybe they was wrong to blast the TV quick quick little testimony to Quick short quick one I'll close here I got to close I remember when I got saved first got saved in the Pentecostal Church me and my sister Kimberly had a room together we're both young people serving the lord little Pentecostal church and I was trying to receive the Holy Ghost she at at her baptism came out of the water speaking in tongues filled with the Holy Ghost and I thought man what's going on i' been searching searching trying to let the Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost anyways we had a room together I just bought a TV it had the remote it was Black TV really nice it was sharp and I just bought it and we would watch that and I forget it had 20 25 channels or whatever and I heard about some Pentecostals that were against the TV or watching it and this is a denomination and I thought huh it's not that bad our my pastor had one our Bishop had a TV it was just like be careful what you watch that kind of thing you know don't let it use you so I remember one afternoon it started to just bother me in my mind so every all the young people I knew all the church that I knew everyone had one it was okay but it started to bother me like maybe this is wrong so I I went to the Lord in prayer I said Lord if you want me to get rid of the TV I will but but I can't see where it's really wrong and so one afternoon I said well I'm going give this thing a try I said well Lord I I'll pray and I'll give the TV a chance it was about midday and so I'm g go through every one of these channels in the name of Jesus Christ and if it's glorifying God or not then I'll make my decision whether I should keep this thing or not so I sat down on my couch one afternoon and I went through every one of those 25 30 channels and every one of them it was just foolishness you know advertising foolishness nonsense nothing about God a couple of religious channels I was like why do I have this I'm trying to you know then I was trying to speak in tongues for the Holy Ghost I was like I I don't need this so the Lord convicted my heart to get rid of it so my sister came home she's like what's going on I said I'm getting R into the TV she's like come on Israel you don't have to do all that well I already made up my mind it was my TV I have to get rid of it and so I sold it to kind of not a friend but a guy that I kind of knew and a month later it blew up anyways and I didn't give his money back either a deal is a deal so but that was the inner conflict that I had that was my own I had to come to that through prayer I gave it a chance it didn't pass a test for what I was trying to achieve in my life that's between me and God and so is the way you handle and use whatever you would look at that's between you and God but I want you to process that thought if it was wrong 30 or 40 years ago the TV and we used to blast it then maybe it's wrong today too and it's the TV on steroids today but you could take that same TV and use it to magnify the name of the Lord then I can see the use for it amen amen so give no place to the devil let's have the musicians come I'm trying to get my faith right you know you'll be working out with your faith I still remember the galante their two boys Joseph what was the other boy's name Daniel when when I just was coming to Phoenix visiting years ago way before I was married I stayed with them and they were so they they had a Neighbor Next Door that had weights and oh go over there brother Israel how much could you live and I I lifted all those weights and they were all just always with brag about the weights and I used to work out with weights and I told you all that I'm back in the gym on the weights uh of Faith the spiritual things and I remember working out when you're working out and you have a program you know your legs and those of you that work out know this is true as you're working out you're actually getting stronger but you don't know how strong you're getting so when you go to do your maximums you get on the bench and this was never clear the last time I did my Maxes the gentleman kept putting more weight on and I was surprised on how strong I was see because strength is it's not a number based upon what you desire what you want to be but if you were working out and you were putting the time in your muscle will will manifest that your body will manifest what you have been doing in the gym if you've been practicing working out it'll just come out and you will surprise yourself you don't know how strong you are and so you get start getting into these things of the word and your faith muscles will grow and grow and grow and when the enemy comes he's given you the victory already in his word and you just take that word and you just over come the Devil by faith but we can't do that with the other garbage too amen so let's take our prayer requests
