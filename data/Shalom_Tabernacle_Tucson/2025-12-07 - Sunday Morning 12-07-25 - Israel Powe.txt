========================================

and good morning everyone. Can we all stand? I'll open up in a word of prayer for the adult Sunday school class. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to be here this morning, Father. Lord, just to hear preaching of your word, Father, it brings us more clarity, Lord, as your scripture has said that this day loose ends would be Lord worked out. Father, mysteries would be revealed. And Lord, we're thankful that Lord, we can hear the things that we're about to hear this morning. Be with everyone, the children in their class. May your hand of mercy and grace just touch their lives, Lord, that they would grow strong in grace and in you, Lord. Everyone that may be on the way and everything that would be said and done in this church this day, we pray, Father, that you'd pour your Holy Ghost out upon us. Lord, help us to see you more clearly and we'll give you all the praise and the glory for it in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. We're going to be listening to what is the Holy Ghost given for. We'll start at paragraph 14. There'll be a scripture reading there. So, we'll remain standing until that's uh finished. This will be about 21 minutes long. Let us sing only believe. Only believe. Only believe all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Now you that's keeping these scriptures down, if you would turn with me to St. John again, the 14th chapter. We want to begin at the 14th chapter of St. John and let's start about the 14th verse. St. John 14:14 and just read a portion of this scripture. Now, in this you will find much of the context that I want to speak on tonight. And remember you that have the red letter Bibles, it's in red. This is it's the words that Jesus himself spoke of. So therefore, we can rest assure that it will be just as he has said, heavens and earth will pass away, but his word shall never fail. Now we shall read from the 14th verse of the 14th chapter. If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it. What a blessed promise. If you love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him God. Now you that would be reading from a Greek Bible would see it in your not see there means to understand for the world understandeth him not that is so true. Let me read it again now. Even the spirit of tr who the truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him who the comfortermen for he dwelleth with you. Now present tense he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. What is it? The same comforter. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I Anyone knows that I is a personal pronoun? I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more. But ye shall But ye see me, because I live, ye shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. There's going to be the center of my thought, but we're going to read a little farther. Let me read that also. Now again, at that day, the great day, the judgment day, that day ye shall know that I am in the father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that has my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Judas said unto him, not is a carrot, Lord, how is it that thou will manifest thyself to us and not to the world? That's cosmos, the world order. If you got a margin reading there, you'll notice mine's a G. And it says over here, cosmos are world system. That's churches and so forth. How is it that you'll manifest yourself to us and not to them? How can you do it? Jesus answered and said unto him, if a man love me, he will keep my words. &gt;&gt; Amen. and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings. You might keep the church's sayings, but keep his sayings. disease. &gt;&gt; And the words which ye hear is not mine, but the Father which sent me. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all these things, that's his words, to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. &gt;&gt; What purpose did God send the Holy Spirit? Amen. &gt;&gt; May he add his blessings to his word. Jesus said that at that day you'll know that I am in the father and the father is in me and you're I am in you and you are in me. Now, if we were going to say this, now remember this is going to be on tape. uh Christian businessman out of Louisville called me a while ago and he said, "It's a shame, Billy, that these messages, like you said last night, doesn't get to 40,000 here instead of 150 or 200, 300 people at your little tabernacle." I said, "Sir, in six months from now, Jesus carries the whole world around will hear this." Yeah, &gt;&gt; them tapes go all over the world, &gt;&gt; all around. And therefore, we are teaching here now just what we believe to be truth and what we have found out that God has confirmed it to us to be truth. Now the purpose, what was what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Spirit. Now I mark that down. John 14 beginning at the 14th verse and reading through the chapter for the basis. God's purpose we find here in sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church. Now, we know what the Holy Spirit is. We found out last night that it's God. Now, when we think of God the Father as Jesus spoke of here, his father, God the Son as Jesus, God the Holy Spirit as what we call it today. Now that does not mean that there is three individual distinct gods. It means that there is one God in three offices. May we say it like this. All that God was, he poured into Christ because he emptied himself and poured it into Christ. And Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that Jehovah was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not into one individual, but into the entire body. There we come together in unity. We have power. All that God was was in Christ, and all that Christ was is in you. For God was made flesh and dwelt among us. 1 Timothy 3:16. If you're putting it down without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness, for God was manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; We handle him. God Jehovah made flesh and walked on the earth and we saw him with our eyes. You know in the same chapter of John 14, Philip said, "Lord, show us the father and it will satisfy us." Jesus said, "I've been so long with you, Philillip, and you don't know me." &gt;&gt; When you have seen me, you have seen the father. &gt;&gt; And why sayest thou unto me, "Show us the father." God was made flesh. Now, here it is. The Father was God over you. We're saying we've been since Adam. God the Father was over Moses and the children of Israel in a pillar of fire. Then God with us in Christ walk with us, talk with us, eat with us, slept with us. God over us, God with us, and now &gt;&gt; God in us. &gt;&gt; All God was coming to Christ, all Christ was coming into the church. &gt;&gt; What is it? God working in you. anywhere in the world and he'd want to call on you, you're right there working in you to do his good will. How we are to thank God for that. God, the Holy Spirit is sent for the purpose of God living in his church, moving through each age, working out his divine will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When man makes fun of you, they're not making fun of you. They're making fun of him that sent you. So Jesus said, "Blessed are ye when man shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake. Blessed are you." And again, all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions. For when God made himself known in Christ, they hated him. Who hated him worse? the church. &gt;&gt; The church hated him worse. They hated him worse than the the drunkard. They hated him worse than all the other people. It was the church that hated him. So therefore, when you see cosmos, the world or the world know him not means the church socalled knew him not. He came to his own and his own received him not. But as many as did receive him, to them gave he the power to become sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To them that believed on his name. Oh, how we should love him and worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. the purpose of God wanting to become in fellowship like before we leave that text let's use this in the days of Ruth in the law of redemption when Naom had left the country because of trial hard times she went into the Moanite land which were just lukewarm nominal Christians because the Moanites come from the daughter of Lot and they were so-called believers and mixed up and then her husband died and her two sons died and on the road home Noma Ruth and Neoma on her wrote home her one of her daughter-in-laws, Ora. She said that she would return back to her country, to her gods, and to her church, and to her people. And Noma tried to get uh Ruth to go back, but she said, "Your people are my people. Your God is my God. &gt;&gt; Where you die there, I'll die. Before you're buried there, I'll be buried &gt;&gt; and I'll not turn back. &gt;&gt; That's when a person's caught a vision. &gt;&gt; Don't make any difference whatever. People said, "You're going over there to become a holy roller or something." That didn't make any difference to Ruth. &gt;&gt; That was a purpose of God to be fulfilled. And just as sure as you're hungering tonight for the Holy Spirit, it's something in you pulling you that a purpose of God in your life has got to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Just like it was with Ruth. The story so beautiful. I just can't leave it for a moment. You know the law of redemption that when Boaz, you know the story of how Ruth gleaned in the field and found favor with Boaz and before he could marry her, he had to redeem all that Naom had lost. And the only one that could redeem Nom's fallen estate in the law of redemption was a near kinsman. Had to be kin folks before he could redeem. And that was her closest kin folks. and he had to make a public insign outside of the gate or a public confession that he had redeemed all that Neoma had lost. And Boaz did it by kicking off his shoe before the elders and said, "There's anybody here that's got anything that belongs to the I HAVE REDEEMED IT." And that's the way God did follow his own laws. God cannot follow give you one law to follow and him follow another. &gt;&gt; He follows his own laws. and God in order to redeem the lost church, &gt;&gt; the lost world, the lost creation, GOD WHO IS INFINITE IN spirit &gt;&gt; to redeem the lost human race, &gt;&gt; God himself become kin, folks, &gt;&gt; a man, &gt;&gt; a son that he created in the womb of Mary and THEN HE MADE AN IN sign or a testimony outside the gates of Jerusalem. He was lifted up between the heavens AND EARTH AND DIED AND REDEEMED EVERYTHING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And in bleeding, he sanctified a church that he himself might live in and fellowship and commune with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That lost spot of fellowship from the Garden of Eden where God came down every evening, church time. Did you notice God came down in the cool of the day, the setting of the sun? There's something about when it starts to get night, people think of church and of God. Christians, you see the sun setting, you realize it's your sun is setting. And in the cool of evening, he come down and commune with them. And there he lost that fellowship because sin would not let him do it. And then he was made flesh and dwelt among us in order that he could come back again to man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And live in man AND RESTORE MAN TO A STATE OF COMMUNION WITH HIM AGAIN AND GIVE HIM BACK HIS GODGIVEN RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. That's the purpose of the Holy Ghost. It's the Father again. God the Father dwelling in you, working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption, working through you, making you a coworker with him, giving you a place, GIVING YOU A PART FOR YOUR FALLEN LOST BROTHER AND SISTER. GIVING YOU HIS SPIRIT AND his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of Eden. Adam, Adam, where art thou? That's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman. When it strikes into their heart and takes it bold, THERE'S A THIRST AND A HUNGRY for soft souls. &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter with the meetings today. There's not enough spirit touch in it. go for the souls of the lost &gt;&gt; and the dying. &gt;&gt; It's more to make a name or a church or a building or denomination instead of a soulwinning program. How pitiful. We just stay on it much. God poured himself into Christ. Correct. Hallelujah. Get away. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. to me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah.

I needed someone to wash my sins away. And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing grace all the day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. He paid a debt on Calvary.

I bless your name. I was sitting alone and wondering about what I'm supposed to do. I can't deny the times I've made mistakes. I can't hide from him. He knew. But I knew that deep within my soul I felt sorry. Honest I do. So I just cried and said forgive me Lord forgive me again. Will you? Oh justify. Oh justified. I never did it in the first place. Justified. Justified. Oh, justified. Never did it in the first place. Or justified. So often I am discouraged when I count the times I fall. Cuz he promised I'd be victorious when I know I'm not at all. Then I heard an eagle scream. His voice quickened my soul. You said you never did it in the first place. You're justified. You are justified. You're justified. You never did it in the first place. You're justified. You're justified. You are justified. Let's stand as we sing the last verse as the brothers come for the offering. Never did it in the first place. You're justified. He looked at your perfect picture. Well, he looked at your perfect picture without blame, spot, or wrinkle. He didn't look at you from where you are now. He looked from eternity. He said, "You're just trapped in that body. You by past your theophony. You never did it in the first place. You're justified. Yes, you're justified. You are justified. You never did it in the first place. You're justified. You're justified. You're justified. You never did it in the first place. You're justified. Amen. Aren't you thankful for that this morning? And God bless you, saints. Good to be in church with each one this morning. For Sunday school, we had 11 children, nine Bibles, $6 in offering. So, we're thankful for that this morning. Thankful to have the Baggots and Brother Judah kind of filling in some seats or a row, an entire row for us this morning. We're missing some. So we certainly want to be in prayer for those missing. Also Matt and CJ helping finish out the King aisle there. So sure love and appreciate them this morning. So remember those not able to be with us or some children and camp and things. Also our precious sister Ellie Troutman is not feeling well this morning. So I want to remember her or elders and maybe you've got something on your heart. Brother John was singing earlier. Lord help me this morning. So just bring that before our prayer answering God together. Dear Lord, we're very thankful and happy to be in the house of the Lord today with like-minded believers, Lord, that believe every word of the prophet has spoken. And so, Lord, may we not just be hearers only, but doers of this great Bible. We know we will make mistakes, Lord, each and every day. We just cry out for the blood of Jesus, Lord, that we could be justified, though, as we never did it in the first place. My my Lord, so thankful. Thankful brother for Israel, Sister Sharon, and the Po family, Lord, and their talents and their burden for the loss this morning. And we share that burden, Lord, and and just hold them up. We know that brother Israel, Lord, you will be speaking, Lord, to us. May our hearts and our ears be open. And we cry out, Lord, for our loved ones, those that are still maybe wandering or unsure or doubtful. Lord, drive away that doubt. comfort, Lord, the feeblehearted, Lord, and those that are seeking, Lord, you said that they would be able to find you. And so, we pray that and just hold out our loved ones and and that last one that might come in, Lord, here this very day. We're looking for a looking for a rapture, Lord, looking for the saints to arise at any moment. Just cry out that you would come and we could overcome, Lord, by our testimony, the word of the Lord, and by the blood of the lamb this morning. Thank you for brother John the worship Lord. We commit it all the offering the ties to your mighty kingdom. In the name of our Lord and Savior, the precious Lord Jesus Christ. All God's people say amen. God Almighty. He's the prince of peace. Trles manage hearts unended. It's the presence of the king. Amen. You can be seated. Brother Joe welcomed Judah this morning. This is Judah Dodd visiting with us this morning and uh told he has a song. So, brother Judah, you playing for your yourself this morning? Yes. So, maybe we could just uh sing that chorus we were just singing. We can sing it ac capella if you start me out in the in the right notes, Sister Sharon. But just was thinking of the words of that song. In his presence, troubles vanish. Hearts are mended when we're in the presence of the king. And you know, we sometimes get sidetracked and we focus on how big our problem is instead of how big our God is. And this isn't just his presence hopefully when we get together, but I want to live continuously in his presence. And let's just try to block everything out as we sing there. Just shut your eyes and just don't think about the problems that we don't have because we don't have any. So he said, "Cast all of your cares unto me. I care about you." So if we truly do that, let go. Let God have them. Our troubles troubles will vanish. Hearts will be mended. in the presence of Jehovah God Almighty. You're my praise, my praise. Peace. from those manage hearts are binding in the presence of the You're Praise the tres. When I think of how he came so far from glory. He came to dwell among the lonely such as I to suffer shame and such disgrace on Mount Calary. Take my place. Then I ask myself this question. Who am I? Who am I that the king would bleed and die for? Who am I that he would pray? Not my will thine, Lord. The answer I may never know. know why he'd ever love me so. When I owe to an old rugged cross, he would go for who am I? When I'm reminded of his words, I'll leave you never. If you be true, I'll give to you a life forever and forever. I wonder what I could have done. To deserve God's only son. He'd fight my battles until they're won. For who am I? Sing it with me if you know it. Who am I that the king would bleed and die? And who am I that he would pray? Not my will. Thine, Lord. The answer I may never know. Why he ever loved me so that to an old rugged cross he'd go for who am I? Oh, who am I that the king would bleed and die for? Where am I that ye would pray? Not my will th answer I may never know. Why he ever loved me so that to an old rugged cross he'd go for who am I? That to an old rugged cross he go for who am I? Amen. You can remain seated. It need to welcome Sister Po back. We sure missed her when she was gone. Appreciate all she does here. Amen. Maybe we could just as we change the order of the service sing that hymn together. Have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. Thou art the potter. I am the clay. Have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. Thou art the potter. I am the clay. Mold me and make me after thy will. I am waiting yielded and still the last verse. Have thine own way, Lord. Yes. Have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. Just hold on my be absolute sway. How many can say this is your desire this morning? Fill with thy spirit till all shall see. Christy, always living in me. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. God bless you. Let us let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessings on this service this morning, Lord, as we take your word and uh Lord, go into it. May you minister to our hearts what we have need of. Lord, I pray that you'll touch us, Lord. Father, move away all the unbelief and the cares of life and let us come into your presence, Lord, and the presence of the word. Bless us, Father, as we commit our ways to you and these folks that have gathered in your name. May they each one receive their portion, Lord. And may it be said when they leave from here, it was good for us to be in the house of the Lord. Oh God, bless the saints in Mesa this morning for the art of the Stevie and the faithful few there. We just commit all in your in your hands in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. So good to be in house of the Lord with you this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Trying to find out what kind of service this is going to be. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Welcome. It's good to see the Baggots and then the brother and the Bowmans some of his family there. God bless them and each of you. We like to go right into the word and so happy to have sister Sharon back with us. Amen. And so um we'll have you stand to your feet and all those that were traveling that are have returned. We thank the Lord for you. Amen. In the scripture in Revelations chapter 3 verse number seven, the scripture says this here. And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia, write these things saith, he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shutth, and shutth and no man openeth. I know thy works. Behold, I have set before thee an open door. I have set before thee an open door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And no man can shut it. Amen. &gt;&gt; For thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and has not denied my name. &gt;&gt; Behold, I would make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie. Behold, I would make them come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth. Amen. We'll take one more scripture. 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. Certain I won't be able to finish the entire message today but we'll do the best we can. 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 number 1 to3. Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that you, ye, be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed, the son of predition. Amen. We're going to take a few moments and I'll give this message a title. Um, the greatest of all revelations. The greatest of all revelations. And as you're standing, I'll read a quotation of the prophet here in the Patmas vision. And he says this here. I think I have it. Paragraph 132. The greatest of all revelations is the deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. Who can't you can't get to first race until you believe that. That's what Peter said. Repent and then see the deity. We baptize in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. And then you're ready to go in the spirit. The first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ. I am Alpha and Omega. I am from A to Z. There's no more but me. I was at the beginning. I'll be at the end. I'm he that was, which is, and shall come. the Almighty. Think of it. That's what the trumpet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; And in the presence of the Lord. Now, this um great falling away that we know the scriptures has prophesied for it to come. And I kind of uh apologize for some of the saints in Mesa because a lot of this is a repeat from Thursday night. But I did just felt really impressed to bring that again to the church this morning on the greatest of all revelations and this great falling away that we see happening. The scripture said it would come and we see it taking place right before our eyes. And what is the falling away? um who's the cause of the falling away and what are they falling away from? What is the falling away? Who's the cause of it? And what actually are they falling away from? Now, Brother Brandham takes the message the angel of the Lord 1951 and he says this here and as atheistism is on the march and so forth and the churches are falling away and getting formal. Let me say this to you my dear brother and sister. If you receive me as your brother, we need a revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what I like to do, and I mentioned this on Wednesday, you know, I have something on my heart, something I think about, uh, a thought. I like to go and see what the prophet says about it. I like to see what the Bible says about it. And that's where I get my opinions from. Hopefully, I trust the Lord that all my opinions come from his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, as I was looking at this falling away, I have a thought. The internet has a thought. Everybody has a thought. But God has a thought too. &gt;&gt; And God has spoken to us in this day. And why search running around trying to find an answer when God has given us the greatest? He's given us the answer &gt;&gt; when he gave us his word. &gt;&gt; So I go through the message and I see what this falling away is. And here uh in 1951, brother Random is talking about this falling away. And he gets into how it's falling away from the spirit. You're getting formal. He says, he moves forward in the message 1952 and he says this here, paragraph number 14, make the valley full of ditches. The hour has come for falling away of the church. The hour has come that religion would spread the world without salvation. form of godliness denying the power thereof. The hour has come. The hour has come for your church to rise. &gt;&gt; This hour has to come for uh raise out of the dust and shake herself and come to herself and realize positionally that she is a church of the living God and has rights over every every redemptive blessing that you promise to her. They're hers tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, the hour has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here the prophet continues in 1954, the mark of the beast. And he says this, Paul said that that day should not come unless there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed. Now watch. He declares him to be a man. Is that right? Paul said he was the man of sin who opposes himself all above all that's called God. So he that he so so he that is worshiped as God a man worshiped as God a man that would be put here as a form of worship. And he said that day could not come except first there come a falling away. What is it a lukewarm condition of the church? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I like us to really internalize the quotations. And sometimes we think of the church, we think of the church, all of the believers. But I want you to look at the church as yourself. And when he's talking about a falling away from a lukew from into a lukewarm condition, you have to ask yourself the question, am I falling away into a lukewarm condition? Me personally, because that's really the only part that matters is how it affects me personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it? A lukewarm condition of the church. All right. How many you know this age was prophesied to fall into a lukewarm condition? &gt;&gt; Lukewarm so much God so much not just a lukewarm not hot not cold but just like a a lukewarm condition and it actually makes God sick. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. The handwriting on the wall. The prophet of God says this here in 1958. No wonder there's a falling away. And what does the pastors know? They don't know what the cause of it. They are the cause of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's the cause of it? &gt;&gt; The prophet said that. Now, &gt;&gt; so there's a reason why there's a falling away. &gt;&gt; The Bible said there would be a falling away. The scripture shows us that they're falling away from the word, from Christ. We know Christ is the word. They fall away from the Holy Spirit. But there's a reason why people fall away. And that falling away, the prophet tells us the pastors are the cause of it. Prophet continues in the message, discerning the body of the Lord, and he says this here. Amen. Let's uh move from that one. We'll take this next one here. The testimony of a true witness 1961 paragraph 224. The messenger says this here. Now being that he said that we are his witnesses. Amen. In closing, listen close. Put on your understanding now and listen as I close. We are his witnesses who have received of his spirit. His word testifies in the last days that there will come a falling away and there will come up a cold formal powerless church age. That's what we're living in. A church that had no power. &gt;&gt; Having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away. He gave the sign that there would be times when a man would sit in the temple of God showing himself he was God. He come ruling the nation. How perfectly all these things. So we see there's the the prophecy of 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 that there would come this great falling away and that the man of sin would would reveal himself. The scripture calls him a man. But the warning was, brethren, don't be soon shaken. Don't be bothered by it. Don't worry. It's going to happen. But take your stand with the word of the Lord. Anyways, he says that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled, neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter. Brother um Edward Mcfatin sent a text to the uh to the group to the to the board text one that I I love and I don't have it in front of me but I see I do and um but brother Bham in that quote is talking about it's in the church age book and he's talking about how nervousness would um now h have a place in um I won't take time to get it but he identifies that this age will be a nervous age and he identifies that you know the the the hour that you and I are living in and if there ever was a time that people are more shaky more unstable than ever before we see it &gt;&gt; we see people that we have put a lot of confidence in unright lightly, but we've done it. And they have shaken and they've fallen away. And when we see that, it hurts our faith in the entire process. We say, "How could he? How could she is standing so firm and they fall into this?" Well, the problem is when you get your eyes on men or people or groups, they will always disappoint you. There is no perfect group of people that are not going to disappoint you. &gt;&gt; Starting with looking in the mirror. &gt;&gt; You look in the mirror, you will disappoint yourself. &gt;&gt; And everybody around you will disappoint you in groups and churches and people that should be stable. People you should be able to depend on. They're being shaken on every on every hand. But the scripture tells us to not to be so soon shaken in mind. Don't worry about what text or email comes by letter. Don't worry about what the internet or what the groups are doing and what everybody else is doing because the man of sin must be revealed. &gt;&gt; And I'm warning you of what that is. And here the prophet now shows us that it's a falling away into a lukewarm condition. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a lazy age or lazy spirit, it's this age here. can't pray like we should. Won't dig down deep like we should. We want everything given to us without any work, without any toil, without any suffering. But this is not a gimmick. This is not a prize that you win. This is not a lottery. This is not gambling. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose and a plan for your life. &gt;&gt; There is no golden ticket. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO GOLDEN SERVICE. THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD BY HIS GRACE, &gt;&gt; he builds you, &gt;&gt; HE BUILDS YOU &gt;&gt; FROM ONE SEED AT A TIME. &gt;&gt; ONE LITTLE SEED DROPS INTO THE GROUND AND THAT SEED BEGINS TO GROW AND IT BEGINS TO PUT ON BARK AND PUT ON LEAVES AND PUT ON ALL OF THE FRUITS. IT'S GOD'S PURPOSE. IT'S HOW HE DOES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S A MASTER BUILDER. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN'T MAKE GOD RUSH. &gt;&gt; You can't make God move. &gt;&gt; He has a time. &gt;&gt; HE HAS A PLAN. HE HAS A PROCESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We were in this message here. I was listening to this message in um um I think it was surges at the time and the prophet was talking about that he's never produced uh um he he said he he's never um he wasn't into the gimmicks. He said, "I've not produced to you a gimmick." &gt;&gt; And he makes this statement here. Let's see if I can find it. I got to get it. And sir, is this the time? He says this here. Let's see if I can. Is this the end of time, sir? Lord, help me. I just failed to read this one for you. Um, oh my. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Take my time." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, whoever said that. I need a break up here, sir. All right. I can't get it. But he he said he he he never produced to the world a gimmick. He says, "Many of you have come to me with dreams and the Lord has um has revealed them." And then he says, "Many of you have come to me with dreams and visions and the Lord has never showed it to me." And I thought that really stood out very nicely that not every single dream, not every single trouble or problem we have has an answer to it. &gt;&gt; There is there is what God has for us. I have to read that for you because it's in my mind to read it for you. So let me get it for you. All right. &gt;&gt; 72 &gt;&gt; 72. You guys have it. They have it. Paragraph 72. Thank you. Paragraph 71. We'll start up there. Thank you, brother. And now I do not believe that there's anything he has spoken all these years my life that I've spoke to the people, but what come to pass? And many people has come to me with dreams that he's let me by his grace interpret for the people. And many has come with dreams and with problems that I was unable to interpret. But I haven't tried to introduce to a people a gimmick that has all the answers. I've tried to be honest and to tell you what was truth. And I can only tell you as he told me then as it come to me then I could tell you. That was so beautiful to see that even the prophet of God's ministry, there were people that came to him with dreams, with problems, and he couldn't give them the answer because he would have to receive that answer, that interpretation, and then give it to the people. &gt;&gt; And my mind went to Sister Edith, right? We all know Hattie, right? Sister Hadtie received that great power of the third pool manifested in her in her little home there. &gt;&gt; A tremendous example. But and when that power came down, Brother Vanov says, "Oh, just any moment now, Edith will be walking." And so I just start to look at sister Edith's little testimony there. And I used to have an article. Someone gave it to me. I can't remember but it was sister Hattie Wright had moer testimony about brother Brandham and maybe it's in the generations book or I had it and she was talking about her sister Edith how she could thread a needle with with a button with she use her little tongue and just do it so fast so quick. How many's ever heard that something? &gt;&gt; Yeah. How many's heard that besides Jonathan? No one's heard that. I maybe I'll get it some other time. Anyways, they were they were friends with the with the Brandham. Brother Brandham was friends with their family and she they are one of the oldest families that were in brother Brandham's ministry 25 plus years in with him. They're mentioned on the very first tape in the message. Brother Banner mentions the rights um from from faith is the substance and all the way through their ministry he says them and the slaughters are some of the oldest one. He says that sister Edith would be in in pain and she was crippled up. Her arms are twisted. She's in this wheelchair. He says we prayed for her and the Lord took the pain away but never healed her. And he goes on further and says I pray for many people far worse than her. And in fact, right in her own home, Brother Wright was dying with cancer. He was on his last stage dying. Brother Brandham said he prayed for four days and the Lord gave him a vision and the Lord healed brother Wright and s sister Sister Edith sat right there. &gt;&gt; And here's Sister Edith all these years until he mentions her birthday a number of times on tape. I think she passed in 196 something. I forget what it was, but he mentions it on tape that she's gone on. She she had passed and she sat in that wheelchair for all of her life. And there's quotes where brother Adam says, "We always looking for God to heal her." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he had no answer why she wasn't healed. &gt;&gt; Now, is God a healer? &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, was she in contact with somebody who knew healing? &gt;&gt; Was she a part of a MINISTRY THAT DISPLAYED HEALING IN A great manifestation? &gt;&gt; The third pull came down in her home. &gt;&gt; AND YET, SHE SAT IN THAT WHEELCHAIR. &gt;&gt; Because this is not a gimmick. &gt;&gt; This is NOT AN ANSWER TO EVERYBODY'S QUESTION. &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T OPERATE THAT WAY. WHAT HE DOES, HE GIVES YOU HIS WORD &gt;&gt; AND YOU KEEP HIS WORD AND THEN HE keeps you. &gt;&gt; Now what was this word? The scripture calls it the word of his patience. And he the scripture tells us that you have kept the word of my patience and I will keep you in this hour of tribulation. Now, as we shared with you last couple of times on the the purpose or the reason why God gives us these mysteries, Revelations 10:7 that the angel would come and reveal those mysteries. And the mysteries are are what opens up to us. It's wisdom. It's the revelation of who God is. Upon this upon this rock, I'll build my church. He builds you by a revelation, not by education, not by intellects, but by a revelation, by something supernatural. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it all. &gt;&gt; This is not made to argue in the great halls of Congress and prove that God is true. &gt;&gt; No, but you can prove that he's true in your own life. &gt;&gt; He made himself known to you &gt;&gt; personally. Can I get a witness? Amen. &gt;&gt; And every believer is built that way. &gt;&gt; He's built on a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not education or intellect. &gt;&gt; It is a individual. When you come to worship the Lord, it is a individual praise. &gt;&gt; Individual worship. &gt;&gt; A INDIVIDUAL THANK YOU JESUS. &gt;&gt; HE CHANGED MY LIFE. I CAN never be the same again. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do who's sitting next to ME OR WHO'S BEHIND me or who SAID WHAT. BUT GOD GOT A HOLD OF MY LIFE AND I CAN NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's real. It's real. &gt;&gt; IT'S REAL TO THE BELIEVER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not something we're arguing. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to prove it to anybody. &gt;&gt; GOD MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO ME. &gt;&gt; I can never be the same again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's individual like that. and he he opens up his word to us through revelation. Now, brother Bandham takes this open door as you read this Philadelphiaian church age and he gives us the time frame that it was open and this was in paragraph 236 and the Philadelphiaian church age. This is what he says. Now this great temptation, the hour of temptation that shall come to try the whole world goes into tribulation. Just in a few minutes we'll see it goes on into the tribulation. The tribulation did not come in the days of Wesley. So what age are we in? What's the door set before? It's between the Wesleyan and where the church is headed right now and already in to the Leodysian age. But this little place right in here within the last 35, 40 years has been an open door setting right before the people to come in and God will take a remnant and seal it off and they'll go on into a lukewarm and he'll spew them out of his mouth. The work will be cut short. Up goes the church. Here comes the antichrist moving in for destruction. Just perfect. Fits with the whole Bible on around. All right. Paragraph 119. Same message. He says, "Open door." What is it? It's the revelation of the supreme deity, Christ, not being a second person of the Trinity, but being God himself made flesh and dwelt among us. The first time the name's been spoke of now since back in this age back here lost the name. Luther come out with the name that was alive and was dead. That's right. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Here comes out the name of Jesus again in between these two ages in between the open door. Now it's a revelation what he was the deity. &gt;&gt; The revelations of his deity. Can you say praise the Lord? Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, brother Random now identifies this age. He said the past 35 to 40 years. That was in 1960. So, that's going back to 1930s and early late 1920s and 1930s that this open door. This is Revelations 3 that we read. The Lord said, "I have set before you &gt;&gt; an open door." Not somebody, not the church, not somebody else. The Lord says, "I have set before you an open door." &gt;&gt; And this open door was in a specific period of time. And what was it? It was a revelation of the deity of Christ, water baptism, the name of Jesus being restored back to the church. And now those that keep the word of my patience, I will keep you during the hour of tribulation. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many know it's the word that actually is protecting you? &gt;&gt; You think it's you and your nice driving skills that's protecting you out in these old crazy streets out here. What's going on in the mall and wherever you're going that it's you being so aware that's keeping you? No. No. It's the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's the angels of God. &gt;&gt; If he just takes his hand off of you, you will fall. you will fail. &gt;&gt; But his word keeps us. &gt;&gt; His word protects us. &gt;&gt; He's the reason why we are here today. &gt;&gt; If you can even know the name of Jesus, it's because he has revealed that to you. &gt;&gt; It's not in our own strength. &gt;&gt; It's not in our own power. &gt;&gt; But this open door, the revelation of who Jesus is. Now Jesus, who is Jesus? Has any of us seen Jesus face to face in his flesh? &gt;&gt; Have we shook his hand? Do we know what really what he looks like in his stature? No. No. We The only revelation we know of Jesus is Jesus according to his word. &gt;&gt; That's who he is. Jesus is the word. &gt;&gt; And what word is he? He's the word for the day that you live in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet of God continues on and he says this, talking about this open door just a little bit further and 1965. Well, let's take Christ the mystery of God revealed first. 1963, paragraph 303. Don't you love the Lord? He says, "God is known by simplicity and of the revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person." See, not your theology. It's a revelation of Jesus Christ. Upon this rock, I'll build my church. No other rocks accept it. No other things accept it. nor the Roman rock, nor the Protestant rock, no other school, no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth. He borns in there. He injects his own life and your life is gone. And the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with preeminences &gt;&gt; to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you. Outside of that, the rest of it is not even called to at all. &gt;&gt; Watch God's great revelation unfolding. Amen. &gt;&gt; By lack of this revelation &gt;&gt; is why see the reason &gt;&gt; is why we have so many different divisions among us &gt;&gt; and so much mockery &gt;&gt; so much division among us is because the people lack the youth meetings &gt;&gt; weeny roast get together for fried chicken. &gt;&gt; Because the people last lack a basketball team to keep the youth together. &gt;&gt; They lack a team of of we need more people. We need more people in the church. That's why our youth are struggling. No. The reason the struggle is people lack the revelation. &gt;&gt; See, they lack the revelation. &gt;&gt; The teachers. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He's nailing the pastors today and the teachers. &gt;&gt; Said the pastors are the reason for it. &gt;&gt; The teachers they lack it. Let me read it again without any comments. Paragraph 304. By lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much markering so much division among us is because the people lack that revelation. &gt;&gt; See they lack that revelation. The teachers So, I have to internalize these quotations. I have to say that brother Brandham actually is telling me this. I'm not going to hold your hand with me and say, "Let's all say amen together." I'm not going to grab my Bible and say, "Let's all in a group agree at one time." No. No. No. Are you serious? &gt;&gt; No. No. No. No. Every individual, man, woman, boy, girl that's a believer has to have a revelation on the greatest of all revelations. &gt;&gt; It's the supreme deity of our Lord. &gt;&gt; When he's speaking, you'll know it's him that's speaking. &gt;&gt; What does this revelation do for you? IF YOU GOT IT in this age, you'll have it in any other age. In the days of Moses, you would have had it. IN THE DAYS OF NOAH, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD IT. IN ANY OTHER AGE, ANYWHERE THROUGHOUT YOUR BIBLE, you put you in that age, you would catch that revelation. &gt;&gt; Not everybody couldn't see who Noah was. &gt;&gt; Everybody didn't see who Moses was &gt;&gt; or Elijah or Daniel. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOT EVERYBODY SAW IT, BUT THE TRUE BELIEVER THAT HAD THE REVELATION OF THAT IT'S GOD THAT'S DOING THE SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It settles it for the believer. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; Now, here what the prophet of God says here &gt;&gt; in this message um paragraph 160. It's in the message spiritual food in due season. Now God has promised us these things in the last days in Malachi 4 said that Jesus Christ would come down and impersonate himself in human flesh &gt;&gt; like he did at Sodom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And said the world would be in a Sodom condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "As it was then, the son of man will be revealed that day." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; See this man that come down in the form of a man which was Elohim &gt;&gt; by Abraham before this promised son came. Look what it was. &gt;&gt; Abraham said it was God. &gt;&gt; Bible said there was three men come to him dust on their clothes, travel, sat down and eat like a man. Skip down to paragraph one 61. Now mark that with the last prophet said behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he will restore the hearts of the children back to the father. So here brother Random is taking Genesis 18 and he's typing it and he's bringing the the connection with this uh this man this being that came to Abraham. Remember the angel that came to Abraham, there was three of them, but the one, the Lord himself, revealed the secrets that was in the hearts of Sarah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the tent behind him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've seen that in our day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the prophet is now taking what Abraham, what happened with Abraham and Sarah, and now he's bringing now mark that with the last day prophet. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Now it's not what am I saying? It's not what are you thinking? is what is brother Brandham saying? &gt;&gt; What is THE TAPE SAYING? &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PROPHET SAYING? &gt;&gt; And I thank the Lord. I thank the Lord that the message is recorded &gt;&gt; so I can go listen to it and say amen to it. &gt;&gt; All by myself if I HAVE TO, &gt;&gt; ALL ALONE IF I HAVE TO. BUT I'M GLAD IT'S BEEN RECORDED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. the hearts. Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet. He'll restore the hearts of the children back to the fathers. See a message to bring them back to the Bible. And the son of man will be revealing himself in that day. &gt;&gt; In that day of the sounding of the last church age, the seventh angel, the mysteries of God should be made known in that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seven seals will be broken. &gt;&gt; The mysteries of all these churches and things, how they happen, &gt;&gt; how what taking place. You see, they don't know it. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You blind Pharisees said, if the blind leads the blind, don't they both fall in the ditch?" See, that's the reason those people don't see that. &gt;&gt; So, the prophet is now laying it out for us. The reason why because as Jesus said the Pharisees, they won't go in the door and then they'll prevent those that are going in the door from going. &gt;&gt; There's a candle that is lit. You don't set it under a bushel. &gt;&gt; You set it so it can be seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees and the scribes wouldn't go in the door. &gt;&gt; And then they prevented those that were actually going in the door. Jesus said that. Now the prophet tells us by lack of this revelation is the reason why we have so many different um divisions among us. &gt;&gt; So what was the falling away? It's a falling away from the spirit. It's falling away from the word of God. It's falling away from this open door revelation. It's a foundation. The cause of it is the pastors. I read two or three quotes for you there. I'll read one more in just a moment moment. And the the what they're falling from is they're falling away from the word. Now, we'll see that a revelation is something that you can lose. It's something that actually the church lost. They had it &gt;&gt; and then lost it. Amen. &gt;&gt; One example biblically, the Old Testament example was Esau. How many remember Esau? &gt;&gt; He was born in the right position. He was born in the right family. It should have been Abraham, Isaac, Esau. That would have been the gradual uh uh uh inheritance. He would have received all from the lineage of Abraham. Was he not a son of Abraham? &gt;&gt; He was. &gt;&gt; But he lost it, didn't he? &gt;&gt; What did he lose? He lost because he disrespected the birthright. &gt;&gt; He disrespected the great move of God working amongst him in in this age would be the power of God and the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And this Esau, the Bible calls him the evil one, a wicked one. He had it and then he lost it. Isn't that something? We can see that pattern happening again. Even today, Lord, &gt;&gt; many people that have had the truth, they stood away from it. It's being lost from them. If you fail to preach it, you fail to teach it, it will become lost. &gt;&gt; It's just like your first language might be English or Spanish or French, whatever it is, you might know that language. You could be born in France or born wherever French-sp speakaking country and if you get to a place where you stop using that language, you'll actually lose that language. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And then we look at you, you look Hispanic and we sayas and you say, "What he saying? Aren't you supposed to know Spanish, my brother?" Well, maybe not. I'll never forget there's a prayer line with brother Billy Paul at at North Side and Brother Billy Paul had a prayer line and ministers and brothers here everywhere and the little sister came up for prayer and uh she spoke Spanish and he turned and looked at Caleb Don said it's Spanish come here and Caleb was like I don't speak no Spanish oh he felt that small for years he's like man I was so embarrassed I should learn my own language yeah but he said I should have just stood there and God would have just gave me the language. But uh it doesn't work that way. You can lose it. Hebrews 12:16 says, "Lest there be any fornicator or profane profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthight. For ye know how, that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. Now, there is there is a cost for taking a stand for the Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; and Esau didn't want to pay that price. But Jacob was willing to do anything &gt;&gt; to get that position that Esau had. &gt;&gt; It looked impossible. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKED LIKE THERE'S NO WAY, JACOB, YOU COULD EVER BE the first born. You're the SECOND BORN. BUT SOMETHING IN HIM DROVE HIM. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAITED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. AND WHEN IT CAME, he seized the moment. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; And Jacob was a TYPE OF THE SPIRITUAL BELIEVER. He doesn't DESERVE IT. IN FACT, HE'S ON HIS COURSE. HIS NAME IS OFF. EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM IS OFF. BUT HIS DESIRE &gt;&gt; IS TO BE WHAT GOD CALLED HIM TO BE. &gt;&gt; THAT IS A TRUE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; If you keep THE WORD, &gt;&gt; GOD WILL keep you. &gt;&gt; But it's the word first. &gt;&gt; You don't put a political field out there to see who's going to agree with you. You don't check THE THE THE CROWD TO see who's going to be your friend. &gt;&gt; NO, YOU TAKE A STAND &gt;&gt; for what's BEEN REVEALED TO YOU. &gt;&gt; And God will make a way. He made a way. HE MOVED ESAU AND PUT JACOB RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE PUT HIM THERE, HE CHANGED HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SUPERNATURAL. &gt;&gt; That's the God that I serve. &gt;&gt; That we serve. So this wisdom, this revelation, we call it wisdom in the scripture also. We call it the the enlightening or better understanding. Psalms 110 111:10 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding have all they that do his commandments. His praise endures forever." Now, wisdom is tied into people that fear the Lord. &gt;&gt; If they don't fear the Lord, that's not wise. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the IQ is. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many degrees they have. If they don't fear the Lord is just not wise. And the beginning of wisdom is those that fear the Lord. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 1:7 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction." Proverbs 9:es 9 and 10. Give instructions to a wise man and he will argue with you. No. Give instructions to a wise man and he will be yet wiser. &gt;&gt; Teach a just man and he will increase in learning. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. I wonder sometime if people fear other people more than they fear the Lord. I wonder if they fear their boss on a job or the people their their family members uh uh more than they fear the Lord. They certainly respect their careers more than they respect the Lord. They respect their their peer groups and what they're going to say about them or think about them. But you're not wise to take that position. Wisdom begins as you fear the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're not to fear any man. Not to FEAR ANY CONSEQUENCE. NOT TO FEAR losing your freedom or EVEN LOSING YOUR LIFE. IT IS WISE TO FEAR THE LORD FIRST. THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF ALL WISDOM. I FEAR WHAT THE WORD SAYS. I RESPECT THE WORD OF THE LORD. That's the beginning of all wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:5 and 7. Get wisdom. Get an understanding. Forget it not, neither decline from the words of my mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Forsake her not, and she shall do what to thee? Preserve thee. You keep it, it'll keep you. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee. Love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principle thing. Therefore, get wisdom with all thy getting, get understanding. This wisdom, Ecclesiastes 9 13 and 18 says this, the wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me. There was a little city, a few men within it, and there came a great king against it, and besieized it, and built a great bull works against it. Now there was found in it a poor, no-name wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no man remembered that same poor man. Then said I, wisdom is better than strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the poor man's wisdom is despised. And his words are are not heard. The words of the wise men are heard and quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. &gt;&gt; Wisdom is what? &gt;&gt; BETTER THAN WEAPONS OF WAR. &gt;&gt; But one sinner destroyth much good. So this wisdom, this great revelation is principle. &gt;&gt; The revelation that God reveals himself to you. &gt;&gt; This not going to give you a name so much, won't make you wealthy so much, &gt;&gt; but you'll be right in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; You'll be on the right side when the judgment strike. &gt;&gt; Wisdom &gt;&gt; will have you inside of the ark versus outside of the ark criticizing everything. Wisdom will keep YOU FROM BOWING &gt;&gt; EVEN IF THE COST SAYS, you know, just bow down because the king said so. No, those three Hebrew boys had wisdom. Why? Because they feared the Lord. Wisdom kept Joseph during his great TESTS AND TEMPTATION. WHY? BECAUSE HE FEARED THE LORD. He didn't fear Potterer. HE DIDN'T FEAR PHARAOH. AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T FEAR PIPER'S WIFE. HE STOOD WITH WISDOM. HE SAID, "HOW CAN I DO THIS AGAINST THE LORD?" AND LOOK WHAT THE Lord in his wisdom did FOR HIM. IT KEPT HIM. IT MOVED HIM. IT PRESERVED HIM. AND THAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING you today. &gt;&gt; DESPISE IT NOT. &gt;&gt; Despise it not, saints of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Stay with &gt;&gt; this great wisdom, the wisdom that has been given to us in this last day. Now what was this last day open door? It was as brother Vanam says it. It was the son of God impersonated in his church. Now look at this quotation here in 1963. I'm going to take 10 15 more minutes. Okay saints. &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet says here. Paragraph 148 147. They have refused the anointed word of promise of this age. And he is always the word. If God sent us an anointed promised word again for this age in 1946, he would be the same he was when he come in the beginning. The anointed word for the age. Hebrews 13:8 throws it right back in your lap and says he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. and he would stay with the father's promised word for this age. &gt;&gt; If Jesus comes, he would be just exactly what the word said he would be in this age. That's what Elijah was in his age. That's what Moses was in his age. That's what Noah was in his age. That's what everywhere, every prophet ever come. The word when it come in fullness, the entire word made flesh among us. It did just exactly what it said it would do in that age. &gt;&gt; If it come today, he would be just exactly Jesus Christ living out his promises of what he promised to do just as the word. Amen. Questions and answers. 1964, prophet says this, paragraph 49. So being a well-trained theo theologian had nothing to do with it. Being meek and gentle had nothing to do with it. What made him different? He was the word made flesh. Not the word for the day of Moses. &gt;&gt; Moses was that day word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the word for the days of Noah. Noah was the word for that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the word for the day of Elijah. Elijah was the word for that day, &gt;&gt; but he was the present tense word &gt;&gt; and they were living in the back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing repeats. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE EVIDENCE OF THE Holy Ghost. WOW. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD REVEALS to you and you see it, &gt;&gt; thus sayeth the Lord and accept it, not what you are, not what you was, nothing about it. It was God has done for you. There's the evidence. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't have a problem with Moses being the word for his day, do we? &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with Noah being the word for his day. &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with Elijah being the word for his day. Do we have a problem with the prophet William Browner being the word for his day? &gt;&gt; You say no. &gt;&gt; We want to skip that and just jump and say that we're the word made flesh. We're the bride will be the word. We want to skip the prophet. Don't skip nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; SAY IT ALL. STAY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; The prophet WAS THE WORD FOR THE AGE. AND when you receive that, the evidence OF THE HOLY GHOST, YOU BECOME THE WORD for your age. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil fool you. &gt;&gt; And have you sit down when it's time to stand up &gt;&gt; and be reconciled or be noticed for what side you're on? &gt;&gt; God sent his word and his word heals the people. &gt;&gt; Gy. Now, it's a lack of this revelation who Jesus is in the age that you live in. Huh? &gt;&gt; Can I go a little bit further? &gt;&gt; Yes, I have time. &gt;&gt; In the message of trial, brother Random says this here, paragraph 77, blind prosecutor. Can't you see that &gt;&gt; his words are true? Not nail scars and prints and thorns. &gt;&gt; It's the son of God impersonated in his church &gt;&gt; as son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to fulfill Malachi 4 and the rest of the scriptures &gt;&gt; are called to this court's attention. Look at that real good. &gt;&gt; Brother is telling us look at it real good. &gt;&gt; Son of man like God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost. It's the same God. Three different attributes of the same God. Now this is son of David. Son of man revealed then as a prophet son of David king. Now the son of God to the church age as God isn't man. God is a spirit and the spirit son is the holy ghost &gt;&gt; which is revealing the church age. &gt;&gt; But promised here &gt;&gt; in the last days &gt;&gt; that the son of man would be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if you don't have this revelation, you're going to be very shaky, very loose on some matters coming as it as it pertains to the message. If you don't have the revelation of who Jesus is, even historically, even on the sea shores of Galilee, you're going to have a problem with him. If you didn't know that he was the answer to Isaiah's prophecy, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; If you didn't know that he was the the Jehovah of the Old Testament made uh is Jesus of the New. If you didn't know that, you're going to have a problem. What you're going to do, you're going to examine his statements and say, "Eat my flesh and drink my blood." That's contrary to what Moses said. We believe Moses and not you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You're going to judge him HOW HE'S DOING. AND you're sitting with the wine bibbers and your your whole ministry is not the way we want. You're sitting there judging the word made flesh, the son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; judging him &gt;&gt; because you don't have a revelation of who he was, present tense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing today. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing today. THIS IS WHY THERE'S SUCH A SHIFT in a move in the hearts of the people or who and what this message is. They think it's optional like like the prophet's ministry is equal to any other ministry or they can just SAY IT'S WRONG NOW OR IT'S OFF NOW OR I PROVED HIM wrong because the internet said so. I I I I CHECKED OUT WHAT HE SAID AND I JUDGED HIM AND I KNOW THAT HE'S OFF NOW. I'M SORRY. That's all right, saints. If that's the discipline you're going to go under, you're going to go under. &gt;&gt; God reveals himself &gt;&gt; through his message, &gt;&gt; through the messenger. AND THAT MESSENGER NOW BROADCAST to all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not something that you can like theologically &gt;&gt; in um in in in to argue like we're going to have a YouTube channel now and argue who's right, who won that debate. Who won that debate? &gt;&gt; Who won that argument? Jesus won all the arguments. &gt;&gt; How did he win? When he got up from the grave. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SETTLED IT ONCE AND FOR ALL. ALL THE ARGUING, ALL THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS, ALL YOU'RE SAYING, WHY ON THAT THIRD DAY, HE GOT UP FROM THE GRAVE &gt;&gt; AND THE RESURRECTION PROVES &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS WHO HE SAID HE WAS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's not an argument. It's not something we try to prove to people &gt;&gt; as much as we try, much as we can. Paul said after the third admonition, "Let them go." Avoid foolish questions. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; get away from it. I know what it did for me, Brother Angel. This changed my life, young man. &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. I know what it did for me. &gt;&gt; I don't have to argue with that or prove that. &gt;&gt; I am the proof. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT I WAS. I KNOW WHAT I AM TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND Jesus proved who he was. Now people don't see it. It was the son of God impersonated in his church. It's the son of God impersonated in his church as the son of man. Now what does God do? We've seen this pattern in the scripture. Well, God uses a faithful messenger and that spirit sometimes comes back upon the people. Huh? Let's take the Bible now. Numbers 11:25. This is where it might get a little quiet. All right. He's either going to get more quiet or going to get louder. All right. We'll find out which one it is for you. Numbers chapter 11. Old Testament example. Let's find it quickly here. I didn't read it this morning. I had it in my other notes and I remember what it was. Verses 25 and 29. It says, "And the Lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the 70 elders. And it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon upon them, they prophesied and did not cease. &gt;&gt; They had something to say, didn't they? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't have nothing to say before that. But when the spirit &gt;&gt; that was on Moses, &gt;&gt; this is your Bible now. This is your Bible. The spirit that was on Moses &gt;&gt; was separated and came upon them. What they do? &gt;&gt; They did what Moses was doing. They prophesy. Let's read it. &gt;&gt; Lord came down in the clouds, spake on him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, gave it upon the 70 elders, and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and did not cease. Let's see this again in the scripture in second Kings chapter number two. Second Kings, is that in the Old Testament? What page is it on? Come on, somebody help me. Who said what? 4:22. Second Kings chapter 2. Some of y'all looking around. Yes. Second Kings chapter 2 verse number. Uhhuh. Nine. And it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elijah, "Ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee." &gt;&gt; And Elisha said, I pray thee, what'd he say? Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. Is this a bad thing or a good thing? &gt;&gt; Let me ask you. Is this man walked with Elijah? &gt;&gt; He's a young man. Brother Brandon said it took him 10 years for him to fit the coat of Elijah. &gt;&gt; About 10 years for him to learn and see his ways and KNOW HOW HE ACTS and operates. And now the opportunity of a lifetime is presented to him. And the prophet turns to HIM AND SAYS, "YOUNG MAN, WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU?" &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; ASK AND I WILL GIVE IT UNTO YOU. WHAT SHALL IT BE? He says, "I want a double portion. &gt;&gt; I WANT WHAT YOU GOT plus I want a double portion of your spirit." And he says, "Thou has asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee. But if not, it shall not be so. It came to pass as they still went on, they talked that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, horses of fire, parting them both to sunder. Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. Elijah saw it. HE CRIED, "MY FATHER, MY FATHER, THE CHARIOTS OF ISRAEL AND THE horsemen thereof. He saw him no more, and he took a hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces. He took up also THE MANTLE OF ELIJAH THAT FELL FROM him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. And he took the mantle OF ELIJAH THAT FELL from him. HE SMOKED THE WATERS AND SAID, &gt;&gt; "WHERE IS THE GOD? &gt;&gt; What is where is the Lord God of Elijah?" And when he had smitten the waters, they parted hither, and thither Elijah went over. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Was that wrong for him to ask for that? &gt;&gt; When you're listening to the tape, don't you want the same anointing on that tape to come on you? &gt;&gt; Huh? Yes. &gt;&gt; When you're reading your Bible, don't you want the same anointing of that Bible to come on you? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PRAYER LINE IS GOING ON AND YOU HEAR SAINTS BEING BLESSED AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BEING HEALED AND DELIVERED, &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU WANT TO SAY, "LORD, &gt;&gt; LET THAT SPIRIT COME ON ME AGAIN." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. because I know who's speaking. &gt;&gt; I know whose spirit this is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. I have to close now. But let's deal with this last little quotation here on Moses. Let's see what the prophet says about this happening of Moses. &gt;&gt; All right. And we could have kept going on and on in the evening and evening messenger brother Random deals with it who the problem is who the leaders but he says this in taking sides with Jesus. Paragraph 116. Musicians can come, please. Like Jethro said to Moses, "Why you can't you can't beat out all of them or God put elders out there, 70 of them took the spirit was on Moses and put them upon those 70 elders and they prophesied." And it didn't weaken Moses a bit, it strengthened him. &gt;&gt; I wish there was a spiritual application we can catch there. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have weakened brother Moses in their camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I just keep it like that with Moses? They've weakened him, but it strengthened him. &gt;&gt; He had just as much prophecy in him as he did before they took the spirit off of him to prophesy. See, he's just separated. said, "Now Moses, let them judge the smaller things, but when it comes to the major things, you come in with them and help them like that." &gt;&gt; Paragraph 153, end time evangelism. Can I make this my last one? &gt;&gt; Who said no? Who said yes? &gt;&gt; Can I get a vote here this morning? Do I need to close or I need to stay? &gt;&gt; Somebody say go home. &gt;&gt; Somebody say stay for a little while. &gt;&gt; All right, I'll read one more for you. God bless you. All right. Paragraph 153, end time evangelism. He says this here. Now, we find out it's the leaders that does it. The leaders have always been the mixed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at old Dayton back there in the Bible time in Moses's dispensation of the law. He was the one who led the mixed multitude. Dayton, it was Kora. When God raised his prophet Moses, he had the word of the Lord. He had two and a half million people out there in that desert. And Jethro come up and said, "Moses is going to kill you. Your burden's so great." God took part of his spirit and put it upon 70 elders. And they prophesied. It never weakened Moses a bit. He But Moses was still the last answer &gt;&gt; cuz he had thus sayeth &gt;&gt; the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, if you look real close, we can prophesy and preach today because God sent a tremendous message in our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want a double portion of that spirit &gt;&gt; upon me, &gt;&gt; upon my ministry. &gt;&gt; And if that does take place, it's not going to weaken the prophet in my eyes. &gt;&gt; It'll actually strengthen him. &gt;&gt; In my eyes. I believe that. Yes. Yes. Yes. I believe that with all of my heart. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word this morning. We thank you for the great revelation of the supreme deity. How you have shown yourself to be the same yesterday, today, and forever in every age. And you prove it. You proved it here in this last age. And Lord, I want to stand for that as a witness of the change that's happened since that revelation struck me. Who is speaking &gt;&gt; when I'm reading the Bible? &gt;&gt; Who is speaking &gt;&gt; when I'm listening to the tapes of the prophet? Oh God, it's been revealed to me who that is. It's you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever. May you strengthen in every heart, Lord. May this move the confusion away from those that are weak in their faith. May it cause them, Lord, to be stabilized. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the hour that we live in, the great falling away that is taking place. But Lord, we stay with it. You said in your word, you have kept the word of my patience. Lord, &gt;&gt; I will also keep thee during the great tribulation. And this is what's keeping us Lord. We believe that in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Brothers John can come and sing a few songs. Amen. Let's bow our heads one more time. If somebody is here that needs special prayer, even if it's an unspoken need, I'm going to give this invitation. You actually you can come forward for prayer, too. It's always open, always welcome. You need prayer, you can come forward for prayer. I'll lay hands upon you and pray for you. Yes, Ezekiel. And as he comes and those that need hands laid upon them just laying right here, let's bow our heads and just the those of you that have a special request in your heart and in your life this morning for the Lord Jesus Christ. Thinking of Sister Edith. Edith Wright, you called her home. I don't even know if she was in her 50s, 40some, and never really got the answer why she you didn't answer that for her. But Lord, this is not a gimmick. We know that. We appreciate that. It's not a gimmick, but you keep your word. And if you're here today and you have a request in your heart, your life that God needs to answer for you, why don't you slip up your hand? I'll pray for you. Thank you for those hands. God bless those hands. All those hands. Hands all over. So many hands. I'll pray. Lord Jesus, you see the hands that are raised and what's beneath that hand this morning. Father, would you answer every one of them? Oh God, answer it in your own time. Lord, &gt;&gt; and Lord, we wait upon thee to keep your word. We know that you're the healer. We know that you're the deliverer. We know that all of our answers are answered through you and your word. Oh God, I pray that you would grant the fortitude, the faith to hold steady. Lord, as you begin to answer these requests for your people, for your children, I pray you'll unlock the mysteries of their very life. In even troublesome times, Lord, tribulation, times of tribulation, you'll keep us if we keep the word. It's the word first. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you grant that to these hands and these hearts. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Yes. accepted the word of the Lord. The revealed word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi. Can't you see why I'm happy? I've accepted the word of the Lord. the reveal word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi 4. Oh, can't you see why I am happy? I've accepted the word of the Lord. the reveal that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi. Oh, can't you see &gt;&gt; why I'm happy? I've accepted the word &gt;&gt; of the Lord. The revealed word that was spoken by the prophet of man. Great is thy faithfulness, oh God, my father. There is no shadow of turning with thee. Thou changes love. Thy compassions they failed on. As thou has been, thou forever will be. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning, new mercies I see. All I have needed done and roll by. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord. to me. Summer and winter, springtime and harst, sun, moon, and stars in their courses above. Join with all nature in man and manifold witness. Speak it out &gt;&gt; to thy great faithfulness, mercy and love. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning, new mercies I see. All I have needed, thy hand have proided. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me. It's pardon for sin and a peace that endureth. Thy own dear presence to cheer and to God. It's strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow. Blessings all mine with 10,000. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is my faithfulness. Morning by morning, new mercies I see. All I have heeded, thy have proided. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, on to me. In moments like these, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like these. I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to you, Lord. Let's stand as we tell him. Lord, I love you. Sing it. I love you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. I love you. Let's sing that one more time. In moments, in moments like these, I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like these. I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. singing, "I love you, Lord." Sing it. I love you, Lord. I love you. Singing I love you, Lord. Singing I love you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. I love Brother Nathan, would you come and dismiss us as some prayers? We sing that one more time. Sing it. I say unto thee by my spirit, I I am the Lord thy God and I come in thy midst today that I might bring a word unto thee that thou has heard my spirit speak in thy midst today that you might be called into a higher place with me sayeth the Lord. For I call thee into a higher place as you have moved into a great transition THAT HAS ASSEMBLED THYSELF into this new building say the Lord. I desire you to come unto my place, sayeth the Lord, that I might bring you and you might suck with me in a greater way. Yay, you have eaten of my word. Many of you have eaten of my word for many years. But I am calling you into a greater RESPONSIBILITY OF MY WORD, A RESPONSIBILITY THAT YOU MIGHT HOLD FAST TO THE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY AND THAT YOU MIGHT remain faithful in these things, say the Lord. FOR I SAY UNTO THEE, there are many changes coming upon THE LAND OF THIS COUNTRY, AND YOU WILL SEE IT IN THIS next coming months. For I am the LORD THY GOD, and I am in thy midst, and I'm calling you to a greater sincerity before me. Remove yourself from the THINGS OF THE WORLD AND THE EARTH, AND I SHALL SEPARATE YOU EVEN THE MORE SO, SAITH THE Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. singing. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. Singing I love you. Lord, &gt;&gt; I precious heavenly father. Lord, how grateful we are, Father, to live in a day, Lord, where we can hear your voice, Lord, spoken through your servants, Father. We believe, Lord, that you've ordained a plan, Lord, that your voice, Lord, will be used by the foolishness of man, Lord. Father, if they get out of the way, Lord, that you'll use their lips, Lord. Father, we just thank you for your faithful servants, Lord. We thank you for &gt;&gt; vindicating a prophet in our age Lord that sent us a word Lord that we can stand upon Father we don't have to wonder about Lord Jesus that Father we can look back to Lord as a as a tiepost Lord that we can stand upon as a rock Lord as many messages in our day Lord as influences, Lord, but you've left us the path, Lord. You've left us the the light, Lord. Just help us to walk in it, Father. Lord, let laying aside everything else, Lord. Let's let's look to you, Lord. Press towards the mark of the high calling, Lord Jesus. The things of this world, Lord, just fade away, Lord. Father, we just know your time of your appearing, Lord, is so close at hand, Lord. Just renew it in our hearts, Lord. The the preciousness of what you've offered us, Lord. The the condescension and grace that you've given to us, Lord. Father, the the revelation, Lord, that that you've spoken to us, Lord, that you've anointed our ears to hear, Lord Jesus. And it, Father, the the revelation you've placed inside our hearts, Lord, God, may we hold on, hold fast, Lord. Hold fast to what you've been given us, Lord. We know there's it's a shaking time, Lord, as we heard in our prophet say this morning, Lord. But God, we we know we don't need to trust in our ability to hold on, Lord, for you've told us, Lord, that you'll hold on to us, Lord, if we'll just look to you, believe you, put our hand in yours, Lord. Father, become as little children, Lord. Just trusting in what you've said, Lord. Lay aside our own thoughts, Father. Just put our faith in you, Lord. And God, we just do that today, Lord, with thanksgiving, with praise, Lord. You're almighty, Lord. We We just You're so wonderful, Lord. And the wonder of your creation, Lord. We can lose sight of it, Lord. All the things you've done for us, Lord. But, Father, may we just look back, Lord, to the the path you've laid for us, Lord. The the light you've shed, Lord, and walk in it, Lord. Father, keep each one, Lord, as we go our separate ways, Lord. Father, we just be with us until we gather together once again, Lord. Father, we we want to dwell in your presence, Lord. We we we want to create an atmosphere that keeps you with us, Lord. Not in not in a building, Lord, but throughout our day, throughout our week, throughout our lives, Lord. May you be present in our homes, Lord, and our families, Lord, and and our children. And Lord, we just want to be close to you, Lord. We want to become more like you, Father. And we just commit it into your hands, Lord. Thank you and praise you. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. I thankful for the admonition, the challenge to go on to a higher plane with him. How many can say, "Lord, lift me up. Let me stand on higher ground this morning." Amen. We will have communion and footwashing tonight. So, just uh you'd like to take a little extra time just seeking the Lord before you go, we'll stay and sing a few songs of worship. And let's come expecting. It's a it's a privilege to be able to come together and take the Lord's supper and wash each other's feet. Thankful to have a body of believers that we can go to when we have something we're going through. And you know, just as as Caleb did when he had the mountain to to possess, he says, you know, I need help.

Sister Sharon, sing this before we go. Oh, glorious mystery. That day he set me free and made my heart his very throne. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I live to praise his name. Oh, who I am, Lord. Who I am. I can see now just who I am. A part of my Savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. On Calvary, he died to redeem his lost bride. The King of Kings became my Savior. This is God's great mystery of his love expressed to me that Christ and I might be made one. Oh, I am Lord. Who I am. I can see now who I am. A part of my savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. Sing it one more time. Oh, who I am, Lord. Oh, who I am. I can see now who I am. A part of my savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation. His predestination. It's a revelation of who I am. Amen. You're dismissed. In peace like a river attendeth my way. When sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my long thou has taught me to sing. It is well. It is well with my soul. It is well with my soul. Oh, it is well. It is well with my soul. Though Satan should buff it, the trial should come. Let this bless us show us control that Christ has regarded my helpless sustain and passion. shed his own blood for my soul. It is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. My sin. Oh, the bliss of this glorious love. I share not in part but in home. Was nailed to the cross and I bear no more. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, oh my soul. It is well with my soul. All it is is well. It is well with my soul. Oh Lord, haste the day when my face shall be sight. The clouds be rolled back as a scroll. The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend. Even so it is well with my soul. It is well with my soul. Oh, it is well. It is well with my soul. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
