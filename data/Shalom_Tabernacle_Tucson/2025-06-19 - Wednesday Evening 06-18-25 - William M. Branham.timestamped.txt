[4:50] God bless you all this evening. So good
[4:52] to be here. So good to see everyone.
[4:54] Just to ask if um
[5:00] Scott, would you come open the service
[5:02] up for the word of prayer?
[5:06] [Music]
[5:13] Amen. Could we all stand this evening?
[5:16] Dear Lord Jesus, God, we thank you once
[5:19] again. We're gathered together, Father.
[5:21] We're going to hear your word this
[5:22] evening, Lord. It's the highlight of our
[5:25] middle of our week, Lord, to get to come
[5:27] together one more time. Lord, we ask you
[5:30] that you forgive us of our sins, our
[5:32] shortcomings, everywhere we've fallen
[5:34] short, Lord. Every time we've not
[5:37] pleased you, Lord, we just ask that you
[5:38] put that in the sea of your
[5:40] forgetfulness, Father. Lord, we pray
[5:42] your word comes forth tonight into
[5:45] fertile ears and hearts that we can hear
[5:47] and receive your word, Father, and bring
[5:49] it forth, Jesus. Just let everything
[5:51] that's done be for your glory and for
[5:53] your honor. And it's in Jesus name we
[5:55] pray. Amen.
[5:57] Thank you.
[6:00] We'll go to the key of G.
[6:02] You know, Wednesdays are
[6:05] fantastically easy, right? No, they're
[6:08] not. But you know, it's
[6:12] gold when it's put under that high
[6:15] temperature. Super hot and beaten is
[6:18] when you get the best results. So maybe
[6:21] we can just set aside some of the trials
[6:23] and tribulations of today in our mind
[6:25] and just focus on him just for a few
[6:27] minutes and just worship him.
[6:32] Jesus has a table spread where the
[6:35] saints of God are fed. He invites his
[6:39] chosen people come and dine.
[6:44] With his mana he does feed and supplies
[6:49] their every need. Oh, it is sweet to
[6:52] suck with Jesus all the time.
[6:57] Come and dine. The master call it come
[7:01] and die.
[7:04] You may feast at Jesus table all the
[7:08] time.
[7:09] [Music]
[7:11] You fed the multitude,
[7:14] turn the water into wine. Do the hungry
[7:18] call it now. Come and die.
[7:23] The disciples came to land. Thus obeying
[7:28] Christ's command, for the master called
[7:32] unto them, come and die.
[7:36] There they found their hearts desire.
[7:39] Bread and fish upon the fire. The sea
[7:43] satisfies the hungry every time.
[7:49] Come and dine. The master callth come
[7:52] and die.
[7:55] You may feast at Jesus table all the
[7:59] time.
[8:02] He who fed the multitude
[8:05] turned the water into wine. Do the
[8:09] hungry call. Now come and die.
[8:15] Soon the land will take his bride to be
[8:19] ever at his side. All the hosts of
[8:23] heaven will assemble me.
[8:28] Oh will be a glorious sight. All the
[8:32] saints in spotless white and with Jesus
[8:36] they will be glory.
[8:39] [Music]
[8:41] Come and dine. The master call it come
[8:44] and die.
[8:47] You may feast at Jesus table all the
[8:51] time.
[8:54] He who fed the multitude
[8:57] turn the water into wine. to the hungry
[9:02] calleth. Now come and dive. He fed the
[9:06] He who fed the multitude.
[9:10] Turn the water into wine. To the hungry
[9:15] calleth now come and dine.
[9:20] Amen. Thank you Lord. You may be seated.
[9:24] Go to the key of E flat.
[9:28] We find many people who can understand
[9:33] why we are so happy and free.
[9:38] We've crossed over Jordan to Canaan's
[9:42] fair land. And this is like heaven to
[9:46] me.
[9:49] This is like heaven to me.
[9:54] This is like heaven to me.
[9:59] I crossed over Jordan to Canaan's fair
[10:03] land. And this is like heaven to me.
[10:09] So when I get happy, I sing and I shout.
[10:14] The devil don't believe it. I see.
[10:19] But I'm filled with the spirit. There
[10:22] isn't a doubt and that's what's the
[10:26] matter with me.
[10:29] This is like heaven to me. Praise God.
[10:34] This is like heaven to me.
[10:39] I crossed over Jordan to Kan's fair land
[10:44] and this is like heaven to me.

[10:52] heavenly core from glory land over the
[10:57] sea.

[14:58] driving down there and you just got to
[14:59] sing and they just bring you so much
[15:01] peace in your car. That's one of them
[15:04] for me.
[15:06] Go to the key of C. We haven't done this
[15:08] one in a while. Brother Craig Washington
[15:11] did this one at the Mesa church last
[15:14] Thursday. I was there and it was just
[15:16] such a blessing to me. But it's most I
[15:20] think most of you all know it, but we'll
[15:22] have the words up for you. So just join
[15:24] in.

[16:24] way
[16:26] in me.
[16:27] [Music]
[16:31] Cleans
[16:34] me
[16:35] from every
[16:39] sin

[16:44] me
[16:47] free.
[16:50] [Music]
[16:52] I
[16:54] praise
[16:56] thee, Lord.
[17:02] for cleansing
[17:04] me
[17:06] from sin.
[17:12] Oh,
[17:15] fill
[17:17] thy word.
[17:23] Make
[17:24] me pure
[17:27] with this.
[17:33] Fill
[17:35] me
[17:37] with fire.
[17:40] There
[17:42] where once
[17:45] I burn
[17:48] with shame.
[17:53] Grant
[17:56] my
[17:58] desire
[18:00] to magnify
[18:03] [Music]
[18:06] thy
[18:09] name.
[18:14] Lord,
[18:17] take
[18:18] my life
[18:24] and make
[18:26] it holy
[18:29] thine.
[18:35] Till
[18:37] thy
[18:39] poor heart
[18:42] with
[18:45] thy
[18:47] great love
[18:50] divine.
[18:55] Take
[18:58] all
[19:00] my will.
[19:05] my passion
[19:08] self
[19:10] and pride.
[19:16] I
[19:18] now
[19:20] surrender
[19:24] Lord
[19:25] in me.

[19:37] Oh

[20:27] Thou will
[20:30] supply
[20:32] [Music]
[20:33] our need
[20:38] for
[20:41] blessing
[20:44] now.
[20:46] Oh Lord,
[20:48] I humble
[20:51] thee.
[20:56] [Music]
[20:58] Amen. Let's all stand as we change the
[21:00] order of the service.
[21:06] Jesus
[21:08] loves me. This I know
[21:14] for the Bible
[21:18] tells me so.
[21:21] [Music]
[21:22] Little
[21:23] ones to him belong.
[21:29] They are weak. But he is strong.
[21:37] Yes.
[21:39] Jesus
[21:41] loves me.
[21:44] Yes,
[21:46] Jesus
[21:48] loves me.
[21:52] Yes,
[21:54] Jesus
[21:56] loves me.
[21:58] The Bible
[22:01] tells
[22:02] me so.
[22:07] Jesus
[22:09] loves me. He who died
[22:14] heaven's
[22:16] gate to open
[22:20] wide.
[22:22] He will wash away my sin.
[22:29] had his little
[22:33] child come in.
[22:36] Yes,
[22:38] Jesus
[22:40] loves me.
[22:44] Yes,
[22:46] Jesus
[22:48] loves me.
[22:51] Yes,
[22:53] Jesus
[22:55] loves me.
[22:58] The Bible
[23:01] tells me so.
[23:06] Jesus
[23:08] loves me. Loves me still.
[23:14] Though I'm very
[23:17] weak and ill,
[23:21] from his shining
[23:25] throne on high
[23:29] comes to watch me where? Let's take the
[23:34] last verse.
[23:36] Jesus
[23:38] loves me. He will stay
[23:44] close beside
[23:46] me all the way.
[23:51] If I love him when I die,
[23:59] he will take me home on high.
[24:06] Yes,
[24:08] Jesus
[24:10] loves me.
[24:14] Yes,
[24:16] Jesus
[24:17] loves me.

[24:31] tells me so.
[24:36] [Music]
[24:41] Thank God Jesus loves us. Amen. God
[24:43] bless everyone tonight.
[24:46] We're going to be continuing with the
[24:48] study on spiritual adoption, part two.
[24:52] We'll start at paragraph 152. It'll be
[24:54] about 45 minutes. And this is from the
[24:57] text in Ephesians that we've been
[24:59] reading, uh, chapter 1, verse 3
[25:02] through7. Before we go to uh hearing the
[25:07] message, can we all sing only believe
[25:13] only
[25:15] [Music]
[25:22] [Music]
[25:37] [Music]
[25:47] All things are possible.
[25:53] Holy
[25:54] be
[25:57] Lord
[25:59] I believe.
[26:03] Lord
[26:05] I believe
[26:09] all things are possible.
[26:15] Lord, I believe.
[26:20] Lord,
[26:22] I believe.
[26:26] Lord,
[26:28] I believe.
[26:32] All things are possible.
[26:38] Lord, I believe.
[26:42] You may be seated, brother Bren.
[26:50] Why do you say Calvin believed something
[26:52] like that? I didn't believe Calvin.
[26:54] Calvin was a murderer.
[26:57] Calvin put a man to death because he
[26:58] baptized in Jesus name. He was a rascal.
[27:02] Need to be converted himself. That's
[27:05] true. But what he said about some of the
[27:07] things he said was right. Amen. Don't.
[27:10] But what he his action a man to kill a
[27:12] man for something like that. That's
[27:14] horrible. That's sinful. All right.
[27:16] Wherein he has abounded towards us. Oh,
[27:19] wait. I didn't get that adoption did it.
[27:24] Am I too late?
[27:27] See what this says up here. What time?
[27:30] All right. Just just let's say 10
[27:32] minutes for the sake of these people's
[27:34] come so long. Look look adoption. Let me
[27:38] share what I've done. Now, a father has
[27:40] a big kingdom. He rides around. Now,
[27:43] he's got a sunborn. Oh, he's so happy.
[27:45] That's God.
[27:48] So, you know what that father does? He
[27:50] finds the very best razor tutor. You
[27:53] know what a tutor is, don't you? It's a
[27:55] school teacher. He finds the very best
[27:57] school teacher he can find in all the
[27:59] country. And then we're going now.
[28:01] Listen.
[28:04] And he finds the best school teacher he
[28:06] can find. He don't just get just a
[28:08] scall. He wants his boy to be a real
[28:11] fella. Don't you want your children that
[28:13] way? Sure. Best you can give him. Yes,
[28:15] sir.
[28:17] So, if a natural man thought that, what
[28:19] do you think God thinks about for his
[28:21] children?
[28:22] The best he could get. So, he wants a
[28:25] man that'll be honest. Now, he don't man
[28:27] want a man say, "Now, look, I I Junior,
[28:29] you just do anything you want to, honey.
[28:31] Uh uh oh, yes, father. Uh Mhm. He's
[28:34] getting along fine. He's a fine boy. Uh,
[28:37] get a little pat on his back and a straw
[28:38] in his hat. No, no, that guy get fired
[28:42] right now. Sure. He wants a man that'll
[28:45] be truthful. If that boy is coming
[28:48] right, tell him. If he isn't, tell him
[28:49] what's wrong. And if a earthly father
[28:53] thought that, wouldn't you want a man to
[28:55] be honest with you, the school teacher
[28:56] be honest about your children?
[28:59] Sure. What do you think God thinks? And
[29:02] he knows. We don't. He does. We're
[29:04] finite. We couldn't tell, but he's
[29:06] infinite and does know. So, you know
[29:08] what the father did? He never said, "I'm
[29:10] going to get a pope to watch over my
[29:12] children." Neither say, "I'm going to
[29:15] get a bishop." Amen. No. No. He didn't
[29:19] do that. Cuz you know the pope would be
[29:20] wrong. So would the bishop.
[29:23] He never said, "I'm going to get a
[29:24] general overseer to watch over my
[29:26] churches." No. No. He got the Holy
[29:29] Ghost.
[29:31] That was his tutor.
[29:34] Mhm. to raise his children. All right.
[29:38] Then how would you know if the Holy
[29:40] Ghost don't say he speaks through human
[29:41] lips? How do you know then it's tell the
[29:43] truth? When you see the Holy Spirit
[29:45] speaking through a lips that's telling
[29:47] the truth exactly every time predicting
[29:49] it coming to pass just perfectly like
[29:51] Samuel said, then you know that's true.
[29:55] It's coming right because God said if he
[29:57] speaks and what he says don't come to
[29:58] pass hear him because I'm not with him.
[30:00] But if he does hear him cause I'm with
[30:02] him. See, there you are. That's how he
[30:04] does. Now, then he goes around. Now,
[30:07] what do you think that tutor would say
[30:08] if he had to go up to the father and
[30:10] say, "Your your children's acting
[30:12] awful."
[30:14] I tell you, that boy yours eating. He's
[30:16] renegade. He's a rous about I never seen
[30:19] such a fell. Ma, you know what he does?
[30:23] And that girl of yours, oh, I don't know
[30:26] what you going to do with her.
[30:28] Well, you know what? She looks up like
[30:31] she's she's all painted up like some of
[30:32] them girls over here in Philistine. Yes.
[30:36] She wants to act just like they do. My
[30:38] daughter. Yeah. Your daughter. That's
[30:41] what the Holy Spirit has to say about
[30:43] the church today. No wonder we can't
[30:45] have a revival.
[30:50] Now that's true.
[30:52] What about your son? Huh? Same thing.
[30:57] What? Well, you know, you always said
[31:00] that those sheep should heard in that
[31:02] pasture up there on that sheep food up
[31:03] there. Yeah. You know what he did?
[31:06] He drove them down there in that weed
[31:07] pile.
[31:09] Just tuck them down there, dunk them all
[31:10] in that creek and let them raid around
[31:12] that weed pile. Eating them old willers
[31:14] and their support. They can't hardly get
[31:15] out of there.
[31:17] That's bishops,
[31:20] pastors who deny the power thereof.
[31:26] Well, there I tell you the truth. I
[31:29] never seen such a bunch of nervous sheep
[31:30] in my life.
[31:33] You don't like that. No. And you know
[31:36] what? Them cattle up here, you know, you
[31:38] you told them feed on that that although
[31:42] up there, you know, to make them fat.
[31:43] Yeah. You know what he's giving them?
[31:45] No. Them old iron weeds. Yeah. He's
[31:48] making them join societies and
[31:50] everything. You never seen the life in
[31:51] your life. Never seen such an all in
[31:53] your life. You know what he's doing?
[31:56] Going along out there smoking a big
[31:59] cigar
[32:01] back.
[32:03] He's got his wife with him. She's
[32:04] wearing shorts just like the Philistines
[32:07] are doing out there.
[32:09] Yep. That's kind of message the Holy
[32:12] Spirit has to take about church today.
[32:16] Now, what do you think about that?
[32:18] That's adoption. What he did he do? He
[32:21] predestined us unto adoption. He gives
[32:25] us the Holy Ghost. But wait a minute,
[32:27] adoption. That's what we're talking
[32:29] about. Adoption.
[32:33] Well, you know what he does? The bishop
[32:35] come by the other day and he was having
[32:36] a little healing service down there. The
[32:38] bishop come by, some guy, brother come
[32:40] by was praying for the sick. He said,
[32:42] "You stop that." Oh. Oh yes, Father
[32:44] Bishop.
[32:47] Don't you cooperate? Oh no, Father
[32:49] Bishop. Sure.
[32:51] And here I come and tell him the truth
[32:53] right out of your word. See, here it is.
[32:55] I'll read your laws to him exactly what
[32:57] to do. And he won't listen to him. He
[32:59] said, "Oh, that was for another age,
[33:02] another son." Some other time that don't
[33:03] mean me.
[33:06] There you are.
[33:08] That's truth, friend.
[33:11] Now, don't you see where the church
[33:12] misses its places? Why we haven't got
[33:15] revivals? Why we haven't got things
[33:17] going on? That's where it lays.
[33:20] Joshua say, "Uh,
[33:23] Gad, I want you to right in here. Lays
[33:27] your place." According to the blueprint,
[33:29] your place, Lady Sure. Right in here.
[33:31] You get in here, Gad, and stay here.
[33:33] Benjamin, you go right down here. And
[33:36] you all stay away from the border, the
[33:37] Philistines. Joshua comes back here.
[33:40] They all over the Philistines had a big
[33:42] old shindig danced up like that. And all
[33:44] the women painted up and dancing around
[33:46] having a big time. And Joshua scratches
[33:49] his head and say
[33:52] now what?
[33:54] That's exactly what's taking place.
[33:57] Not all. Thank God. Amen. Not all, but
[34:01] too many.
[34:03] All right. Now, what takes place then?
[34:05] That's what happens. Don't you imagine
[34:07] that man, the Holy Spirit blushes before
[34:09] the father when he has to say that.
[34:12] Oh my.
[34:14] Uh, I I told him, but he he he wouldn't
[34:17] listen to it. I told him that and let
[34:20] him read right there in the book. I had
[34:21] I had a little minister come by and show
[34:23] him that Jesus Christ is the same
[34:25] yesterday and forever. And you know
[34:27] what? He let one of them let one of them
[34:30] old goat herders come over here and tell
[34:32] him that that was for another age.
[34:39] And he smelled so bad the time he got
[34:41] over there with goat smell, you know,
[34:45] cigars and you know and so smelled so
[34:48] bad when he got over here.
[34:53] But I tell you that gold herder had
[34:55] enough medals pinned on him
[34:58] or I if you'd write his name in the
[35:00] paper it take his obituary would take a
[35:03] half a sheet to make his title.
[35:06] Yes sir. They sure like him over there
[35:08] in that country. But I tell you, he sure
[35:09] don't know how to feed sheep. That's one
[35:12] thing about Amen. Amen. He just won't
[35:15] listen to him, says the Holy Spirit.
[35:17] I've tried to tell him that you're the
[35:18] same yesterday, today, and forever, but
[35:20] he he just won't do it. He's the biggest
[35:22] coward I' ever seen my life.
[35:24] And the church has made him an overseer,
[35:26] bishop, so forth. All the people listen
[35:29] to him. And then you know what? They
[35:31] take those, they got a little old thing
[35:33] down there, they call a television. You
[35:34] turn the little thing on like that. And
[35:36] them women come on and carry on all kind
[35:38] of halfway dresses and you know a lot of
[35:40] your daughters are Oh, surely not.
[35:45] Yes, they are. Yep, they're doing that.
[35:49] Some of them are crying out for revival,
[35:50] Father. Some of them really born. Some
[35:53] of them are really walking the line.
[35:55] Some of them are standing just as true
[35:57] on that word as they can be. Others are
[35:59] don't know what to do. They're they're
[36:00] way out there. You know what them
[36:01] mothers doing? Making fun of them and
[36:03] they're just a bunch of crap.
[36:06] Well, that makes me feel pretty bad. But
[36:09] now, let's change the picture. Now, the
[36:12] father, his son, is a good boy. His
[36:15] father, right, ride right along. Here's
[36:17] the tutor, the Holy Spirit. Which way?
[36:18] The Holy Spirit. He said, "I'm going to
[36:20] walk." Tutor said, "I'm the child said,
[36:22] I'll walk right with you."
[36:25] I'll go right with you. Well, the hill's
[36:28] awful high, son. I'll go right with you.
[36:30] I got confidence in you. Amen. If I
[36:33] start getting tired, you raise my hand
[36:34] up and hold me on. But there's lines up
[36:37] on the hill there. Don't matter. As long
[36:39] as you're around, it'll make a bit of
[36:40] difference.
[36:42] There's trouble up there. Slick rocks. I
[36:44] don't care. As long as you're a home, I
[36:46] walk right with you. I walk right. Oh,
[36:48] you know what? Your dad used to do that.
[36:52] That's good. Yes, sir. Get up on top of
[36:54] the hill there. Oh, he said, "You know
[36:56] what, Father? Your son is just like a
[36:58] chip off the old block. He is absolutely
[37:01] exactly like you. Every word that you
[37:04] say, he says amen to it.
[37:07] I I had him turn over in the Bible the
[37:09] other day and he said Jesus Christ the
[37:11] same yesterday and forever. You know
[37:12] what he said? He screamed and thrown his
[37:14] hands up in the air and said hallelujah.
[37:16] Amen.
[37:18] Oh Lord. And you know what he said here
[37:20] in your words, you know your word, he
[37:22] said the work he that believeth on me,
[37:23] the works that I do shall he do also.
[37:25] Yeah, I remember writing that to my son.
[37:28] Yeah, I remember writing that. Oh, when
[37:30] he saw that, he just screamed and jumped
[37:31] up. Hallelujah. Lord, take all the world
[37:34] out of me. Make me like that. Yes, sir.
[37:38] All those things that he done. Oh, the
[37:41] father said is
[37:44] I'm I'm I'm happy for that son. That's a
[37:47] fine son. All right. Keep eye on him for
[37:51] a few years. See how he see how he go
[37:53] comes along, how he progresses. A while
[37:55] the years pass by. How's he getting
[37:58] along? Oh my. He's even growing in
[38:00] grapes. Ooh my. He just He's shelling
[38:04] the woods. I'm telling you. He's He's
[38:06] really Why? He takes them sheep can
[38:08] handle them just just like you do. He'll
[38:11] never give him seaweeds. He'll never
[38:13] give them arm weeds when they come
[38:15] around saying we want to join the church
[38:16] and say, "Shut your mouth. You don't
[38:18] need that." No, sir. Here's what you
[38:20] need. Repent and be baptized. Every one
[38:21] of you name Jesus Christ
[38:24] and shout against the Holy Ghost. Yes,
[38:27] sir. That's what he said. Oh, does he
[38:29] really say that? Yes, sir. He sure does.
[38:31] Well, that's just the way I wrote it.
[38:32] That's just the way he says it. Yes,
[38:35] sir. Some of them said, "Tear you see
[38:38] Jerusalem till you do with power on high
[38:39] since the Holy Ghost come upon you. Be
[38:41] witness to me in Jerusalem, Judea,
[38:42] Samir, and other most parts of the
[38:43] world." When you're ready, hallelujah.
[38:45] That's what you need. Amen. You know
[38:47] what he does? He just gets them right
[38:48] down there to the get it. That's all.
[38:50] Stays right with them. If they start
[38:53] fussing, he said, "Well, wait a minute.
[38:55] Wait a minute." That's the way goats
[38:56] act, not sheep.
[38:59] Or sometimes they get a little peeved at
[39:00] him, but he kind of pat him on the back
[39:02] a little bit. Said, "Wait a minute."
[39:05] All right. He really knows how to
[39:07] control them sheep. Yes, sir. I'll tell
[39:10] you. You know what? I've seen Archbishop
[39:13] so and so tell him if he could come in
[39:15] this town and hold a meeting, but you
[39:16] know, I kind of let him. I said, "Go
[39:18] anyhow." See,
[39:23] went through all these tapes and don't
[39:24] you let them go out. We went anyhow
[39:27] went over in these towns here said,
[39:28] "Well, we won't spot." And you know the
[39:30] devil got down there said, "I bet you I
[39:32] can keep him out of that town." I said,
[39:34] "You can't do it. If I tell him to go,
[39:36] he'll go. I bet you go." No, no, no, no.
[39:40] I'll tell him. I'm going to say, "Hey,
[39:42] all my agents, you all gather together.
[39:44] You don't want that old fanaticism down
[39:45] here. All that old divine healing, that
[39:47] old Holy Ghost stuff that passed back
[39:49] with the apostles years ago, you know,
[39:51] that's no good back there trying to get
[39:53] them old iron weeds and everything like
[39:54] that. Saved it. But you know what? It
[39:56] went right on down there.
[39:59] Went right on down there and begins to
[40:01] ride alpha alpha from And you know what?
[40:02] Them sheep started eating, they get as
[40:04] fat as they can be.
[40:06] Yes, sir. While they're having healings
[40:08] and meetings and you know a lot of them
[40:10] young fellas begin while they seen they
[40:12] got a big bunch of hay like that alone
[40:15] with it. It was so good to run over to
[40:16] their neighbors. They taste this. Taste
[40:18] this.
[40:20] Like this. Right here. Here it is. Right
[40:22] here. Right here. Every one of you be
[40:24] baptized in the name of Jesus. See you
[40:26] get the Holy Ghost for whosoever will.
[40:27] Let him come. Let him come here to see
[40:29] what the Bible says. See, and they're
[40:30] just having a great time down there. Oh,
[40:34] that's my son. That's my boy.
[40:38] Oh, you think he's well matured? Yep.
[40:40] Sure do. Said Holy Spirit. I'll give him
[40:43] test. Boy, I tried him this way. tried
[40:45] him that way. I throw him down sick. I
[40:47] put him on the I stomped him. I let the
[40:49] devil do everything good could do. He
[40:50] come right back up again.
[40:54] Come up again. I made him sick. I done
[40:56] this. I told him in the hospital. I took
[40:57] him out here. I've done this. I've done
[40:59] that. I turned his wife against him. I
[41:01] turned his neighbors against him. I
[41:02] turned everything. That didn't make a
[41:03] bit of difference. He said, "Oh, he
[41:06] slave me and I trust him." Amen. I
[41:08] killed his family. I tucked this. I did
[41:10] this. I done all this. I did this. Still
[41:13] he stood right up. Though he slave me,
[41:15] yet I'll serve him. He's mine. Oh, well,
[41:19] I believe we ought to call him out
[41:20] somewhere to a little special place and
[41:22] have an adoption.
[41:24] Now when the father in the Old Testament
[41:26] understood that his son was come of age
[41:30] and had been seasoned out unto adoption
[41:34] unto they're born a child but what their
[41:38] son right then but then they'll never be
[41:40] no more than just a child just an
[41:42] ordinary son until they mature and show
[41:45] what they are then he calls him out then
[41:49] now here we are church are you ready
[41:53] now it's a little bit state. Everybody
[41:55] bite your finger, pinch your soul, and
[41:57] pluck your heart just for a minute. See?
[41:59] Amen. Now, we're going to place the
[42:01] church. Now, when the church gets to
[42:03] that place, he says, "Manasses, you
[42:06] belong over here.
[42:08] Ephraim, you over here." Then he takes
[42:12] them out to a certain place, the father
[42:13] does, and he sets them up on a high
[42:16] place like this. and he has a ceremony
[42:19] and they all come around and he said, "I
[42:22] want everyone to know that this is my
[42:25] child and I adopt my son.
[42:29] I want anyone to know from hence forth
[42:33] that his name I dress him up with
[42:36] special dress on him. And I want you to
[42:38] know that his name is just as good on
[42:41] any check as my name is. He's my child.
[42:45] I'll adopt him into my family. Although
[42:48] he's been my son since he was born,
[42:50] since he received the Holy Ghost, he's
[42:52] been my son. But now I'm going to place
[42:55] him positionally in authority.
[42:59] What he fires is fires.
[43:03] What he hires is hard. Amen. Verily,
[43:06] verily, I say to you, this if you say to
[43:09] this mountain, be moved and don't doubt
[43:11] in your heart, but believe that what you
[43:13] said will come to pass. You can have
[43:15] what you said. Amen. There you are.
[43:18] There you are. See, he's my son. How
[43:20] many knows that the adoption if they
[43:22] adopted the son after he had proved to
[43:24] be a Everybody ever read the Bible
[43:26] placing a son. Now, God did the same
[43:29] thing to his son when he took Jesus up
[43:32] on Mount Transfiguration. He talked
[43:34] Peter, James, and John up there. That's
[43:36] three witnesses of the earth. There was
[43:38] Jesus, Moses, and Elijah, and God up on
[43:41] the mountain. There they stood up on the
[43:43] mountain and first thing you know they
[43:47] looked and Jesus was glorified before
[43:50] them. Is that right? How many know
[43:52] that's the scripture? What did he do? He
[43:54] dressed in in the robe of immortality.
[43:57] And he said his raignment shine like the
[43:59] sun. Is that right?
[44:02] And a cloud overshadowed him and Peter
[44:04] and John fell on their face and they
[44:07] looked and there stood Moses and Elisha
[44:09] talking to him. And Moses had been dead
[44:12] on buried in an unmarked grave for 800
[44:15] years. And Elijah took a chariot ride to
[44:19] heaven 500 years before that. Amen. But
[44:23] they were still there.
[44:26] There they was talking to him. Amen.
[44:29] See, he had taken Jesus up to see them
[44:32] to see what it was all about. See there?
[44:34] Showed him these things and they talked
[44:36] with him, had a conversation with him.
[44:40] Then as soon as Peter looked back again
[44:43] and the glorification was all for Jesus,
[44:46] they seen Jesus only. And a voice come
[44:48] from that cloud said, "This
[44:51] is my beloved son."
[44:55] Here ye him.
[44:59] His name is just as good as mine.
[45:05] Here ye him.
[45:08] That's it. adopted or placed sons. Now,
[45:12] that's where God is trying to get the
[45:14] Pentecostal church in the book of
[45:16] Ephesians. Yes. See, do you do you
[45:19] understand? We got to close because it's
[45:21] getting too late. See, the kid is
[45:22] getting sleepy. And I wanted to get down
[45:25] here to this verse right here, but I
[45:26] can't do it till the uh the 13th verse.
[45:29] See the last part? Sealed by the Holy
[45:32] Ghost of promise. We'll get that Sunday.
[45:35] Look now, how what brings us in and how
[45:37] we're kept by this? But now to place how
[45:40] are you? You're first born into the
[45:44] kingdom by the Holy Ghost. How many know
[45:46] that? All right. The next you are
[45:49] predestinated unto the what?
[45:52] Adoption. What is that? You are
[45:55] predestinated unto the placing.
[45:59] Oh,
[46:02] Sister Scott, I believe this. Aren't you
[46:04] the one who's born today? A teaching
[46:07] going around somewhere in the world
[46:09] around different parts of the country.
[46:11] I've heard of it lots that Jesus is here
[46:14] on earth walking around in a body and he
[46:16] comes in and does this. That's a lie.
[46:20] This Holy Spirit here. Amen. And he is
[46:24] trying to place his church to get his
[46:28] church in order. placed it in the
[46:31] promised land so they could enter so
[46:33] that all the enemies can be drove out.
[46:37] Manasses can't take his land. I can't
[46:40] have a healing service when half of the
[46:41] when the I go out there and preach the
[46:43] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and
[46:45] the trinitarian brethren said, "Oh, he's
[46:47] on Jesus only.
[46:49] I can't go over here and have a divine
[46:51] healing when a half of them says divine
[46:53] healing is all right." A lot of them
[46:54] enjoy the miracles of the Lord. They
[46:56] say, "Well, I believe Brother Ben's a
[46:57] prophet." But let me tell you something.
[47:00] As long as the spirit is on him and he's
[47:02] discerning, he's the Lord's servant. But
[47:04] his teaching is rotten, it's no good.
[47:06] Who ever heard of such Tommy rot?
[47:09] Amen.
[47:11] It's either of God or it isn't of God.
[47:16] It's either all God or none God.
[47:19] That's the way it is. But how you going
[47:21] to have Manassus won't keep his ground.
[47:23] Ephraim won't keep his ground. Gad won't
[47:26] keep his ground. Benjamin won't keep in
[47:28] town. They're all running out here with
[47:29] the Philistines and all mixed up. How
[47:31] are we going to get placed? Amen. But we
[47:34] have been born by the Holy Ghost. All of
[47:36] us. Is that right? What are we be born
[47:39] to? Predestinated then after being born,
[47:41] we are predestinated unto the adoption
[47:46] to be placed. Amen. In the body of
[47:50] Christ.
[47:52] You see what I mean? What is the body of
[47:55] Christ? Some are apostles,
[47:59] some are prophets, some are teachers,
[48:02] some are evangelists, and some are
[48:05] pastors. Is that right? We're called to
[48:08] others have gifts of tongues,
[48:11] interpretation of tongues,
[48:14] wisdom, knowledge, miracles, working of
[48:18] miracles, all these different gifts. And
[48:20] now what they do? They practice that a
[48:22] little bit. Why? Let it run loose just
[48:24] like I don't know what one raised up
[48:27] speak in tongues the other way talking
[48:31] preacher be preaching make all the calls
[48:33] somebody raised up speaking in tong
[48:34] hallelujah Lord God if the if the
[48:36] preacher happens to go on with his
[48:37] message being anointed then the people
[48:39] say oh backslider see it's because
[48:42] they're not taught the Bible said the
[48:45] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[48:47] prophets God is no author of confusion
[48:52] and I'm standing You're on our ministry,
[48:54] you're under the anointing of God. No
[48:55] matter how much you want to speak with
[48:57] tongues, you hold your peace for God's
[48:59] finished years.
[49:02] Then if you speak with tongues, it can't
[49:04] be just some repeating of scripture
[49:05] because God said, "Don't use vain
[49:07] repetition." Amen. But it's a message
[49:09] directly to somebody.
[49:12] Ask me one time. Put your finger on one
[49:15] time that the Holy Spirit ever under the
[49:17] discernment told somebody to repeat the
[49:19] scripture over and over. It told them
[49:21] something that was wrong with them and
[49:22] something that they had done and
[49:23] something that they must do or something
[49:25] had to happen or something like that. Is
[49:26] that right?
[49:28] So speaking in tongues and
[49:29] interpretation. If there's one in the
[49:31] church that speaks with tongues and
[49:32] another interpret it, let us say this.
[49:34] Let brother Neville raise up and speak
[49:36] with tongues and this brother here get
[49:37] the interpretation. Say tell man that
[49:40] yesterday you went out here and done
[49:42] something ought to have done. Now the
[49:44] doctor told him he had cancer. Go make
[49:46] that thing right and come back here and
[49:47] get right with God. come and say truly
[49:49] that's the truth
[49:51] then God's with you but how are we going
[49:54] to do it this way see it's just
[49:59] haphazard anyways no placing at all now
[50:02] that's see Ephesians are trying see they
[50:05] miss that see how they miss it we are
[50:08] predestinated unto the adoption of sons
[50:13] now how many understands what I mean
[50:15] raise up your hand adoption we're armed
[50:18] in the spirit of God, sure to receive
[50:19] the Holy Ghost. We cry out ab father.
[50:21] Hallelujah. Glory to God. We're That's
[50:23] right. We're children, but we can't get
[50:25] nowhere. We can't whip the Philistines.
[50:28] Look at Billy Graham standing over there
[50:30] in that Mohamad saying proven.
[50:34] Look at Jack Cole stand down there in
[50:36] that atheist that Church of Christ
[50:37] shaking hands with the atheist out there
[50:39] and taking hands supposed to be a
[50:41] Christian and shaking hands with a devil
[50:44] like Joe Lewis and a free thinker and
[50:46] even cussed God and said there was no
[50:48] such a thing as a god anyhow to begin
[50:50] with and things like that and a church
[50:52] that called themselves a church of
[50:54] Christ shaking hands with them and
[50:56] taking
[50:57] sides against brother Jack.
[51:01] not going to do anything. And the
[51:04] Pentecostals, many of them against him.
[51:07] That's right. Whenever a preacher in
[51:09] Orlando stood toe-to-toe with him and
[51:11] said, "God, send down your power."
[51:15] Amen. See, there we are where it can't
[51:17] be placed. Ephraim don't want to stay.
[51:19] One of them go over here. We find the
[51:21] pastor gets over here. Oh my. The Lord's
[51:24] g me a good cornfield. And here comes
[51:26] over here again. Said, "Well, now wait.
[51:30] I suppose wait. oats. But I'm going to
[51:31] get corn, too. Hallelujah. See,
[51:34] you ain't got nothing to do with corn.
[51:36] Get oats.
[51:38] Oats is your part to raise. You ain't
[51:41] supposed to hurt sheep when you're
[51:42] supposed to hurt cattle. That's right.
[51:45] God wants to place the church. But every
[51:48] one of them wants to do the same thing.
[51:50] Hallelujah. You can't tell them a thing
[51:51] about it. No. No. Just still got that
[51:53] goaty nature. But but but but see, you
[51:57] can't tell them. That's right.
[52:00] Isn't that true? Amen. And you can't
[52:03] place the church. See, the church is
[52:06] supposed to be predestinated unto the
[52:09] adoption of children where a man, God
[52:12] can take a man and adopt him into the
[52:15] family. Give him something that's first.
[52:18] Try that and see if it's right. The
[52:20] Bible said, "Try the spirit." Amen. This
[52:23] man claims a certain thing. Try it and
[52:26] see if it's right. If it's right, move
[52:28] right with it. and say, "Lord, send us
[52:30] something else." Amen. Keep moving. See,
[52:33] just keep moving. Never thought it take
[52:35] his place. Then you're going to see the
[52:37] church of God begin to get its place.
[52:40] Then when the Philistines will go to
[52:41] backing up. Amen. The shorts will go
[52:44] off. Hair will go down. Faces will be
[52:47] washed. Cigars will be missing. That's
[52:50] right. When the church begins to get
[52:53] into its mighty power, when we have an
[52:54] anonym
[52:56] of them. Yes, sir. Yes. You'll see when
[52:59] that holy church stands together in his
[53:00] power positionally placed as sons of God
[53:04] adopted into the family of God. Powerful
[53:07] church standing there in its glory.
[53:10] That's what he's coming for. Amen. See
[53:12] how far we are off, brethren. You can't
[53:15] even get together on scripture.
[53:18] And any man, any man
[53:23] that can't see the water baptism in the
[53:25] Bible in the name of Jesus Christ, he's
[53:28] either blind or something mentally
[53:30] wrong.
[53:33] And that's where the big fight is. Amen.
[53:35] I I'll tell any person that'll bring
[53:39] thee any scripture where anybody was
[53:42] ever baptized in any other name besides
[53:45] the name of Jesus Christ in the new
[53:47] church.
[53:48] or if he was baptized any other way, he
[53:50] had to be baptized over again in the
[53:52] name of Jesus Christ to get the Holy
[53:53] Ghost. You come show me.
[53:57] There's not no such. There's no such a
[53:59] commission. When Jesus said over there,
[54:02] "Go ye therefore teach all nations
[54:03] baptize them in the name." Amen.
[54:07] Of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[54:09] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Neither
[54:11] one's a name. None of them. Yeah. Peter
[54:13] turned right 10 days later said repent
[54:15] be baptized every one of you in the name
[54:17] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[54:19] sins and every word in the Bible and
[54:22] then here was some was baptized down
[54:23] there some other way but John just
[54:26] repentance Paul said you got to be
[54:28] rebaptized again you got to come again
[54:30] oh but we've been baptized by a great
[54:32] holy man John he baptized Jesus like
[54:35] this is the gospel this is the spirit of
[54:39] God that's been to be revealed to me I
[54:41] am an apostle El of the Lord. And if an
[54:44] angel from heaven comes and preaches
[54:46] anything else, yes, let me read that.
[54:49] The Bible said if an Paul said if an
[54:52] angel from heaven said anything else,
[54:55] bishop, archbishop, pope, overseer,
[54:58] whatever he may be, if he preaches
[55:01] anything else besides this that I've
[55:03] preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[55:05] Amen. There's no We have no such customs
[55:08] as that, no sir. You just there's just
[55:11] no such thing. We And then then see why
[55:14] is it people can't see that? Why is it
[55:17] people won't won't believe that? See
[55:21] somebody hit it right there again.
[55:24] Predestinated.
[55:26] Exactly. Why? All the father has given
[55:30] me will
[55:33] what? Come to me. How exactly? All the
[55:38] father has given me will come will come
[55:41] to me. What's the matter me trying to
[55:43] find here? Here we have.
[55:46] All right.
[55:48] Let me just read this verse and then
[55:49] I'll tell you what Paul the things that
[55:51] the very message I preached tonight.
[55:53] Here's what Paul said on predestination
[55:55] on water baptism in Jesus name the Holy
[55:57] Ghost baptism the setting in the church
[55:59] and so forth. Here's what he said. I
[56:02] marvel telling these Galatians that
[56:04] you're so soon moved from him that
[56:07] called you unto grace of Christ. I am so
[56:11] ashamed of you in other words that you
[56:13] let somebody come in and twist you away
[56:16] from that unto another gospel which is
[56:19] not another
[56:22] but there'll be some that trouble you
[56:24] and would prevent the gospel of Christ
[56:27] prevent the real gospel of Christ. But
[56:29] watch now. Remember, it was Paul
[56:33] that constrained every person that had
[56:37] not been baptized in the name of Jesus
[56:39] Christ to come and be baptized over
[56:41] again in the name of Jesus Christ. How
[56:42] many know that?
[56:45] How many know it was Paul that said,
[56:47] "These secrets have been hid since the
[56:48] foundation of the world and been
[56:49] revealed to him that we were
[56:51] predestinated to be the sons of God unto
[56:54] adoption." It was Paul. Look at what he
[56:56] says. But though we are an angel from
[56:59] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[57:03] than that which we have preached unto
[57:05] you, let him be a curse. Amen. Just
[57:08] don't say I don't agree with you,
[57:10] mister. Just let him be a curse. Let me
[57:12] read the next verse. As we said before,
[57:15] so say I now again, if any man preach
[57:19] any other gospel unto you than that we
[57:22] have already received, let him be a
[57:26] cursed.
[57:29] That's right. Now, brother, sister, if
[57:33] it was God the other day, and I I say
[57:37] that hop and not irreverence that taken
[57:40] me to see this little I get excited. I
[57:43] don't get to get excited. I just get
[57:44] blessed in preaching.
[57:46] I get beside myself and I keep you here
[57:48] till I know you're sleepy and tired. But
[57:51] oh, I if you if you could only know how
[57:54] I want you over there.
[57:57] And when I once I say this again, when I
[58:00] when he said I said it, would he said,
[58:03] "Would you like to see what the end is?"
[58:06] And I look back and see myself laying
[58:08] there on the bed. Surely you've known me
[58:10] long enough to know that and I'll tell
[58:12] you the truth. I want to ask you
[58:15] something. As Samuel said before the
[58:16] anointed, have I ever told you anything
[58:18] in the name of the Lord but what was
[58:20] true? Is that right? Always been true.
[58:23] Have I ever come begged you for money or
[58:25] anything like that? I never have. Have I
[58:28] ever did anything but tried my best to
[58:31] lead you to Christ? Exactly. Now they
[58:34] want to say I'm a mental telepathicist.
[58:36] you know, uh, super sensient
[58:38] perceptionist.
[58:39] Of course, them things has got to rise.
[58:41] The Bible said they would as Jambers and
[58:44] Jamis withtood Moses. They did pretty
[58:46] nearly the same thing Moses did for it
[58:48] to come to a showdown. That's right. But
[58:50] remember, Jambas and Jambis could not
[58:53] heal. They could not heal. They could
[58:55] bring plagues but not take them away.
[58:58] See? All right. Now, God is the healer.
[59:01] God's word remains true. I have tried to
[59:03] be honest with you. I've tried to tell
[59:05] you the truth. I for about 31 years I've
[59:10] stood at this pull pit off and on for 31
[59:12] years and someday may leave to go to
[59:16] glory inside this pulpit. There's been a
[59:18] wife, a daughter, father, brothers, all
[59:24] bearded right across their precious
[59:26] friends. I've watched your caskets and
[59:28] the flowers set here and know someday
[59:30] that mine will be too.
[59:33] That's true. But sincerely from all my
[59:36] heart, I tell you with all my heart, I
[59:40] believe I preach to you the true gospel
[59:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:45] I believe that you should be baptized,
[59:48] every one of you, in the name of Jesus
[59:49] Christ and receive the baptism of the
[59:51] Holy Ghost. And whenever you do,
[59:54] it'll bring to you a joy, peace,
[59:57] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[59:59] gentleness, patience, faith. And the
[1:00:02] other day, what happened to me on that
[1:00:04] morning, I don't know. I can't say yet.
[1:00:07] Whether I was here at my body and just
[1:00:10] seen a vision or whether I was taken
[1:00:12] away from here over there, I don't know.
[1:00:14] I can't say. Only thing I know that I I
[1:00:17] was always afraid of dying, that little
[1:00:19] place of sting, but not afraid that
[1:00:21] Jesus wouldn't come get me. Now, I
[1:00:23] wasn't afraid of that cuz I I didn't
[1:00:25] fear that. But if I'd meet you and just
[1:00:27] be a little old myth flying out through
[1:00:29] the air. But I see now. And I've seen
[1:00:33] those people. They were real. Yes. Amen.
[1:00:36] They were people who once associated
[1:00:38] with me here on earth. Even to my first
[1:00:40] wife. She wasn't my wife. She was my
[1:00:44] sister.
[1:00:46] She never called me her husband. She
[1:00:48] called me her darling brother.
[1:00:52] There was no sex, no feelings of that
[1:00:54] type. It couldn't be. It was perfect. It
[1:00:56] was sweetness. It was perfection.
[1:00:59] I'm wondering. I don't know. I'm
[1:01:03] wondering is that what she seen
[1:01:06] before she left the earth when she was
[1:01:09] young in the hospital when I called her
[1:01:12] and she said, "Billy, you have preached
[1:01:14] it. You've talked about it." But she
[1:01:17] said, "You don't know what it is." She
[1:01:19] said, "I have no more desire to say."
[1:01:22] Amen. I wonder if that's what it is that
[1:01:24] that godly, saintly old man of FF
[1:01:26] Bosworth who stood in this pulpit who's
[1:01:29] preached with me around different parts
[1:01:31] of the world. Old FF Bosworth, all of
[1:01:34] you nearly knew him. Godly, saintly old
[1:01:37] man. Two hours before, well, about a
[1:01:40] week or two before he left, I went to
[1:01:41] him and there he laid back there way
[1:01:43] nearly 90 years old. His little arms
[1:01:45] reached out, his little bald head and
[1:01:47] that white whiskers on his face. I'd
[1:01:49] grab that old man in my arms and I
[1:01:51] scream, "My father, my father, the
[1:01:54] chariots of Israel and the horsemen
[1:01:56] thereof." For if there ever was a man
[1:01:58] that ever represented Pentecost and was
[1:02:00] a true apostle, it was FF Bosworth.
[1:02:04] Clean, straight, real gospel. See, it
[1:02:07] was Bosworth. And when I held him in my
[1:02:10] arm and I screamed, "My father, my
[1:02:12] father, the chariots of Israel and the
[1:02:15] horsemen thereof," he said, "Son, stay
[1:02:18] on the field." Said, "Beat some of these
[1:02:21] young fellas to the foreign fields if
[1:02:23] you can before they get a lot of
[1:02:24] fanaticism over there. Take them that
[1:02:26] real gospel that you've got."
[1:02:29] He said, "Your ministry hasn't began yet
[1:02:31] or what it will." Said, "You're a brand
[1:02:33] new Brandon." Said, "You're a young
[1:02:34] son." I said, "Brother Boswell, I'm 48
[1:02:36] years old." He said, "You haven't
[1:02:38] started yet." He said, "Don't let these
[1:02:41] young Pentecostal preachers get over
[1:02:43] there. That's a lot of nonsense and
[1:02:44] poison the thing up and get all the the
[1:02:47] diplomats and all the country against it
[1:02:49] before you get there." Said, "Move on,
[1:02:51] brother Brandon. Go on with the gospel
[1:02:53] that you got." He said, "I I believe
[1:02:57] that you are an apostle or a prophet of
[1:02:59] the Lord our God."
[1:03:02] I looked at him. I hugged him in my arm.
[1:03:04] I said, "Brother Bosworth, I want to ask
[1:03:06] you a question.
[1:03:08] What was the happiest time of your
[1:03:10] moment of your all your years that you
[1:03:12] preached?" He said, "Right now, Brother
[1:03:14] Danny."
[1:03:16] I said, "Do you know you're dying?" He
[1:03:17] said, "I cannot die."
[1:03:23] Amen. I said, "What? Why would you say
[1:03:26] this is your happiest time? There's a
[1:03:27] little door." He said, "I'm laying here
[1:03:29] with my face turned towards that door
[1:03:32] most any minute. the one that I've
[1:03:34] loved, the one that I preached for and
[1:03:36] stood for all these my life. He'll come
[1:03:39] to that door for me and I'll go with
[1:03:42] him.
[1:03:44] I looked at him. I thought I I look at
[1:03:47] his name as I would be at Abraham,
[1:03:48] Isaac, or Jacob. I tuck his hand. I
[1:03:51] said, "Brother Bosworth,
[1:03:53] we both believe the same God. We believe
[1:03:55] the same thing. By the grace of God,
[1:03:58] I'll preach until the last breath leaves
[1:04:00] my body. I'll stay true to God as I know
[1:04:03] how to stay. I'll not compromise with
[1:04:05] the gospel on any side or any place.
[1:04:07] I'll stay as true as I know to stay.
[1:04:10] Brother Bosworth, I'll meet you in a
[1:04:12] better land or you'll not be young, not
[1:04:15] be old anymore, but young and said,
[1:04:17] "You'll be there, brother. Don't you
[1:04:18] worry."
[1:04:20] An hour before, two hours before he
[1:04:22] died, about two months later, I thought
[1:04:24] he's dying. A wife come in, seen him. He
[1:04:28] always thought so much of her. And then
[1:04:30] Mrs. Bosworth about two hours he'd been
[1:04:33] laying sleeping. He raised up. He looked
[1:04:36] and he jumped up from his bed.
[1:04:40] He said, "Mother,
[1:04:43] well, I haven't seen you for years."
[1:04:48] Dad,
[1:04:50] brother Jim, why said I see you was one
[1:04:54] of my converts to the Lord in Joliet,
[1:04:56] Illinois. You'd been dead for 50 years.
[1:04:59] Oh, yes. He said, "Your sister so and
[1:05:03] so." Yes. I led you to the Lord at at
[1:05:06] the Winnipeg meeting. Yeah. Why? Your
[1:05:09] sister so and so. I haven't seen you
[1:05:11] yet. See you come to the Lord at so and
[1:05:13] so. And for two straight hours, he shook
[1:05:16] hands with ones that he had led to the
[1:05:19] Lord. Amen. walked right back to his
[1:05:21] place, laid down, cross his hand, and
[1:05:24] that was
[1:05:28] Did Brother Fosworth enter that land
[1:05:32] that Jesus let me view the other night?
[1:05:35] Hallelujah. If it is, is there a young
[1:05:37] man tonight?
[1:05:39] God bless his soul. And may I ever live
[1:05:43] so faithful that I'll enter that land.
[1:05:46] And may I be so true a servant to
[1:05:49] Christ. I'm ashamed of my life. I'm
[1:05:53] ashamed be I sin before you people. You
[1:05:57] you ought to me to come tell me. See, I
[1:06:00] try to live upright and everything that
[1:06:03] God lets me do by his grace. See, but
[1:06:06] look, friends, you ought to me if you
[1:06:07] know anything that's wrong with my life,
[1:06:09] come help me, sir. And look, I owe it to
[1:06:11] you to stand here and preach you the
[1:06:13] true gospel. How about you? Because I'm
[1:06:16] expecting to see each one of your faces,
[1:06:19] young men and women, just across that
[1:06:21] border, yonder. That's just one breath
[1:06:24] between where you are now and there.
[1:06:26] Now, that's right. It's there. And may
[1:06:29] the God of all grace, the God of heaven,
[1:06:33] not sacriiggious, but in reverence Papa
[1:06:37] on that great day when we be presented
[1:06:39] back here and have our earthly bodies
[1:06:41] again so we can drink and eat the grapes
[1:06:44] and the fruit of the land. They will
[1:06:45] build houses and another won't inhabit.
[1:06:49] They'll plant vineyards and another
[1:06:51] won't eat thereof. See, one man plants a
[1:06:54] vineyard, his son takes it and then his
[1:06:55] son takes it and his but not in this
[1:06:57] case. Amen. He'll plant it and stay
[1:07:00] there.
[1:07:02] That's right. We'll be there forever.
[1:07:05] And may in that land may I see every one
[1:07:07] of you. And I know that I'm talking in
[1:07:09] here even a trinitarian minister.
[1:07:12] And my brethren, I do not say this. I do
[1:07:16] not say this to her. I'm a trinitarian
[1:07:18] too. I believe in the trinity, the three
[1:07:21] attributes of God, father, son, and holy
[1:07:23] ghost, but not three gods. Amen. See, I
[1:07:26] believe to be three attributes.
[1:07:27] Absolutely. I do that with all my heart.
[1:07:30] Father, son, and holy spirit, but they
[1:07:33] are not three gods. They're just three
[1:07:35] attribut
[1:07:40] sunship and now the holy ghost. It's the
[1:07:42] same God and three offices. And they
[1:07:45] have and father, son, and holy ghost is
[1:07:47] not no name of God. Amen. God has one
[1:07:52] name and his name is Jesus. Yeah. The
[1:07:55] Bible said the family in heaven is named
[1:07:57] Jesus and the family in earth is named
[1:08:00] Jesus.
[1:08:01] That's right. So God had one name human
[1:08:04] name. He was had a name called Jehovah
[1:08:06] Gyra. Jehovah Rabbi. That was his titles
[1:08:09] of deity. But he had one name Jesus.
[1:08:13] That's him. And truly, my brethren, if
[1:08:16] you disagree with me, remember I I'll
[1:08:20] meet you over there anyhow. See, I I'll
[1:08:22] be there with you. and God bless you and
[1:08:25] I love you and I want the church to
[1:08:26] remember now Sunday morning we're going
[1:08:28] to pick up from here and I'm going to
[1:08:30] try not to keep you no longer than 2:00
[1:08:32] so you have an afternoon meeting if we
[1:08:35] possibly can and if I do as well as I've
[1:08:37] done tonight 10:30 do you forgive me
[1:08:41] friends we ain't got much time left
[1:08:45] honey have I
[1:08:48] call you honey because you are you are

[1:10:30] the Lord Jesus. The doctors had told mom
[1:10:32] that she wouldn't be able to walk before
[1:10:36] her discharge date on June 30th. Her
[1:10:39] legs were just too weak. She had asked
[1:10:42] the Lord to answer her prayer of walking
[1:10:45] out of the rehab facility before she was
[1:10:47] discharged.
[1:10:49] In just two days, things have changed.
[1:10:52] Yesterday, she was able to stand and put
[1:10:54] weight on her legs. And today she was
[1:10:56] able to walk half of the length of the
[1:10:59] parallel bars that her physical
[1:11:02] therapist put her on. Even though her
[1:11:05] right leg is still weak, strength is
[1:11:07] coming back. And that has been nothing
[1:11:10] but the Lord. We give God all the glory
[1:11:13] for his touching hand. Amen.
[1:11:16] God answers prayer. Amen.

[1:26:20] Brother Trevor, if you can come up and
[1:26:24] close close out the service, the song or
[1:26:27] two. And
[1:26:29] when we when we have our dismissive
[1:26:31] prayer, there's request. I forgot.
[1:26:35] It's a brother named Leo Dati who
[1:26:40] uh fell down at his home, caused him to
[1:26:44] have seizures, went to the hospital, and
[1:26:46] they found an artery that was torn and
[1:26:50] something else with his artery and he
[1:26:52] needs to be switched to another
[1:26:53] hospital,
[1:26:55] but they he's too delicate to even do
[1:26:58] that. So, he's kind of in a predicament.
[1:27:01] This was from brother
[1:27:03] But this brother Leo, he does live here
[1:27:06] in Tucson.
[1:27:08] If you can some
[1:27:15] I uh I actually have a testimony I'd
[1:27:19] like to share. Not mine. It's back from
[1:27:22] 1883,
[1:27:24] but if I you know, forgive me if I'm
[1:27:28] stepping on an informality, but this is
[1:27:31] for a background to a song. And I think
[1:27:35] there's a lot of songs that are written
[1:27:37] with um such a
[1:27:42] incredible backstory and you know
[1:27:45] beautiful songs that we have that we
[1:27:46] take for granted. I think sometimes we
[1:27:48] don't really understand the you know the
[1:27:51] trial that went into making that. For me
[1:27:53] like the Lord gave me a song but I was
[1:27:56] you know at my house and it just fell on
[1:27:59] my heart. But I like to just read this
[1:28:00] one. keep it short. Um, but this is a
[1:28:05] story about Major Daniel Whittle. He um,
[1:28:10] he surrendered his life to God. Um,
[1:28:14] it doesn't I don't remember when. I
[1:28:17] didn't get that date, but back in the
[1:28:20] 1800s. And he gave his life to God in a
[1:28:23] Wells Fargo bank one night. And one day
[1:28:27] in 1862, him and his fianceé, they got
[1:28:30] married. And the exact following day, he
[1:28:33] was uh called to the Civil War. And
[1:28:36] while leading the charge, he was wounded
[1:28:38] in his right arm and taken as a prisoner
[1:28:41] of war. And while in the prisoner of war
[1:28:42] camp, he grew bored while on the men and
[1:28:45] noticed a New Testament Bible next to
[1:28:46] his cot and began reading it. One night,
[1:28:49] he was woken up by the nurse asking him
[1:28:50] to pray for another young prisoner of
[1:28:53] war. He declined to pray, but the nurse
[1:28:56] said, "I thought you were a Christian
[1:28:57] because you were reading your Bible."
[1:29:00] And after some back and forth in his
[1:29:02] mind, he decided to pray for him. This
[1:29:05] was in his words what he's uh noted as
[1:29:07] saying, quote, "I dropped on my knees
[1:29:10] and held the boy's hand and mine, and a
[1:29:12] few broken words, I confessed my sins
[1:29:14] and asked Jesus to forgive me. I
[1:29:17] believed right there that he did forgive
[1:29:20] me. I then prayed earnestly for the boy.
[1:29:22] He became quiet and pressed my hand as I
[1:29:25] prayed and pleaded for God's promises.
[1:29:27] When I rose from my knees, he was dead.
[1:29:31] He took a He There was a look of peace
[1:29:33] that had come over his troubled face.
[1:29:36] And I cannot but believe that God used
[1:29:40] God who used him to bring me to that to
[1:29:42] the Savior used me to lead him to trust
[1:29:46] Christ's precious blood and find pardon.
[1:29:48] I hope to meet him in heaven. And then
[1:29:50] he later went on to write the verses to
[1:29:53] the song I know whom I believe in as a
[1:29:56] testimony of his experience. So I hope
[1:29:58] that was a blessing to you. So
[1:30:01] let's all stand as we as we sing that.
[1:30:06] I know not why God's wonderous grace to
[1:30:12] me he hath made known.
[1:30:18] For why unworthy
[1:30:22] Christ in love,
[1:30:25] redeemed
[1:30:27] me for his own.
[1:30:31] But I know who I have believeth
[1:30:37] and am persuaded
[1:30:41] that he is able
[1:30:44] to keep that which I've committed
[1:30:51] unto him
[1:30:53] against that day.
[1:30:58] I know not how that is saving faith to
[1:31:05] me he did in part.
[1:31:11] Nor how believing
[1:31:15] in his word brought peace within my
[1:31:21] heart.
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:24] But I know
[1:31:27] I have believe it and am persuaded
[1:31:33] that he is able
[1:31:37] to keep that which I've committed
[1:31:44] unto him
[1:31:46] against that day.
[1:31:51] I know not how the spirit rules
[1:31:58] convincing
[1:32:00] men of sin
[1:32:04] reing
[1:32:06] Jesus
[1:32:08] through the word
[1:32:11] creating
[1:32:13] faith in him.
[1:32:17] But I know
[1:32:20] I have believe it and am persuaded
[1:32:27] that he is aable
[1:32:30] to keep that which I've committed
[1:32:37] unto him
[1:32:40] against that day.
[1:32:42] [Music]
[1:32:44] I know not what of good or ill may be
[1:32:53] reserved for me
[1:32:58] of weery
[1:33:00] ways or golden days
[1:33:05] before
[1:33:06] his face. Let's take that last verse.
[1:33:11] I know not when my Lord may come
[1:33:18] at night or noon day fair.
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:25] Nor if I'll walk the veil with him or
[1:33:32] meet him in the air.
[1:33:38] But I know who I have believed
[1:33:44] and am persuaded
[1:33:48] that he is aable
[1:33:52] to keep that which I've committed
[1:33:59] unto him
[1:34:01] against that day.
[1:34:05] But I know
[1:34:08] I have believed it
[1:34:12] and am persuaded
[1:34:15] that he is able
[1:34:19] to keep that which I've committed
[1:34:25] unto him
[1:34:28] against that day.
[1:34:32] Amen.
[1:34:34] Brother Tim, would you come forward and
[1:34:36] close the service with a word of prayer?
[1:34:41] Brother Joe, what was the the name of
[1:34:43] that brother Leo? I will remember him in
[1:34:48] prayer.
