[1:11:25] it helped me out so much and um really
[1:11:30] um encourag my heart to keep moving
[1:11:33] forward to refocus on things that are
[1:11:35] important sometimes we make things we
[1:11:38] stress over things that really are not
[1:11:40] that important but then when you go and
[1:11:43] you start to uh expand and meet other
[1:11:46] people you'll you'll focus on things
[1:11:48] that are really important amen and the
[1:11:51] Lord did that for me on this trip or and
[1:11:53] so I'm glad to be back home with you you

[1:12:05] would bless them but an Old Testament
[1:12:07] scripture if you can stand we turn into

[1:13:01] something we have on our heart there
[1:13:04] for this coming Tuesday watch Night
[1:13:07] Service Joshua chap 11 and verse
[1:13:12] number
[1:13:16] 23 so Joshua took the whole land
[1:13:20] according to all that the Lord had said
[1:13:23] unto Moses and Joshua gave it for an
[1:13:27] inheritance unto Israel according to
[1:13:30] their divisions by their tribes and the
[1:13:34] land rested from war amen one more
[1:13:39] scripture in Joshua chapter
[1:13:41] 1 very famous the commission of
[1:13:45] Joshua the Lord speaking to him the
[1:13:48] whole chapter verse one but we'll just
[1:13:51] take from verse number s only be thou
[1:13:55] strong and very courageous that thou
[1:13:57] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:14:00] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[1:14:03] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[1:14:07] or to the left that thou mayest Prosper
[1:14:10] withersoever thou
[1:14:12] goest this book of the law shall not
[1:14:15] depart out of thy mouth but thou shal
[1:14:17] meditate therein day and night that thou
[1:14:21] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:14:23] that is written
[1:14:25] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[1:14:28] prosperous and then shall thou have good
[1:14:31] success let's read verse eight alt
[1:14:34] together this book of the law shall not
[1:14:37] depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt
[1:14:41] meditate there day and night that thou
[1:14:44] mayest observe to do according to
[1:14:48] all amen for then Thou shalt make thy
[1:14:52] way prosperous and then
[1:14:56] good success how many want to be
[1:15:00] successful you know theyve written books
[1:15:03] 10 points on success seven steps to
[1:15:06] success but for for Joshua the success
[1:15:09] was to meditate on the word that I
[1:15:11] wasn't just reading it that was
[1:15:14] meditating on it not turning from it to
[1:15:17] the left or to the right and I have my
[1:15:20] title this morning is just kind of a odd
[1:15:23] title but it's Romans 7 Luke 23 and acts
[1:15:27] 5 that's my title and these are some of
[1:15:31] the last day prophecies that brother
[1:15:33] Bram brought to us Romans chapter 7 Luke
[1:15:37] 23 acts chap 5 so let us pray Lord Jesus
[1:15:43] we ask your blessings upon the word this
[1:15:45] morning we thank you for the opportunity
[1:15:48] to read your word now Lord I pray you'll
[1:15:51] settle our nerves and our anxiety Lord
[1:15:55] Lord to hear you to speak what you have
[1:15:58] us to say and may each heart be blessed
[1:16:02] father there's no one like you there's
[1:16:05] nothing greater than your word and we're
[1:16:07] leaning and depending upon that this
[1:16:10] morning you have never failed you've
[1:16:12] never lost a battle and we have
[1:16:15] confidence in that today that you'll do
[1:16:18] exactly what you said you would do we
[1:16:20] claim these promises now in Jesus name
[1:16:22] we pray amen amen why don't you shake
[1:16:26] somebody's hand and tell them praise the
[1:16:28] Lord so good to be in the house of the
[1:16:30] Lord tell them we'll be shaking hands
[1:16:33] again a couple times during the
[1:16:35] service we'll look at one another and
[1:16:38] say praise the Lord God bless you you
[1:16:40] may be seated thank you God bless you
[1:16:44] doesn't that feel better when you warm
[1:16:46] up with one another yeah you was looking
[1:16:49] at me but now we shook hands so now we
[1:16:51] can warm up a little bit all right so
[1:16:55] God bless you amen Romans chapter 7 Luke
[1:16:58] 23 acts 5 now these um these scriptures
[1:17:04] I have brought them here to the church a
[1:17:06] number of times in different messages
[1:17:09] and as I was in uh
[1:17:12] Tanzania um some of the messages had
[1:17:15] come back to me and just really
[1:17:17] impressed upon my heart again and this
[1:17:20] last one here in the message the
[1:17:22] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:17:25] is one of the most to me one of the more
[1:17:28] profound latterday messages that brother
[1:17:31] Brandon preached in uh November of
[1:17:37] 1965 he preaches this message as a
[1:17:41] Thanksgiving message so it's kind of uh
[1:17:44] preliminary Before Christmas it's kind
[1:17:47] of this time of the year it was a
[1:17:50] Thanksgiving message he wasn't in his
[1:17:52] own home pull pit so there's there's
[1:17:55] little background stories on that
[1:17:57] brother Palmer which was a deacon for
[1:17:59] brother Al sto his daddy was brother L
[1:18:03] Palmer who brother Ram speaks of on the
[1:18:06] tape there and there were some
[1:18:08] testimonies in the background where that
[1:18:11] brother uh Jack did not want he was
[1:18:15] going to councel brother R from
[1:18:16] preaching one or two of the services
[1:18:19] there um but he couldn't find his hotel
[1:18:22] room and you hear Brother bam talk about
[1:18:24] that they were supposed to pick him up
[1:18:26] for lunch but they couldn't find him
[1:18:28] they were going to try to shift him from
[1:18:29] taking that service is what I was told
[1:18:32] in the background brother Jack Moore did
[1:18:34] not fully embrace the message is what we
[1:18:38] could call embracing the message
[1:18:40] although he was a friend to the prophet
[1:18:43] and he opened the door to him in many
[1:18:45] many ways and so you'll hear brother
[1:18:48] brandham at the beginning of this series
[1:18:50] a tremendous series that he is um
[1:18:54] warning in the Brethren there not to
[1:18:56] take it personal but this message is
[1:18:59] growing across the land and it's not so
[1:19:02] much pointed to the local Ministry there
[1:19:05] he's very very careful brother brandham
[1:19:07] is about how he handles another man's
[1:19:10] Pulpit he's very very respectful in
[1:19:14] other territories and working amongst
[1:19:16] people he's always very gracious about
[1:19:19] the men that have gone on before him as
[1:19:21] you hear him talk um and I'm I'm quite
[1:19:25] sure if some men had the gifts that
[1:19:28] brother random had you probably couldn't
[1:19:30] even have lunch with them because of
[1:19:33] their attitude and with what power and
[1:19:37] pride does it it will lift you it will
[1:19:39] change you power will change you it's
[1:19:42] very addictive and you think you'll
[1:19:45] remain the same but you just soon as
[1:19:47] your little Financial thing changes a
[1:19:49] little bit soon as your friends change
[1:19:52] then people change it happens that way
[1:19:55] so it really takes the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:58] to keep you humble when he blesses you
[1:20:01] brother brandom says just as soon as God
[1:20:03] blesses a man he begins to think that
[1:20:06] he's an
[1:20:08] angel yes and as soon as you get blessed
[1:20:11] you're talented you're gifted you have
[1:20:14] whatever is going good for you you start
[1:20:16] to think it's you and that's a human
[1:20:19] flaw it's not about you know what what
[1:20:22] group what race what country that's a
[1:20:24] human flaw and this is why we have to
[1:20:27] stay on our knees amen everybody if the
[1:20:31] Apostle Paul was sent a messenger to
[1:20:34] keep him humble because of the
[1:20:37] revelations what about you or I what do
[1:20:40] you think you think receiving this
[1:20:42] message there's a a chance that we can
[1:20:44] think ourselves above someone else sure
[1:20:47] so Lord help us so but this this
[1:20:50] tremendous series that brother Brandon
[1:20:52] brings and I'll just take the last
[1:20:55] uh I'll take 1965 sermons that he
[1:20:58] preached okay so in November 21st he
[1:21:02] preach right here in the City of Tucson
[1:21:05] what house will you build me and we're
[1:21:08] going to quote out of that scripture out
[1:21:10] of that message there I think they have
[1:21:13] a quotation out of there then he goes to
[1:21:16] uh uh shreport and he preaches on the
[1:21:18] 25th the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:21:22] Christ the 26th works is Faith
[1:21:27] Express the next day he preaches on the
[1:21:29] 27th trying to do God's service without
[1:21:31] it being his
[1:21:33] will that evening he preaches I have
[1:21:36] heard but now I
[1:21:38] see um on the 28th in that same series
[1:21:42] there God's only provided place of
[1:21:44] worship these are are some tremendous
[1:21:47] messages you can go and hear them and
[1:21:49] one kind of overlaps into the other one
[1:21:52] you can kind of get a theme or thought
[1:21:55] of what the prophet had in his mind
[1:21:57] because you never really finish a
[1:22:00] message you you have your notes Here you
[1:22:02] never really finish it'll kind of bleed
[1:22:04] over into the next sermon if you follow
[1:22:07] the prophet's messages then he preaches
[1:22:10] that powerful message 1965 on the wings
[1:22:14] of a snow white
[1:22:17] dove now in December the 4th he preaches
[1:22:21] the message Rapture and then the message
[1:22:24] things that are to
[1:22:26] be modern events made clear by
[1:22:29] prophecy and then the last message that
[1:22:32] he preaches right here in our city uh
[1:22:35] communion now when he takes the message
[1:22:39] the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:22:41] Christ he takes Romans chapter
[1:22:45] 7 and he opens that scripture to us now
[1:22:48] you can quote a lot of people let me say
[1:22:50] this I quote from the prophet because I
[1:22:53] know what the revelation of who he is to
[1:22:55] me is that's what that's I don't quote
[1:22:58] from the prophet because more people
[1:23:00] would come to this church uh that's my
[1:23:03] Revelation if more people come if less
[1:23:06] people come the Revelation is for me to
[1:23:08] to preach what God placed upon my heart
[1:23:11] I know some people they'll include a
[1:23:14] tape service because that might include
[1:23:15] more people coming to their church or
[1:23:18] they might put the pictures up or take
[1:23:20] them down based on whether who's going
[1:23:22] to come to their church or not come to
[1:23:25] their church but um trust you want to
[1:23:28] follow a revelation and you do what you
[1:23:31] do by a revelation and whoever comes
[1:23:33] they come whoever stay whoever go that
[1:23:36] is what it is amen and so this Romans
[1:23:41] chapter 7 I can't handle Romans chapter
[1:23:44] 7 any other way than the way the prophet
[1:23:48] has brought it to us now that he has
[1:23:51] opened it up to us and this is what he
[1:23:53] says about Romans chapter 7 in the
[1:23:57] message the invisible Union of the bride
[1:23:59] of Christ first he says this in
[1:24:01] paragraph 22 he says now we are looking
[1:24:05] for the coming of the Lord in our
[1:24:08] generation I am not looking for Revival
[1:24:12] in our generation I'm looking for the
[1:24:14] coming of the Lord in our
[1:24:17] generation now in Romans 7 trusting that
[1:24:20] you have your Bibles open everywhere now
[1:24:23] across a country we want you to read
[1:24:26] closely now this message out of here it
[1:24:31] seems like it's on marriage and divorce
[1:24:35] but it really isn't to me it's a
[1:24:39] prophecy for the church in the last
[1:24:44] days now uh Romans chapter 7 he's pretty
[1:24:49] much dealing with verses
[1:24:51] 1-6 is talking about that you know that
[1:24:56] Brethren how that the law haveth
[1:24:58] dominion over a man as long as he liveth
[1:25:01] and for the woman which hath a husband
[1:25:03] is bound by the law to her husband so
[1:25:05] long as he liveth but if that husband be
[1:25:08] dead she is loose from the law of her
[1:25:11] husband sounds like the Apostle Paul is
[1:25:14] talking about marriage and divorce and
[1:25:16] he is in one sense and he's talking
[1:25:18] about the law of the Old Testament law
[1:25:21] and he's bringing it over and he's
[1:25:24] talking talking about being married and
[1:25:26] being divorced and then the adultery and
[1:25:29] brother random now takes this scripture
[1:25:32] and says that he believes that it is a
[1:25:35] prophecy for the church in the last day
[1:25:39] now if it is a prophecy for the church
[1:25:42] then I'm interested in it because I am a
[1:25:44] part of that
[1:25:46] church um some people are interested in
[1:25:49] the next president that's coming up or
[1:25:51] the politics that's going on or the next
[1:25:54] Blockbuster movie or are taxes going to
[1:25:58] go up or what's the best way to live the
[1:26:01] best newest diet but as a Believer our
[1:26:05] Interest really should be on the things
[1:26:09] that pertain to the coming of the Lord
[1:26:12] and the Readiness of his church because
[1:26:15] we have been given a word of
[1:26:19] Prophecy not just you know just that one
[1:26:22] statement that he says there and where
[1:26:24] he says we're not looking for Revival in
[1:26:27] our generation we're looking for the
[1:26:29] coming of the Lord in our gener how many
[1:26:31] denominations are looking for a Revival
[1:26:33] today they're praying for one they're
[1:26:35] thinking there's a great move coming yet
[1:26:37] there not too late for America we could
[1:26:39] still have a a worldwide Revival and we
[1:26:42] know that's not going to happen Elijah
[1:26:45] said it's not going to rain for three
[1:26:46] years guess what it did not rain for 3
[1:26:50] years because Elijah called for the rain
[1:26:54] when when he said it would come it came
[1:26:56] when he said it would stop it would stop
[1:26:58] that was the ministry of Elijah and so
[1:27:00] just that little thought right there we
[1:27:03] people who follow the message we're
[1:27:05] people we're prophetic people so we we
[1:27:08] take the warning of the Lord today so It
[1:27:12] prepares us for tomorrow and we're not
[1:27:15] waiting to see okay let me see what's
[1:27:17] going to happen next no the word has
[1:27:19] already been given to us to prepare our
[1:27:22] hearts for what's going to happen next
[1:27:25] so there's nothing coming out of
[1:27:26] Washington that's going to shock any of
[1:27:29] us amen they all lost their minds and
[1:27:34] they're not going to get their minds
[1:27:36] back they're not going to somehow repent
[1:27:39] we know this and so when we hear the
[1:27:42] craziness yes it hurts us but it doesn't
[1:27:45] shock us we know which way this is going
[1:27:48] it's going
[1:27:50] downward and it's not going to get
[1:27:52] better amen but for the
[1:27:55] believer there is the coming of the Lord
[1:27:58] for the believer there never was an age
[1:28:01] like this
[1:28:03] age and I want to I want to embrace that
[1:28:08] I want to take that in into my heart as
[1:28:11] a prophecy so he he he he shares with us
[1:28:14] that Romans chapter 7 is a
[1:28:18] prophecy of the church in the last days
[1:28:22] I would behoove you to read that pray
[1:28:25] read it slowly consecrate your heart
[1:28:28] read it again go back read it again and
[1:28:30] let the Lord bless you in that so later
[1:28:34] in the message he brings us this
[1:28:37] prophecy in Luke chap
[1:28:39] 23 and this is speaking of the day he
[1:28:44] picks up what Jesus said in Luke chapter
[1:28:48] 23 how the the great company that
[1:28:52] followed him
[1:28:55] and they begin to whail
[1:28:58] him and um Jesus turning unto them said
[1:29:03] Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me
[1:29:06] but weep for yourselves and for your
[1:29:08] children foro for behold the days are
[1:29:13] coming so he's speaking of a future
[1:29:16] event can I get a witness today speaking
[1:29:19] of the days are coming Jesus pointed to
[1:29:21] the Future the days are coming that they
[1:29:24] shall say blessed are the barren in the
[1:29:28] womb that never bear and the pths which
[1:29:32] never gave suck it sounds like a natural
[1:29:35] you know Jesus just a natural which it
[1:29:39] is he's speaking of birth control he's
[1:29:43] speaking of birth control and brother
[1:29:44] Ram talks about it and he crosses it
[1:29:46] over that day would come with that would
[1:29:50] be so prevalent that they would take a
[1:29:54] dog or a cat or some little animal but
[1:29:57] they didn't want to be pampering a
[1:29:59] newborn baby they didn't want a baby and
[1:30:03] this was a prophecy that Jesus is giving
[1:30:06] to us per the brother random says here
[1:30:10] in paragraph 120 says think today a
[1:30:13] disgrace for her to have a child see
[1:30:16] then shall they begin to say to the
[1:30:18] mountains fall on us and the hills cover
[1:30:20] us for if they do these things in a
[1:30:22] green tree what shall they do in a dry
[1:30:26] speaking of the day when women wouldn't
[1:30:29] no more want
[1:30:32] children they want a dog or a cat or
[1:30:35] something like that but she don't want
[1:30:37] children anymore why she's old mother
[1:30:41] hubber see she has the child that's the
[1:30:44] remarks of Hollywood they don't want it
[1:30:48] don't want its woman to be an old mother
[1:30:51] hubber so she'll have some operation
[1:30:54] performed on himself or her one that'll
[1:30:57] keep them from having children they
[1:30:59] don't want no
[1:31:01] children Jesus spoke of it what did he
[1:31:04] say at that time they'll begin to cry
[1:31:07] for the rocks and the mountains to fall
[1:31:10] on us see they're losing their minds and
[1:31:12] that's the age that we live in great
[1:31:15] tremendous age of this um women not
[1:31:20] wanting to have children that's one
[1:31:22] thing if you can't have or some reason
[1:31:25] why you can't but then to actually not
[1:31:28] to want to have children so this this
[1:31:32] quote I read for you many many times
[1:31:34] we've heard it many many times I read it
[1:31:36] in Tanzania many many times my last a
[1:31:40] flight coming home was from Atlanta to
[1:31:43] Tucson it's a straight flight beautiful
[1:31:46] flight just a direct no stops three and
[1:31:49] a half hours something like
[1:31:51] that and we got we got ready to board
[1:31:54] and leave and this little baby start
[1:31:58] crying I mean it wasn't like this little
[1:32:00] baby crying it was like
[1:32:03] wailing it was so deafening that
[1:32:07] everybody just got quiet I put my head
[1:32:10] sets my noise cancels
[1:32:12] on and this baby was so
[1:32:16] loud it's not like a laptop you can't
[1:32:18] turn it
[1:32:21] off that baby was on and the oh it had
[1:32:24] it captured the whole airplane and so
[1:32:28] one lady sitting next to me she looked
[1:32:30] at me she says well we ain't getting no
[1:32:32] sleep on this flight and I says well
[1:32:36] you're not but I got my headsets on so I
[1:32:38] was kind of teasing her she said yeah go
[1:32:41] ahead tease and so we were just joking
[1:32:43] and the next lady sitting next to me she
[1:32:45] was a mother and she was like well we
[1:32:48] know how this goes he'll get tired and
[1:32:50] then the baby will go finally go to
[1:32:52] sleep yeah we'll we get over it well
[1:32:55] there was a young teenage girl probably
[1:32:57] in her 20s maybe 30s American
[1:33:02] obviously she couldn't take it so she
[1:33:04] started cursing and
[1:33:06] swearing at the
[1:33:09] situation and so the um the flight
[1:33:13] attendants got up to you know see what
[1:33:15] was going cuz she's cursing out loud and
[1:33:17] started to direct this towards the
[1:33:20] parent and um so they warned her to stop
[1:33:25] and she wouldn't stop so they stopped
[1:33:28] our flight we were already taxing turned
[1:33:30] that plane around and kicked her off the
[1:33:33] plane proceeded to kick her off the
[1:33:35] plane and so while while all that's
[1:33:37] going on they're going back and forth
[1:33:40] the baby goes quiet and goes to
[1:33:43] sleep and then they kick this girl off
[1:33:46] and she starts crying so the baby stops
[1:33:48] crying and the girl getting kicked off
[1:33:50] starts
[1:33:51] crying you tell me what that's about
[1:33:56] I but that's what babies do yes they're
[1:34:01] not electronic they're not they're human
[1:34:03] beings and that that's probably the most
[1:34:05] complicated species in the universe is a
[1:34:09] human being you can't and there's other
[1:34:11] babies on the flight you say well be
[1:34:13] like the other babies some of the other
[1:34:14] babies were quiet but not this one and
[1:34:17] that's how human beings are and this is
[1:34:19] where uh uh brother brownon is giving
[1:34:22] this illustration and pulling it out of
[1:34:24] the scripture where Jesus said don't
[1:34:26] weep for me but the days are coming
[1:34:29] where they wouldn't want babies or
[1:34:31] children in their church and you take
[1:34:33] that spiritual application many many
[1:34:37] mature believers who have come through
[1:34:39] into the Holy Ghost wants to leave the
[1:34:42] service early and cancel the altar
[1:34:46] service because that's where the babies
[1:34:49] have to be born through that takes
[1:34:51] patience it takes time it's a
[1:34:54] sacrifice but somebody needs to be there
[1:34:58] Hallelujah to Foster the
[1:35:01] atmosphere so another son or daughter
[1:35:04] can be born into the kingdom of God it
[1:35:08] might be my brother it might be your
[1:35:11] sister hallelujah amen amen that's right
[1:35:15] is it worth it yes is it something the
[1:35:19] church should be as their focus as their
[1:35:22] goal
[1:35:24] yes not the music program not how well
[1:35:27] we sound not filling the pews but
[1:35:30] filling the altar with babies being born
[1:35:35] into the kingdom of
[1:35:37] God and many people won't even move a
[1:35:40] finger Soul come to the won't pray won't
[1:35:42] move a finger look at their clock ready
[1:35:44] to go eat lunch amen it's a problem so
[1:35:48] Lord help us amen amen it's a prophecy
[1:35:52] they don't want
[1:35:54] those blabbering babies brother brandom
[1:35:57] goes forward and says this is a true
[1:35:59] picture of the modern church today
[1:36:02] neither do they want the modern Church
[1:36:05] want any of these here screaming
[1:36:07] shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young
[1:36:12] around
[1:36:13] her yeah she don't want any of them
[1:36:16] hooping crying
[1:36:18] screaming and why such a child would
[1:36:21] immediately put her out of her denom
[1:36:23] mintion they had one like that in one of
[1:36:26] the churches why they throw her out
[1:36:29] quick why are you letting such as this
[1:36:32] go
[1:36:34] along so you see she's pregnated with
[1:36:37] something cuz she's bringing forth
[1:36:38] members all the time but she don't want
[1:36:41] none of them screaming hollering
[1:36:43] blabbering acts 238 miserable
[1:36:48] creatures she thinks they are it would
[1:36:50] certainly embarrass her you how many how
[1:36:54] many of our message churches today let's
[1:36:57] just say in this state I won't pick on
[1:36:59] our city let's just say this
[1:37:01] state it if a if a child will be born
[1:37:05] like acts 238 in their service it would
[1:37:08] interrupt their
[1:37:09] service it would bother them I'm talking
[1:37:12] about mature I'm talking about people
[1:37:14] who know this message who's read the
[1:37:16] Seven Seals in the church A's book I'm
[1:37:18] not talking about people who don't know
[1:37:20] I'm talking about people who supposed to
[1:37:22] be armor bearers of the word holding up
[1:37:27] the
[1:37:27] light they are the
[1:37:31] ones give your heart time God have mercy
[1:37:35] upon us but I don't want to be a part of
[1:37:37] that Saints I really don't I got to be
[1:37:40] by myself I don't want to be a part of
[1:37:42] that no no no no no no you got to change
[1:37:47] the diaper change that diaper
[1:37:53] how many's never changed a diaper before
[1:37:55] let me see your hand never changed never
[1:37:58] change a diaper
[1:38:01] check yeah we need to work on some of
[1:38:03] y'all yeah yeah yeah they don't want to
[1:38:05] raise their hand but we can see it on
[1:38:07] your face you never change no
[1:38:10] diaper
[1:38:12] yes it's an
[1:38:16] experience
[1:38:19] yes paragraph 132 they're pregnated with
[1:38:23] son something cuz she's bringing forth
[1:38:24] members all the time they don't want the
[1:38:27] acts 238 babies they they want they want
[1:38:32] nice fine members Brother Scott that's
[1:38:34] already went through that stage and
[1:38:37] they're well they're nice tithe payers
[1:38:39] they come to church they sit quiet and
[1:38:41] they could just add no problems that's
[1:38:43] the members we want let them you know
[1:38:46] they go through all of those stages and
[1:38:48] work out all their drug problems and
[1:38:50] their backslidings and they're messing
[1:38:52] around we got to pray them through
[1:38:53] through go bail them out of jail and go
[1:38:55] pick them up and this and that and then
[1:38:58] pray through and pray through and then
[1:39:00] finally they get an experience and then
[1:39:01] God deals with them and delivers them
[1:39:04] now all the churches wants that believer
[1:39:07] but you can't get that believer if he
[1:39:09] ain't a baby
[1:39:11] first instead of taking the member all
[1:39:15] the way up through the rearing and the
[1:39:17] child training up to adulthood we want
[1:39:20] to proelite some adult members
[1:39:24] huh yeah that's what they want to do
[1:39:26] yeah yes sir but they don't want the
[1:39:29] altar open they take it out of the
[1:39:31] church so they don't want to be
[1:39:33] pregnated with the word because that's
[1:39:35] the only kind that the word can bring
[1:39:39] forth so that's speaking of a day Jesus
[1:39:42] spoke of it the prophet picks it up and
[1:39:45] he speaks of it now this last prophecy
[1:39:48] that was Romans 7 that was Luke 23 let's
[1:39:51] take this last prophecy here in Acts
[1:39:54] chap 5 and then we will move on to what
[1:39:59] Joshua is
[1:40:02] now brother
[1:40:04] random in the message the token I'm
[1:40:07] sorry in
[1:40:09] communion the last message he preached
[1:40:12] paragraph uh number uh 59 he preached
[1:40:16] the just under an hour I believe on the
[1:40:19] message communion right here in Tucson
[1:40:22] last recorded sermon on the
[1:40:24] tape I thank God it is recorded cuz
[1:40:28] these quotes become my quotes now and uh
[1:40:31] somebody can say Brothers we we don't do
[1:40:33] that we don't handle the word that way
[1:40:35] we don't do that way well just show me
[1:40:36] the
[1:40:38] quotations that we don't handle it that
[1:40:40] way show me where the Prophet didn't
[1:40:42] preach it that way amen and so our
[1:40:46] Liberty is in the word I'm free to
[1:40:49] believe whatever is in this word and
[1:40:52] whatever is in the message I'm free to
[1:40:54] go take that amen and I don't want to be
[1:40:57] limited by somebody else's unbelief or
[1:41:00] what they can't see or what they believe
[1:41:01] and what they their hangup is I already
[1:41:04] have my own hangups I don't need to
[1:41:06] adopt anybody else's hangups my
[1:41:09] Liberties comes from the word of the
[1:41:11] Lord and for the rest of my life that's
[1:41:14] what I'm determined to go after what the
[1:41:16] word of the Lord has for me that is my
[1:41:20] goal my goal is the WRA
[1:41:24] the body change I want to get up out of
[1:41:27] here I'm not here to make more friends
[1:41:30] or or be up you know be upset or make
[1:41:32] myself a great I want to make the
[1:41:35] Rapture I want to get out of here amen I
[1:41:38] want to hear him say Well done good and
[1:41:42] faithful servant that's what I want to
[1:41:45] hear from him amen and brother random
[1:41:48] tells us in paragraph 59 how many
[1:41:51] believe like that how many want to hear
[1:41:52] from him to say Well done good and
[1:41:55] faithful
[1:41:57] servant amen that's all that
[1:42:01] matters paragraph 59 in the message
[1:42:04] communion the prophet says s that's the
[1:42:06] trouble of us today what I think I'm
[1:42:08] saying us me and the church that the
[1:42:12] Lord God has let me speak to in these
[1:42:14] last hours that we're believe that we
[1:42:17] believe we're living in the closing time
[1:42:20] we believe that God has G us a message
[1:42:22] it's been ordained of God it's been
[1:42:25] proven of God it's been showed of God
[1:42:28] now we must come to him with reverence
[1:42:31] and with love with purity of heart mind
[1:42:36] and
[1:42:37] soul you know the hour will soon
[1:42:42] arise when right Among Us the holy
[1:42:44] spirit will speak out like it did in
[1:42:47] ananas and Safar remember see that hour
[1:42:52] is is
[1:42:54] arriving see and now you just remember
[1:42:57] that see that God is going to dwell
[1:42:59] among his people that's what he wants to
[1:43:02] do now now who said
[1:43:05] that brother random said that when did
[1:43:09] he say that
[1:43:11] 1965 December the 12th all
[1:43:15] right and
[1:43:17] so what did he mean what he said is it
[1:43:21] true or is it false you got to you got
[1:43:23] to process that does that apply to us or
[1:43:26] not was he just saying that just to be
[1:43:29] saying it and if he's just saying it
[1:43:31] just to be saying it what else did he
[1:43:33] just say just to be saying and if that
[1:43:35] doesn't apply today what else doesn't
[1:43:38] apply today you see I have to handle
[1:43:41] this word some kind of way I have to
[1:43:44] approach it some kind of way before the
[1:43:46] Lord before the Lord as I'm handl it I
[1:43:50] have got to approach it in a way honest
[1:43:53] ly with my heart as as I would present
[1:43:56] it to other people and I've got to
[1:43:59] process that in order to be honest with
[1:44:03] myself with what I'm reading what is in
[1:44:06] the word and whoever I'm talking
[1:44:10] to now if I'm going to play games I can
[1:44:12] play games but if I really want to be
[1:44:14] serious I have to say well did he say it
[1:44:17] or did he not say it I don't care what
[1:44:19] the vision is I don't care what the
[1:44:21] statement is if I'm following this
[1:44:23] message I have to really process did he
[1:44:26] really say that and if he said it is it
[1:44:28] really true and if it is really true am
[1:44:32] I responsible for it and if I am
[1:44:35] responsible for it then it's worth me
[1:44:38] living the rest of my life trying to let
[1:44:41] God by his grace to let me live that
[1:44:44] word that I'm hearing amen Lord amen
[1:44:50] amen
[1:44:52] so this is one of those quotes where you
[1:44:54] know we we can brush it off we could
[1:44:57] take it out we can say no it didn't mean
[1:44:59] that we you know that was you know that
[1:45:02] was under the second pool but you can't
[1:45:04] do that with this quote here you can't
[1:45:06] say this was the second pool here can't
[1:45:08] say he was you know just saying that to
[1:45:11] visitors no no no no no no he said the
[1:45:15] hour is approaching what hour Acts
[1:45:20] chapter 5 let's turn there quickly
[1:45:25] now this is the story of ananas and
[1:45:27] safire all
[1:45:30] right said brother isra we heard this
[1:45:32] before yes we need to hear it
[1:45:35] again it's the word of the
[1:45:38] Lord and it had a it had
[1:45:42] a it had a result that happened because
[1:45:47] of it it wasn't just a nothing it was
[1:45:50] really a
[1:45:51] something and and in Acts chapter 5
[1:45:54] we'll see that ananas and survived they
[1:45:56] sold a certain
[1:45:59] portion they agreed to tell this portion
[1:46:03] to Peter just one of the brothers you
[1:46:06] know we know Peter he even has his own
[1:46:08] faults so we can tell him
[1:46:10] whatever verse eight and Peter answered
[1:46:13] her and tell me whether you sold the
[1:46:14] land for so much and she said yes for so
[1:46:17] much now they had already buried her
[1:46:20] husband he lied they buried him and then
[1:46:25] when she comes Peter didn't say now look
[1:46:28] sis your husband just lied and the Holy
[1:46:31] Spirit no Peter didn't do that Peter
[1:46:33] just asked her the same question and he
[1:46:36] offered this to
[1:46:39] her and she said yes for so much verse n
[1:46:43] then Peter said unto her how is it that
[1:46:47] ye have agreed together to tempt the
[1:46:49] spirit of the Lord behold the feet of
[1:46:52] them which have buried thy husband are
[1:46:54] at the door and shall carry thee out
[1:46:58] then fell she straight down straight
[1:47:01] away then fell she down straightway at
[1:47:04] his feet and yielded up the ghost
[1:47:07] brother Brandon said it was a heart
[1:47:09] attack that's what he said and the young
[1:47:11] men came in and found her dead and
[1:47:14] carrying her forth buried her by her
[1:47:17] husband look at verse 11 and great fear
[1:47:22] came Came Upon all the church and upon
[1:47:26] as many as heard these
[1:47:30] things now you'll see this great
[1:47:32] fear coming again if you can turn there
[1:47:36] quickly to Acts chapter 19
[1:47:40] quickly in verse number 13
[1:47:56] the same time you know these Jews they
[1:47:59] wanted to cast out Devils they were
[1:48:01] imitating
[1:48:03] Paul and
[1:48:06] um verse we'll pick it up from verse 14
[1:48:09] and there were seven sons of onekea a
[1:48:11] Jew chief of the priests which did so
[1:48:14] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:48:16] Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are
[1:48:19] ye and the man whom the evil spirit was
[1:48:22] leaped on them and overcame them and
[1:48:25] prevailed against them so that they fled
[1:48:27] out that house naked and wounded and
[1:48:30] this was known to all the Jews and
[1:48:32] Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and what
[1:48:37] happened fear fell on them
[1:48:40] all and the name of the Lord was
[1:48:44] magnified and many that believe came and
[1:48:47] confessed and showed their
[1:48:49] deeds and many of them also which used
[1:48:51] curious art brought their books together
[1:48:55] burned them before all men and they
[1:48:58] counted the price of them found 50,000
[1:49:00] pieces of silver so mightily grew the
[1:49:03] word of God and prevailed so this Acts
[1:49:08] chapter five brother bandam highlights
[1:49:12] this out of the books of book of Acts
[1:49:14] and he says that that day is coming
[1:49:17] again and let me ask you the question
[1:49:20] now ananas and safire didn't lie on
[1:49:25] somebody it wasn't adultery it wasn't
[1:49:27] fornication it didn't steal from anyone
[1:49:31] there was no crime that they committed
[1:49:33] against another believer it was just a
[1:49:36] lie between a husband and wife and they
[1:49:39] agreed to to do this lie and tell this
[1:49:44] and it was it was like a cheap lie or it
[1:49:47] was a lie that really I mean it wasn't
[1:49:50] even about the amount really when you
[1:49:53] examine what was going on you know if
[1:49:56] you sold it for 10 or if you sold it for
[1:49:59] 20 that would have been the price you
[1:50:01] sold it
[1:50:02] for right and that's what you're were
[1:50:04] going to give somebody else sold
[1:50:05] whatever whatever whatever but it was
[1:50:08] the lie that they
[1:50:11] told and let me ask you amongst the
[1:50:13] Church Believers there's 3,000 that were
[1:50:15] just added to the church new converts do
[1:50:18] you think there were any other believers
[1:50:21] that maybe told a lie that week
[1:50:25] or they were the only ones that
[1:50:28] lied but you see the lord caught their
[1:50:33] lie and when this was heard that this
[1:50:38] had been done that's what caused the
[1:50:41] Great fear to come upon everyone
[1:50:44] else now I'm sure and I've heard of
[1:50:48] people and folks doing things that were
[1:50:50] far worse than what ananas and Safara
[1:50:53] did here amen and they've done worse and
[1:50:56] even come and taking
[1:50:58] communion they have done worse and even
[1:51:01] come and taking the pull
[1:51:03] pit huh so here here is the prophet of
[1:51:08] God now in the spirit now he's at the
[1:51:11] last of his ministry closing in his tape
[1:51:13] Ministry is now that hour is s will soon
[1:51:17] arise when ananas and saf will be dwelt
[1:51:22] among among us again so you take the
[1:51:24] example with ananas and Safar what
[1:51:26] really did they do that was wrong that
[1:51:28] hurt
[1:51:31] anyone and so great fear Came Upon all
[1:51:35] the people all of them that heard this
[1:51:40] um this is the church that's coming in
[1:51:45] the future this is what the word of the
[1:51:48] Lord is producing in the hearts of
[1:51:50] Believers today
[1:51:53] a church that is that that that where
[1:51:57] sin can't enter into the
[1:52:01] building and I don't know how many of us
[1:52:03] really want that how many of us are
[1:52:06] really ready for that or do you want to
[1:52:09] go to a church or go to a place where
[1:52:12] they're just put up with you and not
[1:52:15] mention the
[1:52:16] sin I mean it's far it's far I mean it's
[1:52:19] easier for someone to mention your sin
[1:52:22] and embarrass you but then to pack you
[1:52:25] out
[1:52:28] dead and we and we get criticize and we
[1:52:32] get the side eye from even preaching
[1:52:34] against sin what about being struck yeah
[1:52:38] because of this unbelief like this here
[1:52:42] and this is the coming
[1:52:44] Church um there's no other age like this
[1:52:46] is the greatest of all the ages and this
[1:52:49] is one of the prophecies to come so now
[1:52:52] This Book of Joshua types the Believers
[1:52:57] today and this types the last day the
[1:53:01] end
[1:53:02] time
[1:53:04] um the end
[1:53:06] time
[1:53:08] messenger the Holy Spirit and the
[1:53:14] um the True Believer the messenger the
[1:53:17] Holy Spirit and the True Believer so now
[1:53:20] brother brandom takes
[1:53:22] the message the spoken word is the
[1:53:24] Original Seed and he brings this to us
[1:53:29] here paragraph number
[1:53:31] 88 oh 808 sorry and the prophet now is
[1:53:37] being called into the spirit he preaches
[1:53:40] this in spoken words The Original Seed
[1:53:42] remember that portion where the Holy
[1:53:44] Spirit tells him to pick up his pen and
[1:53:46] right and then he also uh uh rehearses
[1:53:50] that again in the church age book
[1:53:53] and I know some people have a problem
[1:53:54] with the church age book but brother bam
[1:53:57] said it was my book he says
[1:54:00] that and and the church age book came
[1:54:04] and was finally printed after the seals
[1:54:07] had been preached so there's other
[1:54:08] things that was included in the church
[1:54:10] AE book you can fight you run whatever
[1:54:13] you want to I'm going to take what the
[1:54:14] prophet said about the church a book
[1:54:16] that's me personally and I can take what
[1:54:19] Reverend so and so said and this one I
[1:54:20] heard said and this one heard says but
[1:54:23] on the tape that's right he already told
[1:54:26] us what the church age book
[1:54:28] was you could take a private testimony
[1:54:31] and maybe that's what God called you to
[1:54:32] take is a private testimony I'm going to
[1:54:35] take the testimony that's recorded on
[1:54:38] the tape teaching God bless you
[1:54:42] amen all
[1:54:45] right so here he says now let us stand
[1:54:49] let us stand like Joshua in Caleb how
[1:54:53] many's interested in
[1:54:55] that who is Joshua and
[1:54:58] Caleb now watch close he says this is
[1:55:01] going to have a spiritual
[1:55:03] background now let us stand like Joshua
[1:55:06] and Caleb as we see the promised land
[1:55:09] coming in sight it's nearing the time to
[1:55:14] be given Joshua and Hebrew means Savior
[1:55:18] and represents the promised end time
[1:55:21] leader to take the church over Caleb
[1:55:24] represents the True Believer who stayed
[1:55:27] with Joshua God started Israel as a
[1:55:31] virgin with his word but they wanted
[1:55:33] something different so so did the last
[1:55:35] day Church notice how God did not move
[1:55:39] Israel until his own appointed time now
[1:55:41] listen this is going to mean something
[1:55:45] Joshua waited for that
[1:55:48] time no how matter no ma no much people
[1:55:52] people might have said God gave us the
[1:55:55] land the promise let us go now and take
[1:55:57] it they might have said Joshua you lost
[1:56:00] your commission you're all washed up why
[1:56:03] you're not doing something you used to
[1:56:06] to do no thus sayith the Lord in a
[1:56:08] moment and what was the will of God but
[1:56:10] this wise God sent Pro but but this wise
[1:56:16] God sent Prophet knew the promise of God
[1:56:19] but also knew to wait for that promise a
[1:56:22] clearcut decision from God for his time
[1:56:26] see these Parables now watch when the
[1:56:29] time come God gave it to Joshua who
[1:56:31] would stay with him by the word for he
[1:56:34] could not trust others he could trust
[1:56:37] him so will it repeat so here in this
[1:56:40] quotation here 1962 brother mam tells us
[1:56:43] that Joshua is a type of the end time
[1:56:49] leader
[1:56:52] and he also tell us that Caleb
[1:56:55] represents the True Believer who stayed
[1:56:58] with Joshua can somebody say
[1:57:01] Amen now in the message the adoption he
[1:57:03] types Joshua as the Holy
[1:57:08] Spirit and also in the message blind
[1:57:11] bardus 1960 he types it as the holy
[1:57:16] spirit let me read those two for you
[1:57:18] here so I can just give you the clear uh
[1:57:21] you know know a balance of of what the
[1:57:24] prophet said about it all right
[1:57:25] paragraph 114 and adoption Moses being a
[1:57:28] type of Christ led the children up to
[1:57:31] the promised land then Moses did not
[1:57:33] take the children in the promised land
[1:57:36] Joshua took the people in and divided up
[1:57:39] the land Jesus Paid the price LED them
[1:57:43] up to the Holy Spirit God sent the Holy
[1:57:46] Spirit down and he positionally put the
[1:57:49] church in order each man filling him
[1:57:52] with the presence of his being see what
[1:57:54] I mean all in Christ Jesus how God
[1:57:57] predestinated this to the to the calling
[1:58:01] of this gospel
[1:58:05] so there Joshua is typed as a holy
[1:58:08] spirit let's take this message blind
[1:58:11] Bemus
[1:58:12] 1960 paragraph 163 the prophet of God
[1:58:16] says this here
[1:58:22] Joshua the Great Mighty Warrior who took
[1:58:25] Moses's place a type of the Holy Spirit
[1:58:29] now taking see Moses didn't bring the
[1:58:32] children into the promised land he was a
[1:58:35] lawgiver but he didn't bring the
[1:58:37] children into the promised land Joshua
[1:58:40] took them over see and the Holy Spirit
[1:58:42] is the one that takes them over now
[1:58:45] Christ made the way and the plans was
[1:58:49] The Giver of the law and so forth but
[1:58:51] the Holy Spirit takes the church to the
[1:58:54] promised land the Rapture taking it up
[1:58:58] the Holy Spirit In The Rapture how many
[1:59:02] can say Amen to that so it's the holy
[1:59:05] spirit that takes you into the promised
[1:59:09] land and devise the land so what was the
[1:59:11] Book of Joshua the Book of Joshua was
[1:59:14] about the real estate it was about land
[1:59:20] ownership the book of Joshua is about
[1:59:24] property was it about a promise that God
[1:59:27] had given Israel to divide the land now
[1:59:32] these Patriarchs were determined and and
[1:59:36] um they were um separated through Jacob
[1:59:41] through through their two his two wives
[1:59:44] and then the midwives that were
[1:59:46] associated with those two wives and
[1:59:49] there was a great stress in bringing
[1:59:51] those women the stress that they had in
[1:59:54] bringing forth those children in the
[1:59:56] labor
[1:59:58] pains and brother bam tells us it was by
[2:00:01] inspiration that those Hebrew mothers
[2:00:04] named those
[2:00:06] boys Reuben and Gad and Dan and and the
[2:00:10] different names that they were called
[2:00:12] they were it was a stress behind them
[2:00:14] and that stress was Rachel and Leah it
[2:00:18] was you know uh Rachel had Jacob's heart
[2:00:22] Leah was fertile and had Jacob's
[2:00:24] children and they would they were
[2:00:26] conflict these two sisters were conflict
[2:00:30] between uh the love and through you know
[2:00:34] having children with with Jacob it was a
[2:00:36] stressful thing and brother Brandon
[2:00:38] brings that out in a number of messages
[2:00:41] but he brings it out in the message the
[2:00:43] adoption and he says this in paragraph
[2:00:46] 48 in the message adoption number
[2:00:49] one and so this that just gives you a
[2:00:52] background of what's going on in the
[2:00:54] Book of Joshua and so now notice this
[2:00:57] Burns our hearts each one of those
[2:01:00] Hebrew mothers giving birth to those
[2:01:03] children she spoke the very place in her
[2:01:06] labor pains where they would be
[2:01:09] positioned in the promised land oh it's
[2:01:12] a great study if we could only go into
[2:01:17] in details which would take hours after
[2:01:20] hours some days when we get our church
[2:01:21] Church fix I like to come and take a
[2:01:24] solid month or two and just stay right
[2:01:26] in it watch when each of those mothers
[2:01:29] when she called out Ephraim when she was
[2:01:32] in labor positionally placed him where
[2:01:35] his feet was setting in oil just exactly
[2:01:38] every one of them wherever they were at
[2:01:41] and Joshua not knowing this but by
[2:01:45] inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after
[2:01:48] being in the promised land give each man
[2:01:52] his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit
[2:01:55] promised through the birth back there
[2:01:57] how that God has set some in the church
[2:02:00] through what through the labor pain you
[2:02:03] see through the
[2:02:05] birth oh they get tremendous sometime
[2:02:08] let me say this you don't want a
[2:02:10] minister in your church that hasn't been
[2:02:11] born again that's right you don't want a
[2:02:14] song leader that hasn't been born again
[2:02:17] trustee or Deacon or board that doesn't
[2:02:19] know what the new birth is right if you
[2:02:22] have been born again you'll have a
[2:02:24] burden for somebody else being born
[2:02:26] again I guarantee you that you'll be
[2:02:29] interested in it yes yes you're not a
[2:02:33] hireling there's no price no you'll stay
[2:02:36] with the you'll stay with that original
[2:02:39] burden and those labor pains they get
[2:02:42] tremendous sometimes he talks about how
[2:02:45] a church in its labor
[2:02:49] pains what is this church labor laboring
[2:02:52] for what are the labor pains of this
[2:02:55] church here you tell me what are the
[2:02:58] labor pains in your heart Saint you
[2:03:01] sitting in the pews
[2:03:02] there what's the burden in your heart is
[2:03:06] it applied to a scripture or a quote or
[2:03:09] is it some burden out here in the world
[2:03:12] or something what's causing your burning
[2:03:15] what's what's burning your heart what's
[2:03:17] driving you what do you really want in
[2:03:21] your life is it connected to the
[2:03:23] scriptures is it connected to the
[2:03:26] quotations or is it something out here
[2:03:28] some worldly
[2:03:30] Affair labor
[2:03:34] pains oh how the church should be in
[2:03:38] labor pains
[2:03:39] today
[2:03:42] amen they go how that how that God had
[2:03:47] set some in the church through the labor
[2:03:49] pains oh they get tremendous sometime
[2:03:52] when a church is groaning under
[2:03:54] persecution of the outside world
[2:03:57] Believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[2:03:59] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[2:04:02] real to us as it was to
[2:04:04] Pentecost how they groan and cry under
[2:04:08] labor pains when was the last time it
[2:04:12] don't have to be in this church it can
[2:04:13] be in your closet it could be wherever
[2:04:15] when was the last time you
[2:04:19] groan in the spirit
[2:04:22] for something in the word to be
[2:04:24] fulfilled in your
[2:04:38] life cry under labor pains but when they
[2:04:41] are born and positionally born in the
[2:04:43] kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has
[2:04:45] set some in the church some Apostles
[2:04:48] some prophets some teachers some pastors
[2:04:50] some evangelists
[2:04:52] then he give in there speaking with
[2:04:54] tongues interpretation of Tong knowledge
[2:04:56] wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of
[2:04:59] Miracles now this is my purpose of doing
[2:05:02] this the church is always trying to take
[2:05:04] somebody else's corner but don't do that
[2:05:08] he says so he deals with these labor
[2:05:11] pains can I take a few more moments all
[2:05:16] right
[2:05:18] yes these labor pains so let's stand
[2:05:22] like Joshua and CBA if you take the Book
[2:05:24] of Joshua and I just did went through it
[2:05:26] again I'm gonna go through it again here
[2:05:28] where
[2:05:30] Joshua in many
[2:05:32] cases they would they would cast lots
[2:05:36] before the Lord he would bring the
[2:05:39] elders and then he would bring the
[2:05:42] priest and they would stand at the door
[2:05:44] of the
[2:05:45] Tabernacle and it would cast lots before
[2:05:49] the Lord as he was making making the
[2:05:52] decision on placing whatever family
[2:05:55] whatever group needs to get placed and
[2:05:57] then it got to one place I think it was
[2:05:59] seven families that never received their
[2:06:02] inheritance yet and Joshua kind of got
[2:06:05] on them he said like how long will you
[2:06:08] all be here and not go possess the land
[2:06:13] it's like seven seven of you families
[2:06:16] have not taken the land that God gave
[2:06:19] you amen
[2:06:22] right how long you going to be here and
[2:06:25] not go possess your land what do you
[2:06:27] really want that's good what's in your
[2:06:31] heart what do you really
[2:06:34] desire I'm talking about scripture and
[2:06:37] quote connected desire I'm not talking
[2:06:40] about any other desire I'm talking about
[2:06:42] something connected with scripture
[2:06:45] something connected in this word that
[2:06:48] you're laboring for what do you really
[2:06:50] want am amen what do you
[2:06:54] desire Lord help
[2:06:57] me to align my desires with your word
[2:07:02] amen amen
[2:07:05] amen so let's stand like Joshua and
[2:07:08] Caleb let's look at Caleb just for a
[2:07:10] moment as I close here we got time for
[2:07:14] one in Joshua chapter 14 let's look at
[2:07:19] Caleb just for a minute
[2:07:22] Chapter 14 verse number
[2:07:33] six see if I can find it here
[2:07:47] quickly verse six then the children of
[2:07:49] Judah which Caleb was the tribe of
[2:07:52] came to Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the
[2:07:55] son of jeffa the kenite said unto him
[2:07:59] thou knowest that the thing that the
[2:08:01] Lord said unto Moses the man of God
[2:08:03] concerning me and thee in Cades
[2:08:07] Baria 40 years old was I when Moses the
[2:08:11] servant of the Lord sent me from kades
[2:08:13] barnea to aspy out the land and I
[2:08:16] brought him word again as it was in my
[2:08:19] heart nevertheless my Brethren that went
[2:08:22] up with me made the heart of the people
[2:08:25] melt but I wholly follow the Lord my God
[2:08:30] isn't that nice amen isn't that a
[2:08:32] beautiful testimony to
[2:08:35] have man and Moses swear that day saying
[2:08:39] surely the land wearing thy feet have
[2:08:41] trotten shall be thine inheritance and
[2:08:44] thy childr forever because thou H has
[2:08:47] wholly followed the Lord my God now now
[2:08:51] behold the Lord hath kept me
[2:08:56] alive and he has said these 40 and what
[2:08:59] happened to the brothers that went with
[2:09:02] him they're about his same age they were
[2:09:05] leaders of the tribe but they're dead
[2:09:08] but not Caleb's Not Dead the Bible says
[2:09:11] the Lord you kept me
[2:09:13] alive it was 40 years ago I was ready
[2:09:16] and it's 40 years later and I'm still
[2:09:19] ready to go take the land that you
[2:09:23] promised me and the strength I had then
[2:09:26] is the strength I got right now let me
[2:09:30] take my Mountain God has showed me Grace
[2:09:33] it's Giants on the mountain but let me
[2:09:35] go get my mountain that is what the holy
[2:09:39] spirit will lead any Caleb to do he'll
[2:09:42] find the promises in God's
[2:09:44] word and they're connected in the word
[2:09:47] of the Lord and that becomes a labor to
[2:09:50] that man or that woman and he'll make it
[2:09:53] happen in his life amen and there's
[2:09:56] others that'll just hang around and kick
[2:09:59] it around but not Caleb how many wants
[2:10:03] to be a Caleb
[2:10:04] today give me that
[2:10:07] mountain give me my Mountain yes sir
[2:10:09] amen I'm ready to go out to go out and
[2:10:11] come back in Man of where I'm 80 years
[2:10:14] old now I was 40 seemed like I could
[2:10:16] have got a gun done back then but I'm 80
[2:10:19] but age is just a number
[2:10:22] strength comes from the
[2:10:24] Lord huh amen if the Lord anoints you
[2:10:28] strength comes from the Lord amen I'm
[2:10:31] ready to
[2:10:32] go you know Caleb wasn't asking for no
[2:10:34] help
[2:10:38] either give me my now when you can take
[2:10:42] this
[2:10:43] scripture
[2:10:45] in uh uh what do we read there Joshua
[2:10:48] what 14 yes amen 146 and you internalize
[2:10:52] that scripture for you the believer
[2:10:55] today and the prophet said let us stand
[2:10:58] like
[2:11:01] Caleb Dan can you see your approach to
[2:11:03] the
[2:11:04] word
[2:11:06] huh can you see your approach to the
[2:11:08] word
[2:11:10] now can you pick up the
[2:11:13] sword and go get those promises that God
[2:11:16] gave to
[2:11:18] you he gave them to everybody but not
[2:11:21] every everybody's going to take it I've
[2:11:23] given you the land now go possess it
[2:11:26] I've given it to you now you go out
[2:11:29] there on Saturday and get the rake and
[2:11:31] the wheelbarrow and move them cactuses

[2:11:42] take the land he gave us the scripture
[2:11:45] he gave us this message now you go take
[2:11:49] the land and this is just one portion of
[2:11:52] these three great prophecies that
[2:11:56] apply to the Church of the last days
[2:11:58] don't you love him am God bless you
[2:12:02] richly I'm not done but I'll close here
