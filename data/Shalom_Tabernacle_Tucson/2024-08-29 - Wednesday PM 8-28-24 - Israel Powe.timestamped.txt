[27:13] very nice they had maybe 500 or more um
[27:20] Believers that gathered at the school
[27:21] there's a banquet on the night Friday
[27:24] night Saturday night they had the night
[27:26] of worship choir sing singing and other
[27:29] songs and just had a wonderful time kind
[27:33] of apologized to the samanos I didn't
[27:35] really greet them from the pull pit
[27:38] Sunday morning but we were so happy to
[27:40] have them along with us in the in that
[27:43] trip and it was just very very nice and
[27:45] I spoke on the Sunday morning there and
[27:48] just had a wonderful time my wife is at
[27:51] home not feeling well as many others are
[27:54] but um we're glad to be here with you
[27:57] tonight appreciate the brothers that
[28:00] took over the service while we were gone
[28:02] brother George he always does a very a
[28:05] very fine job and each of
[28:07] you I have a portion in the message I
[28:11] want to read before we go to the tape
[28:13] it's in the message communion and it's
[28:16] paragraph number
[28:17] 64 the last message brother Brandon
[28:21] preached and it's been going right along
[28:24] with these messages that we have been
[28:27] bringing on on love and unity and um
[28:32] some would say well brother Israel is
[28:33] there anything going on no there's
[28:36] nothing going on everybody's doing good
[28:38] far as I know and um and so um these are
[28:42] just the messages that were been on my
[28:45] heart and um I think the Lord has
[28:49] Vindicated it every time of just the the
[28:53] response I'm getting from different ones
[28:56] on you know just the need in the Lord
[28:59] has just backed it up in my own heart on
[29:02] those messages on love and communion and
[29:06] with one another and unity of the spirit
[29:09] and all those things that we that we
[29:11] absolutely need to do amen and so um in
[29:16] this message communion 1965 in paragraph
[29:20] 64 brother mam says this as we will be
[29:24] preparing to go to the Lord's Supper um
[29:27] in the next
[29:28] few days he says this and it's just
[29:31] really really
[29:33] striking he says is this communion just
[29:37] something I go up for it in order say
[29:42] well the rest of them take this I will
[29:45] too it's a
[29:47] revelation that I am part of him and I
[29:51] am part of you and I love you and I love
[29:57] him and we're taking this together as a
[30:00] symbol of our love to God and our love
[30:04] and fellowship to one another very
[30:08] simple but very profound how that
[30:11] communion service isn't just an
[30:14] individual service it's a love that we
[30:17] have towards God and towards one another
[30:21] and not only a love towards one another
[30:23] we're actually part of one another the
[30:27] enemy does doesn't want us to grasp that
[30:30] he wants us to stay individual and
[30:33] separate that and push it off yeah we
[30:35] heard that before but let's go deeper
[30:38] than that and I believe that's where the
[30:40] Rapture and all the things that we need
[30:42] in growing closer to the Lord and
[30:45] receiving a double portion of his spirit
[30:47] and having more of the Holy Ghost I
[30:49] think is founded upon this right here
[30:52] the love of God so brother random takes
[30:55] this message 1956 divine love he's
[30:58] preaching it at the brandham Tabernacle
[31:01] on a Sunday
[31:02] morning he's going to be reading from
[31:05] Romans chapter
[31:07] 4 and um so he's at
[31:11] home and this is the main service for
[31:14] the brandham Tabernacle and entitled
[31:17] Divine love so as we prepare to go there
[31:19] let's sing only believe amen
[31:24] [Music]
[31:29] only
[31:32] Bel

[45:29] to turn everywhere everywhere and
[45:32] there's about at least 10 or more great
[45:35] outstanding conferences setting right
[45:36] now and each one calling to go to I got
[45:39] to make some kind of decision next 24
[45:41] hours for the next move so pray for
[45:45] meay and I I need your prayer I hope
[45:48] shutting that F off didn't bother you
[45:50] all here on the front too much for a
[45:52] minute I I've been exposed to so many
[45:56] things in my life life of traveling for
[45:58] the Lord and all kinds of conditions and
[46:00] diseases and and leprosy and I've hugged
[46:04] lepers and shut their hands and and
[46:07] every kind of disease and went into
[46:09] their isolation ws and tamps and
[46:11] everything around the world and I I I'm
[46:16] not a boy anymore I guess you know that
[46:19] and I'm getting up towards and I hear
[46:22] Brother BOS was the other day there
[46:25] almost 90 years old and he when I was in
[46:27] Indianapolis he had a blood plot running
[46:29] into his heart he had death struggles
[46:31] and he s unconscious Miss BOS was called
[46:33] to have prayer for him went over there
[46:35] we announced it and started praying next
[46:37] day he called me I said I'd like being
[46:38] in a meeting with you
[46:41] sometimes I see like here 47 years old I
[46:44] be as shamed of
[46:45] myself just just the human part I guess
[46:49] but oh how valuable it is and how
[46:52] wonderful nothing like being saved amen
[46:55] being saved you don't realize friend I'm
[46:58] sure that the devil keeps that away from
[47:00] you as much as he can he does for me to
[47:03] realize what the value of a soul is did
[47:06] you ever just
[47:08] imagine what it is and what eternity
[47:11] means and how long you're going to be
[47:13] that way amen you realize this is the
[47:16] time when you make your decision for
[47:18] eternity amen last Sunday with you here
[47:20] I believe I preached on the Assurance of
[47:24] how that God had promised and ordained
[47:27] you and call you before the foundation
[47:29] of world and put your name in his
[47:32] book you had nothing to do with it God
[47:35] did it is that wonderful the lamb was
[47:38] slain before the foundation of the world
[47:40] and why it never happened till 4,000
[47:43] years later but God when he spoke it he
[47:45] had to do it because he has to keep his
[47:47] word in the same time that the lamb was
[47:49] wrote down your you were wrote with him
[47:51] amen our names were written in the
[47:53] Lamb's Book of Life not the night we
[47:55] come to Christ but before the foundation
[47:58] of the
[47:59] world so that's the assurance and
[48:01] brother touched on that this morning in
[48:03] this marvelous Sunday school reading now
[48:07] let's just read for a scripture
[48:09] somewhere just for a little uh I wanton
[48:13] thus something is on my heart I just
[48:15] like to speak it for a few moments and
[48:18] then we'll dismiss and expect the
[48:20] services again tonight and now I got a
[48:24] message on my heart coming down the
[48:26] other day
[48:27] and I want if God willing if I'm back
[48:29] here next Sunday morning to bring it to
[48:31] the Tabernacle for the first just
[48:33] something that's on my heart of the time
[48:36] I went into a place to eat and I thought
[48:39] am I going crazy what's the matter me I
[48:41] can't stand these musics and all this
[48:43] your stuff that you had today these
[48:45] silly women singing down out of the
[48:49] ivory Palace or and all this I said it
[48:52] must be something wrong with me and the
[48:54] Holy Spirit said oh no oh no if you love
[48:57] the world are the things of the world
[48:59] the love of God's not even in you so I
[49:01] thought well I don't want to get
[49:02] adjusted then to this world that's and
[49:05] then the Holy Spirit began to reveal
[49:07] this message to me I wouldn't have time
[49:09] this morning at two ties besides maybe
[49:11] the Lord's willing next Sunday morning
[49:13] if we're still around I got some tips to
[49:15] make this week but if I'm still around
[49:17] next Sunday morning God will brother
[49:19] Neville announc on his broadcast on
[49:20] Saturday and we'll be in try to bring
[49:23] this message I want you to try to bring
[49:24] somewhere it's a gospel message of the
[49:27] day hour and season I had predicted 6
[49:30] months ago that this was the closing
[49:33] year for America and we'll see what it
[49:35] is according to the gospel or not amen
[49:37] this is the time when she's gone amen
[49:39] she either going up or down this year
[49:42] amen right now you young children I want
[49:46] you to bring me a piece of paper and
[49:47] write it in the fly your Bible that when
[49:50] brother Venom's done passed on for him
[49:52] you see whether I was right or
[49:53] wrong know whether the Lord still speak
[49:58] now in Romans the fourth chapter I want
[50:01] to read just for a portion of words to
[50:04] continue on what shall we say then that
[50:07] Abraham Our Father pertaining to the
[50:09] flesh has found for If Abraham were
[50:12] justified by works he has for off the
[50:15] glory but not before God for what sayith
[50:18] the scripture Abraham believed God and
[50:21] it was counted unto him for
[50:23] righteousness now to him that worketh is
[50:26] the reward not reckon of Grace but of
[50:28] death but to him that worketh not but
[50:32] believeth on him that justify the
[50:34] ungodly his faith is counted for
[50:38] righteousness and may the Lord add his
[50:40] Blessing to the word now the little
[50:43] subject if we should call it so that I
[50:46] wish to speak to you about is divine
[50:49] love and when Divine love has been
[50:54] projected and come to its
[50:57] destination father's Grace takes its
[50:59] place amen H can you think of that I
[51:03] ponder over so we get it real close on
[51:05] see when Divine love is
[51:10] projected am and comes to its Destiny
[51:14] then Sovereign grave takes over amen
[51:18] now it's
[51:21] um it's a strange thing that how that
[51:24] people
[51:27] the type of people and what we do in our
[51:29] associations now we all have to face
[51:32] these facts that there is people that
[51:35] you just love to be
[51:37] around and there's people that find
[51:40] people and you love them but yet there's
[51:43] something about the person that you just
[51:46] you just can't hardly stay around now we
[51:49] want to talk of fact amen now the reason
[51:53] that is is because of the atmosphere
[51:57] that the individual himself or herself
[52:00] creates because you are a minister
[52:04] create us amen because you're Sons and
[52:07] Daughters of God no matter how far you
[52:10] stooped in sin you're still Sons and
[52:13] Daughters of God because you're fallen
[52:17] degenerated in your soul and mind but
[52:21] God is your creator and in your Fallen
[52:24] as state you are lost
[52:27] undone creation of God dominated by the
[52:31] dev that's right but still your sons and
[52:34] daughters of God he's not willing that
[52:36] any of you should perish but all might
[52:38] come to
[52:39] repentance and he's done everything that
[52:42] that La possible for the only God
[52:45] himself to do this to give the the
[52:49] opportunities to the creatures of here
[52:51] to accept and to be what he wants you to
[52:54] be back in your right estate again
[52:57] and no person I hear it is and it's pre
[53:00] shot but no person is in their right
[53:03] mental status until they have accepted
[53:06] the Lord Jesus amen that's a deep word
[53:10] but that's the truth no person is
[53:13] mentally right until they have accepted
[53:17] Christ Jesus as personal
[53:19] savior that's sounds but it's the Bible
[53:22] am certainly that is true he is the one
[53:25] and in your created being now you'll be
[53:28] crazy to the world when you do that
[53:31] because you have to come out of the
[53:32] atmosphere you're in into this other
[53:35] atmosphere when you do that God lifts
[53:38] you right up from the world and you live
[53:39] in a Heavenly atmosphere am see and then
[53:43] to the world you're just contrary to
[53:45] what that is see and this is contrary to
[53:48] the world Amen see now what you want to
[53:51] do is be lifted up by Christ into a an
[53:55] atmosphere so where you are uh Happy
[54:00] peaceful and then in there you create a
[54:03] situation prise God and now many times
[54:07] we in churches this may seem strange but
[54:11] if you just watch it that this is for
[54:14] the church is for the
[54:17] people the people get one another's
[54:20] spirit and instead of getting the Holy
[54:23] Spirit you go into a group of people and
[54:26] you walk the way that uh person acts and
[54:30] and then find people to come into that
[54:32] congregation the first thing you know
[54:34] they act the same way you always you
[54:37] take a good woman and a bad man and
[54:40] he'll she he'll either become a good man
[54:42] or her a bad woman in the atmosphere
[54:45] that you live in you project to your
[54:48] Associates amen what you
[54:52] are then what type of people ought we to
[54:55] be if we're a Christian
[54:57] amen what type of atmosphere should we
[54:59] live in in a consoling soothing healing
[55:05] atmosphere we should live in with our
[55:07] hearts constantly in prayer with a deep
[55:10] love for every person we come and
[55:12] contact with that's if I say this to the
[55:15] little churches prayed for me for the
[55:17] world
[55:18] mission that's my success in praying for
[55:21] the six if I can't get right down into
[55:25] the ceiling of the sickness with the
[55:27] person it usually doesn't do any good
[55:30] you've got to come right down till it's
[55:32] just you feel it yourself here's
[55:36] sometime a go old Mexican man down there
[55:39] on a platform when he run through the
[55:41] platform much safe he fell down grabbed
[55:43] out his Rosary I I told him it's not
[55:45] necessary and to The Interpreter brother
[55:48] penosa so he raised up he put his arms
[55:50] around again going somewhere he was
[55:51] lying I looked at him I looked at him
[55:54] old wrinkled up feet probably never wore
[55:56] shoes in his eyes I looked at my shoes
[55:59] said f him I give him a shoes he was
[56:04] blind now I look he was a wider across
[56:07] his shoulders big man weigh 200 and
[56:10] something I guess he couldn't wear him a
[56:12] coat and as he was standing there in the
[56:14] gray hair I thought him a daddy I
[56:16] thought if Daddy would have lived to be
[56:18] about this age he'd have been about the
[56:21] same age man this around 65 70 years old
[56:26] and I entered into a love of that man to
[56:29] a way that I thought maybe he never had
[56:31] a decent meal in his life maybe he ever
[56:34] sat down at a table in his
[56:37] life and all this and then walking
[56:41] around the
[56:42] darkness then something come into my
[56:46] heart God be merciful he's a man he's a
[56:52] brother then when that's right there's
[56:55] something on
[56:57] amen there's a creation moves
[57:01] around and you it's projected to this
[57:04] person in a few moments I heard him
[57:06] hiring something over my shoulder and he
[57:08] was H I can see I can
[57:11] see what was it Divine
[57:14] love sympathy had been projected by the
[57:18] Holy Spirit into this man and by that at
[57:23] the end of the road where he couldn't
[57:25] nothing to be done and love had taken
[57:28] its place and love had met love then s
[57:32] went to work and God Who s Grace
[57:35] restored the sight to the man see first
[57:39] you have to enter into that St that's
[57:42] what you have to do to a
[57:44] sinner many people pray for Sinners
[57:47] that's all right but that's not the way
[57:49] to win a sinner it's your business to
[57:52] win the center you don't win by playing
[57:54] for him you win win wining by talking to
[57:58] him and introducing to him Christ that's
[58:02] your business that's your duty is to win
[58:06] Sinners by talking to them and
[58:09] projecting to them the love of God
[58:11] through the word of God that wins the
[58:13] cner some say I you go church I sure
[58:16] like that woman I like that color
[58:18] because you're winning that if you stay
[58:20] home and just pray for the sinner never
[58:22] went to contact him there very little
[58:24] can be done but you you got to pray and
[58:27] then go that's go and do it now the
[58:31] projecting of this love here a few days
[58:34] ago I was listening to a
[58:36] testimony of um a great plow
[58:39] manufacturer standing on the platform
[58:42] well there's that businessman from
[58:43] around the world sitting on the platform
[58:46] and this plow man he got up he said well
[58:48] I didn't know why I had to be operated
[58:51] on and I love the man and he's a great
[58:54] follower of brother Robert
[58:56] our
[58:57] friends and so once he said when I found
[59:00] out that I was getting sick and having
[59:02] Stone trouble kidney stone I went to eat
[59:05] dinner with brother or and said brother
[59:07] or got up and said um brother I I see
[59:12] that you're in distress so he said I'm
[59:15] I'm going to pray for you and he said
[59:17] well praise the Lord I just want you to
[59:19] say that brother oral and said oral come
[59:22] over and put his hands on his kidneys
[59:23] and said I reuke this kidney stone and
[59:26] to leave this man immediately and said
[59:28] when he did it said I got released and
[59:32] said just a little while and come back
[59:33] again said I went again to brother or
[59:37] and said he prayed again I got released
[59:39] but the Every Time come back it come wor
