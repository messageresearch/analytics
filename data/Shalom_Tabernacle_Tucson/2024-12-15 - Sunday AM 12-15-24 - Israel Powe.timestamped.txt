[3:40] Jesus Christ the end of this verse let's
[3:43] read it and being turned I saw seven
[3:45] golden candlesticks and in the midst of
[3:48] the seven golden candlesticks one like
[3:50] the son of
[3:52] man
[3:53] my did you notice
[3:56] Stars candlesticks lamps what is does it
[4:00] mean what does this mean that the
[4:02] dispensation that we're living in is
[4:05] nighttime channels and lights and stars
[4:08] me
[4:09] night and what does a star do it
[4:12] reflects the light of the sun until the
[4:15] sun
[4:16] returns blessed be the name of the Lord
[4:19] and a true minister of God don't reflect
[4:22] some flashlight some match them some sh
[4:26] a burning he reflects the golden
[4:28] Radiance of Christ
[4:31] to the church that he's the same and
[4:32] he's alive and he shine on me amen
[4:36] that's the light he reflects the star
[4:38] reflects the light of the sun see so
[4:40] we're reflecting the light of the Son of
[4:43] God doing the same thing he did given
[4:46] life what kind of Life Gospel Life For
[4:49] Those now let's watch in this a little
[4:51] further as we take the rest of this uh
[4:55] 13th verse and in the midst that's the
[4:57] middle of the golden six one like the
[5:00] son of man clo with a garment down to
[5:03] the foot and GED about the paps with a
[5:07] golden girl now here's more proof that
[5:10] this Doctrine is right about being the
[5:12] Lord's
[5:13] day did you notice him he was not a
[5:16] priest during this time neither was he a
[5:21] king he was a
[5:24] judge notice a priest the high priest
[5:28] when he went into the sanctuary or went
[5:30] to minister to service he tied himself
[5:33] around the waist tying his girdle around
[5:36] the waist meant that he was
[5:40] serving never tied over his shoulder but
[5:43] here he comes out walking out with the
[5:47] girdle tied around the top with a sash
[5:51] over his shoulder GED about the PLS the
[5:55] breast with a golden girl GED up high
[5:58] what is it I an attorney a
[6:02] judge the judge with his sash over his
[6:04] shoulder G it up here knock down as a
[6:08] priest see that shows he was in his
[6:10] priesthood now John went all the way
[6:13] over into the Lord's day and saw him
[6:15] coming as the
[6:17] judge you believe he's a judge let's
[6:20] read St John 5:22 right quick we see
[6:22] whether a judge or
[6:24] Not St John 5 and 22
[6:33] for the father judges no man but has all
[6:38] judgment unto the son am that
[6:42] right he is the judge the Supreme judge
[6:46] and John shows that he wasn't in the day
[6:48] of his prophecy as a prophet neither was
[6:51] he come out into the days of his
[6:53] kingship but he was in the day of the
[6:55] Lord as a judge now how many knows that
[6:59] that the priest having his girdle is
[7:02] string around his waistline meant he was
[7:04] in service Anyone who reads the
[7:06] Testaments and knows the Old Testament
[7:08] knows that when a priest is GED around
[7:10] here he's in service he's a servant but
[7:12] he was GED up here a judge let's read a
[7:16] little
[7:17] farther a golden girl was about the PS
[7:21] that's right up around here he was a
[7:22] judge now we're going to read the
[7:26] Sevenfold Glory of his person oh oh my
[7:30] this makes me shot before I get to
[7:32] it
[7:34] notice oh this is such a wonderful thing
[7:38] just
[7:39] listen and his head now watch he seven
[7:43] things here he misses his head his hair
[7:46] his eyes his feet his voice seven things
[7:50] he mentioned here the Sevenfold Glory of
[7:53] Jesus Christ let me read
[7:54] it his head and his hair was white as
[7:58] wool as white as snow his eyes were a
[8:01] flames of fire his feet like fine brass
[8:04] as if it had been burnt in the furnace
[8:06] and his voice a sound of many Waters and
[8:09] in and he had in his right hand Seven
[8:12] Stars and out of his mouth goes a sharp
[8:15] two a sword and his countenance was like
[8:18] the sun shining in its strength what a
[8:21] vision what did he see here the
[8:25] glorified Son of God and Assemble now
[8:30] let's let's just be ready now oh my I
[8:33] thought that was nine it's only eight I
[8:34] haven't got started yet all right that
[8:38] is good amen now sorry these brethen

[8:47] anything I could do I'd sure do it now I
[8:49] want you to get this so bad and stand a
[8:52] little while and God reward you richly
[8:54] is my prayer now now notice the first
[8:58] thing I we notice his head and his hair
[9:00] was white like
[9:03] wool his head and his hair was quite
[9:08] like
[9:11] wool now it does not mean that he was
[9:15] aged that did this that wasn't the
[9:18] reason of it he wasn't aged to do this
[9:20] he was it was because of his experience
[9:23] and qualification in his wisdom because
[9:27] he's Eternal and eternal cannot Aid
[9:31] you understand let's turn first we we
[9:34] picture him out here this we'll find out
[9:35] what he is now let's turn to Daniel 79
[9:39] just a minute you see the same picture
[9:41] in Daniel where he comes as over here at
[9:44] the ancient of time and most everybody
[9:47] Bible scholar knows exactly where we're
[9:50] heading for right now Daniel 7 and the
[9:53] ninth

[9:58] the harm
[10:00] and behold there came up another little
[10:02] horn before whom there were three out of
[10:06] the first horns plucked up by the roots
[10:09] and behold in this horn there were eyes
[10:11] like a man and a mouth speaking great
[10:14] things and I beheld until the Thrones

[10:47] set whose garments was white as snow and
[10:51] the hair of his head was like pure
[10:54] wool Ancient of Days his throne was like
[10:59] a a fiery flame and his wheels were
[11:02] burning

[11:45] amenah not his priest not his King not
[11:49] his Prophet but his judge the father St
[11:53] John 522 committed all judgment to him
[11:55] and he's judge now come to judge the
[11:57] Nations all for that day when you see
[12:00] him like that his hair was as white as
[12:02] snow Daniel saw him coming to the
[12:04] Ancient of Days watch him blend these
[12:06] two together all
[12:09] right uh and the Judgment was set and
[12:11] the books were open and I beheld then be
[12:16] and I beheld them because of the voice
[12:18] of the
[12:19] great uh great words which the hor know
[12:23] I've got the wrong place hav't him
[12:25] Daniel 7 and n yeah here we are and he
[12:31] SS and a fiery stream issued forth and
[12:33] came from him and tens of thousands came
[12:34] and Minister unto him and I beheld then
[12:37] because of the voice of the great words
[12:40] which the horn spake and I beheld even
[12:43] until the Beast was slain and his body
[12:45] was destroyed and given to the the
[12:47] burning
[12:48] flames as concerning the restr of the
[12:51] Beast they all had their Dominion taken
[12:53] away that's all the Gentile powers and
[12:56] kingdoms will
[12:57] fall yet their lives were prolonged for
[13:00] a season in time and I saw in the night
[13:03] vision and behold one like the son of
[13:07] man come in clouds of Heaven how do we
[13:10] see him coming this morning in the third
[13:12] verse coming in the Clouds Of Heaven the
[13:16] son of man one like to the son of man
[13:18] coming in the Clouds Of Heaven and he
[13:20] came to the Ancient of Days and they
[13:21] brought him now before him and there was
[13:23] given him a dominion and glory and a
[13:25] kingdom and all people Nation languages
[13:30] should serve him this Dominion is an
[13:33] everlasting Dominion which shall not
[13:35] pass away and his kingdom shall his
[13:39] kingdom that which shall not be
[13:42] destroyed come to the Ancient of Days
[13:46] whose hair was white as wool and John
[13:49] turned and he saw one like the son of
[13:51] man standing in the midst of the seven
[13:53] golden candlesticks with a Snow White
[13:56] hair the judge not GED around the waist
[14:00] but GED around the pths up here a judge
[14:04] amen with the flash of the judge over
[14:07] shoulder he still with a golden pure
[14:10] holy refined girl that held his
[14:14] righteousness is covered he was covered
[14:18] all the way to the feet watch the
[14:21] Sevenfold manifestation of his person
[14:23] and
[14:25] Glory
[14:26] now I believe the 14th vers
[14:30] hair his head and his hair was as white
[14:33] as like wool as white as snow and his
[14:39] eyes were a flames of fire head hair
[14:45] eyes were like flames of
[14:48] fire think of it those eyes who once was
[14:52] dim with human
[14:55] tears now as to come flames of fire
[14:59] in Anger he stands there as an angry
[15:01] judge why did you reject him oh sinner
[15:04] think of
[15:06] this think of it lukewarm church
[15:10] member think of it Catholic Baptist
[15:13] Presbyterian
[15:14] Pentecostal think of a Catholic your
[15:17] Virgin Mary had to go up to Pentecost
[15:19] and receive the Holy Ghost and stagger
[15:21] and act like a drunk woman the very
[15:23] mother of Christ had to get that before
[15:25] she'd be permitted to Heaven how are you
[15:27] women going to get there anything less
[15:28] than that
[15:30] amen think of it
[15:33] man each of you is hair and his eyes
[15:38] once dim with human tears yet I want you
[15:40] to notice something about those eyes
[15:42] when he was on Earth yet they were dim
[15:44] with tears like a man for he cried at
[15:47] the grave of
[15:49] Lazarus right full of sympathy his
[15:54] Humanity he was clothed he was God
[15:57] clothed in humanity
[16:00] in order to take away sin but yet behind
[16:02] that Humanity he had something behind
[16:05] that could look right down at the heart
[16:06] of a man and know all about
[16:08] him why there was something behind
[16:11] him yet he was clothed in martal flesh
[16:14] but they didn't know who it was if you
[16:17] don't believe he said that I am he you
[16:18] will die your sins that's right if I do
[16:23] not the works of my father then believe
[16:25] me not but if I do the works of my
[16:27] father then believe the works if you
[16:28] can't believe me me oh how he tried to
[16:31] get the message to him the Revelation
[16:33] can look right down into the heart of a
[16:35] man know all about
[16:38] him how I think of that those eyes that
[16:42] once pierced over the mountains looked
[16:44] into the face of suffering and could
[16:46] weep like a man but yet could take the
[16:49] spirit of God behind that human Vision
[16:51] there and see all things things which
[16:55] was things which would were and things
[16:57] which would come for tell the end from
[17:00] the
[17:01] beginning that's because God was behind
[17:03] them human eyes amen let God come into
[17:06] your life and take control of you and
[17:08] he'll show you things to come for it's
[17:11] not you no more it's the holy spirit in

[1:06:30] George wasn't preaching he didn't say
[1:06:33] that that's what he told me so we was
[1:06:36] going to have you take the service
[1:06:37] George but he said you like that too he
[1:06:40] said I did like it kind of
[1:06:42] so so they kind of tease that way they
[1:06:45] love each other he good friends with the
[1:06:48] uh with the Moors and so God bless them
[1:06:52] so much before we go into the word this
[1:06:54] morning I just wanted to share a brief I
[1:06:57] try to keep it as brief as possible a
[1:07:00] testimony on uh how we acquired the
[1:07:03] building we closed on that building on
[1:07:06] Thursday so praise the Lord amen amen
[1:07:09] let's give the Lord a and of
[1:07:12] praise and I'll just go over a few notes
[1:07:16] that really are blessed in how it came
[1:07:20] about
[1:07:21] in as you all know we've been meeting
[1:07:23] here at this location
[1:07:26] uh for nine years
[1:07:29] and um they have always been very kind
[1:07:32] and very friendly to us as far as the
[1:07:36] price that we're paying for this
[1:07:39] location and um so when I would start to
[1:07:44] complain I'd have to stop complaining
[1:07:48] when I look around at the blessing that
[1:07:50] the lord gave us I mean there's a lot we
[1:07:52] can say about the sound or layout or
[1:07:55] whatever
[1:07:56] but the Lord laid it out gave us this
[1:07:57] place very very affordable for us we
[1:08:02] didn't realize how affordable it was
[1:08:03] until we started to realize that we'd
[1:08:07] have to leave from here so the property
[1:08:09] owners which is the school district here
[1:08:12] has sold this to developers and they
[1:08:15] were in the works for two or three years
[1:08:19] of planning to repurpose this property
[1:08:22] here so that would mean we would have to
[1:08:24] leave
[1:08:25] and so the we we knew that um they sent
[1:08:31] us the warning or the letter preparing
[1:08:34] us that we had we would have six months
[1:08:38] and so that would put us I think right
[1:08:40] around March or so the previous year
[1:08:43] they had given us six months or so but
[1:08:45] they weren't for sure and then they you
[1:08:48] know that had given us right around
[1:08:50] March or April of um that would have
[1:08:54] been of this this year and so 2023 we
[1:08:59] were really on the clock to trying to
[1:09:02] find a place and uh um I can't tell you
[1:09:07] the stress it is to think of where are
[1:09:09] we going to go you know and you know we
[1:09:13] can rent a school we can go to you know
[1:09:15] rent another place but then we looked
[1:09:18] and you know for square foot we're
[1:09:21] getting the best deal in the city what
[1:09:23] we're paying per square foot and so
[1:09:26] this little property on Mountain came up
[1:09:29] and I can't remember who found it but I
[1:09:31] know there sister Carina yes and so give
[1:09:34] her a high five at the end of the
[1:09:36] service and uh it sent it through she
[1:09:39] sent she sister Carlina has found many
[1:09:41] properties as brother Joe and others my
[1:09:43] wife this one we uh the first time I
[1:09:46] went there was in February and so
[1:09:50] brother John I I went there with him and
[1:09:53] we looked at it on Mount and and I
[1:09:56] didn't I likeed the property it was nice
[1:09:59] it didn't really catch my heart really I
[1:10:02] to be honest because it was so close to
[1:10:05] brother Caleb's work and I know of all
[1:10:08] of the Pastors in the city if I have a
[1:10:10] good work working relationship it is
[1:10:12] with brother Caleb donon and so
[1:10:16] um but just doing my diligence with him
[1:10:21] I had called him and told him that it's
[1:10:23] a possibility but it's it's not
[1:10:25] something that I really desire but we
[1:10:27] might have you know that might be the
[1:10:29] only thing on the market or so forth and
[1:10:32] he had just wonderful you know praise
[1:10:34] and Open Arms of uh you know just no
[1:10:39] problem at all brother Israel so we're
[1:10:40] friends and that respect and so um that
[1:10:45] was that was good but I still had a
[1:10:47] little reservation
[1:10:49] so brother Robert
[1:10:51] figuroa good friend of mine um um Pastor
[1:10:56] there in Fort
[1:10:57] wuka he called me and or sent me a text
[1:11:02] back this was in February about some
[1:11:06] meetings taking place in Wares the city
[1:11:09] of Wares and if you know Wares is one of
[1:11:11] the most dangerous cities in Mexico on
[1:11:13] the border murders happen all the time
[1:11:16] and and and so forth but that's besides
[1:11:18] the point he sent that invitation to me
[1:11:21] that um he would like to go there's an
[1:11:25] invitation there and the brother there
[1:11:28] would like for him and I to go but if I
[1:11:32] don't go that he probably wouldn't go
[1:11:36] you see how he did that and so I said I
[1:11:39] don't know and he says I'm not going to
[1:11:42] he said I'm not going to drive there by
[1:11:43] myself brother Israel so a week passed
[1:11:45] and I kind of left it and he called the
[1:11:49] brother and told him brother GTO I don't
[1:11:52] think it's going to work out for us to
[1:11:54] go
[1:11:56] the day he calls him that next Saturday
[1:11:59] that's when I finally call him I says
[1:12:02] brother Robert I think I might want to
[1:12:03] go with you so he called the brother and
[1:12:06] then they set it in motion so that was
[1:12:09] on a Friday we um his meetings were the
[1:12:13] 8th 9th and 10th that Friday the 8th was
[1:12:17] when I um took that trip but I had
[1:12:22] already saw the building with John and
[1:12:25] the rest of the board and
[1:12:28] Believers went and saw the building that
[1:12:32] I think it was that Friday morning is
[1:12:34] what it was and I couldn't be there with
[1:12:36] you all because I was going to those
[1:12:37] meetings so when I get uh go on this
[1:12:40] trip soon as I crossed the border and
[1:12:42] sat down in the meetings the Lord really
[1:12:45] impressed it upon my heart that I should
[1:12:48] be a part of these brothers lives more
[1:12:51] right here in Mexico they're they're
[1:12:54] right next to us I've always got an Open
[1:12:56] Door there um just follow the love is
[1:13:00] what I like to say wherever the love is
[1:13:02] go with
[1:13:04] that sometimes you want people to love
[1:13:06] you it ain't there go where the love is
[1:13:09] and so they've always always have an
[1:13:11] open door there and I've kind of
[1:13:12] neglected them I'd say and while in
[1:13:15] those meeting I said you know I need to
[1:13:17] make an effort to see my brothers down
[1:13:19] here a bit more and help them and you
[1:13:23] know
[1:13:25] maybe focused towards missionary work in
[1:13:27] a more comprehensive way the same time
[1:13:31] this brother Jonathan Miller the same
[1:13:34] March the 7th right in there March the
[1:13:36] eth he's trying to prepare for his
[1:13:38] Easter meetings he's in Jamaica and he
[1:13:41] was calling me while I'm on my way there
[1:13:44] so when the Lord deals with me on this
[1:13:47] giving and being a part of a missionary
[1:13:50] um deal this is when Jonathan is calling
[1:13:54] me and I told him I can't be gone from
[1:13:56] our church on Easter but if we can send
[1:13:59] someone would that be okay oh brother
[1:14:01] Israel yeah that'd be great so brother
[1:14:04] George was available contacted him he
[1:14:07] went there just had a wonderful time
[1:14:10] this little church took up an offering
[1:14:13] and uh supported that little Ministry
[1:14:15] there when we have our own needs here
[1:14:18] and so but the Lord just really
[1:14:21] impressed that upon my heart so after
[1:14:25] after that so after we made that
[1:14:28] commitment to um missionary work down in
[1:14:32] Mexico made the commitment to go to
[1:14:35] Jamaica then I get a email from our
[1:14:39] lease here
[1:14:42] that guess what we have an we might have
[1:14:44] another six months to a year and we
[1:14:47] don't have to worry about leaving
[1:14:50] now during the time when we were trying
[1:14:53] to figure out our dates and times we
[1:14:56] went and saw the
[1:14:57] property um I have an email where John
[1:15:00] sent to me and brother Chris a
[1:15:03] proposed offer for $900,000 is what we
[1:15:07] would offer that's what they were asking
[1:15:10] that's what we would
[1:15:11] offer for this property this building
[1:15:14] that was on a um that was on a Tuesday
[1:15:18] or Wednesday and then Wednesday night we
[1:15:22] had a meeting after the service if you
[1:15:24] all remember some of you remember about
[1:15:27] how we should do this our brother Chuck
[1:15:29] King was involved and the conditions of
[1:15:32] the church and what everybody thought
[1:15:34] and what we could afford and it was just
[1:15:38] um you know so that was on our mind that
[1:15:41] was on our heart and that was in the um
[1:15:45] the proposal and we thought well maybe
[1:15:47] we can offer $850,000
[1:15:50] um the first proposal was $900,000
[1:15:53] well after we made the commitment for
[1:15:56] the missionary work then you know they
[1:16:00] gave us another year basically another
[1:16:02] six months so this is in
[1:16:05] March also in March I started that
[1:16:08] little series on conduct order IND
[1:16:10] Doctrine and on that Wednesday night I
[1:16:13] believe I was in fasting and
[1:16:16] prayer and I did conduct I think there
[1:16:20] were six services on that
[1:16:23] order uh for four or five services on
[1:16:26] that and then on Doctrine just on
[1:16:27] Wednesday night 30 minutes 40 minutes or
[1:16:30] so um this particular service I
[1:16:34] know the amount of people because I
[1:16:37] started to count and brother Joe knew
[1:16:39] how many people were in the service
[1:16:40] there was 41 of us and I said how I said
[1:16:43] if this little group here would just
[1:16:45] pray and fast what God would do I said
[1:16:48] how many people here I started to count
[1:16:49] and Joe said 41 I said we got a counter
[1:16:52] in the room so he knew how how many
[1:16:55] people were here and I was looking at
[1:16:56] that service uh just the other night um
[1:17:01] just going back um and what I would like
[1:17:05] you to
[1:17:06] do you Believers you Saints is to pray
[1:17:11] and fast for my trip to Tanzania okay
[1:17:16] please do that for
[1:17:18] me I don't have to know it's you doing
[1:17:21] it just do it please if you can carve
[1:17:24] out a time to fast and pray and if you
[1:17:27] can get that service I'd like you to go
[1:17:29] back not to hear
[1:17:31] me but you hear your podcast whatever
[1:17:33] else you hear but so let me get off of
[1:17:36] that but take just take those quotations
[1:17:39] on fasting and prayer that I brought in
[1:17:41] that service and it'll bring you up to
[1:17:44] speed on what the word says about it and
[1:17:47] the power that's in it and so and that
[1:17:50] service was in October no that was in
[1:17:53] March the
[1:17:57] um the 13th 313 on a Wednesday night you
[1:18:02] get a chance to get that I know all of
[1:18:04] you didn't hear it because there's only
[1:18:06] 41 of you
[1:18:07] there okay
[1:18:10] um and now to set you in mind for the
[1:18:13] power of fasting and Pur so that conduct
[1:18:15] order and Doctrine I talked about the um
[1:18:19] one of the greatest
[1:18:22] singular carnal
[1:18:25] outlooks on determining the spirituality
[1:18:29] of an individual meaning if God is
[1:18:33] dealing with someone just on the
[1:18:36] outward we will be able to see that
[1:18:39] based simply upon your church
[1:18:41] attendance when God is dealing with
[1:18:43] someone you'll notice they'll start
[1:18:46] making it to the house of the Lord when
[1:18:48] the Believers gather together now that's
[1:18:51] not judging everybody that doesn't come
[1:18:53] or everybody that does come but it is an
[1:18:56] indication when God is dealing with
[1:18:59] someone they will be in the house of the
[1:19:01] Lord that's how we know you when I go
[1:19:04] visit other churches they'll say man
[1:19:06] he's been coming he was here last night
[1:19:08] he came last Sunday then we know God is
[1:19:11] dealing with you just an outward carnal
[1:19:13] thing and so that was in part of that
[1:19:15] conduct order and Doctrine but I'd like
[1:19:17] you to to get that oh sorry thank you
[1:19:20] musicians you can take your
[1:19:23] seats and and uh we spoke on the post of
[1:19:27] Duty and those things and uh I really
[1:19:30] believe that was the Lord leading us on
[1:19:34] that
[1:19:35] because I spoke on giving and in and
[1:19:41] that was in March we made that
[1:19:43] commitment we had start to write up an
[1:19:46] offer for 900,000 for this building and
[1:19:50] then here we are in
[1:19:53] December um
[1:19:55] we closed on that property I think we
[1:19:58] offered
[1:20:01] $480,000 and so in the space of nine
[1:20:05] months when we were about to or ready to
[1:20:10] offer to purchase a building that's
[1:20:12] worth every penny of it the Lord took in
[1:20:15] nine months
[1:20:17] time and cut the price of this building
[1:20:19] in
[1:20:21] half and
[1:20:22] so as I've heard Brother Scott
[1:20:25] say that's a Red Sea
[1:20:29] miracle and that is beyond anything that
[1:20:32] anyone can do or
[1:20:35] think we we sat in this room brother
[1:20:38] John and I with the with the developer
[1:20:41] himself we was in the back room there
[1:20:43] this is before our meetings and as we
[1:20:46] met there fine gentleman very wealthy
[1:20:48] man obviously and he was listening to
[1:20:52] our needs and what we want and
[1:20:55] and he made the suggestions that maybe
[1:20:58] you go pursue that property on mountain
[1:21:01] and so that's what we did John went and
[1:21:04] looked at that and saw it on the market
[1:21:08] reached out it's a different agent
[1:21:12] and um before the meetings they um
[1:21:17] wanted to offer
[1:21:20] $750,000 and they would carry us which
[1:21:22] is a blessing and
[1:21:25] and John said well let's talk about it
[1:21:27] after the meetings I said yes let's get
[1:21:29] through our meetings we get through our
[1:21:31] meetings that Monday
[1:21:33] morning um or Tuesday John gets a text
[1:21:39] that they uh would take
[1:21:42] $460,000 a cash offer just over the
[1:21:45] space of the meetings and I have to say
[1:21:48] that you know the the Integrity of
[1:21:51] brother John's testimony has been just
[1:21:53] really highlight ited through this
[1:21:56] process the the gentleman Marcel was
[1:21:59] going to lend us up to $100,000 or more
[1:22:04] not based on knowing us he doesn't know
[1:22:07] us but based on John's
[1:22:10] relationship same thing with how we got
[1:22:12] into the property how we were the first
[1:22:14] ones to look at it was the agent knew
[1:22:18] John and there was a relationship there
[1:22:20] so I really appreciate that he did a
[1:22:23] phenomenal job of just his detailing
[1:22:27] work and the Lord just really
[1:22:29] highlighted that to me that your name
[1:22:32] goes beyond and you just never know when
[1:22:35] you need
[1:22:36] someone and um when we were going to
[1:22:39] offer that
[1:22:41] here brother John put in the notes let's
[1:22:44] offer them 900,000 we'll ask them to
[1:22:47] give us a 100 days and he said they
[1:22:50] probably won't take it but that will tie
[1:22:51] up the property and we can find
[1:22:52] financing and we're going through all of
[1:22:54] that and this gentleman held on to it
[1:22:57] held on to it and waited to show anyone
[1:23:01] else the property just on the strength
[1:23:03] of John's testimony with
[1:23:05] him um and so as we were waiting and
[1:23:09] trying and finding then we find out that
[1:23:11] we didn't need to we had six more months
[1:23:14] and so in that six months time Look What
[1:23:17] the Lord Has Done For
[1:23:19] Us that after our meetings that Tuesday
[1:23:23] morning I had was having breakfast with
[1:23:26] a fine Brother that's Jesse Lynn's
[1:23:28] brother brother Jonathan and the Lord
[1:23:31] answered something in our time together
[1:23:34] uh with him something very private to
[1:23:37] me as we were uh sitting there talking
[1:23:42] and
[1:23:44] um the um that's when the text came
[1:23:48] about you know that they would take a
[1:23:49] cash offer and so
[1:23:52] forth few days later a week later it was
[1:23:57] on a Monday I have a dream and in this
[1:23:59] dream I see brother
[1:24:03] John let me see yes in this dream I I
[1:24:07] have I see brother John with a check for
[1:24:11] $10,500 and it was going towards the
[1:24:13] building fund and I looked at I was like
[1:24:16] man that's a lot of money for him to be
[1:24:19] giv to the church fund now that dream
[1:24:23] can still happen that way
[1:24:25] but that that wasn't aam cuz the dreams
[1:24:29] could compound so let's you know let's
[1:24:31] let let's let the Lord do what he wants
[1:24:34] to do but but in this dream I was
[1:24:37] thinking that's a lot of money John
[1:24:39] giving to the building fund wow
[1:24:42] $10,500 and so when we got ready to give
[1:24:44] the earnest
[1:24:45] money um and John told us we needed a
[1:24:49] check then it re it reminded me well
[1:24:53] that's that's what that deposit check
[1:24:55] should be for $10,500 and I placed that
[1:24:58] check in his hand right back
[1:25:05] here
[1:25:07] so so they accepted our offer and we
[1:25:12] closed on it on December the 12th and we
[1:25:16] give God praise for
[1:25:22] it now
[1:25:26] and so there's so much more I can say
[1:25:27] but with the building I'm praying for a
[1:25:35] Revival how many would
[1:25:37] prefer thank God for a building amen how
[1:25:40] many wants a Revival an
[1:25:43] outpouring of the Holy Spirit and if he
[1:25:47] can give me a building give us a

[1:25:57] little bit of the testimony The Lord Is

[1:26:28] dates and times but the lord gave me a
[1:26:31] little different direction and then I

[1:27:05] of whom shall I be
[1:27:15] afraid though a host should encamp
[1:27:18] against me my heart shall not fear
[1:27:21] though War should rise against me and
[1:27:23] this will I be
[1:27:39] confident for in the time of trouble he
[1:27:42] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[1:27:45] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:27:47] me he shall set me up upon a
[1:27:51] rock my be lifted up

[1:29:08] good courage and he shall strengthen
[1:29:11] thine heart wait I say on the Lord amen
[1:29:16] praise the Lord a word to the church
[1:29:19] found in Proverbs chapter 20
[1:29:35] I believe it's where I want
[1:30:13] in
[1:30:14] verse
[1:30:19] number get it for you here
[1:30:34] verse
[1:30:36] 19 he that goeth about as a tail Bearer
[1:30:41] reveal
[1:30:43] Secrets therefore meddle not with him
[1:30:47] that flattereth with his
[1:30:49] lips Proverbs 26 was the next scripture
[1:30:53] I wanted to to take and that's found in
[1:30:56] verse number
[1:30:59] 20 Proverbs 26 verse 20 where no wood is
[1:31:05] there the fire goeth out so where there
[1:31:08] is no teral Bearer or gossiper or
[1:31:12] Tattler The Strife
[1:31:15] ceases may God add a blessing to the
[1:31:18] reading of his word you may be seated a
[1:31:19] word to the church and we're going to
[1:31:22] speak just a littleit bit about
[1:31:26] this tail Bearer the gossip okay and
[1:31:32] this is not a
[1:31:35] uh it's not a rebuke only if it is a
[1:31:38] rebuke
[1:31:42] okay brother bam was dealing with in a
[1:31:45] sermon here that he uh spoke
[1:31:50] on in the church in its condition he
[1:31:55] says this here in paragraph number
[1:31:58] 64 he says here one time I preached just
[1:32:01] as hard as I could preach in a certain
[1:32:03] city and there was thousands of people
[1:32:06] there I made an altar call I thought I
[1:32:09] covered the whole realm of sin I covered
[1:32:13] everything that I could think of that
[1:32:17] night after the service over a very
[1:32:19] prissy little woman walked by she said
[1:32:22] well brother brandham I'm sure glad that
[1:32:25] you didn't touch me
[1:32:27] tonight I thought that must be a real
[1:32:30] Christian said you didn't touch me
[1:32:33] tonight I said well I'm certainly glad
[1:32:35] to hear that lady you must be close to
[1:32:38] the kingdom of God and she tipped away
[1:32:42] some elderly lady standing there I said
[1:32:45] say do you know that woman yes I said
[1:32:48] she must be a real Christian said one
[1:32:51] thing you fail to hit tonight brother
[1:32:53] Brandon that was
[1:32:56] gossip she's the chief gossiper in the
[1:33:00] country there you are that's it see
[1:33:06] now we'll we'll take a Old Testament
[1:33:09] example if the Lord would help us just
[1:33:11] for a few moments with Absalon but and I
[1:33:15] start to look at this this gossip and
[1:33:17] what it does and the three uh
[1:33:20] individuals that are involved in it you
[1:33:23] you have the one that's doing the
[1:33:26] talking you have the one that's doing
[1:33:28] the listening and then you have the one
[1:33:31] that's being talked
[1:33:33] about and as you break these three
[1:33:35] Dynamics down we've uh it's 100%
[1:33:40] sure that somebody will bring gossip to
[1:33:46] you that's without question and it's
[1:33:49] also 100% sure that you will probably be
[1:33:53] the talked
[1:33:56] about now you being the one doing the
[1:34:00] talking the
[1:34:01] gossiper um we're probably all been
[1:34:04] guilty of
[1:34:05] it um if we'll be real honest we we love
[1:34:09] to gossip we love to talk about other
[1:34:12] people's matters but that's that's the
[1:34:16] person that you have control over you do
[1:34:19] not have control over someone wanting to
[1:34:21] bring gossip to you and you do not have
[1:34:25] control over someone talking about you
[1:34:29] and so as we look into this I like us to
[1:34:33] focus in on the part that we can control
[1:34:36] yes and that is this um lending the near
[1:34:41] you know the Proverbs is very clear on
[1:34:45] when the wood is gone the fire leaves
[1:34:48] all right and when you get rid of the
[1:34:50] tail Bearer then the fighting will stop
[1:34:54] yeah it's people talking it's the
[1:34:57] Chatters the back and forth it's talking
[1:35:00] on frivolous matters I think the
[1:35:02] definition of it is talking on matters
[1:35:05] that don't concern you I mean you can
[1:35:08] just be talking and chatting about the
[1:35:10] weather or whatever you're talking about
[1:35:12] but then when you go to try to influence
[1:35:14] matters or people or things that don't
[1:35:16] concern you that's when it goes over
[1:35:19] into the realm of Gossip so this is a
[1:35:23] very
[1:35:24] simple subject but it's very interesting
[1:35:26] if we look at what the human being is
[1:35:29] and we're going to do that in this
[1:35:32] message that brother brandom preached
[1:35:37] the
[1:35:39] um where he he says that we have the
[1:35:42] three rings that make up it's in the
[1:35:45] message the greatest battle ever fault
[1:35:48] paragraph number
[1:35:50] 68 he says this here see if I can get it
[1:35:53] here here I know they'll pick it up for
[1:35:55] me
[1:35:58] here and the greatest battle ever fought
[1:36:02] paragraph number 68 is where we'll start
[1:36:05] all right when this greatest battle
[1:36:07] started on Earth there had to be a
[1:36:10] mutual meeting place there had to be a
[1:36:12] place selected for the battle to begin
[1:36:16] and for the battle to rage and that
[1:36:19] Battlegrounds begin in the human mind
[1:36:22] there's where the battle starts the
[1:36:24] human mind was chosen for the place of
[1:36:26] the battle where it was to begin and
[1:36:29] that is because that decisions are made
[1:36:33] from the mind the head now they never
[1:36:36] started it from some organization they
[1:36:38] never started it from some mechanical
[1:36:40] Affair the grounds never started there
[1:36:43] therefore that organization can never
[1:36:46] never do the work of God because the
[1:36:49] Battlegrounds where you've got to meet
[1:36:51] your enemy is is in the mind you've got
[1:36:56] to make your choice it meets you I want
[1:37:01] this little girl here that's very sick
[1:37:02] to be sure to listen now to this real
[1:37:05] closely decisions are made in the mind
[1:37:09] the head there's where Satan meets you
[1:37:12] and the decisions are because that God
[1:37:15] made a man that way now I have you if
[1:37:19] you was looking on my Note here a little
[1:37:21] map drawn out I had had it here not long
[1:37:24] ago I use on the board the human being
[1:37:27] is made up just like a grain of
[1:37:30] wheat it's a seed and the human being is
[1:37:34] a seed physically you're the seed of
[1:37:37] your father and your mother and the life
[1:37:40] come from the Father the pulp come from
[1:37:43] the mother so the two together the egg
[1:37:46] and the blood comes together and in the
[1:37:48] blood cell is life and in there it
[1:37:52] begins
[1:37:54] develop making the child now any seed
[1:37:56] has a shell on the Outside Inside is the
[1:37:59] pulp and inside of the pulp is a germ of
[1:38:02] life well that's the way we're made we
[1:38:05] are Body Soul and Spirit the outside the
[1:38:09] body the shell the inside of that
[1:38:12] conscience and so forth is the soul and
[1:38:14] the inside of the soul is the spirit and
[1:38:18] the spirit governs all the other now if
[1:38:23] you'll see sit down when you get home
[1:38:25] and draw three little
[1:38:27] rings you'll find out that the outside
[1:38:31] body has five senses it's contacted by
[1:38:36] and that that is SE taste Fu smell here
[1:38:40] that's the five senses that control the
[1:38:42] human body inside of the body is a soul
[1:38:46] and that soul is controlled by
[1:38:47] imaginations conscience memory reasons
[1:38:50] affection that's the thing that controls
[1:38:54] the soul but the spirit it only has one
[1:39:00] sense the spirit has one sense and that
[1:39:03] sense is either dominates it is Faith or
[1:39:08] doubt so let's look at the diagram of
[1:39:11] That Body Soul and Spirit this is what
[1:39:16] makes up the human
[1:39:18] being the human being has got to be the
[1:39:21] most interesting creature on on the
[1:39:24] planet they're very very different and
[1:39:30] difficult to read the human
[1:39:34] being you can have you could your mama
[1:39:38] and your daddy who know you and you love
[1:39:40] them for 50 years 60 years 30 years your
[1:39:43] wife people you know siblings and you've
[1:39:46] known them your whole life and a f
[1:39:49] minute
[1:39:51] conversation can cause you to
[1:39:53] question whether this person loves you
[1:39:56] or
[1:39:57] not in five minutes time just a few a
[1:40:02] few a day or so and our whole 40-year
[1:40:05] relationship is on the Rocks it's in
[1:40:08] question because you're dealing with a
[1:40:10] human being and I can sit there and look
[1:40:12] at your body but I don't know what
[1:40:14] you're thinking and I don't know which
[1:40:16] way you're moving this is why the whole
[1:40:20] man has to be healed and it's only the
[1:40:22] new birth Earth by the baptism of the
[1:40:25] Holy Ghost can heal this individual look
[1:40:29] I can't trust I can't trust me so sir
[1:40:33] how can I expect you to trust
[1:40:35] me you said brother isra am I supposed
[1:40:38] to read your mind you don't want to read
[1:40:39] my mind I don't want to read your mind
[1:40:43] either you don't want to read your own
[1:40:46] mind this is why we got to be born again
[1:40:50] so that the mind of Christ will over and
[1:40:54] supersede my mind that's right so the
[1:40:59] problem always is the individual looking
[1:41:02] in the mirror okay you're in a room and
[1:41:06] the room has Mirrors all the way around
[1:41:08] you look up it's you you look it's you
[1:41:11] look over there and that is the problem
[1:41:13] you look down it's you it's you are the
[1:41:17] one and the complexity of a human being
[1:41:20] is so tremendous it's very we're very
[1:41:23] interesting but we can you know motive
[1:41:26] and intentions and where we're going
[1:41:28] what we're doing friend today and the
[1:41:32] next thing we in
[1:41:33] court yeah at the altar getting married
[1:41:38] today and then at the courthouse getting
[1:41:41] a divorce a brutal one yes very terrible
[1:41:43] one so much so the heart can be in love
[1:41:48] with someone and I'll live with you for
[1:41:50] the rest of my life and then a few few
[1:41:53] years later somebody murdered someone
[1:41:57] yes because a human being is just
[1:41:59] complex like that and the only way that
[1:42:02] you can handle them and deal with them
[1:42:05] you have to use the
[1:42:08] manual that tells you how to handle
[1:42:10] another man outside of this it don't
[1:42:13] make sense it will never make outside of
[1:42:16] this you won't make sense none of your
[1:42:19] friends will make sense all of the
[1:42:21] people around you will never make s but
[1:42:23] this manual here will tell you how to
[1:42:26] handle a man if my computer blows up I
[1:42:29] can s that to The Geek
[1:42:31] Squad my house you know electrical I
[1:42:34] call an electrician Plumbing a plumber
[1:42:37] who do I call to fix me all
[1:42:42] right he's
[1:42:44] difficult he's a creature that that that
[1:42:47] that can be the most trustworthy thing
[1:42:50] in the world and the least trustworthy
[1:42:53] thing in the world is a human being and
[1:42:57] in it's in this
[1:42:59] complexity that we have to handle one
[1:43:02] another through the instructions of
[1:43:05] God's word so
[1:43:09] this three
[1:43:11] points of of of what gossip
[1:43:16] does how brother ram calls it
[1:43:20] acid and how he speaks weeks of saying
[1:43:24] good things about one another and so he
[1:43:27] deals with this in uh Christ is the
[1:43:30] mystery of God
[1:43:32] revealed on what we call a word to the
[1:43:35] church many churches has it on their
[1:43:37] bulletin board and we have read it for
[1:43:40] you many times and we'll read it part of
[1:43:44] it again here this morning a word to the
[1:43:48] church paragraph 80 brother brandom says
[1:43:50] love one another above everything so he
[1:43:53] speaking to the Believers in his church
[1:43:56] love one another no matter what the
[1:43:58] devil tries to say now you're all one
[1:44:01] great big sweet group now but remember
[1:44:04] my warning see Satan won't let that stay
[1:44:09] that way and it gives us how Satan will
[1:44:13] send someone and he'll shoot that person
[1:44:15] they they'll start something and then it
[1:44:19] that that thing that you hear wants you
[1:44:21] to take sides to it now you are
[1:44:25] responsible how you handle gossip that
[1:44:28] that responsibility is on you I'm going
[1:44:30] to let the prophet put that
[1:44:31] responsibility on you this is the reason
[1:44:35] and I have some quotes for you why some
[1:44:37] of our problems in trouble starts within
[1:44:41] us is because we're listening to
[1:44:43] something that we shouldn't be listening
[1:44:45] now you might not have been the one who
[1:44:47] said it but you listen to it and when
[1:44:50] you listen to it it now begins to to
[1:44:53] affect
[1:44:54] you now the prophet takes this in
[1:44:59] paragraph 82 says do you remember that
[1:45:02] the enemy will come when he does just
[1:45:06] cling that much closer together the one
[1:45:09] that the devil is using for an enemy
[1:45:11] will either get out or come in and be
[1:45:15] one of you that's all don't never Clan
[1:45:18] among or talk or make yourself clannish
[1:45:22] we are one look at your neighbor and
[1:45:24] tell them now we are one you're my
[1:45:28] brothers good to see you bagots God
[1:45:30] bless you young men all right we are one
[1:45:34] I couldn't say left him I'm mad at you
[1:45:37] I'm going to take you away cuz you're
[1:45:39] not right hand he's my left hand I want
[1:45:42] him to stay there even the little tip of
[1:45:44] my finger I wanted to stay right there
[1:45:46] every little part of my body stay right
[1:45:48] there and God wants us as a body of
[1:45:51] Believers to stay right exactly with one
[1:45:55] another right at with one another now
[1:46:00] you got tapes on that got tapes on what
[1:46:02] we believe you got tapes on discipline
[1:46:06] in the church let's drop down to
[1:46:08] paragraph 86 if the brother you think is
[1:46:11] a little wrong or the sister say
[1:46:14] Lord don't let me never have the root of
[1:46:18] bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect
[1:46:21] him it'll take the Christ right out of
[1:46:24] my life that poison aets of malice
[1:46:30] jealousy and hatred what does malice
[1:46:33] mean malice is intention to do evil it's
[1:46:37] ill will jealousy it's feeling or
[1:46:41] showing Envy of someone of their
[1:46:44] achievements feelings or suspicious of
[1:46:47] someone's unfaithfulness jealousy and
[1:46:50] then hatred is an intense dislike or ill
[1:46:55] will now don't raise your hand but how
[1:46:57] many of you got somebody you don't
[1:47:00] like how many human beings in here you
[1:47:03] know what we what we do what we do is
[1:47:06] like this group of human beings don't
[1:47:08] have the problems that that group of
[1:47:11] human beings have and what I want you to
[1:47:13] do is just stop talking because you
[1:47:15] don't know what you're talking about
[1:47:16] well when you're in the message uh we
[1:47:19] would never have the that I can't
[1:47:21] believe that could ever happen in the
[1:47:22] message if you're dealing with human
[1:47:24] beings you're going to have any problem
[1:47:27] that ever happened to any human being
[1:47:29] that's capable of happening doesn't
[1:47:31] matter which group you're part of what
[1:47:33] which what what what what what city what
[1:47:35] country they're how they you rich or
[1:47:38] poor the human being is a complex
[1:47:43] creature but he was made in the image of
[1:47:46] God and in the fall it messed him up and
[1:47:49] so he's partly carnal he's partly spir
[1:47:52] spiritual and we're trying to get back
[1:47:54] to the spiritual man as a son of Adam
[1:47:58] that's what we're trying to get back to
[1:48:00] but it's a progress It's it's a it's a
[1:48:03] it's a it's a it's a it's a road that
[1:48:05] we're on in our life to get to that
[1:48:08] place where we don't have any of those
[1:48:11] issues in our life amen and so is it's
[1:48:16] bitterness you don't want that to spring
[1:48:18] up jealousy hatred it would take the
[1:48:22] holy SP spirit away from you when you
[1:48:24] think about somebody you don't like and
[1:48:27] sometimes we'll say that you know I
[1:48:28] really don't like him I really don't
[1:48:29] like her well what is hatred hatred is
[1:48:32] an
[1:48:33] intense so it's you not liking them but
[1:48:36] it's
[1:48:37] intensified it's got to start
[1:48:39] somewhere it starts off you don't like
[1:48:42] him I don't favor him I don't favor her
[1:48:44] and then it intensifies and it turns
[1:48:46] into hatred and tell me you're going in
[1:48:49] the Rapture with hatred in your heart it
[1:48:52] ain't going to happen happen but it
[1:48:53] sounds more convenient that I don't like
[1:48:56] this I don't like the way he Le I don't
[1:48:58] like the way he I don't like the way she
[1:49:00] I don't like I don't like and then when
[1:49:01] that intensifies your dislike becomes
[1:49:07] hatred and if you hate your
[1:49:11] brother that's murder that's murder
[1:49:16] Saints on can I go a little bit further
[1:49:18] here you know motive and objective is so
[1:49:24] deep motive can determine the difference
[1:49:28] between a first-degree
[1:49:30] murder and a second deegree
[1:49:33] murder because the human being he's made
[1:49:35] up that way like if if it's a crime of
[1:49:39] passion if he loses his mind because of
[1:49:42] something very bad happened the the
[1:49:44] court system will look at that and says
[1:49:45] you know what he had a he had a valid
[1:49:48] motive he did wrong but it but it was
[1:49:50] valid but when but when the motive was
[1:49:53] from the beginning to commit the crime
[1:49:56] that's a different crime so your motive
[1:49:59] in everything that you do means
[1:50:03] everything you just don't give like that
[1:50:06] you give with the motive behind it and
[1:50:09] this is the complexity of the human
[1:50:12] being and this is the part where you are
[1:50:17] challenged to guard your ears from
[1:50:20] hearing the gossip
[1:50:23] that is the responsibility of the
[1:50:25] believer 100% 100% sure you will hear it

[1:51:38] of God says here in a couple of these
[1:51:42] messages
[1:51:44] yes he
[1:51:49] says in this message here
[1:51:58] why are people so tossed
[1:52:00] about paragraph
[1:52:04] 105 people go to church and they'll
[1:52:06] shake your hand in church laugh and call
[1:52:09] your brother outside the church they
[1:52:12] pull a little business deal that
[1:52:13] wouldn't be just exactly straight for
[1:52:16] personal game I don't say them people
[1:52:18] are here in the Tabernacle but I say
[1:52:21] there is there is things that people
[1:52:24] would do and they get different a a
[1:52:28] least little thing will bring that old
[1:52:30] temper back again that
[1:52:33] selfishness open up an ear to hear
[1:52:36] gossip or do something of that type that
[1:52:39] person has never entered into this pot
[1:52:42] in here there outside brother random
[1:52:46] continues the church and its condition
[1:52:50] 1956 paragraph 96 he says but you see
[1:52:54] the reason he couldn't abide you was a
[1:52:57] lamb then but when you become a wolf he
[1:52:59] had to take the flight nothing wrong
[1:53:02] with with the dove it's
[1:53:06] you you let that Spirit come to you did
[1:53:11] I let it brother brandom yes when you
[1:53:15] went to listening to that
[1:53:18] gossip when you listen to that lie when
[1:53:21] you went to is saying well I've got a
[1:53:24] right to and brother bam go goes on so
[1:53:27] listening to the gossip there is a
[1:53:29] responsibility for you to close your
[1:53:31] ears to it you got to move the
[1:53:33] conversation you got to redirect
[1:53:37] it it's it I mean you got to change the
[1:53:40] subject it's a skill set you have to
[1:53:43] develop as a Believer because your ears
[1:53:47] can't unhear the foolishness so if you
[1:53:50] can stop from hearing it in the
[1:53:52] beginning thank the Lord but Lord help
[1:53:55] me to guide my ears but I can't make
[1:53:59] people close their mouth but I can
[1:54:01] change the conversation or get out of
[1:54:03] there all right yes we will how many's
[1:54:06] heard something that you shouldn't have
[1:54:07] heard amen you hear people you know
[1:54:09] upset and they're talking about this
[1:54:11] brother talking about this sister
[1:54:14] talking about this church or that group
[1:54:16] and it's gossip it has no value to you
[1:54:21] it actually is going to stir you up
[1:54:23] it'll take Christ out of your life it is
[1:54:26] actually a wound against you that's why
[1:54:30] you got to go out of the presence of a
[1:54:32] tail Bearer because it's going to affect
[1:54:36] you you say I was just I didn't say
[1:54:38] nothing I just listen to them say it if
[1:54:40] you're listening to them say it and it's
[1:54:42] not right then get out of
[1:54:46] it how many can say Amen to that
[1:54:54] praise the Lord
[1:54:58] amen so you go to listening to
[1:55:01] that so how do you deal with
[1:55:05] it you got to lay that
[1:55:08] aside you know this is a uh it's the way
[1:55:13] for some people they just love talking
[1:55:17] other folks
[1:55:19] business it lifts them up maybe
[1:55:22] especially if it's you know something
[1:55:25] derogatory you know it's like it lifts
[1:55:28] it lifts them up it's a you it creates a
[1:55:31] focus on something that's not healthy
[1:55:34] it's not wholesome and and the
[1:55:36] scriptures
[1:55:38] actually really qualifies this busy body
[1:55:41] or this tail Bearer in 1 Peter chapter 4
[1:55:45] and I want you to turn there with me in
[1:55:47] verse 15
[1:55:53] now we might not dance today all
[1:55:56] right but we can sure say Amen to the
[1:56:02] word we're in such a time as that where
[1:56:05] it's easy to gossip easy I can talk
[1:56:08] about you and I probably
[1:56:13] have I'm looking at you just like you're
[1:56:15] looking at me but I'm looking at you
[1:56:17] when you don't know I'm looking at you
[1:56:19] too and I'm talking about you behind
[1:56:22] your back you say brother is if I could
[1:56:26] just be a fly on the wall and hear what
[1:56:29] they're
[1:56:30] saying you're a fly what if you heard it
[1:56:34] what you going to do with
[1:56:35] it that's probably why flies are crazy
[1:56:38] because of the things they do
[1:56:40] hear just run into a wall yeah because
[1:56:44] if you can hear what a fly
[1:56:46] heard you're running to a wall too you
[1:56:50] quit too
[1:56:54] do you really want to hear what they're
[1:56:56] saying about
[1:56:58] you really you know if if the approach
[1:57:02] is to
[1:57:04] edify I want that I actually don't want
[1:57:07] it I need that to edify if it's just
[1:57:12] garbage trash I don't need to hear it
[1:57:14] about me I don't need to hear it about
[1:57:16] brother I don't need to hear about
[1:57:18] sister I don't even need to hear it
[1:57:20] about my enemy
[1:57:23] has no
[1:57:24] value all right let's take the scripture
[1:57:26] here 1 Peter 4:15 but let none of you
[1:57:29] suffer as a
[1:57:31] what say it out loud help me Saints but
[1:57:34] let none of you suffer as a or a or
[1:57:40] a bunch of bad people there there's a
[1:57:43] bunch of bad people
[1:57:44] there or as
[1:57:48] a
[1:57:49] oo in other men's matters puts them all
[1:57:55] in the same group doesn't it murderer
[1:57:58] thief
[1:57:59] evildoer and he throws like I I was just
[1:58:03] saying I was just saying what everybody
[1:58:05] else was thinking I was just keeping it
[1:58:07] real you you're not keeping it real
[1:58:10] you're keeping the fire burning you're
[1:58:13] keeping the fighting to happen you're
[1:58:16] not stopping the fight you're continuing
[1:58:19] it to go
[1:58:20] on and the scriptures warns us against
[1:58:24] it amen amen amen now let's take this
[1:58:30] young man Absalon just for a moment he's
[1:58:33] found in 2 Samuel chapter
[1:58:36] 15 you know the history of
[1:58:38] Absalon a very complicated relationship
[1:58:42] there in Psalms 27 it
[1:58:46] says though my mother and my father
[1:58:48] forsake me when my mother and my father
[1:58:51] forsake me then the Lord will take me up
[1:58:54] teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead me
[1:58:57] into a plain
[1:58:58] path why does the psalmist showing us
[1:59:03] that it is possible that mother and
[1:59:05] father can forsake you the people that
[1:59:08] love you the people that should be one
[1:59:11] with you they can't forsake you because
[1:59:14] this is the com
[1:59:16] complicatedness if that's a word of
[1:59:18] dealing with a human
[1:59:20] being they can turn on you it could be
[1:59:24] mother it could be father and these
[1:59:28] dynamics of love hate and all of those
[1:59:32] things that go into that three the
[1:59:34] Triune being of a man it it it it's a
[1:59:38] real deal and it's something that you
[1:59:40] know only a life of prayer can deliver
[1:59:44] you from
[1:59:45] that and um this in in 2
[1:59:50] Samuel chapter
[1:59:52] what did I call 2 Samuel chapter 15 the
[1:59:56] scripture deals
[2:00:00] with this Absalon before we get there we
[2:00:03] get a little background on him remember
[2:00:05] he had a sister
[2:00:07] Tamar and a a a brother kind of like a
[2:00:11] step brother um by the name of what's
[2:00:15] his name
[2:00:16] Ammon and Ammon had forced his sister
[2:00:21] and created this great conflict in
[2:00:25] Absalon so Absalon took his sister Tamar
[2:00:29] in and she uh deal dwelt there with her
[2:00:33] shame and all of the stuff that took
[2:00:35] took place with
[2:00:37] Ammon and he held that in his heart for
[2:00:40] two
[2:00:42] years and the hurt and the pain or
[2:00:45] whatever it was the Vengeance rested in
[2:00:49] him for two whole years yes and it looks
[2:00:52] like we're okay it looks like the fire
[2:00:56] is out but when you're dealing with a
[2:00:58] human being the fire might not be
[2:01:00] out you think it's okay you think
[2:01:04] everything bygones be bygones but not
[2:01:07] when you're dealing with the human being
[2:01:09] and
[2:01:10] unforgiveness and holding grudges is
[2:01:14] like like I heard one preacher say it's
[2:01:16] like you drinking poison and expecting
[2:01:20] your enemy to die that's what what
[2:01:22] unforgiveness is like the sin of
[2:01:24] unforgiveness like you you're holding it
[2:01:28] in and that's the thing that's going to
[2:01:30] really release you and free you is when
[2:01:33] you can forgive
[2:01:35] somebody and you know he held this in
[2:01:38] for two years it's complicated he he you
[2:01:42] know he has this you know you know this
[2:01:46] uh position issue that he wanted to very
[2:01:48] handsome man beautiful and he holds this
[2:01:52] in for vengeance for his sister calls
[2:01:54] for the king's Sons to come they come
[2:01:58] ammon's heart is Merry he drinks wine
[2:02:00] and Absalon murders him he takes off
[2:02:04] into another city gersher for two years
[2:02:08] he was gone there or for three years he
[2:02:10] laid away in another city another town
[2:02:14] because he murdered the King's son but
[2:02:16] the David the king loved him it's like
[2:02:20] David why would you love him when he
[2:02:22] hates you well I'm a human being that's
[2:02:25] my
[2:02:26] problem that's the
[2:02:28] problem I'm dealing with a human being
[2:02:32] I'm dealing with
[2:02:34] emotions I'm dealing with complex issues
[2:02:38] he's a complex being the human being is
[2:02:42] it it doesn't make sense all the time
[2:02:44] David why don't you just get rid of this
[2:02:47] boy it's clear he disrespects you it's
[2:02:50] clear he trying to get you but David
[2:02:53] loved him yeah
[2:02:57] y can I preach a little
[2:03:00] bit we see these Dynamics all the time
[2:03:02] don't we and this is in the scripture
[2:03:06] and so David loves him joab his servant
[2:03:10] his lead man goes and gets him brings
[2:03:13] him back into uh Israel and he kind of
[2:03:18] apologizes verse 15
[2:03:22] is where Absalon begins to really show
[2:03:25] himself verse one and it came to pass
[2:03:28] after this that Absalon prepared him
[2:03:30] chariots and horses 50 men to run before
[2:03:34] him and Absalon rose up early and Stood
[2:03:37] Beside the way of the gate and it was so
[2:03:40] that when any man that had a controversy
[2:03:43] came to the king for judgment then
[2:03:47] Absalon called The King and told him hey
[2:03:49] King you need to watch out for this is
[2:03:51] that what he did
[2:03:52] is that what he did where the Sunday
[2:03:55] school at where the people at you got
[2:03:58] y'all can't help me preach here this
[2:03:59] morning is that what Absalon y'all never
[2:04:02] heard this story
[2:04:03] before did Absalon open his heart to the
[2:04:06] king and tell him you know was really
[2:04:07] going on the people say no no no no no
[2:04:10] he used it to his Advantage didn't he
[2:04:13] controversy came to the king for
[2:04:14] judgment then Absalon called unto him
[2:04:17] and said of what City Art Thou and he
[2:04:19] said thy servant is one of the Trib
[2:04:21] tries of Israel and Absalon said unto
[2:04:24] him see thy matters are good and right
[2:04:28] but there is no man deputed of the king
[2:04:30] to hear thee absolon said moreover oh
[2:04:34] that I were made judge in the land that
[2:04:37] every man which had the suit or cause
[2:04:41] might come unto me and I would do him
[2:04:46] Justice and it was so that when any man
[2:04:49] came nigh to him to do him obedience he
[2:04:51] put forth his hand took him kissed him
[2:04:55] and on this manner did Absalon to all
[2:04:58] Israel that came to the king for
[2:05:00] judgment so absolon stole the hearts of
[2:05:03] the men of Israel interesting
[2:05:08] huh you
[2:05:10] know this
[2:05:14] this if I was in charge or if I was
[2:05:17] married to him or if that was my wife or
[2:05:21] if that was my kids they ain't your kids
[2:05:25] you ain't in charge you're not the
[2:05:28] manager uh you know it's always you know
[2:05:31] the The Grass Is Always Greener until
[2:05:34] until you're on the other
[2:05:36] side you know
[2:05:38] this this issue is a problem that
[2:05:42] Harbors itself in the heart of human
[2:05:46] beings and it's got to be dealt
[2:05:50] with and you want the the Lord to really
[2:05:52] cleanse it out of you is that right
[2:05:55] Saints you know this um there's a little
[2:05:59] you know little um you know this this
[2:06:03] really this story really shows how you
[2:06:06] know this is the
[2:06:08] king is your daddy Absalon that's your
[2:06:12] pops he actually loves
[2:06:16] you but it wasn't enough for him was it
[2:06:19] can we take one more scripture here to
[2:06:21] look into this gentleman just for a
[2:06:24] moment 2 Samuel
[2:06:26] 14:25 but in all of Israel there was
[2:06:30] none to be so much praised as absolon
[2:06:35] for his Beauty from the soulle of his
[2:06:38] feet even to the crown of his head there
[2:06:41] was no blemish in him and when he pulled
[2:06:45] his head for it was every year pulled it
[2:06:47] because the hair was heavy on him there
[2:06:49] he pull he weighed the hair of his head
[2:06:51] to 100 shekels after the king's weight
[2:06:54] and unto abelin there were born three
[2:06:56] sons and so he's a fine fellow handsome
[2:07:01] guy he's the King's son and actually the
[2:07:05] king loves him but Absalon has issues in
[2:07:09] his own
[2:07:11] heart and it really is that he is the
[2:07:17] problem I remember hearing this kind of
[2:07:20] a humor this this uh I guess these
[2:07:23] missionaries went to a remoter Island
[2:07:26] and they find this guy on the island all
[2:07:28] by
[2:07:29] himself and they go up to him and they
[2:07:32] notice behind him there's two buildings
[2:07:34] and they look like two
[2:07:35] churches they said there's only where's
[2:07:38] all the people he said well I'm the only
[2:07:39] one on this island only one ever been
[2:07:42] here I said what's that church over
[2:07:44] there he said oh that's the church I go
[2:07:46] to now that's my home
[2:07:48] Church what's that other church he said
[2:07:50] that's the church I used to go to
[2:07:53] so he split from
[2:07:55] himself y'all didn't get that let me is
[2:07:58] it cold
[2:08:00] outside it was only two churches to go
[2:08:02] to he's the only member and he split one
[2:08:05] of the churches but it's their
[2:08:10] fault and this really speaks to the
[2:08:13] problem that dwells within us when we
[2:08:16] can see that it's in us because we can't
[2:08:20] stop the Tattler and the whisperers but
[2:08:24] we can
[2:08:25] handle um how we react when we are
[2:08:28] talked about and who we allow to talk
[2:08:32] garbage to us do you imagine somebody
[2:08:35] bringing old rotten food and bringing it
[2:08:39] into your home and setting it in the
[2:08:41] living room you're like no you need to
[2:08:43] get that out of here take it out you
[2:08:45] move it out and that's that's what
[2:08:47] that's what gossip is like all right so
[2:08:50] here the prophet so but how do we deal
[2:08:52] with it Saints how do we deal with this
[2:08:55] we deal with
[2:08:57] this in the message enticing Spirits I
[2:09:00] like how the prophet of God says this
[2:09:03] wherefore seeing we are composed about
[2:09:06] with such a great cloud of witnesses let
[2:09:08] us lay aside every weight and the sin
[2:09:12] that so easily beset us that we might
[2:09:16] that we might run with patience the race
[2:09:17] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[2:09:20] the author and the finisher of our faith
[2:09:23] who for the joy that was set before him
[2:09:25] endureed the cross despised the shame
[2:09:28] and sat down at the right hand of the
[2:09:31] Throne of God Jesus in his prayer said
[2:09:35] father I sanctify myself Jesus becom
[2:09:39] Sanctified to the church he could have
[2:09:41] gotten married but he didn't do it he
[2:09:44] become Sanctified he said sanctify them
[2:09:47] Father through the truth Thy word is the
[2:09:50] truth now let us lay aside every weight
[2:09:54] you got a temper you got something about
[2:09:56] you makes you talk when you ought not to
[2:09:59] talk oh God lay it there now let it let

[2:10:28] morning and the fire of God will come

[2:11:56] the Altar and got the coals of fire and
[2:11:59] laid it on his lips and sanctify him God
[2:12:03] sanctify every talker this morning that
[2:12:07] talks wrong and SS
[2:12:11] Discord granted Lord now that's a prayer
[2:12:15] that's a real prayer and it has to come
[2:12:19] not from the prophet it has to come not
[2:12:20] from a pastor but down in your soul that
[2:12:23] cry has to come out Lord sanctify my
[2:12:28] tongue that I would only talk the good
[2:12:30] things of
[2:12:32] God
[2:12:33] Amen Lord help us we lay it on the altar
[2:12:37] don't we that might just be the next
[2:12:41] level for your
[2:12:42] ministry for your parenting for the gift
[2:12:46] of God that might be the next thing that
[2:12:49] you need to do is ask the Lord to
[2:12:52] sanctify your tongue the thing that we
[2:12:56] say about other people the things that
[2:12:59] we say in
[2:13:00] idleness the talking the cheap talk that
[2:13:05] has no value to it Lord help
[2:13:07] us God help us sir this was the next
[2:13:12] step for Abraham he had to do something
[2:13:16] as I prepare to close he had to do
[2:13:18] something when the Lord had called him
[2:13:21] changed his name and then Sac you know
[2:13:24] the circumcision and all the obedience
[2:13:27] that Abraham did look at what the
[2:13:29] prophet says in proving his word
[2:13:32] 1965 now look at the hindrance that
[2:13:35] Abraham had first thing was his age 75
[2:13:39] years old Sarah being 65 she was way
[2:13:42] past the change of life the menopause no
[2:13:45] doubt but what it stopped many years
[2:13:48] before he had lived with her as wife it
[2:13:51] was his half sister had probably taken
[2:13:54] her when she was just a girl in her
[2:13:55] teens and had married her and he had had
[2:13:58] no children she was absolutely Barren
[2:14:01] and now we find that to do this he had
[2:14:04] to separate himself from all the peoples
[2:14:08] who did not believe it in order to make
[2:14:12] it come to
[2:14:15] pass I don't mean to say you have to
[2:14:18] separate yourself from peoples but you
[2:14:20] have to separate yourself from All the
[2:14:24] gossip of
[2:14:25] unbelief and stay away from that when
[2:14:28] people says all those things don't
[2:14:30] happen that's a bunch of lunatic people
[2:14:32] there's no such a thing as that
[2:14:34] happening just close up your ears and
[2:14:38] walk
[2:14:39] away don't pay any attention to it how
[2:14:44] many can say Lord help me to close my
[2:14:47] ears don't you wish you had some
[2:14:50] invisible ear
[2:14:51] plugs huh
[2:14:56] that's now some of you Brothers might
[2:14:57] get in trouble with
[2:15:00] them cuz sis is talking something very
[2:15:03] very very very important to
[2:15:05] you and she repeats it and she repeats
[2:15:09] it are you listening to me yeah yeah I'm
[2:15:12] listening I'm listening what did I
[2:15:15] [Laughter]
[2:15:17] say but if I can have some invisible ear
[2:15:21] plugs that when the nonsense starts I
[2:15:23] just plug them right
[2:15:27] in but we don't have those yet do
[2:15:31] we look at your neighbor and say
[2:15:35] neighbor neighbor look at him good now
[2:15:38] say
[2:15:39] neighbor I love
[2:15:41] you I thank God for
[2:15:44] you I only want the best for
[2:15:48] you now don't that feel good to hear
[2:15:50] somebody tell you words like
[2:15:53] that now gossip if you tell it to the
[2:15:57] person you're talking about to their
[2:15:59] face is not gossip you're just probably
[2:16:01] keeping it
[2:16:02] real but when you tell those words of
[2:16:05] malice Envy hatred behind the back of
[2:16:09] someone that would qualify of gossip and
[2:16:13] and if you don't like someone let's put
[2:16:17] that in the category of where does
[2:16:19] hatred come from
[2:16:22] not liking intensified is hatred and if
[2:16:26] you hate them then you are not in line
[2:16:30] with the word of God you can't say you
[2:16:31] love
[2:16:33] God you can't say you love God him that
[2:16:36] you can't see but I would I would even
[2:16:39] add that you can see him because you see
[2:16:40] him right in the word he tells you what
[2:16:43] you're supposed to be
[2:16:45] doing it tells you how to handle your
[2:16:47] brother your sister
[2:16:51] it's a slippery it's a slippery you know
[2:16:54] channel to get into those conversation
[2:16:56] you know sometimes we'll we'll we'll
[2:16:58] slap a bow on our gossip with so that we
[2:17:02] can be praying for
[2:17:05] them you done ran them down open up
[2:17:09] personal details of their life put it on
[2:17:12] the screen out to other ears that don't
[2:17:15] need to hear it and then parents gossip
[2:17:17] in front of their children damaging
[2:17:23] damaging open up with gossip in front of
[2:17:25] their children slander say all that you
[2:17:28] want to say and then try to wrap it all
[2:17:30] up I'm just only saying that so you can
[2:17:32] be praying for
[2:17:34] him well did you pray for him first if
[2:17:38] you didn't start it with prayer don't
[2:17:40] try to wrap it up with let's so that we
[2:17:42] can be praying for why don't you pray
[2:17:43] for him first then you probably won't
[2:17:45] even gossip
[2:17:53] you know as a pastor or Minister you go
[2:17:56] to different
[2:17:58] areas in in your travels so you get
[2:18:02] details about people you don't always
[2:18:04] want to hear but people want to share
[2:18:05] stuff with you and I remember very
[2:18:07] clearly I was out out of the country and
[2:18:12] doing some meetings actually with
[2:18:13] brother Wesco and this couple came to me
[2:18:16] and wanted to share with me some things
[2:18:19] that they were going through
[2:18:21] and they started getting deep into their
[2:18:23] Grievances and troubles and problems in
[2:18:26] the church and with that family and the
[2:18:28] troubles within themselves and I simply
[2:18:30] asked him have you talked with your
[2:18:33] pastor about
[2:18:35] this yeah he wouldn't understand no no
[2:18:39] no no we're g to stop this right
[2:18:41] now and it's a temptation to want to
[2:18:44] hear the
[2:18:46] goodies the information of what's going
[2:18:49] on in somebody else's church but when
[2:18:52] you listen to that it's cheap it has no
[2:18:56] value to it and the Holy Spirit is not
[2:19:04] pleased you got to put that in check it
[2:19:07] takes a discipline to do
[2:19:09] that you have to you have to have a set
[2:19:11] of rules in your spirit to deal with
[2:19:14] that hey little a sister want to come
[2:19:18] hey brother I need to tell you something
[2:19:20] but my husband oh oh wait oh no no no
[2:19:23] there's a right there's a right way to
[2:19:24] do this we're not going to we're not
[2:19:27] going to sit up and hear you talking bad
[2:19:29] about your
[2:19:30] husband like that no this there's a
[2:19:32] right way to do this there's a
[2:19:35] discipline we got to follow cuz words
[2:19:38] have
[2:19:40] spirits and some of the B biggest
[2:19:44] gossipers can I say it brother George
[2:19:46] some of the biggest gossipers are
[2:19:49] preachers that's
[2:19:51] they know they know they
[2:19:53] know y'all want me to close come on I'm
[2:19:57] going to

[2:21:06] gossip about
[2:21:08] anybody please put that Banner over my
[2:21:12] head don't come to me with gossip cuz
[2:21:16] there's other motives behind it but if
[2:21:19] you have a concern or prayer or
[2:21:22] something that's edifying we all need
[2:21:25] that is that right Saints God bless you
[2:21:28] so much God bless you
[2:21:30] richly
[2:21:33] we did I finish Absalon no I
[2:21:37] didn't you can finish Absalon in 2
[2:21:41] Samuel chapter 15 and he deals and he
[2:21:45] calls this a great
[2:21:48] conspiracy because he weaved his way in
[2:21:51] there and he got people that would hear
[2:21:54] it and listen I don't want to be a part
[2:21:56] of that I really don't I've gossa before
[2:21:59] and I ask the Lord to help me I'm a
[2:22:01] talker I like to talk but I just don't
[2:22:04] want that on me so I want to lay that
[2:22:07] thing on the altar this morning and ask
[2:22:09] the Holy Spirit to let the
[2:22:12] fire sanctify my tongue this morning God
[2:22:16] bless you so much let's go to the Lord
[2:22:18] in prayer Heavenly Father father ask
[2:22:22] your blessings upon your people today
[2:22:25] these simple words and the Saints there
[2:22:27] in Phoenix Lord Jesus just simple words
[2:22:31] of what we already know but it's a
[2:22:34] warning to us to talk nice about one
[2:22:37] another and that what is our motive in
[2:22:40] talking about it what's the motive
[2:22:43] behind the conversation what's the
[2:22:46] objective sometimes we have to say
[2:22:49] things that are uncomfortable
[2:22:52] inconvenient in order to get to to the
[2:22:55] solution but what's the motive Lord and
[2:22:59] if it's just frivolous talk Talking
[2:23:02] other people's matters have mercy upon
[2:23:05] us I pray that that the Holy Ghost would
[2:23:09] come in our midst Lord and
[2:23:11] not hinder the move in this little

[2:28:42] pressure very much so year or more on
[2:28:47] where we going to find a place or
[2:28:48] building and I was preaching in West
[2:28:51] Palm Beach for that choir uh that the
[2:28:55] kids go to the children go
[2:28:57] to and I uh had mentioned to the Saints
[2:29:02] there that if the Lord made the
[2:29:05] command to gather in his name then he
[2:29:08] would have to provide the place where
[2:29:11] that should
[2:29:12] be and brother Isaiah Brooks he jumped
[2:29:15] up he said that's for me and brother
[2:29:17] Jack Duff jumped up he said that's for
[2:29:19] me there looking for assemblies too so I
[2:29:22] called brother Jack and I told him what
[2:29:23] the good Lord had done for us he says
[2:29:26] I'm so happy brother Israel we're next I
[2:29:30] said amen you're next you claim that

[2:43:24] screaming in pain and crying and it was
[2:43:27] horrible but um you
[2:43:31] know Christ said that he is the high
[2:43:34] priest of our
[2:43:35] confession and brother brandom's talked
[2:43:37] about our body will have to force itself
[2:43:41] to match the confession that we give and

[2:43:48] better than thank you Lord for healing
[2:43:50] me and today I can you know squat and
