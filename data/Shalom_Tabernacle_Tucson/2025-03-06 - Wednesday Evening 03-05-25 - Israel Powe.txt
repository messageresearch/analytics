word in this hour Lord and we thank you oh God that we can recognize that it's you speaking to us through your word and help us Lord to line up with the vision oh God to get back in line where we need to get back in line is our prayer it's in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we ask these blessings amen amen God bless each of you we welcome you to the house of the Lord each of you our visitors our friends amen and all the saints amen let's go right into the scriptures and I'm just going to take maybe 30 minutes or so if the Lord will help me and just touch a little bit on this portion of this subject of marriage and divorce um I got a few books from the Tucson Tabernacle there's two more that I have there and we can order more I really feel like it's um it' be good for you to get a copy of that your own copy and go through it one more time I'll say this if you haven't read it or heard it in the last six months to a year then I believe every brother every sister every single person every individual needs to go back and hear that one more time because it was one of the great Mysteries that was underneath the seven seal that was revealed to us today and when you hear it you'll see how important it was for God to bring it to us in our city here is where the Vindication of it came down right out here in the mountain here the pillar of fire striking down and bringing to us this great message on marriage and divorce but the prophet takes the scripture in Matthew chapter 19 I believe we'll read that before we have you seated amen and verse number three the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him saying unto him to him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are not no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together together let not man put aunder they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away and he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and who so Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery amen let's take one more scripture and Matthew chapter 5 verse 31 it has been said whosoever should put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but I say unto you that whosoever should put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorc committeth adultery take one more in Mark chap 10 verses number four through 5 and they said verse four Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away and Jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept what therefore God hath joined together let no man put aunder and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter and he sath unto him whosoever should put away his wife and marry another committed adultery against her and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery and with those scriptures we'll ask God to bless us amen Lord Jesus bless us bless us with your word bless this portion of the service we pray ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated now in one of the questions here in Matthew chapter 19 if you um we might get back to it there again the disciples begin to go forward and ask Jesus in depth about marriage and divorce and brother Brandon brings to us that um because it of the original sin is the reason why uh Jesus was faced with this question in the beginning of his ministry Moses was faced with this question in the beginning of his ministry Paul had to deal with it he said for I say unto you not the Lord but I in giving permission and then here also brother brandham had to deal with it too and you know the the teaching on the marriage and divorce and living under that Covenant of marriage and divorce for us Believers there's probably not another denomination that sees it the way we do and it should be the Forefront of teaching from our little ones all the way up and I believe that um brother random tells us he gives a warning he said this is to my people only this is to my group only he made himself very clear to know that these are to my people only and he gives us um the um Doctrine or the understanding of what marriage and divorce is scripturally it goes back into history and shows how Jesus pointed out but from the beginning it wasn't so I never heard another teacher bring it that way so brother random deals with the beginning and then after the beginning and brings in why polygamy was legal even in the animal kingdom and um amongst the human race and uh brother bam tells us why from the beginning all the way through but as you take this message and as I begin to go into it even further and how brother vanam identifies the role of the woman which he called the byproduct very strong strong statements but I want you to focus your mind in on paragraph I think it's 168 in there those of you that take notes I want you to go and and read read the message for yourself I don't want this to be something that I'm preaching to you I want you to go get it for yourself as the prophet said and then you pray over it because um in paragraph 168 he says he speaking of immoral woman he said I'm not speaking to you sisters maybe I'll just read that for you here quickly and so many times um our sisters or women in general will get um maybe just a little bit you know it gets uncomfortable even some of the brothers you get you feel that little pressure um but he's dealing with the immoral woman okay and he's not talking to to our sisters remember of all of the elijas the five that came I believe brother random was the only one uh that had a family that was married I think maybe Elisha maybe had children think Elisha did but we don't know of Elijah and we don't think John the Baptist had any but here's brother brandham who has a wife who has daughters three daughters one in glory two that he raised daughter-in-law sisters in the church and so he know you know that his uh approach has to be he's bringing it from the word of God standpoint and when when you have been raised in Dysfunctional teaching or understanding for so long then when you finally hear the truth after the end of all the ages it sounds very very harsh it sounds harsh because of the dysfunction over years and years and years and years and so when the truth is brought out plainly and flatly it actually would you I mean it would make a woman off the streets just get up and walk out probably but it is the truth and somebody had to bring that truth and if you are a sister then you shouldn't take this personal that it's against you personally because he specific specifically says he's speaking of an immoral woman and how Satan used the immoral woman to Cas to to to to start the sin and all of the wickedness that we see today is because of an immoral woman that's in the natural but on the spiritual side he does it with the church as well and so um that point has to be highlighted because it seems like every time it's brought up even our our sisters because it just is like men against woman or it's a male dominant theology or is it us against them it's not that at all it's the truth of where everything started and where sin started from and then what that does is in that Vision like I said we played a part of that vision for you on Sunday night of the true church and the false church and if brother brandham saw a vision of what the false Church look like in the future then tell me why I would want to be associated with anything that the false church had was identified what was she she had cut frizzy hair tons of makeup sexily dressed dancing to rock and roll music so if there's a Temptation for a true bride member to have to Ward against or church it would be those four wouldn't you say if the false one looks like that in the future before we got here before any church in Tucson he saw this Vision 1962 of a true bride and then the false bride the false Church what she looked like in the sight of God so immorally dressed that it caused him to blush it was disgusting to him and in the sight of God this is what it looks like so for us moving forward wouldn't that be the warning to watch out for wouldn't that be the statement wouldn't that be the Forefront of what we would be preaching and teaching and warning okay so there's the teaching part of the message uh marriage and divorce just getting the scriptures on it now also apart from the teaching part of marriage and divorce what this message did for us under the seventh seal and the opening of the word and this great Pillar of Fire that came down in our city that was witnessed by others granted the prophet the not the not the freedom to preach marriage and divorce but to give forgiveness for those that were caught in the The Snare of this false teaching and false Doctrine marriage and divorce there's a reason why people would marry Remar divorce two times three times and brother brandham tells us why he said it's because of false teaching not waiting on the Lord and then he says misinterpret theology this is why you married the second time or third time first are not waiting on the Lord but let me bring out one small little point before we read a couple of things before we close let's turn to Matthew 19 here just briefly quickly so many things on our heart here Matthew chapter 19 in verse number six let's start with verse number so we read through nine let's take number 10 his disciples said unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife look what they say it is not good to marry I mean mean Jesus is now telling them about marriage and divorce and he that married her that had been married before he's living in adultery whosoever Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery his disciples said unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given for there are some Unix which were so born from their mother's womb there are some um um Unix which were made Unix of men and there be Unix which have made themselves Unix for the kingdom of Heaven's Sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it so we understand that the understanding or the opening the real Covenant of marriage and divorce course under this message everybody can't receive it and here Jesus now brings up the issue of a unic the three kinds one that's made himself for the word of God one that's made him unic by men one that is born a unic and let me ask the question to you if you had to live to be a unic for the word of God's sake I believe a True Believer would they could they have to be able to you might not think you can but if you have to you would if you had to stand alone for the word of God's sake you certainly would a True Believer would and here Jesus is opening this up this understanding to the disciples and he simply says everybody can't receive it so in my work space I meet different people my family different ones this is the foremost question marriage and divorce it's the um reason why many of the problems we have today um this is it's tied into why women want to be pretty it ties into why she wants attention she wants to be beautiful and pretty and then Satan gets in there it's all tied in there and so hearing this message two or three times this week this was the first time so I went into the store here the other day I think yesterday day before yesterday and this uh little woman served me some uh where where I was and she's all meded up and had attached and just dressed horribly and I just was listening to this message this is the first time that I really felt sorry for her as I left my heart broke just thinking of the Trap that Satan had the soul caught up in it it's not a judgment it's what it is and it's a soul that needs to be delivered this is the first time and I think if you read the message in the Bible and then it makes you cry then maybe you're reading it right if it gets to you like that then maybe you're hearing it the way God designed I don't think we read it and we come out and want to preach against folks and go tear people apart and go argue I think it really tears you up and humbles you to really get that down on your knees and pray for somebody that's caught in this trap so let the Lord speak to you on this like I said if you haven't heard it in the last six months to a year I would I'd say you go back and hear it there's so much in there so the part after the teaching of it after the scriptures associated with it you know he says in there he can but she can't there's no grounds for her at all he says there's a place in there where he he's talking about the dues and the don'ts how a minister can only marry a virgin a priest can only marry a virgin and how that uh King David though he was not a minister he could marry more than one because he was a king not a priest but a priest or Minister that was one of the things that brother Brandon brings out in there and gives us scriptures for it so all those things are in there and our young people need to know that amen and not just our young people all of us really all of us really need to know that because you know if if you are tempted to look at a woman that's immorally dressed then you'll know exactly who's tempting you if you're a man it will it will put you in notice that Satan is trying to catch you man he's trying to get you to to just take us half of a second to think a thought or to just dwell on it just a moment and when you you realize that it was Satan that chose this for the fall of all of humanity that got a Son of God Adam to Forfeit everything over this one little act then you'll know how to place these things a little bit better so it's not a message it really should open up to all of our hearts okay all right so that's my ADM admonishment to you is that the other thing is brother brandham at the end of this message tells us that it was under these seals that this had opened to him paragraph number 80 I'll just read that quickly and I and I really want to make that point clear because I think brother brandom I believe he made it clear in the message but if you're not catching the feeling of what he's saying you'll take it that you know here they go They're talking against the women again or the brothers preaching against the sisters why are you getting on that he's not talking against the sisters he's talking about an immoral moral woman and if you are being influenced by immoral woman you need to know where that's coming from man or woman this is not about the sisters need to be careful this is about the men more than anything you find out who's behind that pretty dress or pretty whatever it is you find out if you could pull back and see a dark demon there trying to catch your soul you'll stop looking at that you'll step back you say Lord help me amen now the prophet says this in paragraph number 80 we have two thoughts on this marriage and divorce and now that our Lord has opened the seven sealed mystery of his word to us in this last day now many of you this might be Greek to you but my church understands by what and you heard of the visions and what taken place and the question is a Bible question we are invited here to believe there must be a true answer to the whole hidden secret Secrets secret that's been hid since the foundation of the world and the Bible prophesies and says that in this day these secrets would be made known Revelations 10 and at the sounding of the seventh angel the leod deia messenger the mysteries of God would be made known and this is the last age which is Le oysa let's take it one more time in paragraph number 318 so as it is today Lord God at the end of the world as we are here here under the mercy of God knowing that soon we are to answer in his presence and that you have did so much Lord I am sure in the sight of these people they'll hang on to this like it come from you and to Bear record here today of many people sitting here that even saw that sign up in the mountain where the angels of the Lord came in the Whirlwind where it came in the seven angels where the revealing of the seven Mysteries was unfolded and that same angel in the same direction on the same mountain today that this was revealed so that really highlights this message for us Saints this is not I heard it before and leave it on the sh this is very comprehensive this is very like right now for us I'll make one next point before my final statement here is that in that vision of the bride and the one I think we heard brother brandom says that the um the few in the back not the first but in the last day the last part they got out of Step remember that in the vision he said he saw the bride first and then and he brings out how the this bride was from all nations of the world the differ different countries that they were from showing that the bride comes from all over and then he brings out that right at the end there there was a few that got out of step and he has to watch them he said they got out of Step looking at that worldly church this what he says it's in it's in there she was looking at that worldly church and so the Temptation is and I've said it here many times that our example for worship or teaching or theology doesn't come from the worldly Church the other church that doesn't mean they don't have great ideas that doesn't mean they they're not Believers or Christians but when it comes to setting a an example in the word of God it's got to come from this message amen so what happens is with vashy what she did could have influenced the rest of the women in the nation from the little girls up and so so the Temptation one woman influencing another woman One Church being influenced by another church when our influence should be from the word of God Amen and this is where most of the Styles come from women watch other women and this is this you know they have that what they call the catwalk or whatever it is that they're designing these clothes and they now they have men doing it too but not that I've watched them but I've seen a little bit um and they're showcasing the latest and the greatest and these people go and you watch that and you sisters don't tell me that it don't C kind of catch you Brothers you see something sharp see something nice it's going to catch your eye too I mean your shoes whatever you're wearing is great now but you get you got to get the new version or the new style you just got to be careful with that because this is what the false church had for them they had the entire world looking at at them and that is not our example our example is a word and we want to be represented in that word so Joshua says um the Lord tells Joshua to take the laws of Moses and read them how often day and night to meditate on them day and night so that means that you'd have to listen to this message or whatever word day and night it's a multiple hour it's a multiple day of listening it's not a one-time listening it's told them day and night that's encompasses your whole day not just Sunday morning not just Sunday night but it's all of it in between so we meditate on the word and we meditate on the day and night so here is what the prophet said and this is the challenge that he laid to us in paragraph number 3:14 he says now paragraph 3:14 now you believe this to be true and believe it come from God and by the Vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far should not the god upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married and God bore me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of the seven seals and this is a question in God's word let them go on in as they are and sin no more it wasn't so from the beginning that's right it wasn't so and it will not be at the end but under modern conditions as God's servant I won't I won't call myself his Prophet but I believe maybe if I wouldn't be sent for that I'm laying the ground for him when he does come so under the modern conditions I command you to go to your home with your wife now if you're happy with her live with her raise your children in admonition of God but God be merciful to you if you ever do that again you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring them up in the admonition of God and now that you are as you are let's go on now at the late evening hour that we're living in and press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ where all things will be possible so he gives us the Commandment to teach our children these things um and our children need to know these things you know the callings of God and these strict Covenant of marriage and divorce according to the seven seal like I say I'm talking with my family and different people out there I don't bring them they're under a different Covenant they're not in the message so I don't they that's what I think I tell them brother Ram says you go talk to your pastor you need to pray about it you need to go and you know I try not to get too I don't put a burden on people that they can't bear cuz this right here is nobody else teaching in it like this I mean this is really is is not given to for everybody to receive and the world today they're taught from the cradle all the way up a false theology a false teaching of marriage and divorce and theyve living their lives that way and so um but when it comes to this word and this message we want to constantly put that before our class in our own minds and our own thinking and it really will help you to understand why things are the way they are why it's gone the way it's gone everything has been sexualized why everything is all just about even the men want to look pretty and look they got makeup for men and men spend more time in the mirror now well don't get me started potions and creams and soft skin and the the fluff in the I'm talking about a man now fluff in the you looking too cute man and that's coming from somewhere that's coming from somewhere that's that that's that feminization of everybody the men want to be feminized want to look cute and their fingernails filed and I I like clean fing nails too but it's like like it's so overboard with this prettiness and then why does everybody want to be attractive and pretty it's it goes back to that original sin and who's behind that brother Bram the word of God tells us that God chose that vessel to start all of the sin rolling and this is where we're at today exactly where we are today and when you can recognize that as a brother then it puts everything in check it's not so pretty after all you'll weeping cry for these people that they that that the Lord will get a hold of them hopefully somebody get saved amen so God bless you we trust the Lord will let us go into our prayer meeting and think on those things how many have their own copy of the marriage and divorce you got it somewhere a little booklet there's two out there you can have it we'll get more for you and then just read it and go through it again I believe the Lord will speak to you like he's never spoke to you before all right so let's the musicians come let's take our prayer request for a moment I know brother Bobby was in the hospital I think he still is with an infection and we're praying that the Lord will bring him all the way through amen and um I believe he's still
