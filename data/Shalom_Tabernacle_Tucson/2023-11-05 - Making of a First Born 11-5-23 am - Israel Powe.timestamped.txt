[0:03] didn't see it all the heavens as he's
[0:04] looking but here come
[0:07] forth notice where it came forth where
[0:10] did it come from it come from the
[0:13] father's
[0:15] Throne where he had been seated since he
[0:18] had been slain and raised
[0:20] again he raised up and set on the right
[0:23] hand of God ever living to make
[0:26] intercessions amen prise God hallelujah
[0:29] raise that today as an intercessor with
[0:31] his own blood to make intercession upon
[0:34] the ignorance of the
[0:37] people that's the one I'm depending on
[0:40] he still was covered with
[0:43] bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of
[0:46] sin amen John looked at that lamb and
[0:50] the lamb looked like he' been
[0:52] slain and then he noticed he was wounded
[0:55] and cut and bruised and bleeding a
[0:58] bloody lamb
[1:01] that's what took our place isn't it
[1:04] strange a simple lamb had to take our
[1:08] place and he saw the lamb he proceeded
[1:11] out John hadn't saw him because he had
[1:15] been weed back into the
[1:18] eternities even making intercession and
[1:21] showing that those who had come to God
[1:24] under the offering of the blood of bulls
[1:27] of goats a substitutionary offering he
[1:30] also calls them who believe that pointed
[1:32] to him and the blood had not been shed
[1:35] yet so he was there to clear them he was
[1:38] there to clear you and I amen and oh God
[1:42] I hope he's there
[1:45] tonight forever
[1:47] sinner the lamb been
[1:50] slain how can Jehovah see anything but
[1:54] that Bloody lamb standing there and the
[1:57] lamb proceeded out into the vision now
[1:59] as it had been
[2:01] slain
[2:03] Notice come from the father's
[2:06] Throne oh
[2:08] F he where did he advance from to this
[2:11] Vision he come from
[2:14] Glory where he seated at the right hand
[2:17] of God he Advanced forth to John out of
[2:23] Glory oh would not it be a glorious
[2:26] thing if our sinful thoughts tonight
[2:29] could be laid aside long enough to
[2:31] accepting he would Advance all the way
[2:34] from Glory tonight to make himself known
[2:37] to
[2:37] any the
[2:40] lamb advancing from glory for
[2:44] intercessions all
[2:46] right to make
[2:49] claims now for his
[2:53] Redemption remember he had been on his
[2:56] metori work back here but remember these

[3:02] opened and the lamb come from the
[3:05] sanctuary of
[3:07] God Advance forward wait till we get all

[3:28] no more for the blood
[3:30] covered lamb has walked
[3:34] away don't you wait till that
[3:38] time remember in the Old Testament as
[3:40] long as the blood was off The Mercy Seat
[3:43] it was
[3:44] judgment but as long as the blood was on
[3:47] there there was
[3:50] Mercy but when the lamb walked away that
[3:53] did it what's he been he's been an
[3:57] intercessor no other person tell me

[6:44] oh for which he was slain for as
[6:50] becoming a Kinsman to man to die in his

[7:10] lamb but now he's coming forth as a
[7:14] li his days of intercessions over let
[7:18] him that's filthy be filthy still let

[7:24] let him that's holy be holy still the
[7:27] thing is
[7:28] closed oh brother then one then one and
[7:34] remember it comes at the seventh Church
[7:38] age when the mysteries of God will be
[7:40] opened up now what's real close this is
[7:45] something you must
[7:47] get now he had been doing his
[7:49] mediatorial work making intercessions
[7:52] for the believer for 2,000 years he had
[7:56] been back there a
[7:58] lamb now he is stepping forth from
[8:03] eternity to take the title deed book and
[8:07] to break the seals and reveal the
[8:10] Mysteries amen what of it at the end
[8:13] time do you get it amen all right go on
[8:18] now break the seals and release all the
[8:24] Mysteries to them to the seventh angel
[8:28] whose message is to reveal all the
[8:31] mysteries of God the mysteries of God
[8:34] lays in these Seven
[8:36] Seals see that's what he said here all
[8:40] the Mysteries lays in these Seven Seals
[8:42] and the lamb comes forth now from being
[8:45] a mediator between God and man he
[8:49] becomes a
[8:51] lineah and when he becomes line he takes
[8:54] the book that's his
[8:58] rights yeah God's hell is the
[9:01] mystery but now the lamb comes nobody
[9:05] could take the book it's still in the
[9:06] hands of God no po pop priest whatever
[9:10] it might be they can't take no the book
[9:13] The Seven Seals hasn't been
[9:15] revealed see but when the med when his
[9:19] work is done as an intercessor he comes
[9:22] forth and John the Elder said he's alive
[9:25] and he comes forth watching oh my
[9:31] see he comes forth to take the book now
[9:34] watch to reveal the mysteries of God
[9:37] that others has guessed that in all
[9:40] these denominational
[9:42] ages see then the seventh
[9:47] angel if this book Mysteries is the word
[9:51] of God the seventh angel has to be a
[9:56] prophet for the word of God to come to
[9:59] [Music]
[10:01] no priest popes or anything else can get
[10:03] it the word don't come to
[10:05] such the word of God comes only to a
[10:10] prophet always
[10:12] amen amen Mali 4 promised such yes and
[10:17] when he come forth he take the mysteries
[10:19] of God or the church got all scrupled up
[10:22] in all these denominations and restore
[10:24] the faith of the children back to the
[10:28] fathers amen and then the world judgment
[10:31] would strike and the Earth would be
[10:32] burned and then the righteous would walk
[10:34] out upon the ashes of the wicked in the
[10:37] Millennium you understand it now all
[10:40] right Hallelujah others had guess that
[10:43] in the denominational age but see he
[10:47] must be this man the seventh angel of
[10:50] Revelations 10
[10:52] 1-4 is a the seventh angel has the
[10:58] mysteries of God given to him and
[11:00] finishes all the Mysteries it's been
[11:03] left off down through the denominational
[11:04] ages now you can see why I do not strike
[11:08] at my brethren in denomination it's the
[11:11] system of
[11:13] denomination they do not there's no need
[11:16] of them trying to know it because it
[11:18] could not be revealed that's according
[11:20] to the word they presumed at it and
[11:24] believed it was there and by faith
[11:25] walked by it but now it's evidently
[11:27] proved
[11:31] amen oh my what a what a
[11:35] scripture now watch then it is
[11:39] he the lamb that takes his kingly
[11:44] position when his saints come to crown
[11:49] him Lord of Lord and King of Kings see
[11:53] see time is run out Revelations 10:6
[11:56] there's no more time notice
[11:59] there's seven horns on this lamb did you
[12:02] notice it having seven horns we just
[12:05] been through that horns means power to
[12:07] the animal and notice he was not a
[12:12] animal because he took the book out of
[12:15] the right hand of him that set up the
[12:18] throne right see notice oh
[12:24] my I believe I had that wrote down
[12:26] somewhere oh to break the seals and to
[12:30] loose the title the title deed and uh
[12:34] the message to the liest angel and um he
[12:38] takes his kingly place that's what he
[12:39] comes forth now to do now watch when he
[12:42] comes out the seven horns now when he
[12:44] saw this lamb John looking at it it it
[12:47] looked like he' been slain
[12:49] bloody and he's come from eternity and
[12:54] he ceased to be a
[12:57] mediator then pray to Mary as much as
[12:59] you want
[13:01] to there was no man in heaven and earth
[13:04] or no person no being nowhere else could
[13:06] take it John even wept about it oh
[13:10] Catholic friend can't you see that don't
[13:13] pray to some dead person the lamb is the
[13:16] only
[13:18] mediator he was the one that came
[13:21] forth and what did he do now he's been
[13:23] back here interceding until his blood
[13:26] has atoned for every person and the lamb
[13:29] now knows what's written in the book so
[13:32] you know from the foundation of the
[13:34] world their names were in there so he
[13:35] has stood back here and re and and done
[13:39] mediator work like this until mediator
[13:42] work till every one that's been put in
[13:44] the book has been redeemed and it's
[13:47] finished and now he walks

[56:44] be back with you uh we certainly thank
[56:47] the Lord for bringing us back home
[56:49] safely we um didn't get sick on the trip
[56:53] we were strengthened and
[56:56] encouraged um didn't get a lot of sleep
[56:59] while there but it didn't seem to wear
[57:01] us down too much I think it's catching
[57:03] up a little bit on us just a little bit
[57:06] but we're happy to be here with you we
[57:09] um um we flew out as we said I think we
[57:13] were here on that Sunday morning the
[57:15] next Monday we flew out to Johannesburg
[57:18] from Phoenix that was a 5H hour flight
[57:21] to New York and then or New Jersey and
[57:23] then from New Jersey to Johannesburg was
[57:25] 15 hours so that was 20 hours on money
[57:29] Monday flying we getting to Johannesburg
[57:32] and we were able to rest Tuesday and
[57:35] then Wednesday and then I believe we had
[57:37] a service our first service was in a
[57:41] little town called
[57:44] Segundo um in outside of Johannesburg
[57:48] it's a Township very very poor um if you
[57:52] know the history of South Africa you'll
[57:54] know that the way they um segregated it
[57:57] under the apar system uh they they broke
[58:02] the people up into four classes the
[58:04] races were whites Indians and Asians
[58:08] colorss and then blacks colored is what
[58:11] we call a colored man today here in the
[58:13] US in South Africa colored is a man
[58:17] that's mixed with Indian or black and
[58:19] white or Indian and white any kind of
[58:21] mix is considered a colored there and so
[58:25] in that
[58:26] order um they were SE separated and the
[58:29] colors in blacks were sent to very small
[58:34] portions that they could live brother
[58:37] piso who spoke here I think on the
[58:41] Sunday night he was here from South
[58:43] Africa he's old enough to remember the
[58:45] apartheid because it just ended in was
[58:48] it 89 or 89 or 90 something like that
[58:53] while I'm in high school trying to get
[58:54] some Nikes brother George there's some
[58:56] folks living under the apartheid system
[58:59] I had no idea no clue and so it was very
[59:02] eye opening when I went the first time
[59:04] in
[59:05] 2017 I always wanted to bring the family
[59:08] back there to see how that how that
[59:11] regime went but brother
[59:13] Papo he knew that regime he was raised
[59:16] under it and they had tags that you'd
[59:19] have to wear to to be in the city after
[59:22] 5:00 you can be sided and arrested if
[59:25] you're a black man or colored you're in
[59:28] the wrong District so you have these
[59:29] passes and tags you wore he said he had
[59:32] like three different tags that he wore
[59:35] just to prove he was in the right place
[59:37] or had the right to be in the right
[59:38] place at a certain time it's like the
[59:41] Jim Crow but on
[59:43] steroids and so when you hear that my
[59:46] first time I went I have to drop this in
[59:49] first time I went I had an idea of who
[59:51] Nelson Mandela was but then when I went
[59:53] to Robin Island and I saw the plight and
[59:55] I saw him being in prison for 27 years
[59:59] for his wanting some freedoms and so
[1:00:02] forth I had a different respect and I
[1:00:04] came back here and I mentioned the
[1:00:07] admiration that I had for uh this man
[1:00:10] and one of the brothers here he said
[1:00:12] well to me he was nothing but a renegade
[1:00:15] well coming from your views maybe but
[1:00:18] you'd have to hear what they were
[1:00:20] fighting for and struggling for and I
[1:00:22] know that brother Brandon
[1:00:25] would have stood for anti-apartheid for
[1:00:28] sure that's all through the message no
[1:00:30] question their ideas there was that a
[1:00:33] black man didn't even have a soul they
[1:00:35] taught that in their churches in their
[1:00:37] schools and so you know you hear Brother
[1:00:39] bam talk about it on the tape you know
[1:00:42] they're running through there and he
[1:00:43] told him to slow down he says well he he
[1:00:45] doesn't even have a soul so brother
[1:00:46] randam dealt with that I'm so glad that
[1:00:49] that's on the tape at any rate so you
[1:00:51] have these different townships in these
[1:00:53] very very poor are areas and that's the
[1:00:56] first place we spoke on the Saturday
[1:00:58] morning in this place called sugundo
[1:01:02] primarily
[1:01:03] Zulus and the uh I think sutus and
[1:01:07] clausa tribes and this brother VY
[1:01:12] Livingston uh started a little work
[1:01:14] there or there was a pastor that passed
[1:01:17] and he took over this work and these
[1:01:19] folks come to church and they come to
[1:01:21] serve the Lord and you just they say
[1:01:24] Amen to the same quotes we say Amen too
[1:01:27] so you I mean when you show up you know
[1:01:29] uh this ain't
[1:01:31] home this ain't the old neighborhood but
[1:01:34] when the Praises start going up and the
[1:01:36] preaching start oh my you you fit right
[1:01:39] in brother Bobby just you don't see
[1:01:42] nothing else and so um we had a
[1:01:44] wonderful time U ministering to those
[1:01:47] folks Sun that Saturday night we had a
[1:01:49] communion service with them um it was
[1:01:53] their communion service that they had
[1:01:54] had and just uh oh my you talk about the
[1:01:58] singing and fired up oh my goodness
[1:02:03] and I was preaching and I said you know
[1:02:06] and I was kind of teasing I said they
[1:02:07] won't let me dance back at home but I
[1:02:09] feel like dancing here this morning and
[1:02:11] I almost cut
[1:02:13] one I almost turned a loose out there
[1:02:17] but I certainly enjoyed the atmosphere
[1:02:21] and they so respect uh the American and
[1:02:24] our stand for the word and it was there
[1:02:27] we got the news that um our faithful
[1:02:30] brother Billy Paul had gone on to get
[1:02:32] his reward and so sad to to see that you
[1:02:36] know of course you know brother Billy
[1:02:39] Paul was a dear friend of ours dear
[1:02:42] friend to many of the Believers here and
[1:02:45] we love him dearly and we know that
[1:02:49] um we know that you know I'm not ashamed
[1:02:52] of of brother Billy Paul not at all and
[1:02:56] uh his testimony I believe is true amen
[1:03:00] amen in fact I believe he would have to
[1:03:04] be arguably the greatest witness that
[1:03:07] the world has ever known one of them you
[1:03:10] have to it's arguable you say the
[1:03:13] disciples saw Jesus brother Adam said
[1:03:16] that he Jesus did more in my Ministry
[1:03:19] and so the magnitude of Miracles the
[1:03:23] light that come in our day brother
[1:03:26] sister don't ever be ashamed of that
[1:03:28] stand with it stand for it and um God
[1:03:32] will bless you they'll the rest of the
[1:03:34] world will figure it out later if they
[1:03:36] going to figure it out they try to
[1:03:37] figure this out try to make it say this
[1:03:40] or don't say it like that you're going
[1:03:41] to no no no no no God revealed the word
[1:03:44] to us in this day we got the truth and
[1:03:47] we should we should tell it just like it
[1:03:51] was given to us you know I was thinking
[1:03:53] about brother brandham going on the
[1:03:55] field telling the people that an angel
[1:03:57] came to him and that you know that this
[1:04:01] the great miracle of creation of
[1:04:03] squirrels I mean who can say that who
[1:04:05] else could he compare that with nobody
[1:04:08] else is talking like that but you know
[1:04:10] he stood on it and then in Houston that
[1:04:13] photograph was taken yes sir and he said
[1:04:16] that wasn't taken from me that was for
[1:04:19] you he said I believe this is to prove
[1:04:22] that I was already telling the truth so
[1:04:24] he didn't he didn't talk about this
[1:04:26] light after the picture was taken he
[1:04:28] talked about it before in years and the
[1:04:31] criticism and that you know whatever the
[1:04:33] misunderstanding and then God has the
[1:04:35] picture taken it's hanging in Washington
[1:04:38] DC today and we thank God for it same
[1:04:41] thing with the cloud ring there we were
[1:04:44] just in Sunset yesterday we hiked in
[1:04:47] with a small group of us Levi and Josh
[1:04:51] and some brothers from the Phoenix for
[1:04:52] the art and them like to greet the
[1:04:55] Saints in Phoenix by the way appreciate
[1:04:57] Brother Art putting that group together
[1:05:00] and we were able to hike in yesterday
[1:05:02] and just stand on those grounds again
[1:05:05] and knowing what God did in this day and
[1:05:08] it's under attack
[1:05:10] and it's not by coincident I don't
[1:05:13] coincidence I don't believe that as some
[1:05:17] of the great
[1:05:20] Ministries some of the great Ministries
[1:05:23] that have uh gone off the scene the
[1:05:26] eyewitnesses brother McHugh I knew him
[1:05:29] personally brother Perry green many of
[1:05:31] us knew him personally brother Bernie
[1:05:34] Garcia Roy Carpenter
[1:05:37] eyewitnesses tremendous man of God for
[1:05:40] Arizona I'd say and even there's others
[1:05:43] for sure you see how those men are
[1:05:46] taking off the scene and then you see
[1:05:47] these other Ministries that have been
[1:05:49] preaching the message for 40 plus years
[1:05:52] they they've turned in they're they'
[1:05:55] turned aside from it and they said it's
[1:05:57] not true and I don't think that's a
[1:05:59] coincidence I think those shifts
[1:06:01] happened and so I believe us losing our
[1:06:04] dear brother Billy Paul there's another
[1:06:06] one to come there sure there's more
[1:06:09] Ministries to Fall by the wayside and we
[1:06:12] shouldn't be surprised at that amen so
[1:06:16] the amount of years someone has preached
[1:06:18] or stood for it uh it's possible there's
[1:06:21] another one going to fall uh back into
[1:06:25] the things of the world and preach
[1:06:26] against it but that's that's to be but
[1:06:29] it doesn't take away from what we have
[1:06:31] in this day and a great witness a
[1:06:36] tremendous eyewitness in our day that's
[1:06:39] brother Billy Paul is has gone on and so
[1:06:44] that's a that's a sad time for us and we
[1:06:46] know the enemy is going to try to attack
[1:06:48] that vacuum but stay encouraged stay
[1:06:52] with the word these things things are
[1:06:54] true they happened all right amen amen
[1:06:59] Saints all right and
[1:07:01] so um and then that was Saturday and
[1:07:04] then Sunday morning we spoke for brother
[1:07:07] VY in another
[1:07:10] Township called Soo some of you may have
[1:07:13] heard of that it's very very I could say
[1:07:16] it was it was just poor and then and
[1:07:18] then it's but it's being trying to be
[1:07:20] developed we we preached there some of
[1:07:22] the best singing I heard him my life and
[1:07:25] brother vy's church Sunday morning then
[1:07:28] we left that and went right to the
[1:07:30] airport and caught a flight for 2: pm.

[1:07:35] brother Becket in Cape Town Sunday night
[1:07:39] Tuesday night I spoke again for brother
[1:07:41] Becket they were very very happy very
[1:07:44] very lovely very appreciative and then
[1:07:47] Wednesday morning we got on the flight
[1:07:49] from Cape Town back to Johannesburg and
[1:07:52] spoke for brother Brian n
[1:07:54] who's in the city of
[1:07:56] Johannesburg and uh we had a Wednesday
[1:07:58] night service for him with him and then
[1:08:01] we had to catch a flight at 3:00 a.m. in
[1:08:03] the morning after the service so we
[1:08:05] didn't even get to get back and rest a
[1:08:07] little bit and so but that's the way it
[1:08:09] went and so um and from there we went
[1:08:13] into Kali Rwanda and that's where
[1:08:17] brother bonso's wedding was and that was
[1:08:20] like a movie movie being a part of of
[1:08:24] his uh the the the dowy ceremony that's
[1:08:28] just one day then the wedding itself is
[1:08:31] another day and it was just phenomenal
[1:08:34] just all the traditional the way they
[1:08:37] they um ask for the bride and the family
[1:08:40] speaks she has Representatives he has
[1:08:43] representatives and they both speak back

[1:08:52] class is it you know is just back and
[1:08:54] forth a little banter a little and Bonza
[1:08:56] sitting in the back not saying a word
[1:08:58] the bride is in another room somewhere
[1:09:00] we ain't seen her for hours and I look
[1:09:02] at the brother I said when's When's the
[1:09:04] sister coming out oh she's coming the
[1:09:05] bride is coming hour or two later yeah
[1:09:08] the bride is coming I was like brother
[1:09:09] we've been saying that for 3 hours we
[1:09:12] were sitting there going back and forth
[1:09:13] in two or three different languages I
[1:09:15] didn't understand everything but she's
[1:09:18] coming she's coming so this all of this
[1:09:21] built up built up and and then finally
[1:09:24] she comes and then the dancing
[1:09:28] begins yes Believers that dance all
[1:09:31] right uhhuh and the family members and
[1:09:36] this and that and oh my so much to see
[1:09:41] they had a wonderful time they really
[1:09:43] love brother bonso there he's done very
[1:09:45] good for himself they love him very very
[1:09:48] much and um the young lady he married
[1:09:52] they've known her for years years and so
[1:09:54] two families joining together it's not
[1:09:57] an overnight event in fact the manager
[1:10:00] of our hotel he was there this the
[1:10:03] community there you're expected to be
[1:10:05] there it's not like an invitation if you
[1:10:07] know someone is getting married if you
[1:10:10] halfway know them you must go to the
[1:10:12] wedding that's the idea and so it's
[1:10:14] packed out with people food food and
[1:10:18] laughing and lots of just camaraderie is
[1:10:21] just a huge event whistling and Howling
[1:10:25] and praising and just it's a wedding and
[1:10:29] they really put their whole heart the
[1:10:32] brother told me uh we won't be able to
[1:10:35] go any to any stores today cuz we'll be
[1:10:37] at the wedding I'm like but it's all day
[1:10:40] long and so they expect you to preach
[1:10:43] the gospel at the wedding because
[1:10:45] there's visitors there and so I did
[1:10:47] preach a little bit and had the ceremony
[1:10:49] another brother preached I'm sure some
[1:10:52] of y'all couldn't hang
[1:10:55] but but you have no choice but to hang
[1:10:57] if you was there so ain't nobody else
[1:11:00] leaving so you wouldn't leave
[1:11:02] either besides where you
[1:11:05] going your ride ain't leaving so you
[1:11:07] ain't leaving so we enjoyed that it was
[1:11:11] really full very the Lord really spoke
[1:11:14] to my heart in so many different ways
[1:11:17] learning from different people and how
[1:11:18] they do things it was just really
[1:11:21] humbling and beautiful and then our last
[1:11:24] service was Sunday morning for a brother
[1:11:28] there in the city of uh keali in Rwanda
[1:11:32] there's a major storm hit there and we
[1:11:35] lost power for a little bit but they got
[1:11:37] a generator and this city of Kali is
[1:11:42] just a beautiful I'm taking my time this
[1:11:45] morning a little bit I we'll get right
[1:11:47] into the word in just a minute the city
[1:11:50] of the
[1:11:51] Rwanda was has gone under this great um
[1:11:55] genocide in ' 94 I believe it was two
[1:11:58] different tribes the huttis and the
[1:12:00] tosis lot of Bloodshed and so with that
[1:12:05] history the people there are very very
[1:12:08] humble and they're trying to rebuild the
[1:12:10] country and it's the cleanest place I've
[1:12:13] ever been to In My Life safe you talk
[1:12:16] about safety the brothers there even
[1:12:19] this brother from the Congo he said you
[1:12:21] can leave your wallet or anything no one
[1:12:23] is going to steal anything from you here
[1:12:25] I mean absolutely you just feel the
[1:12:27] atmosphere we went into the what they
[1:12:29] call the ghettos the poorest Parts no
[1:12:33] trash nowhere very very clean they have
[1:12:36] a cleaning day for the for every month
[1:12:39] that every citizen has to go through and
[1:12:41] clean or they'll be fine and you just
[1:12:43] you could just see all the way through
[1:12:45] it's well thought out how they're trying
[1:12:47] to rebuild it and they're trying to uh
[1:12:50] keep the you know the favorability upon
[1:12:53] the V visitors because the you know the
[1:12:56] um that's their income primarily is
[1:12:59] outside visitors so we had had a
[1:13:01] wonderful time with that beautiful place
[1:13:04] beautiful
[1:13:05] country but as they say there's no place
[1:13:07] like home and I'm so glad to be back
[1:13:10] home with the Saints of the most high
[1:13:13] God Amen and so we like to go into the
[1:13:17] word and there again we will uh like to

[1:14:17] into the word I've taken a bit of time
[1:14:20] and um but we have a message that we
[1:14:23] brought here once before and I'll go a
[1:14:25] little bit further into it if the Lord
[1:14:27] would help me I thank you musicians and
[1:14:30] we would stand and take our Bibles and
[1:14:32] turn to Exodus chapter
[1:14:44] 13 and I say again that us not being
[1:14:48] tired or worn out we had one flight
[1:14:52] cancellation and that turned out to be
[1:14:54] God's grace for us that was
[1:14:57] great um and we we didn't get sick and I
[1:15:01] know it's for for the Saints praying for
[1:15:05] us and I want to I want to really
[1:15:07] highlight that I really appreciate your
[1:15:10] prayers and I thank you for that that's
[1:15:13] the best thing the greatest thing you
[1:15:14] can ever do for me is to pray for me and
[1:15:18] I I'll pray for you so I thank the Lord
[1:15:21] for that Exodus and verse 1-4 and the
[1:15:25] Lord spake unto Moses saying sanctify
[1:15:28] unto me all the
[1:15:30] firstborn whatsoever open the womb among
[1:15:33] the children of Israel both of man and
[1:15:36] of Beast it is
[1:15:39] mine we'll take one more scripture in
[1:15:41] Numbers chapter
[1:15:52] 3
[1:16:07] in verse number 10 thou shall appoint
[1:16:13] Aaron his sons and they shall wait on
[1:16:15] their priest's office and the stranger
[1:16:18] that cometh nigh shall be put to death
[1:16:21] and the Lord spake unto Moses is saying
[1:16:24] and I behold I have taken the Levites
[1:16:28] from among the children of Israel
[1:16:30] instead of all of the firstborn that
[1:16:32] opened the Matrix among the children of
[1:16:34] Israel therefore the Levites shall be
[1:16:39] mine one more scripture in Hebrews
[1:16:42] chapter
[1:16:48] 12 verse number
[1:16:52] 23
[1:17:04] you have that you can say
[1:17:06] Amen to the general assembly and Church
[1:17:10] of the firstborn which are written in
[1:17:13] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[1:17:16] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[1:17:21] and the title of our message this
[1:17:23] morning is the making of a firstborn the
[1:17:27] making of a first born let's pray Lord
[1:17:31] Jesus bless your word bless your people
[1:17:35] we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you
[1:17:39] may be seated the making of a
[1:17:42] firstborn
[1:17:44] and uh we brought this here I think last
[1:17:47] year it's the first time I started going
[1:17:49] into this particular message there's a
[1:17:52] lot that goes to it but I won't go into
[1:17:54] all of the details as I've have done
[1:17:57] before it seems to have highlighted
[1:18:01] itself again to me on this trip the
[1:18:04] making of the firstborn and I want to sh
[1:18:07] share as we read in the scripture in
[1:18:09] Exodus chapter 13 that the Lord Hallows
[1:18:13] the firstborn
[1:18:14] position in Israel and it was hallowed
[1:18:18] because their life was was at
[1:18:20] stake that if if if if the sacrifice
[1:18:25] isn't done correctly then the first born
[1:18:28] will be put to death not the second born
[1:18:30] not the Third born the first born's life
[1:18:34] will be taken in Pharaoh's house in the
[1:18:38] prison in the dungeon among animals all
[1:18:42] of the firstborn will be taken when I
[1:18:45] come to Smite Egypt in the great Exodus
[1:18:48] so what does this do this raises the
[1:18:52] value of that firstborn child the
[1:18:55] firstborn position is raised now because
[1:18:59] that's the position to be put to death
[1:19:03] if we don't get it right so he's going
[1:19:05] to put all of Pharaoh's firstborn to
[1:19:08] death but not only Pharaoh all of Israel
[1:19:11] too they had to make sure their
[1:19:13] sacrifice was correct and right and so
[1:19:16] forth so let's fast forward a bit to
[1:19:19] Numbers Chapter 3 The Lord does a
[1:19:22] strange thing or phenomenal thing now
[1:19:26] where in Exodus we read that the
[1:19:28] firstborn shall be mine now the Lord
[1:19:31] says in Numbers Chapter 3 he calls Aaron
[1:19:35] he says separate the
[1:19:37] Levites and the Levites shall be
[1:19:42] mine and what he does is he tells Aaron
[1:19:46] and he tells Moses to number all of the
[1:19:49] men of the tribe of Levi and these men
[1:19:54] now will become my
[1:19:56] firstborn so whereas all of Israel's
[1:20:00] firstborn were hallowed now the Lord is
[1:20:03] moving all of the firstborn position
[1:20:05] from all of Israel over to the tribe of
[1:20:09] Levi and he's doing that for a reason he
[1:20:12] tells them to number them of the of the
[1:20:15] of the boys six months older or three
[1:20:18] months can't remember the number quite
[1:20:20] clearly yet but just a few months oh
[1:20:23] that little levite boy they counted them
[1:20:26] there were
[1:20:27] 22,000 boys in the tribe of Levi of the
[1:20:32] firstborn of all the other tribes there
[1:20:34] were
[1:20:37] 22,277 it was almost an equal number the
[1:20:41] 273 if you read Numbers Chapter 3 I
[1:20:44] encourage you to do so the Lord tells
[1:20:46] Moses to take a tally or take a number
[1:20:51] of money to make up the difference bring
[1:20:53] that to the priest it'll go into the
[1:20:56] treasury 273 I think 50 shekels per uh
[1:21:02] 273 and that's going to swap out and
[1:21:05] make this number equal now brother bham
[1:21:08] makes this statement about the
[1:21:12] Levites and he says this in the message
[1:21:15] questions and
[1:21:16] answers paragraph
[1:21:19] 245 he says now one day there was sin in
[1:21:22] Israel and there was a man by the Trea
[1:21:25] of the name of Levi they pulled their
[1:21:29] swords they went with Moses to the camp
[1:21:32] and they destroyed everything that was
[1:21:34] sin is that right God looked down and
[1:21:37] said because you did this and stood for
[1:21:41] me all of these others will serve you
[1:21:45] and you go right into the temple as
[1:21:48] priest so the Lord was pleased with what
[1:21:52] Levi did this tribe did in Exodus 32
[1:21:56] what what took place so Moses was going
[1:21:58] off of the mountain a little bit longer
[1:22:01] than the people thought he was gone so
[1:22:03] long that the people said we don't know
[1:22:05] what happened to him let's make our own
[1:22:07] God so we encourag Aaron they make a
[1:22:10] calf and they begin to worship this
[1:22:14] Idol on top of the mountain God is
[1:22:18] dealing with Moses giving him
[1:22:20] Commandments God sees this them and gets
[1:22:23] angry and wants to destroy them and
[1:22:27] Moses stands in the Gap like a true
[1:22:29] Prophet would a true leader would you
[1:22:33] know look at the offer that God offered
[1:22:35] Moses I want you to look at this God
[1:22:36] said I will wipe them out and I'll start
[1:22:39] another Nation with you y and if Moses
[1:22:42] really didn't like these people that
[1:22:44] would have been his time just to wash
[1:22:46] them off but he saids not so Lord let
[1:22:50] let it not be that you'll be angry with
[1:22:53] them because the other nations will say
[1:22:55] that you couldn't bring them out and the
[1:22:58] Lord hearkened to Moses but then when
[1:23:00] Moses comes down off the mountain and he
[1:23:03] sees the same thing that God
[1:23:05] sees he gets mad he gets so mad he wants
[1:23:10] to break something and he does break
[1:23:13] something he breaks the
[1:23:16] Commandments and then breaking them he's
[1:23:18] upset his anger and I've always said if
[1:23:22] Moses and God would have gotten mad at
[1:23:25] the same time the people would be
[1:23:28] finished that's right and you think
[1:23:30] about your sin what if God would have
[1:23:32] saw your sin sir outside of Calvary you
[1:23:36] would be finished too but somebody stood
[1:23:39] in between the Gap and said Lord he
[1:23:42] don't mean to be that way she don't know
[1:23:44] what she's doing Lord have mercy upon
[1:23:47] that that one was Christ the Lord Jesus
[1:23:51] Christ stood in the gap for you and I
[1:23:54] amen but no Moses was upset he comes
[1:23:57] down off the mountain and he says this
[1:24:00] who is on the Lord's
[1:24:02] Side and when he says that the Levites
[1:24:05] pop up they grab their sword they don't
[1:24:07] even know what they're about to do did
[1:24:08] just said who's on the Lord's Side Moses
[1:24:11] could have said who is on my side
[1:24:14] because Moses's side was the Lord's Side
[1:24:19] so Moses come out said who's on the
[1:24:21] Lord's Side didn't the crazy Levites
[1:24:23] stand
[1:24:25] up Moses says take your sword go through
[1:24:28] the camp and slay everything and they
[1:24:29] begin to slay and kill and God looked
[1:24:33] upon this and it was beautiful and
[1:24:36] because of this he separated them
[1:24:39] brother bam tells us so we see that this
[1:24:42] firstborn we know that the firstborn
[1:24:45] child they're just different aren't they
[1:24:49] huh y'all Ain going to help me preach
[1:24:53] y'all know what I'm saying is a truth
[1:24:55] how many how many firstborns here this
[1:24:56] morning let me see your hand one two
[1:24:58] three oo too many for one
[1:25:02] church we love them we love the
[1:25:04] firstborn but y all different you're
[1:25:07] very different God bless you Jesus was a
[1:25:10] firstborn that's right brother Brandon
[1:25:12] was a firstborn my wife's a firstborn no
[1:25:15] no no big deal but yall different we
[1:25:16] know that it's a birth
[1:25:20] order it's nothing you can do to become
[1:25:23] a
[1:25:24] firstborn but it's a hallow position we
[1:25:27] see this position hallowed with the
[1:25:30] prodical
[1:25:31] Son and the the the one the the the two
[1:25:35] boys one left and the other one uh uh
[1:25:38] stayed back and the firstborn had
[1:25:42] received all it's the a double portion
[1:25:44] we see that with Esa and Jacob this
[1:25:48] position of the
[1:25:50] firstborn it received a double portion
[1:25:53] from the father received greater it's a
[1:25:56] it's a beautiful position to be
[1:25:59] in but notice how God switches this
[1:26:02] firstborn Duty from all of Israel to
[1:26:06] just this tribe
[1:26:09] Levi and we see this switch happen
[1:26:12] throughout the
[1:26:14] scriptures and one of these places like
[1:26:16] I said is with Jacob and
[1:26:18] Esau Jacob was the second born but he
[1:26:23] wanted to be the first born and there
[1:26:25] was nothing he can do to change his
[1:26:28] birth
[1:26:29] order no matter how bad he cried or
[1:26:32] tried or wanted it Jacob just let it go
[1:26:36] man Esau is the first
[1:26:40] born and if you if you think of the
[1:26:44] impossibilities of some of the things
[1:26:46] that we're crying for God to do for us
[1:26:49] but nothing is too hard for God that's
[1:26:51] right and he can turn the impossible
[1:26:54] into the possible if you only
[1:26:59] believe so Jacob always on the heels of
[1:27:02] Esau wanting something that he could
[1:27:05] never get wanting a position that didn't
[1:27:07] belong to him he could not be reborn
[1:27:10] again but one day
[1:27:12] arrived where his brother was going to
[1:27:16] now sell that
[1:27:19] Birthright and the blessing that came
[1:27:23] with the birth order he swapped
[1:27:26] it and we see Jacob now receiving all
[1:27:32] the blessing that Esau
[1:27:35] had Genesis 48:18 we see this again
[1:27:39] where Jacob is going to bless his two
[1:27:41] grandsons Joseph's two boys manasse and
[1:27:44] Ephraim once's the first born once's a
[1:27:47] second born he goes to bless them and he
[1:27:50] crosses his hands
[1:27:53] and Joseph said no Daddy don't bless
[1:27:57] them this is the first one he says not
[1:27:59] so the Lord told me to do it this is the
[1:28:02] Lord now he's blessing Ephraim with the
[1:28:06] blessing of the firstborn through the
[1:28:08] cross through the cross hands prise God
[1:28:12] can I get a witness yes sir we see this
[1:28:14] at Calvary amen amen where the Old
[1:28:17] Testament Church and all the blessing of
[1:28:20] Abraham Isaac and Jacob is now leaving
[1:28:24] from the Jew over to the Gentile through
[1:28:28] the
[1:28:29] cross this is where it takes place this
[1:28:33] is where the switch happens is at the
[1:28:36] cross and we thank God for it don't we
[1:28:39] right we can take a scripture in Psalms
[1:28:42] 89 quickly and show
[1:28:46] you this taking place with King
[1:28:51] David
[1:28:52] I know this is review for many of you
[1:28:55] but it's still the
[1:28:58] truth and I can preach this message for
[1:29:00] the next rest of the
[1:29:02] year and a True Believer will still find
[1:29:05] somewhere to say amen amen your Bible is
[1:29:09] written that way amen Psalms
[1:29:14] 89 Verse 18 for the Lord is our defense
[1:29:17] the Holy One of Israel is our
[1:29:19] King then thou spakest in the to the
[1:29:22] Holy One is said I have laid and held
[1:29:24] upon one that is mighty I've exalted one
[1:29:28] chosen out of the people I have found
[1:29:31] David my servant with my holy oil have I
[1:29:35] anointed him so he's talking about David
[1:29:37] drop down to verse number 26 he shall
[1:29:40] cry unto me thou my father my God the
[1:29:43] rock of my salvation also I will make
[1:29:46] him my first born higher than the kings
[1:29:50] of the Earth so we know that David
[1:29:53] wasn't even the firstborn in his own
[1:29:55] family let alone the firstborn King Saul
[1:29:59] was but the Lord moved him into that
[1:30:04] position and this position of the
[1:30:07] firstborn we find in Hebrews chap 12
[1:30:10] that the church is the Church of the
[1:30:14] firstborn the firstborn do not go into
[1:30:19] tribulation they make the rapture it's a
[1:30:22] big difference it's a different position
[1:30:24] we're not just talking about salvation
[1:30:27] we're talking about the sunship we're
[1:30:30] talking about all the blessings that
[1:30:32] come with that position it was hallowed
[1:30:35] it was God made it that way and so
[1:30:39] through the cross is where the great
[1:30:42] switch
[1:30:44] happens where your great grandfather
[1:30:48] maybe suffered with a temper and your
[1:30:51] daddy maybe a temper and Grandpa and all
[1:30:54] of them maybe had a temper or lust or
[1:30:57] alcoholism or whatever it is nervousness
[1:31:01] but at the cross you can find a position
[1:31:05] in Christ that has nothing to do with
[1:31:09] what Mom and Dad and them did it now
[1:31:11] switches you over into the position of a
[1:31:14] son or a daughter of God where does it
[1:31:18] happen at at the cross at at the cross
[1:31:23] at the cross that's where the switch
[1:31:25] happens that's where he changes your
[1:31:28] name he changes your status he even
[1:31:31] changes your past at the
[1:31:35] cross how many thank God for the cross
[1:31:39] if you got a Ministry today thank you
[1:31:41] Lord and you forget to preach about the
[1:31:43] cross you need to get back to the Cross
[1:31:46] if you're in a church and they don't
[1:31:48] preach the cross if you're in a
[1:31:50] relationship or a job or a career and
[1:31:54] you can't see the cross then get back to
[1:31:57] the Cross because at the cross is where
[1:32:00] it all happens that's where the power
[1:32:04] is sometimes we get so revelated and so
[1:32:07] anointed that we don't even preach
[1:32:09] Calvary
[1:32:13] anymore remind you of a little story one
[1:32:17] of the preachers would give about a
[1:32:20] little boy that got lost in the
[1:32:22] neighborhood or I think he was at the
[1:32:24] mall or somewhere and he got lost and
[1:32:25] the policemen find this little boy and
[1:32:28] ask him do you know where you live and
[1:32:31] he says
[1:32:32] no do you know the address no I don't
[1:32:35] know my
[1:32:36] address do you even know the
[1:32:38] neighborhood where you're from he says
[1:32:39] no says son you don't know where you
[1:32:43] come from I don't know who you are I
[1:32:45] don't know your address I don't know how
[1:32:47] to how to get you back home you've lost
[1:32:50] your mom you lost your position now what
[1:32:53] can we do and he says well sir in my
[1:32:56] neighborhood there's an old-fashioned
[1:32:59] church and on top of that church is an
[1:33:02] old-fashioned cross he said if you can
[1:33:05] get me to the cross I can find my way
[1:33:08] back
[1:33:09] home and that's the way I feel like we
[1:33:12] get lost in our Doctrine and our
[1:33:15] attitudes we get lost in our position
[1:33:18] and our gifts and talents but we need to
[1:33:21] find the cross in any service any
[1:33:24] Ministry any preaching any song service
[1:33:29] you got to find the cross because it's
[1:33:32] at the cross where we can find where
[1:33:34] home really is
[1:33:37] amen this message is All About the Cross
[1:33:42] amen amen amen amen so we see this great
[1:33:46] switch
[1:33:47] happen at the cross of where it takes
[1:33:50] place so now let me ask
[1:33:53] you how many firstborns are here
[1:33:57] today let me see your hands if you're a
[1:34:00] firstborn huh where' it happen
[1:34:04] at where'd you get that position
[1:34:07] at come on tell somebody like you
[1:34:09] believe it I wouldn't be nothing if it
[1:34:12] wasn't for the cross I wouldn't even
[1:34:14] know my I wouldn't be I would have no
[1:34:16] direction if it wasn't for the cross he
[1:34:18] makes the switch at the cross amen so
[1:34:22] let's take this position of the Levites
[1:34:24] just for a
[1:34:26] moment so he moves the Levites over to
[1:34:29] the first one
[1:34:31] position prophet of God continues in
[1:34:33] that message that I was just reading for
[1:34:35] you he says you stay right here in the
[1:34:38] temple and the rest of them will work
[1:34:41] and will bring a tenth and take care of
[1:34:44] you is that right oh Hallelujah if you
[1:34:47] can see what the temple was that the
[1:34:50] Levites were was the bride this is that
[1:34:54] first message I was reading from
[1:34:55] questions and answers paragraph
[1:35:00] 245 I'm at
[1:35:03] paragraph 246 oh
[1:35:06] Hallelujah if you can see what the
[1:35:08] temple was the Levites was the bride now
[1:35:12] when sin is waken in on every hand and
[1:35:15] the Levites is pulling their swords the
[1:35:18] holy ghostborn bride is standing out
[1:35:21] saying Jesus Christ in the positive is
[1:35:24] Jesus Christ in the negative just the
[1:35:26] same sin is still sin it's wrong to do
[1:35:30] these things that's right they're
[1:35:32] standing there with a
[1:35:34] sword oh Hallelujah brother bam
[1:35:37] continues on God says Come Ye now
[1:35:40] blessed of my father that is the bride
[1:35:44] so you see yourself in the scripture now
[1:35:47] amen you can see that Levi is a type of
[1:35:50] the Bride
[1:35:52] and what he did for a levite he made
[1:35:54] them the first born the levite is mine
[1:35:57] they're separated people God uses them
[1:36:00] many times in the scripture to prevent
[1:36:04] the mix from
[1:36:06] happening because there was a mixed
[1:36:08] multitude that went out of
[1:36:10] Israel and when
[1:36:13] Jacob had got into problems with his
[1:36:15] daughter Dena and those two companies of
[1:36:18] people wanted to get together and
[1:36:20] intermar and they made an agreement that
[1:36:23] if you all get circumcised then we'll
[1:36:25] become one of you Jacob agreed they all
[1:36:28] agreed but then Levi and his brother
[1:36:31] Simeon come through with the sword and
[1:36:33] killed all those men it seems harsh and
[1:36:36] it was harsh it seems quite you know you
[1:36:40] didn't keep your word and they didn't
[1:36:41] keep their word but when you look at the
[1:36:44] grand scheme of things God didn't want
[1:36:46] them two people mixing together anyways
[1:36:49] he didn't want um he didn't want Israel
[1:36:53] to mix with them and they all become one
[1:36:55] people so he allowed that separation to
[1:36:58] take place this happens this will happen
[1:37:02] with you and I too the word of the Lord
[1:37:06] calls for
[1:37:08] separation and it appears like you're
[1:37:11] losing something but you can't lose
[1:37:14] nothing that the word won't return back
[1:37:17] to you many times over and over again
[1:37:21] if you take a stand for the word and you
[1:37:24] lose a friend or two or you lose a
[1:37:27] ministerial contact or you lose an open
[1:37:30] door that you used to have and
[1:37:32] fellowship is gone and that you used to
[1:37:35] have but it if it was because of the
[1:37:37] word then take courage my brother my
[1:37:40] sister you didn't lose nothing you
[1:37:43] actually gained something because the
[1:37:46] word of the Lord is our absolute and
[1:37:49] every step that we take in that word is
[1:37:53] a step towards the Rapture which we're
[1:37:56] all trying to make here today and we're
[1:37:58] not gonna make a Rapture and not be a
[1:38:00] part of the firstborn with part of the
[1:38:03] word it's got to be all of the word so
[1:38:06] there's some separation that takes
[1:38:09] place he allows for this also with
[1:38:13] Phineas numbers
[1:38:16] 25 when there was BAC and balam had got
[1:38:22] the mixing with Israel and got them an
[1:38:25] influence of balam's teaching amongst
[1:38:27] them and they wanted to mix with the
[1:38:30] Midian itish women and and they partied
[1:38:33] and so forth and this young man by the
[1:38:35] name of Phineas he's a levite yes he
[1:38:39] didn't ask
[1:38:40] permission that's right he saw what
[1:38:42] needed to get done that's right he
[1:38:45] grabbed a javelin he didn't wait for
[1:38:47] Amen Corner he didn't wait for others to
[1:38:50] support him this is wrong and I need to
[1:38:54] take a stand for it that's what a True
[1:38:56] Believer does when we see it in the word
[1:38:59] brother that is your okay that is your
[1:39:03] thumbs up that is go get them when you
[1:39:06] see it in the word then God is giving
[1:39:09] you the permission by his
[1:39:13] word it didn't come doesn't come from
[1:39:15] other groups of
[1:39:16] men comes out of the word yes sir you
[1:39:20] listening to the message amen it strikes
[1:39:23] your heart come on when's the time to
[1:39:25] say amen that's right right
[1:39:29] now you cooking no big old steak and
[1:39:31] wait till everybody else get around to
[1:39:33] take a bite no that steak is ready eat
[1:39:36] it
[1:39:37] now and that's what the word of the Lord
[1:39:39] is to
[1:39:40] us we don't ask permission to say
[1:39:45] Amen we don't wait for the other
[1:39:47] churches to say
[1:39:49] Amen we don't wait till they catch up
[1:39:52] and understand what the vision meant
[1:39:54] it's not my business but when God opens
[1:39:57] my eyes to the
[1:39:58] truth glory to God now it's time for me
[1:40:03] to go forward what he showed me to do
[1:40:06] and that's what a firstborn will do
[1:40:09] he'll take the
[1:40:12] charge a little
[1:40:15] aggressive little rough on the
[1:40:18] edges but God is in it come on Phineas
[1:40:21] goes through and grabs that Javelin yes
[1:40:24] sir and there's no nice way to say
[1:40:30] this could you imagine a nice way to
[1:40:33] pierce somebody through with a
[1:40:35] javelin is there a more tactful way to
[1:40:38] do it no son get the javelin and put him
[1:40:43] to death and when he did it there was a
[1:40:46] plague that struck out when he did it
[1:40:48] other lives were saved
[1:40:51] because he took a stand for the word and
[1:40:55] when the Lord saw it he said my Covenant
[1:40:59] of Peace will be with
[1:41:04] you didn't ask Moses didn't ask Joshua
[1:41:07] then ask this group and that one it's
[1:41:10] called character
[1:41:13] amen character sees what needs to get
[1:41:16] done and they just do it amen am I right
[1:41:22] Saints like Rachel and or Rebecca with
[1:41:27] the camels watering the camels how many
[1:41:30] remember that she watered those camels
[1:41:33] didn't she who asked her to who probed
[1:41:37] her to no her character told her to cuz
[1:41:42] she saw this man that camels that needed
[1:41:44] water so she went and did it that's what
[1:41:47] character does that's what the word does
[1:41:50] for the belever
[1:41:52] belever it's always easier to go down a
[1:41:55] path that's already been blazed for you
[1:41:57] but some of the paths you got to go down
[1:41:59] by
[1:42:01] yourself yes sir God shows you before he
[1:42:04] shows somebody else before your peer
[1:42:07] group or the your little group of
[1:42:08] friends or your age group or your your
[1:42:11] your social class or your social you
[1:42:13] might be the first one who shows it to
[1:42:15] you got to make that move my sister my
[1:42:19] brother and God if it's the word now God
[1:42:23] will bless you for it so we see that
[1:42:27] through the scriptures this position of
[1:42:30] the Levites that moves forward and gets
[1:42:35] the job done they stop the halting they
[1:42:39] stop the mixing amen I like this what
[1:42:44] brother banam says in the message the
[1:42:46] indictment he's talking about this same
[1:42:49] scripture in Exodus chap chapter 32
[1:42:51] where Moses said who's on the Lord's
[1:42:53] Side you see the Levites
[1:42:55] appeared after 2 and 1/2 hours 2 hours
[1:42:59] 25 minutes of preaching the
[1:43:02] indictment did we listen to that here
[1:43:06] uhhuh did you guys say Amen when he said
[1:43:09] came to this part what part was y'all
[1:43:11] sleep
[1:43:12] on come on somebody maybe we need to
[1:43:16] play it again
[1:43:17] tonight everybody ain't smiling
[1:43:22] but when he asked this question at the
[1:43:24] 2H hour and 25 minute Mark who is on the
[1:43:27] Lord's
[1:43:28] Side he says I say it on this tape for
[1:43:32] this audience I say it under the
[1:43:35] inspiration of the Holy Ghost who is on
[1:43:37] the Lord's Side let him come under this
[1:43:41] word God will truly bring this wicked
[1:43:45] Christ denying Christ rejecting
[1:43:48] generation into judgment for blasphemy
[1:43:50] for me the crucifixion of his identified
[1:43:55] word they're coming into judgment I
[1:43:58] indicted who is on the Lord's Side said
[1:44:02] Moses let him come unto me with the
[1:44:05] pillar of fire hanging there as an
[1:44:08] Evidence who is on the Lord's Side let
[1:44:11] him take up this word deny his Creed and
[1:44:15] follow Jesus Christ daily and I'll meet
[1:44:18] you in the morning amen now can I say
[1:44:21] something
[1:44:22] here The Prophet could have said who is
[1:44:25] on my
[1:44:27] side y'all didn't worry about it when I
[1:44:30] said Moses could say that but now the
[1:44:33] prophet could say who is on my
[1:44:38] side let him take up his cross and
[1:44:42] follow the word the message of the hour
[1:44:46] I want you to think about
[1:44:48] that we're in this hour in this changing
[1:44:51] of
[1:44:52] times where people are shifting in their
[1:44:56] position and they're going back now
[1:44:58] remember at the cross he moves you into
[1:45:02] a firstborn position also it's at the
[1:45:07] cross where he moves all of your sins
[1:45:12] from off of you and they places it on
[1:45:16] Satan for the day of the
[1:45:19] judgment
[1:45:21] amen how many thank God for the cross at
[1:45:24] the cross he blocks out your old book
[1:45:28] and he begins a new book under the
[1:45:31] Lamb's Book of Life at the cross he
[1:45:35] makes a minister out of you a lady out
[1:45:40] of you a Believer out of you where you
[1:45:44] used to be a doubter a luster a evil
[1:45:47] worker but now he made you a CHR
[1:45:51] Christian this all happens at the cross
[1:45:55] now this
[1:45:58] cross was not an easy
[1:46:01] task there was a price that was paid at
[1:46:05] the cross so can I get into this just
[1:46:06] for a little bit where do the Levites
[1:46:09] come from they come from their birth
[1:46:13] mothers brother bam deals with these
[1:46:15] birth mothers under their labor
[1:46:19] pains and if you take the scripture in
[1:46:22] fact we'll take one scripture here let's
[1:46:24] take oh my Genesis
[1:46:28] Chapter 30 I think is what I
[1:46:35] want y' got
[1:46:39] time do I have plenty time
[1:46:42] though there's a difference
[1:46:45] now all right let's get
[1:46:48] it Genesis Chapter 30 I think go by my
[1:46:56] memory you remember Jacob marri's two
[1:46:59] girls or two
[1:47:02] sisters Leah and what was the other
[1:47:05] one's name
[1:47:08] Rachel
[1:47:10] Leah was by contract because she was the
[1:47:15] first
[1:47:17] born Rachel was by love
[1:47:22] Jacob loved her is that right
[1:47:27] Saints and he couldn't make himself stop
[1:47:32] loving Rachel because he married
[1:47:36] Leah they switch it up on him at the
[1:47:39] marriage
[1:47:41] day the Bible says that in the morning
[1:47:44] behold It was
[1:47:46] Leah and it shook
[1:47:49] him
[1:47:52] if we'd all be
[1:47:53] honest it would Shake us
[1:47:57] too I thought you was
[1:48:00] Leah I thought you was Rachel but you're
[1:48:03] really
[1:48:05] Leah
[1:48:08] huh and she played the role didn't
[1:48:12] she that don't happen overnight now she
[1:48:16] played the
[1:48:19] role
[1:48:20] I'll let your imagination go further
[1:48:22] into that you know are you kind of sound
[1:48:27] like Leah are you right oh I'm
[1:48:33] rightel but Jacob did the same thing
[1:48:35] didn't he to his
[1:48:38] daddy his dad rubbed him on his
[1:48:41] head man you your voice sounds like
[1:48:45] Jacob but your skin is are you is yeah
[1:48:48] I'm Esau
[1:48:54] he got over didn't he but in the morning
[1:48:57] it was
[1:48:59] Leah oh what a
[1:49:03] payback he rubbing on Jacob he he thinks
[1:49:07] that's Esau he's rubbing on Leah
[1:49:09] thinking it's
[1:49:12] Rachel so when God pays you back you get
[1:49:14] paid back real good I guess that's the
[1:49:16] point in
[1:49:18] that she bear Jacob no children Rachel
[1:49:22] envied her and said unto Jacob give me
[1:49:25] children or else I die and Jacob's anger
[1:49:29] was kindled against Rachel and he says
[1:49:32] am I in God's standad who hath withheld
[1:49:36] who hath withheld from Thee the fruit of
[1:49:39] the
[1:49:39] womb and she beheld my maid bah and she
[1:49:43] said behold my maid Billa go unto her
[1:49:46] and she shall bear upon her knees that I
[1:49:48] may also have children children by her
[1:49:52] so it's where Napal is born let's see if
[1:49:55] you can help me find that verse
[1:49:58] there
[1:50:00] huh verse number eight yes in verse
[1:50:04] eight this is it right here thank you
[1:50:06] brother and Rachel said with great
[1:50:19] wrestlingspotlight
[1:50:20] wrestling that's going on between these
[1:50:23] two
[1:50:24] sisters and brother bham calls it the
[1:50:27] labor
[1:50:29] pains that goes with the
[1:50:32] birth that goes with the cross the
[1:50:36] switching that takes place it's a new
[1:50:38] birth this new birth is something that
[1:50:41] we labor on it even in this little
[1:50:44] church here the beginning of the year we
[1:50:46] try to have some meetings for that for
[1:50:50] for those that wanted to receive the
[1:50:51] Holy
[1:50:52] Ghost the enemy wasn't happy with that
[1:50:54] he's still not happy with it he wants to
[1:50:57] grow cold on that but it's a birth it's
[1:51:00] a death it's a Str it's
[1:51:04] wrestling it's two sisters
[1:51:07] wrestling one wants to have children and
[1:51:10] she can't the other one wants her
[1:51:13] husband's love but he can't and it
[1:51:16] creates this wrestle between the two
[1:51:19] sisters brother Bram calls it labor
[1:51:22] pains it's through these labor pains
[1:51:26] that the gifts come
[1:51:28] forth through these labor pains that
[1:51:31] Ministries are
[1:51:33] born yes yes we don't see it like that
[1:51:37] all the time but that's how it comes it
[1:51:40] was in her own house was her great
[1:51:43] enemy brother mam tells us in the
[1:51:45] message the ark he says this here I was
[1:51:48] reading the other day while sitting on
[1:51:49] the Creek Bank of how those Hebrew
[1:51:52] mothers that give birth back there to
[1:51:55] the Patriarchs each one when she come
[1:51:58] forth and uttered his name while in
[1:52:01] labor said what he would be and what he
[1:52:05] would be in the last days not knowing
[1:52:08] what she was doing and muttering take a
[1:52:11] hold of Genesis 49 take it out type it
[1:52:14] out where they're in time where they're
[1:52:16] at and watch what it is it's right there
[1:52:19] so it looks like a carnal battle between
[1:52:22] two sisters give me children L I die and
[1:52:26] Leah every child she said now my husband
[1:52:28] will be joined to me or now my husband
[1:52:31] will love me or now because I borne him
[1:52:34] another son he'll draw closer to me all
[1:52:36] of her everything was about her love
[1:52:40] from her husband to be complete and
[1:52:44] that's how she named those kids those
[1:52:48] children and it looks like a carnal
[1:52:50] battle it is a carnal battle but it was
[1:52:52] a supernatural
[1:52:55] naming through the labor
[1:52:58] pains here what brother Ram says here I
[1:53:01] like this one if I don't get another one
[1:53:03] we'll get this one in this in the
[1:53:04] message Revelation a book of symbols all
[1:53:09] right paragraph
[1:53:12] 55 catch this first part this is not
[1:53:15] really with our message but catch this
[1:53:16] is really nice Angelic beings
[1:53:20] Associated together oh I hope you get
[1:53:24] that that just dropped right down free
[1:53:28] look and if you got the holy spirit in
[1:53:31] you then you're a candidate for
[1:53:35] association with the Unseen World and
[1:53:38] the
[1:53:40] supernatural no wonder people can't
[1:53:42] believe in those things they never come
[1:53:44] in contact they got nothing in here to
[1:53:47] believe with but when the Holy Spirit
[1:53:49] comes Into the Heart quickly he becomes
[1:53:52] then a two-fold being one of the earth
[1:53:56] to die one of Heaven to live Amen in his
[1:54:02] body he's still subject to death but in
[1:54:04] his soul he's passed from Death unto
[1:54:07] life in his body he has Earthly contact
[1:54:10] with five senses in his Spirit he has
[1:54:13] contact with God through the Holy Ghost
[1:54:17] and the angels of God visit them
[1:54:20] speaks with them and they are messengers
[1:54:23] sent from God to reveal and to bring
[1:54:27] messages from God to the individual how
[1:54:31] many love that that's for people who
[1:54:32] have the Holy Spirit you're in in

[1:55:14] righteousness and all these other things
[1:55:17] will be added unto you
[1:55:20] Amen brother ban continues
[1:55:23] on paragraph 57 a boy was at the door
[1:55:27] knock at the door there and told the
[1:55:28] Usher I have a telegram here from Mrs so
[1:55:32] and so and Mr so and so he would be a
[1:55:34] messenger or an Earthly Angel your
[1:55:38] pastor when he stands here on the
[1:55:40] platform ministering the word of God he
[1:55:41] is an angel of God to the
[1:55:43] church Messenger to the church therefore
[1:55:47] Pastor should never leave that word but
[1:55:51] stay straight with the word because he's
[1:55:54] feeding the shepherd's Place cu the word
[1:55:58] pastor means a Shepherd look it up and
[1:56:00] find out if it ain't right a pastor is a
[1:56:03] shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him
[1:56:05] overseer over a certain flock to feed
[1:56:08] them what with the word of God Amen oh
[1:56:11] my watch all those names they mean
[1:56:14] something every name in the Bible when
[1:56:17] you see one name in the Bible it means
[1:56:21] something did you know Israel's wives
[1:56:24] when they gave birth to the 12
[1:56:26] Patriarchs each one of those mothers
[1:56:29] when they were having the baby and the
[1:56:31] baby was being born and them groaning
[1:56:34] and the groans that they came out and
[1:56:36] name those boys the very groans that
[1:56:40] they give signify the nature of the
[1:56:43] child and the place they'd make their
[1:56:46] final resting place every GR gr amen
[1:56:51] under the power of the Holy
[1:56:53] Ghost that's the reason we should be
[1:56:55] groaning in the
[1:56:57] spirit now I don't mean a lot of this
[1:56:59] put on but I mean really in travail for
[1:57:03] the church then the Holy Spirit then you
[1:57:05] can get some real speaking with tongues
[1:57:08] and interpretation the Holy Spirit
[1:57:11] making utterance that tells through
[1:57:13] groans prayer be real truth to it it'll
[1:57:17] be something right now that you'll see
[1:57:19] take place
[1:57:22] Amen Let Me Go a little bit further in
[1:57:24] the message adoption I have a few more
[1:57:26] minutes the message adoption 1960
[1:57:28] brother bam says this
[1:57:31] here paragraph 48 notice this just burns
[1:57:34] our heart each one of those Hebrew
[1:57:36] mothers giving birth to those children
[1:57:39] she spoke the very place in her labor
[1:57:42] pains where they would be positioned in
[1:57:44] the promised land oh it's a great study
[1:57:47] if we can only go into details which
[1:57:49] would take hours after hours someday
[1:57:52] we'll get our church fixed I like to
[1:57:54] come and take a solid month or two and
[1:57:57] just stay right with it watch when they
[1:57:59] come each one of those mothers when she
[1:58:02] called out Ephraim when she was in
[1:58:05] labber positionally placed him where his
[1:58:09] feet was setting in oil just exactly
[1:58:11] every one of them whenever they were
[1:58:14] wherever they were at Joshua not knowing
[1:58:17] this but by inspiration L of the Holy
[1:58:20] Spirit after being in the promised land
[1:58:23] give each man his promise exactly what
[1:58:26] the Holy Spirit promised through the
[1:58:29] birth back there how that God has set
[1:58:32] some in the church through the labor
[1:58:37] pains oh they get tremendous
[1:58:41] sometimes when a church is groaning
[1:58:44] under the persecution of the outside
[1:58:46] world Believing on the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:58:50] that the promise of the Holy Ghost is
[1:58:52] just as real to us as it was to
[1:58:54] Pentecost how they grown under labor
[1:58:58] pains but when they are born and
[1:59:01] positionally Born Into the kingdom of
[1:59:03] God then the Holy Ghost has set in the
[1:59:06] church some Apostles some prophets some
[1:59:10] teachers amen some pastors some
[1:59:13] evangelists then he gives into their
[1:59:16] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[1:59:18] tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of
[1:59:21] healing all kinds of Miracles so this
[1:59:23] comes through the labor
[1:59:25] pains the labor pains is the birth of
[1:59:29] something a true Ministry has to go
[1:59:32] through that birth a True Believer is
[1:59:36] birth into the kingdom of God you're not
[1:59:39] just set out with a Ministry you're born
[1:59:42] into it and brother bam is bringing us
[1:59:45] how these gifts they're through the
[1:59:48] labor pain just brought out these names
[1:59:51] of these boys that come through they
[1:59:54] they were Patriarchs through these
[1:59:56] mothers wrestling with one another love
[1:59:59] and and fertility and being able to be
[2:00:03] born and I was first and your last it
[2:00:05] was deception oh my sister and all this
[2:00:08] great wrestling and through it all God
[2:00:10] is birthing a
[2:00:13] nation birthing
[2:00:16] Patriarchs and these labor pains don't
[2:00:19] stop Even in our Christian church
[2:00:22] today we want everything to be nice and
[2:00:25] great but it's not going to be in fact
[2:00:28] you'll know true Ministries through the
[2:00:32] Winds of unbelief that come around some
[2:00:36] people might just swallow anything go
[2:00:37] for anything go for anything but you see
[2:00:39] somebody take a stand for the word you
[2:00:42] say oh wow that's a gift that's a real
[2:00:44] son right there that's a
[2:00:47] levite that's a first
[2:00:50] born that's a bride member cuz everybody
[2:00:54] that get the Bible ain't the
[2:00:56] bride but she will show who she's is
[2:01:01] when the word comes out who's on the
[2:01:03] Lord's
[2:01:04] Side those opportunities will
[2:01:07] come they're here today amen who's on
[2:01:11] the Lord's
[2:01:12] Side
[2:01:14] mhm can you see that
[2:01:17] church that's
[2:01:20] Calvary he makes the great switch at
[2:01:22] Calvary doesn't he that's where the new
[2:01:25] birth takes place when you have your own
[2:01:27] Calvary that day on Calvary you have
[2:01:32] that day your day on Calvary and that's
[2:01:35] where this switching of natures takes
[2:01:38] place it's not an easy easy happening at
[2:01:41] all the one that brought this message
[2:01:44] with the tremendous gifts in his life
[2:01:47] suffered his life was
[2:01:50] squeezed until he wanted to give up he
[2:01:54] wanted to commit suicide he wanted to
[2:01:56] throw in the towel but God had his hand
[2:01:58] over his life what about you and I
[2:02:01] brother and sister you know this making
[2:02:04] of a firstborn or God bringing you into
[2:02:07] position of the firstborn you got to be
[2:02:09] in the word my brother my sister it's a
[2:02:13] life of prayer it's staying steady
[2:02:16] through the hard times steady when
[2:02:19] others can't you know all of Israel
[2:02:22] falling for that golden calf could you
[2:02:24] imagine seeing your relatives and
[2:02:26] friends all caught up with Aaron with
[2:02:29] the golden calf I mean the majority was
[2:02:32] doing it but when Moses came now say
[2:02:35] who's on the Lord's Side so glad
[2:02:38] somebody stood up said I'm on the Lord's
[2:02:41] Side yes you have the opportunity to
[2:02:45] take that stand this
[2:02:47] morning who's on the Lord's Side side
[2:02:50] tell you right now it's not going to be
[2:02:51] the majority that's right it's going to
[2:02:53] be the
[2:02:55] minority but it's through these labor
[2:02:57] pains that pastors are
[2:03:01] developed evangelists are
[2:03:04] developed real friends are developed
[2:03:09] people you can trust are developed
[2:03:13] praise the name of the Lord you see
[2:03:15] everybody shifting this way and people
[2:03:17] backsliding going this way and this one
[2:03:19] running over here and that one running
[2:03:21] over there you watch that man that stays
[2:03:23] steady with the word you watch that
[2:03:25] sister that stays steady with the word
[2:03:28] that's the one you need to be close
[2:03:30] to they are you you are them you the
[2:03:34] same same breed
[2:03:38] amen oh
[2:03:40] my can I continue for a few more minutes
[2:03:43] not even
[2:03:44] 12:00 in Africa didn't give me no
[2:03:47] problem we was on on African
[2:03:50] time amen praise the Lord God bless you
[2:03:56] amen let's go a little bit further I
[2:03:58] just want to take this part here in this
[2:04:02] why it had to be Shepherds paragraph
[2:04:05] number 17 another reason I might say
[2:04:09] notice the babe was born in Bethlehem
[2:04:12] Bethlehem Hebrew interpretation as we uh
[2:04:16] had a couple years ago Bethlehem means
[2:04:17] the house of God's bread
[2:04:19] we proved in the scripture he could not
[2:04:22] come any other place Bethlehem was
[2:04:24] founded by Rahab her husband Rahab was a
[2:04:28] harlot that a general courted Israelite
[2:04:31] Army after they had taken Jericho and by
[2:04:34] faith she believed the message of God in
[2:04:37] her condition she was saved and from
[2:04:41] there when Joshua divided up the lands
[2:04:43] of where each one would be there's a
[2:04:46] great lesson that sometime I hope to be
[2:04:49] able to bring at toussant of these
[2:04:52] Hebrew mothers giving birth to those
[2:04:55] babies when she groaned at the birth
[2:04:58] pain of the baby she called the name of
[2:05:01] the baby and that positionally placed it
[2:05:05] in the promised land in its tribe the
[2:05:09] great thing all the word of God fits
[2:05:12] right together if it doesn't fit
[2:05:14] together it's not God's word that's
[2:05:16] Misfits it's your thoughts it's
[2:05:19] misfitting to the word it all fits
[2:05:24] together so let's go into this birth
[2:05:27] just a little bit
[2:05:29] further we know it happened at the cross
[2:05:32] but brother Brandon preaches a message
[2:05:34] entitled birth
[2:05:36] pains and it makes this statement I
[2:05:39] think it's in paragraph number
[2:05:41] 89 I was listening to this the other day
[2:05:45] remember this message birth pains is a
[2:05:47] powerful message if you get a chance to
[2:05:49] listen to it this message the birth
[2:05:53] pains is where he he shares the great
[2:05:57] vision of the Bride the vision of the
[2:06:01] Bride that he had also brings in the
[2:06:04] Judgment of California which a lot of
[2:06:07] people are shaking over because they
[2:06:08] want to take brother Billy Paul's
[2:06:10] testimony and try to make that fit and
[2:06:12] make that fit with that one he says
[2:06:14] sharks will be swimming and and if the
[2:06:16] sharks are swimming did B Billy Paul
[2:06:18] know it took place or it did take place
[2:06:21] look let me just say this come on now it
[2:06:25] was thus said the Lord California is
[2:06:26] going down do you believe that yes or
[2:06:29] no
[2:06:31] finalize okay so with the cloud picture
[2:06:34] here so I'm bringing this up cuz while I
[2:06:36] was abroad a little there some of the
[2:06:38] brothers would ask me so brother Israel
[2:06:40] what what do you think about this thing
[2:06:42] with brother Billy Paul being gone
[2:06:44] brother it's just a distraction what do
[2:06:46] you mean what do I think what was I
[2:06:48] supposed to change that's right look who
[2:06:51] brother Billy Paul gave a true testimony
[2:06:54] and I believe his testimony is true
[2:06:57] that's it that's right nothing else to
[2:06:59] add to it you believe he is or you don't
[2:07:03] believe it I believe he a true
[2:07:07] witness and so one of the brother asked
[2:07:10] about the cloud ring and brother Banner
[2:07:12] was supposed to be in Houston when those
[2:07:15] kids and it was it hunting Seas it was
[2:07:17] it not was those dates in collaboration
[2:07:21] wait stop right there there's a cloud
[2:07:23] ring up there do you see the face of
[2:07:26] Jesus there did that happen that settles
[2:07:30] it that's it you can try to make dates
[2:07:33] work if you want to but God never called
[2:07:36] me to make the dates work he called me
[2:07:40] to say Amen to a Vindicated message and
[2:07:44] that's what I'm going to do say Amen to
[2:07:47] the word
[2:07:49] that God send in this
[2:07:52] day come on I like brother McHugh when
[2:07:55] he says I'm not an
[2:07:56] explainer I'm a
[2:07:59] believer I'm a preacher that believes
[2:08:03] I'm not a preacher that
[2:08:05] explains I'll explain to you that you
[2:08:08] need to believe that's my explanation
[2:08:11] believe all that the prophet has
[2:08:14] spoken the vision over California wasn't
[2:08:17] brother Bam's idea the Lord spoke to him
[2:08:21] the vision of the tent wasn't brother
[2:08:23] bram's idea the Lord spoke to the vision
[2:08:27] all the Visions none of them were his
[2:08:30] idea God spoke to him and as a Believer
[2:08:34] as a preacher that's what I preach
[2:08:37] that's what I say Amen to what God done
[2:08:40] in this
[2:08:42] day leave it to the explainers to
[2:08:46] explain that's good yes praise the Lord
[2:08:49] on
[2:08:51] Amen did I get that off my
[2:08:54] chest did I deliver it like I felt it
[2:08:57] yes I am a
[2:09:00] believer of this message what's on the
[2:09:03] tape
[2:09:11] it praise the name of the Lord in the
[2:09:14] message birth pains paragraph number 43
[2:09:17] brother bam says this here
[2:09:20] and I have to close
[2:09:24] here he says I believe that Jesus here
[2:09:28] was speaking of as he said you will have
[2:09:31] sorrow so let's take the scripture here
[2:09:32] just for a moment just before we close
[2:09:34] it's in St
[2:09:37] John let's
[2:09:42] see excuse me just one
[2:09:47] moment
[2:09:53] chapter 16 turn there quickly and we'll
[2:09:57] close with this scripture St John
[2:09:58] chapter
[2:10:04] 16 there's two different forces working
[2:10:09] today in this message birth pains
[2:10:12] explains it
[2:10:15] all you say St John chapter 16
[2:10:19] quickly
[2:10:23] amen
[2:10:25] Jesus
[2:10:26] speaking of his
[2:10:35] departure what verse did I
[2:10:38] call verse
[2:10:41] 20 verely verily I say unto you that you
[2:10:45] shall weep and lament but the world
[2:10:47] shall shall
[2:10:49] rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but
[2:10:52] your sorrow shall be turned into
[2:10:56] Joy a woman when she is in travail hath
[2:11:00] sorrow because her hour is come but as
[2:11:04] soon as she is delivered of a child she
[2:11:08] rememberthe
[2:11:09] anguish old things are passed away for
[2:11:13] joy that a man is Born Into the world
[2:11:17] this is the believer's experience this
[2:11:20] is what Calvary does there is pain there
[2:11:24] is sorrow there is death associated with
[2:11:28] this new
[2:11:30] birth and anytime the ministry removes
[2:11:34] that part out of the Christian
[2:11:36] experience then that is not a true
[2:11:39] Christian
[2:11:40] experience you come to the Lord Jesus to
[2:11:44] die of the old self your old thoughts
[2:11:48] we're not here to make up make you over
[2:11:50] and try to clean you up no you have to
[2:11:53] die all the way completely die and then
[2:11:57] be reborned again that's the calvary
[2:12:00] experience that we're talking about
[2:12:02] we're not talking about you coming in
[2:12:04] and just getting a little anointing on
[2:12:06] you and say you've been switched over to
[2:12:08] the firstborn you're not switched over
[2:12:10] into a firstborn until you've been born
[2:12:12] again when you're born again your birth
[2:12:16] brings you into that firstborn position
[2:12:18] which is the Bride of Jesus Christ which
[2:12:20] you escaped the tribulation now ready
[2:12:23] for the Rapture can I get a witness this
[2:12:25] is what Calvary is all about this is
[2:12:28] what Jesus is speaking of here about the
[2:12:31] New Birth the birth of
[2:12:34] Christianity brother banam says it well
[2:12:37] he says it right here that's his opening
[2:12:39] scripture for birth
[2:12:41] pains paragraph 43 say I believe Jesus
[2:12:44] here was speaking of says you will have
[2:12:47] sorrow M but your sorrow be turned to
[2:12:50] Joy speaking to his disciples here
[2:12:52] knowing that the birth of
[2:12:55] Christianity was coming into
[2:12:59] existence when did you come into
[2:13:03] existence oh my at the cross at the
[2:13:08] cross where I first saw the light and
[2:13:12] the burden of you know how the church
[2:13:14] came into existence it was a miracle it
[2:13:17] a miracle what happens to the
[2:13:19] individual is that right Saints is that
[2:13:22] right church let me read the quote here
[2:13:25] just fires me up speaking to his
[2:13:28] disciples here knowing that the birth of
[2:13:31] Christianity was coming into existence
[2:13:34] and now the old has to die in order that
[2:13:37] the new is born to have anything that
[2:13:41] gives birth has to have Pains of
[2:13:45] distress and they certainly was going
[2:13:47] going to go through the pain of distress
[2:13:52] and anguish to get from the law unto
[2:13:58] Grace paragraph 61 now we notice that it
[2:14:01] always my thought now to you it takes
[2:14:05] pain this same message sorry it's in the
[2:14:08] birth pains just drop down to paragraph
[2:14:10] 61 we notice that it always my thought
[2:14:13] now to you it takes pain
[2:14:16] distress discomfort look how them
[2:14:20] Pharisees die to that law through pain
[2:14:25] distress
[2:14:26] discomfort but it
[2:14:28] must
[2:14:33] be praise the
[2:14:36] Lord don't you love the
[2:14:38] Lord
[2:14:40] amen God's got something good in store
[2:14:43] for you it always starts with the dying
[2:14:47] out of of the old and bringing into the
[2:14:51] new do we really want more of
[2:14:54] God well it costs a greater
[2:14:58] price I have more I can say here I'll
[2:15:00] just stop right there I really see this
[2:15:04] end time shift amongst Ministries and
[2:15:07] church groups and trying to look more
[2:15:11] like the organization and trying to you
[2:15:13] know pattern ourselves with the love
[2:15:15] that the world has and there's nobody in
[2:15:18] the world can teach you how to
[2:15:21] love outside of God and a Vindicated
[2:15:26] message amen don't let the devil fool
[2:15:28] you or get you sidetracked on something
[2:15:31] else stay with the word stay with the
[2:15:35] Vindication stay with this message God
[2:15:40] called us to it and it takes a strong
[2:15:43] hand to stay right with it yeah there's
[2:15:45] lots of strong influences that riseing
[2:15:48] have Rosen up and they will continue to
[2:15:50] rise remember there'll be a new doctrine
[2:15:54] that'll start here
[2:15:55] shortly I don't know what it's called
[2:15:58] but we know it's going to
[2:15:59] come right and guess what there's some
[2:16:02] people that going to believe it right
[2:16:04] and it goingon to run after people you
[2:16:06] know are going to run after it this is
[2:16:08] what we need to do this is how stay with
[2:16:10] the word Saints stay with this message
[2:16:13] stay with the Bible the Holy Ghost stay
[2:16:17] with the prophet ET stay with the Lord's
