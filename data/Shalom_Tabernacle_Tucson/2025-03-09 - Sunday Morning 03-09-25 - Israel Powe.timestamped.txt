[2:30] 12 verse unto the angel of the Church of
[2:34] peros write these things sayth he that a
[2:38] sharp sword with two
[2:41] edges I know Works th dwell even Satan's
[2:48] SE and thou holdest fast my name and has
[2:52] not denied my faith even in those days
[2:56] Orin anus was my faithful martyr who was
[3:01] slain among you or Satan
[3:04] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[3:06] thee because thou has there them that
[3:11] hold the doctrine of balum who taught B
[3:16] to cast the stumbling block before the
[3:18] children of Israel to eat things
[3:20] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[3:24] fornication so H has thou also then that
[3:28] hold the doctrine
[3:33] his deeds back there in Ephesus now it's
[3:35] become a Doctrine doctrine of the nickol
[3:39] adans remember me telling you that the
[3:41] other night how it approached to that
[3:43] deeds in Ephesus now it's a
[3:46] Doctrine uh the doctrine of the
[3:49] nickelation which things
[3:53] are
[3:56] hate repent or else I will come unto
[4:00] thee quickly and will fight against
[4:04] them not the real Church them with the
[4:08] sword of my
[4:11] mouth he that has an ear let him hear
[4:14] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[4:17] to him that overcometh will I give to
[4:19] eat of the Hidden
[4:22] mana and will give him him a white
[4:28] stone and in the the stone a new name
[4:31] written which no man knoweth sa in he
[4:35] that
[4:37] receiveth the Lord add His blessings to
[4:40] this am and help us now as we try
[4:43] Hallelujah now on the background of this
[4:46] church it's the third Church age
[4:50] called
[4:52] pergamus and
[4:55] the the date that this church existed
[4:58] was from 3 12 832 to
[5:03] 606 the age was false Doctrine Satan
[5:08] lying the foundation of papacy rule and
[5:13] marriage to church and state the reward
[5:19] was hidden Mana a white
[5:22] stone and the star the angel of this
[5:26] church by all that the Holy Spirit let
[5:30] me do I have picked St Martin amen it
[5:35] was the the Revelation giving me on it
[5:39] because reading of the other Saints
[5:41] during that time uh pick St Martin
[5:44] because that he was a Godly Man to my
[5:48] opinion he was 10 times more Apostle in
[5:52] St Patrick was now St Patrick was um St
[5:59] Martin's
[6:00] nephew uh St Martin's
[6:03] sister was a mother of St
[6:07] Patrick and uh St
[6:11] Martin uh was uh of course that was it
[6:15] St Patrick's Uncle now his life was from
[6:20] ad. 315 to
[6:23] 399 now here's the reason I picked him
[6:27] in preference to other Saints of that
[6:30] day because the way that
[6:34] he held himself and under the
[6:37] inspiration of God I do not believe that
[6:41] th the
[6:42] Catholic Church did not canonizing they
[6:46] did not recognize him that's another
[6:49] reason I
[6:50] picted amen and all these that were're
[6:53] seeing it's got this spiritual Ministry
[6:56] the early church turned down the the
[7:00] nickan church turned it down because of
[7:04] these things they were spiritual and as
[7:06] I've draw here the church was being
[7:08] squeezed out and the nickan doctrine was
[7:12] in the was in the majority and the true
[7:16] church was in the minority has always
[7:18] been and as I said from the beginning it
[7:20] was Jesus that said fear not little
[7:24] flock it's your father's Good Will to
[7:26] give you the kingdom that's why I apply
[7:29] the kingdom to a spiritual Kingdom and
[7:31] we are have a spiritual Kingdom and
[7:34] we're so happy all that and a king in
[7:37] this Kingdom remember he is the king of
[7:43] saints sainted ones he is their King who
[7:46] leads him the life of St Martin was is
[7:51] one of the greatest Miracle fill lives
[7:55] of anybody in the church ages from all
[7:59] all the way from St Paul out he was one
[8:02] of the most spiritual
[8:04] men he was one of his first
[8:08] Miracles was he was a soldier to begin
[8:13] with I believe and then one day he was
[8:17] coming by and there was someone uh a man
[8:21] laying cold and shivering and all the
[8:25] people that was willing or not willing
[8:27] but was able to help them in they
[8:29] passing by like the the priest the
[8:32] Levites did in the Good Samaritan but
[8:35] when St Martin come by realizing his
[8:38] duty as a Christian believer he had one
[8:40] coat of cloak over his shoulders he cut
[8:42] it in two with his sword and give half
[8:47] of it to the beggar he took the other
[8:49] half that night begin his career for
[8:53] Jesus Christ appeared to him in a vision
[8:55] wrapped in that same robe that he cut
[8:57] half in Two Hallelujah which fulfill the
[9:00] scripture in so much as you have done
[9:01] unto these you have did it unto me so
[9:04] take that for a lesson whatever you do
[9:07] to somebody you're doing it unto Christ
[9:11] am just remember are you let's say that
[9:14] together what you do to others you have
[9:19] done to
[9:20] Christ so no matter what he thinks about
[9:23] you it's what you think about him see
[9:27] amen that brings the blessing that was
[9:29] his first miracle and the beginning of
[9:32] his ministry there so much to it I I
[9:34] wouldn't have time because I want you
[9:36] back tomorrow night and every night so I
[9:39] don't want to keep you too long all
[9:41] right the next miracle that I chose to
[9:44] speak of tonight he was absolutely
[9:47] demolishing
[9:48] heathenism and he was firmly against the
[9:51] Church of Rome he absolutely disagreed
[9:56] with all all the first church of Rome's
[9:59] Bishops he they was getting whirly and
[10:02] uh so forth like that and he withstood
[10:04] them he certainly was against them
[10:07] that's a miracle that he even lived in
[10:10] them kind of times now but he was
[10:13] destroying a pagan uh Grove one day and
[10:17] tearing down a pagan
[10:18] Altar and there was a sacred tree
[10:21] standing by the Pagan Altar and he was
[10:24] cutting this tree down and many standing
[10:27] by was resenting it he said if I be a
[10:31] man of God tie me the way that tree is
[10:35] leaning and let the tree fall on me if I
[10:39] be a man of God if I'm not a man of God
[10:41] the tree will kill me if I am a man of
[10:44] God my God can twist that tree somewhere
[10:48] else quite a
[10:50] challenge so they started chopping on
[10:53] the tree and when the tree started to
[10:54] fall they switched around and killed a
[10:56] bunch of the spectators
[10:58] amen God Twisted it back up the
[11:01] hill a
[11:03] miracle oh all the time there was
[11:06] miracles in his meeting another miracle
[11:09] that I thought to speak of was a dead
[11:12] baby that he laid his body across and it
[11:15] raised back to life again after he had
[11:17] prayed for some time for this baby
[11:20] another one is outstanding to me was uh
[11:24] the
[11:25] emperor and U he was going to kill some
[11:28] of God's holy ghost filled
[11:31] people and of course he was uh uh the
[11:36] right hand of the of the bishop of the
[11:39] First Church of Rome at that time and he
[11:43] actually was a pope before he was called
[11:46] a pope his name is d m a s r and um he
[11:52] uh was putting all the Christians to
[11:55] death that he could get a hold of to put
[11:56] to death and
[11:59] and this emperor's wife of pagan and
[12:02] darkness over her own heart and when
[12:05] this
[12:06] Saed St Martin came
[12:09] to uh intercede his wife put him next to
[12:13] it that he would try to intercede for
[12:15] these Christians not to be killed of
[12:18] course when he finally got to him didn't
[12:19] do any good because he was just uh the
[12:22] rightand man to this Pope so he killed
[12:25] those holy girls still Christians anyhow
[12:28] but St Mark wanted to interview with him
[12:31] and the gods stopped him at the gate
[12:34] well St Martin fell on his face and laid
[12:37] there and prayed until God showed him to
[12:40] go in when he raised up off there he
[12:42] walked through them locked doors and
[12:44] they opened by themselves
[12:46] Hallelujah now this is
[12:49] history this is just not somebody
[12:52] writing about him and just as a little
[12:55] if anything there would be a Prejudice
[12:58] if it would be some Church talking or
[13:00] the I'd say at least especially the pap
[13:02] Church they wouldn't mention those
[13:04] things but see the history quotes the
[13:06] truth amen and this man walked right up
[13:10] St Martin in right by every guard
[13:13] everything else right into the front of
[13:15] the emperor and the emperor didn't want
[13:17] to respect God's servant you know that
[13:20] that's not that's not mannerly so he
[13:22] just turned his head and wouldn't even
[13:24] respect him you know what God did he
[13:27] tried to talk to him and he just kept
[13:28] his head turn God is going to make this
[13:31] Heathen pay respect to his servant so he
[13:34] just set the thing AAR and scorched him
[13:37] all out of his seat raised him
[13:41] up now that's Bible
[13:45] History not seeing counsel he had to
[13:48] respect God he made him stand up and he
[13:51] Scorch the seat where he was sitting
[13:53] power went through his body and scorched
[13:55] the bottom of the sea and he had to jump
[13:57] up from there
[13:59] God has way doing
[14:02] things God's able to these Stones
[14:04] through eyes children to Abraham
[14:06] remember that same God dwells among us
[14:11] tonight it's the same God all
[14:15] right and then another that I like and
[14:20] then I'll stop I got something here but
[14:22] I this is one I was very fond of while
[14:25] he was one day waiting for his people in
[14:28] prayer
[14:30] in his study room and he he was a great
[14:34] man and he carried this holy spirit
[14:38] filled church and tore us all all he was
[14:41] a had them all filled with the spirit
[14:44] all his congregation and all out
[14:46] throughout all the country that
[14:47] Christians did Miracles and signs and
[14:49] wonder see God speaks to his messenger
[14:53] the messenger speaks to the Ley and then
[14:57] that's what takes place you see he he
[14:59] keeps the Ley and him alike in God you
[15:03] see the Holy Spirit flowing through the
[15:05] group of them many times when they was
[15:07] Morty they stood the minister right out
[15:09] among them like that and killed them all
[15:11] at the same time and um what evils they
[15:14] did do to them people they burn them
[15:17] they tuck man and nail them with down to
[15:21] logs and turn wild dogs loose or and let
[15:24] them eat from the back of the person
[15:26] pulling their intestines through before
[15:28] the never died taking women would cut
[15:31] their right breast off and let them
[15:33] stand there as a heartbeat in his St
[15:35] till he pitched over dead like that take
[15:37] their children from a expected mothers
[15:39] and feed them to the Hogs and things let
[15:41] the mother stand watching and all kinds
[15:44] now you wouldn't think that people
[15:45] profess Christianity would do that but
[15:48] listen to the Bible said Jesus said
[15:50] it'll come to pass that they'll kill you
[15:53] thinking they're doing God a service you
[15:56] remember that same Jesus that said that
[15:58] through the same Spirit predicted it
[16:00] again in the end time it's got to come
[16:04] if these others hit just perfectly with
[16:06] this scripture watch and see if it
[16:07] doesn't coincides exactly through the
[16:10] scripture and through history God said
[16:12] it would happen here's the history said
[16:13] it did happen God said it happen here
[16:15] here where did happen see just exactly
[16:17] then what do we going to do when we get
[16:18] down to the lady oan Church age see
[16:21] where we're at now and the wars and
[16:23] things pronounced to get in so
[16:27] now then this he was in there praying
[16:30] while his congregation was waiting and
[16:32] there was a beggar come to the door and
[16:35] knocked at his door he opened the door
[16:37] and he was busy and he told him he
[16:40] wanted a a garment he was naked had
[16:43] nothing it was cold and he said he's
[16:46] sing around to see the chief Deacon and
[16:48] the chief Deacon was irritable with him
[16:51] and run him out and when it did it run
[16:53] around he come back again and told St
[16:56] Martin that um that the the Deacon had
[17:00] run him out and so then about that time
[17:03] this Chief Deacon come back in and told
[17:06] him kind sharply that your
[17:08] congregation's waiting on you you're
[17:09] keeping them waiting but he was in
[17:11] prayer it's better that he stay in
[17:13] prayer till he feels lead of God to go
[17:15] out and this beggar come back to the
[17:18] door and St Martin took off his own good
[17:22] garment give it to the beggar and had
[17:24] the the um the chief Deacon to go get
[17:28] another one and bring it to him so he
[17:30] had to get a garment anyhow and put it
[17:32] on St Martin and he wore the Lesser
[17:34] garment out before the people instead of
[17:38] his good garment see it just goes to
[17:41] show give the best that you have give
[17:45] your life give your time give everything
[17:48] to Christ and that same spirit that
[17:51] lived in Christ lives in you and and
[17:56] your influence in your neighborhood upon
[17:59] the people that you deal with will be so
[18:02] much like Christ to little work the same
[18:04] thing Christ did amen finally it will
[18:07] come to pass that the people laid in the
[18:09] shadows and was healed that that's right
[18:12] there so much power of love around them
[18:15] and they said that when St Martin was
[18:18] preaching after he come out this lesser

[54:24] around I've got a little this morning
[54:27] remember me our precious brother Dan
[54:30] Roberts was very low yesterday very low
[54:32] the doctor said we've never seen someone
[54:34] come from that low and be raised up but
[54:36] we don't know the Lord is full of power
[54:39] and likes to surprise the doctors and so
[54:41] we've been holding him up I don't have
[54:43] an update this morning does anybody know
[54:45] anything
[54:46] else no so we'll just hold up brother
[54:49] Daniel Roberts and the family in prayer
[54:51] um during these times our precious
[54:53] brother Bobby he's been in and out of
[54:55] the hospital for sometime he was in the
[54:57] hospital this week for a procedure and
[54:59] has decisions to make doctor's left
[55:02] shoulder so you're telling them
[55:04] different things to do and so just
[55:05] trying to get Unity there and find the
[55:07] mind of the Lord for his healing if
[55:09] that's through a doctor if that's
[55:10] through antibiotics if that's a miracle
[55:12] we're believing with our brother for a
[55:14] miracle this morning so we don't see him
[55:16] here today he was supposed to go home
[55:19] yesterday I don't know if he's gone home
[55:20] does anybody so just remember brother
[55:23] Bobby f figuroa um brother Bob sister C
[55:26] and the the children
[55:28] there I don't have to remind you what
[55:30] I'm going to you know I get nervous on
[55:33] my job and and brother R talks about
[55:35] nervousness being a big thing and I just
[55:38] got a work that is going to burn at the
[55:40] end but our pastor has an eternal job
[55:44] and so we certainly want to remember him
[55:46] because just think of the pressures you
[55:48] face at work and that's just temporal
[55:51] things that we're worried about building
[55:53] and serving and doing but this is
[55:55] eternal service and he wants to get it
[55:57] right and so we hold up our precious
[55:59] Pastor when the pastor's called the
[56:01] family is called the the devil would
[56:03] just try to harm anything that he could
[56:05] get in any way so remember them but
[56:07] especially the pastor to have the
[56:08] anointing he always has it I always feel
[56:11] like sometimes I go home and he's been
[56:12] listening to my life because he's just
[56:14] hitting right where hitting home so
[56:16] remember our pastor he'll just be led as
[56:18] he always is with the Lord to direct the
[56:20] church everybody say Amen awesome and
[56:23] then uh his family and of course the
[56:26] board and and each each part of the body
[56:28] you might just feel you're a little dorm
[56:30] out but God needs the fingernail and all
[56:33] the parts just like he needs the big
[56:34] brain so we need you we need one another
[56:36] we lean on one another and we hold up
[56:38] our pastor and each one is there
[56:40] something else that should be mentioned
[56:42] out loud before the saints that I've

[1:07:01] this is King David's uh Psalm after he
[1:07:05] had fallen into
[1:07:07] sin and the prophet Nathan came to him
[1:07:11] he committed a great sin very a bad sin
[1:07:15] that he committed and when he came back
[1:07:17] to the Lord the
[1:07:20] song The Psalm was born out of his
[1:07:24] failure
[1:07:26] his failure but then his ultimate um
[1:07:29] Triumph because the Lord got a hold of
[1:07:32] him and turned him back and this is the
[1:07:35] PSAL have mercy I'll read the first
[1:07:38] verse and you can read the second verse

[1:10:18] offer Bullocks upon thine Altar and go
[1:10:22] back to one more verse here in verse
[1:10:24] number seven says Purge me with
[1:10:30] hup and I shall be clean wash me and I
[1:10:35] shall be whiter than snow amen we'll
[1:10:38] take one more scripture in second
[1:10:40] Timothy chapter two
[1:11:01] and
[1:11:02] verse
[1:11:03] number
[1:11:05] 19
[1:11:07] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:11:09] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[1:11:14] knoweth them that are his and let
[1:11:16] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[1:11:18] depart from
[1:11:20] iniquity but in the great house there
[1:11:22] are not only vessels of gold and of
[1:11:26] silver but also of wood and of Earth
[1:11:30] some to honor and some to dishonor if a
[1:11:33] man therefore Purge himself from these
[1:11:37] he shall be a vessel unto honor
[1:11:40] Sanctified in meat for the Master's Ed
[1:11:44] and prepared unto every good work amen
[1:11:50] may God add a blessing to the reading of
[1:11:51] his word just for a title this morning
[1:11:54] we'll call this is the Great Purge the
[1:11:57] Great Purge of course we know purge
[1:12:00] means to clean or to be made clean and
[1:12:05] this is necessary for any plant to grow
[1:12:08] for any individual to grow you need to
[1:12:11] be purged Purge me Lord and this is the
[1:12:15] Great Purge so God bless you you may be
[1:12:21] seated now this uh little message here
[1:12:26] it's come upon my heart as I've been
[1:12:28] going through the great uh subject of
[1:12:32] standing like Joshua and Caleb and how
[1:12:35] successful Joshua's Ministry was and if
[1:12:39] we were to use an example General you'd
[1:12:43] have to take Joshua as the greatest
[1:12:47] General biblically speaking and brother
[1:12:50] Ram even talks about how great of a
[1:12:54] general he was was he didn't lose any
[1:12:58] battles because of his faith the only
[1:13:02] weaknesses in Joshua's Ministry was
[1:13:06] someone got out of line and they HD a
[1:13:08] sin and it caused men to fail brother
[1:13:12] Brandon brings that out that we all can
[1:13:16] cause failure if one of us is out of
[1:13:20] line it actually hurts
[1:13:22] others and this Great
[1:13:26] Purge had to take place before the
[1:13:29] children of Israel went into the
[1:13:31] promised land you had the group of men
[1:13:35] that had grown
[1:13:36] cynical they got accustomed to seeing
[1:13:39] the Miracles of Moses and so they felt
[1:13:43] very comfortable with complaining with
[1:13:46] him even to the point they wanted to
[1:13:49] pick up stones and stone him who bought
[1:13:53] their freedom they would not be where
[1:13:56] they were without Moses there is no way
[1:13:59] there's no plan of getting through
[1:14:02] anybody's Wilderness let alone the great
[1:14:06] desert that they were supposed to travel
[1:14:09] through without Moses so what happened
[1:14:12] in the relationship where now we want to
[1:14:14] Stone the man that brought us here so
[1:14:18] they grown cynical their attitude had
[1:14:22] grown they become Rusty and
[1:14:26] well um acquainted with doing things
[1:14:29] that were wrong and then the Lord
[1:14:31] correcting them okay Lord we're sorry
[1:14:34] and we'll come back and do it again and
[1:14:36] then the Lord would correct them then
[1:14:37] they come back again it was just this
[1:14:40] habitual a Crim spree and so they um the
[1:14:47] Lord had to deal with that and so in
[1:14:50] dealing with it he caused a great
[1:14:53] separation and after this great
[1:14:55] separation now Joshua starts with a
[1:14:58] fresh group of young men not just young
[1:15:03] men now he had Elders with him too
[1:15:06] because not all the elders fell into
[1:15:08] that sin but it was those that murmured
[1:15:11] from 20 years old and upward the Lord
[1:15:14] said I'm done with them I will not let
[1:15:17] them enter into the promised land so the
[1:15:20] Lord um let them go through the years of
[1:15:25] dying off and we call that a purging or
[1:15:28] a cleansing of the old thinking patterns
[1:15:33] the old you know calloused heart the old
[1:15:37] yeah I've been here before I saw it
[1:15:38] before that kind of attitude brother vam
[1:15:41] entitled he calls them the old Fighters
[1:15:44] had to die before we go forward and do
[1:15:47] things we had never done before and I
[1:15:50] like to say you know the biblical
[1:15:52] accounts that you read in the Bible the
[1:15:54] Old test
[1:15:56] stories they really begin to work when
[1:15:59] it becomes your story when the biblical
[1:16:03] account you can now reflect that in your
[1:16:05] own life there's some old areas that
[1:16:08] need to die out in every one of us and
[1:16:12] our way of thinking our way of
[1:16:14] approaching things is not fresh it's not
[1:16:17] new I remember I went to go see my daddy
[1:16:19] when he was passing away there at the
[1:16:21] hospital there in Sacramento and he was
[1:16:24] on his last you know few uh uh days
[1:16:28] there and we didn't fully know that but
[1:16:31] he fully expected to come back home he
[1:16:33] wanted to go back home he was upset with
[1:16:35] everybody he was mad he wanted to go
[1:16:37] back home but he couldn't take care of
[1:16:39] himself the will to live was just still
[1:16:41] there but I remember going to the
[1:16:44] hospital room and in that emergency room
[1:16:47] oh my goodness it was full of hurting
[1:16:51] people and this person was moaning over
[1:16:53] here in the corner that one had some
[1:16:55] kind of pain and my heart was just like
[1:16:58] oh man all these hurt hurt people and I
[1:17:01] look behind the counter and the nurses
[1:17:03] they were just having a great time
[1:17:05] laughing joking they were teasing one
[1:17:08] another and I'm because they see it
[1:17:11] every day and and and they have to I
[1:17:16] mean you can't embrace all the tragedy
[1:17:19] because then you wouldn't be helpful to
[1:17:21] other people so there needs to be a
[1:17:23] little you know got to be able to ignore
[1:17:27] some of the things that you see but me
[1:17:29] coming in there I was just shocked at
[1:17:31] all of the pain and all of the trauma
[1:17:33] taking place there but what we don't
[1:17:36] want to do we don't want to have that
[1:17:38] approach towards
[1:17:40] God where yeah Lord I heard that before
[1:17:44] yeah this is your word yeah it's just a
[1:17:47] scripture it's just a tape it's just
[1:17:48] Sunday morning you know if that's your
[1:17:51] attitude you need to ask God to help you
[1:17:55] that it stays fresh every day every
[1:18:01] morning his
[1:18:03] mercies are
[1:18:05] new and I need every one of them I need
[1:18:09] all the mercy I can get every morning
[1:18:14] yes sir we ought to be grateful and
[1:18:16] thankful that his
[1:18:18] mercies are new and they never fail
[1:18:23] they're there for your benefit they're
[1:18:27] there to help you they're there to
[1:18:30] strengthen and you need every drop of
[1:18:33] his Mercy every moment of your life how
[1:18:38] many know what I'm talking about yes his
[1:18:40] mercies are new every morning I don't
[1:18:42] want to grow cynical over that I don't
[1:18:45] want to get that to make that an old uh
[1:18:47] testimony over that so this purge had to
[1:18:51] take place Israel had to be cleanse that
[1:18:55] Kadesh Baria so they can go forward and
[1:18:58] now it was hurtful it's a lot of people
[1:19:01] died it's a lot of harsh you know
[1:19:04] relationships had to be cut off and
[1:19:07] severed but now we can
[1:19:11] grow sometimes growth happens through
[1:19:14] cutting
[1:19:16] away sometimes the best growth is when
[1:19:19] you lose
[1:19:21] something and sometimes the Lord needs
[1:19:24] wants growth out of you so he's
[1:19:27] demanding more out of you amen and
[1:19:31] through the scriptures our lord Jesus
[1:19:34] had to deal with growth that was carnal
[1:19:39] but then he wanted growth that was
[1:19:42] spiritual and there's a carnal growth
[1:19:45] that you can grow in your profession you
[1:19:48] can grow in your finances you can grow
[1:19:51] in your health you can grow on every
[1:19:54] every human level that we all want to
[1:19:57] grow in as human beings but
[1:20:00] spiritually am I growing
[1:20:04] spiritually is that the growth that the
[1:20:07] church needs the church needs a
[1:20:12] purging needs a
[1:20:14] cleansing
[1:20:16] now David explains it very well in this
[1:20:19] scripture I like uh Second Timothy
[1:20:21] Chapter 2 because if you take the
[1:20:24] beginning part of that chapter I won't
[1:20:27] take time to get into it uh this morning
[1:20:29] but he uh uses the example of a soldier
[1:20:34] he uses the example of a one that
[1:20:37] strives and that Greek word is a athlete
[1:20:41] he that striveth so he's using the
[1:20:43] example of a soldier an athlete and a
[1:20:46] farmer he uses those three
[1:20:49] examples and of those three examples you
[1:20:52] know correction is a must failure is not
[1:20:56] you can't go into any match any fighting
[1:21:01] any type of farming thinking of being a
[1:21:06] failure uh God doesn't have any
[1:21:09] failures God is a winner and how many
[1:21:14] times does he win all the time he's
[1:21:18] never lost a battle he doesn't know what
[1:21:20] he's
[1:21:22] undefeated yes yes the god that we our
[1:21:27] founder is
[1:21:30] undefeated and he called you to be a
[1:21:35] part of his army amen I I believe I
[1:21:38] believe I'm on a winning team this
[1:21:41] morning I believe we've already
[1:21:44] won and he called me to part be a part
[1:21:47] of it this great Army he's undefeated he
[1:21:51] doesn't lose and there's no place for
[1:21:53] failure now this this um Great Purge has
[1:22:00] to take place I want to read a prayer
[1:22:02] just before it's in the message
[1:22:06] 1965
[1:22:08] um April the 10th 1965 paragraph number
[1:22:12] 18 I don't think I have it written down
[1:22:15] here and I forgot to put the title but
[1:22:18] if you can snatch that up for me real
[1:22:20] quick sis in the back I would be very
[1:22:23] grateful yes paragraph 18 this is in the
[1:22:27] message um can't really see it the
[1:22:30] Easter seal says allmighty God the
[1:22:33] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:22:36] raised him from the dead and has given
[1:22:39] him unto us the
[1:22:42] sacrifice and a go back and has given
[1:22:46] him unto us as the
[1:22:49] sacrifice and a lord and savior we are
[1:22:53] so grateful to thee for this privilege
[1:22:56] that we have this morning to stand in
[1:23:00] thy presence with thy people that's been
[1:23:03] redeemed and looking for his glorious
[1:23:06] second coming to receive us unto himself
[1:23:10] if there be sin Among Us Lord Purge us
[1:23:15] with thy hisp and we pray heavenly
[1:23:18] father that you will heal every sick
[1:23:21] person's that's in our m is what a
[1:23:26] prayer what a desire Lord Purge
[1:23:31] me um this Great Purge had to happen
[1:23:35] with the church coming through the
[1:23:37] Wilderness in order for Joshua to be
[1:23:39] successful it had to happen in Jesus's
[1:23:42] Ministry for Jesus to be successful has
[1:23:45] got to happen to the church today in
[1:23:47] order for the church to be successful
[1:23:51] has got to happen to the Believers today
[1:23:53] in order for the believer to be
[1:23:55] successful can I get a witness now how
[1:23:58] many know we all need a
[1:24:00] purging the purge actually cleanses us
[1:24:05] it takes away the dead
[1:24:07] weight weight things that we don't need
[1:24:10] in our life Hebrews 12 or Hebrews 10
[1:24:13] says lay aside every sin that does so
[1:24:18] easily beset us Lord get rid of the Dead
[1:24:22] weight and that comes in the form of
[1:24:25] Correction doesn't it how many know they
[1:24:27] need to be
[1:24:29] corrected can I see about a witness of
[1:24:32] your hand being raised or at least raise
[1:24:34] your
[1:24:35] eyebrow Lord I need to be
[1:24:38] corrected oh oh yes we could that sounds
[1:24:43] very nice to say oh I everybody needs to
[1:24:45] be corrected I need to be corrected but
[1:24:47] when it happens how does it
[1:24:50] feel you know if I somebody said ouch
[1:24:54] praise the
[1:24:55] Lord you know we say Amen more times
[1:24:58] when we really saying
[1:25:00] ouch but Lord hit me one more time I
[1:25:04] need it in my life and this message will
[1:25:09] find out where you're moving where you
[1:25:12] shouldn't move the word of the Lord will
[1:25:15] find out where you're living where you
[1:25:17] shouldn't live your faith is being
[1:25:19] corrupted the word will find that out
[1:25:22] and so how does that correction happen
[1:25:24] happen if I'm the pastor of the church
[1:25:27] or the coach of the team or the head of
[1:25:30] a military post of command you know how
[1:25:33] does that correction happen you know at
[1:25:35] home correction might happen physically
[1:25:39] but if I was going to correct any of you
[1:25:40] all today that would be
[1:25:44] verbally but how many can say we all
[1:25:46] still need
[1:25:48] correction all right so I'm going to
[1:25:50] correct the organist this morning who
[1:25:54] played the organ this morning all right
[1:25:57] perfect
[1:25:59] example stand up organist or organ
[1:26:03] player you did a horrible job this
[1:26:06] morning you didn't practice your cords
[1:26:09] and your keys like you should have you
[1:26:11] was not prepared and don't let it happen
[1:26:14] again do you
[1:26:18] understand we're all not the organists
[1:26:21] this morning so we can gladly say oh
[1:26:23] yeah it's fine now if I pick any of you
[1:26:25] out and and open like the Bible says
[1:26:28] correct them openly that others will
[1:26:30] fear can you receive correction this
[1:26:33] morning of verbal slashing or
[1:26:37] or or
[1:26:41] not so Lord Purge me with hisp I'll tell
[1:26:47] you what the word says if you can't
[1:26:49] receive it what kind of child are
[1:26:52] you huh H you're a bastard
[1:26:56] child if the temper tantrum takes off
[1:26:59] how could he embarrass me like that in
[1:27:02] front of all those people you needed
[1:27:09] it not me I didn't need it you just said
[1:27:12] you needed correction no no no if if
[1:27:15] it's going to be correction it's got to
[1:27:16] be an old 90y old man to correct
[1:27:21] me you don't get to pick
[1:27:25] huh
[1:27:28] huh Lord help
[1:27:30] us to be
[1:27:32] willing to receive
[1:27:35] correction like you embarrass me in
[1:27:38] front of the entire board call me on the
[1:27:42] carpet who does he think he is who does
[1:27:45] she think she
[1:27:48] is you know this is needed and we need
[1:27:51] to get our hearts in tune on who's doing
[1:27:55] the correcting and then we will receive
[1:27:57] it from the father this is the problem
[1:28:02] this is the reason why there's too much
[1:28:06] parasite
[1:28:08] parasitical
[1:28:09] Behavior Uh cankerous conversations and
[1:28:13] things that develop it's infectious and
[1:28:17] it spreads because the parasites have to
[1:28:21] be dealt with it happens on the great
[1:28:23] plants good plants it happens in every
[1:28:26] walk and Jesus had to deal with this now
[1:28:29] the prophet of God takes St John chapter
[1:28:33] 6 where Jesus boldly makes the
[1:28:36] proclamation except you eat my flesh and
[1:28:39] drink my blood you have no life in
[1:28:44] you and then he makes the statement
[1:28:48] that he never explained
[1:28:52] it I mean he made a
[1:28:55] statement that his disciples and true
[1:28:58] followers couldn't
[1:29:01] understand and he did not explain
[1:29:04] himself he just left it out there and
[1:29:07] then he kept on saying hard say to what
[1:29:12] brother random called to shake off the
[1:29:16] parasites he had to shake it shake it
[1:29:19] off of them he looked out at the crowd
[1:29:22] he said the crowd was too
[1:29:24] large so he need to cut the crowd back
[1:29:28] and find out who the real Believers
[1:29:32] are and how did he do that he did that
[1:29:35] by preaching on things that were not
[1:29:38] convenient a little harsh no
[1:29:43] explanation I mean you're going to bring
[1:29:45] a subject up like that at least give an
[1:29:47] explanation he didn't give one what was
[1:29:50] he doing he was shaking their faith he
[1:29:53] was trying in them and he still does it
[1:29:56] today he tries the believer every son
[1:30:01] gets
[1:30:02] tested every daughter gets tested and
[1:30:07] child trained to see where their faith
[1:30:11] is Joshua and Caleb saw the same
[1:30:15] obstacles that the rest of them saw but
[1:30:18] look what did they say they took a stand
[1:30:20] on God's word didn't
[1:30:22] they and so do you and I we see the same
[1:30:25] thing we have the same Temptations our
[1:30:28] jobs and the atmospheres out there we
[1:30:30] all see the ugliness going on but who is
[1:30:34] going to stay on the Lord's
[1:30:37] Side okay now what would you prefer
[1:30:41] what's better for you a fake friend or a
[1:30:43] real
[1:30:44] enemy think about that what would you
[1:30:46] prefer to deal with a fake friend or a
[1:30:49] real
[1:30:51] enemy I prefer to deal with a real
[1:30:54] enemy because I know what I'm dealing
[1:30:57] with but Israel had a lot of mixed a
[1:31:01] mixed multitude unbelievers there that
[1:31:03] were sprinkled in there now brother
[1:31:06] grham makes this statement about the
[1:31:08] gifts of the Spirit and the world is
[1:31:10] falling apart paragraph 147 he says we
[1:31:13] wonder today why the gifts and things
[1:31:16] are not in the church operating the way
[1:31:19] they should be why the gifts are put in
[1:31:23] the in put put in the church to separate
[1:31:26] and take sin out to keep the church
[1:31:31] clean it's God's toxin that's given to
[1:31:34] the church it's God's also his
[1:31:38] disinfect that he puts into the church
[1:31:41] to kill out all the
[1:31:44] parasites that tear up the church and
[1:31:47] God sprays his church over with his word
[1:31:51] and that keeps all the termite out you
[1:31:54] know so the church can
[1:31:58] grow a plant and God knows what it takes
[1:32:02] to do it well you say it's just like a
[1:32:06] baby crying for your razor when you're
[1:32:10] shaving your little baby was hollering
[1:32:12] give me that razor Daddy give me that
[1:32:14] razor your little son two or three years
[1:32:16] old just scream jumping up and down on
[1:32:20] the floor give the razor well you know
[1:32:23] better than to do that you wouldn't give
[1:32:26] that baby that razor he doesn't know how
[1:32:29] to handle it and that's the reason we
[1:32:31] don't find no more Divine gifts than
[1:32:35] what we do they push it off on some kind
[1:32:37] of tradition over in some denomination
[1:32:40] they don't know how to handle it God
[1:32:43] knows what to do with it so you know who
[1:32:48] who who wants the gifts of the Spirit in
[1:32:49] their Church sure who wants the gifts of
[1:32:52] God a Godly gift in your life manifested
[1:32:55] sure but if you can't handle it you'll
[1:32:58] do more harm than
[1:33:00] good and some of us can't even handle
[1:33:05] just a little
[1:33:07] verbal slashing or
[1:33:09] lashing we can't handle a little Flex
[1:33:13] against someone said whatever they said
[1:33:15] about you or about your daughter or
[1:33:18] about your son and you can't even praise
[1:33:20] the Lord no more someone bumped up
[1:33:23] against you you just bumped you in one
[1:33:26] way or the other one carnal way or the
[1:33:28] other roll their eyes at you and then
[1:33:31] you roll your eyes back at them but Lord
[1:33:34] give me a
[1:33:35] gift Lord send the anointing upon me so
[1:33:38] you can use me you know what um he's not
[1:33:41] going to give that he can't give that if
[1:33:44] you're not ready for it so what he'll do
[1:33:47] he'll prepare the church and get them
[1:33:49] ready so he can use them and whatever it
[1:33:53] takes Lord
[1:33:54] whatever it takes to get me in the place
[1:33:56] where I need to be that's what I want
[1:34:01] that's what the True Believer
[1:34:03] desires and I believe this Great Purge
[1:34:06] is taking place now we know there'll be
[1:34:09] a great Purge in the Great Tribulation
[1:34:11] we know that the the foolish virgin is
[1:34:14] purged through the things that she
[1:34:16] suffers and tries and and that she'll go
[1:34:18] through the fire of great and horrible
[1:34:21] persecution and even the church to today
[1:34:24] is being persecuted on many many levels
[1:34:27] that's really honing our faith in to
[1:34:30] what is really important what if God
[1:34:33] would send a purging process to you this
[1:34:37] morning could you take it well if you're
[1:34:40] a True Believer you could and this um
[1:34:45] operation of the gifts the prophet
[1:34:47] brings it that you know the baby's not
[1:34:49] ready for it he goes forward he talks
[1:34:53] about how in in Jesus's Ministry this is
[1:34:57] in the message God is identified by his
[1:35:00] characteristics and he says this
[1:35:04] here paragraph 115 he says before
[1:35:07] Abraham was I am see they didn't
[1:35:10] understand it he was shaking them
[1:35:12] parasites off of him today we have to
[1:35:16] beg and plead and Pat and beg and
[1:35:20] persuade and promise and Christians to
[1:35:22] come to church if they come to church
[1:35:25] we'll do so and so Jesus when he was on
[1:35:28] Earth he had too many with him he looked
[1:35:31] around and seen the congregation he
[1:35:33] wanted to get rid of them he said except
[1:35:36] you eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:35:39] drink his blood you have no life in you
[1:35:42] could you imagine a doctor sitting there
[1:35:45] this man wants to make uh us to be a
[1:35:47] human vampire drink his blood nonsense
[1:35:51] all you people walk away and leave that
[1:35:52] crazy man alone alone they walked away
[1:35:56] he never explained
[1:35:59] it he didn't have to explain it he
[1:36:03] shakes your faith
[1:36:06] sometime to see what you'll do and he's
[1:36:10] doing the same thing in this day yes let
[1:36:14] it seem spooky to you a little bit to
[1:36:16] see where you stand whether you really
[1:36:21] believe amen
[1:36:24] how many know he shakes our faith today
[1:36:28] too yes he shakes our faith he makes you
[1:36:33] question makes you wonder what does that
[1:36:36] mean what's that statement mean there's
[1:36:39] places all throughout the Bible the
[1:36:41] scriptures we've been talking a little
[1:36:43] bit about marriage and divorce and
[1:36:45] there's more questions even still
[1:36:47] surrounding
[1:36:49] it and all those questions have not been
[1:36:52] answered to every detail tell but the
[1:36:54] True Believer stays with the original
[1:36:58] word Giver the original source of life
[1:37:02] that is Christ the word that's this word
[1:37:05] that's coming our day we stay with it
[1:37:07] even though we don't have all of the
[1:37:10] explanations so as a gospel preacher we
[1:37:14] proclaim the good news that doesn't
[1:37:17] necessarily mean that we explain the
[1:37:20] good news we're not explainers we're
[1:37:23] Proclaim ERS we're here to say what the
[1:37:26] word already said we go into the word
[1:37:29] and find out what is said and we say the
[1:37:31] same thing but then now explain it we
[1:37:35] can't we don't we we can't explain it
[1:37:37] all it's not given Jesus did not have to
[1:37:40] explain himself he could have but he
[1:37:44] chose not to why he was shaking off the
[1:37:49] parasites he was letting something
[1:37:52] develop he was trying to show them who
[1:37:55] they really are Lord we love you so much
[1:37:58] whatever you say we're with you to the
[1:38:00] end oh it feels so good to see this lame
[1:38:02] man healed oh you brought my mom in
[1:38:06] she's not on crutch us anymore you
[1:38:07] healed her of her cancer oh we're with
[1:38:09] you to the end Lord Jesus until he
[1:38:13] starts making these statements and he
[1:38:15] starts making these statements we re it
[1:38:18] reveals that they really had a problem
[1:38:21] because he wouldn't explain himself
[1:38:24] now he still does it today now praise
[1:38:28] the Lord so
[1:38:31] he makes statements that he doesn't
[1:38:34] explain all the time he never explained
[1:38:36] it what was he doing shaking off the
[1:38:38] parasites in the message influence 1964
[1:38:42] he makes this statement
[1:38:44] here paragraph uh 166 I wonder 165 so
[1:38:50] then he sent the great congregation
[1:38:54] he seen the great congregations he said
[1:38:56] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:38:58] man drink his blood you have no life in
[1:39:01] you he never explained it I wonder if he
[1:39:04] would say that in bont today no matter
[1:39:08] how popular he was what do you think
[1:39:11] doctors and cultured people and
[1:39:13] scientists would say the man is a
[1:39:16] vampire he wants you to drink his blood
[1:39:18] well what kind of a you are going off on
[1:39:22] a tantrum Jes Jesus never explained it
[1:39:27] he wanted to shake them parasites off of
[1:39:29] him that's right then they all got up
[1:39:32] and left then he looked around to those
[1:39:35] Apostles which was not which was not
[1:39:38] ordained to life but he had chosen them
[1:39:41] they wasn't ordained he says what will
[1:39:43] will you say when you see the son of man
[1:39:46] ascending up into heaven from whence he
[1:39:47] come oh that was a choker what did he
[1:39:51] then Minister says ascend into heaven
[1:39:55] well this man was born right here in
[1:39:57] galileia he was born in Nazareth we know
[1:40:00] his mother his brothers we know the
[1:40:02] Cradle he was rocked in we seen his baby
[1:40:06] clothes he speak to his mother and then
[1:40:09] say this man come and go back up where
[1:40:12] he come from he come from
[1:40:15] Nazareth what does he say heaven he
[1:40:19] never explained
[1:40:20] it too many parasites yet
[1:40:24] they got up they walk with him no more
[1:40:27] that's what the Bible said then he
[1:40:30] turned around and says you all want to
[1:40:32] go too to the 12 remember they couldn't
[1:40:35] explain it but they knowed it they
[1:40:38] knowed he was so they said to him he had
[1:40:42] influenced them by his Vindicated signs
[1:40:45] from God Amen he does the same thing
[1:40:49] today you know there's some areas in the
[1:40:52] message I don't speak on them all the
[1:40:55] time I'm going to a little bit more as I
[1:40:57] feel to but I know there's some areas in
[1:40:59] the message that are hot topics or hot
[1:41:01] spots for some of you all or some of the
[1:41:05] listeners but they're in the
[1:41:08] word and what interests what interests
[1:41:11] me is like why is everybody so
[1:41:15] up they get themselves all in the bind
[1:41:19] over some of these statements when
[1:41:21] they're actually on the tape
[1:41:24] surrounding the third pool you talk
[1:41:26] start talking about the third
[1:41:28] pool my brother Chuck is like who okay
[1:41:33] wait wait wait where you going with this
[1:41:35] well let me just quote the
[1:41:37] scriptures let me quote the
[1:41:40] prophet I was talking with some
[1:41:42] ministers one time and you know and and
[1:41:45] you know that this one of these subjects
[1:41:47] came up and I and I asked a few of the
[1:41:50] brothers there I said you know what's
[1:41:52] interesting to me if I get up and I
[1:41:55] preach about how the word is in the
[1:41:57] bride and the bride and the ministry
[1:42:00] today has all of the signs and wonders
[1:42:03] with them and Christ is with this this
[1:42:06] ministry today nobody has a problem
[1:42:09] always say amen and I say the same thing
[1:42:11] and imply it over to the prophet in his
[1:42:14] message and like whoa where you going
[1:42:16] with
[1:42:17] that and I I'm that makes me want to dig
[1:42:21] into it more because
[1:42:23] because the eagle can fly as high as he
[1:42:25] needs to it's in the word we fly with it
[1:42:30] amen there is no quote that makes me
[1:42:33] back up there's a quotes I embrace
[1:42:36] those now I back up with men's ideas all
[1:42:39] the time but you start reading them
[1:42:41] quotes it don't bother me one bit all of
[1:42:45] them they're beautiful to me I love
[1:42:48] them but you know Jesus made statements
[1:42:52] and this message has statements in it
[1:42:55] that throws people
[1:42:58] off and there's statements that are made
[1:43:01] without an
[1:43:03] explanation could you imagine Abraham
[1:43:07] trying to
[1:43:09] explain how he's going to have a baby
[1:43:12] with grandmother and himself they don't
[1:43:16] have any children there is no evidence
[1:43:18] of them ever going to have any children
[1:43:20] but the Lord puts that burden on on him
[1:43:23] to say that he's going to have a child
[1:43:27] anyway it was
[1:43:29] impossible but when the angel came to
[1:43:32] her that afternoon came to that home
[1:43:35] that afternoon the angel said is there
[1:43:38] anything too hard for the
[1:43:42] Lord don't tell me what you haven't
[1:43:45] never seen before don't tell me it's
[1:43:47] never happened before is there anything
[1:43:50] too hard for the Lord
[1:43:53] is there a problem he can't solve a
[1:43:56] sickness he can't heal a a situation he
[1:44:00] can't
[1:44:01] solve there is nothing too hard for our
[1:44:06] God Amen there is nothing too hard The
[1:44:11] Impossible is possible with the god that
[1:44:14] we
[1:44:16] serve but he throws things out there
[1:44:18] that is in inexplicable there's no
[1:44:21] explanation for it and does that on
[1:44:23] purpose the prophet is showing us that
[1:44:26] he does this to throw off the parasites
[1:44:30] he calls them he gives this example with
[1:44:34] Father
[1:44:35] Abraham and he says that Abraham after
[1:44:38] he shook off the parasite
[1:44:42] lot he called lot a
[1:44:46] parasite
[1:44:48] parasites sometimes are people
[1:44:54] negative negative
[1:44:57] negative every time you see them they
[1:44:59] ain't got nothing positive to say just
[1:45:03] hanging around looking for opportunity
[1:45:07] see I told you I knew it wasn't going to
[1:45:09] work I told you you should have kicked
[1:45:12] out I told you you should have quit I
[1:45:14] knew it wasn't going to work all of this
[1:45:17] negativity and that's a spirit now
[1:45:20] that's a spirit that gets on people you
[1:45:22] know that's not the Ministry of our of
[1:45:24] our Lord Jesus that's not the ministry
[1:45:26] of the Holy Spirit the ministry of the
[1:45:29] holy spirit is
[1:45:31] positive it's the word of the Lord is
[1:45:33] Raising you up into something that's
[1:45:36] great that's postive the negativity no
[1:45:40] that's not God that's Satan's
[1:45:44] language I'm not much of a Believer I I
[1:45:46] cannot have any faith you know those
[1:45:49] statements are appropriate if you finish
[1:45:51] it off properly Lord I'm not much of a
[1:45:54] Believer I haven't done what I was
[1:45:56] supposed to do I'm ashamed but today I
[1:46:00] claim your blood and I know you'll make
[1:46:03] a way for me to come up out of my
[1:46:07] condition
[1:46:09] yes we know you're a failure but through
[1:46:13] Christ he answers the failure questions
[1:46:16] for
[1:46:18] you you don't leave it on the negative
[1:46:20] you bring it right on through Christ is
[1:46:23] the propitiation for our sins for our
[1:46:27] weaknesses for our
[1:46:29] troubles
[1:46:30] absolutely so what does he do he allows
[1:46:34] the
[1:46:35] parasites to be shook off of you some of
[1:46:39] us all of us need some of this unbelief
[1:46:42] shaken off of us Jesus is dealing with
[1:46:46] it here in calling Jesus on the scene
[1:46:48] and he says this
[1:46:50] here paragraph 88 bunch of unbeliever
[1:46:52] Bel vers Jesus wanted to shake off a
[1:46:56] bunch of parasites one day he had too
[1:47:00] many following him he had his
[1:47:04] disciples then he had the 70 the
[1:47:07] ministerial Assan then he had a
[1:47:09] congregation by the thousands then he
[1:47:12] made this statement he said except you
[1:47:14] eat the blood eat the Flesh of the son
[1:47:16] of man and drink his blood you have no
[1:47:18] life in you now what do you think a
[1:47:20] medical doctor would say say heading out
[1:47:23] in the congregation what do you think a
[1:47:25] sensible thinking man would what would
[1:47:27] he call Sensible thinking he never
[1:47:31] explained it he didn't have to explain
[1:47:34] it why the doctor would say get away
[1:47:37] from that fellow he's
[1:47:40] crazy will be human vampires drinking
[1:47:43] the blood of the man eating his flesh in
[1:47:46] the congregation I imagine the priest
[1:47:48] said this is the time here is where we
[1:47:51] come in out we we go we'll never attend
[1:47:55] another one of the meetings away they
[1:47:58] went then he got all of them away from
[1:48:00] him he turned around he said to the 70
[1:48:03] he says what will you say when you see
[1:48:04] the son of man ascending up into heaven
[1:48:07] from whence he
[1:48:08] come now the 70 said the son of man
[1:48:11] ascending up from whence he come why he
[1:48:15] has had us at the very we he has had us
[1:48:19] at the very manger where he was born we
[1:48:22] know his mother we seen the clothes the
[1:48:25] swaddling cloth he was wrapped in he was
[1:48:28] born down there in Bethlehem of Judea he
[1:48:32] was brought up over here in Nazareth
[1:48:35] there is his brothers his sisters and
[1:48:37] all of them with us then he said this
[1:48:39] son of man ascended up now he didn't
[1:48:43] explain it he just said it now they
[1:48:46] couldn't explain it they couldn't fix it
[1:48:49] out in their mind
[1:48:52] this is what they're trying to do
[1:48:54] they're trying to make it make sense in
[1:48:57] their mind a lot of intellectual
[1:49:00] preaching does the same thing they try
[1:49:03] to take all the loose ends of the
[1:49:04] prophet and make all the Loose Ends
[1:49:06] match as if you are a prophet oh the
[1:49:10] prophet didn't match it up then leave it
[1:49:12] the way it is he left some statements
[1:49:15] just hanging out just like that and when
[1:49:17] as a gospel preacher you have to have
[1:49:19] the discipline to just to say it just
[1:49:21] like he said it
[1:49:24] amen de brothers that's irresponsible to
[1:49:27] make a statement and not back it up and
[1:49:29] not bring an explanation I am not an
[1:49:31] explainer I'm a
[1:49:33] proclaimer i Proclaim what is in the
[1:49:37] Bible what is on those tapes that's my
[1:49:40] mission that's my commission that's what
[1:49:42] I'll be held accountable for not that
[1:49:44] everybody's mental understanding can

[1:53:34] picky eater some of you are picky too
[1:53:36] you need to be picky on the word that
[1:53:38] you're feed it on where did the prophet
[1:53:42] say that that's a simple question that's
[1:53:45] not
[1:53:46] argumentative said I want to say amen I
[1:53:49] want to high five you where did the
[1:53:51] prophet say that oh the prophet didn't
[1:53:52] say that
[1:53:56] well amen
[1:53:58] somebody so there's some statements that
[1:54:01] he did make that he did not
[1:54:03] explain and he left them hanging like
[1:54:06] that the disciples couldn't explain it
[1:54:08] either but they had Faith Jesus turned
[1:54:11] and looked to the 12 and says will you
[1:54:13] go also then Peter made those notable
[1:54:16] words Lord where would we go for we are
[1:54:19] fully persuaded we know that you have
[1:54:23] the word of life and you alone they
[1:54:26] couldn't explain how they was going to
[1:54:28] eat his flesh and drink his blood they
[1:54:30] couldn't understand how he was going to
[1:54:33] ascend up from where he come down from
[1:54:36] when he was born in Bethlehem they
[1:54:38] couldn't but see Faith don't know no
[1:54:41] failure it's anchored it stays there no
[1:54:45] matter what anything else with anything
[1:54:47] said it stayed there they were ordained
[1:54:49] to this life they stayed
[1:54:53] there how many's glad about that the
[1:54:56] word of the Lord to give you the power
[1:54:59] to stay right there you stay with what
[1:55:02] the word
[1:55:03] says
[1:55:05] amen he never explained it he just kept
[1:55:09] right
[1:55:10] on I like how he puts it here and when
[1:55:12] their eyes was open they knew him you
[1:55:15] were the prophet of God says
[1:55:21] here per paragraph
[1:55:23] 66 He makes himself God he tries to be
[1:55:27] equal with god well he was he was the
[1:55:30] son of God and he says you call them who
[1:55:33] the word of word came to your law says
[1:55:36] that that the word came to the prophets
[1:55:38] and you call them Gods then if you could
[1:55:41] call a prophet God how can you condemn
[1:55:44] me when I say I'm the Son of God search
[1:55:47] the scriptures they're the one who tells
[1:55:49] you what I'm supposed to do if you don't
[1:55:51] do anything
[1:55:52] to what the word says I'm to do then
[1:55:55] don't believe me but if I do the works
[1:55:57] of My Father which is the word then
[1:56:00] believe the works that I do still they
[1:56:02] could not do it so Jesus said one day
[1:56:06] now watch he don't explain
[1:56:09] things he just says it notice he said
[1:56:13] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:56:15] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:56:18] in you could you imagine find
[1:56:21] intellectual bunch of people people a
[1:56:22] bunch of doctors standing out there
[1:56:24] rabbis real trained Highly Educated
[1:56:27] people thought when he said that oh I
[1:56:30] can imagine the doctor look over and say
[1:56:32] woo the ministers get up say uh-huh
[1:56:35] uh-huh see that brought it out right
[1:56:38] there now he never explained that he
[1:56:42] never explained it he didn't have to he
[1:56:46] didn't have to explain it what a rest in
[1:56:52] knowing that he can make those
[1:56:54] statements without having to explain
[1:56:58] it can we rest that way
[1:57:02] too can we rest in that this is what the
[1:57:06] word says I don't have to exp it's not
[1:57:09] my burden to explain I don't have to
[1:57:12] prove it to
[1:57:13] anyone let me say this about
[1:57:16] explanations you remember when they said
[1:57:18] if you just come off the cross we'll
[1:57:19] believe you I imagine there's a
[1:57:22] sympathetic believer there sitting I
[1:57:25] remember as a little boy I asked my mom
[1:57:26] I says mom why didn't Jesus just come
[1:57:29] off the cross and improve to them and
[1:57:32] then it would have been like aha see see
[1:57:35] I I I am who I said I was you know what
[1:57:39] but that wouldn't have been enough for
[1:57:41] them there's no explanation that would
[1:57:44] have ever been good enough for them if
[1:57:47] he would have came off the cross and did
[1:57:49] it again they would have said oh you
[1:57:50] didn't do it fast enough or you came
[1:57:52] down the wrong side well let me see you
[1:57:54] do it again and it's a big entertainment
[1:57:57] look look watch he's about to come off
[1:57:58] the cross watch this oh
[1:58:01] wow he came off the cross wow woo wow
[1:58:06] wow and then you run off the same sin
[1:58:08] that you're doing it doesn't change
[1:58:11] anybody the Miracles doesn't change
[1:58:14] nobody it only catches your attention to
[1:58:17] the word and once your attention is
[1:58:19] caught you receive the word now the word
[1:58:23] has the power to change any
[1:58:26] man but he uses the signs wonders and
[1:58:29] miracles to catch your attention to what
[1:58:32] to the
[1:58:34] word and do a basketball team and
[1:58:37] another entertainment and another
[1:58:39] program to keep the people happy and
[1:58:42] keeping them coming and give them the
[1:58:44] little treats and little stars and then
[1:58:47] you know yeah watch how you correct him
[1:58:49] you got to be careful you got to walk
[1:58:51] kind of walk in backwards when you going
[1:58:53] to correct him don't say nothing sh be
[1:58:54] quiet be be careful
[1:58:56] you what how long is he a newcomer no he
[1:58:59] been in the message for 20 years be
[1:59:01] careful how you approach him on this
[1:59:03] subject Lord help
[1:59:06] us H I want to be able to take the word
[1:59:10] no matter where it's coming if it's
[1:59:11] God's word take it
[1:59:15] amen yeah be careful you tell that read
[1:59:17] that quote to him in the morning he
[1:59:18] might leave
[1:59:23] it's not that you said it's how you said
[1:59:25] it to
[1:59:27] me big baby big cry baby what did the
[1:59:31] word
[1:59:32] say it's only the babies getting mad
[1:59:34] right
[1:59:35] now a son or a daughter of God I had my
[1:59:39] feelings hurt right have you it don't
[1:59:42] feel good right but do you need
[1:59:45] it we all agree that we do need it but
[1:59:49] then when it comes we don't you know not
[1:59:51] like that you're disrespected be like
[1:59:53] what did the word say my brother my
[1:59:55] sister what did the word
[1:59:57] say all of this padding on the back and
[2:00:02] temperamental and you know feelings I
[2:00:05] feel like I feel like I feel my feelings
[2:00:09] what did the word say huh I'm not trying
[2:00:13] to be annoying I'm trying to make a
[2:00:15] point here that the parasites need to
[2:00:17] come off of you my feelings need to come
[2:00:20] off of my personal my culture well in my
[2:00:23] culture we don't you know we do this we
[2:00:25] don't he I got to let my culture go I
[2:00:27] got to let my culture go what did the
[2:00:29] word
[2:00:32] say Lord help
[2:00:34] us you keep people longer you fluff them
[2:00:39] and you you you you stroke them and then
[2:00:42] you know like that Pentecostal cat he
[2:00:44] says you sitting on that pillow he say
[2:00:47] Pentecostal cat in the vision he's
[2:00:50] stroking so as you stroking him he's hey
[2:00:53] man oh we just love that those sermons
[2:00:56] on love love
[2:00:58] love and then you start talking about
[2:01:01] something against that cat you go the
[2:01:03] opposite
[2:01:06] way the green eyes came
[2:01:10] out up wait I thought we was Christians
[2:01:13] in here you were supposed to be a
[2:01:16] Pentecostal what you getting all them
[2:01:18] mad for I'm out of
[2:01:20] here why you mad bro
[2:01:24] the quote the if the quote made you mad
[2:01:27] you should have got mad that's
[2:01:30] right and then come to the Altar and
[2:01:32] deal with that
[2:01:35] feeling they get personal all the time
[2:01:38] we want it to be personal we wanted to
[2:01:40] be personal relationship between the
[2:01:42] Lord Jesus Christ I don't want any
[2:01:44] parasites on me I really don't you know
[2:01:48] and I want the word of the Lord to to be
[2:01:53] to have its free course in my life now
[2:01:56] the Apostle Paul says to purge yourself
[2:02:01] from these
[2:02:02] things and then you would be a vessel un
[2:02:07] to honor now Jesus the prophet of God is
[2:02:10] reading I'm reading from the prophet he
[2:02:12] says he never explained
[2:02:15] it he don't explain
[2:02:17] things paragraph number
[2:02:20] 73 let me get this is here in the
[2:02:23] message and their eyes were open they
[2:02:26] knew it all right let's go to paragraph
[2:02:29] number 75 they looked at one another
[2:02:31] well the son of man ascending up from
[2:02:33] where he come from well we know his
[2:02:35] mother we know his brother his sister
[2:02:37] seeing his manger he was laid in where
[2:02:39] he was born we seen the Cradle he was
[2:02:42] rocked in he come from Nazareth coming
[2:02:44] up there is a hard saying and they
[2:02:47] didn't walk with him no more see now all
[2:02:51] the time these disciples stood right
[2:02:54] there they didn't know it either but
[2:02:56] they believed it they couldn't explain
[2:02:59] it he never explained it but see they
[2:03:02] were ordained to life they couldn't
[2:03:04] explain it but you see there so he
[2:03:06] turned and said I've chose 12 out of you
[2:03:09] one is a devil he says do you want to go
[2:03:12] also and there is where Peter made those
[2:03:15] Memorial words Lord we are persuaded
[2:03:18] that you have the word of life alone
[2:03:21] where were we go to that was it you see
[2:03:25] he didn't explain it he said that so
[2:03:29] that they would turn down see Faith
[2:03:34] don't ask it don't reason it searches
[2:03:38] the
[2:03:41] scriptures for it if they had searched
[2:03:45] the scriptures there would have been
[2:03:48] proven who he was so beautiful point and
[2:03:51] I want to lay this in there to you
[2:03:53] Saints today there is that
[2:03:56] generic
[2:03:58] lazy position that many Believers take
[2:04:01] well I'm just saying what saying what
[2:04:03] the tape say I'm just saying what the
[2:04:04] word says and it is leave it out like
[2:04:07] that no explanation they don't have no
[2:04:10] source of where the the background of it
[2:04:13] but but here the Jesus said search the
[2:04:16] scriptures and them you'll find eternal
[2:04:19] life so there still is the burden for
[2:04:22] you to search the
[2:04:25] scripture because the scripture is the
[2:04:28] discipline that every believer must live
[2:04:31] by so we just don't grab a quote and
[2:04:35] throw it out there like the subject of
[2:04:37] marriage and divorce he says go home and
[2:04:39] take the scriptures and then study it
[2:04:41] and pray about
[2:04:44] it that discipline still needs to be
[2:04:48] there we don't use that as an excuse
[2:04:50] well he said it that's it and you just
[2:04:52] walk away uh uh did you search the
[2:04:54] scripture on it did you pick up your
[2:04:56] Bible on the
[2:04:58] subject I'm talking about brothers
[2:05:00] sisters
[2:05:02] everybody Jesus said to search the
[2:05:04] scriptures and we'll get into that in
[2:05:06] second Timothy in just a moment there's
[2:05:08] still a burden for the believer to pick
[2:05:11] up your
[2:05:13] Bible you need to be healed yeah go get
[2:05:17] the scriptures on
[2:05:18] healing you know we don't have to be a
[2:05:21] the we don't have to be able to stand in
[2:05:23] front of a group and to explain it but
[2:05:25] in your heart you need to have a word
[2:05:29] where the Lord said it right here that
[2:05:32] you can anchor your faith
[2:05:34] into can I get a witness this
[2:05:37] morning you go out here witnessing to
[2:05:39] somebody they're in the denomination and
[2:05:41] you give them a quote it's like where'd
[2:05:43] you get that from well brother random
[2:05:44] said it and you just walk off like if
[2:05:48] you're GNA be witnessing to somebody you
[2:05:49] probably should read your Bible too am
[2:05:53] huhuh like water baptism that's in the
[2:05:56] Bible the godhead explained that's
[2:06:00] scriptures what did the prophet do he
[2:06:02] brought us the
[2:06:04] scriptures and so it doesn't give us
[2:06:06] that out of
[2:06:08] laziness just to read a quote or throw a
[2:06:11] quote out there and not run through the
[2:06:14] discipline of searching the
[2:06:18] scriptures can I get a witness
[2:06:23] yes some of our friends Believers
[2:06:26] families whatever in the message a very
[2:06:30] biblically um what's the word I can use
[2:06:34] unsound a little
[2:06:36] lame biblically speaking won't pick up
[2:06:39] the scripture won't run it through and
[2:06:42] bring what the B what Jesus if you can
[2:06:45] pick up a quote you should be able to
[2:06:46] pick up a scripture
[2:06:49] too that's right somebody
[2:06:53] is the book of Timothy written just to
[2:06:55] the
[2:06:57] brothers are there some scriptures that
[2:06:59] are only for brothers and some for only
[2:07:00] for sisters or is it for
[2:07:03] believers pick up your Bible sis pick up
[2:07:07] your Bible my brother it is the best
[2:07:10] thing that God can give it's your
[2:07:12] friend pick it up it'll speak to you
[2:07:16] every day read it and then do what
[2:07:19] pray you want to draw closer to the Lord
[2:07:21] read your Bible and pray how many time
[2:07:25] every
[2:07:27] day praise the
[2:07:30] Lord oh my God bless you richly can I go
[2:07:33] a little bit further let me get a little
[2:07:36] bit further here so he
[2:07:38] says paragraph 78 he didn't explain it
[2:07:41] he said that so they would turn down see
[2:07:44] Faith don't ask it don't reason it
[2:07:48] searches what does the faith do it
[2:07:50] searches the
[2:07:52] scriptures for it if they had searched
[2:07:55] the scriptures there it would have been
[2:07:58] proven who he was but he shook them off
[2:08:02] like that by saying things and never
[2:08:06] explained
[2:08:08] it
[2:08:10] beautiful beautiful how many like
[2:08:13] that so let's take a little bible For
[2:08:16] You Second Timothy chapter 2
[2:08:21] in verse number
[2:08:42] 15 now if you didn't have a Bible that'd
[2:08:45] be
[2:08:46] different if you couldn't read that'd be
[2:08:48] different right
[2:08:52] but most of us in the in the US we're
[2:08:55] we're literate we can
[2:09:02] read absolutely second Timothy Chapter
[2:09:05] 2 thou there for my son be strong in the
[2:09:09] grace that is in Christ
[2:09:12] Jesus so where does strength come from
[2:09:15] and the things that thou Hast heard of
[2:09:17] me among many witnesses saying commit
[2:09:19] thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able
[2:09:21] to teach others thou therefore do what
[2:09:28] endure hardness as a good soldier of
[2:09:32] Jesus Christ there's Joshua right
[2:09:36] there no man that Warth entangle himself
[2:09:39] with the Affairs of this life that he
[2:09:41] may please him who hath chosen him to be
[2:09:46] a
[2:09:48] soldier now you're called by God to be a
[2:09:52] soldier verse number five If any man
[2:09:55] also strive for masteries this is
[2:09:59] athletes this is an athletic Paul is
[2:10:01] talking about yet is he not crowned
[2:10:04] except he
[2:10:06] strive lawfully what about in sports
[2:10:09] today I mean a real disciplined athlete
[2:10:13] has to be in tune with his body he has
[2:10:16] to be in tune with whatever athlete he's
[2:10:18] doing whatever sport he's doing it's
[2:10:19] baseball it's fo ball you have practice
[2:10:23] and then you have plays and you have
[2:10:24] things that you have to work on you have
[2:10:28] arguably a coach right you don't know it
[2:10:32] all you need somebody watching over you
[2:10:35] in this Sports and Paul gives the sports
[2:10:37] analogy some of us can witness to that I
[2:10:40] was raised playing sports I played team
[2:10:42] sports and I had coaches and I had some
[2:10:45] coaches that swore at me and yelled at
[2:10:50] me and one coach almost made me cry he
[2:10:53] yelled at me so hard and so harsh and I
[2:10:56] didn't go home and tell my mom or my
[2:10:58] daddy I sucked it up because I was a
[2:11:01] part of this team and I'm not advocating
[2:11:04] for that but if you are on a
[2:11:07] team I mean you're on you're part of a
[2:11:10] team right and not everybody can play
[2:11:13] football or basketball say well son you
[2:11:15] can be anything you want to do uh I
[2:11:17] don't think
[2:11:19] so some folks came around some people
[2:11:21] can't jump no you can go at the YMCA but
[2:11:24] you can't be on this team why because we
[2:11:27] want to
[2:11:28] win right you can go get us some water
[2:11:32] and you can cheer us along inspiration
[2:11:35] but we can't have you on the court
[2:11:40] son but coach I wanted to be a
[2:11:43] quarterback son you can't
[2:11:46] play but I wanted to be a quarterback
[2:11:48] you're sorry
[2:11:51] you need another you need a person to
[2:11:53] look you in the face and tell you that
[2:11:55] for real because mama and Auntie Mabel
[2:11:58] and all them supporting you and buying
[2:12:01] you the new Nikes in the little head
[2:12:02] gear and dropping you off at the park
[2:12:05] expecting you to play and nobody told
[2:12:08] you you sorry you can't
[2:12:15] play or do we want to be lied to all the
[2:12:18] time oh I can play I'm good yeah I'm
[2:12:21] good I'm going to get out there your
[2:12:22] peers will tell you real quick man get
[2:12:24] off the we'll play without you get off
[2:12:27] the team we'll be one man down get out
[2:12:29] get coach get him out of
[2:12:32] here how many know what I'm talking
[2:12:34] about sure that's coach this is this is
[2:12:37] your Apostle Paul talking about if you
[2:12:39] strive you got to strive lawfully look
[2:12:41] at the great this baseball and the
[2:12:45] cycling the drug use and the the the the
[2:12:48] the doping scandals that have been
[2:12:51] um that that that have come to light
[2:12:54] because a man's competition trying to
[2:12:56] win wanting to win and be great and so
[2:12:59] much and so much that he'll break the
[2:13:02] rules and take some drugs to enhance his
[2:13:05] performance and in get out there and now
[2:13:09] want to fight and strive on supposed to
[2:13:12] be an equal playing
[2:13:14] field but he's cheating he's a
[2:13:17] cheater he didn't pray didn't study he's
[2:13:21] quoting somebody
[2:13:24] else let me let me move that on there I
[2:13:27] mean look here Saints if you come to
[2:13:30] church for the pastor to give you
[2:13:33] material so you can live your Christian
[2:13:36] Journey you ain't going to make it every
[2:13:41] believer must come through their own
[2:13:43] test their own trials and pick up your
[2:13:48] own Bible and read it
[2:13:51] read it till it makes you cry read it
[2:13:54] until you feel it in your bones read it
[2:13:57] till it becomes your Bible your message
[2:14:01] your Prophet your lord
[2:14:05] Jesus and you're going to a home that he
[2:14:07] prepared for you in
[2:14:10] glory and then when they catch you up
[2:14:14] you'll give your life
[2:14:17] honorably because you had a divine
[2:14:19] revelation for yourself
[2:14:23] a lot of people
[2:14:24] cheating they look like
[2:14:27] believers they know how to argue like
[2:14:29] one
[2:14:31] too but longer the day is
[2:14:35] gone when I'm going to be quoting
[2:14:37] somebody else I'm going to quote this
[2:14:40] Prophet quote this
[2:14:44] Bible so he talks
[2:14:47] about
[2:14:49] this where was I at all right
[2:14:51] right the athlete the
[2:14:55] athlete and then he goes further into
[2:14:59] this strive for
[2:15:01] masteries and then verse six the
[2:15:03] husbandman that labor Earth must first
[2:15:05] be
[2:15:06] partakers of the fruit he talks about
[2:15:09] the farmer and him
[2:15:14] embracing the fruits of your
[2:15:16] labor there's nothing
[2:15:19] wrong with enjoy ing the fruits of your
[2:15:22] hard
[2:15:24] work like Joshua he had to
[2:15:28] embrace the
[2:15:30] commission that you was with Moses I
[2:15:33] will be well Lord I'm not worthy I will
[2:15:36] be with you as I was with Moses you got
[2:15:40] to embrace that commission can you
[2:15:43] Embrace that he's forgiven you of all
[2:15:45] your sins can you receive that that the
[2:15:49] grace is unmar
[2:15:51] can you Embrace that he has forgot all
[2:15:56] of the crimes that were against you and
[2:15:59] put them underneath the blood never to
[2:16:02] be brought up against you anymore can
[2:16:04] you receive that this
[2:16:06] morning or you have to be good enough
[2:16:08] before you can come and
[2:16:10] pray I feel more annoyed I feel like I'm
[2:16:13] good enough now and I'm not good I'm not
[2:16:15] worthy to take communion how so many
[2:16:17] people say I'm not worthy to take the
[2:16:18] Lord's Supper take communion show me a
[2:16:21] man that is
[2:16:22] worthy I know of one that was
[2:16:25] worthy that's our Lord Jesus
[2:16:29] Christ and he and right here at the
[2:16:31] cross made him worthy he won he
[2:16:35] won at Calvary he got up from the grave
[2:16:39] he won every battle and I'm in
[2:16:43] him so can you Embrace that you know a
[2:16:46] farmer can't settle for failure an
[2:16:50] athlete doesn't go into a match thinking
[2:16:52] he's going to lose if he does just go
[2:16:54] ahead and stay
[2:16:56] home you got to believe you're going to
[2:16:59] win huh in the military could you
[2:17:03] imagine a military force could you
[2:17:06] imagine the Army going into battle
[2:17:09] thinking man we're going to
[2:17:12] lose I don't feel good about this
[2:17:16] guys no you want you want some crazy
[2:17:19] folks you want some people who don't
[2:17:22] know what defeat is you want some folks

[2:17:28] baller not the guy

[2:18:09] group these are the athletes these are
[2:18:12] the farmers these are the people who
[2:18:15] know no defeat and the Apostle Paul is
[2:18:18] using this example here and he says if
[2:18:22] you're striving for masteries if a man
[2:18:25] also strive for Mastery yet he is not
[2:18:28] crowned except he strive
[2:18:32] lawfully you got to play by the
[2:18:34] rules amen
[2:18:37] somebody can I get a
[2:18:39] witness somebody say keep going Pastor
[2:18:43] keep going
[2:18:45] brother yeah somebody said it everybody
[2:18:47] didn't say it but somebody said it right
[2:18:51] and 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 19 says
[2:18:55] this nevertheless the foundation of God
[2:18:59] standed sure having this seal see I
[2:19:02] skipped the verse here let me go back
[2:19:04] and get pick up what I want all
[2:19:08] right what time is lunch today
[2:19:12] anyways huh
[2:19:22] we need to change the way you think
[2:19:23] about
[2:19:26] lunch some of y'all can let a lunch go
[2:19:29] for a little bit you too
[2:19:36] right everybody's still smiling God
[2:19:39] bless you can I take a little piece here
[2:19:42] I want to get this little part right
[2:19:45] here so here back to this discipline of
[2:19:50] faith Faith searches the
[2:19:53] scriptures Faith does that so Faith
[2:19:56] isn't just out there like I believe it
[2:19:58] you know the prophet said it and I just
[2:20:00] walking all day long when's the last
[2:20:02] time you read your Bible I don't need my
[2:20:03] Bible I just listened to the tape that
[2:20:05] ain't what the tape said that is not
[2:20:08] what the tape said I don't care how good
[2:20:10] that may sound how anointed you felt
[2:20:13] when you said it that is not what the
[2:20:15] tape said the tapes always pointed you
[2:20:18] back to your Bible back to the Lord
[2:20:21] Jesus Christ back to Calvary back to an
[2:20:25] oldfashioned altar back to the Holy
[2:20:28] Ghost back to a life change that's what
[2:20:32] the tape said any ministry will point
[2:20:35] you to the same thing let me close right
[2:20:43] here verse number 10 therefore are and
[2:20:47] do all things for elect's sake that they
[2:20:49] may obtain salvation which which is in
[2:20:51] Christ Jesus with eternal glory it is a
[2:20:53] faithful saying for if we be dead with
[2:20:55] him we shall also live with him if we
[2:20:57] suffer we shall also reign with him if
[2:20:59] we deny him he also will deny us if we
[2:21:03] believe not yet he abideth faithful he
[2:21:06] cannot deny himself of these
[2:21:09] things put them in
[2:21:13] remembrance charging them before the
[2:21:15] Lord that they strive not about words to
[2:21:18] no Prophet but to the subverting of
[2:21:22] hearers study to show thyself
[2:21:26] approved unto God a Workman that needed
[2:21:31] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[2:21:35] word of Truth Now is this scripture only
[2:21:38] to men only only to pastors only only to
[2:21:40] ministers only or is this scripture to
[2:21:42] the Bride of Jesus
[2:21:44] Christ huh is it for everybody or
[2:21:49] not it's for every body study to do what
[2:21:53] show yourself approved unto what oh I
[2:21:57] let everybody else know let everybody no
[2:21:58] unto God I'm studying before the
[2:22:01] Lord Show Yourself approved unto
[2:22:06] God a Workman that needeth not to be
[2:22:10] ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[2:22:14] Truth and then it gives us something to
[2:22:17] be careful of and I have to give this to
[2:22:19] you
[2:22:21] put them in remember study show but
[2:22:23] shine provan and vain babblings for they
[2:22:27] will increase unto more what ungodliness
[2:22:32] and their word will eat as doth a say it
[2:22:37] with me canker now that word
[2:22:41] canker is the same
[2:22:44] word it's a
[2:22:47] disease it's the Gang Green disease
[2:22:50] disease specifically it's what it's
[2:22:52] talking
[2:22:53] about it's
[2:22:55] infectious it it um it's
[2:23:00] spread and it it
[2:23:03] uh not it's influence but it what does
[2:23:06] it does it spreads what's another word
[2:23:08] for spreads
[2:23:09] it's it's contagious yes and if you
[2:23:13] don't deal with it it gets
[2:23:16] worse and
[2:23:21] let me give this to you just for a
[2:23:22] moment all
[2:23:29] right and it talked about
[2:23:33] these these men's their words hus and
[2:23:37] this other gentleman their words
[2:23:42] spread oh my I left it but it's okay I'm
[2:23:46] closing now anyways but that word there
[2:23:49] it eats as a
[2:23:51] Anker and before I was the Holy Spirit I
[2:23:55] was meditating on the Lord I was driving
[2:23:57] to this funeral I was thinking about
[2:24:01] cancers and how words are cancer there's
[2:24:04] cancerous words that people say and
[2:24:07] there's things that the cancerous radio
[2:24:11] programs cancerous news cancerous
[2:24:15] entertainment and it gets into you start
[2:24:17] hearing that stuff and the Bible said
[2:24:20] says to any man that would Purge himself
[2:24:23] from these things will be a vessel unto
[2:24:25] honor you got to you got to purge your
[2:24:28] ears from hearing that cancerous stuff
[2:24:31] because it
[2:24:33] spreads and what it does it even CS the
[2:24:36] faith of others to be
[2:24:39] overthrown and that Gang Green is the
[2:24:43] worst parasite you can think of but the
[2:24:46] word of the Lord is sharper than any
[2:24:48] two-edged sword
[2:24:50] it's meant to
[2:24:52] cut and to chop away and to
[2:24:55] remove and this is how you stay pure
[2:24:58] this is how you stay clean by staying
[2:25:01] with the word the word of the Lord
[2:25:06] cleanses the believer and Jesus needed
[2:25:09] to cleanse his congregation so he
[2:25:12] brought Doctrine he brought teaching to
[2:25:16] them to cleanse that group and what did
[2:25:18] it do it P P out this one left that one
[2:25:21] got up and left I knew it that group
[2:25:23] took off yeah whatever and that one and
[2:25:25] all these groups took off and
[2:25:27] here what do he have left just
[2:25:30] 12 he said will you go also he says no
[2:25:33] Lord you have the words of eternal life
[2:25:36] out of you know he had he had the 70 he
[2:25:39] had the multitude he had the 12 one of
[2:25:42] them was a devil it's like Lord you you
[2:25:44] know you're cutting everything back
[2:25:46] you're cutting everything back and all
[2:25:47] he was left with the 11 but they were
[2:25:50] real
[2:25:52] Believers and these 11 men went to
[2:25:54] different parts of the world and changed
[2:25:58] the neighborhood they was living in and
[2:26:00] God used them mightily that's why we're
[2:26:04] in the word
[2:26:06] today because the disciples the real
[2:26:08] Disciples of Jesus carried on his work
[2:26:11] carried on this word amen so God richly
[2:26:15] bless you the Great Purge is taking
[2:26:17] place it starts by the word coming
[2:26:22] forth he grows us by cutting us
[2:26:26] sometimes he didn't explain
[2:26:29] it and disciples couldn't explain
[2:26:32] it Jesus didn't explain it the disciples
[2:26:35] couldn't explain it but there it still
[2:26:37] the there is still the truth but it's
[2:26:40] still because we don't explain it
[2:26:41] doesn't mean we don't run through the
[2:26:43] discipline of finding it in the word
[2:26:46] search the
[2:26:48] scriptures for and you'll be be
[2:26:50] searching for the rest of your life but
[2:26:52] you don't stop searching is that right
[2:26:55] you can't explain it all you don't
[2:26:57] understand it all you will never
[2:26:58] understand it all but Timothy said to
[2:27:01] study to show yourself approved and this
[2:27:05] is how you cleanse yourself from the
[2:27:06] parasites and all the foolishness of our
[2:27:09] day God bless you so much richly I press
[2:27:13] I trust the Lord will bless you tonight
[2:27:15] the Lord willing brother Eli Castillo
[2:27:18] will be with us tonight
[2:27:20] a very fine brother he's been with us
[2:27:22] before if the Lord Wills I believe
[2:27:26] that's um the plan he's coming in he's
[2:27:30] out of Phoenix but he's coming in from
[2:27:32] the New Mexico funeral that was his
[2:27:34] auntie that passed and spoke with him a
[2:27:37] little bit and he going to share the
[2:27:39] word of the Lord with us amen all right
[2:27:43] don't you love
[2:27:45] him oh God bless you richly
[2:27:50] let me take one more scripture okay
[2:27:53] let's all stand as we take this in St
[2:27:55] John chapter
[2:28:04] 21 verse 22 Jesus saith unto
[2:28:07] him he's speaking of John if I will that
[2:28:10] he tar till I come what is that to thee
[2:28:15] follow thou me I'll let you get there St
[2:28:18] John chap 21:
[2:28:20] 22 when you have it you can say
[2:28:24] Amen all right we'll wait let some of
[2:28:26] you get your Bible scripture for you you
[2:28:31] get home read the whole chapter of
[2:28:32] course read all that you can Jesus said
[2:28:36] unto him if I will that he T till I come
[2:28:39] what is that to thee follow thou me then
[2:28:41] went the saying abroad among the
[2:28:43] Brethren that that disciple should not
[2:28:46] die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall
[2:28:50] not die but if I will that he tar till I
[2:28:53] come what is that to thee this is the
[2:28:58] disciple which testified of these things
[2:29:01] and wrote these things and we know that
[2:29:03] his testimony is true so Jesus makes a
[2:29:08] statement a saying goes out from the
[2:29:11] statement Jesus didn't go back and clean
[2:29:13] it up make sure no that's not what I
[2:29:15] meant that's not what I said the saying
[2:29:17] went out the disciple is not going to
[2:29:18] taste death
[2:29:20] and John was the oldest one oldest
[2:29:23] disciple but the rumor went out that
[2:29:25] Jesus said he's going to stay alive
[2:29:27] Jesus never said that and he let it go
[2:29:29] on he let it go on and he let some
[2:29:32] rumors go on too little things people
[2:29:35] say stuff said stuff about the prophet
[2:29:37] don't you think the prophet heard the
[2:29:39] lies that was told about him the little
[2:29:41] side deals people were making and stuff
[2:29:44] but he stayed with the word and Jesus
[2:29:46] still makes statements and allows
[2:29:49] statements to be made need to test your
[2:29:52] faith if you're looking for a AA moment
[2:29:56] to say oh I knew this was false there is
[2:29:59] a moment for you to find but if you're a
[2:30:02] Believer there's nothing that can be
[2:30:04] said that'll Shake A True Believer amen
