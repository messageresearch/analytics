TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. Praise the Lord, saints. Good morning. Welcome to the house of the Lord. We're going to go into our adult Sunday school portion of the service. Um we have been in the Holy Ghost series. What is the Holy Ghost? What was it given for? We started that in October, the last week of October. So all of November coming into December, we have been in what is the Holy Ghost? What is it given for? And um the Sunday school, the adult Sunday school portion of the service is not just for the background of um the plane of the tape. I think that um it sets the pace for the rest of our day. Of course, here in the prophet, but then it really gives us the opportunity to embrace the subject. We already know what's going to be preached. It's the series on the Holy Ghost. Many of us have heard it. And then you can listen to that series on your own away from the setting of the church. But there's something beautiful when you come together and listen to it as a class, 20 minute portions. That's the way that's broken up. And so we just encourage you to embrace that and really draw from the blessing that is in these few moments of what we call our adult Sunday school portion of the service. What was the Holy Ghost? What was it given for? I pulled away from that this morning because I had it on my heart. uh just came on my heart strongly to play the tape um why I'm against organized religion. And so that's what we'll listen to this morning. And in order to get a good portion of that accomplished, we will take our our Sunday school portion and play and start that tape there. It's a message Brother Brandon preached. He takes his scripture in 1 Samuel chapter 8. if you want to prepare to read there verses 4 through through 10. It's a very impactful message and I'm doing this because it was led I was led on my heart to play this tape for the saints uh today and I trust it'll be a blessing to you. Um earlier this year we I encouraged the saints. There was a question came up on something in marriage and divorce and some of the things that brother Brandham says. And so a question came up among some of the young people and even some of the older ones later this year and I felt like I missed warning the saints of some of these basic truths that are in the message. You know, you always feel guilty if somebody missteps or there's a problem that happens in the church. The pastor, I mean, I take that very personal and so I feel like maybe I didn't preach that hard enough or I didn't make that clear enough. Why would someone have a question on that? So, I was feeling a bit bad and I was on my way to uh to the service on Thursday night in Mesa and then the Lord had reminded me that I actually had told the church to listen to Marriage in the Voice. I don't know how many of you all remember that. I got copies of the books. I ordered them. I place them out there for you to get them and to hear them for yourself. And we played that. How many remember that? That was earlier this year. And when I did that, there's a sister, the Lord dealt with her. She repented and gave came back to the Lord, repented and was baptized and was totally but all of the questions that came up later was in that message. And then so my question is, so I said, "Thank you, Lord. I'm off the hook." Because I presented that to the people to listen to marriage and divorce. Now, if you listen to that, if you take that and embrace that, then God bless you. If you don't, then that's really something you should examine. Okay? Many times, Brother Brandon will tell us, you know, when you go home, read the rest of these scriptures. And I wonder how many of us really do that. It's as if he's just saying that to fill in time. No. And he actually says it on this tape. When you go home, take these scriptures and read them. And I think that that's when you will really get the fullness of what that message is trying to bring to you. Amen. So, God bless you. As we prepare to go to this message, let's all stand and sing. Only believe. Amen. Only [singing] believe. [music] Only [singing] believe [music] that all things are possible only. Only [singing] [music] believe. Only [singing] believe. All things are possible. Only Billy. God bless. You may be seated. Brother Brandham. tonight is why I'm against organized religion. And I'm going to read now for a background or scripture reading to make it uh certainly scriptural. I want to read from 1st Samuel 8 4-10 then 19- 20. To my visible audience, I trust that when you go home that you'll write these scriptures down and read them carefully and to the brethren who will be listening to the tape. I trust that you also will not just stop the tape when something said maybe that you wouldn't agree with, but will seek God in it. see if it's scriptural. I think we owe it to ourselves and to the message of the day. I believe that all churches has Christians in them and I certainly do not speak against Christians. But the reason that I have did what I have done and said what I have said is because of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit on the word. Now let us read in 1 Samuel the 8th chapter beginning with the fourth verse and reading the 10th inclusive verse. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel at Ramoth and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons not walk not in the way now. Make us a king to judge us like all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them, according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me and serve other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now therefore, hearken unto their voice. How be it, yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall rule over them. And Samuel told all these words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. Now the 19th verse and 20th for the conclusion. Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and they said, "Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go before us, and fight our battles." The Lord add his blessing unto the reading of his words. Now, as a Sunday school class, I would like to uh say that we want to try to be as as attentive as we can to the word. And we know that that sometimes things are said and certain churches that stumble someone who has been taught contrary to what they have are hearing. For instance, a man told me the other day who is a friend of mine sitting present now. He said, "When you said, Brother Brandham, as much faith as I've had in you and believe, when you said there wasn't no eternal hell," said I like to fell out of my seat. I said, "Surely the man is wrong." And then said, "You let us stand for quite a while." And then you said there is only one form of eternal life and that comes from God. And that's what we all seek. &gt;&gt; See, and there's no scripture that says there is an eternal hell because eternal never did begin. Neither does it ever end. &gt;&gt; So the Bible said hell was created for the devil and his angels. So it isn't eternal. There was a time when it wasn't. And there will be a time when it's not again. &gt;&gt; But they may be punished in there through fire and brimstone and the pits of fire for aons of time. But it finally will end because hell is not eternal. And if there was an eternal hell, you'd have to have eternal life to live in an eternal hell. And if it was eternal, it always was. And you always was in hell. and you'll always be in hell. See, so there is no such a thing. So you see, eternal is never had a beginning or an end and is only one form of eternal life and that is in God. Comes from the Greek word Zoey which means God's own life. And when we are born again of the spirit of God, we become eternal with God because we have part of his life which makes us sons and daughters to God. Then we have eternal life and the life that is in us. God will raise up the body with the life at the last day. But it's the spirit of God that's in us that raises up because it is a spirit of Christ that was in Christ that quickens our bodies and raises us up also with him to set and and glory and reign with him. Now to the subject. Now I have been through these years and this tabernacle has stood though I was ordained in a missionary Baptist church by Dr. Roy E. Davis about 33 years ago here in Jeffersonville. Now I since then I was in the organization just a short time a few months until something come up that was unscriptural by the church and I told him I could not go and so I was of course um asked to do it or else and I so that was one thing and I believe that this is God's word. &gt;&gt; And I said to the man which was a a master teacher, if you will show me that in God's word, but it was he said that's our teaching. I said, but I want it out of the word. &gt;&gt; See, God's word. am not because that I do not belong to an organization that I have been against the organization because I am grateful to my brethren to which I am speaking today that I have invitations to I guess pretty near every denomination especially in the full gospel ranks and even in many of the other churches I have been asked to come into their fellowship and join with them. But I have stayed independent because what influence that I have, I do not wish to place it upon one group of people. I wish to place what God has given me. A prayer for the sick to be benefited by all God's children and every organization. He has never questioned to me uh not to pray or for this one because they belong to such and such. God judges the heart of man. And now to begin with the reason that I haven't belonged to them and have spoken against it is first is because I do not believe that organization of Christianity is scriptural. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it's unscriptural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I will try tonight endeavor by the grace of God to prove to you that it is unscriptural, unorthodox to have any organization. Now the first place we call it religion. The word religion is a covering. Means to cover something. Now, Adam had a religion, but he certainly made it himself out of fig leaves &gt;&gt; and it didn't work. &gt;&gt; He made his own theory and tried to make a way of escape to find salvation and something he had done himself and God rejected it from Adam to the order of the last organization. &gt;&gt; Never been. And by God's grace, we'll prove it today through the Bible. Religion was a covering. Adam made himself a covering out of fig leaves. Made it himself to try to do something himself. But God required death and atonement. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a quite a vast difference between religion and salvation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, salvation, religion is a covering. See, salvation is a birth. Earth a gift of God and it cannot be achieved by any man or any group of man. &gt;&gt; It's an individual that God brings this gift to. And these gifts of eternal life were ordained of God to each individual before we even had a world according to the scriptures. The Bible said in Revelations that the Antichrist that was to come upon the earth would deceive all that dwelt upon the earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; God by his fornowledge saw who would come and who wouldn't come. Christ came down to make a way for those who would come. &gt;&gt; See, knowing the others, if he's God at all, he has to be infinite. And if he's infinite, he cannot be infinite without being omnipotent. &gt;&gt; He cannot be omnipotent without being omnipresent. &gt;&gt; He can't be omnipresent without being omnicient. &gt;&gt; You see, all that makes him God. So he knowed the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knowed who would and who would not. And he knowed there was many who would. So he sent Christ to make an atonement for those who would come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now nothing we do can have anything to do with it. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "All the father has given me half past tense will come to me. And no man can come unless my father draws him. &gt;&gt; Now see, it's all in God's knowledge. You say, "Brother Brand, am I in? I don't know. I'm hoping I am." We work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Now, the church is predestinated to meet God without spot or wrinkle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if we're in that church, we are predestinated with that church. &gt;&gt; Now, examine yourself by the word. Then you can check up how far along we are. Now, now organizational Christianity can never give that assurance. No. Some of them said, "You come up and confess that Jesus is the Christ, be baptized in the church." The devil does the same thing. He believes himself that Jesus is the Christ and tremble. See, that's right. God never commanded nowhere in the scripture for there ever to be any organization. There's no place in the Bible for that. &gt;&gt; Adam started one and it failed. And then Nimrod tried to make an organization. If you're a historian and you know the history of Babylon, read Hess's two Bablins, you'll find a great lot of light that Nimrod, this man of sin, uh took Bablin and all its uh little sister church or places around which was a type of of this last day apostasy Christianity and made one great big place and all the rest of them played paid tribute to it. And in there, he built a tower and tried to organize man together, but it failed. It failed. That failed. Kora and Numbers 16:1, if you'd like to read, Kora tried the very same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He got all the Levites together and he got the uh uh some of the celebrity, the high man, great man, holy man, and him and Dayan got together and said, "It's not right. One man trying to be oversolved." And so they tried to get a an organization started together and they come up before Moses and Aaron who God had chosen for the work and told them they took too much upon themselves that the whole congregation was holy and they had a right to in the multitude of counsel or safety. Of course they say that doesn't apply to Christianity. That's in war. &gt;&gt; Notice whole lots of difference. You can take a scripture and say Judas went and hung himself and you go do likewise if you want to. But that don't make it right. &gt;&gt; God had chosen Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God had chosen Aaron &gt;&gt; and it was the message of the day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And no matter how good the other side looked, it was contrary to God's thinking. &gt;&gt; And we've got to let God's thinking be our thinking. Let the mind that was in Christ be in you. &gt;&gt; And this Bible reveals the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the whole book of Revelations called the apocalypse is the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can see how he condemns the thing, how he takes it to one side, and we'll get to it after a bit. All right. Kora, I believe he was sincere in his act. I believe the man didn't uh didn't mean to do wrong. I believe it was the ignorance of the man that didn't see the hand of God moving and know the scriptures and that's the reason he just brought it to reason &gt;&gt; and that's just about 90% of the trouble today &gt;&gt; that we try to inject into the program of God our thinking &gt;&gt; and we are not supposed to think it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He does our thinking. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to surrender our thinking to his will. &gt;&gt; You understand? Now &gt;&gt; Kora with good intent went around with a false doctrine telling these brothers and showing them by reason that God hadn't only blessed Moses the prophet the messenger and had only blessed him but the whole congregation &gt;&gt; was holy. He said and now the whole congregation has a right to do this. The whole congregation has a right to do that. And so they got good man, Levites. Now that is God's choice which would be called today the ministers. Levite was the minister of the temple. &gt;&gt; Did not Moses call him down for it? And here he never went at it unre irreverent. He told them to take sensors and put holy fire in it and put this incense over the top of it and to wave this holy incense which was the command of God. And they come up to make a group of men to control the church where God had commanded one man to do so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And when they did that, Moses fell on his face, &gt;&gt; for he knew that God had commissioned him to that work &gt;&gt; and God said, "Have him to bring those sensors up here before the tabernacle." And so when they begin to wave their sensors full of fire and the incense are going, God said to Moses and Aaron, "Separate yourself from them." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out &gt;&gt; from among them. &gt;&gt; For later he called them sinners. &gt;&gt; Unbelievers. And sin is unbelief in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You steal because you don't believe. You lie because you don't believe. &gt;&gt; You commit adultery because you don't believe. If you was a believer, you wouldn't do such. &gt;&gt; There's only two roads. That's either faith or unbelief. You're controlled by one or the other. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] Heat. Heat. Brother Heat. [music] Heat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; morning. [music] Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] Hallelujah.

I had a message I had been working on. It's definitely on my heart and I was putting it all together last night. I was going to bring that. And then this morning, something I had been listening to just really touched me and I felt like I should play it. I've thought that many times, but this was a little bit more. And I feel like the answer to what's going on in my life and our lives is on this tape here this morning. I believe that if it is not for anyone else, it'll be for me. I didn't listen to the entire message, but just felt impressed to play um that for the saints this morning. All right. And that message is um why I'm against organized religion. So as prepare as we prepare to go there, let's stand and read the opening scripture that we started that message in Sunday school. 1st Samuel chapter 8 verses number 4 and 10. 1st Samuel chapter 8 verse number four verse number 10. I'll put it on the screen for you too if you can't get it. But the thing then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel at Rama and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us." And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people, and all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them." according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, served other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now therefore hearken unto their voice. How be it yet protest solemn solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked him of a king. Verses number 19. Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and they said, "Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles." And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them into the ears of the Lord. The Lord said to Samuel, "Hearken to their voice. Make them a king." And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, "Go ye every man unto his city." Amen. May God add a blessing to the reading of his word. As we move forward and listen to this message here, a portion of this message um why I'm against organized religion and let's sing only believe as we prepare there. [music] Only believe. [singing] Oh, living that all things are possible. Only believe. [music and singing] Only believe. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. Only believe. All things are possible. Oh, let's make a confession. Lord, I believe. And Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Yes Lord I believe. Oh Lord I believe. Hallelujah. [music] Lord I believe. All things are possible. [music and singing] for &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated, brother Brenham. &gt;&gt; Now, God in the beginning was the word and he was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; He was the word. He is the word. And when God dwells in you, it's the word of God dwelling in you &gt;&gt; where you can punctuate everything he says with an amen. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; That's God dwelling in you. Now, if you notice these innocent men with sensors in their hand, holy bar in their hand, God opened up the earth &gt;&gt; and swallowed them up &gt;&gt; and separated them from Moses because Moses separated himself from them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Moses warned the congregation. &gt;&gt; Don't fool with that kind of a group. &gt;&gt; Get away from them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now you know the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Read the 16th, 17th, 18th even chapter and you'll find it. Separate yourself from these sinners. &gt;&gt; Unbelieving sinners. Come out from among them. &gt;&gt; Amen. for they're headed for destruction &gt;&gt; and everything that they had. And when they the earth followed and fell with these men holding this holy fire, &gt;&gt; innocent man deceived by man. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, today there's a many innocent man falling into the trap of tradition [clears throat] &gt;&gt; holding the holy word in his hand. &gt;&gt; And supposedly to be preaching from it. &gt;&gt; I seen a expression come across a minister's face just then. a Methodist minister, was a Methodist minister till last Sunday night. And honey, look, I suppose it means a whole lot to you, brother, to be out. Now see holding sensors fire burning sweet smelling savior before God and those hands &gt;&gt; holding that yet perished &gt;&gt; with the sense in their hand because they were trying to do something in sincerity yet against the word of God. Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; Trying to make an organization &gt;&gt; said, "You take too much upon yourself." Who are you to say that you've got all the word of God? They failed to see that Moses was the messenger of that hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He had thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; There was nobody on earth like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had the message and the people failed to see it. And Moses was exactly with thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sure. All right. Now, we find the same thing today. Good man, great man, precious man trying to preach the word of God in their hand through some manmade tradition, &gt;&gt; cutting out here and cutting down here and making it this and come join the church and change your membership. spiritually die with that word in their hand. &gt;&gt; They could not believe God's messenger or his message of that day. &gt;&gt; They couldn't understand why a great God wouldn't work with a whole group of people and just put it up on one man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of them have I talked today? What would we do, brother Brown? &gt;&gt; We know you're right. But what will we do? the organization to put us out. We'd have no other place to go. I feel sorry for them, &gt;&gt; but there is a place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we had starved to death." David said, "Once I was young, and now I'm old." Now, I've never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed to beg bread. That's exactly on the same basis &gt;&gt; that they refused Jesus. &gt;&gt; They were so wrapped up in their denomination and holy priest and holy buildings and holy churches and holy temples, they failed to see God in his human temple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You being a man, make yourself God. Mhm. &gt;&gt; See, they were so wrapped up in it. &gt;&gt; These men were so wrapped up that Dayan and Nam were right. Nimrod was so wrapped up that he could achieve something that would take the people above the wrath of God. &gt;&gt; Adam was sure that if he covered his nakedness, God couldn't see it. You can't cover it. God has to cover it. That's right. &gt;&gt; God's program covers it, not yours. &gt;&gt; It's always been that way. &gt;&gt; They fail to see Jesus in his temple. God manifested in flesh today. It kind of makes me feel bad when I see that the words of the Bible has been so cut up by tradition. &gt;&gt; Amen. and honestarted people who stand there and hear that word and they know it's the truth but they're daring to take a move &gt;&gt; because their tradition teaches them different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wash the pots and pans then. Brethren, &gt;&gt; go ahead. But for us and for me in my house, we take Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's take John 3 just a moment. Nicodemus, a master and ruler of a great denomination called the Sanhedrin. They brought themselves together and they made their traditions, the one of the Pharisees and one of the Sadducees. And they had their denomination and their differences. And so they, this man was a master, a ruler of this great Sanhedrin, a marvelous man in teaching. He know the scriptures. He thought, he knew it by their tradition. &gt;&gt; Did not Jesus say, "You have by your tradition made the commandments of God of non effect &gt;&gt; because of their traditions." What is that? Placing their own interpretation upon the word instead of leaving it alone what it says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They say it doesn't mean this. Did you notice that's the same voice that the devil used to Eve to start the first organization? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Surely it would be this way. God wouldn't do that. You know, it's the same thing. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing today. Now we notice this ruler came to Jesus. The first thing now he come in search of eternal life. He come in search of salvation yet a man of his standing. a master in Israel. But a master in Israel come to a man that we have no record ever had a day in school. &gt;&gt; An old age man, old priest sage come to a young fellow aristocrat. They were rich man come to a beggar that didn't have a place to lay his head &gt;&gt; to ask [screaming] him for way to salvation and &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; the first place they of that Sanhadrin so confessed Nicodemus they had seen something in Jesus that other men of their organization didn't have &gt;&gt; amen Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They seen that there was something in him &gt;&gt; because he said, "Rabbi, we know thy we." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't confess it because they get kicked out. &gt;&gt; See, we know thou art a teacher come from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For no man could do these things that you do except God be with him. We know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh myise. organization. Now, we notice that Jesus was a manifestation of God. Now, no man can do these things except God be with him. They know that there was something different in that man. He was the light of the day. He was God's witness. So did Kora. See the same thing in Moses. They didn't have a man that day like Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was God's divine witness &gt;&gt; of that day to the power of God. Cora and his group saw it. And Moses. They understood that it couldn't be Moses. Moses could not open up the Red Sea. Moses could not send plagues upon the earth. It was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Moses. &gt;&gt; And because God represented himself in a witness or a light of the day, they failed to see it. &gt;&gt; Kora wanted to make a whole group of men. Bring in anything. That's what the organization's good for. Bring in every riff wrath there is and call it Christianity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Send a boy to school that knows more about God than a hot and top would know about an Egyptian knife. Send him over there and give him an education, learn him for psychology, and give him a PhD and a doctor of degree or bachelor of art or something like that and send him away to preach the gospel. It's never even been saved. &gt;&gt; That will deny the virgin birth and the resurrection. Deny divine healing. Deny the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Deny the very principles that Jesus died for. Deny Mark 16 of being inspired. &gt;&gt; My Lord, &gt;&gt; deny these signs shall follow them that believe when Jesus said the words himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deny Acts 2:38. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deny any rest of scriptures that's inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And try to take a tradition of man that they know nothing about and harp on it. And when you tell them the truth and show them the truth, they're ashamed to move because their organization. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Kora did the same thing. &gt;&gt; He seen God in Moses. &gt;&gt; He seen it was God's agent working through him. &gt;&gt; And Nicodemus saw God in [screaming] Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man can do these things except God be with him. Nicodemus was already in the organization trying to get out. Kora was out trying to make one to get into. That was a different &gt;&gt; Nicodemus is trying to find salvation to get out of the thing. He been in it since the boy. He's tired of it. He want to get saved. But Cor was trying to make him a a place where he could be a big shot. &gt;&gt; That's where the people today. That's the trouble with Christianity. We got so much false impersonations. &gt;&gt; Amen. And our Pentecostal people excuse expression is lousy with it. &gt;&gt; Carnal comparison. &gt;&gt; Let God raise up a man and give him something and everybody in the country will try to impersonate that person. &gt;&gt; Don't you realize you're killing your own team. &gt;&gt; When you're playing football in a grace, as Paul would have put it, let us run this race with patience. The man that's got the ball, don't take it out of his hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Try to guard him. But instead of that because you don't belong to your organization, you're trying to take it away from it. &gt;&gt; Am I &gt;&gt; some man that so clumsy he couldn't stumble over the flowers in a rug and then try to take it away from it? That's right. Ah, spiritual speaking. I mean, excuse me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, you stumble over a little thing like Acts 2:38, he's short of fall. Stumbles over Mark 16, how's he going to make it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. very chief lessons of Christ and the very thing that was discussed at the NIA council. They still stumble over after all these years trying Cora was trying to make an organization to get into it and Nicodemus had been in it trying to get out of it. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus was accepted and came out. Kora perished in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. in his effort. He perished in his own effort. Oh my. The organization that Nicodemus was in knew that Christ was sent of God said. So Nicodemus in the third uh chapter here confesses it. Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher sent from God. For no man can do these miracles that you do except God be with him. &gt;&gt; And the same group because of their organization called him the elub &gt;&gt; because of his power to cast out devils and said he deceives our people by his doctrine. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing today. &gt;&gt; Deceiving what? Jesus said, "I only do that that pleases the father." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I only keep the words of God because he was the word. &gt;&gt; You couldn't do nothing else but the word, &gt;&gt; but because of their organization. &gt;&gt; Because of their way they had man tied up in their hearts. They knew it, &gt;&gt; but their organization wouldn't let him keep it. than to make a way of escape to keep the people from leaving the organization. all men goeth after him to keep the people from leaving the organization and following God's truth which he was truth I am the truth the light to keep them from following that they said that he was deceiving the people &gt;&gt; think of it a man that in his heart know that he was God &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; God was in him &gt;&gt; no man can say these things or do these things unless God be with him. Knowing that and saying that and confessing that and then turning around and calling the elabub and a deceiver of the people their people by his doctrine. Oh my. Nicodemus knew he was a prophet. Now that was one in the organization at loved God enough and feared God enough and recognized by the Old Testament that this man had the qualifications and was proven and vindicated. &gt;&gt; A prophet sent from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The man I'll honor him if he did come but he got there. He's a lot better than a lot of our teachers today. They won't come at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus finally arrived. So don't condemn him. You haven't arrived yet. &gt;&gt; Nicodemus knew that he was a prophet. So he feared God. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't let that man get away from him. The light of that day, no matter how much it was contrary, how much his organization said it was contrary, he seen God vindicating that man. And he knew he was a prophet. And if he was a prophet, the word of the Lord comes to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he knowed what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; So he went to Jesus. &gt;&gt; He wanted to know how to get salvation. This man was a prophet. The word of God was with him and he would know the way of salvation. Amen. &gt;&gt; But what Nicodemus had to learn is what many people today of the denominations of this day has to learn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What Nicodemus ought to have known is what the people today ought to have known of these denominations. He was more than a prophet. He come to him to find tell him to tell him which way to life. And Jesus himself was life. &gt;&gt; He that has a son has life. &gt;&gt; So he didn't mustn't come to try to learn a teaching. He must come to accept the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it is tonight. &gt;&gt; The chief cornerstone is rejected again. &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly right. What is the chief cornerstone? It's a word. Of course, Christ, he is the word. &gt;&gt; He had to learn something. &gt;&gt; He thought, well, this man is a prophet. He's just a prophet. So, did you notice Jesus never answered his question? He just rebuked him for his blindness. more than a prophet. &gt;&gt; He was the word and the shining light of the word. &gt;&gt; He was God shining through an instrumentality proving that it was God in the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the word. First John the first chapter St. John 1 chapter other says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and here was the word of God shining through this little frail frame of a man and it blinded the organization &gt;&gt; but he come to get individuals &gt;&gt; more than a prophet &gt;&gt; he was a word. &gt;&gt; He is life. Not he didn't have to teach you of some life to come. He was that life himself. &gt;&gt; He was life. He was light. &gt;&gt; He was life. He was eternal life. &gt;&gt; Was in him. And he alone is a giver of eternal life. &gt;&gt; He that has the son has life. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you you can't just have the word teaching of him. You've got to have him. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, people sit down and learn that Bible and all the Greek words and what the definitions are and the punctuations and so forth and know more about God than nothing." &gt;&gt; No. He that has he that has the the the farm, he that has the plan, it's he that has the son &gt;&gt; that has him the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the one that has life. Nicodemus knew that he knew about life, but he never knew that he was eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's what the man he was talking to. &gt;&gt; The messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The light of the day. &gt;&gt; The light of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended not. He was sent to his own. His own received him not. Why? Why? Because they were so organized, &gt;&gt; set up with washing pots and pans and traditions that they failed to see the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; It's repeated. &gt;&gt; It's repeated again. History repeats itself ever so often. Yes, he knew that he had he knew about life, but Nicodemus didn't know that he was life. That's what it is today. So many people try to make Jesus all a great teacher. They even try to say he was a prophet. But when you try to say he was God, that's too much. &gt;&gt; See, but he was God &gt;&gt; and he is God and he always will be God. That's all. &gt;&gt; That's right. Notice he never told Nicodemus. Now when he come to him, he'd never said, "Now, Nicodemus, I have great respects for you, that you are a a master in Israel. I tell you what, you're searching eternal life. Perhaps you ought to polish up on your scholarship. You don't say your words right." Nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or maybe you ought to seek a higher office in your denomination to have eternal life. That's what so many people try to do today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A higher office. They want to become from a a pastor to a state presbyter or to some bishop or something like that. That has the more to do with God than nothing. &gt;&gt; Watch what he did before such a person. He rebuked him for his not knowing &gt;&gt; the hour he was living. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean to tell me that you're a master in Israel and Caleb understands these things? &gt;&gt; When he said a man's got to be born again. &gt;&gt; Why? He said, "Uh, me, an old man entered into my mother's wombs." He said, "And you are a bishop, a cardinal, a state president in a Pentecostal church or somebody else, some great guy in the organization, and you don't know this scripture." Oh, we got Moses. If you would have known Moses, you'd have known me because he was the one that spoke of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But not according to their traditions, their their organization. That was different. But Moses did speak of him. And he was that one that Moses spoke of. &gt;&gt; And yet they didn't know it. Why? They got theirelves so bound down with traditions. &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. And my brethren, it re takes this tape. Don't turn it off now. Just a minute. Let's look this thing right in the face. I love you. &gt;&gt; You're a shepherd. And I'm not trying to be a know-it-all. If I'm making that impression, then you stop the tape and pray for me. I'm only trying to bring to you something that's true. &gt;&gt; Don't let it get by you. Now, I respect the order of man and so forth, but when you make these organizations, look at the Pharisees would have nothing to do with the Sadducees because the Sadducees didn't believe in and neither angel or or spirit or resurrection or anything. And the Pharisees were successful and they were at war with one another. Now, the oneness be one thing, the Trinity believes another, the Methodist another, and the Presbyterian another. And you draw little lines and what have you got? A separation of brotherhood. &gt;&gt; By the way, we'll find that place in the Bible in just a little bit. What it is, what God says it is. Now, no, he never told him to polish up. He's just rebuking him for not knowing the real thing. Art thou a master in Israel and know not these things? If I have told you earthly things and you can't understand it, think a master, a high order in an Orthodox church, bishop, cardinal, and you can't even understand a baby form of natural things. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, how are you going to understand spiritual things from heaven? But a ignorant old fisherman who couldn't even write his own name understood it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And was made the head of the church at Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Peter. &gt;&gt; Oh, all the father has given me, he will come. &gt;&gt; They see it, they believe it, they act on it, &gt;&gt; knowing nothing's going to hold them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like the farmer, it's not pleasant to put a joke. But to make an illustration, they said a farmer set a hen and they didn't have enough eggs. He put a duck egg under the little duck was hatched. He's the funniest looking thing them chickens ever saw. He had a long funny face and he went along quacking instead of clucking and and the chickens all eat and pecked in the barnyard. And that wasn't his diet exactly. So one day the old hen led him out behind the barn to catch some grasshoppers and over the hill was a a lake and the wind happened to come up off the lake and he smelt the water. &gt;&gt; It's just his nature. The old h said cluck cluck cluck cluck come back. He said quack quack quack right through the water. Why? He was a duck to begin with. &gt;&gt; No matter how much the hen clucked, he was still a duck. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is of a man that's predestinated to eternal life. When he sees the light of God, the enough organizations in the world will tuck him back into &gt;&gt; Why? It's his nature. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; He might have been dicting with them a long time, eating their trash and socials, but he comes to a place, he finds something different. &gt;&gt; So, he knows it. My sheep know my voice, said Jesus. &gt;&gt; Stranger they'll not follow. &gt;&gt; They might be following something strange, but down in there is something different. Let them hear the truth one time and watch them. &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He rebuked him for not knowing thou art the master in Israel and know about these things. You must be born again. Now the natural man I want tell you to notice something here. You must be born again. Now natural life if we have natural life in order to be active in this natural life in natural things we have to have a natural birth. &gt;&gt; They don't just jerk you off of a tree somewhere. See stick you out some way. They've tried it but it didn't work. It's got to be an actual birth, natural birth to make you active so you can have the five senses. Walk, talk, see, taste, feel, smell, hear, move around, so forth. Because you're then a human being and you're you're subject to all these things because they go into the natural life. And in such a birth sometimes we become very wise in worldly wisdom. Uh are the affairs of the world become presidents and and great scholars and master mechanics and scientists and so forth. And you always know from the very beginning it was Cain's children that had that kind of wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not say us. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were humble sheep men. But Seaest children were godly people. But Cain's children was always smart. H science doctors and great man. &gt;&gt; That's right. The Bible said so. You know that teaches that. And very religious but perished at the end. We become wise by going to school, taking scholarship and so forth. We become very wise, smart, and can do things and say things and sometimes outalk a man that's spiritfilled. Didn't Jesus say the children of this world is wiser than the children of the kingdom? &gt;&gt; Sure. Because they by their intellects that they can can talk and outsmart and out talk and take the scriptures and twist it to make it say things that it doesn't. &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't exactly mean that. When a man says that, get away from him. &gt;&gt; God watches over his word. You know the Bible says &gt;&gt; it's wrote just the way it should be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it's put in such a way to deceive or to make the wise stumble over it. &gt;&gt; It's so simple. That's the reason they stumble over it. &gt;&gt; All right. All this wisdom and things that they can accumulate yet but it is from that birth is from beneath. This earth is from the earth and it is against the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first birth to make us active here makes us mortal man because of the sin act at the garden made man come into the world by a woman and a man that is born of a woman is of a few days but a man that is born of Christ is eternal. &gt;&gt; Job said a man that's born of a woman is few days and full of trouble. &gt;&gt; Notice but a man that's born of Christ has to be born from above. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but a man that's born to the earth become wise and can almost outsmart. Look how shrewd the devil was. He fooled every priest to come on the earth. &gt;&gt; He surely he fooled. He's still doing it. &gt;&gt; Sure did. He was smart. &gt;&gt; But he come up against his match one day &gt;&gt; who defeated him. And the only thing we have to do is lay against him. He's already defeated him. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's from beneath. And it this wisdom that man accumulate to prove and show all these things why man should do this and man should do that. It's contrary and [clears throat] immity the carnal mind to God. The scripture said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. No matter how smart they can twist it around. I want somebody to show me where God ever had an organization or ever commanded one. But what condemns it here in the Bible. No matter how smart they can try to be, it's contrary how the wisdom can stand and out argue to you and make you feel that little by telling you about it. But it's contrary to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody said to me, "Brother Brand, there's one thing I got against you." Said, "You're Jesus only." I said, "I am not. I don't belong to any organization." A presenter of a certain state sent to the day and said, "Someone told me you were Jesus only. Brother Ram I said that is contrary that is wrong said they told me that you believe in free love that man should leave their wives and hunt I see that's just lies of the devil &gt;&gt; you know that &gt;&gt; I said I absolutely am against such &gt;&gt; unscriptural things &gt;&gt; I believe in holiness and purity &gt;&gt; I believe that man is bound to his wife as long as he live &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you shouldn't take her without praying first &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus only, the Jesus only group. Nothing against them. They're just as good as any group to me. But they baptize. Wrong. They baptize to regeneration. I believe that we're regenerated by the Holy Spirit, not the water. &gt;&gt; I do use the name of Jesus Christ in baptism. And there's not another scripture in the Bible to b to make it contrary. There was nobody in the Bible ever baptized in the name of father, son, holy ghost. &gt;&gt; I want somebody to come show me one place one person's baptized like that. &gt;&gt; If it's unscriptural, quit doing it. &gt;&gt; He said it doesn't make any difference. It did to Paul. &gt;&gt; He commanded be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ and then receive the Holy Ghost. And Paul said, "If an angel from heaven, Galatians 1:8, come taught any other gospel than that he had taught, let it be accured." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, it's tradition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I talked to a great man not long ago said, "Brother Bam, I can't I know that's right." He said, "But what can I do about it?" I said, "Obey it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I I have a prestige amongst our people." I said, "But I want a prestige with God to obey his word. &gt;&gt; You got to take your choice. Will you serve God or man?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But they get their organization, set these declarations in them, follow right down. The first time that was ever used is in the Roman Catholic Church. That's &gt;&gt; right. I want somebody to show me something different. I read history through, you know. So remember, that's a Catholic baptism. And everyone that's baptized that way is baptized into the Catholic fellowship. I prove it before the night's over, the Lord willing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you must come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the Jesus only. Now, there's plenty of fine men in the Jesus only church. Plenty of fine men in the assemblies of God, the church of God, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Catholic. &gt;&gt; But there's none of them in the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not a one of them. These individuals in there belongs in the church, but it ain't that denomination they got that makes them the church. &gt;&gt; Like man try to make it that way. It's wrong. Just a minute. We get down giving you some scripture in a few moments. Yes, to be active on earth you have to be born natural to be active and such a birth makes us wise as I have said see and we become smart intelligence our intellects gives us that but remember that that birth the very beginning of it is contrary &gt;&gt; amen it's earthly and contrary to the word of God foolish to God and to his plan ignorant to God's plan &gt;&gt; if it wasn't Nicodemus would have known more than Jesus knew about him. &gt;&gt; See it. Art thou a master in Israel. Amen. See where your denominations go. Where your great smart men who meet together and draw out their plans and set. Let me tell you this. Every time God sends a light on the earth on something on the scripture, they run right away with it. And as soon as that man's gone, they make an organization out of it. And as soon as they organize it, I want to ask any historian here present now or it's on tapes to come show me at any time that man, every organized the church had died right there and never did raise again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's contrary to God. &gt;&gt; It's contrary to the scriptures. Therefore, I'm against it. &gt;&gt; Anything that God's against, if God's in me, then I'm against what God's against. His enemy is my enemy. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His church is my church. &gt;&gt; His life is my life. He gave his life. He become me that I through his grace might become like him. &gt;&gt; We changed places. He become a sinner like me and died for me in my place so that I could be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you see where your denomination's got to already. We started. &gt;&gt; Amen. wise in the worldly wisdom but dead to God's plan. &gt;&gt; Now let's you back stop here just a moment. Adam was contrary to God's plans because he disobeyed the word tried to make himself a covering a religion. It failed and it's always failed what man tries to do. Nimrod was wrong. Kora perished. &gt;&gt; What were they trying to do? Make an organization. &gt;&gt; And after that, when they finally organized themselves, Jesus found them dead. &gt;&gt; Said, "You got eyes and you can't see. &gt;&gt; You got ears and you can't hear." Hey, said you're blind leading the blind. If the blind leads the blind, don't they both fall in the ditch? &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art a master in Israel and can't even understand what the new birth is. When if you would have kept away from them traditions and held on to the word, you'd have known that I was coming to give man new birth." &gt;&gt; You'd have known my day. &gt;&gt; If you'd have known Moses, you'd have known me. Moses spoke of me &gt;&gt; and he said I would come and here I am. And if I don't do the things that Moses and the prophets said I would do, then don't believe me. &gt;&gt; If I don't do the works of God, then don't believe me. But if you can't believe me being a man, and if you can't believe me because I'm a man and doing the works of God, believe the works for they testify of the things that I'm doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But then I ask today if he had lived on earth today, the assemblies of God had one, the oneness had one, and everybody would have a Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sure, their denominations got to pack the ball. &gt;&gt; See, if it isn't going, they're not separating brotherhood. I remember a little boy named little David. He's a man married now. I guess got a family. I remember when he first started, I went to St. Louis. I've heard little boy preachers that he get up and say Jesus a little boy born in a manger. Mommy, what was the rest of that? But not that little boy. He'd throw off his coat, tuck a text, and preach. But what was he? He happened to be a Jesus only. His father, Mr. Walker, belonged to Jesus only. While the assemblies couldn't stand that, they had to get them a little David while the rest of them had to get them a little David. And one time when the little boy was holding a meeting down in Florida, he called me, "Come down and help him." And brother Moore and I read the two pages of the front part of the paper with nothing but little David's. Every church had a little David. Oh goodness. Well, if a bunch of the elders of God had to recognize the gift in that little fella, he would have swept thousands of souls into the kingdom. See, tell him forget his tradition about man and this like that. God had a gift in his life. Use it. When divine healing was first represented, everybody had a feeling in their hands and could smell his oh my. &gt;&gt; They had to do it. &gt;&gt; Their organization was in the back race. See, you've got your organizations the head of the plan of God. You &gt;&gt; But God has his church going on just the same. &gt;&gt; A mystical body. &gt;&gt; You don't join that. You're born in it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wise and wisdom of the world but dead in God's plans. Tell me then, tell me then. You can tell them and prove to them that they are wrong by God's word and promise and still they won't see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can sit right down and take the word and show you that denomination is wrong. I can show you that creeds that you have today is wrong. See these church creeds. Sure it's wrong and they'll say, "Well, uh, we've been taught to believe this." You see, to my opinion, it's it's fodder. If you know what I'm talking about, cannon fodder, you know, that's right. They can't see. Jesus said, "You you can't see it. You might come to me and have life." There was Nicodemus, an honorable man, a great man, a bishop in his church, renowned man, loved by everybody and come to Jesus and know no more about life than a than nothing did. &gt;&gt; He was very ignorant of it. When Jesus rebuked him for it, &gt;&gt; but he was sincere enough to come. The rest of them wouldn't even come. They stood off with the high priest and with the bishop so and so and so and so, right? They stood off with them. rather taking in the traditions of their elders than to hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now you can tell them they won't listen to it. You can just exactly could you imagine I want to ask you something. I don't mean this sacriiggious now brethren says the tape. I don't mean this sacrilegious. Could you imagine me going out here and and a knot on the tree could ask me how in the world do you walk around like you do? I got life. I'm a knot on this tree. He can prove he's got life, but it's the wrong kind. If he wants to walk around, the only way he would ever be walk around, see, taste, feel, smell, and hear, if he could talk and say to me, and ask that, the only way he'd have to be born the same way that I'm born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll never understand it any other way. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if he's born the same way that I'm born, then he'll know the things that I know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yes, sir. You can't tell a knot of the tree how we move about and be active. You would have to receive our kind of life to understand it. Same with the spirit. The same thing is with the spirit. Or you can't understand it. &gt;&gt; There's no need of trying to figure it all out. Just come to him first. &gt;&gt; For except the man be born again, he can't even see the kingdom. He said that's understanding. You've got to be born again in order to know it. &gt;&gt; Well, you say I'm born again and deny the word. &gt;&gt; How can you be? Your own life gives you vindication of it. &gt;&gt; Your own group that you're joined with, birds of a feather, &gt;&gt; wait till we get down to those things in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; Comes by the spirit. How can you tell people things of the spirit that's not born of the spirit? You have to be born of the spirit to understand the things of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The Jesus said, "The wind bloweth where it listeth." I cannot tell which way it comes or where it goes. See, so is everyone born of the spirit, they can't tell you. A man that's born in the spirit don't take no thought. &gt;&gt; He lets God do the thinking. &gt;&gt; You think I could stand on a platform here, take a thought and tell a man back there, his name's John, go and he come from so and so place. He done this, he married another woman back there 20 years ago and he had children, but this woman he has to take this thing back and do that. You think taking thought I could do that? &gt;&gt; No such wisdom in this birth here on earth for that. &gt;&gt; It's beyond that. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has to come from above. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then when you're born of the spirit above, the life that was in him who did do those things said, "The works that I do shall you do also." &gt;&gt; Your birth has to be changed. You've been deceived. You might have spoke in tongues. You might have jumped up and down. You might have shouted. You might have done all this, that, and the other. You might have been a a loyal member. So was Nicodemus. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Hey, but he lacked the birth. And when you deny the word, try to place it somewhere else and do something to it and scatter it away like that. And Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Long as the gospel is being preached, these signs shall follow." &gt;&gt; Tell me the place where you ever tuck it away from the church. &gt;&gt; Show me the scripture where he said every just for so long. He said, "Unto all the world and to every creature. Yes, you'd have to receive the kind of life that he had in order to live his life. And when you see his life, then you will know his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. When he personal pronoun, not a thought, not an imagination, not a sensation, but when he, the Holy Ghost, has come, &gt;&gt; he will take these things that I've told you and reveal them to you and will show you things that is to come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the birth. &gt;&gt; That's a vindication that it is word. And when a man says he's got the Holy Ghost and deny the word of God and place it somewhere else, how can the Holy Ghost deny his own word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not show me organization in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Could you think of a businessman? Now, here's how far our church is behind. Could you think of a businessman that started up a business sharing it's a it's really a thriving business and he's got to get some help right quick and he go to a bunch of dead man corpses and saying would you come work for me that'd be no benefit to him &gt;&gt; that's the reason the organization never li rises again &gt;&gt; a bunch of dead &gt;&gt; unbelief &gt;&gt; congregating themselves together like Nimrod God like Kora, like down through the age. How can he never did use it? Never did use organization. He can't do it. &gt;&gt; It's already out of the will of God. It's passed beyond that. &gt;&gt; It's out of reach. It's out of search. &gt;&gt; How could you go to a man that couldn't move? Paralyzed head, hand, and foot. Tell him you want to run a foot race for you. Run this race with patience. Lay aside. &gt;&gt; How could he do it when the man can't move? He's paralyzed. &gt;&gt; You've got to get the paralytic off of him first. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he can run. &gt;&gt; That's what the organization needs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is the divine healing. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I hope I don't find sound critical. See, I'm not criticizing, but if a nail isn't clenched, it pulls out easy. That's why the Holy Spirit can't use a denomination as soon as it Remember, I believe that Martin Luther had the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Maybe not the portion it is today because it wasn't given out. We've been through this, you people of tabernacles, you're on the blackboard. But he did believe to God, and he that believeth has everlasting life. I never thought there's a person believe that like me until this morning you heard Charles Fuller as it was going down. He believes too that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The new birth is being born. The Holy Ghost is a baptism. All right. Now we find that this man has got to be born again in order to be active. All right. to be born of the flesh, then you have wisdom of the world and wisdom of the world obeys its fleshly teacher. &gt;&gt; Right? That's exactly why men that don't have the new birth and tell them the word of God, they'll obey their bishop, their presitter or their organization instead of the word of life. &gt;&gt; Why? It knows nothing else but that. Well, you know, someday I might be a presbbiter. Why? Nicodemus was a master. That's beyond a preset. That was beyond a a pastor. That was be a master in Israel. Yes. And he was a great man. He belonged to this group and know no more about God than nothing. See, only notice some history. What good's a historical God if he isn't the same today? &gt;&gt; What's good is a God of Moses if he isn't the same God today? Amen. &gt;&gt; What's good of a God that could save a man on a cross that couldn't save one in the same condition today? As I've always said, what good does it do to give your canary bird uh good seeds and vitamins to make him have good strong wings and fine feathers and put him in a cage? &gt;&gt; I don't get it. Try to tell him about a god of power and things and stick him into an organization. Don't even believe in such a thing. &gt;&gt; It's all out. That's the reason it fails. He's dead. You can't use it. God never used it. Just think the Holy Spirit never did at any time use an organization. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nowhere scripture or nowhere historical. If anybody on this tape or present can show me where the Holy Spirit took an organization and made a move in the earth, come tell me. &gt;&gt; I want you to tell me the history book it come from. &gt;&gt; You know it's not in the scripture. So I want you to show me the history it come from. God never used anything like that. He uses an individual &gt;&gt; always. &gt;&gt; All right. To be born of the spirit. Now to be born of the flesh and have wisdom of the world. The wisdom will obey its fleshly teacher. To be born of the spirit is to believe and obey the teaching of the Bible by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a man that's born by the spirit will obey God's word regardless of what any tradition tells him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just said &gt;&gt; you're reborn. That's the reason you see to belong to an organization. Put all your hopes in that. Now I don't say people in organizations not born again. Now I'll get to that in a few minutes. Lord willing. Sure they are. But they're individuals. Not the organizations born again. The individuals in there are born again. But the organization only breaks him away from God. That's all it does. Separates him. All right? Regardless of the flesh denomination teaches, the flesh it's always contrary to the will of God. To be born again means be birthed from above. Again means from above. &gt;&gt; I guess you know that. To be born again means to be birthed from above. &gt;&gt; A year. See, you can study it if you want to in the lesson. See, means a birth that's come from above because you've been born here. Now, to be born again, you have to be born from up here. &gt;&gt; To be born again, then that kingdom is so much higher than this kingdom, so much greater than this kingdom. So, this kingdom is foolish to that, and that's foolish to this. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I've often said, me and my wife here not long ago went over to get some groceries along a few months ago and we seen a woman had on a skirt. It was the strangest thing we'd ever seen a long time. Well, this morning, I don't say this sacriiggious. I heard one of the great famous organizations and my daughter and I was listening to the radios. We went to dedicate a church and a song they sang some kind of a something together by so and so some that classical singing. It sounds to me like women holding their breath till they're blue in a face. Man think that's singing that's squeaking. I like good old Pentecostal singing right from your heart. You couldn't carry a tune in a cold bucket but yet you're singing making a joyful noise to the Lord. I think that's spiritual. I like it. without holding your breath that you just blew in the face and die away and come back who you don't even know yourself what you're saying how you expect anybody else to know that's Jesus said we speak them things we know that's right that's right what we are do sing what we know in our heart what we feel and when they got through my daughter studies music and and she said brother she said that was really a classic I said yes but how many out of that choir of out of 50 people do you think that had cigarettes on their breath? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of that choir you think last night being Saturday night didn't have a little social drink? &gt;&gt; How many women in there had bobbed hair? &gt;&gt; How many had paint on when the pastor of the church said a few days ago, "God made a prettier world when he invented paint." when we know that this one woman in the Bible painted her face and God fed her to the dog. &gt;&gt; And we anybody that knows anything about the church and about heathens knows that paint is a heathen trait always been. &gt;&gt; And yet women do it. &gt;&gt; Men smoking, drinking, carrying on and stand there and sing voices like that. We'll get to it in a few minutes right here. All right. Belong to an organizational thinking with there's going to be the disappointment of judgment. My opinion to be born of the spirit is to believe and behave yourself in the spirit is to understand and believe with your heart that Jesus is Christ and this is his word. that no other words can be added to it or taken away from it without your name taken out of the book of life. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That was a strong one. &gt;&gt; If you add one thing to it in your tradition or take one thing from it, uh Christ said himself, your name shall be rubbed off the book of life. &gt;&gt; Now find organization, denomination in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You'll run from it. All right. &gt;&gt; Regardless of the flesh, denomination teaching is contrary to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Born again means a new birth from above. Birth from above. Then we are active in the things from above. Oh my. For it is himself acting in his word to you his branch to the vine. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the reason Jesus said, "If I do not the works of my father, believe me not." &gt;&gt; Oh, certainly. He said, "No man has ascended up to heaven, but he that come down from heaven." Watch him fix Nicodemus here. When Nicodemus, you know, they thought him being a man, he couldn't be God. And he said, and there he said, "No man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is now in heaven. &gt;&gt; That was too much for him." &gt;&gt; How could he, the son of man, come down from heaven, come down from heaven? Was the same that ascended up to heaven? And the same one that's standing here on top of this house talking to Nicodemus is now in heaven. Well, he ought to have seen that it was God. He's ominant present everywhere. &gt;&gt; But he and his traditions didn't know that he was a spiritual mind of the carnal mind. He couldn't catch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Who does man say I, the son of man am?" Some says, "Well, he's the son of David." He says, "Then why did David in the spirit call him Lord? Say, "The Lord said unto my Lord, set thou on my right hand till I make thy pose a foottool." How he is both root and offspring of David. &gt;&gt; He is before David. He was David. And after David Lord, &gt;&gt; he is a root and offspring of David. The Bible said so. Both root and offspring of David. How could he be his son? &gt;&gt; How could he be his law? &gt;&gt; The Bible said from henceforth they asked him nothing. I guess it was a good thing too. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Born again from above. Then we are active active in things from above. &gt;&gt; And for his life is in us, which is his word of vindicating the word itself. The spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The spirit minds the word &gt;&gt; and is active in vindicating the word. &gt;&gt; Now the spirit is not active in any denomination. &gt;&gt; It's not interested in making organizations &gt;&gt; because the spirit itself is contrary to the organization. The organization are looking for worldly things, the mind of the world and to make big temples and polished things and great polish organizations and polished preachers and so forth like that and the best class in the city where the spirit is trying to find honest hearts. &gt;&gt; Where the spirit is anxious to manifest and prove that every word of God is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can you How can the spirit work in an organization when it's denying taking creeds instead of the word? &gt;&gt; Can't do it. So you see it's dead. God don't go to them kind of places to find his a group of men that work for him because they're already dead. They're unbelievers in the word or wouldn't be in there. &gt;&gt; Now we are active in the things from above. Now the spirit minds the word. That's right. Because the spirit gives the word life. &gt;&gt; See, the letter killth, the spirit giveth life. Now, I was coming up today looking at the great beautiful trees out over the forest, the big hills, brown, yellow, evergreen dotted in them. I said, "You know what that is?" I said, "We just had death and God has put his bouquet out, sticking them up on the hills. It's a funeral. The life has gone back into the dust. God's just buried all these seeds out of the flowers and things, buried them back, and he's just bloomed out his bulky. He's looking up over the earth because his funeral flowers. &gt;&gt; But when the sun rises again, &gt;&gt; glory to God. &gt;&gt; That seed shall take life again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. The spirit is interested in vindicating the word. And if you've accepted tradition instead of the word, now you say, "Well, we believe it all, but brother Bram, I know we don't believe this." Then right there's where you stop. &gt;&gt; Chaplain told me one time and he at captain said, or I believe it was a major said, "Chaplap, go over there. There's a captain dying. He's been machine gunned." He want the captain was struggling. They pulled him into a Red Cross tent and he said, "Captain, you looked up through the gurgles of blood." He said, "Yes, sir. And he said, "Uh, you're the chaplain?" "Yes." He said, "You're a dying, captain." He said, "I know it." He said, "Are you a Christian?" He said, "I used to be." Said, "Where did you leave him, Captain?" He said, "You'll find him right where you left him." Correct. Captain said, "I can't think." The chaplain said, "You'd better. You haven't got by a couple more minutes while you're struggling." Mouth coming open, the blood coming from his mouth and ears, and machine gun bullets across you better hurry. Your lungs are filling up. And the captain began to wander laying there as he's struggling a smile come over his face said I know now said where did you leave him start right there he said now I lay me down to sleep that's where he left him that's where he finds him when your organization teaches something contrary to the word you leave him right there &gt;&gt; come right back because he's active in vindicating and making that word true &gt;&gt; that's what Jesus was always doing the will of the father see all right so see Nicodemus organiz ization understanding meant nothing to God. Now no matter if he is a big shot as we call it in the organization a master in Israel all of his learning and understanding didn't mean that when he stood before Christ only a rebuke to him. &gt;&gt; Now I imagine all the people say holy father Nicodemus holy father Nicodemus we bow to you sir but when Jesus he stood before God he rebuked him for his ignorance. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see what all that goes to. Forget it. Come on. Let's go to God. &gt;&gt; Right. All right. Neither did Kora's great understanding mean anything or Adam's each denying God's vindicated message. Now let's listen close now. We're going to get in some high waters in a minute. See each one of them. The reason that they got in trouble, Nicodemus, Kora, Nimrod, and so forth, is because they didn't recognize God's messenger with the vindicated word of that day. &gt;&gt; Now, anyone knows that. Uh uh we could stay on that a long time. But God predicts and says a certain thing will take place. Man makes organizations, gets man set just exactly. They believe there was a coming Messiah. All them Jews. Well my sure. But when Jesus come the way he did, they said that can't be him. &gt;&gt; They failed to understand the word. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus didn't come contrary to the word, did he? But he come contrary to the organization interpretation of the word. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't come contrary to the word. He come exactly with the word. But Kora failed to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all down through it's been that way. Now look, this message of the day just can't be something said we got the truth and we got this that. It has to be fortold in his word. And then after the word is brought forth, it has to be properly vindicated by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus was properly vindicated of God by the word. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you'd have known Moses, you'd have known of my days." &gt;&gt; Well, did the prophets speak of him. Well, all the prophets said what he was and yet it blinded them. They couldn't understand it. See, but Jesus was I don't I want to say this for the tape and for you too. See the messenger with the message of the day. Now, if you go the Seventh Day Adventist say, "We got her skip the Sabbath." You show me that in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Miss Eddie Baker said she had it. &gt;&gt; Show it to me. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Witness said they had it. Show it to me. &gt;&gt; Methodist say they got it. Show it to me. &gt;&gt; Baptist say they got it. Show it to me. &gt;&gt; Show me any organizations. I'm proving to you that they're everyone out of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Every one of them contrary. &gt;&gt; Teaching traditions of man instead of the word of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't know of one of them that would accept the things that's really written in the Bible the way it is. &gt;&gt; Right. But when somebody comes by and said, "I got the message of the day." He must properly be seen first and foretold to come. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist walked out there. They said, "Are you the Christ?" He said, "I'm not." &gt;&gt; Said, "Are are you the Elijah?" He said, "I am not." &gt;&gt; He said, "Who are you?" He could identify himself. He had the message of an hour. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the boson crying in the wilderness and said the prophet Isaiah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if my birth and life didn't compare with that, don don't receive me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus come was the same thing, &gt;&gt; same thing. The messenger with the message must be a fortold message by God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God speaking through this messenger vindicates that it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Do you hear it? &gt;&gt; Do you understand it? &gt;&gt; Understand it. It must first be thus saith the Lord foretold. &gt;&gt; And then the messenger with the message must be exactly what God said would take place at that time. Amen. Thank God for his word this morning. I trust that was a blessing to you. Amen. It just really food for my soul. You know, there's a statement brother Bannon makes in there that born again is found in St. John chapter 3. uh six and seven uh to be born again. That word again means above. I didn't know that until I looked it up in the Greek. That's what that means. We are born again. That means we're born from above. So, God bless each of you. And he says that God will meet you where you are. Wherever you left him, you can still find him if you just go where you left him at. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? So you can't get too far away. That he knows exactly where you are. You say, "I've gotten I've gotten away from you, Lord. I don't have that presence in my life." But just as he asked the captain, "Where did you leave him at?" And he had to look back and find out where he left him. And right where he left him, the Lord was right there waiting for him. And we're so glad for that that um sometimes we lose our way, but we can find our way back in his word. Amen. And I thank God for that. So let's stand to our feet and we'll sing song. Ask brother John to come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And it is time for us to God bless you. &gt;&gt; Only the name of Jesus can protect us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I'm wrong, praise God. Then we have more time to prepare. &gt;&gt; I'm right. Praise God. He has given us fear more disobedient something for being home. &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you, brother Rick. Thank you for those words. God bless you richly. The Holy Spirit helping you. Let's sing that song. The only real peace that I have. Dear Lord is in you. [music] Amen. For the only real peace [music] that I [singing] have, dear Lord, is in you. [singing and music] Oh, the only real peace [music] that I Hallelujah. Lord is in [singing] you with all my frustrations. I need you. I know [music and singing] I do. For the only [singing] real peace that I have, dear Lord, [singing] is [music] in you. One more time. Oh, the only [singing and music] real peace that I have, dear Lord, is you the only. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] I have dear Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] with all of my frustrations &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. [music] I [singing] know &gt;&gt; that I knew only [singing] real peace I have, dear Lord, is [music] in you. [singing] Let's bow our heads. Amen. Think about that. The only real peace that exists, oh Lord, is in you. You'll never have peace outside of him. And he loves us today. He loves you today. You right there, you sitting in your seat. He loves you. And the only peace that you'll ever have, the best deal that you'll ever receive is going to come from him. You'll never get a better deal, a better opportunity, [music] a more fair plan outside of him. And I pray [music] for you today. I pray that God will open up your heart, open up your mind to his love [music] to you today. He loves you, my brother. He loves you, my sister. [music] And just for a moment, why don't you just find that place in your life like the old captain did? Where did I leave the Lord? Where did I leave him in my sincerity? Where did I leave him in my praise? Why am I so upset? Where did the bitterness come in? Where did my ungratefulness? Where did that start to happen? These bad thoughts and my arrogance. Where did that where did that start? And Lord, let me find [music] that place where I missed it, where I lost you, where I left you. and I know you're there to receive me. I give you that opportunity this morning, every one of us today to think of that [music] as I pray. Lord Jesus, so clearly upon my heart, knowing [music] that you've made a way for us, all of us. And Lord, that way is your word. And so many times we try to climb over a wall when you have a door open for us just to walk right through. Why climb around? Why claw over? Why struggle when you've opened the door for us to walk through? Lord Jesus, I pray that we will receive you in the simplicity of your word today. receive the great message of God in this day. Lord, our souls will be filled and blessed. Every one of them from the little one to the oldest one among us. Lord, your portion, [music] you'll never deal with an organization and sometimes that organization is just one [music] person. You'll only deal with an individual that humbles themsself. Lord, that's what I want to be, Lord. I don't want to be tied to a group. I want to be tied to you and you alone, the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, may you bless every heart that's gathered here. Lord, we thank you for your Holy Spirit. We have no regrets, Lord, in following the Holy Spirit in our life. Please help us to do that even more is our prayer. [music] We just thank you. We ask your blessings upon each one. And as we continue [music] to worship you, Lord, may each one receive more of your grace and your mercy. In Jesus' name we pray. In Jesus name we [music] pray. Lord, if there's someone here that needs a touch in their body, may they lift up their hand to you right now and claim that healing touch. If somebody's discouraged right now, Lord, may they lift up their hand to you and receive the encouragement to receive the blessing of the most high God. May you grant it Lord that our needs will be met today as we come in Jesus name we pray. Lord we claim it now. Amen. Amen. The harder I soar in my dreams, the [singing] hard harder I fall. Brother John, help me sing that. And [music] sometimes I wonder if dreams were [music] were worth dreaming [singing] at all. But [singing] my disappointments [music] can keep me blinded and [music] blue. Not when [music] I am [singing] reminded of the sweet peace I have, [singing] Lord, with you. The only [singing] real [music] peace that I have. Dear Lord [singing] is in you. The only [music] real peace that I have, [singing] dear Lord, [music] is in [singing] you. [music] In all our [singing] [music] frustrations, I need you. I [music] know I do. The only [music and singing] real peace that I have, dear, Lord, [singing] is in [music] you. More of you. More [singing] of you. I've had it all. [singing] But what I need is [music and singing] more of you. All things [singing] I've had my fear and yet I hunger [music] still empty and bare.

[music] Amen. Our brother Sean is here this morning and he's calling on the [music] Lord Jesus to take him back where he's fallen from. He wants to find that place back in him. I believe that's a heart [music] desire for many that are here to find that walk with the Lord to go back where he should be. He wants his mother to come pray with him. Amen. How many can witness to this? The Holy Spirit wants us born from above. Not born from above. &gt;&gt; And how many want that in their life too? the Holy Spirit to take you where you're supposed to be spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you lost something, he'll restore it to you today. You can claim it right now in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us pray. Dear Lord Jesus, I lay my hands on my brother Sean and his dear mother. Lord, you heard his request, his testimony. Lord, you've been good to to them. You [music] blessed them. And Lord, you gave him a good job and Father, and he's gone astray a bit, Lord, in his prayer, [music] in his worship, in his time with you, Lord. And now, Lord, he wants to reclaim that in the name of Jesus Christ. And the family of God are standing behind him, supporting him, desiring the same things for him, Lord. And Lord, we encourage him, Lord, to keep moving forward in the good word of life. To keep moving forward under the anointing [music] of the word of God, Lord, that he's born from above, that you would lift him above all of the deception of the age and the [music] time wasters and all of the things that are not important. Lord, may the important things in life come into view, Lord, as he receives it, Lord Jesus, and each one that has that desire in their life and in their heart this morning. In Jesus name we pray, grant it, Father. Grant it, Lord. We receive it, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you. How I [singing] long [music] to be shut with God. Just sing it one more time. Shine [music] with God in the sea. secret place. There the spirit beholding his face power [music] to run. How I long to be [singing] shut with God. Amen. There was a line in one of the verses that Sister [music] Priscilla was singing this morning. Something along the lines, are you weary in the battle thinking that it was yours?
