is everything on okay fine thank you I would like to greet you all in the wonderful name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I'm so thrilled to be with you and I'm thankful to your pastor for allowing me to be with you tonight we have not met we have heard of one another being members of the body Body of Christ and uh it's good today that we are able to see one another and to fellowship with you all and I as you've heard I am from the United Kingdom in the city of Sheffield we have a group there and we would like to really appreciate the Lord for helping us to do the little part that we are doing to handun for that last one before we all go home but uh obviously I I am now British but I don't look British which is true because I am originally from Zimbabwe so I am much Zimbabwean and still Zimbabwean and will forever be Zimbabwean only that I am a born again Zimbabwe and which makes me I hope a blessing to all of you who are born again so I thank God that I some of you who don't know me may just want maybe just 3 minutes of knowing who who I am but my real identity will take us a while to explain because it was from before the foundation of the world but I thank God I was raised up in a Christian family my mother uh and father were both in the Methodist Church I don't know much about my father because he he died when I was just 3 years old and I'm just told he was just um a nominal Christian not too committed but my mother was very very committed she raised us up in the fear of God and I thank God for that so later on in life when I was about 20 years old I made my own decision to really be born again and live a victory glorious life in Christ and so when I did that it was 1977 I gave my life completely to God and had the victory the new birth and uh that same year I was led to the message of the hour and I always thank God that I came in in a very good year 19 1977 I think some of the oldtimers would know that a lot of people even left the message message in 1977 by failure to understand spiritual things but that's when we came in and straight away the Lord called me into the ministry I found my wife three years later we're in the same church all zealous young people and uh we just we just married and That Was 1980 and so we've been together ever since and we have have lived Happy Ever After and intend to do so until Christ comes and through life God has blessed us with seven children I think that's a great achievement trying to walk in the steps of Abraham the father of Nations seven children four girls and three boys and I'm so thankful to the Lord they are all married now got all their own their own families now and um uh where when I first started in the ministry the Lord led me to go to mutari which is a town in Zimbabwe right on the eastern border close to mosm so that's where I went there started the church with the help of the Holy Ghost and brothers who were also there God helped us to start that work there in that part of the country and the Lord just blessed the work so much it's uh it's amazing how the message out there in Africa still excites people and God is still calling and people still are responding to the call of the message even right now maybe now it's not so much in the cities but out in the country we have such a such a pool people are receiving the message and some of the Miracles and things are happening out there that's where God is is vindicating Mark 16 he says go preach the gospel all the well these signs shall follow and so many churches sprung from that little church in from 1981 when I went to mutari and um uh I Then I then uh uh later on also God helped us to go into mosek which is close to muari is right on the on the eastern border with mosic that's in the eastern part of of Zimbabwe so the Lord helped us to introduce the message there we're able to go into Mana a city which is closed and then into also chimo right into Baya and right now today the whole country the messages spread just like a wildfire and we want to really thank God for that and um um so later on after 17 years of pastoring there I am more on the Evangelistic calling I I I travel I preach and so on and so I felt a building to go back to Harari where I had started from and went and started the church in another part there and today that church is still there thriving and I'm I'm I frequent that church also even the church in mutari as the one who started the work I'm always looking and kind like overseeing it and sort of just seeing if things are going on and when we have conventions and things like that they always want me to be there and uh so I want to to thank God that over the years God has really blessed us 7 years I worked in Harari then 17 years ago I went to the UK the we had a few Believers that had left our country because of the economic problems there some relocated and so I also felt a burden just to help them out there and so God helped us to start a fellowship there in in sherfield and um that's where I'm now stationed so I want to thank God that is about it all I think I could I I could share so many testimonies also but we don't have much time being an evening service if I put in too many testimonies then I I won't be able even to say anything so I would like at least for you to know me by what I believe as well that's real Fellowship you know sometimes the testimonies are okay but they can be given by anybody sometimes people who believe strange things can share very very edifying testimonies sometimes so I think the word is most important don't you think so it makes us know one another better and appreciate one another and so I'm thankful I was preaching this morning in Phoenix um I mean um uh uh what's that little town there yes in Cottonwood and uh with brother uh uh Chris Long there and so we had to drive to this place for this service which really is nothing new for me my life has been just like that I would preach in mu in the morning and then drive 3 hours to Harari and preach again there so I would preach in the morning drive 3 hours preach again and sometimes come back to M on a Wednesday preach go back to harar for the Thursday meeting and come back to M for a Friday meeting and and then that has been my life so I am very comfortable with that but well that was when I was younger now I've got I've got 17 grandchildren 17 that means I've been around for a while and and and and and and so if I came in the message in 1977 and 20 years old you can figure how old I am 1977 when I came in I was 20 years old how old do you think I am I am quite an old man but because of the Lord he gives us new Strength amen I'm just I just turned 58 I mean 68 68 68 but I would pass for 58 I guess especially if I start preaching so the Lord bless you let's stand at this time I'll make sure that I don't take any more time than is necessary for a Sunday evening service if you have a request if you have a need I believe the holy spirit is here to to minister directly to our needs and the preaching of the Gospel is not complete without the healing of the sick without God manifesting himself in the power of his resurrection and he gave us the Blessed promise whatever two or three gathered in my name I'm in the midst of them and he says whatsoever things we desire when we pray if we can believe that we receive it in prayer God will give it to us so let us pray you can raise your hand if you would like to be remembered in prayer God sees your hand I see it too and if it touches me to know that you have a desire how much more does it touch our heavenly father shall we pray Heavenly Father our hands are raised up because we are needy people we pray that you meet with us tonight thanking you for the wonderful songs that have been sung thanking you for the open door from our pastor here Lord for me to be here tonight in service to you we thank you so much now Lord may you bless each one give them their heart desires that they will say from that day things changed and it was never the same again we want to thank you in advance for Healing The Sick we thank you in advance for granting the request of your children bless your word bless our fellowship forgive us of all our shortcomings father and fear us with your presence for we ask it in Jesus name amen I wish to read from Matthew chapter 16 and I would like to speak on the mystery of who Jesus is the mystery of who Jesus is we thank God that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God is finished so we can answer those questions the mystery of who Jesus is basing it upon the scripture in Matthew 16: 13 to verse 19 when Jesus came into the course of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist there some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he say unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated the fact that he was the son of the Living God is what prompted him to ask them who do men say that I am if he had not been the Son of God he would have not even asked them that question because there would have been no need to ask that question you would have been just a normal person but because there was a m history surrounding him he wanted to be sure that people had the correct revelation of who he was so he says who do men say that I the son of man am he was a mystery he was born in a mysterious way we know he was the seed of the woman promised from Genesis 3 where the Bible says they are put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed we know also that he was the Virgin born son of Mary who came by the Immaculate Conception as we read in Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 before they came together before Joseph and Mary came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost that's strange that's a mystery that doesn't happen unless there's something behind it some Supernatural hand so he was a mystery before Joseph and Mary came together Mary was found child with with child of the Holy Ghost it took an angel to come and intervene for Joseph could not just take Mary's story that she met an Angel that's how mysterious his birth was Joseph was about just to even put her away and then the angel had to come and say to him no don't do that on verse 20 of Matthew 1 for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost so he was born in a mysterious way and that's why he was asking who do men say that I am because he realized he came in a strange in a mysterious way and he wanted to be sure that they all knew who he was especially his disciples especially those who were predestinated especially those that he was coming to die for and to redeem he didn't want to miss their opportunity of redemption and salvation in him and so Matthew goes on to tell us that that this is what was written there um uh all this was done that it could be fulfilled spoken by the prophet that a virgin shall be with child and you shall call his name Emmanuel which is God With Us now in Luke chapter one when Gabriel came again to Mary Mary said how can these things be seeing I know not a man how can I have a child because Gabriel says you are going to conceive and bring forth a son and the angel on verse 35 answered and said the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and I want you to know today you may be having a difficult situation something that's you don't know how you can even go around it or about it I want to let you know that if the Holy Ghost comes upon you and if the Holy Ghost anoints you he will change the situation he was a virgin little girl that never been married never lived with a man how can these things be the answer was the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee let's allow the Holy Ghost to come upon us tonight when the Holy Ghost comes upon you he heals your diseases when he comes upon you he dissolves all your mind battles and all your questions and he makes you a completely new creature in Christ Jesus so the Holy Ghost shall over sh then watch what he says there and that Holy thing that Holy thing because the Holy Ghost is coming upon you that product will be a holy thing and that Holy thing sh that shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God now watch what the angel is telling telling Mary and watch what the answer of Peter was to Jesus Peter said Thou Art the Christ son of the Living God and Jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven but do you notice how that Peter's Revelation was in line with the word he he just did not say thou art the son of the Living God without any scriptural backing to that amen his answer to who Christ was was scriptural amen that's what Gabriel said that hold thing shall be called The Son of God and that is why he was a mystery because he was the son of a God who is a mystery God himself is a mystery and if he be the son of a mysterious God he also was mysterious and if you are a son is we are sons of God today who is a mysterious God it makes as also mysterious people will not understand us your neighbors will never understand you your unbelieving parents will never un understand you your workmates will never un understand you because you are a child of a God who is a mystery only those who are also Mysteries can understand you amen amen only Mysteries can understand Mysteries yes so who do men say I the of man what does the public say about me what's the public opinion about Jesus of Nazar now the public had different opinions some say you are John the Baptist and some say you are Elijah some say you are Jeremiah some say some are the prophet now those people who thought Jesus were Jeremiah missed their salvation those who thought Jesus was Isaiah they missed their salvation because Jeremiah was not a savior neither was Isaiah a savior those who thought Christ was John the Baptist they missed their salvation right there because John the Baptist was not a savior so how could Jesus save someone who thought that he was Jeremiah he could not do it and only Those whom he came to save the elected the predestinated the for ordained would be given by the Father the correct revelation of who Christ was public opinions this is why when he was active in his ministry the Bible tells us in John 7 on verse 12 and there was much memor among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people he always caused a stir in his ministry because he was a mystery in on verse 40 of John 7 it says many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet others said this is the Christ but some said shall Christ come out of Galilee hath not the scripture said that Christ cometh of the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was watch it on verse 43 so there was a division among the people because of him he always brings a division among the people the word will bring a division the message will bring a division Mysteries will always bring a division and guess what that's why we have so many divisions because people lack the revelation of the mystery of who Jesus Christ is there was a division because of him I like the scripture there was a division because of him John chapter 9 on verse 16 therefore said some of the phes says this man is not of God because he keepeth not the Sabbath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such Miracles that's in chapter nine now and there was a division among them again a division among them because the word will always divide unless you get a revelation unless you get the same Revelation the reason that you can receive me today and receive my preaching today is because we are standing on the same platform of the same Revelation the same message the same Prophet the same Holy Ghost the same anointing I can say something here we've never met I say something you can say Amen brother because we are just operating on the same level we are not strangers one to the other we were together before the foundation of the world we were together in the mind of God praising God our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world we've met before that's why we can have fellowship and rejoice together like this tonight so there was a division among the people uh because Christ was a mystery now let's go to John chapter 10 on verse 19 to verse um to verse 21 it says there there was a division therefore again that's the third time among the Jews for these sayings and many of them said he had a devil and is mad you see if you lack a revelation you will be so deranged in your mind so mentally deranged by lack of a revelation how can you think a man has a devil when he is casting out devil it goes to show that if you refuse Revelation you become mentally deranged say for example Jesus said baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost now a person without revelation will just go and repeat those words I baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost but father is not a name son is not a name Holy Ghost is not a name but because they refuse Revelation they become so mentally deranged to know that they are not baptizing in any name and there is no scriptural support of anybody who has ever baptized that way but they won't even listen to that because they have turned aside Revelation may God help us to receive divine revelation which is the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him if we lack wisdom let's ask it of God if we lack knowledge and revelation God gives it and when the Revelation comes it's not against the word if you say that is revealed to you that baptism in is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what you are basically saying is you have the correct interpretation of scripture amen if you tell me that you have a revelation of what happened in the Garden of Eden the serpent seed what happened there the original sin what you are telling me basically is your interpretation of the scripture is correct because any Revelation without scriptural support cannot be accepted amen we have to judge your Revelation by the scripture so Revelation really is the correct interpretation of scripture when you can precisely know what the Bible says about the godhead that's Revelation that's wisdom that's knowledge and when you have that that's the new birth it changes you completely and you cannot stop the holy ghost from flooding your soul because that opens the doors of God to pour himself into you and Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can never Prevail when something is revealed to you Satan cannot Prevail sickness cannot Prevail and that's why Jesus says I give you the key whatever you bind here will be bound in heaven upon Revelation all things are possible if it's revealed to you that God Is A Healer if it's revealed to you that God is a provider if it's revealed to you that you are a part of the Bride there's not enough Devils to stop you from becoming what God has said you are to become amen isn't he wonderful so there was a division again in John 7 John chapter 7 on verse 46 going down there the officer J answered never man spake like this man he was a mystery he was not born like other men that's why he could never speak like other men never man SP these people were sent to go and take him and bring him and apprehend him and arrest him and bring him here bound bring him want to examine him and when they went there they began to hear him speak instead of arresting in him they were arrested they were apprehended themselves they could not do anything hey never meant spe like this man and and and and and and the Pharisees were so were so were so upset are you also deceived on verse 48 he says but these people who knoweth not the law are cursed Nicodemus said unto them he he that came to Jesus by Night being one of them doth our lord judge any men before it hear him and know what he doeth they answered and said unto him art thou also of Galilee search and look for out of Galilee ariseth no Prophet the Bible says on verse 53 and every man went unto his own house there was no Fellowship after that service there every man went down to his own house when the service was over that day they could say God bless you brother and we will come again next next next service and here every man just went to his own house I believe it won't be like that today after the services over let's have some fellowship every man went to his own house they just could not understand who he was he was a mystery see how God works without a revelation you would never catch that Jesus Jesus though he was in Galilee but he was born in Judea and yet that did not need a revelation Supernatural something from above to just show you that he was born in Galilee you had just to go back to the records and search the history search the history talk to Mary you are living in Galilee yeah how many years all our life okay and then this man who is saying Jes Jesus how come he's living in in Galilee oh oh you know what happened we were he he was born during those days when Augustus Caesar had his Proclamation and forced all of us to go for the sensus if you remember and that's when we went there and just at that time I gave birth so he was born actually in Judea in Bethlehem according to scripture it was Bethlehem you know but you know what when the wise men came came to identify and and and and and and and and and Herold asked them and they did not go back to him my husband had an experience with the angel and he was told to take the child and the mother into Egypt because Herod wanted to kill the child really yeah you remember when the twoy olds and and were killed yeah I remember that they were looking for Jesus so really he was born in bethle but raised in Galilee and he spoke like a Galilean there was nothing judian about him his diet his preferences his talking his dressing his friends he was galileon 30 years later he says I'm the Messiah what you Messiah when you are From Galilee no we will wait for one coming from Judea so God will hide it from the wise and prudent but reveals it to babes such as Woodland I thank God the eyes of our understanding has been open and what did it the anointing of the Holy Spirit behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet he will turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers Elijah will come and restore all things and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God will be finished and we thank God because though we are in this last day of L this year but we are not a part of L this year we have received the counsel I counsel Thee I canel the to buy of me Silver tried gold tried in the fire and to have rainment so that your nakedness will not appear and our eyes have been anointed with the eyes oh this is beautiful God loves to hide himself God wants to hide himself so they were saying here judge search look out of Galilee ariseth no prophet and every man went to his own house Wow we must be so eloquent and able so knowledgeable about the message until those that try to convince us to leave the message those that try to convince us that all these things are not so and so on we should be so knowledgeable so eloquent about the scriptures to be able to silence them amen until every man will go to his own house without asking us any questions I like that when every man went to his own house they were shaking their head never men spe like this man this one went to his house they did not talk that day now in Matthew in Matthew chapter 22 verse 41 down while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ yeah what's your Revelation about me who do you think I am now you say when you say you have a revelation check it with the word revelation is correct interpretation of scripture amen let that sink if you say it's revealed to you there must be scripture to back up your Revelation am let me tell you something Peter did not even need to really make that question something farfetched you know he could have just said hang on Lord very good question that you have asked that who do we say you are just give me a few moments I'm just going to find out if Peter had just gone to where Mary was and say Mary what did the angel say when you gave birth to the master what did the angel say oh Mar would say oh yes the angel say that Holy thing shall be called The Son of God and could have come and say you are the Son of God by just scripture it was in the Bible baptism in Jesus name is not something which is being cooked up from somewhere it's biblical unto us a child is born unto us a son is given his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Everlasting father that same Sunday so the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ for the Bible says there is no salvation in any other name but the name of the Lord Jesus and in the whole book of Acts which is the record of the foundation of the church nobody was ever baptized entitled but when you reject Revelation you become mentally deranged you don't even think to think that AR Bishops and Bishops and people with degrees and Masters and they've written fces of what they believe this to be yet they don't they can't even see that nobody was ever baptized in titles until the Catholic church start they cannot find way Peter ever baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost they can never see where Paul did it but they still doing it and they are saying no we believe Jesus not Peter but the same Jesus said Peter I give you the key whatsoever you see without Revelation you just become so ignorant so ignorant and and and and so so uneducated and so unreasonable it's demon possession when when you fail to have a revelation which comes from the father let's leave that who do men say what think you of Christ on verse 42 they say unto him the son of David and they answered this way on purpose they didn't want to acknowledge he was the son of of God and they knew he was saying he is the Messiah some were saying he's the anointed but they didn't believe him to be the anointed so he says what think he of the Messiah the anointed when he comes who will he be said oh he will be the son of David what a wrong answer that answer was not correct Jesus did not Mark that correct he didn't take it correct no he did not why am I saying that there was a greater father than David if you want to call him son start on the highest Son of God but he had to come as son of David in the lineage of David for Redemption for kingship and all that and they to be son of men to be a prophet but you can't start and say is the son of David as if that's all Jesus then rebuked them and he say how then does David in the spirit call him Lord saying the Lord which is God said unto my Lord that's the Christ sit thou on my right hand till I make thy enemies thy foot St if David then call him Lord how is he his son you know like every man went to his own house the other time this time no man was able to answer him a word may God give us such a revelation of this message until no man will ever want to ask you anything people are telling us today well you leave the message there's nothing to it before you can even talk to them ask them brother where are you now going where are you now going who who who now is going to be your your Mentor who's going to be your guide who are you going to follow now that's when you will see them start to say well well well I don't know then if you don't know please don't talk to me about that the reason why I am in this message is I have this testimony to whom shall we go to whom shall we go tell me if this message is not it what what else you know what nobody can ever get me out of this message because nobody ever got me into it God revealed it to me by the Holy Ghost and you can tell me about all the negatives and put them up here I'll say I'll give you I'll give you a little cup because they won't feel a buet I'll give you a little cup and say put your negatives in this cup here questions that you have about the message put them I'll give you a cup they won't fill the cup and then if you want to talk about denominations I'll give you a drum a big big drum and say put that put the put the negatives of the of the of the denominations in the drum then I'll say you can have your drum I have my cup yeah because there is things that we will never be able to understand all right let's look at this imagine someone who was really against Jesus as being the Son of God maybe he was a phy and he was saying No this man is not this this is a child of Mary he's a child of Joseph this is a cover up it's a cover up they just not wait for their wedding it's a cover up I'll never believe it and then Jesus comes up and then he's arguing with them about the M about the word and about the law and everything else and while he's trying to prove himself to be God to be the son of the Living God then all of a sudden Mary comes in my son my son your father not that one Your Father Joseph and I your mother we're looking for you and there he was trying to prove he was the son of God that person would say a hear it from the horse's mouth here is here is the mother herself saying this is our product with Joseph and he is trying to claim he's the son of God God will always put stumbles stumbling blocks to Blind the eyes of those who are not supposed to see it and the prophet say some things he spoke them to throw other people out of the message God allows it to throw out some people so that the light will not strike them they are not supposed to be saved and will let some things happen so to those who really really wanted to to to to to find fault with Jesus they had firstand fand information from the mother that this is our son me and Joseph so there's nothing about Immaculate in this and how would you ever convince them that he was but you see to the predestinated god reveals it and I thank him for that so on verse 46 no man was able to answer him a word neither dust any man from that day forth ask him any more questions look how Jesus spoke because he was a mystery he was a mystery and in John 3:13 no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven that's that's talk that will confuse anybody there the son of man which came down from heaven Heaven which is in heaven so he was in both dimensions at the same time that was a mysterious person he was a mystery his birth being mysterious that Holy thing there he was a mystery because he was the mystery of God revealed 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into Glory he himself said in John 14:20 at that day that's this day the last day you shall know that I am in my father and you are in me and I in you brings it down to us together with him and Paul explains it in Colossians 1 26 and 27 even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is really Christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah hallelujah so you are right in it you are right in it you are a part of that mystery when we say what think ye of Christ and and we say he was the Messiah he was the anointed one the Holy Ghost anointed him remember he was born the Son of God but anointed by the D at his baptism the voice say this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and Jesus was a man anointed by the Holy Ghost you went about doing signs and wonders and miracles and you know what friends that same Holy Ghost is here tonight that same Holy Ghost is in me that same Holy Ghost is in you that makes you a part of deity that makes you a part of Christ that makes you a part of godliness that makes you a part of the godhead what thinky of Christ I'll tell you this today you are the mystery of Christ revealed as Christ was the mystery of God revealed that Christ in you you now become the mystery of Christ revealed what a blessed hope we have Christ in you the hope of glory and that day that's this day when the full revelation of the word Goes Forth when the mystery of God is finished by the seventh angel you shall know that I am in my father and you are in me and I am in you in the message Christ mystery of God revealed the prophet says paragraph 233 look Christ in you makes him the center of Life the center of life of the Revelation see Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ is the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ and Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing what God is trying to do you see so here we are friends Christ in US is the center of Revelation so who do men say I am after they gave all those wrong answers Jesus turned the picture around from the public opinion to the elect Revelation amen and friends let's turn the picture from the public opinion to the bright way of sin we would have never recognized the head of Christ Christ in that cloud on Mount Sunset had not the angel told the prophet to turn the picture to the right that picture was taken as a pyramid this way but one day the Holy Ghost told the prophet turn it to the right look at it in the right way look at it in the right mindset turn the picture to the right he turned and there was Jesus Christ so he says let's shift the attention from the public we've heard what the Pharisees the say and we know what the woman in the world said you see she was not a teacher she was not a preacher she was not a prophet she was not even holy she was a sinner but yet she knew who he was we know glory to God we know we know and I know and you know you may have your weaknesses you may have your ups and downs but you know you know when Messiah come he will tell us all these things amen we know this message is the word of God we know that brother Bram was a prophet to the end time we know it we know know it nobody can robe us of that Revelation she was not a teacher she was not a preacher she was not holy but she knew hallu I know when Messiah come I know when Messiah come and Jesus that excited Jesus it will excite him again tonight we know when Messiah come we know when the anointed one come we know when the son of God come Jesus says I that speak to you am he immediately she left her denomination she dropped her water pot she ran to the city come see a man come see a man who told me all the truth is not this the Messiah and the whole city came and they believed on Jesus isn't this beautiful yeah we know what the Pharisees were saying thou art thou art a Samaritan with a devil that's what they were saying you were all together born by fornication you you never came the right way you say and this is why you will find that don't try to measure Yourself by your own human standards of your Holiness and how much you are able to really keep the word and everything else that you'll be disappointed said because your flesh will fail you but the word buried in your flesh will never fail that word planted in your heart will never fail she was in a terrible condition she was leaving with the sixth husband she was in a bad state but she knew something aren't you happy you know something you know something you know what God has done in this gener ation you know that the pillar of fire has appeared again you might not be so good a person you might not be as Victorious as you want but you know something I thank God that I know something I thank God I know something I thank God I know we are in the last days I thank God I know that Rapture can happen any time I thank God I have a revelation of that this message here will see us through into the Rapture I thank God for that I know I know know something and I know what I know I know and I'm not going to let the devil Rob robe me of what I know and what you know keep knowing it'll save you hallelujah amen isn't this beautiful here yeah we know when Messiah cometh here I'm I'm I am here that's fine so but these Pharisees here here is a sinner he knew he knew that Christ was was Jesus was the Christ he says we know when when Messiah that's Messiah the prince the anointed one and then the Pharisees no you are a Samaritan with the devil and you were born in in in in in fornication you you cannot tell us anything and all that they did not only say he was a Samaritan they said he was mad he's crazy and they also did not say only that they said you were casting out Devils by B zebra the prince of devils men they just splashed every name on him which was so negative see that's what they're trying to do with this message here but show me any man today who can stand and preach and then after he preached then he demonstrates what he was talking about by saying if what I have said is the truth let the Holy Spirit Come and demonstrate the same we don't have that we don't have that that was unparal an equal and it was a special gift to call us Eagles of the end time and to prepare us for the Rapture you know you may not believe this but I think every preacher must stand for his conviction you may not believe it but you better know who I am so that maybe next time if I say I'm coming you won't attend I sincerely believe the message that we have I see you're waiting for the bombshell you you are waiting for me to say what I was saying yeah I believe the message that we have is as essential as the Bible is essential now you might have a different opinion I still love you don't fall out on me but I'm saying that's my conviction you ask me why I believe the message we have is as essential as the Bible is essential I'll tell you because major prophecies major scriptural Prophecies of the end time which are in the Bible are fulfilled by this message which means the message is a continuation of the Fulfillment of the Bible which means without the message you won't have enough light to understand the Bible oh I like this I like this you want to be able to understand what the White Horse is what the red horse is what the black horse is what them Thunders are all about you will continue baptizing in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost because you don't have the light but the Bible says it shall be light in the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find in the days of the voice the mystery of God will be fished yes I agree with you the message is not the Bible or it is not the Bible it's not the Bible it can never be the Bible but it's as essential as the Bible because without the message you just have wisdom of men intellectualism and that will produce organizations and denominations which is men arguing no we better face it the Bible is a product of prophetic utterances this is a product of prophetic utterances Moses spoke it became the word Noah a prophet spoke it became the word Jeremiah Isaiah all of them that became the written word but now that word spoke talk about the coming of Elijah to restore all things come on church that word Elijah them people there the Malachi and and and and and and the Zachariah the the the Isaiah they spoke about the coming light so when that light comes you need all of it that's why when the angel came down with a open book and the Thunders uttered their voices it goes to say in the days of the voice these things will be finished and then it says God take that book go take that open book eat it up eat that Revelation which is coming up there eat what the seven Thunders haveed let make that your daily bread lovest thou me Peter lovest thou me Simon feed my lambs and you cannot feed them with chicken mesh of some denominational Creeds and dogmas you feed eagles with the carcus of the word of God for where the carcus is where the hidden manner is where the spiritual food in due season is there will the Eagles be gathered together oh brother come and dime Jesus told his disciples come and die oh isn't it wonderful e the book yes so is is he now shifts from the my time is going he shifts from the public opinion I want you to know this let's never follow public opinion follow your Revelation that comes from God which Compares with the word shifted it from the public he says whom do you say that I am turn the picture don't worry about what the public is saying don't worry about the negative things about brother Bram God does not confirm his word by public opinion no it's a revelation it doesn't confirm it by public opinion it's got to be revealed to you you know what if you are convinced by somebody that this message is correct somebody again will convince you out of it but if God has convinced you you know the Bible says they shall be taught of God they shall be taught of God when the Holy Ghost teaches you when God reveals something to you you did not get it by arguments you never won an argument about the topic the subject it was revealed to you and the scriptures were just aligning in that way no one can shake you from there turn the picture so he comes to the disciples why because in Luke 8:10 unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God you told me what they saying out there but who do you say I am because unto you it is given you are the bride you are the predestinated because the mystery is predestination oh yeah that's the mystery predestinated if you you are not predestinated you are out of the picture because you were never in the picture amen I like that one you're out of the picture because you were never in the picture but if you were from the beginning in the picture nobody can take you out of it you were in God's mind you were a part of God you were the thoughts of God you were in his mind he thought about you how can anybody pull you out no one can plock them out of his hand and if God thought about you you will be in this message until the Rapture you will make it for the Rapture nobody can ever no hardship no trial no difficulty nothing no sickness no disease no divorce no nothing no temptation will ever move you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus a revelation anchors you a revelation puts you on a solid foundation on a rock let the winds blow let the tornadoes blow let the bers come but on Christ the solid rock I stand who do you say I am he's turning to the elected Peter come on Peter come on who do you say I am you are the chosen ones i' I've come for you I've come to lay down my life for your sake who do you think I am and Peter just without thinking but he gathered up all that he had heard all that he knew thou are the Christ son of the Living God Amen and the moment he said that Jesus also said to him you tell me who I am then I tell you who you are hey you get a revelation of who he is he also tells you your position in the body Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail when you know who he is he then reveals to you your position in his body amen glory to God when you know who he is when you know the word the message has been revealed to you you also see your name in that message you see your position in Christ you see your placing as a son hallelujah amen glory and so he says Thou Art the Christ and say blessed blessed art thou Simon why did he say blessed that thou he Jesus did not just did not just say things he was the word come on he was the word word whatever he said was scripture so he turned blessed that thou Simon why was he saying that he had said but blessed are your eyes in Matthew 13 on verse 16 blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear so when Peter saw that this is the Christ he had to receive that blessing it was already pronounced blessed are your eyes and blessed are your ears for your eyes can see and your ears can hear so you know what friends you are blessed as you're sitting there you are blessed you are already blessed many times we say God bless you and I tell them I'm already blessed thank you for adding but I am already blessed thank you for adding it on but I am already blessed blessed are your eyes in the message Christ mystery of God revealed okay let me close here now so that I do not wear you out you know um I don't want to speak more than this hour so in Christ's mystery of God revealed he says the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people paragraph 144 secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is the bride that he might live in the people 154 paragraph 154 First to express himself completely God in Christ paragraph 155 second to have the [Music] his rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them paragraph 160 God expressed in Jesus Christ who was B Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of godhead bodily 161 now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church oh please loved ones don't belittle yourself you are not big but the one who is in you is greater than all your mistakes greater than all your problems your enemy is not just your enemy he is God's enemy he says if you obey my voice I'll will be an enemy to your enemies I'll be an adversary to your adversaries and he goes on in that message to say what then is the new birth what then is the New Birth well brother brandham what is the new birth he says it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not because you joined church or you shook hands or done something different or you promised to leave by a Cod of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you it's Christ in you that's the Revelation that the church was built on paragraph 496 but this his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride why do you hung a church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let somebody else you you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know way down in your heart you are thirsty you are hungry is God trying to reveal it to you the Revelation you know Christ excuse me Christ is that seventh seal we know it I'm closing on this statement Christ is that seventh seal which we know when the Bible was talking about the first seal second third there were symbols to each and every SE but on the seventh seal there was no symbol it was a mystery and Christ himself is a mystery the seventh seal is a mystery and what did he say about that servant seal he says here now we find that the Sixth Seal has been open opened to us we see it and we know that the seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until the hour arrived the public could not know who Jesus was they saw him as Jeremiah they saw he as Isaiah that's the public that seventh seal the coming of the Lord is not BR to the public but to us we know that's the bridegroom coming to claim his bride remember friend the prophet says watch that seven seven is always the mystery watch that seven that's the Finish that silver when boas was giving Ruth the measures of Val how many measures did he give her Bo measured out six measures of body is that right you can check it but that's what it is I believe he measured out seven measures of B to Ru watch that that seven he says that in Souls that are in prison now the seven is always the mystery that's Christ he was a mystery you are Jeremiah he gave B was did he a type of Christ gave Ruth six measure where was the seventh measure it was a mystery it was standing right there the one who gave the first second third thir fourth fifth measure was going to be Ruth's husband the seventh measure stood there before Ruth as a mystery she received six measures of B that seven was a mystery it was b as himself he was going to be redeemed watch when the water pots were put before Jesus how many water pots were put six water pots where was the seven watch that s it's always a m Jesus himself says if any man thir let him come I will give him the Waters of life he was the seventh water water pot as a mystery and when the woman at the well was discerned the heart secrets were disclosed he says you've heard how many husbands six now all these things are not just that seventh seal is typed from the from Genesis amen you can find that seventh seal there she had had six husband where was the Serv it was a mystery the one who was standing there telling her who her first husband was who the second husband was who the third husband was was to the sixth that was going to be her seventh husband the spirit of bridegroom but he stood there as a mystery watch that Ser that's Christ he was a mystery he came and he revealed the first seal the second seal the third seal the fourth seal the fifth seal and the six still when he came on the seven he went into Parables he's not brought to the but the same one who was revealing that first second third to the sixth was none other but Jesus Christ himself the seven SE because all those seals are revealed at the time of the seventh seal remember how many times did they walk around Jericho seven times and on the seventh day they did seven round and on the seventh round the walls just mysteriously fell down you know what I have enjoyed speaking to you tonight I will see you when God Wills I hope you have
