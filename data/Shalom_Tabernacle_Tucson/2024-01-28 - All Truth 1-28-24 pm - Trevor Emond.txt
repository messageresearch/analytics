Lord and he's still in the good oldfashioned way and uh so good to have him with us we use his the Lord has given him a little study in the church ages that he did some time ago and our church uses that in the Sunday school as a not a curriculum but it's just been a study guide and brother Joe said it's been a blessing to them and that's the fruits of the ministry of our brother here that's with us and sometimes we just thank the Lord that somebody did it we can say it should have been done but somebody did do it and that was that would be our brother here and we' like to welcome him to the platform tonight he's um works out of a church there with brother Nathan Bryant is a pastor there in Jeffersonville Church of the open door and he's one of the ministers in there Works in them he's

chapter 16 we'll read our scripture and and um then uh pray and then you'll be able to have your seats and then we can do some some more pleasantries maybe before we get in so John chapter 16 verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and I'd also like us to turn to Revelations chap 10 and verse 7 but in the days of the voice you don't need to turn there you know this we're just going to we're just you can recite it with me but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets amen can we just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we want the spirit of Truth this evening to come and bless us Lord in your presence um that you would open our eyes to see you in a greater way Lord Jesus every service Lord not because it's me or anything but father just every service we have come to you Lord asking Lord that you would open our hearts and our eyes and open our ears to hear Lord what you have said to us Lord and and and that that your word lord it's already been restored but father may it be quickened and understood and Lord your Prophet told us to pray for Revelation more than anything in our lives so father tonight Lord just we're we're we're finding ourselves in obedience to the word saying father would you reveal more to us Lord grant more Revelation to us as we sit in your presence oh God and we we we lord we we'd invite you but father I I know that you're already here Lord God the atmosphere of your Holy Spirit your presence is with us because you promised it Lord yes L and father now we just want to say we give this to you and we praise the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ in whose name we pray amen amen you may be seated so we had a lovely service at the reservation there in Stan Carlos this morning just a nice presence of the Lord and and we thank the Lord for that and so as brother Israel said I'm brother Trevor Eman and um I've been ministering over 20 years now was at the Brenham Tabernacle for about 17 years I was Sunday school teacher there um the book that he was referencing was basically what I did was tried to create a lesson for every Sunday and when I got through teaching through the church age book my idea was to slap all those lessons together and create a book that was simplistic thinking um four years later I was done and you know um brother Nathan helped me edit it sister Holly durksen up in Canada was uh really good at editing she found all of the many misspellings and definitely humbled me and and so that's that's wonderful we need those people in our lives and so but I I yeah I hope it was a blessing to you if you wanted a copy not just have the Sunday school teacher having a copy I'm not selling right now but just so you knew if you wanted it you could get it at message teer.com but that's fine not the message teer just message teer.com so um yeah so been preaching for about 20 years and and uh and uh my wife and children back home I have three wonderful children serving the lord that the Lord has given me and we're just super super blessed amen so all right well I'd ask if there was any questions but that might be awkward for you to say brother Trevor can you tell me about this so let's just dive into the word of God together your smiling isn't that wonderful we all just feel relaxed and comfortable and we can just look into the word of God As I said maybe in the reservation this morning my my how did I you know what did I what do I know where do I come from what's I I learned this so I spent a long time listening to tapes and so I'm going to just try to say what this said and and and not add my own little spinner color or anything like that maybe my own creative way of portraying a a truth and I think that's what a the job of a minister is supposed to be is to connect his own life to the word and and and try to try to present it that way so I want to take a title of all truth this evening and and um as as we read there that the spirit of the Lord um there in John 16 when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth now we we we we recognize that this is part of the function of the message because as we read in Revelation 10:7 there there that it cannot be disputed biblically that there were Mysteries that needed to be finished there were truths that were there baked into the scripture that that you know there's there's no one coming along and adding anything extra to it so that no there were truths already presented in symbol form into the scripture but yet the the knowledge the truth of that the full understanding and revelation of that was not yet known and that's why it tells us that that the in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger truth would come to us that we would have these Mysteries unfolded and finished before us so the spirit of Truth one of the one of the things that is being spoken of here in John chapter 16 necessarily must be then inclusive of Revelation 10:7 because this is something the word says is going to happen and if the spirit of Truth guides you into all truth then what this message must be doing is a part of that of bringing us into all truth are we together amen so so it's not about the messenger as much as it is about Jesus Christ being made known and unfolded to us but you know I found that there's young people that we have you know and and and amongst us many times and you know I've been I don't know why I'm even going here but it's just on my mind and I feel like we should so here we are praise the Lord but but you know I I I liken into it in our church we have some older brothers that were in a in in Pentecost until they came to this message and and and and so you know if I were to be preaching and I'd be like praise God we had a prophet to call us out of denominations hey I know that's a triager phrase for for for for you know brother Hoover I don't know if you know him but I could say something like that and brother Hoover in our church he'd be like oh praise God and he'd just you know he'd be in the back they're just oh thank you Jesus you know and and and some of the young people be like why I mean it was true what he said was good but I mean it wasn't that good and why is that well because that young person they their parents may have never been in a denominational church so a prophet coming to call them out of denomination just doesn't mean as much to them because the lived experience that they have isn't you know isn't resonating with that you know what that brother's trigger words right so so what we have to do then is we have to begin to recognize where the day that we're in that that that that the youth are are needing to see this truth but they're needing they they don't just need the words they need the meanings of the words right they need to connect with you know they need to understand what it means to be drawn out of denomination you know four generations after the children of Israel come out of come out of Egypt if a preacher would have gotten up to say praise God he sent us a prophet to deliver us out of Egypt the Taskmaster whip has no more effect on you and I can imagine some of the young people you know 80 years after Moses hey uh I didn't do so good in geography uh where's Egypt what's he talking talking about man I don't even what's a Taskmaster that's right I ain't been whipped in my life of course the Taskmaster whip has nothing on me so so we need to begin to understand when we're talking about truth being revealed to us we we need to understand that we have got to connect with that truth these words are never going to change and thank God we have them printed down but even more than that thank God that the voice has been captured on tape so that we can hear the inflection we can we can understand the meaning that in which way he is speaking it because we have and but we've also got to begin to understand the context that's being that it's being given in so that our hearts can connect with the truth amen so that you young people who've never like you maybe have never even set foot in a denominational church but yet you need to understand that your heart needed to be delivered from from a denomination that's right because every single one of us man you you know we we want to drift into acceptance yes you want a group of people to accept you yes sir yeah you do like we all want that man you know and if I can just get in a nice cozy little group of people that accept me and love me for who I am and you know ah it's just so nice and we can just sit there for a while and what have you done you've just created yourself a little denomination because the first person that comes around and it's like that's true you know you guys have this nice little group can I come in well you're kind of different though I'm not we've got a nice Dynamic going here and if you come in it might change the dynamic and so I just don't know you bunch of little denominational you know it's true you and and so this is what the prophet is speaking to us is that he's come to take us out of denomination but that doesn't just mean Pentecost that means a spirit of denomination of which your own sinful nature would love to just bring you into your own little one of those but you've got to become you've got to recognize what the prophet is speaking the truth that he's bringing out is a message of restoration to restore you to what they had on the day of Pentecost which was that individuals came in contact with a mighty God hallelujah so that's what this message is doing is this message is not bringing us to a place of you know better than Pentecostals that's right but harder but think of the pride you can have when you're better than the Pentecostals and it's harder wait no one's laughing at that one I don't did that did that land a little too hard on now too soon maybe you know what's going on so we we begin to understand something here right is that we've we've we we sometimes have a problem what the truth is saying and then and then people begin to come along you know and you you know maybe you have a minister come in and he gets real excited and he says something like you know oh what was it that I was going to say on that part um oh that this message is Christ that's a really offensive statement to some people maybe some of you here were offended by that and and you know what that's okay that's all right we'll tell you why you shouldn't be brother George maybe you need to go in the back no I'm just teasing brother but but so maybe sometimes you know you begin to you know maybe there's young people here maybe there's old people here who knows you know when we begin to say you know we're quoting the prophet oh brother brandham said brother brandham said brother brandham said and at some point in time the young people begin to be you know you know what excuse me isn't this supposed to be about Jesus cuz it sounds like it's about brother brandham because you're like brother brandham said brother brandham said Thank God and that brother Trevor a that what you've been doing for the last 10 minutes yeah 10 minutes like Prophet Prophet prophet Prophet Prophet this message is Christ can't Christ just be Christ now I'm making some people real uncomfortable don't worry it'll come back around because what we begin to do unfortunately what can happen is we can begin to the problem is is when we begin to create a difference in our minds between the message and between Christianity and we don't see them as as as integral to each other when we don't see that the spirit of Truth necessarily must be that Spirit which accomplishes and manifests Revelation 10:7 yes sir there is no other way to slice that one the spirit of Truth bringing you into all truth must be the spirit that comes in the last day and reveals all the mystery or that must not be truth one of the two but it has to be the spirit of Truth so then what we're what then what we're saying is all we're saying is is that there had to be a guy to be the one that was that messenger there had to be a guy that was the one to restore that faith that said would be restored because Peter tells us in Acts chapter 3 that Jesus is not coming back until the days of restitution which is the same word as restoration be accomplished so if you want Jesus to come back then you need the guy to come and restore yes sir I want Jesus to come back lord send the guy send him Lord to bring to to to by the spirit of Truth bring that truth restore these things that my eyes can be opened to do what to see you Jesus and that is why God sent us this prophet was that we could see Jesus because the devil's intention since the beginning of the Gentile church was to well obfuscate is the word that comes to mind but I better use another thank you brother but but maybe I should to to make the the the waterers cloudy and muddy so that you couldn't see Jesus correctly that now we do see through a glass Darkly but because we have Revelation in our day the waters begin to clear and we begin to see who he is and so that is what we're saying about this message is not that it's better Doctrine than Pentecost it is but that's not what we're saying that's not the point we have not become a more Elite group better revelated thank God he sent a prophet now I understand seals I can go in any Pentecostal church right now and say you know um what chapters uh in Revelations are are the Seven Seals in and they'd be like the what see how much better I am quick test message trip no I'm not going to ask you where the Seven Seals are in the scriptures it's Revelation 6 start there but anyway that's not the point it's not that we become more Elite than the Pentecost it's that Jesus Christ himself who we say we're looking for is now being revealed to us in a better light in a greater way and when that happens we can see and know him in the way that he wants to be known and when we know him in that way I can tell you the way this message portrays Jesus Christ to you and I because of its Doctrine specifically and we're going to get into that is is the is the Jesus Christ that you can know in love personally and without message Doctrine the Jesus Christ that is presented by modern Christianity is absolutely confusing and you say okay we're going to we're you're going to show us that brother CH my intention tonight in more time than that timer's giving me is to is to build a picture of of the denominational view of Jesus Christ without the message Doctrine and to use deep message Doctrine to present to you a picture of Jesus Christ and and and then I'll just say you choose you you choose which one you want because it's going to be so that the comparison is going to be so you you would be no one would choose that that's that's bold brother Trevor well praise the Lord Okay so taking this thought out of is this the sign of the end sir from 1962 in December 30th the seventh angel is winding up all the Mysteries that's laying loose ended all throughout these organizations and den denominations now let's stop there for just a moment there there are there are Mysteries back one slide there are Mysteries laying loose ended all throughout these organizations and denominations nowhere are we saying that denominations had no truth they just didn't have all truth so so so there are things that they had right and praise God for that right and we stand on the shoulders of things they had right brother brandham didn't spend a whole lot of time you know talking you know going through the basics of Christianity per se he he he moved on because we he was already preaching to a people who understood those things so so so we we're standing through to some degree on the shoulders of that but there's Mysteries that are loose ended they're not perfected and that will be you know and and that'll come into play as we talk about this because if you have some of it but not all of it it can really skew the picture but the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery okay so so this this this thought that brother bram's going to be taking is we're going to go here in just a moment to Matthew Chapter 13 you can begin to CH to to turn there but Matthew Chapter 13 and you will we he's taking this from there where in his scoffield Bible it talks about the mysteries of the kingdom and then he begins to read the Mysteries that scoffield has listed in reference to that and then he will begin to reference Mysteries that his ministry has then brought out to us now I I I will say this is before the seals so there are some Mysteries that the seals kind of wound up but one of the things the seals did was was show brother brandham that this is Absolut like he is like look that's why I've always preached that he didn't start preaching it differently after the seals he just realized it's happened I really am Revelation 10:7 like he like it happened it's fulfilled we're not looking for Revelation 10 to be manifested it's done so so Matthew chapter 13 verses 10-1 17 if you want to go there because I think that's very relevant for us so Matthew 13: 10-17 the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables and he answered and said unto them it's because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given so this is what this is the the relevant section here the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but the disciples are saying why why do you not why aren't you speaking more plainly he says well it's given to you know but to them it's not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he has um do you have any water Levi no no no no no no no no no do you personally right now have any water you don't can you have can you hold on to that for me right now this scripture right here has anybody ever thought about this scripture and thought you know uh Lord that's not fair now just take a little quick drink here it's got electrolytes in it do you have any water I don't would you like some say yes I I need you to say yes you want water you at some point by this time tomorrow you will you will you will need water you would like some water but you do not have any right now okay thank you I have water that's right and now I have two oh you don't even have any right now but if you did have less I would take it away that's scripture right there Jesus said that that was very Christian of him wasn't it that was really funny right there anyway therefore speak I to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not don't worry I'll make it make sense in a moment neither do they understand and in them is filled by the prophecy asias which sayth by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive for this people's wack heart is waxed gross their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see your ears for they hear for verily say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them so I want to take you now back to verse we we need to go back to verse 11 here we need to go back to this question because the disciples are saying why do you speak to them in Parables Jesus says it's not given it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given now let me ask a question about Jesus for a moment does did Jesus did Jesus did Jesus will that all the world should be saved and no one should perish did Jesus love the entire world then why did he treat one group of people differently than another group of people because that seems kind of arbitrary because if Jesus loves all of them and wants all of them to be equally saved but yet he treats one group of people differently than another group of people wait doesn't it doesn't Your Love Actually mean Jesus that all the people are one people and so I want you to imagine you know maybe you have a Baptist friend or you know Pentecost some denominational friend we won't pick on one denomination forgive me if you're Baptist and and so just just any denominational friend that's just a Christian any Christian friend maybe they're non- denominational denomination and you know they're a Christian friend and I want you to bring them to the scripture and I want you to ask in your mind you have a you know conversation with them in your mind and you I want you to role play how this conversation's going to go ask them why does Jesus speak to one group in one way and into another group another way and the answer is like well well it says right there it's given to them know the Mysteries but not to this other group why is like why was it given to one group but not another group in other words what we're asking is is for Jesus to to be righteous for Jesus through his love though he loves them all equally for him to treat one group differently than another group there has to have already been a valid reason in the word for him to do so so and so you can ask your Christian friend where do you find that in the word that Jesus is not being arbitrary here but that Jesus is acting perfectly consistent because you want Jesus to act consistent amen you want what Jesus says to mean something so when Jesus says he loves the whole world he wants doesn't want anybody to be saved I want to be saved so I want to know how can I be a part of the group that sees and gets more water and if Jesus isn't acting consistent that I'm like no no you you want me over here or did you want me over here I don't know what to do and now I'm nervous and now I'm anxious and I have no idea what must I do to be saved that's good so there's got to be a way that Jesus is consistent though though though he's treating one group one way so so the ask the question that we have to ask ourselves is where in the Bible was two groups ever created within Humanity so the answer is we have to go back to Genesis chapter 1 and 2 and three and then we come to a doctrine that we call it's a message Doctrine we call it serpent Seed where the reality of the situation is two groups of people have now come come to come into being so let me ask you a question Cain was his name ever on the book of life he was never in the original plan of God his name there there are people there's four four groups of people you probably heard this in the Sunday school class that brother Joe taught when you were in lessons 50ish um somewhere around in there and and and you learned about the four groups of people in The Book of Life those whose names are on in the Lamb's Book of Life and those whose names got blotted out and those whose names got added and those whose names were never on it and Cain would have been one of those names who was just never on it cuz he was he was the son of Satan I mean that's it's just the way it is and all of his descendants were not it was not in the original Mind Of God that was not how man was supposed to come that was supposed to be created and and you know by Spoken Word and and and so so now we have two groups of people though Jesus can love all of them equally he yet knows there's one group that has the ability to hear what he is is saying because they're his children and another group that cannot cannot understand a thing he says because he is not their father and their father is the father their father is a father of lies and they can't tune their ear to truth because they're so used to hearing lies oh we should be careful on how many Lies We Tell so so so now we have two groups of people and so you can't look at Matthew chapter 13 and have it make sense if you don't understand the doctrine of serpent seed the picture we begin to build over here is that without this message that we have today what we understand about Jesus is that he arbitrarily speaks to one group one way and another group the other way so that one group won't be able to hear and another group will and who I want you to be Lord can you put me in the one group how do I get into the one group Lord I don't know and your character seems a little fishy right now even though you're saying you're the one that loves everybody is that fair but how do you understand Matthew 13 if you don't understand serpent seat this Bible begins to break it doesn't make sense to you why would Jesus do that you you we we have no answers so I want to look so so with that kind of as our as our our our are beginning to understand the idea of what we're picturing here and to begin to understand the problems that can come up if we don't understand message Doctrine I want to go through now these doctrines that brother brandham begins to say so in paragraph 255 he says that's some of the Mysteries that's that list that he just read from Scofield's notes that's some of the Mysteries this Angel's supposed to wind up all the mystery all the mysteries of God may I say this with reverence not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God and now he lists the serpent that's been a mystery hidden Mystery All Through The Years Grace straightened out not disgrace but real true Grace no such a thing as Eternal burning hell you'll burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal had never a beginning or an end and hell was created all these Mysteries the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did the mystery of the water baptism where the extreme trinitarian has brought it into titles of father son Son and Holy Ghost and the Mystery of the godhead being fulfilled in the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ according to the Book of Revelations that the church in this time was supposed to receive there is some of the Mysteries the pillar of fire returning back amen that's the thing that we that's supposed to take place and we see it and how we could go on naming the mystery seeing that the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel the same one that struck down Saul on his road to Damascus the same one coming with the same power doing the same things revealing the same word here's a key staying word by word with the Bible when we see these doctrines we have to understand that it has to stay word by word with the Bible but the idea that we just saw in Matthew 13 is that word by word of the Bible doesn't make sense to us until we understood the meaning of the words in Genesis chapter 1 2 and 3 and we didn't understand the meaning of that until the spirit of Truth came as was told to us in John 16 and then came by that seventh Messenger to reveal these things to us and these are the things that seventh messenger is saying have been revealed to us by his ministry and so we can just say well amen praise the lord we have all of these Revelations we can all just thank God he sent us a prophet and go home now tonight knowing you are the people that God sent a prophet to what a status you you have obtained or we could actually listen to what he said and hear truth come on we could hear truth and let that truth impact us so I want to continue so next slide is a list here that we we're going to now go through this list and so we're going to start with serpent SE and we'll ask a few we've started there we kind of see that this Matthew 13 idea but I want to I want us to ask our Christian friends another thought here why did Jesus have to come a virgin birth that's right that's exactly right get well and I some some of these and I'm going to try not to be like really snarky but some of these were hard answers to come up with right so so why does Jesus and and it's like well I know why because of serpent seed but now I have to take serpent seed out of my head and I have to go okay well well then why would you like well because God is cool and he does supernat stuff and that's pretty Supernatural and I can come up with no other explanation but because I understand serpent seed I understand that the problem came through a sexual birth and that that that that the whole idea was that Jes that that look G brother brandham tells us in spoken words of the original seed is that seed that was Jesus that that that came and and and was put in into Mary that was the original seed that was supposed to come in the in in the garden of EG but God held it all the way across until it could come down into that that that that that womb of Mary the one who could say be it unto me according to your word who had the appropriate Faith to be able to let life come into inside of her and so and and Jesus Christ was the original seed yes that is the Original Seed word but he was also supposed to be that that that first birth Child by Spoken Word and and and look in this oh I love this part because man you understand here we we well the whole the other idea of Virgin birth here is we start talking about New Birth like that's the next question we we'll just tie that one right into this why why do you have to have a new birth Nicodemus comes to Jesus and Jesus says You must be born again and Nicodemus is like well that's going to be difficult and he said are you a master in Israel and you don't know these things you you don't know why I had to come as a virgin birth why you have not come as a virgin birth but I had to come as a virgin you don't you don't see that that problem you know he he knew serpent seed Nicodemus knew it the Pharisees knew it we were talking about John 8 this morning and they're like we be not born of fornication when Jesus said they were of their father the devil they knew what it was they knew what happened so Jesus says you're a master in Israel and you don't realize that the problem that serpent SE caused was that it wasn't by Spoken Word birth and now it was by sexual birth and if you came that way you have a problem and all of us did except him and the idea is is that because we had a problem in that birth we need to have a birth in the same way that Jesus had birth and this is what we say is a new birth you have to understand that as Jesus was born you must be born again and when you become born again because we needed a virgin birth you're doing what's happening to you is the same thing that happened to Mary is that spiritually you accept the word of God in a heart of faith and life takes hold amen and guess what happens when new life takes hold it doesn't leave you have him do you think Jesus gives you the Holy Spirit to take it away doesn't happen doesn't happen so so ser seed tells us it gives us the reason for New Birth it gives us the reason for a virgin birth the consequence of sin being death makes sense because you know the what the problem was you know an infraction of making life and if you steal something you know they used to cut off your hand right yeah because it was an appropriate punishment to somebody who you know does the wrong things with their hands okay so the punishment meets the problem right so so so but then it becomes what we begin to understand then is this it's not about my works right if it's about the birth then it has nothing to do with the works amen now you all should have gotten a lot happier about that I let me just say that again what I want you to understand is what this doctrine of serpent seed is telling us is not just physically what happened in the Garden of Eden but what it means is is that you were intended to have a life that came from God Almighty himself that would never have a problem and when that life can come on the inside of you and that's what God is going to bring with him to Heaven that is what you need and that is what you can say say thank God I've got that life and if I have that life I don't need to worry about if I've done it right Levi have you done it right all the time no praise the Lord I thought you were a message believer you feel the anxiety that I'm putting on him right now I thought you were a message believer can you start acting like it please we got a reput in this church to uphold my goodness thank you for wearing a tie like that and the socks man they're great but you begin to understand right if we begin to put the pressure of Works upon the people anxi in a day that we have plenty of anxiety to go around we then as a church begin to put anxiety upon the People by telling them your Works aren't good enough and I just don't know if you're going to make it if your Works aren't good enough oh my when what we need to be saying is are your Works proving that a lot has come into you and if the growth and progression of Grace has produced these kinds of works it's because new life has taken hold and this is what message Doctrine is teaching us is that Jesus Christ wants to give you the life you were originally supposed to have in the Garden of Eden and when you receive that life nothing can ever separate you from the love of godj thank you Lord you have the down payments amen now your challenge is Lord may I manifest that life to everybody that can see it but if we don't have serpent seed New Birth doesn't make sense Jesus has to point Nicodemus back to serpent seed to get him to understand and what was Nicodemus his question what do we have to do to receive eternal life you have to be born again what can I do to be say be born again recognize your life the life that you came to this Earth with was not good why serpent seed original sin right so praise God so so so for the legalists amongst us who who didn't like everything I just said don't worry the next doctor because now like wait a minute you're telling those young people they can just do whatever they want yes yes if they have a new birth it's going to start taking effect on their desires praise to God so that's what Grace straightened out oh you can go to the next slide that's what Grace straightened out is and you can just stay there and that's what Grace straightened out is is what brother Brandon begins to bring out is is that it's not about works or not but did you come and receive that spirit and if you Reed that spirit and we got to connect this to godhead a little bit you received the the the the presence of Jesus Christ you didn't just receive the Holy Spirit which is how God does stuff but you received him the person of Jesus Christ has come on the inside and the scripture says no evil shall dwell with him so the person of Jesus Christ comes on the inside and begins to work from the inside outwardly to change and to cleanse the life and turn it into a child of God though yet they're born babies and they crawl and they stumble and they fall amen but that's not what it's about have they got gotten the life and if they got the life you know we you know the problem is we begin teaching at works and we got well you know and and this is kind of how denominations teach it it's just like look you you sinned okay you got to come and repent now amen we believe in Repentance absolutely but but how am I teaching that like it's like oh did you sin o hurry up Jesus might come you better get up here and repent because I don't I know what happened you know if you don't if you don't repent before Jesus comes I don't know what what what might happen to you well well wait a second do I have do I have a new birth or don't I are we are we together now this is Grace straightened out is that Grace gra we cheapen Grace by saying grace is mere forgiveness oh Grace is just forgiveness see Jesus has Grace for you he forgives your sins I I I read a scripture this morning I think it's first John where it says he has the power to forgive and to cleanse us from sins that's two things friends forgiveness and cleansing and the new birth Begins the cleansing process when you begin to have cleans that when the heart begins to be cleansed that that it just doesn't desire those things anymore because it's cleansed the things that it the things that used to be in there to desire those things it's gone now and then suddenly you know you're down you're you're 5 years later down your Christian walk and you're like man I used to like those things and I can't even IM can't even imagine doing that ever again that's right why cuz cleansing that's Grace Grace is doing that Grace of Jesus Christ is cleansing you not merely forgiving you though we love forgiveness but it's cleansing you as well and this is what Grace is Grace isn't just cheapening it's like oh did you oh you sinned again well come repent you'll probably sin all next week and then you can come and repent again that's not Grace that's good brother yes sir it's the life of Jesus Christ coming on the inside now okay so we got to move here no eternal hell I'm going to not because I'm I said this this morning not because I'm really starting to get ready to preach and you should all know that the clock just got reset because I took my coat off that's not what that means I just got a little hot if there was 5 minutes left I still would have taken it off so just don't worry okay so no eternal hell yes we're there praise God so no eternal hell now brother bradam he begins to teach us in Souls that are in prison now and what does he tell us that hell is yes Eternal separation from God excellently taught good job Pastor okay so Eternal separation from God so is hell a lake of fire or is it Eternal separation from God because symbolically in the book of symbols Revelation it talks about a a lake of fire but it won't be Eternal right so it's it's separation from God and brother brandom talks about I was falling through all hell alone there was cried out for Dad no dad there cried out for Mom there was no God Mom there cried out for God there was no God there and he was conscious the whole time that's sounds terrible right so so so the the idea here then and what I never understand so so so eternal hell then is is actually your state of not being with God and that there will be some point in time that that that that existence is gone right and so so what is so so so hell is speaking to your relationship with God more than your physical location in a lake of fire and do you know the prophet tells us that God doesn't send any man to hell you choose to go there of your own accord actually you go over where every roadblock God puts in your way to get to hell because what if you're going to go to hell what you're have what you have to be saying is is God I know who you are H you you have shown me like even if I've only seen the Stars I've seen evidence of your existence and I know who you are I don't want to be with you I want to do it all my way and thank you very much to leave me alone and God says are you sure and he puts roadblocks in your way to get you to reconsider but at some point in time you get to a place where you say no I don't want it and God says I will honor your request and you never want God to say go ahead and have it your way worst thing God can say to you have it your own way terrible results you can search through history balum didn't enjoy that right and God says okay you don't want to be with me here you go and so brother Brenham can preach the sermon souls in prison now because he can recognize what he's seeing because he sees this Vision which gives him this thought is that there are people who are already walking around on this Earth who have made their have made their choice and told God I don't want to be with you and God said okay you don't have to be with me I I I I am proposing to you but if you want to say no and walk away that is your choice and I give that to you but there are a people if their you know here's the thing if their Soul's in prison now come on then their must be yes sir some people are catching up there must be people seated already in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus who have already told the Lord I want to be with you and their their their their their not their status not their position not their award not their reward but their desire to to the to the proposal of Jesus Christ getting down on one knee saying I want to be with you forever and you said yes oh glory and already seated with him walking around on this Earth souls in heaven now so hell becomes becomes merely not not burning in hell not punishment because this isn't reward that's not punishment it is separation from God it is only a status of what your relationship with Jesus Christ is amen but Christians oh it's a burning eternal hell I mean this is a big deal like yeah hell's not Eternal man hell was created for the devils and his angels I mean it's just right there in scripture hell is created for devs and Angels if was created has to have an end oo that's a big deal and if you ever wondered about that like how on Earth is that a big deal to Christians like man that sounds merciful to me like I you know hey I don't want anybody to burn in hell for all eternity you know like but there we'll get to godhead in a moment that's I think next but but like if God is a big judgment judgmentally God a father on a throne sitting there ready to punish you for your sins you begin to see the picture then you have to burn you have failed me burn for in the fire for all eternity this is uh this is the Christian God I just want you to understand that like that's like isn't that the idea if we're talking about eternal hell Burning For Eternity like what kind of you know hello and then you say no no no hell's not Eternal it's like yes it is I mean that's a big deal they don't like that and I always thought like why is that like is this the hill you're going to die on really like why why is that I like the merciful idea a whole lot better and then you begin to realize the idea is because they don't have Grace straightened out and they don't understand being born again because of those last two doctrines that we talked about then suddenly they it is a workspace religion for them they have to try very hard to be Christian and to be good enough and to be you know Christian enough and to say the right things and to shake the pastor's hand and you know to help little old ladies across the street in the name of Jesus and all of these things that we do as Christians and if other people aren't going to work as hard as them bless God let them burn because I can come up with no other reason to want that and you can begin to recognize their picture of Jesus because they don't understand he wants to give you his life they don't understand that hell is merely just not being with him they don't understand Grace is straightened out to give you and cleanse you not merely forgive you but to cleanse you to take your life and to make it so that it's not works to serve him anymore but it is the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit as you yield Your Vessel to him that can live a Victorious Life Hallelujah and so you can begin to see but over here we have a god who's very consistent we have a God who says I want you to be bornn again and I would free I freely died for you and I want to give my life to you and indwell your very being I want to have a relationship with you I'm not as concerned with your works as I am with the relationship because I know I know me right brother George I mean you kind of have this idea with your wife it's like I know me like thank you for being here so I don't have to just be me right doesn't have to be me making this example and George is like yeah I know me she gets a little you know comes around me like of course she's going to want to bring me coffee she wants to be near me it's obvious she gets around me long enough she's like I want to have children I want to serve you I want to cuz you're so awesome look it's terrible when it's when we're talking about George but let's understand something this is the god who is the awesome God that's right this is the god who is righteousness this is the god who is peace this is the god who is love everything that's amazing that has ever existed that is amazing is only amazing because he willed it to be so because it's his character that is amazing he's not concerned about your works because he knows that if you get into a relationship with him it's over yeah you're awesome can I be near you oh you don't you don't you don't want me to do this around you amen no problem I didn't like that anyway not compared to you am and the Jesus that this me the doctrine of this message presents to you is a Jesus that wants relationship and is that amazing who knows was I'm not so concern you get around me the works will take care of themselves and it lets anxiety flee out the window and it makes you just go [Music] yes you want me you want me thank God yes Lord you want coffee let me let me brew a big old pot Lord oh my baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation finishing that quote without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did it look look they they want to tell you you come to the altar you have a sensation you must have got the Holy Ghost and it and it distills the experience of the Holy Ghost down to one moment right yes sir that's right and then you leave and what did the Holy Ghost do preach that yes sir that Doctrine distills him down to a moment you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost did you oh did did just come all over you yeah oh you got it okay but then I leave church all right all right do I still have it cuz that tingly feeling that I was feeling and I felt good but I don't feel that great say it's Monday morning come on yeah that sensation wouldn't it yep but it's the person of Jesus Christ performing in you the same works that he did what that what you we cannot take the Holy Spirit and distill him down to one moment and one sensation because when he comes into you it's the life of Jesus Christ that lives with you for the rest of your life and performs in you that those Works amen so praise the Lord our time is really going away so we're just going to continue on but I mean that that you know we're message Believers that should make total sense to us right now and so over here let's just recap real quick we got an arbitrary God we got one who it's about works because Grace isn't straightened out and we don't understand what B you know what true New Birth is and then and then when you get the Holy Ghost it's a sensation and we don't really care about the rest of the time but did you have the sensation cuz we got numbers in our church man we got to we got quotas we got to meet because if we can publicize to everyone how amazing we are we'll have more of you come in and get to Holy Ghost and won't we be serving God I'm not sure how that works but that's look that's denomination friends that this Prophet came to Expos and we needed that exposed big time right and so and we don't know what's going to happen after but you got the Holy Ghost because you had this sensation and we had an amazing service and you will continue to come back as long as we have amazing services and you keep having these cool experiences at the altar yay us and over here we have a God that loves us that's not arbitrary that Grace is straightened out because he's going to come and live himself on the inside of you because we are going to get to godhead and he's going to come and live inside of you wants a relationship with you and knows the works are going to take care of him care of himself and understands that hell is merely just not ex choosing him man I love this guy this guy over here oh my I'm not so sure about that okay water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ now how many of you had the qu now I'm going to list some qu some conversations that I've had and and and I don't I just want you to know I don't go searching for these conversations for some reason these conversations come to me case endpoint water baptism went there's a there's a guy in in um in in the Jeffersonville Louisville area who's who's kind of the local he's the local magician he's the local juggler right say brother Trevor what on Earth does a juggler have to well this juggler just happened to do a show on a Sunday afternoon in Sellersburg Park and I knew he was going to be there so I went to watch his little show no one else showed up poor guy so he didn't do it on the stage he just said hey you know told the guy in charge of the whole event you know hey you know what I'll do I'll just grab my stuff and I'll walk around Mill around the people do some juggling just some stand up you know maybe people will come around and I'll just you know provide some entertainment for a couple hours and then I'll go and that'll be great well but but you you know blond-haired guy I'm you know what I'm going to do we're going to go right over here under this little tent and I will you know I'll just do a little show just for you you know because I I can juggle and I like to juggle and so I didn't bring anything to show you tonight but that's that's not what this is about so so we can find something later but or not so we begin to talk and he's like well you know tell me about you're just getting this stuff out we just began to have a conversation and oh you know well preach a little bit and go to church and you know we just came from from church I don't know if I still had my tie on or what but somehow we got on the conversation of God it's not hard to do with me and and you know and well you know and then we got on a water baptism and I was like well we believe water baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ he's like well you know Father Son and Holy Ghost I mean but you know sometimes don't you think that's just splitting hairs isn't that just semantics isn't that just anybody ever had that conversation before with a juggler okay anyway so so I'm having this conversation and and you know and and and it but it challenged me I was like Lord I need an answer for that I I need a better answer than you know but truth I that's a nice answer but I can say well but but the way I believe it is true right and the way you believe it is with the Catholic Church which that's an answer to fair enough but there's a that's long like I got to I got to establish this I got to establish the Catholic Church as the mark of the beast I got to you know then I got to establish how this go you know and they they mix with paganism and all of this stuff and you know that's in Joe's class too you get that in lesson 30s is and so anyway you got all that stuff going on and it's like that's really inconvenient to go through he's never going to juggle for that long for me and so I just but I I want to like I can't just say truth so what is it in and and it begin to think about like Lord what is it about and it's just like well but isn't there that scripture in Revelations where he says you know he's going to call your name maybe there's yes yeah brother Brandon talks about in the church H book no no sound so great to a person's ears as the sound of his own name isn't that right George Moore I love it oh man you know especially when there's a pickle jar involved man that's I mean that's great Trevor yes I can't get this jar open really you need me and I open the pickle jar because I and I just and I it doesn't bother me one bit to have my wife call my name to have me come and take care of a problem for her cuz man had just as yes this is my purpose on Earth not only that but one of them is to make things easier for my wife just to make things wonderful for my wife and I love to do it cuz I know know that she's going to love me back and so she's going to call my name and I love that I'm waiting for now the spiritual application to catch up and so there's a big deal when I when when I identify myself with somebody I'm going to identify myself with their name I'm going to identify myself as Mrs Father Son and Holy Ghost no I missed that one somewhere no I'm going to identify myself as Mrs Jesus Christ if I want Jesus to call my name I better call his and it brings it down to a personal relationship because I you know if you look Levi do not ever forget her name whenever it happens for you I don't know if you're dating anybody or not but anyway like like you know like this girl you know and you walk in you go to you know you go to the house you know you go for dinner and you walk in and you're like hey sweetie how are you how's that going to go sisters how's that going to go cuz it's going to be pretty obvious what just happened right there he's out man right cuz like you forgot my name that's part of my identity you obviously don't even know who I am and you want to tell me you're coming in here thinking you feel like you like you love me or something like there's going to be love and you can't remember my name you can't say hey I'm not even going to put a name there that's somebody might think I think it was a prophecy or something we don't want that so so so but you begin to understand look it the name means personal personal relationship you want to become Mrs Jesus Christ and over here we want to become Mrs Father Son and Holy Ghost now over the other kind of inconsistency that we have is we help little old ladies across the street in the name of Jesus Christ we build hospitals in the name of Jesus Christ we go to Africa we build schools in the name of Jesus Christ we build churches in the name of Jesus Christ and then all those people that we get into that school and that church baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost we had a coffee shop in in the Jeffersonville area that served coffee in the name of Jesus Christ but man you can't get anybody to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ it no it's Father Son and Holy Ghost why because you don't really actually want to identify with him with who he it's a person I just want to be a Christian but misses Jesus Christ that's a little personal look I want it to be personal and the only reason you wouldn't want it to be personal is if you didn't want it to be personal which meant I just kind of want my distance you see this Doctrine has everything to do with relationship all of these These are message doctrines thank God he sent us a prophet to show us that this is a Jesus Christ you can know in love that you can have a personal relationship with and enjoy it because over here we don't have those doctrines and we're kind of like I don't even know do I love him does he love me I'm not sure not so let's continue on then I'm been waiting to get here because this ties all of what we've talked about together yes godhead great job back there godhead so so so we know like one three all this you know right and it's like but but here's the I was I was sitting in a message Camp counseling a young man great young man if he asked me for my daughter's hand I'd say yes like that's how much I think of this young man and he's sitting there in Pew and he's saying brother Trevor I'm struggling I've got like I'm so scared I I struggle with music because I'm a musician and all of these things I was like whoa dude like the fear of God is you know this is a little much I said wait wait wait wait wait wait wait are you scared of the guy on the throne because you're you you're struggling and you're scared of the guy on the throne like yeah I don't want to I don't want to disappoint God I'm like okay and I I literally told him this I know I'm probably the worst camp counselor that ever that ever lived but I I literally told this guy I said you look service tonight do not go to that altar I do not want you go to that altar I do not want you sitting there telling God how sorry you are and how what terrible you know pathetic excuse of a Christian message young boy you are that is the last thing I want you to do CU he already knows all that and you have told him that millions of times what I want you to do is I want you to sit there and I want you to imagine that you are in a coffee shop on a little round cute little table with two chairs and I want you to sit at one chair with a cup of coffee and I want you to invite Jesus Christ the person to come and sit across from you with a cup of coffee and I want you to talk to him like he's the best friend that you ever had and I want you to talk to him and explain your problems to him as you would explain to you know he's friends with my son as you would explain those things to Zion if you felt like Zion was the most trustworthy person that ever walked the face of this Earth and I want you to talk to him and discuss your problems with him and have a relationship with him and you know what he told me he said brother Trevor I could never do that that was my reaction brother like what and I began to work with this young man and finally and so then that then so we're there in the service then that night it's like 1:00 a.m. and I'm sitting with this young man and we're talking a little bit and and and the Lord finally showed me what the problem was is that he didn't understand God had he could explain it to you just as good as I can but in but he understood the words but the application the truth of it is he still had God s a father sitting on the throne judging him mad at him for doing all these things wrong because he was a message young boy and knew better yeah and I was like hold on a second buddy you got God up there on a throne and you got Jesus Christ D don't worry don't it's not Hey look it's okay brother brandom thought this for one time too he used to think God hated him and Jesus loved him message of Grace come comes has this vision and Jesus comes to him says Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new I love that it's in the message of Grace oh my goodness woo Revelation love it right so so look that's what Grace is is to recognize that Jehovah of the old is the one The Heart Of God expressed gave us Jesus Christ who loved us so much he died for us which means the God who used to be on a throne if that's how we want to imagine it came down in the form of human flesh to show you how much he loved and cared for you and died for you and the prophet told us the sin question was settled at Calvary so you're sitting there afraid of a God on a throne who came and died for you to show you I'm going to take care of the sin that you're afraid of me for committing that doesn't make any sense and that's the doctrine this message is coming to show us who Jesus Christ is all that the father was the heart and character of the father was fully expressed in the man Jesus Christ so if you like so there is no father with his arm cross ready to judge you for your sins and a Jesus that saved you and a holy ghost that we're not sure what he does yet but he does cool stuff that is not godhead but to recognize that God is one and he comes and lives inside of you the Holy Ghost is the life of God so that you're not only shown his love but dwelling his love is dwelling within you glory brother George and his wife love each other they sit next to each other and things like that but the Holy Ghost lives in you it's Jesus Christ the one you love dwelling inside of you not merely with you but in you amen and what a wonderful thing that is and this is look godhead is showing us him as a person to be in a relationship with amen but yet we still have young people who are scared of God because they don't they though they've been taught godhead the truth we need the Holy Spirit to come come down to us tonight and reveal truth to us because we have the answers but we need the the spirit of Truth to come and guide us into all truth amen so so the other thing that we ask that that we look at and I want to just relate one more conversation and we just have a few more slides to finish up but we had I was at the Tabernacle and we had some United Pentecostal kids come and visit one of the services and you know United Pentecostals they baptize in the name of Jesus Christ wonderful people that's great most of the time they the sisters don't cut their hair and they wear skirts and they that is the denomination most the closest to us in Doctrine and so let's make a point here really quick that Den that is the closest denomination to us in Doctrine remember all those loose ends they're still loose ends though in order to have like you cannot there is no other copy of the message outside of the message of William brandham the doctrines that we have did not just come arbitrarily through any other means if you want to say well I just want Jesus you say well that's fine just throw away serpent seed you know I don't want this message I just want Jesus that's fine throw away serpent seed your knowledge of Revelation anything you know about Revelation toss it out the door you have nothing because you have no Vindication to tell you what it actually means so anything you understand about the Book of Revelation Chuck that out the door Chuck out your understanding of serpent seed Chuck out your understanding of godhead Chuck out your understanding of Grace eternal hell all that it's got to go we got to disassemble all of this that we just so that you can just have Jesus and you don't want this message you don't it just don't work but you don't get this picture of Jesus that's right without God sending a prophet to restore this picture of Jesus that's just the Bible That's the trth so so so so the closest you can come to though is probably United Pentecostal and that's where I want to say like they have a lot but they don't have all we need all truth and so they they they you know and so I you know we begin conversation and you know we had I think we had listened to one of the church age messages so I had talked a little bit about the church ages with them just out in the parking lot after the service and and you know if they enjoyed the service and just trying to you know just be friendly and talk to them a little bit you know I wasn't just like oo United Pentecostals no I was I wasn't doing that you're in my knit I'm going to convert you no I I was just being friendly and suddenly they got they caught on the you know got on the subject of you know uh you know that terrible thing you know you all believe in once saved always saved as if that was a negative thing who I mean if Jesus saves me to the uttermost we have those songs let talk about that um how could I lose that doesn't that denigrate the power of God if he doesn't save me always eternally if I'm saved like if that's what the power of God does I trust the power of God did the whole thing all the way yeah well you you know you you know what that does because they didn't understand Grace straightened out that was a problem and they didn't they don't they don't understand godhead in the same way and just missing those two things though they might baptize the same way we do though they might dress the same way we do but just those two things they don't understand and then and then and so we got on this subject and I was like oh I I said so I began to understand I was like oh what you're saying to me is you believe you come and receive the Holy Spirit but if you sin later if you you make a mistake you lose the Holy Spirit yes absolutely you'd have to come back repent and get the Holy Spirit again I said okay and then I said hang on a second now do you believe that when you speak in tongues that's when the evidence of you getting the Holy Ghost he's like yes absolutely that's you know I was like hang on a second though you baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right yes we do you believe though the that that Assemblies of God who baptized in the name of father Son and Holy Ghost but they come to the same altar speak in the same tongues that you speak and then they leave and they got the Holy Ghost yes they spoke in tongues they got the Holy Ghost but they baptize wrong yes okay what good is the doctrine of baptism because I'm I'm struggling but what it is is because they don't understand godhead the same way we do see they make it so extremely one that the person of Jesus Christ always existent and was always God and God cannot be anything else ever like the Holy Spirit so then if you receive the Holy Spirit what have you received well not Jesus Christ you've just received his power of course you can lose that and just just last year I was driving up to Indianapolis for a for a soccer thing that I was part of and I was driving with a with an ex UPC pastor and he began to tell me he's like oh man we were Oneness we had to be at the altar every single time I was like hold up you just connect going to the altar every single time with Oneness yes that's what Oneness people do they're always at the altar I was like why why does your understanding of Oneness mean you got to be at the altar he didn't know so you I talked about brother Hoover before he was the United Pentecostal person I talked about praising God be delivered out of denomination I said brother Hoover you got to help me why does he think this CU he don't know you know and he said well the it's because they believe Jesus Christ always existed like this and I was like like oh then that that means the Holy Spirit isn't Jesus yes that's what they believe ho now then I caught it it's like oh they don't ever there's you see they have no Abiding and dwelling presence of Jesus Christ just because there's a couple of doctrines that they don't quite have it's close there's a lot they dress right they baptize in the name of Jesus Christ but because they don't understand godhead right then God they never have the assurance that God literally lives on the inside of them man so this is that point where we get to and we saywell which Jesus and I've probably done a terrible job of building up this one but I hope I've done a pretty good job of building up this one which Jesus and the and the difference is is message Doctrine the difference is can I say it instead of message Doctrine can I say it is because the Holy Spirit saw fit to bring us a man to reveal the Mysteries to us so that why so that we can be more relev no so that we can be better than the Pentecost no so that we can be be be happy that we are the people that follow our Prophet no so that we can see Jesus Christ again because until God sent us that Prophet that that that that brought us a message that literally was Christ this is what we had so if I'm one of those preachers that says thank God thank God he sent us a prophet then I trust you understand then young people I trust you understand what it is I'm saying because without that Prophet do fulfilling what the scripture said there had to be a guy com and do that's what I had and I'm so thankful that this is the Jesus Christ that I know in love that I've come to cherish because the message came and showed me who he is and now I can know him I don't have to know three people I know one person who now dwells inside of me because of the new birth and baptism of the Holy Ghost so thank God he sent us a prophet thank God there was a pillar of fire that came as another Ministry to vindicate that man who who God said would come so that I knew when he said something it was what God was saying we needed it was always about Christ but before Christ could come the restoration had to happen because if Christ came without the restoration this is the guy you're looking for and you'd be like the Pharisees when Jesus comes with we're looking for a messiah and Jesus comes like hello they're like he you looking for a messiah too man no I'm not I am what the Messiah came that they were looking for and they rejected him because they didn't see the picture that's right second coming of the Messiah going to be any different God had to come and show us who Jesus Christ was so that we knew who he was when he came we already had a relationship with him established before he ever came Hallelujah so pergam and church age again in John 16:13 how be it musicians you come how be it when he the spirit of Truth the word has come he will guide you into all truth Thy word is truth amen he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear word of God that shall he speak word and he will show you things to come the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy I want you to note very carefully Jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word now it could be thought that that's an offensive way to say it because you know we have we have our youth that go to Christian I'm going to try to stop here but we have youth sometimes that go to Christian schools and then they make Christian friends and we tell them look if they don't receive the word if they don't receive the message they don't they're they're not taking a Rapture and it's like wait but my friend loves Jesus I say well that's a problem we got to now we got to deal with but I think that after what we've just shown here the evidence of rece of receiving the spirit is to is to see this truth right amen like if this was presented to you if you present this Jesus and you present this Jesus and they're like I want this one I mean I don't think it's offensive to say that I just don't think you have the Holy Spirit like I don't understand how on I don't understand I don't think you have really that that intelligent of a mind because this is a terrible picture when the word comes and shows this to you of course you would receive it this is a this is the god who you can know in love this is the god of truth that make that just oh make back one slide up there we yes that right there evidence has to do with receiving the word this word shows you this Jesus Christ and if you reject this you're rejecting Jesus amen you might say you're worshiping Jesus you might say you love Jesus amen but this is Jesus and Jesus is his word and this word shows us this like it doesn't make sense to reject that so I I I I just feel like praise God he sent you can go to the last slide now we're all we're all good we're down here I just feel like thank God he sent us a prophet because this is the Jesus Christ that is now shown to us because of message Doctrine specifically it's restoration what are we restoring relationship what was lost in Eden what needs to be restored fellowship with God the message of restoration brings us back to relationship amen praise thank God he sent us a prophet to bring us back into relationship amen so you can't ever be honest and say you know I'm just so tired of this message I just want Jesus you can never say that and be honest amen because there's only one place in the word of God that you're going to find Jesus amen and that's through what the word of God said I would do and bring you light in the evening time and bring you a message of restoration a message of reconciliation before I would come again and we have it so you can see him you can know him that's the that's the whole point of all of this friends it is Jesus Christ this message is Jesus Christ it is the presentation of who Jesus Christ is specifically and individually to you that's why God sent us a prophet shall we pray Heavenly Father Lord I just want to tell you I love you and I'm so thankful you've opened our eyes to see these amazing truths Lord God to oh God thank you Father for all that you've revealed to us thank you Father father for eyes to see for ears to hear oh God because now I recognize Lord Jesus that as Jesus was was speaking to two different groups of people one had the ability to hear and one didn't and Lord as I begin to realize that you've granted me the ability to hear I realized what group I would have been in as you spoke on that day in Matthew chapter 13 [Music] Lord I don't deserve any of this father but I want
