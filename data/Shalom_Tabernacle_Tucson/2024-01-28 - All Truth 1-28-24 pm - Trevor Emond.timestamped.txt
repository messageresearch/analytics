[49:46] hear Lord what you have said to us Lord
[49:49] and and and that that your word lord
[49:51] it's already been restored but father
[49:53] may it be quickened and understood and
[49:56] Lord your Prophet told us to pray for
[49:57] Revelation more than anything in our
[49:59] lives so father tonight Lord just we're
[50:02] we're we're finding ourselves in

[50:37] seated so we had a lovely service at the
[50:41] reservation there in Stan Carlos this
[50:44] morning just a nice presence of the Lord
[50:48] and and we thank the Lord for that and
[50:51] so as brother Israel said I'm brother
[50:54] Trevor Eman and um I've been ministering
[50:58] over 20 years now was at the Brenham
[50:59] Tabernacle for about 17 years I was
[51:02] Sunday school teacher there um the book
[51:04] that he was referencing was basically
[51:06] what I did was tried to create a lesson
[51:09] for every Sunday and when I got through
[51:12] teaching through the church age book my
[51:14] idea was to slap all those lessons
[51:16] together and create a book that was
[51:19] simplistic thinking um four years later
[51:22] I was done and you know um brother
[51:25] Nathan helped me edit it sister Holly
[51:27] durksen up in Canada was uh really good
[51:29] at editing she found all of the many
[51:32] misspellings and definitely humbled me
[51:35] and and so that's that's wonderful we
[51:38] need those people in our lives and so
[51:40] but I I yeah I hope it was a blessing to
[51:42] you if you wanted a copy not just have
[51:44] the Sunday school teacher having a copy
[51:46] I'm not selling right now but just so
[51:48] you knew if you wanted it you could get
[51:50] it at message teer.com but that's fine
[51:53] not the message teer just message
[51:55] teer.com
[51:56] so um yeah so been preaching for about
[52:00] 20 years and and uh and uh my wife and
[52:03] children back home I have three
[52:05] wonderful children serving the lord that
[52:06] the Lord has given me and we're just
[52:08] super super blessed amen
[52:12] so all right
[52:14] well I'd ask if there was any questions
[52:17] but that might be awkward for you to say
[52:18] brother Trevor can you tell me about
[52:19] this so let's just dive into the word of
[52:21] God together your smiling isn't that
[52:23] wonderful we all just feel relaxed and
[52:26] comfortable and we can just look into
[52:27] the word of God As I said maybe in the
[52:29] reservation this morning my my how did I
[52:32] you know what did I what do I know where
[52:33] do I come from what's I I learned this
[52:37] so I spent a long time listening to
[52:38] tapes and so I'm going to just try to
[52:40] say what this said and and and not add
[52:43] my own little spinner color or anything
[52:45] like that maybe my own creative way of
[52:48] portraying a a truth and I think that's
[52:51] what a the job of a minister is supposed
[52:52] to be is to connect his own life to the
[52:54] word and and and try to try to present
[52:56] it that way so I want to take a title of
[52:59] all truth this evening and and um as as
[53:03] we read there that the spirit of the
[53:06] Lord um there in John 16 when he the
[53:10] spirit of Truth has come he will guide
[53:13] you into all
[53:15] truth now we we we we recognize that
[53:19] this is part of the function of the
[53:21] message because as we read in Revelation
[53:23] 10:7 there there that it cannot be
[53:26] disputed biblically that there were
[53:28] Mysteries that needed to be finished
[53:31] there were truths that were there baked
[53:33] into the scripture that that you know
[53:35] there's there's no one coming along and
[53:37] adding anything extra to it so that no
[53:39] there were truths already presented in
[53:42] symbol form into the scripture but yet
[53:45] the the knowledge the truth of that the
[53:47] full understanding and revelation of
[53:50] that was not yet known and that's why it
[53:52] tells us that that the in the days of
[53:54] the voice of the seventh messenger truth
[53:56] would come to us that we would have
[53:59] these Mysteries unfolded and finished
[54:02] before us so the spirit of Truth one of
[54:06] the one of the things that is being
[54:07] spoken of here in John chapter 16
[54:10] necessarily must be then inclusive of
[54:14] Revelation
[54:15] 10:7 because this is something the word
[54:18] says is going to happen and if the
[54:21] spirit of Truth guides you into all
[54:23] truth then what this message must be
[54:25] doing is a part of that of bringing us
[54:29] into all truth are we together amen so
[54:33] so it's not about the messenger as much
[54:35] as it is about Jesus Christ being made
[54:39] known and unfolded to us but you know I
[54:42] found that there's young people that we
[54:44] have you know and and and amongst us
[54:47] many times and you know I've been I
[54:49] don't know why I'm even going here but
[54:51] it's just on my mind and I feel like we
[54:53] should so here we are praise the
[54:56] Lord but but you know I I I liken into
[54:59] it in our church we have some older
[55:00] brothers that were in a in in Pentecost
[55:03] until they came to this message and and
[55:06] and and so you know if I were to be
[55:08] preaching and I'd be like praise God we
[55:10] had a prophet to call us out of
[55:12] denominations hey I know that's a
[55:14] triager phrase for for for for you know
[55:18] brother Hoover I don't know if you know
[55:19] him but I could say something like that
[55:21] and brother Hoover in our church he'd be
[55:22] like oh praise God and he'd just you
[55:24] know he'd be in the back they're just oh
[55:26] thank you Jesus you know and and and
[55:29] some of the young people be like
[55:33] why I mean it was true what he said was
[55:37] good
[55:39] but I mean it wasn't that
[55:42] good and why is that well because that
[55:45] young
[55:46] person they their parents may have never
[55:48] been in a denominational church so a
[55:51] prophet coming to call them out of
[55:52] denomination just doesn't mean as much
[55:55] to them because the lived experience
[55:56] that they have isn't you know isn't
[55:58] resonating with that you know what that
[56:00] brother's trigger words right so so what
[56:04] we have to do then is we have to begin
[56:06] to recognize where the day that we're in
[56:09] that that that that the youth are are
[56:11] needing to see this truth but they're
[56:14] needing they they don't just need the
[56:16] words they need the meanings of the
[56:19] words right they need to connect with
[56:21] you know they need to understand what it
[56:23] means to be drawn out of denomination
[56:26] you know four generations after the
[56:28] children of Israel come out of come out
[56:30] of Egypt if a preacher would have gotten
[56:32] up to say praise God he sent us a
[56:35] prophet to deliver us out of Egypt the
[56:38] Taskmaster whip has no more effect on
[56:40] you and I can imagine some of the young
[56:43] people you know 80 years after
[56:46] Moses hey
[56:48] uh I didn't do so good in geography uh
[56:52] where's
[56:53] Egypt what's he talking talking about
[56:55] man I don't even what's a
[56:59] Taskmaster that's right I ain't been
[57:00] whipped in my
[57:02] life of course the Taskmaster whip has
[57:04] nothing on me so so we need to begin to
[57:08] understand when we're talking about
[57:09] truth being revealed to us we we need to
[57:12] understand that we have got to connect
[57:14] with that truth these words are never
[57:17] going to change and thank God we have
[57:19] them printed down but even more than
[57:22] that thank God that the voice has been
[57:24] captured on tape so that we can hear the
[57:27] inflection we can we can understand the
[57:29] meaning that in which way he is speaking
[57:32] it because we have and but we've also
[57:35] got to begin to understand the context
[57:37] that's being that it's being given in so
[57:40] that our hearts can connect with the
[57:42] truth amen so that you young people
[57:45] who've never like you maybe have never
[57:47] even set foot in a denominational church
[57:50] but yet you need to understand that your
[57:53] heart needed to be delivered from from a
[57:56] denomination that's right because every
[57:58] single one of us man you you know we we
[58:00] want to drift into
[58:02] acceptance yes you want a group of
[58:04] people to accept you yes sir yeah you do
[58:07] like we all want that man you know and
[58:10] if I can just get in a nice cozy little
[58:12] group of people that accept me and love
[58:13] me for who I am and you
[58:15] know ah it's just so nice and we can
[58:18] just sit there for a while and what have
[58:20] you done you've just created yourself a
[58:21] little denomination because the first
[58:23] person that comes around and it's like
[58:24] that's true you know you guys have this
[58:26] nice little group can I come in well
[58:27] you're kind of different though I'm not
[58:29] we've got a nice Dynamic going
[58:32] here and if you come in it might change
[58:35] the dynamic and so I just don't
[58:43] know you bunch of little
[58:45] denominational you know it's
[58:49] true you and and so this is what the
[58:51] prophet is speaking to us is that he's
[58:54] come to take us out of denomination but
[58:56] that doesn't just mean Pentecost that
[58:58] means a spirit of denomination of which
[59:01] your own sinful nature would love to
[59:04] just bring you into your own little one
[59:06] of those but you've got to become you've
[59:09] got to recognize what the prophet is
[59:11] speaking the truth that he's bringing
[59:13] out is a message of restoration to
[59:16] restore you to what they had on the day
[59:18] of Pentecost which was that individuals
[59:21] came in contact with a mighty God
[59:23] hallelujah so that's what this message
[59:25] is doing is this message is not bringing
[59:28] us to a place of you know better than
[59:32] Pentecostals that's right but
[59:38] harder but think of the pride you can
[59:40] have when you're better than the
[59:41] Pentecostals and it's
[59:46] harder wait no one's laughing at that
[59:49] one I don't did that did that land a
[59:51] little too hard on now too soon maybe
[59:54] you know what's going on so we we begin
[59:57] to understand something here right is
[1:00:00] that we've we've we we sometimes have a
[1:00:02] problem what the truth is saying and
[1:00:05] then and then people begin to come along
[1:00:07] you know and you you know maybe you have
[1:00:08] a minister come in and he gets real
[1:00:10] excited and he says something like you
[1:00:12] know oh what was it that I was going to
[1:00:14] say on that part um oh that this message
[1:00:18] is
[1:00:23] Christ that's a really offensive
[1:00:25] statement to some people maybe some of
[1:00:27] you here were offended by that and and
[1:00:29] you know what that's okay that's all
[1:00:32] right we'll tell you why you shouldn't
[1:00:35] be brother George maybe you need to go
[1:00:37] in the back no I'm just teasing
[1:00:43] brother but but so maybe sometimes you
[1:00:46] know you begin to you know maybe there's
[1:00:48] young people here maybe there's old
[1:00:50] people here who knows you know when we
[1:00:51] begin to say you know we're quoting the
[1:00:53] prophet oh brother brandham said brother
[1:00:55] brandham said brother brandham said and
[1:00:57] at some point in time the young people
[1:00:59] begin to be you know you know
[1:01:01] what excuse
[1:01:04] me isn't this supposed to be about
[1:01:10] Jesus cuz it sounds like it's about
[1:01:13] brother brandham because you're like
[1:01:14] brother brandham said brother brandham
[1:01:15] said Thank God and that brother Trevor a
[1:01:17] that what you've been doing for the last
[1:01:19] 10 minutes yeah 10
[1:01:21] minutes like Prophet Prophet prophet
[1:01:24] Prophet
[1:01:25] Prophet this message is Christ can't
[1:01:27] Christ just be
[1:01:31] Christ now I'm making some people real
[1:01:34] uncomfortable don't worry it'll come
[1:01:36] back
[1:01:38] around because what we begin to do
[1:01:41] unfortunately what can happen is we can
[1:01:43] begin to the problem is is when we begin
[1:01:46] to create a difference in our minds
[1:01:49] between the message and between
[1:01:52] Christianity and we don't see them as
[1:01:55] as as integral to each other when we
[1:01:57] don't see that the spirit of Truth
[1:02:00] necessarily must be that Spirit which
[1:02:03] accomplishes and manifests Revelation
[1:02:06] 10:7 yes sir there is no other way to
[1:02:08] slice that one the spirit of Truth
[1:02:11] bringing you into all truth must be the
[1:02:14] spirit that comes in the last day and
[1:02:16] reveals all the
[1:02:18] mystery or that must not be truth one of
[1:02:21] the two but it has to be the spirit of
[1:02:23] Truth so then what we're what then what
[1:02:26] we're saying is all we're saying is is
[1:02:28] that there had to be a guy to be the one
[1:02:31] that was that messenger there had to be
[1:02:34] a guy that was the one to restore that
[1:02:37] faith that said would be restored
[1:02:40] because Peter tells us in Acts chapter 3
[1:02:43] that Jesus is not coming back until the
[1:02:46] days of restitution which is the same
[1:02:49] word as restoration be accomplished so
[1:02:51] if you want Jesus to come back then you
[1:02:54] need the guy to come and
[1:02:57] restore yes sir I want Jesus to come
[1:03:01] back lord send the
[1:03:03] guy send him Lord to bring to to to by
[1:03:07] the spirit of Truth bring that truth
[1:03:11] restore these things that my eyes can be
[1:03:14] opened to do what to see you
[1:03:20] Jesus and that is why God sent us this
[1:03:23] prophet
[1:03:25] was that we could see Jesus because the
[1:03:27] devil's intention since the beginning of
[1:03:30] the Gentile church was to well obfuscate
[1:03:33] is the word that comes to mind but I
[1:03:35] better use another thank you brother but
[1:03:37] but maybe I should to to make the the
[1:03:40] the waterers cloudy and muddy so that
[1:03:42] you couldn't see Jesus
[1:03:44] correctly that now we do see through a
[1:03:47] glass
[1:03:49] Darkly but because we have Revelation in
[1:03:52] our day the waters begin to clear and we
[1:03:55] begin to see who he is and so that is
[1:03:58] what we're saying about this message is
[1:04:00] not that it's better Doctrine than
[1:04:03] Pentecost it
[1:04:05] is but that's not what we're saying
[1:04:08] that's not the
[1:04:11] point we have not become a more Elite
[1:04:15] group better
[1:04:17] revelated thank God he sent a prophet
[1:04:20] now I understand
[1:04:22] seals I can go in any Pentecostal church
[1:04:24] right now and say you know um what
[1:04:27] chapters uh in Revelations are are the
[1:04:30] Seven Seals in and they'd be like the
[1:04:36] what see how much better I
[1:04:42] am quick test message trip no I'm not
[1:04:44] going to ask you where the Seven Seals
[1:04:46] are in the
[1:04:47] scriptures it's Revelation 6 start there
[1:04:50] but anyway that's not the
[1:04:53] point
[1:04:55] it's not that we become more Elite than
[1:04:57] the Pentecost it's that Jesus Christ
[1:04:59] himself who we say we're looking for is
[1:05:02] now being revealed to us in a better
[1:05:04] light in a greater way and when that
[1:05:07] happens we can see and know him in the
[1:05:09] way that he wants to be known and when
[1:05:12] we know him in that way I can tell you
[1:05:14] the way this message portrays Jesus
[1:05:17] Christ to you and I because of its
[1:05:19] Doctrine specifically and we're going to
[1:05:22] get into that is is the is the Jesus
[1:05:25] Christ that you can know in love
[1:05:27] personally and without message Doctrine
[1:05:30] the Jesus Christ that is presented by
[1:05:32] modern Christianity is absolutely
[1:05:37] confusing and you say okay we're going
[1:05:39] to we're you're going to show us that
[1:05:41] brother CH my intention
[1:05:43] tonight in more time than that timer's
[1:05:47] giving me is to is to build a picture of
[1:05:51] of the denominational view of Jesus
[1:05:53] Christ
[1:05:54] without the message Doctrine and to use
[1:05:58] deep message Doctrine to present to you
[1:06:00] a picture of Jesus
[1:06:03] Christ and and and then I'll just say
[1:06:05] you choose you you choose which one you
[1:06:07] want because it's going to be so that
[1:06:10] the comparison is going to be so you you
[1:06:12] would be no one would choose
[1:06:17] that that's that's bold brother
[1:06:19] Trevor
[1:06:21] well praise the Lord Okay so
[1:06:24] taking this thought out of is this the
[1:06:26] sign of the end sir from
[1:06:28] 1962 in December
[1:06:30] 30th the seventh angel is winding up all
[1:06:34] the Mysteries that's laying loose ended
[1:06:36] all throughout these organizations and
[1:06:37] den denominations now let's stop there
[1:06:39] for just a moment there there are there
[1:06:42] are
[1:06:43] Mysteries back one slide there are
[1:06:45] Mysteries laying loose ended all
[1:06:48] throughout these organizations and
[1:06:49] denominations nowhere are we saying that
[1:06:52] denominations had no truth
[1:06:55] they just didn't have all
[1:06:56] truth so so so there are things that
[1:07:00] they had right and praise God for that
[1:07:03] right and we stand on the shoulders of
[1:07:05] things they had right brother brandham
[1:07:07] didn't spend a whole lot of time you
[1:07:09] know talking you know going through the
[1:07:11] basics of Christianity per se he he he
[1:07:14] moved on because we he was already
[1:07:16] preaching to a people who understood
[1:07:18] those things so so so we we're standing
[1:07:22] through to some degree on the shoulders
[1:07:24] of that but there's Mysteries that are
[1:07:26] loose ended they're not perfected and
[1:07:28] that will be you know and and that'll
[1:07:30] come into play as we talk about this
[1:07:32] because if you have some of it but not
[1:07:34] all of it it can really skew the
[1:07:37] picture but the seventh angel gathers
[1:07:41] them up and finishes the entire mystery
[1:07:44] okay so so this this this thought that
[1:07:48] brother bram's going to be taking is
[1:07:49] we're going to go here in just a moment
[1:07:50] to Matthew Chapter 13 you can begin to
[1:07:52] CH to to turn there but Matthew Chapter
[1:07:54] 13 and you will we he's taking this from
[1:07:58] there where in his scoffield Bible it
[1:08:00] talks about the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:08:02] and then he begins to read the Mysteries
[1:08:04] that scoffield has listed in reference
[1:08:07] to that and then he will begin to
[1:08:09] reference Mysteries that his
[1:08:12] ministry has then brought out to us now
[1:08:16] I I I will say this is before the seals
[1:08:18] so there are some Mysteries that the
[1:08:20] seals kind of wound up but one of the
[1:08:22] things the seals did was was show
[1:08:24] brother brandham that this is Absolut
[1:08:26] like he is like look that's why I've
[1:08:28] always preached that he didn't start
[1:08:30] preaching it differently after the seals
[1:08:32] he just realized it's
[1:08:35] happened I really am Revelation 10:7
[1:08:39] like he like it happened it's fulfilled
[1:08:42] we're not looking for Revelation 10 to
[1:08:44] be manifested it's done so so Matthew
[1:08:47] chapter 13 verses 10-1 17 if
[1:08:52] you want to go there because I think
[1:08:55] that's very relevant for us so Matthew
[1:08:58] 13: 10-17 the disciples came and said
[1:09:01] unto him why speakest thou unto them in
[1:09:04] Parables and he answered and said unto
[1:09:05] them it's because it's given unto you to
[1:09:08] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:09:10] heaven but to them it's not given so
[1:09:12] this is what this is the the relevant
[1:09:14] section here the mysteries of the
[1:09:16] kingdom of heaven but the disciples are
[1:09:18] saying why why do you not why aren't you
[1:09:21] speaking more plainly he says well it's
[1:09:23] given to you know but to them it's not
[1:09:25] given for whosoever hath to him shall be
[1:09:27] given and he shall have more abundance
[1:09:29] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:09:31] taken away even that he
[1:09:35] has
[1:09:37] um do you have any water Levi no no no
[1:09:40] no no no no no no do you personally
[1:09:42] right now have any water you don't can
[1:09:44] you have can you hold on to that for me
[1:09:46] right now this scripture right here has
[1:09:47] anybody ever thought about this
[1:09:48] scripture and thought you
[1:09:50] know uh Lord that's not fair
[1:09:54] now just take a little quick drink
[1:09:58] here it's got electrolytes in it do you
[1:10:02] have any water I don't would you like
[1:10:05] some say yes I I need you to say yes you
[1:10:09] want water you at some point by this
[1:10:12] time tomorrow you will you will you will
[1:10:15] need water you would like some water but
[1:10:17] you do not have any right now okay thank
[1:10:21] you I have water that's right and now I
[1:10:24] have
[1:10:27] two
[1:10:29] oh you don't even have any right
[1:10:32] now but if you did have less I would
[1:10:35] take it
[1:10:37] away that's scripture right
[1:10:41] there Jesus said
[1:10:44] that that was very Christian of him
[1:10:46] wasn't
[1:10:49] it that was really funny right there
[1:10:51] anyway therefore speak I to them in
[1:10:53] parables because they seeing see not and
[1:10:55] hearing they hear not don't worry I'll
[1:10:56] make it make sense in a moment neither
[1:10:58] do they understand and in them is filled
[1:11:00] by the prophecy asias which sayth by
[1:11:01] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[1:11:03] understand and seeing ye shall see and
[1:11:06] not perceive for this people's wack
[1:11:08] heart is waxed gross their ears are dull
[1:11:10] of hearing and their eyes have closed
[1:11:12] lest at any time they should see with
[1:11:14] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[1:11:15] should understand with their heart and
[1:11:17] should be converted and I should heal
[1:11:18] them but blessed are your eyes for they
[1:11:20] see your ears for they hear for verily
[1:11:23] say unto you that many prophets and
[1:11:25] righteous men have desired to see those
[1:11:27] things which ye see and have not seen
[1:11:29] them to hear those things which ye hear
[1:11:31] and have not heard them so I want to
[1:11:33] take you now back to verse we we need to
[1:11:35] go back to verse 11 here we need to go
[1:11:38] back to this
[1:11:40] question because the disciples are
[1:11:43] saying why do you speak to them in
[1:11:46] Parables Jesus says it's not given it's
[1:11:49] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[1:11:51] the kingdom of heaven but to them it's
[1:11:52] not given
[1:11:56] now let me ask a question about Jesus
[1:11:58] for a moment does did Jesus did
[1:12:01] Jesus did Jesus will that all the world
[1:12:04] should be saved and no one should
[1:12:07] perish did Jesus love the entire
[1:12:12] world then why did he treat one group of
[1:12:15] people differently than another group of
[1:12:19] people because that seems kind of
[1:12:22] arbitrary
[1:12:25] because if Jesus loves all of them and
[1:12:27] wants all of them to be equally
[1:12:30] saved but yet he treats one group of
[1:12:33] people differently than another group of
[1:12:34] people wait doesn't it doesn't Your Love
[1:12:36] Actually mean Jesus that all the people
[1:12:38] are one
[1:12:39] people and so I want you to imagine you
[1:12:42] know maybe you have a Baptist friend or
[1:12:46] you know Pentecost some denominational
[1:12:48] friend we won't pick on one denomination
[1:12:49] forgive me if you're Baptist and and so
[1:12:52] just just any denominational friend
[1:12:53] that's just a Christian any Christian
[1:12:55] friend maybe they're non- denominational
[1:12:56] denomination and you know they're a
[1:12:58] Christian friend and I want you to bring
[1:13:01] them to the scripture and I want you to
[1:13:03] ask in your mind you have a you know
[1:13:06] conversation with them in your mind and
[1:13:08] you I want you to role play how this
[1:13:11] conversation's going to go ask them why
[1:13:13] does Jesus speak to one group in one way
[1:13:17] and into another group another way and
[1:13:20] the answer is like well well it says
[1:13:21] right there it's given to them know the
[1:13:23] Mysteries but not to this other group
[1:13:25] why is like why was it given to one
[1:13:27] group but not another
[1:13:30] group in other words what we're asking
[1:13:33] is is for Jesus to to be righteous for
[1:13:38] Jesus through his love though he loves
[1:13:41] them all equally for him to treat one
[1:13:43] group differently than another group
[1:13:46] there has to have already been a valid
[1:13:49] reason in the word for him to do so so
[1:13:54] and so you can ask your Christian friend
[1:13:57] where do you find that in the word that
[1:14:01] Jesus is not being arbitrary here but
[1:14:04] that Jesus is acting perfectly
[1:14:07] consistent because you want Jesus to act
[1:14:10] consistent amen you want what Jesus says
[1:14:14] to mean something so when Jesus says he
[1:14:16] loves the whole world he wants doesn't
[1:14:18] want anybody to be saved I want to be
[1:14:21] saved so I want to know how can I be a
[1:14:24] part of the group that sees and gets
[1:14:26] more
[1:14:29] water and if Jesus isn't acting
[1:14:31] consistent that I'm
[1:14:35] like no no you you want me over here or
[1:14:38] did you want me over here I don't know
[1:14:39] what to do and now I'm nervous and now
[1:14:42] I'm anxious and I have no idea what must
[1:14:45] I do to be
[1:14:46] saved that's
[1:14:48] good so there's got to be a way that
[1:14:51] Jesus is consistent though though though
[1:14:53] he's treating one group one way so so
[1:14:55] the ask the question that we have to ask
[1:14:56] ourselves is where in the Bible was two
[1:14:58] groups ever created within
[1:15:01] Humanity so the answer is we have to go
[1:15:03] back to Genesis chapter 1 and 2 and
[1:15:06] three and then we come to a doctrine
[1:15:09] that we call it's a message Doctrine we
[1:15:12] call it serpent
[1:15:13] Seed where the reality of the situation
[1:15:17] is two groups of people have now come
[1:15:21] come to come into being
[1:15:23] so let me ask you a question
[1:15:25] Cain was his name ever on the book of
[1:15:31] life he was never in the original plan
[1:15:34] of God his name there there are people
[1:15:36] there's four four groups of people you
[1:15:37] probably heard this in the Sunday school
[1:15:39] class that brother Joe taught when you
[1:15:40] were in lessons 50ish um somewhere
[1:15:42] around in there and and and you learned
[1:15:44] about the four groups of people in The
[1:15:45] Book of Life those whose names are on in
[1:15:47] the Lamb's Book of Life and those whose
[1:15:49] names got blotted out and those whose
[1:15:50] names got added and those whose names
[1:15:52] were never on it
[1:15:55] and Cain would have been one of those
[1:15:56] names who was just never on it cuz he
[1:15:58] was he was the son of Satan I mean
[1:16:00] that's it's just the way it is and all
[1:16:02] of his descendants were not it was not
[1:16:04] in the original Mind Of God that was not
[1:16:06] how man was supposed to come that was
[1:16:07] supposed to be created and and you know
[1:16:09] by Spoken Word and and and
[1:16:12] so so now we have two groups of people
[1:16:15] though Jesus can love all of them
[1:16:17] equally he yet knows there's one group
[1:16:20] that has the ability to hear what he is
[1:16:23] is saying because they're his children
[1:16:25] and another group that cannot cannot
[1:16:28] understand a thing he says because he is
[1:16:31] not their father and their father is the
[1:16:35] father their father is a father of lies
[1:16:38] and they can't tune their ear to truth
[1:16:40] because they're so used to hearing lies
[1:16:42] oh we should be careful on how many Lies
[1:16:44] We
[1:16:45] Tell so so so now we have two groups of
[1:16:49] people and so you can't look at Matthew
[1:16:52] chapter 13
[1:16:53] and have it make sense if you don't
[1:16:56] understand the doctrine of serpent
[1:16:59] seed the picture we begin to build over
[1:17:02] here is that without this message that
[1:17:04] we have today what we understand about
[1:17:07] Jesus is that he arbitrarily speaks to
[1:17:09] one group one way and another group the
[1:17:12] other way so that one group won't be
[1:17:14] able to hear and another group will and
[1:17:21] who I want you to be Lord can you put me
[1:17:24] in the one
[1:17:25] group how do I get into the one group
[1:17:27] Lord I don't know and your character
[1:17:30] seems a little fishy right now even
[1:17:31] though you're saying you're the one that
[1:17:32] loves
[1:17:33] everybody is that fair but how do you
[1:17:36] understand Matthew 13 if you don't
[1:17:38] understand serpent seat this Bible
[1:17:40] begins to break it doesn't make sense to
[1:17:42] you why would Jesus do that you you we
[1:17:44] we have no answers so I want to look so
[1:17:47] so with that kind of as our as our our
[1:17:50] our are beginning to understand the idea
[1:17:52] of what we're picturing here and to
[1:17:54] begin to understand the problems that
[1:17:56] can come up if we don't understand
[1:17:57] message Doctrine I want to go through
[1:17:59] now these doctrines that brother
[1:18:01] brandham begins to say so in paragraph
[1:18:04] 255 he says that's some of the Mysteries
[1:18:06] that's that list that he just read from
[1:18:09] Scofield's notes that's some of the
[1:18:11] Mysteries this Angel's supposed to wind
[1:18:13] up all the mystery all the mysteries of
[1:18:15] God may I say this with reverence not
[1:18:17] referring to myself but referring to the
[1:18:20] angel of God and now he lists the
[1:18:22] serpent
[1:18:24] that's been a mystery hidden Mystery All
[1:18:25] Through The Years Grace straightened out
[1:18:29] not disgrace but real true
[1:18:31] Grace no such a thing as Eternal burning
[1:18:33] hell you'll burn for millions of years
[1:18:36] but anything that was eternal had never
[1:18:37] a beginning or an end and hell was
[1:18:39] created all these Mysteries the mystery
[1:18:41] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:18:43] sensation but the person of Christ
[1:18:44] performing in you the same works that he
[1:18:47] did the mystery of the water baptism
[1:18:50] where the extreme trinitarian has
[1:18:51] brought it into titles of father son Son
[1:18:53] and Holy Ghost and the Mystery of the
[1:18:54] godhead being fulfilled in the baptism
[1:18:56] of the name of Jesus Christ according to
[1:18:58] the Book of Revelations that the church
[1:19:00] in this time was supposed to receive
[1:19:02] there is some of the Mysteries the
[1:19:04] pillar of fire returning back amen
[1:19:06] that's the thing that we that's supposed
[1:19:07] to take place and we see it and how we
[1:19:10] could go on naming the mystery seeing
[1:19:12] that the pillar of fire that led the
[1:19:14] children of Israel the same one that
[1:19:15] struck down Saul on his road to Damascus
[1:19:18] the same one coming with the same power
[1:19:20] doing the same things revealing the same
[1:19:22] word
[1:19:23] here's a key staying word by word with
[1:19:26] the Bible when we see these doctrines we
[1:19:29] have to understand that it has to stay
[1:19:32] word by word with the Bible but the idea
[1:19:34] that we just saw in Matthew 13 is that
[1:19:37] word by word of the Bible doesn't make
[1:19:40] sense to us until we understood the
[1:19:43] meaning of the words in Genesis chapter
[1:19:45] 1 2 and
[1:19:47] 3 and we didn't understand the meaning
[1:19:49] of that until the spirit of Truth came
[1:19:52] as was told to us in John 16 and then
[1:19:55] came by that seventh Messenger to reveal
[1:19:58] these things to us and these are the
[1:20:00] things that seventh messenger is saying
[1:20:03] have been revealed to us by his ministry
[1:20:06] and so we can just say well amen praise
[1:20:08] the lord we have all of these
[1:20:09] Revelations we can all just thank God he
[1:20:11] sent us a prophet and go home now
[1:20:13] tonight knowing you are the people that
[1:20:15] God sent a prophet to what a status you
[1:20:18] you have
[1:20:19] obtained or we could actually listen to
[1:20:22] what he said and hear truth come on we
[1:20:24] could hear truth and let that truth
[1:20:27] impact us so I want to continue so next
[1:20:30] slide is a list here that we we're going
[1:20:32] to now go through this list and so we're
[1:20:35] going to start with serpent SE and we'll
[1:20:38] ask a few we've started there we kind of
[1:20:40] see that this Matthew 13 idea but I want
[1:20:43] to I want us to ask our Christian
[1:20:45] friends another thought
[1:20:48] here why did Jesus have to come a virgin
[1:20:52] birth that's right that's exactly right
[1:20:56] get
[1:20:59] well and I some some of these and I'm
[1:21:01] going to try not to be like really
[1:21:03] snarky but some of these were hard
[1:21:05] answers to come up with right so so why
[1:21:09] does Jesus and and it's like well I know
[1:21:11] why because of serpent seed but now I
[1:21:12] have to take serpent seed out of my head
[1:21:15] and I have to go okay well well then why
[1:21:17] would you like
[1:21:18] well because God is cool and he does
[1:21:22] supernat stuff and that's pretty
[1:21:26] Supernatural and I can come up with no
[1:21:28] other
[1:21:29] explanation but because I understand
[1:21:31] serpent seed I understand that the
[1:21:33] problem came through a sexual birth and
[1:21:36] that that that that the whole idea was
[1:21:39] that Jes that that look G brother
[1:21:41] brandham tells us in spoken words of the
[1:21:42] original seed is that seed that was
[1:21:45] Jesus that that that came and and and
[1:21:47] was put in into Mary that was the
[1:21:49] original seed that was supposed to come
[1:21:51] in the in in the garden of EG
[1:21:53] but God held it all the way across until
[1:21:56] it could come down into that that that
[1:21:58] that that womb of Mary the one who could
[1:22:00] say be it unto me according to your word
[1:22:02] who had the appropriate Faith to be able
[1:22:04] to let life come into inside of her and
[1:22:07] so and and Jesus Christ was the original
[1:22:11] seed yes that is the Original Seed word
[1:22:13] but he was also supposed to be that that
[1:22:15] that first birth Child by Spoken Word
[1:22:19] and and and look in this oh I love this
[1:22:21] part because man you understand here we
[1:22:24] we well the whole the other idea of
[1:22:26] Virgin birth here is we start talking
[1:22:27] about New Birth like that's the next
[1:22:30] question we we'll just tie that one
[1:22:31] right into this why why do you have to
[1:22:33] have a new
[1:22:35] birth Nicodemus comes to Jesus and Jesus
[1:22:39] says You must be born
[1:22:41] again and Nicodemus is like well that's
[1:22:45] going to be difficult and he said are
[1:22:48] you a master in
[1:22:50] Israel and you don't know these things
[1:22:54] you you don't know why I had to come as
[1:22:56] a virgin birth why you have not come as
[1:22:58] a virgin birth but I had to come as a
[1:23:00] virgin you don't you don't see that that
[1:23:03] problem you know he he knew serpent seed
[1:23:05] Nicodemus knew it the Pharisees knew it
[1:23:08] we were talking about John 8 this
[1:23:10] morning and they're like we be not born
[1:23:11] of fornication when Jesus said they were
[1:23:13] of their father the devil they knew what
[1:23:15] it was they knew what
[1:23:16] happened so Jesus says you're a master
[1:23:19] in Israel and you don't realize that the
[1:23:21] problem that serpent SE caused was that
[1:23:23] it wasn't by Spoken Word birth and now
[1:23:25] it was by sexual birth and if you came
[1:23:28] that way you have a problem and all of
[1:23:29] us
[1:23:30] did except him and the idea is is that
[1:23:34] because we had a problem in that birth
[1:23:36] we need to have a birth in the same way
[1:23:37] that Jesus had birth and this is what we
[1:23:39] say is a new birth you have to
[1:23:42] understand that as Jesus was born you
[1:23:44] must be born again and when you become
[1:23:47] born again because we needed a virgin
[1:23:49] birth you're doing what's happening to
[1:23:51] you is the same thing that happened to
[1:23:53] Mary is that spiritually you accept the
[1:23:56] word of God in a heart of faith and life
[1:24:00] takes
[1:24:02] hold amen and guess what happens when
[1:24:05] new life takes hold it doesn't
[1:24:09] leave you have
[1:24:12] him do you think Jesus gives you the
[1:24:14] Holy Spirit to take it
[1:24:17] away doesn't happen doesn't happen so so
[1:24:22] ser seed tells us it gives us the reason
[1:24:25] for New Birth it gives us the reason for
[1:24:27] a virgin birth the consequence of sin
[1:24:30] being death makes sense because you know
[1:24:32] the what the problem was you know an
[1:24:34] infraction of making
[1:24:36] life and if you steal something you know
[1:24:38] they used to cut off your hand right
[1:24:41] yeah because it was an appropriate
[1:24:42] punishment to somebody who you know does
[1:24:44] the wrong things with their hands okay
[1:24:45] so the punishment meets the problem
[1:24:48] right so so so but then it becomes what
[1:24:50] we begin to understand then is this it's
[1:24:52] not about my works right if it's about
[1:24:55] the birth then it has nothing to do with
[1:24:57] the works amen now you all should have
[1:25:00] gotten a lot happier about that I let me
[1:25:02] just say that again what I want you to
[1:25:04] understand is what this doctrine of
[1:25:05] serpent seed is telling us is not just
[1:25:07] physically what happened in the Garden
[1:25:09] of Eden but what it means is is that you
[1:25:12] were intended to have a life that came
[1:25:15] from God Almighty himself that would
[1:25:17] never have a problem and when that life
[1:25:20] can come on the inside of you and that's
[1:25:22] what God is going to bring with him to
[1:25:24] Heaven that is what you need and that is
[1:25:27] what you can say say thank God I've got
[1:25:30] that life and if I have that life I
[1:25:32] don't need to worry about if I've done
[1:25:34] it right Levi have you done it right all
[1:25:37] the time
[1:25:40] no praise the Lord I thought you were a
[1:25:42] message
[1:25:45] believer you feel the anxiety that I'm
[1:25:47] putting on him right now I thought you
[1:25:48] were a message believer can you start
[1:25:49] acting like it please we got a reput in
[1:25:52] this church to uphold my goodness thank
[1:25:54] you for wearing a tie like that and the
[1:25:56] socks man they're
[1:25:58] great but you begin to understand right
[1:26:01] if we begin to put the pressure of Works
[1:26:04] upon the people anxi in a day that we
[1:26:07] have plenty of anxiety to go around we
[1:26:10] then as a church begin to put anxiety
[1:26:12] upon the People by telling them your
[1:26:14] Works aren't good enough and I just
[1:26:15] don't know if you're going to make it if
[1:26:17] your Works aren't good enough oh my when
[1:26:19] what we need to be saying is are your
[1:26:20] Works proving that a lot has come into
[1:26:23] you and if the growth and progression of
[1:26:26] Grace has produced these kinds of works
[1:26:29] it's because new life has taken
[1:26:31] hold and this is what message Doctrine
[1:26:33] is teaching us is that Jesus Christ
[1:26:36] wants to give you the life you were
[1:26:39] originally supposed to have in the
[1:26:41] Garden of Eden and when you receive that
[1:26:44] life nothing can ever separate you from
[1:26:47] the love of
[1:26:49] godj thank you Lord you have the down
[1:26:53] payments amen now your challenge is Lord
[1:26:56] may I manifest that life to everybody
[1:26:58] that can see it but if we don't have
[1:27:00] serpent seed New Birth doesn't make
[1:27:03] sense Jesus has to point Nicodemus back
[1:27:06] to serpent seed to get him to understand
[1:27:09] and what was Nicodemus his
[1:27:13] question what do we have to do to
[1:27:14] receive eternal
[1:27:17] life you have to be born
[1:27:20] again what can I do to be say be born
[1:27:23] again recognize your life the life that
[1:27:26] you came to this Earth with was not good
[1:27:29] why serpent seed original sin right so
[1:27:33] praise God so so so for the legalists
[1:27:36] amongst us who who didn't like
[1:27:38] everything I just said don't worry the
[1:27:40] next doctor because now like wait a
[1:27:42] minute you're telling those young people
[1:27:43] they can just do whatever they want
[1:27:45] yes yes if they have a new birth it's
[1:27:49] going to start taking effect on their
[1:27:50] desires praise to God so that's what
[1:27:53] Grace straightened out oh you can go to
[1:27:54] the next slide that's what Grace
[1:27:55] straightened out is and you can just
[1:27:57] stay there and that's what Grace
[1:27:58] straightened out is is what brother
[1:28:00] Brandon begins to bring out is is that
[1:28:03] it's not about works or not but did you
[1:28:06] come and receive that spirit and if you
[1:28:09] Reed that spirit and we got to connect
[1:28:11] this to godhead a little bit you
[1:28:13] received the the the the presence of
[1:28:15] Jesus Christ you didn't just receive the
[1:28:18] Holy Spirit which is how God does stuff
[1:28:21] but you received him the person of Jesus
[1:28:24] Christ has come on the inside and the
[1:28:26] scripture says no evil shall dwell with
[1:28:31] him so the person of Jesus Christ comes
[1:28:34] on the inside and begins to work from
[1:28:36] the inside outwardly to change and to
[1:28:39] cleanse the life and turn it into a
[1:28:42] child of God though yet they're born
[1:28:44] babies and they crawl and they stumble
[1:28:46] and they fall amen but that's not what
[1:28:49] it's
[1:28:50] about have they got gotten the life and
[1:28:53] if they got the life you know we you
[1:28:55] know the problem is we begin teaching at
[1:28:57] works and we got well you know and and
[1:29:00] this is kind of how denominations teach
[1:29:02] it it's just like look you you sinned
[1:29:04] okay you got to come and repent now amen
[1:29:06] we believe in Repentance
[1:29:09] absolutely but but how am I teaching
[1:29:12] that like it's like oh did you sin
[1:29:15] o hurry up Jesus might come you better
[1:29:19] get up here and repent because I don't I
[1:29:22] know what happened you know if you don't
[1:29:24] if you don't repent before Jesus
[1:29:26] comes I don't know what what what might
[1:29:28] happen to you well well wait a
[1:29:31] second do I have do I have a new birth
[1:29:35] or don't
[1:29:37] I are we are we together now this is
[1:29:40] Grace straightened out is that Grace gra
[1:29:43] we cheapen Grace by saying grace is mere
[1:29:47] forgiveness oh Grace is just forgiveness
[1:29:49] see Jesus has Grace for you he forgives
[1:29:51] your sins I I I read a scripture this
[1:29:53] morning I think it's first
[1:29:54] John where it says he has the power to
[1:29:58] forgive and to cleanse us from sins
[1:30:01] that's two things friends forgiveness
[1:30:03] and cleansing and the new birth Begins
[1:30:05] the cleansing process when you begin to
[1:30:07] have cleans that when the heart begins
[1:30:09] to be cleansed that that it just doesn't
[1:30:11] desire those things anymore because it's
[1:30:13] cleansed the things that it the things
[1:30:14] that used to be in there to desire those
[1:30:16] things it's gone now and then suddenly
[1:30:18] you know you're down you're you're 5
[1:30:20] years later down your Christian walk and
[1:30:22] you're like man I used to like those
[1:30:24] things and I can't even IM can't even
[1:30:27] imagine doing that ever again that's
[1:30:30] right why cuz
[1:30:32] cleansing that's Grace Grace is doing
[1:30:35] that Grace of Jesus Christ is cleansing
[1:30:38] you not merely forgiving you though we
[1:30:41] love forgiveness but it's cleansing you
[1:30:43] as well and this is what Grace is Grace
[1:30:46] isn't just cheapening it's like oh did
[1:30:48] you oh you sinned again well come repent
[1:30:50] you'll probably sin all next week and
[1:30:51] then you can come and repent
[1:30:53] again that's not
[1:30:57] Grace that's good brother yes sir it's
[1:30:59] the life of Jesus Christ coming on the
[1:31:01] inside now okay so we got to move here
[1:31:03] no eternal hell I'm going to not because
[1:31:06] I'm I said this this morning not because
[1:31:08] I'm really starting to get ready to
[1:31:10] preach and you should all know that the
[1:31:11] clock just got reset because I took my
[1:31:13] coat off that's not what that means I
[1:31:14] just got a little hot if there was 5
[1:31:16] minutes left I still would have taken it
[1:31:18] off so just don't worry okay so no
[1:31:20] eternal hell yes we're there praise God
[1:31:22] so no eternal hell now brother bradam he
[1:31:24] begins to teach us in Souls that are in
[1:31:26] prison now and what does he tell us that
[1:31:27] hell
[1:31:30] is yes Eternal separation from God
[1:31:32] excellently taught good job Pastor okay
[1:31:35] so Eternal separation from God so is
[1:31:38] hell a lake of fire or is it Eternal
[1:31:40] separation from
[1:31:44] God because symbolically in the book of
[1:31:46] symbols Revelation it talks about a a
[1:31:49] lake of
[1:31:50] fire but it won't be
[1:31:53] Eternal right so it's it's separation
[1:31:56] from God and brother brandom talks about
[1:31:58] I was falling through all hell alone
[1:31:59] there was cried out for Dad no dad there
[1:32:01] cried out for Mom there was no God Mom
[1:32:02] there cried out for God there was no God
[1:32:04] there and he was conscious the whole
[1:32:06] time that's sounds
[1:32:09] terrible right so so so the the idea
[1:32:13] here then and what I never understand so
[1:32:15] so so eternal hell then is is actually
[1:32:18] your state of not being with God
[1:32:22] and that there will be some point in
[1:32:24] time that that that that existence is
[1:32:28] gone right and so so what is so so so
[1:32:32] hell is speaking to your
[1:32:35] relationship with
[1:32:37] God more than your physical location in
[1:32:41] a lake of
[1:32:43] fire and do you know the prophet tells
[1:32:45] us that God doesn't send any man to hell
[1:32:48] you choose to go there of your own
[1:32:50] accord actually you go over where every
[1:32:52] roadblock God puts in your way to get to
[1:32:54] hell because what if you're going to go
[1:32:56] to hell what you're have what you have
[1:32:58] to be saying is is God I know who you
[1:33:01] are H you you have shown me like even if
[1:33:03] I've only seen the Stars I've seen
[1:33:06] evidence of your existence and I know
[1:33:08] who you are I don't want to be with you
[1:33:10] I want to do it all my way and thank you
[1:33:13] very much to leave me alone and God says
[1:33:15] are you
[1:33:16] sure and he puts roadblocks in your way
[1:33:19] to get you to reconsider but at some
[1:33:20] point in time you get to a place where
[1:33:23] you say no I don't want it and God says
[1:33:25] I will honor your request and you never
[1:33:27] want God to say go ahead and have it
[1:33:29] your way worst thing God can say to you
[1:33:32] have it your own way terrible
[1:33:34] results you can search through history
[1:33:36] balum didn't enjoy
[1:33:38] that
[1:33:40] right and God says okay you don't want
[1:33:42] to be with me here you
[1:33:44] go and so brother Brenham can preach the
[1:33:47] sermon souls in prison now because he
[1:33:50] can recognize what he's seeing because
[1:33:52] he sees this Vision which gives him this
[1:33:54] thought is that there are people who are
[1:33:56] already walking around on this Earth who
[1:33:58] have made their have made their choice
[1:34:00] and told God I don't want to be with you
[1:34:02] and God said okay you don't have to be
[1:34:05] with me I I I I am proposing to you but
[1:34:08] if you want to say no and walk away that
[1:34:10] is your choice and I give that to
[1:34:13] you but there are a people if their you
[1:34:16] know here's the thing if their Soul's in
[1:34:18] prison
[1:34:19] now come on then their must
[1:34:22] be yes
[1:34:24] sir some people are catching up there
[1:34:26] must be people seated already in
[1:34:29] Heavenly places with Christ
[1:34:32] Jesus who have already told the Lord I
[1:34:35] want to be with you and their their
[1:34:38] their their their not their status not
[1:34:41] their position not their award not their
[1:34:44] reward but their desire to to the to the
[1:34:48] proposal of Jesus Christ getting down on
[1:34:50] one knee saying I want to be with you
[1:34:53] forever and you said yes oh glory and
[1:34:57] already seated with him walking around
[1:34:59] on this Earth souls in heaven now so
[1:35:02] hell becomes becomes merely not not
[1:35:06] burning in hell not punishment because
[1:35:09] this isn't reward that's not punishment
[1:35:11] it is separation from God it is only a
[1:35:14] status of what your relationship with
[1:35:17] Jesus Christ is amen but Christians oh
[1:35:21] it's a burning eternal hell I mean this
[1:35:24] is a big deal like yeah hell's not
[1:35:26] Eternal man hell was created for the
[1:35:28] devils and his angels I mean it's just
[1:35:29] right there in scripture hell is created
[1:35:31] for devs and Angels if was created has
[1:35:33] to have an end oo that's a big deal and
[1:35:37] if you ever wondered about that like how
[1:35:39] on Earth is that a big deal to
[1:35:40] Christians like man that sounds merciful
[1:35:43] to me like I you know hey I don't want
[1:35:46] anybody to burn in hell for all
[1:35:48] eternity you know like
[1:35:51] but there we'll get to godhead in a
[1:35:53] moment that's I think next but but like
[1:35:56] if God is a big
[1:35:59] judgment judgmentally God a father on a
[1:36:03] throne sitting there ready to punish you
[1:36:06] for your
[1:36:08] sins you begin to see the picture then
[1:36:11] you have to burn you have failed me burn
[1:36:16] for in the fire for all
[1:36:19] eternity this is uh this is the
[1:36:21] Christian God I just want you to
[1:36:23] understand that like that's like isn't
[1:36:24] that the idea if we're talking about
[1:36:26] eternal hell Burning For Eternity like
[1:36:28] what kind of you know
[1:36:29] hello and then you say no no no hell's
[1:36:31] not
[1:36:32] Eternal it's like yes it is I mean
[1:36:34] that's a big deal they don't like that
[1:36:36] and I always thought like why is that
[1:36:37] like is this the hill you're going to
[1:36:39] die on really like why why is that I
[1:36:41] like the merciful idea a whole lot
[1:36:43] better and then you begin to realize the
[1:36:45] idea is because they don't have Grace
[1:36:46] straightened out and they don't
[1:36:47] understand being born again because of
[1:36:49] those last two doctrines that we talked
[1:36:50] about then suddenly they it is a
[1:36:52] workspace religion for them they have to
[1:36:54] try very hard to be Christian and to be
[1:36:56] good enough and to be you know Christian
[1:36:58] enough and to say the right things and
[1:36:59] to shake the pastor's hand and you know
[1:37:01] to help little old ladies across the
[1:37:03] street in the name of Jesus and all of
[1:37:04] these things that we do as Christians
[1:37:06] and if other people aren't going to work
[1:37:07] as hard as them bless God let them
[1:37:12] burn because I can come up with no other
[1:37:14] reason to want
[1:37:18] that and you can begin to recognize
[1:37:20] their picture of Jesus because they
[1:37:22] don't understand he wants to give you
[1:37:23] his life they don't understand that hell
[1:37:25] is merely just not being with
[1:37:27] him they don't understand Grace is
[1:37:29] straightened out to give you and cleanse
[1:37:31] you not merely forgive you but to
[1:37:33] cleanse you to take your life and to
[1:37:35] make it so that it's not works to serve
[1:37:37] him anymore but it is the cleansing
[1:37:39] power of the Holy Spirit as you yield
[1:37:41] Your Vessel to him that can live a
[1:37:44] Victorious Life

[1:38:53] this is the god who is the awesome God
[1:38:57] that's right this is the god who is
[1:39:00] righteousness this is the god who is
[1:39:02] peace this is the god who is love
[1:39:04] everything that's amazing that has ever
[1:39:07] existed that is amazing is only amazing
[1:39:10] because he willed it to be so because
[1:39:12] it's his character that is amazing he's
[1:39:15] not concerned about your works because
[1:39:17] he knows that if you get into a
[1:39:19] relationship with him it's over yeah
[1:39:23] you're awesome can I be near you oh you
[1:39:26] don't you don't you don't want me to do
[1:39:28] this around
[1:39:31] you amen no problem I didn't like that
[1:39:36] anyway not compared to you
[1:39:40] am and the Jesus that this me the
[1:39:42] doctrine of this message presents to you
[1:39:45] is a Jesus that wants relationship and
[1:39:48] is that amazing who knows was I'm not so
[1:39:52] concern you get around me the works will
[1:39:54] take care of themselves and it lets
[1:39:56] anxiety flee out the window and it makes
[1:39:59] you just go
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:07] yes you want
[1:40:12] me you want me thank God yes
[1:40:18] Lord you want coffee let me let me brew
[1:40:22] a big old pot Lord oh
[1:40:25] my baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:40:27] sensation finishing that quote without
[1:40:29] sensation but the person of Christ
[1:40:31] performing in you the same works that he
[1:40:33] did it look look they they want to tell
[1:40:36] you you come to the altar you have a
[1:40:38] sensation you must have got the Holy
[1:40:40] Ghost and it and it distills the
[1:40:42] experience of the Holy Ghost down to one
[1:40:44] moment right yes
[1:40:47] sir that's right and then you leave and
[1:40:49] what did the Holy Ghost do preach that
[1:40:51] yes
[1:40:52] sir that Doctrine distills him down to a
[1:40:55] moment you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:57] Ghost did you oh did did just come all
[1:40:59] over
[1:41:00] you yeah oh you got it
[1:41:04] okay but then I leave church all right
[1:41:07] all right do I still have it cuz that
[1:41:10] tingly feeling that I was feeling and I
[1:41:12] felt
[1:41:13] good but I don't feel that great say
[1:41:16] it's Monday morning come
[1:41:19] on
[1:41:22] yeah that sensation wouldn't it yep but
[1:41:24] it's the person of Jesus Christ
[1:41:27] performing in you the same works that he
[1:41:29] did what that what you we cannot take
[1:41:31] the Holy Spirit and distill him down to
[1:41:33] one moment and one sensation because
[1:41:35] when he comes into you it's the life of
[1:41:36] Jesus Christ that lives with you for the
[1:41:39] rest of your life and performs in you
[1:41:43] that those Works amen so praise the
[1:41:49] Lord
[1:41:51] our time is really going away so we're
[1:41:54] just going to continue on but I mean
[1:41:55] that that you know we're message
[1:41:57] Believers that should make total sense
[1:41:58] to us right now and so over here let's
[1:42:01] just recap real quick we got an
[1:42:02] arbitrary God we got one who it's about
[1:42:05] works because Grace isn't straightened
[1:42:07] out and we don't understand what B you
[1:42:09] know what true New Birth is and then and
[1:42:12] then when you get the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:42:14] sensation and we don't really care about
[1:42:16] the rest of the time but did you have
[1:42:18] the sensation cuz we got numbers in our
[1:42:20] church man we got to we got quotas we
[1:42:22] got to
[1:42:23] meet because if we can publicize to
[1:42:25] everyone how amazing we are we'll have
[1:42:27] more of you come in and get to Holy
[1:42:28] Ghost and won't we be serving God I'm
[1:42:31] not sure how that works but that's look
[1:42:33] that's denomination friends that this
[1:42:35] Prophet came to Expos and we needed that
[1:42:38] exposed big time right and so and we
[1:42:41] don't know what's going to happen after
[1:42:43] but you got the Holy Ghost because you
[1:42:44] had this sensation and we had an amazing
[1:42:45] service and you will continue to come
[1:42:47] back as long as we have amazing services
[1:42:50] and you keep having these cool
[1:42:51] experiences at the
[1:42:55] altar yay us and over here we have a God
[1:42:59] that loves us that's not arbitrary that
[1:43:01] Grace is straightened out because he's
[1:43:03] going to come and live himself on the
[1:43:04] inside of you because we are going to
[1:43:06] get to godhead and he's going to come
[1:43:07] and live inside of you wants a
[1:43:09] relationship with you and knows the
[1:43:10] works are going to take care of him care
[1:43:12] of himself and understands that hell is
[1:43:14] merely just not ex choosing
[1:43:16] him man I love this guy this guy over
[1:43:20] here
[1:43:21] oh my I'm not so sure about that okay
[1:43:23] water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:43:26] Christ now how many of you had the qu
[1:43:29] now I'm going to list some qu some
[1:43:30] conversations that I've had and and and
[1:43:32] I don't I just want you to know I don't
[1:43:34] go searching for these conversations for
[1:43:36] some reason these conversations come to
[1:43:38] me case endpoint water baptism went
[1:43:42] there's a there's a guy in in um in in
[1:43:45] the Jeffersonville Louisville area who's
[1:43:47] who's kind of the local he's the local
[1:43:49] magician he's the local juggler right
[1:43:51] say brother Trevor what on Earth does a
[1:43:53] juggler have to well this juggler just
[1:43:55] happened to do a show on a Sunday
[1:43:56] afternoon in Sellersburg Park and I knew
[1:43:59] he was going to be there so I went to
[1:44:01] watch his little show no one else showed
[1:44:04] up poor
[1:44:06] guy so he didn't do it on the stage he
[1:44:09] just said hey you know told the guy in
[1:44:10] charge of the whole event you know hey
[1:44:12] you know what I'll do I'll just grab my
[1:44:14] stuff and I'll walk around Mill around
[1:44:16] the people do some juggling just some
[1:44:17] stand up you know maybe people will come
[1:44:19] around and I'll just you know provide
[1:44:21] some entertainment for a couple hours
[1:44:22] and then I'll go and that'll be great
[1:44:23] well but but you you know blond-haired
[1:44:26] guy I'm you know what I'm going to do
[1:44:27] we're going to go right over here under
[1:44:29] this little tent and I will you know
[1:44:30] I'll just do a little show just for you
[1:44:32] you know because I I can juggle and I
[1:44:34] like to juggle and so I didn't bring
[1:44:37] anything to show you tonight but that's
[1:44:38] that's not what this is about so so we
[1:44:40] can find something later
[1:44:43] but or
[1:44:45] not so we begin to talk and he's like
[1:44:48] well you know tell me about you're just
[1:44:49] getting this stuff out we just began to
[1:44:50] have a conversation and oh you know well
[1:44:52] preach a little bit and go to church and
[1:44:54] you know we just came from from church I
[1:44:56] don't know if I still had my tie on or
[1:44:57] what but somehow we got on the
[1:44:59] conversation of God it's not hard to do
[1:45:00] with me and and you know and well you
[1:45:03] know and then we got on a water baptism
[1:45:05] and I was like well we believe water
[1:45:06] baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:07] he's like well you know Father Son and
[1:45:09] Holy Ghost I mean but you know sometimes
[1:45:11] don't you think that's just splitting
[1:45:12] hairs isn't that just semantics isn't
[1:45:13] that just anybody ever had that
[1:45:14] conversation before with a juggler okay
[1:45:18] anyway so so I'm having this
[1:45:20] conversation
[1:45:21] and and you know and and and it but it
[1:45:22] challenged me I was like Lord I need an
[1:45:24] answer for that I I need a better answer
[1:45:26] than you know but
[1:45:29] truth I that's a nice answer but I can
[1:45:33] say well but but the way I believe it is
[1:45:35] true right and the way you believe it is
[1:45:37] with the Catholic Church which that's an
[1:45:38] answer to fair enough but there's a
[1:45:41] that's long like I got to I got to
[1:45:43] establish this I got to establish the
[1:45:45] Catholic Church as the mark of the beast
[1:45:46] I got to you know then I got to
[1:45:47] establish how this go you know and they
[1:45:49] they mix with paganism and all of this
[1:45:51] stuff and you know that's in Joe's class
[1:45:53] too you get that in lesson 30s is and so
[1:45:56] anyway you got all that stuff going on
[1:45:58] and it's like that's really inconvenient
[1:45:59] to go through he's never going to juggle
[1:46:00] for that long for me and so I just but I
[1:46:03] I want to like I can't just say truth so
[1:46:05] what is it in and and it begin to think
[1:46:06] about like Lord what is it about and
[1:46:08] it's just like well but isn't there that
[1:46:09] scripture in Revelations where he says
[1:46:12] you know he's going to call your
[1:46:15] name maybe there's yes yeah brother
[1:46:19] Brandon talks about in the church H book
[1:46:20] no no
[1:46:22] sound so
[1:46:24] great to a person's ears as the sound of
[1:46:27] his own name isn't that right George
[1:46:30] Moore I love it oh man you know
[1:46:33] especially when there's a pickle jar
[1:46:36] involved man that's I mean that's
[1:46:40] great
[1:46:42] Trevor yes I can't get this jar
[1:46:46] open
[1:46:48] really you need me
[1:46:57] and I open the pickle jar because I and
[1:47:00] I just and I it doesn't bother me one
[1:47:02] bit to have my wife call my name to have
[1:47:05] me come and take care of a problem for
[1:47:07] her cuz man had just as yes this is my
[1:47:10] purpose on Earth not only that but one
[1:47:12] of them is to make things easier for my
[1:47:15] wife just to make things wonderful for
[1:47:18] my wife and I love to do it cuz I know
[1:47:20] know that she's going to love me back
[1:47:22] and so she's going to call my name and I
[1:47:24] love
[1:47:26] that I'm waiting for now the spiritual
[1:47:29] application to catch
[1:47:31] up and so there's a big deal when I when
[1:47:33] when I identify myself with somebody I'm
[1:47:36] going to identify myself with their
[1:47:39] name I'm going to identify myself as Mrs
[1:47:42] Father Son and Holy Ghost no I missed
[1:47:44] that one somewhere no I'm going to
[1:47:45] identify myself as Mrs Jesus Christ if I
[1:47:48] want Jesus to call my name I better call
[1:47:52] his and it brings it down to a personal
[1:47:56] relationship because I you know if you
[1:47:59] look Levi do not ever forget her name
[1:48:02] whenever it happens for you I don't know
[1:48:04] if you're dating anybody or not but
[1:48:05] anyway like like you know like this girl
[1:48:08] you know and you walk in you go to you
[1:48:10] know you go to the house you know you go
[1:48:11] for dinner and you walk in and you're
[1:48:13] like
[1:48:15] hey
[1:48:17] sweetie how are you how's that going to
[1:48:20] go sisters how's that going to go cuz
[1:48:24] it's going to be pretty obvious what
[1:48:25] just happened right
[1:48:29] there he's out man right cuz like you
[1:48:33] forgot my name that's part of my
[1:48:35] identity you obviously don't even know
[1:48:36] who I am and you want to tell me you're
[1:48:38] coming in here thinking you feel like
[1:48:40] you like you love me or something like
[1:48:42] there's going to be love and you can't
[1:48:43] remember my name you can't say hey I'm
[1:48:47] not even going to put a name there
[1:48:48] that's somebody might think I think it
[1:48:50] was a prophecy or something we don't
[1:48:51] want that so so so but you begin to
[1:48:54] understand look it the name means
[1:48:56] personal personal relationship you want
[1:48:59] to become Mrs Jesus Christ and over here
[1:49:01] we want to become Mrs Father Son and
[1:49:03] Holy
[1:49:04] Ghost now over the other kind of
[1:49:06] inconsistency that we have is we help
[1:49:08] little old ladies across the street in
[1:49:09] the name of Jesus Christ we build
[1:49:11] hospitals in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:49:13] go to Africa we build schools in the
[1:49:14] name of Jesus Christ we build churches
[1:49:16] in the name of Jesus Christ and then all
[1:49:18] those people that we get into that
[1:49:19] school and that church baptized in the
[1:49:20] name of Father Son and Holy
[1:49:23] Ghost we had a coffee shop in in the
[1:49:25] Jeffersonville area that served coffee
[1:49:27] in the name of Jesus Christ but man you
[1:49:29] can't get anybody to baptize in the name
[1:49:30] of Jesus Christ it no it's Father Son
[1:49:32] and Holy Ghost why because you don't
[1:49:33] really actually want to identify with
[1:49:36] him with who he it's a person I just
[1:49:40] want to be a
[1:49:41] Christian but misses Jesus Christ that's
[1:49:44] a little personal look I want it to be
[1:49:46] personal and the only reason you
[1:49:47] wouldn't want it to be personal is if
[1:49:49] you didn't want it to be personal which
[1:49:51] meant I just kind of want my
[1:49:55] distance you see this
[1:49:57] Doctrine has everything to do with
[1:49:59] relationship all of these These are
[1:50:01] message doctrines thank God he sent us a
[1:50:03] prophet to show us that this is a Jesus
[1:50:06] Christ you can know in love that you can
[1:50:08] have a personal relationship with and
[1:50:10] enjoy it because over here we don't have
[1:50:12] those doctrines and we're kind of like I
[1:50:14] don't even know do I love him does he
[1:50:16] love me I'm not sure not so let's
[1:50:18] continue on then I'm been waiting to get
[1:50:21] here because this ties all of what we've
[1:50:23] talked about together yes godhead great
[1:50:24] job back there godhead so so so we know
[1:50:27] like one three all this you know right
[1:50:29] and it's like but but here's the I was I
[1:50:32] was sitting in a message Camp counseling
[1:50:34] a young man great young man if he asked
[1:50:37] me for my daughter's hand I'd say yes
[1:50:39] like that's how much I think of this
[1:50:41] young man and he's sitting there in Pew
[1:50:43] and he's saying brother Trevor I'm
[1:50:44] struggling I've got like I'm so scared I
[1:50:46] I struggle with music because I'm a
[1:50:48] musician and all of these things I was
[1:50:50] like whoa dude like the fear of God is
[1:50:54] you know this is a little
[1:50:55] much I said wait wait wait wait wait
[1:50:57] wait wait are you scared of the guy on
[1:50:59] the throne because you're you you're
[1:51:01] struggling and you're scared of the guy
[1:51:03] on the throne like yeah I don't want to
[1:51:06] I don't want to disappoint God I'm like
[1:51:08] okay and I I literally told him this I
[1:51:11] know I'm probably the worst camp
[1:51:12] counselor that ever that ever lived but
[1:51:13] I I literally told this guy I said you
[1:51:15] look service tonight do not go to that
[1:51:18] altar I do not want you go to that altar
[1:51:20] I do not want you sitting there telling
[1:51:22] God how sorry you are and how what
[1:51:23] terrible you know pathetic excuse of a
[1:51:26] Christian message young boy you are that
[1:51:29] is the last thing I want you to do CU he
[1:51:31] already knows all that and you have told
[1:51:33] him that millions of times what I want
[1:51:37] you to do is I want you to sit there and
[1:51:39] I want you to imagine that you are in a
[1:51:40] coffee shop on a little round cute
[1:51:43] little table with two chairs and I want
[1:51:45] you to sit at one chair with a cup of
[1:51:47] coffee and I want you to invite Jesus
[1:51:49] Christ the person to come and sit across
[1:51:51] from you with a cup of coffee and I want
[1:51:52] you to talk to him like he's the best
[1:51:54] friend that you ever had and I want you
[1:51:56] to talk to him and explain your problems
[1:51:59] to him as you would explain to you know
[1:52:01] he's friends with my son as you would
[1:52:03] explain those things to Zion if you felt
[1:52:05] like Zion was the most trustworthy
[1:52:06] person that ever walked the face of this
[1:52:08] Earth and I want you to talk to him and
[1:52:09] discuss your problems with him and have
[1:52:11] a relationship with him and you know
[1:52:13] what he told me he said brother Trevor I
[1:52:14] could never do
[1:52:17] that that was my reaction brother like
[1:52:19] what
[1:52:21] and I began to work with this young man
[1:52:22] and finally and so then that then so
[1:52:24] we're there in the service then that
[1:52:26] night it's like 1:00 a.m. and I'm
[1:52:27] sitting with this young man and we're
[1:52:29] talking a little
[1:52:30] bit and and and the Lord finally showed
[1:52:33] me what the problem was is that he
[1:52:34] didn't understand God had he could
[1:52:36] explain it to you just as good as I can
[1:52:39] but in but he understood the words but
[1:52:42] the application the truth of it is he
[1:52:44] still had God s a father sitting on the
[1:52:46] throne judging him mad at him for doing
[1:52:49] all these things wrong because he was a
[1:52:51] message young boy and knew better
[1:52:54] yeah and I was like hold on a second
[1:52:57] buddy you got God up there on a throne
[1:52:59] and you got Jesus Christ D don't worry
[1:53:01] don't it's not Hey look it's okay
[1:53:02] brother brandom thought this for one
[1:53:04] time too he used to think God hated him
[1:53:06] and Jesus loved
[1:53:09] him message of
[1:53:11] Grace come comes has this vision and
[1:53:13] Jesus comes to him says Jehovah the old
[1:53:15] is Jesus of the new I love that it's in
[1:53:17] the message of Grace oh my goodness woo
[1:53:20] Revelation love it right so so look
[1:53:22] that's what Grace is is to recognize
[1:53:24] that Jehovah of the old is the one The
[1:53:27] Heart Of God expressed gave us Jesus
[1:53:30] Christ who loved us so much he died for
[1:53:32] us which means the God who used to be on
[1:53:34] a throne if that's how we want to
[1:53:36] imagine it came down in the form of
[1:53:39] human flesh to show you how much he
[1:53:42] loved and cared for you and died for you
[1:53:45] and the prophet told us the sin question
[1:53:48] was settled at Calvary
[1:53:50] so you're sitting there afraid of a God
[1:53:52] on a throne who came and died for you to
[1:53:54] show you I'm going to take care of the
[1:53:56] sin that you're afraid of me for
[1:53:58] committing that doesn't make any
[1:54:01] sense and that's the doctrine this
[1:54:04] message is coming to show us who Jesus
[1:54:06] Christ is all that the father was the
[1:54:10] heart and character of the father was
[1:54:12] fully expressed in the man Jesus Christ
[1:54:16] so if you like so there is no father
[1:54:19] with his arm cross ready to judge you
[1:54:21] for your sins and a Jesus that saved you
[1:54:24] and a holy ghost that we're not sure
[1:54:25] what he does yet but he does cool
[1:54:28] stuff that is not godhead but to
[1:54:32] recognize that God is one and he comes
[1:54:35] and lives inside of you the Holy Ghost
[1:54:37] is the life of God so that you're not
[1:54:40] only shown his love but dwelling his
[1:54:43] love is dwelling within you
[1:54:46] glory brother George and his wife love
[1:54:48] each other they sit next to each other
[1:54:50] and things like that but the Holy Ghost
[1:54:52] lives in you it's Jesus Christ the one
[1:54:55] you love dwelling inside of you not
[1:54:57] merely with you but in you amen and what
[1:55:00] a wonderful thing that is and this is
[1:55:02] look godhead is showing us him as a
[1:55:05] person to be in a relationship with amen
[1:55:09] but yet we still have young people who
[1:55:11] are scared of
[1:55:13] God because they don't they though
[1:55:16] they've been taught godhead the truth we
[1:55:18] need the Holy Spirit to come come down
[1:55:20] to us tonight and reveal truth to us
[1:55:22] because we have the
[1:55:26] answers but we need the the spirit of
[1:55:28] Truth to come and guide us into all
[1:55:31] truth amen so so the other thing that we
[1:55:34] ask that that we look at
[1:55:38] and I want to just relate one more
[1:55:40] conversation and we just have a few more
[1:55:42] slides to finish up but we had I was at
[1:55:46] the Tabernacle and we had some United
[1:55:48] Pentecostal kids come and visit one of
[1:55:51] the services and you know United
[1:55:53] Pentecostals they baptize in the name of
[1:55:54] Jesus Christ wonderful people that's
[1:55:57] great most of the time they the sisters
[1:56:00] don't cut their hair and they wear
[1:56:01] skirts and they that is the denomination
[1:56:04] most the closest to us in
[1:56:08] Doctrine and so let's make a point here
[1:56:10] really quick that Den that is the
[1:56:13] closest denomination to us in Doctrine
[1:56:14] remember all those loose ends they're
[1:56:16] still loose ends though in order to have
[1:56:18] like you cannot there is no other copy
[1:56:21] of the message outside of the message of
[1:56:24] William brandham the doctrines that we
[1:56:26] have did not just come arbitrarily
[1:56:29] through any other means if you want to
[1:56:32] say well I just want Jesus you say well
[1:56:35] that's fine just throw away serpent seed
[1:56:37] you know I don't want this message I
[1:56:38] just want Jesus that's fine throw away
[1:56:39] serpent seed your knowledge of
[1:56:41] Revelation anything you know about
[1:56:42] Revelation toss it out the door you have
[1:56:43] nothing because you have no Vindication
[1:56:44] to tell you what it actually means so
[1:56:46] anything you understand about the Book
[1:56:47] of Revelation Chuck that out the door
[1:56:49] Chuck out your understanding of serpent
[1:56:50] seed Chuck out your understanding of
[1:56:51] godhead Chuck out your understanding of
[1:56:53] Grace eternal hell all that it's got to
[1:56:56] go we got to disassemble all of this
[1:56:58] that we just so that you can just have
[1:57:01] Jesus and you don't want this message
[1:57:02] you don't it just don't
[1:57:04] work but you don't get this picture of
[1:57:07] Jesus that's right without God sending a
[1:57:09] prophet to restore this picture of
[1:57:12] Jesus that's just the Bible That's the
[1:57:15] trth so so so so the closest you can
[1:57:19] come to though is probably United
[1:57:20] Pentecostal and that's where I want to
[1:57:22] say like they have a lot but they don't
[1:57:24] have all we need all truth and so they
[1:57:27] they they you know and so I you know we
[1:57:29] begin conversation and you know we had I
[1:57:31] think we had listened to one of the
[1:57:33] church age messages so I had talked a
[1:57:34] little bit about the church ages with
[1:57:35] them just out in the parking lot after
[1:57:37] the service and and you know if they
[1:57:39] enjoyed the service and just trying to
[1:57:40] you know just be friendly and talk to
[1:57:42] them a little bit you know I wasn't just
[1:57:43] like oo United
[1:57:46] Pentecostals no I was I wasn't doing
[1:57:48] that you're in my knit I'm going to
[1:57:51] convert you no I I was just being
[1:57:54] friendly and suddenly they got they
[1:57:56] caught on the you know got on the
[1:57:57] subject of you know uh you know that
[1:58:00] terrible thing you know you all believe
[1:58:01] in once saved always
[1:58:03] saved as if that was a negative
[1:58:07] thing
[1:58:10] who I mean if Jesus saves me to the
[1:58:14] uttermost we have those songs let talk
[1:58:15] about that um how could I lose that
[1:58:19] doesn't that denigrate the power of God
[1:58:21] if he doesn't save
[1:58:22] me always eternally if I'm saved like if
[1:58:26] that's what the power of God does I
[1:58:28] trust the power of God did the whole
[1:58:30] thing all the way yeah well you you know
[1:58:33] you you know what that does because they
[1:58:34] didn't understand Grace straightened out
[1:58:36] that was a problem and they didn't they
[1:58:38] don't they don't understand godhead in
[1:58:39] the same way and just missing those two
[1:58:41] things though they might baptize the
[1:58:42] same way we do though they might dress
[1:58:44] the same way we do but just those two
[1:58:45] things they don't understand and then
[1:58:48] and then and so we got on this subject
[1:58:49] and I was like oh I I said so I began to
[1:58:51] understand I was like oh what you're
[1:58:52] saying to me is you believe you come and
[1:58:53] receive the Holy Spirit but if you sin
[1:58:55] later if you you make a mistake you lose
[1:58:58] the Holy Spirit yes absolutely you'd
[1:59:00] have to come back repent and get the
[1:59:01] Holy Spirit again I said okay and then I
[1:59:03] said hang on a second now do you believe
[1:59:06] that when you speak in tongues that's
[1:59:07] when the evidence of you getting the
[1:59:08] Holy Ghost he's like yes absolutely
[1:59:10] that's you know I was like hang on a
[1:59:11] second though you baptize in the name of
[1:59:12] the Lord Jesus Christ right yes we do
[1:59:14] you believe though the that that
[1:59:17] Assemblies of God who baptized in the
[1:59:18] name of father Son and Holy Ghost but
[1:59:20] they come to the same altar speak in the
[1:59:21] same tongues that you speak and then
[1:59:23] they leave and they got the Holy Ghost
[1:59:26] yes they spoke in tongues they got the
[1:59:27] Holy Ghost but they baptize wrong
[1:59:31] yes okay what good is the doctrine of
[1:59:33] baptism because I'm I'm struggling but
[1:59:36] what it is is because they don't
[1:59:37] understand godhead the same way we do
[1:59:38] see they make it so extremely one that
[1:59:41] the person of Jesus Christ always
[1:59:43] existent and was always God and God
[1:59:45] cannot be anything else ever like the
[1:59:48] Holy Spirit
[1:59:50] so then if you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:59:52] what have you received well not Jesus
[1:59:53] Christ you've just received his power of
[1:59:56] course you can lose
[2:00:00] that and just just last year I was
[2:00:03] driving up to Indianapolis for a for a
[2:00:05] soccer thing that I was part of and I
[2:00:07] was driving with a with an ex UPC pastor
[2:00:11] and he began to tell me he's like oh man
[2:00:13] we were Oneness we had to be at the
[2:00:14] altar every single time I was like hold
[2:00:17] up you just connect going to the altar
[2:00:20] every single time with Oneness yes
[2:00:22] that's what Oneness people do they're
[2:00:23] always at the altar I was like why why
[2:00:27] does your understanding of Oneness mean
[2:00:29] you got to be at the altar he didn't
[2:00:31] know so you I talked about brother
[2:00:34] Hoover before he was the United
[2:00:35] Pentecostal person I talked about
[2:00:37] praising God be delivered out of
[2:00:38] denomination I said brother Hoover you
[2:00:40] got to help me why does he think this CU
[2:00:42] he don't
[2:00:43] know you know and he said well the it's
[2:00:46] because they believe Jesus Christ always
[2:00:47] existed like this and I was like like oh
[2:00:49] then that that means the Holy Spirit
[2:00:50] isn't Jesus yes that's what they believe
[2:00:53] ho now then I caught it it's like oh
[2:00:56] they don't ever there's you see they
[2:00:58] have no Abiding and dwelling presence of
[2:01:00] Jesus Christ just because there's a
[2:01:01] couple of doctrines that they don't
[2:01:03] quite have it's close there's a lot they
[2:01:05] dress right they baptize in the name of
[2:01:07] Jesus Christ but because they don't
[2:01:08] understand godhead right then God they
[2:01:11] never have the assurance that God
[2:01:12] literally lives on the inside of
[2:01:15] them
[2:01:18] man
[2:01:19] so this is that point where we get to
[2:01:21] and we
[2:01:22] saywell which
[2:01:25] Jesus and I've probably done a terrible
[2:01:27] job of building up this one but I hope
[2:01:28] I've done a pretty good job of building
[2:01:29] up this one which Jesus and the and the
[2:01:33] difference is is message Doctrine the
[2:01:35] difference is can I say it instead of
[2:01:37] message Doctrine can I say it is because
[2:01:39] the Holy Spirit saw fit to bring us a
[2:01:42] man to reveal the Mysteries to us so
[2:01:45] that why so that we can be more relev no
[2:01:49] so that we can be better than the
[2:01:50] Pentecost no so that we can be be be
[2:01:53] happy that we are the people that follow
[2:01:54] our Prophet no so that we can see Jesus
[2:01:58] Christ again because until God sent us
[2:02:01] that Prophet that that that that brought
[2:02:04] us a message that literally was
[2:02:07] Christ this is what we
[2:02:12] had so if I'm one of those preachers
[2:02:14] that says thank God thank God he sent us
[2:02:17] a prophet then I trust you
[2:02:19] understand then young people I trust you
[2:02:22] understand what it is I'm saying because
[2:02:24] without that Prophet do fulfilling what
[2:02:26] the scripture said there had to be a guy
[2:02:29] com and do that's what I had and I'm so
[2:02:32] thankful that this is the Jesus Christ
[2:02:34] that I know in love that I've come to
[2:02:37] cherish because the message came and
[2:02:39] showed me who he is and now I can know
[2:02:43] him I don't have to know three people I
[2:02:45] know one person who now dwells inside of
[2:02:49] me because of the new birth and baptism
[2:02:51] of the Holy Ghost so thank God he sent
[2:02:54] us a prophet thank God there was a
[2:02:56] pillar of fire that came as another
[2:02:59] Ministry to vindicate that man who who
[2:03:03] God said would
[2:03:05] come so that I knew when he said
[2:03:08] something it was what God was saying we
[2:03:11] needed it was always about Christ but
[2:03:14] before Christ could come the restoration
[2:03:17] had to happen because if Christ came
[2:03:19] without the restoration this is the guy
[2:03:22] you're looking for and you'd be like the
[2:03:24] Pharisees when Jesus comes with we're
[2:03:26] looking for a messiah and Jesus comes
[2:03:28] like
[2:03:29] hello they're like he you looking for a
[2:03:31] messiah too man no I'm
[2:03:35] not I
[2:03:37] am what the Messiah came that they were
[2:03:41] looking for and they rejected him
[2:03:43] because they didn't see the
[2:03:46] picture that's right second coming of
[2:03:49] the Messiah going to be any
[2:03:51] different God had to come and show us
[2:03:54] who Jesus Christ was so that we knew who
[2:03:57] he was when he came we already had a
[2:04:01] relationship with him established before
[2:04:03] he ever came Hallelujah so pergam and
[2:04:06] church age again in John 16:13 how be it
[2:04:09] musicians you come how be it when he the
[2:04:11] spirit of Truth the word has come he
[2:04:12] will guide you into all truth Thy word
[2:04:14] is truth
[2:04:16] amen he shall not speak of himself but
[2:04:19] whatsoever he shall hear word of God
[2:04:21] that shall he speak word and he will
[2:04:23] show you things to come the spirit
[2:04:25] bringing the word of Prophecy I want you
[2:04:28] to note very carefully Jesus did not say
[2:04:30] the evidence of being baptized with the
[2:04:31] Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues
[2:04:33] interpreting prophesying or shouting and
[2:04:35] dancing he said the evidence would be
[2:04:38] that you would be in the truth you would
[2:04:40] be in the word of God for your age
[2:04:43] evidence has to do with receiving the
[2:04:46] word now it could be thought that that's
[2:04:49] an offensive way to say it because you
[2:04:51] know we have we have our youth that go
[2:04:52] to Christian I'm going to try to stop
[2:04:54] here but we have youth sometimes that go
[2:04:55] to Christian schools and then they make
[2:04:57] Christian friends and we tell them look
[2:04:59] if they don't receive the word if they
[2:05:00] don't receive the message they don't
[2:05:02] they're they're not taking a Rapture and
[2:05:03] it's like wait but my friend loves
[2:05:06] Jesus I say well that's a problem we got
[2:05:08] to now we got to deal
[2:05:10] with but I think that after what we've
[2:05:13] just shown here the evidence of rece of
[2:05:19] receiving the spirit is to is to see
[2:05:21] this truth right amen like if this was
[2:05:24] presented to you if you present this
[2:05:26] Jesus and you present this Jesus and
[2:05:27] they're
[2:05:28] like I want this
[2:05:31] one I mean I don't think it's offensive
[2:05:34] to say that I just don't think you have
[2:05:35] the Holy Spirit like I don't understand
[2:05:37] how on I don't understand I don't think
[2:05:40] you have really that that intelligent of
[2:05:42] a
[2:05:42] mind because this is a terrible
[2:05:45] picture when the word comes and shows
[2:05:49] this to you of course you would receive
[2:05:52] it this is a this is the god who you can
[2:05:56] know in love this is the god of truth
[2:05:59] that make that just oh make back one
[2:06:01] slide up there we yes that right there
[2:06:03] evidence has to do with receiving the
[2:06:05] word this word shows you this Jesus
[2:06:07] Christ and if you reject this you're
[2:06:09] rejecting Jesus
[2:06:12] amen you might say you're worshiping
[2:06:15] Jesus you might say you love
[2:06:17] Jesus amen but this is Jesus and Jesus
[2:06:21] is his word and this word shows us this
[2:06:24] like it doesn't make sense to reject
[2:06:26] that so I I I I just feel like praise
[2:06:29] God he sent you can go to the last slide
[2:06:31] now we're all we're all good we're down
[2:06:32] here I just feel like thank God he sent
[2:06:34] us a prophet because this is the Jesus
[2:06:37] Christ that is now shown to us because
[2:06:39] of message Doctrine
[2:06:46] specifically it's restoration
[2:06:49] what are we restoring relationship what
[2:06:53] was lost in Eden what needs to be
[2:06:55] restored fellowship with
[2:06:58] God the message of restoration brings us
[2:07:02] back to relationship amen praise thank
[2:07:05] God he sent us a prophet to bring us
[2:07:07] back into relationship amen so you can't
[2:07:11] ever be honest and say you know I'm just
[2:07:13] so tired of this message I just want
[2:07:15] Jesus you can never say that and be
[2:07:17] honest
[2:07:19] amen because there's only one place in
[2:07:22] the word of God that you're going to
[2:07:25] find Jesus amen and that's through what
[2:07:27] the word of God said I would do and
[2:07:29] bring you light in the evening time and
[2:07:30] bring you a message of restoration a
[2:07:32] message of reconciliation before I would
[2:07:35] come
[2:07:36] again and we have it so you can see him
[2:07:40] you can know him that's the that's the
[2:07:42] whole point of all of this friends it is
[2:07:44] Jesus Christ this message is Jesus
[2:07:46] Christ it is the presentation of who
[2:07:49] Jesus Christ is specifically and
[2:07:52] individually to
[2:07:55] you that's why God sent us a
[2:07:58] prophet shall we pray Heavenly
[2:08:03] Father Lord I just want to tell you I
[2:08:05] love you and I'm so thankful you've
[2:08:07] opened our eyes to see these amazing

[2:08:35] realize that you've granted me the
[2:08:37] ability to

[2:08:42] been
[2:08:44] in as you spoke on that day in Matthew
[2:08:47] chapter 13
